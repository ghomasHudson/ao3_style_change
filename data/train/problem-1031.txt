“Please what Sherlock?” John asks as he pulls away.
“I know, I guess that is what happens when you break down in a corner and scream like an animal at everyone who tries to help you.”
“John?” He hears his own voice crack on the words and winces. He doesn’t think he has ever been so uncomposed in John’s presence before, at least not like this. John walks towards him crouching down just a few feet away and he doesn’t say anything, barley even breathes. He has solider face on and Sherlock struggles to deduce what could be so important he would leave his own reception for unless… oh fucking hell he is going to kill Mycroft.
“I want you to fuck me.” Sherlock said this mainly to the sheet wrapped around his body, but he was glancing at John in his peripherals. John was a bit of a loss as to what he should say. Thankfully what Sherlock had asked for didn’t really require speech. John moved slowly until he was kneeling in front of Sherlock, he used his hand to tip Sherlock’s face to look at him. He stared into that smoldering gaze searching to see if there was any fear or doubt in it. “Are you sure?”
“I c-can’t.” And shit Sherlock never stutters. It's too much of a vulnerability and he is more terrified now sitting in his own flat in front of his best friend than he has been in his entire life.
“Oh yeah anything good?”
“Why are you still dressed?” Sherlock asks husky, with a slight twinge of annoyance in his voice. And oh god it really shouldn’t be as hot as it is. John finds himself taking off his shirt and then Sherlock is sitting up and helping him out of his pants. All their previous exploits have been rushed and they never got entirely naked really just removed the necessary obstacles and went to it. This time is different though, and John feels something in his chest ache at the thought that this is the first time he has seen Sherlock in all his glory. Once all of John’s clothes are off, Sherlock seems to take a minute to just take in the sight of him. John Watson hides a lot under those ridiculous jumpers. The tight muscles in his arms and shoulders are no surprise to Sherlock but the reaction he has to the scar on John’s shoulder is. He feels an ache at seeing it and gently reaches down to lightly brush a kiss against it. He feels such an overwhelming wave of gratitude in that moment that John Watson survived the war and came into his life. When Sherlock pulls back he notices that John is looking at him with his head titled to the side and his brows slightly furrowed. Sherlock leans in to kiss the expression away from him. John kisses him slowly then Sherlock pushes his tongue inside and does this rolling thing that always manages to make John see stars.
“Hey Charlie,” John says as he kneels in front of the boy so they can be at eye level. “When you are having a hard time sleeping, something that really helps is to imagine you are in your favorite place. Nothing bad can happen there; it is your piece of paradise and you are completely in control of it. Do you have a place that feels like that to you?” Charlie frowns for a minute and looks at the ground before lifting his head back up and nodding.
Tell me all of the things you couldn’t before
He pulls back from John sending him a small smile before turning and resuming their walk as though nothing out of the ordinary has occurred. John keeps sneaking glances at him from the corner of his eye and Sherlock would find the confusion on his face amusing if it wasn’t such a heartbreaking thought. John really thinks him so incapable of emotion that hugging his best friend, who just found out that his wife is having another man’s baby, is thought to be ground-shaking. It irritates him but at the same time he can’t even blame John.
John is confused as he follows Sherlock up the steps to Scotland Yard.
“Yes John.” John stares at him while Sherlock looks at the ground in front of him, willing the tears that have seemingly sprung out of nowhere to go back into the ducts and just let him get through this moment first. Once John leaves he can cry all he wants, in fact he thinks that he will never stop crying.
When, when you came home
“Our guy is going to get spooked and while his friend tries to hold off the police he will slip out the back, so we are going to intercept him around the back… now.” And then he’s off, John follows close behind. It only takes a moment for John to tackle the man, Sherlock had shot right past him which is odd since he never misses like that. John just shrugs figuring he will double back quite soon.
He starts stroking in time to their thrusts and is leaking all over John’s stomach. John moves one of hands from Sherlock’s hips to his dick and takes over for him, he only strokes twice before Sherlock is screaming his name coming all over them. His body tightens around John, and he comes inside Sherlock. A few moments go by and then Sherlock rolls over onto his side facing John, who also turns over facing Sherlock. John smiles at him and Sherlock can’t help but smile back at him.
“Of course not, Captain.” The word is out of his mouth before Sherlock can think better of it. John goes completely still and he moves his head back so that he can catch Sherlock’s eyes. The slow and smug smirk that John gives him is such that Sherlock can see why he was called ‘Three-continents Watson.’
“Because I’ll never see you again…” John’s eyes go wide and Sherlock can feel the sudden panic as intensely as if it were his own. John still struggles with Sherlock’s ‘death’ and he feels a twinge of pain at the thought.
“I stand by the cat comparison.”
“I’ll meet you there, I need a minute,” John says with a soft smile which Sherlock licks at before leaving the shower and entering his own bedroom; he has the bigger bed. Besides, climbing the stairs with a raging hard on wouldn’t be particularly fun. He grabs some lube from the nightstand before lying down on his Egyptian cotton sheets and spreading his legs; might as well give John something to look at when he comes in. Sherlock uncaps the lube and slicks up his fingers. He is a little shocked at the anticipation he feels, he has had sex before, even amazing sex, but other than someone’s appearance Sherlock has never gone home with someone he likes for who they are. He never really got to know people well enough to care. In a way this is almost more frightening than chasing a criminal through the streets of London. If there is anything that truly scares him it is living a life without John Watson. Strike that - it wouldn’t be a life at all, he would simply be existing. He pushes past the doubts circling his mind; John wants him and he is sick to death of denying that he wants him, too. He presses at his entrance and just as the ring of muscle is relaxing and allowing his fingers access, the door opens and John walks in.
Sherlock only took a couple of seconds to throw on a new shirt but he is frustratingly scared to go back out to the cab and face John. The tension between them is so palpable that Sherlock knows their cab driver has been keeping a wary eye on them just waiting for them to jump each other. Poor bastard is probably confused as hell that John is still outside. Sherlock knows he has been gone too long and John is bound to be suspicious so he forces himself to the kitchen to make John another cuppa to go. It will at least explain the time he has been in here and maybe even make John smile.
“I can try teaching you how to delete it if you wish,” Sherlock offers.
“What’s that?”
Sherlock must be losing his mind because for the first time, he isn’t deducing every little thing. All he can think about is John, love, and the tight heat that is surrounding him. John’s whimpers are more beautiful to him than any song he could play on his violin. His hand finds John’s cock and he strokes in time to the thrusts and this is going to be over far too soon. But they can always go again and again and again. John comes first with a shout, "Sherlock!"
“John…”
Charlie is strangely calm when they meet with him. He crosses his legs and folds his hands neatly on his knees before staring at them both in a way that looks far too grown up on a face so young.
“Are you clean?” Sherlock asks.
“Can I see the email that sent you the money?”
“John, it’s not a danger night.”
“Yes, I needed more support for my neck, I have had some pain in it lately. I hope you don’t mind.”
“Well since you seem to be such a sudden master of deductions, tell me yourself.”
“Who did you write that song for?” Sherlock looks at him incredulously. He has the same look on his face when John does something spectacularly stupid and it is rather annoying. Sherlock doesn’t even try to respond, moving instead to his bedroom and disappearing for a while. John tries not to get aggravated after all he has been living with Mary for a long time and he can admit he hasn’t been a great friend. Maybe something happened while he was off living the domestic life and Sherlock doesn’t want to talk about it. Still there is a slight twinge in his chest when he thinks about the possibility of there being something so big that he doesn’t know about Sherlock. John heaves a heavy sigh of one going off to war before shooting off a quick text to the devil himself.
“John, not really but I expect with you two on the case I am on my way to it.” John can’t help the small shiver of pride going through his body at the words. It has been entirely too long since he has been on a proper case. Sherlock is uncharacteristically silent throughout the entire exchange, he locks eyes with John and nods his head in the direction of the door. John is a bit confused that Sherlock wants him to go first but figures that at this point it’s easier to go along with it. He is just through the door and about to make his way up the stairs where caution tape is stuck all around, that he glances back to see Sherlock still on the sidewalk with Lestrade. Sherlock’s head is bent slightly towards the DI’s and from the body language seems to be comforting him. Lestrade looks at Sherlock with such a miserable expression that John can feel the despair from where he is standing. Eventually it seems that whatever Sherlock said has gotten through because Lestrade walks toward the street where a black town car is already pulling up for him.
“True,” Sherlock acknowledges.
Sherlock turns his head a little but not far enough for their eyes to meet. “Good morning,” he says evenly.
He shakes his head, then bends forward and selects one of the dildos, holding it up to the light. He rubs a thumb and index finger over it, and says, “This one. Evidence bag?”
They talk about the case a little on the way there, but John is paying more attention to Sherlock himself, thinking that he would do this for the rest of his life if he possibly could: work with Sherlock, walk anywhere with him, eat just about anything with him. If only he could have the rest of it, too! But for right now, the prospect of pasta or pizza or anything substantial, delicious, and filling is pretty perfect.
. The second part, at least. But – ” He stops, unsure how to finish his sentence.
John looks contrite. “Sorry,” he says, though he’s breathing heavily. “Well – do you want the loo, then, or – never mind, I’m closer. I can – ” He gets himself carefully off the far side of the massage table, shielding himself from Sherlock’s view, then takes several large strides toward the loo and shuts the door firmly behind him.
“Especially a wedding-themed one,” John points out. “I just wondered. I mean, obviously she’s got to be charged and prosecuted. She’s murdered six people.”
“Sounds good,” he says. He stands up and casually lays a heavy book on top of his laptop, probably entirely unaware of how much it draws attention to the fact that he wants his laptop and whatever he was looking at on it left strictly alone. He goes downstairs with Mrs Hudson, her chattering about snow in the forecast, leaving Sherlock behind to glare at the computer where it’s sitting.
– well! So – when did this start, then?”
“I’m sorry,” John says again, having already said it earlier. “I should have stayed home.”
Sherlock doesn’t text him about meeting by the lifts. John goes downstairs for breakfast at twenty-five past and doesn’t run into him on the way. He makes his way to the dining hall alone and immediately spots Sherlock in the dining room, already seated at a table with the same couple he was talking to after the marriage seminar and one of the single women from the event last night. John bites his lip and debates, then decides to go and sit at the same table, only across from Sherlock, next to a couple he’s never met. Their names are Betty and Keith and as soon as they hear his accent, Betty wonders aloud if he and Sherlock know each other.
Molly sighs. “I promised Mary I would never tell a soul this,” she begins. “But given that I don’t think she’s ever planning on coming back… John, perhaps you should know that you’re not Rosie’s father. David is.”
John cannot process that this is happening. The police have arrived and an ambulance has come to take Mrs Hudson to a hospital, though she fussed throughout and said it was just a bump. Sherlock insisted, though, so she’s gone. John barely heard it, bent over in one of the kitchen chairs while Lestrade’s people swarm over the tiny flat.
Sherlock doesn’t answer this, apparently relapsing into a sort of numb silence, but he turns and makes his way down the corridor, pausing only long enough to step out of his shoes, his fingers working at the buttons of his cuffs. He’s already shrugging gingerly out of the torn shirt as John gets into the loo, turning to face the shower rather than either John or the mirror, his head bent forward. “Just sterilise it, if you would,” he says, his voice somewhat muffled.
“I need – I want to touch you, but I don’t – I’ve never – ” Sherlock stops, fumbling a little.
John marvels inwardly that Sherlock sat there playing this game with these strangers and overtly compared him to them. Interesting. “And after?” he can’t help asking. “How did the night part go?”
John attempts to make himself breathe, even loosening a fist from the sheets in favour of getting his fingers into Sherlock’s curls. “God, I love you,” he says, the words coming out spontaneously, without forethought.
A loud knock on the door and a jingling of keys startles them both and they break apart. “Dr Watson? Mr Holmes?”
“Do you want to?” This is a direct challenge now, one that Lucas can hardly avoid.
“Today I think it’s perfectly understandable,” Sherlock says gently. “I would never condemn anything you did or didn’t do, or tell you that I think that you should feel guilty, but if you do, then possibly you simply need to let yourself feel it. Today, at least. Tomorrow you can work on letting it go again.”
John swallows hard, then nods at his hands. “I – okay. Yeah. I… deserve that.”
“That was so hot,” John murmurs, stroking Sherlock’s chest obsessively. “You’re phenomenal. I can’t wait to do that again. God, your cock is fantastic!”
“Seriously, Harry, leave it – ” John warns, but his sister ignores him.
John shakes his head. “Thought about it, but never tried it. I don’t know – maybe I was afraid of how much I might like it… once you start repressing, it’s hard to know where to draw the line, you know.” He closes his eyes. “Oh God, yeah – just like that! You can – you can add another one, if you want.”
Sherlock looks at John, obviously wavering. “Do you want to go?”
Sherlock shudders. “Never.”
“Have you met him? He’s a creep,” Todd says with distaste. “Three years ago, Lucas gave me a Mercedes for Christmas. Last year he gave me some clothes, and suddenly Paul had a new Porsche. He never said that it had been given to him, or by who, but I suspected then.”
John settles back into his chair and steels himself for the intense boredom about to set in, and focuses on keeping his expression somewhere between mildly interested and neutral. The speaker blathers on and on about what traditional marriage is, represents, and their collective duty as Americans to propagate the species, set good examples, and a bunch of other crap. John wonders if someone neglected to tell the speaker that there are actually non-Americans in the room, too, but it’s quite likely that he and Sherlock are the only ones, so it probably hasn’t registered as a consideration for these people.
He’s referring to the jumper which he always labels as ‘the oatmeal jumper’ in slightly derisive tones, yet also with undeniable affection. John swats at his wrist with his menu. “Knock it off,” he warns.
Sherlock must be feeling it, because he doesn’t argue for once. “You’re right,” he says instead. “Maybe I will.”
Sherlock waits warily. Does John want him to admit this? “So it’s seemed to me, too,” he says cautiously.
I pull my head back so that I can look into his eyes. (Am I supposed to be a gentleman and turn this down? Or would he take that as a rejection?) I search his face. “Are you – sure?” I ask. “I mean, I would – I would love that, Sherlock. But only if you’re sure. There’s no rush, you know.”
Poor woman, John thinks. She needed help and certainly didn’t get any from her friends. Love is a vicious motivator, indeed. And then her long-time friend not only ditched her, but went on to be Chrissy Jessop’s maid of honour at the wedding that should have been Andrea’s, on that beautiful Jamaican beach in the sunset. He gets it, the motive, or at least the feelings behind it. But then to lay her plans, waiting as these people one by one strayed into her path, and calmly, coldly planned and executed their murders… Well, maybe not the car bomb, but whatever Sherlock knows about that, he hasn’t seen fit to tell him. There’s something odd about that, about Sherlock’s reluctance, but it certainly wouldn’t be the first time he’s withheld information from John.
– you want. No holds barred. Not anymore.”
Rosie’s father? What if that comes out down the line and she hates me for not having told her, or for not having given her the chance to know her real father? Do I owe it to her to find out? I mean – I kind of thought I did. That was at least half the reason I came here in the first place. Or – to the village, I mean.”
He follows this with a slanted glance that hits Sherlock directly in the knees and makes him reach hastily for his water lest he choke. “Really?” he asks, rallying and looking directly across the table at John.
Sherlock shrugs, just his right shoulder lifting slightly. “It was good,” he says. “Corey’s friends are actually very nice. We saw a film that one of them was in, once. You and I, I mean. I couldn’t remember the title, then or now. But they were all quite nice.”
The sitting room is dark; there’s only one lamp on at the other end of the sofa. It’s very quiet, and Sherlock is suddenly extremely conscious of John’s proximity. He turns his head and finds that John’s face is only a few inches away. John raises his gaze from the infant to Sherlock’s eyes, and for a long moment they just look at each other, the air between them charged. Then John moves forward very slowly and kisses him. It’s almost tentative, unsure of its welcome, but Sherlock responds instinctively, his lips tightening against John’s. It ends too quickly. Without consciously thinking about it, he leans toward John, seeking his mouth, and John doesn’t deny him. They kiss again, longer this time, then again after that, again, again. It’s magnetic, the pull between them, and John isn’t going anywhere. He puts the arm that was on the back of the sofa properly around Sherlock’s shoulders and kisses him again, his mouth more certain now, the tempo accelerating. Sherlock drinks in kiss after kiss, their lips parting and meeting over and over again. There doesn’t seem to be any need to stop and discuss this; it feels as though it was wholly inevitable, that it happened precisely on schedule, Sherlock thinks dizzily, sucking at John’s mouth as though it’s oxygen and he’s drowning. He manages to free his right arm and gets it around John’s back, and John’s right hand is squeezing his upper left arm where it’s cradling the baby. The kisses grow deeper and more breathless, and Sherlock feels half-drunk on them. His chest feels so full it could burst. John’s tongue and lips are sucking at Sherlock’s lower lip and then it shifts and his tongue is in Sherlock’s mouth, pressing into Sherlock’s, and Sherlock’s heart rate trebles. He moves his hand to John’s face, cradling it, thumb pressing into John’s cheekbone as they kiss and kiss and kiss and it’s so intensely good that Sherlock can hardly stand it. John puts the hand that was on his arm on Sherlock’s face, too, and it’s so much, this smallest of things, that Sherlock almost thinks he could die of this heady blend of joy, of long-denied fulfilment, of overwhelming love swimming through his being.
Sherlock shrugs. “That’s what the other days of the week are for, then. What’s the point of being self-employed if we can’t choose to go away when we like? Besides, it’s not as though we haven’t earned it at this point.”
“It is,” Sherlock allows. “But it’s also very much about what makes a good society, what good leadership is, and how to not let your society become a militant oligarchy.”
a dead end. Let’s turn around and come back tomorrow. We won’t be able to see any traces of evidence in this darkness, anyway, and they’ve got the lead on us despite us having the car.”
John’s stomach clenches, though he knows this is stupid. “What did you tell him?”
“It’s okay,” John cuts in, gentle, putting his arms around Sherlock again. “There’s no set ritual, as such. I thought – I’m dying to be naked with you, Sherlock. To feel you against me – can we take our clothes off now?”
Is it odd that they’ve never properly talked about it? It seems odd, Sherlock thinks, but he’s no expert. They’ve never really talked about that day in the hospital. Or how John was going to leave the cane and never return. Never say goodbye to his face. Sherlock shudders and pushes the thought as far back into the recesses of his mind as it will go. Some things just aren’t bearable and that’s one of them.
John thinks of his own would-be affair and feels stung. Sherlock probably isn’t thinking of him, specifically, but still.
Andrea smiles, too, though not very certainly. “The open bar often has that effect on our guests,” she says lightly. “Getting anywhere with your case?”
Ella smiles. “Miracles of this nature can happen, particularly when there are deep feelings on both sides,” she tells him. Now she looks at Sherlock. “Whose suggestion was it that John come back to Baker Street? I’m rather assuming this was the case, since you arrived together.”
John almost smiles at this. “I left because I thought I should get out of the way, in case you did want that,” he says, his tone still a bit abrupt. He still hasn’t finished. “What about Janine?” he presses. “I mean, with the papers…”
It takes Sherlock a moment to realise that he means sex, and the realisation hits him somewhere around the pelvis, leaving him temporarily unable to form words. He recovers. “True, but the hiking trails are closed at night,” he reminds John, and John snickers.
macarons.”
Sherlock smiles for real this time, and John’s gut finally unknots itself. “Good. So far I haven’t the faintest clue who it might be. I need you, John. Come with me and conduct your light.”
“You’re brilliant. You’re perfect.” Sherlock swiftly stoops to retrieve it. He pushes the small tube into my hands, his fingers actually shaking in their need. “Open it,” he requests, or orders, and I don’t even care which it is. He pulls the plug out and gives it to me.
With relief, John burrows deeper into his heap of bedding and the comfort of it carries him off to sleep again within minutes.
Another voice adds its agreement, and John’s chest swells almost visibly. “Thanks,” he says, and Sherlock feels pleased for him – as well as tremendously possessive.
Sherlock threads the needle driver with slightly steadier fingers. “Stop,” he repeats, and if it comes out rather pleadingly, so be it. “Let’s – come back to that. Tell me what to do here. I need you to help me.”
Grinning to himself, Sherlock organises the kettle, pours John a glass of water and a shot of whiskey and brings it all over with the bottle of paracetamol tucked under his arm. “There we are,” he says. “I’ll be right back.”
He looks over at John’s quietly snoring form and feels a deep stab of longing. He can’t even put into words what the longing is for, specifically, just that it lies beyond the borders of his personal experience, of his expertise, in some forbidden area that he cannot breach. He does not think himself a coward, but there are boundaries that must be guarded, kept secure, and this is one of them. There are many reasons for it, but if he had to put the first and foremost into words, it simply comes down to his quiet personal conviction that what he feels for John is far stronger than what John thinks he feels for him, and that the resultant imbalance would prove overwhelming and uncomfortable for John once he were to realise. And that point, Sherlock would be left without resource or aid, dangerously overextended, all of his most privately feelings laid bare, with no way to regain his own fortress or salvage the ruins of their friendship from that disastrous point to any recognisable extent. It’s the only way to proceed that will leave them with anything.
“I had a bagel on my way to the hospital.” Sherlock adds sugar while John puts milk in his tea and then passes it to him, their old routine. “I thought about bringing some flowers as an apology, but then I thought perhaps that would just make it even worse. Flowers are generally associated with romance and I didn’t want to walk in there with flowers and get her hopes up or something.”
Marjorie’s mouth falls open. “Wha – how did you know that we were talking about October as one of the possibilities? And actually… that’s rather brilliant! We could do autumn colours, and Jim would think he was getting his way. I
John feels a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth despite himself, in spite of everything that’s happened in the past twenty-four hours. Out of the corner of his eye he can see that they’ve already drunk almost half the bottle of whiskey. The sitting room windows are boarded up, too. “With the agents out in the corridor?” he asks, his eyebrows rising. “That’s a bit kinky…”
John glances at Sherlock again, then says, “And you think he… stayed in someone else’s room after?”
John sighs. He thinks about searching for Randolph Winters, then decides that the connection there is obvious enough. Winning a photography contest with his photo of Ian and Chrissy would have been enough to make him a target of Andrea’s need for vengeance. He checks the time and realises that it’s time for lunch, starting in five minutes. Sherlock is generally punctual for these meals… since he hasn’t come back to the room, maybe he’ll come to lunch? Somehow John feels dubious about this, but he gets up and goes down, anyway, hoping against hope that he’ll run into Sherlock on his way there. He doesn’t, though, and Sherlock isn’t at table sixteen, either. He pulls out a chair and sits down at a place that has empty chairs on either side of him should Sherlock turn up. It would be more than a little awkward to have their first morning after encounter with a few hundred other witnesses watching, but right now he’d take it. He checks his phone again. Still nothing. His text to Sherlock says it was delivered, but hasn’t been read yet. He sends another one.
“I’m sorry,” John says again, even though he’s already said it and even though it cautiously seems like they might be out of the danger zone. “I just – I wanted to make it feel – you know – safe. Comfortable. I knew it was a pretty big thing to do for the first time, and I wanted it to be a nice experience for you. I’d told myself before that I should stop kissing you, but then you kissed me first, and I ended up just… going with it. But – and I knew this going in, but still, I – doing what we did last night was too intense. I couldn’t hide it anymore.”
“Waiting is overrated,” Sherlock states. “And afterward, we’ll be full. At least if this feast is anything to go by.” He stops talking in favour of kissing John’s throat, his head craned around over John’s shoulder, and John exhales loudly and tips his head back to allow Sherlock better access, his eyes closed.
“Must have been a bit of a shock,” John offers.
“Of course. It’s in my pocket.” John opens his door, not waiting, but Sherlock is right behind him.
“It’s about that time at Ella’s, when we were talking about all the sex stuff,” John says. He sits back a bit, though his thigh is still pressing into Sherlock’s, their fingers still woven together.
She lowers her voice. “Did he go home last night, then? Only I didn’t hear the door…”
I nod. “With peas, of course.”
Sherlock wants to respond, but John is kissing him again. Which is just fine. “Me neither,” he manages a few moments later, his heart thudding in his chest.
Mycroft sighs. Neither of them has touched their menu. “Shall we order first?” he suggests. “Might as well get it out of the way.”
When it’s finally over, he leaves the room on his own, but feels Sherlock’s presence beside him in the crowd, even though he was nowhere nearby when John passed the doors. They’re surrounded in the lift, but they’re the only two who get off on the fourteenth floor.
John moans. Sherlock inadvertently found a particularly sensitive place and he can feel himself leaking into Sherlock’s hand. “You don’t need any guidance whatsoever. This is absolutely phenomenal,” he gets out. Sherlock’s soft curls are brushing against his chin and shoulder and that adds to it, too.
Sherlock puts himself on John’s right again and puts an arm around his back, careful to avoid the wound. John leans into him, putting his own arm around Sherlock’s back for support and they follow Mycroft and the others at a distance.
“And yet the other incidents are all wholly unrelated to the kitchen, except that they happened to take place at or just after having left Chilton College,” Sherlock counters. “The rental car explosion, the fall, and the heart attack are all completely separate.”
“Last night,” he says. “You carried me all the way to the car – at a run! You astound me, you know. You’re – phenomenal. Absolutely incredible.”
Sherlock leans forward, still holding his knife and fork. “Would it help if I told you that there’s nothing to be afraid of? That there’s nothing you could possibly say that would… make this stop being what it is?”
. Awkward, but John had agreed without much of an argument, and he and Rosie had moved in the next day. It took some adjusting, life with a baby in the house, but Mrs Hudson’s been quite good about taking her off their hands. Meanwhile, John’s work has ebbed and flowed, but these days both clinics have all but closed. Several of the nurses and doctors have departed to work in hospitals and testing centres, and John’s been told he’s off the hook, given that he lives with a senior and a young child. John didn’t argue.
He’s gasping like a fish out of water, his arms shaking, hips pumping himself into the heat of John’s body, deeper and harder than he would have dared five minutes earlier. John is reaching down to grab at himself and Sherlock thinks that he should be doing that for him. He’s only just got his fingers around John’s when John arches upward and comes, wetness spraying hotly out and catching them both in the belly and chest. His body spurts again, clenching around Sherlock, and that’s it – he closes his eyes and lets himself go, giving one more hard thrust and feeling the wave break over him, turning himself inside out, flooding John’s body with gushes of wet release. He can hear himself, shouting and slamming into John, coming more and still more after that. The orgasm seems to go on for ages, his entire body prickling with it, flushing over his skin and huffing out his lungs.
“In a two-room structure on the outskirts of Soskut. Interpol took out the three guards and removed Davidson without being caught. However, we’re waiting to find the rest of the team, and then the rest of the organisation.”
Lestrade’s voice comes back. “He’s just gone into the building to sweep the first floor again, and I’m in the surveillance van!”
Sherlock finds it and gives it to John, who opens it at once. “Jesus Christ,” he says in disbelief.
John chuckles into his hip, then straightens up to smile dreamily into Sherlock’s face, cupping it with both hands, and Sherlock feels the cold platinum of the ring he gave John on his cheek. “I told you,” John says simply, still smiling. “I missed you.”
The roast beef is tender and delicious, the Yorkshire pudding perfect, and John’s chicken is exquisite. They eat their fill, talking with Kyle and Todd, and a new sense of contentment comes over Sherlock. As they wait on dessert, Sherlock leans over. “Todd,” he says, “we wondered if there’s any chance we could see Margaret while we’re here. I’m not sure whether she would be available on the weekend, but if there’s any chance at all, we’d really love to see her. Tomorrow or Sunday, whenever she’s free.”
Lee looks pleased. “Go right ahead, then.”
He paces around it for a bit, feeling attacked and stressed out. And called out. They asked all of three questions or something and decided they knew everything about him, about his life. Without even knowing what Mary was, they knew that Sherlock has always taken higher priority than any part of his family life, that casework has always trumped his medical career since the day he first met Sherlock, that Rosie has, unfortunately, never really fit in with any of it. They saw, accurately, that Sherlock has always been the element that kept his life from fitting together in the traditionally acceptable ways – and that John’s always preferred it that way. It’s true: he always could have cut back on casework, spent less time with Sherlock, found himself a full-time job at some clinic in the suburbs, close to Mary’s flat. A standard nine-to-five job that would give him his evenings free to stay home with his wife and daughter.
Mycroft sighs, then puts his hands on the desk and fits his long fingers together. “I assume you read his letter.”
John makes a sound almost like a snarl and his hips seem to go wild. He comes with all ten of Sherlock’s fingers digging into the meat of his arse, making a noise loud enough to startle Sherlock into clapping a hand over his mouth. John is still thrusting, even as come slips out of Sherlock’s body and up the crease of his arse. Finally John collapses, his back heaving, and Sherlock strokes over it with reverent, lazy, sated hands.
Lestrade smirks, but jerks his head in the direction of the coffee maker. “Help yourself, mate.”
“It will make sense, both of us being men,” Sherlock explains with a shrug as he presses the
Sherlock bites his lower lip, clearly reluctant to say whatever he’s thinking. “I… never mind. It’s fine.”
They put their meal together in comfortable companionship, moving around each other in shared space that John can’t help but think feels chummier than it used to – no, it’s more than that. More familiar, more intimate, even. They make coconut rice and jasmine tea to go with the stir-fry, then sit down across from one another to tuck in. They don’t talk about anything particularly important, but it’s comfortable, the warm light of the overhead lamp seeming to knit the space between them closer than usual.
Sherlock looks out his window. “What is?”
“Good,” Mary says, her voice hard. “I will not have you following me. I thought I made it pretty clear that I was done with you.”
“Here’s what I don’t get,” John says, leaning back against Brenda’s desk. “You seem like you were a fairly decent person before all of this happened. I get it: that was extremely rough, him leaving you for someone like Chrissy like that. But to go from that to murder? And your own friends, too. I get that they betrayed you. I would have been incredibly hurt by that. But
John looks up. Sherlock reaches for his face with both hands and they kiss hard, no one even trying to hide the arousal behind the game now. John gets the rest of Sherlock’s shirt undone and pushes it off him, kissing Sherlock’s neck and jawline with abandon, loving the way Sherlock breathes and breathes through it, like he can’t get enough oxygen. “Where else?” he asks before his lips close around Sherlock’s earlobe, then backs away just enough to let Sherlock answer.
“Er, I’ll have the raspberry soufflé,” John says, scanning the menu card and making a rapid choice. He
John can’t help it. He grins. “True enough,” he says. “That just means we’ll have to look a little harder into these other ones. I think we definitely need to talk to the kitchen staff about the food poisoning, the actual poisoning, and the man who was locked in the freezer.”
The door opens behind him and John emerges, blinking in the sunlight. He frowns immediately, seeing Paul there, and comes over to position himself beside Sherlock, putting an arm around his back. “Sorry to interrupt,” he says, with a quick, tight smile in Paul’s direction. “Our meeting is about to start, though.”
Alex raises her eyebrows. “Doesn’t he call himself a sociopath sometimes? I’ve heard him say it in interviews.”
Sherlock nods. “Yes. I… yes.”
His phones chimes with a text: Lestrade’s ping. I groan into his mouth and he pulls away, looking apologetic. “I don’t have to – ” he begins, but I cut him off.
This stops whatever John was about to say. He fidgets with the instrument he’s holding, then says, “Well, in that case, we’ll see. They do help me to focus on finer details, so…” He clears his throat again and reaches for the glasses, putting them back on in his best attempt to look nonchalant about it and busying himself with threading the polydioxanone.
“You love hanging up on him,” John says, still amused. “Have you noticed that you always do that? End the call before he can? It’s petty, and I love it.”
John’s lips purse. “You’re slurring,” he points out. “And I’m going to have to stitch this, I think. The date, Sherlock, or I’m sending you to a hospital – ”
more than anything. Can we do that?”
Sherlock rubs at the back of his neck. Definitely uncomfortable, then. “Hi,” he says. “You’re – should I… do something?” He fumbles to clarify. “Help with – anything?”
John is silent all the way back to London, only speaking when Donovan or Lestrade address him for some reason. Sherlock does not try to engage him. John said that he needed time to process; therefore Sherlock does not bother him on the trip back. It’s a relief when they finally reach Baker Street, getting their bags from the boot and going inside. Mrs Hudson isn’t home from the looks of it, or else she’d have come out to say hello, and wouldn’t that have made everything more awkward? Sherlock is glad of the silence as he climbs the stairs, hyper-aware of John’s presence behind him.
Sherlock makes a vaguely affirmative sound. “Yes. While you were in the shower. Everything is fine.”
Sherlock swallows and nods, touching his tongue to his lower lip. “For longer than I like to admit,” he says, the confession made safe by the very fact of being in John’s arms.
John can feel his heart thudding into his own chest. He shakes his head. “No. This is – anything we do right now will be, er, pretty new for me, too.”
funny.”
“Let’s assume interest on my part, given the circumstances,” Sherlock interrupts. “I know that it’s – optional. I just don’t know what to do if I
Sherlock looks at John, careful not to disturb him. It’s been a long time since he’s seen John’s face this relaxed, all the lines eased into gentleness. A lock of his hair has fallen across his forehead and Sherlock wants to smooth it back. He hesitates, then does it.
you not mean it?”
, then?”
John finds himself profoundly moved by this. “Same,” he says. “This is all I’ve wanted for so long.”
“It is, thanks. As you predicted, we got over that hump in publicity pretty smoothly. We’ve hired a few more staff and things are great. Kyle is the Director of Operations – essentially he’s doing his old job and what Lucas used to do together, which has freed me up from some of the administrative stuff. We hired him a better assistant, Will, and he’s taken some of the weight off Kyle’s shoulders, too.” Todd eyes them both. “And you two?” he asks. “This is dinner, not a therapy session, but how are you doing?”
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “I really couldn’t care less. Just concentrate and get this solved, before there’s a terrorist outbreak in Newcastle or something! Your personal issues can wait.”
John leaps at the rescue. “No, I’ve gone and left it in my room,” he says. “Do you know what my next session is? Am I in the same group as you?”
“Who would that be?” Gary asks, without inflection of any sort.
“To drive?” Sherlock is amused. “Around nine hours, give or take.”
Sherlock opens his eyes in time to see Thom elbow Justin. “You know the rules,” he scolds. “We’re not supposed to bring circle meeting discussions out of the circle!”
He sighs and gives it to John, who also sighs. “Of course he can’t stay out of even this,” John says, with irritation, and gives the card back to Margaret.
Gary and Karen have been furiously whispering together and look back at them as the agents begin to herd the group toward the doors, curious hotel guests looking on all the while. John gives them a defiant glare and reaches openly for Sherlock’s hand, and sees them both register it.
Mycroft presses something on the screen of his phone. “I pulled every string in the book to get this,” he informs them shortly. “But I finally have it: video surveillance from the Bahnhofstrasse branch of Crédit Suisse in Zurich the day after Mary died. Their surveillance only shows the client from the back of the head. I realise that this isn’t conclusive proof. However – ”
“Why would I have lint on my hand?”
“A four-year-old this time,” Sherlock tells him. “Robbie Blackwell. The adolescent is sixteen, Tamara Jennings. Apparently she simply failed to come home after school and her parents thought she might have gone out with friends or something, and didn’t report it until after midnight. Robbie Blackwell, on the other hand, was taken from his babysitter’s house about an hour ago. He was sleeping over. The babysitter was a university friend of the mother’s. The Blackwells are at a funeral in Dorset and left Robbie with a friend.”
John makes himself nod. “Yeah. It was… not great.” That’s a pretty underwhelming summary; he thinks unwittingly of those long months before the wedding, the constant conflict and attempts to keep himself firm in his decision, the inner agony over choosing Mary over Sherlock, the one life over the other, the arguments with himself that he could make it work. And then that night at Magnussen’s office tower, finding Sherlock with a bullet in his chest, dying before his very eyes. Mary, that night in Leinster Gardens one week later. The dread of going back, feeling the walls crowding in on every side every single day thereafter. Her death, and the way she haunted him even after, for weeks, when all he wanted was to be free of it, free of the guilt associated with every single part of it. The affair that never quite happened, the longing for escape.
My brain comes on properly. “Oh,” I say. “Okay – yeah, we should go. I’ll, er, be right down.”
real, however fantastical it still feels. The rest of reality, then: it’s time he made some decisions, or gave the whole thing some serious thought at the very least. He dries his hands and goes back into the bedroom. He knows he told Sherlock that he wanted them to decide about this together, and he meant it. Whatever happens in the future is going to have a huge affect on Sherlock, obviously, and he deserves to have some say in that. That said, Rosie is ultimately John’s responsibility. He’s got to at least figure out how he’s feeling about the whole thing.
“John, I – ” Sherlock stops, not knowing how to retract that, take it back.
“I’ll have someone get you one,” Mycroft decides, and waits until she’s ready to stride off toward the door.
John makes a hummed sound of agreement directly into Sherlock’s flesh, lifts off just long enough to encourage him. “Please,” he says, his own voice wrecked with arousal. “Come in my mouth, Sherlock – I want you to – ” He goes back to sucking Sherlock off, squeezing his arse from beneath and pulling him deeper into his throat. He feels it a split second before it happens. Sherlock cries out, then his breath chokes off and tremors shake through his body. He comes in hot spatter against the back of John’s throat, buried so deeply there that John doesn’t even taste it. There’s another gasp of breath and then he’s spurting again, his entire frame convulsing. John swallows and swallows, then pulls back so that only the head of Sherlock’s cock is in his mouth, massaging the head of it as the last of it ebbs out onto his tongue.
“Hey.” John’s voice is warmer now, and he reaches for Sherlock’s wrist and leans in, kissing his shoulder. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to say it like that. Everything’s fine, Sherlock. I know it’s hard to believe that this is really happening, but it is. And I’m really glad it is.”
Sherlock’s head is dropped forward and he seems to be struggling to breathe at all. He’s breathing in shallow, uneven gasps and can’t seem to answer.
I’m breathing audibly and trying to quell any nervousness about the thought of him putting his fingers in me. I’ve never done that before, not that I haven’t thought about it. And I had that toy, the prostate stimulator, but I got rid of it years ago, in one of my phases of ashamedly thinking it was too gay for a supposedly straight man to own. Plus, I mean, Sherlock is right – I did always sort of assume that I’d be the one top if we ever got to this, but then again, it’s Sherlock. He’s always turned everything on its head and I’ve gone right along with it. And now, if this is what he needs, then I can do that for him. I’ve got a hand in his hair now, stroking and gripping in turns, my cock throbbing in his mouth. It’s intensely intimate and I love it.
He looks over at Sherlock to see if this will make him smile, but he doesn’t react apart from the crease that appears at the bridge of his nose. He looks as though he wants to say something, but avoids making eye contact and just makes a non-committal sound. He accepts his mug of tea from John, then says, “Shall we watch the news?”
Her eyebrows lift. He’s forgotten her name. “Sorry?”
Just the single word. Suddenly there isn’t quite enough oxygen in the kitchen. John attempts to breathe anyway, his heart suddenly racing as the silence spins out following Sherlock’s singular word. “You matter to me, too,” he says with difficulty, and it’s not nearly enough, but if he says anymore he’ll be in truly deep waters. Still, though, he’s got to add something, because his apology wasn’t quite finished, either. “I’ll – I’ll try to do better, Sher – I mean – you deserve better than what I’ve been, lately. The hospital. What happened there. And – the cane. Saying goodbye. That letter. All of it.”
Margaret leans forward. “Why, John? Why that, in particular?”
They break apart with reluctance and Sherlock goes to the door.
“Yes.” MI5, MI6, CIA: it depends on the day, really. “I’d refer you to my brother, but I’m sure you’ve never heard of him. Rather above your pay grade,” Sherlock says loftily. “I can have him on the phone, if you like, however – ”
The employee nods, her forehead creasing. She’s in her mid-twenties, probably a student, John thinks. Maybe doing a masters at one of the colleges. “It was pretty gruesome.”
It takes John a moment to recover his powers of speech, but when he does, he says, still breathing hard, “Sherlock – I can’t believe you just swallowed! You shouldn’t have done that! Safe sex, remember?”
John glances at it, too. “She’s still sleeping,” he says. “Come down and have a cup of tea first. Or coffee, if you’d rather. Breakfast, too, if you like. Then I’ll pack her a bag and we’ll get her fed and that.”
John makes a slightly irritated sound. “I forgot about that. We could always leave her with Mrs Hudson?”
“Colin is going to unzip Eric now and get onto his knees,” Adam says, and it unfolds as he says.
She leads John over to far wall to the left of the kitchen door and he spots both their suit jackets on the otherwise empty rack right away. “Oh, good,” he says. “Sherlock would hate to have lost this.”
“I love you,” he says, out of the blue, and Sherlock’s heart soars.
Sherlock makes a sound that John can’t decipher.
More coaching. Alarm bells jangle faintly in the back of John’s mind. “Erm, okay – look, just, er, just calm down,” he says. “What happened? Take your coat off,” he adds.
Suddenly Sherlock grabs at my forearm and his cock spasms. He lets out a single, sharp sound of need from his nose and mouth at the same time and then he’s coming all over my cock and lower abdomen, and it’s so hot that I moan, myself, my cock twitching like it’s physically reaching for him. Sherlock’s forehead is condensed, his mouth stretched wide almost in a grimace as his cock spurts again, another hot glob of it landing on my skin. “Sorry!” he gasps, his entire frame shaking.
John smiles. “Sex is messy,” he says, shrugging it off.
Sherlock feels his lips compress. “You’re always asleep by the time he goes,” he says, dodging the question.
This time they’re both on the sofa, reading novels as the evening deepens into night. Their legs are touching and across the room, a fire is crackling in the grate, warding off the November chill. It’s the eighteenth of the month. Sherlock does a hasty calculation in his head: three months until the wedding, plus a week or so. He opens his mouth, inhales, then hesitates. Perhaps he’ll only stir up trouble by trying to ask this again, but at the same time, how can he just leave it to go on like this? He feels John drifting away from him and it makes him feel helpless. “John,” he begins, waiting for John to look up, acknowledge him.
“Rosie,” Sherlock repeats, getting hastily to his feet. “I’ll just go and check.” He moves swiftly out of the sitting room and starts quietly up the stairs to John’s room, silently cursing the warmth of the silence and whatever John was about to say. Why can’t he just leave it alone? He stops at the landing, not wanting to wake the child, counts out seven minutes, then returns. He throws a wary look in John’s direction before sitting down again, but John’s eyes are downcast, hidden in his book. He does not attempt to speak again, to Sherlock’s devout relief, instead letting the silence win out until it’s time to go to bed. He gets up and, after a cursory exchange of saying goodnight, leaves Sherlock sitting alone by the fire.
John watches Mary with loathing on his face. “Do you have anything to say to any of us?” he asks. “It won’t change your sentencing, but for your own, personal redemption, Mary. Anything?”
“I’m your
“Okay,” John says. He figures he should probably back off about now. “Have you found answers? I’m just curious. Really. Not trying to grill you here.”
“I’m going,” John decides. He turns to the student, having forgotten about her for a second, and thrusts his half-finished cup of coffee at her. “Take this! I’ve got to go. Suspicious bag – get yourself out of here!” He doesn’t wait for her response, making for the steps at a run. He shoulders his way through the edges of the protest and finds the bag Sherlock was talking about. It’s just an innocuous navy backpack, but suspiciously unattended. He glances around but no one pays him any attention as he pulls it gingerly behind the pillar and gets it unzipped. In the dimness of overhang of the massive building, the blinking red lights are the first thing he sees and his heart seems to stop. “I’ve got a bomb!” he says urgently, keeping his voice as low as he can so that the people around him won’t hear and start a panic.
“Okay.” John wonders if he should ask to hear the rest of it, about Sherlock’s nightmares about Mary, but Sherlock’s breathing has slowed and John’s not sure he should deliberately keep him awake. Maybe in the morning, or at some other point.
Sherlock exhales deeply. “I love
“Nonsense, I’m just lying low for a few days,” Irene says breezily. She glances around. “Though if I’d known it was going to be such a mess…” Her nose wrinkles delicately.
. It seemed inadequate for what it made him feel, having someone else’s hand touching his most intimate, private flesh, provoking that strength of reaction. The very thought of the orgasm itself made him twitch again. He thought of John, and almost felt guilty, until he remembered where John was and what he was likely doing at that time of the night. The thought left him feeling flat and somehow resentful.
Sherlock grasps him by the shoulders and looks down at him, at the erection straining against his underwear, the light blue material spotted darkly with wetness. “I want to see you,” he says, then does that thing where he glances up at John through his lashes, half hesitant and full something else, something that’s both seductive and charming as hell, and the combination goes straight to John’s knees.
Sherlock is still smiling and shakes his head. “I would rather stay at home with you than go anywhere with anyone else.”
I can’t help it; I’m bizarrely over-fond of watching the way being praised makes his cheeks pink up like that, and I’m rewarded by it again now. He ducks his face but I still catch the ghost of his pleased smile. “I noticed last night,” he says briskly, setting the bags down on the table and rapidly beginning to unpack them.
It initially began as concern, though Sherlock wondered even then if the excuse weren’t a little thin.
“I have no idea what I’m doing,” Sherlock says, the confession low and nonetheless rather alluring. “You’ll have to show me everything.”
true. Looking back, he can see her digs and quips and barbs directed at both Sherlock and at himself with regards to Sherlock. And while Sherlock might not always be the most perceptive about social cues, what he said at the centrepiece workshop yesterday about his skills not all coming from YouTube certainly indicates that he was aware of the sting of Mary’s jabs.
John thinks hard. “Only just after Mary died,” he says, admitting it with reluctance. “I was… drinking too much.”
John’s mouth is still open, stuck mid-sentence. He blinks several times, then must realise, because he closes it abruptly. “You – ” He stops, still holding the box. “You’re wearing glasses,” he says, sounding stunned.
Sherlock holds his eye for a second, then ducks his chin in a quick jerk, acceding.
Sherlock is looking at him awe. “On the contrary, that’s the best we’ve got so far!” he says. “Balance of probability suggests not a newborn; they’re difficult to pry away from their parents and similarly difficult to care for, so a six-year-old does seem the most likely.” He looks at Lestrade. “Is there anything on in East Finchley, anything at all, that might be targeted toward six-year-olds?”
Never mind that, he tells himself crossly. Garlic. Focus, Watson. He dries his hands and sets about the familiar task of peeling the cloves, then chopping them finely. “Onion, too?”
“Something predatory,” Sherlock says flatly, thinking of Paul’s insolent gaze. “He invited us to the steam room, remember?”
John hesitates, then reaches for Sherlock’s left hand and pulls it out of his lap. He turns it palm up, Sherlock watching, hardly breathing, then doesn’t only take it, but slips his fingers between Sherlock’s, their palms pressed together. It feels almost shockingly intimate to Sherlock and for a moment his brains blurs, unable to process anything with all of his sensibilities alert to the fact that John is holding his hand – and holding it in a way that a lover might. If he’s doing this for show, he needn’t have gone so far with it. Just taking his hand would have been enough. But this – with their fingers linked together – Sherlock can hardly breathe, much less speak.
“Fine,” Sherlock says. “A little hungry, actually, but we’ve got the case.”
“You’ve always been the only one for me,” he says, as though making a confession. “I never thought it would happen. Never… tried to bring it about. But it’s very much the truth.”
John leans in and kisses him on the mouth, and realises the instant their lips touch that he was craving this, that he will never stop craving it for as long as he lives. Sherlock tastes like whiskey, only the flavour is softer and sweeter in his mouth, warmer than it was in the glass, and he knows that he must taste the same way. They kiss and kiss, the urgency returning and deepening almost immediately. “Just – here, on the sofa?” John gets out between kisses, already breathy.
I smile at him, aware that I’m a sentimental, romantic idiot, and somehow totally fine with it. “I thought that was my line,” I say, and he just kisses me again without another word. It goes on for rather a long time and I love it, but it’s also causing things to stir south of the border, so after a bit I pull away. “Sofa?” I ask, and he agrees. We go and sit down and I take his hand and then a deep breath. “There’s still so much I don’t know,” I say carefully, not wanting to misstep here.
. “That was – interesting.”
Jodie’s jaw drops. “Andrea? She was his ex?”
So that’s what the nameless minion is for, Sherlock thinks as they turn to move toward Volkov’s room. John is keeping up, but there is every evidence that he is attempting to hide the fact that he’s in pain. Sherlock drops back. “Are you all right?” he asks in concern.
Lestrade frowns at John. “What was
John frowns. “That’s a lot of poisonings and kitchen-related accidents,” he points out. “One actual poisoning, one food poisoning case – which could absolutely be an accident; it happens enough whenever mass amounts of food are being produced – and someone locked in a freezer?”
John’s smile grows and he nods. “Yup. Afraid you’re stuck with me now.”
Since that night, everything has been better. They take cases, usually chosen together, and they generally solve them. John moved back into Baker Street to help repair it and then just never seemed to leave again. They eat together, sometimes cooking, sometimes going out, and after the first week or two, they started playing games again the way they used to, long ago. As for cinema, John has now dedicated the entire Marvel Universe to Sherlock’s study, so it appears they won’t run out of films any time soon.
“Come on, Kevin, stop dawdling,” a man’s voice says, only feet away from them.
Lestrade thanks him and echoes his advice to parents and childcare professionals to keep a close watch, and promises an update when possible. They step down.
“Right. So where exactly have they been seen?” John wants to know.
Sherlock shrugs, not uncrossing his arms. “I’m not in any rush. Have you finished? Do you need the – ?” He nods obliquely at the toilet, and John realises like an idiot that he’s forgotten to piss.
“Well, yes,” Sherlock says. “He’s rather sensitive on the topic of treason and all that.”
“Of course,” the server says, jotting it down. “Something sweet to go with it?”
“Only the duck,” John assures him. “And I might have ordered a bottle of wine. I’ve heard their cocktails are quite good, too.”
This is quiet, almost understated, but John feels the weight of it anyway. “I’m not going anywhere,” he says firmly, and he doesn’t say it exactly, but it’s a promise and somehow he thinks they both know it.
I right in thinking you just don’t do that sort of thing?”
, but she agrees. “Yes,” she says firmly. “Definitely.”
“No, I tried not to let myself think about him,” Sherlock says with difficulty, looking down at their hands. “But I did remember him as a dog, at least until Eurus said…”
Samantha Jones turns a bit nasty in her response to this:
The other cooks nod their agreement. “But that’s why you asked about both meals, isn’t it, sir?” a male cook confirms, and Sherlock nods.
it be okay, for Sherlock’s sake. He needs security, a safe space, even if John detests the clichéd term. Sherlock needs a safe harbour to ride out whatever he’s going through, and John is determined to provide that for him, be that for him. He turns the eggs, shifts the sausages and mushrooms in their pan, and determines that it’s all done. He turns away from the range, his mouth ready to form the question, but Sherlock is there ahead of him, silently holding out two large plates. John relaxes. “Thanks!” he says, taking them. “Did you have a chance to – ”
Sherlock nods. “I thought I’d just carve them both, save us the trouble later on.”
The countryside is fairly lovely, at least, even in the late afternoon of winter. The sky is just beginning to cloud over rather ominously, but the last gleam of the western sun is flooding into the back of the car and lighting the way ahead, not that it sheds any particular light on this peculiar situation for Sherlock. A surreptitious check of his phone map suggests that they’re making for Cirencester, or somewhere close to it. This deduction proves correct as well. John slows as they approach the town, wends his way through its rather pretty streets, lined in honey-coloured Cotswolds stone. He navigates his way to the northern edge of the town, then eventually onto the long drive of a small, stone cottage. There’s a sign on the square stone gatepost. Sherlock bends forward a little to read it. It says
Sherlock does, too, his fingers tightening in John’s. “Do you know,” he says conversationally, “I’ve never been to a Pride event in my life. Care to be my date to the parade tomorrow?”
John gets Rosie’s nappy changed and redresses her in pyjamas in a practised routine. He thinks of how little she must mean to Mary, if Mary was more interested in faking her own death and running off, leaving them both behind for good, or so it seems.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. He nods at the box. “Open it.”
“I didn’t know you did, either,” Sherlock points out.
Sherlock feels a touch of relief; the kitchen has just become rather overwhelmingly full, and he nods, appreciating John’s perception. John takes him by the hand and they carry their drinks over to the dining room table, then take off their coats and find hooks for them in the corridor. They sit down at the table and Kyle and Todd come over and join them.
John shakes his head and rinses his own razor under the tap. “Because it doesn’t work like that,” he says. “Parenthood. You can’t go through it all keeping your kids under lock and key so that nothing can happen to them. First, that alone is a bad thing to have happen to them. Secondly, nothing can guarantee a child’s safety, and thirdly it’s about the parent or parents, too. We have to learn to let go. I don’t mean – I mean, I think there’s a balance. It’s always about balance, isn’t it? All parents get it wrong. Some more than others. Your parents got it wrong. My parents sure as hell got it wrong. And I’m getting it wrong with Rosie, too. But this, I think – yeah. I’ve just got to live with knowing that I’ll always be worried about her. I can’t give in and have her sleep in our bed with us or stifle our sex life by having her in the same room. It’s not healthy. For anyone.”
“Too well,” John agrees. “Do you think it has something to do with the wet t-shirt contest?”
John feels his hackles rise. “Why is that funny? That’s not her full name, but – ”
She’s there within the specified window for pick-up times, but she’s the last one to arrive and feels guilty. “I’m so sorry,” she apologises, stooping to say hello to her goddaughter. “Look at you, all ready to go! Thank you,” she adds, to the two workers who are waiting patiently for her to collect Rosie and go so that they can get home.
“That’s a good motto for life,” Avi says, and Todd agrees.
“Oh, me too,” John assures him. “I’m head over heels, you know. Why do you think I didn’t even miss anything outside of this, of you and me and our home? I’ve had everything I wanted right here.”
“Of course not,” Sherlock says, his voice a bit shorter than he meant. He’s thinking of those months preparing for John’s wedding, his mind a blank, unable to ponder the concept of his life without John at Baker Street, even though it was already happening. “At this point, you can’t possibly know.”
She knows better than to express her shock out loud. “Mary?” Sherlock nods. Ella swallows. “What a tragedy! How did it happen?” she asks.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I was just waiting to put on some eggs. Pour yourself some coffee, if you want. I’ve got plates out by the range.”
“Oi, Steve. Get over here and help me with these potatoes,” Daryl orders Parkins, seemingly having appointed himself in charge of dinner.
“Sir, it’s London, almost everything seems suspicious in one way or another.” Sherlock can’t even argue with him because it’s true. The city calls out to him because there always seems to be something seedy happening. Sherlock gives him his card and tells him to keep a look out just in case. John shakes himself a little bit, he feels like he has been falling asleep standing up. Ridiculous, they have only been out for a few hours. Hell they used to stay up for twenty four hours if a case was particularly grueling. John can’t believe he already feels himself flagging and he just knew Sherlock would be able to tell when he turned around to face him.
“Sorry what?” Sherlock asks.
John has thankfully not asked Sherlock about his conversation with Charlie but he knows that he wants to. It is written all over his face, in the pinch between his eyebrows and the way that he stares at Sherlock even as he continues to eat his fried rice. Sherlock doesn’t necessarily want to talk about it as he finds bringing up the past tedious and unimportant, but this is John and he will not let it rest for long. In a way it will make it easier if he just tells him without being asked since John will be less likely to push him if he is offering up the information voluntarily. He takes a deep breath and forces his leg to stop it’s incessant shaking under the table.
“About time for what?” Sherlock asks, sounding miffed. Mycroft doesn’t bother responding, just runs his eyes between the two of them and smiles before leaving.
“There is a bit more too, the heart is also missing. All the other organs are here but they are mashed up to bits and pieces just like everything else.” John looks extremely uncomfortable, so Sherlock quickly examines the body taking photos with his mobile before grabbing John’s hand and pulling him away from the room of horrors.
“What do you mean? John I am pretty sure that leaving your new wife on what is meant to be your wedding night will surely require more than a quick phone call to patch up.” John looks a little sad and amused at his words. He wishes vehemently he could actually read minds then as everyone assumes he can.
Oh fuck. This is what kissing is supposed to feel like; as if your entire soul is being sucked out of your body. John knew Sherlock would be good at this, the man can literally deduce anything about anyone - including the fact that John really likes it when a someone does… fuck… that!
“What’s the plan then?” John asks because it will be infinitely easier if he has some idea of what is about to come.
“Come on, John. We need to go talk to an emotional traumatized boy.”
“Is he asleep?” Greg whisper asks John.
Sherlock is in the same state, and the last remaining part of his logical mind flies out the door the moment he feels John’s hand wrap about his cock. He is hitting his prostate with every single thrust now and it only takes a not so gentle bit to his neck, and a swipe of his fingers over the slit of his cock, before he is coming.
“I know you really think that and your sense of loyalty is admirable, but this is different John.”
“Hi Charlie, I’m Sherlock you met my friend John earlier.”
Sherlock is having to put an extraordinary amount of control into not smirking because the look on John’s face is awestruck. His eyes are wide, mouth slightly open and the tongue that drives Sherlock wild keeps coming out to lick, and god he wants to rush but that’s not the point here. Last night was rushed because of the lust, tonight he wants it slower, to linger and reveal in it. He slips his belt off slowly making a big production of passing it through each loop. Once it’s off he snaps it loudly and sees the way John’s eyes darken even further. Oh, the doctor might like to spank. Sherlock files that away for another time. His breath is heavy by the time he brings his fingers to his fly. The room is so silent that the sound of the zipper is like a bomb going off. He lets them fall on their own as he slowly makes his way towards the bed not letting his eyes leave John’s even for a moment.
“The missing genitals were a bit of a tip off, in certain parts of the world child abusers have their genitals cut off as punishment. The fact that our killer waits until the victim is dead means that they have some kind of a moral compass, though he does cut up their bodies and derives satisfaction from the act. It takes a lot of patience and motivation to do that, so I had to conclude that whatever the victim had done it had to be heinous.”
“Yes I remember.”
“I don’t know handsome, but if you need me to do some things for you… well let’s just say I wouldn’t charge.” Sherlock wants to laugh, or scream, honestly at this point either seems to be a strong possibility. He can feel the temptation to look over at John and gauge his reaction, but knowing that it probably would just be mild irritation he holds back.
“Well, Greg didn’t hear you come in but of course I did.”
“What’s the point? You must have already figured out everything possible about it, while I was talking to Charlie.”
“Sherlock, don't give me that shit. You haven’t turned on any of the lights, it’s obvious you have been crying, and instead of using the sofa to sulk on like you usually do, you are on the ground. What is wrong?”
“Because he messed up letting Charlie live. We now have a witness who might be able to identify our killer.” John knows that Sherlock is right but something twitches in his gut at the thought of making Charlie look through photos for his mother’s killer.
Sherlock slowly turned around and looked at John, his face was half in darkness half in moonlight. He looked ethereal, beautiful, and just like the miracle that John had begged for in a graveyard.
John feels like he is doing the most embarrassing walk of shame ever and it’s stupid considering that he isn’t a damn college student anymore. It seems as though the entirety of Scotland Yard is shirking their paperwork just to watch them walk to Lestrade’s office. And yeah they're holding fucking hands so sue them. They hadn’t even meant to but it must have happened sometime when they got out the cab. John isn’t even sure who grabbed who’s hand first only that he’s not letting go.
“Because this guy might be a serial killer who has already left three bodies behind and if you don’t want to be the fourth then I suggest…” The guy already has his phone out, navigating to the app. Once he finds what he’s looking for he hands it over to Sherlock.
“Okay,” Charlie says and he looks so tired that John’s heart aches for him. John knows the look in those young eyes; there are nightmares that, no matter how many times you experience them, can still terrify you enough that even the idea of sleeping seems impossible.
“It’s not stupid especially with what I am about to do.” Sherlock stares at him for a minute before nodding at him and letting his head sink back down to the bed. John starts working his way down Sherlock’s body giving a few licks to his cock before moving further down. He licks his balls and plays with them for a bit, then he pushes Sherlock’s legs even further apart and licks right over his perineum.
“Killing people?” Ed sounds genuinely confused and John worries that maybe the whole Mark charade is actually a ploy. But then Ed continues and John has to fight off a shudder. “Oh you mean the child abusers? They aren’t really people, but they do look like them so I can understand how you might be mistaken.”
They say love is pain, well darling, let’s hurt tonight
“Oh no, your girlfriend is pregnant, she just told you a couple months ago. You panicked because you know the sick kind of people out there in the world and with your own experiences, well you weren’t about to let that happen to your child. So you start killing all the registered sex offenders in what a five mile radius from your house?”
“Obviously,” Sherlock intones but he still looks so horrified that John can’t help but feel a bit bad for him.
“That’s why it took you so long,” Sherlock muttered to himself before releasing Mark and turning his full attention back towards John. They walk back to the house, Mark following at a distance of at least five yards. Lestrade and the team are milling about when they get back, and they seem quite annoyed that Sherlock actually went after the wrong guy. John just puts up a hand to stop the complaining and waits until someone directs them to the correct squad car where Ed is currently located. Sherlock slides in next to the guy while John takes a seat in the driver's, turning himself around so he can see into the back.
“I mean come home.”
“You know you are too, right?”
“I don’t think anyone cares about the hand holding,” John finally says.
Sherlock shakes himself out of these thoughts as they pull up to the front of Barts. John is out of the cab and waiting for him on the pavement with his hands clasped behind his back as he pays the driver. They easily fall into step with each other and Sherlock finds his eyes glancing at John trying to check the other’s mental state without being caught. From what he sees John has calmed down, mostly due to the cab ride he imagines. There is still a slight energy to him that seems antsy, and after seeing that body, Sherlock is also feeling rather ready to solve the case as quickly as possible. If only to spare John another crime scene like today.
“I just need you to look at those and let me know if anyone in the pictures looks familiar. Take all the time you need alright?” Charlie nods and gives his full attention to the task. Sherlock steeples his fingers and focuses his entire mind on any cues Charlie might exhibit to the files. John feels hopeful, for the first time since the bloody case started, that they might finally get a solid lead. John tries to keep himself still in his chair so he doesn’t distract Charlie or make him feel rushed. It has to be close to an hour before Charlie has been through every picture.
“John?” Sherlock calls and he shakes himself out of a particular wicked fantasy involving the kitchen table and a set of Sherlock’s scalpels.
“I don’t know, there were cartoons and cereal just like any other morning but then I must have fallen asleep cause when I woke up…” He trails off a rush of tears spilling down his rosy cheeks, sobs beginning to escape. John pulls the boy into his arms wishing he could do something more. Once the sobs have subsided he pulls away and asks Charlie who was with him before he fell back asleep.
John was out one night picking up things at the shops that they were out of when Sherlock texted him.
“Sherlock,” John says as sharply as he can manage. “It’s not him, for Christ's sake, look at him.”
“Why?”
Thankfully as soon as they arrive it seems as though the police are gearing up to head inside, and Lestrade is needed to coordinate. He does find a spare moment to shoot them a very smug grin and John resists the urge to hide himself in Sherlock’s shoulder, which would probably just serve to make Lestrade even more insufferable. John and Sherlock are ‘to stay on the street’ until they bring Mark out, and even as John agrees to this plan he can already tell, from the way Sherlock is bouncing on his toes, they will be moving as soon as the police are out of eye-shot.
John stands next to him gazing out the window for a few moments. His heart is beating out of his chest and he can’t even begin to imagine who in the world could possibly inspire such a love in Sherlock Holmes.
“Goodnight John.”
There is a smile on Sherlock’s face that speaks of so much peace and happiness that it almost stops his heart in his chest. He can’t believe that the guy who will climb up the walls if he hasn’t had a case in four hours, is the same one lying next to him after having mind blowing sex and cuddling. Sherlock bloody Holmes is cuddling, and John really doesn’t have any words for that.
“ – then having you allow me to fully occupy your life in the way I’m asking for feels rather miraculous to me, too,” Sherlock finishes, undaunted by the interruption.
She shakes it. “I’m Sharon. I’m from Charleston.”
two men who live together, damn it. Not that that’s working particularly well at the moment, but that’s their private affair. John turns and moves back toward the car. “Let’s go, then,” he says, quieter.
Molly crossed the lab to her. “Goodbye for now,” she reminded Mary. “You’ll be back.”
“You were squinting at the menu the other day,” Sherlock says, unable to let it go. John opens his mouth to counter this, his brows drawing together, so Sherlock adds, “They suit you. You
Vee pays the taxi driver and gets out, finding herself on the jostling pavement in front of the V&A Museum. Of course Mycroft chose this place, the idiot boy. Nothing less opulent would have sufficed, of course. He’d called back a trifle distantly to inform her that he’d made a reservation for ten in the morning, which is early as the restaurant café opens. She’d agreed and told him she would take a taxi to meet him. She goes inside and follows the host through the pillared room to a table where her son is already waiting.
“Fuck off!”
“Sh – Sher – ” He’s too far gone to speak clearly, so Sherlock reaches down and grasps John’s arse cheeks with both hands. John is panting against his open mouth, thighs flexing against Sherlock’s as he pumps himself into the heat of Sherlock’s body.
He’s half-expecting Sherlock to roll away again, now that the nightmare has faded, but he doesn’t. John lies there in the dark, wide awake, his heart still pounding from the sudden wake-up, waiting for Sherlock to pull away from him. Instead, Sherlock’s tensed muscles relax a little as he shifts back into sleep, pressed up against John closer than John has ever dared hold him, and if it were any other situation, it would be frankly fantastic.
Even if she is there at the flat right now. John refills his glass and drains it abruptly, then creeps down the corridor to listen at Rosie’s door to see whether or not she’s still awake. He doesn’t hear anything and his shoulders sag with relief. He’s almost afraid to go back to sleep, himself. The well dreams are getting even more intense, and this one didn’t come with the side benefit of turning into a sex dream, either.
His arm is around John’s shoulders again, his body warm all along John’s left side where they’re touching. He turns his face and looks into Sherlock’s. “How were you planning to distract me?” he asks, letting his eyes drop to Sherlock’s mouth. He could say aloud that Sherlock is entirely right, that tomorrow they’ll have to figure out what the hell to do about Mary’s statement that she left dozens of kidnappers and/or assassins behind to target Rosie. Not tonight, though. And he doesn’t need to say it, anyway. Sherlock already knows.
“Of course,” Sherlock says. “Is that all?”
“Well, you’d better get on with it,” Mrs Hudson scolds. “It’s only just a couple of months away now! And what about that engagement party. When is that happening? You’ve already been engaged for months!”
John watches him. “Such as?”
Molly had been rather thinking of Indian, but it seems that Mary has already made up her mind. “Sure,” she says, deciding that she doesn’t care. “Do you have a place in mind?”
Stunned silence fills the sitting room. Then: “What?” Sherlock sounds uncertain, and John reaches for his hand. Sherlock lets him have it, his fingers cold. “What are you talking about, Mycroft?”
“No,” he says, rejecting this. “It’s my fault. I should have seen it sooner. Done something about it sooner. But I’m here now, and I swear to God, I am never leaving you again, Sherlock – ”
you – so – please – ”
“You’re not the only one who never said,” Sherlock tells him, his voice more tender than John’s ever heard it. “If I had been a lot wiser a lot sooner, deduced the true nature of my own feelings and found some way to articulate them to you… but I never did, and by the time I knew it for what it was, it was too late.”
John felt his jaw tighten, forehead scowling a little. “Must have paid pretty well, killing for the highest bidder,” he’d said, stowing
“John,” Sherlock says, not reproaching him, exactly, but there’s a restraint there nonetheless and John remembers that he doesn’t actually live here anymore and has no say over who gets to stay and who doesn’t. He gave that up when he left.
This euphemism is meant to summarise the fact that Colin’s right fist has brought out his own erection and is jerking it furiously as Eric plunges himself into Colin’s throat. A soft grunt of released air somewhere down the semi-circle is highly suggestive of the notion that someone has just attained orgasm from watching this. Sherlock is entirely unsurprised; he’s barely holding on, himself. He grips John’s hand even tighter and swallows hard as Eric comes with a shout, slamming himself into Colin’s face, and John grips back just as tightly. When Colin’s spray of release arcs out across the carpeted floor, Sherlock closes his eyes and stops breathing for a moment or two, his thighs rigid with the effort of holding himself together.
It’s very quiet. “Of course,” John says again. He holds a little longer, then gently lets go and shifts back a little, though not too far. “I’ll be right here,” he says again, and it’s a promise.
Sherlock could point out that John has the greater field experience, though possibly not literally – the terrain of Afghanistan and northeastern England aren’t noticeably similar, after all. He doesn’t respond verbally, just crosses the lane and plunges into the ankle-high grasses. “Any idea what these plants are?” he asks mildly.
He’s still thinking about it later as he lies in bed, listening to Rosie making sounds to herself over the baby monitor and willing her to go to sleep. If Sherlock had ever just
Sherlock clears his throat. “Erm, no. He stopped down the street, out of the light, and turned off the car. I knew he was going to kiss me again, and he did. And – it was good. I – yeah.”
Sherlock blinks once or twice, then says, “Perhaps we can get the fireplace going tonight. There are some other things that could be burnt, too.” It’s the best he can offer; just remembering the contents of John’s letter has stirred up things he would rather have left temporarily forgotten.
“You are better,” John reassures him. “You even noticed when I came home.”
code. And I was right that it would be necessarily quick, since we were expected at the dinner party. It actually took place standing up, which was… odd. Not – unenjoyable, just – strange.”
John laughs and comes around the table to hug him. “You don’t remember that, either, do you,” he says, and it’s not a question. His voice is affectionate, though.
“Then count me in, too, please,” Sherlock says quietly, and John looks at him and wants to tackle him to the floor then and there. That, or possibly burst into noisy sobbing.
Sherlock is already texting Mycroft this very question. “Gubnitskaia. And that’s precisely what I’m asking.” He sends the message, then opens the second drawer in search of a spatula.
Sherlock wishes John would turn around so that he could see his face. “What do I know?” he asks.
“A mathematical impossibility,” Sherlock scoffs, but John just laughs and kisses him on the cheek, his arm around Sherlock’s back.
“When did you last eat?” Sherlock asks.
“Good decision.” Sherlock’s phone beeps in his coat pocket. “I hope that’s Mycroft,” he says.
He strokes the messy curls back from Sherlock’s forehead with every last bit of tenderness he’s got. “I love you, too,” he says, no less intensely, then kisses Sherlock slowly and very, very deeply. Somewhere in there, the tightness of Sherlock’s body eases and they begin to move jointly, carefully at first, but then gaining speed. John can feel himself exhaling onto Sherlock’s lips as he moves within him, their eyes locked, and it feels as though Sherlock is looking directly into his soul like this. The heat and pleasure of it build and build, thrumming through him and rising from his balls to flood his entire body. He’s never felt it so hard before, any part of it, never felt it so intensely. He’s rocking against Sherlock, going deeper and harder and faster all the time, and Sherlock doesn’t look away once, his hands gripping John to him. His cock is leaking warmly onto them both, rubbed by John’s belly as he plunges into Sherlock, and after a bit John reaches down between them to stroke Sherlock in time with his thrusts. Sherlock makes an inarticulate sound, his breath coming faster, so John grips him harder and lets himself really go, the pleasure rising so thickly into him that he can’t even breathe anymore. Sherlock gives a sharp cry and then comes hard, lifting off the sheets and thrashing against him as his cock erupts in John’s fist, hot release gushing out onto them both, and John goes wild. He loses it five or six thrusts later, his hips jamming themselves against Sherlock’s arse as his body pumps out his release directly into Sherlock, Sherlock’s body spasming around him and making the pleasure even more intense.
Molly looks apprehensive. “What’s that?” she asks.
Donovan’s lip twists. “My point is, you’re going to have to try not to look like you’re actually under the covers with each other. You know: try not to look too gay while you’re around them. You know half of London already thinks you two are a couple.”
John kisses his fingers again. “You’re absolutely sure you want to do this – now, I mean?”
“Barnes. One more thing.” Sherlock pauses. “I assume that your security cameras are a closed circuit system?”
tell him to send himself to hell. He’s there already, he thinks irritably one day as he waits for Billy to finish fussing with the finer details of the cocktail. A cup of tea: it sounds so much better that way. Just a simple panacea to take off the edge, dear, nothing to worry about.
Sherlock props himself up on one elbow to see the clock on the night table, partially hidden by John’s shoulder. “It’s eleven minutes past seven.”
Sherlock’s shoulder gives a jerky twitch that might be a shrug. “Because I had to leave. Because I didn’t understand that you wanted that in the first place, and then I had to leave. And when I came back, you were with Mary. What was I supposed to say?”
“No, you did the right thing,” Sherlock says. “Don’t speak to anyone else about this. From the start, please.”
“I’m sorry,” John says, feeling idiotically guilty about this. “I don’t mean to keep you waiting. I just – ”
Molly takes a moment to absorb this. “Has he been drinking at all?” she asks right out, not trying to keep the suspicion from her voice.
Sherlock studies his brother for another moment, then turns his head to look at John. “I’m afraid so,” he says. “He must have hired her to administer it.”
“So after you removed the cheesecake at about nine-thirty in the morning, no one else had cause to go near the freezer,” Sherlock says. He looks across the table at John. “There’s our window.” He stands abruptly. “Thank you all for your time. Sorry to have disturbed your lunch.”
Sherlock’s left leg is tucked under himself, his knee leaning on John’s right thigh, and their upper arms are pressed together, and he is hyper aware of every place that they’re touching. He can tangibly feel John’s awareness and anticipation, too, in a new sort of unspoken atmosphere that’s humming with a completely different sort of tension. They watch the rest of the news, then the end of a documentary about caravans in the Sahara, then finally John casually suggests that perhaps it’s time they went to bed. Sherlock’s pulse immediately leaps into his throat. “Yes. All right,” he says, managing not to trip over his own tongue.
He turns and buries his face in John’s hot neck, sucking at a patch of skin and simultaneously reaching down to find John’s erection, touching it at last,
Corey shrugs. “Can’t escape my ‘nice guy’ reputation, I guess. But really, I mean it. He told me how long the two of you have been missing the mark. He told me about those ‘coaching’ sessions to explain how he’d realised that you felt the same way, not to – I don’t know, make me feel bad about it or something. It just makes a lot of sense, and I’m kind of assuming that you’ve sorted it all out now. I’m hoping you have.”
person I’ve really loved. Everything I’ve done for the past several years has been for your sake. I can see in retrospect how so many of my choices have made you feel… unimportant. Left out. Disregarded while I pursued something else. But that’s the truth of it. I never would have told you. I didn’t want to – to burden you with it, as I thought it was entirely one-sided. As for that day at the hospital… I’ve long forgotten it. Forgiven it. Put it down to you going through hell, hell that I helped create.” He hesitates. “We’ve both made mistakes. But you’re not a monster. Just – human.”
I can hear the awe in his voice and it makes my heart clench. I look back over my shoulder and he takes the hint and kisses me as deeply as he can from where he is, and by the end of the kiss I can feel my body relaxing. “Okay,” I breathe. “You can – go!”
Sherlock feels a mild surge of caution, recalling how uncomfortable John became during said discussion. “Oh?” he says carefully.
John kisses his hot face until he’s recovered enough to kiss back. After awhile, John giggles, his old, high-pitched giggle that Sherlock hasn’t heard in ages.
He pushes himself as slowly as he can make himself go into Sherlock, that same grip he felt on his fingers convulsing and shuddering around his cock. It’s the best thing he’s ever felt in his life and he’s biting his lip to keep from losing his load on the spot. He looks down to see Sherlock’s perfect arse stretched around him and moans at the very sight of it. He’s buried to the root now and Sherlock’s back is heaving as he pants against his arms. “You all right?” John gasps out, only just barely holding it together.
Mycroft sounds sulky. “You never wanted to know before.”
Sherlock deduces it instantly and opens his mouth, but John elbows him and he shuts it again, waiting expectantly instead.
John searches his eyes. “I didn’t know what I was doing last night, either,” he points out. “That aside, do you think you might want to?” Sherlock hesitates, so he hastens to add, “I mean – we don’t have to do that at all. There’s no rush on any of this, ever. We don’t need to use that stuff.”
She pats him on the arm. “Never you mind,” she says. “It’s all got sorted now.”
“No,” Sherlock says intently, as we shift onto our sides, arms around each other, faces close together on the same pillow. “Go on with what you were saying. You were going to tell me what you’ve been keeping to yourself.”
Sherlock laughs, and suddenly has a mental image of himself setting down the cup and putting his arms around John to hug him for a long moment. He swallows instead and samples John’s mix. It’s delicious, the bergamot not overbalanced by the gunpowder or the heady smokiness of the lapsang souchong. Impulses like those are dangerous, he reminds himself for perhaps the millionth time.
“It’s fine,” I assure her. “Yeah, she’s tuckered out, but we gave her a pretty thorough clean-up before dinner.”
He risks a look at John and sees John’s mouth open. “But – ” He closes it and swallows, then tries again. “Tell me this,” he says instead, his voice and face as intense as Sherlock has ever seen it. “Why did you shoot Magnussen? Was it really for Mary, after she’d shot you?”
Sherlock studies him. “I rather liked what Andrew said at the workshop. About shared responsibilities. You and I have a shared work, too.”
Sherlock snickers. “Feeling low on protein?”
John watches his reflection nod soberly back at him. He turns and reaches for a tissue, blows his nose, and gives his face a quick wash. Then he squares his shoulders and goes back into the bedroom.
John turns back, his frown genuine this time. He hadn’t realised that the employee knew who he was. “Yeah?”
“Er, hang on.” John checks. “Yeah, actually it
John smiles, more to himself than to Sherlock. “I like being there with you.” He thinks again of the feeling of having been watched and thinks again that this time, he’ll bring the Sig. Just in case.
John slams the door shut with a foot, then kicks off his shoes and yanks the glasses Sherlock’s wearing off his face. “Bedroom,” he says, but the single word is underscored with a world of intention, intention that thrills through Sherlock’s veins like a drug.
Sherlock nods, the movement translating through the pillows, then gets himself out of John’s bed. “See you downstairs, then,” he says quickly. He stoops to collect his pyjama pants from where they were tossed last night, pulling them back on, and makes quickly for the stairs, not looking back.
To be perfectly honest, the last two years have not brought out the best in me. Now that the dust has settled, now that things are quiet again, with me back at Baker Street where I belong, it’s occurred to me more than once that I haven’t said or done nearly enough. To make amends, I mean. It just happens now and then: I’ll be shaving or something and catch my own eye in the mirror and think,
Sherlock feels it in himself to pity her. “She was a masterful manipulator,” he says gently. “None of us saw her as she truly is at first.”
He’s too close, his eyes on Sherlock’s mouth, then flicking almost insolently up to his eyes – or is he imagining it? Sherlock wills himself not to frown. “Thank you,” he says. “I’m sure we’ll be fine. I just needed a bit of space.”
“I don’t care; have it land on the roof if necessary,” Sherlock says, with annoyance. “Just do it! I need everything you have on the disappearance of both the original missing person and the partner who reported it.”
Sherlock’s jaw clenches again. “Give me the address.”
The way he says this makes John think that he wants to check for something rather specific, but he knows better than to ask here. “I could go for a coffee, yeah,” he agrees, at normal volume.
John has already re-opened the
“None at all,” Jodie says easily. “That, and I’m here at least once a month. I’m aware that there have been some pretty tragic deaths. I even knew one of them, the young singer who was poisoned. Not well, but I knew who she was. She once sang at a wedding that I planned.”
“But he’s suffering
John blinks, studying him for a moment, then seems to grasp his difficulty. “I’m not fussy,” he says, rubbing his hand over Sherlock’s bare back. “I want to touch you, or have you touch me, or both. Yeah. Both. But no pressure. It doesn’t have to be – I don’t want you to feel like you’re under a microscope or on an examining table or something. It can just be like this. And we can make it darker, if you want.”
John is sucking Sherlock Holmes cock and the pleasant tingle throughout his body at the thought is addictive. Those talented long fingers are in his ass, and he wants to worship the violin because my god the calluses rubbing against his prostate is the best feeling in the world. Or maybe the second considering he hasn’t had Sherlock’s cock yet.
“Come on, let’s go home. Lestrade can bloody well come over if he wants the more detailed account.”
“John,” Sherlock says and the undercurrent of urgency there feels like a jolt of adrenaline straight into his veins. He has never felt more awake. John follows his gaze without even asking what he’s looking for because he already has an idea. Sure enough, a little way down the road is a convenience store, and in the front window there is a whole shelf of magazines. There’s a man standing browsing through them, which wouldn’t normally be a call for alarm except for the fact that he has scissors in his back pocket and seems to be watching them. John doesn’t even need Sherlock to say anything before they start running. The man has already fled through the back door, but John isn’t worried, not with a living breathing road map running in front of him.
* * * * *
“Yes alright, is it as bad as the last one?” John asks with a wince because the last thing he needs is for Sherlock to say he is losing his nerve. Or worse to start going out without him in an attempt to help.
“Alright. Well I don’t have a lot other than my own instincts to go on, but I think that I have found the connection between our victims.”
The water in the shower is still hot enough to slightly burn when it hits their skin. John smiles because, as annoying as it is having Sherlock deduce him, there are certain perks to it. Sherlock knows things about him such as the perfect placement of a teacup so that he can reach it when working but not knock it over. He knows that John needs the reassurance that he is alive but he never comments on it. In so many ways Sherlock gives him exactly what he needs and he realizes that this is how a relationship should work. That train of thought is depressing in a way because it is obvious, now that he thinks about it, that he has been in a relationship with Sherlock for years.
He reaches between them and takes both their cocks in his rather large hands which causes John to stutter in his movements. His eyes are shut and he is barely breathing. Sherlock squeezes a little too hard and John’s breath hitches as his eyes meet Sherlock’s.
“I’ll have to call Mary tomorrow but let’s not worry about that tonight.”
Mycroft’s face becomes his usual scowl but he seems to see something in John’s face that tells him he will not refrain from tossing him bodily out.
“Does it have to do with why you left early?” Sherlock doesn’t trust his voice at this point so he just nods and waits for John to ask something else.
John isn’t breathing, he is staring at Sherlock and his gaze is so heated it feels as though his skin is on fire. John slowly starts moving closer until he is directly in front of Sherlock, knees pressing into knees. He puts his hands on Sherlock’s legs and looks into his eyes, those cerulean blues even more vivid for the tears that are lingering in the corners. Sherlock doesn’t dare to speak, just sits as still as possible and waits. John seems to be having an internal war with himself and when he leans into Sherlock it startles him so much that he leans away. John looks absolutely devastated as he does and that is when his brain switches back on. Sherlock is more shocked than he has ever been in his life.
“Fuck Sherlock,” John hissed between his teeth but he nodded his head. Sherlock leaned over to reach for his pants and pulled out a small tube of lube. He gestured for John to lean up, he slipped a slicked up finger back behind John’s balls, and slowly circled his hole. He pressed his finger against and let it suck his finger inside, he cast his eyes to John’s face, his eyes were close and he had an expression on his face that if Sherlock didn’t know better seemed as though he was committing all of the sensations to a mind palace. It didn’t take long for John to be ready, he opened his eyes. His pupils were completely blown, he had a slight seen on his skin, and his hair was sticking up. Sherlock thought he was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, a sudden ache in his chest remembering all the lonely nights, thinking about John, about this, but even though he had committed every memory he had of John to his mind palace, it could never compare to having the man in his arms.
Sherlock’s face was covered in tears at this point and he tried to swallow the lump in his throat. “John, stay here.”
“It will be okay Charlie. No matter what, you will get through this.”
“Sherlock, it’s Wednesday, but you should be ecstatic serial killers are like catnip to you.” Sherlock does give a small smile and says, “I am excited but given everything that you are… wait are you saying that I’m like a cat?” John just chuckles as he puts on his coat, then grabs Sherlock’s and his scarf, handing them over before they are out the door and down the stairs hailing a taxi.
“I trust you.” Sherlock punctuates this by leaning down and licking his cock from tip to root. He lets his tongue linger on the bumps and veins. John is feeling a bit like he is Sherlock’s favorite flavored lolly. The thought should make him feel a bit ridiculous but Sherlock’s tongue is pushing at his slit and he doesn’t care about anything else. Sherlock pulls away and opens up the lube. He takes the rather wet cock and slicks it up even more, taking his time to make sure he cover every last inch.  John finally growls at him and pins him down. He claims his mouth and uses his left hand to slowly guide himself inside. The feeling of being fully inside Sherlock Holmes is what John imagines heaven would feel like. He isn’t moving, just letting Sherlock adjust and truly basking in this moment. He wishes they had gotten to this point sooner but they are here now and that is really all that matters.
Ella’s brows had lifted a little at that. “That’s a rather old-fashioned opinion,” she’d said, still mild. “Generally speaking, that’s not how pregnancy works – though of course, a doctor would know that. But in this particular case, I do see your point and agree that it’s a reasonable possibility. The question for you is going to be what you do about it now. You feel what you feel and that’s valid. But what now?”
“It’s – good,” Sherlock says, panting, then realises he needs to say more. “It’s – everything I’ve ever wanted, John – ”
Somehow John understands anyway and backs off a little, sucking hard at Sherlock’s sensitive head, and that does it – his orgasm spills over, flooding John’s mouth, his body jerking, caught in the intensity of the pleasure travelling through his neural pathways like lightning, his breath caught in his throat. He’s powerless to stop it and doesn’t care to try – John is swallowing around him, tongue rubbing over Sherlock’s erupting slit and drinking down what comes as a result of it. And looking down the length of his own body to see John lying between his legs, face in his lap, his mouth full of Sherlock’s still-swollen, flushed-dark penis, is breathtaking in and of itself. It’s not the first time he’s seen this particular sight and he hopes rather devoutly that it won’t be the last, but it’s breathtaking nevertheless. He’s panting, eyes on John’s again, trying to convey silently how much he feels at the moment.
John smiles. “But your way has always been to my benefit. I do know that now, you know. Let’s get shish taouk and shawarma and roast potatoes. And some salads.”
“I understand that,” Ella says firmly. “I really do. But you’ve got to get yourself under control. Come on. Let me drive you to the clinic.”
“Okay.” John turns his attention back to his wall and gets it finished quickly. He caps the paint cans and takes the brushes into the kitchen to rinse off. Sherlock is at the counter, chopping coriander and John sees a pile of diced tomatoes nearby. “What are we having?” he asks.
John stays quiet this time, not wanting to say for a third time that he knows from unfortunate personal experience that it won’t work that way. He’s already said it a bunch of times and knows Sherlock doesn’t want to hear it again. He presses his lips together, wishing he knew what to say.
Sherlock smiles back. “I’m glad you liked it,” he says. He senses that John hasn’t finished yet, and he’s correct.
Sherlock almost smiles, but says, warningly, “Lestrade could call with a case…”
John shakes his head. “I never admitted it, not even to myself. Wouldn’t let myself go near the subject. I just – couldn’t. But in my heart of hearts, I think I knew. I think I’ve always known. I’ve got a question, though: why now? With you, I mean? Why here, of all places?”
Sherlock frowns at the box. “Is that what’s really inside?” he asks Mrs Hudson.
They’re next. Todd says their names and John looks at him and sort of shrugs. Sherlock holds his breath and closes his eyes, and John kisses him very briefly on the lips, moving away again before Sherlock has opened his eyes. He didn’t kiss back, he thinks belatedly, with dismay. He just sat there like a lump and let John kiss him. He feels himself flush, embarrassed by his own ineptitude. He’s just proven to John that he doesn’t even know how to kiss like a proper grown man. He wants to disappear into the loveseat cushions. He doesn’t even notice the last couple’s exchange, and tunes out Todd dismissing them for the break before lunch.
The kitchen doors open then and Phil walks out with Andrea, whose hands seem to be tied behind her back, and Brenda stops them at the kitchen door. “That’s far enough,” she says grimly.
John barely hears this whole last part, his mind still stuck on Sherlock’s revelation about the snipers. He can’t think of a single thing to say, his mind whirling with all of this new information.
Berners Tavern is a newer discovery for us, but we both really like it. It’s furnished in dark wood and gleaming brass trim, with tasteful lighting. It’s like upscale (okay: very upscale) pub food. Sherlock ordered the venison Wellington, but he’s stopped eating, watching me carefully. He looks a bit relieved now and reaches for his wine. “I see,” he says, sipping it. “Is that why you looked so worried?”
“Anything,” John says honestly. “Anything you want is fine by me.”
He’s giving away control, John notices. Not insisting that they do things his way, so that John will feel empowered. It might be psychobabble, but it also happens to be rather effective, if only in that John’s noticed Sherlock’s thoughtfulness again. He swallows and ducks his head for a second, a stupid lump coming into his throat. How did he never notice how considerate Sherlock can be when he wants to? Why did he only ever see or assume the worst in him? “M-maybe I’ll chop the vegetables,” he says, the words coming out a bit strangled-sounding.
They get up and dutifully trot through the queue at the counter, collecting steaks, baked potatoes, garlic bread, and their own salad, plus fresh bottles of beer, then return to the sofa. Everyone else comes and finds a place among the comfortably-aged furniture in the sitting area, eating off their knees. Donovan tried to suggest they sit at the big table, but the idea was quickly shot down.
Mary walks past her, her hands in her coat pockets. She doesn’t take her things off or sit down. Instead, she stops several metres away and turns to face Molly, her face very serious. “I need to die,” she says.
John’s eyes flick minutely from eye to eye, searching Sherlock’s face. “You are so important to me,” he says softly, and Sherlock can feel the weight of each word.
John sighs, too, only harder. “Perfect.”
Sherlock gets into bed and stares in the dark up at the ceiling that separates him from John’s old room directly above. Part of what made the past two years as difficult as they were was the sense of isolation and impermanence that seemed to pervade his existence, the thought that any day could be his last. The terrorists – whichever ones he’d been pursuing at any given moment – could discover him, put an end to him, and no one would ever even know that he had died, or where or how. John grieved his death the first time, to be sure, but to be thought of as dead, to have precisely no one know of his actual death, no one remark upon it, tell stories about him, remember his more sterling qualities, weep over his absence – this notion made him feel as though his life would leave no footprint on the world he would have left behind. He came to realise that he yearned to be witnessed: to have his life seen and felt, his experiences shared, his memories not his alone, but kept safe in the mind of someone almost as familiar to him as he himself. Someone who would know him as John was coming to know him in those last six months before Bart’s Hospital, who could predict him, scold him over repeated offenses that he wasn’t even aware of,
Sherlock nods, keeping the motion as small as possible. “Always,” he says.
John blinks. “For breakfast?”
“In Serbia,” John says, studying him. “You were beaten.”
John nods, too. “Good.” He checks the time again. It’s only just after seven. “Could you sleep a little more? It’s still early.”
That connects: Sarah’s eyes go to his again, riveted there, and for a second or two, she stops chewing. Then she starts again, still quickly, her eyes stuck on Sherlock’s.
They’re rubbing against each other through their underwear now, and it feels so good that Sherlock can hardly breathe, pleasure swimming through his veins in a better high than he’s ever experienced before. John hooks his thumb into the waistband of his underwear and lets it snap lightly against his skin. “Get these off,” he requests, and Sherlock can only make a sound of frantic agreement. They separate briefly to get out of bed and shed the last remaining layer between them, and John opens the drawer of his night table and makes a quick selection. They face each other across the bed for a moment, Sherlock’s eyes devouring John’s gorgeously nude form, the hardness of his penis, gleaming with wetness at the head, and John’s eyes rake down the length of his body, too. “Jesus,” he says, his tone somewhere between incredulity and reverence. “You are so, so beautiful, Sherlock.” He gets back into bed, pushing the blankets aside entirely now. “Come back here.”
Sherlock nods and this hurts, too. “Not the passing out bit, but yes. I was trying to prove a point to my brother about the inadequacy of his security system.”
“Yes,” he says. “Please.”
“Looks good,” Sherlock confirms. He looks at the controls, then selects ‘low’ and puts the lid on, checking the time. “It’s half-past eleven. It should be ready to eat after seven or eight hours.”
Sherlock raises his eyebrows. “I thought the point was to maintain our cover,” he says, sounding somewhat guarded.
“What about – erm – tongues, and such?” Sherlock asks, clearing his throat. “How does one know if or when that should happen?”
on his
His face lights up. “That’s the one!”
It’s the first time they’ve spoken in at least an hour. “I was thinking I’d do something with that chicken breast we’ve got,” John says. “Maybe a stir-fry or something.”
Relieved, I kiss him again. After, I remind myself about the communication thing. It would be easier not to discuss it all in detail, but I want him to be comfortable. “I’d like to try what you did for me last night, at the factory,” I say, very specifically so that he’ll get exactly what I mean, that I want to blow him. “Can I? Is that something you’d like to try?”
Sherlock gives him an odd, half-smile, but doesn’t say anything to this. “Do you want to watch the news?” he asks instead, and John agrees, relieved at the change of subject.
Harry concedes the point, then turns back to John. “He also said that you’re going to be moving into Baker Street again,” Harry says, the statement a challenge.
Inside, it’s even wilder, their kissing practically frantic, an unchecked dam of stuff that’s been held back for way too long now spilling out between them. They’re tearing at each other’s clothes, stopping only as they get distracted by kissing and touching whatever they can get their hands on. They’re swaying together in the middle of the room, half-naked, pelvises pressed together, the sound of gasping breath filling the room. “Come on – get this off,” John pants, attacking Sherlock’s incredible neck with his mouth at the same time, tugging at the waistband of his trousers, and Sherlock nods feverishly, making a sound of assent.
After forty minutes have gone by, John finally breaks the silence. “Can I ask you something?”
Either way, Sherlock doesn’t talk about it. There’s a lot more that could – and maybe should – be said, but it’s also the middle of the night. John loses track of the time and falls asleep again.
Mary catches it, of course. “Yes, silly, of course I care about you, too,” she says impatiently, as though frustrated that Molly would even ask, though she didn’t. She bends forward and kisses Molly thoroughly around the intrusion of her belly, then pulls back and shakes her head. “Now stop this,” she orders. “Stop yanking me around by my chain. It’s not fair. If we’re going to keep being friends, then I need you to stand by me in the way that I need you to right now. I can’t handle drama in my state, and everything else is too precarious. I need to know that I can count on you. Can I?”
The suite is the most luxurious thing John has ever seen, a far,
. And last night, too.” John reaches down and slaps Sherlock’s arse, which he knows Sherlock likes. “Come on. Get up and shower with me.”
Sherlock inhales, too, turning to face him. His eyes skate uncertainly over John’s face. “So – I suppose you’ll – ” He stops, too, maybe also second-guessing whatever he was going to say.
John swallows and nods. “Yup,” he says. “That’s what I said.”
bucked the trend on occasion,” he says, equally lightly, not acknowledging the whole other bit about things being back to normal, that them sharing a bed hasn’t changed everything, that they’re not both still very much aware of the spectre of Sherlock’s trauma hanging over everything like a shadow. “We’ve gone for other cuisines sometimes.”
Aston reads out the number. “I hope that helps,” he says.
“Right, yeah,” John says, a bit stiffly. He’s quiet for a moment, processing internally, then squints at Sherlock. “What do you think?” he asks, his directness rather disarming.
“Oh!” John gets it. Then it sinks in and he finds himself charmed by it: Sherlock’s missing the afterglow. A warm prickle of emotion spreads itself through his chest. “Well, it’s not too late to get some of that back, at least,” he says, going over. Affection for Sherlock swamps him. “Come here,” he says gruffly, and Sherlock steps obediently into his arms, wrapping his own around John’s shoulders and putting his face down on top of John’s head.
“Thank
John looks at him and nods, smiling. “Yeah. Thanks.” He turns back to Margaret and attempts to explain. “I find it really difficult, putting this sort of stuff into words,” he says.
The kitchen staff really have outdone themselves, whole lobsters and carved ice bowls of cocktail prawns, then there’s roasted beef, chicken, and ham, heaping salads, baguettes, Yorkshire puddings, roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, risottos, and nearly every sort of vegetable under the sun. They feast themselves, washing it all down with excellent wine. Kyle announces that the dancing is to start a little while later, and that dessert will be served starting in half an hour.
John looks over at him and shrugs. “As you like.”
“What do you want?” John needs to know this, needs to hear it. He’s down to his pants, yanking off his socks.
Mycroft sighs and looks down at his file. “The substance known as TD-12 was given to several intelligence agencies to test and… use at their own discretion. Because of its controversial nature, it became impossible for our government to carry out its own tests before its very existence had become too controversial to pursue such things. However, it was one of Culverton Smith’s own corporations which developed and produced it. No doubt he had his own supply. Perhaps he wanted people with Mary’s particular skill set to be on hand in the case that a subject refused to take it, or upon whom it didn’t work. I don’t think he need to have worried about that; from what little
“Sure, yeah,” he says, then adds to Mrs Hudson, “See you soonish.”
Kyle nods. “Let’s see how they turned out,” he says, detaching the camera from its apparatus as they leave the bridge and walk over to him. He presses some buttons, then raises his eyebrows. “Oh, those are gorgeous, if I may say so. Wow – look at that beautiful kiss!”
He sniffs, then says, “When I do… those are always the times when I feel like he deserves better, that I’m the last person he should be with. Our landlady… she’s wonderful, but also a bit tactless sometimes, and she’ll just make an offhand reference about how Mary shot Sherlock or something and I’ll just start the downward spiral again, thinking that I was responsible for that, that I was the one who brought Mary into our lives. That sort of thing.”
“No can do that,” Sherlock says, carefully not looking at John. “We all make mistakes.”
“Precisely,” Sherlock says, with satisfaction. “If it’s him, or someone like him, then he may not be working alone, either. Though he would fit the profile of the ‘misunderstood lone white male’ perfectly.”
John hesitates, then gingerly slips his hand into Sherlock’s pocket with far more reluctance than he’s ever shown before and Sherlock immediately regrets having made the offer. Stupid, he chastises himself. Thoughtless. John clears his throat and Sherlock unwittingly echoes him, endeavouring to keep it quiet. An uncomfortable silence returns as John searches for a place for them to eat. “Italian or Indian?” John finally asks.
“However,” Margaret says. She pauses. “Sherlock, I think it’s time you told John what you endured while you were away from England. Some of it, at least. John needs to know this, whether or not he’s expressed a desire to hear it.”
He moves past John and clumsily undresses with his back to him, his fingers slow and heavy with drink, yet he’s also incredibly aware of his body’s less than relaxed state and doesn’t want John to see it. He strips down to his underwear, folds his clothing and leaves them on the windowsill, then gets quickly into the bed. It’s a double bed, not particularly large, pushed up against the wall.
, John.”
He nods again. “Without expecting any sort of… reciprocation. It was just… I don’t know, part of my explanation. But Sherlock said he’d always felt the same way. He wanted me to get up, look at him, but I said I couldn’t even do that much, so he came over and just… held me. It’s not the way I ever wanted this to come about, but it – honestly, it feels like a miracle that it did.”
Lestrade glances at Mycroft, who says, “Well, I was about to propose that we drive up to Sunderland and check on our Russians,” he says.
John hesitates. “What about the case?” he asks. “The one that Lestrade called about…”
Then he opens them again, his eyes gone starry and practically radiant. “I cherish you, Sherlock,” he says, and his sincerity plunges the words so deeply into Sherlock that it’s almost painful.
Sherlock’s pulse is beating visibly, a flush spread down his pale chest. He nods, his lips pressed together, seeming unable to speak.
The phone rings twice and Ella’s receptionist picks up. “New Pathways, this is Shelley speaking,” she says pleasantly.
“No, of course not,” Sherlock says immediately. “I don’t think I ever suggested that.”
“It’s been at least two days,” Sherlock tells him. “I’m shocked by your negligence, in fact.”
There is no response, but I raise a finger, listening, and we hear the faint sounds of a man trying to conceal his position.
Sherlock shrugs. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I’m in vacation mode. I haven’t been making professional-level observations this week. I’m here to work on my relationship with John. I know that as far as the public is concerned, our work would appear to be the central focus of our life, but the fact is that he, himself, is central to my life and being. It was worth taking the time off to work on resolving some of our issues here.”
They eye him, one of them looking unimpressed, the other somewhat alarmed by his nudity. “I don’t hear the water,” the unimpressed one says.
“Did they?” Sherlock echoes. He doesn’t know what to say to this. “Oh.”
“Hell of a weekend to choose to be in Manhattan,” Keith says, rather gruffly. “We’re leaving as soon as this is finished tomorrow.”
going to marry me?”
It takes forever for John’s heart to stop pounding, but eventually the herbal tea works. They sleep.
And yet she’s so clever. It was she who finally said one day over dinner not long before the wedding,
“Come on,” he says. “You can get us a cab. You always were better at getting their attention than I was.”
He looks apologetic. “Sorry,” he says. He’s sitting on the edge of my bed, already dressed, his curls wet. “I knocked, but you were sleeping rather deeply. I didn’t want to wake you, but Lestrade texted to say that the file just came in.”
Sherlock gives a low laugh and slides both hands under them to find John’s trapped erection, and sure enough, John is very hard. They both shift so that John can give him space as Sherlock curls both hands around it and begins to stroke. The resultant position leaves him pressed up against John’s back and arse, his penis fitting directly into the cleft of John’s arse. John moans, then turns over beneath Sherlock and pulls him down to himself.
“There are apples and granola bars, too, and a thermos of water if you’re thirsty,” John tells him, and Sherlock snaps out of his moony reverie.
, John. I need you. I need – ”
Sherlock gasps, and now his arse does tense, clamping around John’s finger. “Oh – that’s – ” He sounds breathless and doesn’t finish the sentence.
He stops, and John does not immediately pick up his sentence and finish it. They keep walking, and John sighs again. “I know,” he says, his voice heavy, and the heaviness scares Sherlock.
For a heartbeat, the entire world seems to stop rotating as Sherlock’s brain attempts to make sense of this. That John planned all of this – a secret getaway to the very sort of romantic little place that Sherlock was dreading – all with the intent of coming here with
John makes himself exhale and aims to keep his voice nice and even. “I wasn’t sure what you wanted, either,” he says cautiously. “I neither want to foist my presence on you if you aren’t wanting it anymore, but I also didn’t – well – want to make you have to ask, in the case that you did. I know – it’s been a bit of an uncertainty for me, too, if you want to know. For me, it’s all about what you feel you might want or need. If you’d like me to go on sleeping downstairs, I’m fine with that. If you think it’s all right now, just – yeah. Say the word.” He specifically avoids making any direct reference to Sherlock’s room or bed, as Sherlock also skirted it, but also deliberately doesn’t mention the fact that Sherlock didn’t have a nightmare for the first time since the crime scene last night, in case it pushes Sherlock toward thinking that he’s fine now, or that John thinks he is.
Sherlock makes a sound of profound agreement. “Did you like it as much as being inside me?” he asks, curious.
The dishes are all but finished, Sherlock and his dad talking quietly in the kitchen. I go in to help put things away and Sherlock smiles at me. “How’s Rosie?” he asks.
Vee gives in. “Have it your way.” She opens her menu, glances at the breakfast options, and closes it again. “I’ll have the eggs benedict.”
“Do you remember any of them?” Sherlock asks, curiously.
John makes a neutral sound, mostly agreeing, but he still sounds a bit glum. He changes the subject. “What do you want to do for dinner?”
“Pretty much, yeah,” John tells her, sounding irritable. “She’d say things like, ‘why
John gazes at him dubiously, obviously tempted. “You sure?” he asks. “She’s overdue for a change.”
I press my cheek into his. “I’m trying,” I say softly. “I swear I am, Sherlock. Sometimes it just – engulfs me, though, and I then I can’t believe that you still want me after all that. I
Sherlock gives a very small smile, his eyes still on the tube as he replaces the lid. “What?”
“God, yes, you’re incredible, Sherlock, you’re phenomenal,” John hears himself babbling through it, talking Sherlock down from his peak as he gasps beneath him, and John kisses his jaw and neck and face, his fingers in Sherlock’s hair again.
nearly killed yourself all in an effort to save me, no thanks to Mary’s rotten advice. God, what a – but more about her later. Right now, it’s our time at last. It’s only about us now. No villains. No distractions. Just us at last.”
A touch of colour appears in Sherlock’s cheeks now and he clears his throat delicately. “That’s what I was going to propose,” he says. “Um. What were you going to suggest?”
Lucas surveys him thoughtfully. “I see,” he says. “Well, based on the little demonstration I just saw, it seems to be working. Thank you for your time.”
“Exactly. And that’s a nice bottle,” John points out.
“What about it?” A rook calls from a tree nearby and Sherlock looks up at it with interest.
John’s eyes are compassionate. “I get that, yeah,” he says. “For what it’s worth, though, I don’t think it’s a mistake to care about people. Even after what you went through. I get it, but I’m glad you’ve started to break out of that, even before you found out what really happened, as you said.”
I’m beet-red in the face, I’m pretty sure, but I clear my throat. “A couple of days ago,” I say. “It’s – new.”
“I doubt we’ll come, but you’ll keep us posted, I’m sure,” John says airily, and Mycroft agrees.
He almost shivers. “True, but everyone is unique. The source and circumstances of the trauma matter, I would assume. And maybe it wasn’t always helpful. Sometimes it might have just helped me hide from it, if we’re being honest. Escapism. I mean – you’re right that I craved it. That it gave me a sense of purpose again, and maybe that bit alone was therapeutic for me. There were probably healthier coping mechanisms, but I’m, er, still figuring those out, myself.”
“There could have been significant drift of each object regardless,” Sherlock points out.
She hasn’t come out and said it, though, said that it’s the same thing with them. Molly opens her mouth to ask, but stops, hesitating over whether or not she should.
Sherlock’s lips press together a little. “Thank you.”
Sherlock pauses. “Yes, I loved this person before that. Before we met her.” He pauses again, then says, “You’re asking the wrong questions, John.”
“Well, I just wanted to introduce myself and see if there’s anything you need.”
“Yes, but that’s not all. The two crates by the couch are even older files. I have put our suspect’s age around 25-30. I am betting that he is a past victim of sexual abuse and we might be able to find his identity in those files.”
“Not what I meant,” John replies and lets that lie while Sherlock reads his face.
“It was partly that… My, you are beginning to pay attention, Dr. Watson.” Sherlock is looking at him full on and holy christ. Sherlock’s collar is of course turned up and the first few buttons of his shirt are undone. The sun coming through the window is reflecting off the mirror above the fireplace and it’s causing an effect that makes Sherlock look like a fallen angel.
“Hello brother, I need a favor. Look into Mary and see who the hell she cheated on John with and then I want you to enact protocol 5.”
John is having a weird day and if it didn’t feel like a walking nightmare he would assume he’s dreaming. The whole thing with Mary and the baby is of course still weighing heavily on him. But even more worrisome is Sherlock who seems to have been replaced with a rather more emotionally receptive individual. He knows he shouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth but Sherlock Holmes does not stop in the middle of a park and give his blogger a bloody cuddle. John can feel his cheeks heating up just from the thought of it. They arrive at Angelo’s a short while later and John has the appetite of a small army. Sherlock watches him eat with an expression on his face that John can’t seem to pinpoint but he knows that he has seen it before.
Angelo already has a table waiting for them, a candle sits in the middle as always. John stopped trying to say that Sherlock isn’t his date because Angelo never listens.
“Oh just some boring serial killer that apparently is causing Lestrade no less than three sleepless nights in a row. You know, just another Tuesday.”
“Sherlock, if you want me to fuck you then I suggest you stop talking.” Sherlock chuckles at that and wishes he could bottle up John’s voice and carry it with him always. John manages to slip two fingers in without any problem, and hears the hitch in Sherlock’s throat as he turns from laughing to gasping.
“Of course I don’t, you can keep it if you like I can always grab another one.” And oh is Sherlock tempted to let him do that, but he doesn’t need to, he has John back and in the flesh now. Sleeping with his pillow because it smells like him while John is in the flat feels a bit creepy. Sherlock walks into his bedroom and grabs the pillow, all but throwing it at John so he’s not tempted to take one last little smell of it. John catches it quite easily giving Sherlock a small smile that just about stops him in his tracks, but Sherlock is determined to act as though everything is normal. He strides into the kitchen, grabbing a travel mug out of the cupboard and setting it on the counter next to John.
John calls their usual while they are still in the cab and thankfully food arrives practically when they do. He manages to make it through the meal and when he stands up to go take a shower he suddenly finds himself against a wall with John leering at him from the front.
“Of course, on one condition.”
They head to Scotland Yard and Sherlock knows John wants to talk, hell at this point even Sherlock can see the benefit in it. But there is simply no time, they need to track down Mark Enlow before the slimy bastard either kills someone else or tries to skip town. Lestrade is pacing the very minuscule space between the walls of his office when they come in and Sherlock has to keep himself from taking out his phone and screaming Mycroft into next week. They might need his assistance unfortunately and he can always do so after this dreadful case is over. Sherlock glances at John and blushes when they lock eyes because John’s already looking at him. Fuck, they can’t be doing this, even the idiots here will notice something.
You came to me and said, “thats enough”
“Are you okay?” John asks, which causes Sherlock to roll his eyes. “Let’s see I have just had mind blowing sex with John Watson, I think that okay is a bit of an understatement. John chuckles, reaches over and pulls him into a hug. Sherlock hesitates for just a moment before he returns the hug with a surprising ferocity. John mutters something indistinguishable.
“I know it’s not ideal but it is our best shot and I'm sure Charlie will want to do what he can to put away the man that killed his mother.”
“I wasn’t just talking about the war,” John says and Sherlock can hear it in his voice as though the words had left his lips. The fall the fall the fall. He spins around to face him so fast they almost crash into each other. John catches himself at the last moment and stares up at him with his worried 'I’ve said too much' look.
After Mary went to sleep that night John took a cab taxi down to 221B Baker street. He was still in shock that Sherlock was alive, for two years he let him grieve, John had completely been broken. It had felt as though someone had killed his better half and left him stumbling in the darkness that was the world.
Their mouths crash together and there is an urgency that wasn’t there before and Sherlock almost cries in triumph when he finally manages to get John’s jacket and shirt off. He runs his hands slowly, reverently down his chest pausing when he hits the below waist area. He lifts his eyes to John who is watching him so intently that Sherlock is almost sure everything running through his head is on display. It is a testament to how far gone he is that he can’t even be bothered to care. Instead he just lifts his eyebrows in question and at the silent nod he begins to unbuckle John’s belt. The snap of leather as Sherlock pulls it out from the belt loops is like a gong going off and suddenly they are tearing at each other's clothes. Removing everything as quickly as possible and yet it still doesn’t seem quick enough. Finally they are both naked and panting with the exertion.
“Will you stay in here tonight?”
“Yeah, but John I can’t give you children, or any semblance of a normal life, or even a home.” John’s heart is breaking just to hear Sherlock think that any of those things actually matter. He tilts that gorgeous head up and smiles.
“Hey Sherlock come...” He is standing next to John before he can even finish the sentence.
“You better not be laughing at my technique,” John says in a husky voice.
“Hmm quite, well now that is taken care of maybe you would like to examine the body.”
“How can I help?” Charlie finally asks after a few minutes and John is impressed at the determination in the boy’s face and the way his voice barely shakes. Sherlock grabs the papers out of John’s laptop bag and passes them over to him.
They end up at a Chinese restaurant a few minutes away from Baker Street. Sherlock, of course, isn’t eating but he knows that John requires regular food breaks otherwise he is completely useless. Well, that might be putting it a bit harshly, but still he needs John at his best and he can think here as well as anywhere else.
Sherlock feels all the blood leave his face, he is shocked and it takes a lot for that to happen. He would have never pegged Mary for a cheater, but he admits he never thought she would shoot him either. John is still staring at the ground and Sherlock can feel a slight pang in his chest that by this point he has come to associate with John, since it only seems to happen when he is around or thinking of him. Sherlock walks over to him and lifts John’s chin up with his hand, he stares into those cobalt blue eyes that are so blinding with their pain that Sherlock feels it all the way to his gut. “What do you need?” Sherlock asks knowing full well that no matter what it is he will make sure that John has it.
“It isn’t bullshit, because of me none of the children in this neighborhood will ever be abused like that. They will grow up having normal childhoods and it might actually give them a half decent chance once they are adults. The way the world is, everyone needs all the help they can get. The problem is that so many of us come into adulthood already aged well beyond our years and as cynical as an undertaker digging his own grave. That’s why the suicide stats are so high; broken people being thrust into a world as broken as ours doesn’t bode very well for their futures.”
“You do realize that you have now guaranteed that your kid won’t have a dad around to make sure nothing like that happens right?” John asks and Sherlock can tell even though his words are harsh, he feels bad for this guy.
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice rasping just a touch, but it’s enough for Sherlock to look up from his phone and give the doctor his full attention. He kneels next to John and waits.
“How long?” John’s voice is wrecked and Sherlock can’t help but look at him. The sight that greets him is enough to break his heart just that little bit more. John has tears streaking down his face and he looks so beaten down in that moment all Sherlock wants to do is hug him. He doubts that would be very comforting in this moment however so he focuses on the question instead.
Oh wow, it's the final chapter. Thank you so much to those of you who have been reading this entire time. Also Mystrade decided they needed a bit more attention than I gave them so be prepared to be hit over the head with that lol. Once again all the gratitude in the world to my beta @SherlockWatson_Holmes.
“Of course I’ll have you John Watson. You don’t even need to ask.” Sherlock says and then he kisses him.
“Sherlock,” John starts to protest, but Sherlock grabs the lube and uses it to slick up John’s cock then he positions John right at his hole. John pushes in, there is hardly any resistance at all and he groans when he manages to be fully inside Sherlock. He is breathing hard and he opens his eyes to look at Sherlock who is looking at him, biting his lip and he has his arm gripping John’s upper arms and he knows he has never seen anything sexier in his entire life. Sherlock apparently gets tired of waiting for John to move, so he slowly sits up careful to not let John slip out. He wraps his arms around him and starts to push him back, John doesn’t even try to fight it. Sherlock is sitting on John’s dick for all of two seconds before he lifts up almost to the point of separation before sinking back down so slowly they both feel every single inch. He does it again and again, by the forth time John is getting testy, he grabs Sherlock hips and starts fucking up into him fast and hard. “Finally,” Sherlock moans, pushing back against John and grabbing his dick.
The music is a haunting melody that is much lighter on the strings than the hammering Sherlock did before, but John almost wishes he would go back to that. This piece feels like glass slipping into his chest and piercing his heart. John can feel something inside his soul trying to rise out of his skin and go to the music. It doesn’t make much sense since he has never been overly invested in music, he can enjoy it but it doesn’t rule his life in any particular way.
“What brings you here, brother dear?”
Sherlock has finally coaxed John’s tongue into his mouth and now is sucking on it in a way that has his cock saluting. John can feel a grin trying to break out on Sherlock’s face and it is so frustrating that someone who claims everything is transport can be so fucking good at making him lose his damn mind.
It is at least a half hour before Sherlock hears those distinct footsteps on the stairs coming back down. “Hey Sherlock, just curious I seem to be missing a pillow. Do you have it?”
“Problem?” He inquires sweetly all while making it his life’s mission to make John incapable of speech. John moans as Sherlock leans his head up and captures one of his nipples between his teeth. He lavishes attention on it as though it is the most important thing in the world and at that moment it is. John is beginning to lose it desperately sliding against Sherlock, and whimpering as though the pleasure pains him as well. In a way Sherlock can understand that.
“The case is over, I just thought you seem rather tired and well, need some help with the shower?” Once again John has surprised him since that wasn’t even something he had considered, and in their free moments on the case he had thought of little other than John.
“Paypal, pretty much anything like this is using it nowadays.”
Sherlock can feel the man beneath him shaking slightly and he’s rather annoyed to find out that the cause is laughter. Sherlock, who of course doesn’t have a grasp on emotions at the best of times, has no idea what could be funny in this situation. He pulls a zip tie out of his back pocket and binds the man’s hands together before rising to his feet bringing the guy with him. They come face to face with a rather young man only in his mid twenties. Sherlock feels the urge to yell, this isn’t their killer.
“Sherlock, what are we doing here?”
They are at their fourth newsstand and John wants nothing more than to sit in his chair at 221B and drink a cuppa. Sherlock even seems to be lagging a bit but he figures that is due to frustration more than anything else.
John awakes to the sound of a violin being played so sharply that it must be close to breaking the strings. He throws on his dressing gown and rushes downstairs as quickly as he can. Sherlock stands in front of the window, blue robe hanging limply off one shoulder, practically sawing at his violin.
“I just, I want you too…” He trails off because he isn’t quite sure how to put it into words. Sherlock must read it on his face though because the eyebrows are almost reaching the hair line and Sherlock’s eyes are so damn wide.
John is in shock; Sherlock Holmes the man married to his work just played a song that sounded both like a love confession as well as a heartbreak. He isn’t sure what to do now, Sherlock hates talking about his feelings. At the same time though, they are best friends and he can’t just ignore that he seems to be in the deepest pit of despair. Fuck, if John hadn’t heard him play this song he probably would have never known. Sherlock keeps everything far too close to the vest. John walks over to Sherlock slow as can be in an effort not to spook him.
Sherlock clears his throat, “We need to put out an APB on Mark Enlow. Charlie recognized him and he does fit the profile of the killer.” Lestrade finally stops pacing and looks at them, he hasn’t slept and his nails are all bitten to the quick, and that is when Sherlock remembers. Mycroft is flying to North Korea to meet with some leaders about certain political alliances. Sherlock grits his teeth, he still isn’t sure how much Lestrade wants John to know, and since he hasn’t heard from Mycroft yet either, there isn’t much he can offer in terms of reassurance. The best he can do is solve this fucking case so maybe the DI can at least take a nap.
The man in question is currently doing the things you are supposed to do in the shower, like rinsing out the shampoo in his hair. His eyes are closed and the water is cascading down his body in perfect rivulets and John can’t help but lick a line from Sherlock’s chest up to his mouth. Sherlock’s breath hitches and it is like a switch has been thrown, suddenly John is pressed against the shower wall, Sherlock’s eyes blazing as they stare at him. It seems that there must still be a lingering expression of the thoughts about their relationships because his face softens just a bit.
Oh I know this love is pain
“What?” John asks a now naked Sherlock.
I have to say thanks again to my wonderful beta @SherlockWatson_Holmes.
“Next time, but right now I would rather just have your cock.” John panics, he feels a tightening in his balls and has to wrap his fingers at the very base of his cock to stave off an orgasm. He opens his eyes after a few deep breaths, to find Sherlock leaning up on his elbows and smirking at him like the cat that got the cream.
Sherlock is hanging from the ceiling by his wrists and has spent the last hour trying to think of a way to use his weight to snap the rope. Nothing he has come up with will work though and he can barely even feel his wrists at this point. The man Ian who strung him up is one of those sick sadists that get off on torture. Sherlock knows he needs to get out of here before he gets back but apparently the bastard was a boy scout because his knots are impeccable. A sudden creak fills the space and Sherlock feels the hair on his exposed arms raise. He can’t even remember when they took off his shirt. Ian appears carrying what looks like a cow whip and Sherlock feels a moment of panic before forcing the emotion down. He wants to mouth off but that’s exactly what he expects. He decides to stay quiet and look as uninterested as possible. He starts delving into his mind palace looking for somewhere interesting enough to keep himself occupied. He already knows where he’s going before he gets there. The John wing is easily the biggest place and even the most minute detail about him is fascinating. He is locked into the replay of their first meeting when the lash makes contact with his flesh. He chants John’s name the entire time but not for the reason that Ian probably thinks. If only he hadn’t been such an idiot that first night… everything might have turned out differently.
This chapter was the first one I found really difficult. So thank you to my beta from keeping me from losing my mind @SherlockWatson_Holmes
“So what did you figure out?” John asks Sherlock as he lifts pasta to his mouth.
“Yes, well, that’s Mycroft’s line not mine. Maybe I bought into that for a long time but not anymore. John, you make me stronger. I couldn’t do any of this without you.” John can feel the tears threatening to well up in his eyes, because this keeps sounding more and more like a love confession. Sherlock brushes his fingers against John’s cheeks and he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is desperately in love with this man. He doesn’t say it though, only because he would rather show it.
“It’s short for Edward, I just go by Ed in most circles.”
“That isn’t your fault, you saw something awful that day and your mind was trying to protect you from it. We need your help Charlie, we are trying to find the man who killed your mother.” Sherlock pauses letting the boy process that and John can’t help but marvel at the patience that Sherlock exhibits sometimes. This is the same man who will shoot the wall up at the flat just because he’s bored, and yet here he is.
“Actually, you presume wrong Dr. Watson. Your partner took off after Mark, name’s Ed.” The man on the ground looks smug for someone practically kissing the gravel. John suddenly feels the anxious pit in his stomach rear up so fast it takes an enormous effort to keep down his breakfast.
“You still have my number right?” Sherlock asks and Charlie nods. “You call it no matter what time it is if you need help okay?”
“Why? Because of the whole ‘caring is not an advantage thing?’”
Sherlock seems to freeze for a minute before he responds, “Yes, Charlie. I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you the truth, but I didn’t want to add to your stress that day.”
John’s not breathing, he stopped when Sherlock snapped the belt. He can just imagine being spread out over the man’s lap naked from the waist down. He never likes to admit it but there is a small part of him that aches to relinquish control and just to let someone do with him as they will. But he has never trusted anyone enough at least not until now, and damn, it’s suddenly all he wants. He snaps back to the present and Sherlock is moving towards him, a fire burning in his eyes. John can feel flames on his skin and he has never in his life felt this alive. When Sherlock reaches him, his hands immediately go to the bottom of John’s jumper to pull it off. John’s hands catch his and Sherlock looks at him confused.
Sherlock is jerked back from the memory by the sounds of footsteps on the stairs, he doesn’t even have the energy to stand at this point. He knows it isn’t Mrs. Hudson and if he didn’t know better he would swear it’s…
Sherlock didn’t say anything to that instead he picked up his violin and continued the song from earlier, except this time he stood facing John. He stared into his eyes as he sang.
Oh I know you’re feeling insane Tell me something that I can explain, oh.
“Are you serious?”
“Why don’t you do that for your nightmares?” Sherlock asks.
“Who hired you?” Sherlock asks not wanting to waste any more time on this idiot than they already have. The guy pushes blonde hair - bleached in his sisters sink obviously - out of his eyes and has the fucking gall to leer at Sherlock.
“Sherlock, I can assure you there is nothing you can do or say that would chase me away.”
“John, come on.” Sherlock demands. And yes, John is ready to stop the teasing now too, so he reaches for a condom and the bottle lube, surprised by the sudden grab of a hand on his wrist.
John had slowly been walking to Sherlock as he sang and when he finished the last verse, John gently took the violin, set in safely in its case before turning back to Sherlock. “Just for tonight,” John warned before he crushed Sherlock in his arms, it was at this moment that John Watson finally started sobbing.
Thanks again to my wonderful beta @SherlockWatson_Holmes.
John wakes up when the sunlight hits his pillow. He blinks and glances around in confusion fully expecting to see Sherlock leaning against the door frame waiting for him. John’s alone though and he groans as he stretches. Once he makes it out of bed, he tries to rush through his morning routine as quickly as he can, he doesn’t know if his urgency to see Sherlock is due to fear or the rather interesting dream he had about him the night before. He doesn’t even let himself indulge the after effects of the dream, he just wants to see Sherlock. He makes it downstairs and he barely even has to glance around to realise that Sherlock isn’t in the flat. He makes his way over to the kettle and spots a note on the counter.
“JOHN,” Sherlock screams causing John to feel at parts proud but also worried Mrs. Hudson might think they are in trouble and try to come up.
“I want to see you,” Sherlock says. John nods understanding immediately. He begins to move again, fucking Sherlock’s hand and still shuddering as their cocks slide together inside the tight heat of his grip. Sherlock is so turned on that he thinks he might just faint from want. Or at least he would if he weren’t already laying down on the ground.
Sherlock felt his entire being seize up when John spoke to him. He hadn’t slept the night before, and of course he exhausted any possible leads for the case that they could spend time following up on today. So for the last two hours he has let his mind wander and as it usually does it settled on John. His mind raced as he went to the wing of his mind palace where John lived and the memories of the wedding were there waiting for him. He is not sure why his mind palace seemed to want him to relive quite easily the most painful day of his life. He sees himself laying the music he composed for the happy couple on the stand before bundling up and slipping out. That is what put him in a darker spell he supposed, because the night before the wedding he had been composing music and had written a song that he knew he would never play. A song that sounds exactly like every single thought and feeling he has ever had for John Watson. So why the hell are his hands playing that song when he knows John is in the room. He would stop if his body still responded to commands but he grinds his teeth and plays it out. The silence that resounds throughout the flat afterwards is deafening.
“Agreed. Having you there would definitely be preferable,” Sherlock says. He nods at Rosie. “Bring her down with you. The nappy bag is still packed. We’ll just… ask very, very nicely.”
John pauses, choosing his words carefully. How honest should he risk being? Linda is a nice person, even if he has no intention of marrying her, and she’s just been rather dangerously forthcoming with him. “Honestly, I’m here on business,” he says, truthfully enough. “But being here has rather solidified some things that I didn’t have a strong opinion about before I came. I’m glad for that. But my views obviously wouldn’t be welcome, so I’d rather not say too much about that.”
He dozes off in the cab, but he must have given the correct address, because the next thing he knows, the driver is telling him loudly that they’ve arrived. Sherlock hands him a card, some card, waits to have it back, then manages to get himself inside the clinic without falling down.
John sits down, too, his back against the left post of the stone bridge. “I’m utter shit at putting any of this into words,” he says, his voice still strained. “I’m trying, Sherlock. I swear I am. It’s just – hard.”
They finish undressing hastily, not taking their eyes from each other, then pull each other back into one another’s arms, touching everywhere now, and Sherlock can hardly breathe. The sheer intimacy of it is almost too much stimulation to handle, every nerve ending firing simultaneously, his mouth and hands as occupied as his brain. They stumble over to the bed somehow and fall into it, shoving the blankets aside, John on top of him, and Sherlock finds himself harder than he even knew he could be, his penis harder than steel and flushed darkly, rubbing directly against John’s, pleasure shivering through every part of his body but specifically concentrated there. John is thrusting against him, moaning softly, the muscles of his arse flexing and releasing under Sherlock’s hands. “… more, please…” he breathes, like a prayer, and John makes a sound of pained acquiescence and moves faster, harder.
Sherlock takes himself in hand and strokes all of four times, hard and so fast it’s as though his fist is spasming and then his head falls back and he comes, the spurt arcing up between them and landing on John’s chest, and its liquid heat – and Sherlock’s body clenching around him in his climax pushes him hard over the edge. He’s suspended, sailing through the air, his body streaming light, flooding Sherlock’s body with wet heat, his skin prickling all over. He isn’t breathing, his mouth open, eyes closed as the glory of it grips him like a storm thundering through his frame.
Sherlock seems mostly satisfied by this. “Right,” he says. “So it starts with an orientation this afternoon in Hall A. It doesn’t look like we’re going to have all that much time to confer between sessions, but we can make our own observations and share them – ” He stops abruptly as a knock comes at John’s door. He looks at John, the crease at the bridge of his nose appearing. “Are you expecting someone?”
“Or you could just wear your glasses,” Sherlock suggests, trying very hard to keep his tone light and casual. “No point in straining your eyes.”
. They’re planning their wedding – a wedding they both wanted so much that they each proposed and accidentally bought each other the same ring. What could have changed to make John doubt this, make him stop wanting it? Has he become paranoid? Is this some sort of self-sabotage that he’s subconsciously attempting to wreak upon their relationship? If nothing is going on, then why is he so intent on feeling a slight drift between them? He attempts to keep the frown off his face as Mrs Hudson chatters to John about the wedding, the two of them seemingly having accepted that he has withdrawn from the conversation. He makes himself tune back in, not wanting to miss out on whatever John is talking about.
John breaks off the kiss, panting, his breath hot on Sherlock’s lips. His fingers are slipping the buttons out of Sherlock’s shirt with dextrous ease, working downward, and when he reaches the waistband of Sherlock’s trousers, he looks back up into his eyes and kisses him again, a hard suck at his lips as he unbuttons Sherlock and unzips him, a hand slipping down to cup him in his underwear, and Sherlock’s oxygen punches out of his lungs with force.
“If you like,” Sherlock responds, thinking again that this feels like something he would have utterly scorned once, this incredibly banal, trivial, day-to-day life. Something that other people have. Not someone like him. Perhaps a large part of that was merely the bias of exclusion, he sees now. There is nothing banal about this, about the simplicity of making lunch with John. Lunch with John – all of it, just day-to-day life with John – is a reason to get up in the morning, a reason to live. Just stringing out one simple, beautiful moment after another as the days unfold, each day culminating in being permitted to go back to bed with John again. And then again the next day and night, then the one after that, ad infinitum. It’s the best thing he never conceived of having, something he never would have allowed himself to dream of, and he loves it so much it almost frightens him. There are times when he lies awake, John having fallen asleep before him, and revels in listening to him breathe, in the feel of his warm, compact, intimately familiar and beloved form in his arms or pressed up behind him and doesn’t even want to sleep for fear of missing out on any of it. They’ve begun showering together, too, ever since the morning after the bomb, learning jointly how to play within the circle of their intimacy, how to just be together in it without it necessarily becoming sexual, though it does more often than not. They’ve shaved one another’s faces, worn each other’s underwear and deodorant, eaten breakfast together nude on the floor of the sitting room or in bed, typed emails half in each other’s laps. All of the usual, mundane parts of daily life, only elevated into something unimaginably wonderful through the lens of
“Can’t have you getting burned,” Sherlock says, all but purring into John’s ear. His hands are beneath the apron, squeezing John’s delectable arse. “Now I see why you’re always staring at my posterior whenever I wear this apron, for the record.”
Sherlock follows him dutifully upstairs and looks around. Nothing looks any different, at any rate, but then he was also right here in the sitting room right up until when they left. He turns to John, the unspoken question on his lips.
Sherlock makes a sound to show that he heard, then adds, “Go ahead. I’ll be there in a bit.”
“No,” John says instantly. “He’s – gone to bed, I think. He’s probably in a good bit of pain. He seemed to want to be left alone.”
“This isn’t really me,” John says, looking at him now. His eyes are pleading to be understood. “I don’t think this of you. I don’t feel this way. You never failed me. I mean that, Sherlock. I – I wasn’t in my right mind, and I was almost certainly incredibly drunk when I wrote this. I’m terribly sorry. I’m saying it now: not a word of it is true, all right? Not one bloody word!”
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock sounds guilty. “The nightmare… was that – Bart’s?”
“I know,” John interrupts gently, quickly. “I know, Sherlock. I believe you. I’m sorry. I still can’t believe I actually said that shitty thing last night.”
“The police are on their way,” Sherlock informs Andrea, almost pleasantly.
John debates saying something, trying to decide on what, but his heart rate is still elevated, still angry, and he also doesn’t particularly want to take it back. Posing for this cover story is one thing, but that was a step too far, damn it.
John intervenes hastily. “Can we drop it?” he asks, glaring at his sister as he scoops cheesy cauliflower out of its casserole dish. “Sherlock doesn’t quiz you about whoever
This is verging on cruelty. Sherlock looks away and nods. “It’s – quite lovely,” he says, the words sticking in his throat. “Am I permitted to ask who’s to be joining you here, or – what am I doing here, precisely?”
, John hears, as though he still lives here. He wishes that he did, but it’s too late for that. That ship has sailed. He’s made his bed: he got engaged to Mary, saw it through despite knowing that somewhere not that far below the surface, what he really wanted was Baker Street and Sherlock. But he was angry that Sherlock had done that to him, let him grieve the way he had for so long, as though John hadn’t even mattered enough to bother telling that he was still alive, and so he’d gone through with it and married Mary. And that was a disaster. The entire thing was a mistake from start to finish. And meanwhile, the grief has never entirely healed, just – changed. Deepened into bitterness and resentment that no amount of surface forgiveness can seemingly manage to actually forgive and let go of. He clears his throat. “Sure, yeah. We can paint the ceiling,” he says, and if he sounds gruff, Sherlock doesn’t comment on it.
“Nonsense. Just look after than man of ours, and get everything straightened out there. Good luck,” Mrs Hudson adds, and John gets himself out of her flat and back upstairs.
“John – please!” Sherlock hears himself, nearly begging. “Would you just – look at me?”
That must not have been very convincing, because he pauses. “Are you sure?” he asks, his eyes fixed on mine, their blue somewhat piercing.
Norman, to my surprise, begins to cry.
“Agreed,” Sherlock pants, helpless under the machinations of John’s talented mouth, the grazing of his teeth on Sherlock’s jaw. His fingers are already working at John’s jeans, his mouth watering at the hardness pushing against the zip and making it difficult to work down, but he manages even as John strips him from the waist down in a few, efficient motions.
Marjorie looks at him with frank admiration. “My best friend Lila was right – I
“Oh,” Sherlock says, looking toward the laundry bin, and John spots the issue: there’s a bath towel lying on top, neatly folded, but it’s out of reach. It wouldn’t have been an issue if John weren’t there, but he is.
John’s confusion deepens. “Of course,” he says, and raises his book again, as though the matter has been entirely settled.
Beside him, Sherlock is unmoving and specifically non-reactive, and John wonders what he’s thinking. Does he know, actively, that he’s gay, then? If so, does he feel targeted by this? Like he’s just been sent into the snake pit as fresh meat? Or… is he not gay, as such? Is he just – not anything, with regards to all that? John searches his brain for the right term: asexual. Is he that, then? Or does he not even know? Is it just something he doesn’t think about, at all? God, he wishes he knew all this stuff. He’s been actively wondering for years. From the very start. He chances a look at Sherlock and sees that a muscle over his jaw is twitching, almost invisibly, but John catches it. He’s tense. John doesn’t know why, but it feels reassuring, somehow.
Sherlock’s intake of breath is sharp. “John – ”
“The desk officer?” John asks, guessing correctly.
you attracted to Corey, then?” he asks, feeling at the same time that it’s still odd to be referring to one of the most famous actors in Hollywood strictly by his first name.
John glances at him, seems to debate saying something, but decides against it. They dress themselves in silence. John waits until Sherlock is fully clad before squaring his shoulders and rattling the doorknob. To his surprise, it isn’t locked. He opens it without looking back at Sherlock and strides out into the main room, evidently heading for the bathroom, his toothbrush in hand.
“I’m a physician,” John says. “That’s my primary occupation. But when time permits, I do occasionally assist Sherlock with his cases, yes.”
Mycroft gets up and walks away from the desk, hands on his hips, then stops and turns to face Watson. “Since my brother’s return, you have actively denied him your friendship, married a woman who would later shoot him in the heart, then went back to said woman. Sherlock shot a man specifically to spare
I smile back at him. “Just.” I reach for him and he doesn’t deny me, letting me have his mouth. It’s so natural, somehow, like we’ve done this thousands of times before in some other lifetime or parallel reality, but it’s also still radiating its own newness and excitement. This is only the second time we’ve woken up together, the second night we’ve spent together. I think briefly of our conversation last night and in retrospect it does seem quick, that we’re already talking about penetrative sex. Then again, our hunger for each other is unquestioned. I just don’t want to do anything that will make him feel unsure of himself, or worried in any way. I know this is huge for him and he just keeps going there, into the unknown and unexplored, into this area that he knows so little about and is so unsure of himself in, for me. For me, and because he wants me as much as I want him, even if he doesn’t know exactly how to get there. But he keeps prompting it, asking for it, making the first move. (God, he’s fantastic. How was I so stupid for so long?)
