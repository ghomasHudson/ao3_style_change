“Well,” he looked into the distance, as if trying to visualize his dream, “it was vague, but you were lost. I didn’t know why, but I tried to find you, and couldn’t. I think I had Rosie, because you were gone for a long time. That’s all I remember, though.”
Mrs. Hudson shook her head and left, and John heard her leave the flat and shut the door behind her.
“It’s really no trouble,” she waved her hand. “I would have written on the large cake, too, but ‘Rosamund’ is a little long to write out, and my hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, dear.”
But then Sherlock started to cry apologies again, so John held him closer and told him, “It’ll be all right, just don’t fucking do it again.” It seriously didn’t feel right, holding Sherlock like this when he was high as a kite. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. “I need you to breathe slowly and deeply for me,” John told him. “You’re putting a dangerous amount of strain on your body.” His priority would always be Sherlock’s health, no matter how much his mind was struggling to process everything. The Sherlock in his arms now desperately needed his attention, but he couldn’t help but think of the other Sherlock, who never got to confess these things to John, who bore the brunt of his rage without question. John missed him.
“I’m sorry,” John whispered to Sherlock, holding him. “I’m so sorry. I should’ve known she wouldn’t let this go.”
“I just can’t believe it’s been a year,” Mrs. Hudson shook her head. “I’ll make her cake next year, too.”
Sherlock stared at him blankly for a second before snorting and laughing suddenly, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “You’re stupid,” he giggled.
Maybe just a little touch. Shifting his weight and lifting up, his moved one of his hands from the sofa cushion to Sherlock’s chest, hand brushing over where he estimated his nipple to be as John started kissing his jaw again. Through the silky material of his dress shirt, John felt it when one of his thumbs ran over a hardened nipple.
It felt good to have John across from him again. “Unfortunately, no,” he said. “I would have told you if there was a case.”
, Sherlock was alive. He defied death again, and John wondered how the hell he got so lucky to have a second chance at everything, including Sherlock surviving a bullet twice. John didn’t know how he did it, but Sherlock really never let him down. John sniffed, wiping his eyes, making himself breathe slowly to get his pulse under control. He went to sigh, but it turned into a yawn. Being woken up at 4:37 in the morning and nearly having a nervous breakdown because his best friend was almost murdered had worn him out, but he couldn’t sleep. He wouldn’t leave Sherlock’s side, but he feared Mary would somehow know Sherlock pulled through, and would come back to finish the job. He didn’t know if he were just being paranoid, but he wouldn’t take any chances.
Narrowing his eyes with as much venom as he could muster in his current state, Sherlock said, “She’s my equal, yes. My intellectual match. Yes, she also used me. However, I knew there was sentiment behind her motives, as well. I saved her because it was the right thing to do. Isn’t that what you’re always going on about?”
He sighed, shifting so his head was on Sherlock’s pillow so they could look at each other. His eyes were bright with tears from a couple minutes ago, but neither would mention that. “What about her?”
John looked tired, the lines around his eyes more pronounced and his stance somewhat strained, indicating back pain, like he didn’t sleep well after he woke up with Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered shut at the touch, and a deep hum came from his throat. God, he was so tired.
But John slowly shifted closer to him, heart beating so hard his chest hurt. His heart was pounding, stomach rolling, blood boiling over how unkindly the universe had treated Sherlock thus far (and he felt angry for the child who had his life taken from him by some drunk twat). It was a horribly unfair situation. John kept his hands to himself, but was close enough to Sherlock so their bent knees were touching.
She must have figured she had nothing to worry about, if she got John back after attempting to murder his best friend. A part of John thought that, well, she was kind of right to think that. If he went back to her after committing that type of crime, then was she really that arrogant for thinking he would never leave her? Maybe she did know him better than he thought, after all, thinking back to when he felt angry over her presumptuous tone in her posthumous DVDs.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered close, the feather-light feel of John's fingers on his cheek sweeter than he could have ever imagined.
Sherlock took it and unscrewed the cap, drinking it quickly. Drinking was something to do other than crying. The water did feel nice, though.
John tilted his head up and kissed Sherlock’s jaw. “I think I’m starting to feel a little better. I feels like the end of a nightmare, finally. All that’s left is signing divorce papers. And getting the rest of my stuff from her house.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure if he ever heard John use that tone of voice with him before. “Remembered what?”
“You said you’d been ‘compromised’, and that’s why you didn’t notice me not reacting to Irene being alive. What did you mean?”
However, Sherlock was in the wrong here. He was the one who went into their house without permission and completely invaded their privacy. He owed John a talk, if he wanted it. It would be painful, though. But he would do it.
Sherlock did as he was told, and the blankets fell down to his lap, his bare lower back visible. He offered his damp, drooping mop to John.
Those acts were so simple that Sherlock almost felt embarrassed to admit he loved doing that. “Yes.”
“It’s temporary,” Sherlock muttered. He wasn’t deluding himself, especially after the anger in John’s previous email.
he thought. It was the day after what would have been the bonfire incident, when he visited Baker Street without being assaulted and found Sherlock’s parents casually sitting on the sofa. He figured he would leave Sherlock to it, and remembered that when he did eventually talk to them again, he would have to act like he didn’t know them. This timeline was fucking odd.
“But you wouldn’t be,” Sherlock frowned, sitting up straighter in his chair. He sounded troubled. “You’ll be going on cases with me again.”
John raised his eyebrows. “I’m not giving up on anything. I’m just not going to force you to do something you don’t want.”
John looked exasperated. "If he doesn't come forward soon, like in a few days, then I might take action."
“How did you know?” he grilled into John, his eyes alarmingly sharp for someone minutes away from succumbing to morphine.
John looked unhappy, to say the least. Somehow the bags under his eyes seemed more pronounced, and the lines in his face were deeper than they had been just a few hours ago.
John sighed, putting his hand back on top of Sherlock’s. He was puzzled that Sherlock didn’t try to warn John of Mary last time, but he remembered the elaborate stunt Sherlock pulled when telling him--escaping his hospital bed and putting the bottle of Clair-de-lune on the table at Baker Street. He hadn’t told John directly. Perhaps it was because Sherlock knew the news would upset John, but this time, he wasn’t married to Mary; he wasn’t even with her. Maybe he didn’t think Mary was going to go after John last time precisely because they were married, and she wanted to keep her past a secret and continue their marriage. But, he said “Mary” last time, too. Was he frightened of her last time? Did he only hold it back because of John’s marriage?
Sherlock walked with John to his bedroom in a haze, his erection softening a little from a sudden wave of uncertainty. He wanted to have sex, but it was no secret that no one ever touched him before, and he never touched anyone intimately. Janine had wanted to have sex with him, but he couldn’t. He didn’t love her, and, of course, he was gay. He wouldn’t have been able to get it up if he tried.
Sherlock nodded, swallowing, his Adam’s apple bobbing in his long throat. “Yes, yes, fine.” His eyes darted down to the blankets around John’s crotch. “Do you...need assistance?” he asked, but it came out forced, and nervous, and all around wrong.
John was groggy and he felt hot, rhythmic breaths puffing onto the crook of his neck and a bit of his shoulder. He was too tired to really think much of it for a minute, and there was a comforting pressure on his chest, so he fell back into a doze. But, the breaths persisted and started to give him gooseflesh. John crinkled his brow and whined. He yawned, mouth dry from sleep. His other senses sluggishly kicked in, and he heard a soft, low noise, almost like a vibration. John turned his head, and his mouth met soft, messy hair. He frowned because the hair tickled his lips, and feeling that he was sitting (well, kind of slumped, but whatever) upright, he concluded he must have been on the sofa, and it must have been Sherlock’s curls on his face. John opened his eyes and looked down, but saw nothing but hair, and it clicked that the low sound he heard was Sherlock snoring into his skin and T-shirt.
“No one asked for your opinion,” Sherlock sighed dramatically, “or for you to come here. You ruin every room you walk into.”
John had to go to him. He walked to him, stumbling once, not thinking about Mary sitting alone at the table for a single moment. Sherlock stood there in the middle of the room, and neither cared about the customers or waitstaff. He stopped in front of Sherlock, biting his lip hard, desperately trying to keep his breathing under control.
Sherlock knew Lestrade would ask why, but he wasn’t up for it, so he put his phone on the coffee table and wobbled over to his bedroom. He didn’t want to talk to anyone right now. He sat on the edge of his bed, heart still racing, and clenched his fingers tightly in the duvet.
Sherlock lifted his head and pressed his warm lips against John’s cheek. His lips trailed to John’s mouth, and they started kissing in earnest again. His lips were insistent, but the breaths from his nose were shallow.
“Only because I thought John would be happy if he stayed married to you,” he explained coolly. “You tried to kill me. You nearly succeeded.” She would have, if Sherlock hadn’t clawed his way back to life for John.
John had his kit under his arm, and a glass of water and a couple acetaminophen pills in his hands. He sat down next to him on the side of the bed. “Take these.”
Sherlock came back in and lit the one candle, and put the lighter next to the sink. “Do we have to sing?” he asked with a small grimace.
Instead, the tension in John’s muscles visibly disappeared, almost like he had been a puppet and someone finally cut his strings, his knees almost buckling. He took three unsteady steps towards Sherlock and firmly wrapped his arms around him, warm hand on his neck and his other arm wrapped around his back.
“No, I’m fine,” Sherlock denied with a grumble, standing upright. He wasn’t looking at her. “Would you give me and John a moment of privacy?”
“No,” John cut him off immediately. “No, you’re not. You’re so fucking not. Do I make you feel that way?”
Then they were kissing again, neither sure who initiated it. Their lips were pressed together firmly, and the butterflies in Sherlock’s stomach fluttered happily. John’s lips moved slowly against his, sensually, and Sherlock caught on that he should move his lips, too. As soon as he started to move his lips with John’s, the kiss instantly felt better. John opened his mouth slightly to deepen the kiss. John’s mouth was so warm, and Sherlock’s lips gently closed over John’s upper lip, and a small, deep sound came from his throat when John sucked his bottom lip--softly, though, softly enough that it made Sherlock want to cry. He couldn’t contain himself and kissed John harder, the grip on his shoulders tightening.
John shut off the lamp, determined to ignore the anxiety in his chest and just try to let things be normal for once. It was just sharing a bed. They loved each other, right? This would be fine. He lay down on his back, aware of Sherlock’s eyes on him.
Swallowing thickly, John bit down a little harder, then softened his touch by kissing the spot softly. John pressed the front of his body against Sherlock’s back, heart fluttering at the contact, and he kissed the spot beneath Sherlock’s ear, lips parting and sucking. He felt a shiver run through Sherlock’s body, and he was impressed at how well he was still playing. John’s groin was pressed against Sherlock’s arse, and he tried hard not to get (too) aroused. He took Sherlock’s earlobe between his teeth.
John took in his surroundings, and it wasn’t until then that he noticed the blanket draped over his and Sherlock’s laps. He wondered how it got there, because he didn’t remember grabbing it--he didn’t even remember falling asleep--but then he saw a tea tray on the coffee table, and realized Mrs. Hudson must have been here. His head fell back against the sofa cushion. Well, that wasn’t embarrassing at
The last thing he felt before exhaustion overcame him was Sherlock’s large, warm hand turn around and lace their fingers together.
“Not true.” He planted his hands on the mattress, and slowly, he sat up, biting his lower lip, stifling any sound of pain.
But Sherlock’s features were smoothing out in a familiar expression of realization. “I think you’re right, John. I can’t see why else she would take a bullet for me, of all people, when she was more than willing for me to be shot before,” he ended the sentence bitterly.
John closed his eyes for a brief moment, as if gathering strength, and opened them. He looked determined. “Sherlock, just because I wasn’t expecting this, doesn’t mean I don’t want it.”
He paused, stopping in front of the table by the window. What was he, crazy? That wasn’t enough to--what? To assume these were visions?
But that only upset John more, and there was no way in hell he was going to cry in front of Mycroft, so he shut his mouth.
John exhaled slowly. “I mean, it makes sense now that I think about it,” he said quietly, more to himself than to Sherlock.
John shook his head again, like he was snapping out of a dream. “Well, I guess more will come later. You’re going to bed already? No staying up until 4 doing god-knows what until I find you passed out over the kitchen table, and put a blanket over you?”
“Of course you’re not,” John said with a smile in his voice, and the expression on his face would have been beautiful to Sherlock if it hadn’t been in response to him
Sherlock reached out and touched his knee. “John, listen to me. I’m happy that you love me, obviously, and that you want to be with me instead of Mary, but I’m not glad that this happened to you. I want to help you through this.”
“You didn’t have to throw it in the first place,” he teased, not even pretending to look at Sherlock’s face, his eyes roaming over the planes of his chest and his now-flaccid penis.
John’s eyes were filled with compassion. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. If it makes you feel any better, when you were making your speech, I was sitting there thinking I’d made a huge mistake.”
Despite this being part of the plan, Sherlock felt a ripple of anxiety course through his veins. He didn’t want to be hurt. He hoped John would arrive soon. A small voice asked in his head if John would arrive at all, but he dismissed it.
Sherlock didn’t know how to fix this. He was hurt and confused and angry and not really read to talk to John yet, but he didn’t want to lose his friendship. He knew things couldn’t be the same between them, not after walking in on him and Mary, not after the words they exchanged. His heart thumped painfully when he thought of John’s words again, his eyes squeezing shut, the thought of John deeming him incapable of a loving relationship bringing a fresh wave of pain.
This feeling hadn’t come out of nowhere--in fact, it had been building up for quite some time, and he knew it. If he had to sit and really think about it, then he would say he started hating his life after he found out Mary shot Sherlock, but he wasn’t exactly happy before then, either. John didn’t think he had been truly happy since before Sherlock fell.
“Let me hear you, baby,” John whispered, voice husky. “C’mon, Sherlock, you’re doing so well. Let go for me.”
John smiled a little. “Yeah. That’s what best friends do.” He was behind Sherlock, but was pretty sure he was grinning.
She scoffed. “Yeah, because Sherlock made an appearance! And why didn’t you tell me anything about not feeling a spark anymore? You just told me you loved me when we had sex a couple days ago.”
“I’ll keep you two fully updated on her case,” Mycroft told them. “You’ll both be involved with her trial, of course. I’ll take my leave.”
Sherlock just shook his head. “We’re both on edge,” he said in a tone that indicated it was the end of that previous line of conversation. “I’m sick of this bloody bed. I want to go home.”
Sherlock swallowed, holding John’s gaze so a shift of his eyes wouldn’t give away his nerves. “From what I gather about social constructs and traditions, someone who harbors affection for you.”
John’s shot daggers at him, his lip twitching imperceptibly. “What the hell do you know about relationships, anyway? You proposed to a woman for a case, for God's sake!”
“Yeah. But,” she looked around, “I don’t want to say it out here on the sidewalk. Just one step in here,” she gestured to the alley beside her.
John shook his head. “Just, after all that, she still thought she was right, you know? She thought she had a good reason to shoot you and lie to me. She acted like she was a victim because I got tired of her crap. I guess--” he rubbed his face with his free hand, “I guess I wasn’t a good husband to her, or fiancé, but she’s no saint.”
“You lied to him,” Sherlock retorted, “about everything from your name to your pregnancy. How could you expect him to stay with you after all of that? There are consequences to your actions, Mary.” His hands were balled into fists under the table. With John on his side, he was finally able to properly snap at her, and by god, did it feel good.
Sherlock kept quiet, but inside, he was satisfied. He was right. He wasn’t crazy. He was still the genius detective.
Culverton said, “Secret door. I built this whole wing. I can slip in and out anywhere I like, you know...” He paused, looking like he was struggling to control himself. “When I get the urge,” he finished.
John let him keep his eyes closed for the sake of his own comfort. “When did you accept that you felt this way?” he asked.
“Hey,” John huffed out a laugh into his shoulder, hooking a leg over Sherlock’s. He rubbed Sherlock’s back soothingly, his palm warm.
John put his hand to his mouth, trying not to laugh at his face. He did feel sorry for Lestrade, though, knowing he had cared about Sherlock, too. He figured he would give them a moment, and walked to the loo to wash up. When he went back into the sitting room, the hug had broken, and Sherlock was looking out one of the windows.
Sherlock felt scrutinized under his gaze (was this what other people felt like when he deduced them? It was unpleasant).
Sherlock rubbed his jaw, gaze somewhere else in the room. He swallowed, the corners of his mouth tight. “The only people I kissed before were for cases, and it was brief.”
Sherlock’s lips parted, but then he closed his mouth and swallowed, eyes cast downward, looking abashed. He looked back up, a small, nervous smile on his lips. “Surprise, John,” he said softly.
Sherlock didn’t know what sort of response was appropriate, but on the inside, he was a little pleased. Only a little, though. The fact that John was reacting this way told him all he needed to know about their marriage. It was over, and as much as he was glad, he didn’t enjoy John’s sadness. “I’m sorry,” he said simply.
“No, I’m not,” she said sharply. “Anyone could see that you look at him with far more than friendship. It was cute for a long time, but you actively interfered with our marriage today.”
Sherlock looked stricken. “I…” he trailed off. He swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing visibly. Sometimes, when Sherlock allowed his walls to go down, the depth of emotion on his face was frighteningly raw. Sherlock only looked at him helplessly.
John lowered his hand, chest heavy and icy horror in his gut. “I kicked you. I beat you, and for what? Over my fucking wife who tried to kill you? No!” he shouted when Sherlock opened his mouth to protest. “She did, Sherlock. She tried to kill you, and you know it.” He realized how loud he was being and sighed harshly. “Great, I’m shouting again,” he said miserably. But he wasn’t finished. He had to get all of this out. “I blamed you for something completely out of your control. I continued to be married to the woman who tried to end your life. I made you
John was shaking with anger. But he needed to make sure Sherlock didn’t take a bloody heart attack. “Come on,” he commanded gruffly, grabbing his hand, “you’re going back to bed, and you’re not moving until I say so. Got it?” His knees were shaking.
“Well,” Sherlock said quietly after a long pause, “I don’t exactly disagree with you on anything. I only kept quiet because I thought you wanted to stay with her.”
Sherlock felt the sudden urge to bury his face into John’s stomach, but thought it would have been considered too much in front of Mrs. Hudson, so he settled for leaning into John’s touch.
John didn’t know what to say. He was utterly shocked--he was so caught up in his own head that he hadn’t known Sherlock was even hard--but Sherlock coming without having his cock touched even once was so, so fucking hot. Or, it would have been, if Sherlock didn’t look like he wanted to run away and hide.
Sherlock decided to step in. “Mary, you’re only making things worse for yourself. You lied to John, and he decided that he does not want to put up with it anymore. Nothing will change that. Even if he did not have feelings for me, what you did wouldn’t change. It’s over.”
“Please do,” he said, averting his eyes, finding Lestrade’s gaze intimidating for the first time in his life.
kept secrets from him, leaving him and her baby daughter to run away. She was selfish, and her bullshit justifications for her actions made her cruel. If she hadn’t died, he was going to divorce her. He knew their relationship couldn’t work out. He wanted so much more than what Mary gave him, and he still did. He wanted it from Sherlock.
“That’s what I thought.” He lifted his head, blinking blearily at him. He cupped John’s jaw with his thumb. “You should shave.”
John turned on the lamp on the bedside table as Sherlock shut the door. “I dunno what you usually like,” he said, turning to him, “but I’d like to see you tonight.”
“She’s a darling little girl,” she commented, standing Rosie up on her lap, hands underneath her armpits.
John placed the folded blanket on atop one of the arms of the sofa. “I’m just asking. Dinner might be fun. You two seemed to really hit it off,” he said bitterly. What the fuck was he doing? He was supposed to make things right between
John huffed a breath. “God, how many heart attacks are you going to give me today? Well, who is it?”
“We really are,” John slid both hands down to grasp his thin hips, his voice gruff. He noticed Sherlock’s breathing was a little too fast, so he decided to make him laugh. “Can’t believe I’m touching another cock right now.”
“You never wanted to love anyone after that,” John said, not realizing the thought left his lips until he heard his own voice.
John felt himself getting hard. He pressed their hips together experimentally and was pleasantly surprised to be met with a bulge. They both broke apart, looking down.
“Of course not,” he said hotly. “Why would I?” Why would he want to see the love of his life have sex with someone he hated?
There it was, out in the open: John hated himself. It was true, and hearing Sherlock say it made his breath shudder.
Suddenly, the image of their first night on a case flashed behind John’s eyes: Sherlock so young, no lines on his face yet, gently but firmly saying,
Mary’s shoulders slumped. “I don’t know what you want me to do about that, John. I can’t go back in time and change that,” she said, with an air of self-pity.
John looked out the window, the ache in his chest growing. What was he going to do, beat Mycroft up? It was useless. The damage he’d done to Sherlock couldn’t be reversed, but John could try. He
“No, it’s okay,” he said, and paused the conversation to give Rosie more food. “I was a fool,” anger slowly dripped into his voice, “for thinking she ever liked me.”
John rubbed his eyes, but the weariness pulling down his eyelids remained. He couldn’t remember the last time he got a full night’s sleep. First his mind was plagued by images of Mary, and now he couldn’t stop thinking about Sherlock. There was a time in his life when that brought a smile to his face, albeit wistful. Not anymore.
“I think you’re full of it,” John said, and now he started to sound a little irritated. “I lived with you during the time of the Woman and Moriarty, and neither of those people had you running out of a crime scene like that.”
Sherlock’s lips trembled, and he blinked helplessly. “I’m not--” His words stopped dead in his throat.
“Indeed,” Sherlock chimed in with a smile, lacing his fingers together with John’s. “Let’s go home. Baker Street,” he told the cabbie.
Sherlock was surprised to see John enter his flat on the day after his birthday. Things were...better, he thought, than they were the day in the morgue, and when he was in the hospital bed. Upon discovering irrefutable proof that Culverton Smith was a killer and Sherlock wasn’t completely out of his mind, John’s faith in him seemed to have been restored, at least tentatively. They talked yesterday. More than they usually did, anyway. Sherlock was glad John let everything out about Mary and the cheating, and even trusted Sherlock enough to cry and let himself be vulnerable.
“Because I know it can bring happiness, and I want you to be happy. Because I’m your friend.” His skin was on fire. “So. Just thought you should know,” he finished with an awkward nod.
John knew a panic attack while high with a hole in his chest would put Sherlock in a much worse state. He still wanted to run away from Sherlock and hide, but he sat down on the edge of the bed and grasped Sherlock’s wrists, prying them away from his head. “Sherlock, you need to breathe.” His own voice didn’t sound very comforting--all scratchy and thick with bubbling anger beneath the surface--but he was calm compared to Sherlock.
As much as John hated to ruin the mood, he cared about Sherlock’s health. “Sorry, Sherlock, but I’m going to need to check your back again.”
Sherlock breathes deeply a couple times to ensure his voice would not crack. “I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed.” No, that was wrong. He was supposed to be used to kissing John.
Dream Sherlock was in his chair, holding Rosie, who was whining into his chest. He looked haggard, close to how he looked during the Culverton case, only cleaner. He held her closer. “I know,” he croaked, resting his cheek on the top of her golden head. “I wish he were here, too.”
He sent another bouquet to John on Tuesday, this time of lilies. John liked flowers once, so why not another time? Just two times, though. A third time would be pushing his luck. On Wednesday, he decided to go a little further and give John an expensive bottle of scotch, believing a box of chocolates would be ineffective considering he, himself, was the one with the sweet tooth. He attached a note to the neck of the bottle, typed so John wouldn’t see recognize his handwriting:
Sherlock hoped his face didn’t betray his surprise. He looked at this girl more carefully. Her body language conveyed anxiety, but she didn’t look like she was lying. Should he trust her? He couldn’t see any indication of a weapon on her person. He never had a member of his network attack him before, but this was odd because he wasn’t on a case, and he only interacted with his network on a case. He would be cautious, but this girl was quite a bit shorter and weaker than he, so he didn’t think she was a threat. Besides, he never told any of them about Mary, so it couldn’t be that this girl--Amy, Amy was her name--was making up a lie to get his attention.
A deep gasp came from above, and John pulled off him, about to ask if Sherlock were okay, but his cock twitched at the sight of his face, flushed more than John had ever seen, mouth open in a heart shape.
John looked at Sherlock’s hands holding his arms, his eyebrows raised. “Um, okay. Sherlock, you didn’t answer me.”
“Just keep this close,” John carefully put it on the kitchen table. “In case of, I dunno. I want you to be safe, too.”
John looked back over at the flowers, and Sherlock saw the faintest hint of pink dust his cheeks, and he chewed on his bottom lip. John then shrugged, looking back down at Sherlock’s hand, getting a scissor the cut off the gauze from the roll. “It’s a little old-fashioned, but who doesn’t like flowers? It’s thoughtful, even if it’s a little creepy ’cause I don’t know who it’s from.”
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock said. He left the room without another word. He made his way to the cafeteria in a daze, sitting down at one of the empty tables, staring into space. John didn’t remember Mary. How was Sherlock going to explain her? Explaining his falsified suicide was easier because, in part, he still didn’t fully understand Mary.
The question took John by surprise. “What?” he asked, looking up. They were sitting in their respective chairs, Rosie having been put to bed two hours ago, with the television playing some nature documentary neither was really paying attention to.
Sherlock’s body fell to the floor, his cheek hitting the ground. He immediately started coughing violently, his lungs singing in relief and screaming for air. He heard some sort of commotion going on, but his drugged and oxygen-deprived brain couldn’t process any of it. He wheezed and hacked up more blood, and his chest hurt from lack of oxygen. He was beginning to make out the sounds around him.
John couldn’t tell if he was lying. He was grateful that Sherlock genuinely seemed to like Rosie, because that had been something which worried him immensely. He didn’t know what that said about him, that he was worrying about how his best friend would react to his child being born than the actual birth of his daughter.
John cleared his throat, blushing lightly. “I tried to see if any of that old spark was there. I put on stupid cheesy music and everything, tried to be romantic. It didn’t work at all. It was--perfunctory.”
John closed his eyes, trying not to get too upset with himself when he felt that Sherlock was still too thin, and likely would be for another couple weeks or so (Sherlock didn’t gain weight easily--the lucky git). He wondered if Sherlock still had bruises from his harsh kicks in the morgue, and John had to stop his train of thought again.
“The past five days,” Mrs. Hudson’s hushed, concerned voice replied. “I’m not sure how much he’s moved. He won’t talk…”
“But you’re so funny,” John cupped both of his cheeks, tilting his head to the side and deepening their kiss, warmth pouring into his chest.
the thought of Mary anymore. He was tired of her constant, looming presence in their lives that continued after her death. He wanted to build a life with John now that the worst was over, but it felt like they could never truly move on. Rosie was a constant reminder of Mary, although it wasn’t her fault and he did love her. He wished John never met Mary, but Rosie still existed. He knew that was impossible. His mind wasn’t working efficiently.
Sherlock’s fingers on his shirt trembled and tightened around the fabric. In a cautious motion, he bean sucking on John’s upper lip, keeping the suction light.
“She said she knew I love you, and if I interfered with your marriage more, she would tell you, thus ruining our friendship.”
“Besides,” he lowered his gaze, “you weren’t wrong last night about how she acted towards me, in the end.”
Sherlock didn’t even know where to begin. “I don’t have much to do?” he asked incredulously. “What are you talking about? You don’t know my life. You don’t know how I occupy my time.”
Did...John want to sleep next to him? Sherlock was so tired. His mind was incapable of processing emotions for now. “I see,” he said simply. He ran a hand through his curls. “Thank you, John. I think I’m going to my room now.”
Sherlock felt guilty for hoping whatever happened could benefit him somehow. John was unhappy. That never made him happy. “Hello, John,” he said from behind his book.
Then, as if on cue, Rosie’s cries flooded their bedroom from the monitor and they both groaned. The sex situation was not helped by having a baby in the flat. John looked at the clock and was surprised to see it was ten minutes past two. He really had to stop letting his thoughts keep him awake.
He just looked at them for a moment. “And you say I’m the antisocial one,” he said to John. “The party’s over there, not in a corner.” His tone was in between amused and annoyed.
Sherlock’s mouth tightened a little, and he looked down. “Well, I’m not sure ‘fun’ is the right word to describe it. Interesting, maybe.”
That seemed to do it for her. “Ah, John, always the gentleman. I see. But what about, what’s her name, Mary?”
John started laughing, feeling the stress fade away from his body. He got in his side of the bed, putting his head on Sherlock’s warm, bare shoulder. He let out a deep breath. “She’ll never think she’s wrong, no matter what.”
She released the fistful of hair and Sherlock’s head dropped, his chin hitting his chest. It took him this long to realize he was in Mary’s house.
“I know it’s Peppa Pig,” John didn’t bother looking up. “Is he that into her, that I made him so uncomfortable by saying it’d only be us again? And you,” he added.
Yeah, I don't want to make John just completely move on and forget about Rosie because I feel like that would be unrealistic, but he's not going to be totally hung up on her in every chapter.
John swallowed, standing awkwardly in the doorway. “Er, well, she came out of your room one time I was here. In that,” he nodded towards the dressing gown.
, John laid his hand on Sherlock’s muscular thigh, smoothing his hand up the rough material of his trousers, until he reached his groin. John cupped Sherlock, and almost growled when he felt the hard, warm bulge. He felt so hard already, so worked up over something so simple. John felt himself get harder, and thought that anymore, he really wasn’t much different.
Sherlock buttoned his suit jacket over his deep red dress shirt. He didn’t know why he went with red, but it was too late to change now. John was downstairs giving Rosie to Mrs. Hudson. They were about to go out to dinner, on a
Sherlock nodded, placing his hand on John’s cheek and going in. His lips were pedal soft, and John never kissed someone physically larger than he was before, and he found himself suppressing a shiver from Sherlock’s large, warm palm on his face. There was a lingering trace of a venomous voice in his head hissing that this was emasculating, but fuck it, he was done with trying to be the man society wanted him to and--he was still a bloody man, for Christ’s sake. This was who he always was.
“I do,” John said sincerely, staring into his eyes. “I never thought you would, and--and I don’t know how you still could after everything,” he said, face wracked with guilt.
John, panting from his release, gathered Sherlock into his arms and made a shushing sound as best as he could. “It’s all right,” he said breathlessly. “Breathe, Sherlock. You’re okay.”
“I think he needs more morphine,” John told her. “He looks like he’s in pain, and he hurt himself by getting out of bed,” he told her.
Sherlock felt like he was going to vomit. He looked down. “I’m sorry,” he mumbled. He couldn’t look at John’s face any longer. He felt a flush of shame on his cheeks.
He looked at himself in the mirror. He looked as miserable as he felt, his eyes glassy and dejected. He went back into his room and curled up on his side, not feeling very well, and noticed he still had his shoes on. He kicked them off and turned on his other side. He was tempted to grab his other pillow and hold it, but--but nothing. It wasn’t like he could stoop any lower. He grabbed the pillow and squeezed it against his chest, feeling like a teenager, his eyes stinging.
Sherlock grinned. “I know. But, if we had tried to get together back then, perhaps we would have fallen apart.”
John felt pleasantly tired. It may have just been some humping, but...no, it really was just some humping. Damn, he was getting old. He even came before Sherlock!
Now, they were right outside the door. Sherlock turned his face to shoot daggers at John. Their faces were close, and John could feel Sherlock’s breath on his face when a haughty huff left his nose.
The spoonful of yogurt paused before John brought it up to his lips. He quickly put the spoonful in his mouth, trying not to be obvious, trying to hide the heat he felt filling his cheeks. He had no idea what to say. “Mmm.”
John wanted to say, but knew Sherlock wouldn’t get it. He didn’t understand how romantic he was. It was endearing. His hand petted Sherlock’s chest and belly, getting used to touching his warm, naked skin. It was ridiculous, because Sherlock’s body felt no different from anyone else’s (what had he been expecting?), but it was
Was he upset? John sighed, running his hand through his hair. He looked down at the ground, shaking his head. “You left me,” he said quietly.
Sherlock’s posture was tense. “I feel lied to,” he said slowly. “I feel as if every positive interaction with her had an unequal power balance. She always knew the truth, and I think she got a rise out of it.” His lips pressed together. “I think she felt that way for both of us.”
John felt like he was going to fucking burst just by looking at him. “What? You’re gonna come?” He pressed his thumb against Sherlock’s perineum.
The last traces of anger were leaving Sherlock’s face, and a nearby streetlight made his eyes light in the night. His lips parted, and he had took a moment to gather the courage to speak. “I may not be a good man, John, but do you really believe I would knowingly hurt you so badly? I’m sorry I didn’t know, but that’s just it: I
John dropped it. “Ugh. All right, Sherlock. Come to think of it, maybe she doesn’t need a middle name after all. Hm. How about Rose Watson?”
John shook his head. “Don’t be hard on yourself. It’s really not as big of a deal as you’re making it out to be.”
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back, squeezing them together for comfort. “Trust me, John, the last five years taught me to value you more.”
“You wouldn’t dream of it,” John dismissed. “And, I am feeling better than earlier. Thanks for being patient. I know that trait doesn’t come easily to you.”
That night, John woke up in a sweat. His brain was fuzzy, unpleasantly so. It felt like he had just been in the middle of an intense dream, but only vague images lingered in his mind. He was thinking of Irene and Sherlock, so he must have dreamt of them. He rubbed his eyes. He tried to think, struggling to remember. An image of Irene smiling and tracing Sherlock’s bottom lip with her finger presented itself, her red nail polish standing out brightly through the haze of the fading dream. John shook his head with a grimace, willing the image away. Everything else was blurry, but that was enough to put a knot in his stomach. He rolled over with a grumble. The neon numbers shining from the clock on the bedside table caught his eye. It was 4:03. Was Sherlock still awake? John hoped not. His body was still recovering from being addicted to god-knows what, and he needed rest. John feared that Mycroft was going to call him one of these days with news that Sherlock relapsed. He seemed to be doing well, though, all things considered. Without any cases to work on, he was probably at least relaxing. But...
Sherlock pressed a kiss to the top of his head, a surprisingly chaste gesture and juxtaposition with what his hand was doing. John ducked his head and smeared kisses across his collarbone and the wave of pleasure grew. He bucked into Sherlock’s hand, unable to control the movement of his hips.
“I’m in love.” John let the tightness in his chest melt away with the deep rumble of Sherlock’s laughter. “Let’s just go to bed and see what happens, okay?”
Sherlock was standing there, holding John’s coat. His disguise of glasses and a penciled-on mustache were gone. His jaw was clenched and his lips were pressed together tightly. He clearly didn’t know what to do, and his eyes were suspiciously shiny.
A flash of emotion entered John’s eyes, and he nodded and looked out the window. Sherlock thought he was getting choked up, but why? He didn’t get it, but he didn't get most things about children. He loved Rosie, but he had absolutely no idea what he was doing with her. He was nervous about going home, too, and having John see her again. Would his memories return?
That was an understatement. His heart gave a pang, but John cupped his chin and placed his thumb on Sherlock’s lower lip.
God, John was an idiot. He really had been so caught up in his own head and insecurities that he ignored what was right in front of him. But it was the false deduction Sherlock made that was getting to him the most. John didn’t think he was a sociopath, and he didn’t think being with Irene would have made him more human. It must have really hurt for Sherlock to think his best friend thought of him as a machine. How could Sherlock ever think he was a sociopath? He cared so much, he always did. He deserved be told that. John said he wasn’t a sociopath, but he clearly didn’t believe him.
, thought. They were going to be together, and watch Rosie grow into a beautiful girl, and no one was going to stop them.
He couldn’t deny it. “Aren’t you? She shot me when I tried to help her. You think she’d take this quietly?”
, either,” he said through gritted teeth. He kicked off his shoes and tugged off his jacket. He left everything on the floor, not feeling motivated to put anything together at the moment. He got on the bed and gathered Rosie into his arms, holding her to his chest. He pulled down the hood of her bunny onesie, and caressed her golden hair. “Things were supposed to start to get better,” he said quietly.
“I do,” Sherlock nodded, “and I think you’re correct. She loved you, but that doesn’t mean she liked you. No offense.”
“So I moved in here,” Sherlock finished his thought. “Besides, I know you’d rather not see her,” he said, looking up from his screen.
“I’ll head out too,” Lestrade reluctantly put his phone away. “I’ll check on him later in the week. Hopefully he’ll be more coherent by then, eh?”
After Mary shot him without a second of hesitation, Sherlock wouldn’t put anything past her, not even faking a pregnancy and forging ultrasounds. Not anymore. Sherlock had noticed that other than a bump under her baggy clothing, she really didn’t show any signs of pregnancy. He wished he could search her internet history, and see if she purchased a silicon stomach. It bothered him, because if his suspicions were true, then she was deceiving John, and Sherlock wouldn’t let anyone deceive John if he could help it. He had hesitated to tell John, however, because he was already on thin ice after shooting Magnussen and getting high on the plane--two things considered Not Good by John.
John reached down and grabbed Sherlock’s T-shirt from the floor, where he had thrown it. “Put your shirt back on.”
I realized I've written +35,000 words and I haven't really had too many moments where it's like "ooooooh they're close!!! They're going to get together soon!!!!" It was kind of put off by Sherlock being shot. But I just want to reassure you that I'm not one of those authors who writes 50,000 words of angst and doesn't make them kiss until, like, the last 1,000 words in the last chapter lol. They shall have time to be together! This is just a little more slow burn than I anticipated.
John giggled, removing his arm from his face, and saw a perplexed Sherlock. Feeling light and playful, he pinched his cheek. “I love you.”
John scratched the back of his neck, growing bashful again. “So, about that. I had wondered if you, erm, do any of that. Sex.”
Curiosity getting the better of him, Sherlock asked, “Why were you sleeping here? Why didn’t you go to your old room?”
“I mean,” he cleared his throat, “um, what are you comfortable with? Did you like when we kissed, and, er, hugged?”
“Yeah,” John said with a smile, “it’s nice being awake.” He sat down in his red armchair, inviting Lestrade to sit in Sherlock’s chair, which he did.
John’s fingers dove into his tangled curls, and caressed them gently. It was an impulsive move, one he wouldn’t have done yesterday, but he’d always loved Sherlock’s hair, and didn’t want him to wake up just yet. However, it was too late for that.
John wanted her to stop touching him. Now was not the damn time to dwell over how he felt for Mary, but he still didn’t want her hands on him. It felt like a block of ice was in the pit of his stomach. He suddenly felt the urge to flee. He had to get out of here. He lifted his head from his hands.
A note about this story: the first episode of season 4 has now aired. This story will not be affected by it. I'm going to continue to write it as I was with no modifications to the plot or characterizations. Consider this non-canon compliant, at this point.
“I’m fine, I assure you. Anyway, the flowers are from someone who knows you, the person does not want you to know who he is yet--”
Right. “I suppose this will have to do.” He licked his palm, and slid his hand under the waistband of Sherlock’s pajama and pants, wrapping his hand around his cock. God, it was hot. He gave it a squeeze, pressing two chaste kisses to his forehead.
John’s mouth dropped open. “What? Sherlock, no.” He lowered his hand with the ring clasped between his fingers, and put the ring in his jeans pocket. He put his other hand on Sherlock’s cheek instead, palm warm. The sun shining in from the window made John’s dark eyes light up. His ears were growing red again. He took a deep breath. “Sherlock, listen to me,” he said in his no-nonsense voice, but then a flash of apprehension in his eyes made him clear his throat. His courage seemed short-lived and he looked afraid. “I’ve loved you for a ridiculous amount of time. I never said anything because I didn’t think
Sherlock’s lips twisted into an unhappy, bitter smile. “It is when you consider my poor track record of friendships.”
“Just ‘nice’?” John laughed. He playfully pinched his side. “You better hope Mrs. Hudson’s not home or else she definitely heard you.”
By this point, John realized that he was breathing too harshly, too quickly, and these were the early signs of a panic attack. He gasped sharply, opening his eyes to the darkness under the duvet. He forced himself to get his breathing under control, but the air under the duvet hot and stuffy. He whimpered into his pillow, the fabric of the pillowcase damp from his tears, grateful no one could see him like this. He gulped.
Their kisses were soft and slow, a sensuous gliding of lips, little wet sounds. John’s hand moved and wrapped around the back of Sherlock’s neck, tugging on the soft curls at his nape. Sherlock’s grip tightened on his hips and a low hum came from his throat. John took that pink, soft bottom lip into his mouth and sucked lightly, but returned to chaste, small kisses when Sherlock gasped.
Irene was standing at the bottom of the steps, hand on the railing. Her hair was down and for once, she was wearing actual pajamas, no makeup on. “I always knew I never had a real chance with Sherlock Holmes,” she pressed on. “I have fun with him, but that’s all. I’m gay. So is he.”
“Of course not,” Mycroft asserted. “We’ve caught her, we’ll try her, we’ll convict her, and we’ll keep her in a cell. She doesn’t know you’re alive, Sherlock, by the way. I intend on keeping it that way until time comes for charges to be pressed against her. It’ll be quite dramatic, don’t you think?”
John sank into the chair, heart heavy. There was too much to say to even begin responding to that statement. “Maybe we should talk about this later,” he said tiredly.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, and it would have been comical if he didn’t look so frightened. He let go of John, but he grabbed Sherlock’s hands, murmuring, “No, no, no, stay here.”
“She should have held her tongue,” Sherlock said, as if reading his mind. “I don’t blame you for growing angry.”
Sherlock patted his forehead with the damp washcloth again. “What they gave you was strong. You’ve been out for hours.”
John put his leg down and stood up straight, looking down. He wished he had a camera. Sherlock was staring up at him with hazy, unfocused eyes, mouth open, face scarlet, fingers clawing into the chair, legs spread with a tent in his trousers. He was the perfect picture of lust, like something straight out of a porn site, but he was
At this point, John was used to evading these questions which were impossible to answer truthfully. “I saw you shirtless around the flat before, you know, your time away. I figured all of this had to have happened then.”
Sherlock was blinking quickly, struggling against the morphine trying to take over his system. “Before I got shot, she texted me, and you weren’t surprised that she was alive at all. How did I miss that?” he asked himself, looking down at the blankets for a moment. “I was compromised,” he muttered to himself.
“I’m serious,” John insisted. “You know you’ve got your ways, but so do I. I can make a list of all your good qualities.” Maybe he would one day.
Lestrade nodded, too. “It’s not a problem.” He paused. “I am sorry about this, if that means anything.”
“Baker Street,” John said weakly, and his tone fit with the winded expression on his face. “We need to have a long talk. We’re not doing it here or in a cab,” he said firmly.
The beautifully flustered look on John’s face diminished to a frown. “Like she’d do that,” he muttered. He let go of Sherlock’s hand. “There you go. You should be fine in a few days.”
Sherlock went into his arms willingly, but shyly, his hands curled over John’s chest. He took a deep breath, which turned into a deep, soft chuckle. “We really didn’t last long, did we?”
“No, I need to do this. You need to hear it. I’m sorry for taking out all of my anger on you. I’m so,
John shook his head, the fire leaving him and his shoulders slumping. “So many lies, and you never feel sorry for any of them. You’d lie to me about anything as long as it benefited you. Mary, how is that a healthy marriage?”
Yeah, I thought about not having Mary get back at them in any way, but I don't know, this story feels a little anti-climatic as is? I think this story will only have one or two more chapters, though.
He had to say something. John swallowed, and asked in the calmest voice he could muster, “What year is it?”
The only reason why he even dated Mary in the first place was because he was so bloody lonely after Sherlock died. John didn’t really blame himself for getting together with Mary, because she was the only support in his life during his two years of mourning, and he had no idea that she was a bloody psychopath, but he wished Sherlock came back sooner, before he basically proposed to Mary and couldn’t go back on it.
The core conflict of John thinking Sherlock likes Irene etc., etc., will return, but this chapter just kind of happened lol.
Sherlock hoped John wouldn’t tell her about it. Maybe he could convince him to stay quiet during his visit to the surgery.
Sherlock didn’t know much about John’s childhood, but suddenly he pictured a blond-haired little boy staring into space with a shining grin on his face, dreaming of being a military hero with a wife at home. Sherlock was thankful that he was the one John had in his life, instead, but he felt sorry for the image of the innocent child in his mind, not yet broken by war, by Sherlock’s jump, or by Mary. Sherlock thought of himself as a child, before he was hurt by Redbeard, and thought that he and John would have been good friends back then.
Okay so I THINK, despite the note this chapter ended on, John might make a bit of a move next chapter. But that doesn't mean everything will become unicorns and rainbows lol
“How ‘bout we go see Sherlock after you’re done?” he asked her, watching her stuff another small piece of dry cereal into her mouth. “He sent me a text yesterday saying he wants to see you.” He paused. “I suppose I don’t have to justify this to you, do I?” He thought seeing Sherlock would be good for Rosie, too. She had been shoved from person to person so much that John wanted her to have some stability, get to know the same handful of faces better.
“Right,” John put his hands on his hips. “Right.” He stood there in thought for a moment. “We can take things really slowly, and by that I mean, we can start whenever you want.”
Sherlock blinked rapidly, and he fumbled to kick off his shoes and take off his coat. In his pajamas now (and barefoot--he must not have put on socks to leave the house), he crawled across the mattress to sit next to John. “Yes?” he asked nervously.
). His nerves were singing. John’s warm, wet mouth was now kissing his neck by his ear, and he had no idea why but it felt divine. It was just kissing, but it was slowly turning his blood into magma. His lips were so soft, insistent but still somehow gentle. John’s arm was supporting him more than his own legs. He couldn’t stop a gasp when John’s hand met his bare chest, above his pecs, his nipples perking up and tingling when his thumb ran over one.
Sherlock looked, and he saw a man in a suit trying to appear inconspicuous by pretending to talk on the phone. Of course she would have noticed. “Just a precaution,” he said.
“I know,” John’s heart ached for him. “You have no idea how long I’ve spent wishing the same. But,” he took Sherlock’s hand in his, “I want to be
A pause. “Why?” he asked. He could faintly make out the sounds of the towel rubbing against Sherlock’s wet skin, and shit, it really was too hot in there.
“It was,” John laughed at the memory. “You insulted the guests, were clearly out of your depth, a bit, but you made everyone cry. In a good way.”
“Text her,” Sherlock said. “Tell her we want to meet her downstairs at Speedy’s.” He felt safer in the vicinity of the flat. It occurred to him that he had an obnoxious big brother in the government, and he kicked himself for not thinking of him sooner. “I can phone Mycroft and ask him to set up surveillance, that way if she tries to hurt either of us, she won’t get away with it.”
John removed his wrist from Sherlock’s hand, and wanted to scream. “That’s fucking bollocks, Sherlock. It was terrible--a terrible dream--and it was over fucking Mary, of all people.”
The cab pulled up to Baker Street. Great, he hadn’t even arrived yet, and he was already in a sour mood. He did that to himself, though, and Sherlock didn’t deserve to be on the receiving end of his bitterness, so he would hide it--at least as much as he could. He paid the cabbie and looked up as he got out of the car. For a second, he saw Sherlock at the window, but in a flash, he was gone. Odd.
John had been right about Sherlock needing to receive more reassurance. “Don’t be like that. I told you I fell for you right away and it feels like a privilege to have you.” Heat was crawling up his face and the tips of his ears.
Sherlock nodded, too. His eyes were drawn to John’s stubble again. John’s moustache was hideous, but Sherlock wondered how he would look with a beard.
Both of John’s hands were on his face and his mouth was smashed against Sherlock’s. He pulled back with a hard
The hand that was smoothing down Sherlock’s hide went under his T-shirt, running up the (non-wounded) side of his body. His skin was hot, and John felt his chest contracting with each quick breath. His thumb rubbed his nipple (it was already hard--how wound up was Sherlock?), and he felt a harsh shiver run through Sherlock’s body. John was pressing quick, open-mouthed kisses to the underside of his jaw, murmuring
John flinched away from her touch, and Mary looked hurt and confused. “What is it? What happened?” she asked.
“Make yourself at home,” Sherlock said. He didn’t want to appear aloof, but knew that if he started asking John questions right away, it would only make him angrier. He would wait until John spoke first. He turned a page and pretended to read, watching John from his peripheral vision.
They were standing still at a red light now. They were close to home, and there weren’t many cars on the road tonight. Sherlock’s eyes flickered down at John.
“What kind of doctor are you?” Sherlock asked, and it sounded light and teasing, but his ribs ached, and it felt like a genuine question. He settled back on the pillows. He was tired. “I got my confession, though.”
Sherlock squeezed John’s hands so tightly it had to hurt, his mouth opening and throat tightening. He was sweating profusely. Was he going to pass out?
Sherlock suddenly got up, walking to the middle of the room and picking up his dressing gown. “Well, there’s still the bedroom upstairs,” was all he said as he tugged the bloody gown back over his body.
Sherlock began pacing around the room, but he was limping, hissing in pain and holding himself tighter, muttering
Sorry I couldn't get this out to you sooner. I got a cold last week. It wasn't anything serious, and I'm fine now, but it was enough to make me too tired to write.
It was the criminals who had nothing to lose that always scared Sherlock the most. The ones who feared imprisonment could be manipulated. It was clear that Mary was serious. Sherlock felt an awful combination of lethargy and spine-tingling anxiety. He couldn’t escape or reason with her. She almost killed him once. Nothing would stop her from doing it now. John. He might never see John again. Even though he just tried moving, Sherlock started squirming again, panic rising in his gut.
“You won’t have to work,” Sherlock suddenly blurted out. “You and Rosie will live with me once Irene is gone. We can share a room and Rosie will have your old one.”
John changed her nappy and sat with her as she munched on dry cereal in her height chair. He wanted to go see Sherlock, but he needed to spend time with her. While she ate, John got his phone, and the date was 8th February 2017. It was about a month after Sherlock’s birthday, after the incident with Culverton.
“Yes,” he said, growing uncomfortable. “I made you believe we were about to die so I could hear how much you had missed me. After that incident, we were back to normal again, more or less.”
now. At least in the other world, John had Rosie, and hadn’t given his heart to Sherlock only to have it rejected. He wasn’t happy before, but his desires hadn’t completely been shot down, either. Why did he even hope? The only person who ever loved him was a cold-blooded killer (and he wasn’t even sure if Mary loved him); why would someone like Sherlock want him? It made no sense, and Sherlock was a man driven by logic. There was nothing appealing about John. He was a twat, cruel, stupid, a wounded soldier with permanent PTSD, had horrible anger issues, took advantage of people, and was nowhere near as attractive as Sherlock. He was hideous. He didn’t deserve anyone’s love, not after he treated, well, everyone, but especially Sherlock’s. He wasn’t as cruel to Sherlock in this world, but maybe this was god’s punishment for his sins. He believed in god, but never exactly believed in divine punishment until now, but fuck, it made sense. There was no other explanation for why John’s life was nothing but a constant cycle of misery.
Sherlock’s hand was hovering in the air, teacup dangling, nearly getting tea on the floor. “What was what?”
that came from below, and John was on his feet, running down the steps. The sitting room was dark, but when he flipped on the light, the room was empty, along with the kitchen. The bathroom door was open, revealing no one inside. John ran to Sherlock’s bedroom, flinging the door open.
“You said it yourself to me several times: he’s a sociopath! He lied to you! What did you expect?” she taunted, teeth bared.
Sherlock dealt with many killers in his life, but Culverton had to be among the most disgusting. The pure joy he got from his victims’ suffering made Sherlock want to throttle him, but he had to stay still. He had to let Culverton hurt him, at least until John came. John would come. Right?
Sherlock put the bottle on the floor next to the bed, turned on his side, and let his tears loose. His sobs drowned out the beeping heart monitor.
John sat there, tears drying on his cheeks, his muscles robbed of their energy. He thought of Rosie, losing her mother (as terrible as Mary was, Rosie didn’t know any of that), and now her father. Sherlock would take good care of her, he knew, but it wasn’t supposed to be like that.
Sighing and trying to remove the ache from his chest, John walked up behind Sherlock, who was seated at the kitchen table, and kissed the top of his head. He liked that Sherlock was getting dressed again, too. A Sherlock in pajamas was soft and cute, but a Sherlock in trousers and tight dress shirts was sexy.
Sherlock went into the surgery, now looking like himself, and didn’t see the roses on the front desk. Good--John got them. He held up his hand to the receptionist. “Hello, I understand I could see a doctor here?” he asked, putting on his fake friendly smile.
John gulped. He buried his nose into Sherlock’s curls by his ear. “Want me to touch you here?” he asked, reaching down and cupping Sherlock’s cock, which jumped in his hand.
did to me was love!” He was shaking, knees trembling, his yelling echoing off the walls. “I hate you,” his voice almost cracked. “I hate that I ever trusted you.”
Their kiss ended after a few moments. John rubbed their noses together. “And look, we’ll have more times to do exactly what you want, yeah?”
“No idea,” he muttered, but was pleased when Sherlock’s features smoothed out when more morphine was pumped into his veins. Sherlock may not have liked it, but the Culverton case taught John that he disregarded his health to a dangerous degree, and damn it, even though he was failing horribly, John wanted to take better care of him for once in their bloody lives.
John tilted his head up, a dreamy look on his face. “Hm, nope. Just sweet.” He planted a kiss on Sherlock’s chin. He licked his lips. “We still have our coats on," he said randomly.
He wished he knew how. He never let himself go completely in front of anyone before, not during sex, and he was scared of it.
John smirked a little. “I kind of like how irritated that made you. What, you don’t think you’re a prize?”
John punched the door of the stall. Why the fuck was he here?! Why was he sent back in time?! Things were even
“You shouldn’t,” Sherlock said into his ear. “You’re a good man, John. You are. You’re the best person I’ve ever met. I love you.”
Sherlock was standing there with his hands folded in front of his penis, not trying to hide himself, but perhaps a subconscious gesture. John saw the trail of thin hair from the bottom of his navel thicken as it reached lower, and over the barrier of his large hands, John could see the beginning of his cock. John’s eyes landed on a couple fading, yellowing bruises on Sherlock’s ribs, where he had kicked him, and it felt like someone twisted a knife in his gut.
John walked into his room and found Sherlock sitting on his bed, laptop out, case files all over the duvet and floor on the right side of the bed. Despite himself, John’s eyes did a quick scan of the room, but he didn’t see anything that resembled Irene’s belongings.
and Sherlock, not Irene and Sherlock! Did his bollocks fall off and roll under the sofa while he slept?
John went on, "It feels like I don't have enough to go on right now. You don't think this guy is dangerous, do you?"
John looked down at himself, and he had a noticeable bulge, too. He cleared his throat, head spinning, moving his hand away from his chest. “It’s okay, Sherlock.”
His thumb stroked over the soft skin of his hand. “Just relax. You don’t need to sleep if you don’t want to. Just stay,” he whispered.
. He was being hugged by someone who loved him...had this ever happened before? Well, yes, actually--back on Sherlock’s birthday. This was the second hug he had ever shared with him, not counting the one-sided one  at his wedding, and it was one of the best sensations of his life. Sherlock was cold (did he walk here?) so John instinctively held him closer, the arm around the back of his neck moving so his hand was in his hair. They were both breathing heavily, holding onto each other for dear life.
John’s hand settled on his face, thumb stroking his prominent cheekbone. “It was agony, pretending to watch bloody Gordon Ramsay when you were sitting right next to me, sharing the same bloody blanket,” he said. “I wanted to touch you, but wasn’t brave enough.”
AYYYYYYYYY thank you for 600 kudos!!!! That's the highest amount I've ever gotten on a WIP! I'm so happy :')
John’s cradled the back of his head with his hand, fingers in his thick, soft curls. He wrapped his other arm over his shoulders, heart thumping hard. He held him close, his chest growing heavier when he felt Sherlock hold him tighter.
John nodded curtly. “Bye.” He left with Rosie, and god damn it, even saying goodbye felt uncomfortable. This entire visit was just one tension-filled moment after another, although it was obviously worse when Irene was downstairs with them.
John pressed a kiss to his warm forehead, carefully wrapping his arms around his frame to avoid hurting him. “G’night.” But he couldn’t fall back asleep for another couple hours. John watched him sleep peacefully, petting his hair for a little while until a little crinkle appeared on Sherlock’s nose. John went still so he wouldn’t awaken. He wished he knew why the dream bothered him so much, but he dozed off close to four, and by the time he woke up, it was in the back of his mind.
