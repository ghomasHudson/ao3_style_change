“Well Sherlock, you’re in heat and I’m afraid this chap is correct, you shouldn’t be at an Alpha pub in God knows where. Your parents wouldn’t like—”
“Ahh we heard you were one of the best!” Sherlock’s father exclaims.
Before he fully realizes what he’s doing he reaches out to link an arm around Sherlock’s waist and presses his nose to his hair. Inhaling Sherlock’s scent and sending out calming alpha pheromones. Aiming to comfort him. It’s an instinct. His body just seems to want to immediately soothe and respond to Sherlock, before it tends to his own needs.
-‘Holy’, Zolita
As if he suddenly regained every drop of seductive evil in the span of seconds, Sherlock relinquishes the headboard and adjusts himself so he’s fully sitting in Watson’s lap, careful not to hurt himself from where they’re connected.
“I went about seeking the bathing room and I stumbled upon her. Poor woman, must’ve thought she’d seen a spirit. Can’t quite blame her, s’not as if I was expecting her either.” Sherlock continues.
Watson feels Sherlock’s soft lips press against his and his brain short circuits. The kiss is chaste, but he finds himself pulling the lad closer all the same.  Tongues soon meet and bodies press ever closer and soon much is forgotten, all Watson can hear and think about are the whimpers and moans Sherlock is making below him, the way the slim fingers are clasping his shirt and the glorious feeling of ravishing Sherlock’s innocent mouth.
Watson struggles to regain his composure before he narrows his eyes at Sherlock, impressed by the boy’s perspicacity.
Sherlock’s hole greedily twitches around air when Watson removes his fingers. The omega feels so empty it’s like he doesn’t know what to do with himself, he whines out in protest, but Watson merely grins, wide and pleased. “I’m going to make you come until you’re breathless,” he promises, placing a gentle kiss to Sherlock’s brow.
, and Watson
And Sherlock finally takes a sip of his lager, grimacing at the taste, “I’m not sure. I was hoping to soothe the itch--the
She’s of high stature, but she talks like a low class ruffian, he immediately takes a liking to her. They become friends and soon, after an Omega is found dead and apparently tortured, she becomes his informant.
“Temptation is like a knife, that may either cut the meat or the throat of a man; it may be his food or his poison, his exercise or his destruction.”
He just growled at Mary and not just one of those
Watson’s cock twitches in his trousers as another wave of melting butterscotch caresses his nose. It wouldn’t take long to lure the lad back to his place and stick his knot in that sweet arse, his hindbrain’s right, the boy
Please be safe out there. See you next chapter!
“L-love is a strange, powerful emotion.” He stammers. The lad folds his arms and narrows his eyes at the older man.
He gets off the bed, carrying the covers with him, still hugging his slight waist. Once he’s in front of Watson, he tips up on his toes and presses the back of a hand against Watson’s forehead. “You’re warm.” The lad says matter- of-factly. The tip of Sherlock’s tongue peeks out from his lips to wet them before he frowns in concentration, placing his hands on Watson’s throat now to feel more of the heat.
Sherlock is distracting at the best of times, the worst of times, all times, but this is simply ridiculous. Watson is only but one man, for god's sake.
. “Sherlock?” Watson calls. He takes a coat off the rack and puts it over his head before walking down the steps and touching the lad’s shoulder.
He’s still staring at the shut door when he hears Sherlock speak from behind him.
Sherlock goes quiet, but he nods and that sparks some hope in Watson. His Omega is here with him, is safe and in his arms, and no harm will come to him. “I promise you, it will be alright.” He says, holding Sherlock tighter. Then, after a beat, he warns: “It might be wiser, not to tell your parents. If you think that they will punish you or worse, put you out on the streets, then I advise you not to tell them, at least for now.”
Stay awesome!
The perilous morning after.
“Say no more. I understand that it is not easy, but next time please do not shut me out. It is the worst thing to have your Alpha hurting and to be incapable of helping.”
(See the end of the chapter for
. All through his being and even in his mind. “Thought of this so much, Holmes,” Watson says, thrusting hard and deep. The omega’s toes curl and he tries to keep it together, unwilling to come as quick as last time. “There’s not a surface in here that I haven’t imagined bending you over.” Sherlock’s gasp morphs into a flat-out groan at the words.
It was silly to let Watson hold so much power over him. A temporary lapse in the omega’s judgment caused him to feel so strongly for the disinterested alpha. How ridiculous and inane to harbor something as vicious as love for someone who couldn’t feel it back!
Some might call the particular attire Sherlock has chosen for this plan a tad...undignified.
She frowns, but then her eyes meet Sherlock's shocked ones and she makes up her mind on the spot.
Watson swallows, feeling his treacherous dick twitch in interest. “We sleep, or...we can do it all over again…”
approve.” He grins widely like the proudest, happiest cat. “I have to say, Watson, that the plan might actually be shaping up quite beautifully. Perhaps, it is true, I’ll admit it: at times, I do fret needlessly.”
-The Hunchback of Notre Dame "Hellfire"
Of course...it’s likely he’s purposefully leaving behind traces. Red herrings to throw them off his scent. He doesn’t seem smart enough to be the kind of criminal to leave red herrings. He just seems more of a murderer than a mastermind. They’re not often mutually exclusive, of course, but Watson would bet next month’s rent that John Doe is no mastermind.
Watson’s clothed cock makes itself apparent by rubbing against the seam of Sherlock’s arse. The sensation causes more warm slick to wet his pants. Sherlock sighs, he’s a mess, but as the alpha’s hands move to clutch the soft flesh and he growls low and guttural, obviously pleased, Sherlock knows he’s
Watson’s going to burn in Hell for sure, but what a lovely way to burn.
Now, it all just reeked of urgency. But why? Watson ponders, taking a small sip of his tea. If he did not intend to leave evidence behind today, then why the rush now? It’s been three months and it seems as if all he’s done is try to make himself more and more comfortable painting the streets of London crimson.
- William Shakespeare, The Taming of the Shrew
and he looks up smugly before Watson basically pounces on him, pawing at anywhere his hands can reach. Sherlock returns his enthusiasm, practically tearing off the rest of Watson’s clothes and moaning when skin meets skin.
“I shall never see him again. Except in my nightmares and even then it is not an image I wish to keep of him.” He says before returning to his litany of “they took him, they took him.”
Okay so it was a little short, but sometimes less is more. :)
One very late night, when Sherlock is in his room reading
Feasibly, now that he has some time to himself, he can also work on forgetting Watson. Trying to make the now married doctor, Sherlock’s former companion, a long, lost memory had not been easy at first but with each passing day, Sherlock thought less and less of the alpha. He’s been making headway with it, and it’s another thing he’s proud of in regards to his progress.
. So he taps the lad’s shoulder and gestures for him to move the covers from around his waist. And Sherlock, ever the obedient one, does as he’s told. Practically throwing the sheets to the side to reveal his lower half. And it is a sight, his flushed dick is bobbing between his knees, aching to be touched while his hole is basically twitching, oozing so much slick it’s practically wetting the backs of his thighs. Watson feels his knot begin to swell just at the sight but he can’t have that.
“...gravity always wins.”
But what greets him is a haunting, deafening silence. Sherlock curls in on himself, feeling the tears prickle his vision. This is it then, Watson’s gone. It’s what needed to happen, so why does he feel so awful?  “You deserve a happy marriage,” he whispers and pretends as if he can’t hear his heart breaking in the quiet.
And Sherlock can’t help it; his eyes widen in shock. He’s never seen this happen to Watson. He’s seen it on many alphas, especially during his own tiring, constant heats, but never in Watson.
Mary is in town buying roses for her father when she sees a familiar face standing outside of a shop. Silently, she watches the Alpha speak with the Holmes boy and feels burning anger arise within her.
Watson will be with his beloved and the world will continue to turn. They will have children and every night, Watson will hold his wife in his arms, loving her with all his ability. But Sherlock may never see them together without feeling his heart tear into a million pieces. No, he’d rather go blind than ever witness that. “You aren’t mine,” he whispers, breathless. The agony spreads through him, vicious and fiercely caustic as the horrible truth sets in. “You never were.”
“We need to do no such thing.”
I just want to thank everyone for reading/giving me kudos/supporting this fic, thank you so much!
I've been working on fics here and there, but life is life and it's been throwing wrenches in my plans as it does. But writing was happening, just a lot slower than usual. And then more wrenches and then less time or more time but then this or that or disaster or same stuff different day. And so it goes. I love you guys a lot, as always. And I've never said that lightly. And I will never say that lightly. A day does not go by that I'm not grateful for you guys, and fanfiction on a whole, and fanfiction creators, and readers, and the people who have this platform for us to connect, and being both a creator and a reader myself, because without this I would not be sane. Because this world is crazy, but I mean y'all pull me through and I want to pull y'all through and I'm a sap right now, sue me. xD
Eventually Mrs. Hudson, his friends, everyone stops trying, having grown tired of their efforts failing. Sherlock eventually stops coming by, having told his parents that he mated but omitting the person’s identity, and thus being on punishment until his parents figure out their next move.
But who was he to complain? As guilty as he felt for feeling this, he had to admit that he’s never felt more
Occasionally, he nods or hums, just to satisfy his father when asked a question and it seems to be working, his father is none the wiser.
At the hard glares he receives from both the doctor and the detective, Lestrade explains, a touch defensive, “The suspect has quite the predilection for omegas who resemble Holmes. It may not be a completely infallible plan, but it’s the best plan we have.”
Sherlock, once again, obeys. Doing everything mechanically, he stops when he’s stark naked.
Watson can’t help but smile with fondness and sheer adoration for his beautiful mate. Though his heart isn’t in it, he can’t say no to Sherlock. He never could. “Have I ever told you that you are way too tenacious for your own good?”
Sherlock and Watson enjoy some time alone.
Sherlock buries his head in the junction where Watson’s neck meets his shoulder and inhales his mate’s scent. It’s enough to comfort his shot nerves and eases some of the agitation from this seemingly never-ending day’s events. Lying on their bed, in their night clothes, Sherlock and Watson attempt to wind down for the evening.
They rub off on one another for a brief moment before Watson’s dick reminds him that he wants more, he takes one look at Sherlock, because he’s not sure for a brief second, but Sherlock’s eyes are shining with victory and arousal, he’s enjoying this a little too much, and he’s looking at Watson expectantly.
“No, Watson.”
The sweet-candy scent of Sherlock’s slick hangs in the air, his taste on Watson’s tongue along with the musky, earthy smell of Alpha. John unconsciously licks his lips, tasting Sherlock again and groaning as his dick twitches. His Alpha instincts are going wild, never once being assaulted by such an uncontested stimulus such as this, but Watson tries, honestly he does, to calm it down. After all, he doesn’t want to scare Sherlock away.
Watson paces across the floor of the foyer, losing track of the number of times he’s done this already.
Fair warning: this chapter gets a little sad, but it's not for shock/wow value, some things are hard to write about, but necessary. If this isn't your cup of tea, then please feel free to skip this chapter. I understand. I will update the tags if it gets too trigger-y.  But if you want to stay, then stick around, by all means. Get comfy. :D
She touches his cheek and he cringes, looking back at the wall he was pressed against and shudders.

“Sir, I’m fine.” But he sounds so utterly broken and
The familiar voice startles the alphas. They sneer at him, but they let go, pick alpha number three off the ground and fade into the darkness with their last ominous warning being “This ain’t the last you’ll see of us.”
He feels sweat begin to bead across his forehead and there’s an uncomfortable tightness in his pants. “Watson,
And it's as if someone shot him in the gut. Sherlock’s mother doesn’t stop screaming. The pain does not subside.
- Sylvia Plath
Watson stammers caught off guard. “N-not at all!”
And most importantly, I want to thank you all for reading and just giving support to this fic. Twink!Omega! Sherlock is one of my weaknesses. :)
“Something’s happened.”
“Buy me a lager first and we’ll discuss my parents later,
John, without thinking, reaches out to hold him and the lad quickly accepts the comfort. “I will not let that happen to you. Do you hear me Sherlock? We’ll overcome this, no matter what it takes.”
And there’s something to be said about Watson’s patience, Sherlock can tell by the spike in his scent that Watson wants to knot him. It’s probably all he’s been thinking about with his rut, but the alpha is perfectly still.
It takes everything in Watson not to scream in frustration. Never has he been more painfully aware of his rock hard cock than he has been in what feels like an eternity since Sherlock stepped in with this...monstrosity he’s wearing. But what finally finally
He leads Sherlock to his room and immediately starts to undress. The lad stands there, staring at him, but the way he’s looking at John, biting his lip with that mischievous glint in his eye, makes Watson’s body flare with burning desire.
“Watson?” Sherlock calls, turning around to find that the alpha is not in the foyer. He emerges a second later, coming from the bathing room, drying his hands on a towel, with the sound of the tub filling behind him.
Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise but they are all pupil. He laves an expert tongue across his abused lips while his eyes refocus on Watson’s cock. Watson watches his Adam’s apple bounce when he swallows before he replies, “Y-yes Sir.”
Shakespeare's Sonnet 65
(See the end of the chapter for
Taking a look around the room, he sees that the others have completely halted their activity to stare at the three of them. Perhaps expecting an altercation as well or perhaps waiting for the other Alpha to back down so they can swarm in. It’s hard to tell at this point, but Watson braces himself all the same, instinctively taking a step closer to Sherlock as well, in the case, that if things get ugly the Omega will have a chance to be safe.
He hurries to follow Mary, heading in the direction he last saw her. He goes down one alley and then the next, looking for evidence of her and finding none. It seems as if she has just disappeared.
Watson wants to touch him, to reassure him that everything’s fine. So he does. Sherlock melts into it and then he turns those eyes, with their color of sunlight shining through whiskey, on him. He sees flashes of many things: surprise, confusion, but also familiarity and relief. It awakens something new inside him; the urge to protect.
Also, as one lovely reader pointed out. 2 YEARS. AHHH. I don't want to believe time is real. I don't want to believe I've been depriving myself of you guys that long or joy that long. I don't want to believe in absence. ;/
Watson is furious, but relieved when he sees Sherlock still in one piece. But he’s a little shocked to see that it’s Mary who brings the lad to him.
Sherlock does as he says. The water is warm, cool enough to be shocking, but hot enough to soothe his sore muscles as he lowers himself into the amazing depths.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, instead he takes Watson’s hand and places it on the swell of an arse cheek, he’s wet—no—he’s positively
That’s when the bearded Alpha decides to interject, “Do you know this man?” He asks Sherlock.
All's Well that Ends Well - Shakespeare
He manages to whimper as more of Watson’s spill pumps into him.
- Eyes Set to Kill, 'Darling'
It doesn’t take him long to start pacing again. It confuses Watson, as he usually prides himself on his patience, but now it seems he can’t sit still until he sees Mary walk through the door.
, Watson’s dick is free of its confines, and the air of the room is like a fucking jolt of electricity once it hits his cock.
And then Sherlock is on his knees in one fluid motion.
Watson tilts Sherlock’s chin up so their lips are level. “You are simply exceptional. I promise not to leave again,” he whispers. “The only thing that would ever make me even consider changing my mind, is if you changed yours.” His eyes glow with such veracity that Sherlock forgets how to breathe. There is no going back for either of them now.
“Yes, these circumstances are less than ideal.” Watson agrees, sighing from a great deal of exhaustion.
He reaches a hand behind him to take Watson’s and lead it back to his arse, he knows his slick is probably drooling onto John’s fingers by now, if the shaky breath Watson lets out is any indication.
Those piercing deep eyes narrow at him, “Spare me the spiel doctor. Do you really think I’d come all this way to the sleaziest bar in all of London, for an Alpha that desires commitment? All I seek is a one time thing, just so these infernal heats lessen.”
The lad fights some more before he suddenly goes stiff in Watson’s arms. He screams into Watson’s shoulder before he is assaulted by wracking sobs. The doctor’s arms wrap even tighter around him and he lets Sherlock weep.
“Shh, I’ll make it better. I
“Sherlock you’ll get yourself killed!”
Sherlock smirks and runs his fingers through his unruly hair, making it stick out in a thousand different directions. He drags his tongue across his red bottom lip and then, leaning in closer, he says “The road to hell is paved with good intentions,” before pressing his hips to Watson’s. And there would never be a worse time for his body to betray him than now in the middle of an alley where anyone could see them. He groans before he can stop himself and grabbing Sherlock’s hips, rubs against him, enjoying the delicious friction.
Mary scoffs. “I saved his life, and this is what I get?”
Watson is quiet, his hold around him is firm and sturdy and Sherlock gets the impression that the alpha is choosing his words very carefully.
They were one of the rare ones. An alpha and omega who had bonded without an official claiming. Sherlock wanted to be ready. And Watson would never even begin to think of rushing him. Buggar what his alpha instincts had to say.
He’s downing his second, watching a rowdy group of men throw darts, thinking of joining them, when he smells it—the pastry-sweet scent of an Omega in heat.
? The Holmes family has been around for
“This one will be perfect for the boss, don’t ya think?” Alpha number one tells alpha number two while alpha number three is still on the ground grunting in pain from Sherlock kicking him in the throat.
I want to thank Rangerdanger and also introduce her to the crazy family of betas I have. Thank you for helping me and letting me bounce ideas off you!
They kiss again until Watson turns him so that Sherlock’s arse is flush with Watson’s hips, but only briefly as Watson bends him over, placing Sherlock’s hands on the lip of the tub and roaming his hands over Sherlock’s plush arse.
He doesn’t really have a good excuse, except that it’s a few weeks before his wedding to his fiancée Mary and he already has cold feet. And what better way is there to warm them than by engaging in a night of spirits and solace? At least that would be his response if anyone were to interrogate him.
, someone knocks on the front door.
But he needs to hold on, Watson’s not in his right mind, Sherlock needs to calm things down, he needs to be rational. Digging his fingers into Watson’s shoulder, he tries to ground himself. “Watson, this isn’t you,” he says, shaking now. Watson’s rut has never happened around him before. What if he’s losing control? What if the alpha is making a huge mistake because of his hindbrain and will come to do something he’ll regret? Sherlock wouldn’t be able to take it if Watson hated him for allowing things to go too far.
And Sherlock, feeling a tiny, insistent wave of torment emanate from Watson, his Alpha, he does the only thing he can think of that will distract the older man - he kisses him.
, Mary. What they’ve done was amazing and Sherlock will remember it always. At times when he feels he can’t go on, can’t take the loss of everything he holds dear anymore, he’ll remember that for a moment, Watson was his and he was Watson’s. But no matter how happy he feels; it still doesn’t make this right.
Sherlock assumes that they sent him to Lourdes for a cure. A means to change who Mycroft was on the inside to match the sophisticated, intelligent man on the outside. Or perhaps it was the other way around? He’s not sure, but one thing he is positive about, is that Mycroft resented them greatly for that.
Calming himself, he acquiesces, “Alright, you can come home with me; I’ll take you in so you can wait for your heat to break. I’ll even put you on some suppressants—”
--  William Shakespeare ,  "Romeo and Juliet | Act 1, Scene 1"
you?” His heart stops, he doesn’t think he wants to know the answer.
The scent is coming from Watson and it doesn’t take a detective to see that. He stands there smelling like the seaside, like the ocean and the sand but also the aroma of a virile male. With blue eyes narrowed into slits and jaw set, it appears that he’s in great pain, but is trying to conceal it. “I’m in rut.”
Watson’s mouth drops open, he can’t find the words to say.
Sherlock turns around, but he’s gone, his dark eyes, that always shine with such vitality are now void of everything that makes him,
He knows that Mary isn’t at 221B Baker street at this moment as she went to the country to visit her Uncle and right now he couldn’t be happier for the fact, though he means every word, he isn’t going to fuck Sherlock and if this doesn’t score him extra points on the saint meter, then the whole world can be lit on fire because he is. Not. Going. To. Fuck. Sherlock.
I didn't mean to spring this as the ending chapter without warning but, no worries, there will be more. This isn't the last you'll see of these two. ;)
He feels the slick leak out of his now twitching hole and feels his dick fill, both desperate to be touched.
Later, when they are clean and lying in bed, aiming to sleep off the haze, Sherlock turns to Watson who’s got his arm around him and is staring up at the ceiling waiting for sleep. He presses his nose into the older man’s throat, enjoying their mingled scent lingering on his skin, before asking, “Can you fuck me like that more often, Sir?”
Days turn into weeks and they hear no word from Mycroft. Sherlock becomes suspicious and worried, he begins to assume that Mycroft has cut them off, he fears that Mycroft wants nothing to do with any of them. He’d understand, if his fears were true, but the selfish part in him hopes that that is not the case and that Mycroft has just been busy and lost track of time.
“Please, I nee- want to know.”
He tugs Sherlock’s hair again, and the boy  groans in pleasure at the man handling. The lad pulls his mouth off Watson’s cock with a sinfully wet
Sherlock blushes furiously at Watson’s attention, but instead of looking demure, as it probably would have if he were clothed, he looks positively provocative, flushed all over with his pert pink nipples budding under Watson’s gaze.
Aided by Sherlock’s copious slick, Watson’s fingers continue their torment. Though he doesn’t directly hit the omega’s sweet spot, Sherlock’s channel desperately swallows each digit, trying to milk them like they’re a knot. He moans long and loud, unable to help himself. Watson seems to like the exhibition, because his eyes never leave Sherlock’s blushing face.
Watson sighs. “Alright Mary. I am eternally grateful to you for bringing Sherlock here. But it seems that the lad and I have much to discuss.”
He takes a step back and tries to will his hindbrain into submission. He remembers that Omegas aren’t themselves when they’re in heat. It makes them say and do things they wouldn’t normally.
-‘Seven Devils’, Florence and the Machine
Then fingers clutch at the base before those heated lips are wrapped around the head, deft tongue swiping to lick at the precome dripping from the slit and a moan escapes from both of them. Watson can’t tear his eyes off of the scene, especially once he’s witnessed the tip of his dick actually pass Sherlock’s neat, soft lips. He’s certain that they won’t be able to stretch and take in his girth, but Sherlock surprises him by swallowing his entire length up to the hilt. Damn omegas and their lack of gag reflexes. Sherlock hums appreciatively around his dick and it’s simply delicious.
Watson lets out a pained sigh. “The truth.”
aren’t you?”
Sherlock nods, but he doesn’t seem wholly convinced. So many thoughts and feelings are bombarding Watson at once, including a crushing guilt. He ignores it all in favor of comforting the lad who adds: “And what of your fiancée? What will you tell her?”
Mrs. Hudson is already in bed when they arrive; the lights are all off and if the clock tower blaring in the distance is any indication, then it’s too bloody early in the morning for any self-respecting Brit to be awake...
He looks for an escape route but finds none. Their scents are coming closer, they’re all alphas. And he doubts they’re here because they just want to talk.
The Alpha in him wants to throw the Omega over his shoulder like a barbarian and cart him off to somewhere private, somewhere they wouldn't be disturbed, but rationality sits there like a weight in his chest, making him halt immediately.
He doesn’t expect to find Sherlock on the other side, at all. Especially not at this time.
John chances a glance up at Sherlock who looks like a debauched angel. Watson doesn’t consider himself very religious, but he knows he could see himself worshipping Sherlock anytime, anywhere. He wraps the lad’s legs around his and lifts Sherlock, his hands holding up that perfect already-wet arse and they both moan.
It’s not as if the Beta gives him the chance to anyways. She narrows her eyes, studies Sherlock for a minute before her face deepens in anger at the recognition and realization. And then she says the words so slowly that all hopes of Watson ever finding his voice have left without a trace. “What are you doing with
Sherlock’s ankle is swollen but it’s nothing some ice and some pain medicine can’t fix. He tells this to his parents who are relieved to hear the news.
You do such damage, how do you manage?
“Mother, please. I’m fine. I’m a little fatigued and I wanted to take a walk in the hopes that I could wake myself up.” He lets out a convincing yawn that maybe is a little too convincing, for his mother takes his arm and leads him to his room.
Please enjoy this chapter!
Mrs. Hudson still hasn’t returned either, actually sticking to her word of wanting nothing to do with this and avoiding the lodging until it all cools down. If it ever does, that is. God does he envy her right now.
his mind wants to weep for the tenacity and willpower he’s lost, but his body is too preoccupied with what it can have, what it can fill, to care anymore.  He needs to
Tryna crawl in back for more."
The alpha blinks. “Really? After all I’ve done, I would imagine you’d hate me. That would be wiser.”
He’d awoken a few hours ago from his drugged stupor to realize that he’d slept longer than he had planned, and then, after being momentarily confused, he tried unsuccessfully to find Mrs. Hudson. He wanted to chide her for not at least attempting to rouse him from his sleep, only to remember that she had left that night to see a show. He could vaguely recall her mentioning that she’d be gone for a fortnight. Unfortunately, he had lost interest in the conversation at that point so whatever reason she gave for prolonging her absence was dead to him.
Thank you again, please enjoy!
Watson steps into the corridor leading to his room after coming off the phone with Inspector Lestrade - the phone call wasn’t a pleasant one, not in the least. Lestrade was stressed and it was all about the terror happening on London’s streets. Apparently no one is safe anymore from the violence. It used to only be omegas in danger of being taken and forced into sex rings, and that was horrible enough but now every level on the chain is a target. It is warped and twisted, and Watson hates thinking about it.
“Thank you, Mary! Now, if you would be so kind as to leave…” He points to the door.
He doesn’t wait for one of the maids or manservants to get it, he just runs downstairs and throws the door open. But what greets him isn’t his brother’s smiling face; there are two constables.
Yes, the title is taken from 'The Heart Wants What it Wants' by Selena Gomez. I ran out of ideas and I found it strangely fitting. :) Anywho, I'd like to thank my betas Abel, Haley and Secret for the much needed help. I want to thank everyone who has read/kudos'd/subscribed/bookmarked/everything. I am so in awe of the responses my Sherlock fics have gotten. I honestly feel so lucky and forever grateful. :)
Sleep pulls them both under. The last thing Sherlock remembers is Watson kissing his hair again, and the amazing, mingled scent of vanilla and salt, like fleur de sel, curling itself around him.
Watson nods.
When Watson finally speaks, his words are laden with more uncertainty than Sherlock’s ever witnessed in him. “Did last night mean nothing to you?”
― Emily Brontë, Wuthering Heights
! They’re old money darling, and far richer than you and I could ever dream. I had the good fortune to meet the Lord and Lady themselves quite a few times; they often come to most of the soirees we attend. I’ve met the heir to their estate only once but I never thought much of it.” Then, another mocking chuckle. “And here I come to find you with him. My, isn’t life grand?”
“Mary, don’t-” The Alpha begs, but she ignores him. “You can keep your ring John, seems as if I’m not meant to be married.” With that she takes it off her finger and throws it at his face.
“Why do adults always profess that? A situation is only as complicated as one makes it to be.” He states.
I've been listening to 'Genie in a Bottle' by Christina Aguilera and 'I'm A Slave 4 U' by Britney Spears and they gave me...ideas. Not completely harmless ones either. XD
Watson smirks, “You’re remarkably astute for a lad your age. You can’t be any older than fifteen, and I’m assuming you snuck out from your safe, warm house to get away from your stern parents. What’s the matter? Have they no respect for the fact that you’re in heat?”
“This is important, Watson,” Sherlock says, but he sounds more than a little exasperated. “It is our responsibility to see to it that it is successful like we attempt to do with every case. I am just utilizing every advantage I have at my disposal, as I should. If I could walk in and sweep him off his feet with my flirting alone, I would wear a habit there, trust me.”
“Funny,” Sherlock spits, taking a step towards Mary, “my parents never mentioned meeting anyone like you. I guess you weren’t of much importance if I can’t remember you either.”
And then it’s as if all time stands still. He’s waiting...but it never comes. “What on earth is going on here?”
, Watson’s brain reminds him.  “you’d be better off finding someone who can actually give you the love you deserve. He’ll also hurt you, sooner or later, he will.”
MOLLY
Mycroft and Sherlock walk slowly towards the compound as they talk. Sherlock has his violin case in hand.
SHERLOCK
"Yes... come Sherlock," John urged him in a whisper and Sherlock did just so. He threw his head back and moaned, bracing his hands on the table as his hips spasmed and cum poured over John's hand. John loosened his grip but did not let go, holding Sherlock's dick during his post-orgasm come-down while continuing to stroke himself to completion. Even in his exhaustion, Sherlock attempted to help John along as best he could, caressing John wherever he could reach: his thighs, his back, his torso, his arms. John's breath grew ragged and his vocalizations more forceful. He buried his forehead into Sherlock's bare chest; Sherlock held the back of John's neck gently. With a rough cry, John at last came. Sherlock held John to him in an embrace, and it was several moments before he let go. John seemed a bit unsteady on his feet.
You're right, Audrey. Absolutely right. We'll leave now. But... could I just see Rosie before I go? Give her a quick hug, or something? Please?
SHERLOCK
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - KITCHEN - MORNING
SHERLOCK
Working.
This could be immensely helpful.
Oh yeah? You better put your money where your mouth is, mate.
It's just infatuation.
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
Well then. All right. Maybe once a month?
SHERLOCK
Almost as much as I want to kiss you right now.
(very embarrassed)
(determined)
(waving back)
See you soon.
LESTRADE
John, taking a break from making dinner, steps into the sitting room, wiping his hands on a towel.
Shhh... no talking, Sherlock. You're too close to coming now... So close. I can feel it.
Sherlock nods nervously, looking chastened and scared.
CLERK
Eurus, dear. I already gave you your packet. This one is mine.
(turning serious)
Good evening Audrey. My friend Inspector Gary Lestrade and I--
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John is horny, like all the time now. Poor guy.
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
John leaned down and kissed Sherlock; quickly, gently, as if he had done it a hundred times before. He turned to walk to his own chair, only to stop short after two steps as the full realization of what he had just done sunk in.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(firmly but gently)
(with a smile)
(a little hurt)
I'm a bloody widower and a single parent. You think you could cut me some slack, Audrey! It's not exactly easy going out and meeting people, you know!
SHERLOCK
INT. 221B FLAT - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
It's nothing.
I just want you to know it's not you... not anything you are doing or not doing. It's me. I have troubles keeping the proper mindfulness for sex. I can't stay "in the moment" as they say. And poof! there goes my erection. If I think too hard, I tend to focus on the mechanics and the ridiculousness of it all. And if I don't focus on it enough, I drift off...
Audrey shrugs apologetically.
SHERLOCK
Hm. If I remember correctly, I was offering words of encouragement at the time.
SHERLOCK
Deal!
Sherlock hold the stare a moment longer and John yanks the spoon out of his hand.
Ah good. Now I just flip the switch.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(annoyed)
It is possible for people to learn from their mistakes, you know.
(throwing up hands)
ADLER:  I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT
IRENE
Your unwavering morals are a nuisance, John.
I know. That's why I invited Angeline along today.
SHERLOCK
Then why, John? Please tell me.
It must be urgent. That alert is only for her urgent messages.
John frowns at Sherlock. Sherlock responds with his own imperious look.
A huge grin covers Sherlock's face.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock kisses John's mouth at first softly, then more deeply.
I've known you for... what? Nearly two years? And you've never mentioned a girlfriend or anyone you're dating. I only ever hear about Sherlock.
He may never catch up.
(to John)
Stand up, John.
Why, exactly, are you sniffing everything?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock flounces back over facing away from John in a pout, and tries to butt John off the bed with his bum.
SHERLOCK
(mockingly)
Okay, I better throw him a bone...
John? Could you add a second finger?
Your Mum's not here anymore, but she loved you very, very much.
Oh, just "researching" were you? Is that why you have the lube and condoms all ready to go, hmm?
He waits briefly for a response. It doesn't come. With disappointment and concern, he turns off the lights in the sitting room and heads to the upstairs bedroom.
Sherlock... I'm sorry. I have to go faster and harder now. I don't want to hurt you. I am going to pull out.
John grabs Sherlock's sleeve and pushes it up roughly, exposing a nicotine patch. Sherlock looks guilty.
MOLLY
John regards Sherlock with even more concern now. And guilt.
Nice can be okay too.
John sticks his head in the sitting room.
John, will you sleep in my room tonight?
Gregory.
SHERLOCK
So, it IS a big case.
(carefully)
And why not?
Sherlock creeps down the stairs quietly. He opens the front door carefully and finds John sleeping on the sofa. The blanket has slipped off of John. Sherlock replaces it.
This makes John smile, giving him a sense of relief after his big speech.
That's right. Shhh. Finish your breakfast Rosie. We have to go soon.
Sherlock gives her a side hug and pulls up a chair next to her.
SHERLOCK
NAZIR
Hmm, still don't know how you managed getting the symphony tickets without my notice, though. I had my homeless network surveying so meticulously, too...
SHERLOCK
John stopped short again and turned back around. He wished Sherlock didn't look quite so attractive with the breeze blowing his curls just so.
(gasping)
You wait for him to catch up.
Such subterfuge, John. Having him pay in cash and collecting the tickets in person...
Sherlock does this again and again until John is whipped to a frenzy.
SHERLOCK
(pause)
"Oh, for crying out loud."
I wonder why that is?
SH:  I FLIRT WITH HIM ALL THE TIME. HE'S SIMPLY NOT RECEPTIVE TO IT
So, your plan is to wait around until he says "I love you" first?
"Jesus, Sherlock," he whispered hoarsely.
MYCROFT
She's not quite as much fun.
It wouldn't be like that.
(with admiration)
Audrey clears her throat. John glances back at her, and she narrows her eyes at him.
ROSIE
INT. ROOM OF EURUS'S CELL - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
Hello my Rosie.
That's what I thought. Me too.
(slightly peeved)
Must be a tough case.
John pulls Sherlock to stand under the shower head. John gets out some shampoo and washes Sherlock's hair.
Yes, I'll have the pleasure of contending with both my lovely and emotionally-draining siblings at the same time.
So, what I'm hearing is that you always let the other person take the lead.
As you can imagine, I've been in a discombobulated state ever since accidentally blurting out 'I love you' to my flatmate.
(after pause, softly)
ROSIE
John resumes the foot massage and Sherlock smiles smugly, triumphantly.
Well... I don't really know.
Scoot over please, Sherlock. Scoot.
No fireplace.
AUDREY
John and Rosie walk into the kitchen. Rosie is singing loudly.
(deepening voice)
Sherlock's face becomes sad, remorseful.
SHERLOCK
Exactly what I thought. You've changed your mind about me sleeping here. What else have you changed your mind about, Sherlock?
Oh my God!! Sherlock!
(softly)
(affronted)
MRS HUDSON
Likely story.
make it feel sort of like a date to Sherlock. He found himself getting a little jumpy, but he hoped his nervous excitement could be channeled into helping him get through the twin objectives of the night: solving the night club's little mystery
No! Want Sherk! Sherk!!
Molly chuckles at this.
SH:  WELL PLEASE INFORM THE GOOD DOCTOR OF THIS FACT BECAUSE I FIND HIS OBSTINANCE VERY TIRESOME
Fine. Where is your phone plugged in?
Prepping, Sherlock.
Clerk begins pawing through the rack confidently.
Well, I'm rather occupied at the moment.
Is that necessary?
I hear make-up sex can be quite something.
Anyway, I am happy to take little Rosie off your hands, and I can't thank you enough.
I am aware of your schedule, John. What I am trying to comprehend is what exactly you are doing in here at the moment.
(with growing jealousy)
NAZIR
Gordon did what?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock is not at all pleased John has brought up Irene during their post-coital pillow talk.
Sherlock gives her side-eye and continues his investigation, but John scoffs and grows visibly angry.
SHERLOCK
That'll be fine. Thank you.
(also hushed, but with excitement)
SHERLOCK
But it would be helpful if someone in the British government with international connections knew about it so that he could ensure that these contaminated cosmetic products are taken off the shelves before they poison thousands of unsuspecting people.
(reading file again)
Right, right, right. And whenever you'd like to come and stink up my bed, please know you have an open invitation.
Certainly. I believe you remember where they are kept.
THURS = ESCAPE ROOM?
I wouldn't peg you as one to fall for the ol' Iceman persona hook, line, and sinker. I am capable of being hurt, you know.
The kissing had been good before, but now
Here, Rosie, you can have some of my toast.
Irene (clothed) strides in and regards them with a smirk and a glint in her eye. She takes a seat facing the sofa.
John walks over to collect the shopping bag and begins placing the sex toys back inside.
Nazir nods.
ROSIE
That looks marvelous on you!
SHERLOCK
Sherlock nods to her and exits.
FLASHBACK CONT. - INT. 221 BAKER STREET - STAIRWELL CONTINUOUS
Thanks for looking out for me Sherlock.
Thank you.
SHERLOCK
I do believe the experience tonight is well worth whatever trifling discomfort I may have tomorrow.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock freezes and frowns. He slowly begins putting the toys back in the shopping bag.
MOLLY
Sherlock, how are feeling now?
There was so much I liked about that; I don't even know where to begin.
SHERLOCK
IRENE
AUDREY
Sherlock reads on his phone in his chair. He hears the stairs creak as John descends from the upstairs bedroom. Sherlock looks up as John enters the room.
And some telly? I wonder if we can find Peppa Pig.
SHERLOCK
Audrey and Dorian walk away down the sidewalk. Rosie starts to fuss out of boredom. Sherlock digs in the diaper bag.
John types out another text.
Sherlock paused before adding: NOT AS EXPECTED. BUT WELL NONETHELESS. EXTREMELY WELL ACTUALLY
Sherlock pokes a finger into his brother's chest. Mycroft looks back at him with disdain.
(slightly affronted)
(chuckling)
I knew it had to be a Madame someone.
Dorian and Rosie, bored, have pulled off their shoes and are throwing them at each other from their strollers and giggling. John and Audrey hustle to re-shod their toddlers.
John kneels next to Sherlock on the bed and gingerly moves an errant curl from Sherlock's forehead. John gives Sherlock's cheekbone a soft kiss. He follows up with another soft kiss to Sherlock's neck.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock looks surprised.
What are you going to do, Nazir, break my kneecaps?
Sherlock glares at John demandingly.
Mycroft, really.
Mwah!
Sherlock blushes and looks down at his own massive erection.
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock wastes no time stripping naked.
SHERLOCK
(snidely)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
And leave my genitals out of it, will you? Me not getting an erection doesn't mean I'm not having a good time.
SHERLOCK
Yes, let's find Maggie's missing shoe. Where should we look first? Under the sofa?
Sherlock kisses John hungrily as he squeezes John's growing erection, making John wince.
Sherlock breathes unsteadily for a few moments as he grows accustomed to the fullness. John waits, holding himself inside Sherlock, with extreme patience.
Well, we've stuck quite a few things up my bum, now. And the number of things that have been up your bum can be counted on one finger... this exact finger, in fact.
John shifts to lying down as well, spooning Sherlock, holding him.
Fine, a little quiet at times, to be honest.
Ready for lunch, Molly? Oh... Holmes! Didn't know you were here.
FLASHBACK CONT. - INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
LESTRADE
(to self)
(voice quavering)
SH: ONLY HAVING MILD SUCCESS WITH MY FLIRTING EXPERIMENTATIONS
Sherlock stops and turns to holler back at John.
SHERLOCK
... at attention, Captain.
After Mary died, after all the drinking, after all my destructive behavior, after neglecting my infant daughter for months and letting near strangers take care of her, after nearly being killed by Eurus several times in one day…
On Sunday, Rosie, John, and Sherlock stopped in at their favorite chip shop on the way home from the park, and Sherlock made certain to flirt with every single one of the staff members. John seemed to find Sherlock's flirtations with the pensioner-aged shop owners to be somewhat charming, and him chatting up the younger women merely triggered a John Watson-patented eye roll, while flirting with the twenty-something busser was met with a distinct huff of annoyance from his friend. Sherlock felt it was an auspicious start to his experiment, and left the shop well-satisfied.
John meets Sherlock's eye with an amused tilt of the head.
I mean, not really.
It's the heart part I'm worried about. We can't go around with John loving me and me not loving him back! It's a massive problem. It simply won't do!
YOU'RE so bloody brilliant, Sherlock.
MOLLY
(inhaling through teeth)
Who's dat?
(with a wink)
SHERLOCK
Then I'm happy to oblige.
What I would like to propose may conflict with your earlier edict about "taking it slow"...
While John recovers, Sherlock removes the butt plug from John's bum, disposes of the condom and cleans up. He plucks up the larger metal butt plug.
Sherlock raises his head in alarm and looks into John's face, searching for signs of physical distress.
Yes. A bit.
After the short kiss, John smiles and takes the towel out of Sherlock's hand. Sherlock tries to grab at John's wrist, frantically and repeatedly. His antics amuse John.
AUDREY
(hollering)
John is wearing his newly-purchased trousers. He moves a load of laundry from the washer to the dryer. Sherlock happens to walk in the kitchen as John is bending over. Sherlock has to grasp onto the table to recover from the shock of seeing John's arse in tight trousers.
Sherlock quickly turns it off and then lies down next to John, looking at his face with interest and concern.
John looks away briefly, embarrassed. He holds up a to-go tray and a paper sack.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
MOLLY

(smiling)
(a pause)
Ruff! Ruff!
SHERLOCK
(smiling)
"Well, keep your eyes peeled. And we'd better order some drinks if we're going to commandeer this booth the entire evening… we’ve got to blend in... Oh miss!"
(crossly)
(about to peek in bag)
Gentlemen, she's ready. Come with me please.
John yawns again and seems to fall asleep. Then he begins to snicker.
SHERLOCK
Everything will be fine, John.
NAZIR
I'm your... best...
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John assumes the position and Sherlock carefully and slowly inserts a finger with a sharp inhale. He moves it around gently. Sherlock plants some kisses on John's back and ass while he works.
It wasn’t long before John's words began to slur.
(mumbling)
Lestrade is that one loud-mouth friend of yours who is HORRIBLE at subtlety, but you love him anyway.
John smiles and guffaws at Sherlock's formal-sounding comment. Sherlock busies himself with the clean-up as John recovers. John lies back and watches him with half-closed eyes. Sherlock joins him, lying down next to him.
Audrey and John push their respective children in strollers down the sidewalk.
(yawning)
Irene: Haven't heard from you in a while BDH. Let's have dinner.
SHERLOCK
Help yourself. Take as many as you'd like. An overseas client of mine gifted them to me and I've been trying to get rid of them, offering them to my guests. Marta loves the stuff but it's not to my liking.
Obviously.
Irene glances at Sherlock for the briefest of moments before focusing her attention on John.
Sherlock snuggles even closer.
Well... have a good time, you two.
SHERLOCK
Sorry? Who's Tory?
SHERLOCK
What if you and Rosie were to move in here?
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
(pointing towards the building)
SHERLOCK
CLERK
Rosie has never been, and never will be, an inconvenience to me, John. You are the inconvenience, not Rosie.
You mean the shagging that occurred all of two minutes ago? That shagging?
AUDREY
I was hoping you would keep talking.
John dares to look down at Sherlock going to town on him. But it proves to be too much. John eyes lock onto Sherlock's beautiful blues ones, and it nearly send him over the edge.
Sherlock’s phone lit up with a new text message.
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
Yes. Every one of them.
What happens now?
MRS HUDSON
Am I? And smug married couples often discuss how they don't want their friends to date sociopaths, do they?
INT. CHARITY SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER
(pausing to read a new text)
Well, I had them in storage.
"Yes."
MRS HUDSON
John smiles a little sadly up at Sherlock.
Sherlock takes the umbrella from John and holds it over both their heads. John grasps the stroller handles and they begin walking.
Good. I just wanted to hear you say it. Last time I checked... back at the powerplant... you weren't too keen on the concept of being "a couple", remember?
Tell me about your new case, Sherlock.
Sherlock... it won't be long... I'm coming soon. Sherlock!!
SHERLOCK
(dismissing and downplaying it)
MYCROFT
Well, actually... it's passed midnight, now. So technically it's Monday.
Hello Rosie.
MRS HUDSON
Irene ignores Sherlock and fixes John with a vicious stare.
SHERLOCK
God, Sherlock.
NAZIR
AUDREY
Sherk?
Sherlock scoffs at himself for his incorrect deduction.
Very bleachy... Peru!
Bye, Sherlock, see you at lunch.
You seemed to have that little speech all ready to go, didn't you?
SHERLOCK
(weakly)
(a deep pause)
Let's start with your childhood... genius diagnosis, I don't doubt that... but this "high-functioning sociopath" stuff is bupkes.
Right. Good point. Look, I apologize. It wasn't premeditated. I came downstairs to use the loo and it just sort of happened.
Oh, she said she had to get going. Who was on the phone?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
But John certainly seems like he has it all figured out for himself already.
Sherlock's already flushed face flushes a shade darker. John eases into Sherlock a little further. Sherlock hums with pleasure. John watches Sherlock's face for signs.
Excellent. Come to bed. Bring the lubricant.
Sherlock, eyes still closed, doesn't respond.
It's Sunday, right?
Shh! How would you like to be in on my secret plan?
Sherlock looks a wee bit relieved.
He eagerly picks up the top file.
Good night, John.
(tersely)
Nothing. Just impressed with my clever --
Hm? Oh. Right. Nervous about the date... hope it goes well.
(muttering)
You WISH you and Lestrade have what John and I have!
(smirking)
Thanks for meeting me today.
SHERLOCK
(softly)
How the hell...?
(defensively)
"Point well taken. Carry on John," Sherlock said with an impatient wave of his hand.
(rasping)
For Christ's sake! I could have been dreaming about anyone!
You aren't your chatty self.
Kisses. Three.
Well... I...
SHERLOCK
(sniffing at them again)
Come here. Give me a cuddle while you tell me all about the first time you ever shagged a man.
ADLER:  HE'S ALREADY HEAD OVER HEELS HE JUST WON'T ADMIT IT
Mrs. H!
How goes it in there?
SHERLOCK
Hmm. And your relationship is completely balanced in all other respects, correct?
MRS HUDSON
I would certainly hope not.
And found none, I presume.
John smiles softly at Sherlock and gives him a very gentle kiss on the lips.
"Fine," John said with a yawn, “I'm knackered. Off to bed. See you in the morning."
SHERLOCK
John must certainly be happy, considering how he's packing on the pounds.
Good! Please ask if I can take Rosie.
Sherlock enters and closes the door behind him. John smiles and pulls him under the water stream and plants a big kiss on his lips. Sherlock runs his hands over John's wet skin.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock is tight-lipped.
John, please.
(as practical as ever)
No, it didn't.
Okay, in you go. Your body needs to rest and recover.
Here you go.
Well, perhaps just a little.
SHERLOCK
EXT. PLAYGROUND - SUNDAY - DAY
SHERLOCK
Watch out, he'll threaten to wear pajamas.
VIVIENNE
ANGELINE
Later!
Yeah, er... It's Wednesday, inn't? They're over at the park having lunch, then.
Sherlock turns towards John and smiles enigmatically.
What is it?
LATER THAT NIGHT
Lotion bottles litter the table top. Samples have been tested and analyzed: some still give off smoke and fumes. Sherlock looks into a microscope. John, arms folded, stands nearby watching him.
SHERLOCK
John watches Sherlock who is utterly absorbed with his phone.
SHERLOCK
(striving for a neutral tone)
NAZIR
All that caffeine will trigger your SVT. Bad for the ticker! At least have some breakfast.
Please don't use a small child to manipulate the situation. It reflects poorly on you. Very bad taste. Especially when I'm only trying to honor her father's wishes here.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - SUNDAY MORNING
SHERLOCK
How was Rosie, Mrs H? Did she give you any trouble?
I honesty do not remember. I was asleep! I was probably dreaming.
(sighing)
Sherlock immediately cuddles up to John, spooning him. Sherlock closes his eyes and yawns. Meanwhile, there is a look of immense frustration on John's face.
IRENE
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
See? You are right back where you were before.
I promise it will never happen again, your highness.
Do not cock this up, Sherlock.
Rosie pulls Mycroft over to the sand area insistently.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
John rushes over to put the boot back on Rosie. Then he comes to join Sherlock's side again.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(sighing)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John rises up on his toes, places one hand on Sherlock's shoulder to steady himself, and tentatively, gently kisses him.
I... I frankly don't know what to say.
IRENE
5:20, why?
Sherlock shuffles over and gives Rosie a kiss on the head and begins to make himself tea. He sits down at the table watching John suspiciously. John brings over scrambles eggs for Rosie and catches Sherlock's expression.
“I take it you’ve lied to them before.” Proud, Sherlock winks mischievously.
He feels as if he could fall asleep as Watson starts to massage his scalp with gentle fingers. “Sherlock, you had me so worried.” Comes the broken voice behind him.
“No.”
I want to thank my beta readers for the help! And I want to thank you guys for the kudos/subscriptions/hits/comments/everything. You guys make me feel so grateful everyday.
He folds his arms and scrutinizes Sherlock who is still adamantly not saying anything.
“She’s late.” Is Watson’s simple answer. Sherlock doesn’t need anymore explanation. “You’re worried about her, in more ways than one.” The lad comments; it isn’t a question.
.  He mated, with someone. He bonded. With an Omega. He
“So,” Sherlock whispers after a short while, planting a soft kiss to Watson’s shoulder. “What shall happen now?”
The final chapter.
, not bad, but different.
Two pairs of pleasure hazy eyes turn to face a stunned Mary. The shock barrages through Sherlock, making him frightened and before Watson can stop himself, before Watson can realize what he is about to do, he lets out a vicious growl at the threat, the interruption - poor, unsuspecting Mary.
They’ve never gone this far before, touching like this, but by the soft mewls Sherlock’s making and the way his eyes are closed so tightly as he’s clinging to Watson for dear life, he doesn’t seem to be complaining.
The alpha smiles, predatory. “With you looking and smelling like this,” he punctuates his sentence with a rough squeeze and a particularly mind melting thrust of his hips, pressing Sherlock further into the wall and the omega cries out, delirious as all the blood rushes south. “What makes you think I
Watson stops him. “Sherlock, did she
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul
-  Florence and the Machine
Besides, it isn’t like he needs Watson to survive anymore, he’s been taking his suppressants faithfully. Sure, he’s been getting them by unsanctioned means, but at least he’s on them. It’s not a big step, but it’s a step.
Hope you all enjoyed!
"Hello?” Comes Watson’s confused greeting.
The title is a snippet from the latin version of the Hail Mary prayer, Ave Maria. It means "now and at the hour of our death." :)
“Holmes, I don’t think this conversation is a fitting one to be having on your front step.” Watson’s voice sounds distracted.
“Let Sherlock explain.” She says. Watson narrows his eyes at her, he knows that they are both hiding something, but god help him, he can’t quite figure it out.
He takes in a full breath. “Are you certain you want this, Sherlock? I can always take you home or I can tend to you until your heat passes, we don’t have to—”
Watson's not quite sure what to think. He's not really thinking at all. His head's kind of empty right now.
“That is preposterous,” Watson snarls. “Holmes, I
Sherlock smiles and does a little wave, but the smile immediately morphs into a grimace when he looks down at his injured foot.
But Watson is up from his seat in seconds. As a doctor, he treated Omegas and he knew how scared they could be and how intense heats were. A burly Alpha making untoward advances at an Omega in such a state doesn’t sit well with him, especially since the Omega is so
urges him to move is the sudden overwhelming curiosity of what it would feel like to have Sherlock come undone, needy and helpless and begging like he is now. Unable to pull away as he’s pinned between Watson and his desk helpless to do little else but squirm and mewl as Watson’s tongue finally gets to savor that perfect arse he’s been craving for god knows how long. Drinking that divine slick as Sherlock rides his face and completely falls apart like his own personal toy omega whore--
“Fixing to sneak out again are ya?” She asks, her bright, all-knowing eyes sparkling with youthful mischief.
The red-headed constable looks away, tries to look at anything else besides Sherlock's mother’s face. While the one with the pout stares right through them, his expression is distant. They have more to say, Sherlock can tell, and it isn’t going to be good news.
plan much better, he knows that it isn’t what Sherlock would want and neither would it make his mate very pleased. Because above all, of course, he wants Sherlock to be happy.
“Are you trying to kill me?” Watson asks, because he’s entirely sold on that and nothing can convince him otherwise.
He goes to make tea to calm his still shot nerves. Time passes and though it seems to be dragging in lulls, with which he usually combats the resulting boredom by reading a book or studying, he finds the torrential panic seeping into his bones and making attempts to concentrate on anything else but bothersome, irrational thoughts, futile.
He moves away from Watson and makes space. “Come join me.” He orders. John stares at him, unblinkingly. And so he adds, “Sir.” And yeah it’s great to see Watson caught off guard by a sexual suggestion, but it’s a hundred times better to see the predatory glint flash off from his eyes as his will power depletes when he hears what he needs.
Watson, certain now that Sherlock is serious, hitches the omega’s legs around his waist easily. Too many days of locking himself away in his study without eating makes him light in the alpha’s hold, but he’s too dizzy with the rush of it all to care. Watson loves him? Can it be?
Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers' tears.
A hand rests on the small of his back, strong but gentle as Watson’s heated breath caresses his ear. “Relax, Holmes. I’ve got you,” the alpha assures, kissing him tenderly on the lips. Something blunt presses against his rim and he wills himself to breathe.
As if summoned, his mate struts in, in more of a hurry than usual. Urging Watson to stay seated, Sherlock pauses, quite dramatically, as Watson looks on amused. He takes a deep breath, checking to make sure he has a captive audience...of Watson and Gladstone (who is still heavily asleep, and possibly sedated likely due to Sherlock), before fully turning around to reveal his attire.
And...cliffhanger! I have a love/hate relationship with cliffhangers. *Le sigh* Hope you guys enjoyed it, see you next chapter! ;)
How are you all liking the story so far? Feel free to leave me a message in the comments. If you'd like, of course. I am so delighted by the support this fic has received.
Many would assume his life was perfect; he was born into a wealthy family who loved him even though he was an Omega. He had heard that Omegas - though rare, but still considered insignificant by society, especially by the upper class - had even resorted to doing devastating things to themselves to deal with the pressure. He had so much resentment for people who hurt, ostracized, or despised Omegas. Someday he’d be someone to make a difference. He’ll start a revolution or an uprising, whatever it took to make people see the error of their ways. And if his parents ever stopped being so naïve, maybe he’d let them help.
. Watson can’t help it; he does as he’s told, fucking Sherlock as if control’s a word unknown to him.
then soulbonding was the best thing to have ever happened to him. And that was the sad thing - he had been denying himself for so long, trying his best to be content in a world that he didn’t belong in to please God knows who when the only thing he ever needed was to listen to his reckless, untamed heart.
Wherein Watson gets to show his pregnant omega just how much he is loved.
The bearded man narrows his eyes and gives Watson an annoyed glare. “There’s no problem, I was just seeing this lad to my seat. Lots of bad people out there, wanted him to be safe.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to retort but seems to think better of it. Burning shame rises up within Watson but he’s absolutely sure the feeling is all his own.
The only sounds coming from Sherlock below him are
“I’m not sure you wish to know the details.” Sherlock mumbles as she stares at him with disbelief.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mary shakes her head. “Well, no, they left once I turned the corner. But I heard them! Tell him Sherlock.”
Hope you enjoy this chapter!
He could try to make some headway with his experiments or perhaps play the violin. Anything to shake that hollow feeling he gets now whenever he’s alone.
This gets the reaction Watson was hoping for, as Sherlock’s smile crests his face and the lad leans in to give him a playful punch on the arm. “That is not amusing.” The boy lies.
Sherlock sighs, seeing as they’ve only had sex once outside Sherlock’s heats and though that time was quite pleasant, now it seems as if there’s an urgency. And it isn’t a bad thing, certainly not, but he can definitely see where the rush of adrenaline could become addicting. Maybe having his life put in danger is the cause. He doesn’t really want to think, he just wants to connect with Watson again, he wants to be sure that he’s still here, that they’re both still here.
Watson places the ice to Sherlock’s ankle and he hisses. When he calms down, the doctor goes to fetch the bandages and the medicine. As he’s administering them, Sherlock watches with rapt attention. Then after a few minutes… “So tell me about Mary.”
“Well I’m not picking this lock for the sheer enjoyment of it.” Sherlock mumbles, though his lips quirk at the corners. He’s at one of the giant windows skillfully cracking the lock open, to Gertrude’s amusement.
We have reached 250 kudos! I am so happy, thank you all! Thank you for everything you guys have done! I love all the support and love this and 'Holmes in Heat' have gotten. I will never not be grateful. I appreciate it so much!
can’t be feasible, not in this life or any other. The boy—
Watson’s eyebrows raise. “Sherlock did you..?”
“This is not good. This is really not good.”
Sherlock blinks, taken aback, it’s the most absurd question he’s ever been asked. “It meant
Then one day, while he is wallowing in a particularly rough bout of depression, someone knocks impatiently on the door of his study. He ignores it at first, but then the knocking becomes even more insistent and finally annoyed, he answers it to reveal a man with dark amber eyes that burn with the intensity of a thousand suns. They are familiar eyes but the face they belong to is aged, with greying hair.
And yet, something about it must have compelled their John Doe to crawl out from whatever filthy pit he’s been hiding in to target this average, nothing too special about it, dress shop in the center of a fairly populated upper middle class area and risk getting caught only to end up stealing absolutely nothing.
That’s all it takes for Watson to dip his head between Sherlock’s legs. He teases at first, giving little licks here and there. The lad tastes incredible, better than any treat he’s ever had. But Sherlock soon starts making these desperate, breathy moans that go straight to Watson’s cock, and Watson soon finds himself burying his tongue inside the lad, desperately trying to get as much as that butterscotch slick in his system as possible.
SHERLOCK
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - WEDNESDAY - MORNING
Mm. It was. It really was.
John resumes moving the laundry and Sherlock watches him with interest.
MRS HUDSON
What? What now?
Not a problem. Let's set you up with a change room, shall we?
SHERLOCK
(wagging a finger)
Sherlock enters the restaurant, very cocky and sure that reuniting with John after having disappeared for two years will go absolutely swimmingly.
It's not a heart condition.
Tomorrow.
SHERLOCK
You are welcome. It is good to have someone on your side.
Sorry... it was my understanding that Scotland Yard wasn't going to be involved?
John adds a hand to Sherlock's erection, squeezing and stroking lightly. John's other hand roams Sherlock's thighs, stomach, and chest. Sherlock leans back against the shower door, accepting John's touches.
Sorry?
SHERLOCK
(sighing, resigned)
Believe me, this is not the circumstances I would have chosen for our first time spending the night together.
Sherlock goes breathless. He looks agog into John's loving eyes. Then he bends his head down again to listen to John's heartbeat. John wraps his arms around Sherlock. Sherlock, satisfied at hearing John's healthy heart, sighs in contentment. He closes his eyes and wraps his arms around John too.
You could go a touch faster... but maintain this same amount of pressure if you could.
SHERLOCK
Are you sure? You aren't too sore from before?
But--
SHERLOCK
No need to go overboard, John, I get the picture.
(rolling her eyes)
But first things first, some business to attend to...
I'll join you in a moment. If you'd still like me to, that is.
MOLLY
(licking his lips)
Well, you're hardly going to need me around, now that you've got a real baby on the way.
(excitedly)
SHERLOCK
Sherk! Sherk!
(calling upstairs)
Oh God, yes. The sex was so good. Everything you did tonight was... extremely good.
How are you, Audrey?
SHERLOCK
(breathlessly)
Good, you noticed. So tell me, which one is which?
Sherlock!
John looks up from his book and glares at Sherlock. Sherlock smirks impishly from behind his book and continues reading.
Er... sorry... what?
It's a beautiful day! Some fresh air would do me good!
Do you often dream about me?
(whispering)
John gathers what he needs out of the fridge and cupboards as he talks.
IRENE
Sherlock gives out a huge moan as John pushes one fingertip into his anus. John stills both his hands to not overstimulate his partner. When Sherlock appears to have grown accustomed to it, John resumes lightly masturbating Sherlock once more.
Why on earth...?!
Come on John, you'd better hurry... Vivienne tells me your next appointment is at 1pm.
Peachy.
Er… thanks?
(pausing his pacing momentarily)
(slightly nervously)
But for the record, I do care for Rosie. Very much. Despite what you may think or what you think you observe. I'd do anything for her.
Regaling me with stories about all your adventures together.
SHERLOCK
NAZIR
Not just crying, Sherlock. Sobbing.
Ever since the night you appeared in the kitchen doorway in your red pants, all I've wanted to do is bend you over the kitchen counter, strip off those blasted pants, and just plow right into that lovely arse of yours...
Okay, I'll try them on. Thanks.
Sorry Audrey! Didn't hear ya.
How nice. Where to?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock, his breathing finally calmed, lets out a chuckle. This makes John giggle.
JOHN AND SHERLOCK
Sherlock is too distracted by John's touch to come up with a witty response.
John, every time I see Sherlock looking at you, he looks like he either wants to shag you or be shagged by you as soon as humanly possible.
(yelling sharply)
You're right, John, there's no way I could have known that, although I always suspected it. Thank you for the confirmation, however.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock! Your SVT. We have to stop--
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
There's a pause, John leans in closer to hear.
SHERLOCK
(bitterly)
John laughs; Sherlock is relieved.
Molly picks up the files.
Please elaborate.
Does it matter?
Nazir waits a moment, then points to the door with her thumb.
Goldfish.
He begins lathering up John's hair. John closes his eyes with the pleasure that only comes with someone else washing your hair for you.
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow.
A FEW MINUTES LATER
SHERLOCK
I would. You are quite the romantic, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
John sits up on Sherlock's groin and grinds lightly against Sherlock's growing erection. John grabs hold of one of Sherlock's hands and plants it firmly on John's butt cheek. Sherlock fondles John's arse and lets out a delirious moan.
SHERLOCK
5:20? 5:20!? We'll never get back to Central London in forty minutes! Quick Nazir, call Lestrade! It's an emergency!
Jesus, Sherlock.
Sherlock kneels between John's legs, smiling hugely.
Shh...
Sherlock pulls out part way and pushes back in slowly and sensually. John gasps.
INT. NURSERY SCHOOL - 5:40PM
Sherlock smiles. John gives up and takes Rosie downstairs.
DR HERSCHER
(holding up bottle)
John walk over and kisses Rosie on the top of the head.
Yes, one of us having much, much stronger feelings towards the other. It just won't do.
EXT. 221 BAKER STREET - AN HOUR OR SO LATER
Sherlock set down his phone, yawned, and closed his eyes. Yes, he suspected he
Rosie darling, you've had your fill of biscuits. But maybe you are hungry? John, may I take her to the kitchen for something healthy?
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
John pats Sherlock's pillow gently. Sherlock rotates and shimmies onto the pillow.
I'll need to do a proper cleaning before taking anything larger, if you know what I mean.
Uh, nooo. Not unless it is strictly necessary.
(calling after him)
(gesturing to sitting room, whispering)
LESTRADE
An antique one no less, and --
SHERLOCK
I want you in my room even on my bad days, John. Especially my bad days! That's when I need you there the most. Why don't you just sleep in my room every night, good and bad, so I don't have to keep begging you day after day like a pathetic fool. It is so tiresome.
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
Here we are. This is where my clients spend the majority of their time when they are on the premises. But I also spend quite a bit of time here as well, and I haven't been mysteriously exposed to cocaine.
Sherlock frowns deeply and suddenly charges down the hall towards his room.
Really, John. That's not necessary. Today was about experimenting on you. YOUR pleasure.
Oh Rosie. You are so very tired.
SHERLOCK
(See the end of the chapter for
SHERLOCK
Great! I need to head downstairs to the lab... if I can just pinpoint the exact type of tea in those tea stains... won't be but an hour, ta!
SHERLOCK
(nodding again)
(muttering)
This evening... you in the rain.
DR HERSCHER
Sherlock returns to kissing John, who eagerly reciprocates. All of a sudden, Sherlock breaks off the kiss, and his mouth is firmly back on John's cock without missing a beat. Within the very next beat, Sherlock's forefinger has slipped inside John's anus. John gasps at the new sensation, which is not as unpleasant as he expected. Sherlock works the finger in a little deeper, causing John to moan. Sherlock moans back.
CLERK
SHERLOCK
To start, my friend Molly recommends giving the relationship a year to allow me time to suss out my feelings about things, to determine if love is among those feelings.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock, don't expect too much from me.
That does not, as it turns out, give me much relief to hear.
CLERK
Hush now. It's no such thing.
Me: Apologies. I have started seeing someone. I should've told you earlier.
Do you remember anything from last night?
IRENE
Yes, I feel the two of you would get along famously.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
MRS HUDSON
The problem is that I AM too much. Much too much. Too demanding. Too convoluted. I am constantly scaring off my paramours. Even Lady Smallwood, despite all her complexities.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(nodding)
SHERLOCK (O.S. OFF SCREEN)
Sherlock texts back: OK
(finally regaining his usual composure)
Yes, you have.
"Sherlock, pick Rosie up from school! Sherlock, watch her while I go run!"
Uh-hm.
END MONTAGE
Oh, hello there.
I'm sure you could have found a less abrasive way to go about it, Irene... but what did you ascertain, if you don't mind me asking?
The doctor said you would only need close monitoring for a couple of days. It has been more than a couple of days.
Ah! That's far enough.
Well?!
Fine. Chips it is. And thank you, Sherlock.
John looked up at Sherlock who now stood, forlorn, just a few feet away. John was buoyed by a sudden upwelling of courage.
But more than that, you were gobsmacked to find out how much I've wanted you over the years... just how horny I have been for you all this time, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Won't be a moment.
MYCROFT
Or, perhaps you'd like me to babysit for a night out sometime?
SHERLOCK
God, Sherlock!
A bit of both, actually. They seem to be intrinsically intertwined.
Sherlock is a bit clueless here. Please forgive him.
So Audrey, I am incredibly grateful for you taking in Rosie this evening after I was regrettably detained...
John glances down at his own outfit.
Well, you knew what you were getting into, shacking up with a brainy detective.
Very good, Nazir.
SHERLOCK
"I'll have you know This End Up has a very diverse clientele with an impressive age range. I’ve looked into it," Sherlock lied. He had done no such research. Still, he persevered, "They don't discriminate against middle-aged gays wishing to unwind and enjoy themselves." Sherlock made sure to pout a bit as he said this to ensure John felt extra guilty. It worked.
SHERLOCK
Good night.
(more worried)
LESTRADE
(loudly)
SHERLOCK
(yawning)
Does it not take you a long time to come to terms with your own feelings?
Lord, Watson, this is a foul-smelling one!
DR HERSCHER
Hmmm... a relationship, Sherlock?
I figured he was just manipulating me.
Okay, John. What's going on with you and Sherlock?
(smiling)
Here we go Rosie!
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Now, just a little at a time.
What about your scar, Sherlock? Too sensitive?
SHERLOCK
What? What's the emergency, Holmes?!
John and Sherlock sit in their chairs with eyes on Nazir as she paces the room.
John enters the kitchen and peeks down the hall.
John?
Well... this is distracting me from my tiredness a wee bit.
Sherlock whimpers.
(salty)
Oh, this is grand!
Seems like there were a lot of things that went on tonight that weren't as bad as you thought they would be.
Sherlock pulls his finger nearly all the way out.
Sherlock lifts his head and gives John a hard look.
Lestrade's smile falters.
SHERLOCK
Be reasonable. I need to get Rosie.
How does it feel?
“I understand your frustration and your probable fear, but what exactly did you come here in search of? Surely you’ve heard of getting mated or worse,
“Where’s Mary? Why aren’t you with her?” The words tumble out on their own accord before he can even think about posing his questions tactfully.
“What do you want, Watson?” he sighs. He doesn’t need this right now.
Watson and Sherlock get some time to reconcile.
It takes a little while, Watson rubbing soothing circles to the back of Sherlock’s hand and whispering encouraging words to him, until Sherlock says in a breathlessly shaky voice. “They took Mycroft.”
” Huge, dark chocolate eyes plead with him to go along with it and stupidly, Watson does.
Thank you again beauties! I also, sort of, kind of revamped my Tumblr, the link's in my profile. Feel free to submit stuff, ask me questions or both. (^_-) I love ya'll. Thank you for helping me reach this milestone and for this momentous occasion. I really couldn't have done it without you! (T_T)
Watson’s hand rises to Sherlock’s throat and he holds the omega down, thrusting harder as Sherlock cries out again. “Getting to fuck you whenever I want because you don’t belong to anyone else.” His voice is losing its control as he succumbs to the rut dominating his being.
, in your situation?” Watson questions, feeling that maybe the boy’s more naïve than he thinks.
For the first time, since Lestrade shared the details of the plan, anxiety stirs in Sherlock’s gut. “And about how long do I have to keep up the charade?”
Watson smirks, grateful for the mood lightening up. “What do you think?” He responds, just to be an arse.
See you again on the next two chapters!
in the friction. He may come just from this, but god, he can’t find it within himself to care. He
Sherlock gulps, not knowing what to expect. He knows that they have to speak about the incident, but he doesn’t want to. Still he obeys.
He hears when Watson slicks up his cock, squeezing one of Sherlock’s hard, pink nipples as a distraction before he presses in gently. And there’s a burn, of course. Watson’s dick is much bigger than his fingers and Sherlock isn’t producing nearly enough slick like when he’s in heat. But it’s still so good, especially as Watson’s whispering encouragements in his ear and kissing his shoulders.
. Certainly, he may not know what exactly he has gotten himself into but he does know that if it makes him feel this
But no, I am always here. I am usually like the tortoise in that one fable lol. Slow and steady. xD
Sighing in frustration, the alpha gives Lestrade a doubtful glare. “I
Another wave of distress washes over him along with a sense of urgency. He doesn’t waste any more time. He rushes to put on his shirt and trousers, and follows the scent to the foyer where Sherlock is standing. Relief floods him as he realizes that Sherlock is fine, physically at least, but then the anxiety comes back. He’s not sure why he’s feeling this until it hits him. These sensations aren’t his own; they’re Sherlock’s. And it doesn’t take long for him to find the source of the Omega’s distress. When he looks up there is Mrs. Hudson, staring at the lad as if she knows everything that happened and is trying her best not to blow a gasket.
The lad shrugs, “He’s my doctor.”
It’s dark and evening hasn’t yet approached, much to Sherlock’s annoyance. It doesn’t help that his expansive bedroom is also bitterly cold. Damn London and it’s cursed proclivity to becoming gloomy at the worst of times. Someday, he’s moving out of here, to somewhere permanently warm.
“Good.” Sherlock smirks, leaning in to kiss Watson’s shoulder. “Now, can you help me with this foot? I cannot even believe that I, the great Sherlock Holmes, could be caught and then get into an accident.”
Watson is about to give him a cutting retort when Sherlock pipes up, “He didn’t advise me, I came here looking for him. I’m not in the state to go home by myself and so after I get my drink, he’ll check me over and he’ll take me back home. Isn’t that right,
Hello everyone! I am so sorry that this chapter took so long for me to post. I've been battling with allergies, headaches and life in general but here I am, back from the dead or at the very least, the underworld lol. I want to thank my beta Ranger for the much needed help.
I feel her, I see her
John takes the whimpering Omega’s legs and hoists them up until Sherlock’s ankles are resting on his shoulders. From this view, he can see Sherlock’s hole and it’s as beautiful as the rest of him. Pink and wet, it practically winks at him. Watson wants to taste, but he holds off - there’s something he needs to hear before they can continue.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you for reading! Love you guys so much!
If there were ever a worse time for John to remember Mary, it’s right now. Cerulean eyes meet bourbon ones as the weight of the situation comes down on him.
Sherlock is virgin-tight, even with the amount of slick he’s producing, the grip on Watson’s cock is unbelievable. John tries to move again, but Sherlock steadies him.
I have work today but I will take the time to return to my inbox this week, but seriously, you guys, thank you for everything.
Heaven Sent and Hell Bent
Sherlock shrugs, fidgeting again and Watson supposes that he’s wet and the thought alone does unhealthy things to his sanity. He wants to test his theory, it would be so easy to just lean up, reach around and rub his hand across the soft swell of that arse—
Sherlock learns a harsh lesson about mortality
As always I cherish your feedback. I read and respond to %99 of my comments so never hesitate to write me something. I don't bite. ;) Thank you all so much for reading, see you next chapter.
Hand Over Heart, I'm Praying (That I'm Gonna Make it Out Alive)
Sherlock’s mouth falls open and he gapes at Watson like a fish. “You definitely are!” He inches nearer to his mate and holds Watson close to him. Peering straight into his alpha’s gaze, Sherlock says, “I won’t let him get as far as he expects. Besides, the whole time I will be thinking of nothing else but returning to you.”
Watson wonders how the boy even managed to get this far without being accosted.
“Since always. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll be going home. I’ll tell my parents that I snuck out to meet some of my mates, they won’t be too mad if I tell them I’ve been hanging out with the Rochester boys,” he grimaces, “But they’ll never suspect a thing.” For the first time in a while, Watson smiles.
Watson sighs. “I am so very sorry about all of this. It’s just all been out of my control and-”
For a long time, Watson does not come out of the lodging except to go to his practice. He ignores phone calls, neglects Gladstone (thank goodness for Mrs. Hudson), stops going to the pub, he shuts himself off from the rest of the world.
—Pablo Neruda
Watson’s jaw practically hits the floor. He hadn’t done anything to give away his professional status.
“I’m not sure.” Of course, Sherlock senses Watson’s despair and reaches up to touch him on the shoulder.
“Well, not quite, I use this as my torture room; it’s a little more fun.”
He’d just have to fix that.
Thank you all, hope you enjoy.
He knows that she’s probably heading back to the lodging to tell Watson or maybe, gone to tell his parents. He’s worried, but tries not to focus on it, hoping that maybe he can stop her before she does just that.
“Come on John,” Sherlock beseeches, “need you.”
“When did you get so clever?” Watson asks, mood lifting by a fraction.
“And you have no right -”
Sherlock’s mother’s face morphs into an expression of confusion. She doesn’t move an inch. “What’s happened? Whatever is the matter?”
to me,” he says, lifting his head to peer into the alpha’s bewitching blue eyes. “But we cannot play this game. I won’t pretend she doesn’t exist. Nothing changes the fact that with her is where you belong.” It doesn’t matter that he may never heal from this. That he may be irreparably broken for the rest of his life, forever fading away because the pain will be too much. It doesn’t matter that he’ll see Watson in every face and long to be with him in every moment. At least, he’ll have comfort in knowing that he did the right thing in sending Watson away. In letting Mary have all the happiness he once wished for himself.
Sherlock glares at him, “You’re wrong, I’m seventeen. Mother says I’m a late bloomer.” He looks away then, and whispers as if he’s scared if he speaks too loud his parents will materialize from thin air, “And no, they don’t understand. Whenever I’m in heat, they lock me in my room for the five days and hope for me to wait it out. It’s torture, it’s extremely uncomfortable.”
“But it’s not safe.”
of the lad and he realizes that he’s powerless to the boy’s pull, like gravity, and like gravity, he’s helpless to defy him.
John can’t help it, he smiles. “Now we wait.”
Don't forget that the final chapter will be the epilogue! The baby's gender will be revealed and questions will be answered. :) Hope you all have a good one! I'll see you next chapter! <3 <3
“My name’s Sherlock.” He smiles, and those eyes that are all pupil, flash at him wickedly.  There’s a layer of confidence that certainly wasn’t there before, dripping from every word.
I want to thank my incredible beta Deinvati for the motivation, encouragement and assistance with this chapter, thank you immensely for all that you've done!
- Florence and the Machine  "What Kind of Man"
his hindbrain interjects,
He can’t help the mounting anxiety that is threatening to consume his mind. He knows, rationally, that out of the many reasons for her delay, most of them are probably benign but he can’t help his brain from coming to the worst, drastic conclusions. Of course, he’d be better rooted into the land of logic and sense if he had gotten a better night’s sleep the previous night. Maybe he’d be a little more lucid as well, if his world hadn’t been carefully divested of everything that made it simple and was now veering off into space without control.
Once they’re both outside, Watson assesses the lad’s height. He’s perhaps a foot shorter and the way he walks, lightly swaying those hips, makes Watson believe that maybe the boy knows more about what he’s doing than he leads on.
“Are you alright, Watson?” The lad asks, concern dripping with every word.
For awhile, Watson just stares because the lad is gorgeous - every part of him - it’s like staring at a painting or a sculpture that an artist captured of the perfect interpretation of sexual yearning. Sherlock is truly a sight to behold.
As always I want to thank everyone for the kudos/bookmarks/subscriptions/hits any and everything. You all are so wonderful. Thank you! :)

the Omega, both inside and out.
- ‘Sucker for Pain’, Suicide Squad Soundtrack
Once again, I am sorry for the long wait. I actually forgot how much I love this fic and the fandom, because I strayed a bit. But it feels so good to be back!
“Ah yes, my boy here has gotten himself into quite a dilemma. Is there anything you can do for him Doctor?” Three pairs of hopeful eyes turn on Watson who quickly regains his composure. “Certainly, let me see him.”
all of Sherlock, and his mind, clinging to rationality, finally loses its battle against his body, because the boy is panting again, as if he’s run the whole of Trafalgar Square. Watson can’t help but bury his nose in the warm skin of Sherlock’s exposed throat, letting the deliciously sweet scent envelope him again.
Sherlock is sitting at the table, eating breakfast with his father while his mother talks to Gertrude somewhere in the house. He’s only mildly listening, but he can tell that there’s something different in the way that his father talks to him now that he knows Sherlock’s mated (even though he doesn’t know the person’s identity), there’s more respect there, less condescension. Although, he assumes his father never meant to sound patronizing before, it’s still a lovely change.
Hope you all enjoyed it! More to come soon! ;)
“It appears as if your heat has broken.” John states. “That’s certainly a good--” He doesn’t get a chance to finish his sentence because Sherlock’s lips connect with his with a ferocity he didn’t think the young man was capable of. Watson gives as good as he gets, surprise fading and lust filling in its place, hindbrain rejoicing as he takes control, turning them so that Sherlock’s the one pressed against the door. His lips find the bruise where the lad’s shoulder meets his neck and John bites down softly, causing Sherlock to groan and a growl to erupt from Watson’s throat.
“Now, as you know, the long lost omega mate,” he continues, still allowing time for Watson to follow along, and Watson is trying dear god, he is. But he’s only human and he’s sure his life will never again know peace, if Sherlock does not disrobe of that infernal attire soon. “From what Lestrade has gathered, he’s fond of styling his clothing like this. I’m not sure how much I look like the missing or possibly dead omega, but I’m hoping I can be adequate bait for this scheme to go successfully.”
Sherlock’s dark eyes flash mischievously, “There’s more to me than what you see,” he responds, rising from his seat before walking past Watson. The lad’s scent practically forces the doctor to follow him out of the pub and into the cool night air.
Hello everyone!
Watson owns his body, his heart and soul too, but the best thing, the absolute best thing, is that he also owns Watson’s. And that is more than enough.
. He can live with that.
And John relaxes, because this is what he’s wanted for a long time; a place where he can simply be himself, without having to worry about his behavior or how others perceive him. Mary was a terrific woman, but sometimes it felt as if he were out of place with her friends and in the prim and proper life she was trying to build around him. He loves her, he truly does, but sometimes a man needs to get away from it all.  Tonight he was going to get absolutely smashed before he returned to the lodging, sleep it off and then resume being the picture of sophistication Mary wanted him to be.
Sherlock seems to ponder this for a moment, then he says with much bravado: “Then that means I must leave.” Sadness fills them both at this realization.  The urge to protect flares up in Watson again, but this time it’s much fiercer than before; he can’t let Sherlock out of his sight, not now, not ever. He wants to protect his Omega and he can’t do that if Sherlock is no longer around.
It doesn’t take long for either of them to get naked after that, and once John has Sherlock bare and writhing beneath him, he loses it. The part of him that should know to take this slow, as this is the lad’s first time, has escaped to the darkest recesses of his mind, bowing down to his hindbrain, which is having a field day watching Sherlock.
“How unfair for you,” Sherlock pants breathlessly, giving him a soft smile that is far too sweet for someone pressed up against him so close he can feel the hardened peaks of his nipples through their layers of clothes.
How...
So Watson flips him onto his stomach, right there on the floor. He raises Sherlock’s arse up and leans his head down so that his face is practically pressed into the pillow (that he provided once he got a little clarity, lest Sherlock hurt his neck). He’s taking the dress shirt he was wearing from last night and tying an intricate knot around Sherlock’s hands, pinning them to his back when he notices that Sherlock is squirming very impatiently.
- The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus
It’s a dark, rainy night. The kind horrors start out with. The weather’s absolutely miserable and Watson has already planned to spend the evening with a good book until he dozes off in peaceful slumber.
Sherlock gives him an impish smirk. “I never claimed they were rational people, and I’ll go home with you, but I need to know your name first. What kind of Omega do you take me for?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He could read the daily paper but now it has, unfortunately, regressed into more of a useless tabloid article better suited for cleaning windows than anything actually worth reading.
As he’s coming down from his high, Sherlock barely realizes that he’s being hoisted up onto Watson’s shoulder and carried to his room until he feels the plush softness of his bed beneath him. He blinks in the dim room and winces at the contact of his wet arse to the warm bed. Temporarily distracted by the change in their surroundings, Sherlock misses the way Watson’s studying him as if he’s saving every moment in his memory.
I figured I could fix her and that she could fix me, but it never turned out that way. Do me a favor, lad?” Watson sighs, seriously trying to make sure that Sherlock understands. “Promise you will never be the person I am.”
Hope you all enjoy this and believe me I've been feeling so good about the comments/kudos/hits/subscriptions that I am on cloud nine always. Thank you so much!! <3 <3 <3
Hi everyone! I am so genuinely sorry this chapter took so long to be posted. I've been really busy with school and a bunch of other things that would take too much time to mention. Just know that I'm back and I don't plan to be gone that long ever again! (^_^) In turn, hopefully I injected enough smutty goodness into this chapter to make up for it.
“I’m not some lady of the night. I can make my own way home.” Sherlock scoffs.
She raises her eyebrows. “Believe me, if I wasn’t sure, I wouldn’t bloody be here right now talking to you.”
which will destroy me
“Don’t worry, I’ll tell ‘em you’re very tired and you need to be left alone. A growing boy needs his sleep after all.”
?” She emphasizes the word because she knows that Sherlock would prefer she say
“Sherlock what happened? You can talk to me.”
“What is the meaning of this?” He inquires, eyes flickering between the two of them. Mary looks slightly smug and proud of herself, while Sherlock looks as if he’d rather be anywhere else except there.
Red feet upon the floor
He tries to articulate this to Sherlock but before he can make a mad dash to the door, his mate is there. Looking every bit as confused as ever, Sherlock approaches him carefully, aiming to soothe his concerned alpha. He places his head on Watson’s unsteady chest, listening to his alpha’s thundering heartbeat.
It helps that you are naturally inclined to care for others. And although I'm not one to enjoy being fussed over...
Under this cloying floral fragrance John enjoys so much is...
To have you like that, on top of me, would be so exquisite.
(suggestively)
What can I say, John? It's so obvious. The look on your face when you two are together... it is unmistakable.
Greg...
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John is asleep in his chair. He wakes up with a start and checks his watch. He gets up laboriously and walks to the kitchen archway.
You are welcome, Sherlock.
Sherlock pouts, walks over, and grabs the rest of the toast off of John's plate and take a bite. Sherlock flounces out of the room.
Dorian is leaving, Rosie. Do you want to say bye-bye?
SHERLOCK
Sorry, Sherlock. That's a mystery you'll have to figure out yourself.
Sherlock pressed his lips together to hold back more cries and nodded to John. John resumed fondling and stroking Sherlock's penis, and Sherlock tried desperately to keep up his own exploration of John's, but it was becoming harder and harder to focus on his work, as his mind focused obsessively on the incredible sensations of John's touches. Sherlock's hand stilled, and he pulled it out of John's pants and braced it on the table behind him.
ROSIE
MYCROFT
Now, about these jumpers of yours...
ROSIE (V.O.)
(thinking)
Sorry, force of habit. I always rub Rosie's feet when she's agitated. It calms her down. Sorry.
Of course it will. Why wouldn't it?
John fidgets. Sherlock stays perfectly still, hanging on every word.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Would you like to spend the night in my room tonight, John?
Thank you. That will be all.
That was the whole point, wasn't it? Tighter trousers? I'll only take them in a little, nothing too risqué.
SH:  OPERATION HEAVY FLIRTING IS A GO. WISH ME LUCK
MOLLY
Well, it appears that you also like women from time to time, too.
Yes. You can hold it more firmly even... and farther down... yes, there, very good.
Would you like my help, John?
(rolling eyes)
FLASHBACK CONT. - INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
SHERLOCK
Sherlock, surprised, opens his eyes to look at John. John, up on his toes, plants a soft kiss on Sherlock's lips. John hooks his thumb in Sherlock's waistband and tugs him closer.
Sweet? No one would accuse Sherlock Holmes of ever being sweet, John.
AUDREY
John drops off the bag on the dresser.
Show me how you masturbate, John.
(gasping)
SHERLOCK
Do you think I should go after him?
May I touch it?
Sherlock halts.
(trying to downplay it)
Okay, Sherlock. Now you're being weird.
(very embarrassed now)
Sherlock yanks open the drawer and quickly dons a glove. He lubricates it and positioned himself behind John again. With his right hand once again grasping John's cock, Sherlock slips his left gloved hand down John's red pants and positions his fingers at John's arsehole. Sherlock moans deeply as he inserts one finger all the way in.
SMUT ALERT - WHOLE CHAPTER
Ack! Love, Mrs. Hudson! Can you imagine? Me... in love? What on earth am I supposed to do about it now?
Oh, apologies. I'll stop.
(more awkwardly)
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
Mrs. Hudson nods in agreement.
Er... sorry?
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - SATURDAY AFTERNOON
SHERLOCK
John gets up and walks over to stand before Sherlock. He gives Sherlock a quick peck on the lips and then gives him a long hug. Sherlock takes a moment to relax into John's hug before hugging him back.
Good job, Rosie! Now we have the carpal and metacarpal bones, and then the phalanges. Here's some phalanges, and here some phalanges...
Do you need any help getting these two tykes home?
Oh? How did he look?
(faltering)
Mrs. Hudson chuckles and pats his arm.
(interrupting, surly)
Mrs. Hudson!
He, in fact, had already lined up a sitter, choosing his favorite from the list John had accumulated (with Sherlock's careful vetting) over the past year of the Watsons living at 221B Baker Street. Lupita was a strict-but-caring-grandmotherly-type who was serious about her job and didn't engage in any unnecessary chatter with the parents and guardians of her charges. Sherlock respected a person who didn't let frivolous chit-chat distract them from their work.
Is this okay? Are you alright?
(suspicious)
Tell me about this new text.
SHERLOCK
IRENE
SITTING ROOM
Even so, I've missed you.
SHERLOCK
Something else then...
SHERLOCK
NAZIR
(with concern)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock gives John a few gentle kisses to appease him. Sherlock's hands go to John's waist, one hands slips under John's jumper.
Sherlock perks up at this, but John looks very glum indeed.
Sherlock gently pulls John's face to his, so he can kiss him deeply. John runs his fingers through Sherlock’s curls.
ADLER: UPDATE?? I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU ALL NIGHT
John’s gaze inspects all quadrants of Sherlock's face, and settles on his questioning eyes.
(to Sherlock)
John leans over to the side table drawer, extracts some tissues, and hands them to Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
(deducing quickly)
Again? How can that be!? I swear I'm going to cut this thing off.
(sighing)
SHERLOCK
Nope. Wait. We need a safeword.
Well, I'll need to find someone to pick up Rosie tomorrow.
MYCROFT
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, that would be lovely.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock moans, holds John firmly in place with an arm, and thrusts harder into John.
Oh! Well that is exciting isn't it? Anyone I know?
TEACHER
Good work!
Apparently, I do.
Hi Dada!
SHERLOCK
(hands on hips)
SHERLOCK
(confused)
What are you doing?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
A goldfish.
SHERLOCK
(scoffs sardonically)
Sherlock pulls the dildo almost all the way out and then pushes it back in John's hole a little deeper. John moans in response. Sherlock continues this, pulling it nearly all the way out and pushing it in a fraction of an inch deeper each time.
You must have at least figured out the praise thing by now, right John? If you'd like, I could provide you with a detailed list of his other kinks.
Rosie takes Mrs. Hudson's hand as they walk towards the door. Mrs. Hudson looks over her shoulder at John and Sherlock in their respective chairs, staring at each other uncomfortably.
John regards Sherlock with a sudden and unexpected soft look, making Sherlock's heart rate spike for a moment. John leaves the bathroom.
Sherlock licks John's neck and John's knees begin to buckle.
SHERLOCK
Ready for a second finger?
Exactly. So, let's talk about you, Mr. Holmes.
For the record, I don't see you as a "bad" man. You and Lestrade are both good men in your own ways.
Only a little more.
Sherlock resumes stroking John's penis in his red pants, matching that perfectly with the in-and-out movement of his gloved fingers, pulling halfway out and plunging back in over and over. John can't help letting some moans escape in the process, knowing his backside is going to pay for this tomorrow. His pleasure builds quickly.
Auuuggghhh!
John growls lowly in frustration. Sherlock comes to stand behind John again and slowly unbuckles John's belt, kissing John's shoulder and neck in the process. Sherlock begins working on the button and zip, keeping up with the kisses.
"But I still stand by my earlier assertion."
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
I feel a bit light-headed.
Spend the night in my room tonight, John. Please.
Apologies for taking so long to post this chapter. I aim to post once a week.
Then... what?
Audrey shrugs and smiles at John.
John quietly closes Rosie's door and descends the stairs.
(exasperated)
Sherlock! John! What happened?
SHERLOCK
Looks like you have one person who unequivocally loves you, John. I know you've lost a lot in life... but don't lose track of what you've gained, as well.
SHERLOCK
Mycroft, need I remind you that you have about ninety seconds before Rosie discovers you're here and you'll be roped into making sand castles? So get it out of your system now, boys.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Bring your knees up, please.
SHERLOCK
Nazir and Sherlock hurry out the door.
Only because you keep dodging the questions. So here's a very simple, very direct one: have you texted Irene Adler, at all, while you and I have been in our current relationship?
(livid)
SHERLOCK
John? Hi!
I think I've made my intentions for tonight abundantly clear... dropping not so subtle hints all day long, John.
You'd be surprised.
Sherlock continues to grind against him while stroking John's cock with the same rhythm.
SHERLOCK
Peppa! Peppa! Oink!
(matter-of-factly)
SHERLOCK
God, look at you Sherlock. You look stunning with the water cascading down your body like this... you fucking yourself on my hands.
(pointing to the figure holding the gun)
Sherlock extinguishes the light and snuggles up to John. Sherlock nuzzles against the back of John's neck, giving little kisses.
(annoyed)
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
(shrugging)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock grinds very hard against John once more, and then sits back on his heels. John slowly, carefully kneels and turns around to face him. Sherlock, the light from the bathroom lighting up his bare chest, has his head thrown back and has one hand at his crotch, lightly touching his bulging penis through the black fabric of his pants. John is briefly overcome by how beautiful he looks like this; but there are pressing matters.
Impatient. I think the word you were looking for is "impatient."
Oh really?
H! H!
(suspiciously)
Rosie, you seem to do so much better when I'm not sleeping in the same room as you, I swear. In fact... everyone sleeps better.
SHERLOCK
When you pout like this, it only makes me want to shag you silly, Sherlock Holmes. Now move over. That's an order.
SHERLOCK
I'll see what I can do.
John?
That is your mother. Mary.
SHERLOCK
This conversation makes me want to go take a shower right this instant.
"Stakeout? Sounds like you ought to be phoning Lestrade or your brother for that one then,” John commented from his chair, setting down his book and frowning at Sherlock suspiciously.
SHERLOCK
(huskily)
"No, it isn't," John admitted, with a touch of remorse in his eyes, as if he'd let loose a well-kept secret. Sherlock looked up at him with pure curiosity.
I very much wanted it to happen.
"I believe there are a couple of other things that really belong here at Baker Street as well. Two in particular."
Sherlock sat in his leather chair in 221B Baker Street, idly scrolling through his phone. It had been a productive day -- three cases solved before lunch, not bad for a Saturday -- and the afternoon sunlight filtering in through the sitting room windows began to make him a little sleepy. He almost didn't hear John descending the stairs from the upstairs bedroom. Sherlock, pretending to be more awake than he was, grinned as John quietly entered and closed the door to the sitting room behind him.
Okay, you liked the kissing, I see. So that's settled.
Twice. I've said it twice now. And I can't help noticing that he hasn't said it back.
John collects his recently tailored outfits from the clerk.
John walks over and plants a kiss on Sherlock's grumpy lips.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherk!
SHERLOCK
Onto the sitting room...
Sherlock lies on his back, his head on his pillow. He looks up uncertainly at John. John smiles tenderly at him, giving reassurance.
They peek over at the couple on the sofa again.
John is getting wet under the shower head. Sherlock peeks over and around the shower door to spy on him.
(impatiently)
(chuckling)
Sherlock sits down at the table as casually as he can. John places a mug in front of him. Sherlock begins doctoring his tea while John returns to the counter to fill his own mug.
The Watsons said their goodbyes and descended the steps. Outside of 221 Baker Street, John buckled Rosie securely in the stroller and adjusted the diaper bag strap across his chest. They made it about five steps up the pavement before John heard a voice behind him.
You kissed me.
I could lend a helping hand.
No? Not impressed?
MOLLY
SHERLOCK
"Good," replied John, "I’m glad your powers of observation are still functioning."
LESTRADE
SHERLOCK
Shh, it's nothing.
Apparently he has been suffering from it for years and hasn't ever sought out medical treatment for it.
It's Greg.
Of course John gets caught. We knew this was going to happen.
You're the one who seems confused about the days of the week, Sherlock.
Sherlock, with a look of alarm, strides away while answering.
(sighing)
I knew you'd be impressed.
(excitedly)
John ponders this for a moment.
John looks up into Sherlock's face. John's expression is hard to decipher.
John does so, and Sherlock kneels behind John's bum. Sherlock proceeds to knead and massage it.
Sherlock moves over to the bed and starts sniffing the headboard.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Well, then I have forty-five minutes to spare. What can I help with?
That's... that's weirdly possessive or something.
DR HERSCHER
SHERLOCK
Oh! Well now. That is very interesting.
John step out in jeans.
Sherlock puts on an exam glove and lubricant.
"A gay dance club? Really, Sherlock?"
John exhales in deep consideration.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
They enter the building.
John smiles.
Sherlock sits in his chair reading a book. John enters, grabs his book off the side table and settles into his own chair with a contented sigh. Sherlock glances up at him briefly. He suddenly sets down his book and narrows his eyes to scrutinize John carefully.
(See the end of the chapter for
I certainly appreciate you watching Rosie for us... WE certainly appreciate it... Right, Sherlock?
That this, what we have right now, could never ever be.
What?
(breathlessly)
(See the end of the chapter for
John...
"And what with it?" John asked.
Ah-hem. All the experts say that if the child shows a high interest and possesses the concentration for it, they are ready. Our bright girl Rosie here seems plenty ready to me.
I'll just go get my bag then, okay?
IRENE
John begins to unbutton Sherlock's shirt.
Over here... on the double, soldier.
(moaning)
Not likely. Remember the daughter upstairs.? Any toxins in the duct system would have traveled to other parts of the building and would have most likely killed the daughter as well as any occupants in the neighboring flats.
SHERLOCK
John can't fight it. Sherlock matches his stroking to John's cock thrusting into his hand, building up more and more. John can't take it anymore. He bites off his cries, moaning loudly through his teeth as he comes, wetting Sherlock's hand and his pants with his cum, squeezing deliciously against Sherlock's fingers in his bum, and making Sherlock moan in appreciation.
As John trundled up the stairs to his bedroom, Sherlock almost couldn't believe that John had agreed to go.
LESTRADE
Sherlock taps away on his computer, deeply involved in a case. Over the baby monitor (which was accidentally left on), Rosie begins crying. Sherlock pauses his typing and listens, in case he is needed. But he soon hears John talking too, so he ignores the noise and gets back to work.
MRS HUDSON
(quietly)
SHERLOCK
ANGELINE
SHERLOCK
John?
"Well, you were high as a kite at the time," John pointed out, "So there may be large swaths of the day you may have missed."
SHERLOCK
Yes, John, that's the general plan. I'm so glad you are catching on.
Okay, I tried. Now what, Sherlock?
(anger building)
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
Pardon me, Doctor Watson, but you are being a bit inconsistent with your diagnosis. A minute ago, I no longer needed monitoring but now my supposed heart condition precludes me from travel.
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
No, that's not why... I apologize, Molly. Let me start again.
Fine. You get the left. I'll take the right. How does that sound?
We had a good time. Well, I did. What about you, Sherlock?
