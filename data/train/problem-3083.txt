It's only by the grace of whiskey that Dean sleeps at all, and he wakes up with a dry, gummy mouth and a headache that threatens to turn his stomach. He glances around the room, gray morning light filtering through the curtains, and finds it empty, which leaves him free to grab the half-empty bottle by his bed and take another drink, something to dull the ache. He fishes a couple aspirin out of his bag and washes them down. He brushes his teeth, cause he's not stupid and Sam has a working nose, and spends a long time afterwards washing his face with cold water, wondering if the sink is deep enough to drown himself in.
"No, I'm not."
"Dean?"
come over and visit if Garth ate his cooking and asked for seconds.
Dean steps up to the stand, five dollar bill in hand. "Can I have a try?"
"Okay." Sam breathes out, raising the mug to his mouth and taking a small sip, testing the temperature. "All right, so I'm trying— I'm trying to find a way to say this that isn't accusatory. Because I'm not trying to come out on the attack, and I am trying to see this from your perspective, Dean."
Cas smiles.
"I think I'm beginning to understand it."
The door is locked when he spreads the contents out on his bed, but he still keeps glancing over his shoulder like someone might catch him. Eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, nail polish. He's not sure what the hell he was thinking with that shade of red, but he wasn't exactly using his best judgment at the time. The fishnet stockings are a fucking nightmare, and he shoves them back in the bag and plans to incinerate them the first chance he gets. The choker seems kinda juvenile now. He's not sure what he was thinking with that either. He's in his thirties, for fuckssakes. He tosses it back in the bag too. And the dress is…
"Oh," Jack says, disappointed. "I like looking at the cat pictures."
"But those words… The meaning is different for you, of course it is. You heard me say I was defective, and… it hurt you. I hurt you."
"Let's go ride the Berry-Go-Round again," the child's mother suggests.
"Okay, come on, work with me," Dean says into the hollow of his throat. He lays a kiss there, followed by a scrape of teeth. Dean's hands fall to his belt. Cas allows his arms to fall to the sides, letting Dean undo the buckle. Dean's eyes dart from Cas's hands to his mouth, but never higher. His lips are pink and bitten, and Cas wants to taste them again. Dean slides his belt free and it clatters to the floor. He pauses, hands at Cas's waist, taking in an unsteady breath, and leans down, forehead to temple. Their noses touch. Cas leans into him, and Dean sways away.
Dean had lain awake, not sure how much his dad knew, whether he just thought Dean was drunk and useless, or if it was worse than that, if he had figured out what had really gone on and knew he had to put an end to it.
He could say, "Come home."
"Well, Cas, how do you wanna celebrate?" asks Sam, very wisely focusing on Cas instead of giving Dean a look. Cas looks at his hands again, eyes roaming over them wildly, his cheeks creased with his enduring smile.
"I wonder if it may have been Jack. If his voice had the power to call me home," Castiel says. Dean tries not to remember a choked-out prayer behind a restaurant or split knuckles on a wooden sign, how he'd begged and pleaded and wept for Cas to return. The scabs have long healed over, but his hands flex against the steering wheel remembering the ache.
Dean had wondered, and watched the ceiling, afraid to do so much as breathe too loud until the sun rose. But Dad never said, and Dean never brought Lee up again after the last time they did a job together, and that was that for the remainder of John Winchester's life.
They find the spot in the early hours of the morning— a payphone and a woman dressed like she belongs on the damn Titanic, waving a little handkerchief off the starboard bow or whatever, one relic of a bygone era next to another. Sam and Dean share a look, a wordless acknowledgement to be on their guard as they step out of the car.
qualify," Charlie says, "
Dean's skin is so lovely when he blushes. Cas wants to remember it forever. He pats his thighs, then realizes all his pockets are on the floor, where his pants and his coat have fallen.
"Tell him. Tell him how much you love it."
"My wings inspired you," Cas says, smug at the thought. He kneels over Dean's legs, tugging on his zipper and freeing him from his jeans. Dean sighs, his hips lifting with the motion, helping him along.
"Dean," Cas breathes, and then it's a little more like their first kiss, because Cas's hands (god, his
, before he thinks anything else he can't un-think.
"Couldn't sleep," Dean says. Which is true, not that he was trying that hard. "You know, staring at that screen all day's gonna rot your brain."
For half a second, Dean thinks she's talking about Jimmy Novak's wife, when he suddenly remembers exactly what—
At the time, Dean had felt, for the first time since he could remember, maybe for the first time since the fire, that his father really loved him. More than half of his short lifetime had passed since his mother died, and really, John had been gone just as often as he was home even in those hazy childhood days, before he put Sammy in Dean's little arms and told him it was time to be a man. But the rare, really good times, Dean can remember Dad coming home from work with a smile and scooping Dean up, big and strong and steady, and Mom would be smiling too, instead of sitting on the back porch with a line creasing her forehead while she chainsmoked.
At least he got the rest of the nest in the bargain. Vampire strength, even half-starved, and suicidal rage had been enough for him to collect their heads. The women—the girls, he felt bad for. They were just kids who'd made their last, worst mistake. But the men, with their lying mouths and their greedy hands, he found satisfaction in ending.
"Don't forget the Battle of Kingdoms tomorrow, Queensguard," Charlie hollers to Sam's back as he walks away. "I've got armor for you! Bright and early!"
"If you say so. And of course I'm in no state to carry out such complex magicks at the mo. I'm just saying, you have options. You needn't limit yourself!" Rowena reaches over to pat Castiel on the knee. "Consider it, dear."
"Okay, fine," Dean says, and Sam looks so smug Dean considers taking to back immediately. "But— you have to leave me alone while I… get ready."
Castiel doesn't answer right away, so Dean looks back up to figure out what's got her so preoccupied. She's got her finger on the lip of an empty bottle, one of many littering the surfaces in Dean's room. Looking around now, it paints a pretty damning picture. The trash bin is overflowing, there's a row lined up over the headboard, a few on the dresser, and even more scattered on the floor by his bed.
There's a bar just down the block, but Dean's not going anywhere he runs the risk of Sam seeing him. Wondering if Sam is around and awake to hear the rumble of the car starting, he takes off down the highway and stops at the next roadhouse he finds.
Back to watching his back around his came-back-wrong brother, back to Cas screening his calls, back to nobody waiting for him at a home he doesn't have. Back to business as usual.
He does sleep, then, for six dreamless hours, until he wakes up in the middle of the night. The room is empty, quiet but for his own breathing and the rattling of the AC unit in the window. Despite that, he feels certain he's not alone. It should send him reaching for his gun, but instinct stops him.
"This is going to help Cas?" Jack says, approaching Rowena and her bowl. Rowena smiles, winking in Cas's direction.
thank you, Dean, I... " Dean's gonna get an inflated ego, because while he's been thanked for a good time before, he's never been thanked this effusively, let alone with his face still buried in someone's cunt. He pulls off, unable to hold in a smile, needing to suck in a breath before he goes back in, and the puff of air against his wet folds makes Cas shiver all the way down to his toes, sighing in frustration. Dean goes back to work, letting the tension build back up until Cas seems about to snap, his spine arched and his breasts swaying with every gasp. It makes a
"Nah, I'm closing."
Cas follows him out into the room, peering around at the cracked wood paneling and the dingy blinds while Dean scoops all of his girl shit into a plastic bag and shoves it into his duffel, like he can quarantine it somehow.
"You think they got blood sprinklers, Sammy?" Dean says, smirking as he side-steps a person wearing head-to-toe rubber. All sorts of hidden gems in these little midwestern cities.
at each other."
"When should I have told you, huh? When would have been a good time to share that information with you? When you were trying to kill Benny?"
"I didn't think you'd object to that," Rowena says, lilting an eyebrow. Dean swallows an angry retort. "But it is necessary. And if all goes according to plan, his clothes won't fit when it's done, anyway." Dean swears under his breath, storming out and returning with his robe, which he thrusts at Cas.
"Hello, Dean."
"Rowena… She kinda…" Sam huffs, running his hands back through his hair. He leans back in the rickety little chair, his jaw working. "There are things about me that she… gets. That most people just kind of don't."
That startles a big laugh out of Dean, and he feels like a dick for a second before Charlie starts laughing along with him.
"We don't have long before they get suspicious about the money," Sam says. "If we don't see anything that's, you know, in our wheelhouse in a couple days, I say we chalk this one up to a weird prank and move on."
"Huh," Dean says.
"Yeah," Dean says, tapping his finger on the back of his phone, pacing on the sidewalk, unable to stop himself. "Yeah. Finally."
"Yeah, he doesn't get to have you. He doesn't get to fuck you. He's not the one who's gonna make you come on his dick."
"What would you even say? 'Mommy and daddy aren't fighting, they're having a discussion'?" Dean scrubs at his cheeks, feeling them heat.
Christ.
"No, Dean," Cas says, seeming to grasp what he's getting at. "Because you aren't 'dirty'. That man, he called you dirty. You aren't."
It takes Dean a second. "No, I—not that kind of—like. You know, lights off, under the covers, for procreation only. No bells and whistles.
Dean thinks, and then he really is coming, throbbing and convulsing under Thien's hand, around his cock.
Cas shimmies down a little, and Dean's mouth travels as he does, over Cas's collarbone and up the curve of his neck. Cas is the one who dips in to kiss Dean's mouth, sweet and smiling. If he cares that Dean's got morning breath, he sure doesn't act like it. Then Cas slings a leg over Dean's hip and hitches himself up so that Dean's sliding against his wet heat, and Dean groans long and loud and shocked. He tries to muffle the sound into Castiel's shoulder.
He's a little nervous, walking Mina outside. He likes to show Baby off, but Mina's already shown how few shits she gives about cars. It makes him relish the little look of surprise that rounds Mina's eyes when she sees her.
Hey bitch!
He curls up on his side, holding himself, heaving soundlessly, letting his makeup run. The pillowcase is already a lost cause. He doesn't know what to do. He needs someone to tell him what to do, but there's no one. No Dad to tell him he needs to get up for Sam's sake, no Lisa to tell him he needs to get up for Ben's. No Mom to hold him and tell him angels are watching him.
"No?"
So yeah, being someone else for a while has its appeal.
"Dean, please."
told her why he would have women's boots, so it wouldn't be
"Oh," Cas says, the same way he always does when Dean tells a joke he's missed the context for. That's all right, Dean's used to it.
He doesn't get too in-depth talking to anyone, just light comments with the bartender. He listens in on a few conversations, people-watches some of the groups milling around in other corners of the bar. There's a crowd of toasty twenty-somethings crowded around a couple of high tops, and Dean amuses himself watching one of the guys flirt with one of the girls over another girl's head while she sinks lower and lower in her seat. At one point he tries to reach across to show the girl he's flirting with something on his BlackBerry and gets his wristwatch tangled in the other girl's hair. When they finally disentangle her, she pulls back with a strained smile and hurries into the bathroom.
Sam practically shoves Dean out of the room, apologizing to Castiel and Jack as he goes. Dean thinks they're just horsing around like they've done a million times before until Sam stops in the hallway, looking at Dean like he's seriously about to lay into him.
"Yeah, at Hy-Vee. I work the cheese counter." The girl's sardonic smile breaks through the weepiness. "Very glamorous. You?"
"Yeah, it… I dunno if it was what you really look like or not, but either way… you were really something else, Cas."
When he finishes, he ties off the condom and tosses it in the trash. The guy yanks his pants back up. He hadn't even taken his shoes off. Dean tugs his underwear back into place. He didn't come, but he feels like he got what he was looking for anyway. He's got the same deep-tissue burn he feels after spending all night digging up graves, just in different places. He thinks he'll sleep tonight about as well as he would after a few drinks. Getting fucked by a stranger: just what the doctor ordered.
"Oh." He goes quiet. He isn't sure if he's relieved when Charlie lets him.
DEAN TELL ME ABOUT YOUR HENTAI COLLECTION
"Your pussy's so tight, but you just take all of it," he says. Dean's eyes roll back and he shuts his eyes tight. Oh fuck, it's so embarrassing. Why does it make him so hot? He feels himself clench around Thien's cock, feels the way it makes him lose his pace, and there's something oddly powerful about it. About him. "Yeah, you love it. You fucking love it. You love getting fucked like this, don't you?"
"Right," Sam says slowly. "But, okay, hear me out… Even if she is, is she hurting anyone? All she did was light a bush on fire and make every day Fishstick Friday."
Dean cringes. "
"Post-hunt sex. It's kinda crazy, dude. Like,
"Keep it simple, stupid," he mutters to himself, palming himself through his jeans, not trying to accomplish anything but feeling the warmth. He stares at the cracks on the ceiling. He doesn't even have to look at his stash to summon a visual. That's a place to start. Simple, uncomplicated appreciation of breasts is something he considers key to his character. And the last time he saw a really nice pair was...
"You're the one who made me buy them."
"I'm…" Castiel's mouth works silently, trying to form words and falling short. "Just trying to… adjust."
"Like the useless shit we're always tearing through the library for?"
," she says over celebratory pizza at the map table. Sam's looking a little less peaked after resting a few days, and Dean even manages to convince him to eat an extra slice of pepper and sausage pizza without picking all the sausages off. "You said they built it in the
"Oh, absolutely goddamn not. He would've disowned you."
"What are you? What
"Fine, whatever," he says. He pockets his gun, brushing Cas off when she goes to touch his shoulder and storming back out into the shop. "Trust the witch. It's on your ass when it goes south."
"Yes. I woke up at four, but you slept through the television show about the rotisserie oven."
"Mmm. No," Cas says, and kisses his forehead. Ice cold grace spreads out from his brow, taking away the unclean sheen of sweat and everything else that had been clinging to him. Dean snorts, pulling back from Cas to stare down at him.
"Jesus." Sam stares up at the ceiling, blinking rapidly. "How did I not know this?"
A thought forms, cruel in its simplicity:
Pleeeeease tell me you and Sam will come?
His attention falls on a girl who fits the profile. A little shadowed under the eyes, pretty, but fragile, and a sunken-cheeked twerp with a popped collar whispering in her ear and leading her outside. Dean abandons his empty glass, sends Sam a text, and follows them at a comfortable distance.
"'67 Chevy Impala," Dean answers, and Mina nods politely like that means anything to her.
"Samuel, dearest, you should know better than to think something piddly like dying means anything to me, by now." A finely manicured hand reaches up to toy with a short lock of hair behind her ear. "I
"Oh dear," Rowena says. "Well, then, I am sorry." She sits still in the tense silence for a while before she adds, "But, you know, if you ever wanted to fix that little problem…"
Cas blinks, lifting his hand slowly, like his joints have rusted from disuse. He spreads his fingers in front of him, and Dean can see his eyes widen at the broad span of them. Cas's eyes trail up his thick arms, down over the sparse hair of his chest. He stops there, and Dean looks down to follow him as he lifts his arm to find the Enochian ward tattooed across his ribs.
"There is nothing at all funny about this," Dean says, wiping his eyes. "Fuck me running. This is so not funny."
Benny. Like he wasn't usually president of the
"You can have it. It's okay," Cas murmurs.
"Oh," Dean says, and the sound is lost in the press of Castiel's mouth to his.
"What? I saw it on the Food Network," he says, and spears another potato with his fork.
He sees Castiel's chest rise and fall slowly once before he nods, face stern, steeling himself. Then, after a pause, Rowena begins to chant.
Something bursts within him, white hot, and without him as well, flooding the little room with light and sound, the pop and burn of a dozen fuses. Cas comes, half into Dean's open mouth, but misses just as much, marking his flushed face with white. There's a stripe across his cheek, interrupting the constellation of his freckles, and some escapes his mouth, dribbling over his lips and chin. He swipes his tongue across it, trying to take more. Still hungry. Cas's cock throbs and pulses a few more weak gushes onto Dean's waiting tongue. Dean laves his tongue over the softening head until there's nothing left. Then, through the blissful haze Cas finds himself in, he realizes that it's gotten dark, and that Dean is laughing, low and rough under his breath.
"Enlighten me, then."
"Shut up," Dean mutters. "Don't give me some after-school special crap. You basically had to hold me at gunpoint."
But now Sam is back, and it's still not right. He's still not happy. He misses Lisa, misses Ben, and he shouldn't miss Sam, because he's right there, just a few hours down the road if he decides to make the trip, but he does. Maybe Sam's been distant because he can't forgive Dean. He won't talk about Hell, and maybe that's because he still blames Dean for letting him fall.
"What? You look good!" Sam says, and ducks away from Dean when he takes a swipe at him. He shoves his phone into his back pocket. "Don't worry, I won't show anyone. Except Bobby."
"Yeah, no problems. Jody and the girls are fine. Cas asked me to, uh, call them up, see if he could go visit with Claire." He runs a hand through his hair, sighing. "Jody's never spoken to Cas in person before, I don't think she was expecting to meet him like this, but now they know… you know, what to expect."
"Because when you're happy, your soul shines brighter, golden and warm and beautiful, and you shine into all the cracks in me." Cas kisses him, holding him, while his breath stutters and his hips move, lifting up from the bed to meet the tight circle of his fist. "Maybe that sounds silly to you, but I don't know how else to explain it."
them, no, but he's got this body for the time being. Might as well enjoy it a little, right?
They wanted a monster? They got one.
"Hey, you're up," he says, looking harried. Dean gives him an
Cas doesn't answer. He doesn't move. He looks like a statue, sitting there in that chair and gazing up at him, carved from marble, like one of the ones about saints seeking mercy or benediction.
"We gotta leave sometime, Cas. I have to eat," Dean says. "I have to piss."
Dean sinks bonelessly into the sagging mattress, trying to catch his breath. His skin is still flushed and red, all across his face and down to the purple mark on his neck. The hem of his black shirt is stained, and his softening cock rests against his stomach, over the band of his boxers. Cas wants to take another picture, but he doesn't know if Dean will be as permissive in this instance. Cas's hand is sticky with Dean's come. He licks his palm, then sucks each of his fingers into his mouth, swallowing whatever he can. Now part of Dean is inside him as well. It's a pleasing thought.
He's about to order another to go with his food as it arrives when someone over his shoulder says, "I like a woman who can eat."
"It was your favorite!"
. This is him and
"Hadn't met you." Cas says it so simply, like it's the key to everything. Dean's heartbeat thuds in his ears.
"—happy! Shutting up again. I will never speak another word on it. You giant baby."
That leaves…
"You thought being angry made your dick hard?"
"Yeah?" Dean's stomach flutters again. He knows how to follow this script as a man, but he's not sure that still applies here. Is she asking if he needs to use her bathroom?
The rating has gone up and the tags have been updated accordingly. :) This chapter also got kind of long! oops! whoopsie! uh oh!
Dean breathes in slow, trying not to look as freaked as he feels. At least if he gets taken in, they probably won't match him to his existing arrest warrants, looking the way he does.
"It's fine," Dean says. "We gonna be studying?"
He grabs his clothes, does what he needs to, washes his hands. Redresses. He looks at himself, trying to remember how he felt, seeing himself in the mirror after Rhonda was done with him. Pink and glowing. Soft as satin. Round edges made malleable where he had been hard.
"It's just for Farmville," Dean says, and shoves the last bite of burger into his mouth. Sam rolls his eyes, his shoulders hunched over the little two-seater motel table.
"So, what, you just want to let her get off scot-free?"
Castiel's expression softens, his eyes scanning Dean's face. He reaches up to wipe a droplet of water from Dean's stubbled chin. Dean swallows.
want to, and she's strong enough to control it—that's the hot part."
Charlie says, into his collar, "Yeah. Maybe," and then she's gone.
"Holy shit," Dean coughs. "That was fucking awesome."
But to know the truth might make him do something stupid, like hope, and that's one thing he know he can't afford, so he doesn't ask, and Cas doesn't say, and they sit there in the quiet pretending.
Within a moment, Cas has withdrawn, and he pets Dean's hair, holding his cheek and wiping tears from his wincing eyes. "Dean, I'm sorry—"
It still feels different. And Cas left. He flew off without a word. Maybe he's just busy, like he always is. Or maybe this was just a step too far. Maybe he really was frozen in terror, a deer in Dean's headlights. Maybe Dean won't see him for another year after this. Or ever again.
So yeah, after a week of that, Cas steps into the library, and Dean looks up from the laptop, where he's been skimming the news for jobs, and does a double-take.
"Yeah," Mina says, borderline defensive. "Why?"
"How did you know that?"
He spends the rest of the afternoon tending to Baby, getting under her hood to make sure everything's tip-top and giving her a good wash and rinse when he's through. Maintaining a car is practically a meditative state for Dean, down to the mechanical simplicity of the fact that all the parts in front of him make sense, that all problems are ultimately solvable. When he's done, he offers to pick up takeout from the Chinese place a town over just for an excuse to be alone a while longer, and when he brings back two heavy paper bags full of food, he grabs the carton of beef lo mein and takes it back to his room without a second thought.
"Were you the one who caused the 'miracles'?" Jack asks. Tears track their way down Haleigh's cheeks when she nods.
"The one in Miami?"
"Dean,
Dean releases her hand to tuck her hair behind her ear, trying to see her face. She keeps her head tilted down, gazing at her feet on the linoleum.
He scans the pantry. He's got stacks and stacks of soup cans, because they stay good for years, and Dean figures they're good to have in an emergency. This definitely qualifies. He's got two cans of Campbell's tomato-rice, the kind their mom used to make for Dean when he was little. Dad was the one who, in later years, added whatever else they had lying around, whether that be other cans of soup or leftover takeout cartons of stir-fried vegetables, to make it stretch further. And Dean did it just the way their father had done in his memory, dumping condensed soup out into the pot and following that with two canfuls of tap water and whatever spices they had on hand to dress it up. Packets of red pepper flakes always went a long way in the past. Dean doesn't have any of those, but he does have powdered garlic and cayenne. That's bound to help Sam clear out that cough of his, right?
"You probably don't need me to give you a lecture about being careful, huh?" She looks over at him, stern lines at the corners of her mouth.
"You cannot fucking show that picture to Bobby," Dean growls. His face burns, not the least because he's dismayed by how much he likes the damn choker. If Bobby sees him looking like this, he'll never be able to look the man in the eye again. "I swear to god, if you show that picture to Bobby, I'll superglue your asscheeks together."
It's not that it isn't good. He knows it's good, has figured out himself how to make it good, and by all definitions, he should be tipping overboard by now. But he's not. He's hitting that same frustrating wave of diminishing returns, and all the low and pulsing want he'd been feeling recedes.
Dean startles when the sound of cracking fills the air, and his hand tightens on Jack's. The pale shell encasing Cas begins to split, long fissures snaking over his arms, over his chest. The shell expands, the sounds growing louder and more frequent. Light, green and gold and blue, spills out, dancing on the concrete walls, shining into Dean's eyes and making him squint away. He tries not to close them.
"Oh." Sam shuffles in place, thrown off-balance. "Well, uh… Good, then. That's good."
"What kind of car is that? It looks old. Oh, not like— not
Dean's eyes narrow. Sam holds his hands up in surrender, turning on his heel and walking out before Dean can argue with him.
While Dean's lying down, Sam sets the NyQuil on the table and leaves. Dean's not really sick, but he takes some anyway just so he can get some shut-eye, brushing his teeth to get the awful, syrupy taste out of his mouth.
"Yes. Here. I didn't want to ask Claire if she'd allow me to take that form again. I didn't think I had any right, after everything she'd been through. But she understood what I was feeling. What I wanted. Now… I'm not sure I want it anymore. Perhaps it doesn't matter as much as I thought it did."
hot."
. The overhead light flickers back on a moment later.
"You don't have to participate if you're uncomfortable, Jack," Cas says. Jack looks back, eyes lowering in thought before he meets his eyes again.
was young, I guess. But that's… That's just an excuse, I know, I'm not a complete idiot, okay?"
Of course, long story short, they end up tied to the floor in a Truth Goddess's own personal slaughterhouse. Just their fucking luck.
Dean goes. He goes until he's close enough to smell Castiel, the liquor on his breath, woodsmoke and stale sweat. Water is a precious resource, bathing a luxury, but after a few years of that, you get accustomed to the smell of unwashed bodies. Castiel takes his hand again, peels his fingers apart, and folds the handle of the knife into them, then cradles Dean's fist like it's precious.
"Cas?"
"'Sup to you." Dean holds the bottle out towards her with a shrug. She looks at him a moment, then takes it, bringing the bottle to her lips and taking a generous sip. She lets it sit in her mouth a moment, then swallows. The shine it leaves on her lips catches the glint of the streetlights in the parking lot. She hands the bottle back to Dean, her head canting to the side. "Well?"
"Your transformation! I have to say, I'm very happy for you. You must know how I've always felt a kinship with other powerful women."
Sam clears his throat loudly, and Dean spins on his heel, putting some space between him and Cas. Sam has Rowena wrapped up in a towel, her hair sodden, her makeup tracking down her cheeks in stark black lines. She looks absolutely miserable, and another day Dean might laugh at that, but he's feeling a little too flayed-open to find his sense of humor. Jack is hovering nearby, and Dean pats him on the shoulder once, gruff in his affection.
Taking it slow over the gravel drive, he parks a good distance from the leaning structure of Bobby's house, among the gutted frames of junked cars. No lights are on inside. He slips in the back, creeps his way up the stairs, the house settling around him. He locks the door of the bathroom behind himself. The red dress crumples to the floor like discarded Christmas paper. He boils himself in the shower and lets all the black drip down his cheeks, onto his chest and belly, trickling down his silky smooth legs and down the drain. He feels purified, like sucking poison out of a snakebite.
"Uh."
He's such a joke. He'd been happy with Lisa, sometimes. He really had. But the whole time, he'd been walking around like he was missing a limb, because Sam was dead, and who was Dean without Sam? Ben reminded him terribly of Sam as he'd been when they were kids, too smart for his own good with a finely-tuned bullshit-o-meter. The time Dean had told Ben to eat his green beans and Ben had fired back, "Why, so you don't have to?" Dean had to fight not to laugh while Lisa chastised him. Sometimes that familiarity comforted him, made him feel like he still had an important job to do. Other times, he wondered who he was to think he had the right to pretend to be that kid's dad. He'd let Sam down. He'd let him die. What greater failure could there be?
Dean reaches over, ruffles her hair, and she shoves him away, snorting.
," Charlie says, lifting her eyebrows at him. "And put your own stamp on it. Cause people like us, we don't really get to be the big damn heroes super often." Dean looks at her sharply, fighting off a sweat until she elaborates and it doesn't sound quite so much like she means
I don't."
Sam peers curiously at Dean. "No fix yet?"
"Is everything… you know—"
In the morning, Dean rolls over, slapping the side-table blindly until he finds the bottle, and the glass. Cas, from the chair by the window, watches him drink, spilling water from the corners of his mouth and wetting his shirt. Sam, already awake, is showering in the bathroom. Dean blinks at him, bleary-eyed and cranky.
"Done what?" Sam keeps his voice low, but his frank disbelief is evident. "Cas is dead. We burned him. He shouldn't be able to…"
"He might find a way to make time if he knows you're in trouble."
, and Dean is finally asking. Dean wants this, wants
"Well, shit, pal," Dean says. "That's just tragic."
He hears Cas shifting, and then there's a soft hand stilling his, replacing his, wetness and warmth. A tremor goes through him, and then Cas starts to pump him in his fist, slow at first, then faster, steady, trying to match the pace Dean had started. Dean braces his feet against the bed, grasping Cas's hip in one hand, twining their fingers together with the other. Cas moves so that when Dean's head falls back, he's bracketed by Cas's shoulder, and Cas holds him like that, working his cock until Dean's panting, open-mouthed and light-headed.
"No. Fuck no." Dean's had his fun, and now he's done with all that. Hell, he should have thrown it all in the trash, the makeup, the dress, everything. It's all stuffed into a plastic bag and burning a hole in the bottom of his duffel.
"I don't know. It's just a little quiet, I guess. Cas has been gone, and all Jack and Rowena have been doing is binge-watching
"Necessary," Rowena corrects.
He shoves them, and the makeup, under a pile of socks in his dresser.
"Besides the tits?" Bobby looks at Dean with the unimpressed exhaustion that develops only after someone's known you so long they still remember cleaning up after you pissed the bed when you were seven. "No, not that I noticed."
"Yeah, because I'm an adult man and not a thirteen year old girl at Starbucks," Dean scoffs, and sips his coffee. He holds Charlie's stare while he does it, willing himself not to blink. Yeah, it's bitter. It's
Dean thinks.
They drop Haleigh off quietly, about a block away from her house, so she can sneak back in without being caught. She cooperated with a firm but gentle request to delete some of her videos and to surrender the spell book. Jack's got the name of a magic shop in Indianapolis on a scrap of paper. He traded it for his phone number, which is actually just Cas's phone number, since Jack doesn't have one of his own yet, but Haleigh's promised to give them a call if she's ever in real trouble.
Mina folds up the slip of paper, sliding it into a book on her side table. "Yeah, sure," she says, holding her lower lip between her teeth. "Um… thanks."
Cas sighs, like he's finally gotten tired of entertaining Dean. Panic rises in his chest. He just wants Cas to stay a while longer. They're having fun. They're laughing, or at least Dean is. He hasn't laughed in ages. He won't bug Cas with questions about Sam, or questions about the war, or questions about why he can't be bothered to find time for him anymore as long as Cas
Dean's hands grasp Castiel beneath his coat, pulling him closer so he can crush his whole body to Dean's while he kisses him. Castiel only breaks away to throw his leg over Dean's lap, going up on his knees to bend down to kiss him again. "When I found you, you were in pieces. They'd stamped you out to embers, trampled you down, and I held you, this… flickering little soul," Castiel whispers, pressing kisses to Dean's jawline, "and I saw your death, and your life, all the ways it had tried to douse your fire, and you were so
. Which is maybe part of the problem.
Dean and Sam eat a gas station burrito and a gas station granola cup, respectively, and wait while Castiel selects a new uniform, which turns out to be pretty close to her old standard: sensible slacks and a blazer, sensible shoes, a white button-up, presumably some underwear more suited to this century, and a beige coat to complete the ensemble. For all that she's Heaven's little rebel, Cas really is a creature of habit. She comes out of the store with an overfull bag, still wearing Dean's overlarge shirt, apparently perfectly content to head all the way home before giving Dean his damn pants back.
Fellatio is not Castiel's favorite act. Not that it’s unpleasant, to have his dick in Dean's mouth. Quite the opposite. But there has always seemed something distant about it, limiting the points of contact between himself and Dean. Everything between them is still new, and Cas wants everything, wants to try everything, can hardly stand to stop touching him once they’re alone and he’s allowed to. Kissing Dean is his favorite thing in the world, and a moment spent not kissing him felt almost like a waste, until now.
Dean gives her a look that could peel paint.
tucked into the middle row, front and center. He sets his beer down and goes to have a closer look. The spine is cracked and nearly illegible, but he can still pick it out. He spent enough time reading it over the years. All those books are just ash now, Dean thinks. He reaches out with one finger to pull it out.
"You doin' okay? I thought you'd be…"
"What?" Dean looks up at the guy who is currently inside of him, who, rather than pissed off, or embarrassed, or anything rational, just looks kind of curious.
"Jack never saw you in person before, though, right, Cas?" asks Sam.
Dean coughs out a humorless laugh. "I kinda am."
"Yeah. You want this fat cock?" It should sound stupid, this garbage porno talk, but Dean's answering without thinking,
"And the spell made you look like…"
an asshole," Cas says firmly.
"I dunno." Dean shrugs, worrying at a loose thread on his sleeve. "Young, pretty hot, if you go for the 'Kill All Men' type. Like a solid eight outta ten."
He feels stupid for it, but fuck, he misses Cas.
me?" Rowena huffs a voiceless laugh. Her arm moves, and Dean raises the gun in his hand on instinct, but she doesn't cast. She reaches down slowly and deliberately, grasping something by her feet, propped against the arm of the chair— a cane, black with gold trim— and pushing herself to standing. Rowena's arm begins to tremble with effort. Her feet haltingly anchor her to the floor, knees threatening to buckle underneath her. Her knuckles are white, the skin thin where she grips the handle. Dean hears Sam breathe in sharply when she begins to flicker, like a TV signal going out. One moment, she's resplendent in royal purples. The next, she's pale and gray. The shadows under her eyes are pronounced, her face clean of makeup. When she reaches her full height, she looks very small in the cramped room. "Look at me. Look at what he's made of me. Would you call it hunting to kill an animal caught in a trap, wasting away?"
Dean freezes mid-step. He leans over on Baby's frame. "Uh. Okay."
"Okay," Jody says.
The guy moves. Dean moves with him.
"Frances Krawczyk died of Spanish Influenza in 1918 and was buried in a mass grave in New York. It doesn't track, given where I… woke up. All I know is that I
to be the girl? Or the guy? Or whatever."
He dips his middle finger inside himself, not too far, just to the first joint. He feels around a little. Should he have a hymen or something? Is that a myth? He's got his tattoo, so obviously the body isn't
"You see the—" Dean starts to say, but Sam interrupts him,
Dean proceeds to methodically construct a ham sandwich the size of his head in utter silence. Castiel does follow him into the kitchen after a moment, sitting at the little table and watching Dean putter away, like she honestly has nothing better to do. She watches him check the bread for mold and staleness, watches him take half the contents of the fridge out and clutter the countertops. Dean slathers one slice of bread with mayonnaise and two with mustard; lettuce, tomato, thin-sliced red onions, deli ham, and swiss cheese are stacked and pressed into two tiers. The sandwich is sliced diagonally into two triangles, a picture-perfect cross-section.
First order of business is getting the layout of the bunker down, though. He's already claimed a bedroom—he tested all the mattresses, because he knows how to live, and whoever had the room Dean's set up shop in did too.
Jack calls his name a couple of times. Dean keeps adding to his tray.
"Fuck," he mutters emphatically. "Fuck, fuck,
Cas, an angel with all the power that entails, does not need to shower, but that's apparently no deterrent. While the others clean up after the spell, Castiel goes upstairs to indulge his desire to use up all the hot water, plus Dean's ocean breeze scented body wash. He spends a solid hour in there, and when he knocks on Dean's door his hair is still damp and tousled from the clean bath towel draped over the shoulders of Dean's robe.
Sam said something happened with a friend of yours?
Cas approaches when it's just getting dark. Her hair is loose around her shoulders. She must have let it down while the weird little family vacation they've got going was watching TV upstairs. Dean kind of wants to get his hands in it. He buries the urge by shoving a hand in his pocket and taking another swig.
Thien fills him up slowly while Dean shudders around him, gripping the sheets, his own thigh, anything to brace himself. Then he's fucking him, really fucking him, moving him against the bed and fucking all kinds of desperate noises from him.
than I do, now. Pretty sure he just misses his… you know, his dad."
"Well, maybe this isn't your body forever, Castiel, but it is your body
"But you said it
"Said a lot of stuff last night, a'course," Dean mumbles, letting his mouth press against Castiel more deliberately. Cas sighs faintly above him, and his arms wrap more closely around him, which has the very positive side effect of pressing his breasts against Dean's cheek. "I might need to, uh…" Dean turns his head to press a lazy kiss to one hardening nipple. "...wake up a little more, first."
"He, uh," Dean says, his throat sticking. "He called me a fag."
"Maybe lunch first," Dean says. He's known Bobby long enough to know how bad he is at remembering to eat. The guy's eyeing the liquor cabinet, but he probably hasn't even had breakfast yet. Bobby grumbles, but goes willingly when Dean just starts rummaging through his cabinets for something to throw together. They eat chili mac and cheese, a tried and true staple of Dean's laundry list of ways to make boxed mac and cheese and canned chili more exciting, and while it's nothing to write home about, Dean can see Bobby's grouchiness draining away as he eats. He'll always be a grouch, of course, but there are flavors to his grouchiness, and hangry isn't a good one.
Holy crap! How'd that go?
"No, not lying, just… talking
"The tech in this place is
"Is this, like, a cuckolding thing? Am I cucking this dude right now?"
—being with you this way, too, it… it definitely has its—
I gotta hide them from Sam though he's thinks it's porno
"Band kids fuck," Dean says, shaking his head. Gwen sputters, spraying his cheek with beer. Dean wipes it off on his sleeve with a grimace. "I'm dead serious. No high schooler is more sexually active than a Band geek. Believe me, I've been to a lot of high schools. They're all playing each others' trumpets all the time."
Dean gives Cas his best
"Do you think she's okay?" Sam asks after she goes. He's slowed down, nursing a beer that he probably intends to be his last for the night.
"But it's not…" Cas continues, pausing in frustration at the limitations of language. "...it isn't based in violence for you. Maybe it came out of that, but that's not what it's about."
"That supposed to hurt my feelings?"
"Yeah, all right," Dean says dismissively, and closes the door behind him.
"Right, sure," Dean says. A few moments later, he fires back with, "But like, what if someone
He dresses more like himself to see Bobby, but even then, when he tromps in without knocking and yells out, "Bobby, it's Dean," and Bobby comes around the corner from the kitchen, Dean can see the way his eyes go round at the sight of him. He looks Dean up and down, adjusting his hat.
"Think he does. I mean, look at this," he says, and pushes Dean's thighs down, fucking him deeper, the loud slap of skin on skin filling the room. Dean can't hold back the sounds he's been biting his tongue against. "Look at you, you slut."
you?" Dean crosses his arms. It's getting easier. It also props his tits up in a way he thinks would have drawn Cas's attention had he been a regular human guy and not a weirdo bird-brained angel guy. "It was a witch, a couple days ago. I'm about to head up to Bobby's to try to figure out how to… you know, fix it."
"You don't know what you're talking about," Dean huffs. "And Bobby's not my dad."
" and that sounds so much sweeter. Cas holds Dean's face, tracing the curve of his ear. He lets out a grunt of disappointment when Dean pulls away again.
Great. Thanks.
"I thought you preferred pie to cake."
"Try again, dude," he says, but he fishes another five out of his wallet and hands it to Cas anyway. Cas then hands the bill to the carnie, who looks between the two of them for a moment before setting the bottles back in place and handing Cas his allotted three baseballs.
things to go back to normal or do you want something else to happen?" Sam sighs. "Not that I think you can really walk this one back exactly, but, you know. Cas is family. I can't even really wrap my head around some of the stuff you've been through together. I have to think you could come back from this."
"What about soup? You want soup? I got all the stuff. Dad's soup always used to knock the hell outta my sinuses whenever I got a cold. Yeah?" Sam makes a noncommittal noise. "Soup? Charlie? Soup?"
"Good morning," Castiel says, and she doesn't look guilty in the slightest, just weary, which makes it even more of a mystery. Her hair is still braided back, just the way Dean left it. In the brighter light of the kitchen, he can see that it's a little bit sloppy, but Cas doesn't seem to mind. Dean sits between the two of them at the table, giving Sam a cheesy smile.
"Until you fall asleep," Cas says, and brushes Dean's hair from his forehead. Dean's eyelashes move, fluttering, as he sighs against the pillow.
"Holy— Hey, nice trick," he whispers.
Sam's stern expression falls a little bit, his eyes going round, and there he is. There's that kid Dean would do anything for.
Dean smiles crookedly, like he does when Cas has said something foolish and Dean is about to spend the next hour delighting in correcting him. "You're not gonna hurt me."
. But Dean had seen the vamp that turned him, how he was awful pretty for a guy, and Dean thought he understood why Benny might've gone for that, even if Dean wouldn't have. It wasn't a huge leap. Dean decides not to consider what that says about him.
"Hello, Dean."
Castiel hesitates before speaking again. "You misunderstand. I didn't choose to become this way. When I was… returned to life, it was by an entity that seemed enraged by my very existence. And it knew me. It knew my life, my thoughts, my—" There's a pause where Castiel seems to be remembering. She'd been vague on the details, but the Empty sounded like a pretty shitty way to spend eternity. "It wanted to be rid of me, but it also seemed to take satisfaction in tormenting me. I believe that choosing this… visage for me was its idea of a great cosmic joke."
He buys the dress.
Dean had frozen, one knee on the mattress, afraid to look, though it was too dark to see his face. "Yes, sir."
"Yeah? Thought you didn't care about cars," Dean says, preening. He unlocks the side door, opening it for her in a gentlemanly way without thinking. Fuck, he's really bad at acting girly today. Mina sinks into the passenger's side, stretching her legs out in front of her. It's usually Sam sitting in her spot, and his legs have gotta be twice as long as hers.
Dean rolls his eyes then looks back at what Rowena's doing, arms crossed. He's
Cas has turned her attention to herself, staring down at her own hips. She frowns, shaking her head, then it's Dean's turn to startle and whirl around to preserve Castiel's dignity, because she yanks on a few laces and slips that little white number she's wearing right off her shoulders. He'd seen Castiel with his shirt off in the past, but this is— Cas looks—
And when he does finally manage to get a hold of Sam at the apartments where he's just finished digging through one of the vics' bedrooms, it's not the ripped-off band-aid he was bracing for. Dean confronts him about it all, the weird behavior, the
guy. But it wasn't really. I didn't take it serious. I didn't think he was serious. We were—
Jack comes forward to pull her into a hug, guilelessly happy. Cas hesitates before her arms come to rest on his shoulders. She presses a kiss to the crown of his head. Dean aches, remembering how his mom used to do the same thing, when he was still little, and new enough to be loved unconditionally.
"I'm fully aware," Cas says. She's got that stubborn look in her eye that Dean's seen a hundred times before, usually before she did something to recklessly endanger herself. "But she needs our help. And so does Mary."
Ok we'll leave them in the car
Dean thinks about trying to explain this to himself from five years ago and laughs. He hadn't even believed in vampires back then. Seems pretty stupid now.
They have to get Cas her own clothes,
"You looking for anything special, or just looking?"
"Okay. Good." Dean kisses him again, lingering a moment this time, and Cas sighs into it, letting himself be held.
"Dean, oh... I... " Cas's voice cracks, breaking into a long groan. "No, that's…
Dean's not sure how long it goes on for. It feels agonizingly slow, but Dean can't look away, can hardly blink, watching the concoction swallow Castiel up, bit by bit. It spreads itself over his eyelids, clinging to his chin and slipping down over the length of his throat, down over his sharp shoulders and stretching wet fingers down his arms until the whole naked form of him is completely engulfed. Rowena keeps chanting, and the candles flicker again, burning brighter for one tense second before dimming again, making the room seem darker than it is.
while wearing chainmail that makes the nerd-center of his brain light up.
"'Kay, maybe some taken," Dean says.
"Idiot. I can't believe her. Screw this."
Something in Castiel rattles loose. He has tried to keep it tethered, but it wails within him now, a powerful hunger of his own, with claws and gnashing teeth. Cas feels unworthy of this, undeserving, but he
"I don't know what I did to piss him off. I don't remember that much anymore, I was five. I think I threw a tantrum about not being able to stay and play with the dog, and I guess that pissed him off, cause he drove straight to Pastor Jim's and dumped my ass there for a week."
When Dean opens the door for him, Sam looks at him for a long moment, scanning over him for signs of whatever emergency Dean's got his maybe-not-entirely-proverbial panties in a twist over.
by telling you to
"One month of sitting down to pee," Dean says, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
"In mind, in body, in spirit," Rowena says. "All the food groups!"
Dean hates the way he can feel his voice breaking when he answers, "Too damn long." If he's not careful, he's gonna do something he regrets, like
Alcohol dulls it for a while, but it always just comes right back again. And here he is, hiding in his room from his best friend, his very recently revived best friend, who he had thought he might never see again. He'd gone and fucked that up, too. So what did it matter? What did any of it matter? Cas is one of the few people in Dean's life that keeps coming back. Someone he'd die for, someone he'd kill for. Someone who, despite that, he still can't bring himself to touch where people might see. And unfortunately it's real easy to hate himself for that and then just keep on doing it.
had an otaku phase in high school, anyone who says they didn't is lying."
Dean doesn't know what to make of that, so he just thinks,
in bed, and while Dean can definitely appreciate the appeal of that, he has no desire to broadcast everything they're doing to their entire family. With that in mind, he cups his palm over Cas's mouth, whispering hushed sounds in his ear until he's shaking and coming in Dean's hands.
The light grows too bright to see anything underneath, glowing and expanding until it's like the sun is sitting right there in the center of their circle. Pieces of shell begin to fall away in shards, littering the ground around them, little sounds like snowfall in the winter.
Sam's eyes trail them as they leave the room. "I don't know if I should go over there to rescue him or not."
"Tell Cas to check in when they're done, make sure everything's okay."
"Name's on the sign, ain't it?"
It's both tender and tense, the air between them crackling with heat. Dean gets to have this, and he can't imagine that he's earned it, but the proof of Cas molded against him is incontrovertible. When he comes, shuddering, it's with Cas's legs holding him deep inside while he groans into Cas's open mouth. Cas holds him there for a long time, letting him catch his breath. Light kisses on his forehead leave spots that cool in the open air. When he slips out of Cas, gone soft and oversensitive, Cas sighs like he's disappointed.
"Oh, I think I know this one," Jack says. "Like
old, like. Classic old?" She leads Dean up the stairs to the second level, fishing her keys out of her purse. She flicks a switch as soon as they pass the threshold and slips out of her flats. Dean follows her example, kneeling down to unlace his boots. It's small and tidy inside, with a sagging black couch and a bright orange armchair. The carpet and the walls are the bland gray and white of rentals everywhere, but there are bright pops of color all over.
"Okay. Cool." Dean closes the laptop and turns the chair a little to face her. "Where you been?"
"When did Dad yell at
Dean reaches over to flip out the lights. "Early morning tomorrow. Get some shut-eye."
Veritas turns her attention onto Sam next. Dean feels like throwing up. She coos and coaxes him into telling her how he feels about getting back together with Dean, and Sam… he lies.
"Cas?!" Dean yelps, trying to cover himself, but it's kind of a losing fight when there's still a guy bending him in half. "What the
"Come on," Sam says, rolling his eyes.
"Dean," Castiel says, like Dean's said something terribly sad instead of something that's just the plain truth. But she doesn't elaborate, just looks down at her hands in her lap, unspeaking.
"Oh. Shit." Mina's distress sobers. "Me too. I don't normally, um, take people home like this, yeah?" She stares at her hands in her lap. "I'm… I mean, I'm so over him, but watching people flirt while they act like I'm not there isn't super fun right now. So I guess I thought, hey, why not be crazy? You know?"
Cas doesn't speak for such a long time that it startles Dean when he answers. "What do you think I should do?"
"You asked me to stay," Cas says. Dean looks up in surprise, pale in the face and with bruised eyes. He likely doesn't remember much of last night. All the better, Cas thinks. Things between them are complicated enough as it is. "For breakfast," Cas adds, an olive branch. "Waffles."
"The last time we stayed with him. That was probably… I dunno, '88?"
"I figured." Dean worries at his lip with his teeth. "You trust Rowena not to double-cross us?"
Dean squints at him suspiciously. Sam's face suddenly softens into a look of hurt and dismay.
"I mean, you don't have to get into specifics or anything but…"
The relief rocks him like a wave. It's followed soon after by shame, creeping in sick and slow, because what kind of a coward does that make him?
, Dean thinks. Then it's raining in the kitchen. Dean looks up slowly, his muscles not quite obeying him. The sprinkler. Right. Water soaks through his flannel and his undershirt, trickling down his nose where it's pressed to Castiel's cheek. Cas pulls back from Dean's vice grip first, hands flat on Dean's chest, his hair matted to his forehead.
"Sorry, Cas," Dean says, tugging off his boots and leaving them in the middle of the floor. Sam's not much better. He caught some z's during the car ride, but not enough. "Just a few hours of you watching us sleep like a creeper and we'll be back home."
"What happened," Bobby is already asking with a put-upon sigh.
he thinks in mild alarm,
And he's not trying to, but as the movie keeps playing, and he's watching Boromir swear fealty to Aragorn, calling him
," Cas says, flushed with anger, "because you are not
"I dunno how many of 'em'll fit you now," Dean admits, stepping closer. He smooths a hand over the sleeve of his robe. "You're, uh, kinda… bigger than I remember."
I'll let that slide just this once.
"Man, Galadriel is like,
He hears her voice behind him say, "Dean," too softly. He scrubs his hand back through his hair, unable to turn around all the way, but he lowers his voice. He shouldn't wake Sam.
"What? When was that?"
"Hey Sam, you coming?" says one of them.
"Cas taught me that one," Jack says proudly. Cas pats him on the shoulder while Sam undoes the lock and swings the locker door open.
He's still doing the dishes when Sam walks in. He opens the fridge, hovering with the door ajar for a long enough time that Dean suspects he's not actually looking at anything. Dean keeps his nose down, rinsing out bowls and setting them on the drying rack one after the other.
There's a musty smell, the air thick with dust and humidity. Everything feels thick. Dean's tongue is thick in his mouth, and his clothes stick to his back, his skin tacky with sweat and grime.
"No— you are."
He sleeps like the dead every night, courtesy of the drink, except that even when he was dead he didn't get any goddamn shut-eye. So he's earned this now, he figures. He needs his four hours, and he's got the medicine to force it along. Even still, every morning always brings with it a little painful surprise. Here you are again, and here's the headache to prove it.
He swallows hard. Bobby. Call Bobby. Bobby can fix him.
"That's blackmail, so you don't go sharing that other picture around," Dean says, ducking back into the heat when he starts to get goosebumps.
"He's gone," Dean says. "I can pray to him all I want, but it's a waste of breath. We're on our own."
"I'll take you up on that later," Dean says, pulling back. Cas looks up at him, eyes dark but pleased, and tilts his chin up for another brief kiss.
"It— it's for TikTok," she whimpers.
"Yes." Castiel looks up, full of quiet resolve. Like Dean can say no to that.
"How'd that go?" Dean says gently.
He follows behind Sam's borrowed piece-of-shit pickup back to the sprawling piece-of-shit Compound their grandfather calls home. Dean doesn't know how they stand it, living in a boarded-up dump with a rotting roof and crumbling stairs. Sure, he's lived out of crappy motels almost his whole life, but at least they have walls. It's a little quiet; a few of the half-dozen cars that are usually parked by the gates are missing, and when they walk inside, it's just the patriarch himself and that prick Christian sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee.
Okay.... it's the end! We're here! Oh god! Aaaaaa!! Happy Valentine's Day, everyone, I know it's not a wedding fic, but I hope it'll make you smile anyway.
"Really?"
but he gropes under his pillow to find that it's gone. He lurches out of bed, regretting it immediately when his head throbs with pain.
he want.
He leaves it on and puts his shirt back on, and the change is noticeable, at least to him. Just that one item of clothing, which nobody else can even see, has him looking at himself differently and feeling a lot more confident about this whole endeavor. He could totally nail this being a woman thing.
"I knew how much… conflict was tangled up in this, for you, but I still wanted you so much." Castiel's forehead creases, his expression anguished. "For a long time. I wanted you before I knew I could want anything at all."
"Castiel," Rowena says. "Do you remember where you are?"
Mina looks at Dean, lips parted on a question she hasn't asked yet.
"I know," Cas says, sighing softly. They lapse into silence, just the sound of Dean's feet on the carpet and Castiel's breath through the receiver. It makes Dean wish Cas was here with him, and that makes him feel a little bit like a fourteen year old girl mooning over a crush. He's a grown ass adult, he can be away from Cas for a few days. He's done it often enough. But of course, whether he
All the clues point to Colorado. When Charlie stands up to trail after them, Dean stops her in her tracks.
"I hurt you," Cas says. "I'm trying to understand how. I don't ever want to hurt you, Dean."
Dean glances at his phone. It's a little past 1 AM. "When did you get in?"
"Embryonic components are vital to the spell," Rowena explains. "It's part transformation, part time magic. We're reversing time on Castiel's form, but since he doesn't age naturally, it's more like…"
Right.
He can feel Cas watching him, and maybe that softens his mistrust a little, too.
Dean looks at her. Something in his face makes her put up her hands, placating.
Dean thinks,
"I've been here," Mina says innocently.
to just fall back and let this happen.
"You may joke," Charlie says, and nudges his knee with her toe before she tucks them back up under herself. "But that's kind of why LARPing is so fun." She wipes her eyes with the back of her hand. "It's fun to take whatever it is you like about your favorite stuff… like
"Quit lyin'." Dean nudges Cas's chin, and he realizes he is smiling. He allows Dean to tuck Cas's head against his shoulder. Once he's settled, Dean starts picking at the knot on his tie, unwinding it one-handed. "Fucked my shirt up."
Cas has been kissed by Dean forty-seven times. Humans, probably, would have lost count, or not counted at all. He has gathered this is not, generally speaking, something people keep track of past the first time. He can't understand why, because every time he is ruined again.
He can't control the sounds coming out of him anymore. His hand is making wet sounds where he's fucking himself, and every time he breathes it comes out high and needy,
"But even if you never get it," Dean says, "You gotta have something to look forward to, Cas. Something
"I mean, rule of thumb, you can't really go wrong just… doing whatever the other person likes. Not saying you have to go along with, like, anything and everything, but just… I dunno, for me, that's the good part. Figuring out what someone likes and giving it to them. And I like a lot of stuff, so, you know. It usually works out good."
He doesn't flinch at the sting. One drop and it's over, just as she said. Then Rowena directs them all to sit in a crescent on the floor at key spots on the chalk drawing, and to hold hands. Jack sits between Sam and Dean, and he looks to each of them in turn with an anxious smile. Dean squeezes his hand once, trying to return it.
"Okay, weirdo. Just. Don't let anyone see that."
He laughs, and it comes up wet and bubbling. He holds himself closer.
He's crossing a line. He's crossing every line there is. But his mind won't settle until he knows what's on the other side of it.
Dean blinks, floundering, when Cas speaks up. "I saved his life," she says. Dean looks over sharply, his eyes widening in alarm.
gay. Or at least not
"Dean, I was kidding. I wouldn't."
She knows where her guest room is already, but she asks Dean to help her get set up and ropes him into watching
"Yeah. During target practice. Dad gave him a black eye over it."
Unless you somehow managed to get hundreds of people across the country to participate.
Cas laughs a bit, a wet little cough. Dean's thumb catches a tear beginning to trail down his cheek, and Dean kisses him once, firm and definitive.
"I thought like… I mean, you're not—but, I thought girly girls, y'know, lipstick lesbians or whatever wanted the really butchy girls. And like, the other way around. Is that not how it works?"
"Okay, yeah, I know that," Dean says, smothering a smile and an eyeroll into the flesh of Castiel's inner thigh. "But, I mean…" Dean licks another stripe from bottom to top, tugging to pull the hood of Castiel's clit up so he can seal his lips over it, planting his tongue at the base and sucking. Cas spasms under him, and Dean tries to hold him still, but it's not easy, and he compensates by moving his head with the motion of Castiel's hips rocking.

They meet up with Sam at a diner for breakfast. Charlie invites a couple of her other LARP friends, who are both cosplay enthusiasts and incensed about trying to outfit a guy as big as Sam on such short notice. Sam endures the attention with nobility and humor, letting them measure him and paint his face in Charlie's tent once they arrive at the parkgrounds. He even joins Dean in the charge once they've suited up for the Battle of Kingdoms. It's been a while since either of them let loose and just did something goofy for no other reason than fun. All in all, Dean would have to call it a pretty good day.
