Also, I know Gabriel is a bit out of character, but for the purposes of this story, I wanted him to be a caring and protective brother beneath all the jokes.

“You see, I’ve always been a bit insecure about the way I look and act. I want people to like me, and that leads me to put on these performances. I hide some of the more sensitive aspects of my personality and glorify my masculinity because that is what I’ve been taught is ideal. It’s not though. It’s actually kind of toxic, and I don’t like being that person. The real me is nothing like the me that I allow people to see, and it’s terrifying to think about how people would react to truth, but I’m tired of hiding. It’s time I let the real Dean come forward. Be authentic for once.”
Dean shifted uncomfortably. A part of him wanted to punch John in the face for saying that while another wanted to retreat to a hole for the remainder of his life. His father caught sight of his embarrassment and smirked. Meanwhile, Cas, as oblivious as ever, just raised an eyebrow.
“Why?”
“Or my bedroom,” Sam added.
“Yeah, I’m definitely getting that,” Dean told him, “but it’s kinda over-the-top, don’t you think?”
“I’m tough,” Jack huffed. “I could take him.”
Cas smiled, and Dean was just grateful he wasn't some kind of mind reader given what had just passed through his head. Still, he figured he should tell him his conclusion.
Claire was next to greet the young Winchester. She was holding hands with another girl whom Sam soon learned was her girlfriend. Kaia smiled at him. Crowley held back, an effort, Dean assumed, to seem cool by just nodding his acknowledgement of Sam’s presence. Another possibility was that he was waiting for an introduction. It was probably a bit of both.
“Dude, I can’t believe you’ve never seen Tombstone,” Dean was almost mortified.
Damn. Dean could never say no to that. He nodded.
“So why the hell haven’t you asked her out already? Using the dance as a safety net?”
“Right. Well, you said you wanted to try steak, right?”
“I’m not really sure. This is more overwhelming than I expected.”
“Are you sure?”
“If that is all, may we be dismissed?”
“I’m afraid I haven’t heard it before.”
“It’s alright. I’ll probably only be out here a few more minutes anyway. I was just hoping to maybe catch some stragglers before then,” he smiled politely at Dean.
“You’re Dean, right?”
After discussing the engagement for awhile, Cas left Jack to his Cookie Crisps so he could go check on Dean. He expected to find his partner in the same position he left him in, but he was surprised to find him wide awake and sitting upright. He caught sight of Cas in the doorway and smiled.
“Yes I do,” Gabe sighed. “I wasn’t going to say anything because it’s not my place, but I had a talk with him the other day, and I’m not sure he’s interested in having that type of relationship. A romantic one, yes. I mean, he’s got it bad on that account; there’s no denying that. The kid’s got heart eyes just from hearing Dean’s name. But when it comes to the physical stuff, he seems uncomfortable.”
Castiel smiled at him, a trace of both relief and hope in his eyes. God, those eyes...it was like losing oneself in the fucking ocean. Much to Dean’s relief, the moment was cut short before the stupid lovestruck grin that was pulling at his lips could fully reveal itself. They both turned their heads upon hearing a squeal of excitement from the doorway.
“Heh, don’t know about breathtaking,” Dean took a sip of his beer. “But thanks. You look pretty good, yourself,” he set the bottle down on the ground next to him and leaned forward to kiss the other man, cheekily.
“Well, it’s because I’m sort of embarrassed. I know I shouldn’t be, but it’s hard sometimes,” he lowered his volume some more, “You see, I’ve never been in a serious relationship before because every guy I’ve ever liked has turned me away after realizing that I can’t give them what they want. Even when I try...it just isn’t what they’re looking for.”
“Seniors are allowed to leave campus for lunch, so I usually go to the little park down the hill. It’s not too far, but I try to get out of here as quickly as possible so I can make it there and back in time for sixth period.”
Cas agreed. The two started off fairly awkward, and there was some stepping on eachother’s feet, but eventually they got into a rhythm. They were lost in eachother’s eyes, and there was that familiar brightness that made Dean’s heart flutter. He felt warm inside and overall at home with having Cas so close. His eyes suddenly flicked to the boy’s lips. God, they looked so inviting. He wanted to kiss him so badly, but he didn’t want to go too far. This was a first date, afterall. However, they had basically told each other ‘I love you’ already which meant everything was out-of-order anyway. Might as well continue the trend. Gazing back up, he caught Cas also staring.
“Hello Sam,” she said while also signing her greeting.
Dean glanced at Cas who seemed quite flustered. He, himself, was trying to remain composed, but Sam was right. He and Cas had always been fairly transparent. Noticing his brother’s discomfort, Sam burst out laughing.
“I thought you might’ve gotten sick.”
“Ok, follow my lead, ok?” Dean said.
“Ok, but how do you feel about this? Are you ok with it?”
“Bye Dean,” Jack hung up just as Cas approached the dressing rooms.
“He wants to be boyfriends.”
I'm sorry it took so long to update. I meant to get this chapter out a few days ago, but some stuff came up, and I didn't get around to it.
“I do enjoy spending time with Charlie, but usually by the end of the night some girl will ask her to dance, and I am left awkwardly watching from the punchbowl.”
“Dean.”
“Well, thanks, Cas,” Dean managed to say as his throat began to close up from anxiety.
Also, I do intend to have Dean meet Gabriel at some point, so that should be interesting.
“Their protest has thusfar been peaceful. I have no basis to violate their freedom of speech.”
“So you’re telling me I did this?”
“Well, let’s change that. Come on,” Charlie took his hand and began to drag him towards Cas and Balthazar. “Castiel, what the hell? You’re not going to show off your cute new friend?”
Summary: Dean struggles with his feelings after sharing an intimate moment with Cas a few days prior. The Pride Alliance gang goes to the mall.
Laughing, Charlie released him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” he groaned. “This isn’t news.”
“So, are you saying that you are actually gay?”
“I guess,” Sam shrugged, “I read up on this place, and their honors program is pretty good.”
Sent 7:45 p.m.
“I promise.”
Cas figured what the hell? He still wasn’t sure what was going on, but they were together, the setting was lovely, and the pie did look delicious. Grabbing his fork, he scooped up a small section and brought it up to his lips. It nearly melted in his mouth.
“Alright,” Cas lifted his head from Dean’s shoulder.
"Fine, then you're Tigger,” it read.
Also, I would very much like to have lunch with you again tomorrow if you are willing. We do not have to go down to the park this time since it’s a bit of a time crunch. Rather, we could sit on one of the benches by the front entrance. They tend to fill up quickly, but if we hurry, we might be able to snag one. Or perhaps I could bring a blanket, and we could have a picnic in the grassy area around the side of the building. Whichever you would prefer.
“Back from heaven. Are you and Dean awake?” the text read.
But if none of them had done it, then…
“Dean, sometimes you just gotta man up and go for things when the opportunity arises. Everwise you may miss out.”
“Speech? I was just going to go with whatever sounds right in the moment.”
“Uh, yeah, it turns out that I’m bi.”
“Dean?”
“Your friend here said you were looking for something classy for a wedding proposal. That right?” she asked, a huge smile now spread across her face.
“Dude, you’re blushing.”
“Pleasure,” he extended his hand to shake Dean’s. “Mm, firm grip you got there,” he said in a joking yet slightly flirtatious manner.
“I don’t want to pressure him like that. Besides, I think it should be something independent of the dance. You know, because everyone is doing cutesy stuff right now, and it loses some of its effect. No offense, I’m sure what you made for Eileen was very sweet, and I wish you two the best. It’s just that I want this to be 100% our moment.”
In regards to your father, I wish things could be different. I wish homophobia didn’t exist and that we could all live without having to worry about judgement or ridicule. Unfortunately, the world isn’t so kind. We are faced with these challenges, and it’s up to us whether to hide or fight. You’ve already shown so much courage by initiating discussion, so just keep pushing. You’re a fighter, Dean. Even if he doesn’t want to listen, you must continue speaking your truth. Educate if you can, but ultimately you must take back your power by not giving others the satisfaction of tearing you down. Just live freely. Be happy. Show the world that queerness is beautiful, and that it’s nothing to be ashamed of. It won’t always be easy, but I promise to be with you every step of the way and to help pick you back up when you need it.
“I’m just dreading this outing in general. You know I hate malls and trying on clothes.”
“I’m scared, Gabe,” tears began to well in Cas’s eyes. “I don’t want to ruin our friendship if things don’t work out.”
“I didn’t just give up my afternoon to watch you all wave some flags.”
“Wait, why is the door closed?” Cas asked.
“Did Eileen stop by or something? What’s all this?” Dean yawned as he entered the kitchen and spotted a box of chocolates and a bouquet of roses on the table.
His father didn’t answer. He took a swig of the drink he was holding and tossed the empty can over his shoulder. Noticing the slight swaying of his body and the overwhelming aroma of cheap beer that was on his breath, Dean figured it wasn’t his first. Great, drunk John is just what he needed…he took a deep breath and let it out to ground himself. Fuck it.
“Well, get ready because we are here,” he gave Dean a sort of cheeky grin, grabbed his hand, and dragged him inside.
Dean didn’t answer. He merely kept driving until they reached a clearing. Up ahead was a small lake. Cas looked to Dean again for an explanation, but instead, his partner hopped out of the car and opened the backdoor to retrieve the cooler, the blanket, and something else from the floor that the angel couldn’t quite make out. Then, he swung around to Cas’s side and knocked on the window.
“It’s my life.”
“Ok, well how about a beer?”
“But that’s unfair,” Dean continued.
Jack nodded.
“I’m pretty sure special occasions means like holidays and get togethers, not school nights.”
“Ok, just meet us upstairs,” Charlie shouted back at them.
“I’m sorry. Is that too much?” he asked.
“Sam, this is weird.”
Cas nodded.
Dean nodded.
“I know, I know. It’s just...I haven’t quite pieced together what I want to say yet, and I was sort of planning on telling you after dad leaves tonight.”
“A bit lightheaded, but I’m fine. I didn’t mean to frighten you.”
“Cas.
“I care about Dean, I really do, and I want to be in a relationship, but I’ll just be a burden for him.”
“So, did you enjoy lunch with Cas?”
So, I told Sam. He seems to be handling it well, but that might be because he apparently already suspected that something was up years ago. He didn’t want to say anything because he didn’t want to make me mad. I can’t really say I blame him cause I know I can be a hothead sometimes, but a part of me is annoyed that I could’ve come clean a lot sooner and saved myself the stress. Of course, coming out earlier could have meant other problems, so maybe I made the smart choice afterall. Who knows.
“We didn’t talk much. To tell you the truth, I actually haven’t seen him in years. He picked up and left on some mission for self-discovery when I was twelve, so Michael has been taking care of us. He might’ve known, but if he did, he didn’t mention it.”
“And that isn’t appropriate for Valentine’s Day?” Jack tilted his head out of genuine curiosity rather than judgment.
“Just tolerable?” Dean found himself glancing at Cas, a bit offended.
“I guess I haven’t fully wrapped my mind around everything that happened yesterday,” he said.
Cas bit his lip. He had wanted to keep this to himself until he got everything sorted out. Afterall, this was a big step he was getting ready to take, and he could lose his courage at the last second. He didn’t want to have anyone getting overly excited. Still, this was Jack. He was bound to find out somehow, right? Chuck had been omniscient, so it would only make sense for Jack to be too. Even if he had promised to be a hands off kind of god, he was always a little nosy when it came to family affairs. With that being the case, it would be better for Castiel to come out and say it rather than beat around the bush. Holding in his breath, he reached into his pocket to pull out a small wooden box with angel wings carved on the lid. Exhaling, he turned it over in his hands.
“Sorry. I needed a moment to ground myself,” he said. “I was a bit overwhelmed coming to school today. A lot on my mind.”
“Look, Eileen and I will help you. You can practice on us.”

“Well, if you need another set of hands, I could help you out.”
“You sure I shouldn’t change?” Dean asked as he glanced down at his own clothes. “This old FBI suit is not exactly…”
“Nah, I'll stay. I wanna hang out with you. Like I said, the angels have got things covered."
Yes, that had been established. Dean scratched his head in thought. What was Jack getting at? Wait…
“Happy you got your ass out of bed now?” Sam laughed as he approached to hug them both.
_______________________
“You don’t know that,” Cas replied, solemnly. “You’re hyped up on adrenaline right now, and it’s making you say things that you haven’t fully thought through yet.”
“For what?”
“No, thank you. I’m going to call Gabriel to pick me up. He should be home from work now. I just need to take some time to ground myself, and it’ll be easier if I do it away from everyone.”
“It can be at times, but my brothers say it looks good for colleges, so I suppose it’s worth it. Plus, the social/behavioral topics help build a foundation for my activism projects.”
“Why are you here?” Crowley rephrased. “We don’t get a lot of people like you.”
“Alright, but this time try not to burn it. Takes forever to get rid of the smell,” Dean laughed, and Cas gave him an annoyed look. “Just be careful.”
He thanked her, and then turned to look at Cas who was rubbing his arm, awkwardly, and swaying a little on his feet. His face was flushing. This reaction did not go unnoticed, and Charlie smirked.
His brother shook his head.
“Do you need any help or have you found what you were looking for?”
“That’s not who you are.”
“Just Cas texting me to ask if I made it to the park ok.”
“That so?”
(Earlier that same day)
Dean pretended to groan.
“Not going to happen, Fergus.”
“What is it about her that you are drawn to?”
“No, you need to hear this. And bare with me because I’ve never been that great with words,” he sighed, “Without you, I’d still be that pathetic, angry, repressed idiot running around looking for ways to destroy myself. It wasn’t healthy, but I did it out of fear. I thought I needed to keep up this tough guy act to protect myself so that I could continue to protect my brother. Then, I met you, and for the first time, I was able to let my guard down. I felt safe with you, and I was able to tell you things I hadn’t told anyone, not even Sam. And you were so patient with me all the time, even when I probably made you want to pull your hair out,” he laughed a little, but then a shadow fell over his face. “And I can’t help but feel guilty because you gave me everything, and it took me forever to realize why. And the worst part is that all the while, I had feelings for you too. But I didn’t want to risk losing you, so I shoved it down and hoped it would go away. It didn’t, though. Every time you walked into the room, hell, just hearing your voice was electrifying. What I felt when we were together in any capacity was addicting, and I just wish I had the balls to say something sooner.”
“You think?”
“You’re serious about coming?” he asked. “You know you don’t have to pretend in order to impress Michael, right?”
“Just keep it in your pants until after breakfast, ok?” Sam managed a smile.
“Fine…” Dean mumbled.
“You’ll see.”
“You used to.”
“Dude, it’s 6:30. We just got up.”
“That’s very courageous of you, Dean. Just promise me you will be careful.”
“Right, I’m sorry,” he actually appeared apologetic.
Cas nodded, still not entirely convinced. Nevertheless, Dean grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the ramp that led to the cafeteria. Inside, Sam was waiting at one of the tables, his earbuds in, so he didn’t notice them immediately. Dean waved a hand in front of his face.
Cas gave him a soft smile. He had forgotten that even though Jack was a Nephilim, he never underwent formal angel conditioning which included crash courses on Enochian.
Cas glanced at him, a hint of admiration behind his overall surprised expression. Dean didn’t meet his gaze, but the tight squeezing of his hand indicated that he wasn’t backing down after his declaration.
“You should see him with Battleship,” Cas whispered back, a grin tugging at his lips as Gabriel cursed repeatedly.
“I don’t know. Movie day?”
Cas elbowed him in the ribs for his rudeness, but Crowley wasn’t bothered.
They found another bench indoors in an empty hallway where they could hear the music in the distance but not loud or clearly enough to overstimulate Cas further. Dean sat down next to him, his hand on the other boy’s thigh. He applied a gentle pressure to help ground him. Meanwhile, Cas leaned his head against Dean's shoulder and closed his eyes. His breathing began to slow down, and his body relaxed.
“Chin up, bud. You’ll get there. As for right now, what do you say about us getting some ice cream on the way home?”
“Absolutely not,” Charlie cut in. “We don’t need you distracting everybody. This is supposed to be publicity for the club and local resources. You can hand out fliers.”
“Come on, we only have a few hours before Cas and Jack get home. We should get started.”
“You did nothing, wrong, Cas,” Dean told him, “If I seem upset, it’s because I wish I knew how to express how serious I am about us. This doesn’t change anything, Cas. You are who you are, and I don’t want you to change. I’m not like those other jerks. How can I prove that to you?”
“Come on,” Gabe urged. “Stand together and look cute.”
“So that’s where you were? I was looking for you in the cafeteria, and I just thought you might’ve gone to the vending machine. Then, when you never showed, I started to wonder if you were ok.”
"Sure."
“You look amazing,” he murmured. “Don’t change a thing.”
“I suppose...” Dean considered this. “But what if I end up...what if it turns out that I’m not bi or whatever?"
“Goodnight, Sam, and thank you.”
“Actually, that wasn’t very comfortable,” Cas said deadpanned.
“In a minute. I believe you have neglected to introduce me to your handsome friend, here,” Crowley turned towards Dean and winked.
“Maybe I just never really gave it a chance.”
“Avoidant? I’m answering your questions, aren’t I?”
Pride what...Dean glanced down at the table which was adorned with little flags, a basket full of colorful buttons, safe place brochures, event fliers, and a pile of rainbow pens and keychains. The poster that he had previously been standing in front of highlighted the words “LGBTQIA+ services.” Suddenly, it clicked.
“How are we even related?” Dean managed a laugh.
“Awe, man, you’re going to make me say it, aren’t you? Ok fine…” he took in a deep breath and let it out. “The thing is...I think I might like you. And I’m not talking like a playground crush. It’s like full on Cupid’s arrow, and man, I gotta say that when I first realized what it was, I was terrified. I didn’t want to ruin our friendship, and I thought there was no way in hell you would go for someone like me. But then I saw your face the other day, and there was this spark of something, maybe hope, that you might feel something for me too. And then earlier how you were looking at me when I was wearing that suit...fuck, can you please just tell me if I’m crazy because the more I’m talking the crazier I feel.”
“Well, I’ll be damned."
“What do you say, Pooh Bear?”
“What did he say?”
“Cas, that’s not…it’s an expression” he shook his head, but as always, his boyfriend’s cluelessness made him melt a little (it was so hard to be angry when this doofus was beside him). “The point is, it’s all starting to hit me. The stress of it all. I guess I was distracted before.”
“Fair enough.”
His father frowned.
“Go on,” John crossed his arms.
In addition to reminiscing, Dean also spent quite a bit of time fantasizing. For instance, what would happen if he and Cas got together and had movie nights? Cas would snuggle up next to him on the couch, the tv showing some cowboy movie that neither of them would actually be watching because they would be too busy talking. Cas would be nitpicking the historical inaccuracies and the dramatic acting while Dean tried to defend the honor of John Wayne and other Western movie stars. This would go on for some time before Cas would attempt to shut him up by pressing his mouth gently to Dean’s cheek, his nose, his forehead, and finally to his lips. They may share lazy kisses for awhile or perhaps just cuddle until they fall asleep. Other thoughts included making breakfast together or rather Dean making breakfast while Cas kept him company, hugging him from behind, whispering sweet nothings into his ear. Meanwhile, Sam is probably sitting nearby, rolling his eyes. He would be secretly happy for them, though. Dean would be making his specialty, buttermilk pancakes (does Cas like pancakes?), and he’d laugh when his offer for Cas to help ends up with a pancake flipping a little too high and landing on the floor by Sam’s feet. Smaller scenarios were sprinkled in with these larger fantasies as well- holding hands in the hallway, ordering for one another at restaurants, giving Valentines, etc. All such thoughts made Dean feel warm and fuzzy inside, but they were also a distraction from the major issue at hand. How was he supposed to prove to Cas that this thing between them was real and that he was in it for the long-run?
This is ultimately how Gabriel found them when he entered the room to inform them that dinner was on the table.
“Who’s Karen? I don’t understand how this woman is involved.”
“Whatever you need, man.”
“Will you go to the dance with me?” it read.
_______________
“Hey man, I like it too. It’s nice, but something tells me Michael will not take too kindly to finding us like this.”
_____________________
“Shut up. Nobody turned me into anything because I’ve always been this way. All Cas ever did was help me to realize that it’s ok,” Dean grabbed Cas’s hand reflexively.
“Have you figured it out?”
“Oh, sorry,” Cas blushed in embarrassment. “Jack’s home. He was hungry, and I guess Sam’s been hiding his sweets again.”
“Where’s Jo?” Dean whispered. “Did she show up?”
“You’re pushing my patience, Dean.”
On this cue, Crowley grinned.
“Sorry. Sammy increases the volume to drown me out when I start singing along,” he turned the dial, and the music became softer. “That better?”
“Not related to us, no. We had lunch together yesterday and today, but we mostly talked about the parade on Friday.”
“Seriously, Dean. Where are we?” Cas asked about a half an hour later when his partner began to drive in the direction of a wooded area that was away from the main road.
“And?”
"Oh, right,' Dean hesitated, “I think I might be bisexual. I’m not sure though.”
Dean slipped his hand into Cas’s, and they followed. On the way towards the door, Cas made sure to grab his honeypot with his free hand. He held it to his chest as they walked. Once they reached the door to the Pride Alliance meeting area, Dean paused and glanced down at their hands.
“Maybe that was part of it, but come on, man. You must have noticed this weird sort of energy between us. Not just then, but always. You don’t experience that?”
Dean wasn’t sure what to expect as they neared the school. The way Crowley had described it, it sounded like a few angry soccer moms setting up outside. That was manageable, right? So why did his heart feel like it was in his throat?
“What is it? Headache? Stomach ache? We can stop at the store to get some ginger ale if you think that’ll help.”
“Yes, off. As in, this is not normal behavior for two friends.”
“Anyway, since I’ve got time to waste, I figured I’d drop in. You know, for sentimental reasons.”
“Well, lucky for you, I wasn’t planning on anything like that until later. Today is all about the romance. So have a seat. What kind of pancakes would you like?”
“It’s beautiful,” Cas carefully turned the pot to admire the craftsmanship.
“Not hungry.”
Dean just shook his head, although he was holding back a chuckle at the thought of Crowley interrupting the dance for an impromptu performance. For a moment the image nearly caused him to forget about Cas’s absence. Then, he remembered.
“Alright then. I’ll make the call. I should probably ask Hannah if she wants some first, though.”
“Goodbye, Sam. I look forward to seeing you again when we have more time to get to know one other,” Castiel said.
“Don’t worry about it. I have a whole box. Now come on. We’ll be late.”
The two wandered over to where Crowley was busy flirting with the DJ. Both knew that he was planning on wearing one of his performance suits, but this was a little much. The jacket itself was a maroon color, and probably would’ve looked good on its own, but Crowley had sewn patterns of flames which were then covered with yellow and orange sequins up one side. The other side had a bedazzled crown where a pocket might be and Crowley’s name spelled out beneath it in jewels. The pants were pretty plain, just black, but then he was wearing platform shoes. He was wearing makeup too, but not subtle like Cas’s. No, he had very prominent eyeshadow and mascara.
“That it was intentional? That maybe you wanted to tell me something, but then decided against it.”
“I think he’s got everything to do with it,” John growled. “Afterall, he’s the one who turned you into a fucking fairy.”
“Well, if that’s the case, then why do you feel guilty about this?” Gabe asked. “If you never had to change yourself before, why would you now?”
____________________
“You know, that says to me that maybe you want a date, and you’re afraid what Dad will say,” it was obvious that Sam was trying to hide a smirk. “Everwise, you’d just tell him you’re going solo to chaperone me and Eileen. I take it there’s a guy.”
“He said he was sorry. Anyway, that’s not the point,” he rolled his eyes, “I just thought that after everything he’s been through, hell, what I’ve put him through, he deserves something nice. More romantic. And I’ve known for awhile that he’s the person I want to spend my life with, so I figured why not just go for it.”
“Neither am I.”
“Will do. Enjoy your night out, guys,” Sam retreated back into the hallway.
I’m thinking of skipping a few weeks ahead in the next chapter so we can get to Dean helping Cas with the Homecoming banner at Cas’s house. So expect to meet Gabriel and little Jack soon.
Please know that if it were up to me, I’d be there right now. I’d hold you close and tell you everything will be alright. Then I’d have us lie together, so I could rest my head on your chest and listen to your heart beat until we both fell asleep. If I could...
“Fine,” Cas grumbled, “That might be part of it, but ultimately this is about you finding a sense of community. Sometimes you need others to lean on while you figure yourself out,” he paused for a moment, planning his next words carefully,  “I hope this isn’t too forward because I know we just met, but I’d like to be part of that support system if you’d let me.”
“Yeah about that,” Crowley butted in. “Care to explain the situation across the street?”
“Yeah, well we were a little preoccupied last night,” Dean touched his cheeks (why was he blushing?)
“You coming?”
“Are you in trouble or something?”
Cas nodded.
“I suppose.”
Received 10:22 p.m.
“Sure, as friends, but I want to go with you as my date,” Dean smiled.
“I’m not sure if I’d say it’s weird,” Cas shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
“No worries. That’s quite common actually for people to come in without knowing exactly what they want. That’s what I’m here for. I can guide you. Let’s just start with you telling me a little bit about your fiancé-to-be. Is she more of a diamond girl or would she prefer something less flashy?"
“Oh, this?” Crowley gently brushed the jacket, being careful not to tear off any of the sequins. “It’s just a little something I’ve been working on for the show. I figured if I was going to use the title, King of Hell, I should look the part.”
“Ok, well let’s see here...holy shit,” Dean flipped around the menu and pointed at one of the images. “Bacon-wrapped filet mignons? You’ve got to try that, man.”
_________________
“Sure, but why?”
Sighing, he rubbed at his eyes and proceeded to text his brother that he was in the driveway. He had called earlier to let him know he was bringing Miracle over, but he didn’t give any details as to why. He still hadn’t quite figured out how he wanted to tell everybody about him and Cas. That is, if there ends up being anything to tell. Courage, he told himself.
“But it’s...”
“He proposed too?” Jack was astonished. “That’s so sweet!”
Cas turned his attention away from Dean’s mouth, and returned to making eye contact. There was confusion in his expression because Dean never used his full name. Even in the beginning, it was always just Cas.
“It has been overwhelming lately,” his voice was soft and there was a touch of guilt in it that Dean would only pick up on retrospectively; if he had realized it sooner, he would’ve said something to alleviate his boyfriend’s distress.
“Alright.”
“Ok, so maybe you’re bisexual?”
“So, how are you, Dean?” the boy asked once his giggling ceased.
“You’re afraid.”
-Dean
Cas looked away, slightly embarrassed.
“Best results? Like how appropriate the outfit is for the establishment? Is it for posture? Because I can barely move in this, let alone slouch.”
“Honestly?” Cas sighed. “I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed.”
Everyone clapped, and the meeting proceeded to the ending remarks. Cas kept his eye on Dean, confused and a little concerned. Meanwhile, Dean just kept patting his boyfriend’s thigh and smiling at nothing in particular.
“Oh, right. Sorry. I meant to say that he’ll be eager to get to know you.”
“And I want him to be happy,” Cas whispered so Gabriel almost couldn’t hear him.
“Trust me, I have. Could you just...look, I don’t really want to talk about this right now. Like I said, I’ve got a lot on my mind.”
“No, that’s not…” Dean chuckled, “Nevermind. I’m just joking around,” he settled himself into his chair. “It’s nice to see you again, Cas.”
“Hello,” he said, cheerfully.
“I’m bisexual,” Dean corrected. “And you rarely ask me about my day anyway, so why would it matter where I was? I could’ve just not said anything at all. The only reason I came up with the lie was for Sam before I told him.”
Cas frowned, his cheeks turning bright red, but he said nothing.
“Mmm, Cas, you’ve got to have some of this.”
“You better, bitch,” Dean sneered at his brother before turning back to return Cas’s sentiment.
“Whatever you say,” Sam teased.
Anyway, I just wanted to thank you again for the encouragement today. I needed that and couldn’t have done this without you.
“I’ve had enough of this,” in a drunken fit of rage,  John snatched Dean’s wrist with a grip tight enough to bruise the skin and yanked him away from Cas. “I gave you an order, boy.”
“Great, but first, why don’t you run through your actual proposal? I’d like to hear it.”
“Still good?”
“But I…”
“Cas?”
“Oh, I did. I’m a business major now at the local university. Unfortunately, I can’t rid myself of this wretched place because we only have one car, and I’m stuck taking Mother to and from work,” Crowley rolled his eyes. "On Friday afternoons she typically has a line of students outside her door with questions about assignments, so I’m going to be stuck waiting for awhile.”
Cas scrunched up his nose. He thought about all the times the two of them had gotten wasted while out with Sam and other hunters and eaten greasy bar food before coming back to the bunker and having sex the rest of the night. Not exactly the most romantic, and definitely not something he felt right discussing with his (essentially) four-year-old son. Just visualizing it made him blush, so he had to shake the thought away. In its place came images of weekly movie nights. Those were always fun. The two of them would cuddle on the couch, and Cas would kiss Dean to shut him up whenever he went on a rant about something a character said or did on screen. Those moments were sweet but were often cut short since Sam was usually there. As Dean would say, his brother is a bit of a mood killer.
“You’ve just been acting odd ever since you two hung out on Friday night, and then you didn’t eat lunch together today. I thought you might’ve had a fight.”
“I guess you’re not the only one playing Mr. Romantic,” Sam said in a low voice so there was no chance of Cas hearing.
“Look inside,” Dean urged.
“I agree.”
“Great, that means he’s going to be hanging over my shoulder, giving me tips for how to pick up the hottest girls. As if I wasn’t already uncomfortable,” Dean groaned.
“What movie?”
“I can understand that,” Dean said, “Although, if you ask me, the whole thing is overrated anyway.”
“I don’t know. I’ve seen you bust some moves out at the bars before.”
Hey Cas,
On his way out, Dean could’ve sworn he caught Sam winking at him as if to say “good luck.” Butterflies settled in his stomach.
“Being a team doesn’t mean we send one of us unequipped to handle a situation. If you need to sit this out, I understand.”
“Looking good, guys!” Sam shouted as they passed him and a group of his debate buddies.
“You’re amazing,” Cas grabbed Dean's other hand and kissed it gently. “See you downstairs.”
“Don’t,” Dean said firmly. “This right here is perfect. And if you want to dance, let’s dance.”
“I take it you didn’t have something like this at your other schools?” Castiel’s voice brought him out of his head again.
“I want to go to Stanford,” Sam clarified, “I’m only a freshman, so I have a long way to go before I can apply. In the meantime, I’m just trying to beef up the CV.”
“Yeah, Sammy. I’m good.”
“If you’re sure.”
"You're right. I'm much more fun. I'm here to make sure people don't fall asleep during one of Cas's boring speeches."
“I’m sure someone will come along,” Cas said almost reassuringly.“Don’t be discouraged.”
“Mr. Macleod,” the man addressed Crowley first. “Thank you for coming,” he scanned the rest of the group. “I see Mr. Novak and Ms. Bradberry have accompanied you. Hello, students.”
“Are you alright?” the boy noticed.
To: impala67@gmail.com
“It’s ok. I don’t expect you to eat lunch with the debate kids everyday or at all if it’s awkward for you. I can see how it might be considering most of the people in my friend group are freshman. You deserve to spend time with your own friends.”
Defensively, Dean moved in front of Cas. He narrowed his eyes.
Dean bit his lip. He had been thinking about it since the activity started, and he still wasn’t sure how to narrow it down. He was of course grateful to have the Pride Alliance, Sammy and Bobby, Cas and his family. He was grateful to have decent grades and to be in good health. He was grateful for the Impala and for the little money he had outside of stolen credit cards. Also the smaller things like the sound of leaves crunching or the warmth of the sun on his skin. Altogether, he’d have to say he was grateful to be alive. It took him a long time before he could say that truthfully, afterall there had been some rough patches in the past. However, at that moment there was no doubt.
“I’m going to walk Sammy inside,” he said.
“But you did it for me.”
“But as a concerned citizen, can’t you report them for a threat to safety?” Charlie suggested.
(Sam: “Left foot forward, right foot forward and out to the right, close the gap with your left foot so that you are standing with your feet touching. Then, you step back with your right, then back and out to the left with your left foot, close the gap.”)
“Did you ever think of just going for it? I couldn’t see my face the other night, but I’m sure it showed I was into it. My expression earlier this afternoon definitely did.”
“Charlie will be here, but like I said, she’ll be late. I imagine she will make some sort of grand entrance during my speech, but that’s ok. Um, my neighbor, Balthazar, said he would stop by. My cousin, Claire, and her girlfriend, Kaia. Meg usually shows up at some point,” he scrunched his nose in thought, but was interrupted by the sound of the door opening and a loud ‘hello’ from some guy with a British accent. “Oh no,” Cas groaned.
Excuse me while I go cry about Dean’s sappy Homecoming proposal...
“I don’t know. I just figured you had a rough time navigating faith and being gay before, and I don’t wanna ruin any progress you’ve made.”
As they approached the school, Dean’s belief dwindled. Unlike many of the previous institutions he and Sam had been enrolled in, this one was much nicer and the crowd on campus appeared to be composed of mostly rich, preppy kids. Immediately, he felt out of place. Sammy, however, perked up a little. He seemed to be intrigued by the student organizations that had tables set up outside.
“Well, thanks for making me feel like a complete jerk…” Michael wiped a hand across his face. “What can I do to fix it?”
“I’m sure it is,” Sam said, softly, “Thank you for telling me, Dean.”
“What do you mean?”
“No, everything is running smoothly. Everyone’s happy, and there hasn’t been any glitches lately. It’s been quiet, so I figured the angels could handle the rounds today while I came down here for a visit.”
“Of course,” Castiel said, cheerfully, “It helps lighten the mood. First meeting can be kind of stressful for newcomers.”
“I’m not sure if that’s really appropriate,” he said.
Dean examined it and was surprised by how much he actually liked it. He wasn’t usually a floral type guy, but maybe it was because Cas had picked it out specially for him that it hit differently. It almost felt like a brand of some sort, like Cas was claiming Dean as his by giving him something to wear that was reflective of his own essence. His eye color aside, the blue was a reminder of how Cas was an anchor in his life. He helped Dean feel stable, he inspired him to be brave, and he was wise beyond his years which helped Dean through some pretty difficult situations. With Cas, he felt at peace, and that was an amazing feeling.
*Also, I made some edits to this chapter because I overlooked some stuff from previous chapters that messed with continuity. Nothing major, but it bugged me. This is what happens when I go on hiatus; I forget my own stuff. Rip
“Uh yeah. Me too, man,” Dean finally managed before he looked away, trying to find a way to change the subject before Cas could say anything else to fluster him. “So, um, Homecoming. I’ve never actually been to one of those dances before.”
“What?”
Time skip: 2 Days
“Hey.”
“I guess I can give you a pass on this one,” Dean replied. “It is beautiful.”
"Dabble? I have a regular schedule," Crowley said, proudly. "There's a restaurant downtown that lets in minors before nine, so I do dinner performances on Fridays. Look me up. Crowley, King of Hell."
“I’m not really sure. For the life of me, I can’t recall the last time we went on an actual date,” the angel admitted, “We mostly just do casual couple things around the bunker or sometimes we will go out with Sam and Dean’s hunter friends.”
“I never said you needed to jump from partner to partner. I just meant that you should date someone who can guide you through these new experiences and enjoy them in their entirety alongside you.”
They ended up watching a few movies from the 90s that, while stereotypical, were included because Cas wanted to showcase progression in media. He listened fondly as his boyfriend detailed the significance of certain scenes. One in particular held special importance to him. It was from the Birdcage. Armand and Albert were sitting together on a bench near the harbor, discussing their relationship. It was simple, but genuine, and it made Cas tear up a little because it had been his first exposure to a positive queer experience. Unlike many stories that ended tragically, this one gave him hope that he could one day have it all with someone- a home, a family, a shared life. He deserved it as much as anyone else which was something he had often doubted. It was touching to see Cas so emotionally impacted, and it made Dean want to wrap his arms around him and never let go for as long as he lived. Smiling, he reached over to wipe a tear from the boy’s cheek. Cas blushed, embarrassed by his reaction but endeared by Dean’s gesture. He leaned into the touch.
“Promposal? That’s kinda lame, isn’t it?” Dean groaned.
“Um,” Dean bit his lip.
“Live and learn,” Dean shrugged. “Anyway, that’s the one. If I remember correctly, the burgers were pretty awesome.”
“Creepy? Most people think I’m charming,” Crowley acted insulted.
“Oh, um,” Dean cleared his throat, awkwardly, “I’m fine. I was just waiting for my brother, and I guess I spaced out. Sorry for blocking your stuff.”
“Can you lay with me? Just for a few minutes.”
Later that night, Cas laid in bed, fiddling with his ring. It was nearly one in the morning, and although he had managed to stop glowing after a few hours, he was still so full of energy that he couldn’t sleep. It took everything he had to keep from giggling like a schoolboy with a crush every time his eyes fell on Dean who was curled up next to him, snoring, softly. He had crashed around eleven when they got back to the bunker, having endured too much emotional vulnerability for one day. His last words before passing out were “goodnight future husband” which was on repeat in Cas’s head. Yawning, he snuggled closer to Dean, his bare chest pressed up against the other man’s back. He breathed him in before placing sweet kisses to his hair and the back of his neck. The other man shifted slightly, but he did not wake.
“I told you already. This isn’t for a case. It’s just something I need to do.”
“What are you, the grammar police?”
“You deserve it, Castiel,” the boy hugged him. “I love you, Dad.”
John shook his head.
Some domestic Dean/Cas moments. Some embarrassment for the boys. Crowley introduces a new problem for the group.
“Uh yeah, that would be great.”
“Cas has got a boyfriend. Cas has got a boyfriend,” Jack cheered.
From: impala67@gmail.com
“Yeah, man. No worries.”
“Cas?”
____________________
Dean sighed and set the bottle down on the nightstand before settling onto his bed. He was facing towards Sam, but his brother kept his gaze on whatever he was working on.
“Then what about you?” Dean asked.
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean stood up and headed for the door.
“That’s why you are going to lead,” Sam responded as he searched through some CDs from Dean’s personal collection.
“Listen, you and your boyfriend better get down to school as soon as possible.”
“Awe, come on, Cas. Not even a kiss on the cheek for old times sake?”
“When you’re done, meet me in the kitchen. I’ll make us breakfast,” Dean called after him.
“I’ll meet you out back. I just have to talk to Dean for a second,” Sam kissed her cheek and guided her back towards the kitchen.
“Probably.”
“Mr. Macleod, you have a right to be upset, but please watch your language.”
“We don’t want to fight,” he said firmly. “We are only here to drop off Sam, and then I’m taking Cas home. I’ll be back later. If you’ve sobered up a little by then, maybe we can talk this through like mature adults, assuming you’re even capable of that.”
“Good is an understatement.”
“That’s just it though,” Dean sighed. “I think I am ready. Or at least I’ve reached the point where I can’t stand hiding who I am when I’m with him anymore. He’s my brother, and he should know the truth. If anything, for my own sanity.”
“Is this…” the angel couldn’t even find the words amid the swirling cloud of emotions he was experiencing.
“Sorry, Sammy. You rooted for it,” Dean laughed.
“Um, excuse us,” Cas said, eyes widening.
“It’s not your problem, Sam.”
“You can do this,” he whispered to himself.
“Thanks,” Dean said with a smile.
“The bible.”
“I know, but I wanted to. I also made us reservations for dinner at a steakhouse a few towns over for tonight. I’ve never had steak before, so I thought it would be nice.”
“Actually, you never know,” Sam began, “Dean could end up with a date by the end of the night.”
“Fair enough.”
“Have a secret boyfriend. Not that it would justify stealing your phone, but you know...curiosity,” Dean chuckled a little, and Cas glared at him.
“You’re worse than Gabriel,” Cas mumbled.
“I think I want to come out to my dad.”
“You don’t need to worry about me. I’ll be fine,” as they pulled apart, Dean gave a solemn smile. “I AM fine.”
“Yeah, and the pet store. It’s not a total lie though. I’ll pick up some dog food while I’m out, and I’ll take Miracle for a walk before heading back to the bunker. Assuming Eileen doesn’t wear her out first,” he laughed a little.
For the duration of the parade, Dean wore the stupidest of grins and looked like a love struck idiot with the way he kept playfully bumping into Cas. Such casual contact in public was freeing, and he couldn’t get enough. It was exhilarating. Sure there were some judgemental stares and eye rolls from conservatives in the crowd, but it didn’t matter. The only thing on his mind was his goofball of a boyfriend who at one point along the route took a flower from a little girl that offered it to him and put it in his hair. He wore it proudly as he marched.
“As for sex itself, the girls I was with all expected to get it on at some point. Some wanted to wait longer than others, but at the end of the day, sex was important in all my past relationships. It helped us feel closer to one another, and it was fun. Man, was it fun,” he bit his lip, suddenly regretting that last part. “However,” he cleared his throat. “It definitely wasn’t everything which is part of the reason my relationships never lasted long, aside from me moving all the time. The sex was temporary and did not compensate for overall emotional chemistry which I didn’t really have with any of them. I do have it with you, though, and while it will be an adjustment, I am willing to transition to other forms of intimacy. Afterall, you’ve given me something I’ve never really experienced before, and I’m not sure I’ll ever experience it again if I don’t jump at this opportunity.”
“He doesn’t need to be involved,” Dean groaned. “I’ve put him through enough. Besides, like I said, it’s all good,” he sniffled a little. “Um, hey what do you say we grab some takeout for lunch today? I was thinking…”
“I guess you’re right. Maybe we should start. We could have an every other week deal. That way you can have some weeks where it won’t interfere with your social schedules.”
“So not only are you gay, but you’ve been lying about where you’ve been every Friday afternoon. Great…”
“Alright noted. I guess I should get some shoulder pads then.”
“If I told you, it wouldn’t be a surprise, would it? Now, come on. Put some pants on and meet us in the kitchen.”
“Awesome, buddy. You’ll have to show me later,” Dean patted his brother on the back and then turned to Castiel again. “I’ll see you around, I guess.”
Dean grinned, proudly. For a few moments, they sat and ate in silence. Cas stared out across the lake, admiring the way the moon shone on the water. It was peaceful, dazzling. Then, he turned to his partner, the look of wonder on his face never wavering. Dean glanced up from his dessert and raised an eyebrow.
“Charlie forgot her wallet at the diner, and when she went back in to grab it, she got caught up flirting with the waitress,” Claire mumbled.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Me too,” Dean managed. “I guess dances aren’t that bad.”
“Crowley? What are you…what number is this?”
“Sounds like a solid schedule.”
“Discuss what?”
“Yeah, well, I gotta keep an eye on Sammy.”
“Wait,” Cas began. “It was my idea to do the parade to begin with. It’s my fault we are in this mess, and I owe it to everyone to protect them from any harm caused by my decisions…” he paused for a moment, glancing solemnly at Dean. “We’ll do it. And until further notice, I am going to step down as co-president since my ambition seems to have gotten out of hand.”
“Really?”
“I’m only being honest.”
“Great! Come with me. We’ll go check out some jackets,” she walked past Castiel and motioned for him to follow.
“Yeah, sorry, I was just processing,” Sam blinked a few times, “Wow.”
“What about Dean? What will he think?”
“How is Cas?” Sam said.
“That’s good to hear,” John took a plate from his son and dried it with a towel. “I’m still a bit rusty in the kitchen, but I was thinking of trying some kind of fish next time. Salmon maybe.”
Then, of course, there was the “small” issue that he and Sam hadn’t heard anything from their father since he stormed out. Dean had told himself that this was just another one of John’s trademark temper tantrums, but deep down he was scared that maybe it wasn’t. Maybe this time their dad wouldn’t come back. If that was the case, what would that mean for them? Dean was less worried for himself than for Sammy. He was eighteen and could figure something out, but Sam...he was still a kid. It’s not like Dean could get custody since he didn’t have a stable income or a house of his own. Plus, he was probably too young to apply anyway. He pictured Sam in some foster home far away where they couldn’t see eachother, and the thought sickened him. And an even worse thought came to mind as Dean finally locked eyes with his brother: what would happen if John did return, but only for Sam? What if he kicked Dean out, and Sam was left alone to deal with their father’s neglect? If that happened, Dean would never forgive himself.
“No, that’s alright. I prefer it this way.  I’m really not comfortable undressing in front of others.”
“I guess that saves us the trouble of telling you then. Can I go back to sleep now?” Dean rolled over and covered his head with a pillow.
“Uh yeah. Sorry. I’m not used to compliments is all,” Dean cleared his throat and then proceeded to park and exit the Impala.
“There you go. Lots of smart people around. Maybe you’ll make some friends,” Dean smiled at him, but Sam maintained his neutral expression. “It’ll be different this time. You’ll see.”
Dean pulled his arms in and let his hands hang just ahead of his chest. Then, he lowered his head and leaned forward a little to help simulate the T-Rex stance. For good measure, he pretended to roar. Sam watched him fondly. Dean was always good with kids.
I would like that, but aren’t you worried about Gabriel or one of your other siblings listening in? That’s why you never want to text. A phone call is even more public. Plus, it’s late.
“Oh, well that’s cool, I guess. I’m not getting why you felt the need to hide that from me, though.”
“That’s great. Is she going to come to a club meeting?”
“Nothing happened. He said no.”
“Maybe…” Dean stared down at his shoes, swaying uncomfortably.
“If you say so, Dean,” Cas chuckled. “Hey, where are we going anyway? This isn’t the route we took to get to the restaurant.”
“There’s that too. You could’ve just handed me the paper towel, but you insisted on doing it yourself. Why?”
“Don’t chicken out on me. I’ve been waiting for you two dumbasses to tie the knot for years,” Sam grinned, cheekily.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas’s fingers intertwined with Dean’s, and he squeezed, lightly.
“You,” the angel smiled, softly.
“Cas is a lazy ass who refuses to get out of bed, so I thought I’d give him some motivation,” Dean grinned. “I think it’s working.”
“Ok fine. I like somebody. What of it?” he rolled his eyes.
In addition to his fears regarding peer acceptance, he was also continuing to face the fundamental dilemma-coming out. He had this ever-growing sense of dread for putting his deepest, darkest secret on display because not only did that mean others would know, it also meant that he’d be forced to confront his insecurities. Like he had told Castiel, he had always known that he wasn’t like other kids, but he never wanted to admit that to himself. He shoved it down, tried to ignore it, but denial wasn’t going to be an option much longer. His heart raced just thinking about it.
“Awesome,” Dean tried to appear excited, but his tone fell flat.
“Does Dad know?” panic trickled into the older boy’s voice.
“Inappropriate?” Crowley questioned.
“I love you too, Cas. That’s why I’m worried. You seemed to be feeling good back at the bunker.”
“Thanks for helping me with this, Sammy,” Dean said as he pulled Cas’s gift off the shelf.
“Is this going to be a regular thing?”
“Yeah. I just wish he would drive rather than fly. Those things are giant metal death traps.”
“So, what are you trying to say? That you don’t think you and I would work? Why not?”
“What about Sam?”
“I’ve been trying to plan something special for Dean for Valentine’s Day, but I have no idea what to do.”
“That’s correct.”
“That’s ridiculous. You like girls.”
“Then why did you lie to him about where you’re going.”
“Should we wait out here for him?” Dean asked.
“That’s because I wasn’t, jerk,” Sam grinned, flashing his own ring. “It was Eileen.”
“Sure, I just need to make a quick stop first. I told my brother I’d meet him in the cafeteria before his thing with the debate team. Is that alright?”
*HOMOPHOBIA WARNING*
“You’re welcome to come back later if you don’t want to sit around and wait for them,” Cas suggested. "I'm sure there's more interesting things you could be doing."
Cas was silent. Though he had a speech prepared, he concluded that no words could describe what he was feeling at that moment. The ring in his own jacket would have to suffice. Taking it out, he handed it to Dean. It took a moment for the other man to realize what was going on, but once it clicked, he was beaming.
“Soda or juice?”
"Drag is an artform, Dean. It's about self-expression and pressing boundaries related to gender. The terms "king" and "queen" are just descriptors that some people use, but in reality drag can be whatever a person wants to make of it. It doesn't have to be a binary thing," Cas explained.
He paused again to check in with Cas. This time the boy made a motion for him to go on. Still no apparent emotional response.
“Positive,” leaving the platter for Dean, Cas grabbed the bottle of soda and the chips and left the room.
“But you don’t have to say no. We can figure things out together. Set boundaries and whatnot.”
_______________
Dean shrugged.
“About?”
“Sorry,” he muttered. “I didn’t mean to crash like that.”
“I figured as much,” Cas replied, plainly, “but the point is that someday you might want to. Most guys do, and I don’t think I’ll be able to give you that.”
“What do you mean?” Cas scrunched his eyebrows and gave Dean his usual confused head tilt (it was rather adorable actually, and no matter how many times he saw it, Dean still couldn’t keep himself from smiling.)
“You don’t have to go. Sam and I are cool if you’re here.”
“Whatever. It’s still weird.”
“Isn’t that an autumn pie? It's February.”
“You shouldn’t have to thank me for decency. It’s not my business one way or the other who you go for. That’s your thing and my job is to support. Simple as that.”
“It’s been a long day. Sam and Dean could benefit from some rest,” Cas said. “Myself as well to be perfectly honest.”
“Good. Now, I gotta go. I’ll see you boys soon.”
“I am. It’s just that...well Charlie is walking with the band, and Crowley isn’t a student anymore - not that he would want to walk with us anyway. Meg is going to be out of town, and I’m afraid it’ll just be me out there by myself.”
“New phone. Mother tossed mine out a window Saturday night. Don’t ask.”
“They’re here to express their disapproval with our inclusion in the Homecoming festivities.”
“Mom isn’t here,” Dean began. “You can’t speak for her, so take the guilt trip and shove it. Also, I don’t give a fuck about what you want because this isn’t about you.”
“It’s complicated.”
“I know, I know. Sheesh, just messing around.”
“It’s oversized.”
“No, I did. Because I let you get taken away without knowing you were loved,” Dean choked on his words, “And that kills me. If Jack hadn’t been able to bring you back, I don’t know what I would’ve done. Afterall, what would be the point of freedom if I couldn’t use it to be with the one person that understands me better than I understand myself? You are the best thing to ever happen to me, Cas. I love you so fucking much, and I promise I’ll never let you go again.”
“Do you really believe that?”
John released his hold on Dean and stared at his youngest son in shock. Sam, noticing the marks on Dean’s arm, felt sick to his stomach, but he did his best to appear headstrong.
“Dean,” this time John was stern; he obviously had caught on that something was up.
“No, it’s not that. I just…you know, what my dad said to you earlier. It was pretty fucked up.”
“Dude, I’m just getting out of the shower. What do you want?”
“Hey Cas,” Dean greeted. “I made you something.”
“What is it, Dean?”
“I’m not desperate, darling,” Crowley chuckled a little. “As I said, it was merely something to alleviate the growing sense of boredom. I could get anyone I wanted if I tried, but I’m not in a hurry to be tied down.”
It was empty. Dean frowned. He checked the next set of restrooms in the hallway over, and still nobody. Frantically, he dialed Cas’s number and waited through a few rings before a voice on the other end finally put him at ease.
“Cas! Your date’s here!” Gabriel smirked at Dean as he ushered him and Sam inside.
“I’ve done a lot of research on it because for the longest time I thought I was broken. But it turns out such feelings suggest that I might be on the Ace spectrum.”
“Cas, are you sure they’re gonna be alright with me tagging along?”
Cas stared at him for a moment. Dean imagined the gears turning in his head as he considered the offer and possible ulterior motives (of which Dean had none...like he said, dances were cliche, and he totally wasn’t hoping to end up on the dance floor with Cas during a slow dance like in some chick flick that he would deny liking...obviously). He swallowed, the redness returning to his cheeks.
“Is that a thing?” Dean looked to Cas. “Do I give off a vibe?”
“Not likely. All the windows in the house are sealed at night since Hannah and Jack both catch colds easily. Plus, it wouldn’t have caused it to close completely” Cas replied.
“What? A guy can’t just listen to his music?” Dean turned up the radio a bit defensively.
“Cas is in robotics now? I thought he had his own thing. Remember when you asked me to help you guys carry food, but I had to practice?”
“Dean,” before the angel could say anything, Dean’s mouth was on his. “Mhm,” he tried to pull away, but his partner’s lips were always so damn intoxicating.
“Dude, it’s freezing. You shouldn’t be out here.”
“You love me?” he stammered.
In lieu of a response, Cas just went for it. His lips were pillowy and tasted a bit like candy from the chapstick he had applied earlier. It was a gentle kiss because Dean didn’t want to overstep, but he could see himself becoming addicted to the feeling the action gave him in the pit of his stomach. He was reluctant to pull away, but the buzzing of his cellphone forced him to.
“Hi Eileen. I have some people I want to introduce to you,” Sam motioned to the two boys that accompanied him. “This is my older brother, Dean, and this is his partner, Castiel.”
“I was just a little caught off guard. It’s not a big deal,” Dean hated making him feel guilty.
“It doesn’t matter. You’ve already exceeded anything I could’ve imagined.”
“If you do, just breathe and remember that this is a moment for empowerment. You are taking control of your happiness, and it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks.”
“Being a part of Pride Alliance doesn’t necessarily equate to homosexuality, you know.”
“It is to me. I feel bad.”
Fuck. Dean bit his lip as he tried to come up with an answer. He couldn’t, and he resorted to being defensive again.
“Dramatic much?” Sam was taken aback by the change in Dean’s tone, “Ok, I swear. Now, out with it.”
“My mother is a teacher, so technically I can still participate.”
“Well, then I think we both deserve some glory, don’t you?”
“Was that all?”
“Dean’s afraid of flying,” Sam informed Cas after spotting the confused expression on his face.
“Great! Here,” Castiel reached for a piece of paper from the table and handed it to him. “The meeting begins at 3:30, but the first twenty minutes will most likely just be conversing over snacks, so if you need to be a bit late, it should be fine.”
______________
Dean ceased his torture. Cas, breathing heavily, rolled out of bed and stood up to glare at him.
Before Sam could respond, Eileen emerged from the other room with Miracle barking and joyfully nipping at her heels in an attempt to get her to play. Dean’s expression softened upon seeing them.
“I mean yeah, but just because we’re both into dudes, it doesn’t mean...” Dean rubbed his neck, instantly regretting this conversation. “It doesn’t mean we need to be hooking up,” his face was a deep red now. “And you know, I’m not sure if I’m ready to even have that kind of relationship with someone right now. There’s a lot I need to figure out first.”
The front door shut behind him as John departed for “boy’s night,” the keys to the Impala disappearing with him. No keys meant no means of escape from what was bound to be the most uncomfortable conversation of Dean’s life. His heart was in his throat as he made last minute preparations. Be brave, he told himself. This is your moment.
“Geez, you really are serious.”
“Technically it’s not over until nine, but the energy is going down in there. Jo and I were actually thinking of taking off ourselves, and so were Claire and Kaia. Although, that might just be so they can go home and make out.”
“Hi Dad…”
“I want my toothbrush.”
The other man didn’t respond immediately. Instead he smiled and grabbed both Dean’s hands, pulling them up to his mouth to kiss each knuckle.
“He’s really nervous about tomorrow night,” Sam clarified.
“Sure, but this seems different. I know I joke about sex all the time because it’s funny to get him all flustered, but I’m never serious because he’s not that kind of kid. He didn’t say it in so many words, but I think Cas might be asexual. If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. He’s never been into anything remotely sensual, and he doesn’t seem to react to a person’s appearance unless he already has a strong bond with them. Even then, it’s more of an aesthetic appreciation than a sexual drive. Also, he has always been a bit self-conscious of his body, so I don’t think he’s in a hurry to strip for anyone.”
Dean sighed. Every source he found said that the specifics could vary from relationship to relationship which meant that essentially he had to be prepared for any outcome. He wanted to be supportive, so the best thing he could do was open up the conversation. Cas didn’t have to answer everything at once- maybe they could even just take things as they come- but Dean wanted to show him that he was serious about respecting boundaries. There was one small problem though, and that was his own libido. He was pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes his body acted on its own. Of course, he had ways of handling it when alone, but he didn’t want Cas to feel grossed out or insulted in any way if he accidentally popped a boner or something when they were together and had to deal with it. Even more horrifying, what if it happened, and Cas felt bad? The guy already was struggling with guilt for the situation, so seeing a physical reaction from Dean may make it worse. Fuck, how would he navigate that?
“Hm?” Castiel rolled over and wrapped his arms around his partner’s torso, pulling him in so that he could take in his scent. “Morning.”
“So what?”
“You could at least be happy for them,” Charlie mumbled.
“Would you be interested in joining?” Castiel asked. “Our first meeting is Friday after school.”
“Years ago it was quite challenging, but this time it was different. It was rather pleasant actually. Maybe it’s because I have people I love with me, so I have a safe environment to experiment with new sensations and feelings. Or maybe it’s because I understand humanity in a way that I didn’t before. I can’t say for sure, but what I do know is that being human makes me feel closer to Dean. Honestly, I have never felt this at peace, this free.”
Before the Novaks pulled apart, Michael whispered something in Cas’s ear. Cas had an “O” expression on his face, and Dean wondered what had been said. He raised an eyebrow as Cas, without a word, wiggled out of the hug and rushed back upstairs. When he got back a few minutes later, he was holding a blue and white flower corsage.
Crowley frowned and set down his phone. Narrowing his eyes at her, he spouted something about how he was a star and that Cas could never handle him in a relationship. Let loverboy have his Prince Charming. Even if he did at one point find the guy attractive, he had moved on, and jealousy was beneath him. He had a line of better suitors in college anyway, just waiting for their shot at the King of Hell.
“Come on Cas, you know I’m just teasing,” she punched him, playfully.
“Your brother is confused, Sammy.”
“I’m not ‘afraid.’ I’m cautious. There’s a difference.”
Sam grinned at Dean to sell the point, but also because he’s a little shit and despite the stakes, he genuinely enjoyed the opportunity to embarrass his brother.
“What’s going on?” he asked, a hint of concern in his voice.
(Later that day)
“He has a nice face though, right?” Gabriel smirked.
“Get up! We gotta celebrate.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Asexual. Technically, it means I have little to no sexual feelings or desires. Although, experiences and levels of attraction vary, so it’s more of a rough definition. Anyway, the Ace spectrum is independent of romantic orientation which would explain how I can still desire a romantic connection to someone despite not wanting to have sex with them. Since I am usually attracted to men, I’d say I’m probably homoromantic.”
“Ok,” Cas whispered to himself upon completion of his exercises.
Dean let out another sigh and glanced down at Miracle.
“Who says?”
“You need time to process. That’s ok,” Cas’s hand ran up Dean’s arm to his shoulder where he squeezed gently; the smoothness of his voice elicited a shiver down Dean’s spine.“You don’t have to come with me if you don’t want to.”
“I was in first grade, Dean. It was my favorite series.”
“Well, you need to talk to him about it eventually. Definitely before the dance on Saturday. You can’t be there with that tension hanging in the air all night. It’ll make it weird for everyone.”
“It may be hard to understand initially, but there’s really no difference between what I have with Cas and what you had with mom.”
“He and his brother, Raphael, were going to pick up Jack, and then swing by on the way back to the house,” Charlie informed him. “He called just a few minutes ago to tell us he was in the parking lot at the elementary school which is just a few blocks away, so he should be dropped off soon.”
“So?” Cas asked, “The woman at the store said that I’d look good in something more colorful.”
“Um, engagement rings,” Dean said, softly.
“I am your father…” Dean silenced him.
“Yeah,” Dean hesitated, though he wasn’t sure why since Bobby had already been accepting of the whole thing. “That’s him.”
“Cas? What makes you think that?” Dean gave him an annoyed look, although he knew it was pointless since he was apparently so fucking transparent.
“And, Dean is supportive. He’s not going to do anything that Cas doesn’t want to do. Simple as that.”
Gabriel and Jack joined in the hug. Dean watched them both in admiration and with envy. See, this is what he had dreamed would happen for him. A loving family, despite everything. He knew that was a lot to expect from John, but a willingness to listen and some level of patience could’ve set them on a better track. It would still be challenging, but eventually things would have been ok. Instead, he walked out. He turned his back on them, and even if he did return, Dean wasn’t sure if he’d ever be able to forgive him. The asshole essentially took his heart and tore it into pieces, and that was not something he could easily forget.
“No, I was here in bed the whole time.”
“So, you knew,” Dean clenched his teeth, thinking about all the times his father had chewed him out for being too sensitive or being too affectionate with male peers.
“Oh, yeah. Uh, Sammy, do you think you could spare a few minutes before your meeting to help me and Cas set up some chairs for his club? His buddy bailed on him.”
“Dean, I’m scared that you’ll get hurt.”
“Little detour.”
“Ooo, does it have caramel? Dean likes caramel,” Jack returned to Cas’s side with two spiral lollipops in his hands, smiling proudly.
Cas grinned.
“Entry forms.”
“All sorts. Those things are generally a mix of different filled candies. Uh, coconut, raspberry cream, nuts, some are kinda fudgey.”
“Morning sunshine,” he whispered.
“Come on, you’re going to berate me for that?” Charlie was insulted. “Did you see her? That girl was a goddess.”
“Hey Dean,” Sam spoke for the first time since they left the apartment.
“Impressive. Um, is she very outgoing or more introverted?”
“Well, it wasn’t me cause I was out cold…Sam?” Dean looked up at his brother who now had his face covered by his pillow to block out any further instances of morning flirting.
“Right, well,” Gabe cleared his throat, obviously trying to change the subject. “Uh, I’m going to be going out tonight. Got a gig.”
Dean shuffled in the driver’s seat as he waited in Sam’s driveway. He had his hand on the handle, but he couldn’t bring himself to get out just yet. He had just gotten off the phone with Cas, telling him that he was going to stop at the pet store on the way back from the park (an excuse to give him more time). He hated lying to him like this, it made him physically sick. However, he couldn’t let Cas know what he was really up to. It would take away from the surprise, assuming he actually had the balls to go through with it. It was a huge commitment-marriage. A part of him thought he’d never be in this position and that he wasn’t good enough for someone, especially someone as amazing as Cas, to want to settle down with him. It still had him in disbelief most of the time that the angel even liked him. Dean Winchester, the repressed, alcoholic with daddy issues that attracted trouble pretty much wherever he went.
Castiel was now busying himself by organizing some pamphlets, so without looking up, he flipped Crowley off. The other seemed pleased by this reaction and continued.
As soon as Miracle noticed another voice in the room, she rose from her dog bed and rushed to say hello. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean stood frozen in the middle of their routine. Dean pretended to clear his throat and let go of his brother’s hands.
“Dean?”
Dean rubbed his eyes which were dry from staring at the screen for so long. Blinking a few times, he shut the computer and set it on the nightstand. That was the moment Sam decided to enter the room.
“Cas, you son of a bitch,” Dean laughed. “I am going to take a wild guess and say this means yes?”
Just then Dean’s phone began buzzing. He paused. Bobby’s name was lit up on the screen. The events of last night came flooding back into his brain, and his mood shifted a little. Waking up next to Cas and their banter had been temporary distractions, and he had nearly forgotten why he was there to begin with. A miracle really, considering the circumstances, but that’s love for you. He motioned for Cas to go on, and he stared at the device for a moment before answering.
“Uh huh. Sammy’s got a girlfriend, and I’m sure you have buddies from school that you hang out with.”
“Dean, you didn’t fail me,” the angel wiped a tear that he noticed was streaming down his partner’s cheek.
“Sam here is going to be a big shot lawyer someday,” Dean explained to Cas as he proudly wrapped his arm around his brother’s shoulder. “He’s going to Stanford.”
“It’s not your fault,” Dean kissed his hair. “Besides, it’s kind of nice to be alone like this.”
Another town, another school, another chance to (hopefully) get things right. At least that’s what Dean always told himself whenever his father forced him and his brother to drop everything to move hundreds of miles away for a job. It was a mantra of sorts that helped him to maintain his sanity despite the unstable conditions he lived in, and it had proven critical during the periods of abandonment when he was left to care for his little brother while his father went on business trips or was on a bender. More often than not, it was the latter. Sometimes Dean wondered how he even managed to hold down a job when he was only sober half the time. Then again, John Winchester had always been fairly adept at the art of bullshitting, so Dean imagined he was capable of putting on a show for his employers so they wouldn’t know he was drunk. Such bullshittery was also his go-to response for explaining his neglect to his sons. Unfortunately for John, Dean learned his lesson years ago and would not hesitate to call him out on being a pisspoor dad anymore. The last time he had done so had been just that morning before John left for a conference which is why he was now stuck walking to class on his first day. His dad confiscated the keys to the Impala until he returned which means that senior year was already off to a horrible start.
“Thank you, Dean,” he said, softly.
“Cas.”
“Which I imagine is why Cas insists on being there with Dean because he doesn’t have that support system.”
“Jack, I found some extra...oh no,” Cas returned to the room, shocked but amused at the scene in front of him.
Disclaimer: There is a time rewind in the second half of the chapter
“I knew it.”
“Huh? Why?”
“You were gone less than two hours,” Cas patted him on the chest. “Still, I’m glad you’re here. Look what Jack brought us,” he reached for the drawing.
I look forward to seeing you. Until then, take care.
“We’re not gonna judge you, Cas. You know that.”
“Meet me in the art hallway after school.”
Dean really wanted to speak about what had just happened, but the words were caught in his throat. Instead, he just nodded.
“Fuck Michael and his rules. Have a little fun.”
“I am. Dean isn’t. Where are you?” he typed.
“I did too.”
“T-Rex, huh?”
“Why not? Whatever it is, you might like it if you try out. You know, you should really expand your horizons.”
“Yes, sir,” Cas said.
Also, I do intend for this story to have a happy ending. Dean will come through, I promise.
“I don’t usually eat in the cafeteria,” he said, “It’s too loud and cramped. I get overstimulated.”
“I think I’ll survive.”
“What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” Cas smirked. “Besides, I need a break from this,” he waved his hand towards his computer screen, but didn’t elaborate.
Dean sighed, and a solemn expression suddenly fell upon his face.
“Why, if it isn’t the happy couple,” he smirked at them. “Hello, boys.”
“Sure, I guess it wouldn’t hurt. I’ll just need to grab my jacket from the trunk of the Impala…hey Sam, do you want to come or are you staying here?”
Shit. Mentioning Cas might’ve been a mistake. He glanced over at his brother who seemed to be preparing a response, and his stomach dropped. Yup, it definitely was.
“Who’s idea was this anyway?” he asked.
“We’re good, Cas. Really,” Dean smiled softly.
______________________
The Big Day: Part 2
“I did it for both of us.”
“I don’t want to take your food.”
“Yeah.”
“Yes, but I don’t want to intrude. I can just meet back up with you in the classroom.”
“I’ve always been ok with it.”
“He pulled me aside earlier because he wanted to talk about something that happened on Saturday back at the house.”
He shared a look with Dean who shrugged.
“What was the dream?”
“I said I’d think about it,” he didn’t intend to be flirty, but Dean found himself, almost by instinct, winking at Castiel as he spoke.
Sam smiled at them both and waived. He swung his backpack over his shoulder and headed off in the opposite direction. Meanwhile, Dean’s attention snapped back to the hand which was still clasping Cas. It felt nice touching him like this-comfortable as if they had known each other for a lifetime rather than only a week. Also the other boy didn’t seem bothered by it in the slightest. If he were to bet, Dean could’ve probably left it there for as long as he wanted without complaint, but he knew that, for Cas’s sake, it would be best to hold back until he was certain of what his feelings meant.
“Not sure. I told him on Monday that I intended to prove it to him that I was serious about this, but I’m stuck on what to do.”
“I suppose.”
Jack’s eyes widened, “Wait, is that...”
“I don’t know. Couple days, maybe?”
“It’s not about that. I know you didn’t mean anything. I just get anxious about my body sometimes. It’s nothing to do with you.”
“Maybe, but I can’t keep teaching on an empty stomach. It won’t take long.”
“Dean, if anything is to ruin my progress, it would be denying our relationship. I fought hard to get here, and I’m not turning back.”
He disappeared again and returned a few seconds later with a damp paper towel. Rather than handing it over, he proceeded to clean the marker himself. Dean held his breath as Cas held his head up to scrub. When he finished, his fingers remained on the edge of Dean’s jaw for a moment. Their eyes locked again, and there was no denying the flush in both their cheeks. Dean didn’t mean to, but he let his gaze drop to Cas’s lips. He licked his own. The action did not go unnoticed, but rather than addressing it, Cas pulled away. He didn’t look upset or even embarrassed. Instead, he gave Dean a solemn smile. If he didn’t know better, Dean would’ve said it was a look of someone longing for something. That couldn’t be though. Could it?
“Nah, it’s cool. Besides, he’d probably be willing to help too.”
“Yeah, I’m trying to cut back on red meat.”
“Just until things calm down.”
“It was definitely better than my previous experiences,” Cas paused, “Although, I preferred our time together in the hallway.”
“Um,” he coughed. “Yeah...but can we not go too deeply into that? I already feel like I’m about to spontaneously combust.”
Just as an aside, this chapter is actually loosely-based on something that happened at my own highschool. We had people protest several times because we had LGBT representation in the school. Luckily for us, the school responded adequately, and everyone was fine. It still sucked that stuff like that happened though.
“Gig?” Dean asked.
Cas reached around to unveil the mysterious object Dean was referring to. It was a cooler. Inside was beer (obviously) and something wrapped in tinfoil.
“That’s why Cas can’t know where I am right now. I don’t want him to suspect anything.”
“Thank you, Jack,” Cas ruffled the boy’s hair, affectionately, to show his gratitude. “Oh, and to address your initial question,” he smirked and held out his hand so his son could see the honeybee ring Dean had given him. “Dean and I asked each other.”
“What kind of chocolate does it have?”
Following Claire, they went down the line with Charlie next, then Kaia, then Sam. Crowley ended up putting his outfit choice back on the rack because he decided he would rather go the untraditional route and wear something from his personal collection. Apparently he had been working on customizing some suits for his show, and he wanted to test one out and see what response it got. That should be interesting, Dean had thought. During this time, Charlie continued blasting her playlist and nearly got them in trouble with one of the store clerks for disrupting the shopping experience for others. That was kind of an odd reason since they were the only ones in the store on a Monday afternoon, but most likely the guy just didn’t like the songs. Pouting, Charlie turned the volume down.
“You know what I mean. We’re supposed to be a team, right? That kinda comes with the whole relationship thing.”
“I thought you’d still be asleep,” Cas said as he entered the room.
“It’s good to know I can count on you,” Dean took in a deep breath and let it out. “Oof, this is such a relief to get off my chest.”
“Whatta dork,” he thought fondly.
“Might email you before if I start to lose my nerve.”
“I guess I can start then,” Dean let out a breath. “I did some research this week.”
“I love it. It’s amazing.”
“Alright, I’m going. Come on, Jack.”
“Uh huh, sure,” he glanced at the computer Dean had set aside.
“So…” Sam contemplated how he wanted to phrase his next question. “I don’t want to overstep, but are you and Castiel...”
“Here,” Dean reached into his pocket and pulled out a tennis ball.
“Yeah, you got it, Pooh Bear," Dean winked.
“That where you told him you’d be?”
“Well, I never expected him to return those feelings,” Cas swallowed, awkwardly. “It was a lot, so I pulled away before anything happened.”
“I’m messing with you,” she laughed. “To be honest, I think it’s been the best part of his day. It’s only been a week, but he seems so much brighter when I see him in the halls after your guys’ class. I think you’ve made an impression.”
“What do you mean? You saved me is what you did,” he said, firmly, “And I don’t just mean from hell. You’ve saved me from....well, me.”
“Hey Dean!” he looked up to see Sam waiving from the doorway.

“You didn’t.”
Anyway, thank you all for reading, and I hope you stick around.
“Um, robotics.”
“Hello!” the child raised one of his hands in what Dean assumed was a wave, despite the lack of movement. “My name’s Jack.”
“Anyone around? Sam? Cas?” it was Dean’s voice.
“He’s going to try and spike the punch bowl,” Claire laughed.
Cas sighed, “And I ride.”

“I won’t be enough.”
As the three of them exited the apartment complex, Dean glanced at Cas who had a clear question in his eyes: What now? Dean looked to his feet. Honestly, he had no clue. The most logical plan was to stay with Bobby for a couple of days and reevaluate when John calmed down. If he calmed down. Unfortunately, when Dean called, Bobby was in another state. Apparently there was some convention for classic cars, and he had gone to gain some tips for the renovation business. It sounded interesting, and on any other day Dean would probably beg for details, but there were more important matters on his mind. After retelling the events of the evening, Bobby agreed to try and catch the earliest flight home. It was heartwarming really how easily he accepted it and wanted to help. Still, it wasn’t an immediate solution. Dean considered booking a motel room, but he figured they should save what little money they had for food and other stuff. That left them with the option to sleep in the Impala which Dean wouldn't mind so much if it were only him. With Sam along, it would be too crowded.
________________
“Ok,” Sam urged him to continue.
“Yeah, well I must since Sam knew and my dad…” Dean’s voice trailed off, and Cas patted his shoulder.
“Why’s that?”
“What do you mean?”
Sorry this took so long to post. Work has been stressful and haven’t had motivation to write
“Well, he didn’t technically say no because I didn’t actually ask him to the dance,” Dean admitted, “I did talk to him though, and he’s not sure about the whole thing-about us being a couple, I mean.”
“It’s nice to meet you, Dean. Would you like a pen? They’re free, courtesy of Pride Alliance.”
“You knew,” Dean repeated, “and that’s why you were always so strict about the people I hung out with growing up. You didn’t want me to get too close to people you thought might be like me.”
“I’m just glad it fits. To be honest, I wasn’t sure what size to get,” Dean cleared his throat, awkwardly.
“All I’m saying is that I remember what it was like to be a teenager, and it can be difficult sometimes to navigate certain urges.”
Everyone nodded.
Dean’s mouth felt dry.
“I’m sort of busy right now,” Cas told him. “I’m with my friend,” he motioned towards Dean. “Can you say hello?”
Cas silenced him with a soft peck to the lips.
“Aw, my little brother’s in love,” he chuckled.
“Cas, it’s fine. I think I can handle it.”
“That’s good news, right?”
“Yes. Jack drew it himself. I thought we could hang it up somewhere.”
“Thanks,” he pulled, awkwardly, at his shirt collar. “But, truthfully, it’s been awhile since a guy has liked me like that. I’m kind of a specific type…” Dean could tell that there was something on Cas’s mind, but he didn’t pry. “Not that it matters. I’m not exactly looking for a partner or anything right now. It’s just kind of weird being by myself at a dance.”
“Hell yeah,” Dean ruffled the boy’s hair. “That’s a classic.”
Dean grabbed Cas’s hand and led him to an empty bench in a relatively unpopulated area on the other side of the mall. They sat down together, their hands still clasped. It took a moment before they would let go of each other. Cas angled himself to face Dean.
“Ok, what do you think?” Dean had been distracted and did not immediately register Cas’s presence until he heard his voice, asking for feedback.
The boys nodded and rolled off the bed. They followed Gabe downstairs for what turned out to actually be soup. Or rather a stew, and a damn good one at that. Michael sure knew his way around the kitchen, though Jack made it very clear that he helped by ‘stirring it to perfection’. Michael patted him on the back to reward him for his superior service.
“One what?”
Dean rubbed his neck awkwardly. He thought of Cas’s bright smile, his rosy cheeks, and his little stubble. God, he yearned to feel that against his face when they eventually kiss.
“I think your tongue slipped there, Dean. Either that or I’m hearing things,” his voice was still even.
“Hey Cas?”he whispered.
“Relax, it’s not that kind of mission. It’s personal."
“Are you going to tell him?” Sam asked.
“Castiel!” it was a small child, probably around four-years-old, with a bad case of bedhead.
Third time’s the charm because John took notice and gave him a confused look.
“Whatever. I’m a delight, and Eileen will be missing out.”
“I’m not sure, Jack,” Gabriel pretended to sound concerned. “This might be too much for a little guy like you.”
Once everyone was finally satisfied and made their purchases, they set course for the food court for a snack. Dean’s stomach growled in anticipation, but he made the tough decision to seize this opportunity to get away for a heart-to-heart with Cas instead. As they exited the last store, he grabbed the boy’s arm and whispered that he wanted to talk to him about something private. Naturally, Cas was confused, but he nodded.
“Alright, if that’s what you want.”
Charlie didn’t seem to notice the false enthusiasm as she had turned her attention to Sam. Smiling, she extended her arm.
Cas wasn’t on the floor. Instead, he was in bed with Dean. They were sleeping soundly which is exactly what Gabriel assured him they’d be doing. A small smile tugged at his lips. He shut the door.
“Yeah, but lunch is only a half an hour, so a few minutes both ways takes up quite a bit of relaxation and eating time.”
“So, the thing is...I had a dream a few weeks ago-a very vivid one-and it really got me thinking.”
Dean’s voice was a bit raspy, but his overall performance was commendable in Cas’s opinion. He appreciated the element of theatricality his friend gave to the song, and if his own voice didn’t sound like a train wreck, he probably would’ve sung along. He settled for humming and tapping his toes to the beat. Dean smiled but wasn’t entirely satisfied.
Castiel nodded in understanding and set the platter back down on the counter.
“Fuck, this is starting to sound like an after school special,” Crowley groaned. “I need a drink.”
“What an asshole,” Dean grumbled, “But wow, that had to have been draining to come out to so many people.”
Dean put the car in park which alerted Sam. He peered through the glass and immediately he was poking his brother’s shoulder (it was more of a jab really). Suddenly, his frustration returned.
“I’m proud of us,” Cas echoed.
“My name is Castiel. Dean and I go to school together,” he said.
“So, say it. You’re proud of us,” Dean urged.
“Definitely not,” a hollow laugh accompanied Dean’s response.
“What does she want?” Cas repeated.
“I will not apologize for appreciating art,” Dean smirked and then proceeded to kiss the top of Cas’s head. “It’s the finer things in life.”
As they ate, conversation was light. Michael asked some general questions about how Sam and Dean slept, what the plans for the day were, and how they were feeling about everything now that they had time to process a little. He didn’t seem suspicious at all, so Dean assumed he didn’t know about the door thing or how he and Cas had spent the night together. That was a relief. Other than that, though, everyone was too focused on eating to talk. And afterwards, they all dispersed to different areas of the house, leaving the three boys alone.
“Well, as hot as I looked with that mustache, you really shouldn’t draw on people’s faces.”
Cas smiled. Dean reached down again and grabbed the boy’s hand.
Crowley scoffed, but it wasn’t very convincing.
The next person to say something was Claire. She offered them both a “congratulations” before punching them in the shoulders. To Dean’s surprise, it actually hurt quite a bit, but he was determined not to show it. It became a little harder when Kaia came up because he worried she would mimic her girlfriend’s sign of affection. Luckily, she just went in for a hug (only after Cas found a safe space to lay aside his honeypot because he was worried about dropping it). A few others followed with their own friendly statements and offers of support. They appreciated it greatly, although Cas was shocked to see that some of them, namely Balthazar, were even in attendance that day. It was a nice surprise.
The other boy blushed a little.
Sammy is asleep too. I could go to another room. Give me a sec.
“Right this way,” the host grabbed some menus and led the two of them to a table by the window.
“I don’t want to do it, but your safety is my number one concern.”
“Disappoint me? How could you ever….”
Dean hesitated, not wanting to get dragged into further trouble, but Cas answered for him.
“Yes.”
“You might be dehydrated. We’ll get you some water as soon as we get home. But...wait,” Gabriel hadn’t noticed earlier, but his brother’s eyes were raw. “Cas, were you crying?”
“That’s Crowley,” Dean finally said once he realized the guy wasn’t going to say anything unprompted. “He’s not a student, so I’m not entirely sure why he’s here.”
Castiel Winchester. That just sounded right. Out of the corner of his eye, the angel thought he could see Dean’s lips curl up slightly upon hearing the adoption of his last name. There might’ve even been a flush of pink in his cheeks.
“Sure,” Sam chuckled a little, and Dean’s face went red as he gave him a glare that stated: ‘Stop embarrassing me in front of my boyfriend.’
“Yeah, we’re lucky. Everyone’s been great.”
“Maybe, but it’s not the same as this,” Cas grinned and buried his face in Dean’s chest.
“He’s cute, I suppose,” Crowley shrugged like it didn’t matter. “Just a bit of fun.”
“I texted her about it, but her dad is just going to drop her off at school. Apparently she’s got some food sensitivities, and it’s easier for her to eat at home. I told her that was fine.”
A double proposal just sounded really cute <3 Can't wait to get into the actual date planning though.
“Oh yeah. Everyday he comes home gushing about whatever it was that you did or talked about at school. You’ve had quite the impression on him,” he punched Cas’s arm, playfully.
“Uh, I’m not sure. You know I don’t eat very often, Dean.”
“You don’t have any cameras around here ready to livestream to YouTube, do you? Am I going to go viral?”
“That sounds nice. Just let me put some stuff away, and then we can watch Finding Nemo. I know that’s your favorite.”
“Acceptable? You’re kidding, right?” Dean reached across the table to place his hand on top of Cas’s. “It’s perfect.”
Damn it, Sam. Stop asking so many questions.
“I won’t be alone. I have Sam.”
“Cas, you’re my little brother, and I love you, but you can be such a dumbass sometimes. Why can’t you get it through your thick skull that this boy is crazy about you?” Gabe said, sternly. “He’s not going to change his mind because he’s already devoted. You’re his best friend, and he wants you to be happy.”
“I know what you’re thinking. It’s a huge risk because he’s a homophobic prick,” Dean sighed. “That’s true, but like I told Sam the other night when I was discussing it with him, it’ll only hurt worse if I don’t tell him. Keeping secrets is exhausting, and it prevents me from doing what I want,” Dean glanced down at their joined hands. “Plus, I said I was going to prove to you how serious I am about us, and this is the best way to do that. Afterall, for as long as I’m closeted at home, I can’t give you everything you deserve.”
“Right, sorry. Spaced out for a moment there.”
Dean hummed in appreciation. Turning the key in the ignition, the Impala’s engine came to life with a roar which was music to his ears. Patting the steering wheel as if to praise a child for a job well done, he smiled. As they pulled out of the parking lot, he switched on the radio. Bon Jovi blasted through the speakers.
“Claire’s his cousin. We’ve hung out a few times with Cas and some of his other friends.”
Cas yawned, but didn’t move. Actually, he shut his eyes again. Dean rolled his, but he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t amused by Cas’s behavior. Still, this was important, so it meant he would have to bring out the big guns.
“Are you ok?” Dean inquired.
They stared at eachother for awhile. John looked like he was about to explode into a rage, and Dean braced himself for it, but ultimately nothing happened. There was just a sigh from his father, an order to finish the dishes, and the sound of the front door closing behind him as John disappeared. Dean placed the last plate in the cupboard and retreated to the couch where he sat with his face in his hands. He felt the cushion next to him dip a little which suggested that Sam had come to join him, obviously having overheard the fight and wanting to comfort him, but he didn’t look up. He didn’t say a word. He just sat there, thinking about Cas.
“I’m chaperoning the dance,” he said, proudly. “Or rather Rowena is. I’m just tagging along.”
I hope you enjoy :)
“Ok?”
“So, what’s up?” Dean asked once they reached the car.
“And what exactly do you plan on doing?” Cas asked.
“I haven’t even eaten dinner yet.”
“It’s not like I did it consecutively. I took my time and only opened up when I felt safe. It’s hard to be vulnerable like that, and depending on the person you are coming out to, you might have to get creative with the tactic. From what I’ve seen of Sam, though, he seems like a smart and open-minded kid. My advice is to just be upfront. Also don’t be afraid to set boundaries for yourself because he may have questions, and you are by no means required to answer anything that makes you uncomfortable.”
He hesitated before brushing his lips against the boy’s hair. Cas hummed a little. Dean quite enjoyed holding him like this. If only it were under different circumstances.
“Well, I’m not complaining,” Dean smiled and started playing with the angel’s hair, a sensation that nearly had the angel purring. “Sleepy Cas looks pretty damn cute.”
He pulled the Impala into his usual parking spot by their apartment and turned off the engine. He turned to Cas.
Sam sighed and put the earbud back in. He was not happy, which was indicated by the frequency of his glances towards the two of them. Cas narrowed his eyes at Dean, now realizing that his partner hadn’t mentioned what was going on to Sam. He obviously just made up some excuse for why they left the house so early.
