The Sabriel epilogue should be coming out sometime next week, but what do y’all think?
“Huh, you… uh….” Kevin snorted this time, clearly finding Gabes struggle funny.
“Daddy!” Claire shrieked happily, running into Dean’s waiting arms, who lifted her up and peppered kisses across her nose and cheeks.
“You should see him when the gas station runs out of kit-kats. That was nothing.” Dean frowned.
“I want to court Sam.” Dean nearly chokes on his own spit at that, turning to stare at the older Novak.
“Well sucks to be you, because I am,” he replied, looking grumpy. Dean blinked.
Cas pulled back after a second, leaning his forehead on Dean’s and panting slightly. “I love you the most too,” he murmured, smiling softly. Dean reached his hand up and tangled it in his angel's dark hair, kissing him softly once more.
And yet when that alpha bastard had kicked Sam, Gabriel had growled like it was a friend that had been hurt. For god's sake, he hasn’t even had a conversation with the man.
Okay, so this one is hella short, but it’s pretty important to the story.
“You’re no fun,” he pouted. It was silent for about 20 seconds before Dean spoke again.
“Very, very sad.” She said immediately. Dean nodded.
Castiel and Gabriel have a little chat with Alastair.
“Believe it or not, yes,” He snarks and Dean laughs.
“A snowman army, huh?” He asked, still chuckling. “Well, I wish him the best of luck.” Dean grinned, sidling over to the seraph and pressing into his side, clinking their mugs together.
“No, no way. They’ll kill you, Dean!”
“Why not?” At this Dean faltered, opening and closing his mouth a couple of times before answering.
All in all, it could have been worse.
He didn’t do anything though, the last thing he wanted to do would be to freak out the omega.
Hey, so this is pretty short, but... here it is!
“Very stressful.” He confirmed.
“Need help?” He asked, and Sam huffed.

“Don’t worry about it Cas,” Dean replies softly, abandoning the cereal cupboard. “You know what, I’ll just go back to bed. Tell me if you need anything, okay?” Cas nods.
“Two days.” Dean finished for him, feeling his stomach drop into his shoes. He had promised. That bastard had promised that if Dean did as he said, Sam would be safe. Shipping him out to Lucifer was as far from safe as you can get. But he couldn’t let Sam see him upset. He’s upset enough as it is, and Dean would rather die than give his little brother even more despair.
, he wrote.
Dean tried not to make a big deal out of it. He deliberately tried not to read into why Cas had stopped emailing him, without much success.
There are so many things he wants.
He nodded, even though Dean thought he seemed pretty skeptical.
“Um, hi,” Dean said. He wasn’t flustered, really.
He hugs Sam. They're both a little teary-eyed though this isn’t their first unlikely reunion (and with their luck it’s not their last, either).
Dean tried to watch the show even as his heart tried to pound its way out of his chest.
Cas smiled into his coffee. “Good.”
Dean grinned, already plotting the route in his mind. They would take his car, of course. He didn't trust that Cas' gold monstrosity could make the journey.
“A good idea?” Cas asked.
Cas hummed. “I’ve waited twelve years, what’s another five minutes.”
Dean still has hold of his coat sleeve, so he gives it a shake. "Uh, Cas?"
“Of course. But your instructions were very thorough, I don’t think I have anything to worry about.”
. Or, he would be, and Dean would make sure of that.
Actually, that was something Castiel tried very hard never to think about. But now, he stays silent. Hope builds in his chest.
. And he leaned in to kiss him.
So he ran after Dean when he disappeared into the woods in pursuit of the witch they had been tracking all week though he longed to fly. To appear before the witch and rid them of this problem before Dean even took another step toward danger.
As promised, his assignment was waiting for him in his inbox. He skimmed it quickly, like that would somehow save him from needing to participate.
“Though I could much easier maintain our cover looking for the bathroom on my own.”
Sure thing! Might meet up with Jody and the girls while we’re there. Be to yours at 6-ish.
Was it really so out of line to wish someone a happy Valentine’s Day?
Dean latched onto that. It was a perfectly reasonable and impersonal question. He took out his phone as well and tapped out an email.
Dean took a step back and considered the black fur and bright blue eyes as the wolf thrashed out of the tattered remains of his clothes. He shook his head.
He hit send.
“So, who’d you get?” Dean asked. He unwrapped a salami sandwich from his packed lunch.
“Yeah, man,” Dean said, “you better get that timing belt replaced asap. Those suckers can do a lot of damage if they snap.”
Dean shrugged. “Someone named Castiel Novak. I didn’t look them up.”
Dean thought back on the past year, how he was so sure the email exchange was going to be a waste of time. He had no idea how he'd gotten so lucky. He tightened his arms around Cas and hoped this would be the first of many holidays that they would spend together.
, he added. “That’s my baby brother,” he told the class.
They parted when the kiss dissolved into matching smiles, but neither moved very far.
“I love you, too.”
Donna nudged his knee with her foot. “Nothing Dr. Sexy can’t fix.”
Cas responded with a Christmas tree emoji and a smiley. Dean rolled his eyes fondly, and watched as outside it began to snow.
“Yes, I do not see the sign for the doughnut of the week. Is there not a new one today?”
If it hadn’t been for Gabriel and Jack–he stops that thought. What matters is they did. But it remains that their actions don’t have the ability to wash the spilled Grace from Castiel’s hands.
“Oh, good, um. Drive safe,” he said, feeling tongue tied.
Relief swept through Dean’s body and he sagged back into the couch. He read the email a second time. It was Saturday, he realized. Cas hadn’t even waited to be back to work on Monday to respond.
"What you said," he starts, "before. When... well, you know." He reaches out to touch Cas' shoulder, then slides his hand up until his fingers brush the hair at the base of his neck. Cas' eyes close when he gently brings their foreheads together. "You've already got me, you have for a long time."
“Dean, when have I ever-” Sam’s voice cut off when Dean hung up.
“Of course, Dean, I’m happy to help.”
"You do."
Dean followed him into the kitchen, intent on scrambling eggs while Cas started a fresh pot of coffee and poured a mug for himself and then one for Dean.
“It’s late. If you’re tired you can sleep here,” he says, like a coward. They both know Cas’ room is just down the hall, and that he’s been making that walk twice a night for the past month. Dean leans in to press a line of kisses up his neck, gratified when Cas tilts his head to make space for him. Eyes closed in the darkness like he’s hiding from the words, he murmurs “Stay?” into Cas’ ear.
Cas smiled, a wide gummy smile. “Hello Dean.”
“Dean,” Sam said, leading her by the hand, “this is Eileen.”
"Cas, I--" Dean clears his throat "I'm no good at speeches, but you gotta know that I, uh, me too y'know?"
"Yeah," he says, and he steps closer, dropping the knife onto the counter as he goes. He's deep into Cas' personal space but there aren't any alarm bells going off in his head warning him to leave room between them, to be careful. "I don't think I've been so sure of anything before." He breathes deep and repeats on the exhale, "I love you."
“We could, uh, use some help with this djinn case Sammy dug up today.”
“You know you’re welcome to visit me at Stanford, right?” Sam asked. This conversation was familiar ground for them. “You haven’t been out since you helped me move in before freshman orientation last year.”
He imagined, just for a second, their movie nights spent together in Dean’s apartment. Maybe after cooking something together for dinner. It was an appealing thought, even if it was kind of hard to imagine. He didn’t even know the exact shade of Cas’ eyes, or the sound of his laugh without the buzz of a phone connection between them.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice, clear as day, rang through his head.
Hey, so this is super short, but I wanted to do a sort of epilogue, and... this is what I came up with.
He had asked what was wrong, and Gabriel had told him that it was a couple of kids at school, just one or two broken ribs, don’t worry, it’s fine.
Gabe wouldn’t be waking him up unless it was urgent. Then why… Cas froze, the memories flooding back to him.
Feel free to tell me what you think!
Here we are! Enjoy!
like houses like other kids at schools houses was when he was eight. Gabriel had been ten at the time, and Cas had come back from school to find Gabe (who got out an hour before him in school) limping, holding his stomach.
Cas’ eyes shot open and he sat up ramrod straight, startling Gabriel off of him in the process.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Court me?” Sam interrupted this time, biting his lip as Gabe flushed bright red and started to step back, talking a mile a minute.
Even though she wore a mask, same as every other guard, Sam could
Kevin said that it was that alpha Dean's younger brother, Sam, but didn’t know how Gabe could smell him.
“But then again,” Gabriel argued, getting more confident now. He would not let Cassie be taken from him, “If he is, you will gain double the money. Besides, it is a good chance that Castiel will be an omega. After all, most households with alpha-omega parents have split genders, and you already have two alpha sons, father, so there is at least a fifty percent chance that Castiel will be an omega.”
“You okay?” Dean asked softly, knowing the answer but pretending not to. Sam pretended too.
“Really?” Kevin asked, disbelief in his tone. “I didn’t smell him, and we’re actually pretty close friends. How’d you do it?” Gabriel shrugged, looking uncomfortable.
“I dunno,” the omega murmured softly, smiling slightly as he stared at the alpha in front of him. “Care to find out?”
“Thank you,” He said, before turning around and grabbing another packet of the powdered hot chocolate Gabriel had snapped into existence the other day.
“Yeah...later, though.”
Alphas in black masks.
Cas bolted up the steps to their room, taking the stairs two at a time and tearing through the halls of the dingy motel, a hurt, scared, or dead Gabe flashing behind his eyes until he skids to a stop in front of their room, and is immediately consumed by rage.
Kevin let out a faint, anxious scent, one that only Gabe and Cas could smell, as inconspicuous as he could, Gabe released back a calming one.
And though Cas was obviously surprised by the spur-of-the-moment love confession as well as the use of his real name, he smiled, reaching a hand up to cup Dean’s jaw and kiss the human again, more gently this time.
“Remember what I said,” was all Dean would say, walking briskly, and pulling the Novak’s along with him. Castiel, who hadn’t spoken since the other two alphas had entered their cell room, moved his arm down minutely so that for all intents and purposes, he was holding Dean's hand. Then, he asked:
Enjoy!
Gabriel had a very vague remembrance of when his mother was alive, his beautiful, lovely mother, when the halls of the mansion were filled with laughter and love, but the moment that her rosy cheeks turned cold and she was lowered into the ground, Gabriels only comfort and love in this life was Castiel, his baby brother.
“Good! I and Sully played Rocket, and flew to Pluto! Then…” Claire continued to chat, Sam laughing and nodding as she narrated her stories.
Cas smiles brilliantly, pressing his nose into Dean’s neck. “Thank you,” He murmured, but Dean wasn’t done.
“Over here, Dean.” His little brothers soft voice drifted from the left. Following the voice, he found Sam curled up against the wall, hands over hiss knees and head leaning against the window.
“Sam… I know you don’t want to, but when I say so, I want you to—”
“Dunno,” He said cheerfully, “Just in a good mood, s’all.” Cas opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted.
“I guess.” She said. They lapsed back into silence, watching the TV while hanging upside down from the soft couch, bright red faces from the blood rushing upwards.
“I... uh… told him to run earlier, but I haven’t seen him since.”
If you asked Gabriel about the Shurley Estate, he could tell you about it in perfect clarity, despite the years he had been absent from its grounds.
He’s been sitting in the corner of the cell, muttering to himself about God knows  what, and every time Cas asks if he’s okay, he says yes, he’s fine, ‘nothing is wrong.’
“You better not be drawing a gigantic dick or something.” As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Castiel frowned, tilting his head to the side.
Cas took a deep breath as Dean let go of him, looking around at the sterile white room.
And for the first time since he got here, Cas thought that maybe,
“Cas?!” His voice sounded aggravated, anxious, almost as if, heh, as if he cared.
Happy December Sixth!
“You’re the one that popped my shoulder back into place?” Cas interrupted, an unreadable expression on his face. At this, Dean snorted.
“But,” Dean tried again. “If is our only option—”
And as Dean became a hunter, Sam became a manual slave. Cleaning the dingy halls and training rooms of the Company warehouse day after day, even after presenting as an alpha two years after being captured.
Gabriel held up his hands in defense, shrugging. “What?” He asked, and Sam shook his head, laughing again as he carefully took the candy from the omega, setting it in his lap.
Knowing this, Cas merely rolled his eyes. ”I removed the bucket, you can do foolish and childish things with your brother later, but I really want to finish this. Just five more minutes.” He told Dean. Sighing, Dean simply reached down and buried his hand in his boyfriends hair, playing with the short strands.
Next Prompt:
!” Gabriel finally interrupted again, before snatching a gun out of Dean’s hands and readying his own. “If you two motherfuckers don’t motherfucking
“Why would I paint a male testicular—“
And they didn’t, the only thing that even proved to Sam that they knew he was there was the swift and fleeting kick the right guard aimed at his ribs. Hissing at the stinging pain that coursed through his side, Sam waited until the two had rounded the corner then quickly scooted over to the training room window, knowing that the large glass frame that stretched from the ceiling to the floor was tinted, and that the trainer and the golden omega couldn’t see him.
. They’re hot, blistering hot, and feel as if they are going to burn holes straight through him. And then a voice.
“I… I love you too. More than anything.”
This is very, very short, and I apologize, but my brain fritzed and this was all I could think of doing.
The simultaneous thunder and lightning made them both jump.
He spends the fourth and fifth day lying on Dean’s bed. The pillow still smells of Dean’s shampoo, and he breathes it in slow and deep, wishing the scent could ease the weight crushing his chest.
“No,” Dean interrupted, pulling back to meet his eyes, “I really do. You said this was something you could never have, and that’s on me.”
Sam and Jack get along very well, and Castiel is distantly glad. He can’t bring himself to speak much to either of them, not yet.
Dean loops an arm around his waist, says, "I love you.”
Dean checked the time, but thankfully he still had a few minutes before it was time to open the door, so he replied immediately.
Dean's not sure who leans in first, but suddenly his mouth is occupied with Cas' chapped lips and all thoughts of worry are gone. This right here is exactly where they both belong.
Dean started stacking the chairs on the tables as Charlie closed out the register.
Dean got out to open the trunk and waited for them to disengage from what looked like a rib cracking hug. He ignored the stink eye he was getting from one of the security officers for being parked in a loading zone and leaned against the Impala to wait.
“You know,” Cas continued, “there are only three more weeks until winter break.” Dean had no idea where he was going with this. “Maybe we could find the time to… hang out,” he said the words slowly, like he did when he was sharing something one of his students had said that he didn’t understand.
And maybe after a couple weeks had passed in silence Dean had realized he was kind of being an idiot. Cas had told him to keep in touch, knowing full well he’d given Dean his number.
Dean skimmed the email as it went on to refer to their school district’s strategic plan and how they wanted to initiate more change and collaboration in the future. The end of the email included a link to the survey where he could give his feedback on the experience. There was a note of finality to the whole message that grated on Dean’s nerves.
Two more shots followed the first one, and all Sam could do was run faster, tears streaming down his face and self-hatred roiling in his stomach.
Cas doesn’t remember his mother very well, if at all. She died when he was young, and when she did, Chuck had ridden the estate of any sign that she had ever existed at all. But Gabriel, who had three or four memories of his mother, had told Cas that later on, only a week or so before she died, that she had smelled of acid and burning, and that she had been restrained to her bed, her screams echoing through the halls of the large mansion.
“It most definitely was,” Dean agreed, smiling. “Just a calm, quiet day of hanging around with nothing to do. I could get behind that.” Cas nodded.
“Love you,” The omega hums sleepily, and Dean smiles.
“Well, now I don’t want to tell you.” He said, pouting softly. Dean sighed, running his hand through Cas’ hair.
“What was that about?” Castiel asked Gabriel as soon as he walked up to him, “I saw you going into Father's office earlier.” Gabriel smiled and ruffled his little brothers hair.
“Dean, duck!” He yelled. Dean rolled to the side, knowing better than to doubt his brother. And faster than any member of the Company could react, Sam shot Azazel through the brain.
Feel free to tell me what you think!
But protecting Castiel became even more important, however, when Gabriel presented. The moment he woke up with a dull ache in his stomach and wet sheets, all he could think was ‘oh, shit.’
“Well, my name’s Castiel Shurley but changed it same as Gabe when we started running to Castiel Novak, I used to live in Shurley manor, with a few siblings and loads of cousins, I like bees, as you already know, and…” He paused, thinking of something else to say. “I can flip three burger patties at once in a pan.”
A scent abuser. And in a split second, the meeting of Alastair went from scary to mind numbing terror.

“Sorry! Sorry… it’s my fault, I-I mean—”  Dean stammered, obviously worrying that he hurt Cas. Feeling guilty, Cas shook his head.
Let me know what you think in the comments!
Dean hums as he makes his way inside, having cleaned up the small table in the shed and now heading back into Bobby’s house.
I’m so sorry this is short and a day late; I got a major case of writers block and then my computer broke. On the bright side, it’s out now and won’t happen again!
“No!” Gabe interrupted quickly. “God, no. I was just wondering if someone would be looking for you.” Kevin sighed.
He remembers fighting about some stupid thing with Dean in his room, and his mother coming in, her scent sharp and almost painful with terror, telling them to go, to run.
PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!
“Why do they beat you? Do you deserve it?” Gabe’s never really felt bad for an alpha, but at this moment, he does. Dean looks like a lost puppy, obviously having no clue as to why Cas is even interested at all.
“Uh… yeah? But that’s not the point. The point is—“
Then the world turned on its side and faded to black.
Let me know what you think!
_________________________
“Shut your mouth.”
“You heard Kevin earlier. They’ll probably just kill me and Dean.” Gabe rubbed his hand up and down Sam’s back, sighing. After a moment he spoke up, voice firm and stubborn.
“Yeah, definitely,” He said softly, staring after the omega.
And for once, Dean gave him a gummy smile back.
Cas shut up, but his mind was still going a mile a minute. Observation? Yeah, that doesn’t sound creepy at all. But he didn’t have any more time to worry, because they were at another door, this one seemingly made out of iron. Dean didn’t knock on this one, and instead just opened it.
He flinched again when he thought about the poor omegas shoulder. He had tried his damndest to get the shoulder back into the socket, but had only gotten the joint to click back into place on the third try. So yeah, he deserved the pain.
After a second Dean returned his hug, burying his nose in his hair and sighing out softly, scent broken and hopeless.
“Nothing,” He said, twisting his lip in between his teeth. “It’s nothing.” Gabe nodded and turned back towards the yard, fingers fidgeting in his lap as he tried to find the courage to speak again. He didn’t know what it was, but the stupid knot head in front of him drove him crazy, he didn’t even act like the old alphas he knew, and he had no idea what to say.
“And sleeping beauty awakens!” He cries dramatically.

“It would’ve been a lot easier if Gabriel had just used his powers,” He grumped, plopping down onto the couch and crossing his arms. The archangel huffed and rolled his eyes.
Gabe was terrified. Even though he would never admit it, Cas could smell it in his pheromones clear as day. And the fact that his big brother, the man that he had looked up to his entire life, was scared, made Castiel more terrified than he thinks he had ever been.
“The feelings mutual, sweetheart,” He murmured into the ex-angel’s ear, grinning when Castiel shivered slightly at the close proximity. They intertwined their fingers and turned back to watch Frosty the Snowman once more.

I’ll try to finish this by Thursday, maybe Friday.
“Oh, just wonderful. They asked us nicely to roll over and when we did, they gave us a cookie.” He replied sarcastically. Kevin huffed out a cross laugh, and then sighed, the sounds of joints popping.
“Dean! What did you do?!” Sam nearly shouted, worry clear in his voice and on his face.
He could hear Cas shouting above him, telling him all the things he knows he is, but it still hurts for somebody else to say them. His voice was muffled, and tears streamed down Dean's face.
“Not in the slightest.” Gabe agreed. “Well, step one. Find out where we are.”
----------------------------
I will go more into that later on, along with punishments of helping a sold omega, but if your wondering why nobody helps Cas, Gabe, or the others, that would be why.
Enjoy!
“Okay. Could you, uh…” Dean cleared his throat awkwardly before continuing. “Could you lay down on the bed, on your stomach? Please?” Cas hesitated again before nodding, laying down on the bed and burying his face in Dean’s pillow, inhaling the gun powder and whiskey-like scent that rose up from it. He began to ask Dean what he was doing before all clear thoughts were wiped from his head, the moment Dean placed his hands on the ex-angels back.
“Maybe.”
But he’s still learning the difference between
“Cas… sweetheart… we’ve been dating for months. It’s okay,” he said softly, looking worried.
When Sam is 21 and Dean is 25, they’ll meet 23 year old Castiel and 25 year old Gabriel Novak.
“Gabriel did, a few hours ago. Something about traditions, I didn’t really pay attention.” Dean let out a huff of laughter, toeing off his shoes as he crawled onto the couch as well, pressing himself against Cas as he slipped his arms around the seraph's waist.
The world fading to black.
dreaming was because of Castiel.
Dean, who had stared at the omega squished against his chest like he had just eaten a puppy, backed up and cleared his throat.
“Yeah,” he said, voice barely above a whisper. He had told Sam about the Novak’s as soon as he learned about them, telling him about everything he learned from the file. At the news of the capture, Sam’s broad shoulders slumped.
And if Sam was to walk into Dean’s room later without knocking, looking for a book on some sort of lore and instead finding his naked brother and ex-angel tangled up in bed together, Dean’s hands still softly rubbing up and down Cas’ back, he really wouldn’t be surprised, would he?
“A fine point.” He then held out his arms and made puppy dog eyes at his boyfriend. “Now c’mere.”
“Shut up,” he muttered, looking towards the ground. Gabriel froze, then eyed his baby brother.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” Castiel began, eyes sparkling as he took a sip from his water, “What did you think of Pamela?” Dean, who had been staring at Cas with an awestruck look on his face, blinks then clears his throat.
“Nothing,” He said, biting his lip and gazing shyly up at his boyfriend. “I just… like that nickname very much.” At his answer Dean smiles, looping his arms around Cas’ waist.
“And I love you, Dean Winchester.”
Feel free to tell me what you think!
And that thought alone helped Cas take deep, relaxing breaths once more.
“Right,” She started awkwardly. “So… I’m Jody Mills and an alpha. That’s Bobby Singer, who’s a beta, and Alex…” She gestured to the dark-haired girl, who was rooting through her bag in an apparent search for something, “Is an omega.”
I wanted to leave it open ended, just to let you fill in the blanks of what might have happened, but you don’t have to panic just yet, I’ll still be doing a Sabriel and Destiel epilogue!
Dean lets out a slightly hoarse laugh. “I’m so goddamn glad Kevin won that trial.” Cas smiles, trailing a hand down the side of Dean’s face.
Castiel had fallen asleep a little over an hour ago, when the same guard as last time came into their little room and told them to go to sleep. Honestly Gabe didn’t know if it was night or day or afternoon. All he knew was that he needed to get his ‘beauty sleep’ so he could be a ‘pretty omega.’
The angel squeezed his eyes shut, taking in a rattling breath. “Sometimes, I’m just so freaking scared that you’re going to… leave. Go off, say that you never loved me to begin with. And—and it hurts. It hurts, Dean, and I can’t… I can’t…” Cas’ breaths were getting more frantic, and Dean hurriedly pressed his hand to his chest, exaggerating his breathing yet again.
The pair soon made it to the hallway were Castiel and Gabriel’s cell resided. Cas wanted to ask Dean something, he could tell, but didn’t for another few seconds.
Cas knew that something was wrong as soon as he walked through the door of the motel. For one, the receptionist, a nasty old beta woman that Castiel wasn’t a fan of, was chuckling bitterly, muttering something about omegas getting what they deserved.
I also have to apologize for the lack and inconsistency of updates, I had to fly down to Italy because of pretty bad family-related issues and didn’t have time to write anything. Although stuff is still pretty bad, I should be able to pull it together enough to write the Sabriel epilogue after this.
Dean was smiling behind his mask.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabriel and Castiel prepare to meet Alastair, and we learn more about Kevin’s backstory.
Once finished with that Dean moved over to sit next to his angel, leaning his head on his shoulder. “We’re pretty damn good at this, babe,” he remarked. Cas nodded.
“Sammy? You okay?” Dean asked softly, obviously worried. Blinking up at his older brother, Sam simply tilted his head slightly.
“So,” Sam said quietly, looking over Cas’ shoulder at Dean and Claire, “Your paper for the kid go through?” Cas sighed, rubbing a hand down his face.
——————————
“Whatever you wish, Cas.” He said and Castiel smiled once again, grabbing the lettuce and sticking it in the basket. At Dean’s questioning look the angel merely shrugged.
Castiel drops his eyes from Dean’s gaze. The guilt for everything he has done in the past to Heaven, to his brothers and sisters–it’s enough to make him mad. Heaven came so close to being wiped from existence, and he had played a lead role in it’s destruction.
"I don't know what you're thinking," Cas echoes softly.
The grandpa smiled. "They lived happily ever after," he agreed.
“I am. I was just removing the spare and the jack from my trunk when you called.”
Castiel ate like he hadn’t seen food in weeks, and then his head dropped closer and closer to the floor as he struggled to stay awake.
Cas opens his mouth to speak, and it’s now or never because Dean’s about to lose his nerve.
They reached the booth that was selling the spiced and candied nuts, and Dean's heart stuttered when he caught a flash of dark, messy hair. But then the man turned to greet them and take their order and Dean tried to ignore his disappointment when it wasn't who he wanted it to be.
And then he sent it to Cas, too.
The man paused and tilted his head in a way very similar to how he had done so in his wolf form. “I’m… sorry?”
“I socialize!”
“Yum, I love pie too,” he told her, and spelled the word slowly so she had time to write out each letter.
“Not in the kitchen, you don’t. This ain’t like slicing and dicing a demon.” He guided the knife they held to the onion to make a clean slice. “There, see?”
“We were on episode seven, were we not?”
“So,” Dean said after he caught his breath, “what do you think of our town’s little tradition?”
And he doesn’t see pity there, only understanding and love.
"Stop apologizing, Cas, I'm the one who should be sorry." Dean takes in a deep, shuddering breath. "It's just... It's been a lot to take in, you know? And then, when I thought you were gone again, for good, I couldn't..." He reaches out to touch Castiel's arm like he's reassuring himself that he's real.
Dean stared at the janitor, who didn't react to the silver Dean had just pressed to his skin. If it wasn't the janitor...
He closes the distance between them.
Dean’s face flashed open and hopeful, and Castiel could plainly see how he was trying to close off the expression. Before he could, Castiel continued: “I would really prefer that you didn’t stop.”
"Sure." It's about all he can manage but it's enough to get Cas to follow him to the table.
“Are you… is everything okay?” Sam asked.
“So, how many finals you got left?” he asked, thankful for the distraction as Sam went on and on about his criminal justice course.
“Ooh, thanks. It’s cold out there,” she said, cradling the thermos in her gloved hands. “You’re going to need more than that coat.”
“I don’t know Dean, some socialization might be good for you.”
“This about your high school teacher?” she asked, brows furrowed. “Maybe he’s just been busy. When do they start with midterms?”
Slowly, Castiel dropped his defensive position and looked at Dean with his head cocked to one side.
Greens, like fresh cabbage, maybe, and
Feel free to tell me what you think!
After a few seconds of inspecting his work, which was to scrub the floors in training room number 303 by hand, he deemed it clean enough and stood up stiffly.
It was silent and tense for all of three seconds, in which the two stood together, inches apart, Castiel biting his chapped lips and Dean staring at him with an enraptured look. Feeling incredibly uncomfortable, Gabriel cleared his throat loudly, and both heads snapped over to him.
He remembers his father and a strange man falling into the room, trying their hardest to rip each other to pieces.
“It, uh, it turns out that it's a lot harder than I thought. And you know, it's okay that you’re freaked, it's totally understandable if—“ This time he was cut off when Sam grabbed his arms and put them back on his chest, bending down slightly to press their lips together. Gabe froze at first but quickly melted into the kiss, winding his arms around Sam's shoulders as the alpha slipped his hands around Gabes waist.
Let me know what you think!
“Hey, take it easy,” he murmured to the alpha. “Don’t want to lose any more blood.”
“D-Dean?” Sam prys his eyes open, feeling as if they had been sealed shut with concrete.
“Right,” he said, picking up the six guns that lay on the floor. “We’d better get going. There are six bodies on the floor, and we weren’t exactly quiet. Pulling apart, both Cas and Dean nodded.
“You too, Bee-Boy.” This earns him a swift elbow to the ribs, and Dean laughs.
“I thought you said you removed the bucket?” Cas simply smiled, sighing happily and kissing below Deans ear.
Cas stepped around them and walked to the black 1967 Chevy Impala, smiling when his husband popped his head up from under her open hood. Beaming, Dean crossed over to Castiel, pulling him in by his waist and pressing their lips together.

It had come out of nowhere. Castiel had been wandering around in the bunker halls, just… thinking. About what he’s lost, what they’ve lost, what had been gained in the process. Still unused to the way his heart started to throb in his chest, and not understanding

Dean grunted at the weight of a full grown omega falling into him, stepping back a bit, keeping a firm but gentle hold on the two Novak's arms.
“And I wonder why?”
Dean stood up, sighing. “I’ve got to go.” He made his way to the door of the cell, but paused before leaving. “We’ll get out, Sammy, I promise.” He swore to his brother softly before leaving to go rescue Castiel from Casey The Bitch. Sam kept his eyes on the floor but nodded briefly.
I had a lot of fun doing this, and I hoped you enjoyed reading it! I’m thinking of maybe doing this again next year or with a different holiday, and if you have any ideas for this type of a fic a day thing feel free to tell me, I might actually find time to write it in the next millennia!
“Ye-es, in fact, it’s possibly the best idea I’ve come up with in a long, long time.” Alastair clasped his hands together again. “Now, as you know, you’re pretty much the cleaning lady of this warehouse, and this was a totally spur-of-the-moment idea of mine. But it turns out, nobody else ever thought to have an alpha Cinderella. God knows why, probably because omegas are the big thing.” He rolled his eyes dramatically. “However, alphas have a VERY good work ethic, and are a LOT stronger, for moving things! Now, as you are already whipped into shape, how do you feel about going down to the Company’s main headquarters to meet Lucifer, who is actually VERY interested in the idea?” If possible, Sam's hands shook even more.
I’ve gotten more than a couple of furious comments on how I ended this, and I can’t say I blame you. The problem is that I don’t want to try and write a bunch of legal stuff for a made-up universe, make you read it, and then get to the end, and I’ve always been a fan of the more open-ended stories.
“C’mere,” He repeated. He retracted his arm back inside the cell and waited for a second. A few seconds later Sam appeared, and Gabe’s heart jumped to his throat.
Cas sighed happily, leaning back with his hands on his hips to admire his handiwork. He felt Dean come up behind him, the human’s arms wrapping around his waist as he examined Castiel’s work.

Although Dean hadn’t told him, Sam could tell he had approached Alastair about the problem, but it hadn’t changed a thing, other than the busted lip and two broken ribs Dean gained in confronting the beta.
“I’m so sorry. God, Sammy, I’m so so sorry.” Sam awakes to the sound of his brother's broken voice and trembling hands clasping one of his.
“Yeah… Sam’s not really like other alphas. I dunno, he’s just not super proud and narcissistic. And kinda has a self-deprecating humor. He’s honestly okay, I like him.”
Sure, life was hard, and sure, Gabe missed a lot of things about home, but as his brother grew up into a strong, independent omega, he never regretted it. If he hadn’t done what he had, there was no guarantee that Castiel would even still be alive, let alone his own person with a sharp mind and quick wit.
God, he’s an idiot.
“O-okay.” Dean nodded.
. Got it?!” The two stared at him blankly, and Gabe nodded. “Good.” Then he ran off, a handgun in either hand.
“It is quite delicious,” Castiel observed, looking up from the chocolatey liquid that swirled around in his coffee cup. “I can understand why Gabriel enjoys it so much. Dean looked up as well and snorted at the sight of his boyfriend, reaching his hand forward and wiping the hot cocoa mustache from his upper lip. Cas wrinkled his nose but allowed it, taking another sip of his cocoa when Dean pulled back. “Where are the others, again?” He asked, biting his lip. It had been early in the morning when the others that lived in the bunker had left, and he was still quite disoriented by the newfound need to sleep.
“Alastair said that Lucifer was interested in alpha slaves,” Sam said softly, sniffing and shoving his hair back, where his bangs had begun to fall into his eyes. “He said I’d be going to the Company’s main headquarters on Wednesday, which is in--”
“You hurt him in any way, shape, or form and I rip your junk off and feed it to a goat.”
So as they sat in the dark, musty cell of the warehouse, Kevin Tran sleeping in the cell next to them, and Gabriel said ‘nothing is wrong,’ that is a damn lie. And Castiel is going to find out what is wrong, even if it kills him.
“I’m glad,” he murmured, voice muffled. Cas smiled and turned around, leaning his head onto Dean’s chest.
“I apologize,” Castiel whispered to Dean, who had nuzzled his head against the ex-angels shoulder and wrapped his socked feet against Cas’ legs. “I didn’t know it would take that long.”

“It’s goddamn epic, that’s what it is.”
“Well, you are mentally and physically attracted to my brother, and I figured—” he never got to finish though because he was interrupted by his husband, who placed a warm hand on his shoulder.
“Probably. You?” Dean nodded, then paused.
” he had shrugged, face stoic from on his bed, where he was tying his shoes. “
So this is a bit late, terrible sorry about that. Anyways, this is just a filler, and so’s the next chapter, but trust me, things get... interesting, soon.
And that’s exactly how Cas knows something
Castiel had asked what was wrong, and he had said the exact same thing.

He checked the clock and sighed with relief. Only ten minutes left in his shift. Becky Rosen, a tiny omega that's head barely reached his shoulder, tapped him on the back.
“I agree wholeheartedly that Gabriel and Sam need to bone each other,” he began, interrupted by Cas’ soft warning of ‘Claire.’ Dean looked back at his daughter, who was staring out the Impala’s window, clearly not paying attention to a word her parents were saying.
There’s no specific update time or date for this, but it will be done in no more than two weeks, I promise.
, that Gabriel just fell to his knees, breath caught in his throat. The guard could clearly smell it too but was probably used to it. What she probably wasn’t used to, however, were the two holes that were riddled into her neck not even a minute later. The alpha thudded to the floor, dead, and from his place on the floor, Gabe heard his brothers yell.
It was only after Sam had disappeared from view that the smell of the alpha became prominent in Gabe’s mind again, and he swore to himself softly when he remembered why he had called the man over in the first place. Sam had smelled upset, right.
In fact, he didn’t realize that the seraph had started talking until Cas snapped his fingers in front of his face, looking concerned. “--Dean? Are you okay? You look--” Dean shook his head and surged forward, pressing his cold lips to Cas’ chapped ones surprising the angel.
“Hi?” He whispered back. “Why, uh, why am I over here?” Oh, shit, why WAS he over here? Gabe knew that he had called the alpha over to him for a reason, but couldn’t remember for the life of him what it was.

“Sometimes… sometimes I forget to breathe.” He whispered hoarsely, cracking his eyes open to look at the righteous man. “And then… sometimes I-I can’t.” Dean nodded, worry alight in his bright green eyes.
“Nothing, it’s nothing stupid joke, please don’t finish that sentence,” Dean interrupted quickly. Cas still looked confused, but he obliged, dipping his slim paintbrush into the jar of dirty water on his nightstand before coating the brush in the bright blue paint from his palette, which was perched precariously on Dean's chest.
“Nothing,”. Gabriel interrupted, shaking his head. “I just… I’ve been trying to—“
“Now c’mon, we’re gonna be late.” And with that, Dean started pulling the omegas out into the hall.
“But Dean-o, you have no IDEA what I was planning to do to your dear old Mom.”
Once they reached the training room door, Dean came to a stop and cleared his throat, shuffling his feet a bit before plowing ahead again, opening the door and storming through to meet Casey, the trainer waiting for them. She nodded bluntly at Dean and took Cas by the arm, yanking him to her sharply. He repressed the urge to growl.
Because there’s absolutely no way someone as beautiful, and smart, and as sassy as the omega in front of him is interested in the broken, repulsive alpha he is.
After about two more seconds of being lost in the omegas golden eyes, Sam was jolted back to the present by a sharp kick to the face. He jerked back, dully noticing that his nose was bleeding.
“You’re tired because you stayed up until 5 in the morning wrapping presents, moron.” He teased, slinging an arm across the righteous man’s chest. Dean frowned down at him.
“Laugh it up, you know why. Bobby wants me and Benny to come in early today, help him with a particularly beat-up car. I’ll be back around six, love you three.” And with that, he was out the door, Cas snorting and rolling his eyes, turning to his daughter.
. We’ll find some other way.”

“Uhm, I think I have to go?” The alpha looked behind him, and when he looked back, Gabe could see the fear reflecting in his eyes. “I’m Sam.” Gabriel nodded, sticking his arm back out through the bars for Sam to shake.
“I think we should watch a hallmark movie,” He remarked, and Dean nearly choked. He turned to the ex-angel, who was chewing his lower lip thoughtfully, azure eyes slightly cloudy.
Kevin came back an hour later. Snarling at the guard that man-handled him back into his cell and snapping his teeth, the omega struggled to get out of the alphas' grip.
Dean nodded and the room was silent, both of them already half-asleep. “Hey, Cas?” He spoke up after a minute, biting his lip.
“Well, never fear, I’m here,” He joked and Sam smiled, staring down at him, biting his lip.
“That sounds awesome.”
“The Novak brothers!” The greasy beta cheered. “I’ve been waiting for you.”
“Ah, Gabriel, just the son I wanted to see,” Chuck beamed up at him from his desk, gesturing at the squishy chair that sat opposite of it. “Please, take a seat, my son. We have much to discuss.” Well, Gabe wasn’t expecting that.
He’s trying his best to draw air into his lungs, but it seems that he just…
“Kids!” Cas hissed, getting more and more annoyed. “Shush!” Dean laughed, but promptly shut up when Cas gave him an evil look. Both kids huffed but turned back to their places, just in time for the usher to begin speaking.

The one thing that could make naps even better, however?
Gabe let out a soft laugh, lips red and slightly swollen, as he responded to the sheriff. “We’ll be right there Jody, sorry,” He said, and the only sound was an exasperated sigh and the sound of fading footsteps. The omega turned back to Sam, smiling at him cockily as he straightened his tie, the alpha staring down at him with an awestruck look on his face. “We’ll have to have a rain check,” Gabe murmured to him, pressing a soft kiss to the blushing alphas cheek before stepping back, making his way out of the bathroom.
Cas beamed at his human, sticking out his pinky to Dean, who raised an eyebrow. “What?” He defended. “Jack taught me.” Dean rolled his eyes but hooked his angels pinky with his own, shaking them a couple of times before kissing Cas’ hand and dropping it.
Benny had never elaborated his past, and Dean never pried. He knew what it was like to want to keep secrets, and he sure as hell wouldn’t want to be pushed into having to tell his own sob story.
As much as he would like to his blissfully ignorant thoughts of everything around him
But anyway, that is the end of the Seas of Struggle! I have a couple of ideas for sequels and one-shots, maybe a sequel with Kevin, or more on Benny or other supporting characters? But if any of you have suggestions, I’d be more than happy to hear them!
“Who, Dean?” Kevin asked drily. “He doesn’t have a choice. Got him and his brother captured a few years ago, the idiot.”
“Wait ten minutes then go after Gabe?” He suggested. Dean nodded.
After that less-than-pleasant encounter, Dean walked quickly around Sam’s many places that he hung out, mostly the smallest and darkest corners of the warehouse, where he could pretend to clean and nobody would notice he wasn’t actually working.
“I like this tradition,” He said, smiling softly up at the righteous man, who grinned back at him.
First chapter is up! Feel free to tell me what you think, next chapter will be here on Wednesday!
Dean smiled and huffed out a breath of laughter, leaning back in his chair to sling his arm over Cas’ shoulders and kiss the Seraph’s cheek. “We could be professional cookie-decorators,” He said, sounding amused. Gabe grinned as he scooped icing off his shirt and stuck it in his mouth.

Dean had met Benny Lafitte three years after they had been in the Company, and he was the only alpha (other than Sam) that he actually could stand.
just escape from an armed prison, technically.” He gave him a half-hearted smile, which Dean returned. “It’s not your fault.” He said. Dean faltered.
This is one of the types of series that I don’t really take seriously, and am mostly doing for myself because I enjoy these types of AU’s.
“Now now, don’t worry, I won’t do anything of the sort to you, a two in one omega pack? Nah, you’re WAY too expensive for that. And the money I gave your father for you two?” Alastair whistled. “Small countries have lesser riches.” He splayed his hands out.
It had… been uncomfortable, to say the least.
. His fuming was cut off though when Dean stopped in front of the training room door. This time, instead of Dean coming in, the trainer girl, Casey, came out into the hall.
“Actually, I think it’s cool. I mean, what kind of badass learns stuff about the most badass insect?” Cas grinned up at him, bright blue eyes sparkling.
“Not really, but what’re you gonna do?” He sighed, glancing at Dean, who in question shrugged, eyes sharp with concern.
And without further ado, he pushed open the doors to the courtroom.
“Papa! Papa! Sully and I want cookies!” Castiel smiled, turning around from the sink where he was scrubbing dishes, wiping his hands on his jeans and bending down to his daughter's level.
“Yeah?”
But Sam hadn’t said anything about Dean's story, and had simply taped Dean's ribs and done his best to stop the bleeding on his lip. That had been not even four hours after Sam had told him about the deal, and as far as he knew, Deans hadn't planned anything else. Which makes Sam worry even more.
It was at this moment that Sam walked into the shop, hunching his shoulders awkwardly as he half-smiled at Gabriel.
“You say something nice every day, baby,” He told his angel, smiling. “And besides, you’re better. Gabe does all sorts of cheesy stuff, and Sammy loves that. But you, my Castiel,” Dean pressed a kiss to Cas’ radish red cheek, “You are the sweetest angel turned human ever, and you’re amazing.”
“Better, I think. With what’s been happening and then… that, I’m surprised Sam isn’t making him stay home 24/7 to get healthy again.” Dean snorts.
“I do not like him.”
When Castiel was little, and still living in Shurley manor with Gabriel as well as their absent father and Michael, he had honestly thought it wasn’t that bad. It wasn’t until
Gabriel stood back up, grinning at his brother and brother in law as he crossed behind the counter, reaching down and coming back up with a large chocolate chip cookie. He handed it dramatically to Claire, who cheered and took it, running off to sit against the counter to eat her cookie, chatting happily to nothing, Cas had to presume she was holding a conversation with Sully.
When he was an angel, this wouldn’t have been a startling revelation at all, but he is human now. And humans need to breathe.
It’s fluffy though, so enjoy!
“You can get going early if you want,” She told him. “I’ll cover you and besides, I don’t really think anyone will mind if you skip out like, two seconds early.” Cas smiled at her.
After he found it, Sam would spend as many hours as he could just staring out the window. It filled Dean with more guilt than usual every time he saw Sam by that window. It proved that he had gotten his little brother captured, and that it was his fault that Sammy would probably never actually go outside of his free will ever again.
Viola!
“No kidding.” He paused, thinking. “You gonna help them?” Cas shrugged.
The Companys, Gabe had noticed, primary way of getting omegas to do what they wanted was to target their direct biology. There’s an injured omega? Another omega would do anything in their power to make the miserable one feel better, including lying down and surrendering. A couple of days ago Castiel had warned him that they would target the scent glands in your arm to get you to do what they wanted, and that was possibly the worst pain that Gabriel had ever felt. But he pushed training out of his mind.
The worst part of it all was the fact that he couldn’t do anything to help. Cas couldn’t go against alphas, since they use their pheromones in fights to incapacitate omegas, and he couldn’t be incapacitated without Gabriel finding out.
“I’m sure they’re fine,” Gabe interrupted, pushing the thought Cas presented out of his head. “Anyways, you have a gun for me?” Dean blinked, and Gabriel scowled, putting on his best ‘I’m waiting’ face.
Sam sagged against the wall. “I don’t know.” They sat in silence again until Dean checked his Company issued watch. 3:30, he’d better get going.
“I’m not a big fan of alphas, and that’s probably a part of it.” Kevin hesitated. “He’s the one that brought you down here, carrying you and holding Gabe over his shoulder. Argued with the other guard that he could do it himself, I heard him.” Kevin paused again.
(See the end of the chapter for
And it was at this moment that Sam realized that he is possibly the biggest dumbass ever to walk upon the planet earth.
Dean waited for more, but Cas avoided his eyes and didn’t continue.
“Sorry,” Castiel said. He dropped his wings back toward the ground.
“I might end up falling asleep on you,” Cas said through another yawn. “It’s a shame you’re not here to explain things, then you could just kick me when I start to doze off.”
Cas’ eyes are wide.
"You have freckles," Cas blurted.
It’s simply, even calmly, stated.
This time when Cas offers him the knife, Dean takes it.
"Thank you, Dean," Cas repeats, but he doesn't stop there. "I'm happy to be an honorary Winchester."
“Delicious,” he says. “Even better than the chocolate with bacon from the previous week.”
His mind is a constant loop of Dean leaving that night with Michael shining behind his eyes. And Castiel had let him go, had barely protested, because in the end it was Dean’s choice.
"Positive," Cas says.
He felt Charlie shift next to him, likely fighting the urge to turn.
“I’m just saying, it might be nice. Whoever you get paired up with… you’ll both be teachers so that’s already something in common. Could be fun.”
“I don’t think I should leave-”
"I never noticed. Your camera is very low quality."
He expected to see Cas’ face fill the screen, but his camera was already directed at the stove.
“I know how to use a knife, Dean,” Cas grumbled.
He glares at her halfheartedly, but Billie just laughs.
Cas furrows his brow. "I don't understand."
Cas sighed. “What else would they be?”
They stumbled their way back through the door, neither of them willing to let go of the other.
Dean stepped closer to take them anyway. “Thanks.”
Castiel was happy. He was at peace with his confession, content with his choice.
He nearly crashes into Cas as he rounds the corner to the library.
There was no doubt that Dean was going to have to endure some teasing from Charlie for spending the night downstairs in the diner, but he couldn’t help but be worried. It wasn’t very often that they ran across unknown wolves. His pack was familiar with every other pack in the Midwest, a combination of friendship and necessity, and newly turned wolves were rare enough that Dean would have remembered hearing about one.
Cas grinned and it knocked the breath out of Dean to see it. To see Cas, real and in front of him and without any screens between them.
Dean seared his sirloin tip and sent the same photo to Donna. He didn’t expect to hear back anytime soon since she was driving cross state to have dinner with her parents and extended family. He had no doubt that she’d find time to respond eventually, once the Hanscum family drama began and she was looking for an escape.
“I’m sorry I made you think you couldn’t have this,” Dean said, ghosting his lips over Cas’ jaw.
Cas turned to look up at him. "Do you think we'll get new penpal assignments in January?"
There was a good turn out for the Fourth of July that year. The weather was perfect for grilling burgers and enjoying an ice cold beer or four.
Instead, he evades. “Yes, it is loud. Are you okay?”
For a moment, Dean left his hand there and breathed deeply. Cas was
Dean drove Sam to the airport a week before his classes started. He snapped a photo of the terminal he’d just watched Sam walk through and sent it to Cas.
He nearly jumped out of his seat when his phone vibrated in his clenched fist.
“Yes, the two cloves the recipe called for.”
“No,” he said too quickly.
"Go on, Cas. You've more than earned a spot there."
She’s not the only one who does.
Castiel followed him to the counter and Dean gestured for him to grab a stool and have a seat. And then he started an extra strong pot of coffee.
“I will definitely try one,” Castiel says, “and also a large coffee, please. Black, with sugar.”
“Yeah, c'mon, I- wait, twelve years? You mean…” He stared at Cas with wide eyes, before suddenly capturing his mouth in a fierce kiss.
“Why don’t you just concentrate on calming down and changing back so we can talk. You hungry?”
Dean grinned. "It's not the only thing I imagined." His eyes fell to Cas' mouth and tracked the movement of his tongue when it darted out to wet his lips.
Satisfied, he hit send and turned back to his friend and his sandwich.
"Got anything over there?" Dean asks, and then sighs when Cas shakes his head. It's the first either of them has spoken for the better part of an hour. The tension in the room is nearly enough to suffocate Dean.
, he thinks. He starts by focusing on his hand. He closes it into a fist... but this is not his hand. This isn’t real.
Sam would need to know. As their pack leader it was going to be Sam’s problem if one of theirs accidentally turned a human… or if another pack was moving into their territory. And Sam’s problems were Dean’s problems.
Castiel swipes to answer the call. “Hello Dean.”
Dean felt a little ridiculous just standing there by himself in front of the twenty-five foot pine that was decorated far past gaudy. He very carefully did not check the time. Cas said he would be there, and Dean trusted him to keep his word.
"I'm gonna make something for lunch. Want anything?"
He cleared his throat and put a little space between them. “I think you’ve got it. I’ll… get the pan.”
"I want you to have my name because I love you," Dean says, and he closes his eyes against the consequences of his words. Who knows what fresh hell he's unleashed.
“Are these really your wings?”
Castiel closes his eyes against the ocean spray.
They stand in silence for a while, taking in the beautiful field around them.
Something of Dean’s rage must have caught his attention, because suddenly the scene around him disappears and he’s left in the dark.
Nope, this is the only turkey I made this year. It’s taco Thursday, but I’m not complaining. Hey, as long as the turkey tastes alright you did fine.
“Okay, good.” This, Dean could do. He knew cars like he knew the alphabet, there wasn’t any reason to be nervous. He kept up a steady stream of instructions, listening for each of Cas’ quiet acknowledgements as they went along.
Dean leaned forward and pulled at the rain soaked coat, checking the pockets. “I hope not.”
Dean dropped onto the bed and pulled Cas with him. Cas grunted, his eyes closed tight.
After he finished setting out the craft for their letter of the week, “L”, he went to his desk to indulge in some inspiration of his own and listened to Led Zeppelin while he checked his email.
Dean turned it toward him. “The school is giving us all a New Year’s resolution whether we wanted one or not.”
, he added for good measure.
"Dinner really was good," Cas echoed. "I never knew Brussels sprouts could taste like that."
He began the long process of cleaning up. The kids had helped with the worst of it, just like they always did when they sang their clean up song together, but they’d only had so much time left at the end of the day and there was still so much to do.
Charlie came back down the stairs and said, “Sam says Eileen won’t let him drive out in this weather because it can wait till morning.”
“I’ve enjoyed all the doughnuts I’ve had here,” Castiel says because his filter shattered the moment Dean walked through the door.
Cas stared at him with wide eyes when Dean reached out to cup his face, holding him as softly as he knew how.
“I don’t understand,” Cas said. “Why did they think it was a good idea to hide upstairs instead of simply leaving the house?”
“Alright,” Dean said, tucking the phone between his ear and shoulder so he could flip his grilled cheese without it completely falling apart. “You’re gonna add two more cloves and half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. You got those?”
“Eileen!” Sam called out, energetically signing a greeting on his way over to meet her.
I really hate this place.
The beep sounded again and Dean looked around for his phone. He found it under the coffee table, and by some miracle it was still clinging to fifteen percent battery life.
They broke apart to catch their breath and Dean was struck by the grin on Cas’ face. He was certain he’d never seen him smile like that. Then Cas’ eyes darted down to his lips and he pushed forward into Dean’s until Dean’s back hit the wall. He was entirely surrounded by Cas when his wings fell forward to cocoon the both of them, so Dean moved his hands to Cas’ face. He considered the scratch of stubble on his fingers and decided he liked it, and would probably like it even more against other parts of his body. His neck, for sure. Rubbed against his thigh? Oh,
