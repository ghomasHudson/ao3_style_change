“More than anything. Though I do have a certain fondness for being back in the city, not getting shot at.” His finished off his sandwich, and leaned back in his chair. He could hear the ominous rumble of thunder in the distance, and prepared himself for a difficult walk home. Which reminded him, “Am I finished for the day, then? Or do you still need an assistant for the evening?”
“Teacher? Ha! No, he lacks the discipline for that, I’d say. This was over at my first uni, King’s College. In fact, once in a blue moon he was also at the London Fertility Center, where I interned. He’s known all over London’s medical district, always doing the odd experiment and causing trouble.”
Mycroft was the first to break the silence. “Sneaking out of the facility, Sherlock? Really? I would have thought you to be smarter than that.”
It is a simple fact, not an opinion nor any sort of half-arsed claim, that Sherlock Holmes is a passionate man that feels things in a potent, all-encompassing way.
He’s not a strong soul when he’s faced with ‘please’, no matter the person, so he takes a deep breath, steels himself, and begins. He’s a natural storyteller, truth be told, so it’s not very difficult to fall into the clown chase, the patience grenade, the piratical thieving of a fishing boat, even to the shutter island rip-off that was Sherrinford.
“Overall a successful morning,” John says, having bought a cloth bag currently bulging with all of his purchases. He’s delightfully content, stomach full but not yet bursting at the seams. It’s one of those simple moments, so warm and comfortable that John has to make more of an effort
Weeks roll by, all alike in their monotony. The only difference that stands between them all is that instead of the violin, during sleepless nights the soothing sound of the acoustic guitar drifts up the stairs, gentle and fluid like a river. Sherlock never sings.
“Complications are hardly so simple for one to comprehend, and you are no exception.” There was a sense of superiority in Sherlock’s tone, making him further grate on John’s nerves. Sherlock’s former aggression was waning, and his face was pinched in a taught wire of tension that lined his bones. He turned his glare to Mike for a moment, as if cursing him for bringing John into his sanctuary. “Has he been properly scared, then? Am I finished?”
They had been roommates third and fourth year of basics in college, both studying medical. Mike was better at naming off the different kinds of bone fractures, while John could sever a leg and have it sewed up and wrapped before the next student was finished with cutting through the bone. It was no wonder Mike went into teaching, though it surprised him that he chose Bart’s instead of an actual university.
The falter is all Sherlock needs to come in for the kill, bracing his hands on his armrests and leaning forward in an oddly predatorial move. “Why. Is. It. Important?” he enunciates. He’s nearly smiling, but there’s no humor in it. He’s sharply reminiscent of the man John had first met at Bart’s. “You seem to have an obsession with my private life, emphasizing on sexuality, where you’re constantly skirting around the issue with passive aggression and thinly-veiled jealousy. Jealousy for what? Glad you asked, because I have absolutely no idea, seeing as you’ve spent every waking moment assuring the world that ‘John Watson is
John made his hasty retreat, not even bothering to grab his clothes. Sherlock cleaned himself up to the best of his abilities and just sat on the edge of his bed, unable to place his own emotions. He was somewhere between joy and sadness, as well as at a place far off of the scale.
“Do you really need to do this? This isn’t just... an experiment that you want to do, but something that you have to do?”
kind that is, they can’t take certain medications without trouble of a relapse. I'm sure in France there's a whole lab for him, to make sure he doesn't have any problems... it's probably all cold and lonely. Poor Sherlock, let’s see, when he gets back I’ll make him a…”
John was beginning to stare, and Sherlock cocked his head in curiosity. He quickly averted his eyes, just in time for Lestrade’s voice to sound from the center of the facility.
Then John’s hand was gripping his hardening erection inside of his pants, and any upper hand he hoped he had had suddenly collapsed. “Thrilled,” John growled, his other hand reaching up to thread into Sherlock’s hair and
“That would be fantastic, Sarah, thank you.” Sherlock grabbed his overcoat from the lab table, shrugging it on in one flamboyant twirl. He tossed John his. When John caught it, taken aback, he was worried to find Sherlock’s black eyes sparkling. “Care to see a crime scene?”
Sherlock nodded slowly, still uneasy. “Yes. It seems as though my brother has a sick sense of humor.”
Sherlock shook his head, but didn’t reply. Rolling his shoulders, he called the computer back and hovered his finger over the manual ‘resume’. He watched John expectantly. “Will you help me?”
Sherlock’s eyes immediately zeroed in on the grip, seemingly affronted, so John dropped his hand. They had already stopped in the hallway, after all. Shaking his head slightly, John lifted his eyes to meet the taller man’s gaze.
Sherlock flipped them around and pressed John into the sand with his lips, the rain pelting at his back and sound of his brother’s footsteps shuffling closer. It didn’t matter. None of it mattered. Because in the darkness, there was a glint of silver and an
“Sherlock has spoken of me? My, this is worse than I thought.” He continued on before John could respond. “As of now, my brother is tearing himself to pieces trying to find you. You left in quite the haste, you know, door wide open and cane forgotten. Looks an awful lot like an abduction, you see.”
Mycroft tightened his lips, studying him with a barely-there narrow of his eyes. Whatever he saw in Sherlock didn’t seem to be good. “I’m trying to tell you that John Watson will forgive you, given time,” he said quietly, voice turned down from its nasally usual into his more natural voice. It was achingly familiar. “Imagine if your doctor killed himself in front of you two years ago, and how you would be coping now. If you would still be alive, at least.”
She shook her head. “Something about suicide,” she said, but didn’t seem convinced. “There’s been a few suicides in the news, recently, and it seems rather cut-and-dry. But I’m no detective.” She shrugged and gave a small, if polite smile. “He wants you there as soon as possible. If you’d like, I could-”
They stared at each other for a few moments, both with a quirk to their brow, before John acquiesced with a sigh. “We are back Sunday night at the latest.”
So, where would Sherlock go from here? Desperately awaiting for the next moment John got drunk enough to forget his standards? Probably. It was awful and depressing and frankly appalling, but it was the truth. He didn’t have the restraint to refuse John, and he didn’t have the courage to confess these revelations to him.
Her smile was frenzied, if not bright. “Just trying to keep busy. I hate having days off, and the captain refuses to give me any share of the workload. I’m afraid to ask the first officer, myself.”
“Excuse me!” He shouted, causing people to disperse in surprise. “Coming through, pardon me! Who’s the primary engineer on duty?”
John follows the direction clumsily, the strings twanging when he hits them wrong, but it doesn’t bother them any. It’s strange, hearing the notes change without warning, but Sherlock’s staying with his horrid rhythm just fine, his chord changes smooth and clean. His knee brushes John’s, keeping the semblance of time, and he worms his arm back to his side.
“Sherlock,” he managed. Strong arms wrapped underneath his armpits, but he couldn’t kick with enough power to help the man drag him up.
“He loved her,” Sherlock hoarsed. “He chose her and married her and vowed to spend his life with her. And she’s evil, she’s...
“I’m the doctor,” John reminded him, standing up with the glass vial in hand. It was still freezing, but the lack of moving air at least kept his skin from numbing. “Would you like me to help you with that?”
John chuckled. “He’s really not that bad, once you…” He really didn’t know where he was going with the statement.
John nearly refused to save face, but this was the most permission he’d ever have to touch a damned interesting medical phenomenon, an
“Because,” John continues, “if it is, you should know that I don’t, um, blame you anymore. I never should have. You don’t have to,” he gestures to the kitchen, even though Sherlock doesn’t see it, “accommodate me. Or anything.”
He was suddenly still, and the moors were alit with the morning sun. Mary stood in front of him, hands gripping his arms and eyes wide with terror. She was hot as an iron, a searing pressure against his skin as she shook him.
In the car, John turned on the radio to something droning and aimless, already drowsy from a full stomach and the back end of an adrenaline rush. He was absolutely beat, both body and mind. He was just closing his eyes when Sherlock spoke.
John fell forward, bracing his hands on Sherlock’s shoulder, and his face twisted into something terribly vulnerable. “Sh-Sher-”
“I have a car, actually, in a car park just ten minutes from here. It’s been gathering up dust lately. What do you say to airing it out?”
“He’ll be there in 15 minutes,” John says, batting Sherlock’s hands away when he tries to grab back the phone. “Yeah, alright, Greg. Yes. I- no, I’m on babysitting duty. Right. Thanks, he’ll see you soon.” He hangs up and tosses the phone to the other man’s chest. “I’m fine, Sherlock. I don’t need to go on
Sherlock crossed his arms, nearly hitting himself in the face with the spatula. “No, John, but I was
Long fingers straightened at the bedclothes, and his voice had an unfamiliar edge to it. “My full name is William Sherlock Scott Holmes, you see. While we’re there… Introduce me as William Scott.”
“Still not going to the banquet, then?” Sarah asked, readying her own patient’s arm for the needle. She was the secretary, to be fair, so John was surprised to hear that she had an actual nursing degree. He shook his head, waving over the next person in line and unpacking a new syringe.
John wrapped his still-wet fingers around Sherlock’s cock, slicking it as much as he could. Sherlock made to rearrange them but John shook his head, already climbing back into his lap. “Like this, yeah?”
John licked his lips free of sweat. He was never the first to resort to begging, but his sense of self-preservation far outweighed his pride. “Look, whatever he’s paying you, I’ll pay double. It’ll take some time, but-“
ME: Both the cloning and robotics programs have been equally advancing. With the top minds of the world working on the latter, you can have a body in as soon as five years. At this rate, even sooner. It'll be a rudimentary body, of course, but a vessel for you nonetheless. We need to bump you up the list so we'll be right after Mycroft.
It wasn’t the first time. With a shrug, John grabbed his duffle and took the regular stationary sidewalk, which was mostly empty of crowds. The climate was warmer than yesterday but pleasant, and higher in the arc there was a screen with the local news playing. The sound from the broadcast wasn’t intelligible unless he focused on it, anyway, so he wasn’t bothered. He seemed to have some familiar company on the path, though.
“I don’t,” John said quickly, lifting his head to trail his eyes instead around the dining hall. He wanted to milk this, just a bit. “You know, when someone’s training partner is missing, that someone gets paired up instead with the captain. Who does not ‘go easy’, in any sense of the word.” Every part of his body was throbbing, and while he was used to aches and pains at this point, he wasn’t accustomed to the ringing in his ear from Lestrade’s bellowing voice in close proximity.
Their lips brushed barely, the electric spike of contact, and John inhaled sharply through his nose and tangled his hands in Sherlock’s shirt to pull him closer.
Though when Sherlock came back the next day, eyes silver and a smile on his face, it was harder for John to drop the thought. Luckily, he was (apparently) hard to read.
“Is your friend alright?” The shopkeeper asks, an older man with hair down to his waist. John almost replies, but he instead presses his lips together in a tight semblance of a smile, nodding a vague assurance, and turns back to the matter at hand. He’s not sure what he should do. At the very least, he plucks his daughter from Sherlock’s arms in case the mental absence is a hint towards something worse, Rosie none the wiser.
They took the stairwell rather than the lifts, down and down into the belly of the ship. John realized it wasn’t as quiet as he had previously thought, voices and heavy machinery echoing the lower they got. “Where are we going?”
He turned his head again, and they narrowly missed a curb. His teeth were perfect and blindingly white in a crooked grin. “Because you like the way I look in them.”
ME: Baskerville has already launched this AI program to several different facilities around the globe. If we shift our focus towards specialized robotics, we can have machines find the best solution at double the time.
John leaned down, feeling a sick sort of thrill at looming over the man. His hands steadied on those broad shoulders. “If you’re not human,” John said, “Then what can you be?”
Eventually, Sherlock found an inn that seemed much too grandiose for a casual two-night stay. Also well out of John’s price range, if he paid half. Sherlock, for all of his whining over being unable to read John easily, seemed to hear the unspoken question directly from its source.
Legends upon legends of vampirism around the world sprung up, alphabetized but too numerous to scan through manually. John took advantage of the search bar.
The pale hand was just descending, hydrogen peroxide-soaked cotton ball ready, before John lightly grabbed his wrist to stop it. “Really,” he said, “It’s fine if you need me to do this part. I know that blood isn’t your…”
John huffed out what he supposed was a laugh, but he didn’t think he had curled his lips into a proper smile.
“I don’t, you know,” she finally says, eyes drawn to her feet. “Love him. Not anymore, not after this. I used to, I think, but I. Well, that is to say, he and I… he never, and I was being…”  She’s getting worked up, a flush creeping up her neck.
Sherlock was staring at him with his mouth slightly agape. He shook his head in bafflement, a scoff on his lips, before turning back to the road. Anger wasn’t rippling off of him in waves anymore, so John ventured: “Better?”
John felt some of the harsh lines seep from his shoulders at the beautiful sound. He was still cautious, but Sherlock had a way of calming him down as much as he could rile him up. “Oh? What ever were you going to ask, then?”
It all seemed to happen at once. As Sherlock reached further over the bed, and as John began to sit up, their heads knocked together and noses pressed uncomfortably. Their lips didn’t even touch, Sherlock realized when he thought back on it. But at that moment, before John could flop back down and before Sherlock could apologize, the air just…
It was difficult holding a conversation, especially while John was too busy marveling at the fact that he could climb stairs without a limp. The stairs were curved, winding, and if he still had a stiff leg it would be torture. “Never a dull moment,” John settled on.
Sherlock fell into his chair, arms wrapping around his knees, and tried to control his breathing. When that didn’t work, he let himself be felt and cried until exhaustion plucked him from the Earth like a piece from a chessboard.
Sherlock jerked his head in Molly’s direction. “She is the only one out of the lower crew with access outside of the dome. I need to get her to give me that access, but even she wouldn’t be that stupid.
rings through his head, and he realizes with a jolt that it wasn’t a metaphorical statement. Sherlock knew from
John sighs, but he’s already scooping up Rosie and stuffing his feet into his shoes in one move, just barely managing not to topple them both over. “Mrs. Hudson!” He calls, making sure he has his keys and hiking Rosie up further his side. In his other hand, he’s tapping out a reply.
There was a car door shutting outside. Wind moaned ominously through the house, creaking the foundation. With another lasting squeeze, John made to pull away.
Sherlock texted their whereabouts to Lestrade, and gestured at the dumpster. John closed his mouth and shifted into military stance, hand reaching behind his back to the gun in his waistband. As always, Sherlock felt a rush of something pleasurable along his spine at the sight, but he pushed it away as best as he could. He reached for the lid.
Falling into the couch, he cleared his mind as well as he could. But, even on the edge of sleep, he couldn’t shake the flash of fangs and wicked red eyes.
Dear lord, he even spoke as if he were from another time. John swallowed, mouth dry, and tentatively stepped further into the room. Mike, unperturbed at his side, let the double doors shut behind him.
“Then keep doing what you’re doing,” Sherlock managed between his teeth, head knocking back into the wall. John huffed humidly against his neck, and he released Sherlock’s hair to yank down his own trousers.
A beat, and then his brother. “Your Dr. Watson is one of the strongest men I’ve ever known,” Mycroft said softly, tender and horridly familiar from childhood. When he placed his hand over Sherlock’s, placating, Sherlock couldn’t help gripping it back and pressing it against his temple, tears stinging his eyes. “If there’s anyone who can dismantle Moriarty’s chain once and for all, it’s him.”
His only has one room, no doors, and a window that opens up to the roaming moors where his grandparents had lived. Inside, the living room of 221B is as much of a clone to its real-life counterpart as John could ever manage. It’s not perfect, but he’s not using it for the storage of tobacco ash and/or various melting points, so it fulfills its purpose just fine.
After both Sherlock and John managed to exit the cab without injuring themselves (though John had hit his shin somehow on the curb and Sherlock was rubbing at his funny bone), both men stared up at the neon-bright building they were standing before.
Sherlock ignored most of what he said, rocking back into his seat. “Can’t have a ‘Stag Night’ without a ‘Buck’, can you?” He mused, more to himself than anything.
Sherlock nodded towards the door, as if to say ‘follow my lead’. Dear lord, the man was a drama queen. With a barely-constrained sigh, John followed his lead.
“She’s not a people person,” John said carefully. At the look on Sherlock’s face, he quickly continued. “No, no, not like you – you may not like people, but you’re at least semi-neutral about it. Most of the time. Harry… she lives off of anger. Makes people disappointed in her in the beginning, so expectations can’t go anywhere but up. I’ve learned to live with it and, well, twin connection I guess. It’s just… I don’t need to give her anymore fuel for the fire.”
John wonders if he’s always been this way. If Sherlock’s been this sensitive this whole time, where an errant compliment or a word from Rosie could push him to tears, if the moment gives. If his emotions have always been so plainly written across his face, and if John has just been so unbelievably unobservant about noticing them.
not to be dangerous. To live off of artificial blood, to find joys in science and detective work, to stay away from humans before they find me out, before they..." He waved a hand in John's direction. "... learn too much. But you. You're... different. I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing, yet."
Lestrade’s face turned an alarming shade of red, eyes nearly bulging out of their sockets, but before he could fire back, a voice interrupted.
“Yes,” John said without a glance. Turning his chair, he tapped the surface in front of him pointedly. “Sit.”
It went fine, he had to admit. He wasn’t exactly a skillful fighter, especially with a see-through opponent, but he could feel himself working up a renewed sweat at the workout. The rhythmic movements, dodge here and strike there, all like a formula bent on being followed. It could even be fun, when John sort of got the hang of it.
muscle memory," John muttered absently, then starting in surprise that he knew the words. Mycroft gave an off-putting smile at John’s dismay.
“Patience, John,” the hunter sang, voice smooth as honey. The baser of John’s instincts told him to run, even when the rest of his body urged him to yield. It wasn’t his fault; the damn monster was built precisely to lure him in.
“Wasn’t waiting,” John protested half-heartedly, before he realized it wasn’t the truth. Shaking his head to clear out the webs, John sat up in his chair. “What time is it?”
Those slender fingers were far from relaxed, as if Sherlock would pull them away at any moment, but he held still. “I wish they wouldn’t come back, then.”
be beautiful, if not for the frenzy he was caught in, keeping his eyes straight ahead in single-minded focus. He felt terrified. He felt exhilarated. He felt
“I suppose things didn’t go exactly the way you predicted?” Mycroft asked, perched in the armchair (John’s chair) when Sherlock arrived at 221B. His greeting to Mrs. Hudson went better than he planned, even if she had screamed and promptly fainted. However, he didn’t have the patience to talk to another living soul at the moment.
close to responding to the ‘cheating spouse’ cases that litter his email. A distraction is needed. Badly.
Sherlock cocked his head with a frown. “I never would’ve guessed that.” He seemed bothered by the thought.
Instead of pulling him closer, John’s face twisted and he pushed him back, hand knotted in the fabric as he manhandled Sherlock against the front door. He didn’t kiss him, only left him there while he took a step back and started to undress.
He sucked in a hiss through his teeth, cradling the phone between neck and shoulder as he perused the menu. “No can do, busy.”
After John hung up and figured that fiddling with the TV for twenty minutes wasn’t worth it, he decided to take a stroll.
“To what?” He asked innocently. Because he was an idiot, apparently, and he was hoping that ignorance would scare her off. Obviously, he was wrong.
John tried to shrug, but it was more like a barely-there nudge of his shoulder. “Yeah, can’t seem to shake ‘em.” The Sherlock dreams had faded whenever tensions eased between them, and instead had been replaced by the death-filled snippets of Afghanistan. It was better to stay awake than experience
supposed to know?” John demands with a fling of his hands, gesturing vaguely in Sherlock’s direction. “You… The first time we met, you told me that women aren’t your area. But then, after that, you saved Irene doing god knows what else, you spent
“Headroom,” she breathes. And then she huffs out something resembling a laugh, until she’s outright smiling. John’s never seen her this excited, and wouldn’t have dreamed of her lighting up like the sun after seeing her meekly open the front door earlier, when he and Rosie had first arrived.
At the cafeteria, John ran into Sarah, and the two ended up finding a small table to sit at with their lunch. While John saw her as only a friend, he had a feeling that she saw him as something more.
“Um, yes, alright,” he said hurriedly. He swallowed, eyes darting around the cabin and out the window, catching sight of a Tesco. “We’re out of milk,” he settled on.
“I like to read,” he said, picking at the leg hems of his training uniform. “Even the classified stuff. It’s easy to get, and I like to read it. I… read something weird.”
ME: Don’t listen to me. It’s essential towards your learning that you determine the validity of the definitions towards your own psychological matters.
On the nights when John can’t quite keep his eyes closed, the even breathing of his daughter across the room doing nothing to soothe him to sleep, he instead draws himself into his own meager mind palace that Sherlock knows nothing about.
After that… nothing. To John, the thought was somewhat unnerving. He messaged Sherlock while he brushed his teeth.
Sherlock let out a groan, cutting it off at the end in a choke with John did something devilish with his tongue. There was the tear of foil, and John’s fingers were slick and probing at his entrance. Sherlock widened his stance automatically.
As if realizing that himself, Sherlock’s face fell the barest amount and he shook his head as if to clear it. “Right. Have a good sleep, then.”
As it turns out, two weeks later, that’s exactly what happens, over dinner with Sherlock’s voice stuttering and cheeks aflame. John’s hiding such a tremendous grin, he nearly forgets to say, emphatically,
“Just…” John huffed out a breath, pushing himself off the armchair. Something in his knees clicked as he stood. “I can’t just… I’d have to get my affairs in order, to start.”
s under his breath, but kisses his daughter’s cheek in farewell and barely refrains from doing the same to the man holding her. “Off with me, then.”
Sherlock groaned loudly at that, rolling his eyes to the heavens as if John was there to personally torment him. “Oh,
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, as if he could read John’s thoughts, but turned out it was for a different reason. “What was the name of your village, again?”
John rolls his eyes, but Sherlock doesn’t even spare him a glance, already bouncing in his shoes like it’s Christmas. “Sherlock-”
Thomas, single father of two girls, used to have shaggy blond hair. Now, he was sheriff for Stansex. Darcy had always been the funniest of the group, and now she was recently engaged and unemployed, her fiance a realtor. Ronald ‘Ronnie’ was the ginger boy that cried whenever he lost a game, who became a pediatrician and father to nine (!). Gillian was one of the teachers at Stansex for the primary grades, the class size this year up to a whopping sixty-three. And last was Mary, John’s first best friend (and crush), who had grown up helping her mother run the bed and breakfast.
A particular Moment that stands out, for example, involves the Outing That Need Not Be Mentioned (John has a habit of emphasizing the landmarks in his own mind palace with Capital Letters). Or, to the layman, John’s stag night. More specifically, the last thirty minutes of it.
Sherlock’s always been this way. He’s just been so impossibly scared of showing it all. Of showing it to a world that’s done nothing but condemn him for his differences, of showing it to a flatmate that’s done the same.
Watson,” he said. “I am an ex-army doctor invalidated from Afghanistan, though I am reliably informed that I bring that up too often. I am attracted to adrenaline in the most unhealthiest of ways, I mother-hen too much especially if it’s in matters related to your health, and I’m quite distractedly in love with my best friend. Oh, and I also played the clarinet in primary school. How do you do?”
Sherlock didn’t want to be staring at a man who had suffered so much that he had withdrawn into himself, afraid of what would happen if he showed his demons the the world.
John closed the fridge with his back, leaning into it. He shut his eyes for a bit longer than a blink. “Yeah. Fine.”
“A severed finger, sir,” the overseer commented, though going by her expression she doubted the accusation.
Sherlock’s playing louder, more confidently, and he’s really in his element, John thinks. Not the center of attention, though the bloody git wouldn’t mind that either, but playing the music right now, he’s responsible for the joy of the people he cares about most. His eyes are closed, and his fingers play the most complicated of melodies as if by heart and not from an 80’s pop song, turning it into something beautiful and organic and so utterly
“Always grateful of the support,” Sherlock mumbles sardonically, but he holds out an imperial hand in Sally’s direction anyway. It reminds John of the way he used to be, full of ridiculously lazy demands, requesting his laptop from where it would sit beside him like the effort of reaching over was too ambitious to attempt. Surprisingly, Sally allows it, carefully picking up the guitar by the neck and body and walking it over with a gentleness John would’ve been surprised at, if he hadn’t seen the way she was holding his daughter earlier. It takes no time at all for the requests to start flooding in.
They ended up at a quaint sandwich shop, not too far from the hospital. Understandably from the weather, the place was nearly empty. After ordering, they took a table near the back and waited for their food.
The scrubbing gets louder, and a fork clacks in the sink with too much force. “I don’t ‘tip-toe’, and I’m certainly not—”
The Sherlock way of saying ‘please go on, I secretly want to hear more but asking for it wouldn't match my aloof facade’. John didn’t know if he’d ever get used to this seemingly detached man being so interested in his life, and he wasn’t going to start now.
Still unsure, John sucked in air through his teeth. “Okay,” he said simply. “Okay. Yes. So, how am I supposed to cover you?”
It was the landlord. Lestrade thanks them distractedly, promising John a pub trip soon and Sherlock a nice, juicy murder for his help. It’s nearly midnight when they leave.
She laughed. “Speaking of mum, she would love to see you! You absolutely have to meet us at the inn for lunch, after you pay your respects.”
Footsteps thunder up the stairs, and John jerks his hand back to his side as if from an open flame. When Sherlock comes in, slightly winded, he takes one look and quirks his lips. “Would you like to play it?”
There was a collective groan amongst the group. John shifted in place, uncomfortable in the tight workout clothing he was given, identical to the one hundreds of others in the facility were wearing. The captain continued on.
“Excellent observation, John, truly a riveting sight to behold.” He flipped to the next page, eyes only flickering up to John’s face to narrow and then return to the book. His irises were getting darker by the day, John noticed, and his mood directly followed the trend.
“It’s the coolest part of the night, just before sunrise. We won’t be out for long.” Sherlock held open the door for John and paused, glancing down at him thoughtfully. “How do you feel about deep-sea digging, by the way?”
Sherlock seemed to become less rabid, and while his body still thrummed with the potential energy of a cheetah ready for the chase, he had enough mind to look apologetic. “Sorry about Lestrade.”
Sherlock was just down the hall, hand on the doorknob to one of the classrooms, and from what John could see he was shaking with quiet laughter. Instead of breaking the silence between them, it only irritated John. Who was
The boy gained eloquence as he spoke, seeming less young with the sureness of his words. “It’s how the real one travels,” he explained. “It doesn’t go fast, it makes the gap smaller. Instead of going five meters away, it makes the space in front of it less. It makes its path move for it.”
Before John could start up with an interrogation of his own, considering that he personally felt like he was entitled to know about the man that tried to kill him, Lestrade stopped them both on the landing with a hand centimeters from John’s chest.
He loved John with an aching passion, a fire that had reached its maximum and refused to extinguish. He loved him like mankind needed water, an all-encompassing thing that was without question and was determined in the very fiber of his being. He wanted him in every sense of the word, in every definition of ‘want’ and ‘lust’ and ‘love’. Sherlock was collectively the most selfish and unselfish man in the world when it came to John Watson. He would kill himself if it meant John could be safe, and he would writhe and tangle with him even though John was a happily taken man.
“If you’re insinuating something, I can assure you, while it’s none of your business, Sherlock is not my boyfriend.”
“You have my word,” Sherlock said gravely, hand over his heart in pronounced sincerity. He then quirked his head. “Ellie, is it?”
“Sorry for my shock earlier, I’ve never seen Sherlock willingly have another human being in his presence before. He’s not what you’d call a people-person.”
That seemed to throw Sherlock off, but he recovered quickly enough, lips pursing as he resumed the session. John couldn’t help but wince when the chip powered back on, brain splitting back into distinct, overwhelming parts. Sherlock, though, seemed to attempt another route.
Sherlock finishes the rest of his drink and then closes his eyes and hums for a long moment, as if he’s savoring the too-sweetness on his tongue. His eyes, when they open, are fuzzy and soft and as clumsy as his feet are, right now.
feel comfortable with was ignoring him. Cheeks blazing, he excused himself to the bathroom. He might just leave; it was ten minutes until seven, when he shift ended. He had already cleaned up, anyway. Determined and feeling like a dick, he slid out of the room and into the empty hallway, taking in a gulp of air. Anxiety was clawing at his chest, and he had no idea why.
apologize for your ignorant conclusions in my direction, though. Of course I don’t regret saving your life. You’ll find that I feel quite the opposite in every scenario, when it comes to keeping you alive.”
“John Watson? Hello,” came a female voice from the other line. Ice wrapped its fingers around his spine when he realized that he was being followed. How the
But when he gets to the conversation right before the phone call, with Sherlock’s deductions towards the coffin, something gives. “He said that the coffin belonged to someone unmarried, living on their own, practical, used to death, all that. Someone rather short, I think it was 5’4”, maybe? And then a few inches, accounting for headroom.” He rolls his eyes. “Sherlock thought it was unnecessary, the git. Having headroom. He’s not wrong, as we both know that the dead don’t quibble about a tight fit, but still. After that, he...”
Sherlock gave a mirroring snort, sliding off John’s socks with his shoes. The other man was fumbling with his belt, fingers heavy and uncoordinated. Sherlock made sure his sigh was loud and withering.
Dropping a hand on each of his grandparents’ headstones as he walked, John slowly but surely made his way to the main path, Sherlock at his side.
Apparently not. John felt himself, sadly, more put off by the fact that he was being asked by a man than being asked for the third time that day in general. He stares at his flatmate’s ass on occasion, and suddenly there was a giant flashing
John thought, and nodded carefully. “Alright. Erm. Let’s say… that there’s this tall bloke named Scott, and a shorter one named Hamish.”
Footsteps approaching. “John,” he said, gripping John’s hand in both of his with smooth, kneading rolls. He was trembling, unable to stop. “There’s... there’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you. For quite some time.”
Winces at his knees, so he has to shift until he’s fully seated on the floor. Sherlock’s back rises and falls steadily, and after everything, that’s what strikes John the most. That Sherlock’s back rises and falls. It doesn’t feel real, with the events of the last several years, that he’s still able to do that. John’s hand moves on its own accord.
Sherlock wasn’t breathing evenly, only through his mouth and in quick, jolting gasps. They were narrow enough to avoid notice, but John was becoming skilled in Sherlockian subtleties.
The urge frightens him. John quickly chucks the fabric across the room as if burned, as far away from him as he can get it. Satisfied and more than a little uneasy, he picks Rosie up from her highchair to go get her dressed.
The moors were very flammable. Shaking his head from those thoughts, the only thing he could do was meet Sherlock’s eyes equally. He tried to fill his stare with conviction. He was making it as clear as he could that this was a subject that he was willing to let go for now, but not forever. “Okay,” he said slowly.
“I’ve said my share for the night,” he said as he pulled into the road, voice carefully nonchalant. “Now it’s your turn.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” she says, cradling Rosie in her arms, “But I believe it’s quite past Miss Rosamund’s bedtime. John, would you like me to...?”
by Oscar Wilde was forced upon him in his mandatory theater class along with the role of ‘Jack Worthing’, but he had loved it beyond words. In another life, perhaps, he’d have been an actor.
“It’s for your own good,” Lestrade had sighed, leading them through the ship while they wore fully-insulated suits to keep them from contaminating the air. He didn’t seem angry this time, only more resigned. Like he had expected this. “The air outside of the dome and inside the Intrepid were never supposed to make contact. A simple cleansing won’t be enough, we’ll have to put you in quarantine a couple of hours during launch so you can get a full disinfection.”
He began pacing, absentminded strolling by the window. “Oh, yeah, I travelled here with my flatmate.” That by itself sounded weird, so he tried to elaborate. “He’s… well, he’s a close friend of mine, so we made the trip.”
She tilted her head to the side so that John was in her periphery. “He came to my flat last night, as drunk as I’ve ever seen him. He… he told me about the five times.”
“Hello, John. Ta for the coffee. How’s the shoulder by the way? It’s going to rain soon, I know that’s when it gives you trouble.” Her words were rapid as she accepted the latte, so unlike her usual demeanor. While her figure was calm, he could practically feel the energy thrumming around her.
outing Sherlock had planned. He played with his hands on top of the table, feeling a tad awkward. “Oh, we’re still doing that?”
happened. That would be impossible. Well, so would vampirism, so maybe John should forget about what he knew at the moment.
She leaned in closer, maneuvering around her large belly to tilt to the side until she fully faced Sherlock. Her eyes were unreadable, but her mouth wasn’t pursed and she didn’t try to straighten up to Sherlock’s sitting height. Nothing bad warranting her to attempt dominance, then. Sherlock let out an unperceivable breath.
“John,” Sherlock said again, stepping directly in front of him to stop him from sliding off the table. “John, don’t. Not, um, yet.”
The man was a juxtaposition. John felt inexplicably familiar with him, their personalities complimenting each other well despite their brief introduction, but Sherlock was an enigma enough that John never knew precisely how he should be feeling. He pursed his lips, but otherwise let it go. "Alright, yes. First off, it's called 'hyper-rail' for a reason. The train reaches tremendous speeds, we'd be lucky if the only thing it did was make us lose our grip."
That look was familiar. Achingly familiar. Ever since that first time, nearly a year ago, something had awoken beneath Sherlock’s skin that was difficult to ignore. He felt it come and go in low intensities, a rush through his blood whenever John handled his gun or cooked them dinner, the juxtaposition between both facets of the man utterly riveting. At least once a month, he would feel compelled to take ‘matters into his own hands’, as it were. Once a week, he would find himself lingering on John’s physicality for a moment too long, when before he didn’t notice the way that his forearms flexed, or how his jaw clenched, or how his arse looked in his favorite pair of third-date jeans.
“If we survive it,” Sherlock repeated slowly, amused. He seemed to always be amused at John. “Do you trust me so little?”
“That was…” Sherlock started, and then stopped. He shook his head with a frown. “Good. It was good.”
John winced, brows crossed in thought. He reached his spare hand back into the drawer and tossed Sherlock a condom packet. “No need,” he managed. “I’m nearly finished.”
so delusional into believing in the existence of vampires, John could ponder over the past twenty-four hours without bias.
Sherlock snorts. “I hardly have to deduce you anymore,” he says. “I know you too well. I can tell, at the very least, that you’ve certainly bought nothing for yourself. You would never go to a shopping area with a wallet full without purchasing something for me and Rosie. Obviously. In fact, I’d venture to say that there’s even something for Mrs. Hudson in that bag.”
eat, once every few days, he started it off popping an iron pill and succeeding in an average of half the plate. John has been pushing for every other day, and while Sherlock hasn’t yet acquiesced, the wall was getting thinner and thinner from John’s determination.
“Yeah? I find that hard to believe. My mum calls me her open book, and I can never seem to get things past my sister.”
“Sorry, sorry,” John managed, both hands occupied with bags as he bustled into the living room. He unloaded onto the counter, rolling his left shoulder from the previous strain and striding over to Mary to drop a kiss onto her cheek. He clapped Sherlock’s shoulder as way of greeting. The touch lingered. “The line at the Thai place was awful. Were you both waiting for long?”
“You don’t eat,” John had stated during the second week, having set a plate of ravioli in front of the man and promptly having been ignored. The anatomy book Sherlock was reading that looked to be in… Japanese was too interesting, it seemed.
“Yeah,” Mike said from somewhere beside him, voice seemingly far away. “That’s always the first reaction, following the first time you see him. Is he real? Am I dreaming? Who is he?”
John hissed impatiently, using his grip to both tug their hips flush against each other and yank Sherlock’s head back to nibble at his neck. Sherlock winced, but he was
The door opened, and footsteps thumped on the wooden floor in a percussive concert. Timpani, bass. Mycroft’s umbrella was the snare. John dropped his hands reluctantly, trailing them down his neck before turning to face the front, hand resting on his shoulder. Grounding. Sherlock closed his eyes to no difference.
Sherlock obviously wants to refuse, any number of excuses seeming to run through his head, but he only bites his lip and brushes past towards the window. He hesitates slightly before picking up the guitar and rounding around to his chair. John follows. When they’re both settled, Sherlock’s hands hover over the instrument, like he’s never touched one before and has no idea what he’s supposed to do. “I’m… out of practice,” he says awkwardly.
If AIs could blush, RJ’s face would be crimson right now. Without a word he ran towards the hovering craft and jumped up to grab it, powering it off so it sat stagnant in his hands. He sat back down on the ground, and John cautiously followed suit.
She paused, and then laughed hesitantly. “It’s… well, it’s just a scary story, you know? Something to scare the kids from staying out late.”
When he could, this Sherlock could definitely use his looks to his advantage. The woman at the desk was certainly not scared of him, cheeks flushed at the attention. She seemed to keep her wits about her, though, and her fingers were measured on her keyboard.
didn’t want that to happen. “You have to understand, Sherlock, I’ve known that you were otherworldly for some time now. Whether you’re a… vampire or an alien or a particularly tall type of goblin, it’s not much of a shock. Or I’m just currently repressing it all. It’s only that I’m… a bit curious.”
Sherlock nodded, and crouched down so he could be more level with the man. “You’re a doctor,” he commented. “Is this position comfortable enough for the human body to sustain overnight?”
John’s never had an inclination for the classics, but he’d always moderately enjoyed them in school, things like Shakespeare’s
Right. Before John can hurriedly change the subject, Sherlock slides the arm that’s pressed between them up and over the body of the guitar, so that his hand is ghosting over the strings beside John’s. “I’ll show you one.”
In the morning, John descended the stairs to the smell of a delicious breakfast, the oily scent of bacon intermingling with eggs alongside fresh coffee. John hoped this wouldn’t be a daily occurrence, as he could definitely get used to it.
It’s too much, hearing it out loud. Knowing is different than acknowledging, and speaking makes it solidify into something tangible, something heavy. When a concept takes shape in the world, it can’t be ignored anymore no matter how hard you try. John meets his eyes and it feels like a challenge.
He opens his mouth, closes it, and clenches the fist in his lap. Sherlock relaxes everything but the line between his brows and leans his head against his headrest, sliding his gaze out towards the front windshield, as if he can read the thoughts swarming between them like they were on a page. John sighs and closes his eyes.
The Intersectorial Center for Astronomical Means was truly a sight to behold, once John had the mindset to behold it himself. Glimmering stacks of buildings surrounded the inside perimeter of the dome, of every material and shape but all consistent in their modernity. Darting between buildings and crossing over each other were the walkways, lines of powered conveyor belts that transported people from point A to point B in a matter of minutes. The sun was visible through the dome, though since the glass was so heavily protective most of the light came from illumination beneath the walkway and from glittering streetlamps stuck in organised patterns throughout the massive, city-like facility.
It’s immediately apparent that this trip is more for Sherlock than it is for John and Rosie. While the beginning stalls are quite boring, lines of gaudy jewelry here and shiny tin tea sets there, the hidden treasures are what Sherlock enjoys sleuthing for the most.
“Alright,” he said. Trying to keep clinical, he raised his hand and swept his fingertips down the marble contours of the taller man’s neck to the hollow of his throat. Then blinked. Prodded at the junction between his neck and shoulder, now entirely clinical. Frowned. With one hand, he pressed firmly into the skin below his ear, the other trailing down to hold his wrist. Sherlock huffed a breath at his ear, his lips parted, and John’s eyes were level
John mutters a thanks, and wars between knocking on the bedroom door and helping clean up in the kitchen. Does Sherlock want to be alone? That question never has a consistent answer. Is he actually drunk? Stag nights and graduated cylinders fly around his head, like a cartoon depicting a daydream, and he shakes them away. In the end, Mrs. Hudson decides for him.
John looked up at the sun from where it was buried beneath the clouds, scoffing under his breath. “Oh, the standard. Short, blonde, pretty, runs a bed-and-breakfast over in the moors.” He grinned when he looked down and saw the barely-schooled frown on his friend’s face. “Why are you asking? Are you jealous?”
He didn’t see himself regularly wanting that despite how often he complained, but it was good to know.
He was beginning to talk more, and John felt triumphant. He leaned further forward. “What is your name?”
“Boss said he’d be near the crypts,” came a gruff voice, far enough away that the words were faint but close enough to hear the slight footfalls beneath it.
Lestrade laughed at John’s unease, which was very effective in making it disappear. The captain was charismatic, John would give him that. Lestrade clapped him on his shoulder (thankfully the right). “The past few days were mostly informational meetings, all of which I’m sure Mycroft will inform you about before the day is up. Considering that you’ve gotten your breath back, you are already ahead of the few simple exercises we’ve done. In case you were worried.”
good fellow.” Sherlock took the rose easily, not having to worry about pricking his skin. “Unique enough to catch our attention, yet simple enough to pass over others. A flower at a gravesite is common, and it’s easy to confuse a fallen rose as a romantic gesture. If this
“I’m not one for declarations of love,” John says. “You make fun of me being a ‘romantic’ or of poems you’re convinced I write for every which girlfriend, but truth is, I’m bloody terrified. I get angry too easily, I hold grudges, I’m illogical, half the time I can’t even explain why I’m upset, but you…” John huffs out a laugh. “Years ago, if somebody asked me if you were capable of love, I wouldn’t have known how to answer. Now, I
John’s face broke just a bit, and it was beautiful. It was a glimpse of the John that felt fierce things and wasn’t afraid to show it. “A mistake,” he repeated, jaw tensing and untensing. “Right.”
“Hi, John,” she greets, smile not quite reaching her eyes. Rosie leans out of John’s arms towards her, and John motions for Molly to take her. She does, gently. “I wasn’t expecting you to visit. Not that I… it’s, um. A pleasure. If I knew, I would have…”
Rosie’s successful with one shoe, so John takes the hint and slides them both off. He stretches, feeling his spine pleasantly crack and tight muscles loosen, and he runs a hand through his hair to try and push it back into place, to no avail. He’s debating on getting it cut back into his usual style. He starts towards his laptop, intent on checking his email, but Sherlock clears his throat before he can.
In a normal world, a detective-inspector wouldn’t be apologetic about the lack of murder going on in Greater London. As it is, Sherlock’s vibrating with excitement and only urges him to continue.
Molly nodded quickly, unbothered by the turn of events. Her eyes kept flickering over his shoulder. “Of course, that’s fine. Tell him I said hi!”
Sherlock didn’t come down from wherever he was all at once, instead in intervals. Barely-there glances, which soon became longer and longer until John felt trapped again, this time in a tumultuous gaze not unlike the crashing ocean waves out deep in the Pacific. Sherlock was shaking very, very minutely, almost as if the frigidity of his own skin had frostbitten him. The man he was choking dropped to the ground. “John,” he breathed.
John looks down. Sherlock’s mouth knocks against his forehead, his hairline. His hand drops to curl around John’s neck. Outside, there’s the distant, foreboding sound of thunder.
“Sherlock, you’re the one who spreads those rumors yourself. You curse the radio whenever it’s playing.”
John imagines Sherlock cutting a sharp line with a violin perched on his shoulder, the music guiding him into something both charming and oddly alien, passionate and powerful and unspoken in its elegance. John would’ve never imagined him over something as casual and as warm as a guitar, and he’s not even sure he could conjure up an accurate picture in his mind if he tried. “You don’t seem the type,” he says carefully.
The words Sherlock shouldn’t care about, the ones that some part of him wasn’t dreading to hear. He tried to shake it off, tilting his head back down to the microscope. But, for the oddest reason, the fact that what happened last night would
At first, only the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches, like one of his barely-there lopsided smiles. He ducks his head to his feet, as if he’s going to deduce himself from the scuffs on his own shoes. John’s about to continue. But then Sherlock looks back up, and for the barest,
“Stop that!” Sherlock barked, holding John’s head in his hands to keep it still. The frigid skin acted like a cooler against John’s throbbing skull, and Sherlock’s breath washed over his face as he murmured, mesmerizing him. “I was walking with you to the store, I told you this. You were so angry, John, you must’ve paid me no mind. We crossed the street, and a car came barreling from a wrong turn, so I pushed you out of the way. You hit your head quite badly, honestly, if you’re saying these things.” Sherlock leaned in closer, and it would be intimidating if not for how much John wished to bridge the gap. His voice went softer beneath the frantic crowd. “It would be impossible for me to reach you here from the flat in just five seconds. A pure, natural impossibility. So why humor it?”
“Of course you’re my friend, Sherlock,” John assured. “Course you are. If we’re being honest, you’re probably my best friend.” Not that he had many others to call ‘friends’, either, to compare him to. Before Sherlock could stutter out something else, John shook himself back into something serious. “Tell me what your plan is.”
John sighed, though he felt his own blood awakening into something much more thrilling than casual sparring. He let some of it leak into his voice. "Damn it, Sherlock. I would have liked a bit of a heads up that I might fall to my death today."
“Your leg,” he said simply, voice low in comparison to Mary’s bright one. “You’re walking without a limp.”
, there was a foot-thick pillar rooted to the floor. That would have to do. Taking an end of the massive rope he lugged in, he tied it expertly around the root and tugged at it with his weight to make sure it would hold. He leaned back through the door.
“It says here that the best cure for a hangover is a culmination of greasy food, caffeine, a cold shower, exercise, or even energy drinks if available. Namely water, though, of course.”
His words devolved into racking coughs, far too much dust in his lungs. “John!” He heard, both close and distant at once. He couldn’t find the energy to try and fight gravity.
But, inherently, he isn’t cruel, so he eventually cuts her off and says, “Kidding. Thank you, Sally.”
the vacuum cleaner even is. Maybe Sherlock knows. Would that be a good enough excuse to talk to him tonight?
“Just getting you a closer look,” he said innocently, something hidden and almost mischievous behind his words. He held the door open for both of them.
“Make it two,” Sherlock said, “and keep them coming.” He grinned John’s favorite crooked smile, and the waitress had to blink a few times before heading back to the kitchen on unsteady feet. John huffed under his breath.
Sherlock twitched his lips, and in unison they continued down the hallway at a much slower pace. “You have? I can’t recall that particular tidbit. I could tell your military service from your right pinky, anyway.” At John’s laughter, he let his own ring out, that same sound that belonged more to an instrument than a man. He held the laboratory door open for them both. “Come now, John, this hipbone won’t liquefy itself, will it?”
ME: My dearest brother urged me to join the program, obviously hoping that this promising piece of scientific discovery would be enough to lure me away from a relapse. An understandable but futile tactic, I’m afraid.
He groaned aloud. “Not that it’s any of your business, but we recently had a… heart-to-heart.” He winced at the sudden interest in her eyes. “No, not like that! Well, not entirely.”
“Mike,” the bundle of dark curls greeted, turned away from the pair and hunched over an experiment. His voice rang like music, a tangible chime in the words despite his deep baritone, and
“I was saddened,” she says, letting Rosie push a tiny finger into one of her tightly-coiled ringlets, “to hear about your wife. It’s… well, awful. I’m sorry for your loss.”
The words didn’t register. The virus? Exodus, universally accepted by all as the contagion that singlehandedly brought humanity down to its knees? Found as a hormone in everyone’s blood plasma, it mimicked the properties of estradiol in women and testosterone in men to gain access to the body and negate fertilization. As if something that proven didn’t exist? “What are you even talking about?” John asked incredulously.
It was the oddest, most wonderful thing. He wasn’t attracted to him like he was a woman; there were no possessive kisses, or an all-encompassing lust that he could hardly bear. No, he wanted to know James as he’d never known another person, and he would take as much as he could in return, even if it meant fantasizing about hot nights under a tent barely big enough for two, spending hours and hours filling each other up to the brim.
Sherlock almost looked affronted, head tipping back to face John incredulously. "I've done nothing disingenuous to warrant that, you know."
Between the avoidance and the almost-glares, there was only one thing for John to deduce: when Sherlock had saved John from getting run over, for whatever reason, he was finding himself regretting it.
“I’ll just assume that you’re either a doctor or used to be on the force, and not a serial killer, shall I?”
Sherlock sighed noisily and turned, sitting himself normally on the couch so he could level a glare. “Does your visit have a point other than voicing the equivalent to ‘I told you so’?”
“Oh, John,” he greeted, surprising John with his arrival. John jumped and spun around, eying Sherlock’s obviously drunken frame with wariness. Molly’s earlier words rung again inside of his head. “Always a pleasure,” Sherlock continued, words slurred.
“Right, right,” Sherlock agrees, spinning back around to the eggs. John snaps open the paper pointedly and tries to throw himself into the business section, despite having absolutely no interest in the stocks and investments flying around the globe. When Sherlock starts back up again, it’s really no surprise.
But John was already shaking his head. “It’s too far a fall,” he protested. “Remember? We’re not touching the ground at the moment, we’ve a great big hoop around us, for whatever reason. I never quite learned why.”
“I’ll come back,” John said directly to Sherlock despite being halfway out the door. In that moment, Sherlock could see him. Jaw tensed, eyes both carefully blank and utterly turbulent depending on if you saw them in the right light. Fists clenching and unclenching. Determined. Strong.
“Anthea will accompany you there,” Mycroft said, and the AI herself suddenly made an appearance at John’s side. She lightly touched his arm and nodded her head away from the entrance, face carefully blank. John refrained from flinching, and with a lasting look to Sherlock, he followed her out.
Did Sherlock’s brother order them not to make conversation, in case John could convince them away from killing him? Seemed likely. He huffed out a breath, moreso irritated than wary. “Go on then.”
“You’re still drunk,” he said, hips rolling up to make the briefest of contact. John’s mouth parted. Sherlock continued. “It’s comfort. A mistake too many, what’s one more?”
“We’re doing some light sparring today as the first exercise,” he began, strolling towards the center where people were beginning to gather for announcements. “While we obviously do not expect there to be a need for active combat skills, the practice itself can be an viable way to keep in shape and blow off steam whenever tensions rise up there. Because they
murderous. John didn’t want to meet the stare, but after he slid on the last glove, his eyes moved on their own accord.
It’s still too vague to tell. Someone from the homeless network clears her throat, her name something like ‘Melinda’ as far as John remembers, and she sings, pointedly,
John thought. John had slept in his own uniform, anyway, his a light sky blue with ‘CHIEF OF MEDICAL - WATSON’ labeled at his chest. He inclined his head in agreement. With a tight nod, Sherlock began down the hall with John alongside.
The sudden words didn’t startle John, but they nudged him into action. He pushed up with a groan and closed out of the simulation before turning around to his supposed sparring partner.
Sherlock grunted and shook his head. “Need more data,” he managed. But then he stopped and turned to John, face careful and oddly bright despite his exhaustion.
Since John’s subconscious seemed to think that he hadn’t had enough horror for the day, his sleep was filled with nightmares.
Of the fourteen Sectors, each sent in one person that would represent them on the DSE Intrepid. This person was the most knowledgeable in their field, and would be able to put this knowledge towards determining if the new planet was fit for human life in the long term. For example, if food was unable to grow in alien soil, the Agricultural Sector representative would test the factors and form a solution towards crop success. The initial competition to become the representative was rumored to have been grueling and cutthroat, and the chosen people even still have to undergo continued testing to secure the position. John, meanwhile, was simply written into this elite crew as an ‘oh, yeah, let’s throw this washed-up former med student into the mix, that’ll be fun’. He felt out of place, to say the least.
Halfway through June, the halls of St. Bartholomew’s nearly empty and blasting its air near-freezing, John stumbled into Molly.
Before, he had done what he pleased, going out all night without a word otherwise or destroying John’s jumpers or putting a milk carton of compost in the fridge and, overall, acting as though he still lived alone, though more accidentally than with purposeful displeasure. He realized that now. But ever since the pool incident, things had… shifted. He was still a selfish bastard, but John didn’t seem to mind it as much. And Sherlock had no qualms making exceptions to his nature, if it meant seeing John in a good mood. For the first time in his life, Sherlock had learned compromise.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, and his hands slowly rose to begin unbuttoning his shirt. He met John’s eyes with a tight brow. “What are you waiting for?” He bit out, words much more solid than how he felt. “It seems as though we have a checklist to follow.”
letting me know that you two took a little joyride on the hyper-rail. What were you thinking? I know damn well that John here wasn’t the ‘mastermind’ behind this.”
She tried to seem professional, John could tell. The break in her voice gave her away. “Y-yes, of course.”
“John,” Sherlock breathes, eyes alight and a touch overwhelmed for the briefest of moments. John fears he’s going to cry. But then, blinking himself back to the present, Sherlock grins. “Are those Star Wars socks? I thought you knew me better.”
John tried to placate, choosing his words carefully. “Well, no. Not to me, not if it means us having to part ways and never speak to another again.” He
John, on the other hand, was drenched. After a bit he fell against the ropes, holding up his hand to halt the other man. “Wait,” he panted.
“Fuck off,” Sherlock growled. After putting up his coat he fell into the couch, back turned stubbornly to his brother. “If you’re bored, go destroy another third world country.”
John swatted his arse half-heartedly, and their soft laughs mingled together into the sun’s dim golden haze. They slept until nightfall. And after that, well, life was just fine. All fine.
But Molly had already hurried off around the corner, gone in a moment. John watched her go thoughtfully, pursing his lips, before turning around to start his limp back down to the labs.
But when skin met contact with skin, it was as if the man came back online. The rest of his breath rushed through his lungs in an abrupt wave, eyes fluttering closed and nose scrunching, as if he smelled something bad. He shied immediately from John’s touch, stumbling back into the lab table without any of his earlier grace. John didn’t follow him, but he
Instead, he leaned forward and softly pressed his lips between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, arms winding around his middle to hold them flush. Cherished. He whispered into the skin there, “I’ve never been more obsessed with someone that I am with you, my Holmes. It’s always you.”
Sherlock Holmes underneath running water was always a sight to behold, but without clothes on it should be bloody illegal. His shoulders were broad and every inch of his body was sculpted as if drawn on paper, legs up to his chin and muscles beautifully defined. His wet curls fell charmingly against his face. John felt so unbelievably lucky to have those quicksilver eyes openly loving on him, the detective’s full attention somehow caught on John’s average form.
“Really?” Sherlock asked incredulously, though he was already moving into action and untying John’s trainers. “I’ll remember this night,” he warned without heat.
Sherlock made a low noise under his breath, oddly complacent for such a (relatively) boring outing. John, with a steadying hand on the stone, bent down to straighten the flowers and clean off the rest of the moss. He paused. “Huh.”
Well, John wasn’t wrong. For nearly all of their brief acquaintance, Sherlock had shown not even an inch of sexual interest, because there wasn’t any there to begin with. Something changed last night, a switch flipped that caused Sherlock to be utterly and irretrievably attracted to John. Now, it was quiet again, but like a volcano; he could feel it just below the surface, dangerous and unpredictable. But, at the moment, the atmosphere was as it was before this whole issue, though maybe a bit more awkward.
But Sherlock was already deep in his reading, eyes scanning the screen of his device with fervor. John wasn’t going to get an answer out of him any time too soon, so he instead went to fetch the nourishment he required, if it could be called that.
“Great!” Lestrade exclaimed, clapping John on the shoulder. “Donovan will take care of Hawthorne, but I need to tie up a few loose ends. Meet you at the usual?”
Sherlock smirked as he unfolded himself from the cab, leaving John to finish up. He spun around and leaned against the car, ducked down so he could still watch John in the back seat. “Took you long enough,” Sherlock said. “It’s been weeks since you left it in Stansex.”
“You shouldn’t be able to notice it anymore,” Sherlock said offhandedly. “It was implanted while you were still in the artificial womb.”
“Oh, er,” John muttered, pressing up against the ropes behind him. He crossed his arms across his chest. “John. It’s John-”
he said placatingly, fingers clumsy as they frantically drummed the skin for attention. “Look at me, Sherlock, right here. I’m right here.”
With a sigh, John let it go. For now. Opening his eyes, he watched Sherlock gnaw at his thumbnail, feeling himself get distracted before remembering that he had two more questions to ask. “There was a dent on the car, and paint under your nails. Did you stop the car from hitting me?”
John paused, tongue prodding at the inside of his cheek, before letting his eyes roll at the implication. “I’m not in love with Mary, if that’s what you’re getting at. She’s an old friend, never was anything more than that.”
The fingers paused, and Sherlock’s eyes did that thing that John hated, where they got all sad before carefully turning blank. “It wouldn’t just be me that gets punished,” he said mildly. He finished the bow with a precise tug, and lingered another moment to straighten it. “Besides, this shouldn’t be too terrible, I’d think. We don’t even have to make conversation with anyone other than ourselves. I’ll go up when they announce the representatives to the public, you’ll stand with a polite wave when they introduce you as COM, you’ll dance with a few people and I’ll have a drink, and then we leave when it’s appropriate.”
John seemed to sober, but resolve pushed passed the blur. He pushed forward, shaking off Sherlock’s grip and gripping his hands back on his waist. “You’re drunk too,” he accused. “This is just... It’s fun.”
“That’s…” he tried, suddenly unsure. He let John go completely, pulling away so that John had to drop his hands. “My back. It’s…”
John nodded, feeling some of her nervousness against his skin. “Yeah, yeah, I’m not in a rush. D’you know what it’s about?”
Sherlock shook his head. “He doesn’t go by a name,” he said. “He’s an AI, and at age 8 he altered his own mind to adjust his learning curve. Usually that’s frowned upon, but given the genius and skill he administered while doing it, the ICAM was itching to have him.” The boy darted his eyes back up to the pair, and then immediately back down. “He broke into system records around the same time to completely swipe his own file of information. He doesn’t talk very much, most people just call him ‘Thirteen’.”
Sherlock was gone for the day, saying that he would not return until late. To not wait up. John hadn’t responded, which was apparently good enough. He couldn’t remember.
As people began to move, John jogged to catch up with Lestrade. “Captain,” he greeted when he was close enough.
Sherlock watched him expectedly, eyes flickering to the phone. John shrugged. “Old friend, seeing if I was still coming to the village. Before the army and after my father’s death, the visits were like clockwork.”
Sherlock gave a nod, eyes searching John’s one last time, before he seemed satisfied and took a step back to a more appropriate distance. “Now that that's settled, John, there’s something I wanted to ask you. Next week, on Friday…”
Sherlock hums, and shifts impossibly closer. “It’s simple,” he says, almost like an admission. “I still prefer the violin whenever it comes to composing, but this is new. Akin to ambient noise, clearing my mind more than prompting it to think. It’s… different.”
“Wait,” John protested. “You said that it’s too dangerous to bring the stairs back. What does that mean for a person right below the ship?”
“I’ve never been the one to prattle on– that was always Harry’s job.” He felt himself smile, eyes glazing over, and he chuckled under his breath.
John cleared his throat, and Mycroft turned to him reluctantly. “Dr. Watson, a pleasure. Don’t worry about punishment, I know how persuasive my brother can be. You will need to immediately see our resident clinician, of course, to make sure you won’t be experiencing any lasting effects from your time outside.”
It’s still mostly dark outside, but the staircase is alit just enough with the blue-ish glow of morning to keep John from tumbling down. His steps are even as he descends, like a muffled metronome to the barely-there music. When he reaches the sitting room, he lingers in the doorway.
“Not fun,” John agreed eventually, pressing his thumb along the line of Sherlock’s cheekbone. “Boring. Very boring.” His lips quirked a tad. His hands dropped to Sherlock’s shoulders, and he closed his eyes as if the contact was grounding him.
“John Watson,” he greeted, holding out a hand. It was gloved, so John took it. Between their palms was a business card, complete with phone number and title. “Pleasure to meet you. My name is Mycroft Holmes, and as I’m sure my assistant has mentioned, I am the First Officer of the DSE Intrepid.”
ME: Perhaps later. I’d prefer not to go into my childhood nor the history surrounding the setting, if you don’t mind. Any more questions?
Indeed. “Why humor it?” John repeated, dazed. Sherlock nodded, obviously pleased, and he kept his hands cradling John’s head. The ambulance was closing in on Baker Street if the wail was anything to go by, and when John looked up he swore he saw more than fourteen people. Did they multiply, or did his vision?
