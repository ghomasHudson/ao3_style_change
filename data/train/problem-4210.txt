“Fight monsters,” Castiel clarifies as he moves on to the next gasket.  “As a mission, I mean.  Day in, day out.”
He gives her a smile and squeezes her hand, but it’s all he can manage in the moment.  The bunker doesn’t quite seem real around them, the surfaces intangible and the air ill-fitted to the space.  He was only here a month ago to help Cas with re-organizing the archives and nothing’s changed, not really, but for the first time in nearly fifteen years it doesn’t feel like home.
Cas can’t help but smile, reaching up to tangle his fingers with Dean’s where his left hand is hanging over his shoulder.  “Not too close,” he says.  Heaven’s not his home anymore, after all.  He tilts his jaw up and kisses Dean on the mouth, squeezing his fingers.
Jack doesn’t wait for the Empty to keep talking and instead drags Cas away.  With one of Cas’s arms looped over his shoulders, Jack half-carries him all the way to the portal.  Cas has no idea how far they’ve gone, if it’s been seconds or minutes or even hours by the time they reach the rift, but they burst through the portal and the black rolls away into light.
“I know this won’t be the same,” Sam says as Cas tucks the USB into his shirt pocket, “but I hope it helps.”
Eileen refrains from poking fun at Dean’s lack of sign language comprehension; it’s not as funny as it was yesterday.  Instead, she only raises her hands placatingly.  “Sorry,” she says, and changes the subject.  “I think we should check out Preble Street right after this, while they’re still serving breakfast.  People are going to scatter if we wait too long.”
Dean swallows the old instinct to argue against any implication of his own worth.  If anything in his life was going to make him feel worthy, surely this should be it.  “Did you always know this was going to happen?” he asks instead.
Above them, the island ridge is sinking too, arching like the great fin of a shark.  The churning waves wash over the edge of the dinghy, pulling at the oars until they’re torn from the locks.  There’s debris in the water — shredded wood and ropes and torn canvas — and bodies flail in the riptide, passing too quickly for Castiel to tell who they are.
It’s quick and nothing to lose his mind over, barely a peck.  But Cas’s face lights up with surprise and delight, and something is knocked loose in Dean’s chest at the sight of it.  He feels daring, even if he did have to check to see if there was anyone watching.  After all, Dean is trying to figure out what this means for himself, too.
“Ugh is right,” agrees the coroner.  “This was all that was in the bag from Spring Point.  And he was a tall fella, so he’d have been put in multiple bags.”
Gagnon makes a face, setting the detached forearm back onto the steel.  “Guy’s in pieces; it’d be weird if he wasn’t drained.  That’s not the interesting part.”  He moves his hands to the severed head, rolling it onto its side.  “
Cas looks over at him, his hands in his lap and confusion on his face.  “Is… is that what you want to discuss?”
“I’ve been trying to fix it for hours,” Cas says, and suddenly Sam doesn’t care at all what time it is.
Cas coughs out a breath, the air tearing out of his lungs with sharp edges.  He barely manages a nod.  The longer Dean is stuck there, the worse it is.
.  Had it been Dean pulled into the Empty, he knows Cas would tear through whole dimensions to get Dean back.  Billie is gone, which means that Death isn’t coming after them.  And God is already after them, so what’s one more cosmic battle added to the pile?
Instantly, Dean’s posture changes.  Still tense, still rigid, but now on guard with his eyes scanning the trees.  Castiel draws the knife from his belt as they climb over a ridge and the ground evens out, the vegetation growing just sparsely enough here to almost be a clearing.  He can’t smell anything, but that’s what Frank is here for, he supposes.
They’ll come back, he knows.  Soon, even.  They’ll be back to pack up more of Cas’s things, or maybe to bring Dean here and let him have the opportunity to say goodbye in his own way.  Sam knows the bunker won’t be empty forever
Dean and Castiel exchange a look, then burst into laughter.  “I swear, I never know what to say to kids,” Dean chuckles as they turn toward the harbor.
Halfway down the hall to Cas’s room, Dean stops short and backtracks to his own bedroom.  They’d gone to Cas’s because it was further away from the TV room and there was less of a chance of being heard, and Dean’s only just realized that Cas’s room doesn’t have everything they need.  It’s not like they require a lot of bells and whistles, but there is one thing, and Dean rummages through his bedside table to find it.  He tucks the small bottle of lube into his robe pocket, his heart skipping in his chest as it fully sinks in that he really is about to do this.
“We don’t want you to be alone,” Eileen adds, her index finger turned upward and pressed to her heart.  But Cas won’t hear it.
“Sorry,” Dean says, and Castiel frowns, because if there’s anybody who should apologize, it’s not Dean.  “My father can be… an acquired taste.”
Dean does insist on finishing his eggs and coffee, but once he’s done and Cas has changed into some more appropriate clothing, they head for the door.  Sam is unsurprisingly sitting at the library table with a book, searching for anything that might help defend them against Chuck.  He looks up when Dean and Cas walk through.
The reality of Cas’s death is starting to sink in, and Dean finds himself at the table in the library with no memory of walking there.  Sam must have dragged him there, out of the dungeon where Cas disappeared – died – was
that’s supposed to make it work.  Jack closes his eyes, looking for a moment as though he’s praying, and then he lights the bowl himself.
Castiel looks down at the greasy pie in his palm, then back at the angry giant stomping in his direction.  He swears loudly and runs after Dean.
Cas nods, almost to himself.  “They deserve every happiness,” he says in agreement, squeezing Dean’s fingers.  “Which begs the question, why don’t you think
practically dances.  Castiel is able to feel the moves she’ll make before she makes them, allowing him to balance almost entirely hands-free.
The douen abruptly materializes out of the shadows, dropping from its hiding place above, and sinks its teeth into the back of Dean’s neck.  Dean shouts in pain and the douen’s limbs cinch around his torso as it latches onto him like a tarantula.
If Cas is uncomfortable in the slightest at the prospect of Sam witnessing this, he doesn’t let on.  Instead, he only says, “Yeah, Dean’s been wanting to show me this movie for ages.”
“It’s a monster,” Dean agrees.  “And as far as I know, the largest creature on Earth.  We’ve been hunting it for months.”
Dean lets out a long breath, trying to stave off the ache in his chest, and looks back up at the sky.  “I guess not.”
Dean always had a way of seeing right through Sam’s bullcrap.  Sam sighs, then leans his elbows on the table.  “Okay, fine.  I saw the job application.”
to.  The only times he’s ever seen Sam spend all day in his room, foregoing exercise and healthy meals, have all been under an oppressive blanket of depression and guilt.  He’s never seen Sam lounge around all day watching movie after movie, subsisting mainly on popcorn and pizza just for fun.  It’s a welcome change, and further proof that Eileen is good for Sam in more ways than one.
They have the ingredients in a burn-proof bowl this time, on the end of the library table, and this time Jack won’t have to eat them.  Which is kind of a pity, because this particular concoction seems much more edible.  Yarrow root, dried blackberry leaves, pure unprocessed honey, sprigs of greenbriar and sage and rosemary, and just a few grams of ground peyote.
“I guess I’m just curious as to how a soldier becomes a pirate.  Or a hunter.  Whatever he calls himself.”  Castiel ties up another buntline, securing the canvas in expert folds beneath the gasket.  “How about you?”
Jack moves to defend Cas, but in less than an instant the Empty swings its arm up and slices into Cas’s neck.  Blood sprays, and Cas doesn’t even have time to gasp.
Shower-damp and wrapped again in the robe, Dean makes his way to the kitchen after and sets the coffee pot brewing, as he promised.
“Keep it,” Dean insists, then shrugs.  “At least until Tortuga.  You never know; we might run into more trouble.”
Cas rises from the steps to hug Sam as well, and tells Sam to bring Eileen back with him as soon as she gets here.
Dean coughs and rubs his fist on his chest in an apology before he repeats the question more clearly.
Dean thuds back down the steps and bumps against Eileen’s hip to get her attention.  “Mom, can I have a juice box?” he asks, deftly switching to ASL.
Cas doesn’t respond directly, nor does he look away.  He shrugs one shoulder and asks, “Does it make you uncomfortable?”
“So it’s just you and me, then,” Cas says, propping an elbow on the tabletop to rest his chin in his palm.  He gazes at Dean from where he sits, unwavering.
They both end up dozing, however, slouching with their heads resting on their arms on the library table.  It’s not deep or restful, but it does help.
Dean shoves Jean-Luc at Frank with a quick “Take him!” then, with no time for discussion, runs into the blackness after her.
The fight is a close call – very close.  By the end of it, Eileen has a big cut on her cheek and bleeding scratches down her arm, while Cas is nursing a laceration on his shoulder.  Both of them are out of breath and absolutely filthy, covered in dirt, gravel, and werewolf body fluids.
They arrive at the meadow just before sunset, when the summer light is fading into gold.  Donna’s truck is there, and Claire’s Fox Body Mustang, and even from a distance they can see two blonde heads working to collect firewood.  When Eileen pulls the van to a stop beside the truck, Donna and Claire pause their work to greet them.
“No,” the Empty seethes through clicking teeth.  “I’ve decided.  I want nothing to do with you ever again.  I already have Death and
And suddenly, Castiel can smell it too.  An awful stench of sickly sweet decay wafting out of the den and settling over the forest floor like mist.
Triumph surges in Cas’s ribs, white-hot and fierce, like he’s suddenly sprouted wings again.  A smile bursts out of him as he slams on the brakes, the Impala’s tires squealing as the other car streaks past with a final blare of its horn.
Castiel throws himself onto his stomach and crawls on his elbows through the tunnel as fast as he possibly can.  “Frank!” he shouts once Jean-Luc is clear of the entrance.  “Frank!  Burn the den!  Burn it!”
I do want to take a moment to point out that HIPAA laws do, in fact, protect the privacy of deceased people, and that Dean doesn't know what he's talking about.
Castiel isn’t sure what he was expecting Dean to say to that, but he sure as hell wasn’t expecting him to flinch like he’d been burned, shoulders tightening.
They end up driving for a little longer than Dean planned.  Nowhere seems like the right place for the conversation they’re about to have, and Dean wonders how much of that is just him stalling.  He doesn’t know
White light spills into the Impala’s cabin as the headlights draw closer, then flash once, twice, three times in a frantic warning.  More honking.
“First rule of hunting,” Dean replies bitterly.  “You can’t save everyone.  If that kid is still alive, it’ll be a miracle, so I’ll hold off on getting my hopes up.”
Dean swallows, his lungs hitching on his next inhale.  Leave it to Cas to strike at the heart of the issue.  Fucking bull’s eye.
Reassured, at least somewhat, Castiel finds the strength to straighten and remove his hand from the railing.  His breathing slows, though his fist still shakes.  His wounded shoulder is stinging.  “Um.  Two, I think.”
Sam circles back, setting the beer on the counter by his elbow.  “So, Bobby’s here?  Charlie?  Jody?”
At this point, it’s past noon and Dean and Eileen are already hungry again.  The four of them return to Monument Square and sit on the granite steps below the statue of Nike, eating sandwiches from a small deli that faces the square.  Again, Sam orders nothing besides a black coffee, which makes unease tug at the pit of Eileen’s stomach.
“I don’t understand,” says Castiel.  He was pulled down, lost to the ocean.  He remembers that.  The screams of his crewmates echo in his ears, Ishim’s vanishing face lurking behind his eyelids.
Cas draws back for just a moment.  He swallows, his chest shuddering almost imperceptibly.  “Are you—?”
“All right,” Dean says with a grin, taking a long gulp from his flask.  “Who’s ready to roll a few vamp heads?”
At last, he’s able to sit up without hitting his head on something, though the space is still claustrophobic.  He can hear Dean squeezing through the tunnel after him, and clumsily shuffles out of the way.  There’s a crunch and a clatter underneath him as he moves, a pile of objects shifting.  It’s a jagged surface he kneels on, like the packed dirt floor is halfway mixed with gravel.
“Ugh,” he says as he stacks the plates and tucks a few bottles under his arm.  (It does not escape his notice, however, that only four empty bottles is quite the drop from Dean’s usual level of alcohol consumption.)
“It wasn’t an island,” Dean says solemnly, popping an orange segment into his mouth.  “The creature, the island…”  He shrugs.  “Same thing.”
At long last, when they’re high enough to be able to see the entire harbor, Dean stops in front of a ramshackle house that sags on its timber frame.  Far below, the cove gleams in the sun and the surrounding mountains drop sharply into the water, effectively shielding the town from the worst of the ocean wind.  From this distance, the harbor doesn’t seem quite so busy, and even the largest of schooners look small at their moorings.
“Jack!” Sam shouts.  He and Dean grab Jack before he can fall to the ground, but they can do nothing except hope that Jack survives.
” comes down from the crow’s nest, and the heads of everyone on deck lift in surprise.  They’re not due to make port in Havana for another four days.
Dean huffs out a breath of relief, pointedly avoiding the remains of the douen’s most recent meal, and begins to cut Jean-Luc’s bindings with his knife.  Castiel braces his hands on his knees, dizzy with the odor clogging his nose, the horrific tableau of scattered children’s skeletons, and the relief of finding two children still breathing.
Sam gives him a sympathetic smile and jerks his head in the direction of the bunker door.  “How about you come inside, and we can get started on some breakfast?”
“Listen, I… I’m not going to pretend I get what it is to lose that kind of power,” Dean says.  “I don’t.  And I know all these stupid little things humans have to put up with – I know it’s all new and it’s all a pain in the ass.  But I think you’re not looking clearly at what’s going on.”
Cas squeezes his shoulders, craning his neck to plant a kiss on Dean’s temple.  “Of course I blew it,” he says softly, and Dean can barely hear him, rapidly sinking into sleep.  “She wasn’t my type.”
Somehow, Castiel understands what Dean’s trying to do, and in unison they seize Frank from the front and slam him down onto the ground, crunching the douen underneath.  There’s a loud
“Practically everything you ever heard of is real,” Garth says with a light chuckle.  “Any case, I can’t think of a worse fate than turning into an angry ghost.”
Jack watches the sky for a few minutes, letting Castiel think his thoughts, then stands upright again.  “Come on, Cas,” he says.  “Let’s get you home.  I’ll drive you.”
—” Dean pants, fingers digging into Cas’s shoulders hard enough to leave imprints.  He cants his hips upward, begging Cas to just fucking
Castiel casts one look over his shoulder, at the door to the captain’s cabin, and hears something heavy slam inside.  He watches Dean stalk all the way to the prow, climbing up to the foredeck and disappearing behind the railing.
Jack leans over and twists the key in the ignition.  The engine stops, the headlights switch off, and the Impala plunges into resonating darkness, sitting on the side of the road bracketed by nothing but corn.
“Making sure you were human,” Dean finishes for him.  “Some creatures have been known to disguise themselves as one of us.  Holy water, silver knife, copper coin.  Quick way to tell if the person you’re talking to is actually a person.”
A rustling behind him makes him turn around to see Cas standing in the doorway.  He’s wearing only a too-big t-shirt and sweatpants, rumpled from sleep.  Dean has to work to suppress a snort but manages to instead offer Cas some coffee.
Dean recalls vaguely that he’d been confused and hesitant before this, but it already seems like a distant, fuzzy memory, not much more than a dream.  He can’t quite believe that he was ever uncertain, ever apprehensive.  In fact, the only thing he can think about at this moment is wondering why the hell it’s taken him this long.
Castiel’s shoulder prickles where the mermaid bit him.  In truth, he had completely forgotten the injury was even there; he’d been far too focused on hunting the douen and getting Jean-Luc and Feliciana to safety.  It doesn’t hurt any more, not really, though the scabs are just starting to itch now that he’s aware of them again.  “It’s fine,” he answers, returning to cleaning the blood from Dean’s skin.  “I’ve always been a quick healer.”
Sam is standing frozen with his eyes wide and jaw dropped, Eileen’s duffle bag hanging from his shoulder.  Eileen has her hands clamped over her mouth, desperately trying not to laugh but failing as she starts to snort through her fingers.
Nearly two months after they beat Chuck, Cas wakes tangled in Dean’s limbs.  Dean is snoring, his arm draped over Cas’s middle.  Cas waits for a while, watching Dean sleep and relishing in the warmth of the too-small bed.  He idly traces shapes on Dean’s bare shoulder with his index finger, ghosting over freckles and scars from old fights.  Finally, the clock turns over to eight-thirty and Cas sighs, not quite ready to leave this moment.  He wakes Dean, gently running his hand over Dean’s forearm until he stirs.
“Exactly what I thought.”  Paradis snaps his fingers to emphasize his point.  “So, I went through all the security footage from the past year, and this happens at least twice a month.  Always on garbage day.  Except,” he says, leaning forward, “the garbage men usually pick up the black bags.”
Garth looks up to the sky, where the stars are just beginning to emerge.  “That’s too bad,” he muses.  “You’re pretty handy in a fight.  Plus, you’re good company.”
“Maryann,” says Robin, beckoning her to the desk as she unbuttons her jacket.  “These men are here from the FBI.”
Cas flips the book closed for a moment so that Dean can see the cover.  “Aldous Huxley,” he says.  “Have you read it?”
Castiel stands there for a minute, shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot with questions piling up in his head.  But Frank’s still on edge, and he hasn’t holstered his pistol, and Castiel doesn’t want to risk being shot through the head.
Dean has fully lost it, sinking onto the step down into the TV room, tears streaming down his reddened face as he laughs too hard to talk.  “Shit, my
Cas’s breath hitches in his throat at the unexpected question. He cocks his head, unsure if Dean meant how he held his hand or how he spoke. Worried the moment might break, worried Dean might not answer or might change the subject if Cas asked, he takes one of Dean’s hands into his, wrapping his ten fingers around the hunters tired and worked hand. Dean doesn't stop him, doesn't pull away.
He drops Dean's hand. Suddenly overcome with everything he had just confessed. Overcome with being so open about everything he feels.
It's dark and shifts slowly, not really walking. He watches it as it makes its way around the room, occasionally reaching out and touching things, moving them, taking some, before heading back to the bathroom. And then it's gone.
He and Cas have shared a bed many times in the years they've known each other but after seeing how Cas looked after him last night this time felt different.
It is not the first time Cas has held Dean’s hand through a nightmare and it most certainly won't be the last. The secret of last night doesn't weigh heavy on Cas as it does Dean. He feels at peace with it, grateful for it even. The whispers he shared in the dark were as much for him as they were for Dean.
Cas notices the cabinet at the end of the bath is locked from the inside. He nudges Dean and shows him the find. “Okay, good to know. Good job buddy.'' They only have another 40 seconds before the camera resets so Dean makes for the window again.
He marvels at how natural and easy it looks for Castiel. The nightmare fades out, Dean's body relaxed and settled back into a comfortable position. His breathing slowed to normal. He watches as they both drift off.
The fall had been hard, crushing for all the angels but Castiel, he didn’t just lose his wings. He lost everything, he lost all that made him an angel, all that made him, him.
Dean smiles telling Cas that he taught him acceptance and unconditional love like he has never known. He confesses of how many moments he has wanted to reach out and hold Castiel's hand or lean in to him or kiss him.
“Hunter.” The ghoul stands above Cas, smirking at him. “Always enjoy a hunter, more satisfying than the usual begging idiots. Hunters try to fight, you can almost taste the fight in their blood and their meat.”
The hunter can’t help it, listening to Cas is helping, even if Cas thinks he’s resolving a completely different issue. Satisfied that Dean’s breathing is steady, Cas lies back down properly. He shifts his hand from Dean's chest to Dean's hand. He starts tracing circles on it softly.
Dean tells Cas about the camera set up, about what he saw. He tells him about the cupboard he found and shows Cas the footage from their room, stopping it immediately after the figure disappeared back into the bathroom. “Not a ghost” Cas mutters in thought.
He heads to a room on the ground floor and sets his bag on the bed. Dean gave him a makeshift signal blocker that will kill the camera in his room for a few minutes. He turns it on, opens a window and texts Dean his room number. Within a minute Dean is through the window and joining Cas in the bathroom.
After that the 2 men had fallen into silence. They had continued to drink, until Sam was ready for bed. The hunter had risen from the table and headed to the door before he threw a quiet goodbye over his shoulder. Sam had then stopped at the door and turned back to face the room, “you’re wrong”, he started. “You’ve lost a lot but you haven’t lost what makes you, you. You haven’t lost everything.” He then watched Cas lower his head towards the table, nodded to himself and left.
Cas pauses for a moment to look over at Dean. His friend was breathing calmly and the tension in his shoulders seemed to be dispercing.
They find the security room easily, Dean has been in enough motels to know the basic layouts and he is yet to find one with an ounce of originality.
The weeks after that night trickled them by, leaving it behind, seemingly forgotten by the three men. They settled into life together comfortably, it felt natural to all three of them. Cas had always had a room in the bunker, he had always had a right to call it home, the only difference now was that it was more permanent.
Finally awake enough to move, Cas heads to the bathroom to try and feel more human. As he leaves the bathroom 15 minutes later, Dean calls over “Hey, you seen my phone? I know I left it on the table.”
“Nah man, you’ll kill your back. There's nowhere else to sleep we’ll, we’ll just share - dont worry.” Cas nods, feeling suddenly shy, almost letting himself look it.
“I- uh, I held your hand and I promised you that you were safe, that you weren't alone, that you would wake up. I told you I was sorry, that I hadn’t meant what I said. That I had misevaluated what I had. I spoke until your shallow breathing steadied and then I uh- I over stepped and I” he lifts one of his hands away from where they were clasped and he gently brushes the side of Dean's face, to show Dean what he means. Dean closes his eyes, breathing deeply. Every thought that had been racing through his mind stilled, all focus now on Castiel's hand and Dean’s face. “I did that and-and I watched as the heavy emotions left your features. And then I pulled back because I knew it was wrong of me to do that. But, that was the last time I have done that. Not talking you through nightmares I've done that since but- that was the first time as a human I helped you.”
He scrolls through the rest of the footage while he downloads it onto a stick to show Cas and just as he goes to close it off he notices asleep him beginning to move his head and hands in a restless, panicking way.
Dean volunteers to go and grab some pizza, refusing Castiel's offer to come with him. He wants a few minutes alone. He's still not had a chance to wrap his head around the video footage he saw this morning and it’s been on replay for him all day.
Cas looks nervous as he takes a big gulp from the bottle. It's not the first time he's had to be stitched up by the Winchesters but it doesn't make it any easier and the long cuts along his arm will take a good few stitches to be closed up properly.
The ghoul steps forward, it lashes out. It is aiming for Cas’s arm, to grab him and throw him back down. It catches it.
Cas must have winced sharper than he intended as Dean pauses for a second, looking up to his best friend in concern. They both take another drink.
“Cas, I was a little uncomfortable yeah, but not because of what you think. I didn't think someone would care that much about me. I didn't think you cared for me that much. I never thought that you would see me in a nightmare and willingly ride it out with me. I didn't know that was how you felt” he smiles as Cas cocks his head.
”  There’s an aproned giant of a man standing outside his stall, a sausage-sized finger jabbing in their direction while his face rapidly turns purple.
“Do you do this for everyone?” Cas has to ask, because he knows human souls find their way to their destination just fine without divine interference.
late nights at the Roadhouse, fishing with Bobby, Dean’s first girlfriend and his high school prom, the time Eileen came home to find Dean had dented the car.  Their laughter echoes out across the hillside, carried on the breeze as the sun sinks lower and lower.
He drops his duffel on the foot of his bed and goes to the sink.  His reflection greets him sullenly, worn-down and rumpled from a lack of sleep.  He looks
Cas is standing by the Impala, his face turned toward the sky with his eyes closed.  He’s breathing deeply, taking in the fresh air and sunshine.
He thinks her gas pedal might have cut the bare sole of his foot, but it doesn’t bother him enough to stop.
Two days later, Sam walks into the bunker kitchen, hoping for a beer.  He can’t remember the last time he was hungry for anything that wasn’t a numbing agent.  He has no idea what time of day it is, but checking the clock is low on his list of priorities.  Honestly, at this point it’s a miracle he’s even showered and dressed.  The smell of the burning pyre still lingers in his nose, even thirty-six hours after the fact.
Dean is stuck, spinning his wheels in nothing but mud.  He doesn’t know what he thinks.  He has no idea why he assumed last night that just seeing Cas would help to make heads or tails of what’s going through his own head.  Now that Cas is in front of him, everything makes even less sense than it did before.
“I mean, four hunters to a case is kind of overkill, isn’t it?” he says.  “Practically no sport in it.”
“I’m Castiel,” Castiel says, almost wishing she’d give him something to peel so that he’d have a task to occupy his hands.
But, logically, there should be even less reason to panic where Cas is concerned.  Cas has a deeper understanding of Dean’s history, of Dean’s inner workings and the various emotional labyrinths his brain seems to construct at the slightest hair trigger, than anybody else on the planet.  And if Dean’s honest with himself, that confounds him more than anything — that Cas has seen
plenty of counter space, a baker’s bench, pots and pans hanging from a rack overhead.  On one end of the counter, a 90’s-era stereo sits beside several small potted herbs; the aroma of thyme and rosemary and basil fills the kitchen.
The island gives a great, terrible shudder, a sound coming up from the earth below like a thousand-year-old fury.
Dean is the opposite, deep in sleep with his mouth slightly open and his face squashed heavily into the pillow.  His eyes flick back and forth underneath the lids.  A muscle in his cheek spasms.  Cas studies the contour of his nose and can’t help running a finger down the curve of his jaw.  Dean doesn’t stir.  For once, he’s not snoring.
,” Dean chokes out, and Cas loops an arm around Dean’s back, slipping underneath the bathrobe, and yanks him down into a messy sliding kiss of tongue and teeth.
Cas lets out a long exhale, the first easy breath he’s taken since Akron.  There are now eleven people in the meadow, and all he can feel is gratitude.
Dean swallows, clears his throat.  Blinks and refocuses.  Castiel can see him pulling himself together, restructuring himself from the inside out, and Dean nods.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I’m good.”
Cas had, without any demands, given him the opportunity to maintain the lie, and Dean chose to be open, and he’d chosen on his own.
He unlatches the tailgate with his heart pounding.  There’s a blue tarp covering Cas’s body where it lays next to a large tool box.  Sam allows himself a single nerve-steeling breath, then pushes the tarp aside.  Instantly, he recoils.
“Yes.  Definitely.”  Cas waves to Eileen as she looks at him through the diner window and points to her watch.  “I have to go, Dean, but as soon as Eileen and I finish with this case we’ll head up to Akron.”
The douen looks smaller than Castiel remembered it, but maybe it’s just the perspective inside the cramped den, or the fact that it’s dead and unmoving.  It lies with its limbs akimbo, arms limp, a truly grotesque animal that makes Castiel’s stomach turn.
been following it?” Castiel demands, exasperation hooking in his throat, his words coming out sharper than he intends.  “Dean said they’d been hunting it for months."
Castiel follows Dean’s gaze upward, to the glittering black.  Cassiopeia and Perseus arch across the sky, and to the east a meteor falls, fizzing out just as quickly as it appeared.  “Yes, it is,” he agrees.
Frank’s entire demeanor changes in a second.  His eyes widen, he leans forward, elbows on the table.  “An aspidochelone?” he echoes.  “You survived an aspidochelone?”
In the blackness of the water, there is a creature he has never seen before.  It’s dark, barely visible against the void, except for little bioluminescent flecks along a dorsal fin.  It slithers through the water like a serpent.  As it rounds the bow, silent as a ghost, it turns and looks up, and a pair of hollow eyes flash in the light of the moon.  It has a human face.
She smiles.  “Mr. Winchester said you’d be coming in.  I can’t let you into the room right now, but you can have a seat.”  She points to a sitting area in the corner, with old magazines arranged neatly in a rack between a water cooler and a coin-operated Keurig machine.
Cas is the one who speaks first.  “Dean, I want you to know that I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable,” he says, watching the river.  “I know that you don’t feel the same way I do, and I’m okay with that.  I have no interest in pressuring you for anything.”
As he drives the Valiant down the winding driveway toward the road, Sam glances in the rearview mirror for just long enough to see Dean and Cas wave before they go back inside the house.  The engine rumbles underneath him as he makes it back to the road, bouncing slightly onto the pavement.
The town of Tortuga is more pleasant late at night, without the heavy aroma of sweat and shit and fish, or the unbearable heat of the sun making the smell worse.  The wind has died down and the island has cooled, stars winking above and the moon swinging near the mountains on the far side of the harbor.
He huffs, turning over and gazing at the crack of light under his door from the hallway.  With nothing else pressing, nothing else breathing down his neck, his mind wanders unchecked back to the bridge.  Back to Cas’s face, smiling in the sun.
Cas nods in agreement, still panting from the exertion of wrestling with a werewolf twice his size.  “This was so much easier when I had powers,” he remarks, idly kicking the severed head of the alpha away from its body with the toe of his boot.
“I can see that,” Dean snaps, clinging to whatever shred of dignity he’s got left.  “You ever hear of a knock?”
Cas laughs, and for the first time in ages, it’s genuine.  His own cooking skills leave a lot to be desired, but Eileen is
Castiel glances over to where Dean is walking beside him, Jean-Luc’s arms still folded around his neck.  Dean hums quietly, a repetitive but soothing tune.  The melody is unfamiliar to Castiel, but he’d not received many lullabies as a child and doesn’t recall any now.
In the small moments where Cas and Dean are alone, they discover each other gradually, bit by bit.  Cas decides that this is the best time in his eons-long life.
Dean twists abruptly, clamping a calloused hand over Castiel’s mouth, and Castiel sucks a startled breath through his nose.  Dean’s eyes are barely six inches from his, wide and reflecting moonlight.  He presses a finger to his lips.
Sam pauses and looks up at that.  Cas’s eyes are still a bit red around the edges, and he definitely hasn’t shaved in at least a couple of days.  The flannel he threw on over his t-shirt is wrinkled, like it’s been sitting in a laundry hamper for a while.  Given how exhausted he looks, Sam supposes it’s a miracle Cas made it the four-hour drive from Lebanon to Bonner Springs without crashing the Impala.
Abruptly, Sam is struck with the stomach-twisting sense that he’s walked in on something he wasn’t supposed to see, and he quickly puts the application back down.  He gathers the dishes and leaves the room.
sails south through the Caicos passage, little islands poking up out of the waves on both the eastern and western horizons.  The sunset this particular night is a brilliant pink rippled with orange, a mackerel sky, and the ocean turns to wine.
“Does that feel good?” Cas whispers, his touch drifting along the arch of Dean’s eyebrows – first one, then the other.
Castiel has never heard any member of any crew argue like this with their captain before.  He’s shocked to his core that it’s on his behalf.  So shocked, in fact, that he doesn’t hear Dean coming until it’s too late.
Castiel and Ishim throw their shoulders against the dinghy, pushing it toward the water, but it’s not necessary.  The land flexes and drops abruptly, water rushing up the rocks.  The wave seizes the dinghy and lifts it easily, and Castiel and Ishim are barely able to climb in before they’re dragged to the same fate as Inias.  The ocean surges up, flooding past the beach, vegetation and trees disappearing into the water.
“Alright, no more vamp talk,” Dean says quietly, then deftly changes the subject to teasing Eileen again about her choice in food.
A noise to his right draws his attention, and he grabs Dean’s arm.  In the corner lies the only body still somewhat intact — half-eaten and missing any distinguishing features — and next to it, bound in vines like flies in a web are two small children.
Dean finally stops laughing for long enough to eat his pie, which he does heartily and quickly, wolfing it down like a mutt that’s not seen a proper meal in months.  Castiel eats his more slowly, savoring the richly spiced pork filling, and Dean takes a bite of a red apple, again producing food from seemingly nowhere.
The little girl wriggles through next, skirt catching on twigs as she comes through the tunnel on her hands and knees.  Castiel grabs her under the arms the moment he’s able, hauling her the rest of the way and sending her after Jean-Luc.
He knows Cas definitely doesn’t have Spotify or Apple Music, and he doubts Cas even has a CD player at the bunker.  Dean’s resistance to new technologies was one of the many characteristics Cas had adopted as his own as he slowly began to prefer the company of humans to angels, all those years ago, and he’s never quite grown out of it.  Hell, it’s a miracle he has an up-to-date smartphone.
Dean sits on a nearby crate and removes his boot, then rolls up his trouser leg to expose the bite on his calf.  He squints at the wound as he takes the damp cloth from Castiel’s hand and begins to clean it.
“Don’t worry, I have one for you too,” she assures him, pulling a second uniform out of her duffel.  It so happens that she has a friend in New York who works in costume design, has an excellent eye for detail, and most importantly, owes Eileen a
Cas, about to stand and collect the empty bottles for the trash, sits still again.  “Oh?  What’s that?”
Sam clears his throat, glancing between them with something like guilt flickering over his face.  “I’ll, uh— I’ll leave you guys to it.”
Eileen raises her eyebrows, glitching into pixels momentarily.  “Am I going to have to separate you two?
They chase the rest of the pack all the way to the roof and run out of the service door into the blinding sunlight.  The three remaining Nachzehrers are crouched with their teeth bared, ready to defend their territory.
Sam is quiet again, digesting this new information.  Dean can practically hear the gears in Sam’s head spinning away.  He’s struggling to figure out how to put his thoughts into words, and all Dean wants is for Sam to either hurry up and say what he has to say or go back inside and leave Dean in the dark.
Castiel runs a palm over his face, still groggy.  He feels like he’s been asleep for a hundred years, and could sleep for a hundred more.  “Wha?” is the only sound he can articulate.
.”  Meg’s face taunts him, but he doesn’t care anymore.  “A human.  And when humans die, they don’t wake up.  They don’t come
Walking beneath the trees, with one hand interlocked with Dean’s and Miracle running ahead, Cas finds no need to fill the space between them with talk.
But Dean’s family has just been made significantly smaller, and it will be a hard conversation, and Sam is so
It’s not just Cas.  Sam has lived almost his entire life accustomed to losing loved ones.  His memories are filed in eras of
“Only on days we’re not rescuing near-dead sailors,” replies the captain smoothly.  He cracks the first smile since his arrival.  It’s wide and mirthless and full of teeth.
He takes the bedsheets out of the bags, walks down the opposite hall to the linen closet, then drops the movie poster onto the desk in his bedroom.
Donna shrugs her business-suit jacket off her shoulders.  “Well, okey dokey, then.  How do we kill ‘em?”
Missouri shoulders past Dean and Patience, and Frank lurches to his feet, seizing his gun from the table.  Castiel stands too, suddenly wishing he still had the copper cutlass, but he’d left it on the
Dean swears loudly and viciously when Cas rolls his hips into him.  The action sends a searing pulse of electricity crashing through him, ricocheting from his groin through his chest and back again.  Dean’s fist curls against Cas’s pectoral, tugging his shirt so ferociously that it nearly rips.  The cloth chafes along Cas’s neck and leaves a reddened line under his skin.
Robin glances at the photo for only half a second, arms still crossed.  “If he has, you should know that federal patient privacy laws prevent me from discussing our patient’s care without a warrant.”  Their eyebrows shoot upwards, challenging.  “
There’s no time to argue.  From above, more than a dozen douens are scuttling down, skittering, hissing, branches cracking as they head for the invaders of their nest.
Dean presses another reassuring kiss to Cas’s temple.  “Hey,” he says softly, making Cas look up.  “We’ve got all the time in the world.”
He does, and together they carry Dean’s body out of the barn, back to the Impala.  Sam is already on his feet, and the three of them struggle to get him into the back seat.  Cas gets into the car and pulls from inside, and ends up sitting behind the driver’s seat with Dean’s head and shoulders in his arms.  Cas is pinned under Dean’s weight, but he doesn’t want to move and refuses Sam’s suggestion to sit in the front seat.
Cas lets his head fall on Dean’s shoulder, in the crook of his neck, relishing in the warmth pulsing from Dean’s body.  He’s not ready to leave this moment yet.  “I want to stay here.”
“I’m not going over the bees with you again,” Cas replies evenly, though he crinkles his nose affectionately in Dean’s direction before stepping over to Sam.  He takes the tape from Sam’s hand and slides it back into the stereo, clicking it shut and pressing
Castiel wipes water from his brow, now more annoyed than confused (although he’s that too).  Explanations, it seems, are a rare commodity on this vessel.  “Havana,” he spits.
At the sensation of the boat rocking gently under his feet, Castiel breathes a sigh of relief, already feeling more at home than on solid land.  There’s no one else on deck — with the ship moored, there’s no need for anyone at the helm — and the windows to the captain’s cabin are dark.  A few oil lanterns hang from the
“Sam told me he would give me details when I land, but I don’t think anything noteworthy has happened yet,” Dean told her as he breathed out a heavy sigh.
“So Cas- can I call you Cas? Why did you become a pilot?” Dean asked. Castiel was getting to be quite the mouthful.
Dean let out a breath of air that was just on the verge of a scoff. “What are you? My mother? I’m fine, Cas.”
Cas’s lips were beyond chapped, but being on island would do that to you. Dean didn’t mind, of course, for he was sure his own lips were in no better shape. Cas pulled away gently but stayed close enough that Dean could still feel his breath. Their foreheads were pressed together and Dean wanted to close the small gap between them. He wanted to kiss Cas again and again, wanted to wrap his arms around Cas and never let go.
Cas didn’t look up. Dean knew that he had been heard, though, because Cas suddenly began to spin his stick faster, moving his hands up and down it.
The doctor, who had a badge clipped to her jacket that said her name was Dr. Carson, tried to direct Dean back to his room. When Dean wouldn’t budge, she sighed gently.
“About anything in particular or…?” Dean didn’t quite know if Cas wanted to open up. Sometimes he would tell Dean exactly what the problem was and other times he was sealed as tightly as a Ma'lak Box.
The lightning came next. He had his eyes closed when the first strike hit, only knowing something had happened due to the “Motherfucker,” Cas spat into the microphone. Dean peeled his eyes open in time to see a flash of lightning, shooting down from the rain clouds and disappearing into the fog below.
Every few moments Dean would glance up at the helicopter sitting just 100 feet away from him. The sun had come out now and was reflecting off the sleek black surface, which appeared to have been recently cleaned. Gabriel had referred to Novak’s helicopter as a “junker”, and while Dean wasn’t a helicopter expert, he thought that it looked pretty clean and classy.
Dean threw his hands up in frustration. “You can blame this crash on me but you can’t blame your fucking concussion on me! I’m not the one who hit their head and can’t even fucking think straight!”
Dean was left alone with Gabriel and had two hours to kill, so he figured some small talk couldn’t hurt.
Castiel kept looking anywhere but the direction he was headed in. Before Dean could even open his mouth he saw Cas’s foot slip off the edge, pulling the rest of his body after.
“Yeah, well, just- Goddamnit Cas, just get back here,” Dean instructed. Castiel hadn’t been at the bunker in what seemed like years, even though it was probably just a week or so because he was out doing angel crap. Or so he claims. However long he had been away, it was slowly killing Dean.
“Why don’t you just make me?” Dean’s voice went low and gravelly, much different than what it had been before.
Slowly but surely, he began to make his way down towards Cas. He was trying to be extra careful, fully aware that they would be utterly helpless if both of them were injured. As he neared Castiel he could feel this urge to move quicker, to get to him faster. His clouded mind is what caused him to slip.
So that’s how it was going to be, huh? They were just going to carry on and never speak to each other again?
expect.  It’s not huge, but it’s not small either, mainly consisting of one large room that combines a den, kitchen, and dining area.  A fireplace is fitted into the far wall, a guitar sits on a stand next to a long comfortable-looking couch.  Books line the shelves along one wall and a door to the right leads to what Sam assumes is a bedroom.
Castiel has no chance to argue or defend himself before Mr. Singer grabs his wrist and slices a shallow cut across the back of his forearm.  He yanks his hand to his chest, wincing.  He’s bleeding, not heavily, but it still stings.  The next instant, Mr. Singer takes a water flask and splashes Castiel in the face with its contents.
and he watches the empty town slide past in the dark.  He thinks he feels the Impala sigh in relief under a gentler hand on her steering wheel.  Jack avoids all the potholes and bumps on the road leading to the bunker.
“Sam and Eileen,” Cas repeats.  “Do you think they deserve what they have together?  Do you think they deserve even more?”
It does make Castiel feel slightly better, only because he feels a little less exposed, but then Frank ruins it.
“Alright, well, enjoy your little weird violent romantic evening,” Dean concedes, and leaves them to it.
“Maybe.”  Cas pauses, squinting into the sunlight.  “You’re not exactly the outwardly emotional type.”
“Well, like the coroner said, a lot of arrests but nothing violent,” Sam says, skimming down the front page of Fred Sargent’s arrest record.  “He was a veteran, homeless, no family.  Seems like a guy who got dealt a bad hand.  Oh, and he apparently was at the Kettle Cove Rehab Clinic a couple times a month at least.”
Cas is familiar with Dean’s sleep patterns, has watched over him more than enough times to know what Dean’s bad dreams look like, and he has no intention of letting Dean’s nightmare continue.  “Dean,” he says, more firmly, rubbing a palm up and down Dean’s bicep.  When that doesn’t work, Cas resorts to giving Dean a solid shake.  “Dean!  Wake up.”
This is the closest Cas has gotten to flying since before the Fall, and a savage grin pulls at the corners of his mouth.
Eileen completely loses the battle not to laugh and starts giggling like a schoolgirl, so much so that she has to shake her head and back away.  “I’m gonna go back to the library,” she manages to get out between cackles.
Frank grumbles but lowers his weapon at last, his suspicious glare unwavering.  A tiny muscle under his right eye spasms as Dean sidles through the door past him.
Sam does the only logical thing, then, and pulls Dean into a hug.  “Thank you,” he says into Dean’s shoulder.
He’s not hungry.  He turns down breakfast and sips on his coffee and ignores the weird look Sam’s giving him.  When Dean comes in a few minutes later, Cas can’t seem to find the energy to listen in while Sam informs them of the newest possible case he’s found.  He keeps his nose in his mug, breathing in the steam and trying to shake this feeling of unfounded annoyance.
“Dean, stop!” Cas managed to get words out of his mouth and just in case Dean hadn’t heard him, he held up his hand telling Dean to stay back.
Not that Dean was big on apologies, but before he could even get one out Cas was spinning around and marching down to the beach. Dean rolled his eyes at first, internally calling Cas immature, but as he walked away Dean felt a twang of regret.
Dean looked around the room. It was like he couldn’t believe that Cas was talking to him. “No, I’m fine Cas.”
“Strength in numbers,” Dean was trying to be casual, “This is the third day we’ve been on this damn island and no one has found us yet; who knows if they ever will. We are stuck here and I don’t know about you, but I would actually like to try and get back to see my dying father!”
Cas was on him faster than Dean could even register what was happening. Cas had him pinned up against the nearest tree, his shirt wrapped up tightly between Cas’ fists.
Dean sat up, quickly looking around the area in case Cas had just gotten up to stretch his legs or something, but he wasn’t anywhere that Dean could see. Dean jumped to his feet, his heart rate beginning to accelerate.
“Dean, this is serious!” Cas gripped onto his shoulder and tried to shake him out of his slumber. “Listen!”
Dean’s eyes followed the smoke as it disappeared above them. “This is good, right? It’s like a smoke signal- they’ll be able to find us now, right?”
His messenger bag bounced heavily against his leg now that it was weighed down with coconuts. He wasn’t even sure if they were going to be able to break them open, but it was worth a shot. Dean had picked up a rather sharp looking rock somewhere along the way and he hoped they could use that to help them with the whole coconut situation.
Cas was right about that. The chances of crashing into an island instead of nose diving into the Atlantic must be very slim. It was a fairly big island, at least from where Dean was sitting, so surely it couldn’t be some random unchartered gem.
Cas raised a limp hand and gave what Dean could only assume to be a half-assed thumbs up. At least he was alive.
Dean scoffed a little, maybe even letting out a small laugh. “I told you that you were going to get yourself killed,” Dean joked.
“Yes, Gabriel is my brother. An annoying one at that, but my brother nonetheless,” Castiel said. “We were adopted,” He filled in when Dean didn’t respond to the first statement. “If you were wondering why we look different.”
Dean’s heart was going to explode out of his chest. He fumbled with the harness style seatbelt, eventually getting himself strapped in. The helicopter tilted away from the dark clouds that they were approaching and aimed more towards the grey sky area.
Suddenly there was an elbow in his guts and Charlie was shaking him out of his popsicle sucking trance, directing his attention down the boardwalk. Dean spotted a man walking in their direction with an open suit jacket and blue tie blowing in the breeze.
He pulled himself out of the cave and began to twist around, cracking his back and any joint that followed after. Dean stretched his hands far above his head and soon heard an unintelligible grumble from behind him. He turned around to see Cas lingering by the cave entrance, his hair a wreck and his eyes squinting so much they might as well be closed.
But they were stuck. They were stuck all alone on an island in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, chewing on an old granola bar and leaving the most important things unsaid.
Cas kept flicking his eyes between the grey world in front of them and the screen on his dashboard, occasionally raising his hand to flip a switch or press a button. At last, the world fell quiet.
It was that line that just sent Dean right over the edge. “You want me to tell you how I really feel, do you?” Dean’s voice started low, “I think you should have told me that flying in this weather was impossible. I think you should have taken the extra time to go around the storm. I think you should have just turned back when the rain got too havey to fucking see through!”
The idea of willingly getting into a helicopter - especially one described as a “junker” - wasn’t something Dean had ever planned on doing in his lifetime. But, alas, life can throw some nasty curveballs sometimes. One of those being a family emergency so severe that it was going to force Dean to leave his vacation four days early.
I’m useless- I don’t deserve you worrying over me. It won’t do either of us any good in the long run.”
“Well, wait a minute Cas,” Dean said, haltingly. “You said those microburst things are impossible to detect so… don’t blame yourself for not being able to do the impossible.”
“Yeah, I’m listening,” He said, nodding his head slightly. “Although I would rather find a way off the island than live here in a tree house.”
Cas got up from the table and stumbled across the room, eager to get away from Dean to cease the pain.
Dean almost expected Castiel to say that Gabriel was merely a close friend- it would make sense after all. The pair looked nothing alike. Gabriel with his shoulder-length dirty blonde hair and his laid-back attitude. Castiel probably stood half a foot taller than the guy. Along with that, their hair colors were complete opposites and they didn’t have any similar features (not that Dean had memorized every inch of Gabriel’s face, but what he could remember didn’t seem to match Castiel at all).
He gave a quick once over of the back row before slipping out the hole where the door had been blown off.
It would take days for them to die of starvation, but it would be slow and agonizing. There was no point in sitting around while their hunger tried to bite them in the ass.
When Dean did finally decide to crack open his eyelids, the fantasies of being back home quickly washing away, the first thing he noticed wasn’t the trees or the bright sun. It was the hunger. It had begun to eat at his insides, creeping up his body to the point where it was going to give him a headache. He knew they couldn’t make it the rest of the day just on coconut meat. They would have to figure out how to catch something, be it fish or crab or hell- Dean would even eat a frog at this point.
They hadn’t been awake for very long when Cas suddenly stood up, tossing the remains of crab meat breakfast aside.
Dean takes in a long drink, “Cas I thought I was done for. One of them was coming for me and the look in her eye, man, I thought it was going to be the last thing I ever saw.” The hunter pauses again, looking down at his bottle. “Then the other one grabbed her hand, turned her away from me. I have no idea why. Before I gave them a second to think I threw myself towards the bible and I managed to get it alight.”
Hes human, he has no defense against this monster. If it grabs him he will bleed, he will break as any human would.
Cas watches for a moment before moving his hand from dean’s shoulder to over dean's heart, he leaves it there measuring the pace at which it’s beating. Dean feels Cas’s hand sit warmly on the fabric of his t-shirt.
When bladders and stomachs out cry their hangovers. Cas barely opens his eyes as he heads to the bathroom. Dean barely walks as he heads to the left over take away. Both feeling barely human.
Dean groans and moves to put his feet up onto the table, thankful for the change in topic. “Sammy is better than I am. I'm sure you’d learn more from him than me.” Cas smiles and shakes his head, “No. You promised, you have to teach me, no handing me off to Sam.” Cas looks at Dean with a small smirk on his face. He watches as the hunter rolls his eyes, “Alright, fine, fine.” he smiles at his friend, “it'll cost you beer, burgers and 3 movies of my choice.”
Cas stands in the hot water waking up slowly, trying to pull himself together. He is half way through washing when Dean’s words from last night flood into his head. ‘Knowing you has been the best part of my life too.’
He watches in shock as Castiel sat watching for a moment before grabbing the hand still resting on him. He then lay back down, closer to Dean than before.
“Look out duty.” he states to his confused friend. The confusion is quickly replaced with a glare. “No. This was my idea, I am not your guard dog and, between the two of us, I do not have the superior people skills.”
He knows of it. He has seen shards of it in Deans nightmares, but Dean has never talked about it in front of him.
It's dark when they arrive, the sun setting an hour and a half before they finally reach their room.
He has no idea when the thoughts of Cas transitioned into dreams of Cas but he found himself waking up hours later, still filled with wonder from the night before. ‘Now what?’ he thinks.
He is not defenceless, Dean is right outside the window and there is no one he trusts more to have his back.
Cas can feel his nerves rising and he does his best to not let them take over and stop him from speaking, “You said something to me last night that I said when I thought you were sleeping.''
They shuffling about the motel room does not mix well with the amount of alcohol travelling through their systems and both have to keep pausing to steady themselves between their wobbly, slow movements. They get into bed, both giggling at the state of the other one, teasing each other on the bad heads they’ll have tomorrow.
And just before either drifts off to sleep Dean's voice breaks through the silence. “Cas, so you know, knowing you has been the best part of my life too.” And then sleep washed over them both.
They fill the drive with idle chatter, breaking occasionally so Dean can sing along to a song or so that Cas can read up more, follow hunches or check ideas that he came up with.
Dean feels almost shy, “I'm sorry, I wanted to do that forever, I should have asked, I’m-” but he's cut off with Cas leaning in for another kiss.
Cas wakes up a few moments later. Not enough to speak but enough to sit and grab his coffee. He smiles at Dean over his mug, the hunter is still humming to himself. He's in a good mood, must have slept well Cas thinks.
He lay still in shock at what he had just done. Panic set in. What if that has woken Cas, what if Cas thinks he’s in a nightmare.
He stretches as he wakes, his hand falling from Castiel's side of the bed as he does so. He huffs. He's always known he was a pain to sleep next to, he always intrudes in the other person's space.
It went well, the entire time Cas strived to impress his friends, to prove he was just as useful as before. The only difference was that he was more nervous than before, more hesitant, although he did his best to not let it show. The knowledge that he no longer had his grace to fall back on loomed over him, made him wary.
Neither of them knows who falls asleep first, who moves towards the other's warmth first, who turns to sleep facing the other first.
Dean kneels down gently next to him, assessing the damage. He puts on a smile and looks Cas in the eye, “It’s not too bad, alright. Couple of stitches. You’re going to be okay. I am however going to have to do this -” POP.
Dean, although loving every moment of the day, would say the best are yet to come. Because days in the future will start and end with Cas by his side. They will be filled with requited, loud love. They will be all he has yearned for.
The clock hits 11.15pm and he's in bed, lying on the right side. The left still empty as if waiting for Dean. He reminds himself that he can spread out and crawl into the middle if he wanted but he decides it would feel weird, so he stays where he is.
“I went to go back to my room that night. I intended to make sure we were okay over breakfast but I walked straight past it. And I stood outside of yours. I didn't know if to knock or call out or walk away. I wanted to apologise and tell you I was wrong. To tell you that I knew I had so much left. But i couldnt. I was stuck and when I got unstuck I went to turn away and then I heard - ”
He closes his eyes and moves away from Cas, his breathing shallow, reflecting the anxiety spreading through his veins.
Cas is still looking at him, making sure to catch Dean’s green eyes in his blue ones. Promising without a word that what he has to say needs to be said.  The look Dean gives back promises he's listening.
He lies there for another moment, thinking about the day ahead. He finally moves to get up when Cas first shifts, slowly drifting out of his sleep.
He's glad that Cas doesn't turn down or pull his face at the offer of a diner lunch. He's glad Cas doesn't pull more than a quizzical face at Dean when he grabs their packed bags and takes them with them. He’ll fill him in there.
He knows he has them. He assumes Cas has them, he's seen Sam have one a hundred times, they come with the job. But seeing himself, Dean can't look away.
“Top and tail?” Dean questions as he comes back from the bathroom. “Dean, i don’t know what that is.” comes the reply from the other end of the room. He takes a second and scratches the back of his neck before he decides he’s too tired to explain, or care.
He takes another look at the pissed off expression now clouding Castiel's face. “If you could hack into cameras man, then it's all yours. But last I checked you can't and this isn’t the classroom. This is breaking into somewhere. So you stay out here and you look out.”
As the body falls, as Dean breathes out, as Cas slumps down against the wall, the room goes silent. “Alright, good job man, here- Cas!”  Cas is sat on the ground, a dislocated shoulder and a bleeding arm.
“I was just 17 and it was 2 ghosts, nuns who had been in love, suicide. Unfinished business. It was a straightforward hunt. I’d hunted ghosts before but this time the training wheels were well and truly off. I spent a couple of days on the case, looking for what was holding them to earth. Eventually found a bible under the floorboards, a gift that one had given to the other. Soon as I found it the room went full paranormal activity. I felt like all the rock salt in the world wasn’t going to save me and I lost sight of the bible”
“I'm sorry” Castiel starts, “I shouldn't have done it, not once, not ever. I Should have spoken to you. I stepped into something personal and I didn't ask and  I shouldn-”
“Knowing you Dean, has been the best part of my life. Knowing you has changed me. The loss I had from the fall, as crushing as it felt then, I am grateful for it now. I have gained so much and I am so grateful. I can’t help you in the way i once could but i will always help you in every way I am able to.''
Cas stands, hands in pockets, looking around as dean is crouched in front of him, unlocking the door.
Where the cameras were sat in that motel room it would have been unmissable. And the way Dean had been quiet with him that day, had driven for so long for crappy pizza. The pieces were all fitting together.
Deans always had a hunch that when Cas had his powers he’d sometimes disrupt any nightmares that he saw Dean fight. He has memories of horrible dreams going from being in sharp focus to being hazy to being gone, replaced with something lighter.
He has enjoyed the time alone with Dean but he hates watching Dean battle in his sleep. The nightmares have been draining and two in a row has kept Cas from sleeping properly. He’s exhausted not only from the hunt but also the worry. He has also been on the shallow side of sleeping ever since Dean woke him the first night. Just in case he was needed.
After walking for ages in complete silence (well, silent if you ignore their heavy breathing) they reached what would be considered the top. It was a fairly flat area, and the moment they reached it Dean planted his sweaty hands on his knees and took in a deep breath.
They hiked back up the beach and Castiel proudly showed Dean how he cracked the coconuts open. They drank what little they could from them, the taste was bland and bitter but it still felt nice as it slid down Dean’s throat. The actual “meat” itself was no better, but it was something. Dean had never really been a fan of coconut, but you’ll eat just about anything if you were hungry enough.
Dean nodded his head and rose from the bench, giving a quick good-bye hug to Charlie before following the captain over to the helicopter.
Dean proudly opened his bag to reveal the few coconuts he had picked up on his walk. He held one up and passed it to Castiel, letting him examine the large fruit.
Dean gripped onto Cas and pressed a quick kiss to the side of his temple. The sound of the helicopter grew louder and Dean pulled back, waving one of his hands high above his head.
The worst part was the wind. Sudden bursts of high-speed winds were pushing them around, causing the helicopter to dip in every direction and then some. Dean’s knuckles were turning white and he kept his eyes shut, telling himself that Cas could handle it. Cas was a good pilot. Cas was the best pilot on the island. Cas would get him home.
The next thing Dean can remember was being shuttled into the helicopter and being handed a pair of light blue headphones, much like the ones he had worn in Castiel’s helicopter (which remained dead on the beach).
Cas titled his head. Dean seemed… hungry. Cas could sense he was lacking something- something his body needed to survive. He was so void of this substance that his body seemed to be screaming out for help. Dean was starving.
It was clear that Cas had been running around for quite a bit. His body heaved with heavy breaths and there was sweat dripping from the sides of his face. Despite the fact that he seemingly had been running for his life, he nodded.
“Dean,” Cas tried to focus on the energy again, tried to read it differently. “Human beings need affection- they’re wired to receive it. It’s just as important as food or water or sleep-”
Cas didn’t respond. His face had fallen flat, his lips drawn into a tight line. He avoided Dean’s gaze for a moment and focused his eyes somewhere else. Dean became worried he had pushed Cas’ boundaries again, worried that he had upset him, but Cas turned to face him slowly.
With Dean’s bag slung over his shoulder and Cas eagerly walking in the direction of the so-called mountain, they trekked through the woods. They had begun to make themselves a path, seemingly because they took the same route every time they went inland. It was easy enough to follow the trampled leaves through the thick jungle.
He didn’t go flailing down the mountainside, thank God, but it took him a minute to find solid footing again. He felt a sharp pain in his leg and glanced down, noticing a wide gash along the back of his calf.
Castiel nodded, clearly frustrated with Dean’s constant nagging. They worked their way back up the beach, settling down into their little dirt clearing again. At this point Dean could feel the hunger begin to grow in the pits of his stomach. He hadn’t eaten a full meal since before he boarded the helicopter.
Dean turned to look at the rocky mountain that loomed over the rest of the island. It probably wasn’t even that tall, but it was steep and intimidating (especially if you haven’t been eating or sleeping properly).
Despite how hard he tried to ignore it, his eyes kept flicking towards the blood dripping into the pale sand. It wasn’t pretty, the flesh all cut away and split- dark red liquid sliding down the side of his face. Dean didn’t have to check for a pulse to know that Cas was still alive, he could see his chest rising and falling with every shaky breath.
He should have been lying just on the other side of the clearing, his back towards Dean and the ocean. He should have had his arms tucked under his head, accompanied by his jacket and the bloody shirt he never gave back. He should have been there, but he wasn’t. His jacket was there, but he wasn’t.
But at the end of the day, it didn’t matter. As the rain fell outside, bouncing off of the trees and burrowing in the dirt, nothing mattered. They were on the same playing field. Both Dean and Cas were shoved inside a cave on an island in the middle of nowhere, neither sure if anyone was looking for them, without any clue on how to survive.
Satisfied with his findings, Dean began to march back in the direction of their camp. “Camp” was a rather generous word in this situation. It wasn’t even a camp- it was just the area where Cas was. So he wasn’t heading back to camp, he was heading back to Cas.
Dean eventually got to his feet and dusted the sand from his pants. He knew he had to go back to the campsite eventually, especially because he left his bag over there, but he would be damned if he wasn’t going to try and prolong it as much as possible.
They didn’t speak for the rest of the movie, although that could have been due to the fact that Castiel fell asleep about halfway through. Dean only realized it when Cas’s head fell against his chest and his hand slipped out from his grip.
Dean watched nervously as she punched in the numbers and twirled the phone cord around her finger. Dean could hear the line ringing and he waited, he prayed, that the person on the other end would pick up.
It wasn’t until they started spinning that Dean really had the urge to throw up. The storm was tossing their helicopter around like the ragdoll, sending them spinning in circles as they headed towards the ground.
They mutually decided that it would be best if they headed back to the beach. Despite the shelter and protection the cave and trees provided them, Dean was growing ansty being hidden away so well. He needed to be able to see the sky. Needed to be able to signal a plane. Needed to get out of here.
When Dean arrived back at their camp he would be lying if he said he wasn’t relieved that Castiel was still there.
The first thing Dean noticed was the large white bandage wrapped around the side of Cas’s head, covering where the wound had been. He was propped up in the bed with a newspaper clutched loosely in his hands.
Dean opened his eyes and looked out the window, seeing nothing but grey clouds. The wall of rain was on the other side of the storm, blue and purple toned lightning crackling through the distant clouds.
” Dean snarled. He whipped around and grabbed Cas by the collar of his shirt, yanking him close. “You know
Cas came staggered around the front of the helicopter, his headset still on and his coat clutched in one of his hands while the other was pressed against the side of his head. Dean rushed over and grabbed by the arm, yanking himself and the pilot away from the crash just as he watched the wreckage burst into flames.
Dean tipped out his bag and watched the contents spill onto the ground. He didn’t have much with him. His bathing suit, a cheap souvenir, some personal items, an old granola bar and- Dean scoffed as he scooped up the square Zippo lighter. He held it up so Cas could see, flicking the top open and producing a small flame.
Sam shook his head and pushed back his dark hair. “Nothing too much. You’ve been all over the news, though. What the hell happened out there?”
Without any sort of warning there was suddenly a body crashing down on top of him, knocking Dean down into the dirt. When he looked up he realized it was Cas, or at least a clearly sleep-deprived version of him. He was mumbling quickly, stringing together words at a rate much quicker than what Dean was capable of comprehending.
He was filled with so much adrenaline that it felt like his tired body was being controlled by a puppeteer who had him on strings. It all felt like a dream to him. It all felt so distant and euphoric; it just couldn’t be real.
“If I come sit over there are you going to bash my skull in?” Dean joked, already getting to his feet. He walked around the fire, careful not to trip over any stray logs, and took a seat against a tree not too far from where Cas was.
Dean hadn’t actually thought about that. It wasn’t like he had a fishing rod on standby. “I’ll whittle a spear,” he said proudly.
Castiel shot him a warm smile- one that would make Dean believe that everything was okay. “I didn’t mean to. Just a bad dream.”
“I’m thankful you wanted to help,” Dean said. He couldn’t let the silence drag on for any longer. “Not many people want to help just for the hell of it.”
He was thinking about Sammy- not only having to deal with their father but now Dean too. Poor kid must think he’s all alone in the world. He was thinking about Charlie as well, who was probably running frantic back at the resort. She would probably skip her business meeting and instead be on a search and rescue chopper. Or maybe she wouldn’t be. Did she even know? Or did everyone still think Dean was en route to America?
“We’re here!” He couldn’t help but shout. If the helicopter pilots hadn’t seen their smoke signal or the giant SOS they had written in the sand, he doubts shouting would have done them much good.
Dean crouched down and took a look at Cas’ ankle, which was red and swollen. He let out a heavy sigh and smiled up at Cas.
“I- I don’t know, Dean,” Cas admitted. “Your energy is so strong and loud- you’re screaming out for help. You’re starving.”
They pulled apart briefly and Cas cupped the sides of Dean’s face, their foreheads pressed together.
Castiel shook his head. “No, Dean. The only one in here is me. Well, I guess you too, now. I’m okay, though.”
By the time Dean heard a knock at his door, it was far past dinner and he had switched from Dr. Sexy to watching whatever movie he had on DVD. He had a rather extensive collection and he knew that he shouldn’t be wasting his laptop power like this, but he couldn’t help it. He was bored.
“I guess… nevermind,” Cas shook his head and got to his feet, his eyes still looking off into the distance.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. “I thought you said you just wanted to become a pilot because you thought it was fun.”
The temperature was dropping fairly quickly. Too much time had passed and Sam had made no progress on fixing the generator. Dean had tried to help, but Sam had pushed him away and told him to let him have some room- something about his big nerd ego probably.
Dean could see Charlie eyeing the helicopter. He couldn’t quite read her expression, but he was sure it was something along the lines of
Dean could hear Cas begin to start another sentence but he hung up the phone before any real words could be heard. Dean knew it was childish, but he didn’t care. Castiel had been disappearing at random for the past few months and every time Dean tried to confront him about it, he would disappear or dodge the question.
The island fell quiet. Dean could have sworn the birds stopped screeching and insects stopped chirping; it was like when a teacher starts to yell at a student and the whole class goes silent. It was unsettling. Dean knew that if he kept pushing he was bound to get a reaction, but was it really so hard for Cas to admit that he wasn’t quite right at the moment? They survived a helicopter crash, for fucks sake. Usually, people walk away with a little more than a banged-up head- if they even got to walk away.
Dean draped his forearm across his eyes, trying to shield himself from the sun. He let out a grown and tried to mumble the words “I’m tired”, but it came out as an unintelligible groan.
“Local helicopter pilot,” Gabriel had produced an apple and was sinking his teeth into it, chewing as he finished his statement. Dean couldn’t stomach the idea of food right now. “He was practically born to fly- I mean, a real natural. Loves to show off in that stupid junker he keeps down by the docks. Little cocky if you ask me.”
Dean looked up from the safety of his bench to see Charlie jogging down the boardwalk, a popsicle in each hand. She strolled up alongside Dean and held out one of her hands, waiting for Dean to take the frozen treat.
Dean almost smiled. “Just a bit sore. I’ll pro’lly develop some nasty bruises, though.” Dean looked back at Cas’s head wound. “We’re going to need to patch you up before we do anything.”
Castiel chuckled softly and placed one of his hands on the side of the helicopter as if it was a large black stallion rather than a well oiled machine. “Nervous flier?”
Although Dean was never one for the waiting game. He leaned forwards and paused the movie, prompting Cas to let out a heavy sigh.
Jo sighed, her chest heaving with exaggeration. She shot daggers in Gabriel’s direction, who shook his head and grinned in response.
They didn’t exchange any other words for the rest of the night. They just went through the motions; eating what they could and trying to quench their thirst. They sat in a comfortable silence as they waited for the fire to die down. The flames grew smaller and smaller, much like the hope that Dean cradled so closely. They had been there for too long; they were surely on their own by now. Someone must have called off the search.
Dean could already feel his back beginning to ache and his legs begin to fall asleep, but he knew better than to move. Instead, he reached over- careful not to wake Cas- and turned the lamp off. He clicked the TV off and tossed the remote to the side.
Cas pressed into Dean, hot breath leaking from the inside of his mouth. It wasn’t like any kiss Dean had experienced before, this time it was angry. It was so, so angry and he could practically feel the red, hot emotion in every move Cas’s mouth made. Dean was supposed to be pissed at this guy; why did the kiss feel so good? He didn’t want to pull away, in fact, he dragged it out as long as possible. He tugged at the bottom of Cas’s lip and it was only after a low groan escaped the back of Dean’s throat did he finally will himself to pull away.
The flight should barely last two hours. Two hours was nothing. Two hours was like listening to the Master of Puppets album twice. He could survive two hours.
Dean stumbled away from the desk, earning a confused gesture from Jo, and took a seat in one of the plush chairs shoved against the pale wall. The lobby wasn’t very big, but it was proportionate to the rest of the resort. It was quaint. Relaxing. Or at least it was supposed to be.
Or maybe he could. Maybe Castiel was reckless and he knew the risks of going out in the storm but decided to fly anyway. Maybe he was an awful person who stole from tourists and exchanged helicopter tours for other kinds of goods.
