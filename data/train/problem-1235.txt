He has other things with which to occupy himself: The Work; his intellect.
John goes very still. Breathe, he thinks, as pictures flood his mind: A broken body, strangely distorted, dark wool soaked in bright red blood that quickly oxidised into a rusty viscous liquid when coming into contact with air.; a copper smell suddenly filling his nostrils. John nearly gags. “I had to watch you jump off a building. You were lying in a puddle of blood on the pavement... It was everywhere. You had no pulse...” John is unable to suppress the choking sound that escapes his mouth.
“Hey,” he offers by way of greeting after Sherlock had hung up his coat and hovers in the kitchen doorway.
“Don't.”
Sherlock shakes his head, remembering too late that this might not be a good idea. He has to close his eyes and swallow hard but then his knees buckle and threaten to give out and John has no choice but to grab the flailing body in front of him. andHe holds him close, as he more or less drags Sherlock over into the kitchen where he deposits his wasted friend on a chair.
“Seriously? Your great-uncle… What do you know about him... and this John?”
I had nice links to everything above but somehow I can't post them here, sorry!
“Sure it is.” Greg smiles. “How are things?”
“I've no idea. It wasn't even in the economic section. Something about his marriage... I skipped it. I'm not particularly interested in other people's dirty linen being washed in public... Oi, Sherlock, I was reading that!”
“I think you'll find everything in the press reports.” Gibson peers over at the pages strewn all over the carpet. “But if there's anything you want me to clarify - well, here I am. Fire away.”
“Is there anything else?” He mumbles against William’s collar bone.
"No, I didn't. As far as I’m concerned, it's live and let live round here. Good day, young man!" And with that, she slams the door in Sherlock's furious face.
Sherlock frowns.
“Yeah?” John's voice is rough with desire.
“I'm not sure you are aware of the implications.”
Until one morning when they yell at each other because Sherlock complains about the lack of milk or something equally petty and John finally snaps because he feels so helpless in the face of this utter mess. The crockery suffers severe damage before Sherlock bolts from the kitchen and locks himself in the bathroom. John punches his fist against the door, bruising his knuckles. Just when he’s about to grab his Haversack and leave the flat, Sherlock and this whole pile of shit his life has become behind, he hears the latch being pushed back. Sherlock leans against the door frame, a syringe in one hand and a tourniquet around his upper arm, looking pensive. John walks back up to him, extending his palm, and Sherlock carefully hands over the needle.
“Oh, Sherlock, please, not again...”
“It's fine. I understand perfectly.”
The collected unsend letters from John Watson to Sherlock Holmes, wherever you may be, my love...
They are now well into their third round.
“I'd say so. Have you recognised his last name?”
“Think, John! This murder had struck me as rather stupid even at my first perfunctory reading of the news. We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it, one must suspect deception.”
“Then tell me, what happened?!” John has to know, even if he doesn’t want to.
Lestrade and Coventry look rather sheepish but nonetheless impressed. Gibson nods briskly at Sherlock, then steps towards him and pats his shoulder. His hands rest on Sherlock's lapels as both men lock eyes. Sherlock licks his lips, his pink tongue darting out briefly. Gibson nods again.
Next chapter is due in June 2016. We are already working on it.
“I'm not panicking.” Sherlock glares, but despite the scorn in his voice, his fists unclench and his chest heaves as he draws a deep breath.
“Oh, of course, the great Sherlock Holmes doesn't lower himself to the level of we, ordinary humans. You seriously think you need no one, do you? Who picks you up when you collapse in the bathroom, drugged to your eyeballs? Remind me, what was it last time, morphine or cocaine? Who feeds you up when you decide to stop eating until you look like an emaciated camp inmate? Who drags you up from the couch and puts you in the shower when you are drowning in self-pity during one of your black moods, failing to engage in even the most basic forms of social interaction? Who mops up your blood and vomit, tends to your injuries, and suffers your whims and tempers without saying one sodding word? It's me. It's always me!”
This chapter was kindly and thoroughly beta'd and britpicked by Lockedinjohnlock. She not only patiently amends my grammar and punctuation but is also a vital source on such diverse topics as ligature marks, pharmacology and anatomy.
John balls his left hand into a fist and brings it down hard on the floor. “God, please, no. No, no, no,” he murmurs, his voice rough with barely restrained fury.
John can feel Sherlock's erection through the thin cotton of his boxers and grinds his arse encouragingly against it. This elicits another moan from Sherlock, low and rather desperate.
He hasn't done this often. He believes there should be trust between two partners before taking this particular step, a trust that can't be established between two strangers in a grimy darkened alleyway.
He's on the verge of uttering something unforgivable affectionate when said man breaks his reverie by asking incredulously: “How complicated can it possibly be? It's simple biology. Insert part A in orifice B – and rut.”
“I haven't been drinking that heavily. I just had … Martini.” As the memory comes back to him, he has to press his fist against his mouth to stop himself from being sick right here at their kitchen table. John silently hands him their big salad bowl from the draining board, but Sherlock only eyes it in disgust then pushes it away. “We eat from that”, he says horrified.
“Still want to go slow?” Sherlock breathes against John's ear before nipping at the tender shell and John shivers. Sherlock continues to rub John's cock, his own erection thrusting between John's buttocks as Sherlock slowly rotates his hips.
Sicily is marvellous. I'm stationed at a hospital in Catania for the time being.
Sherlock is shockingly aware of John wanting him. In
This is something Sherlock had wanted to keep away from John at all costs. It reminds Sherlock of a time he doesn't want to revisit. Nor does he want to share his experiences with anyone, least of all the man he shares his life with.
John swallows. He’d been early for his shift. They always need Doctors at the hospital these days. John prefers being busy than sitting alone in his dingy room, staring at the peeling wallpaper, listening to Vera Lynn singing on the wireless in the kitchen of his landlady, until he wants to smash something.
“Jesus, Sherlock...” John feels his balls tighten but Sherlock must have sensed how close John is because he removes his fist from John's shaft, only to pull John's arse more effectively apart, now that he can use both his hands.
Mycroft's gaze sharpens, then shifts. “My brother won't leave London for as long as you are here. Therefore, I have to get you out of the country, so he will eventually cooperate. Believe me, the Army is much more preferable to a stretch in prison for gross indecency. You'll be a free man with no criminal record. Your career might even flourish. You get to do what you always wanted, serve your country, put your talents to good use.”
It had been a leap of faith, a plunge in the dark. To say Sherlock had been terrified would be the understatement of a lifetime. But - rather miraculously - everything had turned out fine, for John had somehow understood.
Sherlock's dream is qouting "Fire", a song by Fred Thomas.
John injects some lidocaine with steady hands, disinfects the wound (at which Sherlock inhales sharply), then stitches it up with expertise. Afterwards, he applies some antiseptic ointment and a gauze dressing.
“No, you just told me you weren't.” Sherlock had stalked over and unceremoniously taken the sheets from John's hands. Now he's furiously leafing through the broadsheet, crumpling the pages, carelessly tossing aside the whole sports section, the TV schedule and the feuilleton. “Now, where is it? Where
Sherlock's heart literally skips a beat and he nearly faints when he recognises the man in front of him. He's thinner, more tanned, his hair is shorter and bleached almost white – but it's obviously John Watson who is standing in this corridor of a run-down Italian hotel, wearing the greyish-blue uniform of the RAMC. The stripes on his cuffs identify him as a captain. He holds a satchel in his left hand as he stares up at Sherlock in the same mixture of shock, awe and bewilderment that must be visible on his own face.
“Did you want to leave me, then, for those two years?” The words stop Sherlock mid-motion.
Slightly appeased, Sherlock lets John relieve him of his coat. As John tries to untie his scarf, his fingers brush over Sherlock's throat. His skin is not hard and cold like the white marble it resembles, but delicately soft, warm and a bit damp from sweat.
It's weird to know that fellow English soldiers are dying a few hundred miles away while we are sitting here, sunbathing, whiling away our time. The boys are getting itchy, though. Fights are breaking out more and more often. But it's not just those violent outbursts that increase. I surprised two corporals who where really going at it in a tent – I didn't report them, but advised them to be more careful. What can you do – those lads are just seizing the day.
Indulging in these vivid mental pictures, John’s balls tighten and he bites down hard on his fist. His fingers blur flying on his cock and he's sweaty all over. Imagining Sherlock's pale naked body afterwards, trembling, glistening wet, makes his vision go fuzzy on the edges and then John sees himself licking up that long neck, tasting salty dampness there before pushing his tongue into
“Good?” He asks.
“Than you should know that petechiae can also be caused by vomiting, which I did excessively last night, if I remember correctly. Because I was rather drunk.”
John swiftly turns around and hurries to put the clothes onto their designated hook. Even in his inebriated state, Sherlock might be able to spot a hard-on if it pokes him in the thigh.
“Speaking of him... did you know that he lied to me back in London? That he told me it would be about six months...,” John tries not to sound too bitter but can't continue for the fear of his fury showing.
“I was about to say that what we’ve both witnessed on that screen is exactly what I want you to do to me on a daily basis. Preferably twice.”
Yet, after all those hazy weeks of summer, Sherlock is still a marvel to John. His breath-taking beauty sends John reeling whenever he sets eyes on him. The sunlight exposes brunette streaks in his silky black curls. His pale skin is almost translucent, pulled taught over fine bones and lean muscles. Sherlock's eyes are a peculiar silvery grey-green John has yet to get tired of gazing into. And his voice... John can listen to Sherlock's deep, velvety baritone for hours, watching his expressive pink lips with rapt attention (and if he evokes images of those lips stretched around his cock, or shining wet and open, panting his name, well, John is just human, after all). That this otherworldly, fascinating, gorguous man wants him – John H. Watson, a doctor of medium height, mediocre income, questionable taste and quite insubstantial funds – is a mystery to John, but he's wise enough not to question his luck too thoroughly.
Tension rises and John meets someone. Sherlock - despite his fears and doubts - nevertheless strongly disapproves...
“What is it?” John moves over next to him, leaning over Williams shoulder.
“I inherited it. The whole building. I'd just come back from the US and needed a place to stay, and suddenly I owned a house in central London. I offered Mrs Hudson the downstairs flat and moved in here.” William explains. He knows it sounds blasé but that is what had happened.
This leads to some sour lamenting of the whims of middle-aged suburban housewives with too much time on their hands (
John lightly brushes his thumb over the crease between Sherlock's prominent eyebrows. “Hey, I mean it. Breathe. It's all fine. I haven't done this either. Not with a bloke, that is. I promise, if you don't panic, I won't panic.”
But shouldn't he be relieved? John chasing after a skirt means he's not lusting after Sherlock – at least for the time being. Or could Sherlock probably been mistaken? After all, this is not his area...
“But I got carried away. That was nothing like... well, like we normally do it.” John is blushing a bright crimson, a colour clashing offensively with the maroon of his cardigan.
“Yes, come on. Harder. Give it to me. I need it. I need your cock. Fuck me!” He moans, and doesn't care that he might sound ridiculous. Usually, Sherlock Holmes would never indulge in dirty talk, being too insecure and embarrassed but hiding that behind an aloof, arrogant facade, even in bed. Apparently, Scott doesn't have such qualms. The man paying him might as well benefit from his best performance. Suddenly, it's easy letting go.
“Yes, John. Faster. Please. Touch me. God, your cock. It's so big. Oh god...”
William shrugs. “It was never posted. Look, no stamp.”
I love you, Sherlock. I always loved you and I always will. I’m sure we’ll meet again, my beautiful boy.
“John, you are making no sense whatsoever. What has a grocer's daughter to do with your language skills?”
“Ok, then we'll get all the stuff down to Oxfam, shall we?”
“No, I do. I've never seen you eating salad,” John retorts.
Somehow, they’ll get by.
My love,
John shifts in his chair. “What?” he asks, sounding slightly confused.
John looks around, his gaze wild and confused, before grabbing the next firm surface within reach. Clinging to the table top he sinks down onto a chair but avoids meeting Sherlock's eyes.
It's eventually getting spring. My cough is a little better, but now my leg hurts again. I'm a wreck. Yet I don't want to complain. Having seen what I saw, I have to say I'm lucky. Only, I'm so hungry all the time. I can't sleep because my stomach hurts. Let's hope that March will bring some improvement of our situation. When we can't sleep, we tell each other what we will eat when we get back home. I dream of very simple stuff: bread and butter pudding, carrot cake with thick, sweet icing, hot cross buns with melted butter, an orange. I have to stop now, I'm starting to feel dizzy.
It was the only picture that existed of the two of them together.
And then John Watson has an idea.
Then one of Sherlock's shallow thrusts suddenly hits the sweet spot inside him and John almost arches off the bed.
Ahead lies another weekend with Walter. He wants to go to the seaside. Irene gave me a few useful tips how she manages to zone out during the act. She also suggested to get him sloshed. That should be easy. Professional advice is always highly appreciated.
Afterwards, he briskly showered – vigorously avoiding succumbing to yesterday’s indulgence - then got dressed meticulously in a tight purple shirt and slim black suit he knew John rather fancied before walking the short distance over to Angelo's.
William looks up from the piece of paper obviously torn from a notepad.
The man who calls himself Victor is not only good with his mouth – he's exceptional. John is hard in no time, thrusting into the wet hole deeper and deeper while his slut opens his throat and takes it. He has to stop after a few minutes; otherwise, it would have been over way too soon – especially regarding the amount of money he'd paid.
“Aren't there any more letters?” John asks.
“Was that yet another quote?” Sherlock asks warily. “Honestly, don't you think you should fill your head with something a bit more useful?”
John has to leave early the next day as well, as it is his usual early roster at the surgery. He writes a short note to Sherlock, who's still fast asleep and leaves it on the kitchen table.
, John. You know I can be very convincing. Even back then. And I needed proof. Evidence. A sample!” Sherlock attempts to hide behind a façade of passive indifference but unconsciously gives himself away, for his knuckles have turned white as he tightly grips his legs to stay grounded.
“God, you … you freak! You can't even admit it! Are you seriously that desperate for attention? Am I not entitled to some personal space, a private life of my own? Just because you don't let anyone near you doesn't mean I have to spend my days lonely like you, or worse, lurking in the shadow of the great detective, fobbed off with mere crumbs, running after you and admiring you, playing dumb so you can shine all the brighter. This is sick, Sherlock, this is perverted and troubling and I won't allow this any longer!”
“Do you mind if we…?” John makes a vague gesture. “Take a closer look.”
John abruptly lets go of the shagged-out beauty that somehow has found the way into his bed. Sherlock turns around and catches him before he hits the floor. John holds onto Sherlock's biceps, realising too late that his hand is still smeared with lube and come.
“What? What is it? Do you know who those people are?”
No, the truth is that John has no idea how to address what troubles Sherlock. He is clearly a haunted man but John feels rather ill equipped to give him advice or offer condolence. Whatever had happened when Sherlock had been... away, it surely left its mark. And John isn't ready to deal with the fallout just yet, when everything is still so raw and fresh.
James was severely injured, not sure if he'll make it through the night. He let a raiding patrol but when they advanced they got under fire. He's the only survivor. I pray for him. That's all I can do.
“You really liked him, didn't you? Major Sholto? James.” Sherlock asks as John has put the last page aside. His chin is resting on the back of his hand which is placed in the middle of John's chest. Despite the lack of sleep, his eyes are clear and bright, reflecting the colour of the cerulean Italian sky.
The face looking up at John is almost ethereal, the most striking feature the almond-shaped eyes the colour of mother of pearl. High cheekbones, a hawklike nose and a pointed chin are framed by a mass of unruly black curls. Full, curved lips suck seductively on the cigarette, and most of John's blood rushes south, tightening his trousers.
And of course thanks to Lockedinjohnlock, who patiently beta'd my scribblings and kicked me to come up with a more fitting ending; because when I began to write this story I had another ending in mind. I'm glad I was made to change route...
His body is experiencing the odd sensation of remembering how good it felt to be touched, kissed. John just stands there, lost in memories. He suddenly so badly wants to experience those sensations again that he can barely breathe.
“It's ok. It's all right,” John murmurs encouraging, but suddenly Sherlock pushes back, violently, finally freeing himself from John's grip, panting hard. John lets go of him until there are again a few inches of safe distance between them.
---------
These thoughts make me a little sad, too, therefore I stop now.
, god, those words! It's like a their very own language...). It's sickening, listening to him, talking about the city as if it already belongs to him. Luckily, he got so wasted he couldn’t get it up.
The moment passes, like everything else. John stares at his hand and the crushed piece of paper.
“Don't get your hopes up, John.”
“It's a death certificate.” William pales a little as he hands the form over to John, who reads it with raised eyebrows. “What is it? What does it say?”
“Don't give me that bullshit, Sherlock.” As John finally turns around to face Sherlock, he's very pale, with a greenish touch to his features; sweat is beading at his hairline, darkening his fringe. He looks as if he has aged ten years in the last ten minutes.
So John tells Sherlock, “God, Sherlock, fuck me!”
“Oh!”
It'll be fine.
“I didn't punch you.”
“Patience you must have, my young padawan,” John mumbles and the look of utter incomprehension he receives from Sherlock is priceless. “Star Wars?” he offers but that doesn't sit well with Sherlock, who just rolls his eyes and huffs in annoyance: “Really, John, for a grown up man, you can be remarkable childish.”
matters?”
“Because you... left me. I was so alone, afterwards...” John can't go on. He isn't yet ready to tell Sherlock about the black months he'd spent staring at the barrel of his gun, weighing it in his hand. He has no memory of the funeral. All he remembers is throwing a few things into a holdall and leaving Baker Street in the middle of the night. He'd stayed at a hotel for a few days until he'd found an anonymous bedsit in Croyden.
Suddenly, the man is much closer, crowding him in against the metal shutter, hovering over him. John can smell tobacco, damp wool and expensive soap. He should push this bloke away and be done with it, but he doesn’t.
What Witold tells me is unbelievable. I'm sure he's lying to secure a passage to England. This is impossible.
“Ok, enough for the moment.” John suddenly, only wants to get out of Sherlock's room. He needs some air, a coffee and a hot shower before he feels equipped to deal with … whatever it is that has actually happened here. “Lie down. Rest. You got a bit hypothermic, spending the night on the living room floor. I'll see to you later. Get you a tea or … something.”
“This country needs my brother. A situation has arisen... it's very important that he works for us.”
John exhales through his nose, pent up tension leaving his body. His hand comes up and rakes through Sherlock's curls, resting on the back of his head. They kiss, careful at first, exploratory, before their mouths become bolder, their tongues pushing in deeper. Sherlock is a rather good kisser – well, what is the man actually bad at, apart from social niceties? Even if he hasn't done this before (not even snogging? John can't believe this, but then, it's Sherlock “alone protects me” Holmes), he's nothing if not quick on the uptake.
“It's in my own shorthand. I'm afraid I'll have to read it to you.”
Sherlock needs a moment to process the question. He hadn't thought about actually charging John. Isn't their little game over? Apparently not. Well, what might he'd been worth? Finally, he says: “250 quid.” He has no idea if this is too much or if he's seriously undercharging John but hopes that John won't know either. He makes a mental note to check out escort's rates for various services provided for future reference.
I hope you are still alive. But somehow, I'm sure you are.
Nothing from Mycroft.
John knows that's a blatant lie. He can hardly suppress the urge to smash something, preferably a piece of furniture that would splinter with some noise.
At first, John is too surprised to answer. Then he says the first thing that pops into his head: “Why bother? I'd thought you don't need to sleep...”, before realising that this has probably been the most stupid thing ever to escape his mouth. He shuts up but it's too late; Sherlock has already turned on his heels and is storming down the stairs.
It’s not like it had been before but it’s slowly getting a little bit better.
His musings are interrupted by Sherlock stumbling into their sitting room and if John had ever thought that it would be fun to see his flatmate off his face, thereby losing his ability to come across as elegant, even when up to his elbows in stomach content or pig intestines, he's about to discover that the opposite is true: Sherlock is so unlike his … well, for a lack of a better term, let’s say … normal self that it's unsettling and quite disturbing.
Sherlock had craved some sort of sensory input to quieten the noise – just a little distraction, to give him some rest. At least three different scalpels were still lying on the kitchen table. He had got to his feet and walked over there, picked up a Number 11 blade and watched the light play on the slim silver knife. Elegant. Beautiful. If he pressed it against his skin, it would smoothly cut. He'd barely have to apply pressure. Sherlock had imagined a few swift strokes at tender flesh. But in the end he abstained; he’d been aware that the relief would be short-lived while the repugnance – enhanced by John's pity and disgust when he found out – would prevail, calling for ever more escalating measures the next time.
“Turn on your side, face the wall.” He huffs. As Sherlock hesitates, John explains: “No, I'm not going to put my cock into you just like that, Sherlock.” As Sherlock just stares at him, doubtful, John feels something aching in his chest. “Don't worry.” He reassures Sherlock, brushing an errant curl from his forehead. “I promise.”
should do something about it. It looks... actually painful.”
“Like what you see?” John's rough and husky voice hits Sherlock low in his stomach. He forces himself to take his eyes from John's cock and raise them to his face. There's a bead of sweat on John's brow and upper lip and his pupils are blown wide, his usually light blue eyes now an intense deep violet.
Thank you for staying with me! Next update is due by the end of April.
The kissing afterwards was disconcerting but unavoidable.
and neither a
When he loosens his grip and removes his fingers, Sherlock still looks at him, cocking his head slightly and his cheeks flush a little, before he lowers his eyes down to the display and starts typing furiously.
Instead of answering, Sherlock finally can't hold his drink any longer– or whatever else he's consumed over the past evening – and starts retching. Luckily, he makes it over to the sink, clinging to it as his body shakes and cramps with wave after wave of nausea. John holds him upright as best he can, catching him around the middle, stroking his hair from his face, murmuring soothingly.
Of course, Sherlock is proven right. Two hours later, a much calmer Neil Gibson sits again in their living room – this time properly in the client's chair – and tells his story:
John dabs at his lip until the bleeding slows. Then he strides past Sherlock into the bathroom to inspect the damage. Sherlock trails behind.
John has been reading the papers, not really paying attention what Sherlock is up to on his laptop. After all, he has this strange case on in which two German tourists seem to play a vital role. Therefore, it's no surprise that Sherlock, vain git that he is, wants to brush up his language skills to be able to interrogate said tourists in their mother tongue. That's why John had thought nothing of it as snippets of a conversation in a foreign language filled their living room. It had been filled with worse (toxic fumes and deadly assassins among them).
Our picture from Brighton is fading due to the bright sun.
He knows there'll be dark days ahead. Days filled with yelling and shouting. Silent days. But no more lonely days.
John's hands stroke Sherlock's hair, his back and it makes him nauseous. He wants to cry. Why? The smack should have made him numb, absorbing him in balls of soft cotton wool, draining all the loathing out if him, remove him to a state of untouchable reverie. So why can't his ridiculously attached flatmate just go away?
“Yes?” Sherlock's voice is low and carefully void of any emotion.
But if he hadn’t wanted John to kiss him, why did he feel such loss? Shouldn't he be glad? He doesn't even like to be touched. He certainly doesn't want physical intimacy from his flatmate. Even though...
William shows it to John who just shrugs.
Sherlock tilts his head forward and lets his brow rest against the dark wood, closing his eyes. He exhales sharply through his nose as not to sigh. His left hand is still on the handle, while the fingertips of his right hand just barely touch the door frame, hovering there.
What the hell just happened?
“Obviously not!”
Sherlock still doesn't so much as bat an eyelid. John is very aware of his flatmate’s stillness, because the light from the eyepiece illuminates the upper half of his etheral face, his eyes shining almost turquoise.
“Your tastes are abominable.”
The words hit Sherlock harder than any abuse. If there's anything worse than invective, it's pity. Finally, anger rouses Sherlock from his numbness.
“John, please...” Sherlock is acutely aware how helpless he sounds.
The skag should have worked its magic by now. So why is he still lingering on this rather unpleasant topic?
Sometimes, I hate my work from the bottom of my heart
As far as he knows, the mysterious beauty could be a stalker, an unhinged fan, some snoopy journalist, or perhaps an agent of Moriarty's. And even if she's just some sort of romantic interest, as a good friend, Sherlock should save John from the perils he always gets himself into with affairs of the heart. He thinks of Sarah or the boring teacher he met at Christmas, who's name he's instantly forgotten and remembers John's mood after they dumped him: he'd been irritable, melancholic, absent-minded – in short, useless but rather strenuous.
“When we're back home I'll die my hair all the colours of the rainbow if it pleases you.” Sherlock grins back.
But no matter how fast he moves, John is up and behind him just in time to press his hands firmly against the door, detaining Sherlock from rushing out of the room.
His eyes stare at the spot where he and the stranger had stood last evening, making out. It had all started so promising, yet it had been over before it really began. Story of his life, it seems. Like his military career. Like his marriage. John sighs again, than takes out the rubbish he’s been fiddling with to throw it away. It’s a piece of paper torn from a cigarette package, Balkan Sobrarie, smelling richly of tobacco. John frowns. He doesn’t smoke… yet the smell takes him back to last night. He hesitates with the scrap piece of paper in his hand, slowly brings it close to his face and inhales.
My fellow passengers have been worried about German submarine attacks – but up until now we've been lucky and escaped them. We'll reach Port Said tomorrow. Finally! I've never been to another country, and now I'm going to Egypt! I'm so excited. Perhaps I'll see the pyramids. I could do with firm ground beneath my feet again.
I miss you. I desperately want to touch you. Instead, I push my hand inside my drawers and have a sad wank now and then when I'm alone in my tent. Others are not so discreet, I'm afraid. The things I've seen since my arrival... I tell you all about it back in London. Some boys have contracted rather nasty pubic lice from the brothels they've visited in Cairo or Alexandria. Now they literally have an itch. They blush and stutter when they come to see me, it's almost endearing.
I'm in Rome. I remember the city from before the war, but it’s still magnificent and beautiful. I'm walking through the ruins of a much grander empire that wasn’t to last. History is ubiquitous. I'd like to take you back here when this war is over and show you all the breathtaking testimonials of a vanished civilisation. It puts things into perspective.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No. It was just very unpleasant. In general. Not because of the things he actually did.”
“Are you hurt, dear?” Their landlady steps closer as John moves to the side (only slightly annoyed by Sherlock's objection to his attendance). As Mrs Hudson becomes aware of the damage to Sherlock's face, she puts a hand to her mouth before sighing sympathetically. “Oh, my! I hope you gave as good as you got.”
“This is not about the sex. It's about the language. What might
They are both silent, muted by all the unspoken accusations hanging between them, making the atmosphere thick and charged with helpless wrath. John's eyes burn. Sherlock's lips are pressed into a tight, straight line.
“Jesus, Will. Have you seen those pictures he writes about?”
Thank you all for reading, subscribing, commenting and kudoing!
“Stop that.”
As Sherlock stirs and pulls his hands away he blinks a few times, then coughs.
“God, yes, yes... do that again. Do it!”
“I was never
Sherlock's fist crushes against John's jaw with surprising force and accuracy, splitting the upper lip and loosening at least one canine. John tumbles backwards, shocked.
“Self-medication. Now, if you could just fuck off, I might be able to go to sleep.”
“John... John! The water is getting cold and I can't feel my posterior anymore.”
Eventually, John stops. Against a darkened brick wall leans the tall, thin frame of a young man, hollowing his cheeks while sucking on a cigarette, the orange glow illuminating a strange, long face that seems to have been drawn by one of those expressionist painters that hang on the walls in John's Upper Eastside apartment: all angles and shadows, huge eyes, sharp cheekbones, full lips and tussled hair. He's wearing the usual tight black trousers while his shirt is unbuttoned almost down to his navel, exposing white, hairless skin.
I wish we could be for real, though. I would marry you any day, worship you, love you, in good times and bad, till death do us part.
If he would be honest with himself, he’d have to confess that, deep down, he knows it's wrong. You shouldn’t fantasise this way about your flatmate, the man you share your living space with. It's unhealthy and invasive. Well, at least it would be if Sherlock knew. Or would it? Perhaps he wants it as badly as John.
John's not sure.
John grabs his wrist and Sherlock stills. “Wait.”
“I'm ready. God, Sherlock, I'm so ready. Now get on with it...,” he begs.
John senses he has to tread very carefully. “A friend of yours?”
William throws the Union Jack pillow at his lover's head as an answer before rummaging through the box again.
Greg shakes his head. “Listen, mate, I don’t know how things stand between you. Just… ask him, okay?”
John goes back into the hall; Sherlock's Belstaff still hangs on its hook. He seldom leaves the flat these days anyway... another point not to be considered too closely right now.
“John, I'm not what you want. I'm really not.”
“I love your take at foreplay.”
John grins. “I should hope so.”
“Seriously? Wow.”
Sherlock’s head snaps up. Their eyes meet. He just nods. “You can tie me up as well if you like.” He whispers.
“Why did you decide against returning home?” He asks eventually trying to sound as casual as possible.
Apply manual stimulation by mutually massaging our genitals? John might have liked that, going by what had happened yesterday. Or would that be too trite? Should Sherlock blandly offer full-on anal penetration? But that might be too much too soon. John had told Sherlock he’d never done anything like this with a man so far.
“Nonsense. You look rather tense. Come on.” Sherlock strides off down a corridor. At its end, there's a door to a large bathroom equipped with a claw footed tub. Hot water is already running as John enters.
“Sorry?” John drops out of his presumed role of bad cop. Even after nearly a year, Sherlock's ability to read his mind still astonishes him.
“But not now, please. Not now.” Sherlock's head drops onto John's shoulder as his hands come up around John's waist.
John lies back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling until he trusts his voice to come out steady. “Do you know who lived here before you?”
They say no man is an island. I beg to differ.
“That’s prescription only. Who, in god’s name, would prescribe you…” He’s cut short by Sherlock almost bouncing off the sofa, striding over the low table and stalking off to his bedroom, slamming the door shut.
“Are you telling me that you tried to seduce a paedophile? As a 13 year old boy? Jesus, Sherlock, even you can't be that daft!”
William has the courtesy to wipe his nose on the sleeve of his dressing gown before attempting to kiss John. It’s gentle, exploring, a little bit like their very first kiss. Yet the promise is unmistakable.
“Sorry, Sherlock, I don't get it. Who's dead? What happened?” John enquires, conceding defeat.
Only then does Sherlock untangle their fingers, again closing his right hand around John's leaking cock, giving it a few loose strokes. John braces himself on both his arms as he wonders what might happen next.
Moriarty stared at Holmes’s grimace and pursed his lips. “Yeah, maybe LSD wasn’t the best idea.”
One last thing.
He turned just in time to catch Watson’s eye before he hid behind the newspaper.
Jake how dare you call yourself a detective and not know who Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are. You should be ashamed. Shame upon you and your family. Shaaaame.
Molly was curious to know what Sherlock had done, but it very quickly didn’t matter anymore when she heard John moan as if the sound had been pulled from deep inside her.
“You’re just good as new?” John considered Sherlock’s health more important than trying to hide his sixth sense. “What do these things do anyway?” John held up the tags in his hand.
Holmes shook his head and covered Watson’s hand with his own. “They’re offering you the deal because they know I won’t be able to say no if you’re the one asking me.”
Thank you. I think?
How long have you two been together?
As soon as Stamford adjourned the meeting, everyone started discussing what to wear and quickly made their way out to get ready. Watson caught Holmes’s attention while Wiggins and Murray were cornering him.
Still waiting for that explanation.
Sherlock frowned. “As in?”
It was a knock on the door twenty minutes later that woke Watson. Ms Hooper put aside her copy of the script and slowly stood to get the door, giving Watson enough time to make himself decent.
“I need more time.” Sherlock answered. John could hear the frustration in his voice.
“About a week ago, right after he came back from his last trip. He barely dropped his luggage; he was already picking them up to leave with her.”
John couldn’t believe what he was hearing, and his partner’s careless tone wasn’t helping. “Are you listening to yourself? How is that better than killing? Its torture, you’re trapping them inside a bronze coffin, alive and conscious. What is wrong with you?”
Not what?
Wiggins frowned, confused. “You had no clue until now.”
Come on lovebirds, we’ve got a plane to catch.
He turned to face Sherlock, pursed his lips and waited.
“That’s what makes it fun. You remember fun, don’t you?” She said as her eyes caught something on the table. “Hum, what’s this? I guess you do remember fun.” She lifted the riding crop Manning had left behind. Sherlock scoffed and stood, his chin up, hiding his discomfort. He stretched out his hand, waiting for her to hand it to him.
“Finally. It took them long enough.” Holmes held out his hand for the paperwork.
What’s going on?
“Let’s just say this is me trying not to be bored.” Holmes replied with his American accent and winked.
“Well, if James is here, that means… yes, there she is.” Ms Adler grabbed Holmes’ jacket sleeve and pulled him closer. “That’s Kim Novak. She’s coming back from the bogs--probably went there for a line or two.”
“One case.” John looked at Mycroft, waiting for more, but nothing came.
It was around eleven pm when they parked in front of the bridge.
“Well, the LAPD contacted me a few times while you were editing with Wilder and, well, it’s not the Yard, but it’s a new crime demographic, it could possibly be worth exploring a bit it.”
John runs to Sherlock and takes him from Jake.
Sherlock noticed John stare.
“You really think I’m going to surrender so easily?”
Watson pursed his lips and looked away.
“A four?”
“Try me.” Watson said as he searched the man. He came up with what looked like a mobile, though not a model he had seen before, sealable plastic bags and what seemed to be a large pocket watch. He pocketed the items, despite the man’s protests, and put his earpiece back on. “Suspect neutralized in a room north of where we were attacked. Moving back to the team with suspect. Over.”
“I mean, the type of knot, this is all wrong for a bondage scene. It’s done too tight, cutting off circulation, which is why her hands are blueish.” John rubbed his wrists as he spoke. “And she wasn’t given any slack. She could barely move her arms and legs, just spread out, defenceless.” His tone was full of disgust. “These aren’t made to be undone, you have to cut the rope, and I haven’t seen any picture of scissors or a knife.”
“Just, trust me, ok?”
Holmes shuffled through the script in his hands. “So… which character am I playing?”
“Places everyone!” Ms Hawkins called through the bullhorn.
“So you don’t want a plate?” Watson tasted the sauce and hummed.
Santiago?
She shook her head and hummed her contempt. “I would, but not here.”
How could you?
Watson smiled and patted him on the back. “Yes Stamford, it’s over.”
“Officially, K-39 triple-Z. But I like to think of it as the world’s attic.”
“Because it’s almost midnight and I’m about to eat the dinner I did not have this evening.” Who did Holmes think he was, barging it at this hour demanding keys?
“You’re doing so good, Sherlock.”
“So that’s why I’m here? To look after you? Like a fucking
Lestrade shook his head. “I need the proper paperwork to support that claim. You know all this.”
? I didn’t steal it. I told you I wasn’t leaving without it.”
“Not by screaming as if we were under attack.” John opened his eyes when he heard Sherlock sigh.
“He goes by Hank.” John cleared his throat. “I don’t know his real name. But June probably does.”
They finally rounded the last corner and drove up to the entrance of the Diogenes Club. The senior agent threw money at the driver and opened his door before they had even come to a full stop. Pushing back the feeling of impending doom, John jogged to catch up.
BOYLE
Ms Adler stepped out of her dressing room, but it seemed more accurate to describe it as an entrance on set; the dress fitted to her body as if it were painted on, the fabric falling loosely around her hips, flowing to the floor. Every sequin catching in the light. The overall effect made such an impression that the room fell silent.
Holmes tried to hide his apprehension. The perspective of going back to his Sigerson persona after a two week break and spending another evening of inane chit chat was torture. But it meant a great deal to Watson, which made it worth the effort.
“What? No. If we can figure out if she’s lying or not, then we can confirm someone has in fact tampered with the GPS.” John protested quickly, cursing himself as he did so. By the way Sherlock was looking at him now, it was clear he wasn’t buying it either. “What, uh, what happened between the two of you?”
Two years.
Holt punches the air.
Holt sits down in the nearest chair.
“As in?” John prompted sarcastically.
He said 'I have to go'.
“And it makes him too worried to pay attention to what we’re filming. Morgan clearly doesn’t care about anything other than his own performance on set. And the rest of the crew, well, it’s nice to have an audience, but they’re not… When you’re there, you’re watching your creation come to life. I can’t begin to imagine how that must be, but when you’re watching it’s... inspiring.”
“Hungry?” The question came out before Sherlock had time to think about it.
John paused once their lips met, taking time to breathe through the process, making sure no one was changing his mind, giving Holmes time to run away. Holmes changed the angle slightly, and kissed Watson again, gently.
BOYLE
You want to play twenty questions?
He inwardly cringed at the mere thought, but then, what the hell was wrong with him?
“Because we’ve got a ping.” Mycroft’s voice came from behind John.
Watson blinked, only now processing Holmes’s undercover persona. He was much more… charming. Warm. Different. He was so far from the arrogant man he had met last night. The American accent seemed odd at first, a bit fake, but he was so charming that you sort of forgot about it. In fact, if Watson hadn’t met him before, he never would have guessed this was a role. It made Watson rather curious to see how Holmes’s singing and dancing were going to be.
Holmes eyed Watson a moment. “It was a very unique experience. But a delightful one.”
“Only use it on
John enters the cabin, checks the shooter’s breathing. As he does, someone grabs him from behind, covering his mouth.
Email me about that mentorship.
Holmes waved her goodbye and turned to Stamford. “Can I use the studio again tonight?”
“Here, right here.” John said as he grabbed the clock.
“Yes.”
I’ll take it.
“Come in,” Watson called with butterflies in his stomach, almost certain he knew who it was.
Fascinating.
“Wrong.”
Sherlock eyes Holt.
We have two hours to get you ready for your shift with Holmes. Let’s make the most of it.
“Do I remember Mycroft saying that the Tesla stuns and erases short term memory?”
“If this is your attempt at humour-” Sherlock warned but John didn’t let him finish.
“I’m afraid it’s true. I'm not one to go out much.”
Sherlock scoffed, rolled his eyes and swiveled his chair back towards the screens.
Watson rolled his eyes. “Small started acting all suspicious and left quickly, I figured it would be worth checking into Moran.”
He looked around, he didn’t understand how he could hear so many people and not see a single one. All he saw was darkness, making him feel alone and vulnerable. Holmes started to struggle against his ties even though he knew it was useless.
Sherlock? Sod this, I’m going up there.
Then he started pacing.
“Where in Russia?” She insisted, moving towards the computer but keeping her distance.
Sherlock took John’s offered hand. Shirtless and barefoot, Sherlock followed John to the bedroom.
“No.” Holmes looked away.
SHERLOCK
He pulled his phone out from between the cushions. Eleven. He had slept ten hours straight. That hadn’t happened in years. Not without chemical assistance.
HOLT (off screen)
“Step, step, sidestep, sidestep, kick ball change, kick ball change, double spin, and pose. Got that? Together then: Five, six, seven, eight.”
Stamford slapped Watson on the back. “I think we’ve got a hit.”
“But John-” Sherlock stopped mid sentence when his eyes locked with John’s.
Holmes clenched his jaw. “I’ll be in my dressing room.” He didn’t look at Ms Adler, just left.
“You won’t, if you tell me what you were doing in there?”
“That’s… actually a perfect description of him.” Watson looked atop the desk for a pen.
Watson cleared his throat loudly. “It’s about last night, but um, we should probably wait for Lestrade.”
“Sorry to bother you. I’m here to apologise for Morgan’s behaviour. It was unacceptable.”
And thank you to the ever wonderful May-shepard for the chapter summary.
General nodding of understanding.
“What?” Watson repeated.
There you go.
was in black and white.
“Edward is in the middle of putting a new life together for himself, trying to move to something better.”
“Right.” John was unconvinced. “How bad is it?”
An elderly couple walks past them. John takes a step back and turns away from Sherlock. Sherlock waits for the couple to be out of ear shot to speak.
“This is what we call a poser. He isn’t part of the lifestyle, he’s using it as a hunting ground to lure subs and kill them.”
Holmes searched his face. “You’re serious.”
“Nope.”
Holmes rolled his eyes.
. Did you-I mean, you don’t have to tell me, it’s none of my business, I just-I”
It suddenly struck Sherlock she had been going along assuming John had accepted her request and she panicked.
LESTRADE
“He’s gone.” He admitted, facing Rogers who had stopped moving.
“Maybe more.”
“I would much rather continue kissing you,” Watson said as he pulled away. “But if we’re late, Stamford is going to have a fit.”
“Refer to previous answer.”
John pursed his lips and fought the urge to smirk back. The gleam in his partner’s eyes was irritably distracting. It didn’t usually have this much effect on him, but honestly, with this whole style change and black and white effect, was absolutely captivating. Just watching him pace was making John’s mind go blank.
Fuelled by nervousness, Sherlock’s rambling continued.
“Yes. Well. It’s part of the job.” Sherlock answered awkwardly. “So. Stabbed and turned deaf in one day.” John didn’t know what to answer. “A good day then.” Sherlock added, smiling.
The Farnsworth rang loudly in the Caretaker’s suit jacket. The sound was breaking the peace of his home office, filled only with the muted sound of London traffic.
“It doesn’t change the fact that in order to get back to the Warehouse,” Sherlock intervened, his business like tone breaking the mood. “We need to finish the story.”
The pictures stayed untouched.
Stamford ushered Holmes to the sound stage, past the crew sitting along the edge of the set. Everyone was there, including Murray, Small, Ms Louise and a scowling Ms Riley. Ms Adler and her assistant Ms Kate were sitting apart from the group, huddled close and whispering.
Sherlock refused the offer with a small shake of his head as he sat, his pale eyes taking in everything he could about the man sitting across from him. They sat in silence as they waited for Peggy to come back with John’s drink.
“Pleasure.” Lestrade squinted. “You a friend of Sherlock’s?”
“I-I just want to make sure you’re alright.”
Detective. I invented the job.
“What are you doing?”
You’re--wait. You’re playing matchmaker and you haven’t gotten Boyle involved?
“You’re serious.” Watson stated again. The man leaned forward before speaking.
.” Ms Hawkins said through her teeth, eyes a bit wilder than usual.
“Stop.” Ms Hawkins raised her hand. “Stop, stop, stop.”
Holmes turned around, dropping his imaginary loaf of bread and making Ms Riley drop her imaginary supplies. Holmes caught her in his arms before she fell. They ended up in a sort of dipped pose.
Don’t be idiots.
“He’s fictional.”
Fine, I’m gonna stalk him. Bye.
Thank you.
“You could.”
“This is good, much better than the love story we’re currently filming. Therefore, it should be made.”
“Looks like somebody’s working their way to the top.” Murray, the lighting designer, said to Small, the sound tech, and Wilder, the cameraman once the dressing room door was closed.
“Of course it’s here. I was just about to put it away when I heard the door. Wait? What? That
“Well.” John looked to the side. “Pretty sure you’re not a murderer. But you’re definitely a bit mad.”
“I was the one who recommended you to Mycroft. After Qatar. He was surprised I even brought up the subject since I had refused every candidate for years.” Sherlock looked at the floor as he continued. “There are a lot of soldiers out there with your skills in weapons and combat. Very few are also field surgeons. I must admit I had always thought it was fascinating how one can learn to kill as one learns to heal...”
“The other night?”
“What are we supposed to-” Watson’s words were cut short when Holmes suddenly jumped and grabbed onto the top of the fence and lifted himself up with much more ease then one would expect from a man of his stature. “Yeah, that works.”
“She’s a selfish manipulative woman that blackmailed her way into keeping her artifact collection that she uses in the most obscene manners for her unfortunately very lucrative business.”
“Is everything alright?” Watson asked.
“Then what use are you?” The agent spat from across the room.
My relationship with John is none of your business.
Holmes blinked.
“Nine.”
Wiggins crossed his arms. “Yeah, like that’ll happen.”
John shook his head. “Just call Mycroft already.”
Two years?!
John looked at him, leaning against the ramp, his shirt messed up from the fight, and his hair out of control, John felt a twinge he hadn’t felt in years.
“One last thing.” Sherlock’s deep voice cut in.
Its awful.
“And you Mr Morgan,” The reporter continued, “how has it been working with Holmes?”
“What do you want?”
Doesn’t matter I’m here now.
Watson suddenly felt Holmes’s thigh press into his and nearly jumped away in surprise. He thankfully managed to stay still, held back from turning to Holmes, and dearly hoped he wasn’t blushing.
“Oh, thank goodness.” Stamford blew out a breath of relief.
“Up, on your knees.”
“Really? That thing almost blew us up and you’re calling it clever?” The soldier asked breathily, lifting an eyelid to look at the agent.
I know most people know Frank Sinatra’s version, but I am rather fond of Dinah Washington’s rendition. I like to imagine Sherlock’s version is somewhere in between Frank and Dinah’s.
“Auxiliary.” The screen display changed. Sherlock scanned the options. “Log.”
Holmes seemed to snap out of his train of thought and smiled down to her. “Yes, of course.”
“Well, isn’t this a surprise? It’s been a while, Johnny boy.” John heard a voice coming from the far end of the locker section. That voice. The soldier knew that voice, but he hadn’t heard it in years. He shouldn’t be hearing it, not with what had happened the last time he’d heard it. Looking at the Tesla pointed at him, he slowly moved aside to try and get a clear view of the source. Stepping out of a row further down was a tall man dressed in combat pants and a hoodie, his head covered with a cap that hid his eyes. Once he was standing in the middle of the row, he lifted his head, his gaze finding John’s and he smiled wickedly.
Morgan also stood in the half-light, inches away from the circle of light on the floor, a black hole absorbing every light diamond that reached him. He stared at Holmes a long moment before bending forward, making his head and shoulders lean into the cone of light.
“Alright.”
“Where are you going?” The deep voice questioned as he heard the familiar creek of the hard wood floor a few feet away from the steel door.
The was a second collective gasp, quickly followed by Lestrade stepping in.
“Would you like to go over the choreography again?”
Lestrade looked irritated. “They don’t.”
“Asked?” Watson cut in, outraged. “He threatened you with a bloody ultimatum!”
“Two coffees please. Cream or sugar?” He asked John who simply stared at him in disbelief.
“Okay.”
I have a question.
I’m so sorry Captain.
“That’s it. Go on one case with Sherlock. Then tell me you still want to go back to the Special Forces.” Mycroft answered John with pursed lips but smiling eyes. John knew better than to leave the fine print unclear.
Stamford nodded to Ms Hawkins.
“Are you seriously this thick or do you just like making me mad?”
There’s a sound of glass breaking in the headset.
“Follow me.” Said the man, noticing where Watson was looking. He opened a door on the left of the windows that led them to a balcony overlooking what could only be described as a warehouse.
John was too preoccupied by the absence of a scar, passing his hand over his stomach a few times and sliding his other hand under Sherlock to feel his back, to notice his partner’s stunned face.
“What does FHC stand for?” The words came out breathier than Watson expected.
He could do without Sherlock’s exasperated sigh as he rolled closer to him.
John scanned the page. “Oh, Jesus.”
It was such a thrill to see John struggle, that the mere sight of Sherlock was too much to handle. He wanted to keep going, wanted to make John come undone with just his mouth. His cock was right there, bright red with a bead of pre-cum on the tip just begging to be licked.
Thanks again to the wonderful may-shepard for helping me crank up the angst.
We’ll be on our way now.
I think you broke Jake.
“A bold choice of lyrics,” Holmes continued.
“That way!”
“The evidence pointed to accident, so they didn’t run bloodwork.”
“Sherlock, what-?” John asked as he leaned in to try and see what his partner was typing.
“You wouldn’t understand even if I explained. Now would you untie me!?” Watson pressed his knee harder into the man’s back.
Small looked at the ground.
Any headache? Nausea?
“You can worry about your personal hygiene later and we can get coffee at the station. We can’t, however, miss this train.”
“I use the most efficient methods possible with the resources I have while keeping under the radar. You should be taking notes instead of complaining.” John looked at his partner in disbelief.
TERRY
Sherlock took a shot in the dark. “That we’re close?”
“What’s her name?” Neeson teased. John was taken aback by the insinuation, and completely ignored the images his brain was unhelpfully providing him. What was actually going on was so far off from what Neeson was thinking.
The truth was he didn’t really mind the experiments and explosions and the chaos of it all. He just wished they could be friends.
Yeah, well, I still think it’s weird.
The first song started on screen and Holmes found himself twitching. It seemed his muscle memory wanted to dance along. He was even more surprised when Edward jumped over the fence in the next scene. The one that lead to Holmes landing on his face and required stitches.
“He seemed to know the premises well and got us out by a faster route than if we had gone back the same way I came in with the team.”
Bringing John on the case meant telling him Sherlock had been undercover the day before. That wouldn’t necessarily go well. It would probably be best not to discuss it during John’s shift. He could ask John to come back to his apartment and explain while showing him the case file.
Holmes’s eyes flickered to Watson before answering Lestrade. “I’m on a case that involves certain things that I do enjoy, but I would never choose to be an actor.”
That moment just before Sherlock left, when their eyes met, just the memory made him moan. Giving in, Sherlock’s hand slid down his chest and cupped himself through his trousers.
“Oh.” Holmes thought she was beautiful, even more so than Ms Adler, but there was something else. He wasn’t sure what it was exactly, but she had quite a lot of sex appeal. “She’s… something, isn’t she?”
Ms Adler pointed to the script. “What was the motivation behind ‘I didn’t mean to hurt you’?”
BOYLE
“A ping?” John asked as he walked back into the sitting room.
For God’s sake.
In clothes?
Watson was surprised to hear a British accent.
BOYLE
“Hello.” The woman repeated, looking from one man to the other. Sherlock nodded at her, the creepy fake smile making her take a step back. John cleared his throat and started questioning her.
The LED on the key pad turned green.
It had always felt odd walking onto an empty set after they had wrapped up a movie. Now, with the sets still up, equipment abandoned everywhere, a few chairs fallen sideways, scripts and paper scattered everywhere, the set felt haunted. It was just as they left it, when Anderson plunged to his death.
“Holmes! Are you all right?” Ms Adler shouted worriedly, her hands covering her face. She threw herself into the arms of her assistant.
“Probably, either way, they’re not my type.”
“Shit!” John cursed as he shook the door handle, not caring about the sign that clearly indicated it was closed.
“What?”
“Then why did he go after the GPS in the first place?”
“John. There’s no music playing.” He said gravely.
Sherlock straightened and dusted himself off. “Off to kill Lilly in a jealous rage, as any boring and predictable book would do.”
Holt leaves the podium to Sherlock.
The polished metal plated door led them into the foyer where a speechless hostess was blinking at the sight of what had just walked into the door. With a heavy sigh, Lennox smoothed his coat and spoke tightly to her.
Starboard: right-hand side of the boat when you are facing the bow
Watson leaned back in his seat and did not hide his smirk.
John, I didn’t mean to--
“Bullshit. Have you been using the barometer again? No, I’ll deal with that another time. But right now, we are not going to break into anywhere. I am heading back to the flat to read and I swear, if you either ruin the story for me or wake me up by screaming tomorrow...” John started to threaten but he could see Sherlock had simply tuned him out. Without a word, he grabbed his coat and walked out of the office, slamming the door behind him.
The sound of Stamford’s approaching voice made Watson blink and pull away.
Watson caught sight of Stamford’s pleading eyes and looked away. With a resigned face, he folded the paper, slipped it in his trouser pocket and grabbed his cane.
Morgan’s laughter died down as he jumped to his feet and started pacing, or rather started walking along the edge of the set, as if circling his prey. Ms Hawkins looked lost as well, keeping a close eye on Morgan, waiting for whatever cue she might get.
Ms Adler plastered on her fake smile and took Anderson’s arm. “Come on, we’ve got this.”
Ms Adler, who had not taken his eyes off Holmes since he had started dancing, leaned in to whisper into Morgan’s ear. His eyebrows rose as she spoke, then leaned back to look at her in the eye. She chuckled and waited.
“It’s to protect us.”
The corridor lead to a room with softer lighting. Every inch of display space held chains, whips, paddles, rope, floggers, and spreader bars of all different shapes, sizes, and colors.
A bright smile blossomed across John’s face, the one Sherlock had named the loving smile. He was so focused on it that he was caught completely off guard when John flipped him onto his back. Any attempts to protest were forgotten when John’s cock aligned with his own.
“Yes, Ma’am.”
“Together? Aren’t we technically arch nemesisss—neme--nemesisisses?”
Watson was grateful to find a turtleneck in the few changes of clothes he kept in Stamford’s office, even if he just ended up spending the morning moping on the couch. Stamford worked at his desk and muttered to himself about cartels and curses. Once he left for lunch, Watson managed to sleep for three hours. When he woke up, he still felt hungover and dreadful, and reluctantly made his way down to set to get coffee. He checked his turtleneck one last time and remembered to grab his cane to keep up appearances.
SHERLOCK
John’s hands cupped Sherlock’s face, tilted his head back, and he leaned in for a kiss.
“Just order in.”
Watson doubled over in laughter. “Yes, that seemed to be the consensus back there.”
He shook his hand a bit before he grabbed onto the plank, not fighting back the shaking breath that came out as he felt immersed in cold, like being dumped into an ice filled tub.
The washroom door opened, but Watson didn’t move, just focused on his breathing.
“I didn’t think it would be so bright.” Sherlock squinted. “Maybe because of your natural hair colour?”
“Is there a way to prove she was lying?” John wondered, which got him an inquisitive look from his partner.
“Oh! oh, do that again.” Sherlock moaned as she grabbed John’s wrist to push her in further. “Another.”
John didn’t hear him. “It’s too lonely here.” He whispered to himself, half surprised, half concerned. He remembered reading that the artifact had mainly been sighted in public places, but nothing in there explained why.
SHERLOCK
“Sherlock?”
Me too. When you come visit you can stay at my place. That way we can spend more on restaurants.
The prick.
“When someone refuses to identify themselves, I call that suspicious. Hence suspect.” He told the man before answering Rogers. “I didn’t bail; I knew you could take care of yourself. Over.”
“If you understood the first time, why are you asking the question?”
“What do you know?” The deep voice rumbled in the room, each word slicing the air.
“Obviously.” Sherlock muttered. “This would go faster if I didn’t need to explain everything.”
“You came in yesterday, tried a few paddles, then bought three hundred pounds worth of lingerie for your friend. The next day you came back, talked me into the investigation, then bought more lingerie. So is she really just a friend, or do you have a lingerie fetish?”
The piano finished with a flourish as Holmes sang the last note.
“Watson insists on being modest, but I assure you he directed everyone with respect and was able to listen to ideas and use what served the story best.” Ms Adler cut in.
Lestrade, Boyle, Rosa, and Holt look at each other.
Watson had had enough experience with reckless soldiers who didn’t care about getting their wounds treated, eager to head back out in the field. A detective-come-actor didn’t worry him.
“You think he’s somehow tied to the shop?”
“Sometimes I envy you, having a mind idle enough to enjoy such simple things.” Sherlock said as he crouched in front of the lock and took out two paperclips.
SHERLOCK
“So, how did it go?” She asked expectantly, her eyes bright and hopeful.
“Thank you.”
Sherlock’s pale eyes were fixed on what was dangling from John’s neck. In his years as an agent, doing maintenance and inventory, he had come across a few items that had caught his attention and memorised their files.
“Oh fuck you!” John screamed as he dropped the hose and ran back to Sherlock.
John stopped him with a hand to his chest and smirked. “Wait, that’s a good line, let me just write it down real quick-”
Holmes looked resigned. “That’s the plan.” He pulled away. He shuffled the pages in his hands and spoke to Dimmock. “Can we work on the third verse of the opening again?”
What isn’t wrong with it?
“Ms Rosie.”
“And do you understand what it implies?”
SHERLOCK
Everything was cut short when Archie pushed through the studio door, followed by Stamford and Ms Hooper.
“How is that good news?” John asked.
Ms Hawkins nodded. “Of course.” And waved at the chairs along the wall before turning back to Holmes and Ms Riley. “Now, where were we?” Ms Hawkins looked down at the open script in front of her. “Yes, first meeting.” She sat and smiled. “When you’re ready.”
He smiled down at her. “So am I.”
He pulled her aside, far enough not to be overheard but close enough to keep an eye on Morgan.
“Stupid.” Sherlock exclaimed. “How did I not figure that out?”
Holmes paused. “Maybe.”
Mycroft’s voice rang loudly as John ran past a speaker. “Warehouse destruction in three minutes.”
Watson’s eyes glanced at Holmes before he realised he was doing it. “A bit of both, really.”
. A bit irritated, John finished his tea and stood, taking out his mobile as he walked towards the balcony. Might as well call back Neeson while he waited.
“Shouldn’t we bag the possible artifact and look around after?”
Holt turns around, eyes wide. John and Sherlock are standing just outside the breakroom. Sherlock has a bandage on his forehead. They both look tired.
“And how does that happen exactly?”
“Come on Small, be smart.” Watson edged.
You’re not?
“And how did this
“John, oh, John!”
She bit her lip and texted back.
“What?” The agent stopped mid stride and looked at his partner expectantly.
Holmes nodded. “Good. Mrs Hudson will be pleased.”
Reveal Jake standing behind John and Sherlock, his gun aimed at them.
“I see.” Holmes steepled his hands against his lips. His eyes travelled over from Watson’s feet to his head. “And were you on set that day?”
SHERLOCK
Sherlock and Amy drive into the parking lot. As they approach Rosa’s car, they see Rosa and John laughing together.
“We have to get the knife out.” Sherlock said as he approached him.
“No, he’s still at the Warehouse.” John explained as he put his novel aside. He looked up when Mrs. Hudson walked in and smiled at him before tusking at the state of the room, wiping the seat of Sherlock’s chair before sitting.
SHERLOCK
“Too early to tell. I'd need the GPS to possibly know more.”
SHERLOCK
“Would it kill you to
Holmes tried to imagine Ms Adler as a producer. “That… suits her perfectly, actually.”
connection that they exist. And, well, the caretaker is by definition the expert on this, but when an artifact is created, we don’t immediately take them. Just because they exist, doesn’t mean they are bad or harm anyone. It usually stays with the person it’s connected to until they pass away. Why separate them if they don’t cause any harm?”
“Right, yeah.” Watson looked down and placed his hands on the piano keys. “My voice is rubbish since you know, I’ve been up all night.” He cleared his throat, played the first few chords and started setting the scene. “I had to change the dialogue of the banquet scene a bit to make it work, but mainly, Edward and Jane argue, again, she leaves, he goes looking for her to apologize. The song starts when Edward finds her.”
“On?”
“Right, yes, of course.” Holmes bit his lip. “Can I ask you one thing?”
John’s lips brushed against his ear, making Sherlock shiver.
Only Anderson seemed to be struggling up the steps, looking distracted. They made it to the top, but faltered on the last step. He recuperated quickly, making it seem like it was part of the act, but two beats later he tripped. His arms flew out, hands trying to grab hold of anything around him. He tethered around, trying to find his balance, and ended up against the balcony ramp. His face relaxed, letting out a breath of relief, when the next moment he toppled back and over the ramp, falling sixteen feet to the concrete floor.
Fuck.
“Technically yes, only I did need to get you awake and Mrs. Hudson insisted I let you sleep in as long as you wanted if we didn’t have a ping so the violin was the easiest option. The coffee was to speed things up. Don’t get used to it.” Sherlock explained as John took a sip of his coffee.
Resistance being part of the game.
John looks confused.
Because the image his optic nerve transmits to his brain can't be real.
“Why? Do you want to shower first? You just had a bath.” Sherlock seems a bit nonplussed. His gaze trails down where John's fingers are wrapped around his arm.
Jesus fucking Christ!
“You really look the part.” Mycroft had said when Sherlock had emerged from the bathroom.
Monty is showing the Krauts where to stick it! Finally!
As he turns left and walks up Baker Street, he passes buildings walled with sand bags. Others are damaged to different degrees by bombs, yet not recently. There are not that many people about at this time of day, as it's almost nine o'clock in the morning. School and work have started, and John sees only housewives on their way to do what passes for shopping these days and mostly consists of queueing for one's rations.
Piss off, Mycroft! For all the voices to choose from, why has it to be his brother's? Fuck you, subconscious!
John has gone very pale. He has to take a deep breath, then another, and fights the impulse to instantly flee from the room like a four-year-old caught red-handed with his hands in the biscuits tin. He's a grown man, for god's sake; a soldier! He won't retreat!
Sherlock feels as if time stretches like syrup. He’s trapped in sticky molasses, with a concerned army doctor by his bedside, who just won’t leave him in peace.
Why can't the doctor just leave him alone? Does he really has to witness Sherlock's disgusting condition, his pathetic weakness?
“Perfect. Just perfect. You look exactly  like the men he loves to cut up. What could possibly go wrong?” John turns and marches off into the kitchen, aggressively putting the kettle on.
“I should hope so.”
Just when he's quite sure that he will not get an answer from Greg, the DI enquires in a cautious tone: “Sherlock talked to you about his past?” Greg furrows his brow in consternation.
"A fiery shade of ginger, big blue eyes, nice bosom ... Sherlock, what's all this about, why are you pulling a face?"
It doesn't take long. They are both too keyed up, starved for touch. John fucks Sherlock viciously, hard and fast, and bites down on his shoulder to stifle the cry as he comes deep inside him. Sherlock holds him tight as the aftershocks ripple through him, before he pushes up against John's hard-muscled belly, once, twice, and shoots his load all over his own chest right up to his chin. John watches, wide-eyed, before he bows down and licks Sherlock's come off his skin.
Only when characteristic noises, that are usually unheard of at three o’clock in the afternoon in their sitting room, emanate from the laptop speakers does John suddenly sit up, pricking up his ears.
“Go on then...” John offers, and Sherlock takes him up on it, pushing his right hand beneath the elastic waistband, closing long dextrous fingers around John's aching shaft and squeezes.
John suddenly feels drained and exhausted. All fight is knocked out of him. He simply shakes his head as he turns away, walking through the dark London streets towards the nearest tube station, leaving Lestrade behind. Some people stop and stare at him but he doesn't bother. Only when the sharp, cold draught on the downward escalators leading to the platform hits him full in the face does John realise that his cheeks are wet.
Nothing from Mycroft!!! How is this possible? My useless fathead of a brother...
When he finally emerges from his bedroom – hair still wet but immaculately dressed in shirt and bespoke black trousers – John is sitting at the kitchen table, happily munching away on a sandwich for lunch, leafing through The Independent. The smell of ham and cheese nearly makes Sherlock's stomach turn.
What on earth could John be frightened of?
“Yes, right. It was an invitation, with her number. I ripped it to shreds. And took the money attached.” Sherlock sounds grave but not at all apologetic.
“Perhaps we needed the time? To be sure?”
“Sherlock studied chemistry as well. At Cambridge, I believe,” John blurts out without thinking, yet again returning to his favourite subject.
Despite her best efforts, all ensuing mistakes are entirely my fault.
Their client has the good sense to remove his hands from Sherlock's body just in time. He offers one, instead, for a shake, which lingers far too long, before bidding his farewell to the rest of the small crowd.
John shakes his head, then probes at his teeth. Some are wobbly but it's not too bad. “Good punch.”
William just groans and throws up his hands in the air. “Dear god…”
Walter got really drunk and boasted that he’d once been ordered to kidnap the Duke of Windsor and Mrs Simpson in Portugal, but the attempt failed. He wants us to live in London when the war is over. He hopes Hitler might appoint him governor there (
John takes it as consent to their date. He smiles all the way to work.
John remembers his therapy sessions after he'd been discharged, an invalid, lonely, without purpose. He thinks about his own upbringing, his parents, Harry. He thinks about Afghanistan. “But... not you. You weren't supposed....” John's voice is hoarse with emotion. He can't go on.
Ok... this has been… unexpected. Not bad, just … extraordinary, in every aspect. And a little bit unsettling.
“What do you mean?”
Maybe he shouldn't have had that second glass of wine is the last coherent thought he remembers later before his mind goes entirely blank.
“Oh, never mind.”
“I haven't...”
Until his head is jerked away, his sensitive follicles screaming at the hard drag of John's fingers. John's cock slides from his mouth with a wet pop, and Sherlock is panting, his breathe ragged. A thick thread of spit clings to John's glans as Sherlock raises his gaze to meet John's; a debauched creature, a Byronic temptation with a lascivious grin plastered on his face. He's breathtaking. John shoves him down again, stuffing his mouth until his eyes water while he fights for air.
“Tosser.” John smiles and playfully whacks Sherlock with a pillow. “About that movie you were watching...”
Though, at the sound of John's voice, Sherlock raises his head and looks up, fixing John with an unreadable stare while sucking in his lower lip. John instantly realises that Sherlock's not sulking but thinking hard, giving him an air of perturbed fragility. His vexation is not directed towards John; instead, he seems profoundly irritated with himself.
“Well, I'll have the penne all'arrabiata and a glass of Pinot Grigio.”
“Well, you know...” He very much hopes Greg doesn't. “Same old stuff. His Nibs is amusing himself with some kidneys tonight.”
Life, Sherlock muses, drifting in and out of sleep, is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. Most people would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.
I had way to much fun with that LSD trip. tbh: it was just to work that conductor of light metaphore.
“And you call
Jake laughs. Sherlock glares at Rosa. John and Lestrade bite back smiles.
“Those coordinates can wait.” John stood as well and pointed his finger at his chest. “You are going to the hospital.”
Lestrade was there, finishing a sandwich.
John nodded curtly, unsure where this was headed.
“He came alone, probably at her request. They fought on the bridge before Barnabas got hit by the artifact. The force of the shot made him fall over the railing. He was dead before he hit the ground.”
“No. Tell me.” The man ignored Watson’s protest and walked over to the fireplace to press a hidden switch. A small metal rod came out of the mantle to scan his eye. A small beeping sound was heard before the fireplace was pulled back and slid to the side, revealing an elevator. “I’ll do even better. I’ll show you.” The man said as he stepped aside to let Watson into the elevator first. Watson couldn’t help but think this reminded him of a cheesy spy movie. What was next? Robots? A time machine?
You’re serious.
“Shut up.”
She smiled. “And to be treated like an equal.”
Holmes paused before answering. “Well, I was planning on heading back to London but, well it seems this town has grown on me.”
Stamford shrugged. “Well, I guess he’d be my type too if I were into that sort of thing.”
Watson lowered his arm, looking as if he was suddenly remembering what was happening.
Amy quickly walks to the display where Sherlock and John were standing just a moment ago. She looks around. There are a few people blocking the view. When they clear away, Amy sees a door on the left that leads outside. She dashes off towards it, not bothering to check if Jake is following her.
“Then thank me for getting you out of that chore.” Sherlock concluded as he led them outside.
The door closed loudly behind them.
“That’s not a bad idea.” He paused, letting himself think about it a moment.
“Then how are we supposed to get it off?”
“Two, Captain.” Sherlock hissed.
Holmes frowned and looked like he was trying not to pout.
“You did that five years ago and didn’t succeed, how would it be any different now?”
“Who are you?” The Captain demanded. Pale eyes flicked from the pit to the soldier. He scrutinized every inch of him, which was starting to make him uncomfortable.
“You got all that from the paper?” Watson’s voice betrayed his amazement.
“Shit.” John cursed when he saw the empty spot against the tool box.
Watson turned to the sound stage as Ms Adler handed back the bullhorn and waved him over with her gloved hand. Morgan looked amused, while Holmes seemed to be fighting a sulk.
Watson’s eyes met Holmes’s before letting the door close behind him.
As he finished his plate and Holmes started his, Watson took a step back to contemplate the situation. Everything surrounding Holmes, especially tonight, felt surreal. Yet here they were, eating together in Watson’s flat as if it were the most normal thing in the world. As if they hadn’t just spent the evening breaking into a money laundering business for the biggest drug cartel in the East Coast and knocked out Frank Hudson with a telephone. Watson was almost disappointed there wasn’t anything special about how Holmes ate. Or maybe the fact that he was eating was odd, if what he said earlier was anything to go by.
Dimmock played an A chord on the piano, and Holmes hummed the note as he rolled his shoulders and stepped onto his mark.
“Come on,” Sherlock said close to John’s ear. “We have a world to save.” He winked and headed towards the portal.
“Yes,” Holmes nodded. “It’s great.”
“Well,” Holmes crossed his arms. “That confirms my theory: Anderson was poisoned.”
“We had enough evidence; we didn’t need to go to that last hanger.” John explained, still not looking at them.
Watson cleared his throat. “At the production meeting, Morgan and I had a few… words.”
“Seems we’ll be busy tonight,” Ms Adler said as her eyes came to a halt on their left. “I assume Stamford briefed you?”
“Me too.”
“What the hell!” John shouted, almost dropping the kettle and the ferret on the floor.
“Take us to Mr. Barnabas.”
Does he not know?
“Last night they kidnapped Holmes, and when Watson found Holmes, he was with James Moriarty aka Jimmy Morgan, and…” Jones looked down at his notes. “Ms Mary Rosie, which might be a fake name-”
This is terrifying.
“I was wrong. I like him.” Sherlock smirked as he sat in his leather chair.
As he moved towards the dressing rooms, a corridor on the left revealed itself. The lingerie displayed there offered a different variety of options than the front room. The brassieres and corsets were covered with jewels and mirrors. Some were made of leather, and those ranged from plain black leather to coloured to being covered with straps, metal rods, and hooks in various places. Underwear that barely covered anything, or with holes in key places and- oh God was that latex? How… impractical.
“A simple clock. Look. Let’s just go back and I’ll show you.” John said as he tugged at the man they were holding to get them moving again.
John grabbed the device out of Sherlock’s hands and spat at the Caretaker. “Why are you answering now and not 20 minutes ago when it was important?!”
Don’t use that term ever again.
Sherlock cried with relief when the hit landed on the right. The pain seemed so mild in comparison.
However, Anderson’s box step was so stiff that it seemed like Ms Adler was dancing with a wall. When they danced side by side it was even worse. He looked like a dancing elephant next to a swan ballerina.
“Stop it.” Sherlock didn’t like losing control of his movements, especially if she was at the controlling end.
“Really now, doesn’t the government train you at all? The building is on lockdown. Do you need me to explain what lockdown means? Here I thought doctors needed at least a minimal amount of intelligence to get their license. Or has all of that military training knocked out all capacity to think?” Watson’s fist itched to punch the man. Repeatedly. But that would slow them down, so he took a deep breath and answered.
Sherlock put on his fedora as he spoke. “So we accepted to find an artifact that we don’t plan on giving back?”
LESTRADE
“It was nice to meet you, John. Until next time.”
Yeah, that can’t be good.
Would he have covered Sherlock’s cock with his hand, like he did?
“I-, the D-DOCD?” The woman repeated uncertainly.
“Yup.” John smiled before punching him on the temple, effectively knocking him out.
They stayed quiet for most of the ride, Sherlock throwing John a few little glances in the hopes of catching anything that could help him understand. When he saw him smiling in the glass reflection, Sherlock frowned.
Watson pushed him back until the back of Holmes’s knees hit the chair and made him sit heavily.
Holmes stopped in front of them and looked from one truck to the other. “The motor should announce his arrival. We’ll have plenty of time to hide.”
“Money.” Sherlock answered with a bored tone.
Watson grunted out of frustration, pulling his own hair, as if it could help him figure out… this, whatever this was.
“Yes, you’re covered in light diamonds.”
Stamford walked into his office to find a sleeping Watson on his couch, and several copies of the revised script on his desk.
Brilliant.
“Shouldn’t we also be investigating who put the violin up for bid?”
“I love you baby, I love you so much, you’re all I care about.”
“Can we at least try to make it to the bed this time? My back was killing me the next day and we have a long day tomorrow.”
John doesn't need to be told twice.
Sherlock just glares back at him and removes his hands from John's body.
Sherlock immediately rips the towel away – and gasps. Outright gasps! Well, John knows he's rather impressive, but this reaction, coming from Sherlock of all people, who doesn't as much as raise an eyebrow when encountering a severed head in the fridge, is a welcome compliment. John's cock twitches in return, and Sherlock's eyes go wide.
But when John looks up at Sherlock's face all doubt and reluctance leaves him in an instant. Sherlock watches, mesmerised, as his finger sinks deeper into John, shameless longing so openly displayed on his sharp features that John can't help himself but moan with desire.
After a moments hesitation, the sleepy pile next to him murmurs “Sherlock.”
He stores his fresh supplies in his usual hiding place, then showers. He allows himself five minutes in John's bedroom, looking down at the solid frame of the sleeping man – the sight still novel and therefore a bit daunting - before retreating to the living room and sitting in his chair in the dark. He's waiting for the sun to slowly rise over London, that great cesspool, the belly of the beast, the place he hates but can't live without, longing to feel the quiver of its beating heart.
John banishes those serious thoughts as he starts to move, tentatively at first, but soon his thrusts become bolder, harder, deeper. Sherlock roars beneath him, cheering him on, his deep voice filling the room, the only other sound the slapping from sweaty flesh on flesh. If John had any capacity left, he would worry about the noise. But at the moment he can't be arsed.
“Why occupy yourself with it? I thought you just dismissed him and his case.”
Sherlock smirks.
Sherlock nods; John pulls him up and turns him around, cradling his face. Sherlock is pliant, which immediately raises John's suspicion. “I mean it, Sherlock. You have to tell me.”
Now, they sway a little to the music as they lean against each other. Martha leaves them to it.
Stop it! John tells himself again. This is leading nowhere; or, indeed, only to a very dark and unsavoury place.
God, why did he suddenly care?
“Piss off, John.” Sherlock's voice is calm while the needle still lingers above the delicate white skin at the inside of his elbow.
“So, when your uncle Sherlock died the year you were born, at least he survived the war. Let’s find out what happened to our two love birds, shall we?” John settles onto the couch and pulls his legs up, placing the Milk Tray box on the coffee table.
“You kept tabs on him?”
“That's what it says, it says
At least I was allowed back into the flat to get some of my things. I took the photograph from Brighton, I hope you don't mind. It's just, my brain is not like yours. I forget things. But I couldn’t live with forgetting you, the way you looked, your smile, your eyes, how you taste when you are desperate for me, the sounds you make when I'm inside you...
Sherlock hooks his ankles over John's shoulders and spreads even wider to draw him in, deeper and deeper, until he hits the spot that makes Sherlock literally howl.
John just grins and kisses Sherlock again, tenderly and exploratory this time. There is a brief moment when a look of haunted sadness passes over Sherlock's face, and John would give his right arm to make it go away. Whatever happened to Sherlock, wherever he's been – it has changed him profoundly; John realises that now. He equally hopes and fears that Sherlock will tell him one day.
Sherlock gapes, stunned. John walks over to the chair where he'd deposited his clothes and gets his mobile, shoving it into Sherlock’s face. “See?”
Gibson does as he's told but brushes his hand all the way down Sherlock's right arm, even over the back of Sherlock's hand.  It tightens reflexively around the armrest; Gibson notices and lets his fingers linger a moment longer. “What are you playing at, Mr Holmes? Raising the price on me? Or are you just afraid to tackle the case?” the millionaire mumbles, more wondering than accusatory.
So, what is Sherlock to make of this?
The next few days are strange, despite the sanest times being fairly mad at 221b. Sherlock is quieter than usual. He makes himself rarre,  mostly stays in his room. John's glad to escape the gloomy atmosphere of their flat to attend locum work at the surgery on Friday.
“Nghhhn...” John hums as a response.
“Why would I keep adhesives or antirheumatic ointment in my bedroom?” Sherlock asks puzzled.
“And you never went upstairs to take a look? William Holmes, are you superstitious?”
John has, by now, finished putting away the shopping and wanders over into the sitting room, only to find it empty. There's a mug on the coffee table though, indicating that Sherlock has been up. But the tea is cold.
I want you.
anymore. In fact, great-uncle Sherlock died the year I was born. I owe him my rather flamboyant second name. William Sherlock Scott Holmes. He was my grand-dad's younger brother, or so I've been told.”
BdS: Commanders of the Security Police and the SD, or commanders of the SiPo and the SD, in short BdS (Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei), were deployed by the Reich Security Office (RSHA) to the territories occupied by the National Socialists in a sort of RSHA branch office. They were  - as before the Einsatzgruppen - dealing with intelligence-related activities as well as with "special treatments" (ie the murder) of the Jews.
William swats John with a pillow but can’t suppress a pleased grin. “Well, and the other is short and blond like you. Looks a little fitter, though.” He sticks out his tongue and John tackles him to the ground.
John stares at Lestrade and his fists clench. “It must have been quite a surprise when that junky smackhead turned up a few years later as some clever consulting detective.”
I thought I saw you walking by when I looked out of the window, down in the street. But that's impossible. I know. Still..
John still stares at the space vacated by Sherlock some minutes ago, rooted to the spot. What the hell did just happen?
“No, I mean... I didn't mean... to… take advantage. I thought you were... amenable.”
Sherlock can't suppress the laughter bubbling up in his throat, half nervousness, half genuine amusement.
“Ma-manual stimulation. Oral, active and passive. Anal.” Sherlock can feel himself blushing at this list and takes a large swig of the amber liquid. It pleasantly burns down his throat, making his head light and his cheeks heat up.
"Well, not underage..."
Please, don't get yourself into trouble by saving my reputation. I will report him, and that'll be the end of the story. I told you once that I'm not a coward, and I didn’t fight in this bloody war to allow such vermin to take control over my life. I will not yield. I am right and he is wrong, and the authorities will have to agree to that.
John, there's even a lewd drawing to go with this.” William isn't sure if he should be shocked or delighted by the rude silliness of those two men.
John tries nonetheless: “Sherlock, please...”
“’Cause not.” John sets his glass down on the bedside cabinet, takes off the towel and lies back on the bed, propped up against the cushions, hands folded behind his head. He’s already half-hard, his thick cock resting in a nest of dishwater-blond curls. “Well then, undress.”
The ground floor of 221 Baker Street is quite fittingly occupied by a small bakery. Next to it's bright red store front, however, is a black door that seems to lead to flats above the shop. John takes a deep breath, squares his shoulders, and knocks.
“Can I write him a few lines now? To explain...? To say good-bye.” John swallows.
“Me too.” John confesses, shaking his head. They are but a queer pair, the two of them.
"I ... thought I heard the doorbell?" Sherlock inquires in what he hopes a casual manner.
John knows he should be angry with Sherlock but all he can feel is mild amusement. “That might actually have been for the better, don't you think? Otherwise it could be getting a bit crowded up here.” He chuckles.
But they are past squeamishness now.
I hope I'll never set eyes on your brother again. Otherwise, I can't promise not to kill him. When I asked about my deployment, James – Major Sholto - just looked at me as if I'd lost my mind. Apparently, I'm to stay here.
Gibson simply leans back and opens his arms in a gesture of reassuring frankness. “I returned home from the city at about five, showered, changed, had dinner – alone – then worked until the police came by to tell me they'd found Mario. That must have been around eleven.” He sounds totally unmoved.
Sherlock's voice is cold when he replies: “I don't want to put you to any trouble.”
As a concession to the heat, Sherlock injects the solution in his femoral vein or even the external iliac vein as not to show off the marks on his often bare arms. John hates seeing the pin pricks on his pale skin, especially when they make love, and hates even more what the drugs might do to Sherlock, his fine body and brilliant mind, but he has no means to stop him. He can't leave.
Ms Hawkins sighed. “You’re overdoing it a bit, dear.”
“Just give it a minute,” she whispered to Holmes.
A delicate press of John’s lips, warm hands on his face. With every kiss Sherlock’s muscles relaxed. John pulled back and looked at Sherlock with soft eyes that made his chest hurt.
Did Watson know?
“That was wonderful Holmes,” Ms Adler praised, her hand still on Ms Kate’s thigh.
“Who the hell was that man?” Talley asked, but Watson was so sick of talking about the man.
“You’re seriously blackmailing me into working for you?” John inquired.
“I’ve had my eye on you for quite some time.”
No, the kid just got scared and jumped him.
“I could write a song with that.” He replied with a smirk.
next time?” John hissed through his teeth as they raised their arms slowly.
“And if we aren’t lucky?” Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned dramatically to John, clearly tired of being questioned.
“What if I am?”
“So, how often do you get cases?”
“Don’t tell Stamford, I’ve got enough on my plate as it is.” Holmes added with a wink.
“Yeah, thanks.” He ate in silence for a moment. “Why didn’t you have a Tesla in Qatar?”
“Not this again,” Holmes muttered.
“And you say he was given an opiate before the
Then why would he take the time to tell you to eat and be nice to me?
“John, what’s wrong?”
don’t know how, but someone does or we wouldn’t be here. So start explaining.” The former soldier ordered. He didn’t want to attract attention to them by shouting even though it would have been satisfying.
“He must have noticed the lock was undone. He’s going to look around.”
Once John was sitting securely, she spread John’s knees wide before her hands trailed up her thighs, scratching lightly. Sherlock smiled at the low moan it elicited and moved to licked John’s ear and bite hard enough to make John cry out.
Watson found himself joining the crowd as they laughed. Stamford looked like he wanted to cry from joy again.
Jake looks at Amy a moment before looking away. He sees Sherlock following someone towards the museum.
five times.
It’s stake-out time!
Holmes held his stare, and tilted his head slightly. Stamford slapped his hand on Holmes’s back, making them break eye contact.
John’s soft voice broke the silence. “You could have just asked.”
“What about her?” Moriarty sounded confused but mostly bored.
“Ms Hawkins,” Ms Hooper admonished, eyes wide.
“Yes.”
Or maybe he just didn’t feel things that way.
Holmes listened to the boy move a few tin cases before the film reels were loaded into the projector. Holmes leaned back in his chair, as music filled the room and the title appeared on the screen: A Chance Meeting.
Sherlock quickly continued. “But when I saw you, deduced you, I... I stopped you from falling.” The senior agent paused, unsure how to continue. He hadn’t really tried to understand what had pushed him to save John that day; it was a split second decision. “I have little regard for people in general, even less for soldiers. All so boring, like goldfish as my brother would say. And yet you-” Sherlock shut his eyes, frustrated. Putting words on an irrational behavior like instinct or sentiment was proving difficult.  He kept being distracted by the knowledge that John loved him and it made no sense how it could have happened. As clever as Sherlock was, he couldn’t fathom how his partner could care this much.
business suicide. And then we still have to reshoot the entire movie in less than a month!” Stamford suddenly stopped, and sat heavily in the chair facing the desk, and held his head in his hands. “A curse, a bloody curse. And the worst part is, I’m starting to believe it.” He raised his head and looked at Watson with a desperate look in his eye. “How else can you possibly explain why my last three movies have done so badly? And they weren’t
The comment made Watson think of his new story. At this point in the process, he couldn’t deny that most of the ideas he had on paper, the few key scenes he had managed to write, everything had been inspired by Holmes. But Watson wasn’t ready to admit it, much less to Holmes.
“No. Write whatever you want.” Stamford said with a soft tone. “Holmes told me about your other scripts John. Why didn’t you ever tell me about them?”
But once back home, it was hard getting adjusted to civilian life. Especially for a cripple. Finding a job was rare, a girl even more, so never mind trying to find a bloke willing to share a handjob in an alley. Not to mention how much more dangerous it was than in the army. It took Watson a few punches before abandoning altogether.
But because I like to torture myself, I will take the longest way there that I possibly can.
“Shit.” Watson hissed.
“More of a six now-”
When the flat of her tongue pressed against John’s vaginal opening and slowly stroked all the way up to her clitoris, they moaned simultaneously. Sherlock repeated the process again and again without increasing the speed or pressure, simply taking her time. Each stroke as broad and wide as she could, trying to taste everything at the same time with the entire surface of her tongue.
“Who sent you?” John repeated calmly.
He was about to fire when a bullet hit the wall next to his head. Anthony Bishop stepped out from behind one of the columns that lead into the main room, gun raised and a dangerous look in his eye. The lighting from the bar in the background was completing the dramatic effect.
Ms Adler flipped her hair and walked over to Morgan to greet him, while Anderson stood there, eyes wide.
“You had some fair points, for someone with no previous experience in writing or filming a movie.”
Down, girl.
It doesn’t mean anything if you say one thing and then do the opposite.
“You could dye it blonde again, although the red hue might affect the colouring.”
The constant influx of data, buzzing around like angry bees, vanished. The pain was still there, a deep scorching throb, but it wasn’t overwhelming anymore. Like swimming downstream, letting the current be his guide. Serenity washed over Sherlock’s as he abandoned himself to John’s care.
Molly stared at John’s text. Was she really…?
Holt is sitting behind his desk, Amy is sitting in front of him. Gina is leaning against the door.
The former soldier looked at his partner with an odd mixture of annoyance and fondness.  Of course this had been a ploy to show off. “You’re an ass, you know that?”
“As soon as we were hidden.”
“Cut!”
John smiled and nudged his partner with his elbow. “Good line.”
Watson took a deep breath and reminded himself this would all be over soon, and he’d never have to work with Holmes again. “Just... forget about it. Focus on the audition.”
Sherlock was about to respond when he started coughing, covering his lips with blood and a small drop on his chin.
Watson frowned, as did everyone else. “Stop,” he called and turned to Holmes. “What was that?”
“No.” Holmes suddenly turned to face them. “They’re going to manufacture and distribute LSD.”
John raised an eyebrow. “What, did you want me to sign a legal document while you’re at it?”
“Where are they going?” Watson asked as they turned right rather than left, towards the rehearsal studio.
“What? What is it?”
“So where is it?”
As the second truck went through Holmes’s same methodical process, Watson checked on the building and was obligated to intervene during the counting process.
You know them too?
“Whatever you do, do not touch it with your bare hands.” Sherlock handed him a pair of gloves. “If it grabs on, it will not let go.”
Sherlock thought about it a moment but it still didn’t make sense to her.
“Tomorrow.” Sherlock stood. “Come on, I know this little place owned by a man I met on a case once, he always gives me free tiramisu to go.” The senior agent grabbed John’s coat and tossed it to him.
“Well I’ll take this out to the trash.” The man told him as he started walking out of the room.
He might tell John one day, but not today and certainly not now.
Stamford started. “What happened?”
Everyone actively ignored Watson as he quickly stood and stormed out of the conference room. The murmur of voices drowned out the sound of his cane echoing in the corridor as the door closed behind him.
“I’m a man of my word Small. You answered my questions, so you’re not going to lose your job.” Watson put his hand on Small’s shoulder, as if to pat him on the back. But instead, Watson gripped his coat and pulled him close. “I just want to know what’s going on, you know? You get that, don’t you?”
“Please don’t fire me.” Anderson blurted when they arrived.
Enjoy!
Amy and Jake are watching Chester untying the ropes that keep the barge ashore.
Holmes tilted his head to the side. “She’s about to invite me to be part of the plan to bankrupt Stamford. I guess that would make her special.”
“Nevertheless, you are being framed for fraud, and I’m certain it’s linked to Anderson’s death.”
Holmes slipped his hands into his coat pockets. “Mind if I join?”
And now, just thinking of getting spanked by John was making him hard.
Perplexed, Sherlock filled the kettle. He wondered what he had gotten himself into as he reached for a teacup. All he wanted was a spanking, a way to shut down his brain. He didn’t need this power dynamic game to obtain it.
“What you just stick it to the alarm and it just stops?”
“You did kill a woman.”
“The good news is, it’s in London.” Mycroft said, ignoring John’s question.
Sherlock’s scream was lost in the sound of shrieks that John was certain came from the armor. Eyes wide, they watched as the helmet, a sort of iron shaped bowl with a leather back, moved and looked up at them. Slowly, the breastplate started to wriggle, red and brown stripped lacquered leather with pale lacings, which matched with the leather chaps and boots.
“Right. When I’m done with them,” He said as he pointed the guards, “you’re getting a gag, Houdini.” He said as he shot back
.” Stamford clapped his hands. “Follow me.” He stuffed a script into Holmes’s hands and started to push him towards the exit.
“She didn’t start it. The cowbell did. It causes the surrounding area to erupt in a violent firestorm when rung. Where the bell comes from is unclear, but it was knocked on the door of the bakery in London 1666, and rung again in Chicago 1879. We finally got our hands on it a couple of years ago in North Dakota after the pawn shop it was sold to exploded. We call it Catherine O’leary’s Cow Bell because we don’t have the name of the bakery and nothing on it before that incident.”
“From the top. Action!” Morgan called, and music filled the room.
“Don’t. Just. Don’t.” He answered as he started pacing, rubbing his forehead with his palm.
John finished the last stitch, cut off the excess thread, and pulled away. Sherlock watched him closely as he set down his tools and prepared a bandage. He didn’t look upset, but his jaw was clenched.
The Finale
“Not as much as I’d hoped. So either they’ve been taken out of the city, or these people knew what they were really buying.” Sherlock answered, resigned.
“This is important, I was going over the tunnel plans and-” Holmes froze and sniffed the air. “Is that marinara sauce?”
Enjoy.
With a smirk Sherlock helped John to his feet, both of them silently regretting the loss of contact. John hid it by dusting himself off, not expecting his vision to black and stagger forward. Sherlock moved and caught John before he stumbled. He ended up completely pressed against his partner’s chest, Sherlock’s strong arms holding him up.
Holmes chuckled. “Certainly am.”
Holmes wasn’t sure if it was his performance or the way it was edited, but Edward made quite an impression. He walked into the bakery looking completely out of place, and when he was about to leave stumbled into Jane. The entire sequence took about a minute, but the audience was charmed.
“I’m just happy I could help, and I hope this shows you I am not completely useless in the field.”
“It’s all thanks to Dimmock, here, Holmes replied with a smile.
“Well, I’m not bored.” John answered truthfully. But it wasn’t the whole truth. He knew what Mycroft was trying to do. The case wasn’t finished. John didn’t want Mycroft to know he had started doubting his desire to go back to his team. He just... He didn’t want to think about it. Not right now. Not this morning with barely enough caffeine to deal with both brothers. He just wanted to focus on the case.
“Good. Want to switch up the lines?”
John frowned at him. “What are you doing?”
“We.” John cut in with a fierce whisper.
John safely put the page away and let himself indulge in this universe one last time.
“I swear to god, I will kill him in my sleep one day.” The soldier said to his empty room, the remains of his dream slowly drifting away, leaving him confused. He listened to Sherlock’s footsteps on the stairs. When he was on the landing, John spoke again. “What did I tell you about waking me up by screaming when there is no immediate danger?”
“I’m sorry for not telling you sooner, but it was to prevent any interference with the investigation,” Stamford explained.
Sighing loudly, he sat in his chair to read a hardboiled crime novel by his favorite author, Anthony Bishop. He’d read it before, but it didn’t matter. It was either that or the whiskey bottle under the sink. He longed for the drink, but a hangover would just make it harder to deal with Sherlock, especially if they were about to try and catch an uncatchable artifact for the second time.
HITCHCOCK
“Oh god, and here I thought he couldn’t possibly get any worse.”
LESTRADE
Watson shrugged. “You looked like you were hitting it off.”
Stamford looked gravely at Holmes. “Best we go to my office, then.”
The former soldier sat up in his bed as his hands reached for the Tesla under his pillow and aimed it towards the door, his eyes wide as they roamed the room for possible threats.
“I promise,” Holmes replied, watching them through his eyelashes.
Watson leaned closer to whisper, “It worked.” He didn’t lean away.
Well, have a good shift you two!
May I join you?
“Good,” Holmes nodded. “I was hoping this would happen.”
Edward started walking down the street, slowed to a stop when he spotted the bakery and stared at Jane through the window.
“Whiskey. Neat.” John ordered as he sat in the booth.
Jake, Terry, Amy, Rosa, Boyle, Scully and Hitchcock look from Sherlock to Holt. Holt has the same impassive face as always.
“You’re not going to pick it, are you?” John asked as he looked up at the cameras.
Holmes turned towards Stamford. “It was interesting.”
Sherlock’s eyes go wide at John's words.
SHERLOCK & HITCHCOCK
Sherlock eyed the empty spot by the bin and cocked an eyebrow. “I believe I did.”
