“Who says I don't want that?” Dean teases, but slips out of Cas’s grasp and leads him into the bedroom. “But the bed’s more comfortable.”
“The ‘power flourishing like an oak tree’ blessing? Dude, when is it gonna stop? And why is it so different from your usual grace? Cas, it’s practically an aphrodisiac.”
“Dean, if you're afraid I'm going to leave you again, I can assure you, I'm not"”
“You have a sister too? Big family.”
Dean nods. Cas stands listening for a moment, and then says “Go!” They’re off and running when a voice yells from behind them. More gunshots ring out, the bullets travelling harmlessly past them. They make the opening of the passageway get a few feet in, and Dean is just about to collapse with relief when something punches him hard in the back of his left thigh, and he pitches forward, sprawling face-first in the sand.
“Dean, your hands…” Cas slipped his gloves off and grabbed Dean’s hands, hissing at how cold they were.
So I, I don't mind
“Are you nuts, Cas?” Dean said.
Dean sighs and gets off the bed, reaching out to take Bobby’s proffered hand.
,” Dean says, stopping to wait for Cas to catch up. Together they walk between two of the trees. There’s a rippling in the air, a feeling like a sudden change in air pressure, and they’re standing in a grove of oaks in summer dress. Grass carpets the ground at their feet, strewn with wildflowers, green leaves dance on the trees in a summer breeze. Dean turns and looks back the way they came. Beyond the old oaks, it’s still midwinter. His eyes are drawn back to the centre of the grove by sudden movement. There’s a young woman standing there barefoot on the grass. She has pale skin and long hair the colour of new spring leaves arranged in a complicated looped and whorled style. Her eyes are dark brown, and she’s wearing a long dress a few shades darker than her hair.
“I saw that there was a second movie, too,” Jack admitted. “Before you told me about it this morning. I watched the trailer. Paddington Bear gets sent to jail.”
“I swear, the kid gets weirder every day,” said Dean.
“That’s enough,” he said; Jack pulled his hand back out.
“What?” Dean paused, confused, as if racking his brain. “You mean what I said about… him taking after his father? All right, I’ll admit, maybe I went a bit far. But Jack can’t go on like that. I mean, who knows what stunt he’ll pull next? He’s -”
Jack managed to smile at that, just a little bit. Cas smiled back.
It was different to how it was with Sam and Dean. There’d never been any of that knot of worry, those seeds of doubt, those folorn, lonely feelings. Cas had always just been his dad.
Once again (because it's the last chapter), you can find me on Tumblr at:
“You’ve never had marmalade before?”
“Well. Not
talk to him. Later. After we’ve gone and picked up those damn bees he’s so desperate to get.”
Jack just shrugged, going back to the comic he was reading. Cas was watching him carefully, but didn’t say anything.
“The surprise will be how well it went,” said Dean. “They’ll come in here, expecting it to be a total disaster again – place burnt to a crisp, Cas and I rolling on the floor fighting, you cowering in the corner… but
“Sorry,” he mumbled, feeling his heart sinking again. It was obvious he’d put his foot in it
He was right. It really did. The warm, sugary scent of oranges was wafting all round the kitchen – and the rest of the bunker.
But Dean really sounded like he meant it – and Jack let himself imagine, for a moment, that he did.
“It’s like the coal for the steam train!” Jack blurted out without thinking. Dean’s head shot up – he obviously hadn’t noticed they were there. It occurred to Jack that it would probably have been better
“That was why I wanted to make marmalade for everyone,” he told Dean. “It was going to be a nice surprise for you all. But it all went wrong.”
“And you know what the best thing is, don’t you?” Dean gave Cas a sly glance.
“Oh – nothing,” said Dean, quickly.
make next? We’ve all made mistakes – and most of them have done a lot more damage than one kitchen. This isn’t about that. This is about Jack, our
“Jack, I…” Dean trailed off, as if at a loss for words. “Jack, I’m really sorry if I’ve ever made you think that. Of
“It’s going to be fine,” he told him. “I promise.”
“I… I was trying trying to cook. In the kitchen,” said Jack, forcing the words out. “I made… a bit of a mess. Well. A lot of a mess.” He hoped that Sam wouldn’t get angry, too. “Dean got mad. And then Cas got mad at
“Oh. Right. Do you need some help?”
“As for me,” said Dean, “I… I know I’m not always the best at showing it. I guess I’m still trying to figure it all out. I don’t know, maybe it’s still new to me – that whole unconditional love thing. Maybe I didn’t get enough of it when I was a kid myself. Maybe… I don’t know. But the point is, you’ll always be our kid. Whatever you do.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Dean. “Not in the grand scheme of things. I shouldn’t… I shouldn’t have got angry like that.” He thought about it, and added, “I
Jack was getting into cooking now, and baking especially. He’d got a book of cake recipes for his birthday, and he’d started trying them out – simple ones at first, and then gradually the more complicated, more delicious-looking ones as he gained confidence. He always followed the recipes to a T, nowadays – and they usually worked out quite well.
“I know he is.”
“Yes, please.”
Without thinking, Jack took a step back. He felt suddenly dizzy; like there was a haze in his head, red and prickling. Then suddenly Cas was there behind him, a protective hand on his shoulder.
“I thought I’d make some smoothies,” he said, when he saw Jack watching him. “You had them before, Jack?”
“No…” Dean agreed slowly, then, feeling the need to clarify, added, “You’re not a bear. That is true. Though thinking about it,” he added, as if trying to lighten the mood, “You could probably, like, use your angel powers to turn yourself into one. If you really wanted to. Can angels do that? Or, you know, nephilims?” He stared off into the distance, and then, suddenly remembering who he was talking to, very quickly and firmly added, “
“No, it’s not,” said Cas. They’d reached Jack’s room; Cas sat him down in a chair, brought over the comic Jack had been reading that morning and set it beside him.
It was past eight by now, and soon Sam came into the kitchen, looking bleary-eyed and slightly moody. It didn’t seem like he’d had much sleep either.
“Right,” said Dean; he sounded properly irritated now, probably partly from lack of sleep. “That’s how it is, Cas? You’re giving me the cold shoulder? Seriously?”
“I don’t know. The recipe said I needed one.”
. He looked up at Dean, who was just standing there, frozen mid-sentence.
“Well, you know… she’s important to you,” Dean mumbled.
“A bit. But I do just like baking.”
“And if he doesn’t, I’ll make him see. I’ll have another word. I can be very formidable when I want to be.”
They ate every bite. And actually, it tasted surprisingly nice.
, technically, only four.) Through everything, Jack had almost never shed a tear. Until now.
“No, I’m not!” Jack said, quickly un-squinting himself. “Why are you still here, anyway? I thought you were making dinner.”
like you. He -”
He managed to get through 27 different tongue twisters.
Jack took the marmalade off the shelf and had another look at it. He was pleased to have it, despite himself. Maybe he’d keep it there, above his bed. That way, whenever he felt too lonely, he could look at it and remember that Dean
sound a bit more cheerful about it,” he said. “That was another hour-long drive there and back! – Not that I minded, really,” he added quickly. “It was nice, taking Baby out for a spin again. I don’t get out as much now we’ve retired from hunting. But, you know. A lot of petrol. All for one jar of marmalade for you.”
what Dean had told Cas – but he had a pretty good idea, even if it was only from his four years of experience. Because Dean
“And Dean will understand,” said Cas. “Anyone can make a mistake – he knows that.”
“Is that why you’ve been scared about talking to Cas?”
Jack, Dean and Cas watch the second Paddington movie
“I felt sorry for it!” Cas said very earnestly, when Dean complained. “Once upon a time that owl was living its life in peace, not causing any harm, and its life was taken just so it could be stuffed and kept as an ornament. And then to be discarded, as though its death didn’t even matter? The best thing we can do now is honour it.”
Cas seemed to have stopped giving Dean the cold shoulder by now – or at least, they were acting normal around Jack, though he couldn’t help noticing that Cas made a point of steadfastly defending Jack whenever Dean, or Sam as a matter-of-fact, said even the slightest thing against him. But Dean had been consistently nice to Jack over the last few days, deliberately so Jack thought. He probably didn’t want to risk getting on the wrong side of Cas again.
“We all did it together,” Jack said.
“You all right?” Dean asked. “You’re doing the squint thing. You know, the one Cas does.”
hate you. And you’re – you’re you. You’re my kid. I
“We didn’t say anything to you,” Cas pointed out.
“What?” There was a pause; then Dean said, dismissively, “Don’t be silly. Jack knows… Cas, you’re blowing this out of proportion. Jack can take it. I’ve said plenty of worse things to him before.”
love Cas – just like Mr Brown loved Mrs Brown in the
many normal families like that himself, families where both parents were alive and still got on. But Dean and Cas were both still alive.
For a moment, Dean just looked at him. Jack stood still, dreading what he was going to say. Then, he felt Cas squeezing his arm again, comfortingly and protectively. He looked up, and saw that Cas was staring right back at Dean. It looked suspiciously like a Paddington Bear Hard Stare.
warm – he could probably use his powers to stop the water from burning him, if he really wanted. But before he had chance to even think about doing so, Dean was back, tapping at his arm.

turn out to be evil vampire gremlin bees,” he said.
Jack was still waiting patiently for Dean to answer the question, head tilted slightly in a very Cas-like way. Dean couldn’t help laughing, despite everything.

It was about all the many different things that had built up in Jack’s four short years on the planet. And the thick shadow that had slowly been formed, hanging between them.
“I was going to tidy everything up,” he said in small voice; but now it sounded useless, ingenuine, like an excuse. “I wanted to…” He trailed off.
“I found a video about it on the internet!” Jack said. “You can make your clothes change colour!”
“He must have meant what he said about you, too,” Jack said. “If it was his true happiness.”
“Well, you know what they say, second time’s the charm,” he said, going back to the door.
“Dean -” Cas began, his voice unusually stern, but Dean wasn’t done.
“I won’t,” said Jack. “Not by myself.”
has you upset?”
Jack. Must be nice to know you’ll always have someone around – both of you.”
I hope you all enjoyed this! I have no idea how the whole story ended up so long - fun fact, my entire inspiration for this fic was actually the idea of Dean giving Jack a Paddington Bear coat and him matching Cas. And then I started thinking about how many parallels there actually were between Jack and Paddington, and somehow that snowballed into... this. Anyway, I really hope you all liked reading this!
“Well, we can do without your surprises in future.” Suddenly, so abruptly it made Jack jump, Dean reached for the large bin; dragged it over to the stove, reached out his arm and shoved everything in – the gloopy mess of oranges, the melted saucepan, the still-unoped bags of sugar – all of it. After a second, he added the jam-jars, too – swept them right off the surface. Jack flinched as they landed, smashing loudly together.
Suddenly, Cas was standing in front of him again. “Jack and I can finish up here,” he said to Dean, and once again, his voice was cold. “You should go to bed. Get some sleep.”
But then Dean patted him on the shoulder. “He’s right, you know,” he said; and he sounded like he really meant it.
He wasn’t like Jack. Not really. Paddington Bear was a bear. And Jack was just a kid – a kid who hadn’t even lasted as God for more than five minutes. (After accidentally starting a global pandemic whilst trying too hard to befriend a group of Chinese bats who wanted magic powers, it had been agreed by everyone that it was better if Jack let Amara take over the job for a while).
But Dean must have picked up the despondant tone of his voice, because he quickly shook his head. “No, no – it’s fine. It’s just – that’s kind of a loaded question, Jack. It’s… it’s complicated.”
In the end, all three of them made the marmalade together. They did it while Sam and Eileen were out, so that it would be a surprise for them. Dean let Jack use his extra-special secret cupboard to hide all the supplies.
! And…” He gave a choking gasp. “Dean’s going to be so angry. Dean’s going to
He seemed to be directing the question mostly at Cas; but Cas didn’t answer. Instead, he looked to Jack. He was taking his lead, Jack suddenly realised. Seeing how Jack felt before he decided whether to make up with Dean.
It turned out that the brown bear was called Paddington. It wasn’t always his name – not from the start. At first he was just a bear, who had to travel halfway across the world because his Aunt Lucy sent him away. Jack watched as Paddington stood at the station, with his suitcase and the sign around his neck, waiting for somebody to notice him.
Hope you're enjoying this so far! And again, sorry about how angsty this batch of chapters has been - it does get lighter from now on. Like I said, I've got the whole story written now, so I'll post the next couple of chapters on Wednesday!
carefully this time, to dissolve the molecules of the hardened metal, so that it melted down enough to be wiped, with a cloth, off the counters and wherever else it had landed. They were making much better leeway with it than Dean had done.

“He made a mistake,” said Cas. “Just like we all do. But the way you were just now? What you said? That wasn’t the Dean I respect, the Dean I… care for. That was cruel.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean said gruffly. “I thought I’d make a head start.”
“Junk food, mainly,” Dean admitted. “All the stuff Sam tries to lecture me about and Cas tries to steal. Used to always keep a few beers here, too – and some stronger stuff, especially back when Cas was in the Empty. But that’s another story – one you definitely don’t need to hear. Anyway, I think I’m done with all that. Who needs alcohol when you’ve got a kid who makes you home-made marmalade, eh?”
, too.

broken. It just needs… a bit of cleaning. All right?”
“We did it together,” said Dean now. “Teamwork, that was. And you know what? We did a damn good job. And I couldn’t have done it without you.”
“Yes, I am,” said Cas, coldly, matter-of-factly. “You know, when Jack came and got me, do you know what he felt worst about? It wasn’t that the recipe he’d been planning all day had gone wrong, or the mess he’d made – though it was obvious he felt terrible about both. It was how you’d react. He was so scared of what you’d think that he could barely breathe. And I told him he was worrying over nothing, I told him of course you’d see it was just a mistake, of course you’d go easy on him. Because I’ve known you for twelve years now; I know you better than Jack does. Or at least I thought I did.”
“It’s a Hard Stare,” said Jack, calmly. “Paddington Bear gives them to people when they’ve forgotten their manners.”
“Yeah,” said Dean. “Me too.”
For a few seconds Jack just stood there, staring, frozen. Then his brain kicked into gear. This was bad. This was very bad. This was…
“What’s going on in there?” Dean’s voice called from somewhere in the landing. “It’s 3am - you’re making enough noise to wake the dead!”
“So you’ll tell him, then?” Jack persisted.
what you had in mind…”
“Yeah,” said Jack, because it would be obvious he was lying if he kept quiet. Cautiously, Dean pushed the door open.
“We could give it a funeral,” said Dean. “Bury it in the garden or something.”
“Hey – Jack’s not going anywhere!” said Dean. “He’s staying and clearing up the mess he’s made.”
“Are you all right, Jack?” Cas asked him. He was showing Jack how to use his grace,
Jack looked up. He’d been panicking, breathing too quickly. Somehow, Cas had managed to put the fire out, but the kitchen still looked awful. Really, really, really bad.
“Jack?” Tentatively, Dean put his arm around him.
, though he wasn’t quite sure how, or where.

much, which concerned Jack slightly. At one point, when he was chasing Paddington and the Browns across a moving train, he even full-on cheered him on – at least until he saw the looks Cas and Jack were giving him and hastily apologised. But he seemed to be enjoying the movie, which made Jack happy. It was always hit-or-miss when it came to what movies Dean liked – he had some strong opinions.
Anyway, it was time to add the oranges. He dumped them in; flinched as some of the water splashed out of the pan, sizzling slightly – it really was hot. But it was fine.
long. And I’m sure we can all think of something to do in the meantime.”
“You looked for parenting advice for Claire?” Cas asked, sounding like he had the very opposite of a problem with it.
“I don’t know. Just – when I’m bored, sometimes,” Dean said, defensively. “There was this columnist who wrote this thing about bonding with stroppy teenagers – I thought it might be useful for Claire, okay? And then I… I don’t know. I just liked the way they wrote. Got a problem with that?”
say,” said Dean, rolling his eyes affectionately. “But still, what is it Jack wants with
“Who’d have thought it, eh?” Dean commented one day, coming in while Jack was attempting to roll up a swiss roll. “The former God himself, giving Gordon Ramsay a run for his money. Or… what’s the baking guy called again? Paul Hollywood?”
“As long as it doesn’t all go wrong again.”
“Now,” said Dean, “You have to wait for the water to bubble. That’s when you know it’s boiling. That’s when you turn down the heat.”
“He’s my dad. I wasn’t going to let him stay there.”
repeat that.”
“Look, Jack,” said Dean. “You’ve done some pretty amazing things in your four years. Things anyone ten times your age would be proud of. You can boil some oranges. You’ll see.”
This time, Dean didn’t say anything. He just nodded; he was frowning. He gave Cas a long look that Jack couldn’t quite read; then he picked up his phone and went.
“But?” Dean prompted.
Jack nodded uncertainly.
, doesn’t mean you should feel bad,” said Cas.
“Cas -” Jack started; but Cas just swept him further along the hall, face set. “Go to your room,” he said; he put his hand on Jack’s arm, his voice softening just a tad; then he turned round and strode back to the kitchen, purposeful as ever.
that was how it worked. He hadn’t come across
“But I… I always let you down,” said Jack. “Every single time. No matter how hard I try. And it makes you angry.”
“That…” Dean stuttered. “You’re really asking all the difficult questions today, huh? Is that another version of Paddington Bear Hard Stares? Firing all these questions at me and making me answer? I mean, I’m not saying I don’t deserve it, but…”
“That is one clear advantage that angels have over bears,” said Cas. “Not the most obvious one you’d think of, perhaps, but it’s certainly useful.”
“Yes.” Cas’s voice had also gone up in volume. It was tight; angry. “And that’s the problem, isn’t it?”
Dean waited for Jack to take off his protective gloves and wash his hands, and then he said, “Look! You’re gonna love this.”
alarmed. The thing was, knowing Cas and Jack, it could be anything, from some sort of blackberry soup to some sort of deadly potion.
They walk through the milling camels over to one of the pools, and sure enough the eyes and snout of a crocodile are visible in the black water. It flips its tail lazily and disappears underwater. Cas walks over to the canyon wall and sits at the base, leaning back against the newly sun-warmed rock. Dean follows suit, and they sit in silence, watching the camels.
Kansas born with a geological engineering degree from KSU, and most of his working life as a  petroleum production engineer (so far) in Oklahoma and Texas with a brief foray up to Alaska, and a wild summer in the Foothills just outside of Calgary, Alberta, means that Arabic is not something he’s even conversant in or with. English is the language of science, so communication at work is not a problem. He thinks that maybe some language lessons are in order though if he’s going to take any more contracts in north Africa or the Middle East. Though learning a new language at 35 isn’t going to be any kind of a picnic.
he do about it? As much as this bothers him, and to be honest it bothers him a lot more than it should at such short acquaintance with Dean, there isn’t much he can do. Time to get Gabe and get out of here before someone else finds out about the bride or discovers that he and his brother don’t belong here.
“I think I got this,” Dean says.
“I thought you ‘didn’t believe in luck, good or bad’?” Cas says, grabbing his hand as they walk toward the Impala.
“Yeah and now you’re hungover.”
“It is. It kills a lot of kids.” Cas puts his hand up to the back of his head and hisses in pain. “I’m pretty sure I’ve got a concussion. I can’t drive back to Fada tonight. I need someplace to stay until I’m sure I’m okay and the symptoms go away. I’d tell you to fuck off but I kind of need your help this time.”
Dean’s about to argue, again, but he changes course and grins, while wiping his eyes. “Yeah, that was kinda like the splash zone in a dolphin show, wasn’t it?” He pushes the bowl away. “I’m sorry Cas. I just have the feeling that we missed something at the high school. The swim coach was setting off my radar, but I didn’t look any deeper.”
They leave the main building and walk past the hot pools and the Finnish sauna down a path that leads to an octagonal building. Through the windows Dean can see people relaxing in chairs around a central, glass-fronted fireplace. Beyond is the edge of the woods, a broken piece of caution tape hanging dispiritedly from a wooden stake beside a roll of snow fencing..
“You love me.” It’s not a question. Dean looks at Cas’s face. A small smile curves his lips and his eyes are shining. Holy crap, he feels it too.
Dean groans. “That’s a lot of driving, and I feel like crap.”
“Jeez, I’m sure I was a lot more pleasant the morning after the last time we slept together.” Cas stops grinning when he notices the pain evident on Dean’s face. He hands Dean another Vicodin from the big first aid kit along with the canteen to wash them down. “There are some granola bars and dates in my backpack if you’re hungry, but the cooler that had the rest of the food in it got stolen along with the gas and water.”
“Activity?”
“Where were you hiding that knife? Surely not in your swim trunks. That would be dangerous.”
“Why?”
Abandoning his laptop, he pulls a stack of first-year mineralogy papers towards him, and with a sigh, starts to mark them. His office door opens abruptly, swinging back to hit the wall with a bang, and a small, dark-haired woman marches into the room. From the look on her face, she’s got a head of steam up about something, and he’s sure it doesn’t mean anything good for him.
. Unsure what to do next, and worried about Cas, he makes his way towards the mess tent, stopping as two more men come out of the door about ten yards ahead of him. They have rifles strapped over their shoulders and their arms are full of boxes, their backs to him as they walk away, towards the melée. They stop for a minute and put the boxes down to redistribute the contents.
“About twelve kilometres, give or take.”
“Why did you meet with Issa in the Bucket?”
, the aurora borealis or the northern lights, have always fascinated people since the dawn of time.
“Are we heading back now?” Dean’s voice doesn’t betray how sad he is at the thought of heading back to Fada now. He’s enjoying Cas’s company.
“But the others in the pool —”
“What the fuck, Cas,” he says to himself as he drops the photo on the kitchen counter on the top of the small pile that contains photos of a Russian Blue (medicine cabinet), Maine Coon (armory, right beside the salt rounds), Burmese (leaning against the salt and pepper shakers on the table), Scottish Fold (taped to the last beer in the fridge), and Persian (its smushed face startling Dean when he opened his laptop to find it on the keyboard.) How many Cat Fancy magazines have given their lives so that Cas can drop unsubtle hints that he wants a cat?
Cas worries his lower lip between his teeth for a second. Despite the pain and lightheadedness, Dean is mesmerized watching it, remembering what those lips felt like pressed against his own. The sensation of Cas’s teeth nipping at his lip and...
coming Dean? Did you? Did you even have the
“Something my mom used to say. Well, according to my dad.” They’d stood there for a moment like that, Cas holding Dean’s hands. Dean wondered why he didn’t want to pull them away, to stuff them in his pockets, to move away from Cas. Why he wanted to pull Cas closer.
. Dean’s going to have to disagree with that.
“What the hell do you think you were doing walking around in the dark? Didn't you hear the bear bangers?” the man demands angrily. He’s breathing heavily.
“Don’t mention it,” says Dean.
Dean searches around frantically for the katana.
He turns to Cas. “The patrol’s already alerted. They’ll chase him out of town or he’ll go to bear jail for the night.”
Dean had forgotten how earnest Cas had been. How eager to help, to be useful. And how that had tugged at his heartstrings.
hopes. It’s good, whatever it is, and they wolf them down, hungry from the walk into the canyon.
“You, old man.”
“I get it. It’s the circle of life. But do they have to be so fucking loud?” Dean moves the pillow from over his face to behind his head. He props himself up and looks over at Cas. It’s an appealing view. Messy hair and Clark Kent glasses, his face serious in his focus on the book. He’s fucking adorable. Dean starts to think that maybe not being able to sleep might be a feature, not a bug, of this whole frog situation. Dean reaches across under the covers and runs his toes down the side of Cas’s calf. He makes his voice sultry. “Didn’t know you were such a frog sex expert, Cas.”
The New Year’s Eve party is small, exclusive. The tables in the dining room are set for 50. A manageable number of people for Sam to keep an eye on. Probably more like 60 counting the caterers and waitstaff. White twinkly lights and centrepieces of white orchids and roses create an elegant backdrop. It’s hard not to feel conspicuous with the sword hidden inside the leather jacket that he’s resisted several attempts by staff to take away and hang up.
It’s not about missing Cas’s chatter in the silences that Sam can’t fill, it’s not about missing eating together in the bunker’s kitchen, it’s not missing someone to banter with about music while packing salt rounds. It’s all these and none of them. It’s missing
“Yeah, well this is a road trip, and music is mandatory. Not gonna listen to someone talking about elephant poaching or Senate reform on a day like today, out on the open road.” He grins at Cas, then launches into the chorus with Mick.
Cas opens the door again. "Come on. You said you wanted to go see the surprise cool place. I'm your tour guide.” He pauses, “It’s not a date, I promise." He grins, and Dean surveys his faded black AC/DC tee and worn-looking cargo shorts through gummy eyelids. Cas's calves are nice. Firm-looking.
The quiet of the night is broken by the sound of someone (something?) shuffling through the snow behind him, and then a soft whuffing grunt.
news, Cas. It means you’re getting over Michael.”
And it helps to keep me warm
were the one who—” But Cas shuts him up with a kiss, and that’s the last talking they do for quite a while.
“No, don’t look at me like that. I was there when you were putting yourself back together after Michael. You were getting better, and now you’re back to square one again. So I figure it’s another man,” she breaks off as the waiter refills their coffee cups and smiles her thanks.
Dean makes a face to himself. Victor sounds all Obi-Wan:
“What?”
“How long are you gonna hold Meg and me for? Have you even contacted anyone about a ransom?” Dean gets right up in Mashaya’s face. The four men playing cards over by the vehicles get to their feet.
Dean’s stunned. The look on his own face when he finally finds Cas, gets his arms around him, it’s a revelation. That’s not just relief on his face, it’s something much, much more. He’s stuck thinking about this, and only Jo’s impatient elbow in his ribs draws his attention back to the scene before him. He’s missed some of the conversation, but he remembers what’s next, him begging Cas to come with Benny and him and escape Purgatory.
“Oh come on, it’s funny. Isn’t it funny?” she asks Claire, who’s come to Cas’s office to walk with him to the convention centre where the mining conference is taking place. It’s a nice day, sunny and cool, and Cas wants to spend some time in the fresh air on the half hour walk before giving his talk. Get rid of his jitters.
“Jess was my friend first, before she started dating Sam. We used to watch
starts, and Cas smiles at him. Dean’s chest feels impossibly full, like something is blossoming inside, taking up all the space.
Cas had said, “We should go in. You’re going to get frostbite.”
“Do you think I’m unhappy here?” Cas’s tone is incredulous.
“True. So you’re only responsible for me for…” Cas checks his watch. “Eight hours, which means you’re off the clock at 8:30.”
feeling in his chest loosens.
A short time later, Cas stops the jeep in the lee of a rock wall. “We walk from here.” he says. They get out of the jeep and Cas grabs a canteen and foil-wrapped packages out of the cooler and puts it all in his backpack.  “Come on, we’re burning daylight.”
“Oh God no. He’s my older brother.” Dean smiles at the distaste in Cas’s voice, and then seems to remember this isn’t a smiling situation. Cas hurriedly adds, “If it’s any consolation, I thought you were the groom.”
Sam’s in the den watching TV. He looks up as Dean heads past. “Need help with anything?” he asks.
Dean remembers the conversation he had with Youssef in Faya-Largeau:
“Yeah? Watch me.”
Dean turns to her “Okay Jo. Okay. Stop. I get it. Really.” He takes a deep breath. “Say it’s true. Say I do love him. How do I know he feels the same way? How can I take the chance, tell him? I mean, if he just feels protective of me, or thinks we’re buddies or whatever, what then?
“Keep looking.” Cas turns on the bedside lamp. “Did they both contract?”
Dean decides to do what he can to help Cas and the soldiers during those five minutes. He limps across the camp to where Mashaya is standing talking to Youssef and another man.
“It covers four or five square kilometers. We’ve got plenty of room to avoid them if we’re lucky. Come on, let’s go.”
Dean looks peeved. “Well that’s not fair, I only figured it out just now.” He looks down at the hex wrench that’s still in his hands. “Soooo, how are you feeling about moving in here?”
This leads him to two epiphanies. 1. Cas sincerely wants to punch anyone who insists that there are no problems, only opportunities. And 2. he’s managed to fall for someone who he has no reasonable expectation of ever finding again.
“Past Ounianga Kébir. Up on the plateau, east of the mountains. There’s an oilfield up there I’m going to be working at.”
“When I saw you talking to Youssef the night of the raid, that was worse than getting kicked.”
! Eggnog, whiskey, visitors, hospitality, good will toward men. All that good stuff.”
, he thinks.
Cas smiles at her again (
“It looked like you were kissing Michael. Not ten minutes after you were kissing me.”
just a flesh wound. Really. It’s gonna hurt like fuck, but you’re going to be ok. The bullet just grazed you.”
“Um.” Cas had been thinking a lot, too, but the questions he’d come up with had been a lot more existential. And, he realized, a lot more selfish. He’d been so wrapped up in how much it affected him, but of course it was just as big a deal for Jimmy to learn about his father.
?” he called out, adorably grumpy.
“Do you think there are more prisoners on board?” Sam muttered over the CommsBud. Even through the helmets, Dean could see how pale his brother was.
Dean sent Sam forward to scout. Occasionally, Sam had called back something like, “Nevermind, not human!” or “Redhead!”
“We can talk more at breakfast?” Cas suggested.
Then Dean led him outside and into the vineyard. Cas hadn’t really gotten a good look at the land around the house the day before; it was beautiful. Rolling hills covered in vines, bright sky and sunlight, it was like nothing he’d ever seen. Struck, he stopped and stared for long enough that Dean noticed he was no longer behind him and turned, catching him staring.
Cas continued to look at him, puzzled creases around his eyes, and Dean remembered Cas’s reaction to him helping Tracy from her partial zone, how he’d started and stopped himself from saying something about it. He had to ask, “What did you think guides did?”
That was possibly more information than he knew how to handle. On top of his other concerns, he was starting to worry that Jimmy hadn’t provided a full enough picture of his family to prepare Cas to meet them.
“You’re the agents I’m supposed to meet?”
He shrugged nonchalantly.
“I told you to call me Junior!” Despite the late night and significant amount of alcohol they knew Junior had had, he didn’t look much the worse for wear that morning. Still, Dean couldn’t be sure if his snap irritation at Novak’s unwanted formality was the fault of a concealed hangover or just how he was as a person. Either way, he hoped Novak didn’t push it. They knew the guy was volatile enough to murder his lover over an argument, and he only had a single evening’s attachment to the two of them.
The downside was that it was lined with bars, leading to little dirty cells. The upside was that most of them were empty. The caveat, though . . .
“Cas, come on, bro!”
Over food, they talked about plans for the birthday celebration tomorrow. Cas and Jimmy had had the foresight to discuss those, so Cas knew that Jimmy was expecting breakfast and presents in bed then a trip to the zoo, and Jimmy knew that Cas was expecting Chuck to be in phone meetings most of the day, then they would go out for dinner at Cas’s favorite diner. Cas had never actually been to the zoo at home. It hadn’t been a priority when he was younger—or really even possible, between the money and organization needed to make it happen—and by the time that changed with Chuck’s moderate success and sobriety, Cas had been old enough to worry about the ethics of it all. He’d heard plenty of horror stories about terrible places with abused and neglected animals, but Jimmy promised the one they would take Cas to wasn’t one of those.
Balthazar still didn’t answer. But after he’d pulled Cas past a few more tables, he shoved him at a chair that was empty and pushed back from the table. The plate in front of it had a roll and croutons on it already, which meant Balthazar had been sitting there and serving himself before he suddenly sprang up to find Cas.
proud of herself. Dork.
“Sam, take Charlie and go set the Nav to Zeta-362 while Dean sets the boosters,” Cas barreled on.
Since they hadn’t, Cas was looking out for anyone who looked like the general descriptions Jimmy had given him of two women and two boys. It only took him a minute to find Jody—to find his mom, standing outside her car a few rows back from the main throng. Jimmy’s description helped, but the marked Sheriff’s car was what really made her stand out. As soon as she saw Cas looking her way, picking out the moment with precision despite the distance, she smiled and raised her hand in a casual wave that confirmed her identity for Cas.
Shrugging, he plucked a bottle and peered down at the label. Frowned. Squinted and pulled it closer. Gave up, “I . . . can’t.”
Back at the house, Castiel was waiting where Dean had left him. But he had a stack of notebooks in one hand and his dollhouse in the other, which was all the proof Dean needed that he was done being a fucking moron. Junior, Adler, and the other asshole were still out. He should’ve told Lafitte to send medics, too, but he hadn’t been sure how to word it and honestly none of them were worth the time of figuring it out.
For as long as he lived, Dean would be haunted by Sam’s vacant stare and the thin trickles of blood dripping from his eyes, his ears, his mouth and nose. And right there on the inside of his elbow, still linked in when Dean found him, was the exact same port as Cas had hidden beneath seemingly innocuous skin. It was Dean’s greatest failure, as a guide and as a brother. He’d let Sammy die.
“How about,” Sam picked up the train. “How about, a week on suspended access?”
“Castiel—god.” Jody’s eyes welled up and she took Cas’s face between her palms. “My little Castiel. I thought I’d never see you again. Look at you. I’ve missed you every single day of your life.”
, for asking you to, what? Act like a human being? Is that the delusion you’ve been harboring?”
Cas has literally no chill
Take-offs were always smoother from Oziome.
“Yes, Bravo.”
He reached out and placed a hand on Cas’s shoulder, “I’m gonna take a nap, yeah? Projectile vomiting for three hours straight takes it out of a guy.”
Next to him, Cas shook his head resolutely, diverting his attention to the lock and punching in his code. “ASTERIA, we’ll be back soon,” he called.
“Dumbass,” Bobby sniffed, drawing Dean into a firm hug. Dean’s eyes fell shut. The old man reeked of grime and sweat and whiskey. It was nauseating. But he didn’t mind. “You take care of Sam and Cas out there, okay?”
“Yes,” Cas answered, stepping around him.
“Delta check,” Sam called tentatively, as if he’d heard every word. “So . . .”
“And that time she coerced you into a jungle safari and then into getting lost in said jungle because she wanted to separate from the tour group.”
“What’s her name?” His voice was shakier than he wanted it to be, but given the circumstances he thought he could be forgiven how much anger pounded in his veins. Balthazar’s hand closing around his wrist to give a supportive squeeze said he thought so, too. “Your—my—our mom. What’s her name?”
“Fine,” Rowena shrugged. “But you two should, ahꟷ
“Mm-hm,” he hummed, flipping open the book and finding his place. “Good talk, little Freud.”
The man in question stared at him, eyebrows scrunched up mournfully. Then he turned to Sam with a sincere smile, “I am. Hi, Sam.”
“Breakfast sounds great.”
“Exactly,” she hummed. He quirked an eyebrow inquisitively. She made the low tutting sound. “These are not mine or Charlie’s, Bravo.”
direction. After a frustrating minute of trying to flatten the cowlick, he stared at himself in the little mirror embedded in the wall. A zombie cosplayer stared back.
The Tran house looked like every other house in its neighborhood: whitewashed concrete and reinforced plexi windows, corn-plastic grass behind steel and concrete gates. Linda Tran, Kevin’s mother, greeted them at the door with a businesslike, “You’re going to find my son.” It was much more command than question and Dean appreciated the just-about vote of confidence after the rest of the day’s bullshit.
The engine whined.
,” Charlie echoed.
“That’s so crazy.”
That was addressed to Dean. That was Novak, the scratch of his fingers in Dean’s hair taking on a pattern of four beats before going back to directionless circling. That was something Dean needed to answer. He finished pulling himself together, still feeling like a mess in so many ways, and let Novak push him up by the arm and chest to help him back to standing. Novak stayed seated and didn’t let go of Dean’s wrist, and though Dean could tell Novak was looking up at him, his own gaze was fixed on the paddle in Novak’s other hand.
All the different parts, because after he realized he didn’t have to be scared or ashamed, Cas was just as intense and determined in pleasuring Dean as he had been in everything else. Dean was licked and sucked and bitten, and he had to fight a bit to be able to return the favor—Cas, with his cybernetically backed muscles, let him win that fight but only for a little while before getting single-minded about his own explorations. Dean let him have that, because it was all new to Cas and he wanted him to feel good about it, to feel confident and in control.
“Dude, we’ll become mush!” Sam added. He turned to Dean, “You know what happened to the last humans who went into hyperdrive?”
“Identify yourself, citizen,” Cas intoned. He stood in the middle of the road, his wings still partly open like an afterthought; like it was a perfectly normal thing.
“Nice work!” he said. “I guess all those tongue-twisters came in useful after all.”
“Jack? You in there?”
Jack decided to make the marmalade at night, so as not to disturb anyone. Dean liked to have the kitchen to himself when he was making dinner, and since he’d started hunting less he’d taken to making long, elaborate meals he would hog the kitchen the whole afternoon for. He always got irritable when people got in the way, especially Jack.
“Quality time” had become one of Cas’s new catchphrases over the past few days. He’d learnt the term from one of Dean’s parenting articles. Dean was starting to regret having shown them to Cas – he was taking a rather
“Well,” said Sam, “I’m sure glad one of us did.”
So Dean shrugged, reached out to ruffle Cas’s hair in a way that made him glare slightly, and left. Jack went on reading his comic. He could tell Cas was still watching him, in that way that parents did, in Jack’s limited experience, watch over their kids, but Jack didn’t bring up the oranges again and so neither did Cas. And an hour later there they were, dumped casually on the table in front of him by Dean.
There was a silence as Dean looked at Jack, waiting for an answer. Jack knew he was supposed to speak; he knew it was his responsibility to; but he couldn’t get the words out.
Dean knocked again. “Jack?”
Hope you're enjoying this so far! I've decided to put it into multiple chapters because it's already getting way longer than I intended, so look out for the next update (probably not for a while, since I'm really busy with uni coursework, but I'll try to get it out soon.) Feel free to leave feedback - I love hearing from you all!
“Well, all right then, I guess,” said Dean, shooting Cas a quizzical look, as if he might give him a clue as to what Jack was on about. Cas just stared right back, face neutral.
But then there were all the little things. Like the Paddington Bear coat. And the marmalade they’d made together. The photo in Dean’s room. And the way Dean actually made an effort, more and more often nowadays, to speak to Jack about things like this, make sure he felt loved and appreciated. Lots of little things like that. And in a way, that was all they were – little things, misscelaneous scraps, like patches on a quilt, chapters in a children’s book. But every one of them made that knot deep in Jack’s chest ease slightly more. And they came so regularly now, that they were starting to feel consistent. Almost like something that could be depended on.
will. Hey, wouldn’t it be dumb if after everything, one of us died of being allergic to bee-stings? Or, actually, I wouldn’t put it past us to somehow get our hands on a batch of evil vampire gremlin bees, or -”
There was a sudden CRASH and the whole pan exploded: oranges, water and all. The water splattered all over the room, sizzling like mad. The oranges exploded into pithy bits, landing all over the kitchen. And the metal of the pan, it went disintegrated – some of it melting into a goop all over the oven, some bits of it flying through the kitchen to land on different surfaces, cupboards, tables and all, sticking there like chewing gum.
He’d already emptied the bin-bag from the night before. He’d already cleaned all the bits of exploded oranges off the counters, and the ceiling, and the floor. Everything from Jack’s unfortunate attempt at making marmalade was gone. Everything except the fire damage, the really bad stuff.
“I found this recipe online,” said Sam. “Carrot and ginger? It looked really good.”
“So did I,” said Cas. “He seemed to have a very good idea of the things that are important in life. Marmalade, kindness and Hard Stares. I’d say that’s as good a set of values to have as any.”
great company. Thanks, all of you. No, really. But I think I’m gonna… Bye.”
this.”
, then?” Jack asked. “Because if you haven’t, then… then it’s just between you and
Jack nodded slightly sheepishly. “Sorry about the hard stare,” he said.
“You’re four years old,” Cas retorted, as if that trumped any argument of Jack’s.
So they did. They had it in front of the TV, while they all watched the first
“I wanted to see what all the fuss was about,” he said, plonking himself down on the sofa so he was practically sitting on top of Cas. Cas scooshed over slightly to make more room. For a millisecond, Dean looked slightly put out, before quickly set his face back to normal, presumably realising it wasn’t a normal reaction to have to someone not wanting to be squashed.
Jack was the one who stirred up the mixture and squeezed out all the flavour. He did a
, they’ll see – well, just look!”
He rubbed Jack’s back, trying to calm him down, but Jack was still sobbing piteously.
But before he did, he turned to Jack; looked right at him, his face serious. “I really am sorry,” he said. Then he turned round and walked out of the kitchen.
– because it had been Cas’s choice, to cash in on the deal he’d made. It hadn’t been about Jack. Not really.
It was obviously supposed to be funny, and Jack did find himself laughing as Paddington flooded the house or somehow ended up attatched to a moving car on a skateboard, but he couldn’t help feeling sorry for the bear. Especially when Mr Brown tried, again and again, to send him away, or when Paddington wrote to Aunt Lucy about how different London was from how he’d expected, how cold and unfriendly everyone was.
“I don’t know,” said Cas. “What mistakes do you think
“What the
. Why could he never just do the right thing?
Dean seemed to think about it properly, as if Jack had said something important, something
Cas smiled slightly at the sudden change in Jack’s expression. “That sounds like a good idea,” he said. “I’ll help you.”
Again, you can find me on Tumblr at:
“Oh, that’s fine!” said Dean. “It’ll still taste the same, right? Who cares if it looks a bit sloppy?”
“Morning to you all too,” said Dean, sitting down at the end of the table.
“You’re right about that.”
Cas and Jack were in the kitchen when he came home. They were huddled over a bucket of some sort of ambiguous neon purple coloured water. With lumps in it.
“Don’t you think that’s what I was doing?” Dean was speaking louder now, frustrated.
It occurred to him that it had been quite a while and Dean hadn’t answered his question yet. His brows were furrowed; he looked slightly alarmed, like he’d been trapped in a corner he didn’t really want to be trapped in. Jack started to think that asking that question might have been a mistake. But he’d only been putting together the puzzle pieces. It had felt perfectly reasonable at the time.
“All right, then,” said Dean, slightly grumpily. “If that’s how the two of you want to be, then whatever. None of my business, is it? I’m just the one who drove all the way to the store and back. No-one important.”
So Cas went. Without really meaning to, Jack found himself following behind. He was probably curious, he thought, trying to justify it – or maybe he just wanted to see someone else do a bad job at cooking. So it wouldn’t just be him. Cas looked round, but he didn’t tell Jack to leave – just gave him a small smile, the way he always did.
“I’m glad you see that,” said Cas, his voice still cool. “But I think you’re addressing it to the wrong person.” He put an arm around Jack’s shoulder. “Jack is right here, you know.”
“I just,” said Jack. He stopped, thinking better of it; but Dean nodded at him to go on. “I just… I kind of wanted to make my own marmalade,” Jack admitted.
“And I’m glad we managed to get him back from the Empty.” It had been one of the last things that Jack had done, during his brief stint as God. They’d all worked together, him and Dean and Sam, with a bit of assistance from Rowena, and Claire who’d insisted on being there. They’d found a spell, and Jack had used the last of his powers to open up a portal so that Dean could go in and rescue Cas.
“See the water?” Dean said. “It’ll change. You can watch it – you can even dip your hand in, while it’s still cold. You’ll be able to feel exactly as it gradually gets hotter, see?”
“I didn’t mean to,” said Jack, his breaths still coming out juddery and uneven. He felt close to tears. “I just… I just wanted… I thought it would turn out well. I thought it would be something nice for everyone. But…” He stared around, still feeling slightly awed at the damage. “I’ve broken the kitchen. I’ve
Jack felt slightly lost too. He’d been flicking through Netflix for ages, trying to make up his mind. It was difficult when there were so many options – countless bright images of people or animals, photos or cartoons; all kinds of different genres and stories. He wasn’t really sure what he, himself, was into. He hadn’t grown up with any of the pop-culture knowledge that Sam or Dean seemed to have; didn’t have any of the wisdom that Castiel had. It was all just pictures to him.
“Yeah, well, what if next time he decides to watch, I don’t know… Harry Potter? Decides it would be a
Dean was nodding. “He said some… really nice things about me. About the kind of person he thought I was. And I’ve just been thinking about it, lately – about how much better a lot of it applies to the two of you than it ever could to me. When I think about the way I’ve treated you, sometimes… Because the ironic thing is, if anyone’s like that,
“Well, you’re only four,” Dean said again. “You haven’t had a chance to meet many people.”
After a few endless-seeming seconds, Cas spoke instead. “Jack was trying to make marmalade, and it seems it went… slightly pear-shaped. Jack’s worried you’ll be angry, but I’ve told him that it’s obvious he didn’t mean any harm, and we can clean up the mess -”
to make us like you anymore, don’t you? That’s not your job.”
Thirdly, I always forget to mention it but I'm British! So if I accidentally use the wrong words for things or make the characters speak like Doctor Who characters or something then, um, sorry - and I hope it doesn't take you out of the story too much!
Suddenly, there was the sound of footsteps from the other end of the hall. Jack looked around, trying to find somewhere to hide – but there was nowhere he could really go apart from the kitchen, and that didn’t seem like a particularly great idea right now. So he backed away, trying to make it look
knew what she was doing when she gave him all those bee-keeping books. I should have known it would end in disaster.” He shook his head. Then he added, “Anyway, I’m driving him into town to get the stuff for it later. And we thought you might like to come along.”
“Well, maybe that angel of ours is a bit delusional when it comes to me,” said Dean. “But it’s good to have a goal, right? I can try to be more like that person – from now on. And, you know – I can try to be more like Cas. And actually tell the two of you how great you are. Because you know what? Mistakes, they don’t really matter. Not in the grand scheme of things. What matters is who you are on the inside. And you, Jack – all you ever do is try to do your best; even when it goes wrong, you always do things for the right reasons. You’re Cas’s kid, all right.”
find his tongue-twister recitals slightly annoying. Dean looked round at him.
probably just been so Cas wouldn’t be mad at him anymore.
Dean came in a bit later, just as Sam was handing out the finished smoothies. Jack hadn’t expected it; when the door clattered open he jumped, knocking over his glass, and before he could think, before he could react, there was spilt smoothie all over the table – and him.
They divided up the tasks. Cas washed all the jars. He was very diligent about it. Dean insisted on doing all the chopping up (“I literally used to be God!” Jack insisted again, just in case it was because Dean didn’t trust him around knives (which would be stupid, considering all the monsters he’d fought before); “You’re four,” Dean retorted). But it was Jack who boiled the oranges in the pan – properly, this time.
“I don’t understand this conversation,” said Cas.
All the while Jack stood there, rooted to the spot. He should be helping. He should. He was the one who’d done this. What had he done?! Somehow managed to wreck the whole kitchen, started a fire, he’d just been trying to make marmalade, this was all his fault, and Dean would be so mad, and…
” Cas said, and his voice was colder, more furious than Jack had ever heard it before – at least directed at Dean. “That’s
movies (and books, which Jack had got hold of and started avidly reading), and Sam loved Eileen.
Jack looked at the floor. He wasn’t sure what to say to that – what to think. He tried to push down the small shimmer of pride that was starting to bubble, just slightly, inside him – because Cas was always kind. That was just how dads were supposed to be.
But there was something about that little brown bear, sitting alone with a sign around his neck, that intrigued Jack; so he picked up the remote and clicked.
“How’s your smoothie, Jack?” Cas asked, completely ignoring Dean.
He strode over; pulled a very reluctant Cas up by the shoulders and steered him over to where Jack was. “Look at the two of you – just look at you! You’re like a matched set. This is brilliant - I
have a point there,” Dean admitted eventually, like it was painful to come out with. “But how did we get to this topic anyway? We were meant to be talking about you.”
“I thought we were good,” said Dean, after a moment. “We… we watched
But Cas just turned back to the kitchen, gave Dean another death glare. One that said,
“But I make so many mistakes,” said Jack.
Cas just rolled his eyes.
“I’m fine, I’m not a kid!” Jack said, because Cas was looking at him so carefully. “I was literally God for a while, remember?”
Jack suddenly remembered the broken jar of marmalade. It was still lying splattered on the floor. He’d completely forgotten about
“We’ll see what we can do,” said Dean. “Otherwise, I’m sure we’ll figure out something – even if it’s not quite in the typical way. We usually do.”
“The one they were driving in
dream – I got this pet dragon and we were flying around together, shooting fire at everyone we didn’t like? We took down some demons, and a bunch of the British Men of Letters, and then Chuck… Anyway it was great fun,” she trailed off quickly, as she registered everyone’s sombre faces and suddenly picked up the atmosphere of the room. “So, um. Yeah. I did sleep well, thanks.”
Cas looked up, and saw Jack’s face; he must have guessed the situation, because he rose more quickly and started running, Jack following. He got to the kitchen and stopped in his tracks; Jack tumbled after him, trying to see.
“It’s like the one Paddington Bear wears!” said Jack. He stepped forward; looked at it, head tilted.
Dean and Jack so happy.
“It won’t be much of a surprise now,” said Jack. “Sam and Eileen just have to come in and they’ll know what we’ve been doing.”
They found Dean in front of the oven, surrounded by smoke. He was trying to waft it away while simultaneously pulling out a tray of what Jack guessed might once have been food. It was difficult to tell, because it was now nothing but a row of ambiguous charred black lumps.
“I…” Jack tried to get the words out; trailed off. Dean was still glaring at him, waiting for a response. Jack tried again. “I… I tried to use my powers. To make the temperature higher, so I could heat the marmalade more quickly. But I think I went too far above boiling point. I lost control a bit, and -”
And Jack could pretend, and try not to cause trouble, and try to make Dean like him again; and Dean could pretend too, for Cas’s sake - until the next time Jack messed up. But it wouldn’t make that heavy feeling deep in Jack’s chest go away. It wouldn’t make him feel better – not really.
“Oh,” he said. It was worse than it had been before, if that was even possible. Because he’d forgotten to turn off the flame, and now somehow the fire had grown, and was roaring up the wall and towards the cupboards, the melted metal of the pan oozing slowly further over the oven.
Okay, I guess I lied about not updating this until Wednesday! But AO3 was being annoying and not showing the update properly on the main spn page, so I thought I'd post this little chapter just so people will actually see it! Next chapter really WILL be on Wednesday!
right. I can’t do what I’m told. I can’t stop causing damage, and making everything horrible, and that’s…” He paused, let out a large, juddering breath. “That’s why you hate me,” he finished, quietly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Even when Paddington got sent to jail he brightened the place up right away, dyeing all the prison uniforms pink and getting everyone to bake cakes.
to compare Dean’s burnt cooking to lumps of coal, but it was too late.
“It wasn’t because of you,” said Dean. “It was… it was me. I’m just not quite the person he –” He stopped himself. “But that’s got nothing to do with you.”
Jack started to feel slightly panicked. But it was fine. What he didn’t understand, he’d make up as he went along. He started to boil some water – he knew how to do that, you had to put the flame on really, really high so the water could get hot. Even with the oven on, it seemed to be taking ages though – and the recipe said you had to boil the oranges for a whole hour! He hadn’t thought it would take that long, and there were loads more steps afterwards. It would get really boring, all that waiting.
“And teaches everyone how to make marmalade,” said Jack. “But. Why do you think he goes to prison? I know it’s a mistake, but… people who go to jail, it’s usually because they do something really bad. What if they Browns think that he’s a proper criminal? What if it makes them stop loving him?”
Jack and Cas watched together, laughing at the funny, goofy bits, Cas watching anxiously for Jack’s reaction as Paddington ran away from home because he thought no-one wanted him, and got kidnapped by the evil taxidermist.
“Thank you,” Jack said again. “It was really nice of you. I

“Wait – I need to get a picture of this!” said Dean. He made to get his phone - then paused; looked at the bucket of neon-purple dye, still waiting to be applied. “Later,” he amended. “We’ll get the two of you in all your finery – tie-dye t-shirts and all. Make a proper photo-shoot of it.”
“Quite quickly,” said Jack. He realised he might have understated the situation just slightly.
and all that crap, it’s you. You and Cas. And I should really learn to appreciate that more.”
“He won’t,” said Cas, sounding absolutely convinced. “Dean’s a good person. He’ll get that it was an accident, that you didn’t mean any harm. And he
“I wouldn’t worry too much,” said Cas. “Dean can take it. And I think it’s about time he received a few Paddington Bear Hard Stares.”
“Well, I can help you with that,” said Cas. “We’ll wait till tomorrow though,” he added conspiratorially. “Leave Dean to calm down a bit. Think about his
“We’re lucky,” he managed to say. “Paddington Bear didn’t have angel powers. It must have been a lot harder for him to fix up the damage when he messed up.”
“What did you even do?” he asked Jack. “How the hell is it possible to mess up
“Don’t worry, I’m used to those. Cas is a champion at them,” said Dean. “How was the marmalade, anyway?”
“Well, here you go, kid,” said Dean, still sounding bemused. “Oranges, as requested.”
“No it doesn’t – shut up! No way is wheat a vegetable. Back me up on this, Cas.”
“That’s not true! I was just – you know, setting boundaries. The way parents are meant to. He needs to know that he can’t go around setting shit on fire.”
“Both,” said Jack. Then he added, “Paddington Bear says you should always be honest – it always turns out better in the end.”
“Jesus!” said Sam, reaching for a paper towel. Then, seeing Jack’s face: “Don’t worry. I’ll pour you another one – there’s plenty left in the blender.”
“Don’t worry,” Jack told him quietly, a while later when Cas was occupied weighing out the sugar. “Marmalade takes a really really long time to finish making. Remember?”
“Well, he’s done worse damage in his time,” said Cas. “In fact, we all have.”
“I think I’m going to make it into swiss pudding,” said Jack, looking thoughtfully at the messy roll. So that’s what they did, with the help of a rolling pin. They mashed it back up, and then they put it into a bowl (green, covered in garish pink flowers, another of Cas’s second-hand finds); and Jack mixed in some marmalade because he thought it would be an interesting experiment and anyway, there was more marmalade in the bunker now than anyone knew what to do with.
good job of it – he got over excited a few times and splashed the mixture out of the pan, but no-one really minded – not even Dean.
And finally, Jack allowed his face to break into a small, tentative smile.
together, and I got you that marmalade…”
“Is that supposed to be another Paddington Bear hard stare?” Dean asked him. “Or have you just inherited Cas’s whole squinting thing?”
And he put down his untouched smoothie with a thunk and marched towards the door, almost crashing straight into Eileen, who’d appeared out of nowhere.
It occurred to Jack that the water was starting to feel warmer. He wasn’t quite sure what Dean meant by

Jack would have liked to believe him, but Cas had been wrong last time – about Dean not being mad. Cas must have understood the look on his face, because he added, very firmly,
Cas gave him a slightly scathing look. “Angel grace doesn’t work like some sort of magic wand for every little flight of fancy, Dean,” he said.
“I can see that,” said Cas, eyes narrowed, slightly grumpily. But then he saw Jack’s face – he wasn’t saying anything, but it was clear that the idea of being a “matched set” appealed to him almost as much as Dean. Cas thawed slightly – he thought he could just about put up with being paraded about like some sort of pet poodle if it made
? Or other parents in movies and tv shows? Because usually parents are close like… the same way that Sam and Eileen are close. Aren’t they?”
driven all the way to the store to get it for him. It was nice, sometimes, to have proof of things like that.
“I don’t know what I thought.” He turns away, anger still there, but waning.
“Thank you. I appreciate you showing me the way.”
“That’s not true.”
“A shojo? You sure?” Dean asks, eyes barely open, wincing at even the anemic lights of the bunker’s kitchen.
“The tree thingy?”
“Sonovabitch that hurts!”
“J'MEN CȂLICE!!!”
The ninja squirrel is up on a branch now, keeping an eye on the feeder. It doesn’t seem to mind the chickadees, but it runs the blue jays off when they land. Cas is still sitting in the lawn chair, a blanket over his lap and a mug of something hot steaming in his mitten-covered hands.  Dean ignores him as he sweeps the dusting of snow off the concrete walk and sets his ingredients down. He chalks a circle on the ground and, consulting the book through bleary eyes, starts to draw symbols around its edge. He sets a bronze bowl in the centre and adds some dried herbs and a pinch of animal fur from a small brown drawstring bag.
Five minutes later the squirrel is still trapped under the colander, a large encyclopedia of runes holding it in place, and Team Free Will are outside, with Sam drawing new sigils in chalk on the walkway. Dean is helpfully holding his hair out of the way. “I think that with the sigils reversed, we’ll be able to reverse the spell.”
“Here.” Dean hands him a steaming mug of something. Tea, it turns out, and Cas sips at it gratefully. Dean is still standing on the other side of the coffee table and Cas finds it difficult to look up at him and meet his eyes.
“I thought you were an oil worker when I saw you in Albert’s in Abéché. And I thought you were Canadian. You were swearing up a storm in Québecois and you were with a couple of French-Canadian roughnecks. What were you fighting about?”
Youssef makes a dismissive sound and drops the end of his cigarette on the ground and grinds it under a heel. Victor turns to him, “You think we won’t be going?” Youssef responds with a flurry of Arabic mixed with French. Dean looks puzzled.
“The only man you’ve mentioned in the past few months is the guy who saved you from a freaking bear. That’s got to make him memorable, right? And yet you go out of your way not to give any details about what happened that night other than ‘ha ha I spent New Year’s Eve getting chased by a polar bear and had to hang out with the guy who rescued me for a few hours’. That’s not suspicious at all.”
Dean looks up from where he was peeling the label of his own beer. “I thought it was something like that. Doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt though, when I came out of the shower and found your note.” His voice is serious now.
Cas’s heart pounds as he waits for Dean’s next words.
Sam suggested a coin toss, but Dean was having none of that shit. He insisted on rock, paper, scissors, and ended up with the Canada-in-winter end of the stick.  Cas, given the choice between accompanying Sam to sunny California or driving with Dean into darkest Canada, had surprised exactly one of them by electing to go with Dean.
“That man knows more about Boko Haram than he should,” Youssef says.
“I’m sure,” Cas says, and kisses him again. Dean pulls away with a smile and lifts the rolled mattress onto the bed frame. He cuts the straps and the mattress uncurls like a potato bug ready to make a getaway. It flops roughly into place on the wooden slats. Dean sits and bounces experimentally before lying back. He pats the spot next to him. “Come on, Cas. Let’s check it out.”
“I’ll get packed.”
“Just peachy.” Dean grins at him. “What’s going on?”
“Cas, this is my first gunshot wound. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do.” There’s an edge to his voice. He can feel the hysteria bubbling up. He’s cold now too, and shaky.
“Nope, I don’t think we’re gonna do that.” He pulls Cas down onto the bed beside him and kisses him.
“Hey, Lucas?” Cas turns around and it’s his combo worst nightmare/dream man standing there.
last night on tv.”
Dean’s in no mood for stupid questions. “Like I got shot yesterday and slept on the ground all night.”
“All right, Weezer!” Dean says. They reach for a cracker at the same time and their hands brush. Cas can feel an electric tingle where their hands touched. He wants to feel it again.
“I thought they were fireworks. It’s New Year’s Eve.”
“Yeah, I have to enter some vaccine lot numbers. I’ll catch up with you later.”
He looks back into the gallery. A few guests are looking at the display of pottery on the pedestals, but no angry Japanese spirits are present. OK then. It’s time to go trail Cas and make sure that the spirit can’t sneak up on him. Dean moves through the lobby, nodding to the woman behind the reception desk.
Dean grabs his other hand and presses it to his growing erection. He groans when Cas’s hand tightens around his shaft.
“Yeah, we need to get you out of here.”
“I’m Dean”, he says, holding out a hand for Cas to shake. “Your host for the next few hours.”
“Meg?” he says carefully. She’s the head admin for the Earth Sciences department, and Cas’s best friend.
“Please. You’re a little banged up is all. It’s not like I saved your life or anything.”
Cas takes off his hat and mitts, and puts them down with his coat and his camera, looking around the room. It’s homey and warm. Heat is pumping out of a woodstove in the corner. Bookcases cover one wall, filled with books and dvds. A large tv sits across from a well-worn green and rust plaid-upholstered couch, a knitted afghan thrown over the back. On the coffee table are a plate with a couple of different types of cheese, a box of crackers, a beer, and the remote for the tv that’s showing the frozen image of men on horseback fording a stream.
Dean is standing on the porch, a mouldy-looking green blanket thrown over his shoulders, coffee mug in his hand. (
“Well, another time I ended up in Nha Trang. I spent a few weeks there until I was powered up enough to fly back. I learned how to eat pho while I was there.” He uses his chopsticks to pick up a piece of beef from his soup and eats it.
“God help me, if you tell me it’s just a flesh wound, I’ll…”
All too soon it’s his turn. The presentation goes well, no technical issues with the computer that’s hooked up to the projector, and it’s well received, several people asking questions in the short Q&A that he gets as part of his presentation time. He walks out onto the concourse, still chatting with Claire, who’d made it to the presentation room in time to see him speak, and a mining company geologist from Kirkland Lake called Vicki. She’s asking what he thought about Sirelda’s 2017 paper, but Cas has stopped hearing her voice or even seeing her. The busy concourse with its milling crowds has faded away to become a silent, shadowy background for only one person.
The sun, newly risen despite it being almost 9:30 in the morning, is casting a warm pool of light on the white-tiled floor and Cas is surprised how domestic and tranquil it feels being here in this kitchen. There are photos stuck to the fridge with magnets, Dean and a taller man with longish brown hair proudly holding up fish on the shore of some lake in one picture and sitting on the hood of a big black car in another. A spider plant hangs over the sink and there’s a collection of cereal boxes on the counter like a line of books. Cas decides to just drink his coffee in the moment and postpone all the
“Yeah, they found a new mineralization intercept almost 200 meters below the mine infrastructure,” Cas says, pointing to one of the drill holes on the model. He trails off when he realizes that Dean is staring at him and not the computer screen.
“Winter break is in two weeks. If you’re not going back to Kansas for Christmas,” Meg pauses to take in his violent head-shaking, “you can spend Christmas with me, and head up north for a few days over New Year’s. It’s winter, that’s got to be prime northern-lights-watching time. Your place is like five blocks from mine, I can go once a day and make sure Spock’s got food and water.” She stops, satisfied that she’s headed off all of his objections.
. He takes careful aim. Through the trees he can see his target and the one square inch of fur that he’s going to put a bullet through. He exhales slowly and starts to squeeze the trigger of the pearl-handled automatic.
Michael you were kissing, wasn’t it?” He sits down in the easy chair across from the couch, crosses his arms, and then waits for Cas to fill the silence.
“He’s a doctor. He doesn’t have anything to do with them,” Dean says, defensive for some reason he can’t put a name to.
“Coming, Mrs. Winchester,” he hollers back. “If you’ll excuse me, I’m needed on the dance floor.” He smiles at Cas and heads across the room.
“Yeah,” she answers, not bothering to ask how he knows. He just seems to know everything that goes on in the camp, and what he doesn’t know, Alicia tells him. “It’s peaceful. I can think out here. It reminds me of home, but in a good way. It helps.” She smiles as two chickadees land on her hand at the same time. “They’re pretty tame.”
“I think I’m going to take this to go,” she says to Dean, getting up, “I should check on the girls.” Dean watches her walk away
as he goes down the hall to the bathroom.
He’s brought to where Mashaya sits on the tailgate of the pickup, cleaning his gun in the late morning sunlight.
“Clarence? I don’t believe you,” she says flatly.
“Where did you go?”
. That was a polar bear,” Cas says.
Dean shoots him a look of pure poison. “Yeah? Try to stop me.”
“Dean.” Sam’s voice is resigned. He holds his hand out for the spellbook which Dean is still holding. They go back outside and Sam looks at the spell circle on the walkway and compares it with the illustration in the book.
“What do you want, Cas?” Dean whispers into the little bit of space between them. Cas doesn’t answer, but he slowly pushes up Dean’s shirt, exposing more of his body. Dean obediently lifts his arms, allowing Cas to pull it off completely. It’s thrown to the floor and then Cas’s hands are on Dean, his turn to explore. He reaches down again, sealing their lips together. This kiss is deeper, more claiming, Cas’s tongue plundering Dean’s mouth, his need all-consuming now that it’s been ignited. He rolls over on top of Dean and his hands move to Dean’s waist, then sliding lower, feeling the sharp jut of his hip bones as he grinds against Dean. He can feel the proof of Dean’s arousal, hard beneath the denim of his jeans, pressing into his hip and he shifts slightly, rocking forward causing his own erection to slide deliciously along Dean’s. He breaks their kiss with a groan, hips still rocking into Dean’s.
“Then why were you talking to Youssef? What were you talking about?”
. Dean swallows as the man approaches the bar.
Dean can hear the clinking of bottles hitting each other. He shrinks back against the side of the tent, hoping they don’t turn around and see him. They’re speaking in low voices, and as they pass the lit window of one of the tents, Dean can see that the shorter of the two has a stripe of white hair across the back of his head.
Meg leans forward to emphasize her point. “You realize you don’t owe it to Michael to stay faithful, don’t you? Cas, he
Dean sleeps on and off on the way back to Fada. They’ve barely pulled into the parking area at the clinic when Gabe opens the door of the car to pull Cas out and hug him, before running over to where Meg is getting out of another vehicle. She gets a longer hug, Dean notes with some amusement. Peter and Benny and the rest of the staff are there too, and it’s a happy reunion, but Dean begs off the celebratory drinks and heads to the guest tent.
“I can’t Meg, I’ve got two classes to teach this semester, plus the grad students, and working on the ore models. And there’s Spock to think about.”
“So, what, you’ve come to say goodbye?” His voice is strained and harsh. Cas looks puzzled and then alarmed. Words tumble out in a rush.
“I can’t believe this bullshit!” he yells. The man with the rifle steps forward and grabs Dean’s arm and pulls him away from Mashaya. And that’s when all hell breaks loose.
Jack didn’t say anything. He just broke into a smile – slowly, at first, then wide as the sun.
“Do you know how dangerous that could have been?” Dean asked, turning back to Jack. “You could have burnt the place down – fried us alive. Wouldn’t that be funny, huh? After everything we’ve been through, we end up burnt to a crisp, just because you’ve got some kind of pyrommaniac agenda.”
“I’m sorry about breaking the kitchen,” Jack said back.
that to take for granted. With Dean, it was more complicated, and perhaps it always would be.
“No you will not,” said Dean. “I’m not having you walking round when there’s glass on the floor. You’re staying put.”
He looked at Dean inquiringly. He was
“He didn’t mean to… “set shit on fire”. He was just trying to do some cooking – he got inspired by watching
But it was fine because Jack didn’t need to sleep. In fact, Dean didn’t even need to know about his marmalade-making venture. He would get it done quietly, at 2 in the morning or so, and when Dean and Sam and Eileen woke up there would be a clean kitchen and whole row of jars of marmalade, all ready and waiting to be discovered.
Cas looked up from his book when Jack came padding in. “Good morning,” he said, his voice as warm as it always was when he spoke to Jack - as if everything was completely fine and normal. “How’re you feeling?”
Then he turned back to Jack, and before he had time to react, he’d swept him all the way down the hall and towards his room.
thinking about. Jack hadn’t meant to. He’d just been stating the obvious – the first thought that came into his head. But it was nice to be taken seriously, especially by
(See the end of the chapter for
Fun fact: the parenting tip about having kids put their hand in water to feel it heat up might sound random, but it's actually a thing, believe it or not! On my gap year, I worked at a nursery for visually impaired kids, and it was a way for them to learn how heat works through texture without having to rely on eye-sight. I suddenly remembered it while I was writing this and I thought I'd include it because, well. Reasons.
“Yes, well.” Cas said, suddenly twisting his head like an angry owl to look at Dean. “Saying something and acting like it are two different things.”
So he remembered. Well, shit.
He could never make up for that, but if he didn’t stop it from happening to someone else, he wasn’t sure he could live with himself.
The first thing he’d done was lift that brilliant kid Kevin Tran off his feet in a hug. Genius nerds made squeaky sounds upon losing footing, who knew? The second thing he’d done was force the rest of the crew to partake in the pie Gabriel’s wife had sent for them. He’d graciously allowed Crew-2 to join them.
She looked up. “We’d be very far behind schedule if I wasn’t.”
He wasn’t awake for long before someone knocked quietly.
“Well . . . I mean. We don’t have the tech, man. I dunno what else to tell you.”
Sam paused at that. “Yeah . . . actually.”
It was as he was sluicing off the suds that the next impulse occurred to him: he was off duty, on his own personal time, and a bit more stress relief sounded like just the thing to end what had been a pretty shitty day on a less shitty note. Of course, there was a sentinel right outside who would undoubtedly hear everything he did, but he wasn’t inclined to let that stop him. If anything, the potential to bother Cas with his activities was a bonus rather than a deterrent. Two birds, one orgasm.
“Not all of them, but this guy’s probably the meanest bull working right now. He’s been on the circuit six years now, which isn’t a record but is pretty damn long. And, coincidentally, is just as long as the reigning champ who’s about to ride him. Larry here’s the only bull he ever wrecked on in competition, and this is their first rematch.”
I’m going to sleep
So when they finally touched down and Dean could let out his breath, when Cas finally acknowledged his existence long enough to sneer, “We are the highest level agency with national jurisdiction. Travel is a regular part of our work and you—” Dean didn’t bother to hold in his bad mood.
Weirded out that she kept tabs on him like that and increasingly concerned about what exactly she was able to log and review, Dean asked, “Does it feel like there’s anything wrong?”
“Um . . .” Sam muttered. “I’m gonna be in the map room. With Charlie and Rowena. Yeah.” There was a shuffling noise. “Yeah, I’m gonna be in the map room,
“Cas is in a zone,” Dean said without preamble, raising his voice to carry as he crossed to the door and set it to let in anyone from the team. “Bad one. I’m gonna try to bring him back, I need someone to come keep an eye on us in case it goes bad.”
“That. And she’d probably die,” he narrowed his eyes at Dean.
Sitting up, Dean stared from her to Charlie to Cas and back. He said, “That’s not possible. He’s not wired in—he wasn’t anywhere near a conduit.”
Half the dry bread was already crammed into his mouth and dragging down his esophagus, helped along by a few more swallows of coffee, when he stepped off the elevator onto the third floor not even fifteen minutes after he’d left it. Halfway down the hallway, he almost walked right into Cas. Dean at least had the excuse of looking down into his styrocorn cup, which he thought really should have had more coffee in it but had come up empty when he raised it to his lips; Cas had apparently just expected Dean to move out of his way, because he looked deeply offended at having had to stop. Or maybe that was just his reaction to seeing Dean at all.
Half choking on a chuckle, Lafitte said, “Not like this they don’t. My little girl won’t shut up about the table and chairs he gave her last Christmas. I’m pretty sure it was a setup to try and get me to pay in blood for more, since nothing else will do now.”
As soon as the words left his mouth, he wanted to take them back. He’d been trying to come up with something that made sense for Jimmy without being a complete lie, but hearing himself say it out loud, it was too much. Too honest, but also insincere, because at the moment he said it, he wasn’t really thinking about the things he’d taken for granted. He was thinking about the things Jimmy had. It wasn’t fair to either of them to hold onto that resentment. Their lives were different, but now they were both getting a chance to see the other side of things. By the end of the summer, after they told their parents the truth, it would all change in ways he couldn’t predict anyway.
Cas rattled off a definition that was probably more accurate than anything Dean could’ve come up with, then looked surprised at himself for having done so. It was another good sign, but more than that it was an expression that reminded Dean of the real Cas—adult, augmented, grumpy Cas—and he missed the man suddenly and fiercely.
“Tell me you’ll wear the fucking sweater.”
Then, they’d gotten down to serious business.
He passed the inside of his right wrist in front of the scanner, rolling his eyes, and it faded to green as the door slid away. A man stood on the other side—or something resembling a man. He looked more like an early-generation android, from before companies had started trying to make them more realistically human in appearance. But he was more flesh than plastimetal, and the parts of him that were flesh didn’t have the waxy smoothness of rudimentary synskin.
, he opens his heart and bares his soul and it’s worth it because he knows Cas can hear his love in it.
, Cas.” The diminutive rolled off his tongue with the ease that came from overuse. Part of him wanted to scream at the man, another wanted to bite his tongue off for blabbering.
Junior passed the keys on to Novak, then Dean stood in the doorway to wave him away as he drove off. As soon as he shut the door, Novak pinned him to it with nothing but a glower from across the room—it did things to Dean, knocked him straight out of his role and into the dangerous headspace of the night before, of those eyes searing into him with his ass on fire and come cooling sticky in his pants. He could still feel the former, muted into a pleasant ache that he had so far resisted checking for bruising. Whether he wanted the bruises or not was something else he refused to give further attention to. The latter wasn’t exactly at risk of happening again, but if Novak kept looking at him like that he was going to have an embarrassing enough situation in the same place.
That night Cas tosses and turns, haunted by how close he’d been to getting Dean back. Worried what Dean must be thinking about him, seeing Michael kiss him.
Well, the last ghost is sure taking their sweet time. Dean’s got an inkling of who it’s gonna be, and sure enough, as he’s lying on his bed resting his eyes, the room gets cold again and he recognizes the sound of someone clearing his throat.
, thinks Cas. And sure enough, he can feel his phone vibrating in his pocket. He ignores it and ushers Dean into his office. He pulls the guest chair around the desk next to his, and starts the computer up. He pulls up the model of the Detour Lake gold mine, and rotates it to show the mine and the mineralization from all angles.
“Seriously?” Dean is pissed. “Did you miss the part where he was gonna clock you?  A thank you would be nice about now.”
“Why so glum?” Gabe asks him, motioning to the bartender for another drink.
“Longer to do what, Cas?”
There’s a knock at the door, and Gabe’s voice comes through loud and clear, “I hope you boys are having fun. I’m just gonna leave some condoms out here for ya. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
“Maybe if I tie you to the bed, you can’t run away again,” Cas says, pressing Dean back against the mattress.
“Was the sex good at least?” she asks.
Dean feels strong arms wrap around his torso and pull him to his feet. As the darkness and nausea recede he’s aware that he’s naked and wet and his back is pressed all up against Cas’s front. Warm water is still cascading over both of them, and a fleeting thought crosses his mind that if it wasn’t for the vertigo and the dull pain in his thigh, this situation would be damn near ideal.
Issa and an older woman are in a tent with one of the walls opened wide, the flap tied to a roof brace. There are pans of food cooking on a hot plate inside. Issa catches his eye when she leaves the tent to stir at something boiling in a pot suspended over a small fire, and he remembers her promise to speak to him.
They remind her of home—of before. Of walking through the woods behind the house in a northern Michigan winter with her sister, afternoon sun hanging low in the sky. Kelsey with her pockets full of sunflower seeds and cigarettes, Christina feeding the chickadees and Kels smoking with extravagant gestures, dissecting the social strata of the senior class as clinically as any anthropologist.
“How is Youssef a member of the Chad army and a Field Security bodyguard?”
“How did you get the army to let you come on the raid?” Dean’s not snuggling into Cas’s chest. He’s not. And he’ll sue anyone who says he is.
“You can’t just live on burgers.”
“You sure?” Dean hates how small his voice sounds.
“Can you catch that one?” Cas asks the gangly kid in the blue smock with the fish net, “The one that’s mostly gold with the white on its back?” His voice is flat. Resigned, almost. It breaks Dean’s heart. He wants Cas to be happy. Really he does. Dean sighs and starts gathering up the supplies they’re going to need. Aquarium. Filter. Fish food. And a few other things. He tells Cas he’ll meet him at the cash and then crosses the store to have a quick word with one of the other employees.
“Why are we here, Dean?” Cas asks as Dean parks the Impala in the pet store lot.
“Yes, it’s the tree of life. It should be facing towards the vermin to be banished. You have it facing the bunker. And the
,” he said, and scooped up some more ammunition. Cas ducked behind one of the trees lining the driveway and stepped out only long enough to launch another snowball at Dean, laughing, his cheeks red and eyes sparkling in the light spilling from floodlight on the garage wall.
Dean wraps himself in the afghan while he lies on the couch watching Orphan Black and flips Sam off when Sam smiles at him knowingly. And if Sam notices that one of the dishcloths is missing from the kitchen, he doesn’t mention it. Dean wakes that night with tears on his cheeks from a dream he can’t quite remember. Just the faint echoes of conversations, the feeling of loss, and blue, blue eyes.
. The man takes in Dean’s look of confusion and extends a hand, grinning broadly. “I’m Gabriel Novak. One of the doctors here. And you are?”
Cas is using ASL. He’s making the sign for girl.
He’s not going to be able to sneak out.
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
In a moment, all the sleepy happiness flees and Cas is wide awake. He reaches over to the bed-side table and retrieves his phone. It’s a text from Meg.
“Nah, he’ll live. He’s going to have a headache, probably a concussion too.”
Before she can say anything else, the front doors of the car open, and two militants get in. Neither of them are Youssef. The car starts up and they pull away from Fada, following the other vehicles in Mashaya’s convoy: four Land Cruisers and the pick up truck. They head into the desert and Dean can tell from the stars in the night sky that they’re heading northwest. Towards the mountains and the Boko Haram strongholds.
“Oh yeah? And what are you going to do? Get one of your men to shoot me again?” Dean’s  heart is pounding, but he carries on.
They come up for air a few minutes later, Cas’s fingers are tangled in Dean’s hair. “My god, I thought I’d never see you again.” Cas’s voice is shaky. It’s finally sinking in. Dean is here. Dean wants him.
“A little help, Dean?”
Cas laughs at that. “That is a super cheesy line.’
Cas is pouting in the passenger seat. Folding the IKEA receipt into ever-smaller squares, he stares resolutely out of his side window. Dean pretends not to notice, dialling into a rock station playing the Stones. They pull out onto the highway with
“Thank you, Dean,” says Cas.
Dean’s almost got whiplash from the turnaround in Cas’s attitude. He's still standing there watching Cas walk out the front door of the inn as Youssef appears in the lobby.
“Shit.” Dean dabs at it with his napkin. “You know, this wouldn’t have happened if we went for burgers.”
“We were just talking.”
“It’s always dangerous. I’m sure there are cats in Capistrano. But instinct wins every time. They always go home.”
“I have...um. I mean, there are feelings involved here. For you...” He trails off and stands there waiting for Cas’s response.
The look Cas gives Dean is one that was last seen by Raphael through a wall of holy oil flames. Dean has the grace to look a little ashamed. Cas sighs heavily and gets out of the car. “Let’s get this over with.”
Michael walks towards him, “I came to say I’m sorry. I was stupid. I was wrong. I miss you and I want you back.” He doesn’t sound sorry. He sounds like someone mouthing the words to something that’s already a done deal. A mere formality.
try to get you wasted on purpose. You have brothers or sisters?”
, he thinks, and it’s his last coherent thought for quite a while.
Sam’s still sleeping, if the sound of snoring continuing to emanate from his room is any indication. Dean pauses at the kitchen door and looks in. It’s not empty, as it was in his vision of the future. Cas is leaning against the counter, dressed in a faded Rolling Stones tee and sweatpants, coffee in hand. Unshaven and his hair a wild nest. It’s the best thing Dean’s ever seen. Cas looks up from his mug and smiles. “Merry Christmas, Dean.”
She went over to the bed and hugged him around the shoulders, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “You got it. Brace yourself for the invasion.”
Novak, who’d leaned on Dean all the way across the floor and to the stairs, sobered up miraculously when they hit the cool night air—but he still gave Dean his keys before they got to the car. They left the parking lot without meeting up with the rest of the team, just in case Junior had someone like the driver he mentioned keeping an eye on them, and Dean took a looping route out toward the suburbs to make sure they were clear before circling back toward the basement.
“Are they okay?”
But two weeks later, a hunt went bad. They’d been up in Minnesota, tracking a werewolf. They’d  searched through a frigid, derelict farmhouse after sundown, the fog from their breath hanging heavy in the beams of their flashlights. Dean and Cas had taken the ground floor while Sam headed into the cellar. Cas had seen a sudden movement outside the window, but before he could say anything, the werewolf dove through in a shower of glass. She lunged at Dean, clawing his thigh. Cas froze for a long second and then fired at her and missed. Sam pounded up the stairs and shot her dead. They wrapped a flannel shirt around the wound and drove slowly back to the motel. Cas had refused then and there to go on any more hunts.
Mashaya smiles in what looks like genuine amusement, and answers, the echo of his schooling in England evident in his accent, “Of course I care about ‘my own people,’ I care very deeply. In fact, I think that their well-being would be so much more assured if I brought them back a doctor.” He nods to one of his men, who grabs Meg by the arm and starts dragging her off towards the Land Cruiser. She doesn’t go quietly, and Dean can hear her cursing until it’s cut off by the sound of the car door slamming.
Cas leads Dean down a path between tents, pointing out the clinic tents and kitchen facilities. They reach one at the end of a row distinguished by a sign over the door that says
The country changes from flat grassy plains to low hills, barren of vegetation, and they begin to climb. The two trucks make good time and move steadily into the Sahara. They don’t see a living soul or anything alive at all except for thin grasses burnt by the sun and the inevitable thorn trees. Dunes appear, scattered at first, and then more common. Soon they have to steer around them, using GPS to navigate back on their path. The cars pass the village of Salal, one of the tiny capitals of the
“Yeah,” Cas sits back, “Go along the corridor to the right, through the double doors, to the end of the hallway. Turn left and it’s like the second door on your left.”
“Well, if we don’t get this put together, you aren’t gonna have a
“We’re here to get a cat?” Cas’s voice is eight kinds of hopeful.
Team Free Will had been enjoying some post-Christmas downtime in the bunker, sticking close to home, only venturing out for a few hunts relatively nearby. Then two cases had cropped up at the same time: a hunter in Santa Barbara sending up a distress signal for help with what sounded like a clear-cut case of vampires, and a string of construction workers disappearing at a spa in Quebec, Canada.
“What do they want?” Dean’s really surprised that his voice is not betraying exactly how scared he is.
Sam leans forward and lowers his voice. “I was able to get into the server at the ME’s office in Portland and look at the crime scene photos. Those wounds were definitely not from a cougar. The only explanation I can see is that the shojo is rogue and not acting on anyone’s direction, just angry that her bottle was removed from Japan.”
jawline, and a mouth. A mouth with lips. Cas realizes his descriptive powers are faltering here. He settles on deciding that it’s the sexiest mouth he’s ever seen making the sexiest laugh he’s ever heard. Ever. And he’s in a perfectly tailored black tux, white rose in his lapel. Cas feels shaken to his very core. He’s always mocked the idea of love at first sight as a device in bad romance novels, and yet Cas finds himself standing there for a full minute, dumbstruck, before finally remembering how to use his legs and cross the room to where Gabe is talking to this vision.
“Eh, it’s not bad.” he grins reassuringly, putting the flashlight on the ground. “‘Tis but a scratch.”
The guide announces that that’s probably it for the lights tonight, and the buggy is heading back to town. They should all be back home before the clock strikes midnight and the ball drops. Conversations start up again as everyone can’t help but talk about how beautiful the lights were. Cas sits quietly next to Charlie and Dorothy and replays the dance of the aurora in his mind. Making this trip was the right decision.
“Can’t be too careful. The robes have deep pockets. But seriously, what is she and why aren’t we killing her?”
“So,” Dean starts, “I gotta say I never expected to see you waiting for me when I got home from work. Why are you here, Cas? Why are you in Churchill? I figured you were back with Michael. That
“She was brought here by an immigrant in the 1800s. He left his village on the island of Crete when his home burned down. The fire consumed Nerinphe’s tree as well, and only a small branch remained. The man brought it over with him when he came here and planted it on his new homestead. Nerinphe’s spirit was in the branch and she made it grow into a tree. He never married and, after he died, the homestead grew over and returned to wilderness. She’s been living here happily, among the wildlife, far enough away from the spa to escape discovery. But with the new construction, men came into the forest and four of them stumbled onto her sacred grove and she didn’t know what to do, so she turned them into trees.”
Cas stares back. His brow furrows a bit as he considers something.
“You were still pretty hung up on him last time you were here, remember?” His voice is rough with emotion. “I saw you two and I didn’t want to get in the way. Seeing that hurt more than I thought it would, but if he’s what you wanted I didn’t want to wreck that. I didn’t want to get in the way. I just had to get out of there.”
“What the hell was that dick doing here?”
After a while, Cas rummages in the backpack and brings out a tiny Coleman burner, which he lights. He puts a pot on the burner and fills it from the canteen. When the water boils he makes tea and hands a tin cup of it to Dean along with a sandwich of some kind of meat rolled in flatbread. Dean looks around at the many animals standing in the pools and hopes it’s not camel.
Cas can’t decipher the smile on Meg’s face.
“Sure, thanks.”
“But why, Dean?“
Dean looks over at him and says, “It’s a poor warlord indeed who lets himself be taken out by a fucking non-combatant.” He giggles to himself, a little hysterically.
“And the best man catches the garter!” the DJ announces “Let’s have a round of applause for Sam’s brother.”
“Cas?’ Dean’s voice is serious and maybe a bit scared. “Cas, what’s going on?”
“You will have other quarters.” A second man leads Dean to another tent and pushes him inside. There’s no light. But he can tell by feel that there are carpets covering the sand floor, and there are boxes taking up maybe half of the floor space.
Dean follows him into the store and past the shelves of pet food and litter boxes. The animals and fish are at the back of the store. Six cages have cats in them, signs on the doors saying that they’re from the local SPCA and are available for adoption. Cas bee-lines for a small brown tabby with a cream-coloured belly. The tag on the cage says “Meredith. One-year-old domestic short hair. Meredith is very playful and loves to be cuddled.” Cas is obviously smitten. He pushes a tentative finger between the bars of the cage, and Meredith licks it delicately with her tiny pink tongue.
Dean’s impressed in spite of himself. Field Security is one of the less sketchy private security companies operating on the continent. Nothing but the best for Exxon subcontractors apparently.
. The man Dean saw standing in the back of the the pickup truck jumps down and walks towards the MSF staff.
And that's how Dean ended up where he is now: standing near the change-room door, dressed in much less clothing than he's entirely comfortable with, watching a stream of laughing people,  dressed in flip-flops and robes over bathing suits, some wearing knit hats, go out the door and into a winter fairyland.
Dean crosses the room and climbs onto a stool, dropping his copy of
In a bit, Cas gets up. “Come on, we’re not done yet.” He leans over and pulls Dean to his feet. The sensation of Cas’s hand gripping his wrist makes him blush. When did his body decide to turn traitor like this?
“Yep.”
Dean starts and sits up. Kevin’s gone. He’s alone in his room. He leans back against the pillows. Huh, he’d forgotten how from the very beginning, from the moment they met, Cas had seemed to look right inside him. Cas seemed to see how undeserving he felt, how useless he thought he was back then — as a hunter and a brother. How from the very beginning he’d known Dean in a way that no one else had. And he hadn’t backed off, he hadn’t left, he’d shown up again and again, pushing into Dean’s personal spaces, long after Dean stopped being his mission. Long after Dean was his friend, the one he’d rebelled for. Dean draws his knees up and hugs them, thinking hard.
They get out of the jeep and make their way into the maze. The sun is well past its zenith now, so the passageways are shadowed and cool. Dean wanders through the labyrinth, looking up at the azure sky visible between the lumpy, rounded columns. He’s lost in thought, but aware of Cas somewhere behind him. He can hear him whistling.
Cas comes up for air. “More bear bangers?”
“Fuck off, Gabe,” Cas yells, but he’s giggling.
“Twenty minutes, Dean,” she says, and when Dean pulls the pillow off his head, she’s gone and the room is warm again.
Cas tilts his head and listens for a second. “
Dean opens his mouth and shuts it again, glaring at Cas.
“Dean and I will imbibe enough alcohol so that we can see the shojo. I will act as bait and stagger theatrically around the winery and grounds so that Dean, also a bit “lit” can “shank” her with the katana blessed by a Shinto priest. You will stay sober and run interference with anyone who might get in the way, and generally keep the other partygoers safe.”
“Yep,” Gabe answers through a mouthful of chocolate. “Mother is
It takes Dean a couple of seconds to climb the two stairs up into the shower trailer. There are two shower stalls with curtains off a central room that has a bench for changing and cubbies for clothes. Cas trails behind Dean, joining him when Dean is inside hanging up his towel.
? You gave me a heart attack.” Dean turns on the flashlight on his phone to see Cas is swaying slightly on his feet.
“Happy?”
. He feels loose enough to turn and watch Cas standing at the bar, and admire the view. The tee shirt and scrubs hug Cas’s body, outlining his muscular build. Dean’s about to stop staring, good manners making a belated appearance, when a small figure crosses the sandy ground and makes straight for Cas. It’s a young girl, in her mid-teens, her head covered. She leans close to Cas, her body language tense, and speaks urgently to him. Cas looks worried and says something back. She shakes her head. He says a few more words and she shakes her head again. He looks away to say something to the bartender. The girl looks over at the table, her eyes catching Dean’s for a long moment.
“You have a little...” Cas gestures at his own shirt. Dean looks down, his chest is pressed against the tables edge, and the puddle of pho broth has soaked a line into the front of his Black Sabbath tee.
Trench Coat glances at him, puzzled, but then a look of recognition crosses his face, changing quickly to annoyance. “You’re a long way from Abéché,” he says, in that gravelly voice Dean remembers so well. It’s faintly mocking.
“Here’s a map of the spa,” he says. ”See over here it says that a mud bath is opening later this summer? That’s where they’re expanding into the forest. It makes sense that’s where the disappearances happened.”
He’s remembering another set of lips, Dean’s lips. Dean’s hands on his body, Dean’s breath hot on his skin. Cas stands frozen as Michael wraps his arms around Cas and tries to pull him close. Then something snaps inside Cas. He gets his hands against Michael’s chest and pushes. Hard. “Michael, stop.”
That’s Cas’s equation, she’s sure of it.) She can't see Cas's face, but she can see Dean's. He smiles at Cas. It’s warm and lazy and predatory.
“Yeaaah, I’m out,” Gabe says, and stands up. He’s not exactly swaying, but it seems to be taking a noticeable amount of concentration for him to push out of the gravitational pull of the table and head towards the door. Cas rolls his eyes and follows his brother, casting a wary eye over to where Naomi stands deep in conversation with a group of suits. Gabe detours a few steps to pluck a glass of champagne off the tray of a passing waiter. There’s going to be hell to pay when Naomi figures out they’ve ditched, but Cas can’t help feeling like he’s broken out of Alcatraz when he and Gabe cross the lobby of the hotel and spill out onto the sidewalk grinning at each other.
“What’s gonna happen if you don’t tell him how you feel.”
He has to make sure. But the men turn out of sight around the corner  before he can get a close look.
Dean catches Cas looking over at Meredith’s cage again, but he turns resolutely back to the wall of fish tanks, looking at one that has fancy goldfish, the kind with the googly eyes and fan-shaped tails.
“Yong Li or Tasha?”
July comes and goes without anything from Cas, and the bunker is welcome respite from the heat. The high drone of cicadas and unrelenting sun are the common denominators in the hunts Dean and Sam go on across the midwest. Two vengeful spirits and a small pack of ghouls are dispatched with relative ease in North Dakota and Iowa.
“The field has security. And I have babysitters to get me up there.” Dean waits for Cas to follow him out of the room.
Cas looks over. “Anna’s the baby. She writes and illustrates children’s books. And she would definitely
“We’re leaving. Now,” he says, his voice brooking no argument.
Cas sits back and thinks about this. “So, you want this? You want me?”
“Gabe,” Cas starts, but his brother doesn’t wait to hear it, he just starts walking along the sidewalk again, motioning Cas to keep up. At least he’s walking in a straight line, Cas thinks, and that’s when things go from bad to worse and the rain starts. Within seconds, it’s coming down hard and Cas goes to grab Gabe’s sleeve to lead him back to the hotel.
True, he’d known Cas less than a week, but he'd developed feelings that were about more than just sex. It seems their shared experiences in the labyrinth: the kiss, being on the run for their lives, and him getting shot have accelerated Dean’s feelings. Thank God he didn’t get any further involved. That last memory of Cas leaving the tent while he lay on the floor is seared into his brain. Nonetheless, Dean realizes he’s a lot more involved than he wants to be. It’s hard to tell what’s hurting him more: his leg or thinking about Cas.
. He spends a quick second mentally apologising to Jessica for thinking the worst of her. Now he’s glad he stepped in to help with dessert. If he were planning on sticking around, he would find the nicest looking profiteroles and plate them just for her. The groom hooks the garter over his thumb and pulls it back with his other hand to shoot it into the crowd of bachelors. Dean puts his hand up and catches it in midair.
Cas had bundled up in an army-surplus parka and some canvas work gloves he’d found in the garage. Dean had a couple layers of flannel on under a jacket that was ill-suited to the cold, and no gloves. He stopped shoveling to blow on his hands and stick them in his pockets for a minute.
The asshole is enjoying this, Dean realizes. A warmth rises in his chest. Cas isn’t offended or surprised or disapproving.
“Less shining armor, and more plaid flannel and bluejeans,” he says, trying for flippant. Trying not to get distracted by memories so sharp he can feel them, even after nearly two months.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice is resigned. “You don’t have to prove anything. We can go back to Cheyenne if you’re convinced that those deaths aren’t natural -- well not ‘natural’ but not ‘not supernatural.’ And you can ask for a fork.”
bothered he’d be about being mistaken for Cas’s boyfriend. How he’d been feeling plenty of not-friend feelings over the past months and wasn’t sure what to do with them, so repressing them seemed like the best plan.
“I really am.” She sips at her wine.
“Dean.”
Cas pulls back, focusing on Dean and shaking his head like he’s trying to wake himself up. He looks kinda panicked, Dean thinks. “Dean, it’s Nerinphe’s blessing. I think this is my ‘power flourishing like an oak tree’.“
, it’s a refrain in his heart.
“You were right to end it, Michael. We don’t belong together anymore. I’m sorry that whoever you left me for isn’t doing for you. But I’m not a consolation prize or your fucking Plan B.” Cas gives full throttle to his anger now that the shock is receding. “You don’t get to just pick back up where you left off after putting me through that. I’m not interested. I’ve found someone else. Enjoy the rest of your stay in Toronto. Goodbye, Michael.” Cas turns his back and sits down at his desk. He’s shaking, more from anger now than from shock.
“Hey, how you feeling?”
The man looks mollified. “Here, take your coat off and sit down. You’re here for a while. I have to call the bear patrol. They don’t usually stop the alert for an hour or two until they’re sure they’ve chased the bear out of town.” The man takes a cellphone out of his pocket and dials quickly. “Hey Bob, it’s Dean. Yeah, a big male just went by the house, heading north. They’re already on it? Cool. Alright, thanks. Yeah, you too. Bye.”
. They look good together, Cas thinks. Dean twirls her away from him, keeping hold of one of her hands as she pauses dramatically, arms outstretched, and then reels her back into his arms. She throws her head back and laughs. It’s too much. Cas turns back to the bar and downs the rest of the wine in his glass.
“Here.” He hands Cas one of the mugs. “Cream’s in the fridge. I hope you don’t take sugar, because I’m out.”
Sam checks to make sure that none of his hair is in the way, and then drops a match into the bowl. The ingredients flare up, releasing a greasy cloud of green smoke. They all turn and watch as a small river of squirrels flows out of the bunker door.  As soon as the weak winter sunlight hits them, they wink out of existence, leaving only depressions in the snow to show where they’d been.
Dean wakes up all at once. It’s morning. Christmas morning. It’s not London in the 1800s, he’s not summoned out of bed by church bells, but he feels the same anxiety that Scrooge did when he threw open the window to ask what day it was. What actually beckons him down the hallway into the kitchen is the scent of coffee. The scent of coffee and the chance to talk to Cas.
“And you took him on, unarmed.” Cas is looking at him, shaking his head, a fond smile on his face. “What am I gonna do with you?”  Dean’s about to answer, but Meg comes running up and throws herself into Cas’s arms and hugs him tight.
“Dean,” His voice conciliatory, Cas reaches out and grasps Dean’s shoulder and pulls him around. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.” Dean’s caught off balance and stumbles a bit, ending up closer to Cas than he intended. Cas looks at him intently. His eyes are so blue, Dean’s transfixed, staring at them from far too close. Desire is simmering just under the surface of his skin. He makes the mistake of dropping his gaze to Cas’s lips. That’s all it takes. Cas moves closer, backing Dean up against the sandstone column. He closes the final few inches and kisses Dean.
After a while, Dean speaks. “Cas, I’m glad you kept it a surprise. I’ve never visited any place like this. I wouldn’t have believed you if you’d described it to me.”
She looks over and raises her arms threateningly towards them. Dean starts to lunge forward with the demon knife, but Cas stops him with a raised hand and speaks a stream of some foreign language to the woman. To Dean’s surprise, and evidently hers, she drops her arms to her side and answers Cas. Cas asks her a question and a rush of words tumble out. Cas listens, nodding, and answers her. They converse for a few minutes more, and she turns and walks to the trees on the other side of the glade.
“Picking out a bowl?” It’s pretty obvious from where Dean’s standing.
When Victor motions Dean to the Range Rover, he stows his gear in the back seat and swings into the passenger seat. Victor gets in the driver’s seat, and pulls away onto the road, the other car following. They bounce through the streets of Abéché and head north.
Dean looks uncomfortable. “The first time I saw you, in Abéché, you were wearing a trench coat when you went into Albert’s.”
Dean laughs. “And you didn’t think that they might want to wander into town to look for food?”
“Hey.” She drops a kiss on his cheek. “When you went radio silent I figured it wasn’t good news. I’ve got Thai food and cheap Argentinian shiraz and a plan.” He still doesn’t say anything but goes back to the couch as Meg bustles around the kitchen gathering plates and glasses and utensils. She takes the lids off the containers he’s unpacked onto the coffee table as he stirs himself to pour the wine.
“Clean living and not making a habit out of pissing off the locals.”
The lump under the covers next to him moves, disturbed by his reaching for his phone.
Dean tears his eyes away from Cas and checks his watch. “Hey, it’s nearly midnight.’ He grabs the remote and soon Times Square is on the large television, Christina Aguilera belting out something at top volume while prancing around in what looks like very weather-impractical sequins.
“I don’t think so.” He smiles at Dean, but it’s not a reassuring smile. ‘You don’t look like a doctor, and it’s a poor doctor indeed who allows himself to be injured like that. Tell me,” he continues, conversationally, “what happened to your leg?”
“I get around.”
“Fuck it, Sammy. We shoulda done more to make him feel welcome here.”
“The part about the bear attacking the main character reminded me of your trip to Churchill. Leo DiCaprio. Mmmm, that man.” she shakes her head and sighs dramatically, “So good looking.”
They hail a cab and head back to the university. Sitting in the back of the cab is heaven and hell. It’s a small car, so they’re nearly touching, and Cas has to remind himself to keep his mind on work. It seems like Dean’s forgiven him for running off, or is at least willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but his interest now seems to be in Cas’s work, not Cas’s body. And that’s Cas’s fault. The urge to touch Dean wars with his tactic of using shop talk to keep him at a distance. Cas has no idea what he’s doing. He’s in so far over his head.
Despite the pain in his leg, fatigue sneaks up on Dean and he slips between dozing and wakefulness. The sun’s below the horizon, and the sky still holds the lavender light of the sunset, but it’s dark down amongst the pillars of the labyrinth. It’s starting to get cold too, and his jacket’s in his backpack in the jeep. He hopes Cas gets back soon.
A slow smile breaks over Dean’s face as he turns back to Cas. “Well, I guess I just have one last question about this whole mess.”
“He’s not my boyfriend. Not anymore, not for a while. Not since well before New Year’s Eve.”
get an all-day breakfast, why would you not? Meg is dipping her fries in a pool of ketchup on the edge of the plate, not looking at him when she drops the first fish hook into the pool.
“Cas…” His voice is an entreaty.
“Your leg bothering you?” Meg asks.
“Ow. Ow. Shit, Okay,
“Dean!”
“Frogs? Are you sure? That sounds too big to be frogs. Like maybe raccoons or mountain lions, or...werewolves.”
“I’m sorry,” he says, wiping away actual tears of laughter. “It’s a good look for you.”
“Sure we can.”
She sits back with a satisfied smile as the plane begins its descent into Edinburgh.
is pretty apt, Dean thinks. Gabe pulls up in front of them with a brown-haired, bearded man riding shotgun. He kills the engine and the sound of Supertramp comes to a halt.
“I could get you killed, Dean,” he’d said, miserable, smoothing the bandage and taping it down over the injury that Sam had just sutured closed on the motel room bed. Dean had tipped his head back and washed down two painkillers with the rest of the whiskey in his glass.
Interrupting Dean’s griping, the waitress brings two bowls of pho over and deposits a plate with bean sprouts, sprigs of basil and quarters of limes on the table. Dean inhales. The aroma of the broth and the slices of rare beef and shrimp wontons floating atop the long rice noodles is enticing. Cas starts plucking the basil leaves off one of the sprigs, rolling them up and then ripping them into little pieces and dropping them in his soup. Dean watches him.
“Oh, you don’t know what I’m thinking, Clarence.” Her smile is back to wicked again, and Cas blushes.
“Dean. Stop.” Cas’s voice is very calm. “I can’t let you make that call.”
remains unsaid, but hangs there regardless.
, he doesn't have a good explanation for being in the hallway. Quickly, he opens a door to his left and steps in, shutting it behind him. It‘s dark, but he can tell he’s in a janitor’s closet, he can smell the cleaning products and feel steel shelving pressing against him. Steel shelving and something else. Something warm and firm and chest-shaped.
“How do you even know what to do with all the extra stuff?” he asks. There is so much he still doesn’t know about Cas.
Cas rolls his eyes. “As riveting as this all is, I’m sure Dean wants to drop off his bags and get a drink. See you later at the Bucket?”
a cop out Jo,” he snaps. But she’s gone. The world turns upside down for a moment, and then Dean’s on his bed again, the ticking of the clock on his bedside table the only sound.
Cas answers: “Dean cast a spell, you better come outside and see what he did, so we can fix it.” Cas sighs heavily, the weight of the world sitting squarely on his shoulders.
Moving to Toronto for a year to fill in for a professor on sabbatical was out of character for him, scary, even, considering his regimented plans for advancing his career, and Meg seemed to know this. She started by bringing him coffee, then inviting him places, not letting him spend all his time brooding alone. This year at the University of Toronto was supposed to be about career progression and a safe place to lick his wounds after his breakup with Michael. It had turned out to be much more, and Meg’s friendship was to thank for that.
. There’s a bar on the first floor of the convention centre and there’s an informal lounge being run in the main entryway hall bankrolled by a big gold-mining company. Cas makes his way to the latter, buys a beer and sits down heavily on one of the easy chairs scattered in groups across the carpeted floor.
Cas backs up in a hurry and stands indecisively in the corridor. Oh God. How could Jessica do that? On her wedding day? To Dean? What can he do about it? What
“Are you exclusive with those cream puffs in the kitchen? Or could I take you out sometime?"
. If Phil can confess his feelings, so can Dean. He takes a deep breath.
“They’re all here,” Meg says, changing the subject, “all eight of the girls who’ve been kidnapped in the last month.”
After Dean leaves, Cas looks around the kitchen. He pulls out his phone and finds a Gordon Ramsay YouTube video on profiteroles and watches it twice. Huh. Profiteroles are another word for cream puffs. Who knew?
You're the only one who really knew me at all
“I can take it from here,“ Cas says, not wanting Dean to see exactly how not at home he is in a kitchen. “Go. You should get back to your guests, and Jessica.” Dean looks confused for a moment, then smiles at Cas.
Dean and Meg continue walking, slowly due to Dean’s leg. He’s sure that his injury is the main reason he’s been given the run of the camp, escape would be pretty hard when he can’t run. The rocky walls that surround the valley are steep and formed of crumbling sandstone. They’re almost uniformly high, too, except for one place at the back of the valley where a split in the rock runs up at an angle from the valley bottom, a fault that has split the ridgeline into a sharp notch. There’s a small patch of gravel and stones at the bottom, evidence that it becomes a watercourse during the rainy season. Dean tries not to be obvious about checking it out. It’s kind of steep, but it definitely looks climbable. He files that away for future reference before he and Meg head back towards the tent where he spent the night.
Cas laughs. “I really am sorry about your leg. I didn’t want to hurt you but, newsflash, you’re kind of stubborn, and it was the only thing I could think of that would stop you. Good thing stubbornness isn’t a dealbreaker in a boyfriend.”
It’s not Gabe and a random woman in the coatroom. It’s Jessica. And the long-haired groomsman. Making out passionately.
So what’s he going to do about it? Cas enumerates the problems he’s going to have to overcome to talk to Dean again: Dean lives a thousand miles away, he doesn’t have Dean’s phone number or address, he doesn’t even know Dean’s last name or where he works.
. Eastern Gray Tree Frog.” He goes back to reading his book, absent-mindedly sliding his reading glasses up his nose.
Dean smiles. “Getting lucky.”
Where previously, thoughts of Michael were what distracted him the moment he let his mind wander off the well-traveled tracks of research and teaching, now, unaccountably, it’s Dean. On the streetcar home, on his daily run, and lying in bed at night with only Spock for company, he finds himself replaying that night in Churchill. The feel of Dean’s body on his. The feverish kisses. There’s no off switch, and when he finally falls asleep in the wee hours of the morning, his sleep is thin and fitful and full of half-remembered dreams of loss and sadness that follow him into his mornings like a clinging grey fog.
“Yeah, we lived together.”
Dean tears some of the lining out of his jacket and makes a pad to press gently on the wound.
“OK, so let’s go over the plan one more time,” says Sam.
“Uh.”
Cas spends the next twenty minutes crossing the room, going up and down the aisles looking for Dean, but he’s nowhere to be found. He nearly accosts a man who looks like Dean from the back, almost grabbing his arm, before realizing it’s not him. It’s no use. Dean’s gone. Dejected, Cas makes his way out the double doors and back onto the convention centre concourse. There are two more days left of the conference. If he haunts the convention centre, he has a chance of seeing Dean again. Apologizing for leaving. Maybe see if Dean feels anything like the way he does.
“I just need to make sure you’re not going to fall over, then you’re all on your own. Scout’s honor.”
Zachariah appears in the doorway. “Dr. Novak. I ran into a friend of yours downstairs and showed him up here. Before you leave, please come to my office, we need to talk about your grad students.” He disappears and then Cas’s stomach drops as a tall man walks into the room.
“Sure it is. I talked myself into believing that I could care enough for the both of us. You did me a favor when you left. I was too stupid to realize it at the time. Tell me, were you seeing someone else?”
