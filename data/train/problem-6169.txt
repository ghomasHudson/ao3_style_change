“Don’t you have your own?”
Tony Stark is running.
“Steve can’t be sick. He’s perfectly fine. He brings me apple slices everyday. He likes to sketch trees and bird and sometimes, me as well. We talk all the time and he likes to listen to me rant saying that he’s always be there for me-“ Tony sucked in a shaking breath. “This can’t be true. He’s fine. He’s fine. He’ll always be fine.”
He remembered coming home after a couple of days at Rhodey’s.
“Betrayal!” He exclaimed as Steve started to laugh - a sound so soft it made Tony stare - and pushed an apple slice into his hand.
“I’m not a kid anymore.” He had replied, reminiscing the dreams he used to have of one day being a superhero. A dream he left behind already. Maybe too soon. “I’m obviously going to follow in my father’s disastrous footsteps, take over the company and live out the rest of my life feeling like a copy cat.”
If one person could see that, it should have been Tony.
Tony laughed, ripping up the cheque but keeping the note and ring in a small velvet box he hoped to bring out one day.
“Well, aren’t you a gentleman? I am delicious enough to eat-“
“Handsome and irresistible?” Tony guessed with an amused expression.
“Tony!”
“Where do you think you’re going?”
Tony gently removed his hand and held it tenderly. “I could write a whole love letter to you if you want. You seem to be fond of the old fashioned ways used to express love to one another. Trust me, I can be the Shakespeare that never reached success and only drank cheap whiskey in expensive wine glasses.” Tony snickered as Steve shook his head fondly. “I loveth thee. Thou art mine own dawn.”
,” Tony started, his words so venomous, it scorched his tongue. “the same thing to you on the night mom died but you never listened, did you?”
Bucky gave him a sad smile. “The idiot’s pretty good at hiding things and making people believe he’s okay.”
“Hi, Tony.” His blue eyes are shining with unshed tears.
“You wanted to spend homecoming night with him.”
He was expecting Steve to not be sitting on the bench, apple slices in hand, a thoughtful look on his angelic face as he waited for Tony to come running. A small part of him wished he was waiting.
Pepper and Rhodey found him later, curled up on the bench, bathed in the honey glimmer of dawn.
“Stop messing up my room, Tones.” Rhodey grumbled as he picked up the pillow and threw it back.
“Special? Then, he’s more than a friend.”
“I’m good, I’m good.” Tony said as he turned away from the gang. “Always good, always will be good.”
Tony’s one for personal space and doesn’t even bother to hide it.
“He talks about you a lot.”
“It’s time for me to go.” Tony said without a another glance at Steve. He could feel his eyes on the back of his neck, the delicate glance that was met with a dead end and nothing more. Tony moved on and left Steve with the apple slices they could have shared together, the sound of his heart breaking piercing his ears.
Tony knew that well. From the coasts of LA to the industrial civilisation of London - Tony was lucky to see all. Unfortunately, having a father like Howard Stark accompanying you ruined the experience.
“It’s fine, my dear Steve! I find it much more easier to blame it on my so called father. He’s a douche.”
“Have you asked anyone to homecoming yet?” Pepper asked as Tony sank into a chair next to her, exhaustion clouding his eyes.
He wished it was a joke. Maybe Steve wasn’t really sick and this was just a prank to see how Tony would react. That would obviously hurt Tony but it was better than him crying on a bench by himself.
“Was your father in the house with you?”
Tony had remembered Steve laughing and the way his shoulders moved to the soft chime of the sound. Tony couldn’t help but stare, content with the way he made Steve smile. He loved it and thought that everything about Steve was perfect, so radiant it blinded Tony. It didn’t matter how many times Tony messed up, ruined his life, destroyed himself over and over again - he knew Steve would still be there. He wanted this to last forever.
He was a genius. Numerous times was he close to winning the shouting match against his father - only to fail once more and run until his legs broke down and his body collapsed. Even if he was a genius, this was the one thing he couldn’t solve. And it infuriated him to no end. Birds chirped in interest as he stomped through the park, kicking pebbles aside in frustration. Pushing his father to the point of rattling the household with his uncontrollable rage gave Tony some satisfaction as he scrambled out the house, laughing his head off like a maniac. Tony hated his father, maybe despised him if he was brave enough, and knew that his father must have felt the same way. This time though, he wasn’t laughing his head off like a maniac. He was limping, carefully treading on his feeble legs in hopes that fatigue wouldn’t pull him down. He didn’t know it, but he was tired. Tired of these pointless shouting matches and losses, tired of not being able to just talk to his father like any normal son would-
That’s how it always works. Tony runs a marathon and his prize at the end was a therapy session with Steve. It was nice, honestly, because Tony wouldn’t know where else to go. Steve was patient, always - for him - and he couldn’t risk losing the warmth that Steve provided.
“Here,” Steve says when he returns from outside. “Got a sandwich for you.”
Tony huffs out a laugh, sounding insincere. Steve is hit by the sudden desire to try and make Tony stop laughing like that. “Guess so.”
The Captain needs to live, but…
shield.
Tony shrugs. “It’s just the first time she’s heard it,” he says, and drops it. “Anyway, did you not feel something very wrong with her brother?” he asks, eyes sharpening pensively.
“It’s not like you didn’t know that something would go wrong,” Tony says flatly, looking towards Natasha. “You knew I hadn’t been able to fix the shield when I gave it to you.”
“Only when stabbing with a sword would get me banished from about seven realms, yes,” Steve says.
Steve can’t bear it. “Let’s go,” he says firmly, breaking Tony’s focus. The ball of magic dissipates, but an eerie dark afterimage remains in the air. Tony grimaces. “Ground zero isn’t here.”
Tony seems to trust Loki, which Steve does not understand. “Last we met, Loki tried to stab me,” Steve says, which earns a look of displeasure from Tony.
“Be safe, Tony,” Steve says, exhaling. He takes a step closer to the swirling red and it flares, reaching out, trying to latch onto Steve. Steve locks his jaw.
“Yeah, it wasn’t,” Tony lies. “It was the Purple Man.”
Steve walks into the tower, unhindered, the wards slipping off him like water. The thing about a world dominated by sorcerers who think they can build whatever they want using magic is that they never expect someone like Steve, who is immune.
Bruce frowns at him, then directs it at Tony.
He wanted something better than that. He didn’t know he could come close to having anything like this.
“Boom,” Tony echoes, sounding chilled. “A—a bomb. Shit. We shouldn’t…” he trails off.
“They’re strong, loyal beings,” Steve says. Giselle’s fur is a bright auburn, warm through his fingers. He hasn’t seen one in such a healthy condition in a while. She seems to have a fake back leg, Steve notes. He recognizes the magic signature, it’s incredibly immaculate magic woven together to create something that moves so organically yet has an admirable strength.
“I guess it was that easy for you to shake me off too, huh. Y’know what, I think I’m fine with being happy for once, Steve.”
He has taken the iron from his blood and made a suit, armor that is supposed to protect and not attack, but it was only ever supposed to be from his own blood, not from others. The world shouldn’t have had to pay. The armor shouldn’t have to protect the world from himself.
“It’s fine. I heal fast,” Tony repeats, disregarding that he has a hole in his stomach, which seems to concern Steve a lot more than it should.
“They would say it’s well-deserved,” Steve says. “And then I’d have to disappoint them by confessing it was due to the interior decoration, and not the politics.”
“And much more genuine than most humans I’ve met. I spoke with him on the elevator coming up,” Steve says cheerfully.
, is for all to see. Steve doesn’t think he’ll be fond of working with this sorcerer much. Magic users usually keep their name to themselves. Names have power, after all. A man like Tony Stark, hanging his name up high for all to take? It’s bold. A very bold move. The future is always a strange place, but Steve feels like he’s walked into an alternate dimension.
“The world won’t end if we do nothing,” Steve says, standing out in the open. “Most people would like the sound of that.”
“Good to hear you say that, glad you can appreciate it when you know gold can’t buy everything,” Tony says, sounding somewhat amused, but it sounds forced, like there’s something more fragile in his voice that he wants to mask. Worry, Steve thinks. “Not in this economy. Everyone’s after diamond these days.”
Tony’s eyes flash darkly. He has never given his trust freely. He doesn’t like to be betrayed, he never expected that from Steve. They were so happy, and now Steve doesn’t want that? He chooses a broken world over a better one with Tony?
Then, Bruce looks towards Steve, turning uncomfortable as his eyes take in Steve’s armor. “Uh. Tony, that’s… that’s dragon scale.”
Tony wants to sear this moment into his mind, never forget how it feels to have Steve thrusting his hips, fucking his mouth hard because Steve just can’t help it. He savors the noises Steve makes in the silence, the way his breath stutters and his moans of Tony’s name sound like a prayer, a plead, a beg. When Steve comes, Tony swallows every last drop, breathing hard and shivering with pleasure.
Under the dying sun, Tony sees tears in Thanos’ eyes. “I did not get to decide.”
Just because Steve can’t do something, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to.
Tony stiffens. The light in his hands instantly dies, the sparks gone. The armor around his hands seem to emit a soft, fading glow, before they leave the two of them in complete darkness. He turns around to peer at Steve with narrowed eyes. “Now, how did you know that?” he asks. “I do hope Fury didn’t include dear me in your little contract. I can sue over a lot less.”
The storm picks up, howling, white blanketing the ground thickly.
The place shows all the wealth Steve is used to seeing (no, not used to, not really). It reminds Steve of the Faerie realm, when one of the Fae called upon Steve to defend herself. The Court was grand too, though in a different manner. It was all mysticism, flowers and candlelight, like walking in a dream.
But Steve isn’t here for him, barely even looks at Tony before he throws his shield at the Purple Man. Tony frowns and flies to jump on the shield, slamming it down to the floor with a loud bang. He picks it up and narrows his eyes, then tilts his head to the side.
“Coulson is gonna love this,” Fury sighs. “The Howling Knight can deal with the magic.” Natasha wonders how many layers of headache one can get, because Fury’s probably going to break his own record. The Knight is not going to be easy to summon and sustain. “He can get Tony Stark to deal with the runework.”
Being sorry isn’t enough. It simply can’t happen again.
“What isn’t,” Tony says, and he’s amazed how steady he is right now. He’s frozen in horror, realizing that he himself is the one who has to be convinced, not Thanos.
Steve knows this is a bad situation. He wouldn’t have been summoned otherwise. It takes a lot of energy to summon a Knight.
It’s very odd, Tony directing that at Steve. He doesn’t know how to react. “It’s always history,” Steve says.
Tony thinks about Stephen Strange’s words. He thinks about the Tony Stark in that other universe, the one who may have saved the world.
“Good night,” Steve says, turning away.
“It’s really fucking hilarious, Dad,” Tony laughs when Howard is back from his trip and finally asks, in the most bored tone, what Tony’s mark is.
Steve has all of a human’s weakness, though. He looks at Tony, who looks back with wide, wet eyes, and he’s absolutely breathtaking, stunning. It hurts, even though it makes him stronger than he’s ever felt.
He gives Obie the benefit of the doubt, because as much as he thinks he can’t believe or trust others, he really does want to.
Steve twirls it in his hand. It seems to turn to white smoke when he breathes on it, lost with the long exhale into the air. He reaches out with a hand, trying to catch the trace of magic, but it fades away into the night.
“That wasn’t my actual workshop. You think I’d have let you set foot in it that easily? But sure, yeah. People try,” Tony says, off-handedly. “Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes that doesn’t matter.”
“That’s not—You’re not the only weapon. He forced you, and all of us, to believe it was a good idea, but you knew it wasn’t. That’s why you never do anything like that when you’re you,” Steve reasons. “You’re a good man. And we’re the Avengers, we stick together. If one of us falls, we catch them. If you fall, I’ll catch you.”
“Oh.” Steve looks to Giselle. “I—I didn’t mean that,” he says, even though part of him kind of did. The part that expects this kind of thing from humanity in general. “I’ve never seen a griffin not partnered up by the military, and you’re not military, so I…” he trails off. “I’m sorry.”
“I didn’t know this many people lived in Sokovia,” Steve says.
Tony feels the urge to laugh. He wonders if Steve’s got a masochistic streak in him. Why does he care about a monster? No, really. Tony’s mermaid file literally labels him as a monster. “Aren’t you supposed to be Captain America, not Captain Obvious?” he asks, words stuck like his throat is being constricted by a net. One, he hates nets. Two, he really does not want to shift right now.
Steve swallows, blinking. “Okay,” he says hoarsely, remembering this feeling of being inside Tony to the hilt. When he starts to thrust, he lets out a moan, mixing with Tony’s panting. He moves, in and out with the urgency of the starved, the ones who have a countdown to their lives. Tony whimpers, Steve fucking him hard but careful to not make Tony hurt. He feels like this where he belongs, and there might be a name for this, but Steve can’t say it, he just whispers
“Not real,” Tony tells it, because that’s better than saying yes or no. He’s always been better than Steve at lying, maybe he can believe himself this time. He supposed that doesn’t matter, though. As long as he convinces Steve.
“It got us what we needed to know,” Tony says. “It’s the Scarlet Witch, the locals are in on it.”
Stuck underwater.
Steve coughs, catching her attention.
There’s an excitement in his eyes, as though Steve Rogers is most pleased to meet Tony. And that’s weird, right. See, kids say they want to see Captain America. Only people with ulterior motives want to meet Tony Stark, with either a paycheck or a whip, it’s fifty-fifty.
“Nuh uh, no ropes here, they’re happy to help Iron Man out,” Tony says. “Right JARVIS?”
Tony draws back so he can see Steve’s expression. He reads pain there and wants to write pleasure on Steve’s body, code it into his bones so he will always remember Tony.
“You’re alive, aren't you?” Steve asks when they clean up and Tony is sitting in the tub again. They’re somewhere in the middle of Nevada, and Steve says the lead was a false one, again. Is he even trying? Tony is getting impatient, and he is really fucking starving now, he can’t sleep and his insides are twisting, coiled into something that cannot be held.
“It’s fine,” Steve says quickly, throat constricting. He’s still shocked that Tony thought of— “A fake relationship.”
“It was a risk,” Tony says. “For you to answer it. Infiltrate the place and find me.”
“Tony...” Hands are coming around him in some sort of embrace, and this is a hug, not fighting, this is warmth, not ice. This is Steve’s voice cracking in a promise, “It’s okay, it’s okay.”
He is the Merchant of Death, but he’s not very interested in selling something he doesn’t wish to buy. Death had never really been what he was after, he used to think that they were doing the right thing despite death, but it turned out that the name was quite apt.
“I haven’t been summoned in a while. Magic has fundamentally changed,” he says coldly. “I understand that the last rune war didn’t end very well.”
Knight by my side. There’s no place safer, Cap.”
“I have never heard you utter a single spell,” Steve says.
“I wanted you to save me. I still do,” he doesn’t say, because he finds out how good a person Captain America is. He knows that, if he asks it of him, Cap will try, and when he inevitably fails, he’ll blame himself. No point in that.
Steve crying? That’s just... wrong. It doesn’t happen. Shouldn’t.
Tony raises his eyebrows at Steve, then looks back at the rune. “Could be
“Give me the gauntlet,” Tony says, but he barely feels himself speaking. These are just words. He is weak. “Or tell me that this world is better without who you love.”
“Great,” Tony says. “Thanks for having such a recognizable mark.”
Steve pulls out and kisses Tony, sighing into him. Tony kisses back languidly, like they have all the time in the world.
Steve’s hair is all wet. Tony wants to run his fingers through it, drag his claws over Steve’s scalp, hear Steve moan and cry his name. Tony’s eyes shutter and he gasps, a frisson of pleasure igniting a hunger he hasn’t felt before Steve.
“Forget-me-not, huh,” Tony says.
There are shadows of people on the wall. The shadows shudder when Steve and Tony walk by them, falling down into ashes.
That would make Tony feel better, but it wouldn’t help Steve, he thinks. Also, he doesn’t think Steve wants to touch Tony right now, he can’t possibly. Tony’s just sick for wanting to feel Steve’s warmth again, wanting to...
In the baths after: he practices, you see. Water on skin, sinking into it. Sink past the nose, the eyes, the hair—feel the heaviness of the water. Sink a little deeper each time and hope it will wash away the freezing sensation of drowning.
Steve looks at Tony, not really believing it, even though Tony isn’t lying. How is he supposed to? “The world needs the Captain,” Steve says quietly. It’s something he’s been told for a very long time.
He doesn’t indulge in those kind of fantasies again.
“It’ll take both of us to deal with that rune. You know it,” Steve says. “Or was that an order to a slave?” he asks, echoing Stark’s previous sentiment.
Tony laughs, terrified. “Not really. I forced yours, I’m the one who didn’t let you stop me. I—I took off the armor for a reason. Just so you know, you should knock me out next time. Or kill me. I give you permission. There you go.”
. He looks at Tony, who smiles at him, eyes bright, warm.
Steve’s heart aches. “They’ll understand. The Scarlet Witch will help us, and she has the city’s favor.”
“Yeah. I bet,” Bruce says.
“You eat…” Steve looks sickened. He’s noticed that Tony doesn’t eat, then. His mind must be going through stories about mermaids, sirens, monsters. Tony’s not the only merperson to have existed, after all.
The vendor hates it too. “The Scarlet Witch,” he snaps, “has done so much for us. She and her brother have made Sokovia a much better place.”
“Can you really do that to Steve Rogers’ soulmate?” Tony asks.
“Right.” His gaze sweeps over Steve. “So you admit that soul contracting is just glorified slavery.”
“Huh. Alright.” Tony makes a face. “You’re right, you know. The rune war really did mess magic up. It’s so dangerous now.”
“In the old wars,” Tony says, nodding.
“You did,” Steve says hoarsely.
Right now, Steve holds onto that glacial feeling, lets it build inside, unyielding to any magic Loki may cast.
“Really, what, you can do psychic readings now? What’s your Word worth to me?” Tony asks. “Aren’t you supposed to be all counter-magic?”
Giselle makes a forlorn sound.
“I’m so glad you’re not wearing your enchanted armor right now,” Tony says with a laugh against Steve’s mouth, and snaps his fingers. His suit slips away to the side and Steve’s clothes fall beside them neatly.
“Well,” Tony says casually. “It fits their name. I bet they’ve been after it since SHIELD’s conception.”
Steve shouldn’t pry, there’s no reason for him to know Tony beyond his name. His name is all he shows to the world, anyway.
Once, Tony would say it’s because he’s expendable, that he would deserve it. Once, he would say it’s because he’s the only one capable of doing it. Once, he said he would rather cut the wire.
Tony’s mind is all he has left.
“You’re a billionaire,” Steve says, slowly becoming aware of his heart hammering against his chest. “You’ve got the gold, you can afford to break a few limits.”
“What happened to following my orders, Cap,” Tony wonders. “You were so good at it. My soldier.
Later, Steve decides. The time will pass either way. Might as well spend it on something he enjoys, for a while, for once.
,” Howard says angrily. Tony has never seen his father so furious, eyes bright with something Tony can’t decipher, and doesn’t particularly want to. “Steve doesn’t deserve a little
“We’re SHIELD. I’m the Director, Nick Fury,” the one-eyed man begins to say. Nick Fury. Steve knows—this is the man who’s signed the contract. His hand is still bloody. Steve knows what his intentions when signing the contract were. He wonders what Fury will tell him if Steve asks. That’s generally more important. “This is Agent Maria Hill and Natasha Romanoff,” he says, giving Steve all three of their names honestly. Usually names aren’t given so easily, Steve supposes Fury knows to not lie about that to the Captain.
“Why not?” Steve asks, feeling like he’s trapped in a tomb of snow. “What is this?” he asks, holding out the stem of the flower that doesn’t giggle, just dissipates into nothingness.
“What happened to taking my advice on not using magic?” Steve asks, feeling weak that he can’t do anything for Tony right now. It’s his fault Tony had to use magic again. His fault they’re stuck here.
In the end (what?), Tony undoes the rune and both of the stones vanish—except that was the whole point of all this, wasn’t it?
are not in your right mind right now, which is pretty impressive. Our plan may need some revision, if you can’t get close enough without… whatever this is. We need to get you into the city. Maybe some distance will help.”
Tony raises a hand, conjuring a magic ball. The door to the building slides open easily. “Scan,” he murmurs, sounding puzzled. The ball he conjures ripples, but remains colorless, negative for illusions. “Well, it’s not an illusion,” Tony says. “Or anything I recognize. But there’s definitely magic, it’s everywhere.”
Steve looks inside, remembers how he’s supposed to be hardened. But sometimes remembering a thing doesn’t make it true, because it comes much harder than it should be for him to look back at Tony, gaze steady.
Tony bares his razor sharp teeth in a grin, doesn’t miss the way Steve’s gaze catches on them, the way his jaw tightens as if he’s guilty, the way Steve hardens even more as if he enjoys the danger, needs it (needs Tony) to feel alive. “No. Of course not,” Tony says. “I know
“I know, I’m not great at making decisions. But you shouldn’t speak, you’re not that great at it either, Steve Rogers. I know it’s stupid to want you to care about me,” he continues. “But you can trust me. I wouldn’t have done anything stupid.”
It’s because Steve looks at him so softly sometimes that Tony wants to break apart and let Steve hold him.
Tony’s eyes flutter shut for a moment as he leans into Steve’s hand. “Has to be good for something, right?” he murmurs, and smiles at Steve.
Come on, Pepper. Smile, smile back.
“Different good, or different bad?” Steve asks.
“Well, no need to generalize like that. I’m pretty sure the kids who make spoons bend aren’t dangerous.”
in so
“I am,” Tony says. “Right.”
“Good for you,” Tony says, zapping something with his magic, a sharp jagged line of blue flashing around him.
Tony’s lips curve up. Finally. “Quite something, huh,” he says as he turns off the tap. He wants Steve to hear this.
For awhile, he hides it from his father. Not that it’s hard, since Howard’s not exactly there much. And no—he’s not
See—that’s how Tony wishes it went. In another world, it never goes this far. Or maybe it always does.
“Your arrogance. You think you are welcome in Sokovia,” Wanda says shortly, unimpressed. “You think you are welcome everywhere.” She doesn’t try to banish the two of them out of her cottage, so they’re okay. Probably. Steve’s had worse experiences with pissed off sorceresses.
Tony wants to laugh, but then he thinks he might never stop. Penance, salvation, regret, these words (almost) mean nothing, not when compared to the knowledge that Captain America is falling apart in his mouth. There is nothing submissive in the way Tony can speed his heart up, can stop it at any time.
“Fuck, what was that,” Tony says. “Steve, what’s happening to you,” he asks, terror closing around his voice, making it hoarse with urgency. “You, your hand—”
“I’ll see you in the morning, Tony,” Steve says.
Hm. If Steve does remember everything, then he is a better liar than Tony gave him credit for. Or maybe it’s been willful ignorance on Tony’s part.
“For you,” Tony spits.
“Do you know what that was?” Tony asks.
, isn’t that just great?
In the glint of the reflection of Steve’s shield, he catches a glimpse of shadows. He tilts it out of Tony’s line of sight.
“It was a long time ago,” Tony says, lips thinning. He makes a motion with his hands. “Kaboom.”
Tony looks at him. “You should come in,” he says, looking like he’s torn between wanting to convince Steve and wanting to not influence his decision. “Or are you going to sleep? I’m sure the Scarlet Witch has some effective sleeping draft, if you prefer that to… this.”
“Fine, okay,” Tony finally relents. “But you’re not telling SHIELD about where we’re going.”
Everybody snaps (Tony did).
“Alright,” Steve says. “Did you steal one to see if you could?”
This is better, Tony thinks.
Thanos doesn't laugh mockingly, but his smirk is one of cruel, wry amusement. Self-loathing, Tony recognizes. “The soul stone does not take the soul of the wielder, Stark. We both found that out the hard way. Keep your mind stone. What’s done is done.”
“You were sorry. You wanted to say it, didn’t you?” Steve asks.
Tony kisses Steve again, and this time Steve kisses back, opening his mouth and meeting Tony’s tongue. Tony continues rutting against Steve, hands moving greedily to touch more, fingers hooking in Steve’s pants.
Instead of baring his heart (who had ever said he had one?), Tony says, “Okay, I got business to do. Chop chop, was nice meeting you. Jarv will show you the way out.”
“That,” Tony says, “was me being polite instead of saying fuck off. Trial version is over now, though, so fuck off. Go hibernate or whatever it is you do.”
“You gotta be more specific, Cap, I’m not psychic—”
When they fix reality, gold is going to be important in Sokovia again. Steve sighs after Tony leads them onto a different path.
“We’re going for something more family friendly these days,” Fury says. “We prefer law enforcement agency.”
Tony holds back a shudder, holds back his emotions, holds back the truth. The mind stone asks for his sanity, but it is not reality.
“And that’s the problem.” Tony rolls his eyes. “Pretty, but mindless,” he mutters, then grins at him, saccharine. “Whatever—it’s your soul, your sale.”
He doesn’t want this. It’s not fair, Steve should still be here. But pain and death don’t have to be fair or right or make any sense. Sometimes it just fucking sucks.
“Iron Man, are you there? Tony—“
“I know someone who does,” Steve says.
Steve pauses, looking at him. It could be informative to hear what Tony thinks he is here for. “You know why,” he says simply.
“Holy shit,” Tony says, realization dawning. “You’re—the snow. It’s you, isn’t it? You’re basically Thor two point oh. I thought it was actually snowing in Sokovia.”
“You’re kidding,” Tony says. Then, “You’re kidding! Shit. Are they not extinct?”
There’s no ice to shield Steve’s heart now, nothing to prevent him from feeling all the emotions he’s been trying to hold back. He feels mortality in him—he feels reality in him. He’s just as alive and real as any of them. Just like Tony.
“Steve. I’ve wanted you for a long time,” Tony breathes, smiles so hard it hurts, words he’s dreamt of spilling from his lips, “so long. But imagination is nothing compared to the real thing.” He leans forward and searches for friction, grinding against Steve and moaning, kissing Steve’s neck. He’s already hard and he knows Steve can feel the bulge against his thigh. Steve makes a wrecked noise in the back of his throat.
Steve bristles, gripping his shield more tightly, then tries to rein in on his annoyance. “You know, your father summoned me before,” he says. War hasn’t stopped, he wishes it had, but it never does. People always find something to fight over, and Tony Stark seems to be very good at that. “Did he not teach you about contracting?”
“I’m sorry. It wasn’t your choice, Tony,” Steve finally says, says first. The rage is gone. Or hidden. Tony’s not so sure anymore. The memories tell him that Steve could never hide his rage, but they seem to be faulty these days. Maybe none of them knew Steve as well as they’d believed. “I wasn’t thinking.”
Everything seems too much and not enough after Afghanistan. Too much air to breathe, not enough to make Tony feel safe.
(Every single time?)
A beat. Two. Then, Tony starts to stroke Steve’s cock, feeling it grow hard in his hand. He should’ve done this earlier at the Raft. He licks at the head, tonguing the slit, and begins to suck, oh fuck, Steve tastes so
Tony looks at him. “I’m lucky she didn’t dream me out of existence, Steve.”
And that’s how they end up standing in front of a griffin.
Steve didn’t.
Fury takes out the crystal he keeps behind his eyepatch. So that’s what it is for. Natasha had wondered. “Wake up, Captain,” he says, activating the crystal to summon a shield.
“Aren’t you supposed to know?” Tony asks, raising his eyebrows. “Howling Knight of ye olde days, taking down evil sorcerers left and right. Back when magic wasn’t accepted, huh.”
Tony shrugs, as if it’s not something incredible. “And you don’t even need spells. I bet you had a court magician who waved oak wands around while chanting,” he says, ignoring the unspoken question. Steve really wants to ask why, but there’s something more pressing.
.” Steve grips both Tony’s wrists, stopping him from touching, but his usually firm grip is slightly shaky.
“What are you after,” Steve asks. “What do you want?”
Steve considers walking closer to the rift. He can see it clearly from here, but he needs to be closer. “Dancing, too,” Steve says, but is distracted by the cold, by the chill biting his bones.
“What gave it away,” Tony says, grinning. “The suit, or my unparalleled presence?”
Maybe.
“Maybe you are.” Steve murmured, just loud enough for Tony to hear and he stopped laughing to stare at him in awe. Tony wasn’t expecting that. The way Steve said it with so much thought, so much emotion, made it so believable. His cynical metal contraption of a heart swelled with joy and all he could wonder was why he couldn’t fix it.
sound he made. It was close to a banshee’s screech but was different, more relaxed, a more natural sound that sent tingles of joy throughout his body. It was a sound Tony didn’t know he could create.
This is routine. Tony couldn’t tell if he was sick of it. Even as he ran for the umpteenth time this week, dashing past rows of picturesque houses and towards the dawn - he still didn’t know if he could break it and leave it behind. A small part of him knew that it was never going to happen. He pounded the length of the street, zipping round the corner until he ceased in front of the Central Park. Central Park had trees that seem to kiss the sky. The sudden effects of running for endless miles caved in on Tony and he sucked in a breath he should have done a while ago. It hurt, so much so, it made him question why he falls into this routine every time.
“Anthony, your behaviour is shameful. You will listen to what I have to say-“
Tony stood, his hands clenched at his sides, a raging fire conjuring up within, blazing the trails of self control Tony might’ve had before his father shouted at him. “You’re right. She wouldn’t have wanted any of this. Of you being a self absorbed bastard. Of you messing up our lives again. Of you deciding that everything’s okay when you damn well know it ain’t.” He smashed his hands into his father’s shoulders and pushed him back with all the force he could muster. “You’re the reason she’s gone! This is all your fault, you hear me? THIS IS ALL YOUR-“
“You must be Tony.” Bucky said after a while, his eyes meeting Tony’s. He was confident, social skills reaching the maximum. Tony Stark could relate. Tony, however, sat uncomfortably in his own skin.
Yes, Tony Stark was a playboy that crashed the party and made it look good every time. If only Tony could keep the suit a little longer.
“Do you know what you want to be when you’re older?” Steve had asked him once when Tony slowed down to a stop for the fifth time since they met. Tony had hoped Steve was still there the next time. He always was.
“Tony?”
His father rose to his feet, speechless as Tony grabbed his suitcase and headed for the door.
“Aw, I guess you’re right. I have to make a big deal about everything.” Tony said jokingly as he fluffed up his pillows and smoothed down the blankets. Pepper caught his hand gently which made Tony look up with a questioning look.
“I’m good, everything’s good.”
“Steve.”
“You aren’t going. Don’t you understand? You. Are. Not. Going. Maybe it’ll teach you to have decency next time you go out again.” His father’s glare scorched Tony’s vision but he pushed through, slamming his fist against the wall.
Tony had thought about breaking routine for a very long time.
Steve smiled. “Well, if you think there’s other places out there, I would really like to see them.” He patted Tony’s hand with his own, his skin warm like glowing embers. Excitement ignited within Tony, crackling just under the skin.
This one’s going to last a while.
“Same as the last time.” Tony said, watching Steve pack up the apple slices in a small container. “Leave an amazing impression on the people around me - no surprise there - then once again lose it all to dear old pops.”
“It’s okay to be upset, Tony. I’m here to help.” Steve reassured him, his eyes soft with kindness. “I always need to make sure you’re okay.”
And he was.
“Only you’d use him as an outlet.” Steve said with a small smile. “You’ve always been someone who had so much energy - you give it your all.”
Tony sighed in frustration and threw a pillow across the room - a pillow that hit Rhodey right in the face as he walked in.
“Really? I don’t know - I’m kinda the anomaly. The lemon drizzle cake know one likes-“
“I’ve never noticed when I should’ve.” Tony said. He remembered small coughs here and there, pained expressions that were forced down with a happy smile. Steve was just as good as a master at hiding things as he was.
“Course not. This isn’t like the movies.”
“What time is it? Don’t tell me I’ve been in a coma for like three months.”
“It was one pillow.” He said as he cuddled it to his chest with a sad look. “Besides, your room needs a makeover. I’m doing you a favour.”
Pepper frowned, her brow quirking upwards. “Aren’t your parties always like that?”
He remembered punching his dad as soon as he saw him.
“Here. You must be hungry.” Tony begrudgingly took a bite out of the apple slice, grumbling. “What was it this time?”
“That’s very poetic, Steve. Ever considered being a poet?” Steve glared at him and Tony could remember finding it so cute he squealed - a manly squeal obviously - on the inside.
“You need to take me seriously, Tony. If anything, the sanity I have left will be spent making sure you won’t do anything stupid as your head gets bigger.”
“You ate them all, Tony.”
Those words aren’t always enough to satisfy the insatiable hatred that wound up his metal heart.
Dawn is warm as it glows, lighting them both up in its soft lustre.
The next time he goes to Central Park, someone else’s waiting at their usual bench.
Only to miss as he was toppling backwards. For a second, the chandelier was above him, a chrysalis of diamonds dangling in midair, before he was falling, down, down, down away from the diamonds that shone like stars.
Steve huffed in annoyance and moved the apple slice away from Tony. “At least I provide food when you need it.” On cue, Tony’s stomach rumbled at the thought of food and Tony looked down, feigning shock.
“Two days? From a fall down the stairs? That’s not even possible. That’s outrageous.”
Howard’s the reason why he couldn’t see Steve again.
Tony, however, could’ve died a gruesome death and nobody would ever notice.
It’s a routine. Tony raced through it, falling into place where he needed to be and always knew what he had to do. It was always the same. Go to school, laugh with friends, get the grades needed, come back home - and always make his father explode in rage.
“Tony?” He turned to face Steve who watched him with a concerned look, deep orbs of blue staring at him with longing. The unspoken words that Tony wanted to hear aloud latched onto him with an iron grip but the feathery voice that told him to go tore him apart like a boat sailing into a storm.
Tony flashed him a small smile before taking his seat next to him. “Sorry I... left.”
Tony drew a line between himself and the persona he carried with him ever since his mom died. It was difficult, the ground rock hard, scratching at Tony’s hand as he made the line clear. It was done. He was determined to make it last.
It’s more than annoying him, more than ‘I hate you’ but never enough for Tony.
“And,
“Anthony.”
“Tony! Oh my god, Tony!”
He clenched his fist, sinking his teeth into his left one. Steve would always comfort him by holding his hand, the gentle touches he left behind now painfully numb as sobs racked his body. He missed Steve Rogers and his dazzling blue eyes. Missed him and his tender smile and his stupid floppy blond hair and how he was amazing at drawing. He missed the way Steve would lean into him, seek his comfort and warmth, always offering to do the same for Tony. He missed Steve and his apple slices and his Brooklyn accent and the way he never gave up on anyone - especially Tony. And with that, Tony couldn’t hold it in any longer and silently broke apart. His routine was unravelled, slowly burning as he let out a strangled sob.
“It would allow me to go anywhere.” Steve gazed down at his sketchbook with a wistful look. “With this body, I’m a sitting duck.”
Bucky‘s expression tightened, his dog tags squeezed between his nimble fingers. His whole demeanour had changed and Tony couldn’t help but fear for the worst.
“I really hate you, Steve.” Tony grit his teeth, the words forced out with unstable anger. His wounds were gaping raw and he all he could do was cry and cry.
Dawn. Always there at dawn.
Tony didn’t feel whole.
“I can afford the booze though.”
Relief washed away as quickly as it had appeared, leaving Tony drenched in despair. The smile was gone giving way for the sunken expression on his face. Steve wasn’t there. Soon, he would be pulling on the suit, plastering a smile on for show.
“Please, will you spend homecoming night with me?”
“I thought so.”
Tony pulled his hand away from Steve. His heart was freezing, weakly ticking to the rhythm of his insecurities and forcing him to stand. He was a puppet, controlled by the strings of a life he stumbled through and always made to forget the life he could have lived. Tony didn’t like it. He wanted to break free.
For Tony, they will have to do.
“You tell us.” Pepper said as she crossed her arms and gave him a pointed look. “You didn’t even arrive fashionably late to homecoming - you didn’t even arrive at all - so Rhodey and I got worried and went to check on you-“.
“Wow, Tony.”
“You are stark raving mad.”
“Must be nice, coming from a long line of amazing inventors.”
“Shut up.” Rhodey sighed and gestured to the window. “Sometimes, I see you go to Central Park. You seem to be looking for him, aren’t you? You just can’t let him go.”
“More like annoying and bratty.”
He finds it strange that breaking routine would make him lose Steve but at the same time, it sets him free. This time he was living through life, stopping when he needed to, laughing when he wanted to and making sure he made the most of it.
Steve smiled. “Nice to meet you, Tony.” Tony couldn’t believe he was sitting next to a stranger - Steve - and talking to him but he didn’t feel lonely anymore. There was more to Steve, something he couldn’t describe. Tony didn’t know why he even bothered to sit next to him - he practically collapsed into the bench so maybe he was just tired - but there was something, something in the way Steve’s eyes shone with warmth and the soft smile that graced his lips.
He was too busy remembering the way Steve smiled, his crystal eyes sparkling with joy. The way he laughed when Tony made jokes and easily spilled every little secret he spent years trying to hide because he knew that he could trust him. He could always trust Steve. Steve could still be waiting, waiting with his apple slices and the never ending patience of a kid at Christmas and Tony would not show up again-
“Not true. Not true at all.”
His eyes were still open when he stopped falling but he wasn’t awake any longer.
“Want an apple slice?”
“Always repeating itself so nothing much can be said.”
“If you say it like that then I’m not sure you are.” Tony frowned at the stranger. He wasn’t used to people asking him if he was okay. His friends - well, the real ones - sometimes had the question hanging on the tips of their tongues but Tony would move on, make a joke, sing a song, always divert their attention away from him. He was a master at it; he’s been practicing for years. But now- now, a stranger he didn’t know could see right through him. Tony didn’t like that.
“Steve’s not another boy.” Tony turned away from his father and fixed his tie in the mirror before heading towards the door. “Now, I’m going to be horribly late if I don’t go so farewell-“
“I like lemon drizzle cake, Tony.”
“I... fell? Fell down the stairs? How the fuck did I just randomly fall down the stairs?”
“He doesn’t upset me.” Tony said bitterly before crossing his arms with dignity. “I do not get ‘upset’. Mostly passive aggressive.”
“Yeah.”
Tony Stark’s going to be having the time of his life.
Bucky smiles before fiddling with his dog tags again. He’s the opposite of Steve really - his laid back personality is different to Steve’s shy, caring one. Tony isn’t really annoyed - not anymore, he knows, because Steve taught him how to widen his perspective of things around him. Steve would always be the centre, no matter how many times Tony denied it.
It was easier to blame Howard though.
“Tony?” He didn’t even spare Rhodey and Pepper a second glance.
Tony allows Pepper and Rhodey to pull him onto the Pepper’s couch and sandwich him between their warm bodies. It surrounds Tony with a empyrean stillness which only makes him want to bury his head into a pillow and cry. He doesn’t though; Pepper and Rhodey make him watch old snappy comedies; they're smiling when he’s laughing so hard he can’t breathe.
Sadly, his emotions weren’t.
His father looked up, eyes widening at the sudden apology.
“He’s special, that’s why.”
Steve only gave him a look that made Tony laugh even more. It spilled into the air like bubbles and Tony was surprised by the
There was a part of him that knew it was his fault as well.
“Are you okay?”
“You can always come back for seconds!”
Tony turned to the people he called his friends. They were his friends, he knew that since he always made them laugh but he thought that maybe that’s why they were his friends. Just the class clown. Make them laugh and move on - no matter how much you wish to stop.
Tony hesitated for a moment knowing that he was still conversing with a stranger - Steve actually, the stranger’s name was Steve, so he wasn’t a stranger any longer. He shrugged and moved to sit next to him. “Tony.” He said. “That’s my name.”
Tony looked up. “Steve, I-“
“What your favourite colour?”
“Secure your own oxygen mask before helping others.” Steve had finally said, a thoughtful look crossing is face. “Save yourself before you save me.”
“I’d rather you save that favour for something else.” Rhodey chuckled as he sat down on the bed near Tony. “Now, what’s wrong?”
He’s glad that it made him happy at the same time too.
Steve blushed as Tony crooned, taking in the sight of his red face. “How I even put up with you, I will never know.”
It’s all for Steve anyway. Tony’s glad he’s able to repay the favour.
“What?” Tony shook his head and rubbed his eyes. “Oh. No. I don’t think I’m going.”
Tony looked away and started to climb the stairs. “Not in the mood.”
“And you? An artist? I’ve seen you sketch.” Tony had leaned over Steve’s sketchbook that day and indulged in the sight of Steve’s timidness as his work was on display. “You could be an artist, I’m sure.”
. And not always. He’s got places to be as well.”
Meanwhile, Tony’s going to burn until there was nothing left but ashes.
“After all the trouble you put me through with your reckless actions, you’d expect me to let you waltz around with another boy?” Tony froze and cautiously eyed his father with suspicion. His father’s rage that seemed to be bursting at the seams only made it clear that he knew about Steve.
“Tony! Are you coming or not?”
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean? That I’m not allowed to go out with someone I like?!” Tony glared, his eyes narrowing. “Is it because he’s a boy? Is it because you’re disgusted by me? That you hate the person I’ve become? Well, too bad because I’m not going to take orders from someone like you!”
Tony, who had been watching the clouds, looked down in amusement. “Why did I even bother asking? You look like the type to drown yourself in sky blue. Satin blue brings out your very pretty eyes.” He said with a smirk.
He dashed towards Central Park, the tangled thicket of trees lumbering like a beast laying down to rest. The wind seemed to cease as he stumbled over pebbles and squinted at the lights that shot from the horizon like fireworks. His breathe felt like icicles pricking his lungs as he halted in front of the bench. He panted, a smile of relief tugging at his lips.
And all the memories came flooding back. Tony’s eyes widened as he sprung up in bed and made a hassle to get out of the blankets. Rhodey and Pepper stood up in protest.
“Tony.” He said, his eyes a warm blue that accompanied the rising sun. “You’re here.”
“How have you been?” Steve asks with a fond smile as he wraps his arms around Tony and buries his face into his hair. Words could spill, emotions flaring - they always have - but for once Tony chooses not to say anything.
“Steve.” He said before he was running out the room.
“I also forgive you.”
“You’re not being fair, Steve. Asking me to save myself. How about you?” His voice wobbled and his eyes burned with tears. “Dumbass. Dumbass Steve. If you die, I’m personally going to resurrect you just so I can kill you again.”
Steve blushed, his cheeks tainted red. “Stop that. Why do you always do that?”
Of course Steve knew that. Tony could remember telling Steve everything about him, all his problems, his insecurities, his dreams - Steve was a book that held the pages that made up one messed up Tony Stark. He was a book that should’ve been destroyed long ago but instead held onto for just a bit longer.
Without another word, his father yanked him by the collar and pulled him back until he stumbled towards the wall.
Rhodey frowned in disapproval. “Homecoming isn’t going to happen again, Tony. Once in a lifetime opportunity. Don’t miss out, man.”
“You didn’t. It was my fault anyway.” Tony sunk into the seat next to Steve and shuffled closer to him; his warmth was tempting.
Steve is part of routine now. That wasn’t even supposed to happen. When Tony rewinds the clock and falls into place, everything else is stringed along with him. At different times, moments will replay, a whirlwind of excitement and rage, before he’s whisked away and out of the house, knowing Steve would be there to comfort him. And he always does.
“Steve.” Tony said before he wraps his arms around Steve, burying his face into his neck. The scent is comforting and Tony scrunches up his nose, not wanting to cry.
“You’re not just a sideline fling, Steve. You’re like the big deal, the diamond in the rough or whatever.”
“I actually mean it, Tony. Really, I do. There’s something about you that tells me that you could choose to be like everybody else but instead you decided to soar towards the stars.”
“You must know Steve.”
He doesn’t wait for a reply and walked out the door into the arms of Pepper and Rhodey. He’ll manage on his own from now on.
Tony went silent as soon as the pain blossomed across his face. The blow struck his face hard, hard enough to crack his skull but the only thing that burned was the rage, a fire stirred up by the devil, still inside of him. He clocked his hand back, a fist forming and thrust it forward-
Bucky squeezed his shoulder. “Don’t start kicking yourself over it. Believe me, I’ve done that enough already. Steve’s okay, though. He’s going to be alright. We’re leaving for London tonight to get Steve the treatment he needs.”
“Yeaaah, it’s still not iron, Thor,” Tony says. “I’m not looking to fight anyone who forges with iron, that’d be unfair to them. But we’re not fighting faeries these days. I’m not even financially partnered with the fae, there’s literally no connection, why would I use iron?”
The odds have always been impossible, but somehow Tony has survived every single thing thrown at him so far, has survived every single thing he’s thrown himself at so far. He doesn’t die.
Believing he’s where Thanos is must not have been enough. He thought he could feel the pull of the other stones when he focused, when he dreamed, but...
“Ser Romanoff,” Tony says. “Fancy seeing you here.”
“Speak for yourself,” Tony says, then turns to Bruce. “Bruce, hey, I’m here on important business.”
Hunger used to always be about survival, but there is no survival here, not for both of them.
He’s not here to make friends.
“When Heimdall told me the good Captain was on the way as well, I was delighted.” Thor smiles reassuringly. “Worry not. We are not weak like Midgard’s genies. We do not share the same limits.”
“That’s convenient,” Steve says. “Do you think sex magic will work between us?”
He says it so coldly that Tony realizes he really means it, is seriously considering it. His father is going to throw him away because he’s of no use to him or to Stark Industries anymore. People without living soulmates aren’t stable, aren’t reliable, aren’t worth the time or faith.
“Uh, what? No,” Tony says, sounding offended. “JARVIS is not some wandering spirit. Don’t be rude.”
“I am,” Tony lies. “That’s why I’m dying.”
His soulmate is dead. He gets it. He’s fine. After all, he’s Tony Stark, he doesn’t actually need anyone.
“You know that’s not true,” Tony says. With a frown, he turns to look at Steve, who looks tired, too. He doesn’t need as much sleep as the rest of them, but Tony doesn’t like seeing him losing it. Now he knows exactly why. “It was all ideas
Tony averts his gaze. “The city deserves to know,” he says. “If they’re all going to die again, they…” He looks tired.
“That makes no sense, Tony,” Steve says, frustrated. “You’re not one to give up. Are you? Tell me.”
Steve’s expression falls. He can’t manage a smile here, not anymore. “It’s just pretend,” Steve says. “I understand.”
Steve exhales. “You have no idea how impressive it is that you’ve created something like this.”
country.
Steve shuts his eyes, tries to find his focus. He presses his palm on the center of his shield, feels the power there. He can’t let himself wander away. He’s in this world right now. This time. With Tony.
“Because you weren’t there,” Tony snaps, words suddenly heated, angry, and Steve wonders if Tony has ever wanted to summon him before. Wonders if Tony has ever tried. “You’ve missed a lot during your sleep,
Tony chokes on his sobs. “Nonono,” he moans, trying to block out the terrible arousal but it’s there, colored black with strokes of fear and guilt. Shame and desire heat his blood, because the problem is none of what he’s done or said was a lie. It’s all true. He squeezes his eyes shut and sits down on the floor, leaning against the wall that cruelly doesn’t swallow him up.
“The signature is very strong.” Steve looks at it consideringly, thinking Tony should at least be proud of this. “I’ve never felt anything like it.”
(Who?)
Tony is alone, lying down in a pool of blood. Endless red. Endless red. He barely has the energy to feel anything other than a mute, hollow anguish.
“Tony, it’s considered foolish to give your name to the public, and yet you add it to everywhere you can, including a tower that everyone can see,” Steve points out.
Tony doesn’t say sorry, doesn’t mock him, just watches him thoughtfully.
“You paid way more than double,” Steve says with a shrug.
Steve feels awkward, but he can’t let Tony see that. “Respect isn’t a joke,” he says, trying to maintain his usual cool composure, unaffected, like the memorial statues of the Captain.
Steve looks at Tony curiously. Tony’s eyes, completely neutral, flicker over to meet his gaze fleetingly.
“You’re not going to give up,” Steve says.
“What, no, no. That’s a terrible idea, you should stay,” Tony says. “Right here.” He trudges over, putting a hand on Steve’s chestplate. His mask has shifted up to reveal his face, and he looks a touch confused, scared. Lost. Like he’s looking for something, and can’t believe Steve is there. “You’re real…?”
“Thief? Oh, that’s funny,” Tony hisses, ice in his glare. Wrath, undiluted hatred. “Coming from you, after what you took.”
Steve looks at Tony. Steve can’t defend Tony here, not for what happened a long time ago, not for something Steve isn’t entirely sure about. It feels like nothing about Tony is really certain. “Tony—“
Steve takes a moment to process that. Their suspect seems equally surprised. Tony said he had an idea to make Scarlet Witch underestimate Steve, but…
“No,” Tony says. He laughs lightly. “Who could ever forget you, Steve?”
“I didn’t want you to feel what it’s like to lose your world,” Steve says.
“Why do you never use that sleeping draft you have?” Steve asks. “I’m going to start thinking they’re poisoned.”
“I give you my Word I won’t tell anyone what you’re working on,” Steve adds. “I swear on my shield.”
Steve feels—uncomfortable. He doesn’t know what to say.
“What…”
Tony stares. “I’ve lost everything,” he tells him, because it is true.
“Legacy,” Tony says, and grins, all teeth. “Yes. What a legacy, Cap. SHIELD ensures that the world stays broken, you know. You shouldn’t be so quick to idealize anyone.”
Steve blinks, surprised at the sense of life he feels. That’s what was strange. The suit feels like it has something sentient running it, but not with something quite like human mana.
Tony pulls Steve in for a kiss, fierce and desperate like he’s afraid Steve might vanish again.
That doesn’t work, and Tony won’t make the same exact mistake of waiting. After all, Tony has never had Steve Rogers in the first place, there’s nothing to wait for.
“I’m sorry, too,” Tony says.
“Don’t think that means much when you’re immune to that kind of binding oath, Cap,” Tony says.
Tony never could hold it up.
Tony laughs. “Yeah,” he agrees with a trace of wonder in his voice, a hint of reverence. When Steve glances over, he catches Tony looking at him. Tony looks back at the rift quickly. “You must be used to things like this,” he says. “I mean, you’re ancient and pretty much ageless. That’s a good way to sightsee all the wonders of the world, be there when history is made.”
“Oh, so you do understand the concept of asking and answering,” Tony says. “Good job, Cap. Nice to know you just purposefully avoid that.”
The only chance to unravel reality is if Steve has a different set of memories.
Tony is scared and indignant and so unbelievably hurt that this is the most attention his father’s shown him, his entire life, and it’s because of some stupid soulmate shit he has no control over. Why is he being blamed for this? Howard is the one who failed to find Steve, and Tony… well. He’ll never be able to find out what it’s really like to have a soulmate.
Is Tony not reason enough (was he ever)? “You want to," Tony says.
“People tell me I’m impossible all the time, yet I exist,” Tony says dryly.
(—and he almost always gets what he wants.)
“I was supposed to nullify the magic around it,” Steve says, lips curving down. “I didn’t.”
. Tony moans around his cock.
“They don’t agree with you,” Tony says, a person with the luxury of choice who chose to be driven by the need of others. What does Tony need?
He doesn’t expect Tony to hone in on his words so doggedly. He should have. “What?” Tony looks at him. “What happened? Where’d your usual positive attitude go. Was it stolen by an emotion-selling pixie?” His lips quirk up, but the smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Because if so, I am so hiring whoever managed that.”
“She’ll underestimate you,” Tony says. “That’ll be useful.”
“I—uh. Yeah. I noticed.”
“They say you’re the best there is at runes,” Steve says. Unlike Tony Stark, Steve can swallow his anger and pride for the sake of others.
“That’s...” Tony pauses, rubbing his face. “Nice of you,” he finally decides on. Steve’s mistaken if he thinks Tony Stark is definable. “Thanks. But no.”
“A different environment should help you,” Tony says. “Of all things,” he mutters to himself.
“Glad to hear spoons haven’t changed in their use,” Steve says.
“You’ve been here before though, right?” Tony asks. “You were here when the library went up in flames. What’s that like?”
Steve takes a deep breath. “I’m—I’m sorry.”
Steve doesn’t answer immediately, which is answer enough. He grits his teeth. He seems to regret letting Tony do it. Good. “It wasn’t that.”
Tony mutters something that sounds suspiciously like
Tony stares at Steve bleakly. “Well, if wasn’t like you could consent. Who knew what else I might’ve done?”
And the world watches, enraptured, because no one has quite flown so high. They all wait for him to fall, of course. Many actively try to shoot him down because they can’t bear someone markless like Tony Stark carving the path to the future. Everybody expects him to fail, telling him he’s worthless, unstable, just lucky to inherit a fortune from his oh-so-generous (ha) father. They tell him he’s undeserving of everything
He’ll have to find Steve. Maybe in the morning when Steve wakes up, Tony will be able to fix things.
They might have never met. That would’ve been so easy. Steve imagines that, imagines waking up after Tony’s life. Imagines wandering. It’s easy to imagine that, and it makes Steve’s heart break to know that Tony’s going to have to wake up after Steve’s death. Wonders if Tony would hear the call of Steve’s soul.
A laugh echoes through the world, shaking it. Steve, he’s Steve. He doesn’t want to hear that laugh, it doesn’t mask the hurt in that voice. It sounds like it’s supposed to fix what’s broken but it can’t.
“I get it. I know.” Tony sighs and nods, half to himself. “But you could have told me,” he says. “What you were going to do. That was an option. I mean, did that not seem like an option to you?” Uncertainty bleeds into his voice, makes it quieter. “Telling me things?”
And they still summoned him.
Steve looks at Tony like they have known each other for far longer than just three months, and he’s rattled by some of the things Tony says about himself sometimes. Things that aren’t even lies, and Steve looks like he doesn’t think they’re true. It pisses Tony off, because it’s impossible. Tony has been Hydra his entire life. All of the memories that he’s stolen corroborate that fact.
“Thank you, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says pleasantly.
. There’s a vindictive, petty pleasure that comes from how all his life, he’s heard stories about Captain America, seen the way Howard’s eyes shine with sorrow.
What does Tony mean to do? He has the luxury of choice. “What are you crafting?” Steve asks.
“I believe you,” Steve says quickly, honestly. He doesn’t like this place. Steve runs his fingers along the walls as they move forward. His touch and path sends ripples, revealing enough until they’ve crossed the room, the entire space clearing up.
“It doesn’t matter how hard I tried,” Tony says. Steve is trying so hard. It’s not like he wasn’t there to see Tony execute his darker ideas. “It wasn’t enough. Or it was too much.” He mentally reminds himself to send Steve new override codes.
In this world, it’s so much easier to have a target, so much easier to see an end to this.
Forgetting about his quest to find Bucky, Steve changes course and starts searching for a bathroom. He giggles to himself as he drags his fingers along the wall, little bumps and ridges from the exposed brick tickling his finger tips. Then he’s touching smooth, darker wood and finally his fingers wrap around a  metal doorknob that he triumphantly pushes open. The bathroom light feels blinding compared to the rest of of the darkened apartment and he blinks rapidly, adjusting to the light. He finds himself in a bathroom with red and white tiles, the counters a black marble and it’s then he realizes that someone’s already standing in the bathroom.
“It could be fun?” He had suggested and that’s how they ended up on a train up to midtown, Bucky mumbling under his breath about how Steve and Natasha had been conspiring against him from the beginning.
“I think I’m going to stay-”
Tony smirks at him. “Nat’s friend. She told me about you when I called to invite her to my little house-warming shindig.”
Bucky doesn’t look too happy about that, but he trust Nat’s word above all else when it comes to being the judge of someone’s character so when she gives a jerky little nod he finally agrees and Steve feels his lips stretch into a smile. They both walk Nat and Bucky to the door and Steve tries really hard not to imagine this happening a thousand times over for couples game nights.
He starts and Bucky interrupts to protest, they’ve never made a habit of not leaving stuff like this together. It’s safer that way, but Bucky has Nat and Steve wants to be here. Tony leans against the counter next to him, close enough that their hips touch, looking between the two of them.
His eyes are so dark and Steve can’t tear his gaze away from it. He just met him, but even so he leans in a little bit in hopes that Tony will kiss him.
“Can I kiss you now?” Tony asks him and Steve surges up and presses their lips together instead of giving him a verbal answer.
Steve watches his ass as Tony heads to the bathroom and reaches down to run his fingers over the hard line of his cock, just for a little something to tide him over until he can get Tony’s hands on him. He can hear him running the sink water and brushing his teeth. When he comes back out he’s pretty sure he brushed his hair too. Tony climbs back into bed with Steve, tugging the covers down so he can really look at him. Steve arches a little when he drags his fingers along his rib cage and down to grab at his hips tightly again. He hops it leaves a mark.
Steve’s cheeks heat again and he doesn’t trust Nat to not have spilled all of the questions he had asked. He doesn’t trust her to not have told Tony about all the poking he had done to get a little bit of insider info. She had dropped the bomb on him about a week into dating Bucky. Though he can’t say she really dropped anything. She had mentioned her friend was up in Boston hosting an art gala because he had funded the entire thing and Steve had stupidly asked her how she knew Tony Stark. He had given it away then because she hadn’t even said her friends name.
Steve shoves his face against his knuckles, pushing his hips back and he has about ten seconds to prepare before his cheeks are spread and there’s a tongue dragging along his hole. Steve cries out, hips bucking and Tony pins them, he tries to rock into it but he can’t move. Tony pulls back to tease the tip of his tongue along his rim, not pushing in, just toying with him and Steve feels as if he’s about to slide off the planet and into the astral plane with how good it feels. He’s wet and messy and Tony is letting out these desperate little gasps against him like he’s the one getting off on it, and then he works his tongue into him, thrusting it gently and Steve thrashes against the bed. He needs more, he can vaguely hear embarrassing, needy little cries coming from him, but he can’t seem to stop them, and when he bites his lip to stifle them Tony very gently slaps the back of his thigh, trying to encourage him. After that he doesn’t hold back, vocalizing his pleasure here where he doesn’t have to hold back. He feels wet and open and tony pulls his mouth back, panting and running his fingers along his wet rim, wiping saliva from his chin.
“He can spend the night here, I’ll send him home in a car tomorrow” He promises.
“Even if I don’t, it’s polite to introduce yourself” Steve says finally and he mentally gives himself a pat on the back for playing that so cool.
“I’m assuming you don’t need an introduction from me.”
“How do you feel?” Tony asks carefully and Steve presses a kiss to the stubble on Tony’s neck.
Suddenly the ground feels like it’s going to give out on him, his heart rabbeting in his chest. He might never get the chance to hang around Tony like this again. He swallows, glancing at Tony and then back at Bucky. He really doesn’t want to go. When is he going to get a chance like this again?
Tony’s gaze shifts to one of surprised and then he laughs head falling back and his throat working attractively. “I’m going to get you another drink, I’ll wait for you outside” He says.
When he wakes up the fireplace is turned off and though there’s still space between them Tony has an arm thrown around his waist fingertips tickling his side. Steve’s careful as he slips out from under him and into the bathroom. He reaches up and tries to tame his hair, it’s a mess from sleeping on it, one side completely flat and the other wild and sticking up everywhere so he uses his hand and rearranges it into something more attractive. Then he finds Tony’s toothpaste squeezing it out onto his index finger and scrubbing his teeth with it, erasing the taste of sleep and alcohol away. Tony’s still asleep when he comes back out so he gets back under the sheets and comforter and scoots close to him, running his hands over his torso stopping to gently squeeze the softness around his belly. When that doesn’t wake him he brings his hand up to scratch lightly over his chest. Finally Tony’s eyes flutter open and he turns his head to look at Steve with a lazy, sleepy smile.
Standing up he follows Tony into his room. He’s got a king sized beds with so many pillows that Steve can’t wait to get lost them and there’s a fireplace by the bed that Tony actually turns on. Steve pulls his shirt off, tossing it aside, followed by his pants and gets into the bed, burying himself under the covers. It’s the warmest, most comfortable bed he’s ever slept in and he decides he’s going to have to be dragged out kicking and screaming in the morning. When Tony starts to change though he sits up, watching him. His shirt drops to the floor and he’s got toned arms, ones that are clearly worked with every day and his nipples are brown and hard, little soft black hairs bordering them and he feels hypnotized. Then his gaze falls to the dark curls down his navel, happy trail disappearing down into the silk red boxers as Tony shoves his pants down and off. Steve laughs again, earning an eye roll and a little laugh out of Tony. When his gaze falls to his ass however, Steve’s brain basically short circuits. It’s plump and round, the soft curve of it giving way to soft thighs. Then Tony bends to grabs his clothes off of the floor and the silk stretches tight over his ass and Steve’s very suddenly half hard, his mouth watering. It takes a full two minutes of repeating to himself that the bed is just for sleeping before he can even get his breathing back to normal.
“It’s just a little cliche don’t you think?” Steve can’t help but ask. His cheeks go pink, he can feel them heating up, but it’s not like he’s lying.
“So you gonna tell me your name or what?” Tony asks him, gesturing for Steve to follow him.
Tony wraps his arms around him and Steve rests his cheek against his chest, listening to his heart beating under his cheek. Tony’s warm and soft and he wants to spend the rest of his day like this. He wants to spend the rest of the year and possibly the rest of his life exactly like this with Tony’s facial hair tickling his forehead.
Nat was dead to him. Steve was deleting her on social media, blocking her phone number and then changing his name and moving out of state. And then he would send her a letter, detailing how she was going to have to win back his affections by finally giving him her secret chocolate chip cookie recipe she had thus far refused to give up.
“Oh” Steve says stupidly his mouth falling open.
The offer surprises Steve and sits heavily in his chest. Tony doesn’t even know him, yet he hadn’t hesitated to share his resources. He had followed his public persona for so long that it feels monumental in the moment to see yet another side Tony that doesn’t exist in his public or in his claim to fame as a young genius. It feels special and like maybe he’s seeing a side of Tony that not everyone gets to see.
He falls asleep between one breath and the next, trying to keep his eyes open and on Tony’s face until he can’t anymore, giving in to the need to sleep. The last thing he remembers is Tony pressing a gentle, wet kiss to his fingertips.
Tony smiles so brightly his eyes crinkle and Steve feels his stomach lurch in the same way it had on the balcony yesterday.
Steve groans flopping onto his back dramatically. Tony rolls on top of him, hips pinning him to the bed. “I’m just kidding, let me freshen up.”
The thing about Tony Stark was that Steve found him unbearably arrogant at times. He was obviously proud of his wealth, he was known for throwing lavish parties across a variety of cities and buying expensive cars he didn’t need. Tony was always being photographed with beautiful men and women on his arm, showing them of, wearing them like a trophy and letting them into his life just for the night before appearing with another pretty face the next day. That alone should have turned Steve off of him. However, Steve would never forget being 12 years old though and seeing a 15 year old being photographed with the Dean of MIT with a suit that looked two sizes to big for him, like it belonged to his father and he had insisted on wearing it. His hair had been tousled, his eyes big and brown and Steve had sat on the floor of his room with that picture for hours, reading over and over again the pages that showcased his inventions and projects. He was talented and Steve knew without having ever spoken a word to him that Tony Stark was special. There had to be with someone that was that creative and who was so idealistic in his vision of the future. Not only that, but even recently Stark Industry had invested in Green Energy projects and advancing technology for mental health services and trauma. He was an enigma and Steve had been harboring a secret crush on him since he was a child.
“- so she told me that you were in school, but not what you were majoring in.”
“I’m Steve Rogers.” he says finally. “It’s nice to meet you.”
Before the statement even leaves his mouth he knows it’s the wrong thing to say. Tony’s gaze shutters shut and he feels it sharp in his chest. He vows to make it up to him and get that quiet and soft expression back. The one that he’s never seen in photos before. His hand stays steady on Steve’s wrist, guiding him into the kitchen and pressing Steve’s back against the counter. Tony fills a cup with ice and water and holds it out to him. He takes it, as soon as the water hits his lips he realizes how thirsty he is and downs it, passing it back and silently asking for more. He drinks three cups before he’s finished, and as some spills down his chin, Bucky and Nat slip into the kitchen. Bucky snorts at the sight of it landing on his shirt and Steve flips him off as he wipes his chin with his other hand.
“Oh fuck me…” Tony breaths as Steve lets himself into the room. He looks like a dream. Like a literal dream Tony doesn’t ever want to wake up from. The glasses. The lab coat.
Friday!” says Steve, nearly choking in his own panic in a rush to prevent them from having to hear Friday say the words “oral stimulation.”
“Yes Tony” God he already feels so close, what is Tony doing to him?
Tony emphasizes each sentence with a firm stroke. Ah there it is.
Steve blushes again, his skin is a vision of various shades of pink and cream.
Steve tries to smile, still tense. He doesn't know what he needs to hear, but he can't help but feel things aren't resolved.
The pleasure from the silken pressure against his cock combined with the feeling of Tony heavy in his mouth and throat again sweeps away everything else. Why was he upset? His body acts of its own accord, gyrating in a fluid pattern, bending forward to take Tony into his mouth, then moving his mouth off and rolling his body down to press his groin roughly against Tony’s leg, then pulling his lower body away again to take Tony down to the root, again and again. Steve is reminded of an exotic belly dancer he saw once in a blue film Bucky dragged him along to. Fuck he’s about to come.
