At that moment, Cas’ index finger slid lightly over his prostate, and Dean bucked upwards. “Please, oh Jesus, Cas. Please!”
“Dean, I had one more gift for you. I wasn’t certain, but then your gift of the beekeeping class in April…”
“Pretty sure the guy who had his tongue down your throat a few weeks ago isn’t going to sue you for harassment, Cassie,” Gabriel said dryly.
Next up was the clearly handmade soap. Dean held the yellow bar to his nose and sniffed. He might not do bath products, but he did like to cook. This bar smelled like ginger and citrus, and… honey, again? Cas must really have a thing for bees.
“That doesn’t sound like sexual assault to me. That sounds like a platonic cuddle buddy who doesn’t want to be so platonic.”

Dean gazed up at him, eyes dark and lips slick. “I may be cheap, but I’m not easy, Cas. You gotta work for it.” He winked.
“I’m just not in town,” Charlie answered evasively. “I’m really sorry, I’d totally let you borrow my shower. What about a neighbour?” She asked helpfully.
Dean let the words wash over him, attention almost wholly focused on Cas’ hands stroking his throat, his jaw, sweeping lightly across his cheeks. His lips parted on a breath. Cas’ thumb glided gently over his bottom lip. Dean shuddered and shot upright, catching Cas’ hand in his own.
Sam’s words filtered slowly through the moonshine spreading fuzzy haze in his brain. He grunted noncommittally.
“No! That’s what you’re for. Can’t you hack the Farm Fresh database or something?” Dean sighed with frustration.
“It’s good. Bobby let me go a little early today. I’ll make up for it on the weekend,” Dean answered. Why were they suddenly playing an awkward game of twenty questions?
“Dean, when we agreed you would handle dinner, I assumed we would be having pizza or burgers, not a full three-course meal,” Cas grabbed one of the bags out of Dean’s hands before it slipped through his fingers.
Dean crossed his arms and smirked. “Kinda like closing the barn door when the horse is already out, there, Cas.”
Dean felt a smile pulling at the side of his face. “Well, the ingredients got better and fresher, but Bobby can burn water. So I did most of the cooking for the three of us. Now I usually make him something quick before I leave the shop, or I bring him in some leftovers. Otherwise he tends to drink whiskey all night and forgets to eat.”
Cas touched Dean’s hand lightly, a small bit of comfort, and drew back. They sat in silence as dusk fell over the park. Most families had gone home, and only the occasional jogger or dog walker crunched down the gravel path.
Squinting, he tried to get a better look, but the nearest streetlight was two houses over, and he couldn’t see into the car.
“Gross, get out of here!” Dean laughed, shoving Cas back onto the couch and wiping the wet spot with his t-shirt.
If you're not interested in the explicit next step, the story does end satisfactorily with Chapter 10.
Cas kissed him slowly and deeply, his tongue sliding cleverly in and out of Dean’s mouth, mimicking the mini thrusts of his hips. It didn’t take long for Dean to forget whatever had been funny in the first place. Cas leaned back and cocked a brow. “May I continue now?”
Dean’s mask clearly hid a grin, but he spread his arms wide. “It’s your party. Bring it on in, man.”
Picking up his phone, he checked his call log and sighed in disgust. He’d been on the phone with Gabriel for over an hour. He vaguely remembered lying on the floor in the living room, remembered Gabriel’s soothing voice reciting multiplication tables. He wondered briefly how many he’d had to recite this time.
“Well you only call me like every two weeks, man. How else am I supposed to know what’s going on with you?”
“Nothin’,” Dean whispered. He shifted slightly, turning more on his side, propping one hand beneath his head to act as a pillow against Cas’ chest. Cas dropped one hand to wrap securely around his bent elbow, while the other landed on his shoulder. For a little while, Cas was still again. Dean relaxed by degrees.
They moved together through the doorway to the small dining set and Dean pulled out his notebook and his Accounting 101 textbook.
Dean leaned over and kissed him, using his thumb to smooth away the worry between his eyebrows. “These are awesome, Sweetheart. I love them. We’ll have to add all the Star Wars movies to our list.”
“Listen, Alfie, I didn’t order anything. And I’m not paying you. There must be a mistake. Your boss is going to be pissed that you delivered to the wrong place.”
Oh God. Wrapped in the struggle to breathe, Cas had forgotten what set him off. He’d forgotten that Dean left. He let out a whimper, eyes squeezed shut.
“Look,” Charlie sighed. “You’re right, there are some potential elements of dubious consent, here. But Dean, he did kiss
Cas carefully placed his foil-wrapped bread into the oven and then cleared the table of his own books. They hadn’t used the table to eat before. Dean hid a frown, surprised to realize he was disappointed that he and Cas weren’t going to sit together on the couch to eat.
Cas sighed. “Were you planning to sit here all night? The temperature is dropping and I’d rather you didn’t develop a case of hypothermia.”
A heavy breath was quickly muffled, and Cas smiled briefly, moving to do as Dean asked. “If you have some garlic powder, that would be good, too. But just buttered is also fine. We can wrap it in foil and put it in the oven to warm up when we’re making the salad.”
He lost track of the movie, focused entirely on the sensations skimming through his nerves, leaving a hot mess in their wake.
“Cas, buddy, it’s fine. I fell asleep a bit, too. And I could’ve woken you up. I guess maybe touch therapy worked both ways today, huh?” Dean bent down, trying to catch Cas’ eyes with his own.
Through his tablet, he caught sight of Charlie’s raised eyebrow. “Beer? Dude, it’s not even noon yet.”
I'm still free-falling without a beta, so let me know if you seen any errors. Constructive criticism is always welcome. Mostly I'm just throwing words on the page to get back into the habit of writing, so share your thoughts with me about this whole concept of cuddle buddies. Do you think two attractive college students can keep it platonic? Yeah, who am I kidding? .... Ok, who's going to make the first move?
He drizzled the sauce generously over the bowls of carrot pudding and carried them into the living room. “Should we do presents now?” He asked hopefully.
Heat licked up Dean’s face and blossomed across his neck. “Uh, hey – hey, Cas. Just a little while.” Nonplussed, he rubbed his hands over his thighs. In all the ways he’d thought this through in his head, none of them involved Cas stomping out of his house and getting into Dean’s car.
Giving up, Cas leaned back on his palms, burying his fingers in the sand and stretching his legs out before him. “Explain it to me again.”
Bobby stayed in his office chair, and nodded him towards the petite dark-haired woman standing in front of the desk.
Cas grasped Dean’s hot length in his hand, spreading the precome up and down the shaft to ease the way. Dean’s breath came in gasps as he twisted beneath Cas, trying to push down onto his pistoning cock and up into his hand at the same time. He whimpered with pleasure, hazy eyes finding Cas’ and staying there.
“Here, then. You can choose something to watch.” He tossed the remote towards his feet. “Would you like a cup of tea? I’m having green tea with honey. It’s said that it helps to enhance and prolong the high. Although you’re not high, you may find a mug enjoyable, regardless. Green tea is calming and good for your stomach.”
Dean smirked and pulled a paper sack from his reusable grocery bag. “Two bite brownies,” he said smugly.
Dean laughed. “Yeah, buddy. Cuddles for tutoring, that’s what we agreed. Let’s just consider this one a freebie. I’ll see you around, Cas.” He saluted with two fingers, and closed the door quietly behind himself.
He pushed through the doorway as Cas stepped back, and started toeing off his boots. “Do you mind if I wash my hands real quick? I stopped to get some beer to go with the pizza. I really don’t like the sticky hand sanitizer that the beer store uses. It’s gross.” Without waiting for an answer, Dean moved down the hall to the little bathroom. Through the open door, Cas heard the water turn on, and humming. Was that
Dean shifted his backpack in his grip and knocked. He waited a moment, but no one answered. Suppressing a sigh, he tried again, this time using that annoying metal lever, wincing at the sharp
Blue met green, and Cas took in another deep breath through damp cotton. “I’m sorry, my Anxiety is acting up more lately, with the lockdowns.”
Cas blinked. “No, I did not. Then again, I don’t think I’ve ever questioned bacon bit composition, before.”
Cas wanted to offer comfort, but wasn’t sure how. He settled for a soft hum of understanding. “Sam is the younger sibling, right? So you were ten years old, and responsible for a child even younger?”
Charlie threw her hands up in the air and met his eyes. “Okay, okay! I know! I gave him your address for the grocery delivery!”
The timer beeped impatiently, startling Cas into movement. He’d forgotten the chicken. Again. Spotting the box of rice on the counter, he silently thanked Sober Cas for setting it out earlier. Pulling the casserole out of the oven before he forgot it again, he combined the water and five-minute rice. He set another timer for the rice and pulled out a fork for the “fluffing”.
Dean stood silent for a moment, staring at Cas as he straightened his shirt, his shorts, anything to avoid looking at Dean.
Dean hummed, his hands moving to knead along Cas’ spine. “Don’t you have someone local that you’re close to? Family? A girlfriend? A boyfriend?”
Cas slung a mask on his face and swung the door open. “Hi, I’m –“ His brain stuttered to a stop. The man on his porch was extremely well-built with light brown hair and crinkles around his striking green eyes. Undoubtedly his grey-and-black mask covered a smile. Dammit. Charlie hadn’t said anything about his looks.
gracefully. He constantly drew the eye, whether he was walking across the camp or performing onstage. People were simply pulled into his orbit, whether he was actively performing or not. He was like sunlight unleashed after a week of rain. Cas had
Greasy sweat coated his forehead, his armpits hot and damp. He struggled for a deep breath. Everything would be better if he could just get a damn deep breath into his lungs. Mouth open like a fish, he tried, pulled his t-shirt over his head, hating the neckline tugging at his throat.
Charlie poked at the webcam with the end of her pencil. “You. Can’t. Give. Up. Whenever. You. Get. Frustrated.” Each word was accompanied by a poke.
“Be quiet, Dean, or I’ll consider gagging you,” Cas said conversationally. An involuntary twitch ran through him, but Dean quieted.
” sound rumbling from his chest. He pressed into Dean’s warmth, burrowing against his flannel-clad shoulder. “It's Tuesday. So generally, yeah.”
“In Accrual Basis accounting, you would create a journal entry – don’t worry about this yet – to move the deposit from October to November, and you’d create a second journal entry to move the new steering wheel expense from December to November. So in one financial period, a month, you’re recognizing all the costs and all the revenue at once. It’s cleaner, and gives you more visibility to your expenses and revenue.”
A car was pulled up in front of his house. A long, black car. Dean’s car. Unless there were two sleek, midnight Impalas in town? Anything was possible?
“Wait –“ Dean tried, but it was like Alfie disappeared into thin air. Even the sound of his footsteps pounding down the concrete stairs was gone.
He could hear muttering coming from the kitchen as Cas continued his solo conversation. Dean glanced around in confusion. “Cas?”
Dean’s voice rose in irritation. “Who doesn’t eat at least one freakin’ two-bite brownie, man? He told me to take my leftovers and feed ‘em to Bobby. I guess they weren’t good enough for him,” he said bitterly.
Dean’s face flooded with colour. “Fine. Go ahead.” Meg nodded and walked back around front, pulling her detailing van into the back parking lot. Dean pulled Baby out of her spot and parked her in the shade near the hose in Bobby’s backyard. He watched as Meg opened the side of her van. Reluctantly impressed, he took a closer look at the rows of wet and dry chamois, the number of soaps, stacks of paper towels, and the industrial-sized vacuum that Meg carried with her.
“In my personal experience, Dean, marijuana does act as a social lubricant, somewhat in the same way that alcohol does. However, I’ve successfully written entire term papers on complex financial calculations while high, so I feel confident in assuring you that I’m entirely myself, whether under the influence or not.”
Ash was right. Dean hadn’t thought far enough ahead. In his haste to get Rumsfeld somewhat cleaner before Bobby found him and tried to wash the dog himself, he hadn’t sought out a leash. Meaning he’d had to hold the collar of the wet dog as he shook, in order to prevent him from rolling in the dirt as soon as he’d been rinsed.  No amount of cussing stopped a wet dog from shaking.
Alfie leaned forward slightly to look at Dean’s licence, keeping his hand in the door the whole time.
Sweeping around, Cas’ hand landed on his discarded shirt and he used it to wipe the smear of snot and sweat and tears away.
Dean ducked his head, and looked up at Cas through his lashes, his eyes twinkling. “You wanna do it standing up?”
Cas moaned unintelligibly, both hands gripping Dean’s ass, dragging Dean down as he slammed up. Pleasure barreled through his system, short-circuiting his ability to access higher brain functions, like speech.
The knock surprised him, when it came. Pushing his notebook aside, he grabbed a mask from the small shelf near the door before opening it to find Dean on the other side.
“Should we get to your homework? What do you need to work on?” He turned towards his dining room table, where he had his own textbooks spread out.
Sam recovers quickly. “I’m sure that’s not it. I’m positive that’s not it. Didn’t you say this guy is really specific about his social circle? Someone like that isn’t going to turn around and get a new cuddle buddy, Dean.”
“Holy fuck,” Dean gasped. Precome spurted, hot and wet, into his boxers. He grabbed for Cas’ hair, pulling his lips back into a messy kiss. A moment later, Cas pulled away again.
The multiplication tables cut out. “There you are. The worst is over, Cassie. Could you try wiping your face?”
“You feel exceptional,” Cas breathed, dropping his forehead to Dean’s shoulder. “I would like to stay inside you all night.” He snapped his hips, changing the pace and pushing Dean up the bed. Dean moaned, reaching over his head to grasp the headboard, and pushing down into Cas’ thrusts.
Dean shrugged his shoulders. “We had a video call yesterday. But I was trying to prep dinner for tonight, so we didn’t talk long.”
“I know, man, but me ‘n’ Bobby have it covered. I gotta go, though, okay? I need to get this wrapped up and in the fridge for tomorrow.”
“No, it’s not just my apartment, the water’s off in the whole building. So unless I want to rinse off using the water in my toilet tank, I’m out of luck.” Dean could practically hear Charlie thinking on the other side of the line. “It’s ok, Char. I’ll just go back to Bobby’s. You’re closer, that’s all.”
. “I’d prefer to cuddle first, if you don’t have a preference,” he said. Dean quirked his eyebrow as Cas used air quotes around “cuddle”.
“What do you mean you’re not in town?” Dean held the phone with one hand while he stuffed a change of clothes into his backpack. “There’s nowhere else to be, thanks to Covid.”
Dean sat up and played with the hem of Cas’s shorts, brow furrowed. “I think it could work. Especially if I recorded some guitar to play in the background. If you read it slowly and added some pauses for the guitar, I can put together movements to go along with the words. We can use the guitar to tie it all together and stretch it out a bit."
“Wait, I have a picture!” The tablet tipped dangerously and Dean saw the ceiling, the coffee table, and a blurry view of the carpet while Charlie swore in the background. “Hang on, I’ll rescue you!”
“I think at the time, I thought that if I understood enough about accounting, I could have stopped my uncles and saved my father’s legacy. That’s ridiculous, of course. Even a prodigal ten year old – which I wasn’t – couldn’t have saved the business from two men bent on destroying it. But the older I got, the more I realized I have a good head for numbers. They just make sense to me. Arts and even Science are sometimes open to interpretation, but numbers are constant,” Cas explained.
“Uh, Cas…” He turned to look at his face. Colour sat high and dusky across Cas’ cheekbones. Hooded eyes gazed back at him.
“He wasn’t supposed to be here last night, Gabe. I had no plans with him. It was Tuesday,” Cas’ voice sped up. “He showed up unannounced to borrow my shower. On a Tuesday.”
Dean had to agree with that point, too. He hated to admit it, but Meg had done a great job, and he’d felt justified in leaving her a good review. Without having to take care of Baby, he’d had time to make himself a kick-ass Saturday night dinner,
Feeling brave and daring thanks to his gummy friends, Cas flipped on the porch light and wandered back into the kitchen. The rice was ready, the chicken was warm, and it did look much better now than it had pre-oven. Getting a plate out of the cupboard, he stopped and did an about-face.
“So young Cas decided he wanted to be an auditor?” Dean’s tone was teasing, but his attention was fully focused on him as they turned a corner of the gravel path, past the empty baseball diamonds.
Huffing a laugh, Cas rested his head more comfortably on Dean’s shoulder. Even through the mask, he could smell Dean’s cologne, and he was positive it would permeate his own clothing. Dean’s presence would linger long after the man himself had left.
Cas sighed. “Yes. I have the best costume I could find from the storage room, I have the monologue memorized, and Garth said he’d manage the guitar track for us. Are you ready?” Of course Dean was ready. Watching him put together his movements to Satan’s speech in
Cas came willingly, sliding across the floor in his bee slippers. Dean grabbed him just before he crushed his face into his shoulder and stared past the black-framed glasses, focusing on Cas’ blue eyes. Those bloodshot, glazed blue eyes.
“Not yet, but here, I can read it.” He pulled his phone out of his pocked and opened the search bar. Dean tossed away the piece of glass he’d been playing with and spun around to drop his head into Cas’s lap. His forearm shielded his eyes from the bright sun while he waited for Cas to find the poem and start reading.
Taking a deep inhale, Cas breathes out slowly just as his meditation playlist ends. He unfolds himself from the floor and rolls up his yoga mat, tucking it away behind the television. A knock on the door speeds his pulse, and a smile twitches involuntarily across his face. Dean has shown up. If he can just make it through the next few minutes, hopefully they can get back on track and retain their friendship.
A moment later, Charlie picked up the tablet and Dean saw the carpet, the coffee table, and the ceiling in reverse order. Then Charlie’s face, and a close-up of her hand as she shoved her phone at him.
“Cas. Is there… are you okay? Is it your Anxiety? Do you need a hug?” Dean stood back and opened his arms with a reassuring smile, hoping that a little physical contact might ease the awkwardness between them.
It could’ve been minutes or it could’ve been hours later when Cas jerked awake, head still pillowed on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean huffed a laugh. “I get it. Nothing stressful. Right.” One of his hands rubbed soothing circles into Cas’ back. If possible, Cas tensed even further. Dean sighed. “Why don’t you tell me why we’re huggin’?”  The soothing circles continued.
“Castiel!” Gabriel’s voice rose to a clarion call, cutting through the noise in Cas’ head. “Did he say no? Did he push you away? Did he punch you? Did he accuse you of assaulting him?”
Dean’s face fell a little but he rallied with a smile. “If you want to wait, that’s cool.” He sat back on the couch and fiddled with his spoon.
Dextrous fingers teased up his sides, dancing their way to his nipples. They pebbled tightly, little buds that Cas plucked gently. Dean groaned, pushing into Cas’ ministrations.
“I know. But I can at least rinse him off so he smells a bit better. Otherwise we’ll all have to listen to Bobby bitch tomorrow.” Dean uncoiled the hose with one hand, keeping the other firmly latched on Rumsfeld’s collar.
Dean cringed. “The other night, I went over there to shower, like you’d suggested, right? And, well, it got…it was awkward. And I’m not sure it was consensual.”
“I don’t think there will be a ‘next time’, Gabriel,” Cas said quietly. “Dean left. I don’t think he intends to come back for any reason.”
Charlie’s eyes softened. “Dude, you’re seriously one of the nicest people I know. I really doubt that you took advantage of anyone.”
A brochure slipped out, along with a folded piece of paper. Cas set the paper aside and opened the brochure. It was marketing material for the local college. Dean made an aborted reach for the brochure, but Cas found the dog-eared page and flipped to it himself. It advertised a two-day Introduction to Beekeeping course.
With sudden clarity, Dean realized this was exactly what he’d wanted while he’d been sitting in Baby. Cas was right here, twisted around him, admitting that there were
“Dean, this is more lasagna that we can eat tonight. You’re taking the rest home, right?” Cas glanced at half-full dish sitting on the stove.
Cas’ tone was flat, musing, like he was still talking to himself. Dean stared hard. This rumpled man with the adorable furrow in his brow wasn’t the Cas he was used to.
“It’s just friggin’ weird, Charlie.” Dean took another bite of the eggplant parmesan he’d made himself and sighed with appreciation. Fresh parm made all the difference over that powdered stuff he normally bought. The eggplant was almost a week old now, but organic really made a difference.
“I’m not asking you to apologize, Cassie. I’m asking you to admit that you have feelings for this guy.”
“Christ, Cassie, I feel like I’m talking to myself.” Cas could hear the exasperated sigh that Gabriel didn’t even try to hide.
Scrambling across the seat, Dean managed to get his feet under him before Cas pulled him onto the sidewalk, but it was a near thing. Without waiting, Cas hauled him across the lawn to the porch.
Comprehension flooded Cas and his own cock jumped in response. “You enjoy the feeling of being dominated, of being taken,” he said. “Not the pain, but the act of being claimed.”
Feeling a little like a flannel-clad tornado had just walked through the door, Cas picked up the six pack Dean had rested on the floor and put it in the fridge. He assumed there would be studying before beer drinking. They’d have to take their masks off for drinking. He felt a heavy thump in his chest, and convinced himself it was an anxious reaction to the increased potential for germ spreading, not the idea of seeing Dean’s whole face.
Meg walked right up to the car and stroked over her roof. “Hello, sugar,” she crooned. She walked all the way around the car, bent to check the tail pipe, ran her fingertips over the chrome grille. “She a ’67?”
The scent of oregano and tomatoes had drifted through the small house while they worked. Dean’s stomach growled loudly, and Cas hid a surprised smile.
In spite of himself, Cas snorted out a laugh. “I hadn’t thought of it as avant garde. Hey, stop shredding my shorts!” He grabbed Dean’s hand in both of his to stop the other teen from picking at a loose hem. Dean flipped their hands easily until their fingers were threaded together, and stilled.
Surprised at her tone, Dean looked anywhere but at the screen. “You know I do. You’re like the little sister I never wanted.”
Gabriel was silent on the other end. Cas ran a thumb back and forth over the seam of his lounge pants, waiting quietly.
“It’s what?” Cas looked at the clock, and Dean was right, it was almost ten o’clock. He’d slept, snuggled on Dean’s chest, for three hours!
“Cool. I just read that grocery deliveries are really picking up right now because of the pandemic. It’s like 46% more people are using delivery services now than –“
“Why not? There’s nothing wrong with you, Cassie,” Gabe said, dropping his playful tone. “Everyone has baggage. Yours just comes in the form of a pill you have to take every day. I’m sure Dean-O’s not perfect, either.”
Cas propped a leg up on the couch and leaned into his warmth. “Fine. Rudolph first. We can watch your movie second.”
Cas wakes the next morning with snakes twisting in his gut. His heart hammers in his chest. Adrenaline thrums in his veins.
“We should get you home before it gets cold out, Cas.” With a forced smile, Dean stood and reached out his hand to help him up. Surprised, Cas placed his hand in Dean’s and suppressed a shiver at the feel of those calloused fingers sliding against his own.
Dean nodded. “That makes sense, especially these days. Everyone could use a hero, especially a hot one. Which Avenger turns your crank?”
Cas’s shoulders stayed ramrod straight and he did his best not to breathe damply on Dean’s neck, which was hard to do, with the way Dean had pressed his face into his shoulder.
Dean laughed and slung his arm over the back of the couch, so his hand rested lightly on Cas’ shoulder. “Most people watch them for the explosions, Cas, not the dialogue.”
“Have you heard of the love languages, Dean?” Cas asked, directly at his ear. Dean shivered, and shook his head slightly.
Sam didn’t need to know that sometimes Dean lay awake, remembering how Cas’ hair had felt in his fingers, or how awkwardly adorable their first cuddle session had been, when Cas insisted on standing there, trying to cuddle upright. He’d only seen the guy like five times. Nothing to get worked up about.
Dean breathed in Cas’ honey scent, slipping a hand around his neck and pulling Cas half onto his lap as he slid his tongue across his bottom lip, seeking entry. He sighed a little as Cas parted his lips, granting him access as the kiss deepened. He licked into Cas’ mouth, tilting his head slightly to the side to get closer, closer. The damn pom on the Santa hat smacked him in the eyes.
“Cassie, you dated Balthazar for two years and when he went to Scotland, you didn’t shed a single tear. Then this guy shows up, you cuddle a couple of times, and when he leaves, you become entirely non-verbal for over an hour,” his brother said flatly.
Hot breath fluttered over Dean’s cock as Cas hovered over it. Dean leaned up on one elbow to look. He twitched heavily, seeing Cas’ pink lips so close to his leaking head but not touching. Not yet. “Please, Cas… I want –“
“While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I need a verbal yes or no, Dean.” Blue eyes glared down at him, colour high across Cas’ cheekbones as he waited for an answer.
“Yeah. Of course it is. D’you know the fake bacon bits that they sell in a shaker container are really made from soybeans?”
Hey guys! If you’re following along, I’m glad you’re still here. And if you’re new, I wanted to say thank you for stopping by. This is a WIP but I have a definite ending planned, so I’ve updated the chapter count accordingly! It may move slightly by one chapter, but I know how it ends and I won’t leave you hanging!
particularly appetizing, but maybe after it cooked? Covering the dish with a lid, he slid it into the oven and turned the oven on while he chewed another gummy.
in his chest. Trembling fingers reached for the door handle as he tripped back into the house, desperate now to get the door closed and locked. He wanted to shut the world outside.
Dean’s mind quickly flicked through their mutual friends. The list wasn’t long, especially during the pandemic. One name popped into his head. Someone he’d cooked for more than once. Someone who knew he loved his car. Someone who expressed himself in unconventional ways.
Cas huffed a laugh and wiped his hands on a paper napkin. “All right, let’s imagine that someone comes in to the shop and wants you to change their steering wheel.”
“Here.” Dean passed him a corner of the blanket, unzipping his shorts to give himself the same treatment. Cas flushed, but wiped himself as clean as he was able.
The slow rise and fall of Cas’ chest behind him lulled him into a sense of peace in the quiet house. Cas wrapped around him like ivy, and while he wasn’t sure what he’d done to deserve it, he didn’t want to be anywhere else.
. It probably came from being a dancer, constantly touching other people. Cas’s body no longer felt like it belonged just to him, with Dean’s constant casual touches. As an only child with distant parents, it was an odd sensation, but one which he’d quickly come to crave. And he didn't like to think about
“Grocery delivery. Could I just see your ID to confirm your name?” The kid wore a loud red- and white-striped shirt, and a stupid red and white cap. The name of the local high-end grocery store was emblazoned across his brow.
“What did you bring?” Cas set the red and white bag down in front of his spindly little evergreen. Modestly-sized it might have been, but it was covered in a brilliant array of homemade decorations. Strings of popcorn and looped paper garlands wrapped around the branches, while handmade clay ornaments covered in glitter shone in the light. A carefully-crafted origami paper star held pride of place at the top of the tree.
Dean’s face flushed with embarrassment. Cas didn’t even want to tutor him anymore. Sure, this had been a good week for him, but obviously this was Cas’ way of getting Dean out of his life. Through the roar in his ears, he recognized that Cas had finished speaking.
Faced with an impatient Cas, already convinced this was a bad idea, Dean lost his nerve. “I can just go. You’re busy. I’ll just go.” He reached for the key, but quick as a rabbit, Cas reached out to stop him. His heart knocked about in his chest as Cas’ warm fingers curled around his.
Cas pulled the door open wider, but Dean stood on the threshold and fingered the strap of his messenger bag.
Dean and Cas both froze, post-orgasmic bliss ripped away. Chuck Shurley’s voice sounded again. “I’m just out here taking a walk, you know, uh, doing my regular trip around the grounds, making sure all the campers are in their cabins, where they’re supposed to be, at this time of night. If someone wasn’t, uh, you know, where they were supposed to be, they’d have, um, about fifteen minutes to disappear before I come back past this spot. Just, uh, letting you know.” Footsteps crunched away in the woods as the counsellor departed, and the crickets resumed their nightly serenade.
Chapter 4 did not exactly go as I'd intended. Cas kinda took over and did his own thing. And while that's cool, it did put me in the awkward position of determining whether someone who's high can consent to sexual activity of any kind, even if they instigate it. As noted previously, I'm single, and my own experience with edibles is relatively recent, so I can't speak from experience. I will say I've been in a position where I was not able to consent to a situation, but it was years ago, and it involved alcohol, which affects me in a totally different way.
Dean wiped his mouth with a napkin and took both plates into the kitchen before joining Cas on the couch. He sat close enough that they touched, shoulder to thigh.
“We’ve only been standing here for like fifteen minutes, Cas, and I’m going to take up way more than that with my Accounting questions. I’m fine. It’s fine.” Dean hauled him back in, tightening his arms and shifting his feet on the carpet.
Grin still lighting up his face, Dean turned to face him again. This time, Cas held tight to his courage, and turned his face, too. Blue eyes met green, and the grin slowly vanished from Dean’s face.
Dean grinned, reaching out his hand to run it teasingly down Cas’s barely-there stubble until his friend swatted his hand away, huffing in annoyance. Dean was
With a small smile, Cas held his gaze. He grabbed his dick and circled Dean’s hole before sliding slowly in, watching Dean’s face as it went slack with pleasure. He paused a moment, holding his weight on his forearms, bracketing Dean’s head. His cock throbbed heavily while he waited.
“Dean, could you come inside, so we aren’t having this conversation on the porch?” He backed up and headed to the little dining room table, leaving Dean to sort himself out by the door.
Cas pressed the phone firmly to his ear, mouth open, and drooling tears and saliva on the carpet as he slapped the table leg twice.
“Right. Sorry. I’m not sure what the proper social etiquette is in this situation,” Cas fumbled with the door latch. “I’ll just –“
Then Cas lifted his upper hand and started stroking Dean’s hair. Dean’s eyes squeezed shut, unsure how much more of this he could take. It was one thing to offer touch as comfort. It was another to have fingers moving over him so soothingly, so intimately. Like a lover. Cas tugged lightly at the freshly-washed strands as they slid silkily through his fingers. Dean
Cas broke away, pulling in a breath as his lips tracked across Dean’s cheek, mouthing at his cheekbone, turning his attention to Dean’s neck. He tilted his head to the side, giving that wicked mouth more room. Cas obliged, sucking a swollen mark against his collarbone.
“When you message me at six in the morning, little brother, I assume it’s something urgent that your morning routine didn’t eliminate,” Gabriel said breezily.
Dean snorted a laugh. “Here’s your hat, what’s your hurry?” He hadn’t moved from his prone position.
Dean’s mind whispered traitorously. “Sure, Cas, whatever you say.” Dean carried his own plate to the table and sat down, helpless to figure out where his appetite had suddenly gone. This night wasn’t turning out at all like he’d expected. He’d figured there might be some couch cuddling and an Avengers movie while they ate. But there wasn’t. Their relationship really was platonic, now, and Cas was obviously happy with that arrangement.
“Sure, Cas, I could do that. But I didn’t bring anything with me. Do you want to regroup and meet next week?” Dean looked a little sad.
“I usually read, or I study some more, or sometimes Charlie texts me and we play some World of Warcraft.” Cas blushed a little and looked down, hoping Dean couldn’t see the colour of his face behind his mask.
“Are those appropriate?” Cas asked worriedly. “I generally don’t understand your t-shirts but I do understand that they’re double entendres. Charlie assured me that these would be suitable additions to your collection.”
“Oh.” Cas selected the first Avengers movie, since it had both the Hulk and Captain America. He tried not to think too much about what it meant that Dean’s favourite Avenger was male. Lots of guys preferred the male characters.
He watched for a moment as Cas gripped the paper sleeve and started to mangle the bread with heavy strokes.
“Dean,” Sam tried. “Is it maybe possible that he was asking you questions to get to know you better? And he knows, uh, he knows you work a lot, right?” Sam cleared his throat. “Maybe he thought he was doing you a favour by telling you to take the leftovers, so you wouldn’t have to cook again?”
“That gift bag can go under the tree,” Dean directed while he toed off his boots. “The shopping bag can go in the kitchen.”
Dean laughed. “Yeah, man. Just like a teenage boy.” He leaned in and ran his hand through Cas’s hair, placing a kiss on his lips. He bundled the blanket under one arm, and reached out his other hand to Cas.
Knowing full well that the anxiety attack was coming didn’t make it easier. Cas’ heart clattered in his chest. He tried to take a deep breath but his ribs were too tight, ribcage too small. He couldn’t get a breath. He couldn’t
Cas used the last piece of warmed bread to sop up the remaining sauce on his plate before popping it in his mouth. “I don’t think I’m going to have room for dessert,” he said ruefully.
Charlie sensed his weakening. “His bubble is small! He’s tutoring over Zoom right now. And your bubble is small, just you and the guys at the garage, right? You and me haven’t even been in the same room in weeks!”
Grumbling to himself, Dean looked at the bags of groceries littering the apartment hallway. There was a slip of paper stapled to one, and when he bent to check, sure enough, it had his name and his address on it. Unsure what the hell else to do, Dean hauled the bags into his tiny kitchen and unloaded them one by one.
“Quality Time is the third,” Cas rumbled. Dean tilted his head to the side and Cas ran his fingers down his cheek, rubbing a thumb over his bottom lip. He was finding it hard to concentrate on Cas’ words while drawn into the feeling of those wandering hands seeking out his sensitive spaces.
Feeling sheepish, Cas closed the distance and hugged Dean back. It did make him feel better, but he stepped back a few moments later.
Cas sat down on the couch, flicking his foot at last night’s snotty t-shirt with disgust. “I’m sorry about last night,” he began.
“All right, I’ll see you next week.” Like they’d just met, Cas stuck out his hand for Dean to shake. Realizing how ridiculous that was, he just as quickly pulled it back.
Cas sighed and rolled his eyes. “Just because you showed me a few things doesn’t mean that the cheer team is going to accept me, Dean.”
Dean turned away, but not before Cas saw the grin he tried to hide behind the refrigerator door. “Could you turn the oven on to 400? I’ll throw the pizzas in, too.”
“Yeah. Sure. It’s great. First he decides he doesn’t need a freakin’ platonic cuddle buddy anymore. Then he decides he doesn’t need me in his life anymore.”
Cas thrust a hand between them and gripped the vee of his own legs. “I have a decent-sized erection here that would beg to differ with your opinion,” he stated.
Dean looked at him with large eyes. Cas sat up and placed a palm on Dean’s cheek, stroking lightly with his thumb. “You know I can’t cook. You know about my Anxiety. You know I have control issues and Dominant tendencies.”
“My father and my uncles owned a prosperous publishing house. For the sake of expediency, I won’t bore you with the details, but when I was still young, the business was mired in financial difficulty. Outside auditors were brought in to review the company’s accounts, but by then, the damage was done. Uncle Luke and Uncle Michael had been embezzling for years. They destroyed the business and left my father with a fallen empire. The company couldn’t even pay wages.”
While he waited for a reply, he took another expensive sip of wine. He was doing his best not to chug the glass, but this conversation required liquid courage.
. Lightly, gently, the pads of his fingers tracing endless patterns over Dean’s forearms. Dean swallowed, and tried not to react. Cas had a thing for touching, he already knew that. It’s why he was here, sandwiched between him and the couch. Just, usually, it was Dean doing the touching. He’d become good at convincing himself that platonic cuddling was a thing. That he was helping Cas. But this…. The fingers curling around his pulse points, dropping down to stoke the soft skin of his wrists… This was not comforting Dean at all.
“Cas. Cas!” Dean sweeps a hand up his muscular back and wraps his fingers in the overlong curls at Cas’ nape.  Forgetting what he was trying to say, he leans forward to trace Cas’ collarbone with his lips, pulling the Henley to the side so he can suck a maroon bruise into his skin. Cas groans, grinding down on Dean’s lap.
“Come here, Dean. I want to cuddle you,” Cas repeated. He waggled his fingers at Dean. “It’s my ninety minutes to do with as I please. And I choose to cuddle instead of be cuddled. The oxytocin works regardless of who holds who. So I’d appreciate it if you’d participate like you were paid to do, please.”
Three days later, Bobby opened the door between the office and garage and hollered Dean’s name. Chest-deep in an old pick up, Dean took a minute to wipe his hands on the blue bandana he kept in his right jeans pocket before sauntering up to find out what the old man wanted.
Dean didn’t let him finish the sentence. “No, it’s all right, Cas. I understand. Thanks for all your help. I’m sorry about –“ He paused, then gave up. “Sorry. I’ll see you around.” He walked out the door without a backward glance.
Brow furrowed, Cas stepped hesitantly around the couch to face Dean. “I thought we’d do it standing up?”
“No, of course not. But we agreed an hour for an hour, and it’s been an hour. I don’t want to take advantage of you like I did last time.”
Christ, Dean was having trouble keeping up with the conversation. And the mood swings. He spoke fast, before Cas interrupted him again. “I need to borrow your shower. There’s an emergency repair in my building and the water’s off for the night. Your house is on the way to Bobby’s, so I thought I’d stop and see if I could borrow yours before going all the way back out there.”
“Dean…. Dean came over last night,” Cas explained. “He brought an Italian feast with him. I tried… I tried asking him questions like you suggested.”
Dean shook his head. “That’s okay, Cas. You put me on the right track. And it’s getting kinda late. I have to go to Bobby’s early tomorrow.”
Sam scratched his collarbone and flipped a page in his textbook. “I guess you could always try calling the store to ask who paid for them.”
“What? No! Okay, maybe. But it doesn’t matter. Now that I’ve basically forced myself on the guy, he probably wants nothing to do with me.”
Cas’ eyes creased when he laughed, his nose wrinkling up. Dean stared for a moment before he remembered himself.
head was at, and go from there. Being manhandled into cuddling position was a good sign, he reasoned.
“Yes, I did. The smell was giving me a headache. I think the tree looks fine without them.” Cas flicked one of the clay ornaments, sending it dancing in the light.
Cas wrapped the leftovers and washed the dishes while Dean served up two bowls of Christmas pudding and heated the rum sauce.
Caught in the act of leaning toward the coffee table to pick up the television remote, Cas turned a surprised glance on Dean. “You made it?”
“Gabriel! Sexual assault isn’t funny!” Cas whipped back the covers and paced back and forth in front of the bed.
The freckled teen settled in the sand and got down to business. “It’s a pretty simple plan. You perform a monologue and I dance to it.”
He sighed, rubbing his eyes. “Maybe he has a new cuddle buddy.” The thought popped out of his mouth, unbidden. “Holy shit Sam. Maybe he has a new cuddle buddy.”
Dean chewed a few fries and thought for a moment. “How would that work for downpayments on restoration jobs? Right now if we have a big job, Bobby puts it in the bank and just marks it down on the invoice.”
Cas sighed and drooped bonelessly against him. “There’s a pandemic, Dean. It’s boring. And stressful. I can’t go anywhere. I can’t do anything. I’m in this house. All.the.time. But when I’m high, shit’s way less boring. Way less boring. Shit’s even funny.” Was that muffled snort a
A slight look of alarm crossed Cas’ face at Dean’s easy capitulation. “Fine!” Cas put down his half-empty pudding. “Here, open this while I finish.” Pulling a flat box out from under the tree, he thrust it into his boyfriend’s hands.
They let out mutual groans of satisfaction as Cas’ fingers breached Dean and sank slowly inside. Cas drizzled more lube on his fingers, scissoring Dean open as his faint gasps and sighs played on in the background.
Cas glanced down, knowing Dean was hoping he’d say something current, some action movie soliloquy or Paul Bettany’s short monologue from
“Why do you wear so many layers all the time?” He complained, drawing back to run his hands down Dean’s chest.
Dean strode over to the truck, grabbing the corner of his sleeping bag and bundling it under his arm. “Nevermind, this was stupid. We can go back.”
“You actually seem to like this stuff, Cas. Did you always want to be an accountant?” Dean’s hands were back in his pockets, but every few steps, his shoulder brushed against Cas’.
Trigger warning: skip from - "he wanted to shut the world outside." to "Fifteen minutes away, Dean sat in front of his TV". In summary, Cas has a terrible anxiety attack brought on by Dean's departure. He's not able to catch his breath and becomes nonverbal. He calls Gabriel who stays with him on the phone until the attack lessens, and Gabriel manages to get him tucked into bed and asleep.
“I…oh. Um, yes, well, I guess we’re done for this evening. Unless you wanted to stay and watch a movie?” Cas kept his back to Dean while he studiously wrapped foil around the leftover pasta.
Bobby’d called him an idjit when he’d stepped out of the house with a towel for each of them. Dean insisted on drying Rumsfeld himself, since the damage was already done. Bobby didn’t say thank you and Dean didn’t say you’re welcome, but they shared a beer in the weak October sunlight before he headed home for a shower.
“What if we sit down?” Cas asked hesitantly, fully aware that Dean had suggested that in the first place. His traitorous arms just weren’t ready to let go of the first person he’d touched in months.
Cas tugged on his short hair. “Less talking. More kissing.” He reached up and flicked his tongue over Dean’s, before dragging his teeth across that pouting lower lip. Dean reciprocated, his mouth dancing across Cas’s jaw to suck lightly on his earlobe. Cas inadvertently squeaked, his hips snapping up off the bed of the truck. Dean moaned in response, pelvis thrusting unconsciously against Cas’s hip. They both pulled back, panting breaths breaking the quiet night.
“I’m good. I just can’t believe that tomorrow’s it. Back to Kansas tomorrow night. You’re gonna text me though, right?” Dean actually sounded a bit anxious.
Cas ripped off his mask and chugged a glass of water in the kitchen. His hands shook slightly, anxiety pounding his chest. He put his mask back on and dropped his head, leaning against the counter and taking deep breaths.
“Yeah, man, I don’t wanna forget your face,” Dean grinned. “You gotta tell me whether you make it on to your cheer team and show me your moves.”
He lay quiet for a moment, but ignoring the elephant in his head wasn’t going to help it go away. He picked up his phone off the nightstand and tapped out a short message – “
The knock came at seven p.m. on a Monday night, when Dean was laying on the couch in plaid pajama pants re-reading his Accounting 101 notes. He rolled over and hit his feet, taking a peek through the keyhole. A skinny kid stood on the other side of the door, his arms loaded down with grocery bags. Another few bags are piled around his feet.
That last one had thrown him for a loop. Retreating to the couch, he switched over to Zoom and called Sam.
“Dude, are you seriously pissed that someone bought you food? Now you don’t have to shop this week and you aren’t out the money. I’d just say thank you.”
“Do you need help with the salad?” Cas asked, wandering the few steps back into the kitchen after setting the table with glasses of water and cutlery.
Dean nodded. “’Look after Sammy, boy. Watch out for him.’ That’s what he always said.” He paused, and Cas wasn’t sure if he would continue.
Cas looked at the ceiling and grinned, a strange sort of half-smile flitting across his face. “No, thank you, Dean. It probably is a bit of my Anxiety, it’s been a busy week. Are you done with the lettuce? Should we get started with your books?”
“I felt there was no way that this kind, sensitive, intelligent man could want me the way I wanted him. I felt I’d crossed a line when we kissed, a line that you didn’t want to cross.” Instinct drove Dean to turn his face towards Cas, tucking his nose under Cas’ jaw and closing his eyes.
Cas flushed a little in the dying light, hoping Dean couldn’t see it. “Thank you, Dean. I’m managing. Medication keeps the worst of the Anxiety at bay, and I spoke with Gabriel yesterday. He’s remarkably useful in banishing some of my worst fears when my usual routines are upended.”
“I haven’t wanted to cuddle anyone but you in months. I want to study with you. I want to watch Avengers with you. I want to more-than-cuddle you. But I want us both to be fully aware of what’s happening when we get there,” he explained.
He murmured in appreciation and turned into Cas’ side when he lay back down. Cas was quiet, silently stroking Dean’s back.
Resting a hip against the counter, Dean looked up at Cas through his lashes. “Well this isn’t really a professional request, so I suppose I could counter-offer with my usual terms of payment. Thirty minutes to borrow your bathroom for thirty minutes of cuddling.”
“I was thinking about Satan’s speech from ‘Paradise Lost’.” He chanced a sidelong glance at his friend.
Cas kissed him again, licking heavily into Dean’s mouth, before he groaned and pulled away. Standing up, he reached a hand down and pulled Dean to his feet, then tugged him down the hall to his bedroom. He didn’t stop until he’d pushed Dean down on the dark blue comforter and landed back on top of him.
Dean flashed a grin over his shoulder. “Not much further, it’s just over here.” He reached back and grabbed Castiel’s hand, and Cas’s heart set up a lively double time.
“What? It’s just lasagna, dude. It’s part of our arrangement.” Dean fussed with laying the spinach noodles in a perfectly straight line down the casserole dish. He stirred the meat- and vegetable mixture with a fork before flicking the burner off. His extra sauce was already cooling in another pot, and the tubs of ricotta were next to a heap of shredded mozzarella.
Dean moaned and wrapped his arms around Cas’ back, pulling him closer. “You’re welcome? If I’d known bees turned you on so much, I’d’a signed you up a long time ago.”
He turned and offered Dean a neatly-packed shopping bag. His eyes were distant, and his tone had crept back into what Dean thought of as his tutor voice.
Dean grinned. “It’s cream and butter and rum and sugar. This is the way Bobby always made it. You could probably light it on fire,” he admitted.
“Yes, of course, we should probably modify the parameters of our arrangement, given the experience on Tuesday,” he said woodenly.
They stood together for several moments, Cas’ weight resting fully on Dean while he leaned against the door. When Cas did nothing but cling to him like a vine, Dean relaxed inch by inch, dropping Baby’s keys into his jacket pocket and tentatively stroking a hand up Cas’ back. Cas mumbled something against his neck and pressed even closer.
“What? No, um, no. Nothing on your face. Did you say beer?” Cas flushed from his hairline straight down his neck.
“Well, without looking at his books, I can’t tell you what he’s doing now. But for Accrual Basis Accounting, you recognize the revenue and the expenses in the same financial period that the goods or services are delivered,” Cas lectured.
Dean pulled Cas close and nuzzled against his cheek. “I can’t believe my boyfriend hasn’t seen Die Hard.”
The pressure against his cock acts like an alarm, reminding Dean of what he wanted to say. “Cas, stop a second.” A grunt of discontent sounds near his ear, where Cas’ tongue is dragging up his neck. “Please.”
Cas finished the verse and dropped his phone in his lap. “It’s not very long,” he said apologetically. “I don’t know if you can make it work. We could pick something else.”
Eyes still focused on the screen, Cas didn’t even seem to be aware of what he was doing. His fingers moved downward, grasping one of Dean’s large, square hands. Cas’s thumb rubbed circles into the meat of his palm, and it felt incredible. Working with tools at Bobby’s, and then typing or writing notes for his classes, left his hands an aching mess most days. Cas moved on, working his way up each finger, learning each of his scars, as Dean bit back a moan.
“Um, not that I don’t appreciate that you have low standards for gifts, Sweetheart, but here.” Dean handed him the folded piece of paper that Cas had set aside.
Dean moaned into Cas’ mouth, taking that full lower lip between his teeth and tugging. “So this whole speech” – he interrupted himself to swipe his tongue across that lip – “was just to say that we’re a couple of dumbasses?”
Cas concentrated entirely on the movement of his diaphragm until the snakes uncurled and lay quiet. Next, he brought up his usual concerns as his therapist had taught him, and consciously reassured himself that nothing had gone sideways overnight.
“Stop. I know what you’re gonna say, man. But trust me. You’ll be able to hold their attention, I’ve heard you speak. I’ll just move around whatever words you choose.” Dean bumped their shoulders together, leaning into Cas’s side with an easy familiarity.
Dean couldn’t move, helplessly under the thrall of the enigmatic man in front of him. He was vaguely aware that his pants were too tight, that at some point, he’d reached out and put his hands on Cas’ hips, thumbs dragging across the smooth cotton.
“That’s why -” Dean paused and cleared his throat - “that’s why you bought me groceries. And why you detailed my car.”
Meg nodded approvingly, stroking her fingers lightly over the driver’s side mirror. “So? You want me to give her a hand job?”
“It’s just store-bought brownies. You’re not missing much,” Dean chased a piece of bacon through the lettuce heap on his plate.
“Yes.” Cas fiddled with his hands, rubbing them together over and over. Tendrils of dark thoughts curled through Dean’s veins, thickening his blood as he watched the long fingers sliding sinuously against each other.
“Then you’d better start asking questions, little brother. Talk to him more, see if he has room in his life for a nerdy math tutor.”
The rest of October flitted by like a dry leaf skittering down a street. Dean barely noticed, too absorbed in his work at the shop, and his online classes. Too much free time usually led him to the bottle, but Sam has been nagging, so Dean’s redirected his focus to extra credit exercises and reading and re-reading his textbooks. Turns out Cas was right – all he’d needed was a few weeks of support. He’s become an expert at this mature student thing. All on his own.
Cas held tight to Dean’s hand, letting the taller teen lead the way back through the woods. “You’re aware that he was out here smoking marijuana, and not doing some sort of required camp patrol, right?”
Wearing a green Henley loose over his lounge pants and a Santa hat, Cas appeared out of the bedroom with a smile.
“Yeah?” Cas turned and leaned on the wall. A toothy smile spread across his face as he met Dean’s gaze. “It’s nice to see you, Dean.”
Cas froze, dread filling him. “Oh God, Dean, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to fall asleep.” He reflexively tried to wipe his mouth, running into his mask. At least he hadn’t drooled on that broad shoulder.
“I thought this guy was just your tutor?” Sam asked. His voice sounded slightly distant; Dean’s laptop wasn’t exactly state of the art, but it still ran Zoom well enough most days.
Cas smiled. “That sounds perfect, Dean.” He sat awkwardly, not wanting to leave, but Dean didn’t offer anything else.
Dean closed his eyes, taking a deep breath and relaxing completely into the bed underneath Cas. It was fascinating to watch him release all tension, his body radiating compliance. Cas stroked a hand over his forehead, leaned down to meet willing lips. They kissed slowly, lips parting and spit-slick with pleasure. Cas started a slow grind, circling his hips and dragging his stomach against Dean’s hard cock.
Cas re-lubed his fingers and stroked lightly against Dean’s puckered hole. He rubbed circles around the sensitive flesh, watching with fascination as Dean’s skin rippled and clenched for him.
“I’m telling you, it’ll work!” Dean dragged his feet through the sand, leaving a visible, winding path as they crossed the beach. It was shaping up to be a perfect day, with the sun shining overhead, the shouts and laughter of the other camp kids far enough away not to be bothersome to the pair of them down by the lake.
“What?” Cas’ thoughts reeled through his brain like an out of control train. He hated his Anxiety, the way it made his hands tremble, the way his jaw clenched so tightly that his teeth ached. He could barely hear Gabriel through the roaring in his ears. He’d screwed up so badly, Dean had probably gone to the police, he was going to be brought up on assault charges….
Dean stood up more slowly, adjusting the vee of his own pants as he walked into the kitchen. “What’s wrong?”
Within moments, the couch springs squeaked angrily as Dean sat down and hauled Cas onto his lap. Cas also squeaked, flailing his arms and trying to move off Dean. Dean grabbed his arms and pulled him against his broad chest. He trapped one arm between their bodies and grasped Cas’ free wrist in his left hand. The right resumed it’s meandering path over Cas’ spine.
Dean hummed, his right arm starting a slow stroke from Cas’ shoulder to hip, his other hand resting on top of Cas’. Cas sank into his human pillow, secure in Dean’s arms, and focused on the movie.
“When you left last time,” Cas finally began, “I had the worst anxiety attack I’d had in probably ten years.”
I've increased the chapter count by one. Sorry not sorry. Blame it on my inexperience! Slot A would not insert into Tab B, so I had to wrestle with chapters 8 and 10, and Chapter 9 got roughed up as a result. This was NOT at all how I expected 9 to go.
The gentle flame that began with a simple chaste kiss quickly becomes a blaze of heat. Dean broke away with a gasp. Sitting back against the couch, he dragged Cas over to straddle his lap. Cas, for his part, kisses every bit of skin that he can reach while he settles on Dean’s thighs.
“I know. I just… I need a break today. This Accounting shit is mind-numbing.” Dean cast a worried glance at the thick book. “Every time I think I’ve got it, they throw in a new term.”
“I want to cuddle you.” Cas sat at the opposite end of the couch and mirrored Dean’s position. Eyebrows raised, Dean stared at him a moment.
He did as he was told, even washing his hands without prompting before he picked the phone back up. He didn’t look in the mirror.
Cas dropped the first hand and moved on to the second. Dean rolled his eyes heavenward. Tingles fizzed through him as his arm hair stood on end. He’d been with partners who’d touched him in far more intimate places without having this effect on him.
He didn’t feel calm at all. His breath sped up and he felt uncomfortable in his clothes. Maybe hugging a stranger was worse than hugging nobody. There’s no way he’d be able to relax enough to get the good vibes flowing.
“I – what?” Flustered, Cas felt his Anxiety spike a little. The evening had been easy so far; studying, eating together, but now it felt weird again. Like last time. Cuddling was supposed to help, not hinder, his Anxiety.
“Did you know, Dean,” Cas began, in a slow rich voice, “that in the nineteenth century, men would attack women and cut off their braids? It was a form of sexual perversion. They were called
Blue eyes met green for a long moment. Pasting on a wobbly smirk, Dean raised his free hand towards Cas’s face, rubbing teasingly at his stubble. “So avant garde,” he breathed.
Except Cas didn’t start talking. Instead, he pulled Dean’s hands into his own. Dean squirmed, his heartrate already jumping erratically. But this time, instead of individually massaging each finger in the slowest sexual torture known to man, Cas linked their hands together, using his thumb to rub soothingly over Dean’s. He crossed his arms over Dean’s chest, and dropped his cheek to Dean’s crown. He couldn’t feel anything but Cas, smell anything but his honey shampoo and custom soap.
When Dean finished prepping the salad, Cas carried it over to the table while Dean pulled the bread from the oven. Shuffling the hot foil packet from one hand to the other, he tossed it in the direction of the table and went back in for the lasagna. He cut two generous portions and plated them, handing one to Cas.
Cas sat up, pulling one of Dean’s legs with him. He pushed Dean’s knee towards his chest, and plunged heavily forward, altering the angle of penetration. Dean bucked and cried out beneath him as Cas tagged his prostate every few thrusts. Cas watched his face closely as Dean pushed down onto Cas’ cock. Watched as his face twisted in a grimace, seeking…seeking…
“Careful there, Sweetheart. I’m the one who’s not supposed to be able to walk straight tomorrow,” Dean teased.
“He was completely engrossed in the lettuce that he was washing. I asked about his brother and he gave a two-word answer. Then he told me that he’s already responsible for his boss’s daily meals. And that he had to end a call with his brother because he was preparing dinner for me. For me, Gabriel! I interrupted his time with his brother!”
“Oh?” It was all Dean could get out, as the fingers continued their petting, tripping down to the nape of his neck, trickling over the sensitive curve of his ear.
Dean hopped out of the Dodge, folding the soiled blanket in such a way that he wouldn’t have to touch any wet spots. “So that was, uh… your first time with someone else?”
“Dean, aside from a few moments, I’ve felt more comfortable in your arms than anywhere else I’ve ever been in my existence. I don’t want to flatter myself, or pretend to understand, but I am genuinely of the opinion that you also feel that we share a profound bond.”
Dean sat up so he could use both hands to peel the paper away. He cracked the lid on the small box, uncertain now whether he even wanted to open the box, if it triggered Cas’ Anxiety.
“When I was ten, Dad dropped us off at my Uncle Bobby’s house. He’d done it before, but this time he didn’t come back. Two little kids was too much for him.” His voice was flat.
“Do you know what the fourth is, Dean?” Cas ghosted his mouth over Dean’s exposed neck, lipping gently along the curve of his shoulder. Dean pulled Cas’ other leg over him, cupping those firm calves in his palms, giving himself an anchor as his senses were buffeted by the storm that was Cas.
“Oh fuck,” Cas whispered, his own pleasure cresting, popping goosebumps on his arms as he pulsed hotly in his shorts. He turned his face slightly, planting a kiss below Dean’s ear, trying to catch his breath.
Suddenly, he tilted his head and focused on Dean like he’d just realized he was actually in the house, taking up space in the living room. “Why are you here?”
A few minutes passed, the two men standing awkwardly together in the middle of the room. Dean said nothing, and Cas wasn’t sure what to say.
They spent an hour reviewing study questions, and Cas in tutor mode was almost his normal self. Dean was surprised to realize that he understood almost everything they’d covered, without needing Cas to do a deep-dive on any of the chapters. For the first time, he felt a sense of accomplishment while going through his notes. The information was sticking, and Cas’ examples made it so much easier to understand.
“No, Cas, it was my fault. As the sober one in the room, I should have been in control of the situation. I just wanted you to know that I don’t see you that way, as – as – well, like a friends with benefits thing, okay?” Dean’s eyes met his, asking for understanding.
Stumbling across the darkened room, Cas pulled back the covers one-handed and fell heavily onto the mattress. He lay his head on the cool pillow and sighed, eyes drooping shut.
Cas yanked on Dean’s belt, pulling his jeans open and sliding the zipper down carefully over Dean’s cock.
Dean pulled Cas’ head down, kissing him gently. “Castiel Novak,” he whispered. “I consent to all the sexual acts that we have engaged in thus far. I consent to you coming on me, or in me. I consent to you controlling my orgasm. But for the love of all that is holy, will you get the fuck on with it?”
Sitting back on Dean’s knees, Cas whipped the t-shirt up to Dean’s chest and blew a wet raspberry right on his stomach.
TRIGGER WARNING: anxiety attacks. I spoke with a friend who's recently suffered anxiety attacks, and I'm drawing on my own recollection of a horrible anxiety attack I had many years ago. If you're bothered by such descriptions, you may want to skip part of the story. I'll add some end notes to give you a quick summary and the start/end points for skipping if this is a trigger for you.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, Cas gradually finishing his plate, while Dean stuffed a few bites in his mouth just to have something to do.
This time, though, he could hear footsteps approaching. He stepped back on the little porch, boards squeaking under his feet. The door swung open, and Dean sucked in his breath. Cas was in grey lounge pants and a ratty AC/DC shirt at least two sizes too big. His dark hair was sticking straight up in places. On his nose perched a pair of black glasses, framing stunning blue eyes that were peering at him with confusion.  A drumline took up residence in Dean’s chest.
Cas huffed a laugh, except he didn’t sound amused. Dean wasn’t sure what was happening. He wished he could walk out the door and come back in. There was an undercurrent in the room and he didn’t understand what had caused it.
Cas smiled at the Scooby Do wrapping paper. “Where did you find that?” He traced Scooby in a Santa hat.
“My mother’s a doctor,” Cas slurred. “Dermatology. Skin’s the biggest organ, blah blah,” he muttered. He closed his eyes and splayed his legs out along the length of the couch, settling in more closely against Dean’s chest.
Dean gaped at him as Cas chuckled and left the room. He was gone long enough that Dean was dozing lightly when he returned. A warm cloth swept over his stomach and chest, then down between his legs, thoroughly cleaning up the leftover lube and half-dried come.
“His name is Dean. He’s a friend of Charlie’s. He’s working to get his Business degree so he can take over his uncle’s mechanic shop,” Cas said.
They turned and headed back towards Baby. “You doin’ okay otherwise, Cas? I mean, the stuff earlier this week, it didn’t, you know, mess with you?”
Dean shook his head like he had water in his ears. He was trying to follow along with what Sam was saying but it was hard; alcohol already had the reins.
“Dean, I was going to apologize to you. I put you in an awkward position on Tuesday. It was never my intent to force my attentions on you in a way that would make you uncomfortable,” Cas stared levelly at Dean, trying to ensure that the other man understood his sincerity.
Cas raised both eyebrows and pointed at his chest. “I’m not the one who smells like wet dog. That’s my offer. Take it or leave it.”
Cas ran a hand through his long hair, sighing. “That wasn’t how I expected my first time to end,” he said drily. He sat up too, a shudder of distaste at the sticky warm feeling in his shorts.
“Cas, he lives alone. His people skills are a bit rusty. But, he’s a good person!” Charlie said hurriedly. She sighed and carried the tablet over to her couch, when she slumped into a heap and propped the tablet on her knees. “I know it probably doesn’t sound like I’m selling him very well, but Dean, he’s really a good guy. You know I wouldn’t be friends with some jerk. And you know, you two might actually get along.”
Dean backed up and raised his hands. “Listen, I don’t know who you are, and I’m not paying some stranger to lay a finger on my baby. So thanks but no thanks.”
“C’mere.” Dean reached over and yanked him across the bench seat, wrapping his arms around Cas in a hug. Stunned, it took Cas a moment to raise his arms as much as he could, hugging Dean back. He lay half-over Dean’s lap, and his breath huffed damply against the collar of his flannel.
“Get out of your head, Cas. Have I steered you wrong yet this summer?” Dean picked up a smooth piece of seaglass, flicking it in the air and catching it in his nimble fingers. He ducked his head, trying to catch Cas’s downturned eye. When that didn’t work, he booped the other teen in the nose.
“So she comes in this week and wants the steering wheel changed. Since you don’t have any steering wheels in stock” – Cas rolled his eyes at Dean’s smirk – “you need to order it in. The customer leaves a deposit. Unfortunately, the steering wheel isn’t coming in until the beginning of November. When it arrives, you install the new steering wheel. You’ve completed the service. The deposit was paid in October, and the balance is paid in November when the customer picks up her car. Bobby puts the expense of ordering the new steering wheel on account with his vendor, and it isn’t due until December,” Cas explained.
No, Cas didn’t want Dean to leave as soon as he’d arrived. He had the feeling if they didn’t move past this awkwardness, Dean would find an excuse to stay away. “You brought your books, though, so I’m assuming there’s something you need to work on. Could we maybe run out for a burger? At least the drive-thrus are still open.”
Cas blushed furiously and scrambled off Dean’s lap. “Of course, I’m so sorry. The bathroom is just around the corner.”
“I think it might be best if we move forward with the understanding that Tuesday was out of character for both of us. It won’t happen again,” Cas promised in his calm tutor voice.
“The theory is this --” Cas used the pad of his thumb to trace Dean’s eyebrows -- “each person has a method with which they are comfortable expressing their emotions, or their love, for others.” Warm fingertips drifted across the height of cheekbones, made their way to the corners of his lips, and traced whorls in the sensitive bristles on his chin.
“I figured it wasn’t you but I don’t know who else it could be. The delivery came from that fancy Farm Foods store across town. And there was licorice.”
“Fuck,” Cas whispered. He spasmed over Dean, folding over his upraised leg and thrusting helplessly into Dean’s heat as he filled the condom. Dean clenched again, the vulgar word from Cas’ mouth shooting sparks of arousal through his oversensitive nerves.
Dean collapsed back onto the couch, pulling the laptop with him and draping it over his stomach. So what if Sam could see his double chins this way.
“You…you interrupted my high tonight. My night to be free of tiring social restrictions. But tell me, Dean, should I apologize? Have I offended you by my actions this evening?” He tilted his head slightly, dark hair falling across his forehead.
Cas woke in the morning with a dry mouth and sticky gunk gumming up the corners of his lips. His eyes felt swollen and sore. He felt like he was under water, his reactions delayed and his senses deadened. It had been a bad one, then. Sighing, he rolled to his side, every movement taking a concentrated effort to execute.
“Yes, I think so,” he said mildly. “All my limbs are still attached” – he took a moment to glance at his legs, as if to ensure he was correct – “and the roof hasn’t collapsed around me. And I don’t have any plans tonight,” he said with finality.
“I didn’t want to leave,” he said urgently, forcing the words out as he placed chaste kisses in the corners of Cas’ mouth. “But I didn’t think you wanted me.”
“I made my special lasagna, and I brought the stuff for a Caesar salad, and baguettes were half off at the store, so we can have garlic bread, too.”
Dean shook his head, hands clasped on his lap. “Baby turned up at the garage on my sixteenth birthday, but no one saw him. I don’t know if he’s alive or not. Guess it doesn’t matter. Bobby’s always been more a dad than my own dad was, anyway.”
Charlie tapped the screen. “Hey, stop. I really don’t think that you misread the situation. In case you hadn’t noticed, you’re kinda hot, for a guy. Maybe Cas has feelings for you too, and being high just allowed him to act on it. But you won’t know for sure without going over there and talking to him.”
Making his way to the kitchen, Cas paused in front of the coffee maker, shooting it a longing glance. Instead, he grabbed the water pitcher from the fridge and poured himself a glass. Leaning on the wall, he stared out the patio door, wondering for the tenth time this week if cuddling with Dean was a mistake. The anticipation of the session was really just causing more anxiety. But he had to admit, he’d fallen asleep last time almost immediately after Dean left, in spite of the nap, and he’d felt rested the entire next day.
Cas tilted Dean’s jaw slightly to the side. Intent was clear in his eyes, framed as they were by his glasses. Dean was afraid to even breathe as Cas closed the miniscule distance left between them and brushed their lips together. Once. Twice. Dry, ticklish touches. Dean sighed and tightened his fingers on Cas’ hips. He seemed to take that as permission, if he’d even been waiting for any. His hand tightened on Dean’s jaw, and he closed in once more, stubble brushing Dean’s cheek as Cas slid his tongue lightly against his bottom lip. Dean parted his lips, and then they were crushed together, bodies pressed hip to shoulder in a decidedly non-platonic way.
“Sorry,” Dean whispered. “I can’t help it.” He pushed his hard length against Cas’s hip again, groaning just a little at the friction. Heat exploded behind Cas’s eyes and ran the full length of his body, as if he’d been doused in hot water. He turned on his side, reaching for Dean’s belt loops to pull their hips closer together.
Cas lay stiffly for a moment, his legs curled up underneath him. Under his ear, he could hear and feel the reassuring thud of Dean’s heart. “This ok?” Dean’s voice rumbled pleasingly through his chest.
