It is now 4:30 and I decide to head home before John can tell I’ve left the flat. I hail a cab and while I’m in it, I think of what to eat.
He didn't feel okay. He felt shaky and small, nothing. He had set out to find Lestrade, to reinstate himself, prove his sanity, but now he knew just where to stop off first: where it was always night. It would be easy to find where it had relocated. He always had a foot in the darkness, after all.
He drifted at the edges of the park’s open-air theater…. The way Sherlock acted—like he or John would leave any moment—the
“Well, I can’t can I? There’s a—a whole world in his head, and he’s gone into it. I can’t reach him.” John half laughed. This was how therapy usually went. It was a gradual breakdown of his communication skills and then they said goodbye and he went on his way. God. And then—“Oh, god. I’ve just realized we haven’t spoken a word to each other in two weeks. That’s odd, isn’t it? We live together.”
I haven’t seen her in almost 10 years. The last time I saw her was when I was in rehab the first time, before the Work. I remember how we parted ways. Back then my father was still alive, and he and my mother came to see me. She always had a way about her that seemed to me like her soul whispered, rather than spoke. She stared at me softly, helplessly, pityingly.
He couldn’t answer, but his arm stung. Slowly, he extended it towards John, John who would take care of him, who would ease his pain instead of contributing to it.
Sherlock rolls over. “No…” he is very tired. He holds Bee to his face and cries a little bit. Bee is very soft but now his fur is getting a little wet. Sherlock rubs his face against Bee. He feels soft and slow and a little bit painful.
But the truth is, there is something dark in me that snaps if care is given at the wrong time. It’s the darkness my parents saw in me as a child that invited their abuse.
He turns around. It takes all of his strength, and once he does it, he buries his face in John’s strong shoulder, sobbing. “Da—a—
“Okay,” John said, making to stand up, but Sherlock tightened his fists in John’s shirt. John didn’t argue. “Up we go then,” he said. Together they slid off the bed without breaking the embrace, John careful to guide them so they didn’t step on the razor blades. John walked backwards as Sherlock clung to him all the way to the kitchen, where John filled a glass with water and handed it to him. Sherlock drank two whole glasses of water. After he was done, John pressed another kiss in his hair.
The words stuck in his throat. The tears were still leaking from his closed eyes. He couldn’t speak. His body felt as if were tied down. It hurt to move his body. He shrugged. He was paralyzed.
Sherlock struggled with cracking open a pistachio. “It’s going to make my stomach extend,” he whispered frantically, “I can’t chew it. I can’t digest it. My stomach already feels large. It’s huge.”
I smile in spite of myself. Something in me wants to give way under the stress of this month. “Of course, you do,” I say, drily, “I am, after all, exeptional.”
“Oh, my beautiful boy,” John finally whispers into his shaking shoulders, placing a kiss on the nape of his neck, “I love you so much. I love you forever. Please tell me what’s wrong, hm?”
He felt the pain too. More than usual. Instead of a centering ache, it ripped into him, made him shake and clutch his arm to his chest and whimper pathetically, silently. His pinky and ring finger were weak and, not for the first time, he worried about losing mobility. As he was a violinist, he had taken the precaution of only cutting on his right arm, though he was not left-handed. His right arm was his bow arm, and he had calculated that his left hand required more dexterity when playing his violin. Cutting on his right arm also meant that the blade was handled by his left—his non-dominant hand—which, while it lacked the same amount of control, it also, he thought, lacked the same strength. He knew cutting deeply meant possible damage to his ligaments and tendons—he wasn’t an idiot. He was careful, always so
John stood there over the man in his white coat like a helpless angel. He was by no means pure; he had seen too much, done too much. But he could not understand. He could not understand the depths of hell that existed in some people, so he could not give them compassion.
I consider the gym. It smells of sweat and disinfectant. I go to my locker and change again into workout gear.
Secretly, Sherlock was enjoying the drama. It helped him stay focused and hungry. It reminded him that he existed, that he mattered. Vain though it was, swishing his Belstaff coat around helped him feel on top of his game, aware that every small task needed precision and perfection in order for a successful result.
He hadn’t explained to Harry why he had suddenly showed up at her doorstep. She never asked—she’d been half drunk when she let him in. He assumed she didn’t care, and the next day, when she’d slept off the alcohol, she’d given him a bleary, surprised look, like she wasn’t sure how he’d gotten there, but wasn’t going to do anything about it.
“John,” Sherlock whispered. He stared through the dark, trying to grasp John’s silhouette with his eyes.
While John talks, I am able to eat less observed. I make it through my toast and egg, a small serving of peas, and manage 10 pistachios. Then I spoon out the yogurt slice a banana over the vanilla yogurt. I sprinkle cinnamon and drizzle honey over it. It’s a sweet dessert I like to have from time to time.
I huff and hang up. Sometimes my past really inhibits me. People check up on me when I don’t want them to. But I guess whatever haunted me back then still sits low in my belly and slashes hot at my skin. It’s not fully in the past. I glance at the mirror again, checking to see the sharpness of my bones pushing against my skin.
“Sherlock!” John cried again. He was fighting back, trying to push his arms away from each other, trying to stamp on Sherlock’s feet, to smash his head back against Sherlock’s jaw, but Sherlock was standing behind him, his entire body bearing down on him—
He fixed tea and sat at the table, flipping through a medical journal. He smiled at an article on the effects of arsenic on nail health, bookmarking it for Sherlock.
Sherlock let himself drift off. The ideological shit spewing from the public school toff at the podium meant very little to him. It was easy to drift off now. He was a little light headed, but that didn’t matter. A bad moment in the Tesco by the frozen products…. Passed out… he wasn’t eating…. He shook the thought off while reveling in the sensation. He enjoyed feeling light, like his brain could soar.
God, he didn’t know what to do. Last night had been so embarrassing. John got into his bed and held the covers up for Sherlock. He climbed in.
John sighed. He trudged to the couch through Harry’s dirty laundry and lay down. He could still smell the alcohol from here and was reminded of his father. Harry was right. He was waiting for Mrs Hudson or Sherlock to text him—hell, he was even waiting for Lestrade to text him, asking him to help him handle Sherlock.
Sherlock whimpers, quietly, then reins himself in. Daddy sighs. His boy feels too much guilt for his innocence. He doesn’t know how to be okay. Doesn’t know how to cry out loud. Daddy knows sometimes the guilt washes over his boy, threatens to drown him, and in those times it is up to Daddy to help his sweetest boy. “Daddy forgives you, baby,” he whispers. “For your arms. For everything. Daddy’s not going anywhere.”
“Pancakes it is,” Daddy says happily. Pancakes are more work but he doesn’t ever want his baby to think he doesn’t deserve them. Big Sherlock has enough problems with food as it is, and Little Sherlock seems to have fewer. Daddy would like to keep it that way.
I feel sick, but I keep going. I feel my stomach start bulging out and after a week of near fasting, I want to cry. I don’t want more of this. I don’t know how to stop.
His dad had died of cancer. John had been his dad’s only family to watch him die; John was the giving one in his family. When Harry had come out as a lesbian, his dad had come out as homophobic. Battle lines were drawn. John’s mother became more and more worn and wrinkled and creased each year she sided with Harry and endured her husband’s siege.
“You’re not the bad guy, here,” Lestrade said, “just—it’s okay, you know. He’s going to find out anyway, from the news. He can’t just ignore it. You’re… you’re really popular in the media right now. It would be—”
He stood there, groomed well, on the stage in the lavish auditorium that belonged to the ancient core of the City of London. Lestrade to his left. A reassuring presence, though he’d never admit it. The podium to his right. An idiot prattling away, saying things about… “public safety”… “what’s right”… “protecting those in need”….
Maybe he didn’t know himself either. Everything he said about himself, every attitude he projected, was a lie manufactured for the situation he was in. A chameleon.
“Poor pet,” John says, mercifully avoiding the topic of my cooking. “Lestrade will call you in soon. How was your day?”
Alright, then. He took two salmon fillets out from the freezer and began steaming them. A bowl of pistachios. He began to boil the potatoes for the mash.
John bit his lip, hesitated by the stairs. “Do you understand, Sherlock? Do you get that what you just did was wrong?”
“Yes, my sweet boy.” Daddy goes to the desk and gets his toy medical kit, but sneaks in some real bandages. When they first played, Daddy had wanted to play with his real medicine tools, but Sherlock told him the importance of toy medicine tools, so they have this one set made out of plastic, and the box is white with a big red cross on it, and there are three little casts and ten fake plastic bandages in it, and one pair of blunt plastic scissors and a plastic needle. Sherlock counted.
The Thames splashes against the docks rhythmically and I look at the reflection of the stars in the water. It’s cold—October—and the ice cream chills me from the inside. I shiver.
He cut himself. Each cut settled him in his transport and made him forget himself. He was just a body. Did it matter what had happened to him in the past? No, not really. He was his own person, removed from himself, from his childhood, his origin. He was no one, really. The world was big. He thought about the strings of connections people made, the predictable possibilities that sprung from these strings. He cut the strings that connected him to the past. His future was unknown. He had a blank slate. He had no past.
“I was out shopping because I wanted to give my good boy a present,” Daddy begins, but his good boy has already perked up.
was his big decision. He needed to keep himself in check. He’d let John decide on his own without any manipulation from Sherlock. Nothing else mattered. He just had to keep himself from turning into his father. He knew—he
He stared at the chart on the fridge. It read, “Sherlock must eat at least 2 meals per day!” in purple crayon. He touched the Winnie the Pooh stickers noting which days Sherlock had succeeded. He hadn’t succeeded very often.
Sherlock face seemed to screw up of its own accord. “I—I was pretending. I’m good at that.” He wanted to burrow under the covers. He wanted to hide away forever, and the tears wouldn’t stop. They tore from his body. He wasn’t strong enough for this kind of grief.
My head is spinning. My long sleeves are sticking to my skin. My stomach is empty, my muscles are cramping.
Food forgotten, he examined his arm. Typically he did not like to cut over old scars, unless he was trying to create one that was raised. He’d discovered that if he sliced through a raised scar, the new cut would also become raised even if it weren’t deep, as though the keloid tissue were spreading.
John blinked. Sherlock was… it was like a horror movie in slow motion, when a character closed their eyes and when they opened them, they were a completely different person, possessed somehow. Gone was the softness he’d cherished not twenty minutes ago. Gone was any hint of injury, of the young man who’d clung to him so desperately last night. John sighed. “Sherlock, can you just… come here?”
Daddy pours all of the toy doctor tools onto the bed. “Hello, Sherlock,” he says, “I’m Doctor Daddy. What seems to be the problem today?”
“He said you were, uh… on edge?” Lestrade said, squinting at him, as if that might help him deduce Sherlock’s state of mind. “He didn’t say much, though.”
Wiggins nods and I leave, calculating the calories I’ve eaten versus the calories I didn’t eat this week, versus the calories from the 14 miles I ran. I feel like crying.
Sherlock let out a breath in surprise. In that case, John’s insistence that he sat at the table seemed overly emphatic. He waited as John slid over a mouthwatering plate heaped with two pieces of toast, scrambled eggs, sausages, and strawberries.
He thought he knew why John liked to write so much when he had no talent. Because it kept his facts straight. Somewhere out there, there was a version of the truth that said exactly what John wanted it to say.
He had not cut in two and a half weeks. He had been too depressed to do so. He rolled his sleeve up. The scabs on his right forearm had healed and left angry red scars trailing across tired skin. He could not eat. He needed to be hurt. He could not bear it when his wounds had healed.
“Tell me all about it,” I say, and I watch John automatically tuck into the food as he launches into his story about a middle-aged man and his gangrenous foot.
“I’m afraid I have to go,” I say. “You’re right. I wasn’t meaning to be out here. Will you be safe tonight?”
What if John—what if John—he is so scared, he muffles his sobs in his hand—what if John doesn’t want him anymore?
Living with Harry is a whirlwind, just like living with Sherlock is. Just in a different way. Nothing to say that’s not completely pointless and depressing. Just. I won’t be updating very frequently. If you want to know how he’s doing, you know where his blog is.
Suddenly John was lowering himself onto the bed, too. The bed springs creaked, and Sherlock might have laughed any other day.
And yet—he was panicking, taking short, quick breaths, and yet helpless, so he lay there uselessly staring at his arm.
John slid into the bed, under the covers, and scooted over to cuddle Sherlock. “Sleep now,” John said. “Close your eyes,” he whispered, covering Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock could feel the warmth leaking from John’s hand to his eyelids. It was the strangest, most comforting sensation….
But that wasn’t healthy. That was extreme. Surely that hadn’t been Sherlock’s intention when he’d forced John to cut himself. Surely Sherlock had been—swept away by his—anger, or his—depression. John just didn’t understand why he wasn’t allowed to be sad, why that had sparked Sherlock’s anger. Maybe Sherlock could
“Yeah,” John said, putting his hands up. Another time he might have tried harder. “Yeah, alright. Do what you want.”
I usually feel safe with him. I sigh into his neck. I don’t need to talk. John will take care of everything.
He’d go downstairs to check Mrs Hudson’s flat, but all of a sudden, as he stands at the top of the stairs, he feels himself getting smaller and smaller. It doesn’t feel safe for him to leave the flat. He’s a kid again and Father—Father—
Daddy knows this happens. He has a soft towel and a glass of water on the nightstand and wipes his partner down, gives him the glass of water, watches to make sure he drinks it. Then, he gathers a shaking little boy into his safe hold.
John loaded his own plate and came to sit down across Sherlock. He began to eat. “I know,” he said. “You’re usually not hungry. I just want to make sure you’re okay, you know, after last night. Being upset takes a lot out of a person.”
In the end I can’t resist any of it. I buy a 6-pack of jelly donuts, 2 slices of New York cheesecake, and a liter of low calorie, sugar free vanilla ice cream. I carry it out in a plastic bag and head to the docks to eat. I sit, staring out at the water.
John settles firmly behind him, his front pressed to his back, his hands rubbing warmly against his stomach. Sherlock is held for some time while he cries, and he needs John so much, but he is reminded of—of—and his arm—
I let go of my parents. I let them go, even though I knew he would remain hitting her, isolating her.
And, as the tears start to dry, John gathers Sherlock’s wounded heart in his hands. He kisses his forehead, eyes pained. He holds him tight, and that’s all Sherlock ever needed.
Sherlock allowed a small smile to drift onto his lips and tilted his head back. If that was how you counted things, he thought lightly, by appearances, his strategy was working. Look at all his awards! From the outside, it looked like he refused to quit life. Life was a big project, a book to be written. Every single word mattered. Standing up on the stage, a man whom nobody knew, he thought about his article published in the Journal of Forensic Science. He had been invited to be the keynote speaker at a forensics conference, and had accepted, enthusiastically. He had even been offered a deal to make a reality show about crime. The last offer amused him to no end.
Sherlock flinched. “I—can’t. I just can’t anymore.” The dread was like sweet treacle in his bones. “I’ve been doing the hard thing for a long time! Okay? I don’t care. Do what you want. I—I’m just done! I don’t want to keep going!”
He spent a good amount of time just staring at his wrist and at the blade, adjusting his grip on it. It wasn’t that he was hesitating or trying not to cut; he had never in his life picked up a razor without cutting. He hesitated before picking up a blade, not after: the act of picking up the blade was the deciding act. It was the point of no return, the steadying of his hands. So no, he was not hesitating. He knew what his next actions would be. There was only one thing left for him, and that calmed him. He stared at his wrist, letting his body breathe, feel. He always took his time when he cut. It was a luxury. Cutting was an intensely physical act and it would not be satisfying if he did not allow his transport the attention it deserved.
He thought about letting go of Lestrade’s hand, but settled with opening his eyes. It was too bright. He squinted, pushed away some tears. He cleared his throat. “Where’s John?”
Sherlock pushed with superhuman force and the blade hit John’s arm, skittering across it. It barely drew any blood but John was shaking, shaking. “There,” Sherlock growled into John’s ear. “See? It’s not so perverted, not so twisted as you think, Dr Watson.”
“No—I mean—I’m getting it all wrong—I resumed cutting with you. I started when I was sixteen. I—I was—” Sherlock broke off.
John wanted to ask if Sherlock’s father had beaten Sherlock’s mother, too. What Mycroft’s involvement was. The questions wanted to tumble off his tongue. But he bit his lip. Instead, he said, “It must have been weighing on you.”
The emptiness tore through him. He felt dirty, contaminated. He couldn’t stay here anymore. 221B had been tainted by his horrific secret and he needed to leave. He’d move out tomorrow. He didn’t want to find out that John would not tolerate him here anymore. He knew how changeable people could be. He’d go. There was no other pathway forward that he could see.
Maybe it was this novelty that had him panting, gripping his wrist. All of a sudden, his usual appreciation of the beauty of his ravaged arm turned into disgust. It was ugly. Instead of feeling slower, centered, cocooned in pain from his mind’s never-ending churning, and able to get up and confront the day, he lay huddled on his side like dead weight.
Sherlock didn’t even try to hide his fresh wounds. He was leaving tomorrow, anyway. John took them in so calmly. Still, Sherlock’s shoulders tensed. He was always in trouble.
Sherlock closed his eyes again as Lestrade stepped aside with his phone out, this time to call the Chinese place he liked, and not John. The truth was that the entire time John was gone, Sherlock missed him. He missed him so much, and he knew he didn’t deserve to see him again, not after being violent with him.
“Oh, probably… I don’t know. Tea and cake. A game of cricket on the lawn. Whatever out of touch old ladies do.”
The realization kept him in bed for another two days. For those two days, he felt unbearably young and raw and cold and distant. He was sorry. He was beaten and he was dressed down and he was wrong and he was guilty. He was a child again.
Time for a bit of dinner. What would Sherlock be able to eat? Something very gentle. Perhaps some potatoes, perhaps some salmon. Pistachios, maybe. John wanted to get something with calories in his boy.
His phone buzzed. He half expected it to be Sherlock with an apology or a plead for him to come home….
The way he reaches for his keys is precise; he barely has to fish in his pocket for them. John will sometimes stand outside our door for at least a few minutes swearing to himself before he can find his key. I hear their dog, Joey, bark. The door opens and Sylvan Rabbit goes inside, but not before carefully wiping his shoes on the doormat.
People were cruel by nature and that was, John thought, where theater had originated. People liked to point and laugh at drama—at Oedipus and his mother, at Romeo and Juliet, and so on, and the plays ended each night—died—but they were never solved, and people pointed and laughed at the same things generation after generation.
“Wassup, Mister Holmes?” she asks tiredly. She eyes me as if she can tell there’s something wrong with me.
Then Daddy deposits something soft and squishy and furry in his arms! “You can open your eyes now, sweetheart,” John says gently, kissing his boy’s eyelids.
to help but I—maybe this is normal for him. He’s been getting distant. I tried to help him, but he—he keeps leaving. In his room, in his mind palace. So I’m trying to give him his space, but…”
I change back into my pajamas, so it looks like I stayed home all day, and pad to the kitchen. I make toast and soft-boiled eggs, which I know I will be able to manage. I put a butter dish out, for John’s use, not mine.
Daddy unwraps an arm around Sherlock and reaches behind him. Sherlock hears the crinkle of the bag that Daddy brought back with him. He closes his eyes, not sure about how he feels without both of Daddy’s arms around him.
John woke before Sherlock because he was cold. Opening his eyes, he saw that Sherlock had stolen the covers somehow, even as he remained huddled into John for warmth. Sherlock was snuffling into his sleep shirt, clutching him tightly. John sighed. The day before, he’d have had no idea that Sherlock could be so… diminutive?
He rolled his sleeve up in the solitude of the theater. The cut on his right forearm was not deep, had not even really bled. Instead, the blade had skidded along his skin. A thin line of red had risen up but not swelled over. It was more like someone had taken a very fine pen and drawn an uneven, dotted battle line. He was surprised at how much and how little it hurt. Just this little tearing of the outer layers of skin. It stung—not too much, but it was a constant aching reminder of how
Red scratches on the patient’s chest. Caused by the patient’s own yellowing nails. What drove people to this? What drove people to obliterate their own existence, slowly, seemingly without conviction? It was as though they wanted to commit suicide but chose instead to live in this shrunken state. God, why didn’t they just kill themselves? No… God, he didn’t mean that…. Feeling sick, John covered the patient up again, as though he were trying to respect the dead, and looked in the patient’s file. He was here for a drug overdose. Self-harming tendencies had been noted by a careful female hand. No family. No emergency contact. The name was probably fake, plucked from a fake or stolen ID. Once he was released, he would most likely be out on the streets again. Another overdose, or a petty stabbing, or the winter cold… it was too easy to imagine this man’s death. He was no one, lost already to this world.
” Sherlock screams, the praise and the punishing thrusts overwhelming him, and he’s coming, coming in Daddy’s lap, in his hand, while Daddy holds him tight and fucks him through his orgasm.
“I made bad things happen,” Sherlock whispered. He gripped Lestrade’s hand harder. The tears were starting to fall, finally, after years. “Really bad things. I made them hate me.”
And if I still need more, I can get it over with by having a spoonful of peanut butter, which, by the way, has a good amount of protein, fiber, calcium, and potassium.
At the moment I feel dizzy and my knees are screaming at me to stop. Old injuries make it hard to run on empty. Caloric intake significantly decreases pain. But I can’t afford calories now.
He puffed out a single laugh. That was the question. Why should he continue to push forward? Why should he continue?
I don’t want to see my mother. Thinking of her makes me lose my appetite. The world is just completely wrong for her and me. I don’t know what it is. I think, maybe, we are too similar. And I can’t face her because of this. I can only see her as a victim. Someone weak, even when she was unpleasant. She never had a chance. She was always going to end up in those horrible situations. I wish that I could put her out of her misery. And that would put me out of my misery, because it would mean I could be my own person. But I’ve inherited too much from her. The parts that pull me down into bed for weeks on end, with only hunger to mark the days.
Sherlock reeled back. “You were nice—” he began, but shook his head. He stood up, towering over John, the bandages dangling off his arm. “Your disgust in me does not change who I am,” he clipped out, his iridescent eyes flashing. “I’ve always been this way and you liked me, you were attracted to me. I should have known you were not special. You are like
John walked into Ella’s office slowly. Everything was as it had been the last time he’d been to therapy, before meeting Sherlock. The clean space, the elegant planes of the dark hardwood floor and the floor to ceiling windows. The warmth of the dark walnut desk, the white chairs by the windows, the sweeping curtains. He took a seat across from her, his usual seat.
He had thought John would understand the expressive quality of his—well, his actions. He’d subconsciously let John see him with the pills. Had wanted that attention. He wanted to be seen. He had wanted John to know him,
He told himself to get over himself. He bought himself takeaway from a tiny hole-in-the-wall Chinese that he had never set foot in before. He ate in one of his boltholes.
Father hated him. Sherlock wants to claw himself apart because he is alone, abandoned, and no one could ever love him.
“Sherlock?” Daddy says softly. He puts his hand on Sherlock’s forehead. “Does my sweet boy have a fever?”
“Hmmm,” Daddy says, “I think my darling boy is more sleepy than playful right now, hm? How does a nice nap with Daddy sound?”
He sat down hard. All the air deflated from him, and all that was left of him was failure. He didn’t hide his face or look down. He was stunned by misery in the way that misery can be violent, ruthless, consuming. He looked at his feet, still in his classic English brogues—shoes for the working gentleman—pressing down on gravel. He ought not to wear them anymore. He looked down into the stage. It resembled a pit for fighting, a gladiator pit.
He flexed his left hand, the cut on his palm reopening and bleeding slowly. The wounds Sherlock had given him were discreet. No one noticed them. It was a nice day. The sun was out. The flowers were in full bloom. He was so sorry. The beauty of it all made him feel insignificant. Sherlock was like this magnificent day. He was beautiful and John was just a drifter swept up in Sherlock’s world.
John could tell from the doorway that the cuts on Sherlock’s arm weren’t deep, but they were somehow more grotesque than any wound he had seen on the battlefield.
“I love you,” Daddy says. “I’ve got you.” He threads one hand through Sherlock’s curls and presses Sherlock’s face into his shoulder, the other still gripping Sherlock’s hip harshly.
Lestrade shifted in his seat. “He… told me—well, he texted me. He said… he didn’t want to hear from you. He said he wanted a break.”
Johnny. I can’t bring anyone home when you’re always here. And I can tell you don’t want to be here. I see you checking your phone every minute or so to see if he or Mrs Hudson has texted you. I know you’d rather be needed there than here, Johnny.”
“John has a tendency to overreact,” Sherlock said smoothly, because in all honesty, he had no idea what John might have told Lestrade.
“Er—I—look, I really just want some ideas for how to… approach him and get him to stop,” John said. “I… do you really need to know everything?”
Then Sherlock remembers Bee. “Bzz, bzzz,” he says, lifting Bee up and zooming him through the air towards the honey.
I move to the mirror and look at the thin man in it. I turn, checking the way my hipbones jut out. The joint where my femur attaches to my hipbone rolls visibly when I walk. My collarbones and ribs are visible too. I look like a ghost. A ghost with hollow eyes and scars that climb up my body like ladders.
He went home and stood in the darkened living room. It was warm here. He could just make out the outline of his and John’s chairs from the yellow streetlights below. Quiet whooshes denoted cars passing. But there were no voices, no screeches of tires. Of the cars, only quiet whirring remained. It was womblike.
“It’s been about a month. I just leave him alone, I guess, but I do bandage him up if he needs it. He’s been so distant, though. Like he rarely leaves his room. And about a week after, I found him… I found him…”
The hands before him were not his own. The hands stuck out before his line of sight like two ugly weeds. The only thing that was his was an ache. This was good.
This way was better. He was trying, at least, to be good. Trying to lead his life, trying not to fall in between the cracks.
“Such a good boy, such a sweet little hole for me,” Daddy growls into his ear, pounding him, punishing him so sweetly, and Sherlock
“Daddy, I wuv it!” Sherlock says, pressing kisses all over his new plush bee. “Hello, Bee,” he coos.
Lestrade didn’t pull his blankets down like Sherlock thought he would. He reached under the blanket until he found Sherlock’s hand. Lestrade’s hand—the one that had steadied him, had caught him when he passed out on that stage—was warm and rough. It was doing strange things to Sherlock. His insides twisted. His throat felt tight. He felt like he was going to fall apart and he was terrified. This was a new body—he didn’t know how to keep himself from crying—and Lestrade was just… holding onto him, holding his hand tight, as if he were squeezing the last tears left from a land that had endured years of drought. Sherlock clutched back at Lestrade. Tried to breath in and out.
I check on my experiments and water the plants. This takes about an hour. I finish up a blog post on identifying marks on the nails of murder victims. Then I decide to check up on a case that I have not yet officially taken.
“I can and I have for a long time,” Sherlock answered standing tall. The anger in him swelled. “It’s easy—here.” He took a razor blade. “Here, take it!
It’s the smell of sex, the sound of his bum slapping against Daddy’s muscular thighs, and it’s Daddy, Daddy, Daddy watching over him, filling him, that makes Sherlock cry out and try to go faster, as fast as he can, all for Daddy, and Daddy groans, smears his lips against Sherlock’s and grips his hips tighter. “Wanna bounce?” Daddy grunts.
He passed through the darkened hall to his bedroom. He stood there silently, unmoving. He breathed through his nose. He would not even open his mouth. He could not eat! Should he eat? No one would know—he’d take a bite from each leftover dish, might go down to Mrs Hudson’s and take some crumbs from the plates of biscuits she left out. He felt lightheaded. He should eat—but he would not. He would not. He never knew what he was allowed to eat—had never known. He never knew what was
“No, Sherlock,” John said. His face seemed suddenly slack. “You’re free to do whatever you want. You always were. Did you know, Sherlock, the reason why you don’t understand why I was crying—it’s not because I’m unreasonable, okay? It’s because you—you don’t get it, do you? It’s because that’s what friends do. They care about each other. And I was going to—to be there for y—but I can’t. Not anymore. You—you think cutting makes you… who you are, I guess. But I can’t.” He was backing away, hands up, his bleeding forearms bared to Sherlock. “I can’t. I’m sorry.”
Daddy nods, noting that Sherlock is much more likely to accidentally let slip details about his childhood when he is little. He gently puts down his spatula and goes to Sherlock and slowly gives him a big hug. “Did you know Daddy is so glad you’re here?” he whispers. “Daddy is so lucky to have you.”
In this life, with his… fake motivations, and petty ambition… he was too busy to cut…. He was too busy to eat….
Then a hand cupped his cheek. “Hey,” John said softly, “it’s okay. I’m going to clean you up and then put some bandages on. Does that sound alright to you?”
He’s just ugly and stupid and doesn’t deserve John. The self-loathing settles deep in him, a balm. He stops crying.
There was no meaning, no reason in anything, except for the meaning one assigned. He couldn’t think of any meaning. Nothing. A void.
John sighed, packing the salmon and toast into the fridge. “Come here,” he whispered. And he swooped down and gathered his sweet man into his arms.
Sherlock stared at the toast with contempt, then reached down. The toast felt spongey in his hands. His fingertips pressed into it. Before he knew it, he had ripped it to shreds.
He would never have a true friend. Something about him alienated people, repulsed them. He had thought John was an anomaly, but not anymore.
John had taken both sides. He was a nurturing person. He’d always understood, fundamentally, that this was what people needed most. They needed someone to listen to them, to validate their feelings, to give purpose to their work and lives. And Harry’s coming out had not, John thought, started anything horrible, nothing that he had really needed to side on. It was just a father-daughter relationship gone wrong, the way most of them were screwed up from the start. So John gave Harry care and he had let his dad rail on about Harry from the time she was fourteen to his last breath; he had sat by his dad’s hospital bed, had nodded and smiled at his dad’s bigotry and got him ice chips, and then when it was over, rung the nurse.
“Sherlock, we’ve got it,” Lestrade chuckles down the line. He sounds unjustifiably arrogant. I can almost smell the coffee and donuts. “And it’s only been a week.”
Sherlock shudders, feels tears rushing to his eyes. But Daddy holds him until he’s okay again. And by then the pancakes are ready to eat.
I know I have to eat. And I will eat. But lately it has been getting harder. My mother—as John knows… and I wish he didn’t—has been on my mind.
Sometimes John would appear at his side. He was gentle. He checked him for wounds, bandaged him hurts and he never yelled, never did anything too brusquely. Sherlock wondered if John was gentle on purpose, or if he could really trust him.
Today all the calculations and knowledge of precautions he’d developed went out the window. Maybe he was finally being healthy and developing a sense of self-preservation, maybe he was simply more of a coward than before, because he was suddenly worried about his bow arm when he had dismissed it as a concern years ago. What if he would never be able to play again? How stupid he was to throw it away. Trash everything and burn it to the ground. He’d always wanted to mess things up for himself—to fail in the worst and deepest ways possible. He wanted to ruin things for himself. He deserved it.
Also, pssttt—I can promise more action, John's perspective, and eventual (though untraditional) Johnlock in the coming chapters, but it will be gradual and there is a lot of pain planned for both Sherlock and John.
“I couldn’t just stop the drugs for you, Lestrade,” Sherlock said, and for some reason tears were springing into his eyes. “I—I couldn’t, it was too hard, okay? I—”
Daddy pretends to think about it, stroking an imaginary beard. Little Sherlock squeals, amused. “Daddyyyyyy!! Play!! Play doctor?”
He’d make breakfast and check Sherlock’s bandages. Maybe they’d go to the park, where they’d have a talk. He wanted to hold Sherlock’s hand and protect him and care for him. He wanted to make sure whatever it was that was hurting him went away. He wanted to keep Sherlock safe.
He was always in trouble. Always in pain. Always the worst. Always his fault. Oh god, what a pitiful child he’d been, oh god, oh god…
Fitfully, his frown carving deep into his forehead, he turned over on the couch, pressing his side into the back. He hugged a pillow to his chest. Harry had a problem with not following through. Every time she said she’d get sober, she didn’t. But what did that matter? John was just as invisible to the world as she was. He lay there until night came and Harry went out. He poured Harry’s alcohol down the sink and began to clean the flat. Not before pouring himself a glass of Harry’s good whiskey, though.
Sherlock gathered himself one last time. He didn’t know how to get John to stay. He didn’t know anything. He stood up straight and reminded himself that life is a war. “I don’t need your help,” he whispered, so strong through it all. “I did it before by myself. I don’t need you. I never need you.”
“It’s cutting, well, to the best of my knowledge it’s cutting.” He grimaced, remembering the cuts engraved into his friend’s arm. “I—he was crying. I mean, I came home from work and he was just sort of hyperventilating in his room, I could hear it. So I went in and he cried for a long time. Then he let me bandage his arm and then I asked him why he did it. And he didn’t answer. But he… in that moment, he
The short list of food that I consume, with minimal ingredients, is easy to count, easy to stay in control of.
,” and moves his hips back to fuck himself on Daddy’s fingers as much as he can while Daddy’s holding him still, the hand on his back pressing him down securely onto Daddy’s shoulder. His noises get muffled into Daddy’s body—Daddy means safety and Sherlock can come apart however he needs to, ‘cause Daddy will take him all the ways he comes.
“All right, then one, two, three—” to my delight I am lifted entirely up off the couch and he carries me to the bathroom.
My feet take me down the aisles, and I watch my hands picking things up and putting them down again. Wondering what I will binge on, which item feels safe to binge on.
John stepped back after that and he found himself in a depressive spiral. There was just so much time. He kept busy. There was still too much time. He found himself thinking he could just disappear. He could stop existing. It would be easy. He had pills. He had blades. He had ropes.
“Maybe something light first,” Lestrade said. And Sherlock’s heart felt so… indescribable. “Maybe some of that soup you like? The egg drop soup from that Chinese place?”
“I wish you’d tell me more about what’s bothering you, sweetheart,” John says. His chest rumbles when he speaks.
He turned to leave but John grabbed his arm, his right one, the wounded one, getting to his feet. “No,” John said, his eyes shining, “Sherlock, I won’t get over it! I’m your only friend, Sherlock—I need to help you!”
There’s not much to say immediately after sex like this. Just, Sherlock needs to be held. He needs John to be so gentle with him, because indulging Sherlock’s daddy kink makes Sherlock feel so hollow inside, but Sherlock needs this. Needs to call someone Daddy. Needs to let go momentarily even if it reminds him why he shouldn’t, can’t.
The plastic vase holding a fake flower on the sleeping patient’s plain bedside table, the linoleum floor, and the white walls all communicated tranquility and normalcy, but it was too forced and unmoving to be believed, John thought for the first time. He had, of course, thought this about the hospital his old man had died at (had, in fact, been glad that the sterile environment prevented him from collapsing into tears)—but his place of work had been regarded clinically until now, which, he supposed wryly, was the problem.
Lestrade bit his lip. “Look, I don’t know, I haven’t heard anything about it. But… you’ll have to decide, Sunshine. I can help you if you want.”
“Yeah, hi,” he said. “Erm… I’m sorry to have disappeared like that. I probably should have told you I was okay and I wasn’t coming back for more sessions.”
“Is there something wrong, Sherlock Holmes?” Jim asked, saying the name as if he were testing out the syllables of a nonsensical word.
“It’s not that! I just want to be able to help you any way I can! I’m so sorry if my being here has caused you pain, I never wanted it to be like that. But Molly you’re wrong, miracles and magic do exist!”
Finally coming to a stop when he hit the tracks, he fell to his knees. How could he return home? Or go back to school? He quickly looked in the direction voices were coming from. Slowly approaching the two strangers he could see they were men who were taking shelter in an empty train car.
“Kyubey isn’t a cat, to tell you the truth I don’t really know what Kyubey is but I guess if I have to call myself a Magical girl then that makes Kyubey the Magical animal companion. Kyubey can grant any wish and after you make one, it seals a contract between you two and you gain magical powers. In exchange for your wish though, you have to fight witches. Some would say it’s a small price to pay for having anything you wanted being given to you. Fighting witches is very dangerous and life threatening and before you decide about making a wish, you should decide what you want.”
Greg looked at the other boy who had appeared in front of him as the labyrinth faded away. He looked a couple years older so boy was not quit the word he should use. But there was no doubt that it was another Magical Boy.
Sebastian could read the surprise all over John’s face and giving another sigh he continued, “This isn’t a little pow wow. You’re boyfriend asked me to do this and we’re partners. At least for now.”
“Kyubey was there and of course Molly couldn’t see him. So after I saw her get on the bus back to her house I went to a place where no one would see me with Kyubey. He told me he could grant my wish and so we formed a contract.”
Greg knew it was right. If he made a wish right now no one would be put into danger. Still he shook his head.
Mr. Anderson didn’t speak for a moment, blinking in surprise at the sudden change of topic. Clearing his throat he said, “Very well Mr. Holmes. Does anyone want to accompany him to the nurse’s office?”
“Sherlock really is quite smart. He can look at a person and tell you their whole life story,” said Greg.
“Maybe he’s right. All this time I’ve stood back and watched and it’s not like me at all. I’ve been so useless and I could do something about it. If Kyubey’s right I could be helping him out but I haven’t been. If I just wished to be a con-“
“Why… why are you always like this? Why do you always have to be so damn mysterious? There’s something you’re not telling me Sherlock and I think I deserve to know since it somehow involves me.”
John’s only response was to curl up further into his sheets, moving as if he were trying to melt into his mattress. He couldn’t go to school because getting out of bed meant facing the day and facing the day meant facing reality and the reality was that Irene was dead. Irene was dead and no one would ever know.
It was with that action, did John realize Greg’s soul gem was no longer the clear blue it was before. Instead it was almost black with some small object glowing in the center.
“You’re such a fool John Watson. You’re always concerned with other people and never think about yourself. Who won’t you consider all the people who would be really sad if you were gone? Why don’t you think about all the people who love and care about you so much!” It was in that moment with Sherlock pleading with him that he felt a sense of déjà vu.
“Yes. I’ve liked Molly for a long time and she’s always said that she can’t be in a relationship with her dad being sick but now he’s better. I think that there might be something between us but if you’re dating her than I’ll leave her alone.”
“Sherlock…” John said stepping between him and Greg hoping that if he were in the way they wouldn’t fight but Greg didn’t care.
When John saw Greg’s face looking at Molly, everything made sense and he knew exactly what the wish was for.
“I’m sorry Holmes. I can’t help you out but I’m not going to cause you more trouble either. You’re going to have to save your strength. I was hoping though that there was one thing you could do for me?”
“I do hope you can keep up with the course work, I won’t coddle you just because you came in half way through the semester.”
Their introductions were cut short however by Sherlock arriving. He first sent an angry look to the animal in John’s arm and kept his scowl as he faced Irene.
It had to be the jam he ate before bed that was giving him these strange dreams. As he turned over to look at his clock he saw Kyubey sitting on his night stand. Being completely shocked he leapt out of bed, falling to the floor making a loud thump. Harry only looked down at him and asked if he was alright. John looked at Harry and then back at Kyubey, she didn’t notice him at all.
Greg was relieved that Irene was able to defeat the witch so quickly meaning that no one at the hospital would get hurt. John as much as he was relieved that the witch was dead, was concerned for Sherlock who was still tied up, he didn’t understand why Sherlock would try to warn Irene against this witch and be so wrong.
Irene however, holding tightly onto her soul gem used her magic to slow the woman’s descent until she safely reached the ground. John caught up to the woman and checking her breathing and heart rate, knew the woman was safe. He noticed that the woman had a strange marking on her neck. Irene pointed to it showing to John and Greg that it was a witch’s kiss. It showed that the witch was messing with the woman’s mind making her depressed and feel suicidal. Walking into the building the woman leapt from they followed the trail of the witch. It wasn’t until the gem began to glow even brighter that they stopped.
“I sold my soul for these powers. I think I can use them to feed myself since I can’t lead a normal life and get a job,” Sebastian replied in a dry tone.
John ran as fast as he could. He didn’t even know if he could find Irene and if he did he didn’t know if they would make it back in time.
“I did the only thing I could do, I killed the witch. I wasn’t going to die not because I wasn’t fighting back. But what I saw couldn’t be denied. So I killed him.”
“Contractors can only control their bodies up to 100 meters. It’s very rare for them to be separated from their bodies but when it does you humans always react so badly to the facts,” said Kyubey who simply carried on ignoring the very disturbed and distressed friends. “In exchange for your wishes I take your souls and make them into soul gems. It’s part of my many duties. You humans live in such fragile bodies I couldn’t possibly allow you to go after the witches like that. So as long as you soul gems aren’t affected then you can continue fighting.”
“Yep it’s one of my duties to take care of them after they’re used. You know it’s important to keep your soul gem clear. The more grief seeds you have the more magic you can use.”
“You’re right. I honestly don’t care about you but I do care about John and the way you’re acting hurts him. Anything that causes John Watson pain I will remove.”
John promptly closed his mouth and broke eye contact. Sherlock sat at the back corner of the room and he could feel the unwavering stare. John couldn’t help himself and from time to time he would also look at the new boy. Other students tried to talk to him but they were always rebuffed and even insulted. Despite acting very unfriendly to the other students, John couldn’t help but feel somewhat amused by the observations he was making about their fellow classmates. Eventually class ended and he had to go onto Chemistry.
John tried calling after Greg as he ran away from him but Greg refused to stop. He hated this feeling of helplessness. He just couldn’t understand why none of them could work together and keep each other alive.
“Why do you still care so much?! Do you know I’ve been trying so hard to keep you from becoming a contractor because you die! I keep on trying and you always die! Now, I’ve been trying so hard to distance myself from you and you still want to sacrifice yourself for someone you don’t even know. We’re not even from the same time!”
“It’s true that the others mainly care about acquiring grief seeds but you can’t criticize them for that. Only other contractors can.”
"After you make a contract with Kyubey you receive a soul gem," she said as she held out the gold jewel from before. "This is the source of your power and it's a little different for everyone. My range of attacks and abilities are no doubt different from Sherlock's."
Sebastian had enough of all of them. He was angry at being stopped earlier and everything was just going wrong. There was no way he was sticking around for all this drama and he knew that he couldn’t go after the witch right away.
“I’ll get it,” Sherlock said quickly as he vanished appearing downstream when he flashed even further down trying to catch up with it.
“You don’t understand! What happened the other day with me and Sebastian was more than just a fight. With every blow we were really trying to kill each other. Don’t you get it?! He was trying to kill me! How could I ever work with someone like that?”
“Thank you Sherlock. For everything you’ve done. I’m sorry for the pain you’ve endured. But it’s enough now, everything you’ve done is enough.”
“You wanted to talk to me about something?” inquired Sherlock who didn’t seem to care in the slightest about what the waiter thought.
Greg was unable to find the familiar and with his inability to find any witches he went to one of the few places that was familiar to him. Arriving at the hospital he was hoping to see and talk to Molly but when he saw her through the hospital door with her family, he couldn’t bring himself to disturb their new happiness. He only stood there a moment to gaze upon Molly’s face before he started to leave.
John was supposed to be hanging out with Greg but their outing turned into them coming along with Molly to the hospital. John didn’t mind coming to visit Molly’s father or lend any support he could. He did mind however being tricked into thinking that he was going to some shops with Greg and not dwell on the whole wish business and instead they picked up some flowers and magazines to give to Molly for her father and subsequently having to wait over an hour for her. He would have eaten breakfast if he knew they were going to wait so long but instead he was waiting outside for Greg to come out after saying goodbye to the Hoopers. They weren’t even going out with Molly, as she was going to spend the day with her family but apparently Greg had made a promise to Mr. Hooper about some magazine and neglected to tell John about it. John would’ve just liked to be prepared is all. Also it didn’t help that Kyubey was attached to him, following them around. It didn’t help with trying to forget about the craziness that was actually going on.
“I’m going. I have to try, that’s why I became a contractor to save people. Now I’m the only one left,” replied John who already looked weary from the battle.
“Don’t tell me you actually believe that crap. You really aren’t going to last long if you have that attitude.”
He looked around and there was John, who was partially formless and filled with stars. Or maybe it was that he could see stars through him.
“John! Greg! Oh hi Mike I heard what happened I hope you’re okay. GUESS what happened!” she exclaimed to them only taking a second to quickly acknowledge Mike and his grievances. Before any of them could try to hazard a guess she continued in another burst of joy. “It’s my dad! You won’t believe it, I can hardly believe it myself but my dad he’s going to be okay! Oh Greg, I’m so sorry for the things I said yesterday I was in such a mood and I shouldn’t have taken it out on you. But you were right! Miracles do exist!”
John had never felt like slapping someone but if he had to continue dealing with Sherlock’s melodramatics he was probably going to do a lot more than just slap him. He for once left Sherlock first and went to check on Greg.
Truth be told Greg was a little concerned about John being able to protect himself. But if he really was going to think about it, keeping John by his side made him think more clearly and not do anything reckless because there was John to consider.
“So do you actually have a plan?” asked Sebastian as they stood before the opening of the labyrinth.
Maybe this was all some sort of cruel ploy to a huge humiliation they were planning. Nobody has ever liked him. Nobody has ever called him ‘incredible’ and ‘amazing’. That’s right nobody has ever wanted him around.
“You know my purpose here and the truth of it all don’t you?” Sherlock remained silent and began to pull the trigger before Kyubey continued. “Then you know what it means for Greg Lestrade’s soul gem to contain a curse.”
Hearing footsteps coming, Greg stood waiting to see Molly with a smile on her face and good news but instead he saw her in tears. Rushing forward he caught her as she collapsed to the ground.
Their garden has blue hydrangeas. The mulch is dug up in strange patterns. Either Matilda has been playing, or something is amiss indeed. When mulch is dug up so randomly and violently, it does not indicate an affair, it indicates something much more sinister.
He lay in a dark murk for a long while. Or it felt like a long while. Thoughts of pills stashed away, thoughts of John calling Greg and telling him he could no longer take cases for a while, and nothing and nothing and nothing.
“John,” Sherlock said, “you’re ruining my pain high, so either stop crying and bandage my arm like you want to, or leave.”
Now he was no longer bed ridden, had blocked everything out. He was a great detective. He had a great mind. He was taking care of himself. He had showered and brushed his teeth. No one would tell from looking at him that he had once had no place to live, that once upon a time, he had been the scum of the earth, hated since his birth.
“Daddy’s not going anywhere, baby,” Daddy says, pulling the blankets over the two of them. “Daddy loves his sweet boy.”
“Sherlock,” Lestrade said. His voice cut through the heart monitor. “You… you were just a kid when you were sixteen, yeah? You know, the—the cutting, the drugs—they’re all things you decided to do. And, you know what I think about kids who do stuff like that? I think they shouldn’t’ve had to make that kind of a decision at all. They shouldn’t’ve felt so bad about themselves that they felt like they were all alone and had to take things into their own hands. Okay? They were kids—you were just a kid—and someone should’ve been watching out for you. You deserved
It was like a switch had been flipped. John took a step back from Sherlock, raising his hands. “It’s okay,” he said. “I don’t care anymore.”
He burrows deeper into the sofa’s cool leather, ignoring John—but, oh, the fact that John can tell this is different from his usual strops—the tears come again, tearing through his body, making him heave.
Sherlock lay in bed. He did not need someone telling him what was best for him. To have his capabilities taken away pushed one last stab of pain into his heart. It felt like betrayal.
He’s in his t-shirt. His trails his fingertips up his arms, scars from his past. In a wave of anger, he scratches down his forearm, leaving a red trail. He does it again and again until he is bleeding. It staves off the tears and makes him forget about John’s absence until he realizes what he’s done.
Truth be told, John had always been protective of his friend, but now he was going to keep an eye out. He wanted to help. He was Dr John Watson, Captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. He made things right.
The thing was, at the end of the day, no matter how hard he tried, how brilliant he was, he would never be understood by anyone.
“You wrote that blog post,” Harry said. They were sitting at her kitchen table, which was overflowing with the newspapers Harry had purchased. “What did you expect?”
Sherlock stared at John’s back, heart pounding. “You go to Lestrade—I can’t handle cases anymore—who said that John? Did I say that?”
There was no time to cut. He opened his eyes. With John gone, Sherlock had thrown himself into his work. He worked faster now that he didn’t have to wait for John and explain things to him. He had expected private clients outside of the Met to dwindle without the publicity from John’s blog. But for whatever reason—maybe he had created enough of a good name for himself—he was still heavily in demand. And John’s blog post had set off a buzz of activity that was sparking interest from the media. The Guardian published a short piece,
221B felt small fragile, the blue kitchen light pressing back against the dark engulfing night. The heat radiating from his mug warmed his fingers and he clutched it, huddling into the soft scent of milk and chai.
John doesn’t know that I’ve always had a gym membership. I think he thinks I’m somehow magically thin. And before I was thin, he thought I was magically fit.
“Ready?” Daddy asks. Sherlock nods into Daddy’s shoulder. Daddy puts two big strong hands on Sherlock’s hips and presses him down, and Sherlock sinks down onto Daddy’s hard unyielding cock—oh—oh—
I cross over to the fridge and thank god—though god doesn’t exist—that the impulse to hide this from John is stronger than the impulse to binge.
“You’ve always been available to him in the past, haven’t you? Why shouldn’t you be available now? Keep being available to him, John.”
Sylvan Rabbit arrives in a light blue Honda station wagon. His unremarkable brown hair is balding. He is thin, except for a small potbelly. I note the size and make of the brogues he wears—disturbingly similar to John’s—and the length of his steps. He carries a black canvas shoulder bag. The starch in his lapels and the gel in his har indicates that he works as a hotel manager at an upscale place.
“Your overreaction every time you see me is pointless and it doesn’t seem to calm your wasted anger. I don’t understand why you keep up with it. Also ever since you’ve arrived you haven’t shot me. Mainly because I’ve been giving you useful information.”
Harry was the one who had an umbrella but John refused to share it. His reasoning was that it would only make her get her dress wet and not really cover him, which was true but not the real reason he didn’t want to be sheltered.
“John Watson will do just fine,” answered Sherlock who without looking at John, was already heading out of the classroom.
By now we're half way through and I hope you guys are enjoying the chapter titles because in my first draft I sent to my friend I called it "Greg is an idiot, Sebastian is kind of an asshole but does have a little bit of advice that totally is overlooked and John is a sad person that is helpless" aka "once again everyone is unnecessarily mean and stuff starts to get worse".
Matilda must have been peering out the window at the dead of night. I know what it’s like to stand on tip toes staring out a window checking to see if the ghost of a parent has gone for good. Hoping for and fearing their return. So I know how discomfited Matilda must be.
“No, why would he?” Lestrade, damn him, sounds genuinely confused. Then he sounds downright chummy: “How is Mycroft by the way?”
He watched Harry and his parents and they didn’t watch him. For the first time, he wondered if that was because they didn’t care about him, because—he was never hurt and he only watched, so maybe they’d just written him off. Maybe he’d never been hurt—because Harry’s coming out must have hurt, must have created ripples of pain that he, John, had been insensitive to—so he wasn’t really part of the family.
They sat there in a kind of tense, detached impasse for what felt like hours until Sherlock wore himself out and his breathing slowed. He was exhausted and numb. A few more tears slipped out.
to have some humanity left. He had to. He didn’t want to hurt people. And if that meant retiring, that would be fine with Sherlock. If that meant handing back all his awards, Sherlock would do it. He had never wanted to be the scary man in the house. He never wanted to hurt John.
“Oh, never mind, Lestrade. Either Donovan or forensics will bring back the evidence you need. I solved it from the case file. Honestly.”
“You’re crying about everything, hm?” Daddy says soft and slow. His voice is sweet like melons. “Everything that’s ever made you sad…. My poor baby boy….”
The tub is hard against my bottom—Daddy says it’s ‘cause I’ve got a boney bum… Daddy puts a bath pad down and it’s even nicer
He was sorry and he thought about those pills more than ever. He knew they didn’t weigh much in his hand.
The front door slammed and steady footsteps traversed the seventeen steps up to the flat. John was home, Sherlock registered vaguely, heart leaping into his throat. If he didn’t act fast, he’d be caught….
Sherlock mocked, wresting his arm back. “Get over yourself. I don’t need your—your everyday concerns, your plebian worries. I’m not a duty or a—a charity case, Dr Watson, and I am not your friend. You are not my friend.”
“Fine,” Sherlock said. It didn’t matter either way. The way he felt—cleansed, controlled, nothing—it felt like he could be dismembered and he wouldn’t have any sense of his body being invaded on.
crying, Sherlock,” John said, but his eyebrows furrowed and his lips pressed together even harder. He took a sharp breath.
from cases? To tell Greg Sherlock was down, like he and Greg were two parents that could stop him from doing something? To assume he didn’t know what was best for himself? To assume he knew
—was sitting on his bed, hand pressed to his mouth, sobbing uncontrollably, and—John’s heart leapt to his throat—his arm… oh god…
I’m back at zero, anyhow. The running ensured that my calories in were canceled out by my exercise. I could eat all the microwave meals John has in the freezer though. All of them. I know it.
“Sherlock, I’m in it for the long haul, in it with you. You keep heads in the fridge, and you think this would make me leave? Hm? Just because you’re in pain?”
John places little kisses on my cheeks, my eyes, and my nose. It makes me feel small. I drift further.
“You weren’t bad, sweet boy. I know I gave you a scare. I’ll try not to, but when you wake up feeling bad or just weird, come find me, okay?”
“That’s right, bub,” Daddy says proudly. “Daddy loves Sherlock so Daddy wants to make sure baby’s little tummy is always full and happy.”
Did the see his fear? His aloneness? Did people want to pity him? Did they see how thin he was? Did they see the long sleeves he wore in the summer? Did they see the emptiness in his eyes?
It wasn’t just the meal skipping John was worried about. It was the number of calories Sherlock managed in general. Lately, it had been too few, and Sherlock, already slim, had lost a bit too much weight.
Oh, god, is there anything better than losing control and eating 4000+ calories in one sitting? Just vicariously eating whatever you want, whenever you want?
My feet take me to Tesco, even though I don’t want to go there. I could eat the whole store. I can’t get sugar out of my mind. The thought is gnawing at me from the inside out. My brain is starving. My calf muscles are cramping, aching. I imagine my muscles are deteriorating from lack of caloric intake.
me, and the next morning he was Sherlock again, you know? Untouchable. He… he left and didn’t come back for the whole day after I tried to ask him questions. And then—” he cut himself off.
“No… I made him leave. He doesn’t want to hear from me,” Sherlock was gasping now, adamant. “Just leave him alone. Just let him be.”
Sherlock couldn’t tell what John was thinking. So he pushed on. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he clipped out, drumming his fingers on the table and letting his voice stiffen into an upper class drawl he knew would set John’s teeth on edge. He held his head up. “I have a very strong will. Don’t make me cut you off from our… domestic arrangement.”
Sherlock brings Bee up to his face with his other arm. His chest feels so full, like his heart is about to burst. He feels Daddy run something cool and wet against his arm. Suddenly he wants to cry, because no one before Daddy even knew about his arms. No one touched him there. But… then Daddy is rubbing the sewing thread thing around his arm and then there are real bandages, not toy ones, and Sherlock feels good now, a lot better. Then Daddy is wrapping some cloth around his arm. And there were no needles, because Sherlock doesn’t like needles, but Daddy still made him all better.
“Sher, if you really want to be good to him, we should tell him so he hears it from us, not from watching telly or something—”
Logically, it was nothing. Hints of spots threatened before his eyes but a drink of water and some carbohydrates would restore him.
He couldn’t seem to grasp the wires. Pain shot up his arm. Everything felt so heavy. His fingers—they were clumsy, shaking. As if he had lost mobility. As if he had finally cut too deep, slicing through ligaments, tendons, muscle.
Sherlock thought. But he didn’t want to have to be in charge of himself anymore. He was so tired. God, so tired. So he said, “Chips. I want chips.”
Sherlock screwed up his face. Huffed. Pain in his chest. Shook his head. Soreness in his neck. Tried to roll over away from Lestrade. Realized he was too weak. Achey. “Turn it off, please,” he whispered. Pain in his stomach.
Harry snorted. “I can’t believe I’m mentioned!” she said, flipping through a copy of The Sun. “I wonder if there’s a picture of me?”
I get on a treadmill and run, collecting miles. I used to run marathons and belong to a boxing club. John has never known this about me. I don’t think I will ever tell him.
He went over it again and again in his mind and the more he thought about it, the more he felt that he was right and John was wrong. John did not know a single jot about him. He didn’t know what he was talking about. John was also not a mental health professional. Sherlock was not in crisis. He was sane and rational. This—this cutting, this depressive spiral was nothing compared to what he had experienced before. That John would not understand cut deeply. Not only was it painful, it was extremely offensive. How dare John assume and control him?
John, more than he could see himself. After all, he had seen that John’s limp was psychosomatic and that he had been to Afghanistan, could read the pauses between John’s words. He saw the steel in him, knew he was a perfect shot…. Maybe Sherlock had seen how John had first tried to help Sherlock, but then had given him his space, because maybe that was the easy thing to do….
Lestrade clutched his hand tightly, securely. Being touched was. It felt like. It felt like the first time someone had ever touched him. He felt like Lestrade was seeing right through him, was holding Sherlock’s naked, weary heart in his hands.
I will have to eat for John tonight. So, when the cab pulls up to Baker Street, I have dinner planned. It’s better to stay in control of the cooking, if I’m to eat. And, intellectually, I do want to eat, because I know I must.
“I’m not asking you to talk, Sherlock, not right now,” John said quietly. “Right now, I just want you to eat some breakfast.”
“No, John…” Sherlock found himself answering. He felt released from something, relieved. His shoulders slumped. “Please…”
So he did have a heart. And it told him what he did not want to know—that he was in a hospital. He fumbled shakily at the wires. Stop it. He didn’t want to know any more about his location, or his heart. It was the telltale beating of his heart. He didn’t want to deduce anymore. It was too much. He needed it to stop.
He would no longer try to forge connections. John meant nothing to him. He was in this for himself, only himself.
Come on, I made your favorite,” John said, trying to smile and cajole the detective towards the table.
he felt after his fight with Sherlock. He suddenly believed that this dullness was the worst sort of pain because it was eating away at him. It made him feel sluggish, helpless.
He wants to hurt himself. Everyone always leaves him, hurts him. The impulse jolts through him ickily. He buries his face in his hands, in his shame. He settles with crying—silently, the way father taught him. He doesn’t feel very brave right now.
Lestrade turned. “Ah, bollocks,” he said. “Donovan, bring Mrs Talbot back in for interrogation and we’ll take it from there. Anderson, get forensics to confirm Mrs Talbot did it.” Anderson sneered something that Sherlock ignored. Doubtless it was something predictable like
Returning to Baker Street felt bitter like defeat on his tongue. Alone again. A strange sadness surged up and engulfed him. He clamped his mouth shut as he walked up the stairs. Eating seemed impossible. He was sure he’d end up spitting it out, if he even got food past his lips.
He swayed slightly. Lestrade, standing to his left with his left hand clasped over his right, reached out and steadied him in one of those Lestrade-like movements. Economical. Minute. Concise and purposeful. Almost hidden. Lestrade’s wedding ring (more like divorce ring) glinted at him. Offensive, really, the shine. Almost worse than the stage lights. They were for appearances. He hated them on principle.
“So, I guess you must be pretty hungry, right?” Lestrade said. “What do you want to eat? I bet you don’t want anything from the cafeteria here.”
After, Sherlock is limp and Daddy slows down, but still fucks him good. Daddy peppers little kisses all over Sherlock’s face, murmuring, “I love watching you come, so good for me, so hot, baby boy,” and then Daddy’s grunting and coming inside Sherlock, and then it’s all over and suddenly there are tears all over Sherlock’s face.
I take a piece of toast and rip a piece off, dipping it into my egg. I see John watching me, and I wish that I were not so difficult. I wish he felt comfortable approaching me. I wish he did not think that I don’t want his affection when I’m big.
A young Ms Wiggins, the cannibal’s assistant, dealt the cards. People emerged from the shadows to watch, crowding around the table. The cannibal, grey hair hanging from her head in oily strands, bet two houses in Leinster Gardens. She smiled, mouth gaping. The other two bet a gold ring and a watch. Sherlock bet a pile of cash. Simple. Detached.
I can’t finish it, so instead I focus on John and note that the man with the gangrenous foot fits Sylvan Rabbit’s description. I file this piece of information away to look at later and follow John to the couch where he drapes me across his lap. I huff into his warm belly and again, feel myself relaxing.
A cold wave of self-hatred rose up in him—threatened to drown him—and the only way to float was to take up his razor again and press it to his skin to burn cold, steely ribbons through himself.
in his eyes—the tears. Sherlock was—John felt empty—innocent. He was not a perpetrator of a terrible crime. He was innocent.
He turned slowly. John was standing in the darkened hall by the doorway. He felt vacant, light, high. He wondered what he looked like.
Sherlock was so strong, even if he was broken. Maybe John couldn’t help him. John didn’t know how to help. He could go back to Baker Street, but that would be lunacy. He could try to help Sherlock, but maybe Sherlock didn’t need help. Maybe Sherlock didn’t need him. Maybe Sherlock thought he was a hindrance.
“You have been ungrateful your whole life.” My father clenched his jaw. I was too old to hit by then. His fingers were swollen with disease and I could see them balling into fists.
“No, you can’t, Lestrade,” Sherlock gasped. Tears were leaking from his eyes again. “You can’t, it’ll—”
Sherlock shook his head slowly against John’s chest. No, he could not say. He did not know, not at this moment. “Thirsty,” he whispered. “John.”
“Shh, shh, Sherlock,” John just says, frowning but not in a mad way, more like thoughtful or sorry. He gathers Sherlock back into his arms after seeing. He rocks him. “My brave baby boy, thank you for showing me.”
At least he wasn’t wearing his greatcoat, John mused. “Come and have breakfast, l—” he stumbled on the word
I close my eyes a bit. I let the hard metal bench of the bus stop press into my bum. I’m slumped against the plastic wall, in disguise as a homeless person outside Matilda’s house. The bus stop is filthy and smells of piss. If I were more in control of my mind, I would be fascinated by the filth. So much can be gleaned from the particular subsets of bacteria in different locations.
I stop at seven miles, gripping the handles of the treadmill and holding myself steady. I so want to collapse. I want to succumb to the pure unhappiness I feel in me. I want to go limp in the face of life. It’s too much. But 7 miles is my achievement for today. It’s something to do.
“My sweet boy,” Daddy grunts, his hard, unforgiving cock the only thing left in Sherlock’s world, “it’s all right, come on, come for me, I love you, I’m here, I’m not going anywhere, I love you, my brilliant, sweet boy—”
It was a fucked up situation and he needed to get out. He got to Regent's Park and found that he wanted to cry so he went into the park and kept walking. If he kept walking, he could keep going, like a soldier. It was a fucked up situation and the mature part of him told him no one was to blame.
“Yeah I heard about that and I’m not gonna let it fly. You’re clearly one of those contractors who think it’s their job to save people and is a champion of justice,” Sebastian said mockingly.
To say John was concerned for Greg would be an understatement. Sherlock had once again took off in his dark and unnecessarily mysterious way and before he could have a proper chat with Greg about what had happened they had to quickly get the hell out of dodge before the police arrived and questioned them. The people that were lured by the witch to the warehouse were all safely unconscious inside. When he went back home he was chewed out by his mum about being gone for so long and without a word from him. Harry expressed concern in her own way, first making a joke that he was meeting up with a random girl but the teasing ended with her sincere concern that if he has a phone he should use it to stay in touch.
“What?!” Then the next shock came when he saw that they were suddenly in a witch’s labyrinth with the witch right in front of them. “Where did that come from?!!”
“I’m not here to fight,” was the first thing Sherlock said as he stopped a good distance from them. “I only came to hear if you made a decision.”
“He’s doing okay and I think he’s improving actually. They’re going to give us a complete update later this week on his condition,” she answered with such confidence that Greg almost believed her words but a small quiver in her voice betrayed her.
The game screen lighted up with the words “Perfect Score” illuminated across it. Turning to face Sherlock, Sebastian’s face took a serious expression.
“And do you think that little shit, Greg could actually handle that? I’ll tell you something right now, the first sign of him turning I’ll kill him. I haven’t seen anyone that can come to terms with-“
“I just don’t believe that people should devote so much time to theories and ideas about space, they really do nothing for the average person but fill their head with useless information. “
“Do you mean it?” John gave an angry huff but he could tell that Sherlock was being sincere in his questions. The thing was that he didn’t know why he was being asked all these questions. “Of course I mean it, I wouldn’t allow anything to hurt my family or friends if I couldn’t stop it. Now what is going on?”
John then went forward to meet his fate as Sherlock lunged forward trying to keep him from going. His hand barely missed John’s as he cried out.
Greg’s soul gem burst open throwing Sebastian and John with a huge amount of force. The thing floating inside of the soul gem, morphed into an eye like object that John recognized as a witch’s egg. With its creation an even stronger blast of energy came, this time flinging Greg’s body away from it. Sebastian had changed into is contractor uniform and grabbing ahold of John he was able to magically reinforce his position so they wouldn’t be flung back any further.
Mr. Anderson motioned to John to come forward. Sherlock recognized him as a boy in his homeroom. He still had some crumbs on his shirt from a breakfast he clearly rushed through eating and the way his tie was tied.
“Not out there! The news said it was the worst storm that’s probably ever hit London. You’re my little brother it’s my job to take care of you!”
John and Greg grimaced, not feeling very well about her answers.They were honest to say the least. John did know though, that Sherlock had turned down the grief seed which had to mean that he wasn’t in it for those small rewards. What could he have possibly been his wish and why did he make it? Looking in the direction Sherlock left he wondered if he would ever know.
And even quicker than the pull of the trigger, Sebastian shot at nothing and Greg was far behind him while Sherlock was just in the middle. The scene had completely changed and John couldn’t be more relieved.
“It seems to have escaped,” she muttered to herself. Walking towards them she said, “If I had come any later you two would probably be dead.” In a blink of an eye, her clothes turned back into her school uniform.
Greg after some time came out and John wondered if he should’ve just gotten lunch on his own. Greg did apologize saying that it almost slipped his mind and that they were still going to have a good day together.
John didn’t know what to do. In all his time knowing Sherlock, he had never cried. He’s only ever been angry or disappointed. There were times when he almost thought Sherlock was a machine with the lack of emotions but this moment definitely proved otherwise. Then a sudden wave of nostalgia struck him. Like a weird sense of Déjà vu.
“You’re friend’s soul gem became too tainted. It contained a curse and he turned into a witch,” stated Sherlock calmly.
“Look,” Sebastian sighed, ”Sherlock wanted me to talk to you and you wanted to listen before so you can come along with me now or you can just go back in your house and mope.”
John’s eyes were wide and he was afraid to speak, thinking that Sebastian might hit him or maybe worse. Sebastian who was breathing heavily eventually released John and took a couple steps back.
During lunch, Greg and John went to a more secluded part of the school while they ate. Molly who was still upset at them had decided to eat with Tom and the others inside while they snuck onto the roof.
John waited til he heard Harry walk away, to leave his room. He didn’t blame Harry for worrying about him, it was understandable really. If he could calm her fears he would but there was nothing he could say to her.
“Please John, go be with your family. I have to deal with this alone,” Sherlock gently said practically begging him.
If you want to know why the rabbit it's supposed be Blue Bell from the Hounds of the Baskervilles, a lot of the witches will have some theme from Sherlock episodes.
John could see that Sherlock was taking a moment to answer him and a peculiar look flickered across his face before settling to the same somber expression he typically had.
Sebastian sat back down on the grass, finishing his food. He called for a cab to come pick them up as the sun began to set. There was still one thing bugging John though.
“You really are too kind.” Sherlock drew away from John’s grasp. “Remember this, sometimes kindness leads to greater tragedy. It’s late now. You should go home, I’m sure your family is wondering where you’ve been.”
“Why didn’t you let me kill him?” asked Sebastian who was more than a little miffed about being told not to kill the witch.
“This is a grief seed and it’s the most important thing about witch hunting. It’s the reward you get when you defeat a witch. Just watch.” She held the seed to her gem and the cloudiness that was there before was instantly cleared. “It restores the magic that you use.” She then turned around and threw it at Sherlock who was standing in the shadows. “It should be good for one more use.”
Greg and John said goodbye to Irene as she lingered around the fountain. Once they were gone Sherlock came from the shadows and approached Irene.
Before John could reply to her flippant remark Irene suddenly stopped walking and turned sharply around. John followed her line of sight and saw Sherlock walking towards them. He couldn’t explain the warmth in his chest that blossomed knowing that Sherlock had come. The mood was quickly spoiled though.
John watched Greg closely, his friend did seem happy with his decision and he couldn’t criticize him for it. But to talk about saving Irene, it was foolish neither of them were to blame and both of them were going to need to accept that. John was still worried, and he didn’t think that he would ever feel at peace again.
“Is that anyway to talk to your savior?” The flower monsters were coming closer and making a loud agitated sound. Turning to face the flowers she pulled out what looked like a golden jewel. “Hold on to your apology sweetheart, I have to take care of these things first.”
Daddy made pancakes in the shape of Winnie the Pooh characters, because Pooh loves honey and so does Sherlock. Daddy gives Sherlock the honey, which is kept in a plastic bottle the shape of a bear. Sherlock drizzles his honey on his pancakes, making sure not to squish the bear too hard. He watches as the golden honey lands on his Pooh pancake. Pooh is happy because now he has honey! Sherlock smiles proudly. Daddy presses a kiss into his hair.
The hospital blanket was bunched up by his feet. He could feel that his hospital gown was short sleeved. His ugly scarred arms. Naked. “Need the blanket.”
There was a smattering of polite applause. He collected his winnings and stood, gathering his coat around him. The cannibal placed a hand on his shoulder. He could feel her nails digging into his flesh. “It’s been a while. Would you stay for a bit, my dear?” she leered, licking her lips.
Daddy smiles at Sherlock, too. He reaches over and wipes some honey from Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock wriggles in his chair, feeling small and safe.
John shifts in his sleep. I don’t want to speak to him. The way John treats me is foreign. It is a little too odd to accept his little gestures here and there. I feel like I am in someone else’s life. It’s hard for me to feel close to him. Even though I love him.
“You gotta make these hard decisions if you want to keep going, Sunshine, yeah? If you want to keep John in your life?”
Lestrade sighed. He looked very tired. “What about your other engagements? Speaking at the forensics conference?”
I was inured to these remarks. I let them wash over me and pretended not to hear. I even pretended to fall asleep. I listened to them leave and knew that if I didn’t try to keep in contact, we would never speak again. And that’s what happened.
Sherlock starts eating. Daddy sits across from him, carefully watching him and eating his own pancakes. Sherlock feels better—safe—when Daddy watches him. He knows Daddy would never let anything bad happen to him. He puts a big bite of pancake in his mouth and smiles at Daddy.
That was the wrong word. Almost as soon as John had thought it, one of Sherlock’s eyes opened and, even without the assistance of the other eye, radiated with piercing accusation.
In the beginning, I balked at this treatment. With all my intellect, I surely could not take pleasure from being treated like an infant. But John has a magic about him, something I don’t understand how he does. He makes his words wash over me like I am sinking down into a cloud of comfort. He makes the whole room feel warmer.
John frowned. If Sherlock still couldn’t put his experiences into words… He rubbed Sherlock’s back encouragingly. “So, are you going?”
Kissing Sherlock’s forehead again, John got up, gently untangling himself from his friend. For a moment, he gazed at Sherlock. He’d never seen the man genuinely sleep before, especially not in a bed. Now, wrapped in white sheets and that soft, striped blanket, just the tip of his head sticking out, in the gentle morning light, Sherlock looked so young, so… precious.
Sherlock wanted—he didn’t know what he wanted. He wanted John to stay. He wanted him to leave and never come back.
Immediately, John wraps around him, gathering his small, shaking body into his hold. “Shh,” he whispers, “Shh, Daddy’s here, Daddy’s here, my darling boy.”
John nodded once, then made his way to the kitchen. Taking care of Sherlock started now, and after yesterday, Sherlock needed sustenance. He started on scrambled eggs, sausages, and toast, hoping the sound of the pan wouldn’t waken his friend. All he wanted was for Sherlock to get some sleep, eat enough… (he wanted to hold him when he got lonely, bath him when he was too sad to so himself, feed him when it was hard for him to eat…)
He wasn’t sure what the fixation on food meant. Just that he was hungry but he didn’t—couldn’t—eat. He stared into the fridge, itching in his body, feeling restless. He could not eat! He forbade himself to eat, even drink water. He would not consume and he would not waste. If he ate—if he ate—
I know this is a bit of a filler chapter, but I'm really not in a good place right now and I wanted to fantasize about having someone care about me the way John cares about Sherlock.
It was Harry. He stared at the screen, her name, Harry Watson, burning into his eyes. Could he do it? Could he do it one more time? Could he really do anything? He couldn’t for Sherlock. He’d lost Sherlock.
“Thank you,” John said. “I’m glad you’re letting me do this.” He began to wipe dried blood off Sherlock’s arm. His touch was cool and clinical, and suddenly the thought occurred that John had been trained for this and Sherlock felt sharply rejected, dismissed. He bit his lip and looked away.
But there had been nothing. Sherlock seemed to be doing fine, better even, without him. He wondered if this was his life now. A bland boring flat, a boring job, and a weary, alcoholic sister. He realized, even if he wasn’t there, Sherlock’s life went on, and because of that, so did everyone else’s: Lestrade’s, Mrs Hudson’s, Sally’s, even Anderson’s. He hadn’t updated his blog in more than a month, but Sherlock was becoming stronger than ever. John wasn’t needed. And there was nothing in his life for him to write about for his blog now that he didn’t have Sherlock.
“Baby,” Daddy says. He fastens his hand around Sherlock’s. “I promise to always be in the flat when you wake up, hm?”
“That’s not going to happen. I want to protect him and not drag him down any further into this crazy world.”
Just as John was about to say the words and Sebastian about to pull the trigger, John heard that familiar voice again.
He threw it downstream going into the fast current but what he didn’t expect was the reaction from Sherlock and Sebastian.
“I can’t believe I was talked into this. I knew there was nothing that could be done! I knew and yet I still fucking fell for it! And now I know. I know for sure I couldn’t save Jim.”
Being here also kept Greg from dwelling on Irene. Exchanging his own misery for someone else’s. John didn’t attend school and frankly Greg couldn’t blame him. If it weren’t for Molly, Greg probably wouldn’t have left his house either. He didn’t understand what it actually meant to fight and hunt witches before but now, there was no way he could make a contract. There was just no way.
Harry gave a small frown but didn’t comment. As she began leaving his room she called back saying, “If you want to make it to school on time I suggest you hurry the hell up or else you’re going to be late.”
“Hey fuck you I know what I’m doing I don’t need to talk to Steve,” retorted the first man while chuckling.
The universe was essentially dying. The astounding number of creatures throughout the universe were using more energy than could be replaced and the solution was magical children. People’s souls had a huge amount of energy and when they traded them away for their wish they were helping the universe by damning themselves. Also it was the incubators, what Kyubey is, who have helped humanity carry on and evolve by granting the wishes of children. The real kicker was that Kyubey still wanted him to make a contract. He said that John’s potential was so vast that not only would he be the most powerful magical boy ever and then turn into the worst witch. Subsequently destroying humanity. So if he ever wanted to save the universe he should go find Kyubey. The creature was trying to guilt trip him into it and the worst thing was that over the course of the last couple days he almost wanted to give into it.
“Well it was after I went to the hospital with Molly. She was just really torn up about her dad. Mr. Hooper doesn’t deserve that, none of the Hoopers deserve what they were going through."
“I just thought maybe after all this time you liked her too. Thanks a lot for clearing things up. I didn’t want to look like a complete idiot asking out a girl who is already dating. She can still turn me down but at least I know she’s available and can try. I’ll talk to you later.”
When he arrived back home with his family he was changing out of his clothes when he heard a soft knock on his door.
“Do you want to help him?” it asked.John looked at the animal then quickly back at the boy who despite the great length between them, he knew he was looking back at him. He could see that the dark curly haired boy was trying to scream something but he couldn’t hear it. “All you have to do is make a wish.”
Sherlock failed to get out of Magnussen’s immediate range and was slammed into the ground, a familiar position. He could only watch as the witch continued his destruction as his vision settled. He could feel blood trickle down his face, he needed to heal himself. Probably a cracked skull, but he couldn’t focus on the pain. This body was just an empty vessel, it could take more. But still he didn’t get up.
Crossing the threshold they first tried to go undetected until they found Greg but that didn’t last long. Sebastian soon busted through the rest of the prison themed labyrinth to reach the core room which they were stuck in before. He knew time was precious, even more so because he wasn’t trying to kill it but keep John and himself alive for as long as possible. Hopefully Sherlock didn’t show up soon either.
Once again the clanging noise filled the air and Sebastian put up a barrier around John. It was the best he could do without actually hovering around him and it gave him a little more flexibility. The faceless prisoners were coming in droves and Sebastian was doing all he could to keep them back. It didn’t help that this time Greg was actively fighting him too. The fox monstrosity wielded something close to a police baton and was swinging it swiftly down at him. If Sebastian was a lesser contractor he would’ve been crushed immediately.
Sherlock’s heart fluttered at that smile but his composure didn’t betray him, he simply extended his hand and said, “I know.”
Sebastian dematerialized the magic scope that he used to watch John and Greg, focusing his whole attention to Kyubey.
“No please! I won’t allow it!” This time it was John who embraced Sherlock, holding him tightly as blood smeared on his shirt.
“You’ve sold your soul for your wish and now you must live the rest of your life as a magical boy. There is no turning back from this.”
Jim had a look on his face debating whether or not he was going to acknowledge actually being called on, it was Sebastian who lead him across the street.
“It’s ultimately not up to you. One day he’s going to be in a situation and he’ll make a contract with me.”
John didn’t know what the hell was going on but still decided to pick up the animal. As he began to rise and walk out of the ally he saw a figure in front of him.
Then blinding flashes of light shot at it and in front of him appeared John. Sherlock was speechless for only a moment when another person appeared before him wearing a small skirt and a racy top.
“If there was a way you could’ve saved Jim, wouldn’t you want to know? Please help me do what you couldn’t.”
“What do you think I’m doing? What are you doing?! You let the familiar get away so that it could go kill more people!” seethed Greg.
“Get up now!” she yelled, ripping off his bedsheets. “You’re not sick and you can’t afford to miss another day of school. So get your ass out of bed and downstairs in five minutes or I swear I’ll set your bed on fire!”
“Well look who showed up. The witch escaped, you can follow and take care of it. I’ll let it go this time.”
Molly simply shrugged her shoulders and replied, “I don’t know but it’s an interesting thing to think about.”
The person looked over their shoulder and John could clearly see that it was indeed Greg. His clothes though were different from the uniform he wore earlier, having blue cape and knee high boots.
Perhaps this was his punishment for not being able to help Irene. For being a coward and not helping anyone else by making a contract. This was a suitable end for someone who refused to help.
The sun was burning bright and the air was heavy with humidity. Sherlock was walking down the street, holding hands with John. Molly and Tom were behind them eating ice cream cones. Greg was behind all of them like a mother making sure all her children were within her line of sight. The street was full with people having places they needed to reach to and stores were filled with others trying to escape the heat.
“You’re right. Irene deserves this but she died. Still this grief seed belongs to those that made a contract and you can’t have it.” John couldn’t understand why Sherlock was acting this way and not even trying to defend himself. He had saved them and it wasn’t his fault about what had happened to Irene. As Sherlock turned to go his parting words were, “Don’t forget this night. An early death is an inevitable fate to all those who make a contract.”
“Really?” John couldn’t imagine not speaking to his parents or Harry. Sure they’ve had their rough patches but what family doesn’t? “I guess it makes it easier on you then. Still they must miss you.”
As she walked away, John looked helplessly towards Sherlock knowing that he couldn’t do anything to undo Irene’s magic. Following her to where Greg and Kyubey where he left Sherlock behind. He could still hear him yell after them.
Sherlock didn’t know how he felt about John Watson. He never met anyone like him before. John seemed to like him for just being… himself. Actually John seemed to really be amazed at all of the deductions when usually he would be told to ‘piss off’. Also John was slowly integrating him with his other group of friends, namely Molly Hooper and Greg Lestrade. Greg also didn’t seem to mind Sherlock but he didn’t take the deductions half as well, especially when he had to apologize to other people. Sherlock also knew that Lestrade was hopelessly in love with Molly who liked another boy named Tom. This wasn’t as obvious to other people and John told him not to tell anyone about it because it would make things awkward and it wasn’t the right time. Whatever that means.
It was Sebastian and a person Sherlock could only assume was James Moriarty. Sebastian seemed to be amused with the way Jim was complaining about the god awful heat when feeling the stares he also stopped. Jim was angry at him for not moving and was trying to get him to pay attention. Sherlock and Sebastian’s eyes met with the former not knowing if somehow this Sebastian knew. Jim looked across the street to see what had captured his boyfriend’s interest and saw the group of friends who were now all looking at them. Surprisingly it was Molly who recognized them.
“Your friend dropped you off saying to take care of you. I tried to offer him shelter but he refused. He told me not to let you do anything stupid and I promised I would try.”
John had waited until after school to tell Molly and Greg about his conversation with Sherlock. They had all gone to a little café that Molly especially liked to eat at. John found the price a little too expensive for the quality and quantity of food he received, but it was one against two. John did hesitate about telling them at all or for that matter coming to the café. He thought if he didn’t come maybe it would allow for some more social time between Greg and Molly that wasn’t in a hospital. Molly’s father was very sick and had to stay in the hospital for treatment. If coming here made her happy then how could Greg, who obviously liked her, say no?
“Sherlock,” he began turning to him and smiled “I don’t regret saving you I want you to know that. I’m happy that we met.”
It was still raining. Three days later and it was still raining. John hadn’t left his room since Greg became a witch. Now he knew it all. The truth behind being a magical boy and what it meant to actually make a wish. So Sherlock in the end was right and he had tried so hard not to listen to him before. If he hadn’t been so bloody vague about it all then maybe he could’ve saved Greg. Maybe if Sherlock acted normal and told them the truth none of this would’ve happened. But even as he thought that he knew it wasn’t fair to blame everything on Sherlock. Greg did make his own decisions but he did it without knowing all of the facts but what Sherlock said was true. Molly’s father would never have gotten better if not for Greg’s wish. Still who was he to decide that Greg’s life was more important than Mr. Hooper’s?
“That’s what you’re here for isn’t it? Well you can take it and leave. After today, I’m done with you,” said Greg.
A witch appears at a really inconvenient place while John and Greg must rely on Irene or take matters into their own hands.
“Obviously it was to get John to make a contract. Without Sebastian, you have no chance of defeating Magnussen and John Watson is a selfless human being. So it is easy to conclude that removing Sebastian Moran would force him to make a contract with me.”
Later that night Sebastian found Sherlock watching Greg fight a witch down below from the building he was standing.
“And what would that be exactly?” “I know that you and Irene didn’t get along for whatever reason but Greg is my best mate and he’s a good person. He’s brave, kind hearted and will definitely help out someone who needs it. So I was hoping that with him you wouldn’t fight. If perhaps you would kind of look out for him too.”
This time he wasn’t going to rely on anyone anymore. No one would believe him about the future. No one would listen to the truth. Fine! Then he wasn’t going try to force them. He wasn’t going to depend on anyone else. Nobody could be counted on. Nobody.
“That’s the thing though, we don’t know him but there’s something.” John couldn’t deny that Sherlock was acting like a giant cock but behind the mysteriousness and aloof appearance there was something unmistakable. Sherlock really did care about what happened to him but he didn’t understand why. It didn’t help that the bastard never answered any of his questions and would just walk away like he’s Batman or something.
Greg with John’s help made it back safely to his house where he was left alone with Kyubey. Using a grief seed, Greg was able to clear the darkness that started to cloud his soul gem. One it was shining again he felt better. Laying down on his bed he tried to clear his mind from the whirlwind of a day he had.
“Just like that? You killed the person that meant the most to you?! John angrily asked while rising. “Does becoming a contractor make you immediately disregard people as human?”
“It doesn’t think it’s done anything wrong. Kyubey doesn’t understand human intricacies like you or me. The way it sees it, there was an equal trade. Molly’s father would never have gotten better and in exchange for a miracle, Greg traded his soul. Some would say that such a miracle is worth more than a human life.”
They both stood there looking at each other and before John could ask him what he was doing here Sherlock spoke.
There was a moment of silence as they continued to walk, making John feel like there was definitely still hope left.
“You should give me the grief seed. Since it’s absorbed darkness it can now hatch and become a witch,” said Kyubey.
Kyubey didn’t reply immediately but only stared the empty and appealingly harmless look he typically had.
Even as John spoke those words he knew that the wish wasn’t what was really bother him but it was knowing about the reality of magic and witches and the fact that they were out there hurting people. He felt responsible somehow knowing this. But he didn’t know what was a worthy wish. He had one chance to make a difference and it needed to be something that he wanted so bad, it was worth altering his entire being. To tear him out of his thoughts, was Sherlock who appeared before them. Greg immediately stood up becoming defensive of John and Kyubey.
“Jim this is Greg Lestrade, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,” she said pointing to each of them as she introduced them.
Greg didn’t wait for John after school again, and it took him sometime to finally catch up. He found him in the same alley way that he had fought Sebastian.
“It shouldn’t be up to them for us to continue. They messed up humanity and if it takes a couple million more years for humanity to get on track then that’s ok. We would have done it on our own eventually.”
“Let me put it to you this way, if you were impaled your body would go into shock, unable to move and you would die. However having a soul gem stops you from feeling the pain your body would typically feel. It does make a slight delayed reaction for other types of serious injuries like having a limb cut off so I don’t recommend it. How else do you think you survived your fight with Sebastian after the grievous injuries he inflicted on you? He’s clearly stronger than you and your healing factor wasn’t the only thing that helped you back up.”
After a little while longer, Molly came out of the room not speaking. It wasn’t until they left the hospital that Greg tried talking to her.
Far out of the two friends sight was Sebastian watching through a magically enhanced telescope. Standing on the roof of another building with Kyubey by his side.
“What do you think you’re doing? A familiar has to eat for of five people before it becomes a witch and then you can collect a grief seed. Don’t kill it before you can reap the rewards.”
I am so sorry, this isn't even that great of an update I should have posted this months ago. But I am posting both final chapters tonight.
“If you would use the grief seeds like a regular contractor then you would be fine,” said Sherlock whose face betrayed nothing of what he was actually thinking.
“Moran?” Sebastian held his soul gem in his hand and John could see that there was a curse growing inside of it just like Greg. “There’s been a small curse growing ever since Jim died and I know that no amount of grief seeds can prevent it anymore. So next time-“
Then ever so swiftly, Sebastian easily knocked Greg’s blade aside before hitting him with the butt of the musket smacking him straight into the wall. Greg quickly pushed off it, first making some distance between him and Sebastian and then rushing forward again. But before he could get even close, Sebastian with the greatest of ease shot off one bullet that passed straight through Greg’s abdomen. Greg immediately collapsed to the floor.
Even as he was working he continued to worry about Greg. He was trying to help Greg but he didn’t know what was going on with him. Did becoming a magical boy begin to make you an emotionally distant asshole? He was going to something drastic himself if Greg didn’t snap out of it. He’d be damned if he just let things go on as they were. Greg was a good person and his best friend who was usually the voice of reason. Now everything was just crazy.
It was as they were leaving the hospital, John spotted it. It looked very similar to a grief seed but it was attached to a column of the building and pulsing with energy.
“That’s not true!” John grabbed Sherlock’s arm drawing his entire attention to him. “I’ll remember you Sherlock. I will and how you saved us the other day. I promise I’ll never forget you!” Sherlock’s fist tightened.
“Yes, you two were in a labyrinth yesterday. It’s always some type of distorted reality that the witch hides in as to defend itself and disorient its victims. Are you sure you want to go in?”
Finally arriving to the same area John saw that several of the train cars were thrown off the tracks around Greg. His friend was on his knees holding his soul gem. Looking around it looked like Greg was at the epicenter of some sort of explosion with scorch marks of body outlines on the ground.
Sherlock only nodded, well he thought he nodded. There was a moment of silence as the sky was debating whether it wanted to continue raining after the storm Magnussen brought.
“Well this is the end!” Sebastian jeered with a twisted grin, holding the gun directly to Greg’s head. Greg could only look up in terror knowing he couldn’t heal fast enough to defend himself. Sebastian had put more magic to the point blank shot meaning Greg’s current wounds had a larger toll on him than the others. John watched in despair holding his breath.
Mike continued to walk, giving no acknowledgment towards John. He ran across the street until he was right in Mike’s way, stopping him from moving forward.
“I’m not one to really judge another person who I’ve never spoken to but I think I have to agree with Greg,” added Molly.
“Is there a reason why you needed me to come with you? You’re obviously not sick.”Sherlock didn’t respond and continued to walk at his brisk pace. Becoming frustrated John started to ask, “What is going-“
Greg didn’t know what to say but as they walked along the side walk he saw a tear escape her eye and that she was starting to cry. But Molly refused to stop or wipe away the small stream of tears that were falling and kept the same pace next to him. Even though Greg wanted to stop and hold her and reassure her it was okay to cry and that he was there for her, he thought it was better to pretend that he couldn’t see the tears.
“Why are you two just staring at each other?” asked Molly. “Did something happen last night after I left?”
“My family doesn’t care about me. The people that can at least live a little longer as a contractor can’t be tied down by anything else. They only make a wish when they have nothing else in life. You have a nice life, you’re still human and you have a future. There are people who care about you and who you care for. If you try to contact Kyubey, it won’t be Sherlock there to save you. It will be me but instead I’ll just kick your arse because by that point words clearly aren’t getting to you.”
“You did but there’s something called timing do you understand? There was no way they would’ve wanted to listen to me when he was fucking moping all over the place, that would have just led to another fight and I didn’t think that would make you happy. And I can’t just show up at your school because what if a fight broke out there too? Did you fucking think about that?”
John watched as a tense moment passed between the two. It was as if they were both sizing each other up and waiting for the other to attack first. It wasn’t until Sebastian relaxed his posture that the atmosphere settle.
“If I had told you, would you have honestly believed? I know what happens why you try to tell others, they don’t listen. Then even more people end up hurt.”
“Well I would like to believe you but I can never take a person who thinks space is a waste of time seriously.”
“It’s no joke. But fighting witches is very dangerous work so you want to think about if your wish is truly worth a lifetime of fighting witches. Kyubey thinks that you guys are up for the task and has deemed you worthy of a contract,” she responded, taking a sip of her tea.
“Yeah sorry I only sent you a text but I needed some time you know. Everyone is just the same and it’s like we’re in our own world.”
I absolutely love writing Sebastian. It's kind of harder for me to write Greg because I never want to do any injustice for him but because of how this story goes, I do have to put him through the wringer. Also I start to refer to Magical girls/boys more as contractors which sounds less ridiculous because there is no way to read that without it sounding super childish.
When he went to school he looked around the room and saw the same familiar expressions everyone had, he walked past Mrs. Hudson and went straight to John. John looked very flustered by the immediate attention he received from Sherlock.
“We don’t have to wish for anything. After all why should we change our lives so much to hunt these things that twenty four hours ago we didn’t even know existed?”
“But then that fucking satanic cat came along and fucked everything up.” Sebastian stood up in agitation. “Jim had always been frustrated with other people and found them too simple or boring because he was superior to them. If he wasn’t preoccupied with his work or with me he fell into some dark moods. His home life was shit too but I thought if he could just wait for me to go to uni then I could get part of my inheritance and I would take him with me. He was planning on going in early, he was definitely smart enough. But Kyubey came along and told us about the witches and the existence of magic. Well this brought a wonderful distraction that he was so curious about that he agreed to become a magical boy. It sounded like fun.” Sebastian gave a sad chuckle at the last sentence. “Well I thought so too. Fighting witches, gaining magic and I can have a wish too? It sounded perfect. So Jim on a whim no less, wished for a new kind of telescope while I wished for people to give Jim the respect he deserved. I wasted my wish on someone else.”
After the bandages went on, so carefully and gently, John pressed a kiss in to Sherlock’s sweaty curls.
Daddy takes out my boats to and they float around in the water, which sounds like a waterfall as it fills the tub. Daddy tests the temperature of the water with his hand then he helps me in and it’s soft and lovely
He pressed tissues down and let the bleeding stop. He counted the cuts. Fifteen of them, angry and red, carved into skin. The skin surrounding the cuts was hot and flushed red. He shook the arm, relishing the stinging. Clenched the hand before him into a fist, feeling it shake, feeling the deep ache. He set the blade down.
Sherlock just breathed. It was hard to even breathe. It felt like his body was someone else’s now. He was out of control.
Deciding where he would cut next was almost as calming as the cutting itself. His hands felt weak, his wrists achy. Squeezing them did not help. His hand flopped about weakly for a razor blade. Once he grasped his blades, the sensation went away. His hands were always steady when he cut.
The razor was cool against his arm. There was a sheen of dried blood on his skin and it made his razor feel like it was scraping against him. He took a breath and took another breath. He felt heady. It was so easy to imagine the blade sliding through his skin, just grazing at first, then—a rush of adrenaline as he willed himself to push through the pain, through instinct, summoning that perverseness inside him in order to keep pressing down, down,
“Oh this is about Sherlock. Well I’ll tell you what I know John Watson. You have the greatest potential I’ve ever seen to become a very powerful Magical Boy.”
“Really? I didn’t hear anything,” he said as his heart began to calm down. Rolling her eyes she gave a small sigh.
Irene landed on the ground with satisfaction after slaying another witch. This time they tracked it down to a park. Picking up the grief seed that was left behind she triumphantly walked towards John and Greg who had accompanied her on the hunt.
Inside the witch’s labyrinth John watched in fear as he saw Greg half-hazardly attack the witch. This time it appeared as some sort of multi-armed regenerating creature with multiple masks for each of its heads. John watched from a distance but something hurt inside each time another arm closed in around Greg, thrashing him around until he broke free cutting it off.
Other people in the restaurant became quiet staring at them. John calmed down waiting for the light chatter to pick up again. He was embarrassed by his sudden outburst. Sherlock however stayed composed.
“What do you mean you don’t know? Everyone has to make a fucking deal with you. There’s no way that someone can just gain this ability on their own.”
“Ah yes, Mr. Holmes. You can sit next to John Watson today, his partner is sick and he can introduce you to the topic we’re learning. Don’t think that because you just transferred I’ll be lenient with you. You’ll still have to keep up with the work I assign you from this day on,” said Mr. Anderson who Sherlock could tell was sleeping with the History teacher with the way he talked to her in the hallway and how she smelled of his deodorant.
Greg’s attention was diverted temporarily to John after the barrier burst apart when Sebastian was stunned. He could tell his leg were broken and that his skull was crack. He could feel blood trickle from his down his forehead. Smacking his hand against the ground he sent a powerful surge of magic to break through the floor of the labyrinth’s core room.
“What are you talking about? Are you threatening me?” John angrily questioned. He couldn’t understand what on earth Sherlock was getting at.
“You’re leaving me alone!” John’s eyes widened and he stopped struggling from Harry. “How do you think I’ve been feeling lately? Don’t you know that there are people that love and care for you? Please John, don’t make me lose you,”
John was thankful that Irene didn’t make any jokes and took the situation seriously and by the time they got back the egg still hadn’t hatched much to his relief. Irene was following Kyubey’s instruction as they were making their way past all the strange tents, trying not to cause a fuss in case it pushed the egg to hatch.
The thing was Kyubey hinted that maybe there was a way to turn Greg back. He didn’t know of one but that didn’t mean there wasn’t a way and if John made a contract he would definitely have enough magic to probably turn Greg back to a human. Maybe he should do it. Maybe he should call Kyubey back.
The witch had stopped moving but Greg was relentless in his onslaught. It was starting to rain as Sherlock and surprisingly Sebastian showed up just when the labyrinth and witch fell away. A grief seed was left behind and picking it up, Greg threw it at Sebastian.
“Because of the way that kid is and the way that I am, there would be no other alternative. He doesn’t want to hear what I have to say. I don’t know why you think if they hear my story that they’ll change their minds. Besides the way that kid is going he’ll die soon enough. You should’ve just let me kill him back then.”
“Not at all. I’m actually really happy that you want to come with me. Just having you by my side makes me feel even more confidant.”
“That’s true, he only recently arrived here and today was the first time we actually spoke,” added Irene.
“Yes there’s nothing I haven’t been able to grant,” answered Kyubey. “That’s why, John, Greg, I want you guys to make a contract with me and become magical boys!”
Sherlock ran over to him while Sebastian was beating off figures in prison uniforms who had no faces but had batons. They were slowly coming out of the cells and soon they would be surrounded.
“Is this what you’ve been trying so hard not to say? Why didn’t you say anything!? This is vital information that we needed to know.”
Taking a gun out from the silver disk, he shot at the witch making it quickly move away in an attempt to dodge the bullets. Sherlock went after it still firing. He landed on top of tight rope in the labyrinth’s distorted tent. The witch swiftly came down upon it and seemingly swallowed him whole.
Sebastian had quickly recovered from his initial shock turning around to see the interloper. Seeing the Magical Boy in purple, he began to grasp the situation. Looking past Sherlock he could see Greg beginning to heal from his high impact point blank shots. The healing ability certainly was useful but it probably still took up quite a bit of magic after using it so much in such a short time. Sebastian had used the fight to test exactly what kind of person Greg was and unfortunately he was exactly the wrong kind of person to be a contractor. He had planned to kill Greg but now he was much more interested in the irregularity. He couldn’t sense Sherlock at all, not only was he able to move Greg without him noticing but he did it fast enough so he wouldn’t get shot.
“I can’t be with anyone right now Greg and you know that I just don’t… my dad is dying and it would either a miracle or magic to save him and that’s not going to happen. So please stop trying to be cheerful with me, don’t you know that it’s only causing me even more pain?!”
Magnussen had brought the familiar maelstrom with him. Not needing to hide in a labyrinth it hung fearlessly in the sky destroying more and more of London with each passing moment. Even with stopping time and getting direct hits on him, still nothing worked.
John was mesmerized by the way Sebastian was talking. The nostalgia in his voice was beautiful and yet so painful.
“I just couldn’t go to school. I don’t know how I feel anymore after learning I’m no longer human. What am I supposed to do with that information?” he angrily replied but seeing John’s expression he tried to calm himself and not take it out on his best friend.
“I’m not saying you would do anything selfish but you should still be careful Greg. There are things you should still take care of.”
“After all that you’ve learned you still want to make a contract with kyubey? Why would you do that?!”
Every time he came here, the cannibal extended the same invitation. When he was younger, he had seen the appeal in this never-ending night, had been good friends with the cannibal. But now he placed a hand on hers and gently removed it. He shook his head at the cannibal and winked. She smiled and inclined her head. She understood his silence. He had been silent when he was younger, aching with pain, muteness stoppering his heart. Now, older, he had not spoken a word in two weeks. He would not now, in this pure, controlled, discreet place. He would not until he needed to be someone, until he needed to exist. He took the keys she held out and left expediently.
