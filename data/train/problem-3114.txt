Dean scooped up his bottle and took a long sip. Wiping his mouth on the back of his hand, he said, “Sorry, we got busy. You know, being adults and shit.”
Castiel nodded his agreement. He felt more stable in his relationship—and it was a big step for him to even call it a relationship—with Dean. He felt wanted and desired, even if it didn’t manifest itself how he wanted all the time. Dean stroked a hand through his hair, and Castiel fought back a shiver. No need to traumatize Sam with exactly how Dean’s affection for him did manifest.
"This is actually sort of hard if I can't turn your foot the way I need. Can you lay down?" Cas felt himself redden as he asked but he really was trying to keep this as innocent as possible. Dean's eyebrows jumped as he smirked, his eyes sparkling.
“Don’t give it up that easily, darling.” Bela cautioned, mischief flickering her expression between seriousness and mirth. “If you’re good at something, attach a price tag.”
“I am sorry.” Dean shifted uncomfortably. He probably wouldn’t scrub that off his conscience for some time. Great.
Thanks for reading! Just a question, but what do YOU think is in the envelope Dean's so worried about?
A man in a leather jacket bounced an eyebrow at Castiel while he was scanning the bar again. Castiel blinked at him, unsure of what such an attractive stranger was doing in a place like this, but looked away after a moment. He was supposed to be focused solely on Balthazar right now, it wouldn’t look good if another man came wandering over inquiring after Castiel’s interested gaze. Castiel resolutely looked towards the door. A man in a red shirt walked in. Castiel made to stand up and make himself seen, but the man immediately embraced a petite brunette near the pool table, forcing Castiel to take his seat once more.
—with the same demanding tone that its owner had. He spared it a glance, but let it ring through to voicemail. He rolled his eyes when his phone lit up again to let him know Missouri had also taken the liberty of sending him several text messages, just to make sure he knew she wanted his attention.
Cas shrugged. “I didn’t stay the full year. I don’t even have a yearbook.” The stipulations for Cas’s attendance of the cast party had been firm. Principal Adler made Cas swear that he understood he was only allowed to attend with the understanding that another teacher would be there to supervise in a professional capacity, and that he would hit the road afterwards and never return. Cas had told the kids, and while most of them were confused and appropriately sad about it, a few merely rolled their eyes. Safe to say, Cas hadn’t been there long enough to grow a devoted following.
Dean straightened up, tucking his gun away as quickly as he could without drawing too much attention to it. Guns in school never went over well, no matter who you were talking to.
The tension from the garage seemed to set low on Castiel’s mind the next week. He tried to be so good for Dean, being extra attentive when he got home from meetings, offering to wash him off nice and slow in the shower, and volunteering to keep him company while he went looking for a specific part for his car one sunny Sunday afternoon. That day had been well-spent, making out lazily in the back of Dean’s car on the side of the road twenty minutes outside the city’s north limit. Dean seemed to enjoy the time spent with him, but didn’t try to initiate anything too serious. Nothing that could involve using a safeword.
Panting, Castiel pulled off and dropped himself on the pillow next to Dean. Next to him, Dean wasn’t in much better shape. He looked like he’d just gotten hit with a freight train.
Cas’s head swam, there was so much pleasure and fire coursing through his entire body. He let his head hit the chair behind him as his body seized up, painting his stomach with white. He noticed Dean was still thrusting desperately against him and without thinking, he closed his fist around Dean’s cock once more. Dean dipped his head to rest against Cas’s shoulder, panting.
Dean gave him a helpless little smile and looked down at where their hands were twisting over themselves, clasping and unclasping. “Awesome.” He said quietly.
Dean swung the beam back towards the guy’s face, causing him to squint again. “You swear a lot for a high school teacher.”
“Salt is the rounds,” Dean explained, extending a hand to help Novak up. “Doesn’t kill ‘em, but it makes them fuck off for a while. You okay?”
He scrolled down to a new message from menage-a-douze35. Castiel supposed there was a joke or clever double entendre here, but he didn’t speak French. The man’s profile picture wasn’t much of a picture at all, just a closeup of what Castiel assumed was an impressive engine block. Castiel hadn't seen the inside of a car that wasn’t rusted within an inch of its life and its owner’s wallet in a very long time.
She took it and sat down at their tiny table, which was still two milk crates, stacked on top of each other. “Sorry, O Wise Male Escort. I had no idea I was rooming with the patron saint of self-esteem.”
“You’re here for Castiel Novak?” She sounded pleasant. Her green scrubs were only the slightest bit wrinkled, hinting at a long shift.
“That is sort of what I wanted to talk to you about, though, Kevin.” Cas started. He glanced at Dean. “I just wanted to get the full account from you of what happened… I know what was on the report, but—I would feel a lot better knowing what you saw.”
They continued like this, Cas murmuring the names of the bones and Dean listening attentively, asking questions occasionally. At one point, Cas noticed they were basically holding hands and he quickly moved his hand to Dean’s wrist. He ignored how cold his palm felt.
he’d been for the past few minutes. If Sam caught him, of course he’d blame it on the delirium of his wound, but he’d meant every word of it. Saying it all out loud, it was clear that while Castiel’s love for him had been the catalyst for the angel’s fall from grace, Dean had fallen just as hard.
“That sentiment really is quite profound, Dean,” Castiel asserts then. “No matter where Sam is, I’m willing to bet he thinks of you when he sees those patterns in the sky. That’s not a connection easily severed.”
When Dean stirs several hours later to the winter morning sun pouring into the room, he soon discovers that he is alone in the bed. At first, he begins to wonder if the night he remembers sharing with Cas was just a dream, if perhaps his traumatized brain had conjured the whole experience as a means of self-preservation from the pain of what he knows waits for him downstairs.
Pouting at being sent away, Dean relocates to the second-floor. He stretches out in the window seat with his caffeinated bribe, sipping in thoughtful consideration of the calm winter scenery. Directly ahead of the shop, across the road, is nothing but woodlands. Since the bakery is located at the very edge of downtown, Dean is relatively secluded from the other businesses. He’ll be the last one dug out by the snow plows, but he also gets to enjoy a view of nature on three of four sides. The minor inconvenience is a worthy trade-off for peace.
Hands now warmed from the kettle, Dean brushes the pads of his thumbs over the frown of fond exasperation at the corners of Cas’s mouth. “Careful, babe. You might get stuck that way.”
“Don’t.” Castiel stopped him, one hand reaching out to gently grab Dean’s wrist. “Don’t apologize. I want this. It’s better this way.”
He wasn’t sure why he expected to hear silence on the other end of the line; this wasn’t a prayer, after all. It shouldn’t have been a surprise to hear the ringer go off, but for some illogical reason, although this was exactly what he was waiting for, Dean wasn’t prepared for the voice to come through his speakers after the fifth ring.
“Well, happy birthday to me, I guess. My gift to myself is from you! You were right about me, about my motiv— motivations.” The furniture in the room was starting to blur and words were getting tougher to form, but this was important, even if the message died on his lips. “I just didn’t realize it. Or I was too chickenshit. I dunno. But
“It doesn’t matter.” Dean crosses his arms but hisses in pain when he accidentally presses too hard on his wounded hand. “It’s still my fault and now the opening’s gonna be set back who-knows-how-long while I’m stuck in insurance limbo. I’m such an idiot.”
“I would like that very much,” Cas replies without hesitation, his enthusiasm catching Dean off guard. By the look on Cas’s face, he must have surprised himself as well.
“Oh. The weather was nice, so I walked,” Dean says as if snapping out of his thoughts. He starts to turn. “Well, I’ll see ya around, Cas. Thanks for the invite.”
“Actually, you’d be doing me a big favor by taking the rest of this home.” Dean pulls tin foil from a drawer and tears off a large piece to wrap over the leftover pie.
“Heyyy, Caaaaas. Guess what today is!” Dean slurred as he flopped onto the pea-green couch in his bedroom, one hand on the phone and the other around a half-empty bottle. “I’ll give you
Given what they’re about to do, Dean grins at the unintended pun. “Yeah! Alright, Space Ranger. Lead the way.”
“Dean Winchester, that’s enough with the self-flagellation. Here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to show me where you keep your medical supplies so I can take care of whatever you’ve got going on with your hand. And then we are going to talk about this determination of yours to let the weight of the world drag you down.”
Refreshed after his breakfast, coffee, and a speedy shower (Cas said not to rush but he’s curious, sue him), Dean pulls on his boots and makes his way to the staircase, pausing at the top to listen to what sounds like a whole flock of people on the first floor, disembodied voices and the shuffling of feet reverberate up the stairwell. Bewildered, he clomps downstairs and is dumbstruck to find at least a dozen people engrossed in cleanup. He recognizes a few of them from the farmer’s market.
“As a sort of faculty meeting thing, or...?” Dean asks, and while he says it like it’s a joke, Cas can see a sort of
Oh, how he wanted to hear that voice again. He didn’t care if Castiel sat and prattled on about the migratory habits of marine mammals or the threatened existence of indigenous plants or the formation of sedimentary rocks. It would mean he was where he belonged, whole, more than a smear on Dean’s sleeve. But Castiel, fearsome and brave celestial warrior, loving and loyal companion, had been reduced to a violent sanguine stain and a hunter’s heartache.
Cas dips his head knowingly. “It’s not easy to start anew. I’ve been there. I’m very thankful for the support I had, even if most of my family is highly dysfunctional.” He takes another sip from his own cup, slower with his imbibing.
Cas swallows and licks his lips. He laughs at the exasperated look he gets in return. “Dean, this is heavenly. Your mother taught you well.”
Castiel holds the door open as Dean steps through followed by Gabriel with Jack. Castiel leans in as Gabriel passes. “You know you don’t have to abduct small children to feel taller, right? I’m sure you’ve got a pair of stilettos somewhere.”
“I’m gonna slick up my finger now.” Dean sounded as out of breath as Castiel felt. Dean took his fingers away and Castiel heard the pop of the lid on the lube. Dean’s touch was back now, cooler than before. He circled around Castiel’s hole before gently—ever so gently—pushing his index finger inside.
Castiel stopped to face him. “Dean, I’ve waited five months to put my hands down your pants again. Please don’t deny me any longer.”
“Cas?” Dean called into the silence. His heart rate kicked up when his own voice echoed back to him. He swung around. There weren’t a whole lot of places Cas could go, especially as injured as Dean feared he was. To the north was the door leading into the hallway between the stage and the choir room. To the left was a metal door leading out to the docks. Dean wasn’t sure Cas could push it open by himself, and if he did, the dock was a pretty sheer drop off.
Suddenly, the door to the costume room sprang open, carrying the voices of students across the room to the dark corner where they were tucked away among a rack of button downs and suit jackets that someone’s grandpa probably had rotting in their closet. Cas leaned back and took a steadying breath. He spared Dean a glance before turning to gather the hats. Three students came around the corner of the room with calls of “Mr. Novak!” and the usual chatter that came with high schoolers, excited about seeing their friends and director and socializing.
When Dean woke up, he had to blink a few times to get his bearings. He was sprawled across a side of Cas’s bed in his apartment. When they’d finally gotten enough collective brain cells scraped together to peel themselves off of each other—and the leather seats—and put their clothes back on, Cas had invited Dean back to his apartment for the night. It wasn’t like Cas had to be up early to get to school or anything, he’d reasoned. Dean had stuttered through an acceptance, and by the time he’d driven them both back to Cas’s building, he’d worked himself into a good and proper panic. They’d have to
“I don’t know,” he said honestly. “I don’t know if I can stay here. There’s nothing left for me here. But I don’t know what I'd do instead.”
“I don’t want to yell at you or call you names.” Dean spoke calmly and without much inflection at all. “I came to see if you were happy. I won’t try to get in the way of that anymore.” He turned the knob.
“Break my heart and tell me your date’s waiting for you out in the car.” He said, smile playing across his face as easily as the slight blush he could feel crowding up underneath his jaw. Play it cool, Winchester.
Castiel nodded slowly. “Yes, I wanted the focus to be on the mood, rather than the person himself. Sort of like a template.”
The grinding picked up, Dean was getting sloppy in his movements. Castiel opened his eyes and saw just how desperate Dean was, his expression probably a mirror of his own. They were both close, emotions too high to be anything but a hinderance to their lasting time. Castiel knew they could get a better angle, even for this dry humping that Castiel had absolutely never had so much fun doing before, but he didn’t want Dean’s heat to go anywhere that wasn’t draped all over him. Instead, he settled for pulling the hem of Dean’s shirt up, desperate to get to skin. He tugged it up until Dean got the message and pulled the scant millimeters away to throw it off and into a corner of the room. When he was bare from the waist up, Castiel clawed at his back, pulling Dean closer to him. Dean arched into the touch like some kind of cat, and attacked Castiel’s mouth with new fury. They were going so hard, the bed frame was squeaking, and the neighbors had to have heard something by now, but the only sounds Castiel could hear were the breathy gasps coming out of Dean’s mouth. Dean had always been vocal in bed, spouting enough dirty talk to curl Castiel’s toes, but he wasn’t one for errant noise. This was the sound of Dean being completely out of his own control, brought to the brink of desperation from absence, longing, and anticipation.
“Miss, you work for Mr. Winchester, don’t you?" Vivienne started, thrusting a microphone in her face.
Blinking at him, Dean looked up. He let out a sharp bark of laughter. “See, that’s why. You got a major attitude. S’cute.”
Dean pursed his lips and stared at the wheel. The car wasn’t running, but it was clear he hadn’t been sitting here long. “I shouldn’t ask this, but will you go for a drive with me?”
Dean considered. “We’ve seen his case before. Side effects of some tampered water. Probably municipal.”
Basically, Dean reasoned, he just had to look for the car. He hoped to whoever was listening that Castiel hadn’t sold the damn thing out of spite. It would make his search a lot harder… and far creepier than he intended. It wasn’t like he was going to call up the local fuzz and say Cas had stolen it. He wasn’t even going to try to get it back. It was a gift when it was given—no matter how it was received—and it was staying a gift. Dean wasn’t sure what he would do with it back in his garage again anyway. He just wanted to see. He wasn’t even really optimistic on talking now that he was here. He just needed to know Cas was okay.
Dean bit his lip, this was a bad idea. He can’t have really expected to just show up out of the blue—after months of radio silence—and walk away with a smile on his face. Life didn’t work like that, and it certainly didn’t work that way for Dean Winchester. He watched the guy hang back with Cas on the small concrete porch and chat for a bit. When he leaned in to plant one on Castiel, Dean had to look away, telling himself the hot tears he could feel pushing at his eyeballs was just because the heater was on too high. His grip on the steering wheel was turning his knuckles white. This was a bad idea, this was a terrible idea. He never should have listened to Sam, he should have kept on with his coping method of drinking and ignoring until he either drank away the memories or became an old man cooped up in his lakeside mansion. Would have been a hell of a lot easier than this. Three seconds and he had gone from elation at finding Cas after all this time to a sucking feeling deep in his chest.
“No—just… this is why I made a contract. I know it’s not legally binding or whatever, but this way… everyone knows what their getting up front. There’s no guessing, there's no wondering. He needed the money, and… I like him." Dean looked down at the table and fiddled with the label on his beer.
“Don’t call me that,” Dean said sharply, but immediately pressed an easy kiss to Castiel’s lips to soften his words. “Not now. I don’t—I don’t want to be that guy right now.”
He blinked open one eye, grimacing slightly at the way the late afternoon light was slanting in the window. He really had to do something about the windows in this place. The solid warmth behind him snuffled, ruffling the back of his hair, and tickling him in the process. A grin spread across his face.
Dean checked his watch. “You heading back home?” It was nearly midnight. Theirs was the only car in the lot. Adler must have parked in the visitor spots closer to the front door. Lazy fucker.
“Tomorrow,” he began, threateningly. “Tomorrow you will know your lines. We perform in a week, you guys.” He dismissed the students, who immediately went back to their phones and socializing while walking back to their things. For students who weren’t invested in the theatrical process, they sure were taking their sweet time getting
The wings seemed pretty standard, for all that Dean’s limited experience in high school theater’s allowed. Solid brick behind here leading into the shop. Dean tapped at the walls here and there. Nothing even hollow in the structure. He aimed the beam of his flashlight up towards the fly system. That was apparently where the kid saw a black figure right before a heavy piece of set dropped. The light system swung gently above him, with a metal catwalk attached. He didn’t know if there was a way for him to get up there, especially not being able to operate the fly system by himself. Shame he didn’t have Sam here with him. The kid would’ve known how to get him up there.
“She is like family. Pretty damn close anyway. She and my mom were really close before she died.” Dean didn't look at Castiel, but a muscle jumped minutely in his jaw.
The metal ladder Oswald had propped up against the catwalk was still there. They were lucky it hadn’t toppled to the ground amidst all the chaos. Dean got Cas positioned enough to start climbing down, even though Dean was pretty sure Cas’s leg was broken or near-broken. He’d have to rely on sliding down once he got close enough to the ground.
Bela’s eyebrow arched. “Oh, I do miss those days. Quite the cuddler, if memory serves. Not my cup of tea.”
“Remember to chew with your mouth closed, boy. You’ve got company.” Missouri said, raising an eyebrow. Dean stuck his tongue out at her childishly and got swatted for his trouble. Castiel smiled down at his plate when Dean nudged him playfully, tucking in eagerly.
Dean raised an eyebrow when Cas glanced back again. He’d been through this a dozen times. The vic had been told they were wrong or crazy so many times that stye started to believe it themselves. People didn’t trust their own eyes, their brains trying to explain what they couldn’t. Trying to protect itself.
, he felt Cas’s hands pulling him closer, really going for it now. “Fuck, Dean—!” Cas let loose a pained grunt and came.
Dean easily spotted James Carnes, five years older now, but with the same gap in his teeth. He stood in a row of eight other students, each of them bathed in the same antiquity of the old photograph. While James was fifteen in this picture, the students ranged in age from what Dean would bet were baby-faced freshmen to seniors on the cusp of graduation.
... yeah, let's just be real here. I'm on no one's update schedule anymore. That's okay, I have a chapter here and that's all that matters, right? I fear no one.
“You’re pretty handy.” At this, Dean looked up again and smirked. Cas blushed immediately to Dean’s private delight. “I mean, you seem pretty smart. You built that… electro—thingy.” Castiel waved his hand vaguely.
Dean grinned crookedly. He leaned forward and reached a hand around the back of Castiel’s head, immediately burying his fingers and smoothing up his scalp. Castiel felt tingles erupt in the path Dean’s hand left. He pulled Castiel in for a kiss, his tongue flicking out to flirt with Castiel’s bottom lip. He leaned back, leaving Castiel’s eyes to flutter for a second. Dean’s hand pulled his face towards Dean’s erection, the tip pearly with wetness. Castiel licked his lips, trying to work some moisture back into his suddenly-dry mouth.
All that was left on their bodies was the garter, Dean’s panties and the matching silver rings that adorned their left hands.
Dean got out of bed and walked to the duffel. He put on the second set of clothes he had packed, with Cas’ eyes watching him the whole time. After he was dressed, Dean began picking up their clothes from yesterday. He got to Cas’ trenchcoat and handed it to him.
Cas raked his eyes over Dean’s naked body. They locked on Dean’s cock, hard and straining against his stomach. Dean’s hands fisted against the sheets, his need evident. Cas dropped to the bed, a one knee falling between Dean’s legs. He felt Dean’s cock press into his hip.
He continued to gloat, looming over Sam and Dean, who began to make moves to stand. Chuck knocked them back down, a fist colliding with Dean’s face. Each time they tried to stand, he landed another blow. Bones break, blood pouring from wounds, the boys continue to get their feet under them again.
The agent smirked. “Alright then, guess we’ll just have to do a private pat down.” He led Dean to a small room just before the escalators to the rest of the airport. He opened the door and gestured to Dean to enter. “Have a seat, I’ll be right with you.”
As Dean and Benny journeyed through Purgatory, Cas stayed close behind. Dean never knew, never discovered that Cas trailed them. Each night, Dean fell to his knees, the same prayer falling off his lips. Benny never once questioned why Dean continued to pray to the angel who had deserted the man who walked beside him.
Cas nodded, eyes still fixed on Dean. Sam remained silent, fingers still clicking against the keys of his laptop.
He was totally thrown by the question but responded anyways. “It’s not cologne, it’s the after effects of working on cars.”
After starting a load of laundry, Dean found himself making dinner. It was easy to put something together with the ingredients they kept in the kitchen. As he cooked, he lost himself in thought.
With no time left, Dean needed to get his pie finished. He took a wild guess and put the cream cheese pineapple mixture on the bottom and the blueberry filling on top. In the final minute, he managed to smooth the blueberry filling out and make it look somewhat decent.
He looked around to see three nodding heads. They had all known the plan for weeks, and had been prepping for this day. Final preparations had been made, all the supplies they needed packed in the Impala.
“I’m cancelling your show. It’s over. Just like every other world I’ve destroyed.” He gestured to them and the men dropped to the dirt. “If you had just done what you were told, you wouldn’t be here now, wouldn’t be on your knees before me.
Sam often stayed behind, keeping information flowing to the hunters in the field. He camped out at the map table, laptop usually open. If a hunter called, he found the resources they needed and helped them get out safely. Eileen stuck by his side, slowly becoming an expert on the library and lore. It didn’t take long before matching silver rings appeared on their hands. Dean smiled every time he walked past them camped out at the map table, sitting side by side, with lore books spread across the table top. It reminded him that they were finally free to do what they wanted to do.
“I heard your prayer, and it was time to come home. Heaven is rebuilt and Jack has freed me from any obligations to Heaven.” Words came out so matter of fact, so emotionless that Dean wasn’t sure that it was really Cas standing in front of him.
Dean had no warning to Cas coming. He came hard and fast, Dean’s mouth still wrapped around his cock. Dean swallowed as Cas’ body shook, the tremors of his orgasms nearly knocking him off his feet. He let go with a soft pop, and stood. Cas leaned against him, body still shaking. Dean wasn’t expecting the kiss that came next.
Dean found his hands starting to shake. He turned the stove off rather than risk anything burning from being distracted by the conversation Cas was trying to have with him. He turned to face Cas, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed.
He groaned as he slid into the passenger seat, Cas turning the car on. The Impala started with ease and Cas began the drive.
Jack smiled faintly, and took the keys from Dean’s outstretched hand. He got in the driver’s seat while Dean slid into the passenger side. Seat belts clicked into place and Dean looked over to see Jack’s hands gripped tight on the steering wheel. “Just breath, it’ll come easy to you.”
The judges continued on their way, making comments on everyone’s danishes but Dean only half listened. He looked over to see Castiel’s danishes being judged. His eyes met Castiel’s and Dean smiled gently.
“Cas. I wish you were here. I wish I could see your face again, tell you what I never got the chance to say. You should be celebrating with us, ringing in the new year beside us. Jack, too, wherever he might be.” Dean’s words were a prayer, one that was similar to the prayer he said every night.
Cas hummed his approval as his hands settled on Dean’s hips, thumbs gently stroking the soft material he found there. He pressed his lips to Dean’s, relishing the feeling of the silk under his palms. Dean’s hands found their way to unbutton and unzip Cas’ pants, pushing them down. He used his hands on Cas’ hips to encourage him to step backwards, allowing both of them to leave their slacks behind on the floor. Cas’ erection rubbed against Dean’s through two sets of fabric but it wasn’t enough. Moaning, he slipped his hands under the waistband of Cas’ boxers, pushing them down Cas’ thighs, hands trailing softly. Cas got the message and stepped out of them as well.
“So, where are we at? Got a case, or a way to handle Chuck? Anything other than sitting in the bunker all day?”
“I need you to come for me Dean. Please.” Cas’ words were softer than Dean’s but they had the desired effect. Dean reached between their bodies and started jerking his cock. Dean could feel his orgasm building, and it only took a couple more strokes for him to come, coating his hand and their stomachs with his release. Cas continued to thrust into Dean, riding him through his orgasm. Cas was coming moments later, head dropping against Dean’s shoulder as his orgasm rocked through him.
Dean threw on the first pair of jeans he found, along with an old Zeppelin t-shirt. He padded out of his room and headed towards the main door of the bunker. He disarmed the door and pulled it open.
He left the room, presumably to find his laptop. Dean watched him go and then turned to Jack. “You did good, kid. I’m proud of you.”
The boxers slid down Cas’ legs, revealing his hard dick. Dean leaned forward, kissing the tip. Cas made an ungodly sound, hands reaching out to grasp Dean’s shoulders. Dean took his cock into his mouth, sucking gently. One hand gripped the base while the other went to his balls. Cas threw his head back, moaning.
Both Dean and Cas turned to face Sam as he began to explain what he had found. The two of them listened intently, hanging on every word that came out of Sam’s mouth. They all agreed that the plan, despite how crazy it sounded could work.
Cas was tackled by two of them. His fighting skills had drastically improved since he started hunting regularly with Dean but the two vampires overpowered him and knocked him to the ground. He struggled to throw them off but succeeded and was able to behead them.
The emotions that Cas could hear, the pain he felt through the prayer. It crashed through Castiel like a tidal wave. He wished he could bridge the gap that separated himself physically from Dean. He wished he could pull Dean close and tell him that it would be alright at the end of the day, that they would find their way out of Purgatory together.
At that moment, Jack walked into the kitchen. “PANCAKES! Thanks Dean!” He took the seat next to Sam, eagerly reaching for the hot pancakes Dean had just finished. Jack dumped syrup all over them and started to shovel them in his mouth. “Your pancakes are the best,” he said with his mouth full.
“Woah, time for what boys? You haven’t said anything about your plans to take on Dad.” Eyes wide, his gaze met Jack’s glowing amber eyes.
Dean doesn’t recognize the person I’ve become in this mission… this hunting of God. I saw it on his face the moment he saw me. Knowing him has changed me, more than I can ever tell him. The thought lingered heavily in his mind as he showered and redressed. The stress of the recent weeks had been wearing him down, causing him to act like the angel he was before he raised Dean from perdition. That angel, the one who commanded a garrison, that angel wouldn’t have batted an eye at harming humanity. Sighing, Cas leaves the small bedroom to drop his clothes in the laundry room and rejoin Dean and the others.
Dean grabbed his knees, drawing his legs towards his chest to give Cas better access. Cas poured more lube onto his hand and pumped his own cock a few times, coating it. He lined the head up to the entrance of Dean’s ass and leaned forward to kiss him. He used his lips as a distraction as the tip of his cock pressed into Dean.
Dean kneeled before Cas, hands on his hips. “They look good on you, but they are going to look better on the floor.”
Jack spent most of his days wandering, sometimes leaving the bunker for days at a time. He never spoke about what he did when he left, although Dean and Cas often theorized that he was visiting people who prayed to him. They had heard of a few miracles but never asked Jack. It seemed he wanted privacy and they gave it to him.
He emerged a while later, skin pink from the heat of the shower and scrubbing, with a towel wrapped around his waist. The tiny shoebox in the back of the closet was calling to him and Dean opened the door to pull out the box. He opened it and removed the worn pink panties. The towel fell to the floor and Dean stepped into the panties. He relished in the feeling of the satin sliding over his legs. He pulled them up and settled them on his hips, adjusting his dick until it was sitting comfortably. Dean finished getting dressed, sighing as he went back to pick up his kelpie covered clothes from the bathroom to wash.
The stranger was still looking at him, a tinge of amusement coloring his handsome features now that he had Castiel’s attention again. He didn’t seem to be with anyone, just sitting at a table by himself, enjoying the noise and atmosphere of the bar. He seemed to fit without fitting in at all. He had the biker boots and jacket of anyone else here, but he looked different. Softer, somehow. Like this was a costume he was wearing for the day, while looking completely at home where he sat.
Balthazar had sighed, clearly growing impatient and losing his mask of cool. “Saying you have the money isn’t going to convince the financial aid department, Castle—“
Castiel was in a bad way. He hadn’t slept well last night, he was at the apartment because Dean had been on a business trip the last three days, he’d had a line of rude customers at the bookstore all looking for some new pseudo-medicinal healer lady’s latest title—seriously,
Castiel planted his elbows on the table and rubbed the bridge of his nose tiredly. “Mr. Winchester—“
“They’re kicking me out.” He said tonelessly. He was dimly aware of the fact that his pants were still hanging open. Dean had zipped himself back up, apparently not hard anymore. Figures. Castiel managed to fuck this up once again.
Dean cleared his throat. “Right, uh. Don’t mind me. I’ll just… I got some work to do back here, so just—just carry on.”
Cas appeared in the doorway a short time later, followed by Amelia in her coat. Dean darted up to where Cas was standing and leaned in, helping him down the stairs and to their car. Cas might be getting good with his crutches on flat surfaces, but Dean wasn’t taking any chances on inclines. Dean was determined that he and Cas would take it easy for probably the first time in their lives.
Dean didn’t have long to gloat. On the far side of the auditorium, a blob of screaming silver fizzled into existence near what he assumed was a light or sound booth above the doors. He heard Castiel gasp behind him.
Kevin nodded. “It looked like him. It didn’t… sound like him though, he sounded—weird, I guess. Not like himself. And—he changed… somehow.”
Dean had instructed Castiel to keep a lookout at the fire escape entrance. Better for him to have a head start should they have to leave in a hurry. Dean didn’t want to feel guilty about getting Cas arrested for trespassing on top of everything else. He pulled a flashlight out and swept through the remaining rooms. He wasn’t exactly sure what he was looking for—probably on the lookout for cold spots or weird smells more than anything—but he gave each room a cursory once over.
“Probably. Maybe in Adler’s office? He keeps a lot of data in there.” Castiel followed Dean back to where the Impala was parked around the corner. He stood across from Dean, but didn’t get in.
Before Dean could pass, very aware of the two thick folders pressed up against his torso, Adler stopped him with a hand to the shoulder. “And John... Smith, wasn’t it?”
“Can I kiss you and show you how it’s done? I’ll be gentle, I promise.” Castiel felt himself nod and his tongue snaked out to wet his lips. Dean tracked the motion and leaned in ever so slowly, giving Castiel all the time to refuse him. Warmth spread through Castiel’s body at the thought of  being connected with Dean’s once again, his mouth opening when Dean’s tongue traced against the curve of his bottom lip. This was easy. This was good. Kissing Dean was the easiest and best thing in the world and Castiel tried to follow his mouth when he pulled away minutely. A big, warm palm slid up his chest and up over his throat, pushing him back a little. Dean’s hand pressed right over his Adam’s apple, causing his breath to hitch a little. Dean’s mouth sought out his again, keeping his kisses light and undemanding. Castiel felt a little more pressure against his throat, enough where he heard a hollow sound when he tried to breathe. Panic flooded his system, making him jerk under Dean’s hands. Carefully, Dean pressed forward and kissed him again and Castiel couldn't find it within himself to fight. He melted into it, moaning softly when he started feeling slightly dizzy. He pressed forward against Dean’s palm but before he knew it, Dean had backed off and his hand was removed from Castiel’s throat. Muggy stars swam in his vision until it cleared and he coughed slightly.
me.” Cas shot back. “You don’t get it, maybe it doesn’t mean much to you, but they outright fired me. And for breaking and entering school property, damaging equipment, and whatever else Adler wants to pin on me.” He slumped further down in the passenger seat. “He might be a jackass, but he’s got a lot of power.”
Sighing, he threw back the last of his coffee. Cas shook the crumbs off of his fingers and licked his lips in a way that made Dean look away quickly. “Should we tell Mrs. Tran we’ll be at the hospital today?”
“Well, I’m sorry you drove all this way, but I’ve moved past it.” Dean looked up, his expression clearly wounded. Castiel was lying through his teeth, and he knew it, but he couldn’t let himself be weak to this man again.
it was under the football field. Dean had to admit, it wasn’t that surprising though. The field had a near perfect circle of dead grass that was nearly a perfect giveaway. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t noticed before.
“We won’t be too long,” Cas promised. “Just a quick visit.” He turned to go, but Melody stopped him with a manicured hand on his arm.
He shuffled forward on his knees, running his hands up Cas’s slacks until he got to his fly. “Please, Cas,” he whispered. He reached in between the flaps of his pants and stroked him gently through the navy boxers underneath. Cas’s cock was hot and so,
He squinted at the last character for several seconds before realizing it was a heart. He sighed. When did he get so old?
“Do it again. Lemme feel you.” Castiel murmured back, his hands untwisting from Dean’s hair and sliding down to his hips. They were both still clothed, and if Castiel had his way, he’d take his damn time unwrapping his present in front of him. He slid his hands into Dean’s back pockets, grabbing himself a generous handhold and forcing Dean’s hips forward to grind into himself. Dean grunted in response and anchored his arms on either side of Castiel’s head. He pushed himself against Castiel in a clothed mimicry of what they both wanted desperately. Castiel cried out at the pressure against his cock and held on desperately.
Dean rolled his eyes, but kept his mouth shut as Cas shoved the door open and shouldered his way into the cramped space. Dean followed and promptly tripped over an umbrella stand filled with various canes and walking sticks. The room where Dean found himself now seemed to be a dumping ground for every kind of coat, skirt, and blouse from the past seventy years. The rack of hats and handbags along the far wall seemed to go back even further in time. Here and there were piles of everyday objects: a bucket filled with fake food and pastries; a shelf with no less than fifteen different types of phones; a dozen kinds of eyeglasses.
At the counter, the bored-looking girl with shockingly bright purple hair managed to only gape a little as Dean whipped out his card for the staggering amount displayed on the till. Afterwards, he filled his hands with the bags that Castiel did not immediately grab and gave the girl a wink as they left. They started back down the street to the garage where Dean had parked his car, a Chevy Impala, he had told Castiel.
Dean stood and made his way over to the open hole where a pile of bones lay in the dirt. There wasn’t much left of the guy, but enough to burn. He looked around and spotted his Zippo and small bottle of lighter fluid lying a few feet away. He fumbled it from the ground, grimacing as his ankle twinged uncomfortably—probably not broken, thankfully—and gingerly made his way back to the hole. He doused the remains in lighter fluid before pulling a crumpled bit of paper out of his pocket. He lit it on fire, and dropped it into the hole, lighter fluid covering the bones in flames quickly.
“Well, that’s a shame. My buddy, Castiel here, promised me a ghost. Seemed like an interesting town to settle with a bonafide ghost in the works.”
“Look, I’m not saying you didn’t do the right thing by being honest with him, but it just sounds like maybe you didn’t like him all that much in the first place if you’re able to be so casual about it.”
Twisting the program in his hands, over and over, Dean was sure he was freaking out the people around him. Sure he looked like some weird creeper after their kids. They couldn’t know he was after the director.
True, Castiel had never gone much farther with a john past sucking their dick, but hey—he had only really been in the game for a few months now. He was prepared for what he had to do. Or at least… he thought so.
“What does that mean?” Castiel asked, hovering close to his elbow. “Are all those lights important?”
“Next question is where are we going to burn these? We definitely can’t do it on school grounds again, and I know the motel won’t appreciate some weirdo burning hats in the parking lot.”
“Where did you go? You were going to that bar down South, did you meet up with that guy from the site?”
“You don’t know how weirdly glad it makes me feel that I wasn’t the only one. Never wanted to wake up.” Dean said with a smile.
Castiel fought a shudder and waved a hand. “Maybe some other time. I’ve got places to be.” He turned again and hustled as fast as he could without running to the street corner.
Grinning, Sam stood and moved across the floor to wrap his arms around her from behind. “I love you, but I don’t think I want to see that bedroom anymore than we have been.” It had been a long and hard (heh) road trying to conceive. Of course, it hadn’t been for lack of trying, and the doctor’s advice was to just be patient and let nature take its course. Sarah and Sam were both healthy adults with completely normal levels of hormones. To Sam, it felt like they’d been trying for ages.
The nurse checked her wrist. “Nearly eight. He slept well and everything?” She lifted the bandage over one of the cuts near his eye and clucked disapprovingly.
On stage, the set was lit differently than Dean had ever seen it. There was what looked like a castle near the back of the stage, but it was built of what Dean thought were packing peanuts, painted to look like stones. Other fake rocks littered the stage here and there, but with the purple stage lights, Dean couldn’t decide if the play was supposed to be set on Mars or somewhere on Earth. The kids in their costumes weren’t really helping either. Most of them were in some strange tunic-type clothing, with stupid looking shoes. Dean hadn’t paid attention to the posters coming in, or even the program in his hands.
Dean pulled away with kiss-bitten lips and his clothing rumpled. He looked like he’d just been hit over the head. “Cas, I never want to leave you.”
“Okay.” Castiel wasn’t sure if he was disappointed or not. He tried to settle back into Dean’s warmth. He wanted to focus on the show, because Dean was clearly into it, but instead, he was hyper aware of the feel of Dean’s skin along his bare shoulders. The amount of heat that he put off was astounding on a normal occasion, but surrounded like this, even as casual as it was, made Castiel’s blood run a little bit faster.
“Can we promise not to do it drunk this time, though?” Cas pulled away again, not going far. His gaze was roving all over Dean’s face, and Dean was nearly cross-eyed trying to look at him. “Not that you’re not fun to drink with, but I’d much rather not have to work through a headache the morning after again.”
Castiel rubbed his hands across Dean’s chest and down his shoulders to his biceps. “That was a bonus, but I really do need to see Anna, the rent’s due today.”
It was Cas’s turn to narrow his eyes. “You don’t know the half of it,” he muttered conspiratorially.
Shimmying down, Cas dropped to his knees in front of Dean. With a hand on each knee, he parted Dean’s legs, making room for himself there. Dean struggled against the instinct to close his legs, feeling a little too exposed. He knew he was watching Cas with a dopey, drugged expression, his mouth partly open and his breath coming in puffs. Cas looked up at him and licked his lips. “Can I suck you off?”
Cas shook his head. “Doubtful that he’ll keep up the position that long. He wasn’t really that invested in it already.”
Kevin paused, looking down at his hands. “I think I told the police and the doctors something pretty weird, Mr. Novak. They all asked me a dozen times if I had hit my head.” He snorted. “I mean, I’m sure I
“Shit, fuck.” Dean’s strong hands suddenly clamped down on Castiel’s back, telling him wordlessly to jump. When he did, Dean grabbed his thighs tight, pulling Castiel into a rough kiss. Castiel carded his hands through Dean’s hair, pulling his head back to suck at Dean’s throat. Dean walked them over to the gray couch, depositing Castiel securely on the middle cushion.
Castiel balked. “When you put it like that, it sounds… dirty.” He had no illusions as to the perceived morality of what he did, but usually the buyer of his services didn’t make it sound so blunt.
Castiel smirked, and tilted his head. “I was gone like two hours.” But if he was being honest with himself, he missed Dean too.
Castiel was struck by the moment in its surrealism. The clock Castiel hated and Anna loved ticked too loudly on the wall above the sink, which was dripping steadily. The lightbulb above them buzzed occasionally, and the couch had tatters on one corner where its previous owner had clearly had a cat. He was sitting in the middle of the most possessions he had ever owned in his entire life, and also in this space was the man that haunted Castiel’s dreams for months. He wished desperately he could read Dean’s mind, and get some idea of his angle here. What did he want, and why was it so important he was at Castiel’s door in the middle of the night? He found he had less idea of what to say to him than when they first met and Castiel was just trying to get rent money out of a potential john. He wanted to ask every single question in his head at once.
Castiel purses his lips into a frown. He knows Dean is stubborn. That much is clear from the way he’d walked into Castiel’s life and refused to leave. The way he can’t ignore someone in need. The way he puts his all into his work and gives and gives and gives of himself for those he loves.
“Don’t apologize.” Dean holds up a placating hand, choosing his next words carefully. “I’m glad you felt comfortable enough to share that with me.”
“For those of you who’ve been here before, you know the drill. But, I see a few newcomers out here, so I’ll go over how it all works,” Gabriel says, gaze shifting to Dean mischievously. “This box here…” He holds up a small cardboard box. “...has a list of activities for us to perform. It might be a game, a song, a dance, or who knows what! I’ll draw from it at random, then call people up to the stage and explain the rules of the particular exercise.”
Cas is unperturbed. “I’ll get it,” he interrupts with an impish wink, handing Dean the coffee cup when he sits up. “Drink this. I hear it cures monosyllabism.”
Dean finds himself wanting to lean into the touch. He wishes that, for once, Cas might move the hand from his shoulder to his cheek or card those dexterous fingers through his hair. He can feel it sharply now, like so many times before: the fragile precipice on which they stand. Just a few words. Just one short motion. That’s all it would take to shatter this illusory barrier they’ve built between them, bricks of self-control sealed with a mortar of sinking sand.
On a sunny autumn afternoon, Dean pulls the Impala into a parking spot at the neighborhood craft and farmer’s market. He hops out of the car and takes in the sight of all the colorful booths and people milling about. A light breeze rustles his jacket and he breathes deeply, uncharacteristic optimism filling his chest as he strolls into the bustle of patrons. He passes vendors selling jewelry, vegetables, paintings, and flowers. At one booth, he stops to pick up several jars of apple preserves and a large bottle of ground nutmeg.
When they finally break apart, both breathing a bit heavier, Dean sighs. “Man, you’re makin’ me wanna call off the opening just so you can have your way with me upstairs.”
“Where did you learn to do that?” Castiel isn’t sure he wants to know the answer, but he can’t help asking. He’s never seen anyone fight like it came so naturally.
Dean didn’t even pull away as he replied, fist still full of beige fabric and voice barely a whisper, “Ain’t no mountain high enough, Cas.” He found himself wanting to bury his face in the heat of Castiel’s neck, to inhale his scent and be held, clinging to the vitality of the angel’s heartbeat.
The baby nods, and it’s like a switch is thrown. Some dormant but deeply ingrained part of Dean comes back online and he steps out of the car, walking to the passenger side where he pulls the boy from Cas’s offering hands and settles him against one hip. Dean peers around. The last thing they need right now is a nosy neighbor spotting the unusual trio. “You feel warm, but it’s chilly out here. Let’s get you inside.”
Dean’s face falls and he kicks himself for being so naive, but he clamps his teeth together, replacing the disappointment with irritation.
Dean shakes out his limbs before the first instruction and suddenly it’s time to go. He deftly taps his right foot out so that his toes touch the ground, then crosses that leg in front of the other. The action is mirrored on the other side, propelling him forward. The moves are repeated with the intention of each row getting to the other side.
“Dean. Allow me,” Cas says, sliding a hand into the small denim square on the front of Dean’s jeans. In one smooth motion, he retrieves the card and turns to swipe it through the reader. The move is so intimate, so familiar that Dean fights a blush threatening to overtake him from scalp to shoulders. Either Cas is as oblivious as ever, or he
Castiel feels his face flush but channels a bit of Gabriel’s boldness, though he thinks he couldn’t flirt to save his life. He only hopes he comes across more confident than he is. “If you think that’s smooth, you should see me with the lads.”
to stay. Mouth dry, Dean averts his eyes and picks up the tray of dishes. He heads down the stairs and into the kitchen, Cas following close behind, and adds the dessert dishes to the soak pile in the sink.
“Woah.” Gabriel crosses his arms and leans back against the sink. “Sounds like a lot of work for a four-year-old he’s never met.”
Dean leans forward, hands on his knees. “What do you think, Jack? Do you feel like a spaceman in that suit?”
Gabriel holds the box in the crook of his elbow and rubs his hands together eagerly. “Okay! Who’s ready to roll?”
Sam, to his credit, stows any surprise he might be harboring and flashes a blinding smile. Dean lets out the tension he didn’t realize he’d been holding as Sam extends a hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Castiel.”
Maybe Castiel didn’t feel the same now that he’d returned. What if Dean had misunderstood his meaning as romantic when it had been meant platonically, more familial? It wasn’t like he hadn’t told Dean he’d loved him in the past. At the end of the day, Castiel would always be an angel. An otherworldly being. Just because he’d made human connections and used human terms didn’t mean he interpreted them the same way. Didn’t mean he experienced love the same way.
“Don’t laugh,” he warned, “but the name of the play is supposed to be curse on the theater if you say it out loud.”
Anna rolled her eyes. "Just know that I'm actually a southpaw, so you got off easy." She grinned feral when Winchester winced.
Castiel nodded stiffly and waved, getting into the seat. Anna slid in beside him and buckled up. She glanced over and smiled at Castiel as he started up the engine. Here, away from the garage, he had a second to appreciate the pleasant rumbling sound as it turned over. He pulled out of the space, sparing one last glance at Randy inside, before waving to Jo and peeling out of the lot and back onto I-80 Westbound.
The stage and shop were a mess. Splintered timber was everywhere, the floor was cracked in multiple places. A can of blue paint had been spilled in the back corner, staining a counter and part of the floor bright cobalt.
“I’m the artist, we do that.” Castiel gasped back. He was so close, he was getting desperate. Desperate to have something fill him where he was aching, desperate to make Dean cry out like he had in the bed for their first real time when they got back from Kansas. He went down on Dean’s middle finger again, the tip bumping the back of his throat. He sucked as hard as he could when Dean’s big hand slipped across Castiel’s ass and played lightly over his hole again. It was enough to send him over the edge, and he pressed as close as he could, feeling Dean crawl out of his skin with need as well. Dean ripped his hand away from Castiel’s mouth as he crested, replacing it with his tongue. He clutched Castiel closer, hugging him tightly to his chest as their cocks spurted together between them.
The two men went back to their conversation. The one on the left had a John Deere hat with about thirty years on use pounded into the fabric. His white beard was only slightly less impressive than the full mustache of his buddy sitting opposite him. Dean took his sandwich and a bottle of Sprite up to the front, snagging some Fritos on the way back to the register. The clerk greeted him with a few missing teeth and a friendly smile.
Dean was hesitating, trying to talk himself out of it. Castiel used his position pressed to Dean to rub up against him, getting an erection rather quickly with Dean’s scent and warmth all around him. Dean must have felt it, because he groaned quietly, his own pants getting a bit tight. “Cas, I really think this is a bad idea—“
“You just couldn’t disappoint your kids. The show must go on, and all that.” Dean snagged an overripe banana from the counter and peeled it, stuffing it in his mouth. “Drama dork ‘til the end.”
Instead, Dean settled for resting his forehead on Castiel’s. “God, this is like an upright lap dance.” Castiel could feel how much this was doing it for Dean, the evidence was hot and hard against his hip. He grinned against Dean’s cheek.
Grinning, Cas grabbed his hand again. Dean liked the warmth and how his palm felt against his. “Then I have one stipulation for you.”
“W-where are we? How—!” Cas’s gaze was wild, skating all over the place. He clearly had no idea how he got to the top of the catwalk. Dean tried to keep an eye on the spirit as he was advancing, while making sure Cas didn’t accidentally throw himself to the ground thirty feet below after all the work Dean did getting him out of that fucker.
… but he didn’t get it. Dean changed course to put his lips by Castiel’s ear. When he spoke, his lips brushed Castiel’s lobe, making him shiver. “I’m going to watch the news in my room, and I’d like you to join me.”
Castiel swiped at his face, knowing he was getting paint everywhere. Just what he needed, for Dean to think he had to take care of Castiel again, because Castiel was a stupid child way in over his head. Dean pulled his hands away, reaching back to grab a clean cloth from the workbench that Castiel hadn’t noticed before. Dabbing under his eyes, Dean cleared away the salt and the paint.
described the latest string of freak accidents around the school as “unusual” and “under open investigation” which meant the local sheriff had absolutely no idea what was really going on and no clue where to even start. Luckily, Dad had caught wind of it and sent Dean to take a look around. It was nice, working. Kept his mind off other things.
Castiel felt his stomach rumble and he put his hand to it. He had twenty bucks in his pocket, technically, he wasn’t as broke as he was an hour ago. He could stop at the McDonald’s he knew was at the next intersection if he really wanted to. He considered it briefly before shaking his head. He had eaten that morning and he had more pressing debts in his future than what a cheeseburger could rectify.
Castiel visibly paled, and Dean tried not to smirk too obviously. “Not quite the high-tech operation you thought it would be, eh?”
Just another thing to add to his already awesome day. He dug a plastic measuring cup deep into the crock of flour, white with delicate blue printing. A gift from John to Mary in their first house, almost laughable in its simplicity in their estate. John was the newcomer to the wealth and scrutiny; a poor soldier returned to the Kansas countryside after the war, trying to make an honest living at the garage. Mary’s family was ridiculously wealthy, on vacation through the Midwest from her native New York state. They met and fell in love on the same hot July day. John was swept up into her world and family—mistrusting at first at his intentions, but warming up after a while after he’d proved his loyalty to Mary.
“That’s… nice.” He finally spat out. Cas glanced around and spotted Kevin’s room. A large brass 14 hung slightly crookedly, like it had been bumped but no one had noticed enough to right it. Hand on the pump handle, Cas looked back.
He didn’t want to admit it, but that stung more than anything had in a while. He knew he was fooling himself, playing house like this. He knew it wasn’t going to last, but he had been enjoying it while it lasted.
“You’re fired, Novak!” Adler looked positively gleeful now in his rage. “I see now that hiring you was a grave mistake on my part. Vacate the premises immediately, or I’ll—“
Now that they had direction, Dean found it much easier to pack for the job ahead. Dean ditched the jumpsuit, opting for his usual jeans and flannel. He didn’t bring much gear, just his lock picking set and a flashlight. He always had a few weapons tucked away in various spots on his person, nothing too dangerous, but enough to get him out of a bind. Castiel had shown up in a black sweatshirt and dark jeans like some kind of cat burglar and Dean had only barely kept from rolling his eyes. Together, the two of them had quite easily gotten past the front doors. Dean had to admit it was a lot easier getting his information when you could waltz right in.
“He’s a john, Castiel. I have clients at the club that keep coming back, specifically to watch me dance. And they tip well enough, fine. But at the end of the day, that’s all they are, clients.”
Snorting, Cas scooped up the last on his pasta. “Come on, everyone we know that’d be even sort of willing to put with me are already married, have kids, or both.”
Raising an eyebrow, Dean responded with the same coolness. Clearly nothing had changed since the wee hours of this morning. “Awesome. So, is everything… okay?”
Dean wasn’t even saying anything, he just happened to catch Castiel’s eye whenever he looked up and shot him that devastatingly handsome smile that would put Castiel off for several seconds.
“You know more anatomy than you think. Not bad, for an engineering major.” He replied. Dean stuck out his tongue. As he moved slowly over Dean's chest, fingers wandering over the rayed star-sun tattoo over his heart, he heard Dean’s breathing pick up slightly. He tried to ignore the way the skin beneath his fingers seemed to be heating up.
From there, Castiel’s awareness focused on bits and pieces of the experience, too caught up in the heady lust between the two of them to stay tuned in for long. Dean’s tongue swiping across his chest, his own hand pressed to the sheets by Dean’s strong fingers, thrusting upwards into Dean’s heat and hearing both of their breathing stutter.
Breakfast ended with Missouri fretting about the state of greenhouse faucet—“Bobby, it won’t stop doing that thing and you’ve fixed it about four times!”—while clearing everyone’s dishes, except Dean’s. Castiel moved to help at the sink, but was grabbed by Dean and pulled to safety before Missouri’s hand could swat his for trying.
Oh, right. Balthazar. “No… there was someone else. Anna, he’s—he’s great. He’s funny and charming, and he’s got these green eyes that—“
Cas smiled. “Would you believe we have more in cages underneath the shop? This room wouldn’t even hold half of the furniture we have.” He glanced around and sighed. “I’m not sure how to find something that would have belonged to a spooky theater director with a vengeance, though.”
“Lived here my whole life. My folks used to own the grocery store, back when this was still a hotel actually. Met my sweetheart, Geraldine, in high school.” He toyed with a thick silver band on his finger. “We’ve stayed here ever since. Nice town. Good people.”
Dean pulled away from the base of his shaft and pressed the vibrating fingertip lightly into the head of his cock again, just below the slit. Castiel threw his head back and groaned, smacking his head on the headboard. Immediately, Dean’s hand was there, rubbing softly to dispel the stars that cropped up from the collision.
While the blush on Cas's face as died down some as he got back into his work, it came back in full force when he got close to Dean's nipple.
Castiel scrambled out of the car to follow, hurrying to push the lock button on the keys. “I’m not—why did you call me that? … wait up!”
Dean blinked, confused again. “I am sorry, Cas. You have no idea how sorry I am that I put you in harm’s way. I’ll settle up with the gal at the desk. This won’t cost you anything—“
Like lightning, Dean wrapped a hand around Castiel’s cock and laid a kiss on his mouth that made the room spin. For all that Castiel was feeling smug about making Dean come quickly, it had nothing on the minuscule time that Dean had Castiel spurting in his hand. Castiel blamed it on getting so worked up by watching Dean.
“The kids were on me for ages about that. ‘Mr. Novak, if we don’t keep the light on, the ghosts will curse our show!’ ‘You have to respect the superstitions, Mr. Novak!’ “ Dean gathered the high-pitched voice was a poor impression of high school students.
It wasn’t that Dean was ever ungrateful for all his parents had given him, even posthumously. But between the legal battles with his grandfather, aunts, uncles, and cousins, and the overbearing pressure to go into the same destructive work as his father after his death when Dean was twenty, Dean was more than ready to slap a big sign over the Winchester family account that said “Use For Scholarships” and set up a trust account that he didn’t have to touch ever again. Instead, he took his degree, still from one of the best institutions in the country, and set out to make his own name.
“Come to join me?” He glanced over his shoulder, popping the lid on a bottle of shampoo. He turned and motioned for Dean to do the same so his back was to Cas.
“Sure I still can’t get you under my sheets?” Dean replied in the same tone, eyes sparkling from across the garage.
In turn, Castiel learned that Trevor had loved the water so much as a child that he spent every summer in the pool and even did a turn as captain of the swim team at his high school. That he had a little sister named Salem with white blonde hair that was turning seven next month. That his first boyfriend dumped him in a corn field after prom their junior year… before asking for his best friend’s number. He learned that he attended his first dance class his first summer at camp, only because swimming club was full. That he still swam, but mostly as a way to exercise that was easier on the knee he busted his second year of college.
Dean leaned against the partition to the kitchen, crossing his arms. Cas glanced at him again, his gaze appreciatively trailing up Dean’s stomach and chest in a way that made Dean preen and blush at the same time. Maybe he shouldn’t be hoping for more. He’d have to leave soon after ganking this ghost. No use putting down ties to a place that’d just as soon be in his rear view mirror.
An hour and a half later, the party was in full swing. Well, as “full swing” as Dean suspected these small town cast parties could get. The party seemed populated equally by the drama kids—actually enthusiastic for once—and their parents, casting wary looks at Cas now and then, but dutifully looking after their teenagers.
, unmotivated group of teenage layabouts into something resembling a cast, but does anyone try?” He turned on the students suddenly, causing a few of them to jump. “Does anyone take direction without acting like a
He only had one hangup in his line of work, and it was time to lose it. He wasn’t off his game, he wasn’t going soft.
or something. I don’t buy the BS the locals throw around.” The man put his hands in his pockets and squinted up at where Dean was pointing the beam.
“He won’t let me poke around during the day. We’ll have to go after dark.” Dean slid into the driver’s seat.
Startled, Castiel whipped around, pencil tucked behind his ear, to the sound of Dean laughing at him. Dean pointed to Castiel and shook his hips, mouthing the words to the song. He spun around and grabbed a wrench, singing into it like a microphone. Castiel chuckled and shook his head.
“See, Cas?” Castiel tried to lift his head to look at Dean while he was talking, but couldn't find the energy. “This is what we call ‘foreplay,’ and ain’t it a beautiful thing?”
Castiel pulled out his phone and flips through a number of pictures of the things he paints and they’re huge floor to ceiling paintings of eyes in incredible detail. He doesn’t have a lot on his phone, because Anna was right, it is a burner cell. But he couldn’t resist showing off a bit the last time he was in the studio.
Castiel settled into the plush chair, still in the same position from the last time he was here in this room. Dean leaned against the edge of his desk, shrugging off his jacket, and folding his henley-covered arms. Here, he looked about ten years older than he usually did.
Castiel knew he was staring. The man’s eyes were green. And not just green, but green. The kind of color you see in pictures and wonder if it was photoshopped. The color you forget eyes can be. The kind of green that makes you think of leaves, lit up by the sunlight and made to glow.
Anna raised an eyebrow. “Are you gonna humiliate yourself again against someone else’s homosexuality?”
“I don’t remember making a pinky promise to fuck you.” Dean snapped. Castiel fell silent. Drying his hands, Dean threw his shirt over his shoulder, going over to the stairs to grab his briefcase. “I’m going upstairs to take a proper shower. Come… get me if you need me.” He finished and started back up the stairs.
Anna used her position in his arms to smack him on the back of the head, but her face was less drawn than it was earlier.
Adler pointed to him. “Stay out of my office after hours. You’re lucky I didn’t call the police like I first intended to.”
- Castiel loves visiting the bookstore and Anita. He stops by one day and Sr. Guerrero tells him how much better he looks and the whole story spills out. Sr. Guerrero makes him promise to bring Dean by one day. Castiel isn’t sure Dean’s ready for that.
“And look at this.” Castiel sidled up close to Dean and opened the thick folder he was carrying, containing what appeared to be student injury reports. He shoved it towards Dean to give him a better look. On the very top was the latest one, entered for a student named Kevin Tran, the student Dean had heard about. He squinted at the page. The description of this injury section was less detailed than he could have hoped.
to stop reading that line like that. It’s distracting.” The man said like he was exasperated, probably having said it five times that day. The student—Brent—snipped back at him, earning a chuckle from the rest of the teenagers.
“You don’t say?” Dean grinned. They started down the far hallway. The lockers here were the same dark green as the other accents around the building. Cardboard images of the school logo alongside posters bearing ‘CC Bison County’ explained the pile of buffalo cutouts Dean had seen the previous night. “Alright, enough horsing around. We gotta start somewhere. What do you know about the guy who had the job before you?”
Mr. Winchester’s eyes gleamed with a look that sent an involuntary shiver up Castiel’s spine. “Believe me, sweetheart, I’ll take real good care of you if you let me.” Mr. Winchester pulled his phone out of his pocket, glanced at it, and shook his head. “It’s real late, Cas. I’ve got a spare room you can use for the night if you want to hang out for a bit. We can talk about this more in the morning if you want.” When Castiel hesitated, he added with a sad smile, “I promise no funny business… unless you ask.” He finished with a goodnatured leer.
Sam opened his mouth, but Dean interrupted “—he’s in school to be an artist. He paints big pictures of eyes and shit.”
Snorting, Kaiser waved his hand. “Don’t tell me you’re one to believe in ghosts, Clarkson. You’ll end up like those kids at the high school.” He pointed at Castiel, “This young man’ll tell you. Those kids spend more time cooking up ghost stories than doing their homework. Not by any fault of your own, a’course.” He smiled understandingly at Castiel.
“Even with design meetings?” Castiel swiveled his hips, causing Dean to nearly lose support in his arms.
Mr. Winchester laid a heavy hand on his shoulder, causing him to pop his head up. Mr. Winchester still had a concerned look on his face, like Castiel was some spooked horse. “Castiel—Cas, I don’t feel comfortable doing anything to you like this. You look like you might be sick,” he tilted his head. “Have you had anything tonight? Anyone give you anything?”
The first side door he tried to the theater was locked, but the lock and handle were so rusted out, Dean wasn’t sure his lock picking kit would even do him any good. He didn’t really relish the thought of kicking it down. The building might be deserted, but this town was so quiet, neighbors were likely to hear any serious commotion. The last thing he wanted was to involve all two squad cars of the local police. Sometimes, small-town police were worse than LAPD. No one higher up to answer to.
“You’re supposed to safeword if it gets to be too much.” Dean’s tone sounded flat and he wouldn’t look at Castiel.
One of the girls tripped and stumbled into the dancer next to her, causing a chain reaction that wound up with the entirety of Anna’s line on the ground. Castiel leapt to his feet to help, but by the time the instructor stalked forward from the back of the room calling for “Cut!” the girls were already helping each other to their feet, giggling and playfully shoving each other. The director, a lean man with all his hair gelled back on the top and shaved sides, patted the clumsy girl on the back and stood at the front of the group.
“You’re more than welcome to do that anytime, you know.” He said, making Cas chuckle. They lapsed into silence. They traced fingers over each other’s skin. It was Dean that spoke first.
Bela grinned like she hoped he would ask. She opened her bag and rummaged around. “The first is to take care of the people who love you. Fuck the rest of the world to hell, but pay special attention to those who pay good attention to you.”
Castiel considered. “That was… interesting. Good. I don't know if I’d want that all the time, but it was definitely… different.”
His grip was clumsy, he knew. He felt stoned and drunk and high and manic all at the same time. He wrapped a hand around Cas’s cock, relishing the way it made Cas clench tighter around him, pitching forward with pleased surprise.
Dean’s eyes instantly hardened, and he straightened up, putting himself at his full three inches above Castiel. “I am paying you for sex, aren’t I?”
Greens were the hardest to get right. Too much yellow, and you wound up in chartreuse territory, with a predilection towards olive. Too much blue, and you were stuck in aqua and turquoise, with no way out. Castiel thought that emerald would be too extreme for Dean's particular shade. Maybe more of a candy apple or Granny Smith.
They pulled apart. Dean looked rather contrite. “Sorry, it’s just—“ He looked down, green eyes darting around.
“Give me ten minutes and we’ll find something for breakfast.” Cas hoisted himself out of bed, leaving the covers knocked off of Dean, the chill of the bedroom permeating their warm bubble. All he could do was watch as Cas disappeared into the hallway.
“Unless you’re feeling a trip to Lawrence in the middle of the evening, I say we pick between pizza or semi-decent Mexican food.”
“Mm—Dean?” Cas blinked a few times, adjusting to the morning light. He winced as he likely felt all the places he was being held together by thread and plaster.
Finally, when Missouri came and tapped at their door with a knowing “Make yourselves decent for your guests”, they ducked out of the chair with guilty smiles and went about getting re-fixed to go out in public.
Cas hummed as his lips slid over Dean’s cock and Dean lost it. His body went boneless as he came. His hands in Cas’ hair helped keep him upright as Cas swallowed everything. After releasing Dean’s softening dick, Dean pulled Cas up and into a kiss, tasting himself on Cas’ lips.
Castiel turned back to the front of his station as Paul and Mary walked up. They started with his honey and ricotta. Dean bit back a gasp as he watched Paul’s hand reach towards Castiel. It was the first handshake Paul had given out in the tent and Dean watched as Castiel took Paul’s hand. They finished judging Castiel’s second pastry and moved on to finish judging the signature.
“Woah, nobody is sticking their hands in my pants. I am not getting FELT UP by a dude in an airport!” Dean crossed his arms, standing firm.
Paul took one of the apple turnovers first and placed it on a small plate. He used a knife to cut the pastry into smaller pieces. “Nice crisp pastry, cuts well.”
The pain that Cas could feel through Dean’s prayer was palpable. It ripped through his heart, and lingered. The heartache wasn’t the beginning, or the end. His whole body ached as Dean’s emotions continued to pour out through his prayer.
He sat on the edge of his bed, head falling into his hands. A deep sigh escaped his lips, thoughts racing.
Things between Dean and Cas were good. They never shared Dean’s room at the bunker but would always share a bed on an overnight hunt. Dean slept soundly, Cas’ arms wrapped around his body. Nights like this, Cas would rest. He rarely slept but he always felt at peace with Dean’s warm body snuggled close to his.
Dean looked around and saw everyone was confused as he was. Shrugging, Dean placed his pie in his fridge. He closed the fridge and made his way towards the entrance to the tent.
The rest of the reception was filled with music, drinking, and dancing. As the hours dwindled down, Dean started to hint at Cas that it was time to go. It started subtle, a firm hand on Cas’ upper thigh. Gradually, Dean lost his subtlety. Midnight rang, and Dean grabbed Cas’ hand, dragging him towards the door.
Cas nodded and began looking for the next motel to stop at. A few miles down the road, they came across a run down old motel. He checked them in and drove the Impala to a parking space near the room. Dean grabbed his bag out of the back and followed Cas inside the dim lights barely lighting it. Dean’s duffle made a thud as it hit the cheap carpet.
Dean just stared at him, the words that Cas just said refusing to register. The angel had become someone Dean didn’t always recognize and this was one of those moments. Cas didn’t kill without reason and the amount of blood on the trenchcoat told a story of death.
“ALL CLEAR.” Dean balked as Agent Novak yelled in his face. He watched as the man walked out of the room and he stood there, belt unbuckled with a hard on from getting a pat down. A deep blush spread across his face. He did his belt back up and gave himself a moment to compose himself before walking out of the room.
“Yeah, just us.” Dean moved to stand behind Cas’ chair. He placed his hands on Cas’ shoulders and gently kissed the top of his head. “We got some catching up to do.”
He stepped back, Cas pushing the chair back and turned to face Dean. He reached out and took Dean’s hand. Together, they headed towards Dean’s room with all the time in the world.
“No Dean. I need to finish this. We don’t know how tomorrow will end. The hatred, the anger, that’s not who you are, and everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are. You are the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know. Because you cared, I cared. I care about you, Sam, Jack, even the whole damn world because of you. You changed me, Dean.” Tears had begun falling down Cas’ face, voice breaking with each word. “I love you, Dean Winchester, and I can’t imagine my world, the whole world without you.”
Dean smiled as those words left Cas’ mouth. He doubled his efforts, determined to make Cas come. There was no warning before Cas’s cum covered Dean’s hand, some hitting Dean’s stomach.
Dean didn’t need to be told twice. He surged forward, capturing the other man’s lips in a searing kiss. One hand reached around to grasp at Cas’ ass while the other landed on his hip. He felt warm hands slide under his flour coated shirt. Cas thumbed over his nipples and Dean moaned.
Dean met Cas’ gaze and smiled. He has been waiting weeks for Cas to be okay with this. His hand grabbed Cas’ and he pulled them both up to sit on the edge of the bed. He ignored the come cooling on his chest, savoring the moment of just being beside Cas. He leaned over and gently pressed a kiss to Cas’ forehead. Dean stood, hand sliding away from Cas’, and walked towards the bathroom.
Sam stood on the other side. Dean looked his brother over, noting the still present beard and bags under his eyes. Despite removing Chuck from the equation, Sam was still working overtime to help hunters continue to fight the lesser monsters of the world.
“I was not expecting this, Dean.” Cas’ voice was impossibly deep, which sent more of Dean’s blood rushing south. “Did you buy this for yourself or for me?”
Jack slowly approached Lucifer, anticipating him to try and fight back. Lucifer remained in his chair, hands in his lap, making no moves to counter Jack’s progression towards him. Jack placed his hands on either side of Lucifer’s head. Cas could sense the power filling the room, could feel Jack beginning to take Lucifer’s power, his grace. Dean and Sam watched as Lucifer started to fade, grace pouring into Jack. A few moments passed before Lucifer slumped over.
Dean laughed, a full bodied laugh that shook both of them. “It’s an expression Cas, I’m flirting with you.”
Dean nodded absentmindedly. He had nothing else to say to Sam, who realized that soon after. He left Dean alone, and joined a conversation about vamps nearby.
“You believe, Dean, and for that I’m happy — but I don’t have that faith anymore. I lost it a long time ago. I lost my faith in my Father when he abandoned Heaven eons ago. But there is one thing I will never lose faith in, Dean. You. When I raised you from Hell all those years ago and heard the message “Dean Winchester is saved”, I knew my life would be forever changed. Knowing you, Dean, has changed me.”
He removed his finger as slowly as he inserted it but continued moving it in and out of Dean’s ass. His speed increased as Dean relaxed, the sensation becoming familiar. He added a second finger, and began stretching Dean in earnest.
“Let’s lock him in 7B. We’ll figure it out later. Right now, we just need to finish prepping for tomorrow.”
“I don’t know man. We are trying to kill God and the only real plan we have is one that we only know half of because it’s Billie’s plan. Jack’s getting worse — more powerful, but worse all the same. We can’t let him die.”
Dean turned around to look at the angel. Cas had been in and out of the bunker for weeks, searching for answers and ways to kill Chuck. Dean felt his face give way to a look of surprise  when he saw what looked like fresh, and a large amount, blood on Cas’ trenchcoat.
“Dean.... Dean…” his voice came out breathy, unable to form words other than Dean’s name. Dean continued his work, tongue swirling around Cas’ dick, looking up at his face as Cas came undone. The hand that had been fondling Cas’ balls dropped to his own crotch, trying to relieve some of the pressure. He knew Cas wouldn’t last long, not with the sounds coming out of his mouth and how tightly he was gripping Dean’s shoulders.
They broke apart after a few moments, smiling as they looked around. Cas’ gripped Dean’s hand and led him to the table where their cake sat. The simple exterior of the cake was elegant. Cake cutter in hand, both men created the first slice. The rainbow interior of the cake matched the handprint on Dean’s left shoulder. They took turns feeding the one a single bite, laughing when Cas missed Dean’s mouth, smearing frosting across his cheek.
Cas had an inkling on what the end of that prayer was supposed to be. He hoped, had prayers of his own that would never be spoken. Cas moved away, leaving Dean on his knees, staring up at the stars.
Dean’s lips crashed into Cas’, hands gripping his shirt tightly. He wasn’t any good with words but he knew he could show Cas that he felt the same way. He felt Cas’ lips soften against his, and took it as the invitation he had been waiting weeks for.
Cas looked at Dean, wrapped in the blankets and knew bad things were running through his mind. He wordlessly handed Dean a to-go cup filled with coffee and set the food he had bought down on the bed. Removing his shoes, he climbed back into the bed next to Dean. He reached out, pulling Dean closer.
“Letting you go was easier than admitting I was wrong. I don’t know why I get so angry.” Dean’s eyes opened, hoping the stars were listening. It was the only thing he had left, the thought that Cas could even potentially hear his prayers.
It took hours for the kelpie to appear but they were ready when it did. Two iron stakes and a puddle of kelpie mush later, both men climbed in their separate cars to begin the drive back to the bunker.
“Well Cas is a shortened version of my name.” Dean snorts out a laugh. “But I think there’s a kelpie taking victims from the lake.”
“Panties off, garter stays.” Dean breathed against Cas’ lips. Cas nodded in response and knelt to remove the panties from Dean’s body. He left kisses down Dean’s stomach and thighs, avoiding Dean’s leaking cock. Cas planted several kisses around the garter, loving the feeling of the silk against his lips and cheeks. Dean’s breathing was becoming more rapid and his hands had found their way to Cas’ hair.
“Hello Dean, so glad you decided to open that door.” The voice that penetrated through Dean’s sleep hazed mind was not the voice of his angel, but a voice that he had long thought dead. Dean tried to close the door but the person on the other side was more powerful than him.
“You see, Jack’s been a power vacuum recently. Absorbing all kinds of power, including Lucifer’s grace and now yours. There was no ending in your book, it’s blank but we found a way. That’s what we do, find a way to win no matter what.”
“Alright, but I don’t like it. I don’t trust him.” His eyes narrowed as he looked at Lucifer with the last word.
Dean didn’t think about the fact that Agent Novak was now kneeling in front of him, his half hard cock threatening to become fully erect.
Jack sighed, and began to follow Dean’s careful instructions of driving. Soon they made it out of the parking lot and onto the highway. Dean chuckled when he noticed how hard Jack continued to grip the steering wheel, even as they approached the bunker. “You did good, kid.”
Leaving the cleaned kitchen behind, Dean made his way back to his room. He closed and locked the door before stripping. He placed the panties back in their box, hiding them away once again. Maybe he would have the courage to wear them again soon.
“I could use a nap. We still have like 2 hours before we have to be back in the tent.” Cas said, turning off the water and grabbing a towel.
Dean woke with a start, alarm on his phone blaring. He groaned and reached out, trying to locate the offending device. After a few seconds, although the noise made it feel like an eternity, he successfully silenced the alarm. He continued to lay buried in blankets for several minutes, recalling a dream he had the night before. A dream that had felt like a memory but had also felt like a promise. They had won the fight against Chuck, and given themselves permission to live freely. They remained in the bunker, giving aid to hunters across the country but not doing much hunting themselves. He, Cas, Sam, Eileen and Jack —  all one family.
He managed to refocus on his own station, starting on the same step that Cas was on. The pineapple was to be combined with cream cheese and Dean speculated that it needed to be fairly dry before combining the two. It took quite a bit of time before there was no more juice coming out of the pineapple as he squeezed. He looked at the provided instructions.
They found themselves hunting a vampire nest in Iowa in mid-November. It matched the details of a case in John’s journal. They tracked them back to an old barn. It was just past sundown when the fighting started.
His hands let go of Cas’ shirt only to begin unbuttoning it. Once the buttons were undone, he slid the shirt from Cas’ shoulders, throwing it off to the side once it was free. He felt Cas’ hands slide under his own shirt, lifting it up. Their lips broke apart long enough for Dean’s shirt to come off and join Cas’ on the floor. Dean pulled Cas closer, the feeling of skin on skin contact jolting through his body.
Dean watched as Cas walked away, his stomach turning at the thought of Cas harming someone intentionally who didn’t deserve it. There was nothing he could do to change Cas’ actions but Dean just hoped he wouldn’t have to see blood covering Cas’ trench coat again anytime soon.
“Why do you think they are letting us leave while the pies cool?” Castiel asked, his voice deeper now that Dean was right beside him.
Before he knew it, Dean’s timer went off. He looked through the glass of the oven and saw that the pastry looked like it was done. Fingers crossed, he pulled his danishes out of the oven. Both sets of 12 seemed like they were done and Dean sighed with relief.
“Hey now. You’re family and you won’t break her. There isn’t a reason I shouldn’t trust either of you with her. Cas, on the other hand-”
Dean’s jaw dropped as he watched Cas walk away from him. The panties were something that only Rhonda had ever known about. He wasn’t even sure if she knew he took them with him when he left the morning after. Now Cas had seen them, commented on them. There was no coming back from that. Dean shook his head, and pulled his shirt down to make sure the waistband of his jeans was fully covered before turning back to face the stove. He lost all motivation to cook and began placing everything back in it’s rightful place.
A blush started to creep up Dean’s cheeks. “Both. I love how they feel and I know you love how I look in panties.”
“We aren’t going to make it back to the bunker tonight. Let’s find a place to stop,” Dean said, eyes fixed on Cas.
“Dean. Tomorrow might not go the way we want. I… need to tell you something, just in case we don’t make it out of tomorrow.”
“Sam! Dean let me drive the Impala! I know how to drive now!” Dean laughed as the excited words came bubbling out of Jack. He smiled at Sam, who in return gave Dean a knowing look.
Emotions and thoughts all jumbled together as Dean tried to put together a sentence to reassure Cas.
“I’ll find a way to get you out! I swear!” The last words that Dean spoke punched Cas in the gut. The last words he heard echoed in his head as a prayer “I promise you I will find a way. Because I…”
Several hours, and several beers later, Dean decided it was time to leave the party behind. He slid past dozens of hunters and made his way to the quieter part of the bunker that housed the rooms he and Sam lived in. There were other rooms that hunters who needed a place to crash could use as well. Dean suspected that there wouldn’t be any empty rooms in the bunker tonight.
Cas smiled, and reached towards the bedside table. He guessed that Dean kept lube nearby and was rewarded with a bottle rolled forward when he opened the door. He grabbed the bottle and squirted the cool liquid onto his right hand. He rubbed his fingers together, warming the lube. His hand slid between Dean’s legs, one finger finding its way to circle the rim of Dean’s asshole.
“I know how you see yourself Dean, you see yourself as our enemies see you. You’re destructive and you’re angry and you’re broken. You’re “Daddy’s Blunt Instrument”. And you think that hate and anger is what drives you.”
The sound of the other bakers pounding butter soon filled the tent. Everyone was rushing to get their butter back into the fridge. The longer the butter stayed out in the Kansas summer heat , the harder it was going to be to keep the butter inside their pastries. Dean quickly got his butter into the freezer and started to prep his fillings. He had about 10 minutes more of his dough proving before he could start folding the butter in. With the butter in the freezer, Dean started on  his fillings.
As he stirred, Dean glanced to the station next to him. Cas seemed to be lost in creating lamination with his pastry. Dean watched in fascination as Cas did a book turn fold with his pastry. An interesting technical, but not one Dean would have chosen. Book folds can easily overwork the dough because it ends up having to be flatten more than an envelope folds. Lost in thought, Dean jumped as his timer went off. It was time for him to begin the lamination process himself.
Some nights, after Dean prayed to Cas, he and Benny would fuck. It destroyed Castiel to know that Dean probably didn’t love him the way he loved Dean. The envy ate away at him, jealousy telling Cas to walk up to the pair but he knew he never could. They had enough of a target on their backs as Dean was human. Putting them in more danger than they already were was not something Cas was willing to do, despite wishing Benny’s death.
“It will be okay. Your brother loves you and will not care. You don’t have to hide this Dean, you have never had to.”
Dean watched as a male TSA approached and then waved him through the metal detector. It beeped as he went through and he knew it was because of his belt buckle.
Sam opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by Cas entering the bunker door. He came down the stairs, and as soon as he caught sight of Lucifer, his angel blade slid into his hand. “Lucifer.” The deep growl of his voice could only be the result of hatred.
“Hell if I was gonna let anything happen to Sammy. I just made sure John was worn out before he got to Sammy.”
“Thanks for saving my life, again.” Dean kissed the back of Cas’ head, arms wrapping around his waist. Cas turned around, eyes meeting Dean’s. They stood there, bodies warm against each other.
Dean woke to the sound of his phone ringing loudly, the ringtone he had assigned Cas blaring on the bedside table.
Finally, Benny and Dean reached the portal. Cas knew that this was his last chance to prove to Dean that he was still there, still Dean’s angel.
The four of them turned towards the Impala, leaving Chuck laying in the dirt, powerless and defeated. The doors opened and closed, the last sounds they heard were Chuck begging them to come back, desperately crying for them to help him. The engine turned over, and the Impala drove off.
“I lost my key… please let me in,” the voice came through the speaker of the phone clearly, although Cas rarely ever talked into his phone properly.
Cas walked into the kitchen, having heard Dean rummaging around to start cooking. He stood near the doorway, observing Dean in his element. A flash of pink from under Dean’s waistband caught Cas’ eye as Dean reached for something on a higher shelf. His breath caught in his chest as Dean turned around and froze, eyes meeting Cas’.
Sam looked cautiously over to Lucifer, whose face held a wide grin. “Hiya Sammy. I want in on your little plan to kill my father. You see, I still have a score to settle with my dear dad. Jack might be what you need to kill him but how do you plan on getting to him? It’s not like he’s just going to come running if you call.”
The bedroom door clicked shut behind him and Dean tossed his bag into the corner where it lived. He started shedding layers, the leather jacket hitting the floor, followed by his flannel. Turning the shower on as hot as it would go to warm up, Dean stood in front of the mirror. His hands braced against the counter as he stared himself down. His face had kelpie splattered over it, some sticking in his hair. Stripping out of the rest of his clothes, Dean got in the shower and scrubbed himself clean.
“No, in this ending you grow old. You die, forgotten.” Dean said, walking to where Cas had begun to come around. “I’m not the killer you wanted me to be, not anymore.” He helped Cas to his feet, supporting his weight.
Sam came in as Dean was flipping the first of the pancakes. He grabbed a cup of coffee and sat at the counter across from Dean, smiling gently when he heard Dean was humming to himself as he flipped pancakes and cooked eggs. “Did you have a good night last night?” Sam asked with a light laugh in his voice.
Dean watched as Cas left the room, silently closing the door behind him. He stumbled backwards, falling onto the bed. His hands came up to his face, feeling the fresh tears on his cheeks. Thoughts raced through his head, from Cas’ confession to his actions to the hope of tomorrow. He stayed there, sitting on his bed for hours before finally gathering the energy to prepare for the next day.
“Oh Sammy, has your brother ever had a plan you liked? No? I didn’t think so.” Lucifer took several steps towards the table and grabbed a chair. “You can’t get rid of me, and you know you need me.”
They ate quietly, Cas supporting Dean’s weight. He knew it was all he could do, show Dean that he wasn’t going anywhere. Once breakfast was finished, Cas stood. He put his hand out to coax Dean out of bed.
It didn’t take long before the only words coming out of Dean’s mouth between moans were “fuck, Cas” and “oh my god”.
Dean looked to Cas, and the realization that Cas was wearing his clothes hit him. He grinned from ear to ear. “You look amazing Cas. In fact, you look perfect standing there in my American Apparel.”
“Combine pineapple, cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. It doesn’t say how much.” Dean sighed and decided to go with his gut. He combined about 1 cup of his pineapple with 8 ounces of cream cheese. He added 1 tablespoon of sugar and tasted it. It wasn’t sweet so he decided to add one more tablespoon. A splash of vanilla was next and he watched as the cream cheese and pineapple combined into a smooth filling.
Looking around, Dean saw several of the other contestants had left their pie crusts out. Cursing himself, he took his crust out of the fridge. The crust had gone slightly soggy in the middle due to the drastic temperature difference.
Since the four of them and Lucifer remained locked down in the bunker to avoid detection from Chuck, Dean’s dreams had taken an unusual turn. More of them left him feeling safe and sound, as opposed to weeks prior when he woke after restless nights. He didn’t talk to anyone about it, refusing to acknowledge that he had a theory on why. Talking, that would involve letting those feelings come up and that was something Dean couldn’t do.
Benny was the only thing that was actually keeping Dean alive. No matter how much he prayed to Castiel, Cas never came for him. He lost almost all hope but continued to pray every night, falling to his knees and hoping that the stars and Cas were listening. Days bled into weeks and then into months. Dean’s faith wavered but his prayers never stopped.
After they had all finished breakfast and the dishes were set out to dry after being washed, Sam hit the library, while Dean took Jack down to the garage. “We have to do a food and beer restock for sure, and I have something fun planned for you along the way.”
A bright beam of light shot in the air when Sam finished speaking. It quickly faded and the four men looked at each other, waiting.
“Very cryptic. Now off you go!” Mel and Sue waited until Mary and Paul had left the tent. “Mary would like you all to make a blueberry strata pie. You will have 2 hours to make your pies, but they will not be judged until later this evening. On your mark.”
Eyes closed, Dean couldn’t see the man he was praying to as Cas watched from the trees. Cas could hear both Dean’s spoken words and the prayer echoing in his head. He wasn’t sure which part hurt worse, the spoken words or the prayer.
“No? Alright. OPT OUT MALE ASSIST NEEDED.” The last part of her sentence yelled for everyone at the security line to hear.
“Alright bakers. It is time for the technical challenge. This one is pretty interesting. Mary, you choose it. Do you have any advice for the bakers?” Sue looked over at Mary as she spoke.
“I tried to stop him from getting in. But he had a compelling argument that I think you should hear out.”
Dean was caught off guard when Castiel’s hand brushed against his. He looked over to find Castiel’s eyes locked on his face. Words escaped him as blue eyes bore into his own green ones. The memory of Castiel’s hands squeezing pineapple came rushing forward and Dean felt color rising on his cheeks. Strong fingers intertwined with his. Dean allowed himself to be led the rest of the way to the building overlooking the tent. Thoughts raced through his head but he ignored them, focusing on the feeling of Castiel’s hand in his.
“One day, I want to see you in that coat and nothing else.” He winked as Cas blushed, the mental picture appearing in his mind. Cas turned his head, but nodded.
“Wait, guys, I might have found something but it’s going to take a lot more than we have now,” Sam said, words breaking through the tense air.
“Are you wearing my underwear, dude?” The words slipped out of Dean’s mouth without a second thought, although the voice in his head said he looks so perfect standing there in my American Apparel underwear.
“I love you Cas” the words slipped out, barely a whisper and Dean rolled over to meet Cas’ gaze. He stared into those steel blue eyes for a moment before gently capturing Cas’ lips with his own.
He felt Cas grab the bottom of his shirt and allowed him to pull it over his head. Dean returned the favor, marveling at Cas’ toned body once his shirt was gone. Hands moving of their own will now, he reached for the front of Cas’ pants. Cas made an ungodly noise when Dean’s hand brushed over his covered erection. He made quick work of Cas’ pants and encouraged the man to step out of where the jeans pooled on the floor. Dean hooked his fingers around the plaid boxers that were the last thing standing between him and Cas being fully naked.
Dean’s hands wandered around Cas’ body, lips seeking entry to Cas’ mouth. Cas gasped when Dean’s hands slid under his shirt and Dean took advantage of his gasp. His tongue slid against Cas’ teeth. A shudder passed through Cas’ body and he pulled back.
“That sounds rough.” Dean watched as Agent Novak walked to stand behind his chair. He felt two strong hands on his shoulders.
Dean turned around, his emerald green eyes finding Cas’s steel blue eyes. He went searching for answers in those blue depths but Cas was unreadable, as usual. He nodded, and kept walking towards his room.
“I don’t know what I would do without you. You aren’t allowed to die, not when you have so much life left in you.” Cas breathed.
Cas walked them backwards towards the bed, hands fighting Dean’s belt along the way. He worked the button and zipper open. Dean’s legs hit the bed, and he fell onto it. He lifted his hips when Cas tried to pull his pants off. They struggled to get the coordination to get Dean’s pants off but as soon as they did, Dean felt Cas’ hand wrap around his dick. He gasped, not used to the feeling of another man’s hand around him. Cas slid his tongue into Dean’s mouth and Dean moaned.
Cas continued to pump him, hand speeding up as Dean’s moans became louder. His mouth left Dean’s to leave a trail of kisses down his neck. He took one of Dean’s nipples in his mouth, swirling his tongue around it. Dean’s back arched off the bed, Cas’ name falling from his lips like a prayer. Cas continued to tease Dean’s nipple with his tongue, hand pumping his cock. He could feel Dean thrusting up into his hand, and his thrusts were getting faster, harder. He placed one last kiss on Dean’s chest, right on his tattoo. Kissing down Dean’s hard stomach, Cas found himself looking up towards Dean.
Hands fought belts. Dean pushed Cas’ pants down. He took the hint, stepping out of his shoes and pants. Dean did the same. Their bodies crashed back together, Cas’ hands traced Dean’s stomach lightly. Dean gasped as one of Cas’ hands moved upward, one finger circling a nipple. His fingers threaded through Cas’ hair as he moved to kiss Dean’s jawline, his neck, his tattoo. He continued his path down Dean’s body, drawing noises out of Dean that were ungodly. He planted one kiss on each of Dean’s hips before standing straight. He placed his hands on Dean’s shoulders, and pushed Dean backwards towards the small bed. Dean’s legs hit the end and he was falling onto the bed.
Cas nodded, and slowly started pressing himself into Dean. He waited until Dean had adjusted to his dick before continuing inch by inch until he was fully seated. Cas leaned in, trapping Dean’s cock between their stomachs as he captured Dean’s lips in a searing kiss. He felt Dean’s hands on his hips and knew it was time to move. He withdrew almost completely before sliding home once again. Each stroke, Cas picked up speed. One hand settled on Dean’s hip while the other found the garter on Dean’s thigh. He played with it while thrusting into Dean.
He smiled, hands reaching for Cas’ pants. They brushed over Cas’ fabric-clad cock, and shivered passed down Cas’ spine. His mouth opened in shock, and Dean took the opportunity to kiss him. His hands aptly undid Cas’ pants, pulling them down and leaving Cas in nothing but boxers.
Dean and Cas took Lucifer to lock up, while Jack retreated to his room. Sam worked on cleaning up the kitchen after breakfast, washing coffee cups and pancake plates. He left them on the drying rack and headed to the library.
The next morning, the four of them sat around the map table. No one was eating, although the coffee cups were full.
Dean winced at the words sensitive areas. He wasn’t a teenager but damn the TSA guy was hot and he didn’t quite trust his own body not to respond.
Dean sighed, and started to carefully remove each pastry from the baking sheet. He placed them neatly on a large platter and stood next to his creations. Mary and Paul started with Kevin, the wildly creative grad student who was two stations ahead of Dean. The feedback he got was mostly positive but his pastry wasn’t quite cooked. Before he knew it, Mary and Paul were standing across from Dean.
Dean sighed, and rolled off the bed. After throwing on jeans and an old Zep t-shirt, he made his way to the kitchen. Someone had already made a pot of coffee, so Dean poured himself a cup. He opened the fridge hoping to find something for breakfast that didn’t involve cooking. Nothing had been made, so Dean set out to make eggs and pancakes for everyone at the bunker.
Dean swallowed hard, the only reason he had said those three words early was because he was angry enough to have no inhibitions. He meant them, but they didn’t come out again.
“Dude, your fake butter is disgusting and you should really just use real butter on pancakes.” Both men started laughing, Sam’s health kicks had always been funny to the brothers.  “Have you made any breakthroughs on the whole killing Chuck thing? I really want it to be over and done with.”
After reaching their room, they left their shoes by the door and dropped their bags on the floor. Their lips crashed together, all of the heat that had been building throughout the day coming to the surface. Dean’s tongue pressed against the seam of Cas’ mouth, seeking permission to enter. Cas groaned, lips opening and allowing Dean’s tongue to slip inside. Dean’s hands slid Cas’ suspenders off his shoulders and moved to work on unbuttoning his shirt. He made short work of it, tossing the shirt off to the side without ever breaking the kiss. Cas returned the favor.
The door closed softly behind Dean. He sat in the only chair in the room and watched as a video played on a small TV. The TV started describing the private pat down. Dean’s heart sank when the lights turned off. He was cloaked in darkness for only a few seconds before new lights came on. These lights could only be described as mood lighting.
He placed his phone back in his pocket and felt a piece of paper. Dean pulled it out and found a handwritten note.
Dean looked around the security line, TSA agents everywhere and people in various states of undress. A female agent was yelling to the crowd, informing of all the things they needed to do in order to go through.
The feeling of Dean coming, ass tightening around Cas’ cock brought him over the edge. He thrust one final time, moaning as his orgasm coursed through his body. He released Dean’s softening dick, and slowly pulled out. Dean’s eyes were closed, body limp on the bed. Cas leaned in, and kissed Dean gently.
Sam leaned against the door frame to the map room, eyes fixed on his big brother. Dean hadn’t spoken to anyone for longer than a few minutes since the party had started. He shook his head, and walked towards Dean.
He took Dean’s cock in his mouth as his finger slid inside. The tight heat of Dean’s ass made Cas moan, vibrations sending pleasure coursing through Dean. As soon as he felt Dean was ready, he added a second finger.
“Place your feet on the yellow foot prints. I’m going to give you a pat down. I will let you know where I’m going to touch you before I touch you and I’ll use the back of my hands for any sensitive areas.”
Cas looked down at the man kneeling before him, cheeks flushed. He nodded, answering Dean’s silent question.
Cas and Jack stood in the empty space of Dean’s room. Jack smiled at Dean before opening the door and walking away. The door closed behind him and Dean was left staring into Cas’ steel blue eyes.
Dean drove, Sam rode shotgun while Jack and Cas filled the backseat. There was no music, not today. They all needed to be in the right headspace for this plan to work. The Impala rolled into their destination a few hours later, a small lake far from any surrounding towns. They started setting up, carefully placing each item where it needed to be. Once everything was in place, Sam recited the spell, Latin words sliding off his tongue with ease.
The corners of his eyes still crinkled in amusement, Dean’s demeanor softens and his joking tone dissolves completely. “They don’t stand a chance.”
“Don’t you dare use Cas against me,” Dean threatened, looking like he wanted to drop-kick Sam even as the steam ran out of his words and he lowered his gaze to Madagascar. “I never should’ve told you.”
Taking advantage of the first lull of the day, Cas strides over to and behind the counter. “Thank you for the hug via carrier pigeon,” he says as he wraps his arms around Dean, leaning his head into the crook of Dean’s neck.
after your text, Cassie. What kind of uncle do you think I am?”); a new art table complete with gel paints, chalk, and markers from Castiel; and a remote controlled car and a super soft blanket patterned like a tortilla from Dean (“Every good burrito needs some pepper Jack cheese!”).
That checked out. The spirit of Oswald definitely hadn’t been possessing Adler for long, but in that time, there wasn’t enough power there to really keep up the charade of being someone else for long. That kind of control took spirits time to master and integrate with the host.
Dean grabbed the folder and took another report at random. Hollis Jones from 1994 had experienced a similar accident to what he had heard about Kevin. Accidentally fell. Student reported being pushed. No witnesses or suspects. Student healing in the hospital. “Well, at least not all the kids die from this thing.”
“Agent. You sure you wanna take down that man just by yourself? He’s proved to be pretty dangerous.” Dean had to stifle a laugh. Yeah, it was a vengeful spirit, but somewhere—he hoped—it was still Cas in there.
“And I want him to be happy. And even though I can admit that I don’t trust you or particularly like you, I have to say that he was… happier with you.” Anna finished.
Sam was patient as Dean stood up and dusted off his ratty jeans. He did look thinner as Missouri had feared, Sam noticed. He looked tired too, like he hadn’t slept properly in about a month. Maybe more. Sam convinced him to put on something a little less oil stained and herded him into the black Challenger that Dean never missed an opportunity to tease him about.
Castiel looked around, wondering how to help her, but not wanting to awkwardly ask. He settled for straightening the heavy drapes as he gazed out onto the lake. “Does he do his own work on his car?” he asked mostly for conversation, but finding himself genuinely interested as soon as he asked.
“He’s—uh… he’s gotta work tomorrow anyway.” Dean checked his back pocket for his wallet, and motioned to Sam that they should get going. Sam followed Dean down to the garage to the auto bay. He remembered laughing hysterically the first time Dean brought him here, and showing off his “bat cave” as he called it. Despite Sam’s incessant teasing, Dean was really proud of his garage. Sam was just glad to see his brother happy.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “You think I would benefit from someone paying me to pretend to be his boyfriend or his—his virgin experiment?”
“But I mean, you’re young still. Plenty of time to settle down with someone.” Shit, he really did look worried. Maybe he was worried about his own prospects, being single at their age as well.
“It’s my fashion house, darling. My name on the building and letterhead.” She curtsied and turned to leave. Castiel reached out and grabbed her arm, pulling it back just as quickly in case he got burned or smote or whatever.
“You tryin’ to get Cas to watch that castle of yours while you go to Vegas again?” Dean asked, shooting Castiel a wink.
“Breath control?! Like you’re going to choke me? That’s fun to you?” Castiel gripped his pen so tight, he thought it might break.
Cas wasted no time before he was rolling and pressing Dean onto his back, so the comforter was bunched around him. He trailed a line of kissed across Dean’s palm and continued up his arm, not being able to resist the sappy gesture. He slid his hand the opposite way down Dean’s arm, ghosting feather-light over Dean’s palm. Dean surprised him by spreading his fingers and drawing Cas’s between them. With their palms locked together, Cas moved their hands to Dean’s side, so he could continue holding his hand as he commenced his next intentions.
and put Dean flat on his back in his bed, stripped down to boxers and nothing else. Flung an arm over his stomach and passed the fuck out.
Castiel spoke, “Don’t worry about me right now. I’m a nobody, compared to you. They won’t care about me at all, other than the fact that you paid me.”
Cas frowned and tugged at the skin some more. They stood together in the bedroom of Cas’s tiny apartment an hour or so before the party. Dean had pulled out one of his nicer shirts and the pair of dark jeans without the bullet hole in the leg for the occasion. Cas was still getting used to his crutches, but had improved miles beyond his trial run in the hospital two days ago. Dean had promised not to save the video he took of Cas struggling around the lobby, but had definitely saved it.
Castiel shrugged and pulled out a pen, searching his pants and jacket pockets for some paper. When he came up empty, he turned to Anna, who was already offering her smooth, pale forearm. Castiel uncapped the pen with his teeth and spoke around the plastic. “Gotta love the extra tips though, right?” Dark lines of ink started to flow across Anna’s skin, feathering in places, and taking structure in others.
Cas tilted his head. “It’s still possible for them to coach One Act. There’s no rule against it, and in a school this small, not unlikely.”
Dean leaned on the counter. Under the glass, various pamphlets and models of historical artifacts were protected from grubby fingerprints and even more dust. “Actually no, we were hoping you could help us with something?” He flashed her one of his friendlier grins.
Alfie looked around. The walls on either side of the gate were tall, with ivy climbing up. He’d read somewhere that ivy actually destroyed the stonework, even though it looked cool and historic and whatever other shit the layout mooks went on about while designing photoshoots. “Capture the architecture, Alfie!” “We need more of the Gothic influence, Alfie!” God. Alfie was tired of hearing it. Maybe if they waited around long enough, the ivy would crumble the wall and they could get into the estate without the psycho with the shotgun coming after them. Alfie fiddled with the lens cap and wandered away from the group.
“I guess as long as you didn’t put every officer in the United States on APB to look for me.” Castiel was only half-joking.
As he entered the deadly quiet garage, Castiel was processing what Gabriel had said. It wasn’t that he regularly took business advice from random assholes. But Gabriel was right. He did only have one job here. It often felt like more of a privilege than a job, but it still was just that—work. Paying the rent. He and Dean fell so easily into each other, but for what? At some point, Dean would grow tired of Castiel and his list of bills, and he’d cut Castiel loose. Then where would he be?
Castiel raised an eyebrow as Dean flicked on the television with another one of those tablet-remote things that Castiel hoped no one ever asked him to use. “That’s it? You just want me to sit on your lap?”
The silence was mercifully broken by Sarah. “I think what Sam is trying to say is that we’ve noticed you haven’t been yourself lately, and we were hoping to help in some way.” God bless his wife. She always knew what to say, especially when Sam tripped over his own helpfulness.
In truth, Castiel hadn’t. He’d been too caught up in not appearing too nervous, anticipating the kinds of things he’d be expected to do, and wondering if he would even enjoy working for the man currently sat on his second-hand sofa. His life had changed quite a lot in half a year.
Cas shook his head. “Hang on a second.” He leaned up to give Dean a quick peck on the cheek before slipping him one of his crutches and taking the box awkwardly in his other arm. He hobbled back up the short stoop and disappeared down the hallway. Dean fought down a blush and a smile as he followed, and watched Cas rap at the door of the apartment next to his. The pretty brunette history teacher Cas had mentioned—Amelia—answered.
Hello everyone! What follows is some questions that were asked a few times over the course of the story between this page and my Tumblr. They're in no real order, but they do tie up some loose ends.
Cas had turned on the gym sound system and one of the kids had hooked up their iPod and was currently blasting a list of Top 40 music that was mostly unrecognizable to Dean. It made him feel old, but Cas assured him he didn’t know any of the songs either. However, when Cas started humming along to something called a Cardi B, Dean knew he was full of shit.
Dean grinned again, his eyes flashing as he turned around and slid his boxer briefs down over the curve of his ass. He bent down as he slid the underwear down, giving Castiel a show, like he knew he was attractive.
“I—he wants to start a charity of sorts… oh wow… but he doesn’t know what cause to back… Jesus, Cas.” Dean sounded choked up as Castiel buried his face in his neck, nipping lightly. Castiel felt as Dean moved his hips into the couch. Popping his head up, he saw that Dean’s hands were thrown over the side of the couch and clenched into fists.
When the young man got up to leave, Dean could hardly believe his luck when the man’s next move was to approach him next. Was Dean really that much of an easy target?
Castiel pursed his lips critically as he looked him up and down. “You know, I don’t know if this is necessarily what I would call your best look.”
“You’re gonna take those kids on the road? No offense, Cas, but they’re…” Dean trailed off, not knowing how to not sound exactly as offensive as he was trying not to be.
And who knew? All this domesticity was making Dean think that maybe, if Cas wasn’t sick of Dean in the six weeks it took to get his cast off, maybe... just maybe, they could settle down in another small town, like this one. Far away from monsters and ghosts and grumpy principals and just... be together. Like actual people. It was a hell of an idea, he thought with a wry smile.
“Sure you do,” Cas mumbled, sounding well on his way to going back to sleep. “You brood when you’re in the car, you brood when you’re reading. A real tragic character you are.”
“Need you to touch me.” Dean ground out and sank down so Castiel could feel every wonderful inch of Dean’s cock against Castiel’s own. For this kind of friction, Castiel reckoned that Dean could ask him for anything, and he would do it. Dean brought their foreheads close together, one of Dean’s big hands behind Castiel’s head, pulling him in. He started rocking in Castiel’s lap and Dean’s hitched breathing was soon drowned out by Castiel’s whimpering sighs with every thrust of Dean’s. Castiel grabbed a handful of Dean’s ass and thrust upwards as best he could, wanting as much contact as he could get. He tried to speed them along, feeling his orgasm coming fast but every time Castiel would get almost close enough, Dean would slow down. Castiel felt his abdomen tightening up. Everything was narrowing down to the places where Dean’s hot skin was touching Castiel’s.
Dean eyed the stack of textbooks towering on the bedside table. AP Calculus, Advanced Economics, IB United States History. The kid was busy enough without his extracurriculars. Probably didn’t even have enough time to think about getting back on stage.
“S-sorry, Cas. It’s just- I’m sorry, no one’s touched me like this for a long, long time and it just f-sorry.”
“Fuck, honey, just look at me.” Dean’s voice was husky and shaky. He was close, and he knew it. He needed to make Cas come first, though. He resumed his previous task of an inelegant handjob, but now that he had Cas’s attention, he pulled out all the stops, trying every trick he knew he liked when someone else was touching him. He tried to smirk down at Cas’s staggered expression, but he wasn’t sure his was any more put-together. Dean leaned down, his other arm shaking at the effort of keeping himself up. He kissed Cas like his life depended on it, but it was more like the two of them panted into each other’s mouths, eyes wide open. Staring at each other, memorizing the other’s face in this moment.
Inside, he looked for Novak first. The man was pressed against the far wall, being held a few inches off the ground with a ghostly hand clamped tight around his windpipe. He wasn’t screaming anymore, but the look on his face suggested he would be if not for the blockage of air.
“Dean…” Castiel gasped, thrusting his hips up blindly. Dean was doing that thing where he hovered over him, not quite touching him, but still allowing Castiel to feel his body heat radiating everywhere. He thrust up again, eager to catch some kind of friction against where he was hot and hard, even now, before they had really started. Dean groaned into his neck, allowing himself to press into him, thrusting slowly against him and causing stars to briefly appear behind the blindfold as Castiel’s breath hitched.
