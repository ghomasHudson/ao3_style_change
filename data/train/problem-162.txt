The man slammed his head against John’s, but it was slower underwater. It didn’t hurt, not nearly as much as John’s lungs were hurting at the moment. The man’s legs were still kicking, but only barely. His fingers scratched at John’s sides, digging and pinching. It did nothing. John held on. Spots were starting to dance behind his eyes.
The truth was, not even John knew how Sherlock managed to leap from the roof of Barts and live to tell the tale. John knew bits and pieces—there was coordination with Mycroft and some sort of safety harness and a second body meant to look like Sherlock as he lay in a bloody pile on the pavement—but he didn’t care to know much more than that. He knew however Sherlock had pulled it off, it was brilliant and mind-bogglingly complicated and yet so obvious in hindsight that John would question his mental faculties that he didn’t pick up on it in the moment. All he knew—all he cared to know—was that Sherlock was back. Not dead, apparently. For how much longer, however, was anyone’s guess.
John separated from him just far enough to look at him. It wasn’t 1895 John anymore, but the other John, the John who stood on the tarmac with him, who Sherlock made laugh while his heart was breaking. His greying hair was plastered to his head and his well-shaved face was slick with water and his checkered shirt was soaked through. He smiled up at Sherlock, the blue of his eyes shining through the mist of the falls.
You’ve done this sort of thing before. You’re no stranger to brief hook-ups in loos, in the back corner of dark pubs or seedy nightclubs. In Afghanistan, that’s all there was, really—speedy encounters with people who weren’t important in the end, a race to orgasm before the two of you were caught. There was an excitement to it, certainly, but little else aside from that. It was what it was. You’ve done this too much to expect anything out of it aside from a hasty climax.
anything about it. Instead, Sherlock did his best to avoid the subject of his alleged death altogether, which John figured might be the smartest thing Sherlock had ever done.
Mrs. Hudson appeared at his side. “Are you really serious about that one?” she stage-whispered, gesturing vaguely towards the window, in the direction of wherever it was she assumed Gilly lurked while John wasn’t with her.
Their tender morning together, Sherlock’s presumed apology, it was all an act. John knew that. Sherlock had been nothing if not completely candid with him. The fact that John felt a bit crushed by the distance between them spoke to John’s own naïveté, he supposed.
John sucked in air, his head tipping back. He tightened his legs around Sherlock, pulling his hips up to meet his thrusts. “Oh Christ,” he said. “Yes. Yes you did.” He ran his hands down Sherlock’s back, grasping, pulling, guiding him closer, faster.
” he said. Nothing like showing up bruised and bloody to a meeting to make one’s officiant nice and confident about the happy couple.
John noticed the change in his face, of course, and fumbled with what to do with the moment. Sherlock was not particularly certain what to do with the moment either, or what to do with anything anymore for that matter. John and Mary danced away and Sherlock watched them leave, feeling as if his skin was on fire. It seemed as if all of London were on the dance floor, crowding in around him, and the room was hotter than any room had a right to be. The lights were pulsing and that song—that bloody
“Yeah,” John said to the darkness of the storage closet, nodding his head decisively, “if we get out of this alive, I am definitely,
You press yourself to a wall, breathing hard and doing your best not to think of the last time you were pressed against a wall with this man. “I still think that this is more a job for the police,” you whisper.
was certainly one way to describe the cottage, as there wasn’t much to it on the inside. The sitting room boasted a few worn sofas surrounding a fireplace, a small coffee table between them. A stockpile of wood sat next to the fireplace, and John could see candles placed about the room—for light once the sun set, it would seem. There was a kitchenette at the other side of the room, containing a sink and a small cooker. A rickety-looking table managed to wedge itself just in front of the sink, wooden chairs tucked neatly in. A narrow flight of stairs hugged the far wall, likely heading to bedrooms upstairs.
As if on cue, Sherlock clambered down the stairs, looking to be in a bit of a strop. He flopped down on one of the sofas and made a big show of checking something on his mobile.
Sherlock’s jaw tensed. He had hoped he would spend his time in 1895 looking for a murderous ghost. This was much, much worse.
“If you think about it,” Gilly said, “it makes perfect sense. We’ve been together for a while now. We love each other. We trust each other. We’ve no intentions of breaking up with each other. We’ve absolutely no desire to be with anyone else, neither of us.” She looked pointedly at John for that last bit.
“Her flat is nicer, anyway,” John said. It wasn’t. It was small and cluttered and confusingly bright and littered with so many photographs John felt as if he was being stared at by a stadium filled with Gilly’s friends and family.
“If you leave, I’ll break. It’ll break me. I’ll be broken,” Sherlock said, and John was reasonably certain he was bleeding now, or perhaps it only felt like it. His skin was on fire, the way it burns after the wind tears at it for too long.
“I’m all right,” John said. He ran his thumb over Sherlock’s cheekbone, catching a cowardly tear with the pad of his finger. “He didn’t get my femoral artery. Was nowhere near it, in fact.”
Sherlock lifted himself to his feet, a light smile on his face. “Later,” he said, guiding the both of them out the back door, towards the shower.
But Sherlock only smiled. “That’s exactly what I like about London,” he said. “That great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained.” He seemed overjoyed. “Isn’t it wonderful?”
“She’s heading north,” Sherlock said. “Somewhere too cold to travel by motorbike. Somewhere you’d need a warm jacket.”
didn’t make John feel as if a bit of him had broken off, crumbled to pieces on the pavement, and he might never be whole again.
Caring for a baby added new challenges to sleeping, but it certainly made sleep less elusive when the two found time. Sherlock noticed that sleeping was a much more desirable experience when he had John in his bed. They both learned the importance of keeping quiet so as not to wake Rosie, although the both of them struggled with the task from time to time. Sherlock—thus far—held the record for most egregious offense. On the night in question, Sherlock found himself on his back with John’s lips wrapped around his cock and his fingers moving inside him; John crooked his fingers forward just so and performed some complicated movement with his tongue that Sherlock didn’t fully understand and Sherlock came at a volume that earned him both a banging on the ceiling from Mrs. Hudson below and an irritated scream from Rosie above.
“What?” John asked. His eyes were glued to the little patch of light underneath the door, on the lookout for any shadows that might belong to a set of legs. He clutched his gun in his hands, ready to use it if the moment arose.
by accident and overlooked a fairly prominent tattoo on a victim’s wrist before Lestrade asked if he was alright and Sherlock promptly left the scene, returning home to lie in his bed alone.
Sherlock withdrew his fingers and John was grabbing for him even as he poured more oil over himself. John hitched his legs around Sherlock’s waist and Sherlock slicked himself, positioning his cock at John’s entrance. He slipped two fingers, wet with oil, back inside John and John could have hit him.
At this point, nearly half of the floor was torn up. John was relegated to the back of the bedroom, standing on the few boards that remained nailed to the ground. Sherlock tossed a bit of wood across the room in frustration. Fitz gave a little bark and chased after it.
“You lads will be sleeping upstairs,” Claire said, starting up the stairs. John and Sherlock—momentarily abandoning the head-torch—followed, the wooden steps groaning underneath their feet. There looked to be two rooms upstairs; Claire led them into one of them. “I didn’t know which room you two would prefer,” she said. “So I just chose which one I like best. The one with the bigger window. Hope that’s all right.”
“Did you see anybody come out of that building?” John gestured wildly back at 221b. “Or enter? Did you see anybody come or go?”
Mary slipped out the window with barely a sound. She was fully dressed, heavy winter coat on, trainers on her feet. Ready to run. She bent to pick up her duffel.
Mrs. Hudson floated into the room before either of them could ask her in. “Just checking to see if you boys fancied a cuppa,” she chirped. She frowned as she saw Sherlock on the table. “Sherlock,” she said, “didn’t your mother ever tell you not to climb on the furniture?”
You realize you’re still biting your arm and you let yourself go. There’s an angry ring of teeth marks on your forearm. You look like you’ve been attacked. Evidence of foul play. You turn yourself, your back collapsing against the wall. Your cock is still hanging out. You can’t work your arms. You’re breathing so hard your throat is raw. He’s panting too, wiping himself off with a handkerchief he produced from god-knows-where. He wraps a hand behind you, swiping the handkerchief along your arse. Cleaning you. You make a noise you can’t comprehend. He tugs your trousers up and his parted lips are fashioned in a smile and his eyes are the color of beaches at nighttime, the dark lure of the gentle water that you always wanted to wade into, even if it meant you’d never return.
John took a step forward on legs that were moments away from failing him. His mouth had fallen open. He wasn’t breathing again. There was a chance his heart had stopped, but he couldn’t be arsed to check on it. He opened his mouth, shut it again. He couldn’t speak.
“John,” he manages, a hoarse half-whisper that sounds like it was punched from him and the sound nearly splits you in two. You don’t understand all that is happening at the moment, don’t understand how he’s the one being fucked and you’re the one who thinks you might die from it, the one at risk of coming apart. You’re near tears, you realize. You’re seconds away from breaking down and sobbing right on top of him and you haven’t the first clue why.
John made a growling noise. He dug his forehead into the counter, not yet ready to stand up and face himself in the mirror. He pounded his fist into the tile. Once. Twice. He sucked in a sharp breath.
“Read me another one,” Sherlock said, his face still pressed to the mattress. He didn’t need to see John’s expression of confusion as he lifted his head from his screen.
Sherlock shifted back, sitting on his heels, and pulled John into his lap, John’s thighs pressed tightly around him, knees braced on the mattress. John gasped at the shift in angle but then Sherlock’s mouth was on his, an urgent kiss, all tongues and breath. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, pulled their chests together. He thrust upwards into John and John moaned against his mouth. Sherlock set a slow rhythm, pushing into John with careful, shallow strokes. John’s fingers dug into Sherlock’s shoulders and he started moving, meeting each of Sherlock’s thrusts. Sherlock could feel John’s heart pounding against him, his chest expanding into Sherlock’s with each gasp he took. John’s eyes were pressed shut and he panted into Sherlock’s mouth, no longer able to return his kisses once again. Sherlock mouthed and bit at John’s lips.
“They’re not even that irritating,” John said, “the qualities you went with. I liked the violin. It was lovely, even at half-three in the morning.”
There was more, much more. There was Mary swearing that she wasn’t running away, swearing that she wouldn’t be gone long, swearing that she would come home to the both of them as soon as she neutralized the danger, whatever the hell that meant. There was Mary forbidding John to come looking for her, forbidding him to get Sherlock involved to try to find her or help her, claiming that it would be impossible for them to find her anyway. There was Mary saying that she had a plan, don’t worry, and her plan simply involved getting as far away as possible. There was Mary begging him not to be angry with her and saying that she loved him, but by the time John got to that part of the note his head was spinning far too much to comprehend the meaning of the words.
The legs of the table squeaked against the floor. The wood groaned. Sherlock pounded into John so hard John saw stars dance before his eyes. He was saying something to Sherlock he couldn’t even hear let alone understand. The storm screamed outside, the full force of the Atlantic ready to take them at last. John needed more.
“But loads of fun,” Sherlock said, grinning as he slung his bag over his shoulder and started down the stairs.
John looked up. Sherlock stood in the doorway to the kitchen; John hadn’t even heard him leave the bedroom over Rosie’s cries. He was wearing an oversized vest and pyjama bottoms, his dressing gown open and fluttering at his sides. His hair was a right mess and it looked as if he hadn’t shaved in a few days. Still, John was tremendously happy to see him out of bed.
of all things—was somehow the most terrifying thing he had ever done, why telling Sherlock what he felt for him was the thing that would ultimately send him fleeing, tail between his legs.
He rolled on his side, looking at John. John’s breaths seemed to be slowing, and his face no longer looked quite as strained. Either the paracetamol was finally rising to the challenge, or John’s exhaustion was overcoming all else that was wrong with his body at the moment, steering him towards sleep at last. The lines on his face were starting to fade and his frown was less pronounced and his muscles were slackening and there was no limit, Sherlock realized, to what he would do for this man. He would dive in front of a machine gun to keep John safe, he would rip the bastard who did this to John from his jail cell and tear his limbs from his body, he would find a way to become a bloody sorcerer if it meant that he could have some way to heal John in this instant, to keep his body whole and free from hurt for the remainder of his days. He settled for reaching out and brushing John’s hair away from his face. It was nowhere near enough.
“Now if you don’t mind,” Sherlock said, lifting his eyes from the laptop to once again shoot John with a look that seemed out for vengeance, “I am trying to catch a serial killer. I am trying to put a killer behind bars, possibly even saving a life or two in the process. I have officially run out of time and patience for your asinine relationship dramas.”
“I never claimed all of this would be without its risks,” he says, and then he slips inside, leaving you with the choice to either follow or stand out on the street and avoid arrest.
John sludged back into consciousness with an aching head and something thick crusted over one of his eyes. Blood, he realized. The side of his forehead was wet and throbbing, still gently leaking blood over his brow and into his eye. He blinked, trying his best to work open his eyes. The light flooded into his brain and his head shouted at him. He pressed his eyes shut again.
“What about on an antique bed at your parents’ house at half-two in the morning?” John panted, his face pressed against the pillow. “Would you fuck me there?”
Next to him, Sherlock appeared to be in a meditative state. His face was focused and devoid of emotion. If he noticed John stealing glances at him as they rode out to the island, he didn’t let on. John had quite a lot he wished to say to Sherlock but absolutely no ability to put any of it into words. It was just as well—nothing John could say to Sherlock would change a thing about the situation or make it any more bearable for all involved. Silence, it seemed, was the best option.
“No,” John said, wriggling underneath Sherlock. “I don’t. Come back.” He twisted his hands, slipping them through Sherlock’s loose grip and interlocking their fingers, holding Sherlock in place. “Don’t stop.”
“Of course not,” Sherlock says. He considers. “Well. Probably not, anyway. But while he’s busy not robbing banks, we can still glean some information from him. Learn his patterns, his behaviors. See if there’s any locations he seems to be casing out. Any accomplices he seems to have. Et cetera.” He raises an eyebrow at you. “It
John sighed. He turned towards Sherlock, placing his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. “Sherlock,” he said.
“This name would be common in any of the Baltic states,” Sherlock said. “She might intend to hold onto this identity, at least for the time being.”
Sherlock leapt off the coffee table, sitting himself on the wooden surface just across from John. “Did you say Taibhse?” he asked.
“So,” John said. “We are out here, on a deserted island, possibly waiting to be killed with a bunch of sheep?”
John cried out at the touch, his body twitching, thrusting against Sherlock’s palm involuntarily. The bed creaked loudly beneath him.
“What case are you writing up?” Sherlock asked, ignoring John’s question in favor of inquiring about the only thing of even a fraction of interest in the room. He rolled along the bed, only stopping once he was properly tangled in the sheets and staring at John upside-down.
“Did you want to?” Mary asked. “Get on the plane with him, that is? Go off with him on whatever adventure he had planned, even if it meant the both of your deaths?”
“You want this,” Sherlock said, mostly to the floor. “And I want you to be happy. I’ve done enough to make you unhappy. I want to fix that.”
“That sure was something, now wasn’t it?” Mrs. Hudson said. “Don’t know how you boys do that every other week. I think I’ll make myself a cuppa and have a little rest.” With that, she disappeared inside her flat.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He seemed thrown off by the abrupt change in conversation. He was on-guard, shields up.
“It’s the only way, John,” Sherlock said. “I can find out who’s after her. I can fix her problem. I can protect her, keep her safe from danger. Her and Rosie,” Sherlock swallowed, “and you.”
Sherlock’s legs wrapped around John’s shoulders, his heels digging into John’s back. He sunk his fingers into John’s hair, feeling his head as it moved frantically against Sherlock. John’s hair was still damp from the shower, and his skin was warm, so warm, on Sherlock’s hands. However, if John was warm then Sherlock was a bonfire, an explosion, the cool blue flames that melt metal. He was something violent and combustible and dangerous.
“Sherlock,” John said. Against all of his better judgment, he reached out a hand. He touched at Sherlock’s arm, hanging limp at his side. He ran his fingers along Sherlock’s arm—gentle, timid. Sherlock looked towards the touch, studying it.
You’ve got a decent mental map of the city, but even you’re starting to lose your sense of where the hell you are. By now, the streets are getting smaller and there are fewer pedestrians to dodge. It’s a bit easier to get a read on people walking the same path as the two of you. It’s mostly people on their mobiles, headphones plugged into their ears, unlikely to lift their head if the world was falling down around them, but there’s someone else too. A lean man with ginger hair, quite a ways ahead of the two of you.
Sherlock opened his eyes, little drops of moisture sticking to his eyelashes. John had that look to him again, like Sherlock was some sort of precious thing, but Sherlock must have been mistaken about that look because in no version of reality was he deserving of that sort of reverence at the moment.
Even more seals flopped out of the water, feeling safe now that their braver brethren had not been attacked by the strangers on the shore. They slid across the slick sand on their bellies until they found an acceptable spot to rest. The beach was nearly full again, with most of the horde having returned from the water to rest themselves in the sand. Another wave drifted through the beach and the lot of them lifted their heads to avoid the water. A nearby seal rolled onto its side, waving its flipper in the air.
“Okay,” John said. He moved forward, pressing a hand against Sherlock’s cheek. He forced his hand to rest for just a moment, scrutinizing Sherlock’s expression, making certain that he was not about to flee. Then he pressed their lips together, slow and soft. Chaste. Sherlock allowed the kiss to happen and even moved his lips slightly against John’s, but he was guarded, shields up. John ended the kiss but remained near, his nose brushing against Sherlock’s. If Sherlock would let him, John would kiss him all night. He would never stop kissing him.
The sheep wasn’t particularly hard to find—it could be seen just after they climbed the hill—a spot of red amongst the green. Once they were closer, it was clear that the sheep suffered the same fate as the five currently featured in photographs on the walls of 221B Baker Street. The sheep was sliced open along its undersides and ripped apart, much of what used to be inside the sheep hastily thrown outside. A considerable number of flies buzzed around the body.
His eyes look like they can see underneath your skin, into the very center of you. “You certainly are,” he says, and goddamnit it makes you
John still lay on his back in the bed, his head tilted towards Sherlock. His eyes were open, watching him.
“It does a thing to a person,” Gilly said. “It completely ruins your faith in humanity. It makes it impossible to trust anybody. Everybody is so disloyal, just a bunch of liars and cheats.”
“Good,” Sherlock said. He closed his eyes, starting to drift again. “And put the bedside table back.”
Darren and Conor—mostly Darren—helped the two of them unload the bits of food Sherlock had miraculously managed to obtain during his trip to the mainland. They didn’t stay much longer after getting the supplies off the boat—Darren was understandably wary about having his son spend extended time on an island where there had recently been a sheep-murderer spotted. Conor gave Fitz a hug goodbye and strict instructions to be a good guard-dog, and the two trotted down the hill and popped back into their boat. Conor waved goodbye from the stern as they disappeared in the distance.
Sherlock did his best to smile, which proved to be a feat. He didn’t quite get it right in the end. “I’ll be expecting a lolly from you after the visit,” he said.
John peered into the open cavity at the center of the body on the table, never so eager to get to the bottom of an empty rotted corpse in his life. “So,” he said. “The black market? For
Sherlock lifted his head. He opened his eyes. He looked in the direction of the noise. There was, of course, a chance that he actually did none of those things and merely continued lying along his side on the piss-stained mattress, existing in varying states of unconsciousness, but for the sake of argument Sherlock was willing to say that he looked up.
“More common than you think,” John said, recalling an astounding number of internet dates he’d experienced where, midway through, his date admitted to this very lie.
Sherlock lowered himself over John, moving their faces together until their lips were nearly touching. John could feel the tickle of Sherlock’s breath on his mouth and he nudged forward, trying to catch him. Sherlock moved back slightly, dodging John’s lips with a small smile.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock said. He stepped off the sofa and onto the coffee table. His fingers were pressed over his lips. “Regardless, a large piece of this mystery would have been found in those missing pages.”
Sherlock swept past him, slipping into the bedroom, and John certainly did not sneak a glance at the way the little drops of water slid down the curve of Sherlock’s arse. The deep, woody scent of Sherlock shampoo drifted through the air behind him and John almost choked on it. He clambered down the stairs, nearly tripping over himself as he exited the cottage and burst into the loo.
Something about this was more difficult for Sherlock to find funny. Instead, it made his stomach throb and gave him an awfully odd taste in his mouth.
Mrs. Hudson,” John said, staring at Gilly’s lifeless body. She appeared to still be alive, breathing shallowly, but she was bleeding profusely from her head and her jaw seemed broken.
John placed a hand on Sherlock’s wrist, gentle yet commanding. “C’mon,” he said. “Can’t reach where he hit you with your hand in the way.”
Now, Sherlock rid himself of his pants so quickly it was nearly a magic trick and slipped into bed even faster, barely allowing John a second to glimpse his bare skin. He moved silently, without causing even a shift in the mattress as he slid under the blankets. He seemed to be doing his best to respect John’s space, keeping even so much as a strand of hair as far from John’s side of the bed as he could. He caught John’s eye, and for a moment he seemed as if he were wrestling with saying something rather important.
have his way in this situation and immediately eliminated the first dozen or so comforting-John plans that came to mind.
. It consumes you, he said, your entire body is filled with need. You didn’t understand at the time but you’re starting to think you might.
Sherlock made another moaning noise that didn’t communicate anything in particular, but John seemed to understand anyway. Sherlock tilted his head closer to John, making it easier for John to reach his aching head with the ice pack.
.” He cleared his throat, his tone switching back to neutral, nonchalant. “It was the end of it, anyway. Mycroft intervened after that, prevented the gangsters from carrying through with the long-term aspects of their plan. I came back to London. You know the rest.”
John took a deep breath. “You have to know, Sherlock, before you decide anything—and you know better than anyone, I suppose—that I’ve got baggage. Loads of it. I’ve got an infant daughter back home and she’s brilliant and amazing but she’s a
John did, and nearly immediately because he was, of course, exhausted. And of course, he dreamed of Sherlock, standing on the rooftop at Barts while John looked up at him from below, pitching himself off the side of the building and falling to his death again and again and again.
And John went harder, fucking himself on Sherlock’s cock with all he had. Sherlock thrust up into him, pounding into his arse with violence, knocking the breath from John’s lungs over and over and over. It was like plowing through angry waves again, undulating and tumultuous. It was dangerous but John was sturdy. He crashed down against Sherlock and his hull shuddered but he would hold together through it all. He was built for this.
John followed, doing his best to keep quiet. “I’m not...blaming…” Even he knew it wasn’t quite true.
In the end, John could hardly fault Sherlock for his jabs at John’s dubious conquests. John had certainly done his fair share of dating over the past few years, and he hadn’t felt anything particularly noteworthy for any of the people he dated. Gilly excluded, he supposed. Still, he prickled at this fact being thrown in his face in such a careless manner, and he
Will remained kneeling for just a moment. His mouth flopped open and eyes grew dazed. A prim little circle bloomed red in the center of his forehead. Then he crumpled, his body falling in on itself, revealing the devastation that used to be the back of his skull. He hit the ground with a splat.
Sherlock held tight to John’s leg. John was warm against him, the only thing tethering him to this world in more ways than one. John’s gaze was elsewhere, and Sherlock missed his eyes. “I don’t know what I’d do either, John,” he said. His voice was only slightly louder than the occasional whirr of a car outside.
John came with Sherlock pressed against him, with Sherlock’s moans filling his ears as he pounded into him one, two, three more times and spent deep inside him. Sherlock kissed at him and John pulled Sherlock close and the both of them gasped and whimpered and breathed and neither of them, not once, not even for a second, thought about the Monty Hall problem.
“Hmm,” John said, doing his best to ignore how little space remained between the two of them at the moment. “Rather adamant about remaining ghosts, it seems.”
“Right,” you say. You pat your waistband, where your gun is currently tucked. “And we aren’t calling the police becau—” but his hand claps over your mouth and he is shushing you before you get a chance to finish. You hear a soft grating noise and follow his gaze up to the ceiling, where a tile is being slowly pulled upwards.
“Considering how much I ought to have harmed him for putting a bullet in my mate,” the man spat into the mobile, “I’d say he is in perfect condition at the moment. Now. The flash drive, Mister Holmes. You have it?”
“I believe the papers call me the Holiday Killer,” Gilly said. “Dreadful name. Not sure I would have picked it for myself. But then, the papers so rarely ask serial killers for their preferred name. I suppose it could have been worse.”
“I owe you an apology, John,” Sherlock said. His voice was so quiet that for a moment John wasn’t sure he heard it at all.
John’s finger moved inside of him and it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t big enough, it wasn’t long enough, it wasn’t deep enough, it wasn’t
but that was likely because it felt as if the entirety of his groin was throbbing. He was sure Sherlock didn’t mean it like that. Sherlock didn’t know how John was practically squirming in his seat, the front of his pyjamas tented, the heat from his erection emanating through the thin fabric and warming his hand.
“Catherine,” John said. “It was my grandmother’s name. I always thought—” he scratched at his head. “I’d always wanted—if I ever became a dad, had a daughter… I thought it’d be nice to name a child after her.”
“Caretakers usually live just above the café,” Darren said, “but we’re setting you two up in one of the guest cottages, seeing as…” he shrugged, “you know.”
Black Jacket arrives at a storefront—Hal’s Electronics. The place is still closed up for the night, and he crouches low to unlock the gate and lifts the thing with a clatter. He unlocks the shop and steps inside. The little
“I know,” Sherlock said. John couldn’t quite read his tone. The two stood there for just a second longer before Sherlock released him, and they continued walking.
“But he’s not asking,” John said, his voice catching. “And he doesn’t want me to. Or at least, I don’t think he does.” He shook his head. “I don’t know. Half the time I haven’t the foggiest idea what goes on in that great bloody brain of his. Sometimes I think he does. Want this, that is. With me. But other times…” He looked down at Lucy, trying to catch her eye. “You’ve been here this whole time. What do you think?”
“That’s about right,” John said, and set off towards the field. Wherever Sherlock had gotten off to on the island, John was likely to find him. That was one perk of being stranded in a spot less than six kilometers long—if you’ve lost track of someone, they could never have gotten very far.
John cursed and his head drooped low, forehead colliding with Sherlock’s. He didn’t feel it, could only feel the ache pounding through his body and Sherlock’s finger.
John pulled out a novel he brought with him and pretended to read. It didn’t even bother him very much when he hadn’t turned a page in over ten minutes. He figured staring at a book while waiting for Sherlock to text was slightly less pathetic than staring at his mobile while waiting for Sherlock to text. If the serial killer was spying on him at the moment, John had a feeling that he would be spared out of sheer pity.
Sherlock’s middle finger dipped just below John’s waistband. “You’d be much more convincing,” Sherlock said, “if you weren’t so aroused at the moment.”
John thought. He urged himself forward with the lovely thoughts of what he might do once he got his hands on the bastard. His legs pumped their way up the hill. Just a little more…
“Why we insist upon huddling together at the arse-end of the year simply to delude ourselves into believing that the appropriation of a pagan holiday into the birthday of an infant deity means that for a singular day humankind is kind and giving instead of a bunch of self-serving morons,” Sherlock said, “is utterly beyond me.”
“Morning,” Sherlock said, although by his estimates it was approximately half-four—literally morning, but not in keeping with the spirit of the greeting.
Sherlock hated himself, but he was gone now—beyond even his own control. He grasped John’s arse with both hands and pulled him down against his pelvis, grinding against John’s cock with as much strength as his heavy limbs could muster. John moaned, the sound vibrating against Sherlock’s lips, and Sherlock felt the whole of his body shake from it. He rocked his hips up against John, feeling his cock stiffen further inside his trousers. John moved with him, rutting against Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock could feel John’s breathing quicken, panting against his mouth, turning his kisses sloppy.
John flipped through the journal. In Sherlock’s brief scan through the pages, he had managed to retain more information than John had.
“Indeed,” Sherlock said. He slipped his hand around John’s waist as he waved at Hugh. His grip was much looser than usual, and his arm felt limp on John’s hips. John ran a hand along Sherlock’s back, taking advantage of whatever moments he had remaining to do so.
“No,” Sherlock said, “but the war mattered to you. And you fear the firefight that brought it to an end, the unforgiving tedium that followed.”
John patted his trouser pockets. He hadn’t even thought to check to be sure he still had his mobile, wallet, keys. Thankfully, he felt all of them. He pulled his mobile out of his pocket, wincing in anticipation of what he might discover. He was out well past the hour he told Mary he’d return by and hadn’t thought to offer any sort of warning that he might be out later than expected after he’d left the pub in a panic. He couldn’t imagine this would put Mary in any sort of better mood. However, when he checked his mobile, he only saw two texts from Lestrade—lengthy apologies, the both of them—and nothing from Mary.
Sherlock made a little muttering noise. The silence fell between the two of them again, and John considered that the next nine hours were about to feel exceptionally long.
he knew—that Sherlock didn’t go in for things like that, for relationships. Still, there was something captivating about that fake version of Sherlock, something that set off a feeling in John’s chest that felt remarkably like yearning.
Sherlock strode over to the wall, his dressing gown flapping behind him, revealing the same pyjamas he had worn for three days. He climbed onto the sofa and began affixing the new photographs to the wall. “Five,” he said. “Five mutilated sheep.”
Sherlock affixed the last of the photographs to the wall and surveyed his work, his shirt dropping back down to cover his stomach. “I told them you needed a…” he waved his hand in a little circle, “mental health day. Or seven.”
“Unreasonable behavior,” John said, “is when a person behaves in such a way that their spouse cannot be expected to continue on in the marriage. A fairly broad concept, that—anything your spouse has done that makes it impossible for you to live with them anymore.” He focused on the whiskey glass, glittering in the candlelight.
. But I’ve never…” Sherlock waved his hand, gesturing with the needle holder. “I’ve never...on a person who…”
Sherlock shifted against John, pushing him forward. His torso was draped over John at this point, nearly half his weight resting on John’s head and shoulders. “You’ll also notice,” Sherlock said, “that many of the people in agreement with my position have doctoral degrees. Prominent mathematicians, John.”
“Yeah?” John’s grin was spread across the whole of his face. “I’m not the one getting us kicked out of client’s flats, passing out on the floor.”
Ah well, John thought. He could worry about all that later. Sherlock would be home soon, and he would like to get this phone call out of the way beforehand.
), but also because you can’t shake the feeling that you know this man. You’ve seen him before somehow. You tell yourself that he must just have one of those faces, but that isn’t quite right because he
“What else you got in these things?” he asked. He lifted out a little square device with a tube at one end. He held it up for Sherlock to see, his face a question mark.
He tugged Sherlock up his chest, pressing their lips together. Sherlock couldn’t taste an ounce of regret on John’s tongue.
John laughed, the sound lifting onto the wind and dancing with the rain. He clutched at Sherlock, holding him tight as the seals filled the beach around them. The raindrops thickened, drawing little circles on the pale sand, slapping against the backs of the seals. John only laughed harder, only held Sherlock tighter.
“Sherlock.” John stopped again, fingernails digging into wallpaper once more. “Please. Let me keep the single shred of dignity I have left. I beg of you.” With that, he heaved himself up the ninth step and up onto the landing. The two shifted on the landing, and John stared up at the remaining steps in front of them. His shoulders slumped.
Darren met them halfway down the hill, jogging towards them as if he did this sort of thing all the time, which John reasoned he likely did. He took John’s place at the woman’s side, allowing the woman to drape her arm over his shoulder. “I can get you into the dinghy,” he said. The three of them started off down the rest of the hill, Fitz joining and running in interested little circles around them, wondering what strange game the humans were playing.
“I don’t care,” John snapped. “I don’t care where the footprints are. I don’t care that you can’t see them from the path. You’ll just have to bloody
You find the man creeping back into your mind, the man who wasn’t really homeless, who doesn’t have a twisted lip. The seven pounds he gave you, you still have it in your jacket pocket. You fiddle with the coins when you’ve nothing else to do. You run your fingers over the ridged metal and think about those eyes, those eyes that seemed to see you.
A woman walked down the street, immersed in her mobile. John jogged up to her, barely noticing how she startled as he popped up at her side in a flurry of words.
John managed something like a smile. “Okay,” he said. He released Sherlock, leaning back and gripping the toilet seat once more. “Forceps. Grab the edge of the wound.” He nodded towards Sherlock, a little jerk of his chin. “You can do this.”
“Hardly,” Sherlock said, tracing a finger along the red mark. The sutures had been removed weeks ago and the wound healed nicely. Still, there was a raised mark that showed exactly where the cut had been. The scar was smooth and pink and new and reminded Sherlock of hurt, of John cursing and bleeding in their flat. Sherlock kissed at the mark, running his tongue along the raised skin. He heard John take in a breath above him. John’s cock gave a twitch as Sherlock’s mouth moved against his skin.
“Sherlock.” John tried to look at Sherlock through the darkness. He couldn’t even see the outline of his face.
,” John said, “you and I are in total agreement.” He switched off the cooker and began to retrieve plates and utensils from the cupboard. He handed them to Rosie and she darted back to the sitting room to set the table.
ness. Sherlock considered how the brain processes olfactory memories differently than other memories. Regular memories—the stories one remembers about one’s first day of school and what an isosceles triangle is and how to get to the bloody Tesco—they all get stored in the hippocampus, the space in the brain meant to hold memories. Olfactory memories—the associations one has with smells, smells of rain and formaldehyde and cigarette smoke and a very particular brand of cheap cologne—they get stored in the amygdala, the space in the brain responsible for emotion. As such, these memories came wrapped in sentiment, with a bow of pain. Sherlock figured this was the reason why when he collapsed into his bed and smelled John on his sheets he felt as if his throat were being ripped out. He figured this was also the reason why just the memory of John’s scent was making his pulse quicken, his breathing stutter, his skin tingle. His cock harden.
“Am not,” John said before he could stop himself. He wasn’t shy, not exactly. He was mostly caught off guard. He knew Sherlock was shamming—hell, he had
Sherlock’s free hand was running along his side, across his back, down his arse. There was almost a reverence to his touch, something like care. “Not enough lubrication for much more,” he said. “I’ll hurt you.” His finger moved inside John with precision, as if he had learned the whole of John’s body already.
Mrs. Hudson’s eyes were wide. She looked as if John just told her he believed the earth was flat and run by lizard-people. “If you truly believe that,” she said, “you’re an even bigger idiot than I thought, John Watson.” She shook her head, done with him. “I hope you’re happy with yourself. And that
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Please,” he said. “At least I’m not so foolish as to chase after a ridiculous concept that has caused nothing but strife. Nothing but failure.” He gestured at the journal again. “Nothing but
“Oh?” Sherlock’s arms were still wrapped around him, his chest pressed against John’s back. John would find it hard to concentrate in a moment.
“Her fiancé was just as bad,” Sherlock said, clicking on his page. “In this picture he claims he bench-pressed two hundred pounds when in fact it was no more than one eighty-five. Here he is posing with a car he doesn’t own.
, mind you. In the middle of the bloody kitchen. Something about testing the capacity of innards to withstand heat. Didn’t think there might be gasses trapped inside the bloated stomach of a dead pig.”
. You aren’t the type for unsafe sex, and you’ve certainly seen enough grizzly genitals at the surgery to keep you on the up and up. You keep a condom in your
John kept up the movement of his fingers along Sherlock’s back, a movement he intended to continue until told to stop, no matter how his hands shook. “And if I didn’t?” John asked, his voice so quiet it was barely sound. “Want that?”
might have predicted. Sherlock was rather skilled at predictions. Hence why John’s ankle was battered at the moment, while Sherlock’s was just fine.
“Daughter,” Sherlock said, not even glancing backwards to observe John’s actions. “The child’s mother is absent from the image, no photographs of her to be seen. A separation—divorce, likely—and not a very kind one, either. The photograph is fairly recent, so the separation must have occurred less than a year before Declan took this job. Declan must have been in the wrong during the separation—he harbors a sense of guilt and obligation towards his estranged child. Hence, the placement of the photograph in his personal quarters so that he may look at it regularly but not so close to his bed that it is the last thing he sees before sleep each night. Internal conflict. Sentiment.” Sherlock closed the dresser drawer and opened another. “Dull.”
Sherlock threw his head back and stomped his foot and for a moment looked so much like Rosie about to have a tantrum that John considered putting him in time-out. “
“It will be quiet,” Sherlock said, “what you’re listening for. Remember, he’s broken the locks on the windows. He’ll sneak in silently. Be on alert.” Sherlock’s lips moved with his words, brushing gently against John.
“We could,” Sherlock said, a flash of mystery glinting in his eye. “Or we could take a more direct approach.”
touch wherever he wanted. John ran his hands along Sherlock’s back, feeling each bump of his vertebrae. It took all of his self-control not to dip his hands lower, to grab at Sherlock’s arse. He had long since grown hard, his cock straining in his trousers. He wriggled slightly, trying to keep his back flat on the sofa, his groin away from Sherlock. Surely
Which, of course, was unfortunate, because John needed to forget. He shouldn’t even have known in the first place. He wasn’t meant to know—it wasn’t right. Mary was at home waiting for him and he wasn’t meant to love anyone like this except her. However, at the moment, all he could think about was Sherlock and the way those beautiful eyes were making him want to cry.
“Good,” Sherlock said. Slowly, so slowly, he withdrew his cock from John, slipping back inside at an agonizing pace. John sucked in a ragged breath, his head dropping lower against the wall. Sherlock heard a moan escape his own lips, an involuntary noise that seemed to come from a part of himself with whom Sherlock was not particularly well-acquainted. Again he sank into John and again that part of himself moaned; there was a correlation there but Sherlock didn’t care one bit. John felt too good. “Fuck,” he muttered, squeezing his eyes closed. He couldn’t look at John, not when John’s arsehole was stretched around his cock, not if he didn’t want to come immediately and with a scream sure to wake the whole of London.
didn’t feel like who I was meant to…” John ran a hand over his mouth. “I didn’t want to be married to her, not really. I thought I did, but…” He sighed. “I loved her, but...not enough. It wasn’t enough. And I couldn’t fake it. I couldn’t even fake it for six months, and I sure as hell couldn’t fake it for the rest of my life.”
“All day, then?” John checked his watch. It was half-two in the afternoon. He did the math. He grimaced.
“Three minutes,” Sherlock said. “If he had severed the femoral artery, that is how long it would have taken you to bleed out. Three minutes.”
John chuckled. He ran a hand up Sherlock’s back. “You hate it,” he said. “You wish you were down there.”
John turned down the heat on the cooker, allowing the curry to simmer. “Sherlock,” he said. “You don’t need to explain to me what the Monty Hall problem is. At this point, I could recite the bloody thing in my sleep.”
“It’s because you type like a gran who has only recently woken up from a coma,” Sherlock said. “You need to take one of those typing courses I keep showing you.”
“I know,” John said, but he couldn't remove his hand from Sherlock’s hair, couldn’t stop the slow movement of his fingers in the soft curls.
Unfortunately, he had no idea how he could manage the feat of finding her or where to even start looking. He couldn’t manage it, of course. Not without help.
“Agreed,” John said. He scratched at his head, looking away. “Um,” he said. “In the interest of honesty. And since we’re to be married soon…”
“There are precisely twenty variants of eye color,” he says. “Some would argue it’s as low as six. Statistically speaking, no eye color is
John never considered that the burning in his chest, his throat, his eyes, could possibly feel so wonderful. “I’ll hold you to that,” he said.
John stepped forward. He felt oddly as if he were stepping into battle—shoulders square, body a tense line. His hands were fists at his sides, clutching onto nothing as if he could physically prevent himself from speaking. Mary’s cool eyes stared back at him, her face placid. Waiting.
A little smile twitched over John’s face. Completely involuntary. He scooped his own forkful into his mouth.
John felt as if his throat were in danger of closing in. For him, it felt as if everything had changed, although in a different sort of way nothing had changed at all. It felt as if he were finally seeing the world correctly, the way it had always been. Being with Sherlock, it felt like returning to a home that had always been there waiting for him. Just waiting, while John had been dallying in the street.
Pissed as he was at Mary at the moment, he did not want to think about how close she just came to being blown to pieces.
dreams; in fact, most of them weren’t. Some of them were the nightmare kind, the kind where Sherlock fell from the roof at Barts or was shot in the chest or stood in front of a flaming Appledore with half a dozen rifle sights trained on him and a lifeless Magnussen staring at them with dead eyes. Some of them were surprisingly normal, just John and Sherlock sitting together at Baker Street or sharing a cab or peering at a body in the morgue at Barts. Once John dreamed of Sherlock playing violin, a lovely piece John always remembered Sherlock playing while he thought. He woke up from that dream with a smile on his face and Mary asked him what he was so happy about. He told her he didn’t remember.
But John wasn’t quite listening because the whole of Sherlock’s body was exposed now, long and pale and glistening from the shower. John grabbed at the counter behind him, currently the only thing preventing him from crossing the room and putting his hands on every part of Sherlock he could reach and his mouth on the parts his hands couldn’t quite get to.
Sherlock tugged at John’s hand, slid it off of his face. He squeezed it into his own, holding it tight in the space between them that seemed to be increasing in size. “My sources tell me that Mary might be laying low outside of the city,” he said. “Likely on one of the small islands just off the coast.” He opened his eyes but didn’t seem capable of making eye contact at the moment, choosing instead to stare at John’s hand, still clasped inside of his. “We’ll find her here. Soon. Then the two of you can go home together.”
John chuckled. He was barely paying attention, watching the light dance on the rocks above. Beads of water dripped down, landing into the sea with a near silent
“Hurry up,” Sherlock said as soon as John answered the phone. “Darren will take us around the island in the boat. We need you to show us where you saw the man leave the island.”
John twisted his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, moaning against his mouth. Sherlock rolled the both of them over, moving so he was on top of John, a thigh pressed between his legs. Sherlock could feel John’s heart hammering against him, but John’s hands were steady as they moved down Sherlock’s body. John writhed underneath Sherlock, rocking his hips against him. The two were out of breath when they separated.
Sherlock hunched over the journal once more, scribbling lightly over the page with the edge of the lead. John peered over his shoulder, watching the page turn from white to grey.
Sherlock stepped closer to the edge of the rocks. The flash drive dangled by its string in his hand. “You’ll return John to me,” he said, the command still having a hint of a question to it. “Once you have the drive.”
. Still, John’s cock was quite interested in this train of thought and had grown plump between his legs, raising weightlessly in the warm water.
“What’s that?” one of the receptionists at the surgery asks you one day. She points to your arm. You still have your sleeves rolled up from the last time you washed your hands, not thinking.
And Sherlock slipped down his body, sliding between his legs and tugging John forward until John was straddling his torso, thighs tucked under Sherlock’s armpits. John didn’t have time to react to any of it because his cock was in Sherlock’s mouth, Sherlock sucking him down greedily, lips wrapped around him, taking him in as deep as he could. John made a sound that seemed to bounce from the stone walls that surrounded them and pitched forward over Sherlock, holding himself up by the elbows, pulsing his hips between Sherlock’s mouth, his fingers. Sherlock wrapped a hand around John’s hip, pulling him closer, and John tucked a palm under Sherlock’s head to support him as he moved against John faster, faster.
Moriarty was dead, shot in the head by his own gun. Sir Eustice was dead, stabbed in the heart with an ornate dagger. Emelia Ricoletti—the Bride—was dead as well, dead and long since rotted in her grave. However, Sherlock wasn’t dead, no matter how he tried. Sherlock would live through all of this, brain firing and blood pumping and heart wrenching itself out of his body. He didn’t care about Moriarty. He didn’t care about Sir Eustice or the Bride or any of it. There was only one thing in this whole business that he found interesting and he had it in his arms at the moment, pressed against his lips and gasping into his mouth.
“Introduced by a mutual acquaintance,” Sherlock said. “We were both looking for a flatmate at the time. The acquaintance thought we’d work well together.” He glanced up at John, and John couldn’t tell if the look in his eyes was genuine or not. “He was right.”
John was next to him, lilting close to a store window as he tripped down the pavement. His eyes weren’t fully working, which was not a helpful way to go about walking. “Mmm,” he said.
Market Square in Keswick was another quintessential English-countryside stop, with narrow streets, ancient stone buildings, and wall-to-wall tourists. It reminded John why he elected to avoid holidays in the English countryside.
Sherlock turned his head from the sea then, his eyes—bluer than anything on the island that day—locking onto John’s. There was something unspoken in Sherlock’s gaze, hints of litanies of words and fields of knowledge that would break John to pieces were Sherlock to share. John could feel himself getting swept away, lost at sea, and Sherlock hadn’t said a single word.
He knocked his knee into the bedframe as he stumbled back into bed, but he didn’t care, sinking onto the mattress and pulling the blankets up to his chin. He had never been so pleased to see nothing in all of his life. Across the room, Sherlock made a little noise that might have been
John stood, a jumble of disparate bodily sensations, staring at his keys on the table. One of them left a little scratch in the wood. He ground his teeth together. “Sherlock has a girlfriend,” John said. “Did you know that?” This came out rather more accusatory than he meant. Angry, almost. John wasn’t particularly sure what that was all about.
The drone drifts into the vault and the two of you follow as far as the door, peering inside. Lining the floor of the vault are several small plastic bags, the kind they give you at corner shops. The light is dim, but each bag appears to be filled with money. The drone lowers itself closer to one of the bags and starts moving back and forth, trying to thread its hook into the loops of the bag.
While John popped into town to buy the two of them just enough food to keep them from starving at the cottage, Sherlock had spent most of the afternoon and evening in a deep investigation of the various social media accounts of each of the victims, trying to glean information regarding commonalities and general patterns of behavior, especially immediately before their murder. John returned to find Sherlock complaining about the quantity of posts left by their mourning friends and family that cluttered up the accounts, forcing John to remind Sherlock multiple times about the notion of
Sleep was unpredictable these days. Sometimes it descended upon him like fog and he woke days later, the seam of the sofa cushion imprinted upon his cheek and Mrs. Hudson hovering over him with a worried face. Other times it evaded him completely and he was left awake for what felt like years, staring at the walls or the ceiling or the floor or Mrs. Hudson’s worried face. It was maddening. It hadn’t yet stopped him from trying, however, and he was currently laying in his bed, staring defiantly at the ceiling. He held his mobile in his hand. He was
“Temporarily dead,” Sherlock said, all eyes on his mobile. “I’ve got some German contacts too, but more centralized in Hamburg. Never quite made it to Frankfurt, I’m afraid. Pity. I hear the Alte Oper is lovely. So.” He looked up at John and grinned, that pretending-to-be-a-sociopath grin. “Fingers crossed for Amsterdam.”
As such, it seemed like the wisest move was to not take on cases for the moment. This was for the best, considering Sherlock’s willingness to engage in voluntary movement was at an all-time low. He found himself coming around to an understanding of Mycroft’s distaste for legwork; legs were supremely overrated. Still, this left Sherlock with very little to do with his free time except wait for sleep to choose to grace him with its presence and
Sherlock grunted. “Not just yet. As I said, they’re all nonsensical.” He frowned, shaking his head. “Whatever his reasons, he’s desperate. So desperate that he would slaughter a sheep knowing that two caretakers are still on the island. So desperate that he would sneak onto the island in the middle of a storm.” He stood, his eyes still on the sheep.
Fitz—tail flying through the air—brought the bit of wood back to Sherlock in his teeth, wiggling and grinning.
The red-and-green lights of the dance floor flashed around them and that bloody song played and Sherlock stumbled over his words telling Mary about her own pregnancy and John smiled up at Sherlock with that beaming smile and if Sherlock had known it would have made him remember, that
this?” you call after him, but he’s too high up the building to hear you. You pace a bit in the alley, unsure if you should follow him. This all seems mad, objectively mad. Your mobile is in your pocket, and you wonder if you should go ahead and call the police.
“God is an arbitrary construct invented by humans to ameliorate the distress of their own inevitable and meaningless mortality,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock made another whimpering noise into John’s hair. He sunk his nose further against John’s scalp. His face felt wet.
“You leer,” Sherlock said. “Your respiration increases by ten percent and you get the faintest of flushes in your cheeks. Not to mention, your trousers—”
“I can fucking handle him,” his mate said. His words were a bit slurred. “I took out the sprinter we had back at that petrol station years back, remember? When he was a hundred meters away and I had a bloody broken arm.”
“Wow,” Hugh said. “So you two lived together before you…” He waved his hands together in a complicated manner.
John’s head was dumb and floundering, sparking in confusion at all that transpired. He had been sure—he had been so sure—that last night had meant something between him and Sherlock. He must have been wrong, very wrong. Sherlock certainly seemed to think he was wrong. Sherlock seemed to think quite a lot of things about him, and none of them were close to anything that could be called
“How are things going at the cottage?” Gilly asked. She was on a break at work, lounging back in her office chair. John could see her little knick knacks—little miniatures of cats, photographs of her and some friends on holiday by a waterfall, a tape dispenser shaped like a high heel—scattered about her desk in the background of the video call. Gilly wore a large blue bow in her hair today. Between that and her pink dress, she looked at least five years younger. John, on the other hand, felt old and a bit discombobulated.
His therapist told him that these patterns of thinking were unhelpful and inaccurate. She told him that they were colored by hindsight bias, and he was expecting himself to have utilized knowledge he never possessed in the moment. She told him that he acted as best as he could have in the situation, given everything. She told him to forgive himself.
John lowered the forceps to Sherlock’s skin, lifting up the very edge of his wound. He pushed the tiny needle into the skin, threading the suture through as gently as he could. Sherlock flinched, sucking in air and pressing his eyes shut.
“If I could,” Sherlock said, “I would very much like to remove you of any sense of obligation you feel to discuss it. Immediately.”
John rubbed his eyes, thinking that he might owe Sherlock an apology. At this point, he figured that he owed Sherlock a
“Do you think I ever could be?” John asked. “Happy, that is? If I find the person I’m meant to be with, the person I could love enough, could I be happy? Or am I too…”
” He swallowed, the photographs stilling in his hands. He glanced at John with an almost regretful expression before averting his gaze back to the photograph in his hands, pretending to scrutinize it in great detail.
John nodded, forehead still pressed to Sherlock’s. He was sweating. They both were. He needed something inside him. Needed Sherlock inside him.
“Right,” Sherlock said, locating the packet and tearing it open. He managed to work a fresh pair of gloves onto his hands without spilling everything everywhere. It felt as if his heart was trying to climb out of his throat.
“You won’t be,” Sherlock said. He gripped at John’s hair. He pressed their foreheads together, nuzzled at his cheeks, his nose, his lips. “I promise you, John,” he said. “You won’t be. Never again.”
“John seems to think,” Sherlock continued, “that one increases one’s odds of winning the car if one switches one’s choice to the remaining door after the host reveals a door containing a goat.”
Mrs. Hudson threw back her head, as if John just made the cleverest of jokes. “You know he doesn’t go for that sort of thing,” she said. “Girlfriends.”
“Picturesque,” John repeated. He didn’t have a lot of other words at the moment. Pretending to be Sherlock’s boyfriend—hell, pretending that he and Sherlock weren’t in a strop that seemed to be in the process of breaking John’s heart—was exhausting enough without an audience.
John’s eyes snapped up to meet his. His face looked in danger of folding in on itself. “Don’t,” he said. “Don’t you dare.”
Listen. With the first choice you make, there is a one-third chance that the car is behind the door you chose and a two-thirds chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors.” He gestured at imaginary doors with a firm strike of his hand that had Molly flinching slightly. “After the host shows you the goat behind one of the remaining doors, he eliminates that door as a possibility. That means that there is now a two-thirds chance that the car is behind the remaining door and a one-third chance that the car is behind the door you first chose.
“Right,” John said. “Married to his work. Sentiment is a chemical defect. All that.” How could he forget? Sherlock had made his lack of interest in romantic relationships—and romantic relationships with John in particular—abundantly clear the first day they met. He had certainly seen to it that John possessed no confusion on the topic. Message received.
“Right,” Sherlock said. The saline splashed onto the floor in little droplets as he wet a piece of gauze.
“Is dead,” John said. “He’s dead. You saw him die. He’s not alive. He’s not back. And you know that, Holmes.”
“Well, yes.” Sherlock considered. “That would be the most ideal scenario. But unfortunately, given our line of work, it doesn’t seem highly probable.”
Sherlock looked at John as if he were the simplest of children. “Whoever is looking for her likely already knows her married name. She wouldn’t be so daft as to purchase a ticket in her
He was standing in front of Barts again, on his mobile. Sherlock was perched on the edge of the roof, telling him to stay where he was.
Sherlock slurped at the curry. He smacked his lips, wrinkled his nose. “Needs salt,” he said. “And you’re wrong. The odds are the same, whichever door you pick. It doesn’t matter if you switch or not.”
“Shit,” John muttered, heaving himself out of his chair and taking off after him. “Sherlock. That’s not what I meant by it.”
He stepped forward, heaving one leg over Sherlock’s waist and climbing onto the sofa until he was straddling Sherlock’s thighs. His fingers drifted across Sherlock’s shoulders, down the sides of his arms. Sherlock might even have felt it, if he still had nerve endings. If any of the aforementioned body parts still existed.
Before Sherlock fell, John was only bothered by the dreams in a vague sort of way. It wasn’t so much the content of the dreams—John had erotic dreams since he was a teenager, after all—it was that it was
The sky was still a twilight blue, and John could see the sun start to turn the corner at the horizon, preparing to rise again after never fully setting. The clouds were closer—there was rain in the distance, but John had a sense that he would miss it. Still, the wind ripped down the beach, tearing at John’s hair and digging into his skin. It was the kind of wind that stole into your lungs and knocked the breath out of you. John zipped his jacket up to his chin and shoved his hands into his pockets. He would be glad when he got out of the elements, away from the cold and the wind, far from murderous shooters and sudden explosives. He started down the road back towards the pier. It was a few kilometers away, but it wouldn’t take very long if he walked quickly.
“Yeah,” John said. He patted his pockets for the piece of paper before remembering he threw it in a bin before finding a cab. “Kind of brightly-colored flyers. Talking about family-style dining. Authentic Italian cuisine. That sort of thing.”
The little ewe was still outside the café when they exited, peacefully munching on grass. She glanced up at them as they passed, but appeared unbothered by their presence. Conor seemed to have abandoned the group in favor of chasing rabbits with Fitz. John couldn’t blame him; the island was a perfect spot for both boys and dogs. John remembered Mycroft’s admission that Sherlock once wanted to be a pirate and could almost picture a frizzy-haired young Sherlock darting about the cliffs with a fake sword in hand, preparing to seize control of the island.
He heard a soft noise—a light puff of breath—and something shifted against his chest. His blinking eyes searched for the disturbance. A sleeping John, face half-buried in his pillow, was tucked close to Sherlock, an arm flung across Sherlock’s chest—heavy, possessive. The blankets had slipped low on his body, stopping just before the swell of his arse, revealing the muscled lines of his bare back. Sherlock smiled, and his brain decided it was worth coming back online for this.
John felt as if his throat were closing up. Speaking, he knew, would be the sort of thing that fixed marriages, but at the moment he found that eye contact was tricky enough. He stood in front of her, staring at the bit of wall just to the right of her ear and breathing carefully through his nose.
“So long as you are aware,” Sherlock said, “that our family is now two-thirds in agreement that the goat is a more valuable prize than the car.”
“You’ll let me know if anyone gives you any trouble?” Sherlock asked, his expression serious for just a moment before poking his chin in the direction of the ladies sipping their tea by the window. “Especially that lot. They’ve got trouble written all over them.” He winked, and the ladies giggled. Back to the act, it would seem.
“Every time this man opened his mouth,” John said, “the most brilliant, incredible, extraordinary things came out. Not necessarily nice things, but extraordinary. He prattled on like some genius arsehole and all I could think was that he was the most remarkable man I’d ever met.” John smiled at Sherlock, squeezing at his hand. “And that’s all it took. He had me.”
“Gate is closed,” John said, and hoped that Mary hadn’t heard the disappointment that crept into his voice.
“Yes they have,” John said. “Look.” He moved three gnocchi to the mostly-empty middle of his plate. “At your first guess, there is a one-third chance that the car could be behind any of the doors. You’ve got nothing to go on for that first guess, so you choose at random.” John pointed at the leftmost gnocchi. “And there is a two-thirds chance that your guess is incorrect and that the car is behind one of the remaining doors.” John pointed at the other two gnocchi. “The host—who knows what is behind each door—purposefully shows you a door with a goat behind it.” John pointed to the gnocchi in the middle. “Because it is more likely that the car is behind one of the doors you didn’t choose on the first go,
“You know there’s a bloody sheep murderer on the island,” John said. “You know, the person we’ve been trying to find? You can’t just disappear like that, Sherlock. I thought...” John’s mouth popped closed. Best not to share all the ludicrous scenarios his brain had developed as he made his way across the island. Not with the man he was hoping to kiss again, anyway.
He finishes typing and sets the mobile on his stomach. He taps his fingers against himself, eyes on the ceiling. You can practically hear him thinking, seven moves ahead of everyone else on the planet, likely.
The wooden floors creaked beneath their feet as Hugh walked them into the sitting room. A grand picture window lay on the far wall, but otherwise the room was lived-in and cozy, with a motley assortment of overstuffed sofas centered around a grand stone fireplace. Sherlock wrapped an arm around John’s back, pulling him in.
Not like this—he wouldn’t have John like this, Sherlock on his back and John above him. Sherlock rolled himself onto his stomach. This was how he wanted John, writhing underneath him, his arse pressed against Sherlock’s groin as Sherlock fucked him into the mattress.
He nodded at John once he was standing, indicating that he was okay and could take it from here, but John’s firm grip remained wrapped around his fingers. He pressed a palm against Sherlock’s shoulder as the two walked slowly out of the room.
“We’d best head back to the cottage,” Sherlock said quickly, seemingly unwilling to hear what John had to say next. “We’ve likely given our murderer plenty of time to dismantle all the locks.”
The two donkeys had migrated to the space between the cottage and the café, munching at some grass just by a cheerful sign that read,
Sherlock’s fingers were long, unbelievably long, and John felt a mess by the time he had just the one fully inside him, Sherlock’s palm resting against his arse. Sherlock pulsed his finger and crooked forward and stroked and John felt the whole of his body light up, sparks spraying inside him. A wrecked sound tore from his battered throat and he started moving, thrusting himself back against Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s eyes were still on him, that little smile on his face as if he found the whole of this fascinating, miraculous. John kissed at the smile, barely breathing once again.
Sherlock tipped his glass towards John in a silent cheers before taking a sip. The fire popped beside them. The room filled with a flickering orange glow that made the shadows dance and loom long across the floor and walls. John sipped at his wine and did his absolute best not to marvel at how the light played against Sherlock’s face, turning his skin bronze and carving shadows into his already-sharp features. John was afraid he might not survive this night, full stop—regardless of the presence of a serial killer.
Sherlock whimpered. He didn’t slow his pace on John’s fingers. He seemed incapable of stopping. “Then
Sherlock was still looking at his feet, which was well and good with John because his eyes were properly overflowing now. The face of the old anger had fallen off, and it might have been a mask the whole time, hiding away an emotion that defied categorization because it was somehow comprised of seven emotions at once and was turning John’s body into a trembling, soggy mess. It felt like needles. It made his nightmares seem like a walk in the park.
Sherlock fell into step beside John, walking silently by his side. Against all his better judgment, John stole a glance at Sherlock. He still had his shamming-face on, appearing to all the world that he was in a pleasant mood, happy to be out with his boyfriend. However, John could see that Sherlock was unsettled, the facade crumbling along the edges. John heaved a sigh.
“What about this one?” John asked. “Woman saying someone broke into her flat and only nicked her salad forks and several pairs of shoes.”
enough. He worked another finger into himself, his mouth dropping open at the added stretch. It was closer, this, but still not enough. He slid his fingers in and out of his arse, setting a slow pace, wishing to Christ he could feel the sturdy warmth of Sherlock’s body against him. Groin slapping against John’s arse. Fingers digging into John’s hips. John shifted the angle of his fingers slightly, trying to push deeper. He cursed, whimpered. He needed this so badly right now.
The clinical director at the surgery, she didn’t even see your face before she hired you. Still hasn’t seen you, in fact. Someone sent along your CV and she saw the military training and figured you would do just fine. Half the other doctors at the practice you only see in passing. Walking down the halls. Everyone leaves as soon as their patients clear for the day. Nobody stays longer than needed. Everyone heads home to their families.
Sherlock asked him the other day. Perhaps Sherlock found this all to be some new sort of communication strategy—some novel way for him to express himself when feeling too much for words. Whether any of those feelings were directed towards John could be anybody’s guess. Still, John’s lips tingled and he found he was a bit too flustered to care at the moment.
Sherlock found the little bottle and clamped it between his teeth, grinning at John triumphantly. He shifted John’s weight against the wall once again, scrambling at John’s flies with his free hand. He tugged John’s trousers as far down his arse as he could with John’s legs still wrapped around him. He couldn’t get them down particularly far, but it would be far enough.
The barking—loud and shrill—was coming from down in the ruins somewhere. The dilapidated stone buildings were black, shrouded in darkness along the paths. John hadn’t stopped to grab a head-lamp, but the night was clear and the moon cast just enough light for John to see the way in front of him. Sherlock looked like some sort of ghost in the distance—slender and pale and waving light around in all directions. John tried to call out to Sherlock again. He urged his legs to go faster, but his feet were already slipping across the ground and his pants were doing little in the way of support. He had no idea how Sherlock was managing to move so quickly.
You think to be offended, but he’s right. You, in fact, do not have fifty quid. Another reason why you probably shouldn’t have called in sick today.
His mobile buzzed in his pocket. He lifted it out, read the message on the screen. His contact, finally getting back to him. About time, really.
“A dare, most likely,” comes a voice at your side, and you nearly start swinging. You turn. You remind yourself that you’re in London and can’t just go about breaking bones whenever someone sneaks up on you.
“Get the forceps,” John nodded at the silver instrument in the suture kit. “Hold the edge of the wound still. Needle goes in a bit back from the cut.” He leaned back, his fingers gripping at the edge of the toilet seat seemingly hard enough to leave a dent. “Just go slow.”
John did his best to keep up, but staying awake for days on end was no longer something his body was capable of. For most of the evening prior, Sherlock fluctuated between sinking into the dark corners of the internet and his Mind Palace, popping back into reality with little snippets of information that made next to no sense to John, although he tried to respond anyway. John stayed up with Sherlock as late as he could, but sleep started tugging at his eyes and dropping his chin around half-one. He had an early shift at the surgery the next day and had already called in sick a few too many times as it was. So he set Sherlock up with one of Rosie’s stuffed animals as a substitute, gave him a kiss on the top of his head that he likely did not notice, and went to bed.
Rosie, of course, brought a new dynamic to the flat, but John was accurate about her ability to be endearing in all her demands. She adapted to her new environment quickly and took to Sherlock with a speed that seemed to astonish John. Sherlock found that he had a knack for calming Rosie when she was otherwise inconsolable, which earned him new responsibilities with her fairly quickly. He didn’t mind. He was teaching her how to walk.
Sherlock’s hand slipped underneath John’s vest. His fingertips trailed over the skin of his stomach, tracing the line of hair that ran from his navel to the waistband of his trousers. “Are you saying that you don’t want my hands on you, John?” Sherlock asked. His voice dipped so low that the vibrations alone were making John shiver. “You don’t want my hands on your cock, my fingers inside you? Are you saying that you don’t want me to fuck you, to turn you over on this mattress and bury myself inside you until you’re screaming from it?”
Sherlock nodded against him, his nose brushing the hair at the back of John’s neck. “Found an individual who strongly suggested they had access to a set of lungs for purchase. Profile seemed to match one of our surgeons. Traced the IP address. Texted Lestrade. Just heard back. One surgeon down, one to go.” He yawned. “Tedious.”
“Uh,” John said. “Yeah. I suppose. As much fun as any person can have while hiding in a bog, that is.” He gestured down at his ruined clothes, at the mud he’d tracked through their flat.
Mrs. Hudson’s attack had given Gilly a concussion and a fractured jaw, but otherwise she was in good health and passionately professing her innocence. Her trial was set for the following month, and the lot of them were likely to be witnesses. John hoped he wouldn’t have to once again bail Sherlock out of jail after being a smartarse got him held in contempt of court, but he wouldn’t exactly hold his breath on that matter. Hearing all the colorful things Mrs. Hudson had to say about Gilly these past few days had him wondering if he might have to bail the
Sherlock’s face was still, but John could detect traces of worry around the corners of his eyes. “You’ve got the gun on you?” he asked. “Declan’s?”
“It’ll ruin me,” Sherlock said, his voice loud over the assault of the rain outside. “It’ll ruin everything I’ve worked for. Everything I stand for. The life of logic and reason that permits me to excel in this world, to craft work that stimulates my brain like nothing else, to survive long after others have fallen prey to their own weaknesses.” Another bolt of lightning lit the greenhouse. John seemed unperturbed by the whole of it. “So you see, Watson,” Sherlock said. “I cannot
“We could check the sheep for signs of illness,” Sherlock said. “Limited grass intake, emaciation, that sort of thing. But that is assuming the flash drive has caused it any sort of internal difficulties, which it likely hasn’t. The digestive tract of a sheep is remarkably hardy.”
“Right,” Sherlock said. He still seemed perplexed. “Friends. You were friends with some of the men you saw die in Afghanistan too, I wager.”
. He would have noticed the pang in his chest over that thought were he not so acutely focused on not slipping and falling down the jagged rocks.
“Shit,” John muttered, his voice rough. “I think it’s a bit worse than I thought.” He stared down at the makeshift bandage he had wrapped around his leg—his own shirt, ripped up and bound tightly over the knife-wound he sustained just at the top of his thigh—and Sherlock couldn’t miss the slight tremor to his hands.
“Everything is fine,” John said quickly, in an attempt to circumvent an unsuspecting yet slightly loud couple from being rudely escorted from the restaurant. It had happened before and, despite Sherlock’s self-satisfied grin, it always made John feel like an arse.
Sherlock nodded. He stared at John’s ankle for a moment longer, struck with an unusual impulse to lay a gentle hand on him, to feel for the lack of broken bones himself, to rub at his angry skin with soft fingers. Instead, he stood, snatching several pillows from the other side of the bed. He tucked a hand under John’s heel and lifted him lightly, sliding the pillows underneath. John sucked in air but seemed to settle once his foot sank into the soft down.
“No problem,” Will said, striding through the ruins as if he knew exactly where he was going. “This morning you found it?”
“If you go home right now,” Sherlock had said, “you’ll find your daughter on your doorstep, ready to make amends.” He didn’t have a particular person in mind for the deduction. However, given the history of decision-making of the occupants in this room, estranged children seemed a high-probability occurrence. Indeed, one of the shouting junkies left. The room lapsed back into a relative silence, leaving Sherlock alone with the sounds in his own mind, which—as it turned out—was a bit of a lateral move.
“You’re upset with him because you care,” Mary said, closing her book once more. “If this was anybody else—if Mike Stamford managed to explode a pig’s stomach all over the lab at Barts—would you have the same reaction? Would you want to throttle him? Would you come home yelling about it? Would you even think about it for longer than a second?”
John twiddled with a pen behind the till. “Any news on Lucy?” he asked. “How is she faring after the surgery?”
Sherlock took another step forward. John’s hand remained wrapped around his finger, pressing it to his chest. He could feel the drum of John’s heartbeat beneath it. His other hand still grasped John’s down at their sides. Sherlock’s ears felt fuzzy and he was vaguely aware that his brain was set to a buzzing autopilot, taking action without checking with Sherlock first. “And just what would you have done with those photographs, John?” Sherlock asked. His voice barely seemed his own. It seemed to belong to someone crooning, seductive.
On the telly, one of the football teams almost scores. The goalie makes a save at the last minute. The man hoots again, but he’s hooting for the opposite team now, not the team he cheered on just a moment ago.
Right then. He rinsed and dried off his hands and nodded to himself in the mirror for moral support. Off to go sleep with Sherlock Holmes. Christ. Mrs. Hudson would be beside herself with joy.
and he’s saying your name like he can’t help it, like you’re pulling it from him. His whole body has gone pink and shimmering and his mouth is gaping as he bows back and you decide that your favorite sound in the entirety of the world is the sound of your name on his lips when you’re fucking him into the mattress.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” he said. He ran his hands along Sherlock’s arms, down his chest. His fingers brushed over the little circular scar just underneath Sherlock’s heart, but he didn’t linger, allowing his touch to drift onwards. He moved his hands along Sherlock’s sides, eyes still roaming over the whole of Sherlock’s body. His hands drifted down to Sherlock’s hips, his thumbs tracing the crease between his hips and his thighs. John’s eyes were fixed on Sherlock’s cock, standing red and swollen, a drop of precome glistening at the tip. John’s gaze darted up to Sherlock’s, asking permission.
John craned his neck to look at the sixteen steps that separated them from his bedroom. “Son of a bitch,” he said again. He shook his head, coming to a decision. “Sofa. Take me to the bloody sofa.”
“And the not-talking bit?” John continued, doing his best to ignore the violin and what it happened to be doing to his insides at the moment. “For days on end? Not once. You talked constantly, Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded. He glanced back at Gilly’s body, still limp on the bed. “Are you ready to talk to Scotland Yard about your serial killer girlfriend?”
Sherlock didn’t know how John would touch him, but seeing as John was never going to actually touch him Sherlock felt it acceptable to take some liberties in his imagination. He thought of how John touched himself that night, wailing and shaking as Sherlock fucked him, his hand urgent and violent. No, John wouldn’t start off touching him like that, Sherlock figured. He would start slow, deliberate, which was how Sherlock touched himself now—long strokes from the base of his cock to the tip, firm yet teasing. His feet skittered against the mattress. His hips twitched, moving upwards into his hand—John’s hand.
John looked like hell. His eyes were wild and his hair was everywhere and his hands were fists at his sides. The explosion that Sherlock knew would come if John found out had finally detonated, and John looked like debris. John stared at Sherlock, clearly waiting for a response. Sherlock, for one of the few times in his life, had none.
John chuckled. He flipped through a few pages of the journal, absentmindedly. “Why are we even investigating the caretaker’s death, anyway?” he asked. “I thought you said this was dull.”
John heard a rustling downstairs, quiet puffs of air as candles were extinguished. The faint smell of sulfur drifted up to him. He heard a shifting of feet on wood, then the creak of the stairs—slowly, one at a time. There was a pause in the noise, a moment of hesitation just outside of the bedroom door. A faint rattle of a doorknob, as if a hand was placed upon the knob without turning, just resting, deciding. Unmoving.
John felt a grin spread across his face that threatened to split him in half. He laughed again, a sound filled with joy and relief. He grabbed at Sherlock, pressing their foreheads together. “God,” he said, “that sounds beautiful.”
“Christmas morning is always awkward,” Sherlock said. “At least this year it’ll be awkward for good reason.”
John stuffed an oatmeal-colored jumper into the box. “I suppose,” he said. “Hard to tell with Sherlock.”
“Molly is looking after Rosie,” John said, choosing to only answer the second part of Mary’s question. “Mrs. Hudson is helping as well. We owe them favors.” He scratched at his head. “A lot of favors.”
Sherlock opened his eyes. Front-facing eyes, useful for depth perception. He tilted his head to the side, his eyes seeing, sending visual data through his optic nerve and into his occipital lobe where it could be processed, catalogued. He saw John’s face, so close it was nearly touching his. John’s graying hair was in a spiked disarray, his parted lips red and slightly swollen, his cheeks tinged pink and lifted in a smile, his breath still coming in a bit heavy through flared nostrils. It was a lovely sight. John’s eyes, the color of clear skies, looked back into Sherlock’s with recognition.
The two of you are in a cab in less than five minutes, and this is—unquestionably—the happiest you’ve been in the whole of your life.
Right. Of course Sherlock’s eyes didn’t need to be on John to know what he was feeling. “I suppose,” John said.
Sherlock’s hand was on John’s face, his thumb tracing along John’s jaw. “I’ve already told you how I feel, John,” he said.
“Are you following someone again?” you ask. “Gathering information, like you were doing the other day? Solving puzzles?”
“With my arse in the air,” Sherlock said. He nudged John’s head to the side, ran his tongue along John’s earlobe. John made a little gasping noise. “You said you should’ve taken pictures of me.”
meant. He placed Rosie back in her cot and her eyes blinked shut nearly immediately, her little fist coming to rest just at her mouth. Her legs gave another kick, but her effort was low.
“Looks like a bite-mark,” she says. Her eyebrows are raised. She looks concerned. “Are you all right?”
You shove him, but not particularly hard and he doesn’t go anywhere. “Wanker,” you say, but you're laughing.
John sighed. He was in danger of saying too much, of overstepping. He ran the risk of giving Sherlock the willies just by leering at his arse incessantly, and he certainly didn’t need to send Sherlock swimming back to the mainland by telling him that watching Sherlock eat was proof of life, an indication that he was alive and well and reasonably-functioning and his body was not scheduled to quit in the immediate future.
Rosie stood again. She pressed her arms behind her back and started pacing around the body. She seemed to be dictating something, talking out loud to herself.
The police arrived in the morning, bringing along the whole of their homicide division. The café was soon filled with officers snapping photographs and dusting for prints and conducting blood splatter analysis, all of which Sherlock declared pointless loudly and repeatedly until he was asked to kindly leave the area. John personally didn’t mind stepping out. Will’s body had not grown any nicer-looking overnight, his skin now a mixture of ghost-white and bruised-black as the blood that remained in him pooled at the floor. The whole of the storage closet was a mess, bits of what used to be Will’s brain sprayed everywhere and rivers of dried blood gone dark overnight. The message the Taibhses left for Sherlock was still visible on the floor—angry and threatening and scrawled in Will’s blood. John could barely make out what it said—something about
“So they’re fine with all of this?” you ask. “You…” you wave a hand, “following this bloke? Learning his behaviors? Hiding out in the air ducts of a bank, waiting for him to rob it?”
“Are you trying to ensure that every individual person in the city knows that you and I are in a relationship?” John asked.
“I wasn’t panicking,” John said, rolling onto his back. He ran a hand over his face. At least his erection was gone now.
“Oh,” John said. “Probably not. Whoever is looking for her probably knows her real name too.” John did his best not to consider that this person who wanted Mary dead knew more about John’s wife than he did. “So she…”
“Indeed,” Sherlock said, turning another page. “If Declan was in trouble with the Taibhse Brothers, I’d say he made some regrettable decisions indeed.”
The hard sole of his boot came down on John’s throat, slow but forceful, crushing. John felt his throat collapse, his airway restricted. He tried to suck in air. He failed. The man pressed harder.
“The market for convincing false paperwork is surprisingly narrow, John,” Sherlock said. “Very few people can do it well, and even fewer can do it well without being caught.” His phone buzzed. Sherlock studied his screen. His brow furrowed. “That’s a no for Amsterdam. Pity. I have far more contacts there. His phone buzzed again. His eyebrows raised. “My Hamburg person came through. Seems as if his business has expanded.” He grinned. “Frankfurt it is. Doubt we’ll have time to see the Alte Oper, though. Some other time.”
“Um,” John said, stepping back to avoid Sherlock’s path of destruction. “I doubt the O’Sullivans would be pleased with you tearing up the floorboards in one of their bedrooms.”
Sherlock had reached over to him, taking over the responsibility of removing the grass from John’s hair.
“No,” Sherlock repeated. He waited, waited for John to stop moving and even a few moments after that, before he started moving again.
“Is to cut them open,” John said. He could feel the blood draining from his face, lines in his head connecting. “One by one.”
John shook his head. Mrs. Hudson made it seem as if Sherlock was crushed by John’s engagement. She made him seem like some sort of jilted lover. Yet, that wasn’t the case, right? Stoic, mechanical, borderline sociopathic Sherlock couldn’t possibly
Sherlock was shaking, tight, his hips grinding against John. John’s fingers dug into Sherlock’s arse, guiding him along, pulling him closer, faster, harder. Sherlock’s thrusts were growing disorganized, stuttering, mad. He panted against John’s neck and it sounded like waves crashing against rocks, fuming and violent.
“It has to be this way, John,” Sherlock’s voice crackled through the mobile. He was crying. John could hear the tears in his voice through the speaker.
John nodded. Saying any of the things he wished to say, it would seem, was pointless. He stared down at the bottle of wine. He could see an imprint from his clammy hand on the glass. “Can I help?” His voice sounded small.
You laugh. “We’ve only just met,” you say. It seems like the kind of thing a person should say in this sort of situation, not that you’ve ever been in anything close to this sort of situation before.
Sherlock slapped his hands away. “Spare me,” he said, his face a disgusted scowl. With that, he turned on his heel and set off down the path, back towards the east end of the island. Away from the wind. Away from John.
John watched him work, watched the narrow muscles in his back move beneath his shirt, tense and trembling. He thought about how Claire said there was a death on the island all those years ago, a young lad who died from a perfectly treatable illness. After that, she said, the islanders were unceremoniously evicted. For their own good, the mainland thought.
Sherlock placed his hand on John’s wrist, stilling him. John slipped his fingers from Sherlock, and Sherlock didn’t understand how he could miss the touch so palpably, despite knowing what was to come. John slicked his cock with fumbling hands and Sherlock pulled at him, positioning himself over John, needing him immediately. He hovered just over John’s cock, guiding the tip against his hole.
"I want to name the baby,” John repeated. There was more he could say here, things about how she had lied to him from the start and shot his best friend and taken the aforementioned best friend from his life after he just got him back and he was going to try to give it a go with her, try with all his might, but she was still,
“You didn’t think I’d mourn you, Sherlock?” John asked. “You didn’t think I’d grieve? You didn’t think I’d have bloody nightmares about you? About you falling, hitting the pavement, lying there pale and dead? You didn’t think any of that was going to
The final member of the black market surgery gang managed to elude police capture quite successfully. Sherlock, as always, was a bit more adept at locating the criminal and took it upon himself to apprehend the fellow, seeing—as Sherlock put it—that Scotland Yard didn’t seem up to the task themselves. Sherlock tracked down the surgeon’s hideout and he and John paid the man a visit earlier today.
“No one gets close,” he says, a smug little smile flickering over his face. He nuzzles at your nose. “I bet you could get closer. If you tried.”
John squirmed underneath Sherlock, his wrists wriggling against Sherlock’s grip, needing touch more than he had ever needed anything. Sherlock remained planted firm above him, looking down without touching, burning him alive with his stare.
The whole of the mountain shook. The rocks fell apart in chunks, tearing the land apart in eager strokes. The spray from the falls bore down upon the two men. Water streamed down Sherlock’s face. His eyes burned. He could barely see John in front of him, doing his best not to look sad. They had seconds, at most, before the world fell down around them.
Sherlock tried moving again. His limbs weren’t particularly cooperative, but he at least had a sense of where they all were now. One arm—the one with the different temperature at the fingers—was dangling off the side of the mattress. The other appeared to be wedged beneath his body. One leg was kicked to the side, bent up at a right angle near him. Despite the overall discombobulation of his limbs, the warm, non-oppressive thing over him (a blanket, likely a blanket) seemed tidy. John must have put it over him, then. Sherlock flew into bed and John tucked him in. That was new. That didn’t usually happen.
Sherlock nodded. He didn’t point out that John and Mary’s relationship hadn’t been the same since John found out about her past. He didn’t point out that John was uncertain about going back to her for months after Sherlock was shot, only returning out of a vague sense of obligation towards Rosie and this abstract concept of
John looked around the cliffs that surrounded the moon-shaped sliver of beach. How the hell had Sherlock even gotten down there? John spied a rivulet cut into the grass—either dug by the islanders decades ago or carved out by centuries of rain and runoff, John couldn’t be sure—that dipped between the cliffs and led to the beach. John climbed his way down the little path, stepping carefully over rocks and tall patches of grass.
“I see that,” Mrs. Hudson said, her eyes flitting ever so quickly in their direction. “But the reporters want to talk to you all the same.” She waved her hands in their direction.
The car ride into town made it clear that Sherlock was not yet out of his strop, effectively dashing whatever hopes John might have had that the events of the morning were anything but fake. With no cameras in the car to capture a lapse in loving-couple behaviors, Sherlock fell silent and sullen, responding to anything John said with no more than one or two biting words.
Sherlock’s coughs are becoming less violent as he sucks air into his lungs. He rolls forward and pushes himself into kneeling, hands pressed to the floor. His breaths are still ragged and unsteady, but the blood is starting to leave his face. You rub at his back.
You lift yourself onto an elbow, the farthest apart from him you can muster, and look down into his eyes. If he looked like a sleepy tiger the other night, now he looks like he’s been tranquilized, eyes barely open, lips lazily parted. His curls are plastered to his head and you push them back. His sweat is slick against your fingers. You’ve got his come smeared between the two of you and he’s got your come leaking out of him and it feels like an equal exchange, bits of each other covering the both of you. He blinks at you and smiles.
John’s mobile buzzed and he covered his head with a pillow. Gilly again. She had spent much of the day before texting him various details about their less-than-twenty-four-hours-old engagement. It nearly sounded as if she had half the wedding planned already. John’s tumultuous brain could barely make heads or tails of most of it, and he finally silenced her for the night by making up a story about doing some covert case-related task with Sherlock. It was likely ill-advised to begin an engagement with a lie, but the silent mobile was such a blessing that John didn’t much care.
me was a helpful way to keep me asleep?” Sherlock snapped. “Well done.” The room was properly dark now, but Sherlock pressed a hand over his eyes all the same. Better safe than sorry.
“Mary,” John said, shifting slightly on his knee, “I shouldn’t have to explain this to you, but you know that there is not and never was anything going on between myself and—”
.” He darted out of the open half of the house, down towards the hill that led to the shore. There was a trail of blood—the shooter’s blood—that dotted down the sloping side of the hill. He faintly heard Mary calling after him.
“And you remember what I always used to say about coincidences, don’t you John?” A little grin gleamed across Sherlock’s face.
“Whatever you’re about to say,” Sherlock said before John had even formed a syllable, “I can assure you that it is wholly unnecessary.”
Sherlock murmured something and tucked his nose back into John’s neck. He tightened his arms around John’s chest, sliding a palm underneath John’s back and pulling him closer, as if that were possible. John pressed a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head. He rested his cheek against the crown of Sherlock’s head, feeling his curls tickle at his nose as he inhaled and breathing in the scent of Sherlock’s shampoo that managed to linger after what was certainly two days without a shower.
“Just as long as Sherlock knows he can’t keep you,” Gilly said, winking. She returned to her coffee, long since neglected after her momentary lapse into panic. “You’re mine. And I don’t like to share.”
“That he is,” Brennan said. “Lots of fishermen out here have stories about him. He swims alongside boats, does little flips when he feels like it. But it’s always seemed like he’s preferred me best. Comes over to my boat as soon as he sees it. Does little flips for me. Stays by my side as long as I’m out there.” The man smiled, seemingly despite himself. “We have a little game we play. I stick my oar out over the water and he comes up and bumps it with his nose.”
Sherlock’s lips twitched into a little smile. His knuckles grazed against John’s—an invitation—and John took his hand, squeezing him tight.
John found himself stuck on the title of his next blog post. He had written nearly all of it, just needed to ask Sherlock about some minor details about the case in question that he had forgotten, but had no idea what to title the thing. The titles were important, John knew. Catchy titles brought in more readers, which brought in more clients. Not that they were hurting for clients these days, but it was always good to keep a steady flow of work pointed in their direction, both for their financial well-being and Sherlock’s mental stability.
“Right,” you say. “No choice. So if the police found out that you’d been effectively stalking this man…”
Lestrade was fiddling with something, pulling his mobile out of his pocket. “I maybe should have just let you go on not knowing,” he said. “I maybe shouldn’t keep on about it. But...if it were me, I guess I would want to know.” He held his mobile out between the two of them. He had a voicemail pulled up. He hit
Darren arrived at the island early in the morning, hoisting Lucy into his arms and carrying her down to the harbor. Lucy was a bit loud and cranky—bleating irritably the whole way, likely because she had been cooped up inside the cottage and prevented from eating since the day before. Preparation for the surgery, John knew, but it still tore at something in his chest.
“Of course,” Sherlock said as he lowered John’s hand back to his hip, “one can always take advantage of one’s hands. A properly-placed hand on the cheek,” Sherlock demonstrated, placing his hand on John’s face, “can mask the mouth quite efficiently.”
John paced a bit, moving about near the doorway yet still being sure to keep a respectable distance from Sherlock. “I mean, it’s…” he gestured between the two of them. “I haven’t...not in a while, anyway… And you don’t… I mean, I thought you didn’t…”
Something in John’s brain registered Sherlock calling out his name. He gripped at the man, holding him tight, pinning his arms to his side as the man tried to flail and grab his gun. The man cursed and howled, sending his head crashing back against John’s. He caught him just in the side of the forehead but John held tight. He was not letting go. The man hurled his body backwards again, shoving the two of them back. The man tripped. John’s knees collided with the side of the boat.
Still, one glance at the blinking light of the tiny camera hidden away in the corner of the loo killed any desire John might have had to have a wank while cleaning up. Instead, he took a very, very, very cold shower. It was only somewhat effective.
it, hadn’t fully faced the reality of losing John in his mind until this moment. It felt like emptiness, the thought of being without John. It felt like stepping away from reality into a pit of nothingness, black and soundless and meaningless for all eternity. It seemed like the keenest sort of torture, and Sherlock was properly convinced that he would never be able to withstand it. Sherlock stared down at John’s leg—half-stitched and still a bit bloodied—and felt the swirl of panic start to suck the air from his lungs.
You pull his mouth back down onto yours and you have a distinct feeling that you will never get close enough to this man, no matter how you try. “Does anyone know
“And what’ll you do?” John whispered. He wasn’t particularly sure why reuniting with Mary required so much sneaking around.
Sherlock glanced around the room, his hands in his pockets. “It was a good case,” he said. “One of the better ones, I’d say.”
Sherlock ran his thumb across his mobile. Based on the speed of his responses, John had put Rosie back to bed—he typed faster with both hands and made fewer mistakes. Sherlock reasoned that John put Rosie back down several minutes ago but had not yet returned to bed with Mary; if he had, John would have said goodnight. Mary complained about the light from the mobile, so John rarely texted in bed. No, this meant that John chose not to go back to bed and didn’t seem like he would anytime soon. He had settled elsewhere in the flat—likely on the sofa, as it was the most comfortable.
“Good,” John said. His voice was hoarse, rough. “Good.” He slammed his fingers in up to the knuckles.
“The bat didn’t break the skin,” John said, “but you’re developing one hell of a lump. Should be a bit angry for a few days, then go away.” He shifted the bag of peas on Sherlock’s head. “Provided you don’t do anything stupid in the meantime. Which, given you, is about a fifty-fifty.”
“Even wearing that horrible Christmas jumper,” Sherlock said. “All I wanted to do was rip it off you. I could have folded you in half and fucked you right under that god-forsaken tree in the sitting room.” He bit at John’s ear. “I still might.”
It was slow at first—cautious, experimental—but the whole of it sped up quickly. Sherlock’s hand pumped faster, squeezing and twisting, pushing panted breaths from John with each movement. His hips ground into John in tight, shaking strokes, and John found himself torn between the two movements, thrusting his cock into Sherlock’s hand and his arse back against Sherlock’s pelvis. It was rough and uncoordinated and good, so good, and John knew he wasn’t going to last, even with the burn of friction from Sherlock’s hand. Things were growing warm, the sheets above them heavier than ever. Sherlock was moving against John with urgency and there was entirely too much fabric between them. John tugged at Sherlock’s pants, trying to push them down his hips without disturbing the rhythm of his thrusts.
He studies you. Whether he somehow managed to hear all the things you didn’t say is anybody’s guess. “You don’t often have good sex?” he asks.
“Oh,” John said again, getting the sense that this all meant something much greater that he was not quite understanding. “Yeah. Huh. That’s…”
“Well.” Your eyes are glued to the drone. “I have my moments.” You’ve got your hand on your gun, but you aren’t really sure what for.
“Yeah,” John said. “Part of the good bit of dating you would be dating…” he gestured, waving a hand at Sherlock, “
“...work,” John said, remembering the ending to a sentence that was no longer relevant. He wrenched his gaze away from Sherlock’s groin (
You certainly can’t afford it. If you had any sort of brain in your head, you wouldn’t go at all. You would put all your extra money towards a halfway decent flat. Palatable food. More than six bullets for your gun. But instead you go to the pub every couple days or so.
John asked him one afternoon, sitting across from him while Sherlock curled himself into a ball in his chair and willed unconsciousness to descend upon him.
Sherlock remembered) was John hovering over him, patting at his face. Sherlock’s vision was blurry and his brain felt cracked in two. John was making some noises that didn’t seem to make a lot of sense, although in the end turned out just to have been Sherlock’s name. John shined a bloody light in his eye and Sherlock tried to punch him but had temporarily misplaced his coordination, so he wasn’t particularly effective at it. John then made some more noises that also turned out to have been Sherlock’s name, with the addition of a few curses. The remainder of the evening came and went from Sherlock’s memory in hazy stops and starts. An argument about hospital. Lestrade yelling at John about...something. A cab ride that seemed to wind about in circles and even go upside down at one point. Stairs. John wresting Sherlock’s mobile from him for some wholly unfair reason. Paracetamol that Sherlock was convinced was simply sugar pills. Blissful, blissful dark.
Sherlock could have predicted John’s response practically down to the syllable. For an actual doctor, John was remarkably resistant to stepping foot inside a hospital himself, insisting upon treating whatever injury or malady with which he was stricken by himself. Sherlock couldn’t quite work out if it was the arrogance of feeling like John could treat himself more efficiently than any other doctor he might encounter, some machismo reluctance to admit that he might actually be injured in a manner that required outside assistance, a disinclination to enter a building in which he had already spent so much of his daily life, or some combination of all three. Whatever the reason, it was a bit infuriating in times like these.
“Thank you, by the way,” John said. His shoulder jerked slightly, a vague gesture towards the loo. “For that. Not sure I could have done it myself.”
“And if not then,” John said, “we walked them a million times after. At all hours of the day or night. Off on some case or another.”
John took the revolver. “Lucky us.” Despite Sherlock’s insistence that John bring his gun with them, John was rather less keen on attempting to smuggle an illegal firearm onto their flight into the country. He had hoped that their stay on an island inhabited nearly entirely by sheep would prove not to necessitate a firearm; however, it was likely he was dead wrong about that, knowing Sherlock. John tucked the revolver into his trousers.
They sat like that for a while, pressed ever so slightly together, the wind tossing their hair as the clouds rolled in. The sky shifted to a darker grey, the temperature halting and dropping. The seals edged closer, moving away from the choppy waves, grunting and barking. All, of course, was forgiven.
The man sighs. His eyes leave you and you find yourself missing them, of all the ridiculous things. “I can give you your seven pounds back,” he says, “if that will make it all
It was clumsy and a bit sloppy but John couldn’t care because he had Sherlock’s lips pressed against his. Sherlock stepped into him and took his face in his hands and moved his mouth against John’s and it was sweet and urgent and perfect—
Sherlock had a fairly sizable request and a very small window of time for Wiggins to get everything together. Sherlock was prepared for a certain level of disappointment. Indeed, he wasn’t so much interested in the quality of Wiggins’ concoctions; he merely wanted oblivion. In his experience, Wiggins could deliver on oblivion. However, as the substance started setting in mere seconds after the plane lifted off the desolate tarmac, Sherlock felt the effects begin to seep into his body and realized that Wiggins delivered on quality as well. To Sherlock, it seemed an excellent way to begin his exile. If he had any say in the matter, it would be
It was all a bit involuntary after that. Sherlock shifted himself up on his knees, nearly slipping John’s cock out of him, and slid back down. John’s mouth fell open at the movement, fingers digging into the flesh of Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock set a slow rhythm at first, marveling in the feel of John inside him, filling every inch of him bit by bit. He braced himself on John’s chest, his fingers leaving pale imprints on the flushed skin. John’s cock brushed against his prostate with each stroke and Sherlock could feel a heat start to form inside him, the sort of fire that started as a flicker of an ember in the wind and soon grew into a wildfire. John moved his hips, matching Sherlock’s movements with gentle thrusts upwards that drew tiny whimpers from somewhere deep inside of Sherlock. Breaths grew labored. Sweat pooled in the hollows of their bodies. One of them gasped out a barely-coherent sentiment, something about
John spent the morning pretending to pay attention to his chores. He pretended to tidy the kitchen and then pretended he was finished when he hadn’t put away nearly half the things Sherlock had managed to fling everywhere. He pretended to try his hand at doing the wash in the sink and then pretended his clothes were clean when they really weren’t. He pretended he was going to fetch more wood from the fire from the pile behind the café and then pretended he hadn’t stood just outside the cottage for ten minutes, not remembering why he left.
didn’t quite want to leave his lips anymore, and he wasn’t sure what else to call Sherlock’s time away now.
. It was the answer nobody believed. It was also the answer that only John ever delivered, as Sherlock maintained a stony silence on the subject. No wonder nobody believed it, John thought, when only one of them attempted any sort of denial, and that denial was outlined in something that felt oddly like disappointment.
“Lucky you,” Sherlock said. He paused in his task to pull John’s shoes off, taking care with John’s bad foot. John winced all the same, and Sherlock found himself wincing in response, despite the fact that he was not the one who was injured. Odd reaction, that. Once John’s trousers were finally off, John swung himself around, extending his legs on Sherlock’s bed and examining his ankle.
“It doesn’t matter,” Sherlock said. “You leave other details out of that one as well. It’ll just annoy me. Find one where you’re more comprehensive.”
To the camera, it likely looked like a tender moment, one lover apologizing to another with his body, with kind looks and soft touches. It was convincing, what Sherlock was doing. If any of this were real, John would have forgiven Sherlock ages ago. Hell, he would have forgiven Sherlock when Sherlock first wrapped his arms around John’s chest. What was happening now seemed a bit like overkill.
John hadn’t been particularly sure when he first started hitting the surgeon. He slipped back into consciousness to find that he had been hitting the man for what seemed like rather a while, judging by the state of the man’s face. Sherlock was pulling at him, hands on his shoulders, wrapping around his chest, separating him from the man spewing blood beneath him.
John’s eyes were wet. “Of course not,” he said. “Of course not, Sherlock. You’re my best friend. Without you, I can’t…” John made a series of gestures but never quite finished his sentence. Sherlock, however, found the sentence to be finished enough. Without John, Sherlock also simply
Sherlock took the pillow, nestling it under his head. He rolled onto his side, studying John. John was clearly more relaxed now, his respiration rate back to normal and his muscles slack. The paracetamol must have kicked in, reducing his discomfort considerably.
Sherlock’s eyes seemed to twinkle. “Maybe I am,” he said. It was the worst sort of thing to say, and John hated that it came from his own head.
, John,” Sherlock’s fingers moved against John’s face, cold and unsteady, “you mean everything to me.”
Sherlock’s fingers were on John’s neck now. There was a twinge of pain as his fingers grazed skin. John remembered the smaller man’s boot on his neck, grinding and crushing. “Is your breathing obstructed?” Sherlock asked.
the situation was, John didn’t care. He would suffer through all of it, if it meant Sherlock was there. John felt as though he might cry again, and he had no earthly idea why. “Whatever you’re up to, I can help. What do you need?” Sherlock was so close and John could smell him, the smell of his shampoo and aftershave and the wool of his coat and all the smells that caused John to choke on his sadness over the past year.
Another flash of light, another slam of thunder. John flinched, his teacup shaking in his hand. He pressed his eyes closed, forcing himself to breathe.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Please,” he said. “It’s formulaic. Your blog posts practically write themselves.”
He must have nodded off like that, with his knees drawn to his chest and his head tilted back against the side of the mattress. When he woke up, the first hints of sunlight were starting to peek through the window. The sky was a dusky blue and growing lighter.
Sherlock’s mouth moved back towards John’s ear. His hands began drifting across John’s chest. “It was a good shag,” he said.
They had been here a dozen or so times before Sherlock died, enough for John to notice the different artwork on the walls and to recognize that Angelo printed the menu on different paper now. Enough for Angelo to remember the dish John always ordered, apparently. Still, it was that first time that John always remembered, the time they came here to watch for a serial killer, just after John knew that he would follow Sherlock to the ends of the earth and very nearly did.
John lifted himself off the wall and looked around. It was a long shot that he would find Sherlock out here anyway. However, someone
John set his mobile down for a moment and shifted Rosie against him, patting her back to burp her. He hoped that Sherlock didn’t think he was upset with him for his critiques. Sherlock always had plenty of rather direct opinions about John’s blog posts and John had long since grown immune to it. These days, he simply found them amusing.
to still be alive. And then when he wasn’t, when there was no pulse, when there was no life remaining behind those piercing eyes, John had broken, and even after a year he hadn’t quite repaired.
He wrinkles his nose. “Cold,” he says. “And uncomfortable. And an indisputable waste of my time. The bank was never even robbed.”
,” John said, and then he was on his stomach, the press of Sherlock’s body heavy against him for no more than a moment before Sherlock was tugging him up, moving him onto his hands and knees, gripping his hips with iron fingers, and plunging his cock into John with enough force to nearly send him sprawling forward against the mattress.
John pressed his eyes closed. He shut the notebook. The old anger tried to struggle its way up from the ground and failed. “I know,” he said. “I could tell. When I wore it, I could tell you liked it. And once you said to me… I was wearing some other jumper at the time, and you said to me that I ought to wear the striped jumper more often.” John opened his eyes. He cleared his throat. He began flipping through the notebook once more. “Anyway. That’s why I had to get rid of it.”
John had long since decided that he was not to touch himself to thoughts of Sherlock. That way most certainly lay madness and would make for awkward interactions around the flat, especially given Sherlock’s nearly inhuman powers of observation. It was a difficult feat after John first moved in, when Sherlock’s whirlwind nature and inexplicable attractiveness ran through John like a tidal wave on a near constant basis. As time wore on, John found it easier and easier to keep unseemly thoughts from his mind. The last time he’d broken his promise to himself was over a year ago, after Sherlock somehow managed to melt the pipes in the kitchen sink and water gushed all over him and he stripped down to his pants right there in the kitchen. John couldn’t really be blamed for that wank. He was only human, after all.
“Did he leave a dent in the wall when he kicked open the door?” Gilly asked. “They’ll take that out of your deposit, you know. The property owners will have to fix it up before it’s rented again.”
“See?” Sherlock said, tapping his finger against the screen. His arm brushed against John’s cheek as he gestured. “Dozens of people agree with me, John.
“I—” John’s head was swimming. It felt a bit like the room was spinning. “Married?” He was repeating himself, he knew, but he wasn’t sure of what else to say.
“Huh,” John said. “Seems like Declan was expecting a bit more action on this island than tending to the sheep.”
“Now that we’re over,” Mary said, “now that you don’t have to tell me what you think I want to hear, what you think will keep me happy, can you finally be honest with me? About Sherlock?”
Sherlock was nearly running along the cliff edge now, trying to get to one particular spot that jutted out to the side, following footprints that weren’t even there. John watched Sherlock’s shoes squeak and slip along the grass. A bit of rock escaped from under Sherlock’s foot and bounced off the cliff. John couldn’t even hear it hit the water over the roar of the waves.
It was a mistake, John knew it was a mistake, but it didn’t feel very much like a mistake. It felt like the thing that had been missing, the piece of the puzzle that made John understand the picture. Sherlock knelt above him, grasping his thighs and moving with a slowness that made John want to scream, and John needed for this moment to never end.
” John said. He grabbed for the journal and caught it this time, a handful of pages in his fist. However, Fitz wasn’t ready to give up so easily and gave a mighty tug, nearly ripping the thing from John’s hand.
), and he remembered that it was nearly impossible to get a cab in this area. The sun was starting to tuck itself behind the buildings, preparing for nightfall, and the day had gotten noticeably colder. John dug his hands into his pockets and started walking, hoping to find a willing cab or a nearby Tube station soon.
“I…” John was about to find some way to ask Claire how she knew, if she had any inkling if Sherlock felt the same way, like the teenager he had apparently turned into, but he was interrupted by Sherlock shouting after him.
They sped up together, each recognizing when the time for slow and gentle had reached its end. John’s hips pumped up into Sherlock and Sherlock moved faster against John, angling himself just so. His fingernails dug into John’s chest, leaving little marks in the skin. John didn’t seem to mind. He slid his hand along Sherlock’s body, wrapping his fingers around Sherlock’s cock. He lifted himself onto an elbow for purchase, thrusting harder, harder, harder. His hand tightened around Sherlock’s cock, stroking. The bed groaned beneath them, but they were louder by far.
Sherlock separated from him suddenly, but kept John’s face in his hands. John would have been worried that the dumb grin was back, but at the moment he found himself panting a bit, struggling to maintain his breathing. A gust of wind tousled Sherlock’s curls, and he looked like something blown in from the sea.
“My thoughts exactly,” Sherlock said. “I told him we’d look into it in a day or two. After we unpack.”
Sherlock’s eyes were back on his feet. He shuffled a bit from side to side, twiddling with the binoculars.
John felt as if he were dissolving into the sea. He could barely breathe. “Sherlock,” he said, “You have to kiss me. Right bloody now.”
John continued along the path that hugged the edge of the island, craning his neck to look for Sherlock all the while. He did his best not to recall the events of the morning before, Sherlock scampering as close to the slick edges of the cliffs as possible, craning over the sharp drops as if the laws of gravity didn’t apply to him. He tried not to picture Sherlock losing his footing, pitching over, crushing himself on the rocks. Being swept away by the sea, never to be discovered by John or anybody else. His body carried all the way to the Americas, perhaps. John tried very hard not to think of any of that. Yet, there was no sign of Sherlock anywhere. He urged his legs to move faster.
) and a mostly-not-panicking smile. He had a feeling he didn’t accomplish either, but John leaned back against the loo again and Sherlock resumed his work.
For a moment, John thought the man would charge at him. He cursed himself for not having Declan’s gun at the ready—taking on a sheep-murderer with a knife while currently unarmed seemed a bit ill-advised. He charged towards the man anyway, knife be damned. Then the man turned, sprinting up the hill and towards the path that led to the far end of the island.
Sherlock’s mood had been unpleasant for much of the drive back to London. He spent most of it in a crotchety silence, punctuated by periodic outbursts about the incompetence of the local police department.
“Yes,” John said. He nuzzled at Sherlock’s cheek, his face a sleepy smile. “I think I’m going to have to make you come again soon. No way around it, I’m afraid.”
“You don’t have to protect us,” John said. “Once we get back to London, you don’t have to keep us safe.”
If John was being even more honest with himself—and he was finding that this second pint was only increasing his levels of honesty—he found that he didn’t much care. He didn’t care what Mary’s favorite color was or what kind of tea she fancied or where she had traveled in her life. He didn’t like the lies, but he didn’t like them on principle, the way he could dislike some dictator in a country he’d barely heard of without letting it ruin his day. He ought to be upset, he knew. He ought to be raging and infuriated and yelling at her nonstop, because to be upset with her meant that he
). Sherlock pulled John against him, working his mouth open, kissing him as if he meant to devour the whole of him in just that one act, and John felt his roots sink into Sherlock, winding between the crevices of his bones, twisting deep into his core.
He smiles at you, a conspiratorial thing. Then he lifts his eyebrows. “I rent a flat near here,” he says. “On Baker Street. Good location. The landlady gives me quite a bargain.”
.” He bit at Sherlock’s nipple, his cock throbbing at the sound it drew from Sherlock. “You can hold doors for me or you can insist I hold them for you. Or you can slam them in my face. I don’t care.” He mouthed down Sherlock’s stomach, hands on Sherlock’s hips, holding his writhing body still. “Just don’t stop touching me,” he said. “Don’t ever stop touching me.”
“How did you learn all this stuff?” John asked once he trusted his voice to sound like him again. “The calming stuff? The bit about bodies and breathing?”
John realized that this was the second time he caught himself leering at Sherlock tonight. He rubbed at his eyes, forcing himself to look away.
The man gave you back the exact amount of money you’d put in his cup throughout the week. Likely the same coins. He remembered you. He saw you with those deep-sea eyes and he remembered you. He kept the coins and gave them back. The whole of it feels so fantastical, something harkening back to those fever dreams you had when they all thought you’d be dead in a day, and you’re glad that he gave the money back after all because you need something tangible just to convince yourself of your own sanity.
from me, Sherlock?” John shouted. Sherlock was less than an arm’s reach away, so close John could feel the heat coming off his body. His face was red, his eyes shimmering.
“You know what might give you some peace in your soul?” Angelo asked. “A nice stroll in the London night. I’ve always found the city to be quite peaceful at night, don’t you?”
Sherlock smiled. “Indeed.” He relaxed his grip on John’s hands and John had his wrists free in an instant, swinging a leg over Sherlock and flipping the both of them over. Sherlock’s back hit the mattress with an
” With that, he tore from the bedroom and clattered down the stairs, leaving John blinking and bleary behind him.
“Well,” John said. “I’d hate to sully your genius with my idiocy. I suppose I’ll stop helping on cases, then.” The words tasted bitter. John could have been sick all over them.
“I’m sure you will be,” John said, not particularly sure at all. “And I’m sure you’ll want to.” He gestured about the room—what was left of it, that is. “You’ll be okay here? You’ll stay safe? That man—whoever he is—is still after you, you know.”
John started, but his brain was still a bit too disjointed to finish the thought. His body was slipping away again, exhaustion reclaiming his muscles.
The boat was ten or so meters away from the rocks where Sherlock stood at this point. They were close enough not to need the mobile anymore, and the man slipped the thing back into his pocket. Sherlock did the same. The man moved to the bow, leaning forward. “The flash drive,” he said.
“I—” John had lines here. He was sure of it. They seemed, at the moment, to have fallen out of his head entirely.
“...it is my impression that we have little to no control over what we feel,” Sherlock said, “and for whom.”
John almost didn’t notice Sherlock at first. From the top of the hill by the café, Sherlock was just another grey lump on the beach, partially hidden amidst all the others. Then John noticed that the one particular grey lump had wild curls fluttering madly in the breeze. John felt the edges of his lips tug into a smile, despite himself. He started down the hill, towards the cliffs that lined the beach.
Sherlock stood from his position on his chair, bounding off the cushions and leaping in front of John in nearly a single stride.
The police had questions for the two of them, of course, and they both had to give their statements. There were more than a few questions aimed at exactly how three dead bodies ended up with them on a heretofore uninhabited island. However, by this point in his familiarity with Sherlock, John was fairly used to talking to the police and explaining how the body of a criminal or three just so happened to turn up alongside them. He had a feeling that it wouldn’t be the last time he had this particular conversation with law enforcement.
“One of them was unemployed for the better part of a year before she died,” Sherlock said, “and went on pretending as if she had a job. Another one hid the fact that he was homosexual from his family, friends, and girlfriend.
“Pretty sure there’s some sort of law against that,” John said. “Interspecies romance. Seems frowned upon.”
"I won't press," Sherlock said. "And whatever your answer is, I will trust you and will say nothing more on the matter. But please tell me honestly, John—is this what you want?"
am danger, John,” Sherlock said. “Me. This life I lead. Don’t you see?” He seemed frantic, wild. “I can’t stop you being hurt, being in danger, being killed. The men I tangle with will target you, attack you, tie you up and throw you into boats time and time again. Strap Semtex to your chest. Aim a sniper rifle at you. I’ll always try to save you, John. I promise. I’ll try until I bleed.” He placed a hand over John’s chest, as if checking for his breath, a heartbeat. “But I’m not a superhero. I’m human. I’ll fail. I almost failed, just now.”
Outside, the rain turned to a sheet. Water pelted the glass, vibrating the whole of the greenhouse. The rain washed down the sides of the building in thick rivulets, obscuring the manor that lay beyond.
John was suddenly very tired. The whole back half of him was wet and muddy from the ground, the damp seeking through the fabric of his trousers and giving him a chill. Between his lack of food intake and his recent panic, his legs felt unsteady, reminding him that a trek across the whole of the island may not be within their capabilities at the moment. A headache pressed on his temples and poked at the backs of his eyes. The old anger was still scratching at his chest, but he mostly felt sad and exhausted. He sighed, and even that small action seemed to take an impossible amount of effort.
“Sometimes if the contestant made a winning choice he would show them straight away,” Sherlock continued. “Sometimes he would offer them multiple options to choose from. Sometimes he would raise the cash value he was offering them in the middle of a deal.”
John rubbed at his eyes with the heel of his hand. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he said. “Are you really surprised that your death hurt me?”
It only got worse from there. All plausible deniability that it was Sherlock in his dreams had vanished, as it was now Sherlock on top of him with John's legs flung over his shoulders, gasping down at him with a pained expression as John moaned beneath him. It was Sherlock on his knees in front of John, looking up at him through his eyelashes as John’s cock was buried deep in his throat. It was Sherlock’s mouth on his, shoving John against a wall and grinding a thigh between his legs until John was a shuddering wreck, nearly coming in his pyjamas once again. He didn’t wank—he
“John,” Sherlock said, but he had nothing else to say aside from John’s name anymore. The water from the falls had gotten into his eyes and it stung. It washed down his cheeks and tasted like salt in his mouth.
A fragment of Declan’s journal that managed to actually work its way into John’s consciousness floated to the surface. “Yeah,” John said. “Declan wrote something about talking to Will a bit when he brought the tours over.” John furrowed his brow. “Odd. Will said he didn’t know Declan very well.”
Sherlock nodded, and for a moment there was a crack in his face, a flicker of sadness slipping through. Then it was gone, and John couldn’t be certain that he hadn’t just imagined the whole thing. Sherlock flipped the blinker, peered out the window, pulled the car back onto the highway.
As it turned out, that was all John’s stomach was willing to take. John coughed and choked and tried to make his way to the edge of the boat, but Darren seemed to know what was to happen before John did. The next thing John knew, he had a large grey bucket shoved into his hands. Darren nodded at him with the calm of a man who had done this hundreds of times.
By the time they made it to Sherlock’s bed, John was down to his vest and Sherlock’s shirt was off completely and both of their trousers were open. They fell side-by-side onto Sherlock’s mattress, mouths on each other’s, limbs everywhere. Sherlock wrapped his arm around John, grabbing at his arse, pulling him close. He could hear the rattle of unhooked belts, the scrape of zippers as their hips ground together. John was hard, so hard against him. Sherlock hooked a leg over John’s hips and set a little rhythm, thrusting himself against John in teasing strokes. John made a choked sound as they slid together. His hands were in Sherlock’s hair, his tongue moving against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock leaned into John. His nose nudged at a bit of hair just over John’s ear. “And you still want this?” he whispered.
Sherlock’s mobile buzzed. Sherlock flopped to the side, reaching for the mobile where it lay on the nightstand with a blind, floundering hand.
John couldn’t help the little smile that flickered across his face. “Of course you aren’t,” he said. “Although you should probably be a little sorry. You certainly make it difficult to keep a girlfriend.”
“I didn’t always know,” Sherlock said, words flying from his mouth without checking with him first. “Right after, I didn’t remember either. I didn’t take advantage, you have to know—we were both very… I wouldn’t have ever…” He shook his head. “Not relevant. If I had remembered right after, I would have... Well, I don’t know. I didn’t choose to remember. But at your wedding, after the dance, right when you found out about the baby, you smiled at me and… It doesn’t matter.” Sherlock paused, tried to organize the words spilling out of him. “And then you were married,” he said. “You and Mary. And...and Rosie on the way. And I...I couldn’t. I’m sorry.”
“Yeah,” John said. “You must not have worked with us before.” He hung up. “On their way,” he whispered to Sherlock. “What’s the plan?”
“You’re too kind,” John said, smiling. Sherlock was busy making origami swans out of the both of their napkins.
“I lived with you,” Sherlock said. “I lived with you for eighteen months. I live with you now. I’ve never found your behaviors to be impossible.”
“And I want you to come for me,” John said. “This very instant.” He gave their cocks a rough stroke.
“I have warm bodies on my shore for a season,” Sherlock said. “But there will come a day—sooner rather than later—when I am uninhabited. Molly will eventually date every sociopath in the city and finally find herself an actual viable partner. Mrs. Hudson will want to move somewhere pleasant and sunny in her golden years. Lestrade will be promoted or retire and have no use for me anymore. And you…” Sherlock looked up at John and his words died out. John felt something sharp steal through his chest. He certainly didn’t need Sherlock to speak the words out loud again:
Somewhere in John’s rapid-firing, disjointed mind, he felt quite like the biscuit-thieving man at the moment. It both did and didn’t make sense simultaneously.
He separates from you just enough to get a hand on you. He squeezes, tugs, strokes. You nearly lose your legs. The sounds you’re making are humiliating. He bites your lip and you shiver.
“So, would she have used her real name, then?” John realized that he still—after a year of marriage to the woman—did not know what her real name was.
Sherlock had looked bloody breathtaking that night, John remembered. With the lights from the street flickering on his pale skin, his sharp eyes scanning the street, taking in the whole of the night around them, he looked like something that ought to be in the Louvre, some masterpiece for which there could never be a convincing replica, something cordoned off behind thick ropes and surly security guards. Something not to be touched. John, however, had felt his fingers itch just looking at him.
“Sherlock,” he gasped. “Oh god, Sherlock.” There was something to John’s voice, a sort of new knowledge, as if he had just made a discovery that was of the greatest importance.
Sherlock studied John with a grave expression. “I’m afraid there’s no hope,” he said. “We’ll have to tell all the tourists that you’re a mute.”
He ought to sleep, he knew. Everything in his body was pointing towards sleep. As such, John was rather surprised when he heard himself speak.
“And two years later,” John said. “When you reappeared in London after being gone, why did you return? And not the terrorist attack—you didn’t give a lick about that. Why did you really return?”
Gilly was overjoyed, beaming and bouncing around her living room. He couldn’t help but smile as he watched her. She had quite a lot of energy to her, and her joy was palpable. She was happy, John thought. He had made her happy. Something about that fact made him feel a bit happy himself.
“These are where the Islanders used to live,” Conor explained, jogging alongside John. “The houses were small. Only two rooms.”
But Sherlock was already striding from the room. “Best get a move on,” he said, already partway down the stairs. “An island full of sheep awaits us.”
“He’s hacked into the security system,” Sherlock breathes. “He can deactivate the system remotely, can work all the doors and locks as needed.” He smiles. “He’s clever, this one.”
Sometime that evening, John and Sherlock removed themselves from the beach. Sherlock cut the binds on John’s ankles and the two managed to slip and stumble their way up the hill, arms wrapped around the other, the rain driving their hair into their faces.
John shrugged, a small smile flitting across his face. “Just trying to be sure I get a good night’s sleep. I want to be on high alert for this bloke who’s coming to kill us.”
“Your enthusiasm is palpable, John,” Sherlock said. He flung the covers back, baring the mattress for John to sit himself upon. As soon as John lowered himself down, arranging the pillows behind him, Sherlock tossed the covers over John’s legs.
John nodded again. He didn’t seem capable of speech at the moment. He turned, placed the bottle of wine on the kitchen table, and walked upstairs to the bedroom to take long, shaking breaths into his pillow.
The man lifts his beer. “Enjoying a drink,” he says. He points to the telly. “And watching the match.”
John nodded, and Sherlock’s hand slipped behind him. Turning him. Pulling him closer. John went to make a sound of protest, to push Sherlock away, to keep distance between their bodies. Before he could do any of that, they were pressed together, John’s erection pushing against Sherlock’s hip. John could feel his face flush red even as his cock throbbed with the sensation, and an apology was already forming in his mouth before he froze. His eyes popped open, gasping.
Sherlock made a noise that didn’t sound human and for a moment John thought he was falling, about to crumble against the wall. Then both of Sherlock’s hands were on John’s head, gripping him, shaking with his breaths. John pulled off Sherlock’s cock with a long suck, circling the head with his tongue before sinking back down again, taking his cock in as far as he could. Sherlock’s hands were tensing and relaxing against John’s scalp, at war with himself, holding on to some scrap of control. John touched Sherlock's hand. Squeezed. Nodded.
The two arrived at the sheep. It looked as if even more flies had discovered the body, and the smell had intensified somewhat. Will nodded at the body, as if it was exactly what he had expected. “Not very well,” he said, unfolding the tarp and wrapping it around the carcass.
Sherlock waggled his mobile in his hand. “If the Holiday Killer indeed works for the rental company in some capacity,” he said, “he has just been provided with substantial evidence that a couple has booked a remote cottage in Keswick. I thought it best to increase our odds that the killer would come after us.
“The Taibhse Brothers,” Sherlock repeated. He glanced up and rolled his eyes at John’s blank expression. “A criminal duo rapidly gaining notoriety across Ireland as rather savvy bank robbers. Although that is a bit of a misrepresentation of what they do. They don’t just rob banks—they rob everything. Restaurants, clothes shops, even a sweet shop once.
“If anyone tries to take you from me,” he hissed, “I’ll kill them. I’ll tear them to pieces with my bare hands. You’re mine. Nobody touches you but me.”
More barking. Louder. And the scratching at the door had intensified. Fitz would leave marks in the wood, no doubt.
You shrug. It might sound accusatory, what you’re saying. Other blokes might be angry, you suppose, finding out that some homeless man was putting everyone on. You aren’t angry though—just curious. You’ve never met someone who purposefully shammed as a tramp before. You’ve got questions, is all.
, that Sherlock couldn’t have imagined but now would never forget. Sherlock made a noise that was just beyond him and wrapped his arms around John’s back, tugging him closer. John shifted his weight and slid down on top of Sherlock, slotting their legs together. Sherlock felt the press of John’s erection on his hip and ground upwards against him. He needed to hear John moan again. He needed to have John make those sounds, those sounds that were rattling through his brain, drowning out that damned song. It was all terrible and he didn’t want any of it, but Sherlock couldn’t stop.
A smile flickered across John’s face, one of those involuntary ones. He felt something in him lighten ever so slightly. “I thought of you too,” he said.
he insisted), Sherlock and John had saved his restaurant from sticky fingers, burglaries, and even arson on more occasions than was desirable (
“That’s nice,” Birdy said, and didn’t ask any further questions on the subject. John tried to lift an eyebrow for a shared joke with Sherlock—
“Not exactly,” Sherlock said. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense to flee to a city where one has no contacts. She would need to assume a new identity once there, different from the one associated with the plane ticket, and quickly.” Sherlock fingers flew over his phone. “Fortunately, I’ve maintained some of my Amsterdam contacts from my...” he glanced at John, “time away.”
Sherlock wished that John would lift his hands from his eyes, because he had the feeling that he ought to be memorizing, cataloguing the bits of John’s face for permanent storage in his Mind Palace before he lost the chance forever, and he very much wanted to be sure he got John’s eyes just right.
“Shit,” Mary wrinkled her nose. “I was hoping to figure out who he was. Who he might be working for.” She shook her head. “How the hell are all you people finding me?”
good, just not in the way Sherlock meant. “It wasn’t. But don’t stop.” He moved his hips up towards Sherlock again. He was so hard he felt as if he were burning, and wondered if he might come just from Sherlock looking at him, whispering
Sherlock snorted, his face a cruel approximation of a smile. He tugged at John’s grip but John held him tight, his arms digging into the flesh of Sherlock’s bicep. He would rip Sherlock’s arm clean off his body if it meant getting to speak his piece.
Everything was cold and shaking and he coughed and sputtered and heaved and it seemed as if all there was to him was water. His body jerked and twisted and he coughed up a wave that felt like fire as it left him. He twitched and closed in on himself and more water came out, heaving up from the depths of him and splattering against something that sounded like ground. There were hands on him, turning him. Somebody saying something. Perhaps his name. John coughed and hacked and collapsed and breathed, his aching lungs expanding and sucking in air air air.
He ran a slow finger up the length of his erection, his breath catching in his throat. A bead of pre-ejaculate formed at the tip of his cock and he swirled his thumb around the moisture. His body shuddered at the sensation. He thought of John.
John’s fingers moved through his hair, gentle. Delicate. “Today you charged into the flat of a man stealing money from his family,” he said. “Ran directly into the wrong side of a cricket bat like some death-obsessed wanker. Seems a bit mad to me.”
Everything was wrong about this. John wasn’t meant to be the one propped up in the loo, bleeding onto their floor. John wasn’t meant to be the one who needed patching up. John wasn’t meant to be the one who was hurt.
You collapse onto him, his leg dropping off your shoulder. His head is still tipped back and he’s panting into the headboard and you’re panting into his neck. Your cock slips out of him and he makes a little gasping noise and you bloody miss him already—you were just inside him seconds ago and you already miss the snug warmth of his body around you. He is soft and floppy beneath you. He strokes a limp hand over your back and you want to grab his arms and wrap them around you.
“Of course not,” Sherlock said. “A werewolf who carefully monitors an island for the comings and goings of the O’Sullivans would never be so careless as to make a
Sherlock.” John paused on the steps, sending a hand out to brace himself against the wall. Sherlock waited as John panted, fingernails digging into the wallpaper. Sherlock wondered if they were to spend the remainder of their evening right where they stood, moving up the stairs at an approximate speed of one per hour.
Sherlock stepped into the tub, hissing at the heat that still lingered in the water. He settled behind John, tucking his legs on either side of John’s. John leaned backwards against Sherlock’s chest and rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and John felt
“We don’t want to keep Conor out here at night,” Darren said, “what with all the—” he gestured at the sheep. “And we don’t want just one of us out here either. Just in case.”
John felt a heat sweep through his body, something like joy fluttering in his chest. “That was…”  he said. “I mean, I’d hoped it was real. But I thought you might’ve just been shamming.”
“I had a feeling,” John said. “Listen. I’ll care for Rosie, don’t you worry about her. I’ll be sure that she’s safe and happy and cared for. And I’ve got plenty of help in all that. When you’re ready to come back to London,” he paused, considered, “
“John,” Sherlock said. His fingers were wrapped around John’s arms rather tightly now. He seemed afraid to let go.
John kept his eyes fixed on the larger man as he faded. If he slipped under, John had a chance. He could right himself. He could stage some sort of an attack. What, specifically, he could do with his wrists and ankles bound, he hadn’t the foggiest, but he needed to do
“That’s very romantic of you, John,” Sherlock said, his back to John as socks flew from his dresser. “But it’s just behavior. Physical touch. It is rote. Acting. It means nothing.”
“Was nothing,” Darren said. “I hope you get to the bottom of all this.” He shook his head at the sheep, frowning. “Poor sheep,” he said. He turned and started back across the field. John followed, but Sherlock remained with the carcass, abusing the zoom feature on his camera.
,” he said again, sitting up once more in bed. It still sounded a bit like someone else’s voice, and whoever said it sounded angry. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, deciding to give up on sleep until the storm passed.
Sherlock launched himself at the figure, tackling the man at his midsection. The two of them tumbled to the ground, rolling and grunting and scrabbling at each other. John heard a rough sound of skin on skin—someone landing a punch—and sprinted towards them.
own a set of brass knuckles and John asked her to try to mention the website at least once, they let her face the swarm of reporters on her own. Based on the chatter punctuated by occasional bouts of laughter, she seemed to be holding her own just fine.
“Alright,” Sherlock said. He opened his eyes. “Alright.” He pulled back from John, lifted his hands off John’s body, leaving a trace of warmth behind. “You can say it now.”
Sherlock leaned forward, crowding further into John’s space. “And what would you know about honesty?” he growled.
The waiter walked by and Sherlock grabbed John’s hand, staring at him in a way that could only be described as
John decided not to give Sherlock the satisfaction of knowing that he was right. Sherlock already knew he was right, anyway. “How long did it take you to guess my password this time?” John asked.
Sherlock began to move away, his hand sliding from John, likely hoping to give him space while he slept. John caught Sherlock’s hand, holding it firmly to his chest.
Sherlock’s response was hungry, lunging forward and shoving John against the side of the tub, his mouth on John’s lips, his jaw, his neck, his chest. “God yes,” Sherlock growled.
“It certainly isn’t,” Mary said. “Because I never stood a chance, now did I? It would have been a youth league against Manchester United if it was. I didn’t compete, John. I never did, never had any interest in it. But,” she said carefully, “I’m fairly certain I got clobbered all the same.”
“Oh, you know I’m chuffed,” Mrs. Hudson said, patting at John’s shoulder. “Just. Keep the door closed, won’t you?”
Rosie studied them. “Gross,” she said. She turned her attention back to the telly, where a couple dressed as two halves of a horse were discussing whether or not to keep two hundred American dollars or try for whatever was hidden inside a box.
John tried his best to remember his lines. He practiced them today, just a few hours ago. He practiced what he was to say to Mary once he found her. He practiced them while lying in bed, trying and failing to sleep. He practiced them in the very bed in which Sherlock joined him later, where everything felt right and wonderful for all too brief of a moment before John cocked everything up again. He had lines. He knew it.
As it turned out, however, John didn’t find Sherlock in the field. Instead, he was by the little stone beehive.
John waited out the silence for a moment. “Right,” he said, scrolling further. “How’s this? Brother gone missing. Left behind a note that said
