"Of course, I'm not leaving, Sherlock. Never again." Sherlock nods, finally letting go of John's waist. John steps away with effort, draining the last of his mug. "Rosie okay to stay here?"
I made a mistake."
"But you didn't buy this one," John says, flipping it over and seeing the engraving there, including the three little x's.
’ Regardless of his demanding, pleading or asking, the 60-ish seconds are up and his muscles convulse in tiny shakes.
It was, perhaps, too close an echo of the internal debate he'd had even night since he'd put Sherlock Holmes in the 'bad decisions' box.

It splits his face open and, truly, midnight sun pours from it.
"You must be very bored," John offers with a smile.
“Yes. Lestrade had brought in a very interesting case and I have been awake for 72 hours solving it."
She's funny, she laughs at his not-funny jokes and she was obviously pulling the first time they'd met when he was at the job interview.

Getting angry at Mycroft would do nothing. Involving Mycroft in any way had gotten them in this situation in the first place. No, this was about Sherlock and John, two people who-- god, two people who loved each other.

"When we had Chinese," Sherlock admits quietly.
He does not. He rubs the back of his neck, the blush finally breaking free, "No, I--"

"Great." John says, still smiling. "Sherlock, can I kiss you?"
“What do you want from me, Sherlock?”
“I don’t… I’ve never done anything like that.”
“No.”
“Holy shit, John. He’s bloody gorgeous!" John's head snaps over to look at him, as though he wasn't just thinking the same thing. "What?" Adam continues. "I did some experimenting at university. Didn’t you?”
It is a comforting thought. It is a very dishonest one.
"Mrs Hudson, as much as I appreciate the sentiment, today is really not a good day for--" John has closed his eyes somewhere between the fifteenth and seventeenth step and he can
“John Watson.” His voice sounded gruff, deep and low like John has imagined a hundred times, remembers every day. Underneath the familiar gravelly sound, his voice is strained. He smelt like chemicals, bleach? and cigarettes and hot Earl Grey tea. John just manages to stop himself from leaning in and smelling him more, drowning in the scent; held back by eleven months of silence.
“A big gust of wind, and you tried to stop it instinctively and your hand got in the way, how about that?” It’s nice, if a bit dodgy, but John nods. The nurse pops two ibuprofen out of a blister packet, and goes to fill up a cup of water in the sink. She hands both to him and watches him take them. “I understand the frustration,” she says, “healing is a long and vacillating process. Everyone gets upset and angry, but everyone heals eventually. Alright?” John nods, having nothing say. He’d already yelled at his doctor today, he didn’t want to do it again. These people were being kind, really, and doing their job, which was to look after him. How many times has John dealt with a belligerent patient, or a grief-eaten family member during his time as a doctor? And for all the yelling and screaming and accusations they hurled at him, it didn’t change what they were going through.
"Yep, still here, and I know he is, too. Put him on the bloody phone." There's some shuffling and then,
He wasn't sure how Sherlock was going to react when he'd figured out what Mycroft had done, but he figured it would derail the rest of what he wanted to say and he was just warming up. "I was counting down the

Once again, I have no idea about army bases and how they function. Maybe they have a plethora of coffee? Or maybe they have constant access to the internet. John also doesn’t have a phone in this fic– listen, I don’t KNOW.
It won’t happen again, but John doesn’t say it, because then it’s like admitting something. The nurse just tuts at him and stands up.
John flushes, and hopes the torch light doesn't show it.
“Not you.”
Sherlock berating John for drinking too much whiskey/coffee whilst being a drug addict feels very in-character to me. I don’t know why.
“No. You’re awake, Sherlock.”
make note of the time jump, these will happen now
John promises himself,
“Then why?”
“That is… actually fair enough." John says, feeling himself deflate against Sherlock's infallible logic. "Gently next time, then? and only if it’s an invited topic of conversation.”
Despite how much John had hated his residency at the hospital when it actually came to leaving, he couldn't help but feel like he was being kicked to the dirt. He had a BAF rent-controlled 'flat', which was really just a bedsit; a bed, a kitchen and one door hiding a tiny bathroom, his army uniform, a few t-shirts and jeans he'd been wearing the past six months, the cane he'd been given after his first physical and some stuff they'd shipped back from Afghanistan. John didn't even know he'd left stuff behind.
"Mrs Hudson is fine,"
He just waits until the nighttime to take them, and likely only a low dose. No one checks on him because they have no need to, he’s perfectly in control of himself come day time.
"I guess," John mutters, mostly to himself. "Christ, okay. Rosie, love, we're going to go out with Sherlock, okay?"
You don’t participate in group therapy, you barely participate in individual sessions. I
When John thinks about his and Sherlock's relationship, he's aware of how dysfunctional it is. Their meeting was unique, their connection tenuous. They'd barely known each other six months and never actually met in person. Sherlock is devastatingly clever, blessed with otherworldly beauty and, according to some, a bit dangerous. Even discarding the concerns that came with that, John was... well, he had been clever once, perhaps. And he is, as he had described to Sherlock, ordinary looking. All he'd had going for him was his role as doctor and soldier; admirable, impactful. Now he is barely one and could never again be the other. He was nothing compared to Sherlock.
I'm sorry
The anger and disbelief curdles the hunger in his stomach, and he throws the folded menu on the nearest table and does his best attempt at stomping his way back to his shitty bedsit. He’d left his phone at home in an attempt at
"How do you know that? Have you asked? Have you spoken to her about it?" Harry just shakes her head, numbly. "I don't know why we're even here. Why we're having this discussion. You're not going to listen. Why did you come, Harry?"
“I want to talk about your limp.”
because Sherlock is
“In so many words, yes.” This time he lets it out.
“it’s John— John Watson. I’d like to talk to Mycroft.. please.”
“You okay?”
As John turns over this foolish idea in his head, he busied himself with locking the door behind him and wiping his feet on the front mat. He’s hanging his coat up on the hook when there’s a quiet ‘thump’ from upstairs and John can’t help the smile that spreads over his face. Awake, then, but being quiet. Perhaps Mrs Hudson had roused at him again for keeping her up, or he received a noise complaint from the neighbours.
John thinks about all of the other things he wants to say, but swallows them down. Sherlock is likely still reeling from his nightmares and John’s intrusion, and would be a bit more conducive to a conversation tomorrow, a very important conversation. Because this experience had made up John’s mind about something: he is never leaving 221B, or Sherlock, ever again.
“John, please. You need some sleep.”
“Great, thank you.”
“Yes, he did.” The thought of Sherlock's admission made his heart stutter once.
I have told you this before, John. Mycroft is the reason I am here. I have been sectioned.
I have never read ‘Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry’ and don’t actually know a lick about it, but it was nearly four thousand pounds on the website I went to – ?? highway robbery, I think.
He once again forces the thoughts away, telling himself to focus on Sherlock now. The man looks exhausted, completely wrung out from lack of sleep and nightmares.
"Jesus, Sherlock. It's Friday. You haven't had proper food in over a week?"
Hey Sherlock, thirty minutes? I know we only called last night but I like being able to see you. It makes things feel more… normal.
Sherlock
John wakes up hard. It's an unexpected reaction, considering the dreams he fuzzily remembers were of whipping sand and bloody bullets, but he feels it when he rolls over onto his stomach and his body instinctively ruts into the mattress.
He's not only an addict but a rape survivor, and god John doesn't care, obviously, it doesn't make him want this any less, he just has to
John points at him, “I’ll answer it if you answer this question.”
unspoken but Sherlock could likely deduce it just by how he used full stops and exclamation marks or whatever. It was only when he checked his emails a few days later that he'd realised it hadn't sent.
“And that’s what this is about, isn’t it? The doctor you’ve been conversing with.”
“It’s just that…. He’s not mentally unstable, is he? He’s brilliant." John is gushing before he knows it, and he curses himself. "He’s more than capable of making decisions for himself and if you just spoke with him about it, properly, maybe he would be willing to seek help without having all of his autonomy taken away, don’t you think?”
John ignores how heavy his limbs are getting with each passing day. He knows he's tired. Despite his contentment during his waking hours, he's still having nightmares. He's still waking in the night with a shout tearing out of his lungs, sure he will be soaked in the blood, his or someone else's, sometimes Sherlock's.
"What do you want?" Sherlock asks in a voice so quiet and muffled by the coat of his Belstaff that John almost misses it. He smiles instead and leans in just a bit closer.
“No, it’s okay.”
keep interfering, sticking your stupid nose where it doesn't belong. I don't believe you, not until I hear it from Sherlock."
“Uh, no. I live here.”
John sighs, “Sherlock, I’m trying to help.”
Sherlock nods for a few seconds, then shakes his head, presses his lips into a thin line and manages a shuddering breath. "You could've died," he offers eventually.
“I told you, I don’t have any control over that.”
Sherlock nods, “I do not understand but I concede.”
No, it is very obvious Mycroft is erecting 'do not trespass' signs around his younger brother, meshed fences and barbed wire in curls. He's waiting for John to give up. It's misled, Mycroft is a right prick, but he's depending on John to follow the plan.
“I’m always above the rules.”
exacerbated by some recent event? Mary's death? Their fight? or, everything that happened at Sherrinford?
John watches, enraptured by Sherlock's soft voice and his skilfully moving lips. He's too tired to really think about
“Not bloody likely.” He mutters.
“Night, Sherlock.”
His mind is made up before he'd even consciously thought it, his body moving of it's own accord to fetch his coat and throw it over his shoulders, keys jangling as he snatches them off the wall and makes his way down to the street. He hails a cab, maybe an unnecessary cost, but he wants to get back to Baker Street as soon as possible. His fingers tap against his knee, a nail catching on the rough denim as they drive. He peels it off, stuffing it in his coat pocket as the driver pulls up to the familiar building. He shoves a few notes at the driver without even counting them, but it must be enough because the man only grunts and peels off the curb, leaving John standing before 221 Baker Street.
"Why?" Sherlock asks, curious. His eyes rove over John's face again like he could read the answers etched into his skin. It's likely he could. "You haven't had any sexual relations for nearly nine months, you'll be getting incredibly lonely any day now. There's no shame, John, in--"
Hello, if you are reading this do you want me to just post all of the chapters? They are complete. I am just unsure.
“John, are you asleep?”
“What, Sherlock?”
“You think you know my brother?”
"Not true at all," Sherlock shakes his head emphatically, "you are a highly skilled doctor, John." He seems to notice the conviction in his voice, and likely the compliment (which was not easy or free for Sherlock to give), too late and shrinks in on himself, the walls John had nearly slid past slamming back up again and trapping him outside. "Are you here for a reason, Doctor Watson?"
“I’m just… so tired, Sherlock.”
“Um… thanks?” He flashes a quick smile at Sherlock, ticking the 'yes' box for 'did you provide medication to the patient' about an amputation.
"Hmm, and trust issues, it says.. PTSD, an intermittent tremor, a psychosomatic limp? All very interesting, Doctor Watson."
John,
He pauses his pacing, pushing aside the thought that the doctor was right, he will have to start using his cane if he doesn’t want to cause permanent damage. His leg, he can deal with. He will go to therapy, and walk with his cane, and have Epsom salt baths with lavender oil in it every night if that will help. He’ll do it.
"No, I don't believe you--"
"If Rosie and I are going to stay here tonight, I'll have to get a few things. I'll take a cab, and come right back. I'll just be a few hours."
Mycroft?
He understands a bit how Sherlock feels.
He strokes himself faster and faster, mimicking the vision of Sherlock bobbing down on him, until the eidetic vision of his fingers tangled in Sherlock's wet hair and the contented hum of the detective around his prick tips him over the teetering edge and he's coming, barely able to hold back a groan as he spills over the shower floor.
He clicks on it, not anticipating the flip of his stomach when the page loads with a photo of Sherlock front and centre. He is wearing a purple silk shirt with the top three buttons undone, exposing his beautiful marble throat and collarbones. His mop of curly hair is styled back so it doesn't sit over his face, nor is it frizzy the way John had seen it sometimes after Sherlock had showered (the fact that Sherlock had been willing to let John see him without his usual self-presenting armour had made a medley of desire and affection burn in his gut). His fingers are steepled like how they often are when he is thinking, but instead of his usual closed eyes, they're open and staring intently into the camera. The gaze makes John's stomach flip again.
Forcing his eyes to return to the paperwork, John chews on his lip. “I think it’s time you left the hospital, really.” It's something he's been thinking for a bit honestly. Maybe it's wrong of him to involve himself in Sherlock's care, probably he's far too bias, really.. but he can't help but feel like Sherlock doesn't belong in that place. He's so
“Simply do not mention it again, John. I’m fine, now, see?” Sherlock does a little spin, though his entire body is still covered in a sheet. “I will not sleep again tonight, and I would like to get dressed. I doubt you would like to see me doing so, so you best leave.”
he tells himself,
the place Sherlock had spoken about on late nights, the one he had written about to John, telling him he heard him in the kitchen even when he wasn't there, the home Sherlock talked about when he said 'come home.' It felt like a shame to be doing it without Sherlock, like he should really wait until he's invited, but Mrs Hudson is calling to him from what sounds like the kitchen if the kettle noises are any indication. He steps in, immediately overwhelmed by the smell of Sherlock. It smells like cigarettes and chemicals and something softer underneath, like a shampoo or a cologne. The flat is a mess, just like Sherlock said, but John forces himself to see the organisation the way Sherlock had described it. With effort he could see it, Sherlock's haphazard pile of what looked worringly like police reports are scattered over the floor, but it does not encroach on the other parts of the floor which are dedicated to bundled up clothes, or stoppered test tubes with vaguely threatening looking liquid in. His eyes dance everywhere, taking in anything he can with greedy hunger. Bookshelves, organised by some system John can't comprehend, a skull hanging on the wall which he is vaguely curious about, a blanket on the couch which looks like it had been slept on at some point, but likely not recently. John wonders how much sleep Sherlock has been getting, when a noise at his elbow shocks him out of his reverie.
"You've been back in London for two months now?"
“Isn’t everyone ordinary to you, Sherlock?”
“You’re here to heal, Sherlock, not to get a boyfriend.”
I don't think this is how the army works... please ignore
John can't help the smile that pulls at his lips.
“No.” He responds emphatically.
“Nothing new going on at the centre?”
and maybe the poem isn't even sexual but the image of 'thrusting' and Sherlock's hips and throbbing all collide together to create a brilliant starburst of pleasure and lust and John's body is taken by the throes of orgasm and promptly, slumber.
John struggles with some low-key ableist views in this story; it is important for you to know that as a disabled person, I do NOT share these views. John will learn, in time.
"Don't be absurd, I take all of Sherlock's clients up to the living room. That's what you are, right? We get all sorts coming through here." John wonders if that's a dig at the cane in his hand, or perhaps how completely ordinary he is, or something else. He's just asking himself who this woman is he's following up the stairs of an unfamiliar house when she pulls a key from her pocket and he can't help but ask,
The question and the completely nonchalant way Sherlock says it makes John jerk back, and his inky pen strikes a long line through the report. “Jesus, f– Sherlock! Now I’ll have to rewrite this report." He scrunches up the dud paper and throws it away. "What did you just say?”
“You’re a doctor, aren’t you? In your medical opinion, Doctor, is a man who was raped and beaten, unable to defend himself because his body was wasted by heroin and cocaine and
“What else was I suppose to do? What should I have done? You were dying, Sherlock, slowly and then all at once. It’s my job to—”
Then, of course.
“Hmm…” It sounds disappointed, somehow.
"We're leaving now?" John says, surprised.
. It had been a benediction.
He wants to feel grateful when the plane finally takes off, but he just mourns the dust and the sand and heat, watching it disappear under clouds and the limits of the human eye. Someone touches him lightly on his uninjured shoulder and he doesn't look at them when they say, "maybe try to get some sleep, John." Another moment later, when they ask "is there anything I can do to help you?" he opens his mouth to say 'read to me a bit?' before he realises how absurd and unlikely that is. He shuts his mouth with a decided
“Promise me you won’t do drugs again.” John blurts out, before he berates himself. A completely foolish thing to say. But Sherlock only tilts his head again, his eyes scanning over John's face.

“Doesn’t matter now. You’ve hooked
it, hearing it said so simply, and with so much conviction, sends bursts of fierce joy through his body, making his limbs light and easy. He smiles, feeling it stretch his face which hasn't smiled enough in, Jesus, maybe years. "and I had to be sure I could handle having someone like Mycroft sticking his nose in my business. I can. It's worth it, you're worth it all." When John looks up from their linked hands, Sherlock is smiling so broadly it causes lines around his chin, and John thinks he's
“Mycroft Holmes.”
It takes every ounce of him not to crush Sherlock into a hug, aware of his need to breathe and the emotions Sherlock is already processing on his own. John is appreciative of Sherlock's sensory input and refuses to overwhelm him. Sherlock only gives a dismissive shrug which John notes and files away for later, before releasing Sherlock's hair and sliding his other hand down to cradle his face. "But you're here, and I'm here, and that's what matters, okay?" Sherlock nods and tilts his head up, his nose brushing John's cheek in the faintest kiss. The need to touch and taste and feel is nearly suffocating, but John only returns the gesture with his own nose, tracing a gentle path from his temple to the corner of his mouth, tilting up to brush the point of Sherlock's nose against his own. They're breathing the same air now and John feels
Something undefeatable is picking him apart at all of his seams, and it isn't until he feels wet and hot on his collarbone that he realises he is crying, tears colliding at his cheeks and painting glistening lines down his face. Everything hits him at once: missing Sherlock, like a thousand needles, the cuts on his hand throbbing, the pain in his shoulder, the ache of his stupid leg, and the sobs ripping out of his throat with claws and beak; leaving him completely torn apart, bloody and gasping for futile breath on the sterile white sheets of his bed.
“Why are you here?” He says, avoiding John’s question.
Right. Does it matter?”
“You’re not the first person to have asked this of me, John.” A spike of irrational jealousy hits him for a second, but he talks around it.
It takes a struggling moment for him to actually open his eyes, but when he does they're immediately drawn to the man across from him, still hovering uncomfortably in his own doorway.
His shout has drawn attention and a nurse is walking towards him. Before she can open her mouth to speak, she notices his hand. She frowns lightly, but doesn’t say anything, just walks up to him and gently lays his injured hand across the back of hers to inspect it.
I told them about the cigarettes
re: re: re: re: re: lacerations
it's the best first kiss John has had, maybe the best kiss, period. John grips Sherlock's curls in his fingers and tugs, opening his mouth even wider. They kiss for a long, slow few minutes until they have to break for breath, but even then John doesn't step out of the circle of Sherlock's legs, where his body had slotted between them. Sherlock's face is flushed and his lips are swollen from kissing and he's
"I'm good. Tired, but that's normal with that crazy girl," he says, gesturing at Rosie and smiling affectionately at her as she throws a big plastic ball across the room. "Heard anything from Lestrade? Any new cases or anything." Sherlock shakes his head, taking a drink of his tea,
"When?"
They're sitting in the rec room when Harry slumps in her seat like a cut marionette and says "Clara and I are separating." It's bitter and unexpected and it makes John angry all over again. He'd been working so hard not to be angry, but he feels it course through his veins like it'd been injected directly into his bloodstream. It heats his face and sends his hands twitching where he's holding them in his lap.
His quiet contentment is shattered when, as he lays his foot on the first step, a sound pierces the quiet night air. It sounds like a scream, but it’s twisted and dulled by the door and the walls. Without thinking, John is taking the stairs two at a time, reaching the landing of unit B and scrambling to keep his feet under him when he trips on…
They had only talked for a few months while he was in Afghanistan, but in that short time, he'd fallen in love. When he’d gotten shot, he’d spent the first month in a field hospital clinging to the last vestiges of his life, fever and infection spinning a story of nights in a big, plush bed with Sherlock and his precious curls between his fingers. In his lucid moments, he fought to help his practitioner help him, with the only goal to stay alive. He'd thought about Sherlock every day the six months in the private rehab centre, even when he tried not to. He continued to dream of Sherlock, and banish him from his waking thoughts, with only the goal to
just anybody. He was
“Yes?” He picks up the pen, knowing what's coming and not willing to look Sherlock in the face.
“That’s not a bad thing.”
“Don’t worry, dear, its not like you could see me here, sitting in the dark.”
He’d finished a shift at the surgery at 8, running late to finish paperwork, and had tossed and turned in his bed for hours after putting Rosie down, before he got up and caught a taxi to Baker Steet, unable to fight off his desire to see Sherlock.
Sherlock says it so softly that John chokes on nothing and has to cough to clear his throat. “What?”

re: Sherlock
Mrs Hudson straightens, strengthening her shoulders so she stands as tall as John, like blocking his path. “No, dear. You should be home with Rosie, shouldn’t you? What if she wakes up without her Daddy?” He knows what she’s trying to do, but it’s not working. The sound is getting more regular now, more heart wrenchingly desperate, and John is unable to stand here and let it continue. His hand darts out to grip the door knob, but Mrs Hudson is just as quick and her hand does, too. “No, John. He’s just sleeping—“
“Good.”
“Nothing. Listen, John. If you were back in London, and you saw him at a bar or walking down the street, would you pull him?”

“What does that mean?”
It's his second night at his new place, and he's got the gun sitting beside him as he flicks through loose papers. He has his first in-person session with Ella next week and he doesn't want to walk in there with nothing to say, so he's rifling through old papers to think of something. He won't talk about the gun that hasn't left his side. He's just about to give up, flicking rapidly through the pages of his leather-bound journal when he spots it. A doctor's scribble of numbers with just MH to identify it.

John reminds himself,
No. I don’t want to miss talking to you. I like talking to you.
John closes his eyes against the onslaught of feeling, both good and bad. "It need to be for
“It’s Serbia” Sherlock says after a moment.
When he'd told Sherlock, he wasn't sure what to expect. It seems he only hadn't expected Sherlock to return the sentiment. Perhaps a simple, "alright, John," or worse, Sherlock asking him to leave and not return "until you've sorted yourself out." Confessions of love had... not been it. But he is not upset, god no, he's overjoyed. The smile that spills onto his face warms his skin and the smile Sherlock gives in return is blinding.

He clicks it to reveal a long, detailed post about how to identify different kinds of bees, along with pictures of said bees which looked to be cradled in Sherlock's large hands. There is a short, painful stab of realisation that Sherlock must be out of the rehab facility to be chasing bees and posting about it on his website. To think that Sherlock is free, running after bees in London and not

Okay, so in this fic John spends near on two months in a field hospital and then six months at a rehab facility where he is a patient to NURSES, as opposed to ORDERLIES, like Sherlock was. What's the difference? (vague mumbling)
Sherlock makes a noise that sounds suspiciously like a scoff, but Sherlock’s face is blank when he replies, “Well, John, and yourself?” Before John could even reply, Sherlock continues speaking, “back in London, I can see. Based on your shoes you’ve been back on English soil for about two months. Started new work recently, then, considering a veteran's pension isn’t big enough to support any hedonistic spending. A general practice, going by the smell of antiseptic hovering around, and your hands chapped from constant washing. Couldn’t be a surgeon because of the tremor in your left hand and the nerve damage from your injury, which is in your arm, not your leg, despite your cane. It’s psychosomatic, the limp, which I’m sure you know because you’re a perfectly competent doctor. Despite your injuries and undoubtedly some flavour of PTSD judging by how little sleep you’ve been getting, you seem content enough with your return to London, and your recent date. I’m happy for you. Now if you’ll excuse me, Dr. Watson, I must be on my way.”
"Oh!" She squeals, stepping back, "well let me get a look at you!" John's body immediately stills, part shock part inherent obedience as Mrs Hudson's eyes scan his body. It feels a bit like getting hit on by an old lady and John tries not to blush at the attention. After a long moment, she pulls him silently into a hug. "Oh, John," she says in his ear, as though she's a grandmother who had dearly missed him, instead of a random stranger. Then she steps back and her hand hits his chest again, but this time it's very on purpose and paired with a frown. "Do you have any idea what you have done, John Watson?"
John shoots back
“Why?”
Reply at your earliest inconvenience,
“You saw him, then?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have shouted.”
“I was…” and John realises he doesn’t have a proper answer, not without exposing certain parts of himself. “One of Rosie’s blankets is missing, I was checking if we’d left it here.” It was technically true, though Rosie had slept fine without it.
“Whatever for?”
“Poems? I thought that’d be a bit cliché for you, Sherlock. Too much ‘sentiment.’”
He tears down the bit of tinsel hung across his door frame and slams the door shut, imagining in his head the amused eyebrow Sherlock would raise at him if he saw it. It was a bit childish, but he's in a strop and he doesn't
that flits through his head (
The statement seems to shake Sherlock, and he’s struggling to his feet. John pointedly turns his gaze away as Sherlock wrestles to get the sheet out from his legs and wraps it around himself.
“Sit." John, tired, and knowing he will be unable to get out of this conversation sits. No one gossips as much as men in the army barracks, except maybe women at spa's. "Look, mate. You say it’s just a phone call, just a letter, just a guy, but I don’t think I’ve seen anyone smile like that, fuck, since we got to this blasted place. So I’m asking, and you’re telling, what does he look like?”
“And don’t forget to email me Mycroft’s number.”
It repeats like this for what feels like eons but is actually only days. Sleep. Dream of blood and sand and war. Wake up. Shower. Physical therapy. Eat slop. Therapy with Ella on Wednesdays and therapy homework/'free time' on the other days. Dinner. Sleep. Rinse and repeat and repeat and repeat and
“You are more than your abilities as a surgeon, Doctor Watson.”
“Oh, I just thought, because you were here,” Sherlock tracks John’s hand as it waves generally at their surroundings. Sherlock frowns,
“You’re not ordinary,” Sherlock had told him emphatically, after John tried to tell a self-deprecating joke about himself. “You’re rather extraordinary John.” Sherlock had said ‘extraordinary’ the same way John said ‘brilliant’ or ‘amazing’ whenever he was complimenting Sherlock. Except, where for John it was involuntary, a reflex at the sheer magnitude of
You’re just bloody gorgeous, Sherlock. You’re the most gorgeous man I’ve ever seen. The most gorgeous person? Yes. Your… your lips, Sherlock. God, I think about your lips all the time. Have you ever kissed anyone? You asked about my sex life but I didn’t get to ask about yours, though how I would’ve gotten away with it, I’m not sure. I have a bit more of a social filter than you. Even if you haven’t, that’s—god, that’s fine. That’s good—that’s great. I would kiss you, I would love to kiss you. I would kiss down your jaw, down your long neck, along your collarbones, god, your skin is like marble. I’d dig my fingers into your crazy mop of hair, feeling it between my fingers. I’d pull on it, if you want, fuck. And I’d kiss down your chest, flick my tongue over your peaked nipples, nipping and sucking and licking until you’re writhing underneath me. I’ve never done it before but god I’d suck your cock, Sherlock. I’d take you in my mouth and I’d blow you so good you lose the ability to talk, your brilliant brain going empty. I’d moan around your hard cock as you put your hands in my hair, it’s kind of short but you could manage, and you’d tug and guide my head up and down. Fuck, and maybe you could blow me, too, with your lips and your hot fucking mouth. G od Sh
He is trying not to feel too bad for himself and his new sad, sad life when he stands up, gripping his cane to balance himself. He takes a few steps towards the door, preoccupied with trying to wrestle his wallet out of the pocket of his jacket, and walks right into a solid body. His cane clatters to the ground as he throws his hands up to catch whoever is tumbling in him, and he pulls back at the indignant huff that follows. He looks up and finds himself face to face with painfully familiar curls, blue-green-grey eyes which he has been aching for the last ten months of his recovery but had recently forced himself to forget.
"I came to give you this," she pulls something out of the pocket of her jeans and slides it across the table. It's a phone, new-ish but not fancy. John stares at it.
“Is this.. Mycroft Holmes?” John asks, dumbly, before reminding himself that he is supposed to be
"Welcome home."
"Good. Great."
“Yes. I’m in his friend.” The answer comes before he can even consider it. Of course he will still talk to Sherlock, he doesn't have much choice in the matter. His heart, it seems, has taken the lead.
Sherlock eyes him suspiciously, but then shrugs. "Alright. I'll go get changed."
“I see.” Mycroft's tone adds 'and I do not care'.
, “you begin seeing a therapist, which can continue after you leave us here. But, John, the stress on your body is manifestly very real, and continuing on to limp without a motor aid like your cane is damaging your hip and heel. If you keep going like this, you’re likely to cause real, permanent, incurable damage to your leg, and then you really will have a reason to no longer practice.”
talking to him, had been so different then he'd expected. Sherlock's voice was... and his face... and the way he-- it was all too much to think about.
“What?”
“hello,” it's a female voice.
Sherlock looks down at him from his tilted nose,
“Very well.”
if John was to move back to Baker Street, that would mean Rosie would be, too. Despite how accomodating Sherlock had been, it’s one thing to have a visiting baby and another to have a live-in baby. She would have to have a room, would have to have all of her baby products stored in the bathroom. She'd use a high chair in the kitchen and Sherlock would have to let her sleep during the night.
"Is that everything, then?" Sherlocks asks, "because I'd like to kiss you more."
He decides to knock on the door anyway, just in case. He hears footsteps and his heart momentarily soars, body steeling for the moment he lays eyes on Sherlock again, but when the door swings open it isn't Sherlock at all, but an older lady, her hair brown and grey in equal parts and curling around atop her head. She is wearing a flowered apron which has a suspicious red stain on it.
“What?”
John's brain unhelpfully supplies. He counts with the footsteps, one, two, three. A voice mixes with the footsteps at the fourteenth, and Sherlock's familiar baritone floats into the kitchen,
I am a huge believer in the 'John and James had a thing in the army' headcanon but again, it doesn't quite fit so I left it for a better story.
"Well, John, and yourself?" it's an automatic response but John lets its slide.
brilliant. That is not what most people say. Was this a mistake? Please confirm.
"Keep fighting," John promises. "Because I am more than just my job. I have value outside of what I can give others."
“I know.”
“So what did he look like?" John, trying to avoid this conversation, turns to his duffle and rifles through, pretending to try to find his sleep shirt. "John, you tit. Stop messing about with your bag, come, sit down.”
About five hours, I think.

and it’s such an echo of something Sherlock said months ago, having a very similar conversation, that it makes John’s whole body jolt like it’s been hit by electricity. He realises he hadn’t thought of Sherlock all day. Even when he’d sat down across from his doctor and saw the deep bags under her eyes (tired) and the way her shoes were basically strangling her feet (don’t fit anymore, because she ate a lot during the Christmas break), it had been his own plain voice telling him these things. He had not thought of Sherlock once. He’s unsure if he’s happy about it, about getting some space from the near-constant ache of missing and worrying for Sherlock, or scared; because what does this mean? Does it mean he’s moving on? Will he, in a months time, two, forget about Sherlock completely (his curls, his lips, his blue-green-grey eyes, his impossibly wonderful brain) and as a result lose, frankly, the one thing that has been keeping him going for the past three months?
John is stuck on what to do. Cry? Call Mycroft to scream at him? Bury himself in a mound of pillows and sheets and sleep for eons? He had spent the last two months foolishly,
“… depends on the question.”
"I have someone to talk to if I need to," Sherlock promises, "I'll be fine, John."
she’d said, but Sherlock had told John he wasn’t ‘everyone’, that he wasn’t just anybody.

“I do not,” the Doctor gives him a little smile, as if John answered the question anyway. “I’m merely asking a question. Your limp is psychosomatic, yes, and must be dealt with accordingly, which is why I’m going to

It's a month later when it happens, and it's inevitable, really, and if John had been thinking like a doctor instead of
Sherlock goes quiet again, and John allows himself a few moments to calm.
"Then what is this about?"
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock scowled, his voice hard and brittle, “I did not ask you to be here, I did not ask for your help. In fact, I haven’t—“ Sherlock cuts himself off, looking down at his hands.
Another thing that's different: John ardently
He will ask Sherlock, and he'll accept whatever Sherlock was able to give. He just can't keep it in anymore.
"You've been drinking again?" Harry nods, defeated, which is unlike her. "Cheating?" At the accusation, Harry slumps even harder, which is all the clarification John needs. "I can't believe you, Harry. I can't fucking believe you. She-- it-- that was the
“I’ve been doing those stupid letters you forced me into!”
"No!" Sherlock says, almost panicked, "of course not, John, no, I love you. I didn't say it but I love you. I do. He's lying."
“Sherlock!” Bless this man, but he has no social skills. John tries not to let it sting as much as it does. He sees Sherlock shift in his seat and look away from the camera. Sherlock pulls at a thread on his cotton pyjama pants, which seems so out of character for him and his normally immaculate clothes. John closes his eyes, breathes in and out once, twice, three times before he opens them again. Sherlock hates it when John shouts. “Look I’m sorry. Jesus, that can just be a sensitive topic, sometimes. Okay? For me and other people. We don’t like being reminded of all of our failed relationships, you understand?”
"I want you and Rosie to move back in," Sherlock says slowly, "and Rosie can have your room. I want you to sleep in my bed. With me" he clarifies. "I want... that, too." He takes a deep, fortifying breath, "I love you, too, John. Since the beginning."

"Oh, we should get inside. Come on," Mrs Hudson fusses with the lock for a moment, unlocking the door and pushing inside like she owned the place, which she actually did. For John it is not so easy. This is
"Yes, I do. I definitely do."

There's tinsel thrown everywhere and its shedding onto the short carpet, sticking to his socks and tickling his neck where it falls into his collar. He sheds his clothes at the end of every night and with it comes glitter and shiny plastic. Jingle Bells Rock has played for the third time in an hour and he wants to find and
John finished his paperwork an hour ago, and instead he's just watching Sherlock. The younger man is reading a book, his long index finger stroking the frayed edges of the pages, and with every stroke John feels a shiver down his spine. He's trying
John perks up a little at that. “Yeah? I’ll fall asleep at my desk.”
Sherlock, you CANNOT blackmail orderlies to give you banned products!
“What? Like asexual?”
He'd exhausted all of his options regarding contacting Sherlock, at least for now. He's spent the last week throwing himself bodily into physiotherapy. The sooner he's fit to leave, the sooner his body stops betraying him with the pain and disease and uselessness, the sooner he can stand on his own two feet, return to the familiar dreariness of London.
The Doctor nods encouragingly, like John is a child correctly learning how to read. He clenches his fists by his side, refusing to acknowledge how his left hand still shakes unconsciously; just one of the many reasons why John has been brutalising himself in physio, trying to reign his body back into submission. He’s a doctor, he’s well aware of how injury and illness can affect the body, but the more he exists in this place the more it feels like his identity as a doctor is being shredded away, sloughed off by condescending questions and hidden medical notes which invalidate his intelligence as a doctor and leaving him more and more a patient: desperate and willing to do

his housekeeper. He eats my food and barely says thank you and he's up all hours of the night stomping around or muttering to himself or playing awfully on that poor, precious violin. But I'd much rather have Sherlock here and in a strop than anywhere else, you understand? If he's here I can look after him. And if I look after him I get good moments, like the wonderful songs he plays me, or the quiet 'thank you's he whispers when he thinks I can't hear him, or the few times he'd forced me onto the couch to watch something with him, simply because he was lonely and liked my company. That boy is-- I never had any children of my own, a bit of trouble with my husband, understand -- and that boy is closest and the best thing I have ever had to a proper family. Once, someone had busted in here, trying to do something awful, someone Sherlock was trying to arrest, and he stood right in front of me and wouldn't let that bad man get anywhere near me, even when it got him sent to the hospital bleeding all over the carpet. He's bitter, John, and grumpy and rude and impatient, but he deserves love. He certainly deserves more than being ignored and left behind!" To puncture her words, Mrs Hudson swats at his chest again. John grins self-consciously at her, looking into his tea as if it could give him all the answers.
taking Mycroft bloody Holmes' word; that Sherlock was safe, he was happy and he was aware of John. John had believed that somewhere along the way Sherlock had made the choice not to continue the tet-a-tet between them and John had made himself okay with it. He'd still hoped to see Sherlock, just once, just to say hello and to

“I’m not. I’m not angry with you.”
"Doctor Watson. This is getting tedious. You just got back from an active warzone, severely injured, adjusting to new life. Sherlock is of no concern of yours, and you none of his. Settle into civilian life, John, focus on getting a job, a wife, have some nice kids and a house in the suburbs. That is what you're made for. Good evening, John Watson."
and bored. How many times had Sherlock emailed John just those words 'BORED'. It's probably brain-killing for someone as brilliant as Sherlock.

In actual fact, John would love to watch Sherlock dress, watch as miles of beautiful alabaster skin are covered by the luxurious fabric Sherlock wears, and imagine getting to see it in reverse, stripping off his clothes delicately, pressing kisses to every exposed inch,
“I’m quite alright, John.”
Rosie is asleep on the couch for an afternoon nap and Sherlock and John are sitting at the dining table having a cuppa when John finally manifests the courage to talk to Sherlock.
God, he can’t believe it’s been that long since the first day he’d met Sherlock. The phrase ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’, etched out in a deep baritone, is seared into his brain. The moments when life gets too big, too long and too hard, he thinks of that simple question which changed his life as proof that things can always change for the better.
"I don't have a girlfriend or plans" and it's
“He’s not a murderer!” John grouches. “I wanted to see you,” John admits, “and now I’m extra glad I came. What was that?”
"It is lunch time, isn't it?" Sherlock says, already storming out of the kitchen.
to finish these reports, Sherlock. I have a surprising lack of dying soldiers on my table this weekend—for now and this is the only time I'll get.”
The smile doesn't leave him until the next day when he logs back on to his account to only one email.
John,
Sherlock had changed his life is more ways than one; he’d given him hope for his life, a home for a few years, a best friend and a godfather for his daughter. He’d given him less lovely things, too: two years of debilitating grief, truths about his wife (though he’s unsure if he’s happy about that knowledge or not), a bit more danger than his ageing heart might be able to handle and piles and piles of regret.
“I doubt there’s any broken bones,” she says, prodding it lightly. “But it’ll definitely swell, and you’ve got some lacerations there. I’ll have to get a kit, sit at your desk.” Wordlessly, John sits at his desk, holding his injured hand limply at the wrist.
“It ruins my brain! I can’t focus, I can’t think—”

“At home. The neighbour is watching her.”
“Thank you. Hello? Hel—oh, alright. Goodbye to you too, you pompous bastard.” He hangs up the wired phone aggressively and turns around.
"Okay." John says, then leans in for another kiss. He turns, but Sherlock stops him with a hand on his elbow. Every touch is sending electrical currents through his blood and he feels like he's humming with joy. They have a lot to do, a lot to make up for, but for this moment, for today, they can just be happy together.
Would Sherlock even want John anymore, like this? Did he ever want John at all, is perhaps the more pertinent question. They'd never discussed it, any of it, it had just seemed... inevitable. Like two shooting stars whose crash landing would meet on the same patch of Earth. John is crashing and burning, and Sherlock is not here to meet him.
. Indeed, he’s a very interesting man.”
Now, he stood before the front door, looking up at the living room light which was dark except for the faint flicker of what John assumes is a fire. It must’ve been Mrs Hudson, for John had not seen Sherlock light the fireplace at 221B in the entire five years they’d known each other.
“Okay… when has… since when has that been happening? You were

His eyes again, scanning. Then Sherlock nods, flipping the book open but not looking away. “… alright.”
"No, it's not. I refuse to believe that." Sherlock only shrugs, and John takes it as his opportunity to continue. "When I first got a few things back from Afghanistan, I had the diary which I'd written Mycroft's number in. I called him, partly to give him a piece of my mind and partly to ask him to help me contact you. When I finally got through to him, he..." this is the part where it gets difficult. "He told me, he
Sherlock's eyes return to the book, but he doesn't read it. John recognises it as a shield, and John feels a flush of affection for Sherlock, who doesn't balk from John confronting him about his drug addiction, but does when talking about
"No, no, you stupid git," John says, wincing when Sherlock blanches.
Sherlock nods, "it won't happen again." Then after a moment's hesitation, "you-- you still want this," he gestures between them, "even after what Mycroft said?"
“Because someone found you.” He points out.
“No,”
“No, not really." Sherlock concedes with a crooked smile, "But you have time, you can have tonight.”
Five minutes.  Heroin. And before you ask, no, it wasn’t on purpose
But now John has learned that once again, Sherlock had been coddled, manhandled and manipulated. He'd gone on thinking, Mycroft had let him, go on thinking that John was still in Afghanistan and ignoring him. It lit a fury unlike anything John had ever felt in his ribcage, where his heart should be, but he douses it. He cools the bitter heat in his veins.
Sherlock lifts his face to look at him, and his blue-grey-blue eyes are shining with tears, red rimmed and wide as he takes John in. “I’m not asleep?”
of it. The ache he had been feeling for six months has been abating with every familiar quirk of Sherlock he can see in the writing. The blasé way he presented information, like he wasn't being exceptional in knowing or understanding the thing he was writing about. The sour way he talks about humanity, as if he were above it all, contrasted wonderfully by the rapt attention and care Sherlock took to
His doctor’s brain races with thoughts; identifying the jagged slices of serrated knives, the clean splice of whip marks, gnarled puckers of bullets or the tips of sharp knives. The scars are years old (both a blessing; Sherlock is not hurting, he’s not in anger danger, and a curse; when did this happen? Why did I not know?) but no less awful to see. He can tell which wounds healed cleanly and which ones would’ve festered and weeped. He can see where old wounds re-opened and traumatised skin. It’s a story, one John isn’t sure he’s strong enough to hear.

“Of course, John. You and Watson are always welcome.”
Despite my eye for detail and knowledge, you are the one with the practical experience, and I find it helpful to delegate tasks where possible. It is not easy when everyone around me is so moronic, but I trust your medical opinion.
“Don’t say it like that!”
He hadn't googled Sherlock when he first got in contact with him, it had felt a bit stalkerish, and by the time they'd breached that level of familiarity, he hadn't needed to. He felt like he knew everything he had to know about Sherlock. Now, he gives himself the pleasure of a new aspect of Sherlock: the purely and dangerously analytical side of him. He forces his eyes away from the photo to check the website, smiling at how short and blunt the 'about me' section is, and the even more blunt and bitter blurb section which warned off anyone 'boring or completely stupid'. It was so Sherlock, the first taste of him he'd had in months, that he almost starts crying right then and there. He doesn't though, he navigates the website to find the 'blog' section, which housed over 60 blogs.
“You have a favourite?” That piques John's interest for real, and he lifts his heavy head, intending to listen properly. It feels like a big deal for Sherlock, an even bigger deal than it might be for others. Sherlock 'sentiment is a defect found in the losing side' Holmes has a

his brain thinks again, for a singular moment of clarity, then thoughts and words and prayers of thanks and confessions of love all pile on top of one another and John is speechless. "John" Sherlock says eventually, voice perfectly neutral. He walks into the kitchen and John can tell he takes extra care not to touch him as he heads for the kettle, and it takes everything in John not to jump him right now, to hold him to his chest and smell him, absorb him entirely.
“I promise, to fight. If you promise not to do drugs anymore.” Sherlock's smile is
“You don’t need to apologise. If anyone it should be. All I did— God, I’m sorry. For all of it, I’m so sorry.” It’s the best he can do right now, but Sherlock accepts it, squeezing his hand once before pulling away. All of the vulnerability, the softness, is suddenly gone and Sherlock stands.
“Thanks.”
“The phone, Mycroft.
John drops his pen, allowing himself to fully sink into the question. Is what Sherlock said right? Is he okay with dying? The thought brings acid to his throat. He rubs a hand over his forehead, then replies, “It’s not like I want someone to kill me, or that I’d put myself in the line of fire on purpose, recklessly. It’s just… if someone is pointing a gun at me, or flying a bomb over my head, I’d want them to—finish the job. I don’t think I could stand what it would do if it
and broke both their hearts, the absolute—when a big yellow envelop catches his eye, a stamp of the UK’s military insignia on the front. He tears into it and finds a stack of white envelopes and another perfunctory letter with the same insignia stamped on the bottom. He reads it quickly, tossing it aside on his desk before flicking through the envelopes, counting five letters with
"Sherlock, I have to talk to you about something." Sherlock's eyes rove over John's face before he nods. John takes a deep breath, "Can I-- I mean, Rosie and I, can we come back to Baker Street? Permanently." At Sherlock's shocked expression, John continues, "I know it's a lot to ask, but last night I realised--"
Sherlock thinks, feeling the eyes of whatever reception lady staring at him. It's his first time asking to use to phone and he and the receptionist didn't always get along. Finally, the phone stops ringing:
“Alright.” Sherlock gives John a little, sincere smile, and John smiles back, returning to his paperwork.
"You," John says before he can lose his courage, "it's about you."
He's rabid with pain and impatience and stinging despondency. His life has transformed into something twisted and gnarled in less than four months and it's basically unrecognisable at this point, barely more than a relic of the kind of man John had been before, disturbing and wretched like a serial killers trophy.
"Your things have been returned to you, I'm sure you're very glad. is there a more ...  particular reason you are calling?"
John smiles, pressing a quick kiss to Sherlock's palm, over the gauze. "Good."
Harry scruffs his hair like they hadn't just had a row in a public room and says, "I'm glad you're alive, little brother." Then she turns and walks away.
"No, I didn't." Her voice is hollow and John has nothing to say to her. After a few moments of silence, Harry struggles to her feet, swaying slightly, and John wonders if she drove here. He wonders if she's drunk.
“My my, you’re loyal very fast.”
"I'm not the one who needs to hear that, John. I've heard enough. I forgive you," her eyes glittered with mischief and John found himself really liking this strange landlady. If, and that's
"I thought last night would make you want to stay away." Sherlock interjects. His hands are around the cup, but John thinks he can see them shaking a bit. "This isn't the kind of environment for a child, John."
“I fail…” John can hear the frown in his voice.
John had read about mania during one of his courses at uni. Most common, and severe, in bi-polar disorder, but present in many other disorders like depression, anxiety; manic episodes are periods of either complete euphoria, grandiose sense of self and life, hope and peace and feeling indestructible, and then complete despair, hopelessness, paralysing anguish all of which often manifests into depressive episodes and-- in extreme cases-- physical pain. There's medication to balance the chemicals in the brain and try to lessen the extreme highs and lows, but otherwise it just becomes a normal and accepted part of life. Something you rock with like the waves of a merciless and loving sea.
“Okay… do you want to put clothes on now?” John isn't sure what he wants the answer to be.
"You're always drunk, and you always make a mistake, Harriet Watson, always." Using her full name is weird but feels oddly fitting. There's no running away from what she is, a Watson. Even though she's his big sister, he's always had to look after her, manage her and tell her when she's in the wrong. Tough love is the only kind of love that exists between them when Harry has been drinking. "And now you're letting Clara get away without what, even trying?"
"John?"
Harry shows up, which is unexpected and sort of unwanted. There's something so twisted about his alcoholic sister showing up at a rehabilitation centre as a

“Alright…”
But he'd only stood there, shirt off and his mouth pressed into a thin line, vitriol clogging his throat and coating his lungs. He took the cane offered to him but didn't use it as he made his way back to his room.
Harry looks tired, her eyeballs deep and dark and her face puffy from excess alcohol, and John can't help the self-pitying
“Lunch? No. I don’t—I’m not hungry.”

"How did you-- oh, nevermind. I don't want to bloody know. Look,  I'm an adult, a grown-up adult. And so is Sherlock, he is more than capable of making decisions for himself. In fact, haven't we had this conversation before? I'm getting some serious de ja vu."
He’s not even completely sure what he’s doing here. It’s close to one in the morning and John had left Rosie in her crib, knocking on his neighbour’s door to ask them to keep an eye out for her (the neighbour is an older man who John had run into a few times out the front of their respective front doors; they’d chatted a bit but weren’t exactly good friends. However, he was the only one John could think of that was awake that he could ask. He tried not to feel like a totally awful father leaving Rosie with a near-stranger, but he’d told himself it was only going to be an hour, maybe less.) so he could visit Sherlock. He hadn’t seen the detective since last Wednesday, when they’d stopped by after work to eat dinner with he and Mrs Hudson. No doubt Sherlock would call John to his side sometime in the next week, under the guise of a case or something else, but, well… he hadn’t actually been doing much of that lately, and John missed him. God, but he missed the man desperately.

and that meant he should've been better by now. No
” John is referencing Sherlock's hyperbole, which Sherlock uses a surprising amount of, considering how rational he is, how little he cares for 'sentiment, John. It's ghastly and troublesome'
John? You’ll keep your promise, too, won’t you?
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says after another moment, “I didn’t want you to see me like this.” It’s an echo of what he’d said before, but this time it was defeated, apologetic..
“He is not in a nut house, Adam, he’s in a rehab facility.”
his mind supplies helpfully,
“Well that’s good, isn’t it?”
“What is it, John?”
and you're an addict and--" Sherlock twists his face and catches the edge of John's mouth with his lips, barely a kiss, but its message is clear: shut up.
“What, you're trying to tell me you’ve never picked up, Three-Continents-Watson?” John scoffs at the nickname.
"A sexuality crisis?" John offers, "I've never felt the way I feel about you, about another bloke. About anyone, actually. I'm
"Just keep it for when you get out. Better than having to buy one."
"So no?" Before John could reply, Mycroft sighs long-suffering, "I hate to be the one to tell you this, John," he continues, not sounding at all bothered to be telling John this, "but Sherlock is not like ordinary people."
He only held the surprise for a few moments before it flitted away, replaced by the image of Sherlock here, in his shower, long talented fingers wrapped around him and stroking him with gentle firmness, thumb rubbing over the glans and slit to pick up the weeping and use it to add to the sweet slipperiness of his hand. He wanted to grip his sac, rub them around in his hands and pretend it was Sherlock instead, but if he didn't have his hand bracing the wall he would not be able to stay upright, so instead, he only tightened his grip, turning back inwards to imagine Sherlock. In his imagination, Sherlock slides slowly to his knees (another thing he did not expect, Sherlock is constantly surprising) and the tight slick of his hand is replaced by the hot heat of his mouth, his skilful tongue tracing sensual patterns over the skin while he takes John deeper. Is it weird to imagine someone giving you a blowjob when you hadn't even kissed them? To feel it so
"Hello," she says cheerily, "how can I help you?"
He feels the comforting sting of alcohol solution cleaning out his shoulder, the press of a cold flannel over his feverish skin. He manages to tell whoever is hovering above him to leave whatever is left in the hole, the alcohol and further maintenance should take care of it; bullet out, saline flush, alcohol sterilisation, stitch it. STITCH IT.
"I was... shot. In the shoulder." He gestures at his shoulder where, under his t-shirt, is a starburst of puckered skin and gnarled scarring. "I was... in a bad way, had to stay in the field hospital for a month fighting infection, they couldn't move me, it was too risky." He swallowed around a sudden knot in his throat, "when I eventually got back on UK soil, I spent six months in a hospital getting function in my arm back. I tried to contact him, Mrs Hudson, I did. I sent emails and letters but they either bounced back or, I think, got intercepted. Mycroft... he told me to stay away."
If I need a medical opinion again, can I come to you?
“What is it, Sherlock? What are you going to do,
“That doesn’t answer the question.”
“Alright.”
Dark black curls bounce as Sherlock looks up from his phone, and a quick flick of something like surprise flits over his face before Sherlock takes a step back, pulling his body out of John’s steadying hands (hah, as if John could be any kind of support to anyone right now. His body can barely hold himself up, let alone anyone else). John drops his hands as Sherlock said,

I am not wrong, John. She stashes bags of powder in the hollow of the frame, and he just has to crack it open to get them. I imagine she can fit almost 20 bags in there, separating them in even spaces so the frame weighs the same all around. It’s clever, John, very clever.
She doesn't care about his sodding limp, or his sand-weathered skin, or any of the other things that have made his love life basically impossible (except for the one thing... the thing he won't talk about, not now... not after this long).
John laughs again, gentler, easy. "Yes please."

in the pressure that pulls through his shoulder, like a bullet in slow motion.
There have been many points in John's life when someone has told him he should go to therapy. School counsellors, Mike Samford, Harry during a few bitter fights. He'd ignored it every other time, until now. At Seacole, he'd made a decision, and he decided he would see it through, no matter how much he hated it.

exist, and John could never truly regret her; he just regretted the way it had all happened, what it all meant for Sherlock and him.
He's made himself three cups of tea and is currently letting another go cold in his hands by the time the sound of the front door clicking open and closed pierces the quiet of the flat. He's just been sitting here, waiting and waiting, which he'd had to do a lot before as a soldier but is somehow worse in this flat than the deserts of Afghanistan. The dichotomy of terror and joy at knowing Sherlock is
Talking to Sherlock,
Basically, she's gorgeous.
As Sherlock reads, John floats in and out of sleep, riding the waves of Sherlock's deliciously low voice. Every so often a passage pricks his ear and he listens, especially when he realises Sherlock is picking through the book to find poems, instead of just reading cover to cover.
John is not surprised he's imagining Sherlock while touching himself. He's unafraid to admit how gorgeous the man is, and has in fact come from thinking about him before, more than once. It was this whole 'trying to balance' thing that flustered him. Here was a perfectly sexy nurse, who had smiled coquettishly at him and bandaged his hand, but instead he's thinking about Sherlock Holmes. The Florence Nightingale Effect has failed him, or at least his imagination.
It's short but sweet because there's still much to talk about and Sherlock seems to understand because he pulls back, albeit reluctantly. His hand, which had been cradling John's head, moves to join his other hand at his waist and is rubbing lazy circles with his thumb on John's hip. It's distracting, and it's heartbreaking because John has to pull away and get up for this next bit. "Sherlock, there's a bit more I have to tell you." Sherlock immediately freezes and John takes the opportunity to press a soft kiss to the top of his head, before sliding off Sherlock and settling back in his seat. He holds out his hands and Sherlock hesitantly lays his hands in them, intertwining their fingers. "It's about what has been going on, but it's not about
His back is a latticework of shining scar tissue. Some of them are lifted, standing out like mountain ranges on his skin, some are deep and rounded like John’s own bullet scar. Some are silver, not raised like others but no less vicious in the moonlight. John can also spot burn marks, melted skin like from cigarettes.
Despite Sherlock's insinuation that higher ranking officials get private quarters, John's Captain status (as well as head surgeon) only provides him a small, private office and a less crowded sleeping quarters. There's four bedrolls on collapsable cots in this part of the camp, and his sits against the far wall, rarely used and methodically tucked every day, even if he hasn't slept in it. How many nights had he fallen asleep at his desk, instead of in his bed? But he'd just gotten off of his first Skype call with Sherlock and... bloody hell. He needed to step away, just to bring his mind back to the present. To where he was. Afghanistan. Sand. Dirt. Sun. Blood.

He sits at a table in the rec room with Harry and tries not to feel like he's in the visiting room of a prison, metaphorical handcuffs materialised in the form of gauze and bandages and medical tape that still hold his hand and shoulder hostage.
“It’s not like I’d sleep any sounder in my bed.” John grumbles.
Baker Street is oddly quiet, no sound of a violin, no faint tinkering of an experiment, and John wonders if Sherlock is asleep, It’s worryingly rare but not impossible. Sherlock had been texting John incessantly late at night the last three days, but not anything about a case. John should’ve texted before he decided to just show up, it

“We’re worried about you, Sherlock.” John says, pushing the frustration down. Maybe sentiment and friendship is new and unfamiliar to Sherlock, but that doesn’t make it any less necessary, or pertinent. “You were obviously distraught.

my best friend. That first month in the hospital, I was still really sick. Body wrecked from trying to heal myself, readjusting to sleeping on a real mattress," he cracks a smile but Sherlock doesn't return it, he just watches John intently, the mug back over his lips, just hovering there. "But I just lay there, thinking about how I finally got to be back home, and you were somewhere out there, but I couldn't go and find you. I had to go and get myself shot," at his words Sherlock's eyes widened, "
when he says, "John Watson, I'm not--" Mrs Hudson turns around so fast her hand slaps him square in the chest. It's not aggressive and was obviously on accident, but Mrs Hudson's face goes through emotions so fast he can't keep up.

I was feverish with infection and dying when you sent me the first one, then off base as they kept coming. I don't know why but it took the BAF until today to send them to me, and I-- read them. I hadn't known... all that stuff, Sherlock." At the mention of the letters Sherlock curls in on himself, making him look smaller than John ever could imagine him. John shakes his head wearily, aware how delicate all of this was. He gets up slowly, moving to sit in the seat beside Sherlock and shifting closer. Sherlock lets him come, and John places a hand on one of Sherlock's bony knees, which are drawn up to his chest. "You don't need to be frightened," he says softly, "Sherlock, I want-- all of that that you said in your letter. I want to look out the window with you, and listen to you play violin for hours, and I will even deal with cleaning up all of your experiments when you leave them laying around, and I'll be a shit back when you're being rude, and I'll remind you to slow down when you're not looking after yourself and I'll do--

it is your leg which has developed this psychological response to your trauma? What, perhaps, you’re trying to prove to yourself, or punish yourself with, by having to use a cane and having a limp?” John doesn’t have an answer, so he doesn’t speak. The Doctor continues after a moment. “Perhaps, your extensive knowledge of trauma injury has made you aware that one day your shoulder will heal, and when it does, you have no excuse as to why you cannot go on being a doctor and a constructive member of society. If you have an incurable, debilitating limp, perhaps you never have to go back to being those things?”

Before John can say any more, Sherlock is pulling his arm out of John’s grip and stalking down the street, his long coat flapping noisily in the wind. There is a lot to unpack in that lightning-quick interaction, least of which is the ache John felt at having the man so close and then gone again so soon.
hard for seemingly no reason, but he takes it as a blessing. He hasn't gotten hard since.. well since Afghanistan, really, and he didn't realise how much release he needed until this very moment.
The only thing that breaks up the monotony is jerking off and that's such a disturbing thought that it puts him off for a bit, but only until he's scrolling through the photos app on the phone Harry gave him (he'd taken it down to the computer and tried to inconspicuously take photos of the photos he found of Sherlock on Google) and inching his hand closer and closer to his prick which is doing it's best attempt at getting hard. He'd taken a photo of the one Sherlock had on his website, which was almost so sinful John wondered if Sherlock

, but he had been, once, and he wants to hold onto the dignity of that for as long as he could.
"She's fine. I'm just not very receptive to psychotherapy." Sherlock nods like this is a clever way to be. "And neither are you, but-- Sherlock, would you consider-"
"Oh, uhm okay. Are you sure? I can wait--"
The person moves on and John is left alone to watch the clouds and the rising sun. Something is niggling in the back of his brain, something that only connects when a minivan drops him and three other soldiers off at an ugly brown building signed 'Seacole Rehabilitation Centre' and he's being ushered into a boring white room and shut alone in a quiet room before he can even ask;
“Is this,” John says, shoving his tremoring hand before them, “not a ‘real reason’ enough already? I can’t perform surgeries like this. I can’t suture or perform internal exams. That’s what I went to school for! That’s why I chose to go overseas! If I can’t do all of that, then I’m basically not a bloody doctor! I’m basically nothing!”
Mrs Hudson.
"Me too," Sherlock says in a small voice and John can't help but smile.
“Not the dead body at the end?”
“Good night John.”
He’s angry, he’s
“Why are you okay with dying, then.”
“I didn’t want to put on clothes.”
“You’re the one in an active war zone John!" Sherlock shouts, throwing his hands in the air.
"Good," he says, "god, great, Sherlock. That's amazing. We'll... we'll have to move some stuff, sell some of the stuff from the flat, and god, get rid of the whole flat, but that's okay. I'll sort it out. Could we-- could we stay here, tonight?"
“Okay.” Likely Sherlock will just wake him when he falls asleep and send him off to bed, and John is okay with this.
He refuses to believe in it, despite his insecurities and mounting worries. He's learnt a bit from Sherlock, learnt to seek data and evidence to come to a likely conclusion. There is no evidence Sherlock feels this way, in fact, almost all of the evidence is to the contrary: Mycroft is intercepting them, why if not because Sherlock wouldn't abide by his agenda? What need would he have to get involved if Sherlock would carry out his will anyway?
“Have you considered, Doctor Watson,

Yes, I've been working and living in London for about two months, but I was in a hospital six months before that, doing physical therapy and the like for my injury." Sherlock nods, the cup covering his mouth in a faux-sip.

hasn't thought about this, at all. Less than an hour ago Sherlock had been leaving his flat, who knew how long until he would come back?
“I’m alive, aren’t I?” Sherlock opens his palm to the ceiling, like offering himself as proof. John takes a second to rove his eyes over Sherlock's being, his heart pulling at the thought of him, his brilliant brain, his beautiful heart, unbeating and unthinking.
“You promise to fight.”
John. It feels like drowning." The anguish is sudden and sobering and John pulls his eyes open, watching Sherlock pull at his hair, agitated. "There’s always so much light, and sound, and feeling. It would be easier if I didn’t feel at all.”
He goes for cold hard facts. “He looks young, but he’s only a few years younger than me. These… blue-green-grey eyes, he’s…”

Eventually I found your website, I read all your blogs by the way, they're very interesting," he feels a small thrill of pleasure at the light that flicks on in Sherlock's eyes, "and I tried to email you on that email too," he saw the question in Sherlock's eyes but he shook his head

that he's not letting Sherlock's inherent defences balk him. "I'm here because I want to talk to you, Sherlock. Because there's been a big misunderstanding and I need to clear it up. I got your letters and--"
The result is instant and unexpected. One moment they're sitting together, hand in hand, as the sun goes down behind the skyline, the next moment Sherlock is on his feet, and there's hot tea dripping from the walls and a shattered mug spread out like shrapnel along the table and floor. There's a piece sticking out of the side of Sherlock's palm like he'd followed the mug all the way to impact and he's swearing, holding his hand as beads of blood collect around it. John had stoop up in the moment and now he waits, giving Sherlock's breathing a few moments to settle before he slowly reaches out, tugging Sherlock back to sitting and kneeling to examine his hand.

and Harry's immediate departure. John didn't blame her, not really, and now he sort of wished he'd gone with her. But he'd have to leave his mum to do that and he just couldn't.
“Please, just… just talk to him about it?" Someone behind him knocks on the door, which in a tent is just making knocking sounds with their tongue and hovering awkwardly in the doorway. "Look, I have to go. I’m in a
John snorts, "obviously."
John stares and stares and stares, until the shaking of Sherlock’s shoulders register. He’s shuddering, great heaving shakes that are usually accompanied by sobs, but the man is quiet. John tears his eyes away from the mutilation on his back and steps in, closing the door and plunging them into even more darkness.
Would the British army pay for John to spend 6 months in an in-patient rehab facility? No. but in this fic, yes, for one very specific reason which will be clear to you shortly.
“I’m here,” John is moving before he knows it, walking over to where Sherlock is slumped and places a gentle hand on his shoulder. “I’m here, you’re safe, you were having nightmares.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but his crooked smile widens into a genuine one, like John caring for him pleases him.
“D- do you?”
John's eyes are closed and his response is barely audible. “Almost.”
"He's not been well, John" Mrs Hudson says, like she could read his mind. Maybe she could, do it like Sherlock at least. Could you develop his skill through osmosis? John really would like to find out. "Even with he's high, or when he's without it, he's making an awful racket on his violin, awful screeching. He stomps around so loud I can hear it downstairs and he makes an absolute mess of the kitchen. But since he's gotten back, he's been... different. Subdued, like something had been eating away at him and he didn't have enough of himself left to live. He's barely left his lat, only just went back to work today." John squeezes his eyes shut, trying to find comfort in the cup of tea in his hand even as guilt roils in his gut,
I have no control over how long I am staying here. A cigarette would’ve made things bearable. I could’ve threatened him with something else, something truly personal.

“But am I first person you’ll promise to?”
“Not much." He tries, "I mean, it was kind of awkward you know? Or a bad link. When it connected, he was just frozen for a couple seconds, not eve blinking or anything. When he started moving again he kind of stumbled over his words a bit but we got through it." He remembered the spots of blush on Sherlock's sharp cheekbones and tried not to blush himself. "We just… talked.”
"You had enough of that in your childhood," Sherlock concludes, and the admission of John's childhood abuse is so blasé that John blanches. Sherlock sweeps his eyes over John again, "and I shouldn't have said that," he adds, softer.
"She doesn't want me to try," Harry says, fight leeching out of her quicker than John has ever seen it.
"Alright, love, I know it's frustrating. Let me have a look at this before you hurt yourself more." The piece of ceramic is not small, but it likely had done no damage except pierce the skin. He'll have to pull it out and make sure no smaller shards were left in, and pulling it out would make it bleed more, but he would be fine, maybe only need a few stitches. "Do you have a first aid kit?" Sherlock tells him where to find the first aid kit and he rifles around in it, making sure to not pay attention to the syringes that were missing from the set, happy, however, to find fresh needles and suture string. Likely leftover from the suture experiment Sherlock did on himself, which still makes John shudder. He returns to the kitchen with the required items, finding Sherlock playing with one of the broken pieces of ceramic with his unhurt hand. John pulls the chair closer so his knee slots in beside Sherlock's and rests his hand on John's thigh, a terrible fill in for a sterile work table, but well enough. He puts on gloves, gives Sherlock a little warning before pulling out the piece of ceramic as swiftly as he can. He cleans it out with saline solution and, happy there are no more pieces of ceramic in there, begins the stitches. He couldn't see any numbing cream in the kit, so he gives Sherlock a quick kiss on the head for fortitude and does the business quickly and cleanly. He wipes away the leftover blood and wraps some gauze around his hand before taping it off with medical tape. Once he's certain he's done a good job, he packs away the bits and washes his hands. He returns to Sherlock, who is still fiddling with a bit of ceramic. He needs to clean up the tea and mug, but he can do that after. "Sherlock, hey, look at me."
There is a small, dying fire in the grate, but the living room is empty and devoid of Sherlock. Sherlock’s bedroom is closed and John pounces on it. Mrs Hudson is following him inside and she says, “He blocks the door, John!” as he tries to push it open. There’s no lock so Sherlock must have put something under the handle. Something
John shakes his head, hurrying to finish as Sherlock's face falls, "you
He scowls harder, “I’ve made extra care for you to not see me.., like this,” one of Sherlock’s hands flutter over his shoulder, and John knows that Sherlock knows that he saw his back. “I don’t sleep when you and Rosie stay over because I don’t need you to fuss. I lock the door because Mrs Hudson is a busybody who thinks she can come and go from my flat whenever she pleases.”
“So it was him, then?”
His hand moves once, slowly, up and down himself, wanting to luxuriate in the feeling of hot flesh on hot flesh, warm water running in rivulets down his chest and the back of his thighs. He braces himself on the shower wall, one hand holding himself up on the tiles, the other moving again over his firm prick. He closes his eyes, assured by the lock he'd remembered to flick closed when he entered. He tries imagining a partner, someone standing in front of him, bracketed between his solid body and the wall. Imagines the gentle caress of water is a tongue, a set of soft, plush lips following his skin down and down. Kisses sprinkled along his cheek, his jaw, latching onto the pulse point on his neck with an affection nip. He imagines their long fingers wrapping around him, giving him free rein to touch their body.
“Yes, right,” John says, thinking of the barricaded door. “Well, I’ll see you tomorrow then?”
He only deliberates for a few minutes before he’s grabbing his phone, the one Harry had given him now with a SIM card and pushing in Mycroft’s number. It rings for a few moments before a familiar female voice says,
John, please. It was months ago and I am fine.
“Not a
and just enjoys the encompassing beauty that is Sherlock. When Sherlock is done, John lets out a little sigh. “What about that one do you like?”
That same rational brain is telling John Sherlock wouldn't want him to be hurting himself like this, but it's
Pay attention to the dates I've put as the chapter titles as they represent time jumps/significant dates etc. I made the assumption that army bases would only get mail delivered once a week, which is why every correspondence received FROM Sherlock is dated on a Friday (because I decided). However because Sherlock is in London and likely to get mail... whenever, his dates are a bit more flexible.
I fell asleep earlier. I set an alarm to be awake for our call.”
The sudden and overwhelming ache of missing Sherlock is so visceral, savage like his anger had been, that he springs out of bed and towards the rec room where the public computer is. He hovers menacingly nearby while another resident is using it (looking up pap pictures of Kim Kardashian, really?) until his incessant sighs and taps drive the other person away. He practically jumps into the seat and straight to Google, typing 'Sherlock Holmes Detective London' into the search bar. He is unsurprised to find quite a large number of results, including the top result which is
Remember your promise, okay?
“Fuck!”
“Just listen until you get sleepy and then go to bed.” Sherlock responds, ever pragmatic.
Also, tell me how quickly you think it would take for her to bleed out: 23-year-old girl, healthy weight, no obvious sign of movement during bleeding.
“He didn’t ask me to do this. I
John wants to scream,
But a little voice in his head, a memory of his last words
When Sherlock looks up, he's frowning. His eyes sweep long, analytical lines over John's face and when he talks again, the softness of the last hour is gone, replaced by his usual cold tone, "you're angry. I shouldn't have done that." John sighs, rubbing a hand over his eyes,
“I’m being honest, John.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't-- I honestly don't know."
“Oh." Sherlock looks down at himself like he wasn't aware. His face looks completely genuine when he shrugs, "yes” like it's a perfectly normal thing to happen and not basically porn come to life.
“Jesus, Adam. It was just a phone call.”
"No," John says emphatically, his free hand clenching and unclenching. "I can't reach him because
“Hmph.” It's a sound Sherlock has made a hundred times when John lied and Sherlock knew but wouldn't fight him on it.
“Where’ve you been?” It's Adam Williams, one of the men he shares his sleeping quarters with. John's brain, constantly switched onto doctor mode, can't help but assess every inch of the man: tired, cold in the desert night, homesick-- but fine. Healthy.
Sherlock goes to sidestep him, but John grabs his elbow, overcome by all the feeling and desperate to delay his departure, just to talk. “Wait.. Sherlock. Are you here for.. lunch?”
“Where the buggering hell did you get that from? I told you, Sherlock, the first letter I ever sent—“
“At the moment, yes.”
"Your left shoulder," he says gravelly, "I wasn't sure exactly before. But I can see it now. It's hunched slightly more forward than the other, like the stress of keeping your posture strains it. It's healed nicely in spite of the infection, but it's likely to still give you twinges of pain for the rest of your life."
“No.”
"Okay. I know all of those things. I've spent the past seven months thinking nothing except... except those things, and how much I love him in spite of-- no, how much I love him for them. He's rude, and impatient, and a know-it-all, but he's..." John closes his eyes, trying not to blush as he finds his words, "he's perfect, is what he bloody is. And I didn't leave him behind, or ignore him, I swear." He opens his eyes, looking imploringly at Mrs Hudson, who'd softened around the eyes. "I was, I don't know how much you know, but I was in Afghanistan..."
leave Rosie with a near-stranger, and Sherlock seems unlikely to offer more of himself tonight, so John steps out and let’s Sherlock dress.
"Your nightmares aren't a problem, Sherlock. She's sleeping through the night, now, far easier. And I have nightmares, too. You've already done so much to accomodate Rosie, and she's happy, here. Last night just made me realise how much I'm missing. I barely go on cases with you anymore, and I don't get to see you every day. And I want to. I didn't even... I didn't know about any of that stuff with Serbia, I didn't know you were having trouble sleeping, more than usual anyway. Mrs Hudson was just sitting outside of your door, listening to you scream. I don't want you to be alone anymore, and I don't want to be alone, either, do you understand?"
"I do,"
They gave him the papers from his desk, including the diary he used to write all of his notes in, the calendar he'd hung on his wall (what use would he have for a 2009 calendar in 2010?) and a pair of socks, which he'd apparently left behind. Curiously, it included the handgun he'd been given during his service, shoved in the socks and at the bottom of the box. He didn't get the computer-- which he realised with embarrassment must still have that screenshot of Sherlock saved on it-- his bedroll, that one specific tin mug he drank from every day. A gun, a pair of socks, a bunch of paper and a dingy little bedsit. That's what John's life was, after 6 years of studying medicine, 5 years in active service and getting shot in the leg; a bunch of knick-knacks, a flat he hates and 400 pounds a week, most of which goes to his rent.
“Jesus, yes.”
“Can you—Sherlock, can you put the book down a minute.” Sherlock sighs, long-suffering, but closes the book, leaving his finger in there to mark the page. His green-blue-grey eyes, which are a nearly midnight blue in the video footage, train on John with so much intensity John can't help but shiver, suddenly regretting asking for Sherlock's attention.
“You said you were scared of getting shot, injured." Sherlock leans forward, that familiar glint he gets when he's deducing shining. "Likely because you know it would invalidate you, permanent damage, might even compromise your work as a doctor. Then you said you don’t want to be a hero, like all the other men who died, but you didn’t want the men to call you a hero, because if you did die, it would be because you stopped fighting, not because you were being brave.”
The line of poetry sounds like Sherlock, too, in John's head, as both clever and interesting thoughts do. John always thought he was smart, a bit brilliant if he was being proud. He had to be, to graduate in the top 6 of his uni's medicine cohort, but he's nothing compared to Sherlock, and his subconscious knows it. Every time John notices something about someone, or remembers a salient fact he must have retained some time long ago, John thinks he couldn't have it now if it wasn't for Sherlock. As such, most of his internal dialogue is in Sherlock's deep, honey-smooth voice. John honestly can't bring himself to mind-- if only Sherlock were actually here beside him.

find each other.
John has been at the rehab facility for just under four weeks, nearly done with the first of the 'suggested' (the BAF will pay for six months, but an injury like this is forever) period at rehab. All of the healing his body should've done since his injury but had instead been fighting to keep his heart beating has begun and his shoulder aches and itches during the day and screams with pain at night. They give him pain medication and it dulls the screaming ache to a background throb for the few hours its in effect, and he takes the sleeping pills at night which plunge him into blessed dreamless sleep. They'll start weaning him off both soon and John isn't sure how he can live without them.
Even though John

“I need a phone.”
then he would've picked up on it sooner. But he's not being a doctor, and so he's honestly surprised when he gets bowled over by an awful, dramatic bout of illness. It's vaguely flu-ish, his immune system so broken down from the months of stasis healing a broken body and John's chronic overworking on his physio. He hasn't been sleeping properly because of his nightmares and the food is still shit and all of it culminates into a week in bed and a very stern talking-to from his doctor. "You can't keep going on like this, John. I know you want to get better, but all you're doing is killing yourself faster, permanently ruining your body. Slow down, be patient and look after yourself."
“Mmmhmm.” The woman on the other end is comically uninterested.
They'd just reached the landing of another door with 221B on the door,
the rotten cherry on top of his whole disaster cake of bodily ruin, is the tremor in his hand. It had started shaking when physical therapy began, and he’s written it off as just a result of the strain, the tiredness. But then it kept shaking, even hours after he’d finished, after he’d taken a muscle relaxer, even in the mornings when he woke up. Every few minutes his hand would shake like a pathetic mockery of jazz hands, slight but enough to cause damage if he were holding a scalpel or a particularly delicate body part.
he is just happy Sherlock is here now, but it came out of the pile of every other question as the easiest to ask. He didn't consider, perhaps, that it would not be the easiest to answer. "I know you are, Sherlock. I believe you. I just-- I'm sorry."
"I was your best friend?" Sherlock cuts in quietly.
John's heart jumps and stutters. This,
He'd slept for nearly a week when he first arrived, despite his blood thrumming and his heart beating and his eyes blinking
healthy. He makes a decision.
"When was the last time you had real food?"
Sherlock is so brilliant but so dense sometimes, with things like this.
"I'm not dating any other women, ever again, because I have no interest in it. I don't want to be with anyone else, because.... Well, to be bloody honest, because I want to be with
"Hey Sherlock, it's John Watson. I'm not going to ask if you remember me because I don't want to undermine your intelligence but also because I know you haven't forgotten me. I haven't forgotten you. I got shot, wounded pretty bad and I'm in a rehab centre in London. Email me back, please. I miss you."
Nothing means so much to me as autistic Sherlock Holmes. The likes of Ty Blackthorn, Temperance Brennan and Maurice Moss bring me unmeasurable joy. Sherlock Holmes is all of the classic caricatures of autism: particular, impatient, intelligent; but he's also more of the unglamorous parts of autism: messy, over-emotional (yes, OVER emotional), hyper-fixated and vulnerable. It's entirely likely that Sherlock is very OOC in this fic, and I find myself uncharacteristically unafraid of it. Sherlock is a multi-faceted, complicated dichotomy of  masking and a strong sense of self.
Sherlock eyes him for a moment, "you've been seeing a therapist. She's not very good." John laughs, a startling sound in the dimness of the room.
And flirting with
"I am yours," Sherlock says forcefully. "Completely."
After he's counted six minutes and forty-two seconds, the phone rings its fake click and the female voice is back, "Doctor Watson?"
re: lacerations
It's embarrassing to be spoken to like a foolish child, and it's embarrassing to realise it's entirely
"Love you? Yes, I do. Of course, I do. I love you, Sherlock." Sherlock releases a noise that sounds somewhere between a squawk and a laugh and then his big hands are cupping the back of John's skull and pulling him forwards and into him. John expects it to be a kiss but Sherlock is wrapping his other arm around his waist and hauling him up and over, deceptively strong, and deposited him in his lap, his riotous curls getting in John's mouth as he buries his face into John's neck. In his surprise, all John can do is wrap his arms around Sherlock and hold him steady. It takes a few shakes of Sherlock's body for John to realise he's crying, and when he does, he cards his fingers gently through Sherlock's hair, tangling his fingers in it and using it to gently tilt Sherlock's head up. Sherlock's eyes are shining when he looks up at John and a few tears are tracing down his cheeks. "Are you okay?" John asks softly.
"No, Sherlock, shut up," John says, because what Sherlock is saying is not beneficial for either of them. "Sit down, shut up." Sherlock's mouth shuts with a heavy 'clack' that makes John worry for his teeth, but he swiftly plops himself back down on his seat.
John settles in his uncomfortable plastic seat, the seat cushion doing little to help his aching backside. He crosses his arms against his desk and leans in closer to the webcam. Sherlock is looking back at him, wary.
"okay, I love you" he says before he can help himself, and Sherlock smiles a dazzling smile, though there's still a bit of fear behind it, and John smiles back encouragingly. Steeling himself, he continues,
John berates himself. He
“I—that is not fair.”
"Okay," John smiles, "good. That's great. Me too, obviously. Hard not to, with how bloody gorgeous you are. But not just intimacy, but daily life stuff. I will not accept drugs in my home, do you understand?"
His affection for the man, unbidden but unavoidable, did not lessen during those months and John did not begrudge the man for their distance. He had considered going to the rehabilitation facility where Sherlock was supposedly a resident after his release, but they could not give him anything now that Sherlock was no longer a resident. He had assumed that when he returned to normal (as normal as a bedsit and a teetering desire for life could be) Sherlock would find him, he was, after all, a clever and dedicated man and when that hadn't happened, he'd finally tried to move on, went on a date with Sarah, vaguely enjoyed it. But not really.

She’s sitting with her back against the door, her legs spread out in front of her. She squeaks out an “Oh!” and puts her hand out to catch John. He stays on his feet and helps Mrs Hudson gets to hers by taking her offered hand and pulling her up.
“Oh, right. Well… are you in any kind of rush? I thought we could—” He should say more, explain more, but he's so overwhelmed by Sherlock's mere presence that it's all he can do to keep Sherlock beside him.
is reminiscent of when he'd picked the scab of his left hand and tore old, rotten flesh from new, healing flesh. But he doesn't let the feeling overwhelm him, he let it come and go, like a gently lapping wave.
That final one is a performance I did many years ago in my youth.

John's eyes closed somewhere along Mycroft's story and John pinches the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger, trying to breath through the flood of images and thoughts and

he pushes the door open to free his hand. It’s not trembling now, but his whole hand is seized up as blood catches along the skin of his knuckles. It’s already bruising and it’s likely to swell.
He wants it all.

She's gone before he can blink and his chest warms with understanding. Not 'welcome back to London,' but 'welcome home'

a girl's name," Sherlock responds, a mischievous smile on his face.
Only when the orderly didn’t share with you! Sherlock, please. It’s dangerous, not just for the kid, for all of the other addicts there recovering. For the orderlies if he has an episode. For YOU. How can you go back to work if you need to stay for longer.
Look, it seems like that place isn’t any better for you then the outside world. I know you’re miserable in there and it’s been nearly four months. Have you thought about leaving? You’d just need to negotiate an assessment beforehand. Or have you tried before?

in a way he couldn't imagine being a week ago, or a year ago or a decade ago. It would be suffocating, all of the feelings, if it wasn't so damn easy. To love Sherlock was as easy as breathing.
An image appears, unbidden, in John's mind: Sherlock and John moving in tandem around the bathroom, Rosie's bath toys and her baby powder scattered around the floor, Sherlock brushing his teeth while John changes and tidies. Sherlock kisses John before they swap. They both go to bed, Sherlock's bedroom
to look at. Besides, John is pretty sure that the force of the feelings he has for Sherlock, and the troubling fact that perhaps he's operating from a place of living for Sherlock, instead of living for himself, is unhealthy and would make the three therapists he'd met so far scribble so ferociously on their pad they'd light a fire. He'd rather shove the terrible choices he'd made and his infatuation with Sherlock into the same box labelled 'bad decisions' and let them rot together.
In the blackness of his vision (are his eyes closed or is he blind from fever?) he sees bouncing curls, tries to tell his arm to reach up and twist his fingers in them, but his fingers only twitch and shoot fire up his muscles. Maybe he screams, maybe it's in his head.
“Yeah of course I did, that’s what Skype is!”
He'd been in London for a few weeks now, and he'd done nearly nothing important or interesting or exciting the whole time. He'd imagined returning to London victorious, a soldier on leave again to return to a brutal and magnificent war. It was all John is good at, the fight.
"John," Sherlock says, and it sounds so similar to the way he'd said John's name last night, broken and scared, that John grabbed for Sherlock's hand, holding one between his two palms.

that John was back in the UK but had somehow failed to mention it to his brother,
"Mrs Hudson invite you in?" Sherlock says, his back turned to him and busy making tea.
“And you believe you will continue this correspondence with my brother?”
“I asked you.”
“You have regular access to the internet, Doctor Watson?” The question is unexpected, considering John figured he was about to be asked to never speak to Sherlock again.
“Goodbye John,” Sherlock says, making towards the kitchen and his dressing gown swishing as he walked, as dramatic as his coat.
Hope you're enjoying!
"And you?"
the humanity he'd just insulted. One blog post, from a few years ago, is entirely about sutures, and John is upset to find out that the photos he'd attached of the different kinds of stitch patterns were performed on himself, by himself, taken out and repeated over a knife wound he'd received in a chase. John couldn't help but think
“Mmm?”
“You’re a doctor, John, and not an idiot. You know perfectly well what ‘that’ was.”
“It’s fine. I… maybe I shouldn’t have asked." There's another lapse of silence. "John?”
This is heavily inspired by the epistolary style of writing, however I did have to concede to write a few fleshed-out scenes, for the sake of the story.
Sherlock is looking back at his hands now, like a scolded child. His voice is strong, however, when he says “you’re willing to die in the war. I’d almost say ‘wanting to’ but it’s not quite like that." Finally, Sherlock looks at him, eyes wide and earnest, like this is something he really wants to pick apart. "You just… don’t care if you do.”
Jesus, Sherlock! Are you allowed to send these over the internet? Isn't it... like police confidentiality? Also, I thought you’d ‘read a textbook’ – shouldn’t you be able to figure these out yourself?
John was back before that moment. Hadn’t known John was injured and invalided back to London until this moment.
“Goodnight.”
Sherlock lets out what can only be described as a groan, "
to Mycroft, get him to understand… John had had the ‘hurt my baby sister and I’ll kill you’ talk before and survived it.
It's the least craziest thing he's done since he was 23 and he feels like he's going
She has brown hair, light with even lighter streaks throughout (not dark, nearly black, shining blue-black in just the right lighting), it's straight but not harsh, just nicely washing over her shoulders (not curly, each strand of thick, dark hair ripe for curling his fingers in), her skin faintly brown like if she spent a few hours in the sun she would tan beautifully (not go red, alabaster skin unused to the harsh sun), her eyes are warm and brown (not blue-green-grey spinning planets of intense heat and curiosity).
"I'm going to talk, for a bit, and you're going to listen, do you understand?" Sherlock nods once and John nods back, satisfied. He wraps his hands around his own cup even though it's gone cold, but forces himself to keep his eyes on Sherlock as he talks. "That first month after I got... shot, I was basically delirious with fever. My few moments of lucidity were spent telling some other guy how to look after me, but when I was.. asleep, or, whatever you call it. I just kept seeing these... images, black curls and blue-grey-green-impossible eyes. I didn't know what my brain was telling me until I landed in the UK, then I remembered: Sherlock. Sherlock bloody Holmes, mad man, genius, my-- my best friend."
the clouds had drifted away in the sky, leaving the moonlight to stream in from Sherlock’s open curtains. It’s dark but as John’s eyes adjust to the faint light with the aid of the dying fireplace, he can see Sherlock on the floor beside his bed, his bedside table overturned and what John thinks is a glass shattered on the ground. Sherlock is kneeling on the ground, legs twisted in the sheets and pooling around his waist. John worries for a moment about the broken glass, wondering if Sherlock had gotten hurt when he’d obviously thrown himself from his bed; the thought is interrupted when his eyes adjust and focus on Sherlock’s prone body.
as its scapegoat. Without Sherlock's bullshit, without his 'extraordinary's and his smiles and his curls and his sleepy 'John?'s during their late night Skype chats, and his existence somewhere out there in London, John wouldn't be so desperate to get better. He hadn't spoken to the man for nearly six months now, but still, Sherlock's ostensible expectations of John are pushing him to fastrack the healing his rational brain knows he needs. There's a small tiny voice in John's head that whispers
Mycroft's barely-veiled threat put a slight damper on John's newfound peace, but he tries to allow it to only temper his reaction. In truth, Sherlock is a recovering addict, and John a recovering soldier himself. In spite of their connection during those few months, a lot has changed. John tries to look at it objectively; analytical and deductive, rather than from his insecurity or any catastrophising. He's proud of his progress, of the equilibrium he's found between his heart and his head: he
John's aware that they're in a public place, with healing and traumatised soldiers and servicemen around them, so he's not shouting but he's seething, fists clenched where Harry can't see them.
"Sherlock never had a phone number, even his Skype thingy was set up with yours, he said. But he's out of rehab now, I know it 'cause I saw his website. You're in contact with Sherlock, or you can be. So I called you, so I could get Sherlock's number off you."
"You like danger,"
"Do you?"
John's memory is completely rewritten in light of this new information: their first meeting, that embarrassing night at Angelo's, the pool, The Fall, the night when Sherlock returned, his best man speech, the night Culverton Smith nearly killed him, last night, even last bloody Wednesday, when he'd caught Sherlock staring at him and dismissed it as Sherlock retreating to his mind palace, unaware he was even doing it. His whole life is being rewritten, his identity reshaped into the kind of man Sherlock could love. It feels too big a task, being worth all of that, but John dons it a jumper, determined to make it fit.
“I’ll do it now.” A minute later John hears a familiar ping.

not to get an erection just from the sight (that and Sherlock's curly black hair, a complete mess from when Sherlock was playing with it earlier. And his lips, which were just... what they always were (which is unfairly gorgeous)). He has resorted to thinking about his phone call with Mycroft last week. “Sherlock.”
He tried Skype but it was pretty useless if Sherlock wasn't waiting on the other side. They'd only used the video chat function in the past and it was always with both of them aware it was about to happen. John didn't know how to send a request or alert Sherlock in any kind of way that he was there. The few times he'd called, it rang out. John didn't have a phone himself, let alone a phone number from Sherlock (because the phone he'd used to email John had only been hooked up on the internet, Sherlock had said) so that was out. He'd sat down at his desk to write a letter, but never received a response (would the rehab centre accept a correspondence addressed from a different rehab facility, or was that somehow not allowed?). John tried not to panic, tried not to think about all of the reasons that he was unable to reach Sherlock. They were both in a kind of unique situation, monitored and restricted by their bodies and surroundings; it did not automatically mean something had gone wrong (it did not stop his brain from wondering:
re: re: re: re: another one
"But you're... all of those times you said 'not gay'? What was that, then?"
"He said a similar thing to me," Sherlock offers. John nods, squeezing his hand again.
John stashes the phone in one of the drawers of his desk. They're not explicitly banned, but it's not like he can go out and buy credit, and there's no SIM card in it anyway, so he really does just have to hold onto it for now. He lays on his bed and goes over the conversation in his head, expecting to pick over every word and look and bury his way into self-hatred. They are, after all, both Watsons. They grew up with the same bitterly violent father and absent-minded mother, either manipulated by alcohol in their own ways. The shouting, the clenched fists and thinly veiled insults are natural and easy, despite how hard John works to unlearn them. Instead of the familiar heat of self-hatred, John snags on the sentiment of the thing, what he'd said to Harry.
he know Sherlock? There's so many things that could go wrong with getting entangled with an addict, a healing addict at that. How helpful is John's presence actually being? Is he distracting Sherlock from his recovery, rather than aiding it? Has Sherlock just transferred his addiction to John, what with their emails nearly every day and their Skype calls at least every Tuesday, but often more, instead of the drugs? Head full of what if's and buts and hopes and dreams and
“Are you angry with me, Doctor Watson?” It sounds more like a challenge, an admonishment than a genuine question.
Sherlock… what the hell possessed you to answer the phone in a sheet? That’s not… that’s not something people just do, you maniac. You absolute maniac.
“Do you believe you’re the reason for his miraculous recovery?”
Maybe it was the guilt that drove him here now, but maybe it was the other, unnameable thing… something he has yet to admit to himself. Something that causes his body to heat whenever Sherlock looks at him, the sparks of desire every time Sherlock touches him, the constant pull to be near him which had reached a painful stretch tonight.
“Really? What did you guys talk about?” John flushed again, thinking of the call.
What can’t be helped, what’s

Just two weeks John had been hopeful, mostly co-operative and forgiving of the natural journey of his bodies healing. John, this week, is
John stands up from where he's sitting, moves around to stand in front of Sherlock, who is still sitting. Even sitting, Sherlock still reaches John's chest standing, so John only has to curl one finger under Sherlock's chin and tilt his head up to press their lips together. It starts chaste, mouths closed and dry lips on one another, but then Sherlock curls his arms around John's waist and pulls him closer and opens his mouth to let John in and suddenly their tongues are dancing, tasting each other and it's
" Sherlock stops, completely stilling, only blinking slowly at John. John takes a breath and continues, "I want to be with you, Sherlock, not anyone else. I've wanted you for a long time, to date you, and kiss you, and be with you, but I've been-- god, I was scared, and then you were gone, and when you came back it was-- it felt like it was too late. And now, I've just... I've made a lot of mistakes. I did wrong by you in so many ways and it felt impossible for things to get better. But they have been, and I... I just want to be with you. In any way that means. if you don't-- if you don't feel the same way, I understand. I still want to move back, if that's alright. We'll just be... what we've been, and I'll handle the rest."

"I tried to reach you, and it didn't work. Remember I said I emailed your new account and everything?" Sherlock nods, "the first time I sent an email, I got a response, but it wasn't from you, it was... Mycroft." Sherlock's hand twitches in his and he squeezes it once. "He basically told me I should be focused on getting better and nothing else."
Sherlock's eyes travel his face a few more times, still smiling. “Can I go back to reading now?”
Mrs Hudson shook her head beside him, "that Mycroft. I tolerate him because he's related to Sherlock, but he is the son I

John's heart and brain are torn between hot anger and bubbling affection. Sherlock looks intrigued, but a bit soft, like he's afraid he's given the right answer. Sherlock does a gesture with his hand like 'hurry up' and at that, the anger wins. “Where is all of this coming from Sherlock? You’re being a right prick tonight.”
"Sherlock

“John?”
There’s a more lucid grunt and John is pushing Mrs Hudson aside, a little less gently than she perhaps deserves, and is pushing on the door. It’s locked and he huffs in frustration, getting his key out of his pocket and opening it, before bursting through the front door.
"You're a better deducer than I am doctor, then."
“yes?”
“Sherlock—”
"Yes," Sherlock says emphatically. "Yes, please. Both of you."
John wants to ask. Instead all he says is,
Sherlock says, nearly incredulous. "You don't need to stop dating for me, John. You were not ashamed about bringing women back here before, I can look after Rosie--"
In an attempt to
Meeting the man in person for the first time, despite his reticent behaviour, was as wonderful and confusing and electrifying as he had expected. The ache for Sherlock is coursing in his veins as he struggles to the floor to pick up his cane, but it's overshadowed by some other emotion, some other realisation that his brief meeting with Sherlock, something that was a mix of bitter regret and hot anger. Sherlock had (cleverly, brilliantly) deduced how long John had been in London; he hadn’t
Then there's the other residents, eyes glazed over by pain or meds or memories, or entirely vacant, the nurses who smile at him with barely disguised pity, the food which is tasteless slob, the uselessness of his arm which is kept in a sling. Oh, and his bloody leg. Diagnosed by the house doctor as psychosomatic, like John didn't know that.
He can’t help but think, though, as he slumps into bed and hears the door click gently behind the retreating nurse,
“Don’t have to be gay to like a bloke, John. It’s not the 80s anymore. There’s straight, gay, bisexual, that one’s probably you, liking both men and women.” It sounds right, and Adam is looking at him so earnestly, like he's happy to help John through his sexual identity crisis, that he lets it pass.
It would be impertinent of me, in writing this story, to not address Afghanistan right now. Since (practically before) 2001 the citizens of Afghanistan has been fighting against the oppression of the Taliban; a corrupt and vile group of individuals who have the might and ambition of an entire nation. They routinely, constantly and mercilessly hurt, kill and violate the lives of innocent men, women and children. In the canon, John had been sent to fight in the Afghanistan 'war'. I heard this expecting some kind of clear and clean difference between a 'war' vs the 'peace missions' Western military powers are imposing on Eastern countries, but no... what has happened these last few months is not new, it has been waging for 20+ years, and it cannot be ignored. John would be furious to see what's been going on, and he would beheart broken. John Watson and I do not have a lot in common (I am not clever enough to be a doctor, fit enough to be a soldier and John-ish enough to be the object of Sherlock's unbidden affection) but this, the anger and hurt and sadness and confusion, that we share. I am not going to write about John fighting a battle I have no idea about without bringing to attention the battle that Afghani people are fighting every day.
"Oh, uhm," John clears his throat to give himself a minute. "I'm here for Sherlock."
“Hello?”
“Can you promise me something?”
doctor.)
Sherlock twists the corded phone around on his finger, feeling like a tragic woman from those pathetic romantic comedies Mummy had forced him to watch once. He couldn't help it, talking to his brother always made him antsy, fidgeting the only way to release the pent up frustrated and grudging towards his brother.
“I need to talk to Mycroft.”
"John," he says breathlessly, but that's all he says, like he's just tasting the word on his lips. John kisses him again, tasting it too. The word is sweet and full of adoration in his mouth and John is blown away, again, by the force and the power of being on the receiving end of Sherlock’s affections.
He has something to go home to.
“Sit on the bed,” John commands, “did any of the glass get you?” He turns back when Sherlock sits on the bed, almost engulfed in the sheet.
you haven’t been taking the medication—”
"There's just one more thing. Mycroft told me about what... about what really happened when he found you. All of it." Sherlock nodded grimly, a frown creasing his beautiful face, but there was no flying china so John was content. "I'm sorry. If I could have known he was going to tell me, I would've stopped him. I didn't want to hear it from him, but because I do know-- Sherlock, you have to promise to tell me about things that are and aren't okay, okay? About intimacy and-and all of that stuff, if you even want that,"
“No point dwelling on the past,” he says shortly, “you must get home to Rosie. There’s a small, small but not insignificant, chance you’ve left your two-year-old daughter with a murderer.”
He'd imagined, whenever he'd finally be discharged for real-- he couldn't serve for his whole life-- that he'd meet Sherlock. Perhaps he could go on cases with Sherlock, chasing criminals and finding clues and anything else Sherlock would let him do. Maybe, afterwards, they could... anyway, that all seems to be behind him now. He'd been free and on the streets of London for weeks, fighting the impulse to tear London down to find Sherlock, trying for some of that
The voice is gentle and compassionate and low and John can't really argue. “Alright. Good night, Sherlock.”
"I'm sorry," he croaks, even though he's unsure if he should really be apologising. Mrs Hudson tuts at his side and tugs him away so they can sit at the kitchen table. John sees a pile of microscopes, test tubes and containers shoved against the fridge and he wonders if Mrs Hudson did that or Sherlock. The thought that Sherlock hadn't been experimenting since he'd gotten back sends another stab of guilt through him. Mrs Hudson is resting her hand gently against his when she says,
“It’s not… fast. We’ve been talking for a few months." John blushes at the juvenile statement. 'Talking'. "He’s been very open with me. He trusts me, I refuse to sabotage that.”
“What can I do for you, brother mine?”
“No, John.” His voice is low but not reprimanding. It's soft. It's almost... endeared. John's own voice softens and he says,
Shut up author, I hear you saying, we don't care about any of this-- well enough. Ignore my prattling and enjoy the story!
“Alright. I’ll email it to you.”
“Yes, the sentiment is a bit… sickly." John huffs out a laugh at that. "But I do appreciate the technique of poetry, in itself. It’s not dissimilar to composing music… I can find something else if you like.”
“John.” Sherlock has his fingers steepled and resting against his chin, his knees hugged to his chest to reveal checkered pyjama bottoms and John just can't stop
“… I wanted to be a pirate when I was younger.”
“Right. I’ve been talking to your brother, Sherlock.”
ouch, my feelings
“I won’t laugh.”
John breathes a deep breath, peeling his eyes open to look at Sherlock.
I'm not sure if old mate COULD survive a surgery like that but John is a very good doctor so we'll pretend yes.
“When… when someone’s got a gun pointed at you, or there’s a bullet in your leg or—or whatever might happen, when the time comes and you could die, do you promise to fight instead?”
“Yes of course.”
"Do-- did you mean it?" Sherlock asks, voice hushed, "do you really... want that? Want me, like that?"
“Bored. So bored.”
John asks himself, fingers dancing down the invisible string of his life, moving with every pathetic beat of his overworked heart. The string sings, and its voice sounds deep and gravelly and soft as it says 'fight. You promised.' The planets spin and spin and spin and disappear into light as his consciousness resurfaces.

He tiptoes quietly around the room, eyes adjusting to the dark and hoping everyone is asleep. His luck runs out when a torch clicks on beside him.
It's a clever question. It's the very thing John had been asking himself since his conversation with Adam months ago.

so desperately, his lungs burning and his stomach roiling with the sensation of having been without something for so long, like starving, or suffocating. He loves Sherlock, he loves him so desperately, he realises. He's spent the last five years head-over-heels and he feels as though he can't carry on another moment without it being known. He wants to live with Sherlock, but not just as his roommate, but as his partner. He wants them to raise Rosie together, he wants to hold his hand while they wander Tesco and invite Lestrade, and Molly, and even bloody Mycroft, around for dinner and say 'welcome to our home' and fill Sherlock's wine glass and kiss him while they move around the kitchen together preparing food.

“Me? No.”
“What?”
"He treats me like a high school girl who should be 'focusing on her studies'" he pulls a face and John chuckles a little,
When he pushes the door aside, it swings open to reveal a pathetic scene:
"I only know you were a soldier, who Sherlock had started talking to at that facility he went to. That you exchanged emails and letters and Skype and that he loves you very much and thinks he has done something to push you away, 'left, like everyone does', he said. He doesn't often break, but when he breaks he shatters, and I had to be there to sweep up the pieces." Her voice has hardened again, but a bit less than before. John nods acknowledgement to her words,
His shoulder aches, stings, itches, throbs and he doesn't care. He keeps doing the exercises (

“Who is this?” It's likely they already know and are pulling his leg, if John is to believe anything Sherlock has said about Mycroft.

He gets into the shower, luckily every room had a private ensuite, his prick still standing tall red despite his hobble from the bedroom to the shower. The warm water feels great on his shoulder which has

“No need for pleasantries, John, or pity. I heard the message clear as day when you didn’t respond to my correspondence for months on end. No need to put up a façade just because you happen to run into me in the street. Though I will warn you, I am crossing the threshold of Baker Street often, so it’s best to find somewhere new to indulge, to succeed in your avoidance of me. I

Yes, John. If you need to forego the Skype I understand
“Alright. Good.”
Sherlock's eyes scan John's face, trying to read the intention of John's conversation, before he concedes, "yes. All of the cases from private clients are boring, barely worth leaving the flat."
"You're John Watson?" She says in what sounds more like an accusation than a question. John only nods, squaring his shoulders.
John's not sure but he doesn't really care. Whatever it was, John will not let it continue anymore. He says a quiet, "hey, Sherlock" as he makes his way to the kitchen and puts the kettle on. He makes two cups of tea and hands one to Sherlock when he joins him in the kitchen, depositing Rosie on the floor with a toy she'd stashed here. "How are you?"
Once again, Mycroft has forgotten who he's dealing with.
late.
Sherlock nods from where he is leaned over a cup, "she has developed a habit. She thinks just because she has a key and a land deed, she can bring up whomever she pleases. Doesn't mind herself a lick until it's a murderer, then there's a whole hubbub." It's the most ordinary thing to say, it's even very un-Sherlock (except for the casual mention of a murderer), meaningless small talk, but John's heart is filling with every single word and he thinks he's about to pop.
“John?” Sherlock’s body doesn’t move and his voice is muffled, subdued, but desperate, scared… “John?”
“N-no thank you, Mrs Hudson. It’s late, you shouldn’t even be here, you should be asleep.”
But please, Mycroft. Just talk to him.”
“I screenshotted the computer, here c’mon.” John drags himself to his feet, his exhaustion becoming more overwhelming with every step. He might actually sleep tonight, but then it would only be light. When you're a soldier, there's no such thing as REM sleep. He boots up his computer again, which feels like a waste of power since he had shut it down before, and clicks through a few folders to find it. The laptop is his private computer, but still... The grainy image of Sherlock pops up when he clicks on it. Sherlock, in a white collared dress shirt (at this time of night? Berk). his dark curls are nearly blue because of the glow of his phone, and the tiny image is boxed by black because of the size difference between Sherlock's phone and John's computer. It's grainy in the low light of Sherlock's room but it's still...
“O-kay, and I wanted to talk to you about his residency at the New Start Rehabilitation Centre.”
Sherlock's lips curl into a small at John's shifting closer to the camera.
"You haven't been eating," John guesses,
“That’s Sherlock, isn’t it? Is he alright?”
re: re: re: Mycroft?
The reminder of his purpose here wrenches him from his revere, and he unlocks the front door with his spare key, which he’d kept even during the years of Sherlock’s Death and ever after. Mrs Hudson’s door is closed and the lights are out in her flat, leading John to believe she is asleep.
John thinks,

“The object of my destruction is unreachable to me. You are living in it.”
“Not as such. Just his.. sectioning, on behalf of you.”
This is his longest stretch of lucidity since the bullet pierced his shoulder. There's a clean entry and an even cleaner exit and his arm is in a sling but it's not
“Okay, why?”
He eats the slop. He does his physical therapy. He's settled on a therapist, her name is Ella and they do a session once a week over the phone and will continue in person once he leaves, which is only one month away.
John tells himself sternly.
He expects to connect his imaginary hand with something soft and feminine, the nurse who'd helped him with his hand-- he'd never even gotten her name, Jesus-- was very pretty, with a plush arse and impressive tits under her work-appropriate uniform. He wanted to imagine her dark red hair (obviously dyed, but tasteful nonetheless) tangling in his fingers. Instead, his fingers met with wet dark curls, tugging to elicit a low, gruff moan, not unlike the ones Sherlock made when John would wake him up to say goodbye, this one deeper in his throat, breathier.
“Hello. Are you okay?” Trust Sherlock to immediately deduce everything right away. John had just completed a nearly ten hour surgery trying to get shrapnel and stone and dirt out of a soldiers thighs. The skirmishes have been getting more frequent, and more dangerous, and its unsettling something deep in John. It makes him more tired then he thought he ever could be when he steps away from the table.
"No. it's been nearly a week since my last case."
All of the deductions and guesses Sherlock provides are made entirely from my brain, so there is likely a lack of verisimilitude, have grace. However, any snarky comment or opinions Sherlock holds are not necessarily reflective of my own.
John takes a quick moment to scan the recesses of his memory, until he finds the name, "oh, you're Mrs Hudson,"
“Okay.”
It's good to see you're focusing on recovery. The British Armed Forces strive to provide their servicemen with the best care. The sooner you can improve, the sooner you can return to your life and leave
re: another one
The nurse returns and begins to look after him, wiping away the blood and inspecting the wounds. She applies butterfly stitches to a particularly nasty opening along the top of his hand, perhaps where the deadbolt caught on it. It’s a bit extreme, John thinks, but he welcomes the fussing anyway.
"Hey, hey, steady. I know. Even when he said it, I knew it, but it threw me through a bit of a loop. I-- it just made me consider things a lot more." Pain etches itself onto Sherlock's face and John hurries to continue, "you're so clever, Sherlock, so brilliant, and the work you do with the police is amazing, and I want to be a part of it, all of it, but with that comes a lot of adjustments. Danger-"
he tells himself. despite how perfectly capable he is, the orderlies are still stripping his bed once a week and doing laundry, he will not-- cannot-- force them to clean up his.. mess.
John smiled wryly, "I do a bit, that doesn't mean it's good for me. It's not just danger, though. It's an honest adjustment to... to accept being far less clever than someone, to knowing I will always be ten steps behind you because I am average," Sherlock made a sound of protest and John shook his head, "no, I am. Compared to you, especially. And I had to be sure I could be good enough to deal with that. And I am. I don't mind one lick, Sherlock, that you're cleverer than me. So long as you're mine, I don't care."
