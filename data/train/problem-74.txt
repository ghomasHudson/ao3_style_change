John's head fits perfectly into the crook between his neck and shoulder.
“Rosie’s been asking for
from Mycroft. "Please," he adds, just to make clear that he's serious.
He moves his hands to Sherlock’s head again – he wants to spend his life touching his hair, his face, the back of his neck.
John nods.
“And how do you feel?” John asks.
“Yes,” he murmurs and kisses my palm. “Let’s do that.”
"I know you hate feeling like that. But… you're
Sherlock's features soften at that, and he leans back to press his head against John's shoulder.
His shoulders slumping, relaxing into the sensation, he closes his eyes. The gloves he's still holding slip out of his grasp and drop to the floor. He doesn't care.
, does it still turn you on, hmmm? Oh, I've been thinking about putting my face between your legs
I use my thumbs to rub soothing circles over his sharp hipbones, the fabric of his trousers rasping against my skin.
The ensuing jolt of pleasure-pain causes Sherlock to gasp and throw back his head, and John, looking punch-drunk, traces his cheekbones with his thumbs.
… I love you. I love you
“I don’t give a toss about what she means by it. To me, you’re
John, insane with want, sucks at his jugular, and then gently nibbles at the skin trapped between his teeth.
This is so intense, much more so than it has been in a long while, and he can't believe that he's so far gone already, so
His phone vibrates, and he pulls it out of his pocket and looks at the caller ID.
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his pen. He’s a full-time doctor now. He always carries a pen. Great.
It's frustrating.
"Your priorities are becoming clearer by the second, Mycroft. Your reptilian reputation might do you an injustice after all."
“I know,” Sherlock replies shyly, allowing his insecurity to shine through because John wants him to. “Thank you.”
Sniffing softly, Sherlock turns so that they can hug properly, and John pulls him close and kisses his cheek.
“If you ever feel like it’s getting too much… or if I do something you don’t like… just let me know, and I’ll stop. Just say the word, Sherlock,” John says, surprised when Sherlock suddenly reaches down to touch his cheek with his fingertips.
"What if we keep my back out of the way?" he asks and moans when I run my teeth along his Adam’s apple. “I could just---
I nod and send him a soft smile.
John kneels down to kiss Rosie on the cheek. “You ready to show off your favourite grown-ups?”
---” I whisper frantically, and even lost in my ecstasy I know that I can’t scream his name the way I want to, or else Mrs Hudson will hear.
"So you--- you thought, oh well, he'll probably try to do something funny today, better watch his every step? Or what?"
, let go now, baby, let go for me…
"I wouldn’t have wanted a shower anyway. I’ll quite enjoy smelling like you for a while." He sends him a crooked grin that looks not entirely convincing. "Might help me to come to terms with--- well, my issues. Might help me remember what’s at stake."
I get up and pull up a chair so that I can sit down right next to him.
, my dearest brother. I thought you were above that," he quips, but he can hear how flat he sounds and knows that his brother won't buy it.
– Sherlock reads this, he’ll be gone, so… why the hell not?
“Beautiful,” he says again, almost as if to himself, and puts his hand between Sherlock’s legs.
He's got a point, but John is really,
“Yes.” Sherlock nods and extends a hand towards her. “Sherlock Holmes. Nice to meet you.”
Mycroft shakes his head.
Sherlock smiles at him and his tousled state.
They're
“Nobody could be that clever.”
"Not now," he whispers, out of breath, and cards his fingers through my hair. "I'll need--- some preparation for that… But I
She hopes that when she's there, she'll see her beloved Rosemary again, her sweet chamber maid-turned-lover, and she also hopes they'll find the locket she was wearing when she died and which that devil of a husband didn't notice when he immured her body, the one with hers and Rosemary's names and pictures in it, and draw the right conclusions.
The last thing John sees before he closes his lids is Sherlock's upturned face, his impossible eyes twinkling at him, his soft, loving smile curving his rosy lips. The smile that belongs to him, and him alone.
And just like that, John gets angry.
"I--- I think I've been feeling like that for a long time, Mary. Before we met, even. I just wasn't brave enough to admit it. I'm
“I want to be inside you,” he pants. “
“Yeah, Sherlock…”
She presses her lips together. I’ve never seen her look so sad before.
"No need to apologise. But promise me you'll have some for dinner."
How can I ever be what you need? How could I
"Fuck me," John suddenly groans into the damp space between their faces, and Sherlock's heart stops.
I stare at the pretty new nurse (Mary?) with what I’m sure is a ridiculously idiotic expression on my face, but her question has caught me completely off-guard.
"Please!"
I kiss his mouth, then his cheekbones, trying to memorise every angle of his beautiful face, the taste of his soft skin, the way he breathes against my lips. Despite all my pep talk, I feel sadness constricting the back of my throat. I don’t want to cry. It’s no use.
Sherlock nods.
I look up again and raise my eyebrows.
I writhe and buck and pull at the pillow my head is resting on, not knowing where to put my hands to keep at least a tiny grasp on reality. He's driving me wild, and we haven't even really started yet.
"Sherlock," he rasps again, and then: "Roll over."
"Look at me, love," he says softly, intentionally using the term of endearment to get his point across.
“Okay?” he asks.
They meet in a slow, careful slide of mouth against mouth, their lips opening to breathe in each other’s air, their tongues sneaking out tentatively to touch, to explore. John can taste himself in Sherlock’s mouth, and nothing has ever been so intimate, so

“Let us retire to my bedroom,” he suggests lowly. “There are clean sheets on my bed. We’ll change yours tomorrow.”
She doesn't look at him.
Sherlock blinks rapidly, and John knows that look. His brain is shutting down.
John bites down on his bottom lip, sucks it between his teeth to run the tip of his tongue along it in a possessive, filthy, unbelievably sensual manner, and then pulls back slightly to lock eyes with him. Sherlock falls upwards and into him, his brain giving up. It feels like fainting. Inside him, the burning ache of his lust is coiling up tightly, almost to the point of pain, and he grabs John's hips, his sides, his restless fingers slipping on sweaty skin and failing to get a grasp and finally settling for his buttocks instead, digging into them, kneading, pulling, and John groans and claims his mouth once more.
over the edge and into you.
Well, it is out now. I know how hard this must be for him - from what I gather, Mrs Hudson has almost been like an aunt, or even a mother, to him. They have known each other for decades.
“What’s wrong with him?”
We stand there for a while, my fists still twisted in his clothes, our chests rising and falling in counterpoint, and slowly my anger dissolves and is replaced by resignation.

"No." John shakes his head, sounding breathless, but definite. "Don't stop. Just--- need to get used to it. Got a bit… overwhelmed there."
He watches Sherlock's peaceful face and brushes away a stray curl that has fallen across his closed lids.
to, John. It’s not your fault that everything’s so… difficult. And it’s not Rosie’s fault, either. I just--- I need a little more time."
John makes him forget.
They keep going. John has no idea what time it is or for how long they’ve been at it by now, and he doesn’t care. His whole world right now is Sherlock, there in his arms, giving him all of himself, and nothing else is important anymore.
“A few. A long time ago. It was--- an experiment.”
His whole body shudders and he rolls onto his front to give me easier access, pulling one of his knees up, exposing himself without shame.
Sherlock doesn't reply.
There's silence.
I fall to my knees beside him.
"I noticed," he breathes and looks back up at me, licking his lips.
,” Sherlock suddenly gasps in between two moans. “Hospital… tested---
My charismatic friend and his innermost thoughts and feelings have always been something of a mystery to me, and this situation is no exception. Gazing at the back of his head as if attempting to look right through his skull and examine his brain, I recall the events of this day and run them past my inner eye to identify the moment it all stopped making sense.
“Yes,” I say. “I’ll pleasure you until you scream my name, my love.”
“It’s actually much
“I’m all yours,” he whispers.
He's almost incoherent already, and John knows that that's a good sign. He wants it,
“What are you doing here, Sherlock?”
, indeed. He's timid at first, but becomes more and more confident the longer it lasts, and his precision leaves little to be desired. He crooks his finger the exactly right way to hit the good spots, and in the scarce clear moments between the increasingly frequent – and pleasurable – jolts of sensation zig-zagging through him, John wonders if this is beginner's luck or simply Sherlock being his usual high-functioning self.
"Mrs H got quite the show sometimes. Shameless, we were," he says, amusement palpable in his tone.
” I say. “This is more important to me than anything has ever been. It… has never felt like this before. I want to do it right.”
“Before…?” John insists.
Sherlock shakes his head again, and now John is at a loss. What is this about? What does Sherlock need? He hardly notices that his own erection is flagging, but he sees that Sherlock is losing his, and it makes him feel hollow inside. It's selfish to think like that, he knows, but he's already worried how he'd cope if Sherlock withdrew from him, now that he's had a taste. Nothing else will ever be good enough after this.
John keeps his fist wrapped around the part of him he can’t fit inside and revels in the pulsing of his lover's blood against his palm. Sherlock tastes freshly washed, of soap and skin, but there’s also a hint of his salty, slightly bitter essence hiding behind all that, and John's taste buds explode with the memory of him coming inside his mouth only a day ago.
Sherlock utters a strangled moan that goes right to John’s heart—and between his legs. His cock is straining against his pants, begging to be freed, but he tries to ignore his own need for the time being. This is about Sherlock. He can wait.
I have an idea. I know that if the worst case occurs, we won’t have the opportunity to talk to each other, maybe for months, and I want to give him something to hold on to – and if I'm honest, it's just as much for me as it is for him.
When they left the cottage a few hours ago, John wasn't prepared for the flirting, but he's not going to let Sherlock's good mood go to waste.
"Soon," he coos against Sherlock's mouth. "You're being so good for me… so sexy, baby…"
“But--- they didn’t find a body up there on the roof. How can he be dead?”
“Yes…” he rumbles. “And I intend to do all of them to you…”
bothering you."
"Somebody's in there," Sherlock mouths and points at the door to their right, which is slightly ajar. "I'll go in. You cover me from outside and keep them from getting away."
For the briefest of moments, he wonders whether it's a good idea to replace one addiction with another like this, with one that could destroy his life completely if he ever went too far, but John's fingers and his mouth and his lovely, lovely voice drive that thought out of his mind before it gets the chance to manifest itself.
"Told you it would happen one day," he wheezes, not even ashamed of his disobedient voice.
Ever so gently, he dictates my movements, pushing and pulling me up and down, and I suck with all the finesse I can muster, determined to make it the best experience of this kind he has ever had. My cock, still overly sensitive due to our previous encounter, is pulsing violently, the friction of the sheets against the tender skin almost too much and still not enough.
Why is he so sure that if he could turn back time, he would
“Ohhh,
And then he’s there.
“John---” he starts, but John silences him with another soft press of his lips against his mouth.
“Kiss me,” John tells him, because he's starving for it. “Come on. Kiss me. Now.”
I feel him stretch as he obeys, and then there is the soft clacking sound of the tin being opened.
It’s uncomfortable, but maybe that way his words won’t go up in flames with the rest of him. Or are they going to crash over the sea?
She nods.
Before my brain can catch up with what my body is doing, I’ve got the lapels of his jacket in my hands. I push him against the wall, hard, and the back of his head hits the wallpaper with a dull thud.
"No. I want you to come." He pushes himself up on his elbows, then on his hands. "I want to make you come."
Sherlock wakes up with a start and sits up in his bed, soaked in sweat and panting for air. His chest feels constricted, so much so that it hurts, and it takes him a while to identify the reason for it – he's crying, loudly, sobbing hoarsely, his cheeks wet with tears. And he can't stop.
“I can’t get enough of you,” John mumbles fervently against his lips.
John watches as about a dozen fascinated six-year-olds surround Sherlock. Several of them are wearing miniature deerstalkers, gazing in awe up at Sherlock as he gazes back with just as much wonderment in his eyes.
– womb. He or she will never know their father. Will Sherlock take care of them?
He raises his head at that and looks at me, rolling onto his side with a graceful motion to prop his chin against my chest.
My body is screaming for it by now. There’s my prostate, yes.
"Love is blind, they say," Sherlock replies bitterly, and John looks up again to stare at Sherlock's reflection.
close, but John isn’t sure.
Then he’s gone.
…” he whines, his hot breath tickling John, giving him goose bumps. “
, but that is not the reason why all of this is happening now. He doesn’t know if Sherlock is aware of that, too.
“That I am what?” he asks coldly, cutting me with what a casual bystander would probably describe as icy venom, but what I know is actually fear and disappointment.
"I do," he says. "I want you. Have done so forever. And since yesterday, since experiencing you and me together, I can hardly stop thinking about it. You've opened the floodgates, John."
Sherlock mutters something under his breath, and John forces himself to open his lids again and look back down. Sherlock raises his right hand and, holding his gaze, puts his middle finger into his mouth to suck on it. John stares, mesmerised. When the finger reappears and pops out from between Sherlock’s rosy lips, it’s wet and shiny, and John thinks that he’s never seen anything so sexy in his life.
Sherlock is panting now, and John looks up to see him gazing down at him, his pupils blown, his cheeks flushed a dark shade of pink. He lets him slip out from between his lips, but keeps his fingers wrapped around him to stroke up and down slowly, revelling in the pulsing of the other man’s blood against his palm.
“I’m taking your word for it.”
“Dr Watson. I’m about to go to the airport. I’m going to Serbia to get Sherlock. I won’t be in touch for a while.”
one after that… I wish we had the time, love. I--- I'm scared of having missed my chances of telling you how much you mean to me. Of showing you. I--- I know it's silly, but I wish I had made love to you more often when I still could. Every day. Every night. I wish I had held you in my arms, given you pleasure, told you how beautiful you are more often than I did."
, as a slick tongue, velvety and soft, rubs him just the right way.
There’s a hint of panic in Sherlock’s voice, but I have no idea whether he’s scared of being arrested or of being caught in the act.
"Okay," he says and thinks of Mary and feels guilty, but he can't stop now. He's lost this once before, and he's not going to lose it again this time. "But maybe we can get up and go inside? My legs are killing me. Do you still have furniture in there?"
"She could have changed her name," John ventures. "If I was called Emmeline Marlowe-Mottershead, I'd
So many questions. Anger. Hurt. Confessions. Answers.
John chuckles before kissing his neck once more. “I should think not,” he says, amused.
John presses the heels of his hands against his eyes. They're burning.
"Come on," John pants and pulls back to turn Sherlock around in his arms. "Kiss m---"
“Are you--- alright?” he asks, his voice shaking. “You’re
“It’s alright. It’s worth a lot more discomfort than that.”
He opens one cuff first, then the other, stroking the delicate skin at the insides of Sherlock’s wrists and enjoying the soft beat of his pulse against the pads of his fingers.

“Goodbye.”
“We’ll watch out for those bandages,” I tell him and bite the shell of his ear while I slowly push his robe off his shoulders. “The faster you’re fit to play again, the better.”
Why didn't he tell him?
And there goes “reasonable”!

the time,” I joke, hoping he’ll see everything I’m
"You're so beautiful, my love," he breathes.
And then what?
Sherlock leans into him and does, and John kisses back and slowly starts to thrust. In this position he has neither a lot of room nor leverage to go hard, but the feeling of being one, of touching each other everywhere at once, makes up for his limited range of motion a thousandfold. Sherlock follows his lead and gives back in kind, rubbing his cock against his stomach whenever he lifts his hips, and after a while they manage to find each other in a rhythm that works for both of them.
Soon he can add another finger, which obviously makes the feeling better still, judging from the way John urges him on with wanton moans and the erratic bucking of his hips, and he thrusts deeply and massages that sweet spot inside of him with the quick, circular motions that he himself likes best.
But he
It's starting to rain.
"Looks beautiful," he remarks lowly.
. I thought I didn't need it, either. But I like
"You don't have to apologise again, John. I admit I couldn't help but enjoy it. I appear to be…
Sherlock's voice has stopped quavering and taken on a soft, husky timbre that makes John’s joints feel a bit wobbly even in the horizontal. He obeys and rolls onto his back, offering himself to the other man’s gaze. He looks at the ceiling, deliberately giving Sherlock this moment of being able to stare without hesitation. He can feel his curious eyes on him as they move up and down his body, lingering at his groin, and his pulse accelerates. Sherlock sits up and then manoeuvres himself between John’s spread legs, his narrow hips brushing the insides of John’s thighs.
…" he mutters throatily and licks through the crease of my thigh until he reaches the base of my penis.
"Hey," John greets him. "Going out?"
John Watson is not great with people. Never has been. He's too introverted for that, too grumpy, too easily annoyed. Sherlock never tires to remind him that he's also not above average when it comes to quick deductions or the elaborate interpretation of clues, but– fortunately– it doesn't really matter that he's a bit of an idiot, because standing next to Sherlock Holmes nearly
Do you have--- supplies?” he asks the ceiling, whimpering under his breath when I run my tongue around him one last time and then let him go.
"I love you too, Sherlock. Always have. Always will. Forever."
It figures. Before he can make an amused remark, there's a large hand being put on his chest, pushing him gently down onto the mattress.
"That was unexpected," he says and kisses my lips, then my cheek.
“John,” he repeats.
"What?" he breathes.
“Yes…”
looking at them like this. John's gentle smile, the way he pulls her against his body as they move across the floor, the tender kisses. Sherlock can't breathe. He needs to get away, but he can't. He has to keep on playing, his hands and arms no longer obeying the commands his brain gives them.
John hooks his little finger over Sherlock's thumb and rolls his hips again, his back sliding against Sherlock's stomach and chest, and Sherlock stops moving and lets him find his own pace to give some control over the situation back to him.
“I don’t even know what’s wrong with you, Sherlock.”
“Midday heat, huh?”
. John…"
"John…"
Tight,
"I know."
good…" he pants and buries his face in the crook of my neck.
Sherlock ponders over this for a moment, then inclines his head in agreement.
," I hiss.
He was so afraid. And then everything was so beautiful.
He looks at me then, and the fire in his gaze makes me stop dead in the middle of the sentence.
Sherlock finds himself mortified by the situation, but wants to help him out regardless. His instinct to protect his friend from any harm has not died yet, despite everything that went wrong.
Growling around his hardness, John removes his hand from its place between Sherlock’s legs to slip his fingers between his lips right next to Sherlock’s cock, provoking another full-body shudder to run through his friend’s muscles. He slicks the fingers up until they’re dripping with saliva and then puts them back between Sherlock’s cheeks, spreading the wetness there.
him ever since I left the flat this morning. Now all I want is a hole to open up right beneath me and swallow me up, desk, paperwork and all. What the fuck is he thinking, coming here?
A familiar sensation of synapses short-circuiting flashes through Sherlock's brain, and by now it doesn't scare him anymore. He's safe with John. It's alright to submit to him.
She fidgets with the clasp of her handbag.
“It’s okay, John. There’s nothing unusual in that. That’s the way he made everyone feel,” she says, and, after a small pause: “All the marks on my table; and the

He groans exasperatedly and finally looks up.
hungry.”
I need to hear your voice, Sherlock.
It is more, and better, than ever before.
It’s Sherlock. But he doesn’t sound like himself at all. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but I know that something is wrong. I’ve been waiting for this call for days, but this is not like I imagined it would be. I was looking forward to hearing his voice, longing for him to calm my frayed nerves with words of reassurance. Now there’s panic in how he says my name, and my heart sinks.
"Ah, oh
you like this… It’s so good, John… I could do this forever… I could just make you climax like this, feel your penis twitch against mine when you reach your peak... feel you bathe me in your warm release… It would be
Sherlock steeples his fingers in front of his mouth, his eyes bright and alert and focussed on John's face. It's unnerving and wonderful, and John feels the hair at the nape of his neck stand on end.
, nestled into the tight space between their bodies, and he wonders what would happen if he reached down and---
“There are a lot of things one can do in an hour.”
His fingers are rubbing the nape of John’s neck, and it’s a calming touch. John swallows and puts his palms around Sherlock’s face, the mattress dipping when his elbows dig into it to hold his weight. He knows what Sherlock means by that, and although he’s giving him a wild card, he knows that what he’s holding in his hands now is a treasure – so precious and so fragile. He’s determined not to break it.
Did he just punch the wall?
They're together now, really together, and somewhere deep inside John knows that this is
he's not hallucinating this time.
"Come," he repeats.
He does not reply, but his breathing is growing heavier as he increases the speed of his ministrations, and when he presses one of his fingertips into himself, prodding, teasing, I cannot restrain myself any longer and tenderly push his hand aside.
," John spits, his nose only inches from Sherlock's, so close that Sherlock can't make out his face anymore. "This is the last time. I'm
"Almost," he hears Sherlock mumble after a while, and the next thing he knows, the other man draws back and then puts his face where his hands used to be, and John's brain short-circuits.
John laughs. They've never addressed this particular moment, not once in all those years, but somehow it feels right to do it now.
Well.
Sherlock looks at him and wonders if he sounds like that just due to the adrenaline that comes with a perfectly ordinary almost-spill of boiling hot tea, or if there is another reason too, maybe a more momentous one. He himself is grappling for a hold on his emotions, which have burst to the surface after feeling John’s touch, brief as the sensation may have been, and he can’t see how he’s supposed to survive this, whatever happens next.
"I was going to say lubricant, but if you want another cup of tea afterwards, we'll need some milk as well."

John grunts and digs his fingers into the backs of his thighs, kneading them possessively, and his tongue is doing filthy, glorious things now, working itself past the tight ring of muscle with small, but forceful thrusts, imitating what is going to happen soon, so absolutely shamelessly that Sherlock feels himself blush despite himself. They've done this before – what is it about John today that makes everything so,

," he presses out. "Again."
Tears are pushing their way up inside Sherlock's throat, and he fights them down, a silent sob making his shoulders vibrate.
John snorts, sounding exasperated. Sherlock bites the inside of his cheek.
She sniffs. Then, to John's immense surprise, she sits down beside him again.
John huffs out a small laugh.
“Mycroft had me tested after--- well.” He gestures at his back. “I’m clean. And I--- I haven’t used needles in ages.”
Sherlock sends him a crooked grin. "Liar," he breathes and closes his eyes again.
“An apology. It’s all true.”
"Did you like what I did to you yesterday?" he asks him and nips at his bottom lip. He can't get enough of this sweet, pliant mouth.
And he’s right.
“I’ll be back in a few weeks,” he says, and his voice sounds much softer now. “It might take some time to get to him. Don’t worry if you don’t hear from me – I won’t be able to communicate once I’m there.”
He looks surprised at how cold, how
“If you want,” Sherlock pants. “Here.”
John raises his head, and they look at each other, nose to nose. Sherlock seems very young all of a sudden. There's longing in his eyes, and panic, and something that John can't read, something that makes him look breathtakingly beautiful.
I'm honestly trying not to faint.
Maybe one day, he can tell Sherlock that past lovers told
I’m sitting at my desk, reading through the latest comments on the blog, smiling at the sweet ones asking me how I am coping, grinning at the ones demanding JUSTICE! for Sherlock Holmes in capslocked agitation, and ignoring the ones defiling his reputation with hateful accusations. I never waste any time or energy on those – his faithful followers are always there before I am anyway, defending him with the power of their combined devotion.
He's human after all!"
Oh no.
He hesitates, then nods.
Sherlock shakes his head, but doesn't answer. John's heart rate picks up – has he changed his mind? Has he just decided that he doesn't want this, can't do this after all?
He wants to shake him, shout at him to stop it, to tell him what this is all about. He wants to caress his face, his hair, tell him it's okay, that he can wake up now, that they'll fix this, whatever it is.
I can’t believe this is happening. I’ve been thinking of him,
“We’ll have to take her into our confidence,” I reply, just as quietly. “Without her protection, our secret will be out in no time at all. And we’re too well-known in society. We’ll have to take precautions. She loves you. She wouldn’t---”
"Okay," he mumbles into John's hair.
I’ll be with you again.
“Sherlock!”
John hums and lifts his head again to look up. The crackling fire throws flickering shadows across the room, making his hair look like a golden halo surrounding his face. Gently, he lets him slip from his mouth. There are streaks of moisture glistening on his cheeks.
“I have to go now. Will you be okay?”
Sherlock holds his gaze and rises to slip onto John's lap, giving him comfortable access to the places he needs to reach, and John supports him with his legs and slicks up his fingers, his grin turning into a slightly incredulous smile.
Sherlock looks back up again.
“Who comes up with these ridiculous rules?” Sherlock asks, sighing deeply.
"I'm that fish," Sherlock says after a long period of silence in which they listened to David Attenborough explaining how Japanese pufferfish attract mates by creating intricate patterns in the sand at the ocean floor.
guilty, for hurting her like that, but he knows there's no other way.
I shrug.
"You make love in your head," he likes to say and smile at him. "Let it happen. I'll always catch you. Always."
“Can I help? I’m a soldier, after all. I haven’t forgotten my training yet.”
Sherlock only shakes his head.
He takes a deep breath, bracing himself.
“Wait a while,” he answers, sounding sober. “You might not like everything that comes with being with me like that.”
It's so much more.
"Of course."
John's hips stutter to a halt, then begin to buck uncontrollably.
We’re standing in front of the pub, but I can’t let this go any further without telling her that this is not what she thinks it is.
"A few months ago, I had a fucking
He smiles around me and lets me slide from his mouth, and the air feels cool against my wet flesh when he lets go of my cock to let it rest against my abdomen again.
John said he loved him.
Looking at Sherlock's lips, John remembers his taste and the sensation of his mouth brushing against his and wonders how it's possible that he's the first one to have seen and felt him like that, the first one to be granted this privilege. He's so beautiful, so sensual, and so profoundly unaware of his own attractiveness. It's hard to imagine no one ever tried to make all that theirs. Well. Maybe people did try, but he didn't let them in. John is immensely proud that it's him Sherlock chose to be the first he shared himself with. He'll be the last one, the
Sherlock shakes his head again, finding himself unable to speak, to reply. He's pushing against the images John's words evoke in him. He doesn't want to think about John like that. That wasn't his John. It was another man, a man who possessed him for a while. John isn't like that. He's not scared anymore. John is his friend, more than that, even. John is allowed to see him at his most vulnerable. John, who was all around him,
"Oh God," Sherlock sighs hoarsely and finally slumps against him, boneless and limp, his arms and legs still slung around him, but much more loosely than before. "Oh John."
you.”
I pull him into my mouth to bid him a thorough farewell, and his head tips back in bliss. He is smiling. I realise he is enjoying himself without holding back, and it is a more gorgeous sight than I ever allowed myself to imagine in those scarce weak moments when I gave in to my urges and touched myself while fantasising about him lying with me.
“I find your prostate and massage it with my fingertips…
"It's a painting, Sherlock," he says as gently as possible. "Look at it. Come on, let's go a bit closer."
John doesn’t know what to say to that, so he stays silent and puts his cheek against the warm skin of Sherlock’s chest and closes his eyes. Sherlock holds him and kisses his hair again and just lets him be. They stand there like that, in the middle of Sherlock’s untidy bedroom, for a minute or two.
He's not.
He gazes at me over his shoulder, and the look in his eyes changes from urgent want to tender concern.
He nods again. Then he takes a deep breath, as if bracing himself.
"I love you too, John."

“More, more,
It'll be over.
What would happen if John tried to find out?
But revealing all that would be too much, surely, would probably scare him away, and he can't jeopardise this now, not when John is here in his bed, begging to be taken.
Sherlock cries out and his body clamps down on John’s cock, rendering him unable to move for a second, and then the rhythmic contractions of his orgasm start and Sherlock’s come shoots out of him and into the space between them. It’s hot, so hot, causing their chests to slide against each other with slick sounds that are obscenely beautiful to John's ears. He thrusts deeply, feeling every wave pulsing through his friend, his
“Then turn it up a little bit.”
"I want to be inside you," he breathes. "God--- you feel
“No.” Sherlock clears his throat, his brow furrowed in concentration. “Just give me a moment.”
What is he doing?
“Does this find favour with you?” I ask huskily, self-confidence returning to me as I sense him melt under my touch.

“Yes.”
It's frustrating.
From now on,
She opens her mouth to answer, but before she can do so, a third voice joins the conversation.
“I don’t know,” he answers, his arm tightening its hold around my waist. “There are other countries where the laws are not as strict. If we lived in Paris, we would not have to pretend as much. At least we could share a bed and no one would put us in prison for it.”
But he mustn't know. He's
Sherlock’s staring at him now, his lids heavy, his body slumped back into his chair, and he looks so inebriated that John jumps a little when he suddenly puts down his glass and moves to slide to the floor in a surprisingly graceful motion, coming to rest on his knees right in front of him.

“You think seeing you all wet and slippery will cool me down? Seeing the waves lap at those tight blue trunks when you walk into the water? Those are hugging you in all the right places, by the way…”
--- God--- We haven't done this for
Lily’s face twists into an expression of both pity and guilt.
"I want to learn about every part of you," I add, and then I just close my eyes and follow my instincts, licking first his tailbone, then the place where the cleft of his arse starts.
When he adds a spoonful of honey to his tea, his hand shakes and he has to quickly catch the falling string of golden liquid with his finger to prevent it from landing on the floor, thus almost upsetting his mug, and he hears John gasp and feels their hands meet as they try to save it from spilling its contents all over their feet, leaving John's fingers sticky as well.
So Sherlock does it again. And again.
Sherlock shivers.
“Fuck,” I gasp. “
"Get on your hands and knees for me," he says. "Or your elbows, if that's better."
“Let me see you,” John pants and moves down the other man’s body a little, licking his nipple on the way, then laving his navel with his tongue, his hand pushing at the duvet to shove it aside and off.
“I love you so fucking much,” I mutter instead and just kiss him again, more deeply this time, and he reciprocates immediately, his tongue slipping between my lips to play with mine.
His large hands are gripping the back of John's neck by now, and John revels in the feeling of connectedness this gives him.
Sherlock gets home and takes off his suit and just leaves it lying on the bedroom floor. Then he puts on his pyjamas and a dressing gown and makes his way to the fireplace, where he opens his secret compartment and takes out the small wooden box which holds his emergency stack.
“Whatever for?” he asks, and it is barely a murmur, subdued and soft and so eerily unlike his usual cool and concise way of expressing himself that to me it appears almost unreal.
John follows his friend’s lead, moving his mouth against Sherlock’s in an unhurried pace, letting him decide how fast or slow he wants to go.
," Sherlock says quickly, his panic mounting. "Stay exactly where you are. Don’t move.”
"I know, love. I know. It's alright. It wasn't your fault… Hold on to me, yeah? I'll protect you."
"I want you," he tells him, and what he actually means is
"Boring!"
He tries not to think about Mary, but does so anyway. He asks himself if Sherlock feels bad about hurting her, too. He almost certainly does.
“I meant---”
(Bitter. Salty.
His loyalty is more than Sherlock can handle. More than he deserves.
He holds me up, my buttocks resting in his palms, and begins to suck me slowly and with relish, moving his head up and down in a lazy rhythm, and the sight of his lips stretching around my girth as he looks into my eyes from under heavy lids is almost too much to handle. I shiver from head to toe and groan and feel myself swell inside the wet cavern of his mouth.
"Sherlock Holmes – do you believe in fate all of a sudden? You're not allowed any more wine."
“Put some on your finger,” I say. “And reach down.”
“Well then, Captain,” he says. “Lead the way.”
"Because---" John breaks off and takes a deep, trembling breath before he finishes the sentence. "Because you're
--- for
The looks that John used to praise, with his mouth and with his hands, whenever he glimpsed Sherlock naked or in any random state of undress. Whenever they made love. He remembers John gripping his hips, remembers his fingertips digging into his sweaty flesh and his blue, blue eyes, dark with passion, devouring him as they moved together, and he remembers the tender (or, depending on the urgency of his need, sometimes downright
He's not sure how much time passes after that.

Sherlock’s Adam’s apple bobs against his mouth and he can hear him swallow. “I know,” he whispers. “I know.”
"Yes," he whispers. "Sher--- lock…"
“Lift your leg,” he orders quietly, and when I do, he grabs the back of my knee to pull me against himself, front to front, my thigh sliding over his hip. “Yes, just like that…”
He's not sure how to act to make the whole thing as bearable as possible for his friend, who never agreed to be a part of this farce, but it turns out he needn't have worried – Sherlock seems to have decided to go all out and have some fun while playing along. Maybe it's because they have no choice. Maybe he is enjoying Wilkes' appreciation of his choice of significant other a
John's head is in his lap now. John's
His hand is shaking so badly now that it makes the table wobble a little, and John feels colour rush to his cheeks. He's ashamed of his own body betraying him like that. Rosie tightens her hold on him.
He’s adorably soft and slow when under the influence, John thinks. He nods, his vision trying hard to keep up with the movements of his head.
“Take a deep breath, then let it out slowly,” he tells me and gets on top of me, his tall frame arranging itself between my legs, and I do as he says.
He still can't speak. John keeps touching him. Makes small circles with his thumbs, ghosts his fingertips along the shells of his ears. Breathes against his back, warm and comforting.
“Sherlock. I don’t want to hang up.”
Sherlock, pale, soaked in sweat, on the floor of this room, spasming, his mouth frothing, gasping for breath. Dying.
I call in sick the next morning, not feeling like facing the world and acting as if I was alright.
“Yeah,” he replies. “Maybe we should talk a bit more.”
Okay. It’s out.
"Yes, let me hear you…” I sigh and bite the spot I’ve just licked. “Let me know what you like…"
“Come on,” John says softly and grins at him. “You’re thinking so loudly that it’s sort of distracting. You can at least tell me what it is that’s keeping you from enjoying my endeavours to get you naked.”
"More?" Sherlock then asks in a low, throaty voice that gives John goose bumps all over.
“You’re
"I’ll get cleaned up," he therefore says, and before John can reply, he gets up and flees to the bathroom, locking the door behind himself.
"What do I have to do to prove it to you? I'll do anything, John," he says, his tone desperate. "Anything."
It's a bad day.
He's quiet for a long time, lying there motionless, staring at me. I can't read his eyes.
I spill myself in two, three long spurts, and the sensation is so strong that everything around me goes black for a moment. I've had a lot of sex in my time - but I've never had an orgasm like this.
, baby,” I pant. “
day…"
And Sherlock… John doesn't think of Sherlock as a sexual being, anyway. Well-dressed and well-groomed, the other man always gave the impression of caring a lot about his outer appearance, but sex and intimate relationships seemed to alienate him. Married to his work, indeed.
Salt on my tongue.
, not an
it," John repeats, his voice firmer now. "So don't worry. You did nothing wrong."
He's almost shouting now, and Sherlock stops his ministrations and withdraws his hand, making John wince.
“Lie down. Put your head on my pillow. Take a deep breath.”
She is right, of course. But what in the name of God am I supposed to reply?
, and if so, why he never noticed them before.
They’re standing much too close now, so close that Sherlock can hear John swallow after taking a sip, and to occupy himself he gets a mug for himself, too, forgetting that a half-empty cup is waiting in the sitting room, right next to his laptop, getting cold.
I shrug, the corners of my mouth twitching again.
Sherlock's elbow bumps into him when he settles under the thick duvet, wriggling a bit to get comfortable. A jolt of something he hasn't felt since he went on his first date with a girl and their arms touched while they shared an armrest at the cinema zig-zags through John's nerves.
"My gorgeous man," John breathes, and then he guides him between his lips to suck him into his mouth, slowly, deeply, and almost all the way down.
John moves his hands to the nape of his neck and runs his fingers through his hair from there, making his way up to the tender skin behind his ears, rubbing slow, soothing circles into his scalp. “I want to show you off to the world,” he whispers. “Look at my gorgeous, perfect man. He’s a genius. He’s beautiful, inside and out. He’s so strong, and so brave, and so fucking
instead.
” he repeats, his eyes rolling behind half-closed lids, his long neck bared as he throws back his head and moans.
I listen to his gasps and nip at the tender skin of his scrotum with my lips, and suddenly I feel the muscle I’m now circling with my fingertip give way and practically pull me inside. It doesn’t take a lot of work on my part to slip my finger into his body up to the second knuckle, and when I’m there, I rest my forehead against his hip for a moment to savour the sensation.
something to happen? Did you, John?)
, for a genius you’re really dense sometimes.”
They've said goodbye to Molly and Greg – they don't have many friends, at least not many they'd want to tell about what they are going to do.
“Hello?”
“Bad--- bad things, John… Bad
John hums at the sound and looks up. His eyes have turned a deep, dark shade of blue.
Sherlock chuckles helplessly, and there are tears in his voice. "John… I
When John runs his palm down his hip and then digs his fingers into his buttock to knead it, learn the feel of it, Sherlock inhales sharply and buries his face between John's neck and shoulder, his damp, stuttering breath hitting John's skin, and John shivers and bites his ear, groans into it and hears him mirror the sound with one of his own. Sherlock's cock is throbbing against his abdomen, rock-hard and silky, and he takes it into his hand to get to know it, too. A low whimper makes it out of Sherlock's throat and he thrusts into John's fist in reflex.
After tending to his wounds and spreading a light blanket over his naked back to keep him warm, I change into my pyjamas. Then I get my bedding from my room and put it on the floor right next to his bed. I’ll watch over him tonight, and tomorrow. If he lets me, I’ll watch over him
get enough stimulation to come.
“Okay…” John puts his hands around Sherlock’s thighs and gives him a peck on the lips. “Keep your legs wrapped around me and hold on tight…and when I tell you to, lean back slowly.”
Sherlock knows Mrs Hudson hasn't forgotten the days gone by, the shouting, the slamming of doors, the bruises Sherlock tried to hide. The long silences. The hazy hours spent lying on the living-room floor, high and crying. The vomiting and soiling himself and falling asleep in the hall, not even able to make it to the bathroom anymore.
, being replaced by…
John also remembers sleeping so little and drinking so much in the week that followed that one day he forgot to pick Rosie up at Molly's after work. In his stupor, he simply forgot that he had a daughter, and he still hates himself for it. That day, he just went to the pub as soon as his shift ended and stayed until the bar closed, and then he took a cab home and just carried on drinking. He drank the whisky straight out of the bottle and never noticed that his phone was still on mute, and when the doorbell finally rang, he simply didn't react. He was on the floor by then, and he didn't care who wanted him, and he couldn't have gotten up even if he'd tried. When they broke the lock and entered the flat, he laughed. What an unlikely pair they were, Greg Lestrade and Mycroft Holmes. Lestrade went into his messy kitchen (he hadn't cleaned it for weeks) and made him coffee and Mycroft hauled him to the bathroom and into the shower, and as the cold spray rained down on him, drenching his clothes and making him shiver, strong hands shook his shoulders and a silky, yet furious voice said: "If you kill yourself, John, my brother will die. You know it. He'll
“Sherlock,” I say. “What did you dream about?”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches upwards in a tender half-smile.
"How long has this been going on, then? Why did you never tell me?" she wants to know. "I should think that I, of all people---"
He holds her gaze.
They manage to turn Sherlock around without him having to get up, and John grabs one of the thick towels they've laid out to dry themselves later and places it over the edge of the bath on Sherlock's end to give him something soft to rest his back against. It's soaked through almost immediately, but John doesn't care. He wants this to be perfect for Sherlock.
He can't be in their living-room. It's all
“Just reading comments on the blog.”
“I hope I won’t have to disappoint you, John. It would break my heart.”
"You're so fucking gorgeous, love…" John grumbles, sending shudders through Sherlock's whole body. "God, I love your cock…" His free hand is on Sherlock's chest now, and he flicks his nipple with his thumb, turning it into a hard little nub. "Are you cold?" he whispers.
Rosie sniffs and then cries out again, and Sherlock picks her up and wraps his arms around her and starts to walk around the room in slow circles, rocking her up and down and pressing his mouth against her temple to get her to calm down.
He'd imagined this would be hard, horribly so, but reality is much, much worse.
He keeps thinking of Sherlock.
Sherlock gazes at him intently, then reaches out and pushes his mug towards him, inviting him to take a sip. He doesn't say anything. John drinks, blinking at him over the rim of the mug in what he hopes will come across as a grateful manner. When he continues to speak, he sounds more like himself again.
"I love doing this to you," John whispers, his face buried in the crook of his neck. "
“I know what you meant. Thank you, John. I have to go now. Goodbye.”
hair. Despite the fact that my desire to touch him has only been growing more prominent each day - ever since he came back to me after both our lives were turned around by what happened to his wife and my sister and, in the long run, the two of us -, I know I'd never do something about it. He's made it quite clear that he's not interested in
It doesn't take him long to prepare Sherlock, not today. His whole body is yearning to be one with John, to be completed by him, and he can't wait until it's time, even though he wouldn't miss this – John's fingers inside him, moving, stretching, finding all his sensitive spots with unerring precision – for the world. He feels cared for and worshipped and
Again. And again. And
He hiccoughs lowly. His large hands grip my nightshirt and hold onto it, twisting the fabric in their grip in an incoherent gesture of despair.

Sherlock bids him a lazy, thorough farewell, sucking at him one last time before letting go, and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.

Why doesn’t Mycroft finally
“Mm-hmm,” John hums lightly as he rises to his tiptoes and kisses the spot in question, but Sherlock still has a sombre expression on his face. John know he’s still nervous, and he finds himself wishing he could somehow make this easier for him.
"Let's get the bill, John."
“Your body language tells me you’re embarrassed, but I really don’t know what for. I’ve read that couples who laugh together in the bedroom have the healthiest sex life, so I think we’re good. Don’t you?”
, you feel good.”
I can’t think of anything else to say, to ask. I’ve dreamt about talking to him for so long, but now my brain is empty. We only have a few minutes – how am I supposed to make the best of that if I don’t know what to tell him?
,” I pant and push my cock between his buttocks to tease him and myself a little more and slick myself up thoroughly.
But that will have to wait.
"Let me---" he starts, but Sherlock gently pushes his hand aside and bites the shell of his ear.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow for the fraction of a second, and John knows that he’s seen that something is off.
It's a girl.
It's so beautiful that my heart takes a leap.
, oh Sherlock, Sherlock,
I stare at Holmes, my mouth dry, my heart stumbling over every other beat.
“We should close his eyes,” she says after a pause. “Do you want to do it with me?”
in love, after all, back then in the army, and also with Mary, my poor late wife. But now I see that the memories of those loves are as nothing compared to the bright, burning feeling of unconditional affection and need flaring up inside of me whenever I look at the man sitting next to me, whenever I
When he enters the bedroom to get dressed, Sherlock is lying on the bed, his head buried in his pillow. His shoulders are shaking, and hoarse, barely-stifled sobs are wrecking his body.

And smiles.
"Sure," he says.
"Come on," John says coldly. "Let's get it over with."
And it made me angry! It didn't stop me from letting it all out on you! And I might do it again! Do you understand?!"
There’s nothing left to say after that, and nothing left to do.
Sherlock moans under his breath and John pulls back to look at him.
He opens his mouth in surprise.
John thinks it would probably have happened either way – his body doesn't obey him the way it used to in the past, and even though he still
“Nobody knew.”
Sherlock’s low chuckle ripples against the back of his head when he kisses him there. “You smell,” he then informs him and folds himself even more tightly around him.
“Sherlock—” John breathes, but his words are cut off by Rosie’s voice coming from the other room.

"Eastbourne?" Sherlock asks, and John can tell that his oblivious tone is not an act.
“You’ll have him back, safe and sound, in no time at all.”
"Okay. Good. I'm--- glad."

He seems to be forgetting what I was before we met. Trying to stay calm for his sake, I look at him and smile sadly.
She raises her eyebrows.
“God,” he presses out through clenched teeth. “
John's fingers are in his hair now, opening and closing randomly, his face buried in his shoulder, his whole body glowing and heavy with exhaustion and release.
They stay like that for long, blissful minutes, but then the baby monitor crackles and springs to life, and they hear Rosie cry and babble in her sleep.

He sniffs.
Sherlock moans and lets go of him, hastily attempting to unbutton his cuffs, but John runs his fingers down his arms and gently grabs his hands to keep him from doing so. They part with a low, smacking sound and look at each other, breathing heavily.
“This is like that, but
---okay? I
From the moment I woke up, I’ve been thinking about how little I’ve actually thought about what exactly it is that Sherlock’s been up to for the last two years. Sure, I’ve been worried about him, scared that something might happen, that he could be injured, or worse, but I’ve never really wondered what it is that he’s doing. Plotting, waiting. Hunting down Moriarty’s men. Hurting people. Being hurt. Killing people.
"I don't know," John rasps, and his hand returns to his lap to clasp the one that's already there. "I want to blame it on grief and suppressed emotions and guilt, but the fact is--- I'm--- I'm sick inside, Sherlock. I'm addicted to it. I'm fighting it now, and I--- I promise I'll never hurt you again. I'd rather die than let that happen. But… if you want a reason, I--- I can't give you one. There
He grins that insanely attractive lopsided grin of his and closes the distance between us. His arms come up and around me, and I stand there, completely paralysed, and let it happen. He sighs deeply and presses his mouth against my ear, then my temple, then my mouth. When I don’t reciprocate, he smiles and bumps his forehead against mine.
Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed as John’s hand caresses his face, his shoulders, his neck. “For the first time in as long as I can remember,” he says, “I find myself making progress; my emotions are beginning to make the smallest bit of sense. Because I have you here...and it’s easier with you. Not easy. Just...easier.”
“I regret that we didn’t do this sooner, Sherlock. I’ve been blind.”
He's really, really tired now.
"That bloke at the pub is laughing into his shepherd's pie right now, imagining us wandering around in a decrepit mansion and bumping into antiques, looking for a pensioner who's probably enjoying the autumn of her life lying by the pool in Spain or… or Eastbourne," he says through clenched teeth.
“Well, now I’m curious,” Sherlock whispers, looking up at him out of his beautiful slanted eyes, and John’s world narrows down to this chair he’s sitting in and this man who’s kneeling at his feet, a man he thought he knew so well, and yet he never expected this to happen – whatever this is. He puts his glass down as well.
Then he says, in a slightly metallic voice: "I'm not---
He takes him in, not taking his gaze off John's as he goes down deep, and the eye contact feels even more intimate than having him inside his mouth.
, John. I’ll manage. And Mrs Hudson is there, too.”).
"Your father would have hated it," Sherlock then states and, who would have doubted it, hits the nail on the head with it.
“I know. Hold on just a little longer. A few weeks. It’s almost done.”
“Just don’t get yourself killed now, okay? I want you back here in one piece when the job is done.”
pale! Christ… We’ll have to be careful, or you’ll just combust.”
"I hate the way I look," Sherlock says, standing in front of the bathroom mirror. He sounds hollow, hopeless. "I
He tilts his head into the kiss a little more, but doesn't stop speaking in between soft brushes of his lips against mine.
A barely discernible hue of pink appears on Sherlock's cheekbones.
"You're exquisite, love," he then whispers and begins to move back and forth with small, shallow thrusts, each and every one of them nudging into Sherlock's prostate, and Sherlock's legs begin to shake uncontrollably.
"If Rosie lets me, I'll work on the blog. But I don't suppose I'll get much done," he grumbles through his fingers and sighs. Then he looks up again. "I'll be thinking of you."
“Off,” Sherlock breathes and lifts the hem of John’s jumper to pull it over his head, and they have to stop devouring each other’s mouths for a second, but then Sherlock returns to nip, kiss and suck, using his lips and tongue to take John’s breath away even more vigorously than before.
Mrs Hudson takes a sip of tea.
