“S-shit,” he stammered when Cas’s hands briefly brushed his length. Cas didn’t stop, he leaned down, breath slowly ghosting over his left thigh before licking the soft skin there. He dragged his teeth while simultaneously scraping his nails over his other thigh.
here when Dean is here. This is different, and different things in this place probably doesn’t mean anything good. Something isn’t right, and Dean has a queasy feeling starting to fill the bottom of his stomach.
Dean felt Impala standing beside him, the hall big enough to accommodate her size. He took a moment to look around. The hall was surprisingly empty. Nothing but shelves and occasional tables crowded the walls. Above the shelves hung huge portraits, one for each of the past Magicians no doubt — old men sitting in a musty tower, living out their lives with the company of books.
“Morpheus.” Dean says and turns to his former angel. Castiel had said that was his name and just as Dean says his name, he turns and an ugly guy glares at him. Dean winces when he remembers how much he had snuggled with him.
Cas’s head wings flick slightly, and the little fluffy feathers at the top of his wings puff out just a little bit, but his face doesn’t move. Not even a little bit. The big

. Anna herself said that it would be illogical to lie. Should he believe her then? Castiel has barely admitted to himself that he is a Sapien Sympathizer. He agrees with what little information he has dared to look up on them and their cause, but he has gone no further for fear that Naomi might catch him. It is impossible to predict how she would react, but Castiel is reasonably certain that she would never allow him to become a Zoologist if she knew that he was a Sympathizer.

are standing on, and the sky beyond them, but it feels like the walls are closing in on him. The furs feel like they’re suffocating him, and all Dean wants is to be home in his forest again. He wants the scent of leaves and loam, the rustle of the branches swaying in the wind, and the chatter of the animals in the brush while the birds sing. Dean can sort of hear them here, but barely, and he needs out.
A small, sad smile crept onto Dean’s face. He reached up and cupped Cas’s face in return, “It sounds too good to be true.”
When the shouting stops, Dean starts swearing inside his head. He bites his lip and squeezes his eyes shut, pressing himself as close to the rocks as he can get without losing his grip. Maybe, if he holds still, the water will be able to hide him and the
This would be a strange sight if there was anyone else material in this world to witness this scene. But Castiel knows that he has won; that in the next few seconds, Dean Winchester will be saved, yet again. He feels the glow of triumph for even in death, he can, for the final time, do something for the one he loved; the one he loves; and with the faintest glimmer of hope, perhaps the one he will love.
Somehow, Dean manages to raise his eyebrows at this while maintaining his squint.
They are on a dark road to nowhere in particular and it is the first time the silence has been broken since they climbed into the Impala. It is the sort of silence which happens between two people familiar with each other, but not necessarily one which is comfortable. Castiel senses Dean’s nerves and sees him tapping the edge of the steering wheel with his index fingers incessantly. The question seems to have startled him and the silence lasts for a second too long. For a moment, Castiel fears the worst – perhaps Dean is not here; perhaps Dean has been possessed by a demon; or maybe an angel, bent on taking revenge on Castiel for what he has done to Heaven all those years ago; or this is a shapeshifter. Whoever, or whatever this is, is driving him off to a place he does
“What’s all the fuss about?” Bobby came in behind Krissy, crowding the door.
“Dean, there you are. Are you okay?” Charlie sat on the arm and snuck a piece of turkey off his plate and into her mouth.
He swallowed. “I, ah, hadn’t heard about your store.”
Re: Movies?
“Trust me, no one is throwing out the M word.”
He opened the door the apartment and heard Charlie at her computer, the keys clacked as she typed up an editorial, an article, or her latest piece for a zine. Never satisfied with her day job, she picked a myriad of freelance pieces. Feminism, queer studies, gaming, whatever she could get her hands on. She glimpsed up from her computer and swirled in her chair. “Hey Dean, please tell me you got food.”
“We’re over thirty and we’ve been dating for almost a year. Lots of people would say that’s about time.”

“They’ll be okay.” Cas sits down next to him.
The doors opened and he rushed them down to his apartment. He sat her down on the couch and went to the kitchen to get her a glass of water. “Here. How do you feel?”
NYC418: Is this weird
“I’m sorry.”
“I will. Stay warm.”
“Okay,” she pulled out a pack and lit a cigarette. “I thought you were bi, Cas. There’s a big difference between the two.”
NYC418: I’ve had a long day and would love a distraction.
“I’m moving in with Dorothy.” Charlie glomped Dean, jostling in from his chair.
“See, positives. And Rome wasn’t built in a day, or whatever, so don’t beat yourself up if you don’t change instantly. The fact that you’re actively working towards not-being-a-dick shows you actually believe in it. Like you said, you want to change, you’re taking the steps to change. You probably will change.” Dean picked at his fries. “I think that’s heavy enough for two people like, a month ago, were at each other's throats.  What should we talk about next: politics or religion?”
“Thanks. I think I really needed to hear that from you.”
“You’ll never know if you don’t take it.” He sighed. “And I’ve never seen you be so hesitant on anything. What happened to Dean “Give’em Hell” Winchester?”
“It was good wine. I stand by my decision.”
He drank half in the first gulp. “You just drop off one day and abandon the family for months. What do you even have to say?”

I think that helps a little. While I’m waiting for my life to settle back down I’ve been trying to figure out hobbies. I thought I had spare time for hobbies before, but it turns out I did NOT and now I don’t know what to do with my life. My roommate suggested puzzles, my brother baking (which I already do, so it’s not so much a hobby but a plea for me to make my famous oatmeal chocolate chip cookies for him), my co-worker suggested knitting, but I’m pretty sure she was teasing me. I’m tempted to pick it up out of spite now. Which is a great motivator by the way, spite. I dunno, it looks pretty badass. Take all that yarn and make a fucking sweater. Tiny little baby booties. Got any suggestions? I’ll take any suggestion.
“You suggested it. A suggestion is not a instruction, just merely a bit of advice.”
ImpalaGuy: Who uses the word ‘tussle’?
“Thanks.” He clutched the flowers and nudged Castiel out the door. He shut it a bit too fast and raced back to the kitchen to find the one vase Charlie insisted they get for special occasions. Overall, it was an odd experience, but he always liked the Castiel who first came into his store than Castiel Novak, corporate goon of Milton Books. He filled the vase halfway and arranged the daisies in the vase. They perked up in the water and he sat it on the coffee table. It looked nice. He picked up his knitting needles and his skein of yarn to start his socks.

He groped his pillow closer to him and covered his face. Steps edged closer and April dropped onto the bed. “How long have you been home? I didn’t think I came back so late you’d already gone to bed.” She pulled the pillow off his face and he covered himself with his arms. “Did your day not go well?”
ImpalaGuy: kiss you
“I get it, Cas. We both saw me in the cafe, I wouldn’t have accepted it if you told me sooner. But, I’m glad it was you.”
He looked up and there was Castiel Novak, his head inclined towards the empty armchair next to Dean. He hadn’t seen the guy in months and suddenly here he was like the ghost of Christmas present about to show him the sad state of his store. “No.” He nodded and sat down, tea in hand, much to close for his comfort. “What exactly are you doing?” Okay and maybe that was harsh, but he’d already been stood up, he didn’t need his business rival to make a bad evening worse.
“Hopefully there will always be people like you.” Cas can see Dean’s tense shoulders, guarded expression, and tight fists. He can make his own assumptions.

“Yeah, I wanna give this shop a chance. I know you and everyone else are concerned I’m gonna let it get to me, but it already has. If I don’t fight for it I’m always going to wonder if fighting would have kept the store open. If I fight I know I’ll have done everything in my power to keep the store open. And if we close, then we close. It’ll suck, a lot, but doing nothing guarantees the store’s closure.” Dean wet his lips. “I think it’s what my mom would have done. Fight for as long as she could and if it looked like it wasn’t going to work, make sure she could keep spreading her magic and love until the doors closed for the last time.” He snorted. “Jesus, I’m getting all sappy. Okay, I think that’s enough for one day. I’ll get the suggestions from Krissy and Kevin tomorrow. See what Charlie can do tonight.”

“No.”
“Thanks. I didn’t know how to tell you, because for awhile I didn't’ know if we were official. I finally just asked her and she said we were. It’s been great.”
“Yeah, but almost everyone I e-mail is in this room. So the probability it’s not him is pretty slim.”
ImpalaGuy: give it a chance
“Yes, thank you Jack.” He grabbed a gingerbread man.
Dean shuffles across the floor and stops in the space between Cas’s legs.
Castiel inched further down the table and picked up the meat forks to scoop out the turkey. “I just wanted them to have a nice day. I worry they don’t get enough love or have an adult genuinely pay attention to what they say. I know Jack’s mother tries, but I can’t always say the same for Claire’s. And don’t even throw their fathers in the picture. I can’t help if they wanted to go into your store. And if it makes you feel better, they had a nice time. Claire and Kaia love the Cimorene books. Jack is happy I have a copy of the ‘Mama Llama’ book at my place even though he hasn’t visited yet.”
ImpalaGuy: Did you watch those movies?
NYC418: Yes
He pet Honey most of the morning, resigned to the couch. After noon, he ventured back to his room and collapsed under the covers. He dozed through the afternoon, snatches of light from the window pierced his sleep sporadically.
“Well, will just have to find it. Was it maybe called a fair.”
Do you ever get the feeling that you thinking to fast and if you just slowed down you might be able to understand everything that’s happening without freaking out? I wasn’t always like that (or at least that’s what I say. Friends and family have told me otherwise), but the older I get the more everything bothers me. Slow walking pedestrians, people who put ketchup AND mustard on their fries, rain when you have no umbrella. Maybe something happened when I wasn’t watching, but even my employees are getting on my case and they’re not THAT older than me. Got any advice?
He dropped his yarn and stumbled to the intercom. He stubbed his toe. “Shit.”
“No reason to get cynical from the get go. Got any positivity in that angsty ass of yours?” Bobby picked up a pen and tapped it against the stack of notebooks. “Or have you already thrown in the towel?”
NYC418
“Milton Books,” she hissed.
He stopped. “Is that what they really think of me? That I’m just a big, scary, corporate guy?”
ImpalaGuy: but you’d wear a condom
“Trouble?” asked Steve.
He finished off his beer. “I don’t know if I will.”
Oh shit. Did Dean figure it out? “Yes?”
She scrunched her face. “Then why are you with April?”
He cleared his throat. “Hello Dean.” He broke out into a smile. “I see Honey likes you.”
“I was there to meet a someone I met on the internet.”
Dean tapped his foot and pushed his sleeve back to look at his watch. Twenty minutes past their agreed upon time. He should leave. Obviously he was stood up. It stung, but — no, it hurt and he was allowed to be hurt, dammit. They’d been talking for close to a year now and he thought he was close with NYC418 and yet here he was alone. His coffee was empty, but he didn’t want to get up and lose his seat. Which was ridiculous as the cafe was moderately full, tables and low couches empty. The slice of pie he had was long gone and the temptation to get another one rose. He thumbed through the pages of
Adorable. He hit reply and began to type.
“You know I’m pretty short. Kinda hard to see over people.”

“I’m well aware, but they’re both consenting adults and we are here to have a business meeting. Business first, gossip second. To the second floor.”
“This might be a bit too heavy for a gym.”
It was a lovely spring day: a light breeze, sunshine, and the flowers had started to bloom. He entered the park and perked up when each dog passed. Black lab. Daschund. St. Bernard. Golden Retriever, nope, cute family. No man in a trench coat.

“Except for when he ditched you,” added Charlie,
He pulled away. “Hey, you’re a great guy. If they couldn’t see it through all of your communication, why would they agree to a new meetup? They’ve got to be as excited as you are. Take the chance, I think it’s going to be good.” Oh dear, he didn’t know Dean would be so worked up about their meeting. But to be fair he completely flaked on you him the first time they were supposed to meet, well he didn’t, but Dean didn’t know that.

April giggled and leaned into him, dragging her hand down his chest. “That was such a good show. And I’m so glad we caught up with your brother afterwards. He sure know how to pour a heavy Manhattan.”
“Okay, one, you’re already here. There’s a chance they’ve walked by. You could’ve seen them. Two, it’s shitty to stand people up, just don’t do it. And three, regardless of how cheesy it sounds, maybe they’re the one. Maybe this is the one person who will put your head on straight and make you realize you need to stop with this whole April thing. Are you even happy with her?”
She smiled. “Yeah, maybe one day we’ll get that off the ground, our own little queer publishing press. But you know others are already fighting the good fight.”

He hooked the lights in the top corners and trailed remains down the edges. Krissy waved at him through the window and hurried inside, a swirl of chill and flurries behind her. “I always forget how cold the first snow is.” She scurried to the counter and sat down the goodies: coffee, hot chocolate, muffins, and cookies.
Jack grinned and shook his head. “No Cas, Claire’s taller than me.”
Castiel pulled his hands from the sink and dried them off. “When did you get so mature?”

While Dean could put up a front for his employees and customers, on the inside he panicked. He couldn’t lose his mom’s shop. This was her legacy, what felt like home the most for him. If he lost it, it would be like losing her all over again. He was going to fight this in anyway he could. He’d need to sit down, do the math, probably talk things over with Bobby. Charlie could help, get some of her friends to spread the word. Too bad he wasn’t a queer bookstore or she could put together a rally in one evening to “fight the man.” She was working on the children’s end. The fight was slow, but she was determined for diversity and inclusivity in children’s publishing. Dean couldn’t imagine what would happen if he put a copy of

He bumped her shoulder. “I think I can take care of myself, Charles.”
It was crisp outside, a bit of sunshine, no flurries when he first came into the store. It neared five when he finished up. The packages and sign would be picked up tomorrow, the store put on the market, and that would be it. The end of an era.

You know at the end of a movie when you leave the theater and the credits are still rolling and the cast and crew names scroll by and you have no idea who most of them are, but they were apart of the production somehow. And sometimes it makes me think about the people who aren’t major players in my life, but they’ve changed it somehow? Like people I see regularly on the subway or at work, people who I vaguely know, but not really. Do they even affect my life or are we running parallel?  Does it even matter? Everything’s about perspective anyway.

Dean's tapping and humming merge as one with the machines. Cas could watch Dean's hands as he sorts and cleans for any number of hours. He’d never caught Dean’s scent in the seven months they’ve worked together. Between Scent-B-Gone, the scent neutralizer sprays on the main floor, and so much soap and cleaner Cas could barely smell himself after a shift.
“And that’s not the only reason, Dean. This whole – ” Castiel gestures with his arms swinging in vague directions. “predicament; being human – it is something completely unfamiliar to me, and I’m trying to learn as much as I can, as fast as I can. I’m still getting used to the fact that this body is me from now on, and beyond this, there is just so much more to learn about being
Castiel wakes up to the sound of the alarm he has set, the room still dark save for the glow of the night light. His eyes adjust and Castiel finds himself wishing, not for the first time, that they lived somewhere with windows so he can feel the sunlight streaming in, warming up the room and his skin.
Between the occasional hunts, Castiel spends most of his time reading, be it fiction or non-fiction. He finds it a good way to keep himself entertained yet learn about the human condition at the same time. He reads widely, but he also tends to devour any literature he can get his hands on about gardening and beekeeping, much to the rest of the Bunker’s bemusement, considering how there are no opportunities to put that knowledge to practice. Castiel is not deterred – the theory is enough to keep his mind engaged, and truth be told, he is waiting for the day they move out, whoever “they” refer to.
“Sam. You have to go,” Castiel interrupts. “I know you aren’t here for what you claim to be here for.”
“Sam? Dean? What’s the commotion?”
He has narrowed it down to several factors when it comes to human males. Having some height seems to be important. Facial symmetry is important as well, though Castiel finds it difficult to wrap his head around that since his true form had multiple faces. For some reason, humans see the leg-body ratio as a measure of attractiveness too. Facial structure? Eye colour? Hair colour? Voice? There are countless variables and when Castiel tried to gauge himself against them in front of a full-length mirror he found in one of the Bunker’s many rooms, he realised it to be an endeavour beyond his limited human experience. Needless to say, he gives up in record time.
“Ah, yes. The Elk River was particularly beautiful,” smiles Castiel. “I remember the white waters at the rapids and some of the wooden bridges. It was almost like we stepped into a forest out of a fairytale.”
Cas breaks into a smile. That wide, gummy smile.
“Whacha doin’?” asks Dean. Castiel turns around to face Dean with a defeated expression.
, possibly regret being able to be beside the people I love, as finite in time as it may be.”
Dean opens his mouth to speak, but Castiel silences him with a finger to his lip.
Dean feels his lips curve up just a fraction. “Me too, Cas,” he says. They pause for a few seconds, the blade hanging in the air, poised for Dean to make his move.
“No – I mean, - yes, damn it, I’m fine, Cas,” Dean dissolves into giggles as he feels some tears coming up. He is not sure if they are tears from the rather unpleasant sensation of choking on one’s saliva or tears of sorrow; sorrow at Castiel’s description of what has been
“You are, Cas,” says Eileen. She leans over and lays a reassuring hand on his arm. “You’re an attractive man and you should know that.”
“If you aren’t tired, wanna go out for a drive? You aren’t obliged to, of course, but I’m bored and thought you might want a change in scenery.”
"Don't be scared, Cas. It'll be fine. You'll be fine. I'll find you if that's the last thing I do," Dean whispers into Castiel's ears.
“When I was raised out of perdition, in your own words,” Dean says. “I remember that, Cas. ‘Course I do.”
“Oh, come on. You’re believing Dean when he’s being all weird?” Sam raises his voice. “Look, I don’t know what’s going on here, but I came by for a visit and Dean just – ”
“I’ll see you in the morning, Cas,” Dean says as he turns and reaches out to the bathroom door.
“– fuck you, that’s why.”
“One of the things we’d look at would be the wings. The colour, the shine, the wingspan – they all matter. Angel forms are varied, but certain animal faces are deemed more attractive than others.”
Dean closes his eyes and conjures the image of Castiel in the inky darkness before him. He takes a final steadying breath.
“Cas, I’m sorry about what happened to your grace.”
“Just part of the surprise, Dean. If Jess was coming, you know she wouldn’t be able to keep it to herself,” Sam swallows and forces a smile. Dean presses on.
"Cas, buddy," Dean speaks shakily. "We've tried our best, haven't we?"
Castiel lunges forward and grabs Sam by his arm. Dean barely sees the movement and is taken aback by the speed of Castiel. He blinks, hears a flutter of wings, and he is alone in the room.
Castiel hums, whether in agreement or annoyance (or both), Dean isn’t sure. He looks across the expanse of the lake which is littered with other people fishing.
He makes his way back without any mishaps and switches on the night light in the corner of his room. It is just bright enough to provide a soft glow, but not enough to disrupt his sleep. Castiel crawls into his bed and pulls the blanket up around him. It is particularly thick – as an angel, he never had to deal the issues of temperature and body heat, so he constantly finds himself feeling too cold now. He figures that living underground does not help the situation, but is grateful enough for a roof over his head. Castiel snuggles further into folds of the blanket, closes his eyes while conscious of the faint glow of the night light permeating through his eyelids, then allows himself to fall asleep. It was not restful.
” Sam moves towards Dean as he sees his brother starting to pace backwards, his eyes darting around but not focusing on anything in particular. “Dean, listen to me, this isn’t rea – ”
“Tell me about the last time we met, Sam,” says Dean. Sam straightens up.
“Why should I?” Dean whispers. It is barely a question, more a statement and declaration of the desolation he will have to face if he chooses not to rebuild the set, to step back into what is real, even if
“And here I thought – we could have one day out, just
Dean takes a proper look at Castiel to his side now, and just as he does, the Impala passes under a streetlamp – and another. The streams of yellow light glide over Castiel’s features and Dean’s breath catches, not for the first time, at Castiel’s profile. Castiel looks to Dean, and their eyes meet for a moment.
“I’m sorry for shouting.”
“Erm, we went to a diner?” Sam ventures. He starts to move off the sofa and he rises slowly.
“But… what about all this,” Dean gestures around their living room. The couch they are seated on, fake leather worn in over the years; the fluffy rug he curls his toes into, bought by Castiel the first time he moved in with Dean; the salmon pink wall in front of them, painted not that long ago and painted only on one side of the room, something settled upon after an unnecessarily heated fight; the photo of them on their wedding day in matching tuxedos, frozen in laughter over a joke long forgotten, encased in a wooden frame handmade by Dean. All of it as real as the ethereal morning mist right before the break of dawn.
“My point still stands, Dean,” Castiel says as he brings the steaming cup up to his lips.
“The last 12 years, Cas. Ever since you stumbled your way into that barn, you – ” Dean says. “Ya know, they say change is the only constant. You have been my constant.”
Castiel breathes with relief, a little too loud, a little too dramatic. Dean shoots him a glance.
“Erm – so, yea, we’re supposed to head to the lake today?” he props himself up and rubs Castiel’s arm. “We should start our day early.” Castiel stretches his arm to Dean's other side to grab the blanket and yanks the blanket back over himself in a graceful arc. He tucks himself in as it flutters over him and closes his eyes again.
“It can also refer to a landing or to alight,” says Castiel. “I’d say that’s appropriate foreshadowing as well, don’t you think?”
Sleep isn’t something that comes easily to Castiel ever since he was pulled out of the Empty by Dean. The feeling of closing one’s eyes; of letting one’s awareness go, like tiny sea creatures being pulled out of a tide pool during high tide; simply does not sit well with Castiel. It reminds him too much of nothingness.
"I love you," he repeats.
“Cas, why are you telling me – ”
“Sam?” Dean’s voice rasps with disuse. He nudges Sam’s head with his knee. “Hey, Sam.”
“Could be better,” Dean groans. He is thirsty. “But I’m alive, so that’s good. Is there water?”
Castiel shakes his head. As much as he enjoys the company of his family, he also appreciates his time alone. Besides, Dean leaving the Bunker will give Castiel some time to read up on something he has been hoping to learn more about.
“I love you too, Cas,” Dean says as he wills a smile onto his face. There, not so hard, was it? The words were spoken with practised ease which comes only with years of casual use. Everything is fine and he just needs to get out to clear his head. “We should get on with breakfast, wouldn’t want to set off too late. We barely get any time to ourselves nowadays with work.”
“I would have heard a flush,” Dean says as he picks up the mug to take a sip.
Dean pauses to comprehend what Castiel – no, this
“I don’t know if you can do that,” Castiel grimaces. Dean moves to the floor, one hand still gripping Castiel’s hand, the other holding the angel blade.
” Dean demands with his voice raised. He takes a threatening step towards Sam.
Dean jerks his gaze away from his plate and towards Castiel. His eyes flit away to Sam, then to Eileen, back to Sam, and then to Castiel again. Castiel sits, expectant. Dean clears his throat.
And that is how Dean, Sam, and Eileen find themselves confronted with a question they never expected from Castiel over dinner. Dean has roasted some chicken because he found some recipe online experimenting with miso as a rub and Sam contributed with some vegetables he bought from the farmers’ market nearby, which Dean has roasted as well. Eileen, feeling the menu to be lacking some sugar, quickly whipped up some parfait for everyone.
“Dean?”
day, without you getting into some hissy fit over how I live my life,” Dean says through gritted teeth. He reels the line in and drops the fishing pole with a clatter. “This was supposed to be fun, Cas. Just chillin’. And you want to make it into some attack on me just because I happen to
“I texted you yesterday that Cas and I will be out ice fishing today. You’d know we wouldn’t be home now because we came back early only due to –”, Dean breaks off and clears his throat. “Due to the wind picking up and we haven't dressed appropriately. So, back to the point: how are you here?”
"Dean, there's nothing you can do." Castiel looks down upon Dean, watching over him for the final time. His eyes are sincere and accepting.
It is only an hour later, while Castiel works away in his office doing his professor stuff while Dean lazes away in bed when the doorbell rings. Dean decides to get up and gives a perfunctory
Castiel gives Dean a look as he reaches for the plates but to Dean’s relief, remains silent. He leaves the kitchen and Dean takes a second to recompose himself. For the life of him, he cannot figure out why what he is doing now – breakfast – seems as much a routine as it is a brand new experience for him. He knew by memory (
“You were gone again, Dean. We should get back so you can rest. I’ll drive.”
This time, it is Castiel who tenses up instead, and Dean turns in his place to face Castiel. He looks at Castiel, but Castiel turns away and lets out a huff. Dean leans forward to attempt to draw his eyes back. He does so with ease but recoils when he sees the intensity in Castiel's glare.
) before his mind wanders, and he finds himself having to read the same paragraph again for what feels like the hundredth time.
Dean lies in Castiel’s embrace – one which feels familiar when Dean knows that it shouldn’t. It has been a few hours since the sky has gone dark and they have retreated into their bed, and it was a few hours well spent with cuddling, sex, and hushed whispers.
“Just thought it’d be nice to surprise you. We’ve had a bit of a lull in our caseload recently and I finally found some free time, so why not?”
"You apologise for nothing, Cas. And don't you - don't you worry about me. I'll be fine."
“Yes, why?”
That is how Castiel finds himself in front of the bathroom mirror in the dead of night. The fluorescent light casts harsh shadows all over the room but this brings Castiel comfort, as shadows can exist only with the existence of something.
Castiel responds by pulling the blanket over his face and scooting closer to Dean. He lets out a deep sound, a bit of a growl, a bit of a whine. Dean smiles and braces himself for what he is about to do – he whips the blanket off both of them, not without regret at the loss of heat, but with immense pleasure as Castiel groans.
“I don’t care if you’re Sam or not. Get out of my house,” Dean says. He feels unnerved, as if the walls of his apartment are going to collapse, like a box with its corners cut away, like the destruction of a room in a studio set, as if this was all just a show and he is a mere character, living out actions with a constructed backstory. “Get out of here, Sam –
Three words; and a wave of unreality crashes over Dean as he allows himself to drown in Castiel’s gaze. Dean
“Look at yourself? What for?”
“Dean, are you okay?”
“I flew.”
“Goodbye, Dean.”
Dean sees a brief moment of panic flash over Sam’s face before it quickly rearranges to one of neutrality. Sam clears his throat and shrugs his jacket off.
That doesn’t matter. What matters is that Castiel is alive. He is here.
Dean flinches at the words; they are blunt and hard-hitting, but nonetheless true. He closes his eyes and swallows, then he opens them again.
“I – never mind. Anyway, I already told you, Dean. Just dropping by. Besides, why are you treating me like I’m not welcome here?” Sam shrugs his jacket off. Dean pauses at this and considers Sam’s question. He could not, for the life of him, explain why he feels uneasy, but he just knows that this is wrong. Sam takes Dean’s silence for acceptance and sinks back into the sofa.
Dean clears his throat and rubs the back of his neck. He takes a step back and returns to leaning his back against the Impala.
as he passes by Castiel’s door – when Castiel is in his office, he may as well be in a separate universe. Dean approaches the door and swings it open. Dean’s brother stands in their doorway, hands tucked into his puffy jacket.
, Castiel thinks, and it occurs to him that the paradigm has truly shifted. That home is no longer a place he returns to like it has always been with Heaven. Home is the people he returns to, the ones whom he chooses to spend his now-mortal life with. A home that is not necessarily permanent in a locality, but absolute in its temporality and in love. He turns to Dean and watches as the orange glow of the streetlamps pass over his features.
“If you say so, Dean,” Castiel grins.
“Dean. I don’t think I was comparing myself to a fish. Why would you say that?”
“Wha – where did Sam go? Where did
“Dean, I can’t figure out if I’m attractive by human standards,” Castiel explains. He takes a step towards Dean and Dean takes a step back. “Maybe you can offer some clarity?”
“I’m not sure, Dean; but I think – you’d remember, of course, the handprint you found on your shoulder when you were brought out of hell?”
“Cas?” Sam’s eyes light up. “Cas! Of course, I’m Sam! You need to get Dean to calm down, I have no idea why he is being like that.”
"Dean - I'm sorry to have put you in this position. And...I'm worried about -"
It is the middle of the night and the Bunker is dead silent. Everyone is asleep, it appears. Everyone, except for Castiel, former Angel of the Lord.
Castiel turns, back against the Impala, as he faces the sky once more.
“Dean?”
“Imagine being tempted with something you naturally crave,” says Castiel. “But the moment you reach for it, you’re immediately punished for it by being pulled into the Great Beyond. You may survive, you may not, but the point is if you return, you will never be the same again. You will be scarred. And all for what? Isn’t that just cruel?”
“Meg did mention your true form was hot,” Dean points out casually. The mention of the demon he became unlikely friends with brings a grin to Castiel’s face. The only being around who was willing to take care of him when he was not fully himself and was more interested in playing Twister than anything else. The demon who, way before Crowley did, showed that
) in which cabinet the flour was kept, where to find the sugar, and how to work the damned weighing scale which required a slight whack to function.
“I was given the choice between eternity and mortality when you came for me. I chose – I choose you,” he gulps at his choice of words and hastens to rectify the situation. “I choose humanity.”
“As I’ve alluded to in the past, my true form was as big as the Chrysler Building – yes, size matters,” continues Castiel.
Dean's eyes widen as he sees the black substance slow down in its consumption of Castiel after having gotten rid of Billie. The goo slows down to a crawl, as if (no, surely) mocking Castiel's demise in front of his beloved.
you, Dean, and I can only thank the stars I created that I am here to say it.”
“What about it?”
“Because – ”
Castiel realises the act is up. He sighs. This could have only lasted that long.
Dean focuses his eyes back on Castiel.
The thought that this is not a body he can abandon anytime, at least not until he dies as a human since he had to sacrifice his grace to leave the Empty, still overwhelms Castiel at times. Throughout his millennia of existence, he had worn many faces and never had to deal with the permanence of a physical body, but this is it. This is the face he is stuck with.
“Isn’t it strange, Dean? That people would catch fishes for their entertainment, even if they are to be returned to the waters?” questions Castiel.
“Yes, I get that, but – ”
"I love you."
He stands on his feet, trying to ignore the soft squelches the black goo makes as it creeps across Castiel. He brings himself to face Castiel directly and cups Castiel's face. If this is the last he saw of Cas, he never wants to forget those blue eyes.
Castiel shrugs.
He quickly whips up some pancake batter – Castiel loves pancakes – and turns on the coffee machine while he waits for the pancakes to cook. Dean looks out of the window and sees a landscape transformed from the previous night by a blizzard. The plan to go ice fishing at one of the lakes out in St Paul should be fine. Soon enough, the smell of coffee draws Castiel into the kitchen and Dean feels a pair of arms wrap around his waist as he drizzles some maple syrup over the pancakes.
“No, Cas. Because nothing for us has ever been easy," Dean proclaims. "This is my final fight when I'm back out there. I’ll be fighting to get to you because you deserve better. I deserve better.”
Sam jerks up with a start and realisation crawls into his eyes as he looks to Dean. He shuffles on the floor over to Dean and pulls him into a hug.
“For what it’s worth, Dean,” Castiel says with a comforting smile. “I’ve enjoyed our time here.”
“Thank you, Dean. I love looking at the stars.”
and his gaze refocuses to see Castiel still looking at him, worry starting to outline his features.
“You asked me earlier in the car why I was so curious about my human features – perhaps you can guess why now. Angels are taught to not flaunt and compare, but I was always different and felt a bit of pride in my true form, to be honest,” Castiel says as a slight blush rises in his cheeks and he turns away to look across the field in front of them.
“Uh – what do you mean, Cas? By ‘attractive’?” asks Sam. Castiel audibly gulps.
“Are you okay? You seem a little out of it today, even back in bed earlier.”
“The Arabic word which Vega draws its name from has another meaning, you know?”
Dean is surprised to find the corners of his lips curling up at this.
“Geez, Cas.”
Considering that, one question has been stuck in his mind, like an incessant itch which refuses to leave until it has been scratched: is he attractive by human standards? He tells himself that this question is more of an academic one rather than him having any real investment in how he looks. Just his natural curiosity at work.
“You knew, Cas. You were aware all along, weren’t you?”
“Cas, even Rowena called you handsome back then. Remember?” Sam laughs. “Damn it, I miss her so much.”
“I’m not sure why you’re asking – ”
“Dean, did you know I was one of the most beautiful angels in the garrison?” Castiel asks as he lifts his gaze to meet Dean’s. Dean tilts his head, a small mannerism he has picked up from Castiel after all these years, puzzled by this sudden change in topic.
Dean scrambles on his feet over to where Castiel remains rooted to the ground as the darkness envelopes his torso. He claws with desperation at the substance, hoping against all to save Castiel for once, or to at least reclaim a modicum of time with him. He fights for purchase on the black liquid, but grabs nothing.
“Dean,” Castiel’s low voice rumbles against Dean’s back. “It’s time.”
is an outsider, an intruder from beyond. Because the
Castiel loves him and that he loves Castiel back, but he cannot shake off the feeling that those three words are so utterly foreign in his mouth, they may as well be Enochi –
Palm still in place, he brushes his fingers through Castiel’s hair on the side. “Your dark brown hair provides a nice contrast to the blue of your eyes, and I remember seeing on some Internet survey that dark hair and light eyes are deemed the most attractive combination. The way your hair can get messy but still looks good helps too,” he teases.
A blush grows on Dean’s cheeks and he gives Castiel a light push on the arm without looking away from Vega. Castiel laughs and he is finds himself feeling lighter than he has in – well – millennia. For once, he also feels tired.
It is dark in the room. If this was summer, there would have been the sound of crickets chirping outside, but not tonight. On this winter night, there is only silence, punctuated only by the breathing of two men.
Dean chooses his next words with caution too.
Dean nods and gets up to pack the rest of the items. They trudge back to the parking lot as the wind picks up and quickly sheltered in the car with Dean riding shotgun. Castiel was just about to back out of the lot when Dean speaks.
Dean moves his face behind Castiel’s arm and squints in the rough direction of where Castiel points at. He sees three stars, the brightest ones in that expanse, positioned in an almost-isosceles triangle.
Castiel shrugs and takes a bite of the pancakes. He lets out a low moan and closes his eyes. Dean kicks his feet while he begins on his own plate. Castiel kicks back.
“Pike is supposed to be pretty abundant here in Lake Phalen,” says Dean. “Maybe you’ll get lucky – beginner’s luck, you know?”
“We’re going to raise Cas from perdition.”
Dean brushes his thumb over Castiel’s eyelids. “Your blue eyes; statistically they’re uncommon for humans, and that’s probably one reason why people find blue eyes attractive. I’d imagine iridescent black feathers are deemed attractive for similar reasons.”
“All this – it isn’t real, Cas. How can you be so… accepting?”
He will wake up in a world without Castiel, but it will only be so until he rescues him from the Empty. The decision to do this becomes slightly easier.
“I love you too, Dean.”
“And Dean, it all comes back to you. It has always been. For some reason, it’s as if life did not begin until I’ve met you, despite feeling like I have lived a million lifetimes all the same.”
“So, what, you’re saying I’m being cruel?” Dean starts. “You’re saying that I’m intentionally causing misery on the fishes here?”
“Wha – why are you here?”
, he thinks,
“Isn’t that a little… intimate?” Castiel has learnt much over the past decade about human boundaries and he admits he does not yet know all its intricacies, but he is quite sure that sleeping together in a room pushes these boundaries. It is not a concept he understands intuitively. As an angel, they rested in their garrison together without privacy and could communicate telepathically – physicality meant nothing.
they do? Netflix? Literally nothing? Hiking? Yes, hiking sounds good.
Dean feels some movement beside him and suddenly feels a rush of cold air against his back when Castiel twists out of bed. He jerks his head around to take a look and sees Castiel making his way to Dean’s side. Castiel brings himself down in front of Dean by the side of the bed, positioned as if in prayer. Dean sees Castiel’s face, half-illuminated by the moonlight coming in through the windows, and Castiel reaches forward to leave a peck on Dean’s forehead.
He does not know how long he has been standing there, but it was long enough for him to realise that for once, he has time. There is no impending apocalypse to save the world from, no Big Bad to defeat, and just the occasional monster to hunt. There is so much time, so Castiel finally uses it to look at the face in the mirror. It is both the face of the man he has taken as his without much regard all those years ago, yet very much
He looks back up and sees Castiel: blue eyes, dark messy hair, faint stubble. Dean takes the moment to imprint Castiel’s face in his mind’s eye, lest this is the last time he ever sees him again. He rises and sits on his bed with the angel blade in his lap, reaching out with both hands to cup Castiel’s face and trace his thumbs over his features. And then, it occurs to him.
They stare at each other for what feels like an eternity. Castiel begins to think that timelessness is not specific to the Empty.
They’re the only solid thing in the cloud of fins, frozen in place among the crowd. As the rest of the swarm moves, those eyes stay in place, watching him — bright, blue, and piercing his very soul. Dean can’t look away.
“Dean. How are you?” Castiel asks and he tilts his head. Dean almost gets up and kisses him, but he doesn’t dare to. Maybe Castiel saw a different dream and was just confused when Dean had wanted that kiss.
take captivity well.
“How do they make this in your tribe?”
As he leaves the small camp, intent on rejoining his mother, something catches his eye. The vines of ivy covering the wall are disturbed in one place. He steps up to the wall and brushes the vines aside gently, parting them in the same way they appear to have been done several times before. Castiel is not expecting to find clusters of lines scraped into the wall under the vines, and he drags a nail through one of the indentations.
Maybe… maybe Cas will come this time? Cas coming to watch him every time Dean is in the Alone Room has been one of the few constants about this nightmare place. So, why isn’t he coming now? Dean doesn’t understand why Cas just… stopped. Did he do something wrong at the test that makes Cas not want to see him anymore? What made him go away?
, May keeps glancing at Dean. He makes it a point not to look at her. If he does, then she sees it as an invitation to talk to him, and he’s not in any mood to play with her or listen to her endless questions about everything he lost – everything that still makes his heart clench. Some mornings he wakes up still expecting to have Sam cuddled up against his side, or to hear
Part of him wants to object. He’s a big boy and he can take care of himself, just like he’s been taking care of himself since he was stolen. But right now… What’s the point in arguing?
Eventually, the tribe stops trying to interact with 1-M-7. They split off into their own activities, leaving food and a blanket for 1-M-7 to make himself comfortable. Castiel finds it concerning that he has not touched the food yet. Of course there is no way of knowing when 1-M-7 ate last without checking his stomach contents, but what if he has not eaten for many hours? He is small, and a child. They need nutrients. Hopefully he will not put it off for much longer.
Even the females seem to take issue with 1-M-5’s attitude. The redheaded 1-F-5 and the one-eyed 1-F-2 are from the same tribe as 1-M-5. While they get along well with each other, both of them do not seem to like 1-M-5 a lot. It is only 1-M-6, the older male who was collected at the same time as 1-M-5 from the same tribe, that seems to get along with him.

Dean will have to suffer through two moons of that before he can go down to the ground again. And when he does, his parents will make him put to the test everything they taught him. He’ll be asked about the information they shared, and point out plants they described, and which are good and which are bad. It’s a lot for only six winters, but Dean works hard to remember it all.
“You definitely are stubborn,” Sam sighed, resting his eyes on his stray shirt, “Here, I’ll help you put this on. It’s better than the wound being exposed.” Dean let his brother slip the shirt over his head, gritting his teeth as the fabric settled on the burn. Fortunately, the shirt was loose enough to leave room for his skin to breath. “Here, this too.” Sam guided Dean’s arms through the sleeves of his jacket until it hung loosely on his shoulders. The warmth of the dry clothes caused Dean to relax, his eyes slipping closed at the small second of comfort. Sam huffed a small laugh, “Better?”
lurches towards them, but she’s so far away. Dean looks around for anything, any way to hide.

Despite it being the middle of the night, the Alpha Sector enclosure is lit with floating lanterns. Castiel squints in surprise at the light. He was not expecting it to be as bright as midday as they step out of the lift and onto the empty bridge. All other Aetherians are already down in the enclosure.
Though it will still be at least a few more years of lessons and the approval of his thesis before that will be a possibility, no matter how efficient Castiel is with his learning.
“Who said I wasn’t? The demon who traded with me for his own gain? Humans who follow rules only they benefit from? Angels and demons, they treat you all the same. The more souls, the more power they have. Souls are just celestial currency. Your angel knew this when he betrayed you didn’t he?” Dean didn’t take the bait, continuing to watch her delayed magic. “Higher powers use them, so why can’t I do the same?”
This was it. He was done.
. So close. So close.

Sam’s laugh was soft, as was his gaze, “I think that’s the first time you’ve admitted that.”
finally gets a reaction. All of Cas’s wings flick out in surprise and he stands up just a little straighter, eyes widening. Even Big looks a little surprised, though the only part of its face that moves is an eyebrow as it looks down at Cas. Spots of colour appear on Cas’s cheeks, and then disappear just as quickly. He shuffles his wings against his back again, straightens his shoulders, and glances towards the clear wall and the
The child’s nose wrinkles a bit. It focuses on the flat thing for real now, and taps at it a bit. Eventually, it tilts its head to the side and its ear-wings flick slightly. “Being a specimen means that you are an example of your species that is used for scientific study and display.”
He steps off the perch and does his best to stand straight, wings held perfectly folded against his back, and his chin held high.

to bring it out in the first place, and it didn’t even look like it was heavy to them. Bill and Donatello even struggle a little with carrying what Dean knows to be an empty clay pot, very similar to the new one, back to the door. They leave it there and return to camp.
Dean sighed, fisting the sheet below with a quiet whimper into the darkness.
Cas’s shout of his name echoes right after him, but Dean doesn’t look back.
no matter how you look at it. You don’t just make yourself the only known
Castiel stands up and stretches his back and wings briefly before hopping down from his roost.
“You will not hurt them. Yes you’ve said that before, and look where we are now!” The witch’s command grew stronger, Dean could feel it weighing heavy on his conscious, making him dizzy. After a battle of wills, fought too quickly for Dean to even register, Cas fell to his knees. Sam grabbed Dean’s shoulder to keep him from moving towards him. “Cas!” he called. The angel held up his hand.
Curious, Castiel presses one of the buttons along the side of his PADD to bring up a little square at the top right corner, and he quickly writes down a reminder to himself to look into what 1-F-1's role within the enclosure’s tribe is. When done, he taps the button again and the square goes away, but a notification remains in the margins of the PADD indicating that he has made a note worth following up on. He is certain that someone, somewhere, has written a report on the decision as to why 1-F-1 was selected for the recording. While she is the first female for the Alpha Sector enclosure, there were already males in the enclosure before her collection.

“Hm.” He stared up at the ceiling. “Mary, what should we do?”
A knock startled him. He opened the door and Gabe stood on the deck, a costume captains’ hat on his head. “I thought you hated this thing?” He kicked the edge of the doorway.
He zoned out their trip back to the apartment and fell into bed displaced. Maybe there was more to Castiel Novak than he thought.
“I’m,” He cleared his throat, “I’m not coming in.” He turned his head and coughed. “I don’t feel good, so I’m taking a sick day. I’m sorry for the late call and the inconvenience, but I just woke up.”

“I never said you were stuffy.” She turned around and glanced towards the living room. “When will Jack wake up?”
Dean laughed. “So maybe we were both nerds. How’s Cali? Still sunny and all that?”
“Of course it was.”
There’s really no excuse for why I didn’t show up last night. I saw you through the window and panicked. I couldn’t tell you I was the person you were looking for, especially when I know you don’t like me.
“Not for a bit. I don’t want to break our lease, but Dorothy and I are going to be looking at apartments soon. She wants to get out of her shoebox ASAP.”
“I dunno. You guys have been doing it for years now and I’d hate to butt in.” Dean took his mug back and chugged it down. “Plus, I’d be the only dude. Would that be weird?”
“Oh honey, all you had to do was ask and we could talk it out.” Pixelated music came from April’s purse slumped next to the couch. She reached down to picked it up. “Shit, it’s work. I should probably go. Call me when you get to the office.” She dashed out the door leaving Castiel with a cooling cup of coffee and an uneasy feeling. He sighed and left his coffee on the counter. He needed to get on with his day.
Castiel pulled his groceries closer to his chest. “Dean, I’m not apologizing for my success. It’s business, not personal.”
That was cryptic. He picked up his book and balanced his plate on his lap. Tonight was a disappointment, at least for his social life. Where was NYC418?

Cas pawed around the countertop for the box cutter. It had to be somewhere. His fingers brushed against metal and it skittered across the counter top. There it was. He pulled it down and opened up two more boxes. Bath supplies and more books. He sighed. He knew he should have labeled them, but he didn’t have a Sharpie and now he was never going to find his kitchenware. Good thing pizza comes in a box and can be eaten with your hands.

Castiel rolled over and glared at his clock. 8:47. He had a meeting in less than fifteen minutes and the fact Meg had not called him should clue him in to his out of place morning sloth like attitude. If he rushed, he would be reasonably late. He shuffled farther under the covers. He should be there for the meeting. It was the first time everyone would get together to go over the numbers of the superstore’s first month of business. He should be proud. He should feel accomplished.

His father clapped his shoulder. “Now, now, aren’t some of them already closed down or sold? Already scaring them off before you open. That’ll weed out the weak.” He chuckled.

Ha, I don’t think I’ve got any stories like that. What do you even know about the mating habits of cats? I think I’ll just do what I do every year and get wasted. Not a great plan, but works strong after all of these years. Honestly, my friends and family aren’t that bad. They’re just looking out for me. My roommate can be the worst of them, but she’ll protect me from the worst of them too. It just sucks because this year, I really wish I did have someone. This year has been such a mixed bag. I’ve got great friends and family that’ve let me lean on them, but things are different when you're in a relationship. You can be vulnerable in a different way, you know. Maybe I’m getting older and more wistful (who would’ve thought I’d ever use that word), but I’d be nice. Maybe once the new year starts I’ll look into finding someone. God, I’ll be going in with the rest of them. Better to try then give up, right?

He puttered around, humming as he opened shop. Soon, frazzled parents with young children would come in looking for anything to keep their little readers busy and distracted.

“Meg,” he gripped her shoulder and pulled her to the side. “You can’t say things like that out loud. And besides, we don’t know anything personal about each other. How could I engage in “cybersex” if I know nothing of consequence about him.”
“Hey, it’s too early in the morning to talk about heavy shit. We’re starting a new campaign. Think you want in?”
He watched her before he deposited the glass in the sink. He entered his bedroom where Honey dashed around his legs. “Not right now, sweetheart. It’s been a long night.” He pulled out his suitcase and threw whatever he thought he might need inside. He couldn’t stay here. It might be his, but it would forever be tainted by the time he spent dragging April around in a loveless relationship. He’d need to put it up on the market.
He scoffed. “I was not eyeing them.”
“You could always see if any of the libraries are hiring. I hear you make a great storyteller.”
He crossed his arms. “I’m not saying yes, but I’ll think about it.”
Damn, that’s a downer. But, you’re better now (right?) and that’s what matters. Sucks the sales associate thought you were only in for your wife. There’s a little yarn shop not too far from where I live and at this point they all know me. And they’ve been super patient with my questions. Who knows, maybe you’ll warm up to them in no time.
The waitress returns with their drinks and gets their orders. Cas tilted his head and grabbed two sugar packets. “It depends. How well do you work with other people?”
The glass on the store’s door rattled. Dean pushed away from the counter and peeked through the door: Pamela Barnes. “Pam, what the hell are you doing out here. Freezing your ass off for fun?”
She shrugged. “Suit yourself. How’s your internet beau? Try cybersex yet?”
“How do you know I’m joking? You don’t know what I do in my off time.”
“Don’t get me wrong. I don’t mind sweet pies, I just prefer them in their season. Coconut Cream is a summer pie.”
Bobby leaned over the couch. “You tell Sam yet?”
“Do you need a Kleenex? You keep sniffling.”
“Yes, at least I think so. If it was only snark, I’d keep it around, but withering, condescending nastiness is not snark.”
She made a face. “I’m almost ten, Castiel. I know things.”
“Thanks, Dean.”
“I know. I know.” Dean wobbled up a smile. “And they’re pretty cool.” Another deep breath. “I’m gonna be okay. You know, they live in my neighborhood. There’s a chance I’ve seen them before. Imagine that, I’m at Starbucks or walking down the street and when I meet up with them I’ll realize I’ve already met them. God, I hope I wasn’t a dick.”
He leaned closer. “I’m not going to say I understand, because I can’t — at least not fully, but I at least understand that hollow “I’m sorry’s” aren’t going to help you. And probably nothing I say right now will help while you still hurt.”

Meg snorted. “Maybe not so much for those locals, but for the customers, sure. Cheap books and coffee make money.”
“Ugh, stop. You’re too sappy.”
ImpalaGuy: Dork
“Are you going to eat all night?” Charlie slipped her arm around his and snatched a pig in a blanket from his plate. “You’ve got to at least talk to someone. We can make the circuit then get you out of here.”
The alpha eyes the kid and steps forward.
NYC418: why do people thikn your lonely if your not fucking someone
He opened the chat and started.
“Really?”
“You sure?”
“The best thing we’ve probably ever done is include coffee. Books are great and all, but it can’t beat a good cup of coffee.” Meg stepped close to walk amongst the marks for the tables, the built in bar, and the secluded space where the comfy armchairs and couches would go. “I’m telling ya, this is what’s going to put us over the top in this area. Sure the little local places have charm, but we’re inviting people in, to stay awhile, catch up with a friend or a book. Get lost. Can’t do that in a tiny bookstore.”
Two pizzas, an order of cheese sticks, and one and a half movies later, Charlie snored from the couch. The TV flickered blue light across her face and she frowned in her sleep. He tucked the blanket around her and picked the phone off its cradle. He stepped into his room and dialed. One ring, two rings, three rings, “Hello?”
He grinned. “Bye.”
NYC418: I’ll take the long pause as a no.
He gripped Honey’s collar. “Hey Cas.”
“So I say this as someone who loves you.”
If Castiel had his way he’d run through a nature walk or through a park, not in an overcrowded and sweaty gym. Unfortunately, Meg told him if he wanted her as moral support she would only run in a gym. Still, the beat against the treadmill beat out the circling worries. The Shop Around the Corner turned out to be a splinter under his skin he hadn’t plucked out yet. And if anyone thought he’d let Dean Winchester get away with it, they’d be wrong.
“I will, have a good night.”
I love New York in the fall. There’s just something about it that makes me nostalgic for school supply lists, apple cider doughnuts, and new pencils. I was walking Honey the other day and I stood in front of a stationary store for ten minutes pining for my undergrad years when stepping on campus for the first time after summer break was a breath of fresh air. The books, the notes, the time idled away holed in an obscure section of the library even the librarians had long forgotten about. And then I remembered the stress and endless bowls of macaroni and cheese and I was ever more grateful for the chicken parmesan I had the night before. I must confess I stopped back into the stationary store on my way home from work and bought a pack of No. 2 pencils, for nostalgia’s sake. Embarrassingly more than I have ever paid for pencils, but it was worth it.
Castiel opened his desk drawer and pulled out a stack of take out menus. “I never know when I’ll be here or not. It seemed best not to let the food go to waste.”
They opened the window and crawled out onto the fire escape. The snow flurries swirled and stung his cheeks. Too cold to be out for long, but he hoped it wouldn’t be a long conversation. “How’s Cali? I’m surprised you didn’t bring Jess with you.”
“That’s nice, April.” He gripped her arm and waist to help guide her into his apartment on her tall heels. He should have sent her back to her apartment, but he knew she would sigh, say she was okay sleeping alone, and sulk. Another point where he conceded to her frustrations instead of his comfort. Add it to the long list of ‘Reasons Castiel Has Let This Relationship Go on For too Long, Resulting in Harm to Both Participants’.

Cas resoundly ignores her in favor of watching Dean explain the movie he watched with Sam last weekend.
He watched Meg approach the cafe window and peek inside. “I don’t see him yet.”
ImpalaGuy: that song hmmmHHMMMmhhhmmmHHMMMMMhmmHHHmmm
Ugh, I feel like I’m about to make a bad decision, but I can’t really go into the details because it breaks our no family, no names, no jobs clause.
NYC418: How do you start
“One, it’s cold. Two, coconut is a summer flavor. I don’t make the arbitrary food rules, I just follow them.” He took another bite of his apricot pie. “Goddamn this is good.”
Dean put the mini pigs in a blanket on his plate. And some of the turkey. Was that caviar?
“That would never make it across the coast. It’d totally stay local.”
“I could’ve already been infected on my way here.” He stepped in and walked through to the living room. “You have a lovely place.”
ImpalaGuy: Sure thing. But how will I know who you are amongst all the other guys with golden retrievers?
Subject: Self-Care
the other day and it occurred to me we've never talked about movies. It's a massive portion of my life, but I’ve never brought it up.
Dean blinks. "Yeah—sure buddy."
“I think it’s more of a me thing than a general depression/anxiety thing. Or maybe it is a depression/anxiety thing and I can’t tell anymore.”
Charlie glanced down at her watch. “Holy Batman, you were out late. Everything okay down there?”

Sam laughed and squeezed his large frame through the window. A blast of warm air washed over him and he heard laughter from the living room. He stopped by the kitchen to grab a beer and joined the group in the living room. A round of charades had sprouted while they were gone and Charlie was miming out — something.
They leave the back and there’s Dean twirling Charlie around behind the counter.
back behind the counter. It was always crowded after story time, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. The kids loved it, he loved it, and if it helped boost sales why not? He loved listening to his mom read to him as a kid. A small tug on the back of his shirt. He turned around and there was a girl. “Hello, how can I help you?”
Claire furrowed her eyebrows. “There’s games, and food, and stuff. Nanny Tess talked about it.”
“Well, I’m pretty sure you’ve only been a dick to me, so you don’t have much to worry about. And you haven’t done it since, so I’d say the you I’ve gotten to know the last couple of months is a better reflection of you. I like the real you.”
“Is it because I’m ugly?”
“Then what are you?”
She leaned up to kiss him and he pushed her away. “Please, I’m not feeling well and I’d appreciate it if you left. You made us a wonderful meal, but I can’t — I’ll call you in the morning.” He kept his head bowed towards the floor as he listened to her storm around the apartment. The water in the kitchen rushed as she no doubt wiped away the evidence of her seduction. Light thuds as she redressed and crammed into her heels. She thudded towards the door and left with a slam. Why couldn’t he do it?
ImpalaGuy: thanks
Cas cups Dean’s face in his hands. “Never.”
“Jesus, you need a spine. Your personal relationships just go down the crapper.”
NYC418: Everyone copes at different times and in different ways. Would you look down on someone who needs pain meds after a surgery?
Heavy rain splashes against the large front windows of the laundromat. Cas is behind the counter flipping through an Alpha Weekly left behind by a patron. Dean’s wedged on the window ledge patching a sweater for Claire, one of the regulars.
Charlie rolled closer to the couch edge. “It’s September.”
He ducked his head down. “You’re gonna laugh.”
“Hey, we’ll work something out to get you and Dorothy together sooner. You practically live over there now. Will you even need to move anything?”
“Ugh, mood killer.” Krissy tickled him with the end of the tinsel garland.
The mom and sales associate walked towards another bookshelf and left Dean alone. He wouldn’t get to do that anymore. Sometimes it was frustrating, especially when the parents swore on their lives hand to God they were right. But everything was worth it to see the kids get excited about reading. And they still would here, hopefully.
on his shelves. It was always different with kids.
He blinked. “No, you’re not ugly.”
“Hire them, Jesus, what kind of person do you think I am?” He scraped the decorative caviar off the edges of the plate and dripped it onto his plate.
Dean’s squared off in front of a tall alpha man, a high school-aged boy is off to the side holding a younger kid. The stench of alpha in near rut is putrid. “Get out of here, this is a place of goddamn business.”
“Well, what would you rather do?”
Cas nods. He does. It's how he's ended up here in Palo Alto and the laundry mat. Heretical betas and all that. Freedom was a mattress on the floor of an apartment shared with three other betas and an alpha couple.
“He’s human! Take it easy and if you need to call out again tomorrow, do it. I’ll e-mail you the notes and we can get together to go over it. If any of the other execs want to see you they can schedule their own damn meeting. I’m not the secretary and I’ll put my foot down on that.”
“Okay, that’s enough touchy feely stuff. We should probably go see if lover boy is in there.”
Meg and Gabe shared a look. “Sure, bro. Whatever helps you sleep at night.” He slid his beer across the island and picked up a box. He lightly tossed it and a muffled jumble came out. “I think this might be bathroom.” He skipped out of the room leaving Meg with Cas.
“You keep meeting him for cute lunch dates and whatnot. What’s a girl supposed to think?”
He turned towards Kevin. “Is this what both of you think or just her?”
“See, there you go again.” She smiled wide and refilled her barely empty glass.
I'm embarrassed to admit I've only seen the first
“Steve.”
He rolled his eyes, dropped his slice, and pulled the top box off Gabriel’s stack. “It’s part of the business.”
Honey has been particularly ornery the last two days. I have no idea what has gotten into her, but she refuses to settle down. Running this way and that way across the apartment and pushing throw pillows off the couch. I caught her opening the cabinet doors and trying to rip open her dog food bag! She’s calmed down now, but I have no idea what put a bee in her bonnet. The downside is there’s Golden Retriever fur all over my apartment and I think she hid my slippers. But I love her all the same.
He swirled his straw. “I do want to. There’s a lot of pressure to meet my parents expectations. I don’t think I mature past childhood in that department. I just didn’t realize I was such an assbut about it.”
Dean swallowed. “Yeah, I do.” He put the last book in the bag and glanced up at the register’s screen. “Fifty-seven twenty-three.”
“It’s looking like it. We might even be able to open the last week in September. Cross our fingers.” He passed her a thin packet of construction notes. “My parents more than likely will want their own private tour before the investors, so we’ll need to make sure to notify them on time or they’ll have the month booked solid and “can’t possibly squeeze me in right now.”.
It felt special.
“I’m not sure that should be my approach, but if it solves some of my problems, I can take some comfort in it.”

“I didn’t realize. I thought I was too soft.”

“You’re terrible.”
“Not the point. Let’s go see. Show us Krissy.” Dean pushed his way through his employees and back out onto the street. They followed her and it was too soon for his liking that the looming building facade emblazoned in red appeared: COMING SOON: MILTON BOOKS.
NYC418: Honestly, I’d rather have sleep at this point
“Hey, no ‘Dad.’ You’ll give me greys before I’m thirty.” Dean runs his hands through his hair.
He stepped into the grocery store and calmed. Paper turkeys hung from the ceiling and hurried customers sped past. So close to Thanksgiving, it’s a wonder he had not been shoved where he stood. He grabbed a basket and walked close to the edges. Mothers strode past, kids trailed behind or shrieked from the children’s seat.
“Oh, I’m

I might have been too eager saying I loved New York in the fall. I do, but I think the holiday season is just as good (dare I say better). Perhaps, because it feels like we culturally put on rose colored glasses and put aside differences for about two months before tearing into each other again. That’s cynical and probably most directly influenced by my family, but the air of coziness and camradire the holidays bring about is entirely worth it. It’s also the only time of the year any home cooked meal makes its way into my home. I can’t say I’m the cook — and my baking is worse — but after takeout and restaurants the rest of the year, it’s nice to stay in and eat. Currently, my fridge has last night’s Thai and ketchup. Honey, however, is content the entire year until the holidays. Too much stimulation probably, but she’s a hyperactive mess. I love her dearly, but barking at four in the morning is terrible.
“I don’t know what to do. I broke up with April and I thought that would get rid of my problems, but it didn’t.”
ImpalaGuy: By the way, I did take your advice. I think it’s working so far.
“It’s a valid question. You two where hissing at each other like cats up until you announced the store was closing. What am I supposed to make out of you guys hanging out?”
Now he sat on the floor, the last of the items that needed to be packed around him. The radio dim in the background. The bookshelves would be picked up and hauled off to another store. Bobby promised to come by the next day to help him transfer the store sign to his apartment.
Castiel sat down at the table. April brush her hand over his arm. Mother and father beamed from the end of the table. Gabriel shook his head.
“Okay.”
It irritated him. For years, he saw no hide or hair of him. To be fair, he hadn’t become a permanent fixture until eighteen months ago as the store conceptualization began. Now he couldn’t go three days without seeing the man sometime while he was out and about. He wanted to hide in his office or his apartment to avoid him.
“Cousin or gal pal, are those really my options.”
“But is it at target with this time in the past?”
-o-O-o-
The boat was one of the most awkward things Castiel had the displeasure of owning. After his graduation, his parents decided a big splashy gift was in order and bought him a boat to sit at the docks next to the family boat. He rarely went out on it, but the kids loved it and he would do anything for them.
“Double-standards are a bitch.”

“I was being rhetorical, but if you need me to, I will.”
She rolled her eyes. “Let me go check.”
He hummed and cocked his head. “Sure.”
“I’m glad you it was you, too.” Cas tipped up face down and hovered his lips over Dean’s. “Is this okay?”
ImpalaGuy
Dean fidgets. “Yeah.”
He flashed the cover of his book out towards the cafe floor. Maybe NYC418 couldn’t see it and didn’t want to come up to him in fear he would be the wrong person. Just another lonely person taking solace in a cafe where you could be around people without interacting with them. Maybe he got caught up in something and was late. He should have taken Charlie’s offer for her to accompany him. She worried that he’d get mugged or murdered. Fair, he only had months and months of conversations to backup the kind of person he thought NYC418 was. But he didn’t want his pseudo sister to crash his date, but she would’ve been good company. (God date, it wasn’t a date it was two internet people who had sex meeting up in real life.) He almost conceded that he’d let her come if she sat out of the way, but decided it would be too much hassle. He did agree he would check in with her so she knew everything was okay, or consequently wrong.
She held her arm out. “No, wait, there — oh shit.”

“So what is this party about?”
ImpalaGuy: You okay?
“Uh-huh. She learns how to use magic and fight and she’s always got Kazul by her side. They’re pretty great. I always keep a couple in stock so I can share them. Isn’t that the best part about reading? Getting to share the stories with others?”
Dean, I’m sorry I stood you up. There’s a lot about me that I’m coming to terms with and it’s hard to accept a lot of myself. However, you’re human too and have feelings. They’re probably hurt right now. I can’t take that back, but I can work towards repairing the bridge
ImpalaGuy
“Yes, please.” She cradled them to her chest.
“I don’t really know you from Adam, so it’s not like there’s a whole lot of people I can spill your secrets to.” What good would Castiel’s secret be if he didn’t know anyone in his circle? And it wasn’t like the secret would be something terrible like insider trading or other shady white collar shit.
“Understood. Please don’t ostracize yourself from the others. I need this company to function.”
“What?”
“We could be just a couple of guys hanging out. Not everything has to have an ulterior motive.”
Dean laughed and pulled a treat out of his pocket. “She does. I hope you don’t mind.”
The door squeaks open and Dean pushes his way through—basket in hand and Walkman at his side in his pocket. He rocks his head and drums a heavy beat against the thick, plastic basket handles. "Hey Cas."
“Yeah, I wouldn’t have gone to that with you.”
The barista called their names and Meg handed him his drink. Lots of chocolate. And peanut butter. “Well, you knew my parents have never been exactly warm.”

ImpalaGuy: mm, yeah, better than what i was doing
“Okay, put what’s the problem. Is here there with someone?”
Okay, from anyone else Dean could accept that. But this was the guy who was currently pushing him towards closure. He snorted. “Yeah, I don’t think you’re gonna close your store any time soon. Thanks, but no thanks.”
“Don’t be so fucking obtuse. Do I need to make the appointment and drive you there?”
“You’re ungrateful.” Cas shakes his sweatshirt sleeves. He should be used to the jokes that come out of Claire’s mouth, but he thinks it’s worse since Dean decided he should be able to one up her.
“Um.” It wasn’t his place, but it would at least solve the mom’s problem. “I think the book you’re looking for is
He ruffled her hair. “Yeah, yeah. Love you too, kiddo.”
The dining room was warm, candles lit, table heavy. Jack grabbed the edge of his blazer. “I got the wishbone!”
“With Cas, I don’t know if he’d be into that. Obviously we must be at least okay friends, but he’s a big business guy. Even if he was queer, it’s not like he could announce it to the world without the stock dropping.”
“Ugh.” He dropped his head against the cool window. It had been two weeks since their New Year’s tryst. He was never going to let Meg and Gabe take him out again. Was this even a good idea? He was still involved with April, right?. He shouldn’t even be here. This was too much, too soon. He should have never even agreed to have sex in the first place. Even if things went well today,
He angled his water glass towards him. “I’m teasing you. I know you’re just nervous. It’s okay, you’ll do fine.”
Sam sat down in the armchair and stabbed at his cake. “Where’s Dorothy?”
He nudged her back onto her feet and walked off to begin observation. “I’m sure the piano that almost fell on you also feels like it’s had a terrible day, however, we are paid to get this store up and running, not falling over in our Milanos.”

Dean slung his arms around Sam and Charlie. God were they close to wasted, but this was his family — red-faced and smiling. If it wasn’t tradition, none of them would remember the words, but they stumbled through the clarinet and Charlie belted out the horn line before they chased into the round. They clapped when they finished and Krissy and Kevin switched to carols. A bit off beat and tune, but still recognizable. For the most part. He needed to leave before anyone started singing. He pulled on his beer and tapped Sam’s shoulder. “Can I talk with you?”
A loud bang on the door. Krissy rushed from the counter. “I’m coming, Christ on a cracker.” She opened the door and Bobby lurched in, a small tree in tow. “It’s so small.”
Sam beamed. “Sure.”
Sam fidgeted and tapped his beer against the railing. “We broke up.”

I don’t have a good excuse, nor one I can give you. Understand that it’s no reflection on you, but me. I wish I had been there with you. Difficult people can be hard to deal with, but that’s the problem with witty comebacks: they often hurt the inflictor more than the target. At least in the case when I do it and now, when you do it.

He sat up and tumbled out of bed. He grasped for his home phone and dialed Meg’s cell. One ring, two rings, three rings, four rings. “Where the hell are you? Everyone is in there wondering where the hell Mr. Punctual is. Please tell me you’re on your way.”
“Normally you don’t call this late is all.”
Meg peeled a mushroom off her slice. “Not even with Dean?”
Castiel shifted from foot to foot. He was over thirty for Christ’s sake, but his parents still treated him has a kid. A pat on the head for a job well done before a dismissal so the adults could talk.  He was glad his parents wanted the private tour or they would have made him a fool in front of the investors. In front of anyone but his parents he was well versed, strong, and a leader. With his parents he was still the fourteen year old boy sniffling through their lecture because he received a ‘B’ on an essay. “Mother, Father. Don’t you have meeting at lunch?”
She clapped his back. “Atta boy. Let me go order the pizza and you find the VHS tapes.”
“April is fine. I will decide my relationship with her, not you.”
“I can’t tell you or it won’t come true.”
“We’ll just have to wait and see.”
Krissy raised her eyebrow. “Brouhaha?”
ImpalaGuy: cybersex
“Yes, her eldest, Dean. I’ve seen him flit around the circles with that redhead, Celeste isn’t it? Doesn’t like to socialize a lot, but he seems to have friends in some high places.” His mother raised on eyebrow. “Such a shame Mary died so young. Could have done a lot more than that little shop. I had her picked to head a new section in children’s publishing. She knew her stuff.”
“Fuck off man, he said no.”
“What’s holding you back? We’ve been together for almost a year. Every other boyfriend I’ve had would’ve already had sex with me. I’ve got needs, Castiel, and you’re not fulfilling them.”
“Spying on your,” he furrowed his brows. “No, I was just having a nice day out with Claire and Jack.” Castiel glared at him and snatched the spoon.
It is dinnertime by the time Castiel leaves the library, now armed with knowledge on the objective indicators of attractiveness for humans. He understands that such standards change throughout the ages, and in his research, Castiel was careful to corroborate what he read with images of seemingly popular individuals he found on the internet.
“You have me, Dean. You always had, and you always will. My grace will be with you.”
, it’s just – Dean, I’m still getting used to being human: learning human customs, understanding human standards – I’ve been in a human body all this time you’ve known me, but I’ve never got the chance to stop and immerse myself, even when I did lose my grace all those years ago. You could say that I’m approaching this from more of an… academic perspective.”
Castiel feels Dean tense up as he sets the cup down. Dean buries his face in his hands and gives it a vigorous rub. When he looks up again, there are tears in his eyes.
“Do you mean here, or out there?”
“Hmm?”
Once again, Castiel finds himself at the mercy of another habit he has to get used to as a human. As an angel, he was always able to complete the task at hand with laser-sharp focus. Now, he barely makes it through one paragraph of this novel he is trying to read (
“You’re still having those nightmares, aren’t you?” Dean asks as he looks on with concern. “You know, if it helps, you don’t have to sleep alone. We could move your bed into my room so you know there’s someone else with you.”
Castiel gives him a look and his expression reshuffles to one of faint recollection.
“I couldn’t fall asleep, so I figured I’d spend some time looking at myself in the mirror.”
“I know this is strange for you, Dean; but it is strange for me as well,” Castiel explains, hoping to make sense of it, not just for Dean, but for himself as well. “I have memories of my life before meeting you: childhood, high school; yet – for some reason I’ve always known that I
“Sam,” Castiel says. “I need you to leave, please.”
“Okay, fine. I
“Wait – did you say Cas?”
“Of course you mean that!” Dean bursts out. “Of course you’re likening yourself to a fish!”
can change for the better.
“You – ” Dean chokes. He feels unreal, light, and he reaches for the nearest surface to cling to; something
“Speaking of Rowena, Sam,” interrupts Dean. “I wonder what she’s up to ruling Hell. We should probably ask her to drop by some time, don’t you think? Eileen, you remember her?”
“The name ‘Vega’ is loosely drawn from the Arabic word for ‘falling’. You could say it’s a foreshadowing of sorts about 450 million years in the making,” Castiel says with a shrug. Dean decides to ask the question which has been weighing on his mind all this time.
“So… I’m attractive? You think so?”
“I will try,” Dean says as he settles beside Castiel. “Or die trying.”
Dean feels white-hot needles prickling at his eyes, tears pooling and threatening to spill over. He closes his eyes and allows them to do so just as Castiel reaches out and grabs Dean’s arms. It is steadying; real. He opens his eyes, only to see Castiel looking at him with a strange mixture of emotions: grief, melancholy, joy, peace. Dean forces himself to speak, if only to break the silence and because he knows Castiel is expecting something, and this time, Dean has to provide.
“Dean?” Castiel repeats as he gives Dean a light nudge. Dean snaps out of it and takes a second to compose himself. He pulls Castiel into a hug, taking the opportunity to warm himself.
Castiel sticks the pole into the holder and reaches for his Thermos. Dean stares.
Dean crumbles.
Dean watches Sam’s jaw set, lips pursing, though he is not sure why. Perhaps Sam had an argument with Jess? In any case, it is not something for him to probe into at this juncture.
“Dean. When I came to – visit? You? With the dream root. You weren’t yourself.”
“Hey, Dean. How are you?”
Castiel gives a wry smile at this and nods, recalling the moment when Rowena dropped that compliment over the phone. He was definitely flustered but there were matters of greater importance then. Now, things are different. He can indulge in such trivial pursuits and ruminations, so he decides to push further. He notices that Dean has been quiet and staring at his chicken.
That stops Sam in his tracks, and Castiel could almost see the cogs turning in Sam’s head as he figures out his next move. Sam’s face turns to one of despair and he gives Castiel one of his looks, the one which says “
“Dean, you’re overreacting,” Castiel responds with a frown as he sets his cup down. “I don’t mean that – ”
Dean returns his gaze.
fishing?”
? How?”
Dean continues to stand at the cup of tea as steam rises from its surface and disappears into the air. Castiel continues to look at Dean, even if Dean refuses to.
“What? Why?” he replies, a little too fast for Dean’s liking. Dean’s pulse quickens, his breath shallows.
They sit atop the frozen lake on their little stools with fishing poles in hand. Granted, it is a cold day, but the wind is weak and the sun is strong, making it a rather pleasant experience.
(they agreed it flows off the tongue better than
“We haven’t done this before, Cas; thought it’d be nice to try something new rather than nesting the winter away like we did last year in Lawrence. Not that Lawrence had any ice fishing opportunities, anyway.”
“Hey, Cas. Are you up to anything?”
“Are you high?”
“Am I attractive?”
Castiel grins and he lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder – that shoulder. Dean looks at it.
“We’re going to get Cas from the Empty,” Dean declares. And just like that, the plan is put out there. Sam stares at Dean, incredulous, and Dean smirks. He knows he needs to rest, and he shall for now. For now, he will live as Castiel asked him to – to reconnect with the people around him and to live with hope. Because now, he has hope. Soon, the planning will begin.
The Empty is hard to describe. It is as much a place as it is just an idea: can a place with an absence of

“Come on, Sammy. Where were we the last time we met?”
"What I can promise is that I promise to find you, one way or another."
“So, what – you’re
With a hunter’s practised precision, the blade plunges.
Dean pulls back and sees that Castiel is crying too. He brings one of his hands up to wipe the tears off of his beloved’s face and musters a watery smile.
“But what is it specifically? I’ve spent my day reading up about the traits which contemporary humans may find attractive,” says Castiel as he pivots towards Dean. “What do you think, Dean?”
Dean tears himself from the hug and wipes his tears away before reaching for the angel blade on the floor beside them. He brings it up, blade pointed to his chest and notices that he is shaking. He closes his eyes, takes a few calming breaths, and looks to Castiel who has placed his hands on Dean’s knees to maintain some sort of touch.
“Why are you so concerned with how you look?”
“Yeah, about that,” Sam squints at the memory. “Angel flight while you’re aware isn’t pleasant, in a dream or not. But, the thing is – Cas told me he would help you out of the dream, so I’m guessing… he did?”
“Figure it out, Dean. I can’t help you if you want to be cagey about it.”
"Dean - that's not -"
“Damn, Cas. Sam and Eileen already said you’re attractive. What else can I add? You are attractive, alright?” Dean says.
“Yeah, what do you think, Dean?” Sam echoes with a grin. Eileen punches Sam in the arm.
“Because – ”
“No, Cas,” Dean says with the slightest grin. “See you later.”
And with that, Dean understands. Dean accepts. Dean resolves. Guard down.
“Let’s just go, Dean.”
“It’s – it’s nothin’, Cas,” Dean says as his fit of giggles dies down. He takes a few deep breaths to calm himself down, palms his eyes in an attempt to hide the tears, and faces Castiel again.
For a moment, Dean sees a flash of fear in Castiel's eyes as his body tenses. He immediately wraps himself around Castiel. The black goo is immaterial, both there and not-there between Dean and Castiel.
Dean chokes at this as if he just got punched in the gut. This is all Castiel has: to be someone apportioned in Dean’s mind, both existing as a self yet inexplicably reliant on Dean simply for existence.
Sam looks back, puzzled. Dean straightens himself up in his bed and clears his throat. He pours himself another glass of water and drains it. Sam notices energy in Dean's eyes – something he has not seen in a while.
Dean rolls his eyes and climbs out of bed as he mumbles something about how he cooks every day anyway. He grabs the bathrobe which was hastily thrown over the chair in the corner of the room last night heads to the kitchen. He takes a moment to appreciate the apartment as he steps out – it is a cosy nook situated in downtown Minneapolis. Dean and Castiel got married last year after dating for a decade, but not before they could agree on whose family name to pick and it was only settled after a compromise of
Castiel pulls him into a hug as he lets out a sob which racks his entire body, raising goosebumps and making his face flush red-hot. He pushes his face, tears now streaming in earnest down his face, into Castiel’s shoulder. He clings on, not wanting to let go, and he remembers:
Wet. Messy. Real. He grins.
“I know. Just give us awhile more, please?”
“No.”
? How are you using your angel mojo?” Dean asks as Castiel passes the steaming cup of tea to him. Dean sets the cup onto the table without taking a sip and stares at it, hard. Castiel settles beside him and tries to draw Dean’s gaze to him.
want to know of. He feels a rush he hasn’t felt in a while, having become accustomed to predictability and safety, and Castiel looks at Dean with a furtive glance through the corner of his eye. Dean looks on ahead, hands on the steering wheel.
“What were you like?”
Dean lets his arms down and the grin fades away. He takes a step forward, encroaching into the personal space which was designated as something sacred by him a lifetime ago, and Castiel realises very quickly why Dean was so insistent about his personal space. He leans even further into the Impala but has nowhere to move to, so he looks up at Dean with panic flitting across his eyes. The panic does not last, as Dean raises a hand and cups the side of Castiel’s face and Castiel finds himself almost burrowing into it instinctively.
“The wind is picking up. We should probably go before it gets too cold.”
“… we went out on some hikes, remember? Castle Rock, the Elk River. Heck, we even tried to complete the Flint Hills Trail. You don’t remember that?”
Dean reaches in for a peck and leaves a kiss on Castiel's lips for the first time. Maybe the last. He pulls back and Castiel looks at him, dazed.
, Dean thinks. He turns his eyes away from Castiel and stares out of the windscreen. The drive back won’t take long – the lake is only about thirty minutes out of downtown, but he figures he could use a nap. Dean fakes sleeping all the way back to the apartment building with nary a word exchanged between them in the car. When Castiel finally parks the car in the apartment garage, he goes over to Dean’s side and gently shakes him awake. They return to the apartment together, but as soon as Castiel makes sure that Dean is in bed, he retreats to his office.
“But that means I will lose you. Again,” says Dean, his voice small, eyes downcast. Castiel lets go of Dean's hands and raise his to cup Dean's face. He gently raises Dean's face.
Dean smiles, bittersweet, and nods.
“I created that star.”
Castiel’s face hardens and he gives Dean’s face a gentle tap. He reaches to the bedstand, takes the angel blade laying on it, and presses it onto Dean’s chest. The action is done with care to ensure Castiel does not end up killing Dean. After all, to wake up, Dean has to do this himself. Dean looks down at the blade and recalls the last time he had to kill himself in a djinn dream to wake up – 13 years ago, even before Castiel came into his life. He does not fear this act for he knows that he will not feel the blade going through his chest, ending this life of his. But that does not mean the act will be painless.
“Morning guys.” Sam says, before he makes a beeline towards the coffee machine. Castiel’s hand strokes over Dean’s once more and then starts to make a new toast for Dean. At least their feet are still tangled under the table.
The waters were choppy against the pier, biting against the shoreline in a moody curl. The winds were strong today, and not at all the weather he liked to take off in, but beggars couldn’t be choosers. With the mortgage for Dad’s old house piling up, Dean needed a decent season to get back on his feet, or else.

Dean asks softly, tentatively raising his hand again. The cecalia’s arms ripple a deep purple but he doesn’t flare up again. Dean, unperturbed, swims forward and reaches for the cecaelia’s hand.
Before he even reaches the end of the lesson, Castiel has already decided that he is going to have to keep his feelings on Sapien Sympathizers and
Dean paused a moment, taking a breath and trying to control his spiraling thoughts. “Yeah,” he whispered, “Just… be careful with it.”
. Why do they look almost like him, but have horns, and wings, and the different feet? What else about them is different from him? And why don’t they
Dean felt himself pushed away, pulled back to reality and was surprised to find his forehead rested against Cas’s chest, hands balled into his shirt. Cas’s hand combed through his hair as his breath came in small hiccups, his nose sniffling as the tears stained Cas’s shirt. For a moment they stayed silent, Dean calming and his breathing evening out.
Dean runs into them, crashing through bushes that catch at his clothes. He doesn’t care if they tear. They don’t belong to him. They’re
“Here.” Dean felt Cas’s hand brush his forearm, surprising him. There was a shock, like when skin touches static metal and suddenly Dean was clean. All the annoying dirt in his pores and hair disappeared, making him feel lighter. It wasn’t as satisfying as a warm shower but it was still nice.
Castiel immediately takes the handful of algae and coral he’d gathered and grinds them together in his hands. He gingerly leans over to Sam. “You need to eat this.”
kind of power, but he does. Otherwise, Cas wouldn’t be talking to him right now.
This man has darker skin than anyone Dean has ever seen before. His hair is black as night and curly and tight against his head, and he has jewelry hanging from his ears. He looks surprised, and then a little angry. “A kid?” His voice is deep, and rough, and the words sound just a little bit different again. “Those bastards brought us a

A brush to his
His words are not for how he continues not to listen to her, but rather for what he is about to do next. Castiel knows he will be punished for this later, but he cannot simply stand by and allow a child not much younger than himself, of a species much less developed than his own, be terrorized.
Cas’s face is blank, but Dean can tell that he’s practically vibrating. His wings keep twitching behind his back, and there’s a little bounce in his step. He keeps glancing back at Dean, and the only smile is in his eyes. Every time they make eye contact, Dean makes sure to glare at him. Cas must’ve known that this was coming. Why didn’t he tell Dean when he was in The Alone Room a few days ago after another fight with Dick?
. He sighs heavily through his nose and shoves 1-F-1 aside, and nearly right into Castiel.
He took a sharp breath, “Oh no…”
“But —” Sam looked around in disbelief, “There were families! Children!”
Rufus and Victor are doing their morning comb through of the garden to double check on all the plants, which means Dean doesn’t have to do it. The most he’s going to have to do is help water everything later on in the day, and maybe do a walk-through of his own to see if anything might be ready for harvest. The strawberries were looking pretty ripe the last time he checked on them, so he could do that and the tribe could have jams to eat on the hard hunks of bread that they bake in the ground oven next to the fire pit.
“I-It’s working!” Sam said as the glow subsided gradually, receding further until it was just a pinpoint of light behind his pupils. It grew smaller and smaller until — Dean gasped.
. Why were they... The
Dean held her gaze, eyes never leaving her face, instead focusing on the view in his peripherals. He caught a glint of something in the dirt and slowly lowered a hand from his throat.
The fatigue of running on pure coffee and adrenaline didn’t set in until he’d unloaded his haul for the day and stepped over the threshold of the small, but well-loved home set against a lonely hillside overlooking the sea.  Every time his mind tried to drift back to what he’d seen, his body instinctively put a stop to it. A hard punch of fear bubbled in his gut, and Dean hurried to strip himself of his coveralls and fall onto the threadbare couch. Never in his life had the stale scent of a ten years’ worth of John’s smoking and countless spilled beers on the off-blue couch smelled so comforting.
to offer help to other members of the tribe and make sure that everyone has the supplies that they need.
And he clearly remembers what he had said the last time they’d talked just a few hours before. “You didn’t have to come —”
The kid’s lips thin out again, just slightly, and his eyes narrow. He cocks his head to the side and his wings shift against his back a little bit. Dean has no idea how to interpret any of it. What he wants to think is that the

Dean turned to stand along the cliff edge, eyes roaming the stretch of desert before him, the river winding past the village onward beyond his view. He watched with bated breath as he waited. After a minute, he saw it.

Ellen cups a hand around her mouth and drops her voice into a whisper. “I just spit it back into the cup.”
Dean grabs a low branch thick enough to support his weight. He hauls himself up, and he doesn’t stop, but he also doesn’t look down. With his teeth gritted and his eyes firmly fixed upwards, Dean climbs as high up as he can where he feels confident that she won’t be able to see him from below. He can barely see down, so it’s unlikely that she can see him too.
“But it’s not,” Cas whispered, burying his head in Dean’s shoulder, “I know what she wants, I know what she’ll do… and I know what she wants me to do to you… I don’t want to.”

resonates with anger and disapproval. Castiel focuses to tune her out. His concern lies solely with 1-M-7 currently, and he glides down into the grass to land in the path that was cleared through it. Once he stands amongst it with the grass coming up to his chin, Castiel realizes that 1-M-7 must have been crouching as he made his way towards the trees.
Big comes back from the shelf with something small in his hands that Dean has no idea what it’s supposed to do with his mouth. It’s a long, thin stick like thing, like what Cas sometimes uses on the flat thing he always has, but the end of it has another little round disk on the end of it. Dean rolls his lips between his teeth and keeps his mouth firmly shut.
The way back from Arizona had been easy. Cas had flown Dean down the hill at great insistence, and Dean, too exhausted mentally and physically, didn’t refuse. They’d found Sam and given him the news of their success then flown back to the impala. The joy Dean felt when he saw her safe and sound was indescribable — and so was the joy Dean saw in Cas’s eyes.
Adahy huffed, pulling out a white rock from his pocket, “Like I said, I know more than you think.” Sam stared at the rock curiously. Adahy shrugged, “Talc works just as well as chalk. Now wake your brother, I’ll deal with the wendigo.”
Wait.
As promised, an hour later, small shacks and cabins could be spotted amongst the hills. They were scattered and few according to Cas. The closest sign of habitation was a tall windmill, its height lonely and sharp against the bright sky, sticking up like a crooked finger. It was surprisingly out of place with its dark wood and tattered blades. It spun slowly, pushed by the light breeze on the air.
, and he’ll be able to wait them all out.
Dean looks up at the child. He nods at it, just once, and turns back into the trees.
As the body hits the ground, Dean barely acknowledges it, rushing to Cas’s side where he still lay bleeding on the ground. “Cas!?” Dean’s hands immediately turn him over, the angel propping him up in his lap. The hunter is barely conscious now, his limbs heavy and immoveable and the world he sees vignetted in shadow. “It’s alright, you’re okay now,” Dean presses a hand to the large bleeding bite on Castiel’s neck. Trickling like the droplets of a stream, gold starts to radiate from Dean’s hand. The glow seeps into Cas’s veins, rushing into him with the softness of velvet. Cas feels as the warmth of Dean’s grace weaves through his skin, knitting him back together, soothing like a kiss. He looks up into Dean’s eyes as they glow like small suns, his brows knit together. Maybe it was Cas’s fading mind but he swore the freckles on Dean’s cheeks twinkled like constellations, circling the twin stars of his pupils, a reminder of the ethereal being hiding just beneath the thin veil of skin.

. A smile, perhaps, but never anything like the children below. What must it be like?
Without any warning, the mirror moved, surging forward, water sloshing in the mirror as the form broke free of the glass. Dean jumped away and felt his back hit an invisible barrier. He froze, eyes wide as the wet form moved towards him, the water somehow still swirling around the lower torso of the figure, whose face was now hidden by the surrounding darkness. The figure stopped an inch from Dean’s face. He stared as the dark cleared, and suddenly Cas was there, as he’d always known him. Dark hair, blue soulful eyes, and a face so pure, Dean couldn’t help but stare. He was bare chested, the water still swirling silently around his form, pale and smooth as stone in the white light.
The current specimens within the enclosure are milling about, finding things to keep themselves entertained. A few are swimming in the pool, though Castiel can’t be sure from here if it is to bathe or not. Others are washing their clothing against the rocks lining the pool. Some are weaving on massive looms, using fiber from wool and dyed with materials given to them.
“Hey,” Dean pointed an accusing finger at him, “You better be nice to her or she's not gonna give you a ride home.” Sam chuckled and took a bite of his sandwich.
“But I have my own rules, okay?” Dean nods, trying to keep himself from smiling.

“Morning.” Dean grumbles, when he walks into the kitchen and his eyes widen, when he sees that there is already a nice smelling breakfast on the table. There is even some bacon in the middle of the table.
“You think dad will be mad you took us here?” The small dark haired boy asked.
He drifts his way back to the Gleaming Rock where he and Sam have decided to take refuge. It’s nothing more than a tall shiny stone sticking out of the sand, fallen from the world above, but it’s full of strange and somewhat beautiful objects. Their favorite, though, is the reflection stone. The smooth, clear crystal surface shows a perfect replica of both Sam and Dean whenever they swim in front of it. It was the first time either of them had seen what they really looked like. It made Sam curious about the magic of the people above, but Dean just took what he was given and wondered nothing more.
Of course, that does not mean that disease cannot develop, but it is extremely unlikely given everything involved in the process. If something does happen to develop, the Life Sciences Division has an excellent Functional Biology Department. The hospital is an annex under that department and gives the best care as needed to everyone in the city.
