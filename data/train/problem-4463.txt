Again, the brief piano intro starts, but Taylor wastes no time and begins singing. It’s a beautiful song, really. But that’s Taylor for you. Most of her songs are.
So he trails his tongue along the seam of Cas’s lips, and Cas lets him in. Lets Dean taste his sincerity, his wise words, his loneliness, and his wanting right back. Until there is nothing to hide in the mouth or in the body. They’re sipping at each other. It’s a wet dance, Dean thinks, like the way Cas told him that honeybees communicate with each other. The drinking of nectar.
But Dean just smiles, this real open thing that nearly crumbles Castiel. “The extra is for the honey lesson! Knowledge has value, too, or whatever the hell Plato was goin’ on about. You shouldn't be expected to teach sad sacks like me for free.”
Castiel kisses the shaft again.
It doesn’t take much thought for Dean to follow Cas’s direction. He’s not sure exactly what’s happening, but there’s the sensation of the two of them floating up towards a light above them, looking like the sun shining refracted through water. They’re almost there, Dean can feel it, and they hold on to each other as they breach the surface.
The farmer cranes his neck to peer across Dean to where he’d just pointed, and the man’s eyebrows raise when his gaze settles on Jimmy’s body. “Is your buddy alright?” And, bless his heart, the guy actually sounds worried. Some of Dean’s defense drops.
There’s the body of a person in his way.
Dean’s brow furrows against the words, the way they worm their way in between his ribs to where something soft has been waiting to hear them. “Yeah, o-okay, angel.”
“Are you going to pose for her as well?” Castiel adds curiously.
His weak joke earns him a few hearty chuckles that it probably didn’t deserve, but he’s not complaining.
Sam’s words make Dean’s bottom lip tremble. He grinds his teeth but the burn in the back of his throat won’t seem to get any better. His eyes falter from Sam’s and he looks away, has to look away.
Cas narrows his eyes at him, and his smile has softened but it hasn’t left his face. He’s got that look like he knows Dean is lying but he’s too fond of him to say anything. “If you say so.”
As if Dean couldn’t do it himself, it’s not like he was incapable of leaning up to turn on his bedside lamp. He’d chew Cas out for it if he wasn’t so comfortable… and yeah, maybe a little bit because of the caring way that Cas says it.
“No,” Castiel answers around the food in his mouth. He swallows. “I have memories of hamburgers, but not of eating them. This makes me… very happy.”
“I heard that you and Sam got a dog.”
“I hide how I feel from Dean, I hide how I feel from Anna, from Gabriel. I don’t want them to worry about me more than they already do. I don’t need their worry. Worry fixes nothing. And Dean-” Castiel chokes on the name- “he is my friend. Why can I not be happy? Why is that not enough? Why do I want more and more until I cannot be satisfied? I enjoy his company, but I- I can’t help but wish that he would just touch me.”
“Look at the way you respond to me, Dean.” He has to press a hand down into his lap with how he aches with arousal. He trips on a breathy moan. “I’m touching myself. You can’t see, but right now I’m touching myself.”
“I’m the one who did it.”
“Yes,” Castiel sighs, “it would be appreciated.”
It’s later that night, and all four of the Bunker’s residents have been rounded up for a family dinner. Cas and Eileen are huddled at the little metal table, while Dean and Sam cook. Well, Dean cooks. Sam just roasts his asparagus. They’re all sipping on the Moscow Mules that Eileen had mixed, just a little tipsy before the start of a great meal.
Dean’s eyes dart back and forth between his, flaring up with his eyebrows low in some sort of concern or confusion at whatever is showing on Castiel’s face.
Most certainly, almost terribly, Castiel wants to reach out to him. Wants to touch this soft, glowing Dean that he’s sure only a handful of others get to see. But he won’t. He won’t ruin this with greedy hands. Dean’s company is too wonderful to lose, so he will sit on his own traitorous fingers even as they itch to cradle Dean’s cheek.
“How-” Dean starts.
“Exactly. I have this family; it’s me, Dean- D-E-A-N,” as he spells out the letters, he writes them in a big scrawl across Cas’s skin, from the space between his shoulder blades to the small of his back, “and Sam- S-A-M,” he continues to move his finger along with his spelling, “and Eileen- now this one’s a little longer, so pay attention. Eileen- E-I-L-E-E-N. And last but not least, this nerdy angel named Castiel, but I just call him Cas- C-A-S. I have plenty of other family, too, they just don’t live here with us. But when they visit, you bet I make them my world-famous cinnamon pancakes.”
He frowns. “I think I just developed a heart condition.”
“It’s- Shit, I don’t know how to explain it.” He throws a glance back over his shoulder at Jimmy’s empty shell of a body and thinks about how weird it is that the thing usually animating the body is Castiel. Because Cas has always just… looked like that. But he doesn’t. Cas doesn’t look like that at all. “This is the closest I’ll ever get to knowing what you actually- are. Angel-wise. ‘Cause at the end of the day, you’re not human. And you sure as hell don’t look like Jimmy. You don’t even sound like a dude when you use your real voice.”
“That sounds like fun, but what do you need me for?”
Ella pouts like she’s thinking and says, “I know… I know! My mama said magic people can- sometimes they can be- um- birds.”
That makes Dean laugh and he pulls at the grass more quickly, like he’s excited. The set of his shoulder has fallen into an easier line. “The wings aren’t too bad. A little top-heavy, but they’re also pretty cool. I think they’re cool, anyway.” He smiles and shrugs. “I used to get them out all the time when I was a kid and hit Sam with ‘em.” When Castiel chuckles at the imagery that creates, Dean looks pleased. “Poor Sammy didn’t stand a chance. By the time I was eight they were, like, twice the size of him. I used to just knock him on his ass. God, he’d get so mad. Little did I know at the time that he’d grow up to be Sasquatch and exact his revenge whenever he got a chance.” He rolls his eyes, but it’s all fondness.
So for now, some things are worth keeping private in order to keep them from being ruined. Castiel has nothing to complain about when he has Dean all to himself. But in moments like this he almost selfishly wishes that he didn’t have to hide how much he cares for the man standing across from him.
Oh no. He hadn’t thought this far ahead. And he has a fucking audience. Somebody put him out of his misery.
With an exaggerated huff that probably isn’t all that compelling while Castiel is smiling, he carefully bends to pick up both of their ruined boxers. “Would you like your pants too?”
Dean speaks into a little box, pulls up to the little window, and then suddenly there is a sandwich wrapped in red foil in Castiel’s lap.
But even with the sweat of the confined space and the way Dean is starting to leak, Castiel’s hand is too dry, pulling the sensitive skin in what has to be an uncomfortable manner from what Castiel can guess from his limited experience with masturbating in the shower.
“Hmm, I like undressing you.”
“Cas, this isn’t- I mean-” Dean starts to fidget.
Dean Winchester.
When he looks into the room from the hall. Dean is standing at the stove, which is sizzling and sending tufts of smoke up. Dean’s hair is still wet from his shower. It looks vulnerable against the bare stretch of the back of his neck, where the collar of the robe he’s wearing rides low. Its fabric hugs every point of elevation, mountains and valleys on a single human being. So, so human. So easy to die.
Mr. Davis returns to hand an empty wooden crate over the front presentation shelf he has loaded with produce to Dean, which Dean grabs easily.
“Oh, shit, we gotta change those,” Dean says, and before Cas can protest, Dean is hurrying off and shuffling back with his medical kit. He goes willingly as Dean sits on the bed next to him and digs out disinfectant and bandages.
“It’s true that a Mage needs to obtain most of their energy through plant sources, but there’s no evidence that a purely vegetarian diet increases one’s power. I wasn’t aware that Sam subscribed to that school of thought.”
“I don’t know how much longer I can wait,” Michael breathed. He was all over Dean, surrounding him with his warmth and his scent, pure Alpha in every breath Dean took. “You smell . . . oh, Dean. Your heat is close. I’ll send you something for it.”
“Oh, yes, sir, of course. Your alpha has everything taken care of.”
“Sit. Just ‘cause this one doesn’t have manners doesn’t mean none of us do.”
“Dean should really invest in that bell,” she mutters, scooping broken bits into her hands.
Dean took deep, steadying breaths, noticing Hannah’s bubbly summer scent tinged with the metallic taste of anxiety. He had to get control over himself.
“Says the guy who suggested
It’s true. Charlie had invited him, but that was when he was clinging to his relationship with Lisa, so he’d spent the holiday with her family. It had been an unmitigated disaster; her traditional father hated the fact that a beautiful omega like Lisa was dating another omega like Dean. It hadn’t taken her long to decide she was done with him and move on to her stable, reliable beta mate.
“Very witty,” Gabe said. “Seriously. Cas. What happened?”
The final name was called, and Dean couldn’t breathe. He stared at the handsome alpha that stood at the front of the room, trying desperately to calm himself, to get his pheromones under control. He couldn’t panic in the middle of the room, but this alpha . . . this alpha he knew.
The kid’s eyes nearly fall out of their sockets before they fly back up to Dean’s face. “Oh! He’s, uh, he’s already here. Let me . . . take you to your table?”
. . .”
“Please. Please, Dean . . . omega,
Dean had fought, and now they were here. Their daughter had reached forty weeks gestation on Thursday, so now it was anyone’s guess. Dr. Banes had released the stitch in Dean’s cervix, so he’d been dilated at a low number for a week, but there were no other signs of labor. Dean was convinced he’d worked too hard to keep her in, that now she wouldn’t want to come out. Cas thought she deserved as much time tucked away in her warm sanctuary as she could get.
The envelope lay where he left it, taunting him from his bed.
“Whoa, hey, don’t have a heart attack. Jeez, that school does a number on you guys. Or have you always been so . . . jumpy?”
,” Dean grumbles. “Great, now I’ve gotta babysit the kid.”
“You look well,” Dean says, wincing when Cas glares. “Okay, you look like shit. How have you been?”
The voice caught Cas off guard. He’d somehow wandered to the bench while his mind drifted, and sitting there in a lavender-and-pale blue plaid button-up and a light grey sweater vest was the green eyed omega.
,” Dean groaned, his own come mixing with Cas’s between them. Dean thrust hard once, twice, three more times before final collapsing, panting, half on top of Cas.
hands that destroy you? Pathetic—”
It’s a split second when Castiel realizes what’s going to happen before it does, but then Dean’s hands are in Castiel’s hair and their lips are pressed together and it’s desperate and hard and uncoordinated and
. Making sure their fortress was safe for his mate’s return.
“Yes, I think it will be,” Cas said. Dean grinned.
A moment later, he seemed to realize what he said and Castiel could tell he was on the verge of bolting so he said quickly, “It must have been quite an adjustment, then, to come here and stop suppressing.”
“Classy, Balthazar,” Hannah said while Charlie continued to giggle.
Kevin, Dean’s roommate, had caught up to him. Dean used Kevin’s hand on his back to ground himself, and eventually, after several steadying breaths, Dean didn’t feel like he was going to puke anymore.
Dean was nodding along. It was all the same thing they’d been through five times before. “Yup, all sounds pretty routine.”
- A character uses sexuality and gender as coercion and tools of power. It's skeevy, but nothing physical or graphic. It could make people uncomfortable. (It's the scene with Dean at Adler's office, if you are concerned).
“I think you’ll live,” Dean says, patting Cas’s wrist before pulling away awkwardly. Cas nods sharply.
“Yeah, you said that.”
This was a terrible idea, but Castiel couldn’t deny him anything, especially not when he was so close and so warm, his scent filling Cas up from head to toe. So, Cas nodded.
Gabriel tosses Castiel a pair of jeans from the drawer closest to the door. “That’s the spirit! C’mon, get dressed and put your book away. You’re gonna come meet my friends.”
“Understatement,” Rowena murmurs. She sips delicately at her tea. “What are you doing here? Don’t guardian angels keep watch over their charges?”
When he was done, he toweled off and settled in his room. He tore through his closet, looking for something, anything that hadn’t come from Michael, but he’d gotten rid of all his old clothes once he’d run out of room for new ones. He finally gave up, flinging himself onto his bed, naked, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. Something heavy and warm still circled his wrist. It was the fucking watch, still ticking soberly away, despite its exposure to the hot water.
been taking advantage of the perfect opportunity I provided him,” Balthazar droned.
Brief warning: non-graphic description of a character vomiting (Cas is ill)
“True, true. How are you, anyway?”
“Strip poker!” Gabe exclaims.
“Hey, Ellen,” Dean says, a little sheepish. The woman, Ellen, continues to stare at him for a moment, then goes back about her business behind the bar.
Dean pulled away from Castiel with a small smile, green eyes sparkling in the golden light of the party. “Okay, okay, we’re done,” Dean said, taking a sip of egg nog. Castiel sipped his own; it wasn’t his favorite thing, but given the caliber of the party, the quality of the rum came through. Dean smacked his lips. “Good nog,” he grunted, taking another long drink.
“Okay, okay! Charlie’s the leader of a local omega rights group. I met her through Gilda, her girlfriend, right before the term started.”
Here it is! Thank you all for sticking with me. <3
is? Come on, what self-respecting omega rights attorney would pass that up? But besides that, I’m here for you. I want to support you.”
“Okay, I’ll be straight with you because Gilda thinks I can trust you and I’ve read all of your work and
“Stay over, then,” Dean said, heart in his throat.
Dean tries again. He’s getting air, for sure, but it’s clean. Actually, it isn’t
They finished the video, as they usually did, but for some reason something heavy hung in the air between them. Or maybe it was just Cas’s imagination.
“Nothing,” Dean replies, leaning up to taste the soft skin of Cas’s pulse point. He sucks a mark there, one that will fade quickly because of Cas’s grace, laving it with his tongue and Cas groans.
“Listen, if something was wrong, I’d be the first one to point it out,” Dean grumbles, and then realizes that the statement is completely false. Cas must also be aware because that annoyed
And then there was Cas. Castiel, Angel of Thursday, Warrior of the Lord. One of the many reasons Dean finds himself outside in the cold right now. Cas’s presence in the bunker has been nothing if not welcomed, may be the only reason Dean feels like he can stand upright these days, but the air between them is thick with Cas’s parting words. They still haven’t talked about it.
It’s easy enough, especially because after Dean’s entire recommended page got clogged with ASMR videos, he realized the account Cas was watching all of the videos on was
Cas’s mouth is still right there against Dean’s neck, and he kisses it tenderly again before he continues speaking. “In my dream, you had built a nest for us here, in my living room. It was very big. It took up the entire room and it was constructed from twigs that were many feet long and made of solid gold. But it was soft when you laid down on it. The dream rather implied that that’s where we had sex.”
Dean feels like falling apart. He swallows down the rush of emotions, at the thought of promised touches and planned comfort.
“That’s real good to hear, Cas. I’ll- I’ll be out in a sec.”
More silence, like Dean doesn’t know if Castiel actually wants him to respond or not. When Castiel says nothing else, Dean finally speaks. “What did you want me to do? Turn back into a person, say ‘Hey there! Actually, this spot is occupied, if you could just fuck off that’d be great.’”
“Castiel.”
“Nothing? Fuck, Castiel, we just had to drag your feral ass up the stairs before you broke in and ravaged that omega like something out of a bad porno!”
Castiel clenched his fists at the question. “Yes, I have a penis and a knot, if that’s what you’re asking,” he spat. The nurse typed away blandly.
No, he wasn’t exactly horny. His own orgasm hardly mattered at all. He groaned again as he eased a third finger into himself. His hole fluttered and clenched, searching for a knot.
“Go back to sleep, little alpha,” Dean murmured, grabbing Cas’s hand and inching closer, pressing his belly up against Cas’s flat stomach. Sometimes he felt his daughter kick like this in their sleep.
Castiel’s head was swimming. Everywhere he turned, that scent, the frankly
That was clearly a cue, because behind Adler a screen lit up, a short film reel playing. It had clips of past leaders whose spouses had been famous graduates of Vinehall interspersed with beautiful, sweeping shots of the campus, and a few choice soundbytes provided from students.
Dean clears his throat, settling back against his tree and crossing his arms tight over his chest. He glares at Cas, a challenge. “You gotta know, everything I’m tellin’ you now you take to your grave.”
It had been years since John died and Dean went to work full time. Years of alphas, betas, other omegas passing through. They’d been cautious, Bobby even overprotective. Dean still didn’t know exactly how Michael had found out. But he had, so nothing else really mattered.
“So, Cassie,” Dean starts, noticing the slight wince at the nickname. “What do you do?”
“Did Bruce Willis win?” Cas asked sleepily.
“Hey, Sammy.”
hospitality!”
“Damn, didn’t realize I was so thirsty.”
Something unfamiliar flashes in Cas’s eyes before he narrows them. “I am the Archmage of Lebanon,” he repeats and Dean resists the urge to groan. “If there is something evil threatening the kingdom, I am obligated to act, Dean. You can try to leave me behind, but I promise I will find a way to follow.”
- Dean experiences a post-heat depression (briefly at the end of the chapter)
“Takes one to know one, bitch.”
“Cassie’s fine. He’s mature for his age.”
. The panic from earlier threatens to rise inside him when he thinks about how close he’d been to . . . How easily Dean might not have . . .
Dean was mesmerizing, but in the end the warm, wet sensation of Dean’s talented mouth had Castiel falling back against his pillows, hips writhing beneath him. Dean eased the fingers of one hand back toward his sensitive hole, brushing dryly against it and making Castiel buck up into Dean’s mouth. Dean moaned around Castiel’s cock and Castiel couldn’t help it; he jolted at the shock, one hand burying itself in Dean’s hair, just enough to hold on for dear life.
Dean set his bags down and started unpacking them on autopilot. He’d already put a few things away before he stopped and stared at the bag of prunes in his hand. “Seriously?”
Ice seized Dean’s heart. “What the fuck are you sorry for?” Dean snapped. Cas removed his hand as though he’d been burned.
“I mean, I guess—”
“Are you sure I can handle it?” Cas asks flatly.
He tried not to think about what any of that meant for his future.
A sharp rap on the door startled Dean out of his thoughts, then,
“Mr. Milton,” he said. Michael smiled.
No, Cas isn’t familiar, as the deep gashes hidden under his bandage tell. He scratches at it subconsciously.
It took Cas a while to come back to reality, and by the time he could focus on Dean’s face the sweat and come had started to cool on their bodies. Dean shifted slightly in his lap, making Cas grunt and bite his lip as a secondary orgasm rippled through him. Dean smiled almost shyly.
“You have it very wrong. I am the one who has been selfish. Knowing you’re here,” he placed a hand on his own chest, “has been the warmth in my existence.”
Cas only hums lazily in return as his fingers start to rub circles on Dean’s hips. The circles very quickly divulge into broad petting motions up and down Dean’s sides. It makes Dean squirm a little bit where it walks the line between sexual teasing and ticklish. Cas lifts his head to blink at Dean with contented and greedy eyes. They steal Dean’s breath away.
Something upset flashes across Dean’s face, through one of the holes in his shell, but it’s gone in the next second. “I’m Dean Winchester, he’s Sam Winchester. We’re brothers. We met you when you were still an angel and you pulled me out of Hell.”
“That’s our home. That’s what I made for you so we could sleep next to each other. I made it for you.”
Staring at the swan in front of him, Castiel finally says it. He finally says what he’s been thinking, what everyone in his life has been thinking, that no one will let out into the air even as it is understood.
Castiel thinks most people would agree that attending a sports match that you do not understand the rules of by yourself doesn’t sound like much fun.
He looks around as the tears that he’d been holding in start down his cheeks, and he feels undeniably idiotic talking to air.
He tells them a brief hello even as he keeps walking. Across the clearing with its nitrogen grass and to the other side where the trees break over a gentle decline that leads him to lazily moving water.
Castiel stands beside Dean in center square. The fire pit in the middle of the open area has been cleaned, the ash and soot shoveled out for the month, until the next fire occurs and creates a new mess. Dean’s wings take up a large portion of the air space between the restaurants and bars here. No one is around.
Castiel doesn’t know if that sounds strange, but Dean’s smirk grows back into an easy smile that lends humor to his eyes. “Anything exciting?”
“You think about fucking me, Cas?” he asks shakily.
He sighs, looks down as he spreads out his lunch on the green grass in front of him, just a few feet from the water’s edge.
To his surprise, it doesn’t bumble back into the darkness. It flies right up to Dean’s face and perches on the bridge of his nose until Dean has to cross his eyes to see it. Its tiny wings and legs tickle when it moves, but for the most part it stays content in its spot.
“Seems like he’s doing just fine to me,” Finley says, and they both watch as one of the townspeople approaches Charlie and begins talking to her. Cas’s arm is still wrapped tightly around her shoulders. He seems to be observing Charlie’s interaction quietly. It’s hard to tell from the distance, but it looks like there’s a small smile playing on his face.
“I know that, you ass. I meant what caused it.”
“I see
Cas, standing near the balcony with his notebook clutched in his hands. His suit even shabbier in the candlelight, staring at Dean as he danced, a look of mourning on his face.
“Don’t!” Dean exclaims, holding out a hand to stop him. “Bobby’s got a built-in safety system. If anybody tries to use magic in here, the whole place goes up in flames.”
“Cas . . .” Dean sighs, pressing at the shoulders of the trench coat. Cas tears out of the overcoat and his suit jacket, leaving him in his shirt and tie. Dean reaches to loosen the tie before Cas’s impatient hands take over and tear it over his head before the knot is undone.
“No, I have never knotted an omega.” Castiel hesitated for a moment. “I am a virgin.”
The terrain in the eastern half of the kingdom is mostly farmland with some stretches of trees the locals refer to as “woods” in between them. Dean’s walked this way often enough that he knows how to avoid the property lines so he’s not arrested for trespassing. Each farm provides enough of a landmark that he can navigate the old poachers’ trails and cross the open landscape quickly on his own. Cas manages to keep up, which again surprises the hell out of Dean.
“What’s wrong with Dean?”
Cas kisses like a man starved, like Dean’s mouth holds the only relief, and Dean can’t do anything but respond. He allows the alpha to take the lead, to dictate the pressure and rhythm, still chaste but escalating. Vanilla and sandalwood and even cedar fill Dean’s senses now, and as Cas wraps his arms around him, nudging at the seam of Dean’s lips with his tongue, Dean moans against him.
Castiel was frozen to the spot. Dean moved away, the crowd parting to let him pass and then filling in behind him, obscuring him from view. Cas’s breath was coming shorter and shallower, his vision narrowing. He needed to move, needed to leave, before he had a panic attack in the middle of the Vinehall ballroom.
“That’s it, little omega, let go for me. Mmm, you feel so good. Gonna make me come all over you. F-fuck! Gonna mark you up. Everybody’s gonna smell me on you and know—oh, shit!—c’mon, baby, that’s it.”
“Relax, I made sure to filter for age. No one under the age of thirty allowed.”
But he’s breathing. It’s part of what’s causing the excruciating pain, so it must be real, right? None of the fantasy worlds Michael tried to lock him away in had real pain like this. It’s part of what helped him break free every time.
. . .
“Please, Gabriel, you know that doesn’t exist.”
Cas moves his hands up and presses firmly against Dean’s chest, moving him back far enough to make eye contact in the dim. He raises an eyebrow in question and waits. Dean stares at him for a long moment, then slumps against Cas’s hands.
Silence settles again, but this time it’s strained with something else. Dean looks up at Cas, who is gazing at him with an inscrutable expression. Dean breathes deep, inhaling the musky notes of sandalwood and vanilla again, thickened in the humid summer air, closing his eyes as it overwhelms his senses.
“I look ridiculous.”
The quad was busy again, since it was the lunch hour, so Cas went from group to group, trying to convince the students that he was conducting a legitimate study, and that their identities would be completely secret.
Dean shrugged, feigning nonchalance. “I guess he wants me to be there. He’s gonna send me a suit and everything.”
He hoped their family would always be this peaceful.
“It looks sealed, Dean. I think it’s just a warning.”
Cas narrowed his eyes at her. “The words on the page can be the speaker’s voice. The omega, in this case. If I, or anyone else, were to read them aloud, then they are immediately being heard in
“DEAN WINCHESTER YOU ARE A COMPLETE
future. Don’t lose it over one man.”
Cas tightens his grip on Dean’s torso. “Are you asking if I would do it again?”
Cas turned quickly to face Dean, cheeks burning. “You didn’t have to—”
The first thing Dean realized was that, at some point, he must have passed out. He was laying in a hospital bed, monitors beeping away next to him, an oxygen cannula under his nose. The lights were bright and florescent, which made him wince. There was noise outside of the small room, but inside was quiet other than the machines.
seen you?”
“Dean, you need to go. Thank you so much for your participation, and . . . and . . . returning my notebooks. Please, just . . . go.”
“Me, too. Thank you for inviting me,” he said, shifting awkwardly.
“It’s all completely confidential,” said Cas quickly. “No identifying traces will be left. Your story will be yours, of course, but it will be presented in a manner that covers any way for anyone to trace it back to you. I can explain my methodology at the lab, if you’d like.”
“What thing?”
The air in the room was getting a bit tense. The violet scent radiating from Dean was getting a little thicker as his agitation grew. The blocker was strong, but Dean wasn’t on suppressants like Cas, so it wouldn’t take much for his natural scent to burst through. Garth and Hannah wouldn’t be able to scent it, but even on suppressants Cas’s alpha would have a difficult time staying objective with omega-in-distress in the air. Cas changed tracks.
“Mmm, but I
The handkerchief was hidden deep in the back of his closet, buried under unused blankets to dampen the scent. He’d received two more gifts since then: a gaudy, expensive gold watch that was stashed in his desk and a bouquet of three dozen red roses that he’d let wilt and then dumped in the trash as quickly as he could. Kevin had laughed, at first, but then sobered quickly at the look on Dean’s face.
Dean hitches his blanket tighter around his shoulders. He’s always cold, now, even fully dressed under his dead guy robe, blanket wrapped around him. It’s weird to get used to, since as an omega he’s always run hot. He shuffles around the bunker in his layers with his ginger steps like the old man he was always pretty sure he’d never grow to be. And he’s drawn to one place.
“Great,” Dean says, then starts walking to the back corner of the room, near the cold fireplace. He shifts a rug aside and then lifts open a trapdoor hidden in the floorboards. Castiel moves to follow him, but is stopped by a firm hand on his elbow.
“Time for bed,” he mutters to himself, using the pen and a quick spell to extract what ink splotches he can without completely erasing the notes. Satisfied that it’s as clean as it’s going to get, he extinguishes the lamp on his desk as he goes to turn in for the night.
“Thank you,” he said tersely.
Castiel is very still as he asks, “Are you certain?”
Dean’s never quite sure how they manage to make it to his apartment, but then the door is slamming shut and Cas is on him again, pinning him to the door and sealing their mouths together again. A low growl starts in Cas’s chest and Dean whimpers, clutching at his back under that ridiculous trench coat. Cas pulls away to start mouthing at Dean’s throat, pressing hot, open-mouthed kisses under Dean’s ear, down the sensitive flesh, and finally nipping at the scent gland at the junction of his neck and shoulder.
Still, when Dean’s heat ended a whole day and a half early, he couldn’t help but allow himself to hope.
He went to unlock the office, but he found it was already open. Hannah was sitting at her desk, headphones in, clearly working on transcribing. He moved toward her desk, but she stopped him, gesturing instead to the interview lounge.
“Oh, yes, right.
Castiel raised his glass in the toast, gently clinking it together with the others’. He sipped lightly at his wine, though Balthazar drank more deeply, and Charlie threw back an entire shot of some clear liquid. Vodka: it was too early for tequila shots. Hannah caught his eye with a smirk as they, too, sipped from their pink-tinted Manhattan. Castiel appreciated whenever Hannah joined them for their outings because Balthazar usually had to be poured into an Uber at the end of the night, and Charlie ended up insisting that they all go down the street to her favorite club, though Castiel usually declined. Hannah would stay to finish a drink with him before parting ways for the night. More than once, Castiel had questioned whether he should reexamine his feelings for them (and more than once Hannah had hinted romantic interest), but ever since Castiel had met them at new faculty orientation ten years ago, there had only been platonic feelings there.
And when Cas had said the words, “You’re promised,” Dean shivered like he’d been doused in cold water. Cas’s scent grew sharper, a little sour at the words, too.
Cas smirked. “You can’t lie to me, Dean. I’ll let you keep your macho image, but I know your secret . . .” He leaned in close, so close that Dean’s breath caught in his throat. “You fucking love
“Dammit, Dean,” she mutters, letting go of Castiel’s arm. “He got dealt a rough hand, Cas. Him and Sam both. I raised ‘em, they’re mine. But there’s . . . he’s got dark stuff in his past, I won’t lie. He thinks he’s gotta fix things he ain’t ever been responsible for and it ain’t my place to tell you. But I will tell you this, fancy Archmage or not: you hurt him and I’ll kick your ass.”
Thankfully, Milton refrained from touching Dean further, but he did lean in ever so slightly, scenting him. “You’ve been heavy-handed with the blockers. I’m disappointed. Try to be less . . . liberal, next time?”
Cas nodded. “Then, Dean, tell me. What story would you like to share?”
Dr. Naomi Milton was a powerhouse in her field and an excellent departmental representative, but personally . . . well, Naomi was best described by the nickname her graduate students gave her: “The Ice Monster.” Frigid and terrifying, Naomi somehow had a soft spot for Castiel, despite what she called his “hippie tree-hugger tendencies.” It was his research into sustainability and urban farming that had gotten the department their biggest grant in decades and led to Naomi’s favoritism.
Dean nodded. Hannah handed him a participant form to sign, which gave them permission to record him, but not permission to use his answers. That form would come at the end once he knew what was recorded. Cas opened his notebook and pressed record on the device on the table between them.
“Okay fine. Sex, then,” Dean said, which made Cas chuckle, so Dean smiled a little as they lapsed into silence.
If he hadn’t been distracted, Dean would have smelled him before he saw him, but as it was he didn’t notice until a familiar figure in a shabby suit drifted into his periphery.
Slowly, painfully, Dean opens his eyes.
“I love you,” Castiel murmured.
The waiter slid Dean’s credit card across the table. He made eye contact with Castiel, whose mortification froze him in place, before the waiter mouthed what was unmistakably
“Wait, dammit, let me—!”
“Enough!”
It wasn’t a command; no alpha timbre there to coerce Dean into doing what Cas wanted. But Dean felt compelled, anyway, his eyes lifting their gaze again until they met Cas’s.
“Okay, buddy.”
On the fourth day, Dean calls for help with research, which Cas is all too happy to do. Dean’s voice is clipped over the phone, but they manage to make it through a conversation without it making Cas want to scream, so he counts it as a win.
“I’ll pass that along to Jack,” Castiel says. Rowena looks surprised.
He thought back to his dream last night, of the nameless, faceless alpha that had buried himself in Dean to the hilt. The alpha had been firm, perfect, filling him and stretching him. Dean held back a whimper as he imagined it, his hole just starting to burn with need.
And he definitely doesn’t roll over to stroke himself with his own slick, moaning Castiel’s name into his fist.
, what if he smelled Cas? They’d been close, they’d been touching, what if he’d been scent-marked again?
“Wait, Cas, hang on—”
A couple of other people had noticed Dean’s apparent distress, coming over from their seats as Dean glanced around, tugging at the open collar of his shirt. Castiel’s heart raced as he reached out for him.
Complete with three “t”s in a row. Castiel rolled his eyes. That kind of “text speech” always reminded him of his students, far too lazy or too prone to habitually shorten already brief words. Perhaps they were necessary ten years ago when texts were limited by character and charged at ten cents a message, but now you could draft a novel and it wouldn’t make a difference.
Dean laughs, kissing Cas once more, brushing sweaty curls from his alpha’s forehead. “Yeah,” he replies. “Yeah, Cas. I think that would be ‘amenable.’”
“Charlie, he’s an alpha . . .”
Aaahhh, it's been too long again! I'm not super happy with this chapter, but it's going to move us along into the next section. I hope you like it!
,” Dean growled. Novak lowered his hands, guilt passing over his features.
“Good morning to you, too, sunshine,” Gabriel said from his place at the table. Castiel grunted at him. “Don’t grunt at me. I know what you did. Bunch of horny teenagers.”
“No. I just . . . you know the sitch, right? That bullshit legislation in the 1950s basically turned omegas into domestic slaves again. Like, okay, sure, we can’t
“Dean,” Cas rumbles in confirmation. It’s- He says it all warm, like he’s cradling something precious in his mouth. Dean feels his eyebrows pull together against the kindness of it and the way that kindness is a shock to his body at the same time that it’s a hot shower after a dirty hunt. His throat works over.
Dean can’t help but laugh as he snatches the lube bottle off of the nightstand just to the right of them. He uncaps the lid before raising an eyebrow at Cas in question. Castiel stares back at him very intently.
“Yes, I suppose that’s them,” Cas says slowly, as if he is not shattering the very last of an illusion Dean has clung to. He doesn’t know what to say. His mouth opens just for him to shut it again. What do you even say to that?
“You can’t,” Dean says, sitting at the first table of the library. It’s expansive in front of him in his solitude. It’s too big for a single person.
“I got a thing- um- a surprise for you.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Cas replies thoughtfully. Some of his yellow, his brightness, has returned.
“So I’m gonna tell you how I make my world-famous cinnamon pancakes, loved by all who reside within the Bunker and those lucky enough to have seen me in an apron. Let me describe ‘em to you, so you understand how absolutely delicious they are even though you can’t taste them. Imagine being wrapped up in a warm blanket made of sunshine and all things good, and then being able to taste what that feels like.”
He makes himself look Cas in the eyes as he continues. There was a time once, in Purgatory, when he didn’t get to say these words out loud like he wanted to.
“They’re me.”
Castiel pauses and looks away. Dean waits for him to continue, but he remains silent
“I know you are, Dean,” he murmurs over the sound of the bees. And somehow, that’s all that needs to be said. “Now, tell me about having wings. I’ll admit, I’m partially curious because of the envy I have for bees and their ability to fly.”
Dean closes his eyes in order to focus, narrowing his brain in on the feel of Charlie’s tiny hand in his. “You start.”
“Secret recipe,” she says and signs, before pretending to zip her lips.
“Yes, I am,” he parrots, maybe feeling a little in awe himself. His broad hand rubs circles on Cas’s back, and Cas turns to liquid under it. Dean watches as Cas’s shoulder slump further forward, his head drooping and lengthening his neck. “Ready for the next part?”
. He raises a barely shaking hand out and traces the line of Cas’s collar bone into the dip of his throat before it slides down until his palm rests flat over Cas’s heart. For a moment, the silence of the bunker is an alternate reality where no one else exists, and Dean and Cas share a look that makes Dean feel like this is the first time in his life he’s been on the exact same page as someone else.
Mystery Man’s head tilts and he squints at the tumbler. “You don’t… swing?”
The tears start falling while Miracle is still up in his face, so Dean pins him in his arms and brings his furry body to his chest in a hug. “Good boy,” he says as he rocks them together. Buries his blurry eyes into Miracle’s soft coat. “I’m okay, don’t worry.”
“They are-” Cas sighs, “Sam suggested them to me. They’re videos that are supposed to help with anxiety.”
“Metaphors, huh?” Dean sounds intrigued. His stubbled cheek rubs against Castiel’s. “Like what?”
“Love you, Cas,” Dean murmurs as he finally steps away with a smile on his face.
When he opens his eyes, Cas is looking at where their fingers are woven together with something both sad and disbelieving. He sits there and he’s Dean’s home. The owner of the name that plagued the angels for six straight days because Dean refused to let him be gone.
“Is there something else I have to do?”
So it’s Cas’s sweet blue eyes glazing over with wet tears as he looks at Dean with the most feeble sort of hope. Dean’s thumb rubs over Cas’s high cheekbone.
And Cas’s face is all twisting lines again. Dean’s eyes widen.
“You know, it takes, like, two seconds to walk here from the Bunker,” Dean says gruffly, trying to sound annoyed but finding it difficult with the smile fighting its way onto his face. He keeps his eyes towards the sky, feeling unstable, like one look at Cas might topple him over.
“You would have had to hold ice against your thighs for the next two days. Not to mention the state of your penis would have been an unimaginable horror.”
“‘Course. It’ll be nice to have someone on my case to draw more, too.”
Castiel stares pointedly at the dark bedroom wall directly across from him. “I won’t do it again.”
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Sam asks hushed, tired and comforting like he actually wants to know. “Is this about Cas?”
“Good night, Cas.”
the third friend says.
After Sam leads him through twisting hallways to all sorts of strange rooms, he shows Castiel his bedroom last. The proof that he lives here with the brothers is almost too much, so Castiel does not think about it.
To keep himself busy while he waits, Castiel reorganizes his shelves, pulling jars forward to replace the spots of the ones that have already been sold and making sure their labels are visible. He’s only made it to the second shelf down when he hears a discreet rapping against the wood of the back door.
“No,” Cas growls without any heat, “just for me,” a pause, “and Eileen. No one else deserves it.”
Closing the sketchbook in his lap carefully, Dean sets it on his bedside table. For just one second, he lets himself fantasize that Cas is sitting at the foot of his bed looking back at him, soft and mussed and ready to go to sleep. In Dean’s head, Cas lays down beside him.
“But you’re gonna come, right?”
He wipes the slickness that’s left over on his erection, getting more from the bottle and lubing himself up fully before cleaning his fingers on Dean’s comforter and throwing the bottle to the floor. Then, Castiel moves back up the length of Dean’s body until he overlaps him, lining himself up to Dean’s hole with one hand, the other holding his weight next to Dean’s head. “May I?”
Castiel squints at Dean, at the wrinkles beside his eyes and the clench of his jaw. He is tart like the oranges inside of his mesh bag shell, but sweet. The juice that runs down your chin, the citrus scent that stays on your fingers long after the orange is peeled.
Cas’s voice right beside his ear rumbles, “Do you like that I’m strong?”
“It’s embarrassing,” Cas admits. Dean notices the flush high on the angel’s cheeks and nose darkening.
, how-?” Dean’s voice is as whiny as Castiel has ever heard it, weak and rough. He knows what a privilege it is to experience it.
, Dean,” Cas says exasperated. “That’s not what I meant. At all.”
“I know that it’s difficult, sometimes, to accept this. You believe that you have done too much harm to be able to feel good again, in this life. It’s not even always a conscious decision. But you reject the way that a simple touch could light you on the inside. Because at every turn there’s some pressing matter or some new anxiety set on keeping you from peace. But those times are over, and I’m telling you now that every sensitive nerve ending you have was made so that you could experience this. Pleasure is not inherently sinful, nor is it something to be earned.”
It almost makes Dean worry that he’s
And, now, most embarrassingly.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean breathes out, “you can take ‘em off.”
“Hey,” he says softly. She’s got brown hair and brown eyes that meet his fearfully. “Somethin’ I can do for ya?”
Their lips touch, their stubble brushes, and goosebumps race up the back of Dean’s neck. Cas kisses gently, a tender, shivering friction where his lips are just as dry as Dean’s. And it’s Cas, and Dean has wanted this for so long that he doesn’t remember a time when he didn’t
Dean’s eyes spark. He opens his mouth, but when nothing comes out, his brow furrows. He licks his lips and tries again. “
,” draws another circle to the left of Cas’s neck, “Two.”
He can feel the disbelief radiating off of Cas at his response, and is almost impressed when all Castiel has to say is, “Dean,” in that soft tone he has. That soft tone he only uses on Dean.
Dean’s head snaps up and he feels pinned in place. He wants to stop whatever words are about to come out of Cas’s mouth, and he doesn’t even know what they are yet.
“Fuck!” Dean cries up. “There! There, Cas- My-
“Well,” Cas sighs almost impishly, “I’ve been meaning to have some quiet time, think over some new plans for a subsection of heaven that Jack and I are redesigning,” he glances over at Dean like it’s an inside joke that Cas finally understands. “It can get a little lonely, though. I don’t mean to impose, I know you’re probably exhausted, but would it be too much to ask if I sat in here while I worked things out? I promise not to bother you while you sleep.”
The hand still holding his squeezes again, tighter than before.
Sam leaves, and Dean doesn’t.
“Do not defend my behaviors,” Cas says back with something resigned in those chimes. “Reason means nothing.”
“So I asked Eileen to help, and I’ve been practicing this ASMR stuff with her so that I knew I could do it right. I’m not exactly a professional or anything, but Eileen seems to like it so- so I must be okay. And it’s nice for me, too, honestly. Sometimes, I-... It’s hard for me to remember that I’m allowed to do stuff like this now. I like- Taking care of people, that’s what I’m good at, it’s what I do. And I don’t want to take for granted that I have the time to do it now. Or a-a person who makes me want to do this shit in the first place.” Dean sighs, his hands clenching and unclenching around his thumbs as he finally falls silent.
Dean wants to laugh, except Cas’s words really aren’t funny at all, and he almost chokes on his spit.
Jesus, Dean forgot how exposing it felt to be in this position. “Been a while since I’ve done this,” he says just to say something because he feels self-conscious.
That’s… okay. Dean can handle that. Probably.
“Sam,” Dean says seriously, “if you don’t marry this girl, I will.”
Under his ministrations, Cas is unnaturally still, no movement of breath from his chest and no minute fluttering of his eyelids. The only things separating him from a statue at The Louvre are the flush that spans his cheeks and his relaxed, parted lips.
“Soon,” Castiel promises. “Your body yields easily like this, it won’t take long at all.”
Dean thinks maybe he’s sinking. Like maybe sinking is actually equivalent to being grounded in something, and then rooted in something, so that descending has never felt so good. Because what he feels right now is both gratitude and selfishness in equal measure where he wants to hold Charlie and Cas in his palms like this so that they stay this warm forever. Playing a game that Dean made up when he was a kid. And Dean wants to capture it- wants to save it- keep it- wants to-
The tears that have been waiting in the wings since what feels like the second Cas left finally spill out of Dean’s eyes. He feels so stupid. What is he supposed to do when everything in him intersects and conflicts, every second of his existence in friction with himself? When all he wants is to thread his fingers through Cas’s and bump their shoulders together while they walk through some park they stumbled upon on their way to a car show, because there’s finally time to enjoy the little things.
Castiel perked up and followed the young nurse back into an examination room. He smiled at Castiel blandly and gestured to the exam table, so Castiel hopped up onto it, paper cover crinkling under his hands. Posters covering various aspects of omega health hung on the walls, detailing everything from the health benefits of having regular heats to the dangers of suppressant use in bright colors and elegant fonts. Castiel skimmed a few of them, not catching many details, as the nurse pulled up a profile on the computer.
“How’re you still sober?” Dean asked, indignant. Cas shrugged.
Hannah finished the paperwork with Gilda and brought her into the interview room. Castiel smiled at her as she took a seat primly on the edge of one of the chairs.
“Dean—I’m close—” was all the warning Castiel managed to give before he was coming hard into the condom, thighs shaking over Dean’s shoulders. Dean’s vicious mouth turned gentle, lapping at Castiel through the aftershocks. As he started to soften, Dean pulled back and removed the condom, tying it off and tossing it in the direction of Castiel’s trash can. He smirked at Castiel before moving up to kiss him, deep and probing, while post-orgasmic lethargy started to set in to Castiel’s limbs. After a long moment, Dean pulled back to look into Castiel’s eyes, and Castiel couldn’t help but laugh.
“Can I help you find something?” Castiel asks. Dean looks back and forth between two books in his hands before shaking his head and putting them both to the side.
The catch in Dean’s breath made Cas’s heart ache, and even though he’d been careful not to touch Dean unless he asked, he couldn’t help but lean forward and press him close. Dean stiffened, but only for a moment, before he relaxed into Cas’s grip and hugged him back. Tears pricked behind Cas’s eyes when Dean turned his nose in to scent him, relief flooding the air around them. Cas clutched at the back of Dean’s sweatshirt as Dean whimpered a little into Cas’s neck.
“They all can see you, you know,” Michael continued. “How beautiful you are. How much you belong to me.”
. Not until every omega has a place to tell their own story; for their own voice to matter.”
“Baby bro!”
“Can I come on you?” Dean whispered. “Make you mine.”
!” Dean shouts, throwing a book across the room. The pain in his arm flares hot and he grits his teeth against it. He reaches to press a hand to his forearm before taking the spell from Bobby. “And this’ll fix it?”
“Early Enochian. Pretty much unreadable. I got a pretty good linguistic breakdown a few years back that made a lotta this possible. Read it out loud; you don’t gotta know what it’s saying, just pronounce it exactly like it’s written there.”
Cas pushed himself away from his laptop and rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes. He would have to dig into his references to attribute his sources later. The cursor blinked at him from the page as the words blurred together. Cas carefully saved and closed the literature review before shutting down his laptop. The “research lab” that he and Hannah had put together was silent, as it had been every day for the last two weeks. He and Hannah had been handing out flyers throughout campus, attempting to speak to the students, but so far no one had come in to participate. He had expected some initial reticence, but at this rate he wouldn’t be able to collect enough material for his thesis.
does this guy have a major stick up his ass.
“No, Sammy, you’re not!”
“Sammy?”
she said. Castiel couldn’t help but smile a little.
Castiel rolled his eyes and followed Gabriel down the stairs, but his heart was full.
“You idjits done yappin’? I got something you should see.”
. . .
“Where the hell did you get those?” he demands.
Dean surges in to devour Cas’s mouth, grinding his hips against Cas’s until Cas is a moaning, panting mess. Once they’d finally gotten their heads out of their asses, this part was actually easy. Casual touches as they pass in the Bunker’s hallways, reassuring pats and a quick hand squeeze on a hunt when they’re going to split up for a while, a language they learned almost instantly once that barrier fell.
The collection is eclectic, some small trinkets from truck stop gift shops, souvenirs from roadside tourist traps. There’s a tiny pencil from the first time he, Claire, and Dean went miniature golfing, a particularly appealing pine cone from a park where he sometimes goes with Sam when he goes for a run. Nothing expensive, or useful, but while he’s finding it more difficult to recall events from his long memory as an angel, he remembers the circumstances around every one of his items.
Dean, laid out on the bed, moaning and leaking, trying to satisfy an urge that Castiel was perfectly capable of satisfying . . .
It was frigid and snowing when Castiel touched down on Earth, and even though he couldn’t feel the weather, he was still annoyed at being brought down from the comfort of Heaven.
The thought still made his stomach turn. Michael would suck the life out of the vibrant omega and leave him a broken shell of his former self. Castiel had seen it happen before. Had done nothing to help.
The burning in his guts had moved to his whole body, and even between waves he writhed and needed . . . something more. The knot helped, but something was missing.
.” She shuddered.
“Cas, it’s me. I’ve got the car—”
“No, I walked. I just didn’t realize . . .”
“You can fetch our beer.”
Behind him, Cas begins to stir, stretching his legs a little as he nuzzles into Dean’s neck from behind. A fluttering thrill runs through Dean, a little flicker of desire flashing through his gut, but then he gathers himself and moves away. Cas clutches at him, trying to pull him back, but Dean can’t handle that.
. . .”
“Okay.”
They hold each other in silence for a few more breaths until Dean slowly pulls away. He’s still close enough that Castiel can see the tears caught in his lashes and count the freckles on his nose, his mouth set in a grim line. Part of Castiel, deep down, wishes he could kiss his frown away.
Castiel worked to control his breathing. Was he going to do this? He was no stranger to one-night-stands, but it had really been since grad school that he’d indulged in one. The last time he’d gotten laid was nearly five years ago now, and that wasn’t something he wanted to dwell on. He was forty-one years old today.
, Sam!).
, Dean’s brain supplied unhelpfully. Wherever that had come from. “Can we just . . . go somewhere?”
“Like I said, I think at this point all I need you to say is ‘how fucking high,’ you miserable pup.”
, anyway. You should see the looks I get here when I tell them my big brother goes to the best Omega school in the country.”
“You should feel better after your next heat or two. You’ve been on suppressants for longer than we recommend.”
Cas climbed out of his car and dragged his fingers gently across Baby’s hood as he passed. A thin layer of dust was starting to gather, so he was careful not to touch too much lest he scratch her pristine paint. He should take her for a wash next weekend.
God, Cas smelled amazing. That stupid apples-and-spices scent was even thicker today than it had been a week ago. Dean’s body had obviously officially kicked the last of the suppressants, because every inch of him had been reacting to the pure
Please enjoy! Your comments, kudos, and subscriptions are all AMAZING and I appreciate every single one of you!
Sam shakes his head and sighs. “Why are you even going on this date if you’re just going to ruin it?”
A buzzing sound alerted him from underneath his bedside table, and Cas scooped it up, answering without checking the screen.
of you! Castiel, I know you have power in Lebanon, but guess what, this ain’t Lebanon. And the further you get from your elemental source, the weaker you’ll get, right?” Castiel frowns.
“I’m fine,” Dean managed, though it came out a bit husky. He cleared his throat. “How is your project going?”
“No, no, no, no,” he murmurs. His bag is empty. Everything Bobby had given them, all of the incantations and potions and instruments they would need to do the level of magic expected, were gone.
Mr. Harris scanned his credit card without batting an eye at the total, which always made Dean uncomfortable, then took his keys and walked out into the growing dusk. The door rang behind him.
Cas nearly dropped his phone. “I thought you were doing corporate law,” he managed.
“Please fuck me, Dean,” Castiel rumbled, and then Dean was sinking in, slowly at first, the fat head of his cock spreading him wide. Castiel groaned at the intrusion and tried to spread his legs more to give Dean better access.
Maybe then Anna could forgive him.
, but with her family, her hands are tied, you know? So I thought, maybe there are other Vinehall omegas that want to be part of this but
The paper sheet crinkled under Dean’s ass as he jiggled his foot impatiently. Cas was sitting in the chair in the corner, answering work emails on his phone. Finals were quickly approaching, and Cas had skipped his office hours to accompany Dean to the OS, so students were probably blowing up his inbox. The clock on the wall ticked loudly in the silence between them.
Naomi swept in and the air in the room dropped about five degrees. Castiel nodded. “Naomi.”
Naomi sighed deeply. “Castiel, I warned you about this. Omegas with proper breeding are different. They are private. It is unseemly for them to reveal the kinds of secrets you wish to encourage them to reveal.”
Dean stared at him, a strange look on his face. “Anybody ever tell you you’re one weird alpha?” Castiel laughed.
“Well, if you guys do go public, you know what that means,” Kevin said. Dean’s confusion must have shown on his face because Kevin rolled his eyes. “You are so hopeless. If he’s taking you public, then you’ll be, like, officially his. He’ll probably take you to events and stuff, take you out to dinner, y’know, typical courting stuff. Most alphas don’t get that serious unless they’re gonna mate the omega.”
“’S not bad.”
Kevin gave him that look again, the one that said Dean was incredibly dense. The one that said Kevin had no idea what Dean was doing here if he didn’t know anything about it. Dean kind of agreed with him.
“Oh, no, Cas, did you let Baz set you up?” Charlie groaned. Castiel cleared his throat.
Castiel laughed, mirthless. “Of course.”
“Vinehall prepared me for my future,” said a redhead with striking blue eyes, a graduation cap perched on her pretty head. “It will do the same for yours.”
Dean worked hard not to think about how this was all happening. His life, his future, whatever that was, didn’t matter. Sam was safe, and happy, and getting to live his dream. And, hell, Dean could do way worse.
“That’s very kind of you, Dean, but I don’t know if that’s such a good idea.”
“From your alpha,” was all he’d said. Dean growled at him, taking the brown paper bag and shutting the door in his face.
“Morning, Cas,” Hannah greeted him as he walked into the department’s office. Hannah’s own office was down the hall, but the departmental office had the best coffee, so the other professors were often spotted in here during breaks. As the ranking tenured professor directly below the department chair, Castiel had the privilege of a large, window-lined office connected to the main one. Which meant easy access to the good coffee and the buffer of Hael, their department secretary, between him and any concerned students. However, it also unfortunately put him in proximity of the department chair herself.
“Dude, what the fuck? Where have you been?”
“Okay, cool, everybody’s met Cassie. Can we just fuckin’ . . . do something
“You’ve been through a lot,” Cas said. “I’m sorry that you had to experience that.”
“Dean!”
None of the videos had turned him on like Dean did.
alcohol tolerance. They’d finished the first bottle and were halfway through the second within about an hour, and Dean was feeling flushed and giggly while Cas sat apparently unaffected.
Dean shoves off his boxers and wiggles to let them fall to the floor. Castiel can’t help but stare, now, with the alpha’s huge, half-hard cock in front of him. He’s smooth below the belt, trimmed and groomed, but he’s also ram-rod straight and circumcised. The purple head of Dean’s cock is glistening with pre-come, and Castiel feels a rush thinking that it’s because of him, he did that. Dean’s thighs are strong, though his legs taper narrowly to his ankles. A spray of light brown hair is scattered on his legs, along with the freckles that seem to cover his whole body.
Gabriel laughed. “Well, because I miss you, maybe? And, y’know, I’ve become a pretty successful omega rights lawyer and I think your project might be interesting.”
“Thank you, Hannah.”
“I gotta, gotta get home, Gabe—Gabriel . . .”
“You’re amazing,” Cas said quietly. Dean blinked up at him, smiling blithely.
“Like hell he doesn’t. You’re tellin’ me you’ve got the Archmage of Lebanon on your side and you ain’t gonna use him?”
“Great, thanks.”
“Come for me, alpha,” Castiel breathes, and then Dean is gone, moaning as his cock pumps long ropes of thick white come between them. Dean pants hard, working himself through his orgasm, staring into Castiel’s eyes the whole time.
“Good. Now, get out of my sight.”
And Dean was here. He had stomped around campus in his dusty boots, staring down the looks of disdain he’d garnered. His clothes were clean, but he stuck out like a sore thumb here in his beat-up jeans and worn flannels. Even smelling like violets, like everything else, he’d already started to get some unwanted attention.
“With Dean? I haven’t done anything with
Dean laughed again, and the clouds that had covered his eyes seemed to recede a little. Castiel’s inner alpha was pleased at making the omega laugh, chanting at him to make it happen again. Dean, for his part, did move closer and perched on the very edge of the bench. Clearly he’d taken the Vinehall etiquette lessons for “how to sit as though you weigh nothing” to heart. Castiel turned to gather his notebook when a breeze kicked up again, and this time Castiel knew he wasn’t mistaken.
With that, Gabriel left him alone. His room was silent, now; the walls were well-soundproofed, but he imagined that if he strained his ears, he could just make out the sounds of Dean in the throes of his heat.
“Is this your place?” Dean asked, hovering in the doorway. Cas turned to him.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean says, still sputtering. “She’s a good friend. Good people.” Castiel nods, sipping thoughtfully at his beer.
Pain shot through Dean’s heart as he watched the kid. He reminded Dean strongly of Sam; they were of an age, and would probably be best freakin’ friends if they ever met. Too fucking bad Kevin had presented omega. Kid was smarter than any alpha Dean had ever met. Including Sammy.
His eyes dart away to look anywhere but Castiel’s face as he rolls up his shirt sleeve. The Mark is growing darker by the day.
to force you to face me—”
Dean can’t believe how much Bobby’s been able to do without the book, and now that he has it it’s only a matter of time until they figure out how to counter whatever John’s done. With Cas refusing to stay away from the research process, it’s getting more difficult to keep the truth from him, but Dean has to admit that he’s actually been some help.
“No.”
The wall Dean put up between the two of them has never felt more fragile as the long pause that follows. Cas deserves to know. He
“My uncle Bobby. He’s the contact I came here to see. Aha!”
“I can imagine,” Cas whispers. “Regaining your father only to lose him again.”
Cas cut him off by taking hold of the back of his neck and gently guiding him into a fervent kiss. Dean melted, all of the leftover tension draining from him as he wrapped his arms around his alpha and leaned into him. Cas’s lips were warm and soft and familiar, and Dean couldn’t help but nip lightly at them, darting his tongue out to get Cas to deepen the kiss. It was only a few moments, however, before Cas pulled back with a couple of light pecks to his lips, and finally a lingering kiss pressed to his forehead. Dean couldn’t suppress the small whine that escaped as Cas moved just far enough away to stare into his eyes. As always, Dean felt like Cas was staring into the depths of his soul with his deep-blue x-ray vision. Cas smiled, small and secret, but Dean could see his own worry reflected there, too.
Every time they venture out, the Linden apiary welcomes them with open arms. The grass just as green, the sun just as gentling. The bees buzz merrily in the background in white noise, and Castiel thinks that maybe they know how happy he is and that they’re cheering him along. He just checked on them the other day and he’s certain they’re doing fine, so there is no reason to be here to check them again.
“Well, I wasn’t expecting to tell you, let alone have something come from it. I felt guilty about finding it arousing in the first place, so I was just going to… ignore it.”
“I didn’t intend to worry you.” Castiel hesitates. He dredges up his memories from last night at the dinner table, words that he means and wants to say but doesn’t know how to air. He will air them here, he decides, with his forgotten memories like a shield to protect him. “I simply wanted to-to thank both of you. There is much that I don’t remember, and I have to assume that is because you were in a large part of my memories. In Heaven, we did not display any sort of affection or care for each other the way that it seems you two care for me. You have shown me more kindness in this short time than I have been witness to in my entire life. And I am very old.”
He just laughs and leaves a smacking kiss on the side of her head. “As if, sunshine.”
Dean’s muscles seize, loose and so tight at the same time that they may snap bone where he’s barely even a person anymore. Gasping for air with Cas’s fingers so fucking deep in him, touching his fucking insides, Dean trembles in Cas’s lap while Cas wrings pleasure out of him without stopping.
Dean pushes the gun back and forth across the countertop with his fingertips. It takes him swallowing three times before he feels like he can get his voice together. When he speaks, his voice is rusty.
Dean’s about to agree before he actually thinks about it. Because having Cas all over him would be nice, but also Dean always feels a little useless on the bottom. He wants to be close, for both of them, for Cas to feel his love and his wanting right back so that sex is a mutual event. Maybe even something glorious.
So he’ll fight against every nervous, shaking part of himself. Every part of him that is terrified that Cas won’t feel that same. That Cas will push him away.
is still a near-constant in the Bunker. Dean has always thought, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and there ain’t a damn thing wrong with this album. He doesn’t follow many award shows for current media because he doesn’t like most of it, but if he finds out Taylor doesn’t win
“If you wanted, Sam and I could build you one of those beehive boxes above ground. That way you could have your own pet bees.” But that feels as foolish as his Heaven recommendation, useless with building things the old fashioned human way while Cas could snap his fingers and create nebulas. His gut sinks until it hits his knees, and suddenly he doesn’t like this conversation very much.
He thinks about how Eileen always compliments his baking and offers up new ideas for recipes. How happy that makes him. Thinks about how much he likes the new Taylor Swift album, too, and his gratefulness for the unspoken way Sam mans the speaker to make sure music is always playing so that the Bunker doesn’t get too quiet.
That seems to make Dean react because he lets out a long stream of air through his nose before he raises his clasped hands to the crown of his head and walks a circle around the room. Sam ignores him, so Castiel does, too.
“I fucking love you,” and then he pulls Cas back in.
There Dean stands in glory under a sun that no longer seems jealous of him, but that has come to his aid gracefully. Its light hums a melody off of the tanned skin across Dean’s shoulders and hip bones until the air is buzzing yellow with Dean’s resonance. And Dean is here at Castiel’s apiary with only the sunshine covering him. Oh, without question it becomes a dream.
If Castiel had to guess, it looks like the swan is eyeing up the bread in his hand.
Ahead of Castiel is a flowing river of people, most dressed in variations of white and red that represent the East home team while the odd few don the blue and gold of the West Kingdom. They walk in chattering groups, the excited energy radiating off of them seems to vibrate as they bustle towards the entrance of the large municipal field. Though, municipal field may be a little generous, considering that even though it is open for all locals to use throughout the week, it is most commonly known as the Frisbee Stadium by those in the East Kingdom. For good reason, Castiel thinks, because there’s very little reason to attend the stadium unless it is a summer Saturday with a home game planned.
Dean’s hand turns into a white-knuckled fist that he raps against the table in feigned nonchalance while his cheeks puff out with the breath he’s holding. When he lets it out, there’s a whining “Heh,” on the end of it. He nods, clears his throat. Cas is looking way too smug. “Mmm, mmhmm, yep. You’re a quick learner, Cas.” Dean can’t help the way his voice comes out strangled.
He watches how they interact with each other, how they talk and laugh. Castiel remains quiet in the backseat. He has many questions, but he fears that if he voices them that the men will realize he is still with them, and they will send him on his way and head towards their home. Castiel cannot remember whether he has a home or not, even in the sense of a place that has a roof that he can sleep under. Humanity is fragile, that Castiel has had to learn, it is so easy to die. He is afraid.
“Glory,” Castiel whispers to him.
“How did you…” Finley scoots even closer and points to where Charlie’s arm is angled in their direction. The warmth of her smaller body against Dean’s side is nice. It reminds him of when Sam was younger and would lean up against Dean on his bad days, when he just needed an arm around him and for someone to tell him it would be okay.
But his words make Dean raise an eyebrow. He knows a pickup line when he hears one. In fact, he thinks he’s used the ‘Have we met before?” schtick on a waitress last week in Alabama. And it worked too. Suddenly things are clicking into place. The awkwardly close sitting, ignoring the bartender’s flirting, the hunched position like he thinks Dean’s gonna throw a punch at him.
and it makes Dean feel out of his fucking gourd.
Cas’s hands lock so strong on Dean’s hips that his short fingernails bite into skin as he seats himself fully inside of Dean. Pressed together like this, Dean can feel the muscles in Cas’s stomach contract as he tries to curl in on himself, on Dean, until Cas’s forehead presses against Dean’s again like he doesn’t even have any choice in the matter. His whole body is a tremor that shakes Dean with it.
Yes, yes, fuck, I love you,” Castiel sobs. His head slams back into the bone of Dean’s shoulder as he comes. It’s blinding. He’s numb and floating on it while he stripes his stomach with his orgasm.
Dean doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He squeezes Jack’s neck a final time before letting his hand fall back at his side. “That sounds awesome, kid. Make sure you keep it running until I get up there, okay?”
They stand in stunned silence and just look at each other for a second. Dean never thought that an album release could feel so oddly life-altering. This might actually be the most adrenaline Dean has experienced since the world didn’t end.
“What?” Dean splutters. “You can’t be on his side here!”
Cas must be tired, too, because he doesn’t even bother putting up a protest of his own before moving from his makeshift shelter and into Dean’s.
He smiled lightly at the affection in her voice. “Are we prepared for tomorrow?”
The living area was open to the small kitchen and dining area. The appliances were all up-to-date and fashionable, and the countertops and floors were the same warm Spanish tile. Down a short hallway was a cozy bedroom equipped with a queen-sized bed and a walk-in closet, and an en-suite bathroom with a soaker tub and a large multi-head shower. On the whole, the entire thing was far nicer than his tiny apartment in Berkeley. It wasn’t going to be a bad space to live and work in for a few months.
Despite himself, Castiel shivered.
“First off, your wardrobe is hideous and needs to be burned. You’ll have to get everything new and have it all tailored. I’ll send you to my son, he’s taken over the business since I’ve moved here full-time. Gavin knows the Vinehall fit and cut like the back of his hand. Second, you have
Dean swallowed. “Is he . . . Are they ready?” he asked. Gabriel narrowed his eyes, but nodded. Dean clenched his hands in the fabric of his jeans, rubbing his palms against the fabric. Now or never.
Gabriel laughed maniacally as there was a knock on the door to the bungalow. It was probably Hannah. Castiel had sent her a text letting her know his new living arrangements.
“Four.”
The friction on his cock from Dean’s thrusts driving him into the bed was overwhelming, and it wasn’t long until Castiel’s core tightened against the coming orgasm.
Another reason why Dean needed an alpha who would cherish him and take care of him. Not treat him like a trophy or worse . . .
in the pale colors that made up the Vinehall uniform.
Whether he was okay if they conceived or not, Cas’s alpha was all in for fucking Dean hard and fast to pump him as full as he could until he caught. Dean slid down Cas’s cock agonizingly slowly so he felt each velvety, searing inch. A high-pitched whine came from one of them, though Cas honestly couldn’t say which. Once Dean was fully seated, he sat panting for a moment while Cas twitched inside of him. At first, Cas thought Dean was getting accustomed to the stretch, but then it dragged on. Finally, he saw the pinch between Dean’s eyebrows and his heart ached.
“How does your uncle have a copy of the Codex?”
Dean, correct?” Castiel asks, squinting slightly at Dean’s hesitation. Dean blinks a couple of times, then slaps his mask back on.
“No, I’m certain I don’t know,” he says. “I, uh, don’t subscribe to that sort of . . . nonsense.”
Dean glared at him as he was released to return to his dorm room.
Cas’s mouth drops open a little. “I want that, too,” he says simply. Dean grins.
Thank you all SO MUCH! The response to this story continues to be overwhelming.
As Castiel grew accustomed to the scent of the omega around him, he started picking up on its nuances. There was heat there, definitely; Dean was an omega in full bloom, irresistible to alphas the world over. It was the kind of full-bodied scent that alphas went crazy over. But there was also a profound sense of sadness, and a bitter sense of loathing.
“Thank you, you know how much I value your opinion.”
Dean casts one last glance at Castiel, then drops his books and goes to meet Bobby at the top of the ladder. Castiel takes another look around before following behind.
“Don’t make me pull this car over, you two!”
“No set-ups! It’s supposed to be CandyCorp friends and family, and since I really don’t have any of the latter, I figure I should load up some of the former to bring. I invited Saileen and the pups, too.”
As Dean left him behind, again, carrying the scent of the alpha in the back of his nose, he thought
The words fell softly from Castiel’s lips, casting a pall over the atmosphere in the room. Dean’s face turned hard, though his small smile remained in place.
As Cas pulled into the garage, anxiety grew a thick knot in his stomach. The last few weeks had been awful; he almost dreaded what he would find when he went into the house. He and Dean had just closed on it in September and spent the last couple of months on the small upgrades they could afford on Cas’s new salary. It should be full of happiness and potential, and it had been. In fact, a month ago it was the happiest he’d been since the day Dean agreed to be his mate.
His sheets were soaked. He was covered in a combination of his own slick and sweat and come, and more slick was slowly seeping out of him even as he laid there. His insides burned, the vice-like grip that had developed the night before still twisting his guts, but now instead of ice he was full of fire.
Objectively, Dean is beautiful. He’s clearly older than Sam, but he still has youthful, boyish features that are sparkling with laughter. His eyes are red-rimmed, likely from the weed, but they’re wide when they stare openly back at Castiel. He’s handsome, and freckled, and joyful, and Castiel’s heart beats just a little faster.
“Early,” Castiel murmured. Dean sighed and turned in Castiel’s arms, nuzzling deeper into the angel’s embrace.
They skipped and stomped around their alcove, laughing uproariously at their lack of coordination, each trying to take the gentleman’s part and inevitably treading on each other’s toes. Castiel was having a far better time than he thought he would.
“No, burgers make me very happy,” Cas said, taking a bite. He groaned around it, making Charlie laugh.
“I don’t think so,” Michael replied, reaching for Dean. “I have an early flight in the morning.”
Dean perked up a little as a paunchy, middle-aged alpha took the stage. The low chatter in the room died out, and he smiled unctuously at the gathered students. “For those of you who don’t know, I am President Adler, and I am the leader of this fine institution. For our older students, welcome back, and to our new students, welcome! You are all a part of a great legacy stretching back generations. I hope you’re all as proud as I am to be a part of it. Before we start, I’d like to take a moment to congratulate you all on being the future of our great country. Every man and woman in this room will go on to be the omega-parent of the next generation of leaders. We are here to prepare you for that role, and continue our storied legacy.”
“Yo, baby bro, what’s up?”
“God, Cas, please . . . you’re so huge. Fill me up. Gonna fill me up, baby?”
“No, sir,” Dean replied quietly. He was actually quite warm, dressed in the fabulous tuxedo Michael had bought him for the fall social.
They lay there in silence such a long time that Dean was sure Cas had fallen back to sleep. So he was hardly expecting a reply when he whispered, “What if it doesn’t work?” into the darkness.
Dean pushed his way back into the ballroom, hoping to get as far away as possible. He didn’t see if any of his friends noticed, and he’d nearly made it to the door when he slammed into a scent that hit him like a brick wall.
it was, and Dean’s gorgeous, masculine hips hadn’t spread enough to deliver without surgical intervention. Ten hours and one c-section later, though, Dean was resting in a hospital bed, shirtless, with their tiny, fragile daughter nestled on his bare chest.
It had been a very long time since he’d missed working with his hands quite so fiercely, but it was a feeling he couldn’t shake the entire drive into the city center.
Cas’s shift that day had ended two hours ago, and he still wasn’t home. It was a short trip from his job at the Gas ‘N Sip to their dingy little apartment, so Cas usually walked. He’d done the same thing through two previous Chicago winters, but that didn’t stop Dean from worrying as the snow fell hard and fast.
“That’s wonderful,” Dr. Banes said, prompting. Dean shifted uncomfortably; the paper sheet crinkled.
“Yeah, man, I’m good.”
“Do you think we should decorate for the holidays?” Cas asks to distract himself as Dean’s gentle fingers remove his bandage and probe at the wound.
Dean’s nervous, and he doesn’t know why. It’s just coffee, and it’s just Cas.
“I am not hooking up through
“No, Dean.”
“Hey, Doc. How’re the kids?”
Meanwhile, the stash that Dean has building in his room is getting out of control. He’s decided that enough is enough, so today he’s at least going to figure out a place to put it all. At first, he tried putting the clothes in his closet, but that itchy feeling started to get unbearable so he pulled everything out and spread it all over his bed. As he’s organizing, he realizes that he’s got three piles: his stuff, Sam’s stuff, and Cas’s. Sam’s stuff obviously doesn’t go on Dean’s bed, and the stupid sasquatch should probably come wash it himself, anyway. Actually, it might have simply gotten mixed up with Dean’s laundry because half of it is folded and looks freshly washed. If only he had his sense of smell, he’d be able to tell the difference.
“Well, what if I told you it was real? All of it?”
