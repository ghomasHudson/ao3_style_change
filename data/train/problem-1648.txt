"We are not here to talk about me Dr Watson. We are here to talk about Sherlock. As you know he is still not well. The morphine administered to him by that foul bastard of a doctor pushed his weakened body over the edge. His liver, kidneys and heart are in terrible condition, yet that is not what concerns me.“ Mycroft put his briefcase on the table and opened it.
“It’s not that simple Mycroft … I can’t just come here every day. This is 2 and a half hours away from where I life now. I can’t leave Rosy with relatives for so long –“
If his calculation were right Mycroft would pull his security on him in about two weeks – three tops. John will probably want to leave tomorrow after the evening they had (he would probably move back in to his apartment. Sherlock could sneak and check up on him from time to time just to make sure that he was ok). Mrs Hudson could be distracted. Mycroft was the only real problem really.
“What? No that's stupid! They can just use blood thinners and wait for the cloth to dissolve,” John almost yelled this out, looking at Mycroft as if he just said the stupidest thing ever.
“He’s right… you could never shoot him … Not John, not your beloved friend …” Sherlock looked at the man behind John, eyes wide open. “Don’t you dare get close to him!” Sherlock screamed and fired a shot at Moriarty, the bullet flying just pass John’s head.
“If it were not for me Sherlock wouldn’t have had a relapse after Marys death. If I weren’t so centered on my own pain and blamed Sherlock for it all, he wouldn’t have done all that to get my attention. If I had been a better friend or even just a doctor I could have figured out that something was wrong with him. I could have saved his arm and the friendship we had. But I was selfish. I always was, wasn’t I?”
“Step away from me! Do it now John or I will shoot you!” Sherlock’s hand was shaking; his whole body was in fact. He could feel his legs becoming weak and soon enough he started to see stuff that should not be there. “Ow great the drug finally started to kick in” Sherlock said to himself. John looked at Sherlock with his warm eyes and stepped a step closer.
Sherlock pressed the sleeping girl tighter to himself as he made a new oath to Mary. And this one he was going to uphold. Even if it meant living, than god knows living was for him way harder than dying.
“But you would have tried. And I think we owe it to Sherlock to try, don’t we?” John knew that this was a low blow, a game for her emotions but he did not see another out. He had to convince her. Sherlock just needed her too much.
John was looking after her, his mind deep in thoughts of how to save his relationship with Sherlock. A sudden little slap got him back to really as Rosy grew tired of just being held. He smiled at her softly and then carried her upstairs. He laid her in her little bed and watched her fall asleep.
Mycroft looked at it and opened his mouth as if to object but then he closed it again. “I know it’s not what he wants but he is too weak to survive this. We need to amputate, the sooner the better. I take full responsibility, but please Mycroft sign it. It’s the only way.” John fixed his look on the Homes brother hoping that he would see reason. Mycroft was destroyed, he didn’t know what to do. He wanted to call his mommy and ask her what to do. He didn’t want this burden on himself. But he knew that John was right. Sherlock was fading away fest so they needed to act. Even if that meant that Sherlock would despise him even more. No he wouldn’t just despise him. Sherlock would hate him for that. But he could live with that if that meant that his baby brother would stay alive.
“Sherlock, it me. I’m real. No one is chasing you. It’s just you and me. Come on, let me help you. You’re save. Sherlock look at me.” John moved in to the eye line of the detective. “Look at me.”
“You can’t run from me, I will always find you!” Sherlock heard the threatening words but he did not give them much thought for he just wanted to run. He could hear his name getting called and someone chasing him. But like hell he was gonna let himself get caught again. No not this time, no matter what he will not become a caged animal again.
“He needs help Mycroft. You need to take him to a facility that can help him. He needs professional help, I’m not good enough this time”
“Mycroft are you alright?” John was really concerned for the older Holmes brother. The whole situation with Sherlock must have really left its mark on him. John often forgot that the hatred of the brothers was only one-sided. Mycroft loved his brother, but he always tried to hide that fact – why John did not know. He never really thought about it up till now.
“Now if you excuse me, I really have to go lay down. I don’t feel well at all.” Without waiting for Johns reply he stood up and made his way to his bedroom. He was leaning heavily on the wall for support as he felt like a little dash of wind could knock him off his feet.
“That basted tired to kill Sherlock with an overdose, and since we all knew that Sherlock was using again it would not have been a surprise if he would have died. No one would have suspected that Sherlock was killed we would just call it an accident or suicide. He was lucky that you came in when you did, or Sherlock really would have died. We found little cameras in the room, supposable placed by Sherlock so we have proof of what that bastard did… he even kind of confessed to everything too. He is going away for a long time.”
“Would that work Dr Watson?” Mycroft’s voice sounded hopeful. I painted John to have to be the barer of bad news.
With those words he turned around and slowly started walking back to his room. He just wanted to fall in to his bed, not caring about anything anymore. John was left standing in the living room, to hurt by the detective’s words to make any real words come out of his own mouth. He tried but all that came out was a deep sob. Tears filled his eyes soon after and his legs felt weak.
“I’m fine John. Don’t worry about me.” His voice was faint and husk, like he had just woken up. Or not slept in days.
“Mycroft called. He told us about it, since Sherlock still hasn’t woken up yet. I have to go, those idiots are doing something stupid again I can feel it. You should get some rest, you look tired.” Greg tapped John on the shoulder and started to walk towards the police men at the other end of the hall. John looked after him before he smiled to himself.
“No of course not. Well anyway I need you to watch Rosie while I’m gone. Like I said I will only be gone for an hour and Mrs Hudson is out shopping and will not return till later in the day. So you are my only option.”
The young detective was still looking fragile, pale skin with small drops of sweat on his forehead indicated that a fewer was running his body. His breath sounded heavy and John was about to check his pupils when suddenly his phone started ringing. Loud rock music started to echo throe the room and further throe the hallway outside. John franticly started to search for the blasted device, cursing under his breath for not putting it on mute the night before. When he finally found it he was already receiving an angry glare form the policeman outside the room and he was sure that a nurse would soon come storming in to lecture him.
“She looks so peaceful when she sleeps” cut Sherlock in before John could finish his thought. His eyes were soft as he was watching the small creature in Johns arm.
And truly his hand got squeeze again. A few moments later Sherlock started to let out soft moans and slowly he opened his bright blue eyes. “John? What -?”
It was a good thing she was sitting or she might have fallen over. All color seemed to fade from her face and her mouth could have hit the ground that’s how wide open it fell.
John looked back to the kitchen again. He saw Sherlock’s frail body bending in an unnatural way, as if he was trying to distribute his weight so that it would take him the least amount of energy to just stand. His razor sharp jaw line and cheek bones were poking out even more than usually. His once steady hand was shaking from the effort of completing a simple everyday task. But he still tried to hide it all. Make John believe that he was fine, that he did not need help. He even dressed in his suit, but it was ill fitting now. It was just loosely hanging from his body, making it seem as if he was a child playing dress up with his father’s clothes.
"Guess that’s his room,” John said to himself and started to walk towards the room. He nodded at the police man and grabbed the door knob. He pushed it and realized it was locked. “Excuse me, why is this door locked?” asked John the police man. The young man stood up and tried to open the door himself. When the door did not open he started to look for a nurse to unlock it. John was becoming a bit nerves and when he heard some weird noise coming from inside he deceit to break down the bloody door. He made a few steps back and then he ran in to the door. The police man tried to stop him at first but then decided to help him. They hit the door three more time before it finally gave in. John quickly ran in to the room just to see Sherlock lying motionless on his bed and all the machines on which he was hooked were shut down or put on mute. From the corner of his eyes John could see someone escaping through a hidden door by the side.
Another hand touched his cheek. This one felt a bit rougher, older. The voice … he know that voice too … “Mother? Father ? What - ” but before he could finish his question the pain shot thru him again like never before. This pain was new. He tried to lift his arm, squeeze it at the point where it hurt but for some reason he couldn’t. He looked down at his right arm and that’s when he realized what had happened. John … His John did this to him. He made him a cripple. This was Johns revenger.
“Has he still not woken up?” John hadn’t been in the hospital for about a week. He had to catch up on his work.
She did not know what he had done to her. She did not understand yet. But one day she will. And then she will hate him. No matter what he did he could not change the fact that he had a hand in Marys death. Sherlock knew this just too well. He did somehow manage to get John back after Mary’s death  (but only with Marys help of course, or batter said with her CD), but he was not sure he could win Rosies love or even just her forgivnes once she found out the truth. And that send shiwers down his spine.
“He wouldn’t leave her alone. I see how he looks at her, like she was his own doughter. He will never say it but I know he loves her and wants to protect her. He wouldn't dare bring drugs in the house now with her exploring each and every corner of it. He even puts his pills on the highs shelf under lock and key so that she could reach them even if she tried. Also I think it will do them good to spend some time together. She always reaches out to him to play with her, but he just dodges her. Now he will have to pay her some more attantion. And also Sherlock needs some more human interaction. Even if it is only with a child.”
“And you left me …” said John in a cold manner. Sherlock slowly looked down, seeing a knife rammed in his stomach and John holding the handle.
“You crazy asshole. He could have killed you … You died … you died just like she did. What the bloody hell were you thinking?” John felt the tears streaming down his face again and this time he did not bother to hide his face in his palms. He grabbed Sherlocks hand and squeezed it tight. His hand was cold and so thin. John felt as if he could break it if he squeezed too tight.
“I just talked to the doctor, and he agrees that the slow decay of the clot is a stupid idea with a way to big risk factor. He just went and put Sherlock in a coma. We can start the amputation in an hour if you just sign this paper.” Said John and handed Mycroft a document.
“It wasn’t supposed to happen! After I stopped Moriarty everything should have been like before I left! After –“
John cursed under his breath as he realized how ignorant he had been of Sherlocks problems - again. The desire to die was not something that would just go away. It stays with you, sneaks in to your mind when you are most vulnerable, when you are already on the ground and feel like you can’t breathe … And once it’s there it never leaves. John knows that. He knows that just too well.
Finally, they arrived. John threw 40 bugs at the driver and was already running in to the hospital before he would get his change. At the end of the corridor he could see Mycroft talk to a doctor. John slowed down his pace and decided to wait till the doctor left to talk to Mycroft.  He observed them quietly and he could tell that the news was bad. There were not many times that the older Holmes brother would quietly listen to someone and not even try to interrupt them. Mycroft was looking at the doctor almost in disbelieve of what he was saying. His mouth was slightly open, his arms crossed over his chest, head slightly tilted to the ground. A typical defensive stance. This really wasn’t good.
“Ok I will do it. But we have to ask Sherlock if he is feeling comfortable with it.” Just as John finished his sentence the door of Sherlock’s room swung open. John peaked his head together with Mycroft and Mrs Hutson in to the corridor to see what was happening. All they could see was a shadow that ran in to the bathroom and then the noise of someone getting violently sick.
When Mary died she died to safe him. By doing so she put a value on Sherlocks life – something that he felt it did not have before. So now he had to ask himself: Did he really have the right to just end it? His life was not his own anymore. It was a gift from Mary. A gift for which she paid dearly.
Also I wanted you to know, that I’m happy that it is you who will take care of them. I trust you Sherlock and I know that you will do anything in your power to keep them safe. I know you love John just as I did.
the hand on his shoulder tightened its grip on him. He was panicking even harder now. He could not take another year of torture; hell he couldn’t even take one more week of it. And the constant fear of John being brought back here to be killed in front of him. No, no that can not happen!
Sherlock is still in the hospiral and unresponsive. Mycroft asks John for help and that's when John learns of Sherlocks' past.
Sherlock send him an annoyed look and set his mug down on the little table next to his chair. “Wait for it. I only have one hand. Can’t bring two at the same time, or have you forgotten?” shot Sherlock as he made his way back to the kitchen.
“He was right. Sherlock was right.” He started to walk back to Sherlocks room where he looked throe the (now broken) door. Sherlock was still lying motionless on the bed. John stepped in to the room and sat down next to Sherlocks bed.
“Yes, yes she does.” Said John in return and looked down at his daughter. A smile made its way on Johns face and Sherlock averted his gaze away from them. He felt as if he had no right to see this moment of happiness.
Suddenly all the voices got quiet as a little lough came thru. Sherlock blinked his eyes a couple of times to focus, just too see little Rosie smiling up at him and cupping both his cheeks.
“Listen up you little half ass of a doctor. I suspect you just came off medical school, and you probably never intubated a person in your life. Now this man need to be intubated because his he could suffocate on his own puke if I don’t put this tube in. Now this is hard enough to do by itself so if you keep on distracting me I swear I will break your bloody nose.” John was saying this as he was still trying to get the tube down Sherlock throat. The young doctor didn’t say anything … he just nodded at the nurses as to say to follow Johns lead. Everything moved very quickly after that. John could see that a nurse hung an extra IV on the stand next to Sherlock and another one administered the naloxone. Soon after that John managed to insert the tube and so he was able to pump oxygen in the detective. After a few seconds he ceased to shake and the machines stopped their frantic beeping.
But John was not disgusted or frightened. He was sad more than anything really. How could he not know about them? How could he not notice them sooner? Its true that Sherlock was always wearing his undershirt, that covered most of the detectives skin, but still (he wore it even in the hospital but that too should have been odd to the doctor) .
“You right, I’m sorry Mrs Hudson. Mycroft I have to -”Just as he was about to tell Mycroft off, his phone started ringing. Mrs Hudson send him an annoyed look and Mycroft just rolled his eyes. He managed to fish his phone out of his pocket and step out on the floor to take the call.
The grip on his shoulders caused him pain. He was scared. His mind was racing, screaming at him that something is off but he could not detect what that something was. He knew that something was not real, but what was it? Was John the fake voice or was it
Now John knows that Sherlock was just putting up a strong front as to not get hurt by others or be seen as weak. Or did he maybe do it to comfort John? His mind was running wild, he wanted to go and scream at Sherlock for not telling him how he felt, for not reaching out. But then again even if he did John was to focus on himself at that time to even notice the seriousness of the situation.
After John left many more people came to his room and made all poseable checks on him. They asked him many question but he did not answer them. He was in his own little world right now. Feeling betrayed by all and disgusted with himself. He could not bring himself to look at his amputated arm, it just felt so strange to him.
“I’m sorry mister Homes, I just wanted to help a nurse with a gone rouge patient and that was when he stormed out the room. He was running so fast I could not get a hold of him. And then I lost him somewhere on the ground floor. We locked the hospital down but he still somehow managed to slip out.”
“Ow shit … I forgot that I have patients today,” John slid his hand down his face and checked the time on his watch. 8:28 am … Damn it, he was so late! And it was so hard to get that job too.
“Come on Rosie calm down, it’s all right,” tried Sherlock again, but his voice was shaky and not calming to the little girl at all. His breathing was out of control and he could feel drops of sweat forming on his forehead. His heart was in his mouth and he felt so on edge.
But why did this Sebastian fellow do all this? Why bother torturing you? Why not just kill you?" thought John to himself, without realizing he actualy said it out loud.
He ran to John, his feet hurting as if he was running on glass. When he finally reached him he put his hands on his shoulders, franticly looking left and right as to make sure
Sherlock wasn’t even on top at the stairs when John was already nagging at him. Sherlock’s feet felt heavy and his nose hurt. He just wanted to get to bed.
But then againit was true wasn’t it? John was selfish at times, but he was not a bad man. No he was always someone who Sherlock secretly admired, even though John had the intellect of what seemed like a monkey. But then again everyone was an even bigger idiot than John in Sherlocks eyes.
Sherlock did not answer in anyway. Another 10 minutes pass in silence and John was thinking if maybe he pushed Sherlock too far with this little experiment.
The pain of his broken nose creeped back in his mind, soon followed by the phantom pain of his arm. Some of his old scars started to throb too…
“Hey, Sherlock? Is everything alright? If you need to talk, I am here for you.” said John in a low voice and Sherlock looked at him again. His eyes were jumping from one end of his face to the other, trying to figure out what he was thinking about.
Slowly John shifted his gaze from the old couple to the hospital bed. One could not even see that Sherlock was missing an arm form this perspective. His right side was turned away towards the window, all that one could see from Johns perspective were all the cables and machines to which Sherlock was hooked on. He slowly stepped to the sleeping detective and gently touched his left hand. The hand was cold to touch and so thin you could feel the bones throe the shin. John turned his gaze to where Sherlock right arm should be, but there was nothing but a hospital sheet. It was so surreal. Did this really happen? Did he really instruct to cut off Sherlocks arm?
“NO! You shall suffer, just like I did. And when you think that you are done, I will come again and again and again, just to make you suffer some more. John, Greg, Molly, that old witch Hudson ... and  of course Rosie too” Sherlock could feel the men’s hand touch him and he tried to get it off himself. He tried to focus his look on the man but his sight was blurry -  he could only see some rough silhouette.
“Don’t be sorry. You are the best and wisest men that I have ever met. You are the one I love. I beg you Sherlock … Stop this. Come on! Come back to me. Give me the gun.” John stretched his hand out toward Sherlock, offering him to give him the gun. John was now just a meter away from him, it looked so close, yet felt so far.
Sherlock never really cared about his life. He never really wanted it – god knows he tried to get rid of it many times. But this time … this time he wanted to end it so that the people he liked … no the people he loved could be finally safe. Safe from him… and safe from his past. He still felt like someone was after him even though Mycroft ensured him that Moriartys network was disabled in all countries. But they never found Moriartys right hand … they never found
“You can’t get rid of me Sherlock. I am part of you.” He could hear Moriartys voice so clearly. Even the lough was spot on, but Sherlock knew that that’s just in his head. It’s all in his head ….
But good news, the next chapter is already half written so it won't take me this long to post again.
“Ow well you know. The morgue is not excektly a place where you take your child to. So I left her home with Sherlock.” Molly was lucky she did not yet take a sip of her drink or she would have spat it out now.
“Mary…” he let the name slip from under his breath like a pray. After that he didn’t even bother interpreting all the other clues on the letter, he just wanted to know what it said.
As soon as she heard Sherlocks name she dropped everything she was doing and was hanging on her phone.
Sherlock eyes looked glassy to John. There were small drops of sweat forming on his face and he was pale, ow so pale. John could see how his shoulders were shaking, and he really had to contain himself from stepping forward and hugging the shaking detective.
“Ow come on Sherlock! Let me play with you! Come on you little shit! Show me what kind of men you are. Show me that brain of yours that got Jim so interested in you! You fucking freak! No, you know what I will bring your little boyfriend here. What was his name? John, was it? I will make that cunt pay for what you did to Jim. I will make him scream your name in pain and I will make you watch. Just as I made you watch me kill all those other fuckers before”
“You want the rattle again?” he asked as if he expected a real answer. She just huffed some more, before Sherlock finally leaned to the side to pick up the toy. He waved it in front of her a couple of times before he gave it back to her.
“Hello, Dr Watson? Yes, where are you? Your 8:05 is waiting here for good 20 min already and frankly I don’t know what to tell them anymore.”
“Like hell you are fine” said John under his breath and fished his phone out of his pocket, careful not to wake up little Rosie in the process. Without even really thinking about it he clicked Mycrofts contact and his fingers just shot over the keyboard.
“But what if he just closes of more?” her voice was faint this time, filled with general concern. A thousand and one thing could go wrong. If she chose the wrong word or if she asked something she shouldn’t have …  it could cause Sherlock to close of completely.
“There is no other way Sherlock. We have to or the dead cells from your arm will poison you!” John knew that Sherlock would not take kindly to the idea but he had to convince his former college that that was his best shoot.
Sherlock did not look at him, but kept looking straight ahead. John waited for a few more seconds before repeating his question.
“You make it sound as if I wanted to do this all those years ago! As if i wanted to hurt you! Abandon you and run! I had to do it otherwise I would have had to bury you!” Tears started to fall down Sherlocks face, his voice trembling just like his whole body. John looked at him with confusion on his eyes. He never really asked Sherlock why he did what he did. Once Sherlock said it was to stop Moriarty and John just accepted it. He never asked of it again and so Sherlock never spoke of it again. Soon Johns expression changed again, realizing what Sherlock meant.
“Could you go and talk to a nurse, please? You are a doctor they will tell you more than me. You know where to press to get the answer you want.” Said the broken Holmes brother fast, feeling another wave of tears burning in his eyes.
“Everything you touch dies, Sherlock. Face it, you are the problem – always have been” The voice started to lough again making Sherlock scream and beg for it to stop. But the voice grew only louder and louder making Sherlock cover his ears and closing his eyes shut in an attempt to escape this torture.
“John I don’t want you to move in permanently, but just till Sherlock gets better. Please you know him best, you will most likely know what he will do next. Doctor I have never in my life begged but now I am begging you to help my brother.” Mycroft looked at John with exhausted eyes. He really needed this.
“Sherlock, please I just want to know the truth. Just tell me why you left me back then. Where did you go to? Why did it take that long for you to come back?”
Women died after drinking from a glass of someone else. No poison could be detected in the glass, yet she didn’t drink or eat anything else. The glass was empty at the time of her death. “God help me they are stupid, the poison was in the ice of the drink! The lid of the cup was opened ... she opened the cup to eat the ice cube in the drink, common habbit. God how boring!” Sherlock screamed and threw the case file in the wall.
“Funny … I thought I heard you pick up the phone before the first alert ... As if you wrote first.” Said Sherlock back, his voice a bit raspy.
John sat down in the chair next to Sherlock bed, letting the nurses take over for him. He was feeling exhausted as the adrenalin started to wear off. He looked up to the young doctor and he couldn’t help but to feel sorry for him. “I’m sorry. I lost my tempura back there –“
“Listen Molly. Do you know something that I don’t know? Because if so do, you need to tell me. For Sherlocks sake.” John gave her a stern look and she tried her best to avoid it. The emphasis on tried.
That was when he remembered that John was in the room too. Swiftly he removed his hand from his face and returned to his perfect straight posture. He tried to ignore Johns look, but he knew that John noticed, that John knew. He didn’t know how much his former friend knew, but he knew something and that was more than Sherlock wanted.
After John managed to convince Sherlock to get checked out by doctors he demanded to be taken home to Baker Street. John tried to talk him out of it but it had no use … Sherlock wanted home.
“You called me selfish when all you ever wanted was for me to be only yours. To be your little play-thing. You destroyed me in every way poseable,” spat John again as he pulled the knife out to deliver the final blow.
“I thing I have been selfish and cold long before Mary died,” said John after a couple of minutes past in silence. His voice sounded broken and another sob escaped just as he mouthed Marys name. Mrs Hudson wanted to say something in protest but John cut her off.
“I let you go.” There was a painted groan in his voice as he ended his sentence, for he knew that this was the last time he saw her.
It’s me again. I know, i know ... even when I’m dead I still haunt you. The last time I spoke to you was thru a CD, but this time I wanted to make it more personal. Well this sounds ridiculous now that I think about it considering I told you to go to hell the last time. But hey I was right, John did save you (or you wouldn’t be reading this), just like I said he would. Ah John, our beloved John … But this time I’m not writing you to safe him. Or to safe anyone for the matter. I’m writing you to ask you for a final favor. I need you to protect the two people that we both love most. I am not there anymore, so I can not protect John from himself or from my past. I can not look after my little darling Rosie, I can’t close her in my arms when she is sad and I can’t sing her to sleep after a bad dream. John will try his best, but we both know John; he will just overwork himself and take everything personally. So I’m asking you Sherlock. Please look out for them. Be by their side, guide them. I know I’m asking a lot of you after everything that you have already done for me. I hope I was able to repay you in some way before I died. And if not I’m sure that John will find a way to repay you instead of me.
“Oh, for the love of-” Sherlock muttered, rolling his eyes as he dropped his own chopsticks, grabbing John’s hand and pulling it up from his food.
John tilted his head, his eyebrows furrowing, but he did not speak and interrupt the thought apparent on Sherlock’s face.
Mycroft paused halfway through leaning his umbrella against the wall. “Good point,” he murmured, and Sherlock’s eyes nearly popped out of his head, not sure the universe could handle an implied ‘I love you’
“Come on, what is it?” she asked, dropping her voice as she stretched closer across the table. “You’ve been low all day.”
“That, in spite of being ambidextrous, people will still use their dominant hand in a high-stress situation.”
“How did you get my phone?” John exclaimed, grabbing at it, but Sherlock tugged it out of reach as he dialed. John sighed, shaking his head. In all honesty, the only thing that surprised him about it was that he wasn’t surprised.
“Dammit!” he cried at himself, lifting his head only to pound it back into the table. He sighed wearily, lifting a hand over his eyes.
Molly chuckled, all awkwardness crumbling with the soft sound. “Okay then! I’ve just got to pay for these and then we can go,” she said, lifting the notebooks in her hands as she turned and headed toward the counter.
Irene beamed, and then turned to Sherlock, who had already been watching her warily, but who now made no attempt to hide it, his eyes narrowing to slits over the lip of his cup. “You’re not doing anything Saturday either, are you, Sherlock?” she asked innocently enough, but there was still a bit more pink in Sherlock’s cheeks than the steam from the coffee could account for.
A short pause later, John heard Sherlock’s signature sigh, the front door creaking open and thumping shut as footsteps began ascending the stairs.
“I’d tell you two to get a room,” Mike interrupted, and John’s eyes shifted to him as Sherlock turned around, “but you’ve already got one.”
“I told you not to buy me anything,” he snapped, John’s drastic leaning out of view not exactly the most subtle of tactics.
“I’m fine, really,” he spluttered, waving a hand out as he nodded fervently. “I just- The heat’s getting to me, I think.” He chuckled, but it sounded high and horrible, so he cut it off, clearing his throat. Ducking his head, he bolted past John toward the door. “I-I think I’ll just go to bed. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I’ll make do. And, besides,” he replied, tipping his head with a smirk, “I’m sure the company will make up for it.”
, and John dropped his chin when he had the presence of mind to, unable to breathe as he watched Sherlock slowly draw back. The boy’s lips were flushed and wet, leaving John’s cock with a sticky
Sherlock shifted on his knees, turning to frown properly at the man, and John crept a few steps closer, Sherlock tilting his head back to hold the searching blue gaze.
“What?” His father lifted his hands in a shrug, and Sherlock sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and shaking his head at the floor.
“I don’t know where the receipt is,” Sherlock lied, not wanting to admit to having been confident enough to throw it away immediately upon exiting the store, “and you need a new watch anyway.”
“You know, those pictures people can make in the froth on top of lattes?” she explained without clarifying anything at all, and his continued confusion must have shown on his expression, as she chuckled softly. “Sometimes it’s just pouring it a certain way—that generally makes hearts, which is mostly what he does—but you can also get really elaborate with it, take a stirrer or some cocoa powder and draw just about anything.”
Sherlock snorted, taking the phone from his tan fingers, warm static leaping from where they brushed. “It doesn’t look hard at all,” he muttered, scrolling down the truly horrendously long list. “We sit on the floor and eat sweets.”

He rattled his head, stowing the mobile in the pocket of his rugby jacket as he settled back into the seat, but found he couldn’t quite get comfortable, a certain restlessness plucking at his muscles. Biting his lip, he glanced at the clock, knee bouncing as his fingers tapped against the smooth leather.
“What!? Where?” John spluttered back, and, as an argument about the validity of descriptive grammar intertwined with statistics on rates of tissue decay, John supposed their kind of normal was one he could absolutely learn to live with.
Sherlock’s smiling face swam in front of his eyes, obscuring the color-coded drawer of silk for a moment.
“He- Nothing happened,” he murmured, tapping the filter of the cigarette against the side seam of his jeans.
Stepping farther into the room, he moved toward the suitcase, scanning the handles in search of a luggage tag, but turned as footsteps approached, John emerging from the kitchen with two steaming cups and a startled expression.
“What about him?” she echoed, leaning forward as muffled voices rose through the floorboards. “He faked his death!”
“It’s alright, Greg,” Sherlock interrupted, past caring if social etiquette allowed as much. “I can understand your…skepticism,” he said, turning back to the prince, “but-”
John recoiled, but only a little, the majority of his dignity remaining intact. “Right,” he snapped, collecting his plate onto the tray and disentangling himself from the table. “Sorry I interrupted your reading. See you in biology.” He turned away, a dark pride swelling in his chest at the venom in those parting words, but Sherlock called after him and ruined his exit.
“Sure they would,” John said earnestly. “They would!” he pressed as Sherlock snorted. “And you’re not a sociopath.”
“You’re welcome,” the blond muttered, shaking his head as Sherlock grinned. “You owe me though,” he added, Sherlock following as he started back up the stairs. “Probably my only chance to see you in plaid trousers: Wasted!”
“But what does the place matter?” John challenged, swallowing a bite of his roast beef. “I mean, it’s good or it’s bad regardless, isn’t it?”
John laughed, leaning back against the door for support, the slip of paper crumpling in his hand as his fist closed around it.
The door to his right swung open, and Sherlock startled up off the wall, standing straight as he scolded his heart for picking up as John appeared. It hadn’t been his proudest moment, cornering John in the bathroom earlier, and, sure, it was
, you must be Sherlock’s roommate!” she said somewhat breathlessly, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “He was compla-” –a sharp cough burst at John’s back- “saying he would have one this year,” she amended quickly, smiling shyly as she shifted her weight.
“Run, Forrest, run!” John’s voice chimed in, Sherlock changing his wave to a middle finger, but he was smiling as he swept out the door, John’s laughter not permitting any other response.
John—because it was John, the tousled hair and vivid blue eyes unmistakable as they caught the moon—tilted his head, smiling softly across at him, but there was no mirth in it, the gesture little more than a miserable twist of his mouth.
John frowned at the back of his head, but, upon realizing he wasn’t that hungry yet either, merely walked past him to the fridge. “I’ll leave ‘em in here. We can eat la- WHAT THE HELL!?”
Sherlock belatedly realized he was smiling, not having given his muscles permission, and then he was laughing, so suddenly, John looked mildly concerned. “’Ralph-bloody-Lauren’,” he quoted through his laughter, and John raised an eyebrow. He calmed himself into a chuckle, shaking his head. “Fine,” he said, smiling at his still-perplexed friend, “I will purchase a pair of jeans, if it’s really so important to you.”
was that?” Lestrade spat as he burst into the observation room, and it was obvious he would have been shouting if not for the potential fault of the soundproofing. “How does this- this…new supplier know who you are? Because, I swear to god, Sherlock, if you’ve started using again-”
Sherlock sighed, closing his eyes at the interior of his locker as he steeled himself. “What?” he muttered, pushing the door shut as he turned, coming face-to-face with Elliot Newton, the suspiciously massive fullback for the rugby team.
Lestrade chuckled breathily, clapping John on the shoulder as he passed by to the interrogation room, package of tissues in hand.
“John?” he murmured, and the scruff of the blond’s chin brushed against his forehead, a small tilt of his head to indicate his attention. “What-What you said a-about you…loving people. Did-Did you mean-”
“He always does, dear,” Mrs. Hudson sighed, popping the rest of her coke bottle into her mouth. “He always does.”
Sebastian Moran lay on the plush carpet of the lounge, his blood dripping onto the grey in scarlet splotches.
“Hudson not workin’ ya too hard, then?” the voice asked again, and John winced, the knife twisting into his back almost tangible.
John dropped the bag he was working on, a few beans pattering over the counter as he spun around, practically throwing himself over the cash register. He checked his watch again, 4:48 looking back at him, and then lifted his chin just in time to see the light come on in one of the second story windows of the building across the street, right on time, as always.
He wouldn’t say it was panic; panic was something experienced when confronted with the unfamiliar, when a sudden shift in the world sent you spiraling down a well you could not see the bottom of. No, this was not panic, this was dread, the quiet dread that came with knowing the inescapable inevitable was bearing down on you like a freight train, and you had tied yourself to the tracks.
Sherlock watched the spot his brother had last occupied, not quite sure where else to look. John was still standing beside him, close enough to give rise to the hairs on the back of his neck, and he channeled his nervous energy into reaching for one of the pastries, nibbling at the crust to distract his mouth from saying something stupid.
“Any aches and pains? Feeling at all dizzy or light-headed?” he continued playfully, and Sherlock couldn’t entirely deny the last one, but not for the reasons John meant.
“No, you ‘prefer to text’,” he mocked, and Sherlock smiled, settling further into the bed, John’s voice already starting to calm him. “So, what is it? What’s wrong?”
Sherlock had no idea what his face was doing, but he was glad John was too far gone to interpret it. “Thank…you…?” he replied, and John nodded like that was just the right thing to say, cheek scraping against the sheet in soft rustles.
“Er, yeah, sure,” John replied, gently closing the door before rounding the car, dropping into the driver’s seat just as Sherlock closed the passenger door.

!”—he knew, no matter what no-doubt-grander oddities lay ahead, he’d never edit out a single word of it.
“I’m not, I’m...having a stroke?” he muttered, and Irene laughed, John giving Sherlock a sheepish shrug he only shook his head at.
John huffed a laugh, shaking his head down at the offending article, but did take it with him as he slid off the bed. “Fine,” he sighed, twisting at the cloth until he had it pointed the right way, and then tugged it over his head, flapping his arms through the sleeves. He pulled the hem down over his holey white t-shirt, twisting at the cuffs to align the seams properly down his arms before brushing the static from his hair. “Well?” he asked, lifting his arms in a weak flick as he looked up.
“You talked to Mrs. Hudson!?” Sherlock spouted, snapping his head up with a glare, but the inspector didn’t falter, jaw stiffening as he steadily met his gaze.
He turned, certain the anxious leap in his chest had broken through to his expression, but Mycroft was carefully avoiding his eyes, gazing at a fixed point in the crowd. “Who?” he asked, Mycroft’s sharp glance chiding him for being tiresome, and then dropped his face to his empty glass, swirling the last milliliter of liquid one never could manage to drain. “Mrs. Hudson?”
He shrugged. “I don’t know,” he admitted, although he wasn’t particularly concerned about it. The worst part, as far as he figured it, was over. The details could all be ironed out in the morning. Or whenever. He didn’t really care so long as he got to sleep. “But we’ll figure it out,” he added reassuringly, smiling sleepily at the still-disturbed detective. “For now,” he strained, shifting down the bed as he wrestled the blankets up to his shoulder, “I’m gonna go to sleep.”
John stopped texting at some point, presumably having gone to sleep, and, shortly after, they arrived at Langley, Sherlock stepping out of the car and away without a word. The officer lingered, however, the headlights passing in at least two circles before Sherlock reached the Kingsley House door, and he cast a glance back as he entered, shooting a glare that was likely lost on the man due to the distance. His steps grew heavier as he drew near the dorm room, exhaustion finally catching up with him, and he had nothing more planned than collapsing onto their now-double bed as he opened the door, flicking on the light before his stomach dropped out.
“Hey, John?” said a voice to his left, and he turned, finding Molly standing in the narrow corridor leading from the kitchen, a laden tray balanced between her shoulder and wrist. “Do you mind taking this to table 12? My arms just don’t have it in ‘em anymore,” she sighed, shaking her head exhaustedly, and John chuckled, curling his fingers in beckoning as he approached.
Sherlock closed his eyes against the memory, resting his skull against the wall as he steadied his breaths, gradually slowing his heartrate to something less incapacitating. Opening his eyes, he blew out a last long breath, lifting free of the wall as he wiped his bloodied hand on the side of his jeans, shaking loose the brick to rain on the ground. He hitched his backpack up from where it had slid down his shoulder as he headed across the car park, eyes fixed forward, and, if a black A40 Devon passed him on the way out, he pretended not to notice.
“Call me Greg,” the man said quickly, and then cleared his throat, a signal of forthcoming solemnity. “There’s something you need to know, John. I-I shouldn’t tell you. I shouldn’t tell anyone, really, but you’re living with him, and…well, I worry.” Lestrade swallowed hard, shifting his weight between his feet. He sucked in a lungful of air, releasing it with determination before fixing his eyes on John’s. “Sherlock got into some…
Pale eyes, more green than grey in this light, focused in on him, and John could feel himself being read.
Mike cringed in sympathy, and then lifted a hand. “Well, see ya tomorrow then,” he bade, John returning the gesture with a nod, and then waved out at the table at large, several groggy farewells following him down the corridor as he, Sherlock, and Irene made their way to the car park.
“Yes,” Sherlock snapped, and John grinned down into his Coke can, “and then she slapped me when I informed her that tossing her drink was the pettiest, most stereotypical thing she could possibly have done.”
Sherlock’s mind scrambled to find something to do, something to say, somewhere to hide, but John was already there at his shoulder, Sherlock’s window of opportunity closed now that his dulled senses had failed to identify his approach.
Sherlock stumbled putting on the second leg of his trousers, catching himself on the edge of the bed, and John must have heard the commotion, as he promptly burst into laughter. Grumbling to himself, Sherlock finished getting dressed and flung open the door, hopeful John would still be leaning on it and fall in, but he had moved away, smirking up at Sherlock from the opposite side of the corridor. Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him, but John only chuckled, bobbing his head in beckoning as he headed down the hall.
“Just try not to, okay?” he repeated, and, when it became clear he would say no more, Sherlock simply nodded. Mycroft’s smile broadened, a hand reaching out to twitch the newspaper hat back to level where it had begun to tilt on Sherlock’s head. “Now,” he pronounced, turning toward the pantry as he tossed a grin over his shoulder, “about these pancakes…”
“At,” John corrected, smiling brightly, the kind of smile that really didn’t require a hug, thank you very much. “And yes.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Sherlock retorted, lifting an imperious brow, and the woman glared at him. Sherlock sighed, shaking his head to further drive home the point of their incompetence. “Really, must I do everything? It’s grotesquely apparent that this man was-”
Sherlock accepted the cup with a nod and a grunt, and then they both turned back to the board, staring down the names and faces.
“No,” the taller boy growled, shoving his hands in his pockets in a dramatic sulk, and John ducked his head before his smile gave him away.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something white come flying toward him, and he spun around, stepping back as he lifted a hand to catch-
The flat was silent for a long minute in his wake, the liquid over Sherlock’s Bunsen burning bubbling in the stillness, a sick, gurgling sound that sounded thunderous in the taut air.
“Oh, please,” Molly muttered, rolling her eyes as she pushed back in her rolling chair, folding her arms over her chest and shaking her head at him. “You haven’t done a client interview in
“No! Don’t be absurd,” he snapped haughtily, turning away to stare across at the window with a flick of his curls. “I’m not
“Woah, John, hey!” Mike muttered urgently, and John turned his head just enough to be able to meet his friend’s eyes out of the corners of his own. Mike cast a glance back over his shoulder, then lifted his head up slightly, looking to the seats ahead and behind them before bowing back down to John. “I-I didn’t mean to- You don’t have to tell me anything.”
“Started the first year of secondary school,” he explained, dropping the finished bags into the box while Sherlock put another portion of popcorn in the microwave. “Mum moved into London the summer before so we could go to a better school. She wanted me and Harry to try out everything, but rugby’s the only thing that stuck for me. Although, I did play clarinet for a few years,” he recalled, shrugging when Sherlock snapped his face up. “Jazz band,” he added, and Sherlock laughed, shaking his head down at the popcorn as it started to rattle.
Sherlock saw the moment the question occurred to John, and quickened his pace, trying to get that little bit further before he had to answer.
“How should I know?” Sherlock snapped. “I didn’t write the damn thing. Now will you just check my lines?”
“Sherlock got a comment on his blog,” he said, scanning between them, Sherlock’s expression shifting to concern while everyone else blinked at him like he was coming unhinged.
John, wanted to count the creases around his eyes when he laughed, to work out the average amount of time it took him to fall asleep, to finally make sense of what prompted him to switch between grape and strawberry jelly at apparently random intervals. He wanted to have him, to keep him, to never again give the world the chance to see what it had missed, but you couldn’t exactly ask someone to never go outside without their hand in yours for the rest of their life, so Sherlock would just learn him, reconstruct John in his mind for as long as he was his.
John peered into the dark interior, but all he could see in the shaft of light entering through the opening was a pair of polished, black shoes and the hems of grey trousers hovering above them.
John snapped his head around with wide eyes, catching Sherlock sharp glare of disapproval, but Irene’s good humor appeared unaffected, her laugh chiming through the air.
Lestrade’s smile didn’t falter, and John wondered just how long the two had worked together in order for that immunity to be formed. “We’ll have to test the blood first, but if it comes back as the victim’s, that should be enough for an arrest warrant,” he said, flipping out his phone and texting furiously. “I’ve got something else back at the Yard I wanted you to take a look at, too.”
“Sherlock,” John breathed, a plea, a question, and Sherlock felt the liquid brimming at the edge of his eyelids, knowing he had to leave now or he’d be caught for sure.
“I- John-” He shook his head down at the carpet, but John only moved further into the room, clenching and unclenching his shaking hand beside his thigh.
Somehow, she was surprised, her eyes widening, her mouth opening as if to speak, but John brushed past her, cutting off any further interaction.
Mycroft and Lestrade both glanced at John, a mixture of pity and encouragement wrapped up in their weak smiles and creased brows.
Harry then hesitated, mouth opening and closing a few times as her face grew taut with thought. “John?” she finally said, looking up at him through the tops of her eyes. “I know it won’t make any difference, I know you’ll do it anyway, but I just wanna say…” She lifted her face, eyes sad and focused. “Don’t go back,” she pleaded, shaking her head softly. “You’re better here, I can tell,” she continued, and he dropped his eyes from her desperate ones. “Don’t let her pull you back in.”
His foot tapped against the dark hardwood as he waited. The mobile had been silenced, but he snapped it up as soon as it illuminated moments later.
“It’s cold,” John snapped, tugging his rugby jacket tighter around his body, “and you’re just jealous you didn’t bring your coat.”
“With all due respect, Your Highness,” Sherlock snipped, wide blue eyes blinking toward him, “if that were true, I wouldn’t be here.”
The detective came up short, looking around John as he tried to see through the window in the door behind him.
“Platonically!?” John spluttered, half chuckling as he twisted his face toward him over top of a pitcher of steaming milk. “Who the hell writes
“Come on,” John beckoned, jerking his head out toward the room as he placed a light hand on Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock allowed himself to be steered away, perplexed by the wink Irene flashed him as he departed. “Sorry about that,” John muttered up into his ear, his hand regretfully falling away. “I told her to watch for you while I was helping restock the bar. Last resort, I swear.”
Sherlock’s eyes were more blue than green now, but the same steely, silver undertones flickered beneath the color. There was nothing accusing about that gaze, nothing surprised or alarmed, just the calm that comes with knowing.
“Because there’s no way I’d get rid of them altogether,” Sherlock rambled on, a swallow bobbing down his throat. “That would be ridiculous. But it would be better to have them nearby.”
Sherlock huffed a disbelieving laugh, shaking his head at the man’s retreating back. A cold wet nose pressed into his palm, Bonny abandoning the stick in favor of attention, and Sherlock chuckled, pinning her head against his thigh as he massaged her ear.
“It was time for him to go,” his mother had said, squeezing back against his quaking fingers, and Sherlock could smell her lavender hand lotion even now if he closed his eyes. “He had to find a new place, somewhere bigger with more swans.”
After half the toast and a full cup of coffee, John was starting to look a little less like a corpse, and got up to get his own second cup, though not without a grimace, free fingers massaging his forehead. “God, what
“Seriously?” John muttered, lifting his brows at the man. “You do realize you just set me up for one of those corny ‘I’m not most people’ lines, right?”
“You’re not entirely incompetent,” Sherlock shrugged. “I’m sure your- What do you call it? ‘Gut’ could narrow it down a bit.”
interrupted John’s laugh, and Sherlock turned to see a different bartender placing a trio of drinks on the bar.
“You know what I mean, Sherlock,” John interrupted, but it was gentle now, an indulgent smile on his lips.
John smiled, that appearing enough of an explanation, and then disappeared, two cups clinking down onto the counter a few moments later. “So,” he said as the cutlery drawer rattled, “how was your night?”
“Hyperbole, Sherlock, we’ve talked about this,” John snapped over his shoulder, and the brunette bit his lip around a smile as he lifted his cup to hide it. “I told them the coach left at 4:30
Sherlock was frozen, his torso half-turned toward John where he’d been pacing. His lips were parted softly, eyes wide and flashing, and John watched as the pupil slowly swallowed the flint, something twisting sharp and hot in the pit of his stomach at the sight.
Sherlock hummed, certainly already having known that, but John appreciated the restraint in not showing off, and shot a small smile up at him. “What?” Sherlock snapped, eyebrows creasing.
“I’m not just going to disappear because you say so. I’m not going to move out and ignore you and pretend none of this ever happened, and, honestly, I don’t even think you really want me to.”
“I told you, this man wasn’t shot. He was dead long before those shots were ever fired, probably by our killers after they were done staging the scene. Look at the bruising patterns.” He pointed down to the front of the man’s legs, where, quite clearly, the skin was discolored. “The blood settled twice. Once when he was lying on his front somewhere on the grounds after he was
He should have just left it at deodorant, he knew it, and scowled at himself as he tugged at the collar of his jumper, sending a fresh wave of cologne rolling up his nostrils.
Sherlock, of course, hadn’t quite seen it the same way, muttering under his breath like a petulant child the entire way back to the dorm, frustrated that John had insisted he wait in the locker room so as not to be alone on the pitch for even the small amount of time it would take John to change. ‘It smells like sweat and ignorance,’ he had said, wrinkling his nose in distaste as he’d watched boys flicking towels across one another’s backsides.
“In here,” came an airy voice from the living room, and Moran followed the sound, stepping through the wide archway of the spacious flat—a modern, glass-encased penthouse looking out over the flickering London lights.
John frowned, looking up at the window to see Sherlock gaping down at him, and was just opening his mouth to ask if there was an axe murderer behind him or something when his words caught up with him, the feeling probably fairly similar to being axe-murdered though.
John had said it all the time, any time, at whatever small opportunity afforded to him in the weeks since the revelation, and Sherlock had never managed to be brave enough, never given that moment back to him. And now he never would.
“Sherlock,” he urged, hands stretched out toward the detective, but not quite touching, afraid to prompt even further lashing out, “it’ll be alright. You’ll figure it out, I know you will. Maybe- Maybe you just need a break.”
“Need any bubble wrap?” Sherlock drawled through a smirk, and John quirked a brow, holding the man’s gaze as he slowly slid a picture frame off the shelf.
Sherlock had looked back to follow her exit, but now turned to John, one dark brow twisting up toward his still-damp curls. “The ‘M’ word?” he muttered, and John chuckled, glancing down at the counter between them as he scrubbed a hand up the back of his neck.
Everyone froze, gaping in wide-eyed shock into the silence before John’s resigned sigh ushered in the storm.
Sherlock chuckled, having a second go at the cigarette, and, though it still burned his throat a bit more than he thought it ought to, at least he didn’t cough.
“I told you that shirt wouldn’t be warm enough,” he chided, bobbing his head down at the long-sleeved garment beneath John’s rugby jacket, and John glared at him even as his arms tightened around his body against the chill. “It’ll be at least another week before you can retire those hideous jumpers, assuming the April averages hold true.”
Sherlock quirked a brow. “Customer service isn’t terrible enough already?” he quipped, and John laughed, opening the driver door before closing the back one so as not to cut off the conversation.
Sherlock flicked his wrist a little harder than before, the swans having to double back to fetch the morsel. “So
“This one’s still not working,” he said, pressing his hand to different sections of the heater. “Have to stop by the office and leave a message for Aaron again.”
It was a brisk spring day, the fingertips of winter still clinging to the air, and the park was nearly vacant as a result, the only other people in sight an elderly couple walking arm-in-arm, but they quickly rounded a bend in the path, leaving Sherlock alone. Well, almost alone, two adult swans lingering some distance from shore in front of him, and half of Sherlock’s mouth curled up at the familiar sight, watching the birds ruffle their wings.
Sherlock lifted his head from the tips of his fingers, twisting to look up at the boy smirking down at him.
Sherlock’s arm snapped out in front of him, a frail barrier John nevertheless froze in the face of, though Sherlock’s face was still directed at the door, what little John could see of his eyes cold and far away. “Sit down,” he ordered, not unkind, but not to be argued with, and John took a wide step back, tucking himself firmly into the far corner of the sofa. Sherlock folded his arm back into his lap, spine ramrod straight, and then his shoulders slumped with a heavy sigh, head hanging as a hand raked back through his curls. “I have questions,” he said simply, chin turning toward his shoulder, a single stony iris peering out from the corner.
Sherlock considered he might be choking on a chip, but it was just his throat constricting. He didn’t say anything, though, didn’t even attempt to, and, after a minute, John continued.
He didn’t see the need to respond, considering they were both perfectly well aware that Mycroft had bought the building in Mrs. Hudson’s name so she could stay close to Langley.
!” he shouted, prompting a startled yip from Mrs. Hudson before the woman turned away, clicking back down the corridor toward the stairs.
John smiled, but it was stiff, the tension not releasing from his eyes. “No, it’s- It can wait til the morning.”
“You should go,” Sherlock advised, nodding down at the mobile, continuing on before John could put voice to his shaking head. “I can eat with Mrs. Hudson; head back as soon as my clothes are my dry.”
“No, she’s not,” Sherlock said firmly, and John, for one, was convinced, shuffling along the fringes of the conversation on the pretense of re-rolling silverware on a nearby table that had recently been reset.
He typed in the password—Iwant221believe, one of John’s few joys in life being changing his password to something Sherlock had to work to remember—and waited for the previous session to load. Several tabs were open, John gleaning from the titles that all of them related to stages of maggot development, and he quickly minimized the one left on the screen, shouting across the room with a grimace.
For a tense moment, Sherlock simply watched her, Harry staring right back, and John looked between them, wondering what silent exchange he was missing.
“I-” Sherlock stammered, shakily releasing John’s arm from his grip, “I’m not so certain we should attend after all.”
John had almost given up on Sherlock coming to English at all when he strode in, his bag swinging violently out from where it banged against his legs. It almost hit John’s shoulder, but he dodged at the last second, pulling away from his conversation with Mary to twist awkwardly in his chair. He shot a glare back at Sherlock, but the boy merely flounced down dramatically into his desk and began rummaging through his bag.
“You. I’m secretly in love with you and dating men with similar features in an attempt to get it out of my system.”
The man had been bouncing around his head all night, his smug face and sarcastic inflection twisting into his dreams, a haunting specter of dark hair and glinting gray eyes. Even the thought of him quickened John’s blood, heat blooming in his palms and scratching at his cheeks. He was so…
“I can’t tell you!” she exclaimed, and the flare in her gaze showed her resolve was absolute. “If you want to know so badly, you’ll have to ask him.”
“You’re up,” he said, flicking the point of his foil at Kavi, who grimaced, grabbing at his right knee with a palm.
John awkwardly lowered himself into position, his head lolled against the rim of the bath in a rather natural, resting pose.
“We’re going out shopping after lunch, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson interjected from where she was needlessly tidying the few things John had dropped on top of the dresser the night before. “If you’d like to come.”
The horn honked again, and Sherlock hissed an exasperated sigh over his shoulder, waving a hand at the car before turning back.
With Molly and him both working towards advanced degrees, however, they needed help. Enter Irene Adler, fresh from Barts with a masters in clinical psychology and a professional interest in their numbers-first approach, though she would later admit to starting to enjoy the job after half a bottle of tequila at the first office Christmas party—a forgiving name for the three of them breaking in their new office with a tiny TV and nonstop cheesy Christmas movies.
He needed him to make obvious observations so Sherlock could find the hidden ones, to remember how long it had been since he’d last eaten, to patiently explain pop culture references, to understand his jokes, to know he wanted the extra blanket even when he denied it, to tell him he was fantastic instead of freakish, and to never
“No, you don’t,” Anderson snapped, still genuinely curious, and John wondered how the man could possibly not see where this was going.
“I can’t eat until I solve this case!” Sherlock snarled, his hands shaking slightly as he held the photographs over his face.
Sherlock snorted, attempting to twist his hand free, but Victor held fast, his other hand providing reinforcements as he clasped them around Sherlock’s fingers like a prayer.
“I dunno,” John replied, shrugging as he leafed through his limited options for neckwear, “it was kind of a longshot. And then I ended up with you for a roommate.” He turned to the brunette, flashing his most dazzling grin. “Doesn’t get much luckier than that.”
“Thank you,” John chirped, and Sherlock snorted as he finished swallowing it down. “No, drink a bit more,” John said, bobbing his head at the glass as Sherlock made to hand it back. “You have to stay hydrated.”
Sherlock frowned at the side of John’s face, uncertain if it was a trick of the firelight making it look pinker than normal. “Like what?”
“Good luck,” Sherlock breathed, and then returned his violin to its case, stowing it back in the dusty corner where it belonged.
“Echo, yes,” John snapped, his face taut with irritation, but it relaxed as he took a deep breath.  John always got rather tense before a game, but, of course, completely denied this tendency any time Sherlock mentioned it. “Why do you have the plays on your phone?” he asked, probably forgetting his original train of thought with Devon, not that he’d admit to that either.
The script was consistent, the blocking perfected, the players passing in and out on cue, and Sherlock’s only part was to remain silent, a body lent to the chorus to hover in the background of John’s love life.
“Shut up,” John muttered, and Sherlock laughed, John smiling grudgingly at the back of his head as they made their way down to the first floor.
“Okay,” John puffed, wrestling with the plastic bag as he approached the table. “One sausage roll and chips. If you’re up for it,” he added, lifting a brow as he looked down at Sherlock.
With a sigh, he fell back onto his pillow, blinking up at the ceiling, but sleep did not come, his mind roaming, anxious and unfocused without John there to steady it. He thought about going somewhere, his legs restless with the couple days’ inactivity, but where would he go without John; where would be
Sherlock was still a moment, staring at the space John had just occupied as he tried to piece together what was happening. Was John mad at him? Did he think Sherlock had had something to do with that man flirting with him? But surely it had been obvious Sherlock hadn’t had any interest, and John had said unwilling participants. He hadn’t done anything wrong, he hadn’t, and he was all ready to defend himself when John came bursting back in, closing the door behind him before twisting around.
“I don’t give compliments very often,” he defended, only making John laugh harder. “I’m rather out of practice.”
“I know,” Sandra said, and then sighed, rattling her head. “I know,” she echoed, more firmly this time, as if confirming it to herself. “It’s just-”
“Not particularly, I don’t think,” he replied, and Molly turned a smug smile on a blushing Mary. “At least, he’s never mentioned it. Why?”
“I know,” Mike interrupted, smiling gently when John peeked back up at him, “but you didn’t have to. I- You’re my best friend, John.” He leaned a little closer, dropping his voice to a whisper between them. “I- There’s some things you can just…
“Okay,” Sherlock began, still watching his friend curiously. “Then Helena and Hermia talk for a while, and your next line is right after… Ah! Take comfort: he no more shall see my face; Lysander and myself will fly this place. Before the time I did Lysander see, seem'd Athens as a paradise to me: O, then, what graces in my love do dwell, that he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell.”
They walked in silence out the main door, exasperation flowing out of Sherlock in almost visible waves.
“Blocking?” John parroted, raising his brows. “We’re performing a scene in front of the class, not putting on
“I- The last time we- That night,” he finally settled on, looking at Sherlock uncertainly, as if there was any conceivable way he could have forgotten, “I-I didn’t mean- If I- If I made you…uncomfortable-”
“I’ll try to keep that in mind,” the brunette replied, smiling, and then they lapsed into silence, avoiding one another’s eyes.
The woman quirked a brow at him, pulling the apparently empty carton from her lips before dropping it down to the red cafeteria tray. “What’s the tale, nightingale?” she quipped, folding her arms on the edge of the table as she leaned toward him. “I’ve been talking to you for the past five minutes, and I don’t think you’ve heard a word.”
“Great!” Mary chirped, bouncing up, reaching over to snatch her projectile paperback from the floor by John’s chair. “I’ll see you guys later then!”
Bonny sat beneath them, expectant gaze shifting from one to the other, a clump of dirt caught on her chin.
Sherlock was staring at the pictures of the victims night and day, going over every millimeter of them with a magnifying glass until his eyes were washed red, and then he would snarl, sliding the instrument across his desk and railing against the limitations of his body. John would nothing short of manhandle him into bed then, gripping tightly to the detective’s waist as he held the ever-thinning body against his, but, without fail, Sherlock would be gone in the morning, back in his lab hissing down the phone at Lestrade.
“Oh, yes,” Greg said, pausing a moment as the alarm on the carousel buzzed, announcing its intent to jar to life. “The castle is just outside the capital. Most of the staff live there with their families rather than stay on the grounds. Which reminds me.” He turned to Molly, leaning his forearm on the trolley, and Sherlock moved past him to watch for their bags as the first thumps of luggage hit the metal band. “The Queen insisted Sherlock stay at the castle so he could keep them apprised of his progress and spend more time with the prince”—he turned a smile to Sherlock—“but you have the option to stay in town, if you would like. I thought you might prefer that.” He shifted his weight between his feet uncertainly, shoulders slumped, but swiftly straightened as Molly gasped with delight.
“Er,” said a voice from the doorway, and Mrs. Watson released him, both of them turning to find John and Harry blinking at them in confusion. “What did we miss?” John asked, looking between them, Harry peering curiously over his shoulder.
“Well, no,” John mumbled down at the floor before lifting his head again, a determined smile on his face, “but staying in the hotel is fun! I went with the team last year all the time, and it was always a riot.”
“I’m sorry to have woken you,” he interjected, keeping his head turned from John as he adjusted the blankets. “It won’t happen again. Now, if you’ll excuse me”—he laid down on his side, pulling the duvet up over his shoulder as he spoke to the wall—“I’d very much like to get back to sleep.” He steadied his breathing, trying to calm his heart enough to be able to hear over it, the soft sounds of John’s breath and rustling of his clothes being smothered by the rhythmic beat.
John turned his hands up in the air in a helpless gesture, and then mumbled in a vaguely rhythmic sort of way. “I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell.”
“9:30,” Sherlock answered, and John moved back to leaning up against the headboard. “Mrs. Hudson has breakfast planned for 10.”
Sherlock was standing in the entrance, leaning out and scanning with narrowed eyes down either side of the street
“I just- I wanna make sure you know,” she said softly, looking up at him through the tops of her eyes. “He’s- John’s special,” she continued, her gaze far away as she turned to look out toward the locker room, and Sherlock didn’t even check this time, stunned by the sudden quiet sincerity that had settled in around them. “I need to know that you understand that,” she urged, looking back to him, eyes fierce and voice stern, and Sherlock closed his mouth, countless witty retorts recoiling from his lips.
“Put your hands over mine,” he ordered, nodding his head down toward where his tan fingers rested over the plastic surface.
Following the direction he had last seen John go when they made their great escapes from sentiment several minutes ago, he found himself in the corridor, but there was no figure visible either side in the dim light. Assuming that John would likely, even subconsciously, head in the direction of his favorite vending machine—“The other one only has Tyrell’s!”—he made a right, following the hall toward the appropriate turn. Just before he reached the corner, he slowed, his attention drawn by loud noises bouncing between the walls ahead.
Mycroft lowered in a second later, his door closing in time with Sherlock’s, and then they all simply sat there, Mycroft looking at Sherlock in the rearview mirror, Sherlock looking at John, and John looking out the window, the light from a nearby streetlamp yellowing his flat features. Mycroft then turned the key, the engine revving to life, and he turned his head as little as possible to back out of the Watson’s driveway.
“Did you hear that?” Sherlock snapped back into the phone, and then scowled, his eyes flicking back up to John for a moment. “Well of course he’s here, where else would he be?”
“Mr. Holmes,” the man crooned, reaching past John to take Sherlock’s hand, his palms clammy. “Lord Chaplin. An honor to meet you, truly. I read your interview in
Maybe Sherlock had just died. Maybe Moran had shot him after all, and this was his hyper-realistic heaven. Or, perhaps, his hell.
“Because you’re always bothering me when I’m trying to work,” Sherlock said haughtily, but he was smiling as he disentangled himself from the chair, striding back to his experiment.
He quickly collected himself, however, swallow bobbing down his throat as he shifted the ball between his hands. “Coming!” he called, glancing back for barely a blink before he turned, jogging across to his impatiently waiting teammates and finally allowing Sherlock to breathe.
18 and a half minutes later, the cab squeaked to a stop in front of Scotland Yard, and John clamored out, eyes darting between the lit windows of the building’s shadowed facade. “Cheers,” he bade, passing a handful of notes through the window, and then jogged toward the warm sanctuary of the main doors, catching a glimpse of the cabbie shaking his head as he pulled away behind him.
stepping out,” she remarked, and Sherlock’s stomach leapt as his hand froze, cigarette hovering just short of his lips. “Can’t blame her for being right.”
“Why not?” John whispered back as the lights above them flicked off, eyes blinking rapidly as he adjusted to the sudden darkness.
So they returned to the fire, eyes angled to the sky in-between bites, and a complex rating system quickly developed, ranking the desserts in several categories until a clear winner emerged—a salted caramel and chocolate parfait that John said he wanted to be buried with.
Sherlock was mostly just a blurry silhouette through his lashes, but he could still make out the sharp tilt of the dancer’s head as he drew closer to the counter’s edge. “What are you talking about?” he asked, drawing even nearer when John did not reply. “What do you mean?”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow at him, glancing exactly where he would see John sleeping on the sofa if there wasn’t a wall between them, and Sherlock valiantly fought down a blush. “Grown rather fond of our Mr. Watson, have you?”
, but I didn’t- I just wanted you to know,” he echoed, taking a deep breath, voice steadying as he lifted his chin, “and then maybe...someday...if you can forgive me...” He trailed off with a shrug, grinding a hand over the back of his neck. “I dunno,” he breathed, shaking his head, and Sherlock bit hard at the inside of his lip, a vicious civil war tearing him apart.
Walking across the hall, he gathered his pillows and blankets up from the laboratory floor and carried them back, tossing them in a heap onto his mattress. With little time left until John returned, he hastily spread the bedding out in a semblance of proper and burrowed underneath, heart jumping with every sound that reached his ears as he waited.
John frowned up at the side of Sherlock’s face, the moonlight setting his pale skin in stark relief against the backdrop of the night. “Wait, are you- You’re saying you think someone snuck into her window to drop a hair dryer into her bath?”
“Hey!” a young officer shouted at him as he made to duck under the police tape. “Get back! Nobody’s allowed in here!”
There, nestled between the blacks and navies of Sherlock’s footwear, was what must pass for a drug toolkit, and John’s fists clenched so hard, they cracked. There was a rubber tourniquet shoved neatly between the rows, a still-wrapped syringe placed beside it, and, at the bottom, a small clear vial that glistened in the overhead light, liquid sloshing prismatically within.
Maybe that was all true. Maybe he didn’t deserve John. Maybe he really was a freak, a sociopath, a broken arrangement of flesh and bone that no one could ever get close to without coming away with scars, but John wanted him. Against all odds, John wanted him, and maybe…maybe that in itself made him worth something. Maybe Mycroft had been wrong, maybe love wasn’t a weakness, not when it came from John Watson. John Watson, who was so loyal, so clever, so
“What do you have for chardonnay?” the man asked, dropping his eyes from John as he redundantly snatched the wine list from the center of the table.
“Molly knew the building, and the janitor knew what room you usually used,” he explained, scraping a stool up as he faced Sherlock across the gap between the tables. “Nice guy, just became a grandpa on Wednesday. His son had a daughter, Isabelle. He’s got, like, thirty pictures on his phone.” He turned, bending down one side of the paper bag as he began unloading white Styrofoam takeaway boxes and bags of plastic cutlery.
Sherlock shook his head. “No. Not really, anyway,” he expounded with a shrug. “He told me what he wanted; I just had to go in and buy it. Asked the woman at the counter which one she thought would be best.”
“Christ, Sherlock,” she breathed, coming up to his side, her head shaking up at him in his peripheral vision. “You are the
“We’ll be back tomorrow afternoon,” John said, shaking off the conversation as he knelt down to zip his bag. “Eat the rest of that soup tonight, and don’t forget to drink plenty of water. There should be enough medicine to get you through, but you can text Molly if you need anything; she knows you’re gonna be here by yourself.”
“Did you move?” John asked, brow furrowing as Sherlock shook his head. “Then won’t it take you, like, half an hour to walk home?”
“No, but she’s having some trouble with the formulas and, ya know, with my taking maths,”—she stood, shrugging—“it’s a little fresher in my mind.”
“Good,” he replied, nodding deeply. “One of us should,” he added, grinning as Sherlock laughed. “Well, I’ll- I’ll see ya later,” he said, flipping a brief wave, and Sherlock smiled, returning the gesture with a nod.
“My aunt bought it for me last Christmas, and mother kept insisting we’d get it tailored.” He shook his head, rolling his eyes at the ceiling. “Of course, that never happened, and then it was spring, and...” He trailed off, presuming his point made, and John hummed as he moved back to the living room, head bowed to do up the last of the buttons.
“No, don’t do that,” she interjected somewhat fiercely. “Don’t leave doors open you never intend to walk through. It’s a simple question: Do you want to be with me or not?”
John’s eyes narrowed, not even ten words into his conversation with the mystery caller and already decided he didn’t like him. “He forgot it when he went out earlier,” he answered. “I’m his roommate, John.”
“How many people would you go on a homicidal rampage for, John?” Sherlock muttered, rolling his eyes.
that he asked Mary Morstan to switch with him that following Monday so he could have the desk next to Sherlock’s, staunchly maintaining that it was she who proposed the change in order to see the whiteboard more clearly.
Sherlock mumbled a begrudging agreement, Irene laughing at him as she slung her purse over her shoulder.
after that, going into a near-tirade at the horrible pattern of the not-the-father’s tie. “If he were about twenty years older, I’d forgive it, but, really, there’s just no excuse for paisley on a man that young. And in such a
“God bless us, everyone,” John answered in a sing-song voice, Victor glaring as a huff of laughter hissed through Sherlock’s nose.
He’d done nothing but stare over her head at Mycroft for a moment, the older man lifting his hands, clearly equally nonplussed, and then gingerly patted her back, prompting an even tighter hold that made him question whether it had all been a ploy to kill him after all.
“So?” John replied, shaking his head, and Sherlock lifted a brow at him. “Sherlock, it’s no small thing, asking for help,” he said, dropping his eyes to watch the progress of his thumb grazing over Sherlock’s knee. “My mum- My mum never did it. Not when it mattered, not when I needed her to.”
“Lock up when you come in, Sherlock,” she said through the thinning crack, and then the door clicked shut, the both of them left staring at the flat expanse of black paint.
Sherlock closed his mouth, rattling his head and clearing his throat to shake off the remainder of the shock. “Because he’d have done something stupid,” he muttered, twitching a shoulder as he kicked his heel against the soft ground. “Gone off and gotten himself killed.” He looked up when Mycroft did not reply, finding the man smiling down at him, one eyebrow climbing as Sherlock watched.
“You got help,” John continued, something Sherlock dimly registered as bitterness edging his tone. “That’s all that matters.” Pain tugged at the skin around John’s eyes, but Sherlock knew now was not the time to ask where the sympathy toward addiction was coming from. It wasn’t personal, certainly, but it was definitely there.
Sherlock Holmes would never have thought of himself as a jealous person, but, as it turned out, the issue seemed to have more to do with never having anything to be jealous
John smiled, a little sadly, and Sherlock’s insides somehow even further withered. “Well, it’s only a practice,” the blond shrugged. “We can probably handle that without our mascot,” he added with a smirk, and Sherlock, as was expected, glared. “How long you gonna be?” he asked, and, taking that as permission, Sherlock stood, shrugging as he passed toward his wardrobe.
you,” he answered, not daring to even blink—at least, not until Mary did, “but he won’t be able to call. Used up all his minutes for the month talking to his mum and sister after the explosion.”
“I’ve heard it both ways.” He said it casually enough, but smirked when Sherlock looked at him questioningly, recognizing the mocking repetition. Reaching out, he grabbed a sheet of white paper from where it rested beside his knee, pulling it back up in front of his face, obviously what he had been in the middle of when Sherlock woke.
“Yeah,” Sherlock interjected, nodding down at his lap as his fingers twisted together. “That- I’d- Yeah.”
Sherlock let out a loud scoff. “No,” he spat. “I would get out my violin and play a sad song just for you,” he goaded with a faux-innocent grin.
“Mary?” Sherlock asked, eyes widening as he realized the assumption had traversed thought into speech, and John gave him a curious look, lowering the cup he’d been about to drink from.
“Really?” he sighed, tapping at the side of the container filled with rice, his very own ‘Be Mine’ conversation heart drizzled in tomato sauce over the white surface.
“Right,” John said, smiling with a grateful nod. “Cheers,” he added, and Anderson waved a hand, not an entirely unpleasant fellow, really. At least, not when Sherlock wasn’t around.
“Don’t tell me you’re offended,” he whined, and Molly pursed her lips, leaning back in her chair as her arms crossed over her chest.
because he had just heard about Anna Nichols’ murder from Lestrade, the final piece of the puzzle he had managed to half-convince himself would never come, but there was still no denying that John cleaned up
Sherlock swallowed hard, looking away from the azure gaze, regretting his momentary rashness of speech. His eyes were shifting rapidly around on the blanket, his mind delving for a suitable response when he was interrupted by a low chuckling.
, John. Love, Harry.’ It’s not exactly the kind of gift a friend would give you, so, unless you call your father by his first name…” He trailed off with a shrug, and John looked back to the road, hands shifting hesitantly on the steering wheel.
“Lock it?” Sherlock finished, giving the keys a single toss before pocketing them. “Of course I did. I’m you, remember?”
“Right,” John said, his voice still strangled, and he winced at how terribly awkward he sounded. He whipped around as he heard a low chuckle to his left.
That’s what Sherlock had been trying to tell himself, anyway, ever since his Thursday afternoon conversation with John, but the fates appeared determined to conspire against him regardless.
Moran remained silent, fairly certain he was not meant to answer, and unsure how he would if he tried.
Which was what he did now, shuffling forward and forcing Sherlock to sit up. “Come on,” he beckoned, standing up and lowering down a hand to Sherlock, who took it with a begrudging groan. John just chuckled, pulling Sherlock up at his side before bustling off to pluck his coat from the wardrobe. “You’ll thank me later,” he assured, pressing Sherlock’s trench coat to his chest as he passed, and Sherlock took it from his hands, slipping his arms through the sleeves as John moved to grab the rugby jacket draped over his desk chair.
“Oh my god,” he muttered, stretching a hand out behind him to feel for obstacles as he staggeringly retreated. “Oh my
“I know that too,” Mycroft interrupted, stretching a hand out toward Sherlock’s shoulder before stopping and hesitantly withdrawing it back to his side. “All I’m saying is: Be careful.”
“Yes, well,” Sherlock continued, either not noticing or politely ignoring the flush on John’s face, “you have always been the exception.”
“Yours,” he reaffirmed, not quite ready to tackle overwriting the miserable memories of his room, and walked back up the corridor, John starting up the stairs ahead of him.
“Hey, Anderson?” John beckoned, leaning in around the wall of the man’s cubicle, startling him as he jumped in his seat. “Sorry, I-I’m looking for Sherlock,” he said, and the man frowned, tilting his head at him.
“The chicken special’s been popular,” John suggested, if only to break the tension so he could escape, and Sherlock looked up at him as if being pulled from a trance. “Or the seafood risotto,” he added, shrugging a shoulder as he passed down as subtle a look of sympathy as he could manage, and Sherlock smiled weakly back, dropping his eyes to the menu.
“Oh,” John replied, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Well, I don’t know, really. Lots of things, I suppose.”
John’s face wrinkled in effort as he summoned the memory. “I called him an asshole…” he said hesitantly, and then winced as Mike laughed.
“No,” Sherlock broke in, shaking his head, because of all the idiotic misinterpretations, this one had to take the proverbial cake. “No, John, it wasn’t-”
John’s mouth had dropped open at some point in the middle, and he left it there, every bit the dry-drowning fish as his eyes blinked dazedly, shoulders slack and slouched.
Sherlock stalled just for a moment before finishing resetting John’s alert to the generic one. Somehow, locking his phone hadn’t occurred to him, and, even now that it had been mentioned, he found he still didn’t want to do it, for some, inexplicable reason.
Sherlock’s gaze raked the crowd, finding the glinting silver dispenser first, and then the back of the man hawking it, blond hair rippling in the wind over a black jacket.
Sherlock chuckled, trying not to blink lest he miss a single moment of John’s hands around his. “How are you planning it, then?” he murmured, lifting his eyes for the sparest second to flash a weak smile.
He had been unable to sleep more than an hour at a time last night, the clock beside his bed clicking loudly toward dawn, and still he found himself unable to focus, his mind constantly drifting back to his conversation with John the previous afternoon. If you could even call that a conversation, that is.
“Basic confirmation of truthfulness, names, places,” Sherlock rattled off, waving his hand listlessly through the air as he did. “I do know the drill, Sergeant.”
Sherlock hummed, more because the pause required a response than any actual understanding on his part, and then took another drink of water, casting his mind about for a change of subject. “What did you tell Irene?”
didn’t happen then, but the realizing it did, which is really less the falling part of falling and more the sudden stop at the end.
John had to remind himself he had asked for this, that he had, in some ways, expected it from the moment he had seen this old coat in Mrs. Hudson’s closet and decided to play consulting detective. “Right,” he forced, and Sherlock seemed to barely repress a laugh. John moved to the edge of the path, looking down the street and waiting for a taxi to pass.
“Let the man at least get past the foyer before you start meddling in his personal life,” he said, a jab Mrs. Hudson seemed immune or accustomed to, sneering at Greg before rolling her eyes and turning back toward the patient group of strangers.
“Promises, promises,” Irene sighed around the mouth of her coffee cup, and then rolled her eyes to Sherlock’s unrelenting glare, lifting two fingers in an oath he doubted she had the credentials to back up.
Would they go somewhere nice? It hardly seemed necessary, familiar as they were with one another and takeaway, but John would insist on some show of propriety, at least at first. Still, it would be somewhere quiet and casual, befitting their established status.
Sherlock cleared his throat, shooting a dark look as John burst into laughter. “I have all I need for now. I’ll text you with any developments,” he muttered curtly, tossing the keys to Lestrade as he brushed past him.
“Sherlock, you have to breathe.” Lestrade moved toward him, hands batting soothingly at the air, and Sherlock blinked at him, incredulous. “We can handle this. Set up a protection detail. Move you to a safe house, even.”
John chuckled nervously, daring to take a few steps forward, if only to satisfy his curiosity on what exactly his wannabe-mad-scientist roommate was setting on fire. Stepping slightly to the side, able to see around Sherlock’s shoulder without getting too close, he saw the boy pinch something between the points of his tongs.
Sherlock shook his head, swallowing thickly as he closed his eyes briefly to the ceiling. “’M not- not sick.”
It was a perfectly logical argument, a reasonable request, but Sherlock had just admitted to not knowing something, so John was now
“Yes,” the man answered warily. “Seriously, what’s wrong? Is this your one phone call? Have you been kidnapped?!”
“Look, I- I’m not good at this sort of thing either, okay?” he continued, voice quivering, a self-deprecating smile twitching at his mouth. “But I-I feel like we have a couple choices here.”
He turned to find a petite girl looking down at him, her auburn hair grazing across her shoulders as her brown eyes widened.
“Sherlock, stop,” he tried again, breaking their lips apart as he pushed at the man, but, once again, Sherlock ignored him, his hand sliding further and further down until his palm skimmed John’s belt buckle. “Sherlock!” John cried, planting his hands and shoving hard at the brunette’s shoulders, rattling him back far enough for John to escape to the side, nearly toppling over the ledge of the bathtub as he retreated. “Stop! What are you-“ He stopped, anger faltering as he finally got a clear look at the boy’s face.
“Well, that’s obvious, isn’t it?” Sherlock replied, a glint in his eye that didn’t bode well for John’s nerves. “I do ballet.”
“Windproof?” John echoed, face wrinkled in curiousity, and Sherlock nodded. John’s eyebrows lifted as he looked back down to the blanket, clearly impressed. “Yep, that’s it,” he muttered, tugging the blanket tight to his arms, “this is coming home with us.”
The blond blinked, a soft gasp of horror hissing past his lips as he lowered his arm, eyes blinking down to the floor in astonishment. “Oh my god,” he breathed, shaking his head in clear misinterpretation of Sherlock’s reaction, and, suddenly, Molly’s words came roaring back to beat against his ears.
Sherlock turned away to the window, the red of a streetlight painting his face in stained shadows, and John sat in silence, captured by the illuminated angles. The jacket was big on the detective, sagging at the shoulders and through the torso, but pulled tight down the arms, and sat much shorter on his frame than John’s. Another streetlamp passed overhead, striping the interior of the cab with a flash of yellow light, and the white print of John’s surname on the left panel reached out from the dark, hovering proudly over Sherlock’s heart.
“You know what happens when you assume,” John chided in a sing-song voice, raising his eyebrows up at him.
“Oh god, not more crying,” John groaned, banging his head against the doorframe as he leaned into the room. “You bought us four crates of tissues, and we’re
“Ah, yes,” Sherlock mused with dawning comprehension. “Your infamous ‘rules’,” he mocked, curling his fingers around the quote.
“And you’re going to help me, are you?” Sherlock asked, and John could picture his mocking smile from the smug lilt of his voice. “Why? Why should I trust you? Why should I even
John’s voice rang out in the silence, and Sherlock stared hard at the ceiling, trying not to think about what he knew was going through the minds of the trio just down the hall.
“What?” he muttered sharply as he looked down at her, determined to play this through as though nothing had happened, even as he internally kicked himself for being so obvious.
