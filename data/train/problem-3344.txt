"That's what is sounded like to me." offers Sam.
"Dean, how many bakeries is that?" Dean shrugged his shoulders in answer.
"Hey, can I get a picture?" he asked, it was the only way to get things straight.
"By yourself?"
Any further bargaining was stopped by the arrival of their food: Cas' eyes went wide at the sight of their two bacon cheeseburgers. This time a waitress (again someone Dean didn't recognize, had he been away for so long Ellen had changed her entire staff) set their plates in front of them. Wishing them a good meal she departed.
"Where Dean, I told you she popped by tonight?" Cas repeated looking confused.
"Good?" both Dean and Henry nod, too lost in chocolatey goodness to use actual words. "I always send out for food on days like this, for my employees." Dean raises his eyebrows, even he didn't do that for his guys. Christ Cas was showing him up in the boss department.
Oh! That was Sam, over a week of them being together and he still wasn't used to waking with the man. He guessed after all the scumbags waking to find Sam still with him would take him a while to accept.
"Yes, I'm freaking out a bit so a load of questions won't help me." letting his eyes roam over the place for anything he might have missed Dean was confronted with rainbows, damn Charlie and her mission the let the flag fly.
"Wouldn't dream of it," said Sam flashing a smile that had Gabriel moving to place a kiss on Sam's cheek.
"Endgame?" asked Dean feeling hopeful.
Failing dexterity on top of everything else would be a real low blow. Managing the door he gets it shut before falling in front of it, not knowing if the fact that Cas hadn't run after him better or worse.
It didn't have to go beyond his being horny, no doubt any contact from someone beautiful would garner a response. And Dean could admit that Cas was beautiful.
* * *
"Henry! What are you doing out of bed?" he asked pulling him up to sit before wrapping him a blanket, the act makes him realize how cold he is.
"Well try it!" implored Cas looking on edge, smiling Dean grabbed hold of the fork digging in quickly knowing Cas would probably wallop him one otherwise.
"What! No, Dean, this place is so majestic, thank you for showing it to me," Cas reached for him, pulling him up until he was seated on the bench. "It's a sanctuary it just made me realize how much I miss my own."
"That's very nice of you, Ruby," said Cas.
"Well if you'll have me, I wouldn't want to assume." Cas smiled, it was oddly reassuring.
"Well I didn't want to spook Cas with these gifts So I got a card to explain it all, you without saying it was me only - "
"Hey!" Dean is about to state how cool he is when something sinks in. "Wait, Rufus gardens?" he asks incredulously
“This one?” he asked holding tree number, actually Dean had lost count due to the fact that Cas was sending Gabriel pictures of each specimen, without the use of phones.
"Oh, I told him you needed space for a bit," admitted Dean sheepishly, Henry hadn't been best pleased with it either.
Dean loved this place, he'd been coming here pretty much since he arrived in town with Sam. Bobby and Ellen were friends before getting together, they'd spent their formative years with her daughter Jo who was currently away traveling.
"Gabriel, that is quite enough! Sit down Sam, I can manage with Dean, believe me when I say I've dealt with worse,"
Dean felt a little confused as the man - Gabriel unashamedly ran his eyes over his body leeringly as if he was checking out the goods. Soon after Gabriel headed to the back, Dean assumed to get the pie.
Sam broke out into a glowing smile followed by puppy eyes, "No Sam! Put those away right this second, you look like you're planning what to wear at the wedding,"
“Well I thought we could involve Gabe and Cas, and um I was thinking you could handle the food,” said Sam dangling the proverbial carrot.
"Probably," the answer made Cas look up from surveying his clothes.
Now that was understood Dean turned his eyes to Gabriel, all the while making sure his glare wasn't too strong. Sam had a radar for it and would no doubt flash his specially reserved Gabriel bitchface back in return.
"Why?" asked Dean confused.
"Hey Cassie, um do you mind if I invite Sam over only it's been so long between tastings. I don't want all my hard work to be wasted and find him cozying up to a salad."
Outside the sky was darkening, checking his watch Dean found he had half an hour of dread to get through. He shifted slightly on his chair hoping to find a less uncomfortable position without any luck. He could do this, the flight was only three hours, deep breaths were his friend or some shit. Topeka airport was still humming with people even as the clock got closer to nine.
"God, your getting heavy." Once they're settled, Dean becomes aware of Cas: how much closer he is, the familiar scent of his cologne, and sitting with their thighs wedged together. It brings back that swoopy feeling in his stomach. "So what did you do this afternoon?" he asks as a distraction.
Seeing Dean looking all lost and tired had him wanting to pull the younger man into his arms, Cas blamed the blushing. He hoped Dean wanted the same but he knew there were things left unsaid, he wasn't sure if he was the best thing for Dean at the moment and felt too scared to risk pushing things.
"I like it, my older brother lumbered me with Cassie years ago and it stuck a little too well." Dean chuckles before trying his best to cover it with a cough. "Hey, you can laugh I won't hold it against you." since he has permission Dean does so. "Well I should be going, it was really nice to speak with you, Dean."
"Hey, don't sell yourself short, Sam and I often worry about the outcome if you two pooled your resources," informed Cas watching Dean's cheeks color.
It was gone eleven when Sam returned, Henry was long tucked up in bed. Dean, however, was on the couch he wasn't waiting for Sam he just wasn't tired. His conversation with Charlie had helped with that, his feelings, emotions were a tangled mess and had been for some time.
He sided with Elle Woods on that one
"Since it means so much you guys should get to experience the whole thing," answered Sam his brain sparking an idea, "Is there anything you guys specifically want to do?"
Dean went to say something only the words caught in his throat, in fact, he didn't even know what the words were. Sam gave him a look filled with anger and guilt.
"I'd love to join you, are you sure it's okay? he asks, kindly giving Dean an out even after the invitation.
Yeah, Dean was definitely heading to the kitchen if that was going to be in his line of sight, he was meant to be keeping his stomach. Jerking his head at Cas he passed Charlie the controller as they snuck away, Dean was happy to find Sam had brewed a whole pot of coffee rather than just one cup.
"I'm better than okay, I love waking up to you." he smiled allowing Sam to pull him against his chest. Yeah, Sam was right, he didn't need to get up everything he needed was right here holding him tight.
"Sweet, here take my card," Dean passed it over, "Call me when you can drop it over, or will it need towing?"
"So did Henry buy you a cactus?"
"Gabriel, please stop calling me that! It's Castiel or Cas," oh shit Dean knew that tone having had it directed his way more times than he could count.
"God, why did I even call you?" he asks his voice light. "And don't mention this to Sam."
Turning his attention to the man behind the counter, only to find his view hindered by the other customer. From what he could make out the man was short which only aided to obscure everything else.
"Yo Cas! You coming over tonight?" jumping in fright Cas found Charlie entering the shop.
"Also he absolutely loves those Oh Henry! bars, I think he pretends to own them or something."
"Yeah, um I didn't want to be away from you..." Dean trailed off thinking it sounded a bit weird, closing his eyes for a minute he tried again, "Um, I mean I didn't want to leave you alone in a strange place."
"I never realized how much of a dick he was until we started hanging out," Dean motioned between him and Cas when he said 'we'.
“He's pretty good,” Sam said, knowing his brother was being humble about his skill.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Dean said, turned around as well and seeing at least five nude men running through the streets. “Late night’s out of the question, then.”
Gabriel laughed and asked Dean the time, realizing he hadn’t unpacked his alarm clock. Dean got up and picked his wristwatch off his desk, “10:42.”
“Let’s sit outside, enjoy our last night here,” Dean said, stretching when he stood up before sliding open the glass door to the patio. He leaned against the metal patio railing, cool against his arms, sending a small shiver throughout his body. He looked into the distance at the remainder of the sunset, feeling instantly relaxed at the sight of blue and purple hazy sky. His mind began to wander freely as he watched the ocean waves break over the sand, and was snapped out of his thoughts when Cas said his name as he approached.
“What?” Dean laughed, “Castiel? No, no, no, no, Bobby it’s not like that," he defended.
He just hummed in response, continuing to gather clothes from all over his room.
Dean pouted slightly at Charlie, “You guys didn’t send her to prank us?”
“Relax, there’s no one down here but us,” Dean said into his ear, shivers ran throughout Castiel’s body as Dean’s hands moved down from his abdomen to his thighs, rubbing up and down as he gently nipped on Cas’ ear.
“Well when you say future, that’s what I’m picturing,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck.
"Dean, I know you're allergic to feelings or whatever," Castiel said, "but we've known each other since we were kids. You can tell me."
"Charlie is cooler than both of you," Castiel said as he lit another joint.
Dean started to change, he did not want to go to a party stinking like pizza, and pulled his shirt over his head. Castiel's attention was now focused on Dean, his back shining lightly with sweat, he couldn't stop staring, his mouth hung open in a goofy, tipsy smile. When Dean bent over to rummage through his dresser Castiel's eyes wandered further south from Dean's toned back, he couldn't help but notice how low Dean's jeans hung on his hips.
“You coming, Cas?” Dean asked hopefully, since Castiel hadn’t been to a party with them since coming back from winter break.
“You’re actually nervous about going on a date with Cas?” Benny asked, sounding less condescending than Gabriel.
"That would be nice. How about Tuesday and Thursdays at 7?" Cas asked after he mentally pictured his schedule to see when he was free.
“I’d like that,” Castiel smiled, wiping sand off his hands and standing up. Dean slowly got up, and took Castiel’s hand to help stand. Cas adjusted his sunglasses as they began walking down the crowded beach. They made it to the water, the cool waves lapping at their bare feet, they looked out at the luxury homes rising above the beach one on side, and the blue expansive Atlantic on the other.
"Your brother says hello," she said in an accent similar to Crowley's, Castiel thought they must be relatives.
When Dean exited the bathroom he heard how awful the music playing was and decided to check out the old  jukebox just a few feet away from the restrooms. They had to have some Led Zeppelin or at least ACDC. While he browsed through the album's he saw a blue and red reflection out of the corner of his eye, but ignored it and continued to browse. Dean settled on a song and began to make his way outside to meet his friends.
“Mhm, I agree,” Cas said as he laid down in the bed beside Dean, “I told you it wouldn’t be so bad.”
“Yes, sir.”
Castiel politely answered all of their questions, including answering a few for Dean when his cheeks were stuffed with bread like a chipmunk.
"It's alright, no problemo amigo," Garth said, wiping the coffee off his sleeve. "Gotta do laundry anyway. Where are you off to in such a hurry on a Saturday morning?"
“Thank you, but Dean is right, we need to study.”
Dean immediately placed his hand around Castiel, the two stroking each other in pace. Their lips found each other once again, lips parted and tongues swirling around each other. Castiel quickened his pace, Dean moaned loudly, pulling away from Castiel’s mouth and resting their foreheads together. Dean twisted his hand around Castiel’s head, earning a low moan, “Dean,” he panted.
"Well I need a reason to drop him," Castiel said, trying to go along with what Dean was saying, hoping he would give him some answers.
“Love you, mom!” Dean exclaimed and Mary turned around and blew him a kiss. When he was younger he would have never done that, he was afraid of showing affection, especially in public, but Dean’s first year in college taught him differently. His maturity was growing more and more each day he was off on his own, as many young adults do when they leave for school. Even Jo hugged her mother goodbye when they left for college, and she was a hell of a lot tougher than Dean would ever care to admit. After his mom disappeared from his sight he grinned to himself, excited to start another year of college. Especially if it was going to be anything like his first year.
“I think I’d rather take a chance with them than frostbite,” he blew into his hands before stuffing them as deep into his pockets as he could.
Castiel laughed, “Because they’re college level and you’re more than prepared for college.”
“Yes, I don’t think he will be awake anytime soon,” Castiel placed the ham in the sandwiches and held one out to his brother. “I haven’t seen Michael,” he said before taking a bite.
“Sorry, sweetheart, but I've got bills to pay. How ‘bout you?”
“He can be. His anger is usually directed towards Luke and Gabriel. But Luke isn’t around and Gabriel doesn’t give a shit anymore.”
"That's pretty far," Castiel said, interested in learning more about him.
“Where’s Ruby?” Sam asked again, looking frantically out the window then back to his brother.
Castiel laughed, "No way."
“What time is it?” He yawned, retrieving his left arm from around Cas’s torso and sitting up on his side.
“Well you should come by for the weekend. sometime”
Dean swallowed a lump that had formed in his throat when he was exposed to the other man’s crystalline blue eyes; the bright light in the bathroom allowed him to get a better look at who was gently caring for his minor injury. “Well you swooped in to tend to this,” he moved his hand slightly, “so I just thought,” he shrugged and shut his mouth.
Charlie scoffed, "Whatever, we're almost there."
Dean shoved Jo's shoulder and rolled his eyes, he had heard plenty of those jokes in high school. His cheeks flushed slightly-still unsure if Jo knew about the sloppy make out session he had with her step brother.
"Oh you didn't have time to finish?" Dean asked with a smirk, "You were studying for quite a while.”
"Cas?" Dean asked, hoping Castiel would agree to meat lovers, because Dean would prefer to eat Gabe's Hawaiian over pepper and onion, it at least had meat on it.
“Yeah, exactly. Shit, Cas I’m so sorry. I’m sorry if I hurt you, you’re my best friend.”
Back at the cabin, as the first light of dawn appeared, Jack jumped up and hurried to pull on a jacket. Castiel stood up and asked, “Where do you think you’re going?”
“Oh,” Castiel said, stepping forward onto the bridge, knowing the bike path was built a couple years ago, running through campus to the center of Lawrence. “It looks different at night.”
“My keys’re gone,” Castiel patted his behind to no avail.
Dean nodded, understanding completely. Gabriel wanted to protect his little brother, wanted him to make the right choices. Dean 100% understood. If Sam was hanging around with drug dealers Dean would kick his ass to last Tuesday.
And fuck it. They've been through a lot of firsts together over the years—first man rescued from Hell, first angel with free will, first escape from Purgatory—why not this one too?
"Oh. Right. Uh, Western corruption of ancient African religious practice? Think recipe for Victorian-age Viagra."
Dean twitches his head back toward the boxes waiting in the Impala. "Seeing as this is kind of your fault, you could help, you know," he suggests.
“I miss what it felt like to work together, part of a team. I think I could build that again, hopefully here. But my experience of family wasn’t what you— Well, what you’d call normal, I suppose.”
Dean hates that answer, hates it so much he shakes off Cas's hold. Something cracks inside him like lightning, like the Grand fucking Canyon, so fast and deep he might fall in.
“Oh yeah. That happened,” Dean practically preens and Castiel laughs.
Like he'd ever want to.
Sam snorts, but Dean's dick almost jumps. And fuck it hurts. He's tense all over from trying to hold this thing off, and the pain is spreading. He forces himself upright and notices the way his muscles tremble.
Maybe it's how tired he still is, or his lack of mojo, or the nightmares, but Cas is quietly compliant. He helps Dean help him up, concentrates on each step. It doesn't seem to be that there's anything wrong with his legs so much as he's dizzy and weak with exhaustion.
Dean crosses his arms in a defensive pout Castiel recognizes from his own teen years and shrugs a shoulder.
“To you, you mean,” Sam clarifies, no less calm than he would be in a deposition.
Does that mean he, at some level, believes there’s a predator? He shakes away the thought. He can’t square that right now. There isn’t— There can’t be someone, something, here, watching him. But still. There’s no going back to sleep now.
He doesn't think about it. Much.
The match tip catches on the first try and flares to yellow life. Castiel drops it into the footlocker and lights another. The soft smell of sulfur fills his senses as he lights a third. This time the match lands on Vonnegut and the cover catches. It spreads fast over the dry cotton of the flack jacket. When the flames reach the WINCHESTER name patch, Castiel has to look away. He gets to his feet and tosses in the whole match box, swallowing hard against heartache.
"Yeah, well, it's called the Horn of a Hundred Loves," Sam continues, and Dean snorts. "Lame, I know, but it was part of an ancient fertility rite. The tribes-people believed it would, uh, keep you going, you know, like a hundred times."
"I could do this for myself," Cas says a few moments later, speaking low. He doesn't sound ashamed or angry. More apologetic.
So he’d found a bar. He’d never been a drinker and he never patronized the kind of bars with sticky floors and decor by Budweiser on wood paneled walls, but he found a bar. He plunked his half-full box on the stool beside him and ordered whiskey shots until he started to feel that slow creep of apathy. Then he teetered to the back of the empty establishment, passed the pool tables, picked up a dart from the cabinet, and aimed it at the map of the United States tacked between the restroom doors. When it landed somewhere in middle America, Castiel raised his fists in the air in triumph, laughing at his improbable bullseye. The bartender didn’t think the extra hole in his wall was quite as funny though, and for the second time that day Castiel was escorted from a building, but not before he got a glimpse of where the dart had landed: northeast Kansas.
"Did you go back? Is Zuul gone?" Dean struggles to sit upright again, but Cas pushes him back.
"Right here, man." Dean runs a hand in short, steady strokes down Cas's shoulder. "You're okay. You're safe."
“Okay,” he breathes out. “Okay.”
Dean moves out at the beginning of January, just after New Year's. It took a couple weeks but he found a place closer to Sam (not too close, though) and lined up a transfer to an affiliate auto parts store in South Bend. He's not sure he wants to keep the job—he has the rest of his life to do whatever he wants, after all—but for now he needs money from a place that doesn't do background checks, so it works out.
She hadn’t said everything she wanted to, Castiel senses, but he doesn’t push. It’s clear enough she’s happy to be free of the property, and he knows he has a lot of work ahead. Never mind gardening, he’d never (well, hardly ever) picked up a hammer, let alone refurbished a house. He’ll need all the luck he’s offered.
Cas shucks his overcoat as he comes forward, tossing it on the neighboring bed. Dean's a wreck. Pain and pleasure spiral through him so fast and hard his hands shake as he tries to undo his pants. Cas takes over for him without a word, and Dean's not freaking out about letting another guy touch his dick, he's not. He's just weirded out that it's Cas, an angel who probably doesn't know a handjob from—
"You started it," Dean grouses and empties the sugar into the bowl. Cas keeps staring in that way that implies he thinks you're a crabby little kid but he still expects an answer. Dean sighs then mumbles, "Didn't work out, okay?"
“Some brother you turned out to be,” Dean is saying. “You’re a traitor to this family.”
"It's a satisfying activity for you."
"Your—" Dean eyes go wide. "Oh." He drops heavily beside Cas. "How bad is it? Did one of 'em get your sword?"
"'Course I don't," Dean snaps.
Hell, if anything, Cas deserves better than him. Dean got emptied out by Purgatory too, got stripped back to everything but the most brutal basics, and the only thing that kept his soul human was probably this busted-up angel in front of him. But maybe it's good Purgatory burned up all their baggage.
Cas cocks his head, and there's an eerie difference in his focus, like he's looking at Dean's physical presence instead of his innermost soul, the way he usually does. Dean stiffens.  "You've lost weight," Cas concludes.
The paint pan, though. That’s something else altogether. One minute he’s rolling a satisfying red onto a feature wall in the living room with the paint pan safely feet away. The next, he takes a step back to assess the coverage, hoping the color dries darker than this initial coat, and squarely plants his right foot in the paint tray.
“Right. Exactly.”
Noises are one thing. It’s a big house, and it’s old. Eaves creaking, heaters clanging, doors swaying in unidentified drafts—all those things are to be expected and don’t particularly concern Castiel. And sure, he begins to notice objects around the house moving. Or perhaps not moving, precisely, but they appear in places he doesn’t remember putting them, like his coffee cup on that early morning.
"Out with it, Sammy."
“That’s ridiculous,” Castiel says, but Meg just smirks and puts up a ‘not-so-fast’ finger.
He throws together a sandwich and grabs a glass of water. It’s a sunny day; he should go outside, eat on the porch, take a lap around the house. But instead he shuffles into the living room, perches on the arm of the sofa, and flicks on the TV. Just a half hour, he thinks, clicking through the channels, a short mental break, just enough to—
"You did it with Bobby once, right?"
Meg’s eyes are assessing him again and he allows himself to assess in return, noting her long dark hair and open face. There’s something appealing about her cheekbones. It’s also been a long time since Castiel felt like noticing someone. He suspects Meg’s motivation is different than his own, but he won’t dismiss the possibility of friendship. He’d never had many friends, just brothers and coworkers—his family had been his job and his job had been his life. He isn’t sure what his life is now, but it has more room in it.
like burgers. You even like 'em nice and raw." He grins as Cas rolls in his lips and turns a light shade of green. "We hit diners for the home cooking. Wasn't exactly time to stop and cook during the apocalypse, was there?"
"Sammy. How long was I out?"
But since Purgatory? Dean doesn't know. It's like the locker sprung open. Shit just keeps tumbling out, and he's trying to let it. This wasn't something he'd wrapped his head around yet, but it was on the list. He'll just have to shove it away for a little while longer to get through this.
"Dean?" Cas shakes his limp hand, touches his face. "Dean—"
"Can you get your head wet?" Dean asks, returning to his seat at the edge of the basin. "Take a dunk?" Castiel frowns at the filth that's replaced most of the suds in the water. He hears Dean chuckle. "It'll wash off again, don't worry. Come on," Dean coaxes, offering his hands for Castiel to lean into. He accepts the opportunity for Dean's touch.
. Like if I don't do something about it, my dick might fall off."
: demony demigod thing summoned from the depths to do your bidding, until it decides to eat your soul instead. It has nothing to do with the war in Heaven and it's not—as Dean guesses Sam had been hoping—connected to whatever's fucking with Dean.
She stations herself on the left side of the entryway, and Castiel bypasses her to examine the living room.
"Hey, Lis?" he starts, heading into the kitchen after her.
,” he grits out, pushing up to meet Castiel’s mouth. Castiel licks deeply, tongue passing over that small, hot hole. The second time Dean moans, Cas does too, swept away on the current of Dean’s pleasure. He gives up keeping Dean parted with his fingers and sweeps his arms under Dean’s thighs, spreading wide and tilting his hips. His hands slide up along Dean’s sides, but soon he’s raking fingers back down Dean’s ribs, hoisting him closer, sinking his face deeper, as Dean curses again.
Days later, after spending an entire day indoors operating a rented floor sander, Castiel wants nothing more than to breathe air without sawdust in it and bask in silence. He’d bought a six pack of Shiner on a whim while in town to pick up the sander—it seemed the appropriately masculine thing to do—and has never been more glad of an impulse buy than he is in that moment, seated on the steps of his porch, dangling the cool neck of the bottle from his fingers.
"Huh?"
— — — — —
"Why not?"
"I thought you would be investigating by now," Cas rumbles at Sam, looking confused. Sam, hands on his hips, nods at Dean. Dean sighs and looks up with an abbreviated wave.
Dean curls around him, tracing the curve of one bruised wing and dropping a kiss to Cas's shoulder before he settles in, snug against his back.
"At the end, there. What you said. About the thing you're
Ava is still at her post by the door. “I hope you like it.” Her eyes dart around nervously.
And there’s another question: how did a Dean Winchester come to live in ‘the Campbell place’?
Dean wishes he could say the same, but Cas looks tired and tense. Brittle enough to snap, actually, but Dean doesn't say that either. Mostly because his tongue might as well be tied in a bow. "I'm— Yeah, I—"
Dean rolls his eyes as he opens his own beer. "You know, wrapping paper. The stuff that dresses up the present, but that you rip through to get to the thing you actually want."
So fuck the curse. Fuck the pain. Fuck it all. This need is fake, this want isn't real. None of it is his or any part of him. Dean has something he wants a hundred times more. Dean has Cas.
Cas ignores him. "How long has it been?" he asks Sam.
Dean seems to startle, blinking several times in rapid succession even as he looks elsewhere. "You what? Oh, yeah. You look, uh, better."
Castiel understands that Dean means his distraction, but this, all of this—the bath, his reverence, his care—what else has it been if not an apology? Dean's actions have always said more than his words.
"Nope, but I know where I'm going, and we should part ways here, friend."
Castiel grins at the idea.
“You’re good for me, y’know,” Dean rumbles, his words sleep-slurred.
Dean plops onto what was Sam's bed and pulls a pillow over his lap, acutely aware he may not make it through this conversation without Cas's, well,
Castiel's dreams have fangs.
“Maybe,” Castiel allows, thinking back on the photo album skidding out of his reach, on how Dean’s difficulty talking about Sam caused so many arguments. “But I think that’s because anger is easier than hurt.”
Absurd happiness was never a future Castiel pictured for himself, but he can’t breathe for laughing, he’s dropped his brush in the spring grass, and Dean’s bare chest is most of his field of vision.
Dean was meant to escape Purgatory. He was not meant to surrender his life for an unworthy angel. Castiel will not accept Dean's sacrifice for his salvation.
There’s also a little plastic toy soldier, standing at the ready, sighting down the barrel of his rifle, his paint chipped. Castiel smiles at him, hefts the figure in his hand.
"Here works," Dean caves. "This is good."
Castiel runs a hand over the wooden bannister of the staircase, and mounts the first step, peering up. Light filters from the open bathroom door over the dust in the hall. Some of the stairs look damaged. There are a few spindles missing from the railing.
“I did.” Castiel shrugs and takes another drink of his beer. Dean pushes off from the railing and takes a seat on the steps beside Castiel, triggering another series of questions: If Dean is non-corporeal, how does he move as though he has weight? How does he sit on the stairs instead of sinking through them? “Can I ask you something?” he ventures.
“Evidence of what?” Meg’s voice is still all mirth and for the first time it makes Castiel scowl. This is serious.
If nothing else—if he gives up now—at least he’ll have left his mark on this place.
Cas sucks in air and writhes, hips bucking forward but immediately pushing back against Dean's touch. Dean moves his fingers slowly, drags them down then up, greasing the whole area. He finds the knot of muscle and strokes over it with just his middle finger. Cas groans long and low and pleased. Dean feels himself get a little harder too.
Cas ducks away. "Yes."
Dean strokes the backs of his fingers along the firm plane of Cas's bare side. "Never?"
Cas looks troubled, but Dean is too tired for more words to explain. He just knows it's better when Cas is here, and that it's somehow better for Cas, too.
"Maybe," Cas says, getting to his feet. He steps close into Dean's personal space, settling his mouth at Dean's ear, "Maybe you should think about what you
"What in the— Dean?" Benny the vampire's drawl means Castiel has landed where he'd intended.
Dean’s lips press into a thin line and he nods. “Okay. Yeah. That’s fair.”
He takes the wrench from his lips and tightens down the stem nut. If this works, it’ll be his second successful plumbing project of the day and, in theory, the constant drip he’s been hearing through the nights will stop.
Because he's doing it again. Play-acting like he would in any civilian role—PA on a film set, convicted criminal on a stint in the pen. Only this time there's no endgame, no case to solve, no fixed point when this is over. He could go on playing this part for the rest of his life.
"Jerk." Sam smirks.
Cas's eyebrows are confused. "Am I a secret?"
“So he left out the part about it being a one-time offer, I assume.” Sam winces as though he can see Castiel’s heart sink. “Yeah, that doesn’t surprise me. Dean’s always the hero of his own stories, always in the right, never makes a mistake. And saying no to that reaper was a mistake.”
"Fucking get up here." He pulls at the shoulders of Cas's shirt this time.
"You don't need to be here, Dean." Cas's big blue eyes are all earnestness. "It would be good for you to have a place of your own."
He can't figure it out. He hadn't seen Cas for weeks and then
Either way, Cas climbs up onto to the table, straddling Dean and unzipping his own pants. The sight makes Dean's lungs stop. He yanks Cas down by his tie and lets Cas kiss him filthy as they both use one hand to work Cas's dick the rest of the way free. Cas's whole body shudders when Dean gets a firm grip.
—skate his tongue over Dean's nipple.
Talking to the toy soldier started after the TV incident. He recognizes it’s maybe a little nuts, but somehow it feels less nuts pretending someone is actually in the house than suspecting the spirit of a deceased someone is. In the back of his brain there’s a memory of his coworkers lampooning Tom Hanks and a volleyball, but he continues talking aloud to the soldier anyway.
“But you are kind of an asshole,” Castiel insists.
The next time Cas shows up, Dean is home alone. Lisa does the yoga lessons thing in the evening a couple times a week, on the same nights as Ben has soccer practice. Dean only works part time at the auto parts store in town, so he figures it's his job to get dinner on the table by the time they get home. Lisa appreciates it, and it makes Dean feel like less of loser so, smiles all around. That evening, when Cas pops in, Dean's somewhere in the middle of making spaghetti sauce.
"You gotta try this, c'mere," he jerks his head in invitation, still stirring, but Cas stays put. "No, really. Try this. You helped make it, you get to reap the rewards."
"I know, I know, just—"
A heel comes up around Cas’s ribs, toes hooking over his back, coaxing him on. Castiel runs a hand up Dean’s spine, down the back of a thigh. On his knees with his ass propped up high, Dean’s cock hangs heavy. Cas pauses to lick his lips then sets about laying deep kisses—a turn of his tongue here, a delicate rake teeth there. The change distracts Dean enough for Castiel to reach up unnoticed and palm his cock.
Startled, Castiel spins and fridge door slams. “What?”
There's a war going on out there—it's the goddamn apocalypse—but here, this morning, Dean's got nothing to worry about but Cas's hungry mouth and angel-blue eyes.
“Spooky?”
Castiel gapes. “You’re the—”
Castiel doesn't follow. "Did what?" He winces at a twinge of pain.
Dean frowns. There's some kind of heavenly judgment in there somewhere, he can feel it. "What's wrong with burgers? I like burgers. Hell,
Castiel pulls the string on the bare lightbulb that illuminates the basement and sure enough, over by the fuse box he finds two screwdrivers, his plumbing snake, a level, and several pencils. He sighs. Dean stops talking and grins.
Castiel savors the after. He tips his chin to kiss Dean’s sweaty hair and waits for his pounding heartbeat to slow and the shocky jolts of joy to subside.
Mike laughed, “No, why would he be?”
“Are you free tomorrow?”
“Dibs,” Gabe said, covering with a cough, making Dean snort and muffle a laugh.
“All the beds are made.”
"Yes, I'm aware of what day it is."
“Now we have to go, I want to see you two get thrown out,” Jo said, laughing.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel said.
“I was being literal. I got a job.”
Castiel nodded and quietly returned a “love you,” as he pulled away from the hug, he heard someone quietly
“What the hell?” Castiel asked, Dean’s arms wrapping around his waist.
“Thanks Mom!” Dean beamed before hurrying back to the dangling phone. “Cas you still there?”
Michael had to go to work the next morning, but before he left he scrawled a list of things for Castiel to do before the party that night. Castiel didn't see the list until much later- nearly lunchtime when him and Dean finally made their way downstairs in search of caffeine. Dean picked it up and began reading out loud, "Sweep, vacuum, clean the bathroom and kitchen, buy food- did Mike leave you a to do list?"
“Cas, fuck me,” Dean practically whined after Cas nipped roughly at his bottom lip.
“Four doors down,” Jo nodded her head to the right.
“Is it just me or was that weird?” Jo asked, sipping from the fifth of whiskey Benny uncovered from his jacket pocket.
Jo laughed, agreeing that they could be childish in their antics, but that was one of the reasons she enjoyed hanging out with them. There was never a dull moment with Gabriel and Dean.
“How far is Michael’s house?” Castiel asked, rubbing his bare arms that were prickled with goosebumps. He was the only one without alcohol to keep him warm, so he took another drag and let the smoke in his lungs begin to warm him.
“Dean delivered your fucking pizza last night!” Gabriel exclaimed.
Castiel huffed out a laugh and peered into the mirror thoughtfully, “A doctor's coat and a stethoscope would suit me.”
He laughed at Dean's reaction which was a scoff and he began tugging at Castiel's shirt, attempting to pull it over his head. "Are you sure about that?" He breathed onto Cas' neck.
Castiel stared into Dean's green eyes, he wanted more than anything to pull him in close and tell him it was okay, that it wasn't his fault. But he didn't. Dean looked at him with eyes pleading not to ever speak of this again, and Castiel made a silent pledge to do just that.
The door handle shook violently, and Sam cried out “Dean, wake up, you promised!” before pounding on the door.
“And then Cas came along,” Jo said, taking another sip to warm herself even more. She couldn’t quite feel her exposed legs, but her fingers were cold. “I think he’s softening him,” she laughed. “He’s a different person with him, more like he was before Lisa.”
“How many of those did he have?” Gabe asked, turning around to face his younger brother and roommate.
Dean groaned, "You said that an hour ago."
“My dad’s car. I figured out who keyed it,” Dean said, turning around to look down the hallway, making sure no one was watching. “Dick Roman,” he whispered.
"In a minute," Gabriel said, holding up his beer, wanting to finish it before they left.
“Right,” Sam said unconvinced, but dropped the subject when the tall blonde tenth grader Jessica Moore arrived. Dean had teased Sammy about his crush on Jess for years, but Sam insisted it wasn’t a crush to the point he tried to tackle Dean the last time he brought it up. Dean decided to leave him alone, not because he was scared of Sam, but because Jess was a nice girl and he secretly hoped Sammy would nut up and ask her out.
"Once I get out of this place I hope to drink to forget it," Dean chuckled as he counted Benny's change.
Dean stood up and took the lube and a condom with him before hurrying out to the balcony. Cas followed behind him and when they got outside the cool breeze hit their bodies, heightening their senses and creating goosebumps. “Where do you want me?”
Anna was perched on the edge of the love seat in the living room, a cup in her hand and a wide smile on her face. While Castiel retrieved a beer from the fridge he felt the guilt in his stomach wither away, a small smile on his lips. “Hello, Anna,” he greeted, standing next to her before cracking open the can.
“Gross, Dean!”
“We’re leaving now,” Dean exclaimed gruffly, zipping his jacket and preparing to venture back out into the snow.
“I need pot, Crowley,” Castiel said cutting to the chase.
“Hi, Mrs. Novak,” Dean called out, stepping into the foyer.
“Okay, I’ve been a real asshole to you, Castiel. I’ve taken the jokes too far and I’m sorry. I don’t have a problem with you being gay, or Dean, I really don’t. You’re family, and you love your family no matter what. We’re all we’ve really got, right?” Michael said, and before Castiel could even respond he continued making his lunch.
“I knew it!” He stared at his brother for another minute, Dean knew he was watching him and turned to face his brother.
“Me too,” Dean groaned when he felt Castiel’s finger pressed against him and began pushing inside him. He moaned into the pillow when Cas pushed it all the way in and began to stroke Dean from inside. “More,” Dean ordered after a minute, Cas immediately added a second finger and began to pump his fingers in and out, watching Dean shift his hips to meet Castiel’s pace and let out a low, “Fuck.”
“Are you guys serious?” Sam asked after a few moments of silence.
“It came from that way,” Dean said, pointing to the woods that were smack in the middle of the two paths.
“Hey, is Cassie with you?”
“Do you see something?”
"Come on, humor me," Dean said with a slight chuckle.
Chuck laughed and said, "Castiel? Seriously? The accountant in a trench coat?"
“He’s very important to me, and I care about Dean very much,” Castiel said fondly.
Soon enough, Dean heard Lynyrd Skynyrd blasting from the parking lot, signaling Ash's arrival.
Castiel and his brother sat atop a small brick wall in the backyard. “So,” Gabriel said, drawing out the vowel, earning a raised eyebrow from his brother.
Cas tilted his head slightly when she mentioned Greek Week, not knowing what it is. Luckily Charlie caught on to that and continued, "Founders day for the first frat and sorority are on the same week, so that whole week gets pretty crazy." Castiel nodded, now remembering hearing Gabriel talk about it over the summer.
"No," Castiel shifted in his seat uncomfortably.
“Of course,” Dean replied and they turned away from the cool, wet sand, and towards the walking path. “Shit that’s hot,” Dean said when his feet hit the sand, alternating standing on each foot to help alleviate the pain, “race ya,” he said before he let go of Cas’ hand and took off, kicking sand up behind him.
“Come by after?” Dean asked eagerly as he began to make his way out of the classroom.
“Sorry if that was weird back there,” Dean said sheepishly, turning to Castiel on their way out of the dining hall, their friends a few paces ahead of them.
“Enough with the attitude, Castiel. You can’t go run off to your friends every time you are upset.”
“Mhm, hmm. I am,” Castiel nodded with a smirk.
“Maybe. Oh shit room selections are soon,” Dean said, knowing that soon they will have to choose their roommates for the following year. Cas just nodded before Dean asked, “Do you have any idea what you want to do next year?”
“Or somethin’,” Castiel responded before giggling.
Back at the house, Ruby and Sam had ventured into another room, leaving Castiel and Jack in the main living space ignoring what the other two were likely up to. The cousins were silent as Castiel began picking up the discarded mugs his friends had left behind. He busied himself with the dishes, needing any distraction he could take. Jack stared out the window, he reminded Castiel of the family dog watching out the window for any movement in the yard. The image nearly comforted Cas, but he was snapped back to reality when his soapy hands dropped a mug in the sink and it cracked. He cringed and inspected the damage, then breathed a sigh of relief when he realized it was only a chip because the mug was one that looked special, with World’s Best Mom painted in child-like handwriting, realizing it had probably been gifted to Ellen from Jo or Ash when they were young. He dried it with caution and tenderly placed it back in the cabinet where the other mugs were kept. By the time he finished the dishes he decided to sit down with his cousin, who was still staring out the window. Castiel sat so he could easily see outside if he wanted to and asked, “See anything?”
"Yeah, yeah, I'll get him back. Wrap it up," Dean slapped Gabe in the chest before waving his hand in the air trying to get Castiel's attention after he exited the bathroom. Castiel swayed through the living room towards Dean. By the time Castiel made it over to Dean, Gabriel was long gone, the door was already shut behind him.
“Yeah, but Jess needs to be home for dinner,” he said sadly.
"Thanks, Cas."
Cas felt as if he was floating all day at work the following day, he smiled despite a customer attempting to return a thousand dollar armoire against their policy, and he smiled past his supervisor leaving early and trusting Castiel to lock up at closing time. After he finished eating the leftover dinner Michael saved, Cas tidied up his bedroom, ensuring he had an extra pillow, and that his dirty laundry was hidden away in the hamper. He looked around his room, satisfied that it was clean enough; not that Dean cared. He looked at the clock and frowned that it was only 7:40 and he would still have at least another three hours until Dean arrived. A long shower later he was standing in his bedroom, half hard from the anticipation of finally having alone time with Dean when he pulled open his underwear drawer and smirked, remembering he had a surprise for Dean.
"How do you keep a 4.0 and show up to half your classes stoned?" Dean asked Cas while grossly chewing with his mouth open.
"No, I want to focus on school, I don't think I have time for any extracurricular's," he said, following her.
“I dunno, Cas,” Dean said, imitating his drunk friend, who didn’t notice. “Did they do the streak?”
“No, she’s weird. She called me Clarence! She knows my name, but she insists on calling me Clarence," Castiel said, annoyed.
"I am not interested," he paused. "Now if you could please move, I have class."
"My name is Castiel, by the way."
Gabe looked between his brother with his messy hair and small red marks on his neck, and Dean who looked like a deer in the headlights, his pants unbuttoned. “What’s uh, goin’ on here?” Gabe asked wearily, wagging his fingers between the two younger guys.
“Stay back, Dean!” Benny called, seeing Dean running towards him. “Help the others!” Dean stopped in his tracks and saw a flash of red before Benny was no longer on the ladder, but in the arms of the creature. Benny was thrashing wildly, the creature began to back off, it saw Dean and opened its mouth to loud out a shriek, then ran on it’s long two legs back where it had come from. “Benny!” Dean screamed, attempting to follow the two, but once it ran off into the forest Dean was unable to see where it went. His mind shifted to Charlie and sprinted as fast as he could down the path, the weight of the fire axe slowing him down. As he re-entered the woods he skidded in the snow, calling out his friend's name. When he reached a split in the path he slowed down, Charlie was sitting on a rock, shivering, appearing to have been waiting.
“Um, correct me if I’m wrong here but according to Cas-”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said as he sat down on the other side of Gabriel.
The only reason Dean went to college was because of how close to home his school was. If there wasn’t a university in Lawrence, he probably wouldn’t have gone at all; Bobby would have let him keep working at the shop. Dean gladly would have done that if it wasn't for his father's insistence he follow his footsteps so he could one day take over the firm. He gulped, feeling guilty that he hadn’t seen his brother since August, despite living only a short distance away. “I’ll come home more, I promise,” Dean vowed before pausing, “Mom and dad fighting again?”
“He hard a pretty hard time in high school, bullies ya know,” Gabriel said, “He’s trying to have a fresh start.”
Castiel kept replaying that in his head, wondering if Charlie was right or if that was just how Dean was. Castiel had only known Dean for a few weeks, maybe that was how he was with everyone, Castiel just didn't know him well enough to know. His mind's war of
Sam just nodded, understanding. “Mom was okay with him sleeping in your room all week?”
“No! Why would you say that?” Dean asked defensively.
"You boys are pretty close," John observed, noticing the way Cas was able to speak for Dean.
The group quietly ate breakfast while they waited for John and Bobby to come back, seemingly like forever. The sun was beginning to peak over the mountain, washing the cabin in soft rays as they solemnly washed up the dishes. The sun was nearly fully risen by the time the adults got back to the cabin, Jack rushed to the door to see if his sister was with them, and when he realized it was only the two older men, he pulled on his hat and mittens, his cousin barely scrambling behind him.
“He’ll probably be out at clubs or somethin’ the whole time,” Dean shrugged as he uncapped the sunscreen and passed it to Castiel whose forehead was tinted pink. “Hey, we’re going to have a kickass time, relax, babe,” Dean said, not bothering to hush his voice, Michael couldn’t hear him over the blender.
“This museum is beautiful,” Castiel observed, admiring the hand carved details in the banister, and gazing up at the stained glass window above the main entrance.
Dean shrugged and stayed silent for a moment. Cas was right, they’re already in a relationship, going on a date wouldn’t really be any different. It couldn’t possibly change things between them, could it? “I guess it wouldn’t be any different,” he said after thinking about it.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Castiel said as he extended his arm to hand Dean the glass of wine.
Castiel nodded, "That's good, I'm glad you have a place where you feel like you belong."
Castiel shifted and blinked his eyes before sitting up straight, “Ah, I missed the movie,” he said and Dean chuckled. Cas wiped his eyes and blinked a couple more times before he noticed the clock. He yawned and scooted off the bed, “I should head back,” he said with a yawn.
“So do you. I just have a bad feeling about him,” Benny shrugged.
“Yes!” He exclaimed, bucking his hips, trying to get Dean’s mouth back on him.
Cas scoffed before asking what Dean's plans were.
Sam shrugged, “They say colleges like to see at least three years of a language,” he passed a controller to Cas before settling in next to him on the couch.
"Yeah, I think it is," Dean said, looking to Charlie who's cheeks were flushed bright pink as she hiccuped, putting her hands over her mouth.
“He’s spending the summer in Miami.”
“Yeah,” Dean drew out the word, “But Gabe made it sound-”
“The journal said-”
"You read my mind!" Gabriel exclaimed with a toothy smile.
Dean turned around with a slight frown on his face, disappointed Castiel was leaving the party so early.
“I’m going to shower, come get me when you go to lunch,” she said before picking up her bra off the floor and shoving it into her backpack.
"Wasn't an hour," Charlie defended.
“If my biggest flaw is being too polite, then I’m alright with that,” he said as he shrugged off his trench coat and backpack, placing them over the back of Dean’s desk chair. “Dean, are you feeling ready for our exam?”
Dean hurried out of the truck, mroe than eager to escape the conversation with Bobby, but once he was standing on the pavement he realized it was time to face the music. He trudged inside and as he was taking his jacket off John called out to him from the living room.
“I guess,” Dean said, “you really find this interesting?” He said as he approached Castiel from behind.
“Your daddy’s not a touchy-feely guy, but he loves you. You’re his son, he always will.”
“Benny, are you fucking joking? Now isn’t the time for a goddamn lesson! Now give me the gun!”
"Meg asked me out," Castiel said, sighing loudly at his pasta dish. "She was quite persistent."
After a few minutes of silent reading in the library Charlie looked up at Castiel, "Does he know?"
"His time of the month?" Jo snorted, watching her friend storm out of the dining hall.
“I know they can, but I think you need to cut yourself some slack, you’re a very smart young man and you’re going to do great things, Sam.”
“No, Cas, you don’t have to leave because of me,” Sam said as he moved Dean’s pillow back to the head of the bed.
“It’s okay, you’re not used to holding hands with another man,” Castiel stated, nodding his head, giving his hand a gentle squeeze before letting go, not wanting to push his boundaries.
Dean decided not to respond, but to turn his attention to finding the bottle of aloe vera that Mary always kept in the medicine cabinet for times like this.
Castiel didn’t let Dean complete his apology, partially because he didn’t want to hear it, Dean had nothing to apologize for, but mostly because he just wanted to feel Dean’s lips against his again. He dropped the notebook and used his hand to wrap around Dean, and pull him in closer. Dean grabbed a fistful of Castiel’s already messy hair and tugged, shoving his face in closer, needing more. They pulled away minutes later, cheeks flushed, lips wet with saliva and out of breath.
“That’s a decent start,” Charlie shrugged before sitting forward with her elbows on her knees. “But I think you should start at
“Wait, on New Years when we played never have I ever and Ash said-”
What started off as family ski trips to their vacation home had long since become the vacation destination for the Singer’s not-children children during their coveted winter holiday break. Jo and Ash had learned to ski on the mountain soon after they learned to ride bikes, spending every weekend practicing their pizza and french fry motions as Bobby and Ellen mingled with other couples in between runs on the black diamond slopes. When Bobby and Ellen adopted sweet, extroverted, eleven year old Charlie, Jo eagerly showed her the reigns on the slopes, where she became a natural. Soon, Jo’s childhood best friend Dean and his little brother Sam joined the family on their annual trips, but they didn’t visit quite often enough to grasp the skill of skiing.
“Very,” he said, his lips smacking at the slight sour of citrus, but overall enjoying the sweet, fruity taste.
“Even without you’re an excellent candidate for Stanford, I’m sure you will get in,” Castiel assured him, knowing Sam worked incredibly hard for his dream of attending Stanford and becoming a lawyer.
He was silent for nearly the entire drive to his uncle’s garage, he wasn’t obnoxiously singing along to Led Zeppelin, his fingers weren’t drumming on the steering wheel, or poking fun at Cas for
Dean hated the thought of Cas being hurt, he didn’t deserve it, he was a good guy, Zach was just a dick.  And he didn't even know what this argument was about.
“I almost forgot,” Castiel breathed heavily, “I have a surprise for you.” His hands roamed down to begin unzipping Dean’s jeans before his were dragged off his body.
“What were you thinking?” Jo exclaimed as Dean started leading them back towards their building.
“Dean, let’s just enjoy the day.”
"So I take it you met Hope?" Benny asked, leaning on one shoulder against the wall next to Dean, lifting a beer bottle to his lips.
Gabriel was the only one who drank and put a finger down, “And you’re surprised by this?” He exclaimed.
"Maybe Bobby found it when he renovated a few years ago," Dean suggested.
Charlie raised an eyebrow and said, "That's just his face?"
"I have a doctor's appointment."
“Barely!” Dean laughed as Ellen retreated from behind the bar to pull him into a hug.
"Huh," Charlie began flipping through the old, yellowed pages. "I've never seen this before. The dates go back pretty far too. 1937, 1914, 1890."
“Ugh, not
“So was Satan,” Sam quipped with a smirk.
Dean inspected the radio as Benny and Charlie started towards the balcony. Charlie had donned a dusty old scarf Dean found in the cabinet, which turned out to be a closet of abandoned clothes. Besides the scarf, there was a pair of dirty boots that were at least two sizes too big for any of them, a couple bulky ranger jackets and a pair of gloves with a hole in the thumb. Charlie had tossed the jackets on the floor, muttering that they were probably warm before she became interested in going outside. Dean still only heard static, so he started to inspect the back of the radio, hoping there was just something that was out of place or unplugged. Despite there still being static, he called out, “Hello? SOS! Help us!” a couple times just in case, but he was sure the message was not received.
Sam and Ruby fell into silence as they made their way back down the path to the ski lift. Their hands occasionally bumped each other's until Ruby grabbed Sam's hand and gave him a reassuring squeeze. "I hope she's okay," Sam said quietly, briefly looking at Ruby before turning his attention back to focus on the path in front of them.
“Can I get a ride home for break?” Jo asked, exasperated, annoyed that she had to ask him multiple times before he actually paid attention.
He left the health center with an appointment card in hand for a week later with a doctor in downtown Lawrence. Liz also gave him a brochure about managing stress and a bright yellow smiley face stress ball. The ball was cheesy and he hated that he thought it was cute, so much so he decided throwing it in the trash can on his way out of the building, but decided it would probably be more useful to throw at Gabriel. He decided that would help his stress.
"Dude!" Dean exclaimed.
Dean jiggled the door handle impatiently and Cas called out, "I have a key," before Dean could even think about breaking a window. Dean moved to the side and cupped his hands around his mouth, breathing on them. He had forgotten to put on gloves in his huff. Castiel unlocked the door and the two hurried inside.
“It’s fucking lame!” Dean laughed, pushing himself off the ground. Jo laughed out loud when she got a better look at the van that had Gabe in stitches. It had a polar bear with a warrior woman riding it and another bear to the left.
“Hang on!” Came a muffled shout from the women’s room.
“Going on a date?” Michael said as the mustard bottle made a loud squirting noise.
“You don’t know that,” Castiel said, staring at Dean. “How can you be so sure?”
“Sammy!” Dean exclaimed, his arms outstretched, excited to see his brother for the first time in months. He had kept his promise to visit home more often, but after Spring Break when midterms picked up Dean found he barely had the time to even work the shifts he was scheduled for at the pizza shop, let alone have the free time to go home.
“Oh, that was Anna? She got us good, we were really worried.”
“Yeah, easier than Castiel, don’t cha think?” Dean said, grabbing his jeans off the floor and pulling them on, feeling suddenly very exposed in front of Castiel in just his boxers. Dean wasn’t a shy person, he knew he looked damn good, but felt uncomfortable being practically naked in front of his best friend’s brother. Who also happened to eye-fuck Dean all throughout dinner. Dean ran a hand through his messy brown hair, picking through his sheets to find his shirt and ended up finding Jo’s white tank top. “God dammit,” Dean mumbled to himself, tossing the tank top over his desk chair.
By six that evening, Dean and Sam strolled through their front door, Sam’s increasingly long hair frizzy from swimming. They kicked off their sandals by the door, sand still clinging to the soles of their feet. Dean laughed and scuffled Sam’s already messy hair as their father called out from the kitchen, “Boys is that you?”
“Dean, calm down-”
“Wow, Cas. Thanks.”
"He said he was going to do homework, maybe he went to the library," Dean said, shielding his eyes from the sun when he looked up to Gabriel standing before them.
“Now? Dean it's pretty late,” she said warily, unsure how her husband would feel about this.
“I get it I got kicked out of college!” Ash shouted sarcastically from the back office.
"Uh, yeah, Cas. I'm bi," he said with a small laugh as if it was common knowledge.
Gabe was very worried, it wasn't like Castiel to fall off the grid like this. It was almost a last resort but he decided to call Mike on the off chance that he could have heard from him.
Before Castiel could answer, the door swung open, Gabriel was now ready for dinner. “Come on, ladies.”
“I’m glad you’re home,” Sam said, his big puppy dog eyes looking at Dean. “You should come home more, it’s not the same without you.”
“You’re okay, and that’s what matters. I’m sorry I ratted on you to Gabe. I didn’t think he would flip like that.”
Dean and Castiel were in the woods searching for the redhead, calling out her name by the time Benny and Jack made it. Jack hurried to be by his cousin’s side as Benny neared Dean, announcing where he was going to look. Their light source felt insignificant in the vast darkness of the forest, but they continued trudging through the snow, hoping to reach her sooner than later.
“You must be Dean,” she opened the door further and stepped out of the doorway.
“Right there is perfect,” Dean said as Castiel turned to face the ocean. In the darkness he could barely see the waves crashing on the beach but could hear the tide. Castiel bent down so he was leaning over the railing, with his arms resting on the cool metal. He felt Dean step closer and heard the familiar rip of a condom. Soon enough he felt Dean pressing against him, gasping as he felt Dean enter him and slowly press all the way inside.
Benny narrowed his eyes, “I grew up in the bayou, you have to rely on your instincts there to survive, and I’m tellin’ you, now is not the time.”
“Dean thinks he’s a food critic because he works at Campus Pizza down the street,” Gabe rolled his eyes and took a sip from his soda.
“That’s uh, not exactly a question,” Dean said, despite knowing deep down that it was.
“Prom?” Dean asked and Cas nodded. “Nah, it’s a nice memento from the night.”
Dean and Castiel reviewed their notes for nearly an hour before they were interrupted by a knock on the door. Gabriel was half asleep, and jumped up at the sound, “What?” He called, then a moment later the door opened enough for Chuck to stick his head in.
" And how do you know this?"
Thanksgiving break was rapidly approaching, the stress of midterms was running high and it seemed all students were on edge. Dean and Gabe hadn't gone to a party since Halloween, and everyone seemed to need to blow off some steam.
Dean groaned and reached for Castiel’s arm, “The grilled cheese can wait,” he attempted to pull Cas towards him. “We’ll be quiet.”
Charlie huffed, “Yeah, I am.”
Charlie raised her empty can, then held it down, letting the last drops drip onto the carpet. “And one for the homies,” she said without half the heart Dean knew she wanted to express.
“Bed, now,” Dean pulled away and said quietly.
“Probably frozen,” Benny said, turning knobs on the radio.
“Where’s Cas? Is he going to hang out with us?” Sam asked eagerly, letting his backpack down.
“Of course I am, I’m always right,” she giggled and handed him another wet dish. “So what’s so weird about Castiel’s uncle?” She asked, intrigued about Zachariah because all that she knew about him was over the winter when he and Cas had an argument that lead to Cas spending a week at the Winchester’s, but was never told the full story.
Gabriel nodded before turning around and exiting back to the main living space, afraid his brother was alone and bored. Luckily, Gabriel was wrong. He found Castiel out on the deck sitting on a plastic chair that looked like it was going to break at any moment. A brown haired guy passed Castiel a joint, who took it eagerly and inhaled deeply.
“Gone, what do you mean gone?” Ruby asked, Sam rubbed her back reassuringly as Dean and Charlie sat by the fire, wrapped in blankets.
Castiel sighed and ran a hand through his hair, tapping his leg anxiously. Without the pills Castiel was trying to settle his anxiety with pot alone, and it was not working after well over a year of daily pills and combined
“How about we stay here,” Dean nipped at Castiel’s ear, making him jump and whimper, his pants now painfully tight.
"That seems easy enough," Castiel said, giving the sign in sheet a once over.
“I will,” Castiel said, still staring at his apple, processing what just happened. “Zachariah-”
Dean pulled away, out of breath. "You sure you want to do that here?"
Dean was extremely uncomfortable, if he had known this would involve Luke he may not have mentioned it to Gabe. Gabriel tried to brush off everything with Luke, but Dean knew him well enough to know that he cared a lot about what happened to the oldest twin.
“Come on bro,” Gabriel exclaimed, putting the joint to his lips and inhaling deeply. “You guys aren’t fooling anyone.”
“He's been MIA for a couple days, I dunno, I was just wondering if he maybe was with you.”
Castiel let out a laugh while he pulled the pharmacy bag out of his coat. “No?” He held it close to his chest before saying he had to put it upstairs.
“Can you call me? I don’t think I want to risk talking to your uncle again.”
“That trust fund of yours is gonna go dry one of these days,” Dean said, hopping off his bed and tearing open a trash bag that contained his bedding.
Soon the whir of the blender distracted Dean and Castiel from their concerns, now more ready for poolside drinks. And Dean desperately in need of another nap despite sleeping for the entire three hour flight.
Conveniently Jo and Ash showed up just moments after the food arrived, they let themselves in and Jo announced, “You got us pizza? You’re too kind."
“Jo?” Bobby said, tearing his eyes away from the vision in the flame to look at the creature. “My baby.” The creature stood silently as Bobby processed what he had just seen. “I love you so much, sweetie. Your mom and I love you dearly. You will always be my little girl. I’m going to set you free now.” The monster continued to stand there quietly, but it seemed to bow its head as Bobby called out, “John, now!”
"You are?" Cas tilted his head slightly.
"No," Castiel said shortly, and attempted to walk around Meg, but she stepped in his way again.
"Dean. I'm sorry I didn't have time to introduce you two. When he's hungry he's on a mission," Cas chuckled before turning his head back again, this time Dean was long gone.
“It’s fine, I just,” he paused, “Wish I had done something when I saw them.”
"Apparently," Dean said, watching over the younger guy, watching him blatantly ignore the girl's attempts to get his attention, Cas was still focused on talking with Andy and Adam. "Hey, Cas!" Dean exclaimed.
“Like never have I ever?” Sam quipped, earning a snort from his older brother, then shot a glare in Dean’s direction. Dean rolled his eyes, thinking that Sam just wanted any excuse to flirt with Jess.
“Shit!” He heard a man exclaim, wiping his wet hand on his denim pant leg.
“No, we get high sometimes,” Gabe grinned and Castiel rolled his eyes, but huffed out a laugh.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel greeted with a huge smile as Dean broke into an equally excited grin. He crossed the foyer as fast as he could and threw himself onto Dean, wrapping him in a huge bear hug that he had been wanting to do for weeks.
"Okay, uh, thanks." Dean hung up before Zachariah could respond, desperate to get away from the painfully uncomfortable conversation.
“I heard you had a chat with Zachariah,” Cas said, his voice a more playful and upbeat tone.
“Dean, typically people in a romantic relationship,” Dean groaned when Cas said
“I miss you.”
Dean gulped loudly and closed his eyes, yup, he cared for Castiel.
Gabriel woke up at the crack of noon, the girl from the night before in tow as they made their way down to the main living space of the condo. Castiel was preparing lunch in the kitchen when he noticed the two, so he offered to make them something.
Castiel blinked at him and Dean could feel the blue eyes drilling into his head.
"Of course, we can't turn down a party, right, Cas?" Dean said, clapping Benny on the back.
"Alright, fine," Gabe sighed, although Dean was already halfway to the door.
“He’s sarcastic as hell,” Dean mumbled through a mouthful of chips. “You’re just jealous because Cas is smart and funny and cool,” he said as he wiped his salty hands on his jeans and pushed off the desk.
Eventually the group parted so Gabriel and Castiel could go back to the freshman's dorm. “Are you going to be okay walking by yourself? You don’t need to walk me back, I think I can find my way,” Castiel asked when his brother tripped over a branch on the sidewalk.
“Okay, okay, but the real question is who gets the single room?” Gabriel asked, attempting to silence the table. Instead of silencing his friends, his question only made them louder.
“Yeah, dad,” Sam called in response as Dean strolled into the kitchen, the smell of pasta sauce guiding his way. His stomach growled loudly as John asked where they had been.
The green eyed man leaning up against the sink counter top as the man with dark messy hair tended to the small incision. “You a doctor?” He asked.
“Hello, Benny,” Cas said, pointedly not greeting his brother now.
“Is your Nintendo at your dorm?” Castiel asked, hoping the answer was no.
. You could also throw in a
Dean sighed when the door shut, relieved him and Cas could finally have some time alone and asked, “What should we do tonight?”
“I’m not,” Dean hollered, leaning back so Cas would hear him more clear. "Except special occasions," he said with a wink.
“What do you know that I do not?”
"You do!"
“Crowley? He sells me pot.”
“Is that all you do for fun?” Castiel asked, looking quizzically at his brother and his friends.
, the finest cuisine the Kansas public school system could produce. He waved to Sam, standing in line at the register, who scowled at his older brother when Jess turned her attention away from Sam for half a second to see who was waving at them. "Bitch," Dean mumbled under his breath, hoping his brother could feel his curse. When Dean sat down at his usual table no one was there yet, slightly bummed, Cas usually got to the cafeteria first and always greeted Dean with his usual toothy grin. Dean wasn't waiting long when Tessa and Charlie showed up, bickering about the latest episode of Buffy.
“I’m fine.”
“From a shopping cart. We were at the mall.”
The boys were greeted after they kicked off their shoes and walked into the main living space where they could hear music playing and their friends were chatting. At a quick first glance, Dean got a scan of the room to assess who was there- everyone seemed to be accounted for. “I think you and Benny should talk,” Charlie immediately said, jumping up and grabbing Dean’s arm, the cup in her hand sloshing around a sweet-smelling drink.
“Do you want to play?” One of the girls asked Castiel with a twirl of her long brown hair.
“I don’t think Benny would like that very much,” Dean said.
“Not what I was expecting,” Dean said, glancing back the Jo’s door. “Do you have afternoon tea together?” He asked in a fake British accent.
“Hello Mary. Thank you for allowing me to come over so late, it was very kind.”
“Come on, Charlie, I don’t wanna do this right now,” Dean groaned.
“Good. And you’re going to keep hearing it until you understand,” Zachariah pointed a finger at him, then motioned like he was going to exit his room but paused and turned his head slightly towards Castiel. “What happened with Luke was tragic, but it was his choice and I’ll be damned if another one of my kids chooses that same path.”
Castiel wasn’t surprised, Richard Roman was the student body president, the best quarterback Lawrence High had ever seen, and picking on Cas was one of his favorite past times. “How do you know?”
Sam stepped closer to Ruby to wish her luck, pulling her into a hug that she would have never normally allowed. When Sam pulled away Ruby went on her tiptoes to place a small kiss on his cheek, making him blush furiously when they pulled apart. Ruby slid gloves over her fingers and said, “Let’s go, the longer we wait the more they’re exposed,” as she looked out the window at the blustering snow.
“Don’t say it’s not like that, because i know it is exactly like that. You don’t need to hide from me, Cassie. You’re my brother, Dean’s my best friend, I’m happy for you two!” He reached over and shook his brother gently with a goofy grin.
That’s what finally does it. Castiel jerks his fingers off the planchette as though he just realized it has teeth. “Yeah. Yes. I apologize. I didn’t realize— I didn’t know the risk was—  I wasn’t trying to—” His fingers feel thick and clumsy as he scrapes the board back into the box, not quite able to get the lid on correctly.
The ghost visibly relaxes once it’s put away.
Light splashes into the room, across the bed and Castiel’s eyes, causing him to stir and blink.
Dean doesn't remember more than that, but the next morning he wakes up in bed.
Meg answers that with a beat of sarcastic silence followed by a not-asking “Really.”
Dean glowers at him too. "I'm not a fucking invalid." Sam glances up, looking pointedly at Dean's pajama pants and the blanket over his shoulders. "Shove it," Dean says and picks up his mug.
Dean shakes his head. “It’s taking all the mojo I got just to show up. I didn’t want you to keep thinking you’re alone. I mean it, Cas, okay? I’m not going anywhere. I mean, I can’t go anywhere, but also I wouldn’t. You make this place better. Best it’s been in a long, long time.”
The highway stretches out straight and lonely between empty fields of harvested corn, all under a gray afternoon sky.
"Horny." Dean grumbles, only half regretting it. It's not like it's not true. He doesn't know
It's late afternoon when he pulls up to the curb outside his new home. The place isn't that big of a deal, just a speck of a house. The immediate appeal for Dean, other than being readily available, was that he didn't have to share it—neighbors across a lawn were one thing, but people living on top of you or under you were a liability. He got to rent this whole two-bedroom house for a few hundred a month, plus utilities. The lease said he could even get a dog if he wanted one. But the thing that had sealed the deal for Dean was the kitchen. It was just a kitchen, and kind of small, but it was sunny and clean and  there was something about the reddish wood of the cabinets that felt homey and familiar. Like he could spend some time here. Plus the place came partially furnished, which is to say it was sporting a queen-sized bed and a dresser in one room and an old, heavy-legged table with chairs in the kitchen that matched the wood of the cabinets.
They’re in the kitchen. Castiel with his suit coat off and tie loose at his neck as he examines his benefits package folder, Dean leaning back in a chair with his boots on the kitchen table. If he weren’t a ghost that would be precarious and unsanitary.
"Get your mind out of the gutter." Cas dusts his hands before planting them on the countertop and fixing a stare on Dean.
Castiel lays back, flat against the porch boards, and Dean bends to follow, chasing kisses. Then it’s all a tangle of lips and hips and heat, smears of sweat and paint and precome as they tease each other toward the edge. Eventually Dean’s hand is around them both, and Castiel stretches his arms over his head, against the warm wood, reveling in the weight of Dean on his thighs and the hot strokes of his hand. “That’s it, Cas, let go. I got you,” Dean whispers and pleasure swirls inside Castiel, deep and strong.
"Maybe if you weren't such an dick to him all the time he'd be around more," Sam counters. The he perks up a little, "Hey, maybe that's our problem, actually—you're such a dick, you probably ticked off something without even trying. Doesn't exactly narrow the field, but it's something."
He’s not sure how long it takes him to escape the undertow of endorphins, but Dean’s breaths are already slow and deep when Castiel is aware again, his hands resting loosely on Cas’s back. Castiel doesn’t want to move. He could fall asleep right here, like this, listening to the steady beat of Dean’s heart. But then,
“You’re right. I was going to say that my experience of family wasn’t what yours was. I can tell you loved them, cherish the memories of them. It’s in part why you’re here, I suspect. And I know you had a brother, but you barely talk about him.” Castiel moves to join Dean at the table, sliding into a chair beside him and resting a hand palm up, an invitation for a connection. “I’d like to know more, if you’d tell me.”
Based on the fact that she’s now calling him for the third day in a row, he doesn’t think she’s buying it. He accepts the call and pinches the phone between his ear and shoulder, continuing to fiddle with his screwdriver and new outlet covers.
Sam flashes him one of his tidy grins. "We can fix that."
And that’s something else Castiel has learned, is learning—how to strip Dean of his defenses. How to make him accept love, feel pleasure. It’s a worthwhile lesson.
“Uh-uh,” Dean disagrees, scooping hands behind Castiel’s thighs and lifting.
He begins to feel the tension wound tight around Dean unravel. He kisses the top of a hip, the dip of Dean’s spine, encouraging unseen knots to come undone. Castiel slips another finger beside the first, hurriedly licking it slicker before he does. He sweeps them up once, pulses them against that most sensitive spot. When he makes a pass with his two fingers spread open, pushing wide and skimming along either side, Dean mumbles an approval. Cas’s fingers circle and smooth, and little by little Dean lets go. Cas feels him slacken from toes to shoulders, until his whole body’s gone pliant.
Sunlight spills onto the bed now, hits the wall on the opposite side of the room around their shadows. Dean stays quiet as he takes long, slow drags, their sharp breaths and bitten-off moans the only sounds in the room. Cas rocks his body up, hooking his ankles around Dean's ass, forcing him close, deep. "Dean," he whispers, clipped and desperate, and Dean sees he has his own cock in hand, jacking it steadily in the wake of Dean's hips. He thrusts short, trying to keep it on the slow side, but Cas is insistent and Dean loves the blunt force of it.
Castiel isn’t sure what he expected. He’d guessed the ghost was male from the few husky chuckles and the late-night sports network watching, but whatever else he’d imagined was not this. Ghosts in the popular imagination are always in Victorian-era sleep shirts or uniforms from wars long over. They don’t dress like grunge rock rejects.
“Ooh, how exotic. You really aren’t a local boy, then. Well, angel baby, I’m Meg and these—” she plants a hand against a row of thick-spined books “—are the plumbing manuals.” Castiel nods but before he can step forward to examine the titles, Meg slips between him and books, sidling sideways. “If you need anything else, don’t be shy.”
And then he leaves and spends the night on Meg’s couch.
He begins to marshal Cas in the direction of the bedroom, but hesitates for a second. Cas glances over his shoulder, head cocked. Dean looks at Cas, looks at the counter, looks back at Cas.
"Yeah," Dean answers tightly as the first spark of pain hits. He shifts the pillow uncomfortably.
Not too far in the future, Dean finds a bank that will give him a loan, if Lisa cosigns, and hole in the wall dive for cheap outside of South Bend and sets up shop. He calls it the Winchester Diner because, well, nobody ever accused him of being original. Folks like the name and most choose to chuckle over menu items like
Dean starts his goodbyes with Bobby. Bobby tells him to shut his trap and stop talking like he's dying. When Dean gives him a flat look, Bobby snaps, "You know what I mean," and walks out of the room.
“I don’t want to go,” Dean whispers, gruff. “You just got here.” Castiel laughs, but Dean is all seriousness. “Take care of the old place, okay?” he says, but what Castiel hears is
Because if Cas is fine and hasn't been whammied by witches, Dean has to start facing the fact that Cas made out with him on purpose. And if that's the case, he really has no freaking clue what the next move is.
"Lube," he half jokes as he pushes his trousers off his hips. "There's probably some in—" But he can't finish the thought as a surge of solid, aching
Cas darts him a sharp look. He finishes with his first aid silently and turns back to the sink.
After pie and coffee, Lisa's family leaves and Sam takes off to make the drive back to South Bend because he has a paper due Monday or something sadistic like that, and Ben scampers upstairs to go play Xbox with one of his cousins, who's staying the night. Lisa sighs happily and shoots Dean a grin. Then she stands to clear the plates, thanking Dean with a compliment and a kiss on the cheek as she goes. "Today I'm thankful that you play house with us," she comments as she heads toward the kitchen and Dean freezes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean's brain flatlines a little as Cas seizes another kiss from him, hips still pumping against Dean's hand. It's when he realizes Cas is trembling that he remembers there's a bed nearby. He doesn't know if the trembling is because Cas is exhausted or just that turned on, but he has a solution for both.
“Hello, Dean.”
"The fuck?" He tries to block the beam of light with his hand. "Turn it off."
Castiel has already connected the dots Sam is about to, so he knows what he says next will hurt. “Dean seems to be afraid I’m going to leave him.”
They come through with a flash of light. It hurts from the inside out, like everything from Dean’s hamstrings to his guts is being ripped up through his chest. But that's still better than 100% of everything that could have happened to any of them in Purgatory.
Dean beams. “Lead the way.”
Castiel meets ecstasy like a precipice he's unafraid to stand upon.
Dean stops breathing for a second. This ability of Cas's to pop up anywhere seems less convenient and more cosmically unfair now that the apocalypse is over—a guy should always have the option to avoid the dude he accidentally made out with a month ago. He reaches down to retrieve the mayo and Cas watches him, head cocked in anticipation of an answer.
Castiel swallows his bite of sandwich but his appetite is gone.
He tilts his head back and kisses Dean then, sideways and sloppy but just as determined, almost desperate.
Castiel narrows his eyes, studying Ava as she fidgets. His former coworkers would have eaten her alive. He reaches into his overcoat’s breast pocket for his checkbook.
“There’s an old farm house just outside of town. I understand it’s been empty for several years.” He wonders again about what he’d found in the china hutch—the fountain pen, the shoe polish, the toy soldier that’s still standing sentry over his dining room.
He turns off the water himself, aware that his legs are beginning to feel weak once again. He braces an arm against the shower wall and runs a hands down his face, scratching his fingers through the beard growth he'd allowed in Purgatory. Dean had been correct, however. Castiel does feel better. Restored, if not in strength or grace then in spirit. But there are still so many unknowns ahead of him—of them. He doesn’t know where to begin.
Castiel wags his head, peanut butter still preventing speech, and reaches for the water bottle.
Castiel flinches and presses his forehead to Dean's, silently begging forgiveness as he wills himself on.
One of Dean’s hands slides limp off to the side as he lets out his first snore.
He slips his hand around Cas's hip, fingers easily finding the dark scruff there. Dean tucks his nose against the back of Cas's neck and breathes deep—he woke up half hard and just touching Cas makes him harder. His fingers find Cas's own sleep-soft dick and he palms over it, fingers tucking down around the loose skin, cupping his balls. He massages, gently, uses his thumb to coax things along. Cas stirs, giving a sleepy, questioning hum. Dean smiles and kisses his shoulder in reply.
She takes it and shakes weakly, still distracted, but when he tries to release her, she squeezes tight, not allowing him to let go.
This kiss starts deep and stays slow. Dean slides one hand up the back of Castiel’s neck, fingers burying in his hair, while his other thumb strokes the jumping pulse in Castiel’s neck in a way that drives heat straight to Castiel’s groin. They chase each other’s taste between breaths and Castiel rakes his fingers down Dean’s bare back and sides, forever enchanted by all that inviting skin, by the warm swells of muscle, by Dean alive and well under his hands.
Castiel misses Dean. He wonders if Dean thinks he’s returned to New York. Or, worse, that Castiel has confirmed Dean’s biggest fear and abandoned him. The knots in his stomach over that thought prevent him from accepting most of the food Meg offers, but that hasn’t stopped her from trying.
Dean exhales.
Castiel blinks. He can’t see the screen, but that’s the jingle to the local car dealership, cut off mid-word—
"I said you could have me, Dean," Cas grates.
He shivers.
Castiel shivers at his own touch, thighs flexing tight around Dean. “You can’t see me,” he reasons, but his hand is already working his shaft, thumb sweeping up over the crown at the top of his stroke.
Cas is still sleeping.
"It's not what you think," Dean says through clenched teeth. Cas isn't exactly being gentle.
Sam looks up at Castiel with wide eyes before turning to squint out at the never-ending highway. He doesn’t share what he’s thinking, but it’s clear he’s had some kind of breakthrough.
"We had one of those lying around?"
As soon as he reaches the upstairs hall, he hears an outraged howl. It’s Dean. Castiel hurls himself down the stairs and skids to halt next to where Sam is crumpled on the floor, not far into the living room. He’s bloodied and bruised but conscious, and staring at Dean.
There isn't a clock in Dean's room that can be read in the dark, but it doesn't matter. The cycle of days and nights would be undetectable from the depths of the Men of Letters’ bunker, except that Castiel now feels a circadian pull. It's likely late.
As he moves back he's greeted by Cas's blinking blue stare. Dean grins at him. "Mornin'."
Meg gasps. “Oh. Yeah, okay. You’ve got some paranormal something going on there.”
Dean hasn't gone shopping for real groceries in more than a week. He's been punking out on dinner duties left and right. Sometimes he'll stare at the contents of the fridge for fifteen minutes and see a dozen things he could throw together with what's there but will have zero interest in making it happen. He doesn't think too hard about why that is, putting it down to longer days at the parts store and a new addiction to late-night
He heats beans, makes some rice. Downs three glasses of water. Pisses twice.
“No. No no no no, I’m not leaving. I can’t leave. Sam! Sam, Jesus, look at you! You grew up. And Cas—” Dean’s voice breaks and so does Castiel’s dam of restraint. His face crumples in tears and he lets out a sob as the flame glow reaches Dean’s ribs. It’s starting to emanate from him rather than consume him.
"I've told you," Cas wags his head dismissively. "Each time I come back, it's worse."
“Okay. Wow, okay.” Sam sinks into a brainstorming mode. “Please know I’m not blaming the victim here, but is there anything you know of that may have caused him to do those things? Lock you in, for example?”
Dean grins up at him in a way that’s both annoying and charming. “Nah. Bugging you is in the job description, or haven’t you been listening?”
“Haven’t you heard of YouTube? It’s all the rage,” she says as she unloads her books onto a nearby counter. “Hardly anybody uses a library for things like that these days.”
Dean grins and gets set. Cas bites his bottom lip and strains, silent, as Dean pushes in. Dean groans loudly and starts in on a string of curses, overloaded by the hot pressure, but he's cut off by Cas slapping a palm over his mouth and narrowing his eyes. He almost laughs but doesn't, only huffs from deep in his lungs, too distracted by the tight fit of Cas's body anyhow.
Every time he comes it's the best sex Dean has ever had and he hates that about it, hates that he has a curse to thank for that. But Cas just rolls his body with Dean's—patient and steady and willing—and makes him come again.
“No matter how many times you tell him, he’ll keep doing it. You’re too polite, Cassie,” Gabriel said from his bed, casually flipping through a magazine.
Castiel nodded eagerly before following Dean out the back door onto a small porch. “Thank you, Dean.” He sat down on a step and ran his hands through his messy black hair, Dean couldn’t help but notice he made his hair look even more messy. Castiel’s hair was naturally messy and uncontrollable so he tended to just let it be and not fuss over fixing it. Castiel pulled the other joint he had rolled out of his pocket and brought it to his lips while he dug around his pockets for his lighter.
“Dean! Get me a beer!” Gabriel called as he used all his strength to free an arm from the sand, wiggling his empty fingers in the air.
Dean's eyes widened, he glanced to his notebook then back to Cas, who was focused once again on the lecture, but had a small smirk in the corner of his lips.
“Lisa?” Dean almost laughed, “Really, Cas?”
Castiel nodded as his older brother stood up, swaying, “But not too early.”
“And Ruby, and Benny!”
Dean groaned and shifted, his right arm tugged out from under the pillow Cas’s head was atop. Castiel yawned and nuzzled his head into the pillow.
“I’m okay, things are,” she paused, “tense.”
“Well I’m sure you’re the exception,” she said with a smirk.
“You and Dean have fun?” Gabriel wiggled his eyebrows at his younger brother.
Castiel sighed, “Things could be better.”
“Alright, it must have been a left back there,” Dean said, starting to turn back.
“No we didn't call Cassie. Mike,” Gabe yawned.
Dean’s back was pressed against his bedroom door, cushioned by sweatshirts and towels hanging on the back of the door. His hands were in Castiel’s shaggy hair, tugging slightly, earning a low groan into their mouths. Taking the opportunity, Dean’s tongue slid into Castiel’s open mouth as Cas’s hands moved away from his shoulders to his waist. Fingers gripped tightly into Dean’s soft cotton shirt, desperately pulling it upwards. Dean sucked Cas’s lip into his mouth and nipped, hands slipping down his back, pulling him closer. Castiel bucked his hips into Dean when he felt the nip, then Dean’s hands wandered further to land on denim. His hands squeezed, and pulled him in closer.
“Are you sure this is a good idea? What if the tower catches on fire?” Ruby asked.
He felt a hand smack him upside the head, followed by, “Shut up,” from Bobby.
“You’re a bad influence,” Jo laughed.
about Castiel. He didn’t care about him like he cared about Gabriel, who drove him nuts by repeatedly pranking Dean but he knew he only did it to make Dean laugh. Nor did he care for him the way he does for Sammy, his best friend, the only person Dean would move heaven and hell for- but he would never care for anyone that much. He worried about where Cas was, if he was safe. Dean was as worried- no he was more worried about Castiel these past few days than he was after Lisa was out of school for almost two weeks when her grandfather was ill. He cared for Cas more than the way he cared about Lisa. Lisa who he chased after for years before she agreed to go out with him, the Lisa who Dean bought a stupid promise ring for because he was in love with her.
Gabriel had noticed over the past few weeks his brother and his best friend were becoming closer and closer, but right now, they were practically on top of each other. He furrowed his brows quizzically, but neither noticed because they were still too wrapped up in laughter. After a few minutes Castiel's laughter died down and he was finally able to catch his breath.
Cas groaned and let his head drop to one side, "Okay, but you're helping me clean!"
"Nah, it was all her," Benny said before taking a long sip of his beer.
“They’re sweet,” Cas said with a smile, following behind the two teenagers, Dean  put an arm around Castiel’s shoulders and gently knocked their heads together before pulling away despite wanting to linger. Castiel sighed when Dean pulled away, wishing him and Dean would be able to show their affections in public- he knew Dean was not ready for that, but he hoped someday he would be.
Everyone was armed with a drink and a backup one, knowing they likely would have to open it sooner than later. Jack, who didn’t like alcohol, had a couple sodas that Charlie brought as mixers. “Alright, bitches, let’s get drunk!” Charlie announced and pulled the first card. The game began, but only lasted a couple rounds before someone brought up Jo and Ash. Benny got up from the circle and stormed off, slamming the bathroom door behind him. Dean snorted, and called “Good riddance, nobody wanted you here anyway,” after him.
“Or maybe there’s a radio up there!” Ruby offered hopefully.
“Bullshit!” Gabriel almost laughed.
“What’s gotten into you, man?” Michael asked when he entered into the main living space of the condo.
“I'm serious, look,” he said, practically shoving the costume into his brothers arms, suggestively raising his eyebrows.
She scoffed, "You gay or something, Clarence?" with an attitude, a hand on her hip.
“He’s probably nervous, telling someone how you feel about them for the first time is very nerve wracking,” he spoke quietly so he wouldn’t disturb the tour guide’s lecture on Mesopotamia.
“Here?” Castiel asked, now he was really unable to think straight, his blood rushing to his dick.
“You can crash with me t’night, no biggie,” Dean shrugged before pulling open the door to his dorm.
“Ugh, I take it back!” Dean exclaimed with a laugh, but Mary wasn’t hurt, she just leaned over and kissed his cheek.
“Dean.”
“She single?” Dean smirked before pounding his fist on his door. “Let’s go!”
“For tonight, I appreciate your willingness to go on a date with me,” Castiel said as if it was obvious.
“Hiya Cas,” Dean said smoothly, acting as if he didn't just run up a flight of stairs in a few steps to get to the phone.
He ran his hands through his hair and settled into a more comfortable seated position so he was sitting with his legs crossed, silent for a minute while he thought of what he would be saying to her right now if she wasn't deep under the lush, green grass. “College is fun, but it’s not the way I pictured without you there, you’d have loved it. We go to parties, and art shows, have late night Star Trek marathons that you would hate. Dean and I even went to Miami with Gabe for spring break. Dean is,” he paused with tears in his eyes, “Dean’s my boyfriend. You’d love him, Ruby. He’s so funny, and such a smartass. You two would be like peas in a pod- he always has a comeback to everything just like you do,” he allowed himself to laugh.
After what felt like an eternity of silence, Charlie said solemnly, "I think it's time we called Bobby." No one responded save for a few nodding heads with a look of understanding on their face. Charlie gulped as she set her mug down on the coffee table and took a few deep breaths as she made her way down the hall to the landline by the front door. They could hear her say hello a couple times, each time getting louder. Dean stood up to check on his friend, giving Castiel's shoulder a reassuring squeeze on his way up. Charlie called out again as Dean came up behind and asked what was wrong.
“Get fresh air, go swimming, throw rocks at birds, I don’t care!” Sam said in a huff.
Castiel inhaled, then after he blew out smoke said, “Just pot Gabriel,” he handed it back to him.
“Nothing-”
“When the hell are ya gonna take out the trash?” Ellen asked loudly before pouring a beer for John. Within a few seconds Ash exited the office, waving halfheartedly to the Winchesters as he went into the kitchen to get the trash.
“Alright?”
“You’ve been talking an awful lot about this Cas, is he in your major?” Mary asked, scooping a spoonful of peas onto her plate.
“Stay here,” Dean said, putting a hand into a gesture for ‘stay’ as he focused the flashlight on the path. He heard the door closed and wasn’t surprised that a moment later, Castiel, wielding the fire poker was on his heel.
The other man laughed and inspected his hand, there was a small cut where the glass broke skin, but it was surely going to heal quickly. “Dean,” he extended his other hand out to the other man, who shook it after he finished drying his hands.
His roommate either understood or didn’t care to press him because he didn’t say anything as Cas attempted to busy himself with the assignment he had abandoned.
Michael, Gabriel and the girls walked over to the volleyball net to begin their game. “D’ya want to go for a walk?” Dean asked, leaning up so he was resting on his elbows and put his baseball cap on top his head.
"What are you doing?" He asked in a huff.
Sam shook his head and hurried up the stairs to get his own swimsuit and towel for their day at the lake.
By the time Jo knocked on the door to 610 Dean and Gabe had already consumed most of a 12 pack. Dean grinned at her as he opened the door, noticing she had changed out of her knee length athletic shorts into a pair of dark jeans that hung dangerously low on her hips and a white tank top. She noticed him checking her out, rolled her eyes and put her backpack down on the floor with a clank.
Dean didn’t respond, he knew what Cas meant. He was with this Crowley guy for the sex and drugs.
"I miss Hive," Cas said simply.
"He had to leave Daddy," Informed Henry who reached out, Dean taking the bait lifted his son up. "He said to say hello, can we eat I'm starving."
* * *
"Excellent, my brother Gabriel is always taking issue over my lack of pop culture references, perhaps with your help, I could surprise him," queried Cas walking over to the door.
"Whatever! You're right I can find something more fun than that." she sauntered away as quick as she came. Something felt off though like she was merely here fishing for something, giving in to his paranoia Cas picked up his phone:
"What's this?" she asked taking the scroll into her hand and causing Cas' heart rate to pick up as she began toying with the ribbon.
"Uh oh," whispered Charlie giving Dean a very bad feeling.
"Oh, Dean this is spectacular." sighed Cas looking content while at the same time his body vibrated with the need to explore. "Now I must meet this Missouri," he exclaimed looking at Dean hopefully.
"There you are, I've been looking all over for you!" Cas turned at the voice of his brother Gabriel, who bounded up to him panting. Cas would guarantee it was for flair, not due to any strenuous activity.
"His dedication to food is a big part of him," agreed Cas.
Finally approaching he felt too weird to speak, so he nodded and caught some eyes before parking himself next to Ash. A few minutes pass leaving Dean none the wiser, he was about to ask when he noticed everyone sending furtive glances at Gabriel's plate, soon the crunchy sound of vegetables broke the silence.
"He was abusive, physically and emotionally sometimes he didn't even need the drink to be like that. It got worse when he found out about me, I don't even know how he found out, sometimes I think he just sensed it. For John Winchester having a gay son was the worst thing to ever happen to him second to losing his wife."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Really brother, I think you and Cas are like endgame or something," Benny nodded his head before departing leaving Dean with a lot to think about.
"Hah, not enough to lose," he replied cockily and lying completely.
"Cas, that's stupid I just do it as a hobby, I'm a mechanic."
"But I crunched the numbers,"
"For work, you?"
"What was that about, Dad?" asked Henry
“Yeah actually I haven’t eaten so you can cook me those pancakes of yours,” he replied, pulling the door back to let her through.
"No, Dean hasn't turned up."
"Told you he'd think about it," said Sam speaking to Charlie.
"Don't forget Scarlett Witch, Professor Hulk and that honest to God hero rat!"
What?
"So the opposite then?" Dean stilled once again his attempt at a reply coming out only in vowel sounds.
Oh God, he didn't mention food in his note either, had Cas already eaten? Was he a vegetarian? "Yeah, um I thought we could eat while watching the game, sorry I should have checked only it's after seven and I just thought you'd be hungry." Dean can feel the panic lick at his skin, should he take the food away or...
Cas watched in amusement as Dean did a double take before taking Cesar' hand, "Good to meet you both, I'm Dean and this is Cas." They all smiled Cas shaking hands (both really strong) as well.
Sam who would have been all over this turn of events stays silent knowing how big this is for him.
Dean opened his eyes gasping at the weight suddenly placed on his lap, “Dude that hurt!” Groaned Dean finding Sam stood over him after he’d unceremoniously dropped his laptop on Dean’s lap.
Catching sight of the others Dean headed over to the picnic bench under a tree, passing a load of Firefly and Maniac (impressive, have you seen that show?) cosplayers.
"Hey, happy birthday." she greeted crouching down to speak to Henry. "I must say you've got great taste kid, you picked out some really awesome plants." Henry blushed under the praise as he offered to show her his daisies.
calenders on the wall all with the first three days open.
"I should have figured, you little monster." he proceeds to tickle him until he's screaming blue murder. "You didn't have to wait for me," Dean tells him once he abandons the tickling, looking up to find Cas watching them with a look of, whatever it is Dean can't decide it's a lot of different things all warring for first place. And in a blink, it's gone replaced with a happy smile that doesn't reach his eyes.
Cas' head popped up on hearing that, they weren't due to open for another half hour, meaning Gabriel wasn't here for leftovers it was rare for him to be up this early on a Saturday.
"Yeah so."
* * *
The journey was quick, Henry happily singing along to a Disney soundtrack (in all honesty so was Sam). On their arrival Sam made sure to park as close to the entrance as possible, knowing Henry would be likely to run off in his excitement.
"Sam will be there and you'll have already been to the house by that point and you can invite your brother or someone from the center, please think about it no pressure." Cas nodded leaving Dean feeling victorious (prematurely but so what).
"You two are mean." knowing he couldn't let that fly after Ellen had cooked for him, he was quick to add, "Thanks for the food, Ellen."
"Oh God, what do they use as the blanket?"
* * *
But they liked other each, Sam said Cas was cool. Besides Sam wasn't mean he was the good Winchester.
Henry drops the bag to the floor shuffling a bit until he's more in the center. Meaning Dean will have on one dead leg when he tries to get up and Cas will be in the same boat. Cas doesn't object just gives that smile Dean likes so much before giving his attention to Henry.
Chuckling at his brother (all the while ignoring his scowl) Dean took his seat making sure to buckle in immediately. Seat belts were absolute protection against falling out of the Goddamn sky after all.
Dean quickly headed inside without a word, setting the gift down he could hear Sam fill in the conversation. Dean knew he was acting like an idiot or worst a sullen child. He had to get over it, so what if Cas brought someone along the extra help would be a benefit. Deciding to shut up and get on with it Dean plastered on a smile and went back outside, finding Cas talking to the mystery woman by the van.
"Uncle Sammy, hurry up," called Henry from the hallway, after saying a quick goodbye Dean was alone. Fishing out his phone he stood staring at it, it wasn't like he was averse to Cas helping them, he could see the sense in it.
Smiling Cas continued, "Should we talk about everything?" Dean knew that meant himself.
With the air a little clearer Dean found Cas his black hair mostly white, "Dean, don't look at me,"
"Yes, are you being serious right now?"
"Thank you, Dean," says Cas taking a much longed for sip, "Have you seen the others in there?" asked Cas gesturing back to the lounge.
In this chapter:
After the little display at the coffee shop, he felt certain Dean had a crush. Getting through to Dean and past his hang-ups wasn't a task he was relishing. Also, he was a little jealous, things were going to change so much for Dean if he was willing. Sam wanted someone, someone he could look after and build a life with.
"See what I mean," Cas nodded at Sam only Dean didn't see anything, what were they discussing again.
"Can we all go back to ours?" asked Sam.
"Sorry I'm late Cas, how come you're out here?" he asked, only Cas is too busy sending a lustful gaze at Baby. Since Cas doesn't answer Dean quickly does a sweep with his eyes of the other man - praying Cas won't notice - he's wearing black jeans teamed with a blue t-shirt, he looks good. Getting a little closer without knowing why, until he can smell Cas, that's what he wanted. And holy shit he smells
"Gabriel is more suited to the fun side of things, it would be so much worse left to him and I have a head for figures." Dean's mind flashed back to first meeting Castiel, he may have a head for figures but he had one impressive physique too.
Fuck! Gabriel knew, but Sam couldn't show this side of himself. Growing up he'd always had to be strong, to know when to shut up and not cry or face the wrath of his father.
Currently.
"This has nothing to do with Dad and Henry's fine." Dean had jumped up from his seat his blood boiling with anger.
"Dude, where are you going?"
"I didn't mean that, you know what never mind." Dean wasn't going to fall for that backtrack, he'd be having a conversation with Gabriel later. "Anyway I'm sure Dad would love to see everything Dean, he's in the garage." Oh, that was a little much or too soon perhaps both not that he was trying to avoid his Dad he just felt like he was letting him down which was stupid.
* * *
"Hey!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam had returned to Bobby's almost two weeks ago and Dean's constant mother hen behavior (Sam's words, God Dean was allowed to be worried!) had him threatening to pull out of today. The last two months with Cas had been amazing, containing the best sex of Dean's life, certainly not a hard feat after his past encounters. Being with Cas was everything he dreamed he could never have, even better was Cas was one kinky bastard and Dean had discovered his submissive side.
"Baby, you're not in the right headspace right now, especially after telling me all that, but I'd love to snuggle the hell out of you as long as you want that?"
"Charlie you're a genius." he told her grabbing all necessary items and running out the door to his baby, all the while ignoring her demands that geniuses deserve pay rises.
Weirdly Cas smiles, "Hello Dean, are you currently under the influence of any impairing substances?" God, who talked like that?
What could it be? Some kind of trouble, his mind suddenly flashing at instances of Cas checking his phone and being jumpy.
"What? Charlie," not her too.
Damn secondary trap.
"Wait, are we doing normal presents as well?"
Wow, Dean pulled back before moving again, this time he kissed Cas a little more intensely, he tasted so good and felt even better in Dean's arms.
"Yeah, I had no part in it, to be honest I'd sort of accepted my feelings as a lost cause by then." fuck that was hard to hear.
Because of her, he had faith.
"How would you feel right now if Cas came through that door laughing and obviously on a date with another guy?"
"Besides an advent calendar, I'd love to get decorating,"
"Stop teasing or I'll have to punish you later," smirked Sam his voice sounding strong and confident knowing exactly what it did to Gabriel.
Cas loved that classics, while Gabriel favored anything animated and Die Hard ended in a fight. Elf they were planning to watch again.
* * *
A project along with pie should buoy his mood only it wasn't working, he was too distracted both Gabriel's and Benny's words running through his head. Along with the memory of a perfect kiss in a bathroom with Cas, finally knowing how Cas tasted and felt in his arms was bliss. Only they haven't spoken since the kiss ended with his favorite Cas smile before he departed asking for time, managing to wrangle Henry out of the house in record time while battling between delight and a quickening sense of fear.
"Really?" Dean nodded, "I want to see them,"
"Yes, yes I'm a scoundrel, but can we please lower our voices." Bal found it a shame to ask being one who loved dramatics but it was for the greater good.
Cas who had sauntered back was about to speak, Dean quickly jumped in, "Don't even think about it Cas," no way was Dean dressing up in tights.
Behind the table was a redheaded lady dressed as an elf, "Back again Sugar, why you just can't keep away huh?" she asked smiling.
"No, she left. Henry was ten months old, I don't even know why because it was so obvious how much she loved him." Dean stops knowing he can't continue, not that there's much more to it really.
"Join us when you finish, Cas." implored Sam.
"Actually it is rather funny," stated Cas chuckling, "Even more so when I think about you three clearing this mess up, Dean come upstairs to get cleaned." smiled Cas quickly shaking off the excess flour before walking out the door.
"So can I interest you in a glass of almond milk to go with that tart?" Dean asked Cas once they were alone, knowing Cas kept coffee for mornings.
Can he change? Does he want to?
"Not much, luckily he's still got his flower glow." Dean smiles knowing how guilty Sam feels for not being around, though he can't deny enjoying the space with one less body around. His own mind's been a little preoccupied lately. "Are you able to head home for a shower and some sleep?" he asks not holding out much hope of either.
To distract himself Dean thought back to last night, Sammy's birthday was celebrated in style at a few bars with great food. The fun was still continuing having driven up from Lawrence in Baby (who was safe in a special parking lot) they were now headed to Las Vegas for a Convention, mainly Star Wars but a lot of other fandoms too.
"Yeah I know, I'll say goodbye to Henry before grabbing my things from the car." smiling again Cas walked over to Henry, Dean stood compelled to watch never feeling more thankful for Henry's school trip than he did now, soon he's moving until he's next to the man.
"Better?" asked Bobby, Dean nodded, "Sam told me Henry has been missing Cas,"
He shouldn't be doing this or thinking such things but it's too good a mix of arousal and desire pooling in his stomach. He rolls his hips up pushing himself against his hand, all the while stroking faster, always faster. He's so close until finally, he comes hard to the image of Cas looking at him as if he's a tasty morsel to be eaten.
All four of them piled in grabbing something, Henry attempting a big one before finally conceding defeat and taking something smaller. Soon he found more enjoyment in barking out orders to the others, something he relished too much in Dean's opinion. After many layouts they finally found the one, it was joyous news all around since the sun had come out and everyone was sweaty.
"Gabe we bought a stand for it," said Dean while holding zero desire to get under this prickly tree it was the principle of the matter.
Shit! By the time his brain had triggered Dean was already moving rushing to push Cas through the door, he made it, however, he'd been outsmarted.
"Dean, calm down." Dean gasps at the light touch of Cas' hand on his wrist, the noise making Cas withdraw. Yet he can still feel the heat of it and he really wants it back. "Sit down." Dean does as instructed, his first thought is that the couch is definitely too small. He's squashed up right against Cas, their legs touching, he can't say he doesn't like it, Cas' body heat is too good.
"That makes sense, weirdly I have my Dad to thank for that. As far as parenting goes he certainly showed me what not to do. Cas, I really appreciate you trusting me with this." Cas turned back to him looking a little happier.
"Gabe, I just can't..." began Sam.
He hadn't thought so, but Cas was Sam's friend. So he wanted to be nice to the guy and not intimidating. You had to invest in Cas, he needed coaxing out of his shell, and of course with Gabriel and Sam being so wrapped up in each other it had led to them hanging out on occasion.
"Sam."
Dean stopped the thought from forming again, mainly because it wasn't comforting or helping him understand what he was seeing. Truthfully it wasn't really a salad, it was all fancy! Sure there was a huge pile of leaves, but along for the ride was something orange, rice, mushrooms (he knew those two) and some type of beans.
"Cas you went through a trauma, it'll take time getting back to normal." Dean rubbed his neck before broaching the next part, Cas always made him so nervous. "I did have an idea," (truthfully it was Ellen's idea but Cas didn't need to know that).
"I can't say I'm surprised, whoever sent this are complete morons," said Gabriel closing the lid.
"Isn't that my job?" ventured Dean sure he heard Cas mutter something about hetero-normative relationships paired with a few swear words.
"That was your brother!" what a fucking gene pool!
Sam arrived clutching his favorite book (nerd) by James Novak, "Dean, you'll never guess!" he said completely forgetting his manners by not introducing himself to Charlie, this was behavior very unlike Sam.
Cas smiled wickedly before answering, "So perhaps we need to do some marathon training," joked Cas.
Beaten but not down, Dean waits for re-enforcements, luckily for him, Charlie is on her way. Only first he has to explain what's going on. Quickly placing his empty cup on a neighboring table (for appearance's sake) it was just in time too as Charlie came around the corner.
Everyone agrees that Max was cool and Mel was really funny, Sam favored Duke and Cas liked Chloe.
"I'm not going to tell you, but it'll be quiet and I think you'll really love it. Can you trust me, Cas?" he nodded flashing Dean's favorite smile.
"Oh, that's cool. Look I wanted to run something by you." for whatever reason Dean couldn't get the words out, he didn't want to rock the boat, his relationship with Cas was still in its novel stages. They weren't really at the stage of favors just yet.
"Sammy let me down, I need to say hello to Cas," Sam laughed swinging Henry for a bit longer before setting him down, the kid quickly grabbed Cas' hand pulling him over to the table.
* * *
On closer inspection, it's plain to see the note has no signature, fuck he's such an idiot. And he knows all about not calling himself bad names, but he's doing it anyway. "Yes, I didn't realize." Cas shrugs as if telling him it's no big deal. "Does that mean you're coming in?"
"Why would Bal give me this?" Cas asked as it was pushed into his hands, the paper was white with tiny black flowers, the ribbon was green.
"Um, I hope you don't mind me asking, but where is Henry's Mom?" Cas asked quietly in a way that had Dean thinking he'd been undecided about going down this road.
Having dropped Henry off at school, Dean was currently waiting on Sam at their favorite coffee shop: situated close to their places of work, with good simple coffee and pie. The décor is light, nothing overcrowded with big comfy chairs. It's called The Bean Express.
"Mr Bumble!" Henry exclaimed on seeing the man headed their way. Sam moved Henry to the side away from the door.
"Someone convinced me to go with the really big turkey," he answered looking fondly in Cas' direction who was busy creating eggnog coffee.
Not once!
"I'll call him." Dean jumped at Cas' voice. "It'll be better coming from me." nodding Dean told Sam then waited from the phone to be passed over.
"You kidding, I'm getting a load of candy, watching cute pandas and snuggling against Sammy's shoulder, it'll be heaven."
“Huh?”
"Gabriel, don't you dare!" screamed Cas jumping up, the chase was on.
"You wound me Cas," Dean laughed feeling happy and light, Cas always made him feel good, "Look I've got to get to work, talk later?"
That had felt like hours ago, soon enough the silence was broken by the distant sound of Gabriel as he and Sam popped around the corner, "Dean-o, what's the sit- Cassie," Dean watched the usual jovial expression gracing Gabe's face flood away for concern as he made his way over immediately pulling Cas into his arms.
Finally, the lady left with an order of cupcakes, Dean was one step closer. "So what can I tempt you with today?" moving up to the counter, his eyes focused on the goods for sale disappointment is quick to bloom in his chest at the lack of pie.
They were discussing what to do after lunch when his cell rang, Sam reached for it glad to see it was Dean calling. This should be interesting, was Dean being as pissy as Henry had mentioned, he really hoped not.
“Sam, how are we supposed to pull this off? Sam took back the laptop moving to sit on the sofa once Dean brought his legs up "We don’t know the first thing about Christmas.”
"Found them!" cheered Gabriel pulling a pack of butterfingers out and digging in, Cas hadn't even known they were there, trust his brother to have stockpiles of candy secreted throughout the office, it sure did explain a few things. "Don't judge me, I need the pick me up after my journey, okay. Besides my free time was spent spiritedly, these college kids Cassie, they've got stamina.
In the end, the Winchesters realized Christmas was pretty fucking great.
After having such a good time  -Dean was totally basking in all the good comments about Baby - the whole scene felt off. "Weird the door feels a little stiff," commented Cas mainly to himself but loud enough for Dean to hear and have everything click into place.
Cas smiled encouragingly, settling Dean nerves since he really didn't want to push his luck. "I'd like that Dean." Cas scooted over in the booth, confusing Dean until he realized if he was going to inform Cas who everyone was it'd work better if they were sitting together. Shaking his head at his own idiocy he got up and sat next to the gardener, only the booth wasn't very accommodating for two grown men, they had to squash in, their sides against each other, Dean's body heated up from the contact, he was once again enveloped in the scent of Cas' cologne, it was heady. Dean did his best to ignore it opening his photos for Cas to get acquainted with his friends.
Driving home Dean was fuming over a day of obstacles, truthfully he was mostly to blame and was close to shouting at himself in the rear view mirror.
"Grab that too, Sammy, because later we're staging a prank."
Cas shook his head unable to imagine it, "I've heard Eggnog is both flavorful and foamy,"
"Can I get you a drink?" Dean rubs his neck unconsciously before adding, "I don't have any beer, is coke okay?" Cas nods moving towards the couch as Dean heads to the kitchen.
The Car show had expanded so much since he last went, they didn't even stop for lunch, rather grabbing takeaway burritos and coffee to continue sightseeing. Cas had got a little covered in sauce causing Dean to fight the urge to wipe it off with his finger or his lips.
A couple years later, when the ski lodge’s finances and reputation tanked due to an unfortunate lawsuit, the Singer family continued to enjoy their yearly holiday at the home sans skiing. After all, the lodge had been in Bobby Singer’s family for generations; they weren’t going to abandon a free place to stay when they needed to get away from their busy lives in Sioux Falls. Their home quickly became the only one on the mountain that remained occupied, the rest of the owners were avid skiers, and moved to a more inhabited area, so the Singer family enjoyed their vacation of solitude.
Charlie, stuck at home while everyone was out looking for Anna, decided to brew a pot of coffee mainly to help her sober up. As she stood in the kitchen with her elbows on the counter and her head in her hands she inhaled the aroma of the fresh coffee, already feeling slightly better, although that was likely a placebo effect for now. Her stomach growled loudly, which made her realize she hadn't eaten anything but snacks since lunch that day and dug around in the fridge for the sandwich ingredients she had brought up for everyone. She moaned happily as she bit into her sandwich and dug her cell out of her pocket, noting it was well after 9 and gazed at the background of a selfie of her and her crush, Dorothy, when they went on a field trip to a local art museum. She smiled at the picture, briefly forgetting about the situation she and her friends were currently in until the front door swung open and footsteps stomped through the house.
“You really think he’d come to the house for a weekend with his favorite brother?” Michael asked, then when Gabriel didn't answer he asked, “You're that desperate huh?”
“Mom's at work, can you make pancakes?” Sam asked his brother, turning around to face the older boys.
“Then buy it from someone else. You could throw a rock on the quad and hit someone who smokes,” Gabe said, throwing his arms in the air for emphasis.
Dean dropped his backpack next to his feet and settled into a desk in his architecture design class. When professor Jody Mills walked in Dean sat up a little straighter, knowing she would tell his father if he’s slacking off in class. She smiled at Dean before saying hello to a couple girls walking in the door. Despite knowing professor Mills for almost his entire life, Dean felt fairly anxious being in her class, knowing he needed to work harder than other students to earn her respect as an academic.
“Duh! Trying to get you two to talk about your feelings or whatever. Don’t say I never did anything for you!”
"Who is she? That RA of yours?" Dean smirked, and Castiel watched Dean sucking mustard off his finger, before he realized that he was unconsciously licking his own lips.
“Alright, let’s light this bitch up,” Dean said, eager to see the flare gun in action.
Castiel’s head perked up, “We win?” He asked excitedly, he had just gotten out of his turn. He silently thanked God because he knew he would probably not be any better than the girl and his friends would have been disappointed.
“Guess we will have to do this without her,” Dean shrugged before Gabe cackled loudly and the two took off. “Man, this is a tradition or something,” he said a few minutes later as he admired his handful of name tags they had ripped from people's doors.
Dean waved and nodded to a few people in the crowd as they squeezed their way to the kitchen where empty cups and cans littered the counter top. He spotted Gabe over in the corner by the keg, already sipping on a cup. He pointed to Castiel where he was and the two made their way over to Gabriel and the beer.
"Come on, Cas," Dean groaned, rubbing his face. Castiel laughed, as did Sam, which received a glare from the oldest Winchester sibling.
Dean sighed as the coffee maker filled and set out a few mugs. “I will, I promise.”
"The ranger tower, right!" Dean said with a hopeful look, turning to Charlie. "Can you get us there?"
“It would probably be in our best interest if he does not know about this,” Castiel said as he zipped up his pants, Dean pulled away so he could grab tissues, passing a couple to Cas.
Dean shook his head and laughed, "Two people called out, I've been stuck on register since I walked in, haven't even gotten the chance to piss."
“I promise, Sam, I will never hurt Dean,” Castiel swore with a small smile.
“You mean The-Freakiest-Girl-You’ve-Ever-Met Rhonda?” Gabriel asked with a grin on his face.
“She’s not s’actly my type.”
“I see. I’m glad you and Ash had a good time,” Cas smiled.
After a over an hour of chatting, drinking and smoking outside, Cas said he needed to use the bathroom, and because it was getting chilly; not because Dean wanted to keep an eye on Cas, Dean followed him inside.
“Hello, Dean,” he greeted.
Dean stared at him "It's not what I want you to say. It's what I want to," he said with his voice lowered. He stood up and climbed onto the couch, taking Cas' hand. "Because I want you to know I feel the same."
When the tournament started they were off to a decent start, Gabriel, Dean, and Jo all managed to flip their cup on the first try. Apparently the trio practiced frequently after they lost in the first round of the tournament last year; one of the frat brothers Castiel didn’t recognized was heckling their team about their shameful previous loss. But when they got to Benny the team started slipping, Benny had apparently had too much whiskey. Luckily for them (or for Castiel) one of the girls on their competitor team was also struggling, and was much more flustered about it than Benny was. Her teammates were shouting as her cup continued to land on it’s side, and she groaned loudly with frustration, her arm accidentally knocking her teammate’s cup off the table when she reached for her own.
“Don’t mind if I do,” Dean said, grabbing two blueberry muffins.
“Because I wanted to. Have for a long time,” Dean said honestly.
“I know what’s going on with you and Cas,” she glanced towards the house, “and I want you to know that I love you very much. I’m happy for you, for both of you-”
Dean paused for a moment before shutting the door quietly. Castiel shrugged off his backpack, placing it on Dean’s desk, then he unzipped it and pulled out his notebook, waving it in the air.
“You and Cas need to have a real talk when we get out of here and you really need to tell him how you feel.”
Dean could barely groan before he was interrupted, “Don’t start that macho I don’t have feelings shit,” she said with a deep voice, impersonating her friend.
“I’m nervous!” Dean defended, cracking open the can and taking a long sip.
“I know, mom. No one drives,” Dean said, rolling his eyes, he knew his parents rules by now.
Dean nodded, “I’m trying.”
Just after he ate lunch, Castiel decided the time was late enough that he could call Dean. Unfortunately, he had waited too long and Sam informed him Dean was at work until ten. Castiel told Sam to have Dean call him back, and that Zachariah was gone so he needn't be worried.
"I have to make an appointment with my adviser to choose Spring classes by Friday?" Castiel asked, wide eyed after Gabriel asked him if he had done so already.
“Good going, Dean,” Sam said with an attitude, continuing on the path that he knew well.
"You don't have to," Charlie added quickly. "It's just a nice place to go and feel like you belong, ya know."
Dean chuckled quietly, "No, it's for special occasions."
“We aren’t discussing this!” Gabriel exclaimed. “You don’t like my offer, don’t take it,” he snapped, still staring at Dean with a glare.
“He’s here,” Sam said but was interrupted by Dean who appeared in the doorway from the kitchen and greeted his dad.
“Come on!” Dean exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air, incredibly annoyed that Sam bothered him until he got out of bed, then just took off. He turned around and Cas was running a hand through his messy hair.
Dean laughed with a mouthful, "That blows."
Chuck banged loudly on Gabriel and Dean's door with his backpack slung over his shoulders. Gabe answered the door with a grin on his face and a, "Heya."
Castiel frowned after a moment of silence and said sadly, "I'll miss you."
Castiel only laughed in response, the alcohol flowing through his body made him feel light, eager- made him feel social.
"Yeah, Dean," Ruby added.
Castiel unscrewed the cap and took a small sip before passing it back to Dean. As Dean went to reach for it he immediately drew his arm back when two guys in banana costumes passed between them. When the bananas disappeared Castiel closed the space between them out of fear of pushed apart again and being left alone in the crowd. Castiel stood only inches away from Dean, his eyes level with Dean's lips. The bottle was still held in his hands, wedged in between their stomachs. He was unable to pull his eyes away from Dean's lips, pink and plump with a light sheen of rum. It was the first time all night Castiel looked somewhere other than Dean’s bare chest, barely covered thanks to a small piece of plastic acting as armor. Dean's green eyes lowered to Castiel's, when he noticed the younger boy was starting at his lips he poked out his tongue ever so slightly. Partly to dampen the chapped skin but mostly to taunt Cas; he didn’t plan to do it- the tequila and rum were running the show now. He watched Castiel's eyes widen and then flicker up to catch Dean's eyes.
“Please do not use our Lord’s name in vain,” Castiel approached the cassette player and turned it off. "What's your problem, Dean?"
“Can I come?” Jo asked. “I’m sick of going to the same party every weekend.”
Castiel moaned into the kiss and threaded his hands through Dean’s short hair, tightening his grip and pulling ever so slightly, drawing a growl-like sound from Dean. Dean’s hands made their way to Castiel’s ass, gripping it forcefully. “Dean,” Castiel gasped for air when Dean bit on his lower lip sharply, grinding his hips forward to make more contact.
“You fuck me? Good idea,” Cas gripped Dean’s erection and began stroking him.
"Yes," he slurred.
Castiel and Dean tended to spend more time in Dean and Gabriel’s room than Castiel’s. Both Castiel’s roommate and Gabriel were around equally, but Gabriel already knew Dean and Cas were a thing. Not that Castiel’s roommate seemed homophobic, he just felt more comfortable being with Gabriel who he already knew well and they wouldn't have to worry about judgement.
Dean took a bite of his meatloaf with satisfaction and smirked, already planning who he was inviting to this party.
“Bye kids! Have fun! Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!” Gabriel called from behind the closed door.
Gabe tossed Dean another drink and used his dorm key to punch a hole near the bottom of the can. Dean did the same with his pocket knife.
"Josh, that kid I threatened when he was giving Sammy a hard time. Or those jock douche bags," Dean said.
“Yeah, it’s this way,” Dean said, pointing to the right, and Ruby stomped forward, eager to get their terrible idea they called a plan finished so they could get back to the warm fireplace.
"You have that look."
“What?” The woman asked, she had a British accent.
“So what did you two idiots do to dad’s car?” Sam asked when they reached the bus stop.
“What are we going to do at the lake?” Dean asked, disinterested.
gesture and Dean screwed the lid back on and placed the bottle on the floor beside him.
"Miami was a blast, wasn't it, Cas," Dean smiled through a mouthful of pasta.
"I see," Castiel said, nodding.
“I dunno,” Dean shrugged, “I think anyone can live there but it’ll probably fill up before freshmen can get to it. Unless you know someone,” he winked.
“Sam do you have any plans for Christmas break?” Cas asked, pouring maple syrup on to his pancakes.
“Yeah, I don’t get it, they’re not that hard.”
Dean gave a thumbs up in response, Cas also doing the same. Gabriel disappeared back into the crowd again and when Dean thought they were out of his line of sight, he might have inched closer to Castiel once again.
Sam’s head whipped up to see the Impala, his face pinched, then the blonde girl waved goodbye to him before she turned towards a bike rack. Sam stalked over to the car and got into the passenger seat with a scowl on his face, "We were kind of talking," he said with typical teenager attitude.
“No it is. She was sleeping with one of my best friends for the entirety of our relationship.”
“You were nervous,” Castiel said, turning to Dean who was a light shade of pink, “And you still are. But I find it endearing. It means you care,” he smiled sweetly at Dean who just smiled back and tried to cover his blush with a cough before he tired to make room in the isle for the exiting tour group. “We haven’t really discussed, uh, us,” Castiel said when the group left and they were the only ones in the room about ancient cultures.
Castiel laughed as Gabriel’s expression hardened and he continued to glare at not just his roommate, but also at the youngest Winchester. “I thought he was supposed to be the nice one,” Gabe said.
“You will have to teach me how to play.”
“You’re going to have to check bags for alcohol and shit," Dean shrugged.
“Count me in!” Gabriel exclaimed, standing up and wiping sand off his shorts.
“What happened between you and Zach?” Dean asked as they each laid on their separate beds.
Gabriel was immediately nowhere to be found in the sea of people (as usual), most likely already chasing after whichever girl was in the skimpiest costume. Jo took a long sip from the flask stashed in the elastic band around her thigh, meant for holding a fake gun to go with her cop outfit. Charlie leaned in close to Jo to say something in her ear, Dean picked up on the words 'plan’ and 'alone’ and was going to ask what their plan was but before he could the cop and Charlie; in a star trek dress; sneaked off into the crowd.
"No, it's right here," Cas extended his left arm and almost spilled the drink on the older boy.
Dean was able to catch his breath and said, “There was this,” he paused and took a deep breath, rubbing his hands together to generate warmth, “thing that grabbed him and took him into the woods.”
"It's," he paused, "not great. But the support of a group backed by a couple teachers helps."
“Pancakes good with you, Cas?” Dean said as he opened the fridge to look for eggs.
“I’ll sleep in Gabe’s bed, you can have mine,” Dean said, unhappy with the situation but wanting to make things as comfortable for Sammy as possible. If Gabe hadn’t offered the extra bed Dean was going to take the floor, but he was going to keep that to himself and accept Gabriel’s kind gesture- he knew it could be a while until there was another one.
"Anna wanted an adventure," Gabe shrugged, knowing Anna was always dying to get away from their hometown, Zachariah in particular. "Always looking for a new adventure," Gabe smiled.
When the sun happened to shine right in Dean’s face and wake him, his roommate snoring away soundly across the room. Dean couldn’t fall back to sleep, thinking about Castiel had him tossing and turning into the late hours of the morning until Gabe yawned loudly and snapped Dean out of his thoughts.
“This is the price we agreed on,” he states as he scratches out the check. He rips it from the book and holds it out to Ava. “I assume you have some paperwork for me to sign.”
Dean's eyes narrow. "What's that supposed to mean?" Cas shoots him another laser look and doesn't answer, which Dean's pretty sure is passive-aggressive angel for
That night the house creaks and moans a little more than usual. Probably because it’s windy out. A spring storm could be moving in, which reminds him that he should really read up on tornado season now that he lives in Kansas.
Castiel had taken it from the cabinet to examine again one afternoon just as his phone began to bleat from somewhere in the kitchen. He plucked the phone out from the pile of clean dishes on the kitchen counter (not at all convinced that’s where he’d left it, but oh well), took the call, and forgot all about putting the soldier back in the hutch.
She remained next to Cas after she handed him her drink and said, “Ashley.”
Castiel grabbed Dean by the back of his head and slammed his lips against Dean’s, bitter and stinging with chlorine. Dean eagerly pressed his lips against the shorter mans with an urgency that he hadn’t felt since him and Castiel first started sneaking around, the possibility of getting caught excited Dean more than he cared to admit. Dean’s hands wandered south and found themselves wrapped around the back of Cas’ thighs, easily lifting him in the water. Hands running through Deans wet hair began scraping at his scalp, causing an involuntary moan to escape his lips.
At first it started for fun, smoking a joint for the first time with Ruby and Bal; then when his grades started slipping from the stress of college applications and advanced placement classes, Crowley told him he had pills that would help him focus better at school. Castiel just couldn’t resist. He couldn’t afford to. But Ruby took it further than Cas could have imagined,
“You want a hit?” Castiel asked Dean, holding it out to him and licked his lips. Dean stared at his tongue drag across his plump lower lip, and how wet with saliva it was. He couldn’t help but also lick his before downing the rest of his beer and shook his head no. Castiel shrugged and brought the joint back to his lips, Deans eyes remaining on the other mans lips. Thankfully Dean was distracted from staring at Castiel’s lips when Jo shouted, “Hey!” She stumbled over the small step down from the doorway to the porch, “There you guys are, I’ve been looking for you.”
