For all that he tried to look suave and cool Balthazar puffed up like an excited cat at Gabriel’s acquiescence. “You won’t regret this!” He gushed, looking positively delighted that his cousin had finally come ‘round. Then, before Gabriel had a chance to overthink things again, Balthazar reached out and grabbed him by the wrist. “No time like the present!” The British man declared as he practically dragged Gabriel down the alley behind him. “You’re going to love it, just you wait!”
Warning: Panic attack
Wait--what? Dean blinks, shocked. A cold chill runs down his spine to pool uncomfortably in his stomach as he parses the alpha’s words. He can’t believe it--did Castiel actually apologize? To him? The idea is inconceivable after everything. He steps back, horror sweeping across his face as he shakes his head. No. No. This can’t be happening! Castiel can’t just apologize like everything is going to be fine and forgiven! It just doesn’t
Dean thinks, panting for air that feels too thin as it scrapes into his lungs. He’s sprawled out the best he can on the cool tile of the bathroom floor, face down, but he’s as far from comfortable as he can get. His skin pricks with the barest touch; even the gentle current of air as it circulates is too much to bare. He’s sweating and shivering and god, how can this be happening now? He’s not quite far enough gone to not know what this is--it’s a heat, has to be--but why now? Dean doesn’t know for sure since it isn’t like there’s calendars laying around but he thinks he still had a month or so to go until his next one.
“Dean…” Sam started hesitantly, just as aware of all the other angels watching like Dean was. “Did you forget what happened in Hell? You saved the human! The chosen one! Garth’s right man, you’re a hero!”
Eyes fully back on the road, Castiel smirked. He may have cheated a bit since he’d asked Sam’s opinion earlier on what an appropriate date would be to have with Dean. He was glad to see the younger Winchester had given him sound advice regarding his brother’s love of food. Castiel had been skeptical at best since most omegas didn’t like to eat as much as Sam had assured him Dean did. “Shall we then?” He asked, wanting to be absolutely sure before they went through the hassle of getting into the building. Privately, he was pleased that Dean was on-board with his club idea even if it had taken some creative bribing to get him there. He wouldn’t have said anything if Dean had been fully against it, of course, but Castiel preferred when things went according to his plans.
“My name is Samael.” The taller angel proclaimed in a resigned voice as he stepped inside, not that the reminder would do any good--Gabriel seemed to come up with a new name for him every single time they’d met. Garth, by contrast, just grinned as he followed Sam inside before bee-lining to the table where Dean and Castiel were. Gabriel watched the angel go with a chuckle and a shake of his head before turning to close the door.
“Don’t just stand here! Get in here, boy!” John’s thunderous voice boomed again, startling the younger angel out of his revelry. His tawny wings folded tightly against his back, a sure sign of submission, as he hastened to comply. To his surprise there was more than John in the room when he was in it far enough to properly see: there was also Bobby, an angel rumored to be older than John and possibly even an Eldest; and Mary, who was rumored to have been involved with John at some point before she came to her senses and was a fierce garrison commander in her own right.
It's not an animal. That's the first thing that flashes through Sam’s mind as he stands there, paralyzed in shock at what he's seeing. He doesn't know what he's seeing. Hell, he can't
“Oh good! You’re awake!” Meg brightens when she notices him watching her and she can’t help but outright grin at the hungry way he’s looking at the soup she’s holding. “I brought you something.” More like she snuck him something; Castiel will be less than pleased if he finds out. “They called Castiel into work today so it’s just me and you and I thought you could use it.” She told Dean as she carefully lowered herself to crouch beside the bed.
Dean blinked, drawn out of his stupor. He looked up, meeting Garth's eyes in the rearview and shook his head. "Just take me home please." He requested quietly. The thought of going anywhere else sounded like torture. It was bad enough that Hannah had kept insisting on calling an ambulance, or at the very least ensuring that Dean went to the hospital. They meant well, Dean knew, but going to the hospital was the absolute last thing he wanted to do. What good would come of it anyway? There wasn't anything the hospital could do except offer some overpriced generic painkillers before sending him on his way. For less than half the price Dean could grab a six pack and some Tylenol and wallow away in the privacy of his own home.
“You’re a pain in the ass.” She tells Dean, though there’s no real heat behind it. He doesn’t respond which she expected at this point, so she ignores him and rolls her eyes to the ceiling. There’s more cameras here than in the bathroom so she knows Castiel has a perfect view of her.  Glaring at the nearest one she flips it off with both hands. “Fuck you!” She mouths for good measure before she finally pushes off from the door frame.
“I thought he was but I think he’s drifting in and out.” Hannah confirms, craning their neck to peer over the bed to where Meg’s bent on the other side. “He seems to like being touched. I don’t think he realizes what’s going on.”
Dean blinks after her, flummoxed. Meg was an enigma that Dean found he couldn’t quite wrap his head around. She helped him despite being married to Cas… it made no sense to Dean but who was he to complain? He shook his head, determined to ignore the spiraling thoughts for now, and after a quick glance to make sure Meg wasn’t watching he shuffled over to the toilet. Whatever game Meg was playing, if she was playing one, could wait. For now Dean was determined to take whatever measure of comfort he was given.
He stepped back to allow the nurses room to get out…and felt the blood drain from his face as he caught sight of what they were carrying. Each of them had a large bundle of bedclothes that positively
thinking about hooking up with his little brother’s ex, he leaned forward towards the guy. “Oh yeah?” He narrowed his eyes as he gave the guy a blatant once-over. “I don’t recall seeing you before. What’s your name?”
A sudden knock at the motel room door broke through the companionable silence causing all three of them to look up. Gabriel raised his eyebrows at Castiel as he put his half-eaten burger down and rose. “Are you expecting company?” He asked, reaching for the silver knife in his belt at his brother’s shake of the head. Inwardly his nerves were aflutter, wondering who could possibly be on the other side of the door. Balthazar had still been in London the last they had spoken which left... any number of unsavory creatures out for revenge.
Still, it wasn’t a fast approach. How could it be when Dean still wasn’t sure what he’d done to warrant such a call? You didn’t get summoned to the throne room for nothing; either you’d done something to warrant it, and that was bad enough, or something serious was about to go down. Dean wasn’t sure which scenario bothered him the most, though he was fairly sure the night he’d snuck out and spent watching the humans hadn’t been enough to get him summoned here. They were supposed to be the human’s protectors, weren’t they? Well you couldn’t do a job like that without checking on your charges every once in a while, right? As far as excuses went it was weak but considering he was seconds away from touching the door standing between him and the throne Dean would take it. At this point, why not? Excuse made, and stealing whatever reserves he had, Dean reached out and carefully knocked on the door.
Chuck had perished alongside most of his family nearly twenty years ago--something Gabriel still had nightmares about--so this was impossible! For his part Gabriel simply started, mouth agape and speechless. He'd dreamed of seeing his father again but this exact scenario had never even crossed his mind. How was this even happening?!
“Okay--I’ll be right back!” Castiel said with a grin, and pulled away. It didn’t take long for him to be swallowed up in the crowd as he headed towards the bar. Dean watched him go for as long as he could, and once he was out of sight he dropped his head down into his hands. “Oh god, you gotta get it together Winchester!” He groaned out loud to himself. “Everything is going well. It’s all going to be okay!” At least he hoped it would be. Hopefully some liquid courage would help things go smoother. Dean didn’t know about Castiel but he was vested in the night going well...
From his spot leaning up against the brick wall of the alleyway Gabriel shrugged. The rough brick scratched at his leather jacket, something that normally he’d get pissed over but tonight he didn’t care. “I did.” He said, looking away. “I do.” Why was it so difficult to put what he was feeling into words? He huffed out a laugh and shifted again, this time bringing his arms up to cross over his chest. It was a cool night, unseasonably so for it not being early summer, and Gabriel felt himself shudder a little. It was just the cold, he told himself, and not the brightly lit red neon sign two doors down that read ‘THE INFERNO’ that was tossing him off his game. No, it was definitely the cold. “Are you sure about this?” He’d already asked Balthazar the same question twice now but he couldn’t help it.
“I know,” Meg keeps stroking, smoothing the sweaty strands back against his head. “I’m sorry. I’d give you something if I could.” She sounds remorseful though Dean hates her just a little bit anyway. It isn’t her fault, he knows, (it’s Castiel’s) but he can’t help how he feels. Meg’s a beta and they aren’t designed to have heats like omegas do. It was a fact of life that Dean had always known but it had never bothered him until now, when he was faced with it.
Dean stared, brain flat-lined in complete and utter shock; there was no way he heard that right. They wanted him to lay siege to
He was getting nowhere and finally he simply chose. Cleaning up the mess from the night before seemed to be the best course of action if only because Dean couldn’t imagine Cas being pleased if it wasn’t. Decision made, he didn’t give himself time to think about it. As quietly as he could he slipped from the bathroom into the bedroom. Eyes locked on the still-sleeping alpha he edged his way towards the door, not bothering to grab clothes as he went. What was the point when he would just be getting them dirty? And besides it was his own damn house so if he wanted to walk around naked he could. With one last glance at Castiel he slipped through the door and out into the hallway.
Ah-ha! There! Two houses down from where he’s standing there’s yet another privacy fence, though unlike the others it’s not been painted and is quite worn. Sam had given the place a berth when he went running past the first time, a general sense of unease guiding him, but now he found himself edging closer. Aside from the complete lack of a paint job to Sam’s amazement there’s also something that doesn’t fit in laying right in front a section of the fence: a bright blue tarp puffed up into a suspicious sized lump.
“Just watch.” Castiel told him without looking back. He wound his way through the crowd like an expert and didn’t seem to see, or possibly care about the looks he and Dean were getting from the people in line. He kept going until he reached the doors where a tall well-built man was standing in front of the doors. “Hello Gadreel.” He greeted the man even as he reached back to grab ahold of Dean. “I brought a friend with me tonight.”
Compared to the eternity it took to get to the crossroads the way back was accomplished in no time at all. Before Castiel was prepared for it he found himself pulling back into the familiar parking lot at the hotel. There he simply turned off the car and stared at his and Gabriel’s hotel door without truly seeing it. What if he’d somehow failed and Gabriel was still dead? Part of him was demanding to go see immediately but the bigger part of him hesitated. The only thing worse than selling his soul would be finding out it was all for naught; Castiel didn’t think he could bear it. If it turned out to be true he wouldn’t have to wait to find out first hand what Hell was like--he’d eat a bullet right there and get it over with. The demon he’d made acquaintances with would be thrilled, he thought idly as he continued staring into space.
side after all--the look on his face made Gabriel pause. “What’s up?” He asked lightly, though there was a part of him that was already dreading the answer. He should have known better than to think the angels were there for a social call--they didn’t have the attachment Dean did to the hunters.
Gabriel only hoped the angel was right about that. Until then where was the harm in trusting him? It wasn’t like either Gabriel or Castiel had any solid ideas on taking on Asmodeus and who knew? Maybe having an angel along for the ride would help things run smoother. Finally looking up he shot the angel a weak smile before gesturing to the diner at large. “What do you say we blow this Popsicle stand? If I gotta tell this thing I only wanna do it once and I know Cassie’s going to want to hear it.” Plus there was beer stashed in the trunk of the car and Gabriel suddenly, desperately needed a drink. Or maybe six. Or hell, probably a whole twelve pack!
He wastes no time in crossing towards the Omega marked door. Thankfully it’s unlocked, and he’s already unzipping and pulling himself out as he goes, beelining straight for the row of urinals along the wall. The relief is ecstasy and he can’t help closing his eyes as a groan bubbles up from his throat.
His screams follow him into the dark.
Castiel watched him, an amused glint in his eyes. “You’re adorable, did you know that?” He gushed like Dean was a cute pup rather than a very terrified man. “Hmm?” The alpha moved closer, his steps sure and measured like a predator stalking its prey. He didn’t stop until he was mere inches away from Dean’s face. Castiel leaned in, his nostrils flaring as he took a deep scenting breath. “Mmmm… you smell divine!”
Dean shot a glower at Gabriel--and boy, he’d really been spending too much time with Castiel!--as he pulled out one of the chairs alongside Castiel and sat down. While he didn’t need to eat to sustain his vessel he’d taken to sitting with the hunters during meals nonetheless. “I should be able to stay a few days.” He said as he reached out to steal one of Castiel’s fries to examine. “Things are quiet back home.”
It took the better part of three hours for them to get Dean ready and out the door but Meg was relieved when he was. She leaned down, eyeing him worriedly where he was curled up into a ball on the backseat of Hannah’s car. In the dim light he looked so frail and weak bundled up in a pair of Castiel’s pajama pants and ratty old pullover hoodie. It’d been the best Meg had that wouldn’t immediately trigger Castiel’s suspicions. She just hoped it would be enough. “Drive safe.” She told Hannah as she straightened up. “Give me a call in a few days. Let me know if the package gets delivered to the right address?”
...Then he remembered waking up in that hotel room with no memory of how he’d gotten there. Remembered the way Bathazar’s face had crumpled as he cried in a way Gabriel had never seen from his stoic cousin before. And then there was Castiel, returning to the hotel after he’d gone and done the stupid thing by selling his soul to save a worthless piece of shit like Gabriel. Fury raced up his spine, revitalizing him. How could he have been so stupid? Gabriel had always known he was a piece of shit, but to have it constantly rubbed in his face for a year as Castiel’s time ticked down? And been unable to do a damn thing about it? It’d been beyond infuriating and he clung to the feeling now, letting it chase away the cold chill. “You stupid son of a bitch!” He choked out, knowing his brother couldn’t hear him. A few more choked breathes followed but by then Gabriel was unsurprised to realize he was crying.
If Dean had been standing he was sure his jaw would have hit the floor. Was this woman for real? She not only didn’t care that her husband was screwing around on her, but the person he was screwing was his new kidnapping victim? That was the most fucked up thing Dean had ever heard! “You’ve gotta be kidding me.” He finally said at last because, seriously? Who wouldn’t be bothered by that? Dean was bothered by it and he was the so-called ‘other woman’!
He growled back, unable to reign himself in. “Are you listening to yourself? How am
Gabriel came back to the waking world in fits and starts, not truly conscious of anything beyond the ringing in his ears and the pounding headache blooming from his left temple. For a long time he simply languished there, unable to muster up the energy to push past the pain to see the outside world. What had happened? His memory seemed as foggy as his head and the memories lingered just on the edge of his awareness.
The words are like a blow to Dean’s already bruised and battered body. He whimpers in response, far past being able to communicate with actual words. He hasn’t stopped humping the floor, can’t stop. All he wants, one way or the other, is relief. Given the circumstances he wouldn’t care if Meg had decided to take a page from Castiel’s book and beat him unconscious. It wouldn’t have helped with the heat any but at least Dean wouldn’t have been awake and continuously stuck in this hell like he is now.
Hell was exactly like Dean’s worst nightmares and in the moment he didn’t know if he found the knowledge more horrifying or hilarious. Unlike the bright purifying light of Heaven, Hell was a dank, dark pit filled with fire and brimstone and clouded over with thick black smoke. All that was imposing enough, but what was worse was the screaming. The ghastly sound rang up from the depths and echoed off every available surface. It was beyond horrible and Dean could feel his seconds, Sam and Garth, trembling behind him. Dean didn’t blame them; if there had been any way to get out of this while saving face he would have already turned and fled for it. How were they supposed to lay siege to this? Much less do it successfully enough to rescue one damned soul?
Plus, something still needed to be done about Castiel. The alpha had finally given up calling--something Dean suspected he could thank on his full voicemail--yet Dean wasn't ready to face him. He didn't know how that would work out once they both returned to the set on Monday morning but Dean was willing to shelve thinking about that until Sunday night at the earliest. Realistically Dean knew he couldn't hide in his house and ignore this forever but he was sure as hell willing to give it a try! At the absolute very least he was giving himself the weekend to lick his wounds in private.
“A good friend recommended it.” Castiel replied distractedly as he led them past the line of people waiting to get in. “She used to work here back then.” He sounded fond, his voice wistful. “You would have liked her, she was quite the spitfire back in those days!”
The brothers blinked, both startled out of their own private thoughts. A quick glance revealed Balthazar was right; there were at least half a dozen eyes peering at them from behind the curtains of the surrounding rooms and Castiel couldn’t help let out a sigh. This certainly wasn’t what he had expected to come back to but he couldn’t complain. Gabriel was alive, and while he wasn’t alright now, he would be eventually. It was enough; it had to be. Squirming free of his brother’s hold, Castiel finally shoved his way out of the car. He stalked to the hotel door without looking back; he didn’t need to, he knew Gabriel would follow.
? Continue hunting? Castiel was good enough to make it on his own but that didn’t mean he wanted to. The thought of continuing on by himself until he was finally taken out by some random monster made his chest tighten. The truth was simple: while he could hunt alone
The words hit Dean like a punch to the solar plexus and he crumbles under the sheer weight of them. Attacked? Found unconscious? The air suddenly feels like it’s being sucked out of the room through a straw. Dean can’t breathe. He gasps, heart began to pound in his chest even as his lungs strain but nothing happens. No air is coming in and he can feel himself panicking but Dean can’t make himself stop. He can’t
, had ever singled Dean out like this before. He was a foot soldier, good at following orders, nothing more.
He watched the hunter settle down on the edge of the unoccupied bed and he took that as a cue to stand. “Our conversation can wait a few hours until morning.” Dean said, eyeing the way the hunter looked ready to fall over at the merest push. Before the hunter could open his mouth to agree, or more likely argue, Dean crossed the room to stand beside him. He reached out pressing two fingers gently to the middle of Gabriel’s forehead. The human’s eyes fluttered and closed as he slipped away into sleep. Dean smiled to himself, satisfied, as he carefully positioned Gabriel back on the bed. It was highly likely the man would be pissed in the morning but Dean had no regrets--things would look better once he’d gotten some sleep behind him. Until then he settled back into the chair alongside the table to wait for the hunters to wake.
Leaving the town behind Dean found himself wandering alongside a back street lined with houses every few feet. It was quiet and quaint and felt like a balm to his frayed nerves. He wandered from there onto another nearly identical only to stop dead at the edge of someone’s yard. There, laying half forgotten in a tangle of bushes was the most beautiful thing Dean could ask for: a giant bright blue tarp. It was the closest thing to a blanket that the wild could offer and Dean wanted it. Taking the chance, he looked to see if there was anyone watching before he slipped into the yard. Staying hunched and ready to run at a moment’s notice, Dean carefully picked his way over to the tarp. It was tangled up good, which was probably why it’d just been left, but Dean hardly cared. It wasn’t easy moving with one arm but he carefully worked the tarp free.
“No problem, friend-o!” Garth reassured, pleased. Maybe he wasn’t doing as bad as he thought he was.
Finally one figure slowly gets to his feet.
“Probably about the time you met me, boy!” A familiar, heavily Southern accented voice growled from the backseat seconds before a cold clammy hand latched onto Gabriel’s right ankle and began to pull. . .
He was silently condemning himself when Bobby spoke up again, his voice quieter but just as commanding as John’s: “Look at me son,” the older angel urged, and waited until Dean reluctantly did so. “I don’t care if you ask questions.” Bobby said, ignoring the noise of protest arising from behind him. “You’re here because there’s a special job that needs doing and you’re just the angel for it.”
While the sun was shining high in the sky and the day was quite warm Castiel felt nothing but cold as he stared up at the neon INFERNO sign. Due to the time of day it was off as the club was closed yet the knowledge didn’t make him feel any better about this whole thing. He’d been all for taking down Asmodeus and the club but now that they were there staring it down the doubts were starting to resurface. Suddenly their half baked plan to go storming the place seemed like a very bad idea indeed. He knew they had no choice given they were possibly outnumbered and outgunned but Castiel didn’t feel good about any of this. He did his best to make his face into something resembling neutral as he looked back at Gabriel and Dean. “What do you think?” He asked, reluctantly taking point because someone had to and Gabriel looked about three seconds away from bolting.
A rumble bubbled up from his chest, a sure sign of how pleased he was. “You know,” he said conversationally as he leaned in closer to Dean’s neck and the source of the intoxicating smell. He stopped just short of being in licking distance, a feat that wasn’t easy, and looked up to capture Dean’s terrified green gaze with his own. “You can run and hide all you want but you’ll never be free of me. One way or the other I will find you and I will have you. No. Matter. What.” Regretfully he pulled back though he brought a hand up to cup Dean’s cheek gently. “I’ll see you soon my sweet omega.” He told him before he turned, and as quietly as he’d came, he left.
Balthazar rolled his eyes at the question as he moved closer to his cousin. While he didn’t lean up against the wall--there was no way he was wrinkling his suit thank you very much--he did lean in far enough to capture his attention. “Many, many times!” He declared, his smirk nearly as bright as the club’s neon sign. “It’s quite the experience, I assure you!” That was something he’d said in response to Gabriel’s questions, every single time. “You’ll love it if you just give it a chance!”
“Probably more than I should!” Castiel admitted with a grin. “It’s quite popular; I’m rather surprised that you’ve never been there!” He glanced away from the road over at Dean considering. “The beer glazed meatballs are phenomenal. They’re the best in the state from what I’ve heard.”
He thought, numb, as he scoured through his fridge for something to drink. Truthfully Dean didn’t remember a whole lot about what had actually happened beyond the obvious. He had told as much to Hannah back at the club though he suspected they didn’t believe him.
Despite himself he flushed, caught between annoyed and mortified that she’d seen him kneeling in the dirt for so long. What would she have done if a demon had shown up after all? “What are you doing here?” It seemed like a safe question to ask, all things considered.
Dean staggered back at the force of Sam’s outburst, tearing his eyes away from Castiel. “I remember.” He replied quietly, hurt by the accusation that he’d somehow forgotten everything Castiel put him through after still recovering from it for the past few months. “I’m not asking you to care.” He finally says at length, unable to look at Sam in the eyes. “I’m just saying we should be better than he is.”
While the omega weights far less than Meg would have guessed he’s nothing more than dead weight. She struggles under his bulk and knows she’ll be feeling the burn in her back for a couple of days afterwards as she hauls him across the room. Thankfully it’s a short few steps to the tub and though she tries to be gentle about it Meg ends up dropping Dean mostly into the cold water. “Shit!” She yelps, struggling to right him before he ends up drowning in the few inches of water that’s accumulated.
If he had been scared before it was nothing compared to now. He stood stock-still, barely breathing.
“Sure brother, whatever you say,” Benny says but his subtle calming scent is shot through with gratitude, and there’s no hiding the grin splitting his face underneath his beard. “Are you ready to go then?”
Case in point: Benny had just pulled up, and while Dean hadn’t moved an inch from where he’d stationed himself on his front steps with his head in his hands, he could tell the beta was smiling. It was just the way the man was; even Dean’s grumpy ass wasn’t going to change it.
Dean, for his part, simply blinked. He was stunned. One moment he was staring death in the face and the next he was watching his brother and Castiel wrestle around like a couple of teenagers in a fistfight. It took several crucial seconds for his brain to get back online but once it did he didn’t waste time. Uttering a cure under his breath he jumped into the fray!
He wasn’t going to let it! Gabriel, the brother who’d been there since before Castiel could talk, who’d been there through thick & thin, couldn’t be dead. He simply
“If you’re sure about it chief,” Benny simply sounded resigned; this was a conversation they’d had more than once in the past and he’d never managed to win one yet. Feeling awkward hovering there he turned and sunk down on the steps beside Dean. He knew they were getting off schedule, but if Dean didn’t care then just this once Benny found he didn’t care either.
In true Balthazar fashion he’d declared a night at a sex club was what they all needed.
enough he won’t be as appealing? It's a ridiculous notion, especially considering last time but Dean’s terrified into parallelization; all he’s got is ridiculous. What else can he do? There’s nothing and the lack of hope weighs heavily on his chest. The bed dips behind him and all at once Dean stiffens.
“You won’t mess anything up darling!” Balthazar laughed, the sound echoing in their narrow alleyway. “Really, this fretting isn’t like you! We both know you aren’t a virgin so what’s the problem, hmm?” The taller man leaned sideways, trying to meet Gabriel’s eyes again. “I’ve never seen you like this.” He noted, “I assure you nothing bad is going to happen. You’re going to have a delightful time; I can guarantee it!”
He thought, watching wide-eyed as Castiel scented him. Considering how utterly terrified Dean was in the moment there was no way in hell he smelled of anything other than the rancid scent of fear.
in every respect of the word. From this close the smell hits Sam with all the finesse of a freight train: sweat and dirt, vomit and piss, and something far more sinister that speaks of festering wounds waft up from Dean in a terrible bouquet. It’s beyond terrible and Sam suddenly realizes how out of his depth he is here. He may have portrayed a medical personal on screen during that one confusing episode, but he has no medical training at all to fall back on.
"Chicken noodle." Meg confirms with shining, hopeful eyes. "It isn't much, just from a can, but hey, at least it's warm!" She tries to sound cheerful about it though the effect goes completely over Dean's head. Try as he might he can't wrap his head around what's happening here. It's been . . . well he doesn't know how long it's actually been but why now? After everything he's been put through thus far, why now? As much as he wants the soup, and make no doubt he does, Dean doesn't think he can trust it.
The third remains on the ground in a rapidly growing pool of blood.
“I know you’re awake.” The voice continued on like Dean’s world hadn’t just come to a screeching halt because, what the fuck? His eyes flew open and to Dean’s utter shock there was a woman crouched beside the bed. Wait, when had he gotten into the bed? And under the covers no less? The confusion must have shown on his face because the woman tilted her head back and laughed. The woman was pretty, Dean noted distantly. She had dark wavy hair and pale skin and was wearing an oversized pink v-neck shirt that hung off one shoulder and a pair of black leggings. She sobered up quickly and fixed him with a serious gaze. “I’m Meg.” She said, rocking back on her heels. “I’d offer to shake your hand but that wouldn’t work to great, would it?”
Sam had to bite down on his cheek to keep the grin that wanted to grow from spreading. Alfie’s concern over Dean was frankly, adorable. It was a shame that Aflie didn’t just go for it with Dean, Sam thought; they’d certainly make a cute couple. “I’m sure he’s probably holed up in bed resting.” Sam was sure he was--he had caught Dean nesting enough times to know it was a habit he’d gotten into when he didn’t feel well. Unlike their asshole of a father, Sam was fully supportive of Dean doing more omega things, especially whatever brought him some comfort. “I’ll tell him about the coffee,” he promised to Alfie as he stuffed his change back into a pocket. “I’m sure he’ll be glad to know you aren’t angry with him.”
Castiel, unfortunately, hadn’t shared in Dean’s opinion. Whereas Dean had went the extra mile in dressing in some of his fancier clothes the alpha had showed up in a pair of ripped jeans and a ratty Metallica shirt that had seen better decades. Things had quickly spiraled down from there as the man had wasted no time in deriding everything from Dean’s clothes down to the silverware. Even the food hadn’t been good enough--even now Dean cringed at the memory of seeing Castiel throw his bowl of ravioli across the dining room. “This tastes like dog food!” The alpha had ranted, his chest heaving as he rounded on Dean. “You’re trying to poison me!”
He didn’t even register getting back into the car, or even driving. It was just like between one blink and the next the world had shifted around him and instead of a brick alleyway Castiel found himself at a dirt crossroads. Night had fallen somewhere along the way, casting everything in shadows but that was fine by Castiel. There was no need for daylight in what he was about to do.
Dean cringed again, though this time for an entirely different reason. Even still partially blinded by the light he knew that voice--John-- and it wasn’t one to be trifled with. John was one of the older angels and the leader of Dean’s current garrison. He had a reputation for ruling with an iron first and brooking no disobedience from those under his command. Dean hadn’t worked all that closely with him in the past, a good thing indeed since Dean seemed to have a knack for annoying him far more than anyone else. That he was here in the throne room waiting for Dean spelled disaster with a capital ‘D’, and not for the first time Dean found himself wishing he’d flown for it when he had the chance.
Dean thinks, freaked.
Castiel hadn’t been able to contain his excitement long enough to get properly dressed to go in to see Dean. He had planned it already, what he would wear, but in the end the plan went right out the window. Boxers, socks, shoes, shirt, all of it had been left on a heap on his bedroom floor as he barely managed to shimmy his way into a pair of jeans. Castiel had zipped but forwent buttoning; Dean was too enticing to wait for.
Castiel was fucking with him. Dean shuddered under the irony, not at all amused. He had figured at most Castiel was going to rape him again but this? He hadn’t been expecting this? Through the steadily lessening hazy of drugs he could feel how much the bite marks on his ass stung. Just barely shifting made him hiss through his teeth, and for the nth time Dean had to wonder: why me? What made him so special? He didn’t get it, had never seen what was so beautiful about him that everyone kept praising.
The next time Dean wakes it’s to the delicious salty smell of chicken broth wafting under his nose. He blinks open gritty eyes to find Meg standing next to his bed holding, to his complete shock, a large white bowl that actually looked like it contained soup in it. “W-wha?” He slurs, tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth as he stares.
. Sam thinks, frowning, from his position just outside the door to Dean’s hospital room. He’s been holding his lone vigil here and in the waiting room for hours now, yet nobody has really told him a damn thing about what happened to his brother.
“You’re a bastard!” Dean spits, finding more of his words. Why not?
have things to say. Until then he continues the struggle; his hands scrabbling for purchase on the urinal, on the wall, or any fucking thing he can use to push back with but there’s nothing. With the way he’s awkwardly bent and Castiel’s weight an unmovable force behind him there’s simply nowhere to go until the alpha decides to release him. It takes surprisingly less time than Dean thinks it should to realize he should give up.
Warning: Panic attack and violence
Sam was still shaking his head, partially amused at himself, when he turned on yet another back street. This wasn’t a direction he normally took, and for a moment he was caught off guard by the foreign landscape.
Out in the sunlight, away from all the horrors of Hell the soul still glowed like the brightest star Dean had seen. It was beyond beautiful, and something deep within him wanted nothing more than to protect it from harm. Not for the first time Dean had to wonder what the soul had done to entice him in so short of a time. It was mystifying but there would be time for reflection later, he was sure. Now it was time to put the soul back where it belonged.
“You got it mi amigo!” Garth chirped, completely oblivious to Dean’s inner turmoil. “We’re coming up on a slew of restaurants so I’ll swing through and we’ll get ya something!”
Gabriel. Castiel’s eyes misted over without his permission and he thought he heard someone whimper but he just didn’t give a damn. He clung back to Gabriel all the same and didn’t deign to answer; they both knew what he’d say anyway.
“Skipping right past the pleasantries, I like that!” Meg grinned her approval, flashing her teeth at him. “To start you’re here because our dear Castiel has decided you’re worth keeping around. Me? I’m not sure about that yet since we just met ‘an all but I’ll let you know! Secondly, Castiel is out of the building!” She laughed at her own joke, leaning forward again. “He’s at work duffus, where else would he be? It’d be too suspicious if he up and disappeared at the same time as you, duh! So for now you’re stuck with lil ‘ole me!”
A sob ripped through him out of nowhere causing Dean to slap both hands over his mouth.
Dean still doesn’t say anything, for what is there to say? He doesn’t even feel bad really...all he feels inside is blank. “Is the ambulance on the way?” He asks, voice hollow. He figures it is but he needs to fill the silence somehow before Sam takes it upon himself to do so. There’s going to be questions, lots of them, Dean knows, but he’ll deal with that when it happens.
Castiel huffed as he maneuvers past the crowd to reach the parking lot in the back. “It’s much better on the inside, I promise.” He says, distracted with finding a parking space. “Have you ever heard of the phrase ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’? It’s basically the same thing. Ah!” There was an empty spot towards the back of the lot.
The weather outside was surprisingly nice for being the middle of the night for the time of year it was. Not too hot, nor too cold with no fog to be seen. Gabriel let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding as he drank it all in. The churning feelings from the nightmare were still lingering, but for now it was nice to see some calm in the world. He pulled his jacket closer together as he surveyed the area. He’d been so dog-tired when they pulled in he hadn’t paid much attention but now that he was wide awake it was time to check things out! Surely there was a bar around here somewhere--almost every little town had one in some form or another. With that in mind Gabriel picked a direction at random and headed off.
For a moment Benny simply gaped at him, mouth hanging open in shock before he tossed his head back and let loose with a bellowing laugh. It’s a jovial sound, and just like the silence from a few moments ago, it helped ease something deep within Dean. He grinned, caught up in the humor, and before he knew it, he’s laughing alongside Benny.
~*~*~
“Hey there handsome,” They say softly, one hand resuming the gentle stroking through Dean’s hair. “I bet you’re feeling uncomfortable, huh?” They ask and in another life Dean would have snorted because that’s an understatement if he’d ever heard one. Hannah must catch the meaning behind his look anyway for their face breaks into a big grin. “Right, stupid question, huh?” They say with a gentle laugh that’s music to Dean’s ears. He still doesn’t have a clue as to what’s going on--why they’re here in the first place--but he finds he doesn’t care. They’re here, and they’re touching him gently and really that’s all that matters in the moment.
Hannah nodded, matching Meg’s frown with one of their own. The whole situation sucked but Meg was right; it was all they had. “He’s been searching everywhere nearly every day. He showed up at the club a couple of weeks ago and was asking all kinds of questions. Poor guy, he seems like he’s at the end of his rope.” They moved their hand down, stroking carefully over Dean’s bruised face. “I’ll take him as far as I can, just like we discussed.”
someone!” There was a pause as the speaker took a breath, presumably to get themselves under control before continuing. “People have been looking for him for weeks now and you’re saying he’s been here the entire time?”
Gabriel… The thought of his brother bolstered him enough into sitting upright in the seat as hope slowly began to fill his chest. Castiel may have only gotten a year for himself but Gabriel was alive! That was worth anything, even the looming fear of Hell, and suddenly the only thing Cas wanted was to see him. He needed to see for himself that his brother was safe and sound; he didn’t think he'd truly settle until he did.
(See the end of the chapter for
What in the name of their Father had gone on here while Dean had been gone? Had everyone lost their minds? Dean floundered, feeling distinctly like a fish out of water as he squinted between Garth and Sam, trying to figure out what their game was here. “A hero.” He echoed flatly, eyes still flickering between the other two, “Why? I didn’t do anything!” Dean hadn’t realized his voice was growing louder by the end there but he certainly realized it when all the excited chatter from his garrison abruptly dropped off. It didn’t take a genius to feel all the eyes upon him and Dean found himself swallowing hard in response. Still he limited himself to focusing on Garth and Sam because out of everyone they were the two he trusted the most to have his back with whatever this was.
Garth noticed his discomfort immediately. “You alright, my man?” He asked, concerned. “There aren’t many spots but I can find some place to pull over if you need me too!” He glanced back at Dean in the rear view mirror again. “I can swing around a drive thru and get something to drink or some ice or something if you think that would help too!”

Dean tells himself even as his body grunts and is moved along with Castiel’s.
Dean groaned again, louder. Leave it to Sam to keep hounding when all Dean wanted him to do was drop it. He fixed his brother with the best glare he could considering he was only working with one usable eye and growled: “Leave it Sam!” He loved his brother, he truly did, but damn if he couldn’t be annoying as hell sometimes! “I’m fine.” Or, well he would be once the painkillers he took a while back kicked in. Dean had been trying to get as comfortable as possible while he waited, or he had been until Sam had come knocking down his door. Now here he was at ass 'o'clock in the morning trying to calm down a raging giant! “I’m fine!” He repeated, louder, just in case Sam didn’t get it the first time around.
“Just peachy.” Dean grunted, making no move to get into the car.He knew they were on a schedule—it was the same damn one every day—but he didn’t give a damn this morning. He lifted his head, giving Benny a good view of his blood-shot eyes and pale-white face, ignoring his offer to call someone. “Please tell me you brought coffee.”
Distantly, like he’s off floating on a cloud he can hear the grunting, panting as Castiel begins chasing his pleasure.
Meg leaned back and rested her arms on the edge of the bed. Where she had looked joking only a moment ago now she eyed him seriously and with a degree of sympathy. “Look kid, unfortunately for you it really is that simple. Castiel wanted you and here you are. He happened to see you and thought you were attractive and you know the rest. I don’t ask about his process in choosing who he does, and he doesn’t offer. Them’s the facts and the sooner you come to terms with it the better. If you don’t you’ll only drive yourself crazy asking ‘why’. Also, and I thought this one would be obvious, but apparently not… I’m Castiel’s wife.”
Somehow, he manages to doze off. It’s a dangerous thing because Castiel could come back at any time but there’s no fighting biology no matter how uncomfortable he currently is. He’s exhausted and injured and so, so heartsick. It’s comparable to someone sticking a serrated knife in his heart and twisting round and ‘round. It hurts and is sickening, and Dean’s inner omega wails its eternal displeasure of it all.
?! “I’m just a joke to you, is that it? You get your rocks off kidnapping people? You that hard to please or what?” His voice rose with his anger. Dean wanted nothing more than to storm over and strangle the alpha despite the fact he couldn’t bound as he was. “You’ve gotta be fuckin’ kidding me!”
The guy broke out into an honest to goodness grin that made his strange eyes light up even more. “We have not,” the guy said, sounding strangely sad about that, “But I have met your brother, Castiel.” The way he said Castiel was almost reverent, like whispering a prayer.
Sam frowned. He didn’t buy what Dean was selling but if past experience had taught him anything, it was that he wasn’t going to win against his brother. Dean could out-stubborn Sam, which was quite the feat, and so he had learned when to just drop things. “Fine.” He sighed grudgingly. “Do you need help getting back inside?”
Without ever really realizing it the world for Dean narrowed down to that bright light. The cries and screams of the damned, the fire and smoke, the unrelenting demons, all of it slowly faded away. All that remained was the light; it flicked occasionally but it seemed to beckon to him in a way he couldn’t deny. Whatever it was it had a pull to it, a desperate need that hooked Dean like a tether that pulled him ever closer. He didn’t even realize he was nearly upon it until he was literally right there and the light was right there, close enough to touch.
! He thinks, horrified, and feeling spun out. He knew Castiel could be violent—he’d seen that up close already—but the man had been relentless last night. It was like seeing his alpha side for the first time and Dean wasn’t ashamed to say he wasn’t still scared shitless from witnessing it. Who wouldn’t be?
Mind settled, he moved before he could allow himself to think about it further. He pawed at the dirt like a dog preparing to bury a bone, and the thought made a hysterical chuckle slip out. He dug just far enough to drop the box in before smoothing the dirt back over the top again. In moments it looked like nothing had even disturbed the spot.
"I'm fine." He grit out instead of moaning pathetically like he wanted to. “Guess I’m just not used to getting it every night.” He joked weakly as he gingerly shifted into a more comfortable position, not that there was any. He didn’t remember exactly what Cas had done--something Dean fully blamed on the bottles of imported honey brown ale Cas had generously supplied--but it must’a been a doozy. He had thought after a few weeks he’d be used to it--the sex, not the beer--but he was wrong. Dean can’t complain, though. Cas may put him through the paces, sure, but Dean’s not so low-key obsession with the alpha hasn’t dimmed at all. Even after all this time Dean still doesn’t know what kind of pull Cas has on him but he eagerly keeps going back for more,
Meg sighed, frustrated. It didn’t take a genius to see that Dean didn’t understand a single word she’d just said, so what now? It wasn’t like she had any other options here aside from digging around for the fake knot she used when Castiel was off ‘working’. “I can’t believe I got stuck with this!” She grumbled under her breath, glaring up at the camera once more. While this was far from her first kidnapped omega rodeo that was the first time one of them had went into heat and it wasn’t like there was an instruction manual. “Okay.” She said out loud like Dean had actually replied instead of the weak kitten noise he’d made. “Let’s give the bath a try.” If that didn’t work she was willing to sacrifice her toy for the good of the omega. Though privately she doubted Dean would be able to use it even if Castiel gave her permission to unchain one of his hands. Ugh. Why did she get stuck with the literal shit job of the equation?
Slowly, worried at aggravating the pain even more, Dean turns his head enough to see a tall stern looking man leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. It’s Gadreel, the club’s bouncer. Dean’s been here enough to recognize the alpha though what he’s doing here is just as much as a mystery as to why Dean’s here himself. “W—what happened?” He asks, wincing at the drag in his throat. He’s so thirsty.
Just like before it rang and rang before the voicemail kicked on again. Glancing at the time, Sam scowled deeper as he bit out a message: “Answer the phone you jerk! A friend of ours said you were sick. Why didn’t you call me? Either way I’m going to swing by there after work, and no you don’t get a say in it! If you need anything before then call me!” Ending the call, Sam leaned back in his seat and sighed. A couple of missed calls wasn’t anything to get concerned over, Sam knew, but he couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that there was something more going on.
He thought miserably as he stared out the window at the passing scenery. Since he'd ridden to the club with Castiel in the first place Hannah had arranged for a car to pick him up to take him home.
A good fifty minutes later Dean has been scrubbed, dried, and put back into bed amidst fresh sheets and a clean blanket. His temperature had come down some but he’d remained docile throughout everything. He whimpered and groaned throughout the scrubbing though he hadn’t truly woken from whatever state he’s trapped in. Now that he’s bad in bed Meg leans up against the doorway between the bathroom and bedroom and scrubs at her eyes tiredly. She’s wiped not only from the labor of cleaning, drying, and manhandling Dean but from scrubbing the bathroom down afterwards.
“Ah. Ah. Not so fast!” The demon chided, somehow managing to hold up a finger between them to waggle in Castiel’s face. “There’s a catch, don’cha know? You even think about breaking this and dear big brother drops dead just like that!” It snapped to drive the point home. “Same thing applies to him as well; if he or anyone else tries to break the contract he’s a dead man walking and there won’t be any coming back the second time!”
The majority of the day is spent asleep. Unfortunately Dean can’t even call it an escape for nightmares plague him at every turn. From dreams of Castiel to dreams of the supernatural horrors they faced when filming the show, it all ran the gamut in Dean’s mind. Being awake wasn’t much better--he felt weak and shaky and he was hungry enough that he very nearly considered digging through the dumpster for something to put in his stomach. If it wasn’t for his arm, which was nearly transcendent from the pain, he probably would have.
He thought hysterically.
It takes an eternity, Dean will recall later, but finally with a final loud grunt and a surge of hot wetness deep inside that he doesn’t want to think about, it’s over. Castiel collapses above him, a heavy human shaped blanket of satisfaction yet Dean is barely aware of it. He feels separated from everything—his body, the entire situation. It’s safer this way, he thinks dully, perhaps he can stay this way forever; hiding behind the haze of cotton whiteness that has risen out of nowhere….
While Dean doesn’t think a lot of time passes between closing his eyes and opening them again, he realizes some must have for Meg is standing in front of him, a frown fixed firmly in place. She looks like she just rolled out of bed in a pair of bright blue bumblebee patterned pajama pants and a darker blue Wayward tank top. Just the sight of her crumbles the last of Dean’s willpower, and without his consent, he bursts into tears and leans towards her seeking comfort. If his arms were free he’d be reaching out like a toddler wanting a hug. He should be humiliated, he knows, but he can’t find it in himself anywhere to give a damn. Meg’s been nothing but soothing towards him and for once in his life Dean’s willing to ask for the hugs and loving he so desperately needs.
he chided himself, hating the way his voice sounded unexpectedly shaky in the stillness of the car. Of course Cas wasn't in the car with him; it was hardly the first time Gabriel had dropped his brother off somewhere between a hunt and had gone back to get him later on. "A good night's rest is what I need." He muttered to himself as he turned his attention back to the road.
The End.
Then there’s no more time left. Not to think, nor plead, nor even breathe; between one breath Dean feels the tip of Castiel’s cock nudging at his hole and the next he’s ramming into him with what feels like all his might. It
“Huh,” Sam said as he dug in his pocket for his wallet. “Bobby didn’t say anything about him sounding sick on the phone. Though it’d be just his luck to go on vacation and end up sick!” He pulled the money from his wallet and handed it over. “I’ll give him a call though just to check.”
He thought as he moved to curl up...and froze solid when his right leg drug across the floor.
So...why wasn’t he moving?
Castiel remains where he is for a moment and busies himself with simply watching the slow rise and fall of Dean’s chest. The omega is going to be a roadmap of bruises in a few hours and it’ll be simply beautiful to witness. The alpha smiles as he pictures it, and he’s still grinning when he finally slides his way off the bed. He takes a moment to straighten his clothing before he heads for the steel door.
about it hurt soul-deep and left Gabriel feeling like he was going to puke. The feeling only intensified as Asmodeus took several steps closer to the driver’s side door. “Holy shit! Holy fucking
“I hope so,” Dean muttered but he let it drop. He wanted to have a good time tonight and he was determined that nothing was going to stand in his way of it! Still, he couldn’t help but continue to stare up at the building as they parked and got out of the car. “How did you find this place anyway?” He asked as they headed across the lot to where the line was. Going by the outside of the place alone it didn’t scream ‘party over here!’, at least not in Dean’s opinion.
time to go… Castiel gave up all pretenses of trying to be subtle and flat out ran for it. He didn’t care how it looked for him to be running away like a little kid who’d gotten in too deep; he needed to get out of there. Now. He scrambled into the car with the sounds of maniacal laughter filling his ears. It was a relief when he finally slammed the door shut, cutting off the horrible sound.
“Sir?” The voice from earlier is back as well, and just as hesitant as before. “Can you hear us?”
By the time Castiel stopped Dean could barely breathe, let alone take in enough air to reply. His head and arms were a mass of throbbing that his brain could hardly make sense of. Dean wheezed out a breath and tried his damndest to curl up despite not being able to move. Pain shook him to the core and he whimpered and groaned, unable to do anything else.
It had seemed like a good idea earlier when Cas was rutting up against him in the shower as they got ready but now that he’s had a few hours of exposure, Dean’s over it. Now he just wants to piss, go home, and go to bed. The only problem with that is Cas doesn’t seem to share his sentiments…if the hand clamped down on his right thigh is any indication. Dean hadn’t known Cas was such a possessive bastard but once the guy got a few drinks in him, well. Dean would be lying if he said he didn’t get a bit of a thrill out of the way Castiel’s inner alpha seems to rear up wanting to keep the omega for himself. Now if he’d just listen to what Dean was saying….
Chapter Warning: stalking/stalking behaviors
Is Castiel here? Dean honestly doesn’t know. If not for Hannah and their name tag he wouldn’t have even known he was in the club, let alone there with Cas. Everything is a blur, and when he tries to think back his head throbs with a deep warning pain. He winces, an involuntary whimper leaving his lips. Outside his control he tenses, coiled and ready for a fight though he doesn’t understand why.
Watching Sam capitulate so easily made some of the tension ease in Dean’s shoulders. He didn’t want to fight with Sam--he wasn’t John, and therefore wasn’t the proverbial enemy. “I know,” He sighed, shoulders lowering a fraction. “It
Decided, Gabe moved further into the place and considered his options. There was a long bar directly across from the door with high metal stools spanning the length. Two men in trucker caps and flannel shirts sat at opposite ends of it, both more focused on their food than Gabriel. Beyond the two people Gabriel could see moving about in the kitchen part of the place, the guys were the only people in the place aside from him. Something in him un-clenched even further at the realization he wouldn’t be dealing with a lot of people, and that more than anything, had Gabe slumping into the nearest seat at one of the tables.
"Well, if you're sure..." Garth trailed off, and Dean didn't need to see it to know the guy was up there pouting his disappointment. He seemed like a good guy, and had they met under different circumstances Dean could see him possibly becoming friends with him. The phone buzzed in his lap again but Dean barely glanced at it. From the time he'd woken until now Castiel had been calling practically non-stop. He'd filled up Dean's voice mail in under an hour and had simply kept going from there. The phone finally clicked off signaling that he'd hung up but Dean knew it wouldn't be long before he tried again.
The thought filtered through Dean’s head slowly, trickling in alongside consciousness. He shivered, still more asleep than awake as he wondered what had happened to his blankets. Even when he wasn’t nesting it was rare that he slept without a blanket or two on the bed. Shifting groggily, he went to reach for the blanket...only to realize he couldn’t. “What the?” He slurred, waking up just a fraction more as he tried moving his arms again. He wasn’t imagining it--his arms didn’t move. Dean blinked blurry eyes,  perplexed. This was certainly strange to say the least. Both of his arms had been tightly pinned behind him by...something...he didn’t know what.
?!” Unsurprisingly it’s Dean who breaks the tense silence that’s fallen between the three of them. While he makes sure to keep one wary eye on the gun the rest of his attention goes to focus on Castiel’s face. It’s harder than he thought it’d be, looking his rapist and torturer in the eyes, but Dean does it anyway. There’s nothing but malice pouring out from those blue depths and for the life of him Dean doesn’t know how he missed it before. “Put the damn gun down!” He orders, proud of the way his voice doesn’t wobble despite his churning emotions.
Between one blink and the next the illusion shattered; the woman looked no different than from before, though now she did look a bit bored. “Well, that all depends on you there, handsome.”
Slowly Sam turns his head to appraise his brother. His lip is bleeding and his right eye is well on its way to swelling shut but he’s unharmed. He blinks, unable to find words for what just happened.
The wailing follows him down into the dark.
Chapter warning: Possibly unsettling depictions of Hell and of corpses.
Dean stared, flabbergasted. Was he really getting dating advice from his cab driver? Seriously, what was his life? “Uh,” He coughed, not even sure where to begin addressing any of that. “It’s something like that I guess…” Sure, he guessed… What was he, a twelve-year-old girl going through her first breakup? He groaned, shifting slightly in his seat. It was a mistake--a stab of pain shot through his ass and up his spine, nearly stealing his breath away. A whimper slipped out before he could stop it and he squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to see Garth’s reaction. The guy was practically drowning in blockers so it was impossible to tell what designation he was but either way Dean was sure he wouldn’t be receptive to a whiny omega.
Before he knew it Dean had actually made his way into the house. He blinked at his living room, surprised.
Dean wished he had the answers, but he didn’t. He didn’t even have the time to ponder the questions; somehow when he wasn’t paying attention it was like a switch had been flicked to life around them. Demons were scaling the rocky terrain and Dean had little doubt that it was time to get out of here. Shoving his reservations aside, he didn’t even think: he grabbed the soul around what would have been the human’s waist, and hauled ass out of there.
Someone is yelling his name, Dean’s near certain of it, but the sound is far away. It’s like someone shouting from a far-off tunnel but Dean can’t focus on it. The black spots in his vision continue to grow and take his concentration along with it. His heart feels like it’s going to beat straight out of his chest even as his lungs burn for the air they so desperately need but aren’t getting. What the hell is happening? A wail starts up somewhere, and god the sound stabs Dean right through his soul. It’s high and thin and sounds just like a dying animal. Dean hopes whatever it is gets put out of its misery; it’d be the merciful thing to do. The world collapses around him, the darkness growing, and all Dean can do is gasp and gasp without any reprieve.
“Oooh so strong and determined!” The demon all but cooed, even going so far to bring a hand up to its borrowed chest. “I like that in a man!” Before Castiel could even begin thinking of a reply for that one he found himself hauled in impossibly closer to the demon by an invisible hand. He stiffened, only to be met with its face mere inches away from his own. “As fun as this is let’s talk turkey, shall we?”
Hannah beams at him, their mango sunshiny scent growing more pronounced at Dean’s words. “That’s right! I’ve seen you and your alpha here before.” They confirm with a relieved smile that feels a tad out of place considering the way Dean still hurts. “Is he here with you?”
“Damn it!” Sam shouted, relishing the way his voice echoed in the empty stairway. It felt like being heard despite there being no one there to hear it. He sighed and shifted and scrubbed a hand harshly down his face. He was being childish—off crying alone because he was putting his needs before his brig brother’s…just like he always had. Ugh. Sam huffed, disgusted with himself. As appealing as it currently was, he couldn’t hide away in the stairs forever and Sam knew it.
Instead of responding outright Benny simply rolled his eyes before turning to reach back into the car. “Had a feeling you might be needin’ one this morning.” He said before the smell of freshly brewed coffee split the air as he pulled from the back of the car a large to-go cup. “You sure you’re up for this?”
Is she doing the right thing? She wonders as she stops and leans against the steel door once she’s shut it on the room. She doesn’t have a clue but for better or worse she’s determined to see this through until the end. Frown deepening, she pushes off the door and goes to see where Castiel is hiding. He has some explaining to do.
Sam deflated like someone had let air out of a balloon. “I’m not saying it’s any of my business,” he started, well aware he was treading a fine line that he wasn’t aware he had crossed until it was too late. “I just don’t want to see you hurt is all.” Considering how picky his brother was at the best of times Sam could easily picture that happening.
“Oh gross!” Sam recoiled, horror wrote into every line of his face. “I do not need to hear about your sex life dude!” In true little brother fashion he began making gagging noises. There were just some things that weren’t meant to be shared between brothers! “You’re such a jerk Dean!”
Dean loses some time sniffling out his fear and pain to the stillness of the night, but eventually he finds he absolutely must move. His bladder is aching for release and as much as he doesn’t want to get up the prospect of Castiel coming back to find Dean’s wet the bed like a pup isn’t one the omega is willing to consider.
Up in the front Garth eyed his charge with sympathy in his eyes. He could feel all the sadness and hurt emanating from his passenger and it broke his heart. He hated to see someone hurting, and after being informed by Hannah that Dean had refused to go to the hospital he had been determined to make things better. So far he didn’t think he was doing that great of job but he was going to continue to try anyway. At the very least his passenger deserved it.
A small pain filled whimper brings Castiel back around to the present. He blinks and looks down to find Dean watching him with wide eyes.
Please see the end notes for a brief description if you'd rather skip it.
Gabriel blinked, flummoxed. Distantly he heard the familiar tune of Ace of Base ‘I Saw the Sign’ start over the diner’s sound system but all his attention was on the stranger. “Have we met?” He muttered, wondering when his life had gotten so weird that strangers in diners seemed to know who he was. Gabriel was fairly sure he didn’t know the guy, at least he semi-hoped not because it’d have been a damn shame to forget that face.
Shaking his head, and still chuckling to himself under his breath, Benny walked down the walkway and got into the driver’s seat. In the back Dean had melted into the plush leather seat, his head tilted back, and eyes closed, though the scowl remained firmly in place. It’s adorable—though that’s not something Benny would ever admit out loud—and he can’t help grinning at the sight. “Let’s go get some grub!” He calls out cheerfully as he starts the vehicle back up.
“I’m sorry we didn’t get there sooner.” Another voice, somewhat softer than Dean’s spoke up from the opposite side of Gabriel’s bed. It was enough to prompt him into opening his eyes again and he was relieved to find it was easier this time. Blinking against the light Gabriel looked up to find an unfamiliar set of hazel eyes looking down from a concerned face. “Who’re you?” He slurred, sounding as tired as Castiel had, though he was bolstered by the look of relief that passed across the man’s face.
Dean hasn't so much as twitched and Castiel takes a long moment to appreciate every detail of the way the omega looks. Thanks to Meg he's been cleaned from head to toe and still smells faintly of the soap she used. Castiel's grateful, and not just for the obvious reasons. Dean's been positioned onto his stomach and the sight of so much pale skin mottled by bruises of various colors makes Castiel's mouth water. He traces the pattern of them with his eyes, just barely tamping down on the urge to lean in and lick the path of them. Even the omega's cock, just barely visible between the slight spread of his thighs is a deep purplish color that has Castiel practically salivating. There's no doubt--he's going to enjoy this.
With the show shut down everyone had gone their separate ways for the time being. Even Castiel, who had another house somewhere out of state, had decided to go back home for now. While Sam couldn’t blame him, especially after the man went on about how his housekeeper had been having trouble with a new puppy, he had foolishly hoped the other alpha would stay. It was childish, but Sam didn’t like being alone. He never had—even as a pup Dean had always been there even when their father hadn’t been. It wasn’t like Sam had been completely abandoned, either. He still had his beautiful mate Ruby, and both Bobby and Benny lived close enough they were a short drive away, but it wasn’t the same. Dean was the glue that held everyone together, Sam included.
More than anything else the fact that Gabriel used his full name shocked Castiel into listening. Gabriel was a man full of ridiculous nicknames and usually called Castiel everything except his actual name. The fact that he was willing to use his name now was both shocking and just proved the seriousness of his words. Silently, Castiel nodded. He was willing to let it drop...for now. Somewhere down the line he was sure he’d get to the truth of the matter.
On the inside, however, things weren’t that simple. Oh, the fame and fortune and nice house was all true, of course, but none of that mattered since Dean was alone. While he relished playing bad-boy, heartthrob Jensen Ackles in real life he was about as far from being the man as he could get. The fact that he was already twenty-six and wasn’t mated, or even had an alpha for that matter, hung over his head like a pendulum.
Still murmuring soft nothings, Dean carefully lowered the soul until it was laid out overtop it’s mortal body. “Sorry man, this is going to hurt..” He warned before he gave the soul a little shove. The light grew brighter in alarm as the soul sunk down into the body but Dean only smiled. The body jerked once, as if having a convulsion, and then began to breathe. “You’ll be okay,” Dean told it before turning away from the now living body. There was just one thing left to do.
She smells like mango and sunshine, Dean notices absently, though there’s a strange chemical undertone that makes his nose twitch. It all clicks in place when she stands, the black pants and white shirt with tie combo tipping Dean off to her being one of the club staff. “I’m Hannah,” She says, noticing the way he’s staring up at her, “I work here.” She taps gently on the gold-plated name tag attached to her shirt, leaning in enough that Dean can read it without strain: ‘The Blue Parrot: HANNAH, They/Them’
Was this guy for real? Dean was so shocked by the outpouring of concern coming from a virtual stranger he nearly cried. “I--uh--” He started but stopped because he honestly didn’t know what to say. He was more used to concern covering as a front for an inquisition so in the face of Garth’s earnestness he didn’t have a clue. Ice sounded like a wonderful idea--if he wasn’t in the back of a cab Dean would have no problem sitting on a giant pile of ice. At the very least it would numb his ass enough to where it would dull the pain some. “Maybe just the drink?” He offered up hesitantly, unwilling to fully believe Garth wasn’t just teasing him. “Or the ice…”
. Castiel really can’t thank Meg enough for the good job she’d done after she’d gotten Dean back into bed. Once the omega had been drugged into sleep, she’d went to work spreading rose petals everywhere. Unlike the normal cliché of red roses these petals were an alluring pink that darkened to a near purple color as they died. The contrast was beautiful; they covered the floor, the bed, there was even a trail leading into the bathroom. The omega had looked simply delicious splayed out in the middle of the bed with the petals arranged around him just so. Castiel wasn’t ashamed to admit he'd gotten off just watching Meg work thanks to the hidden cameras that connected to the laptop in their bedroom. By the time she’d been done and Castiel had gotten to take in the whole effect he’d been rock hard and leaking once more. He licked his lips as he recalled the way he had pounced Meg as soon as she’d gotten back to their room. They’d both been desperate--they didn’t make it to the bed. They’d rutted up against the wall like they were teenagers again until they both came screaming Dean’s name.
Dean wondered as he dropped his head down onto the window. The cool glass pane was soothing against his hot skin and he sighed into it. This whole thing was such a mess yet he didn't have a clue as to what to do about it. What
The demon grinned like it’d been reading his damned mind, and who knew, it probably had been. Case in point: it pouted those dark painted lips at him before saying sadly “Unfortunately for you we need to get down to business. The clock’s ticking down on your dear brother the longer you stall here.”
There’s a feeling of wetness on his cheeks and much to Dean’s humiliation he realizes he’s crying.
“When you’re ready, we’ll head out.” He said leaning back to look up at the sky, partially to give Dean some privacy to get his head on right, and partially to watch the changing colors of the sunrise.
“Get the fuck off me!” Castiel screeched as he clawed at Sam’s face. The younger alpha had him outmatched in weight but not in wit. And unfortunately for Sam Castiel was willing to fight dirty. He bit and clawed and cursed as he struggled to overthrow Sam’s bulk. The gun was right there...all he had to do was be the first one to get it.
There was a beat of silence. When no answer was forthcoming Dean listened to the crunch of gravel under the other man’s boots as he turned to look at him. “You okay there, brother?” Benny asked, worry edging into his normally calm scent. “You need me to call someone?”
Dean thinks harshly, not at all cowed despite Cas stealing his voice with his little trick. It’ll wear off soon enough and then Dean will
Dean thought as he carefully rolled, wiggled, and finally pushed his way up off the bed to standing. The move had been tricky to do at first, and the realization that he’d been there long enough to do so now was sobering. He was trapped like the proverbial rat and it was all his fault.
Eventually he found the will to move once more. No matter the state of his brother, either alive or dead, Castiel couldn’t feasibly stand in the middle of a field all night long. So he continued on, his head feeling like it was stuffed full of cotton thanks to all the thoughts racing circles through it. As the sunlight gradually slipped away to night he thought he saw lights in the distance to which he breathed a sigh of relief. With any luck he wouldn’t have to spend the night in the field after all.
that long--surely he would have noticed it being day time--but who could say?
weird.” He admitted after a beat. “I don’t know man, there’s just something about Cas that I can’t get out of my head!” He meant that quite literally since he’d been thinking about the alpha nearly non-stop since he’d woken up this morning. “We had a good time last night.” That wasn’t even a lie--while things had started off a tad rocky the night had gone surprisingly well. Dean figured some of that had to do with the blonde ale Castiel kept supplying him with as well as the awesome food. Dean wasn’t ashamed to admit he’d actually had a dream about those meatballs, they’d been that damned good!
Sam shook his head, ignoring the way his sweat-drenched hair whipped around to smack him in the face. Dean was ruining everything; the show, Sam’s life, and not to mention his own. Where the hell could he have gone?! Wherever he was Sam hoped he was sure as fuck enjoying it because once Sam caught up to him, there was going to be definite hell to pay.
The world around Dean narrowed down to a tunnel as he stared down the barrel of the gun.
What he sees doesn’t make him feel any better. Dean’s sound asleep, dead to the world, and if not for the presence of the oxygen tube still carefully looped up under his nose Sam would worry that he had died. As it is Dean doesn’t look to be too many steps above it. What skin that can be seen between the bandages and extensive bruising is pallid and there’s a smudge of deep purplish bruising underneath his right eye. The left is an utter mess of ugly bruising and has swelled completely shut. Sam can feel a low growl start in his throat as his eyes travel downwards, taking note of the way Dean’s lower lip is split and swollen as well and the tell-tale bruising around his chin where someone—whoever the bastard was that hurt him—had roughly grabbed him.
If anyone had asked Gabriel Novak where he planned to settle down one day he would have laughed that person in the face and declared he was never going to settle down. Boy, look at him now: it’d only been four months since Castiel had been killed to save his hide and yet Gabriel hadn’t moved on. Though truly, couldn’t move on was probably a better description. He’d never fancied himself a country man but four months of fresh air and sunlight and no hunting had done some wonders for him. Oh, Gabriel didn’t think it was going to last forever. He’d been in the hunting life for too long to know forever was a concept made up by people who didn’t live hand to mouth running credit card schemes just to keep themselves clothed and fed. It was also for those who weren’t currently living out of a Jubilee Gold 1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V.
Still, one couldn’t stall forever. With one last glance back Dean took in the reassuring looks of Sam and Garth before he turned back to the wasteland of the Pit before them. “Fake it ‘til you make it!” He muttered under his breath as he led the charge.
The fact that an angel needed consent to take a vessel was supposed to be reassuring, Gabriel figured, but frankly he felt pretty far from reassured at the moment. How could he not be when his life was effectively circling the toilet? He shuddered and shook his head, pushing the darker thoughts to the back of his head where they belonged. “As fascinating as that is--and we’re totally going to circle back around to that at some point--you aren’t here to tell me about vessels and shit, right?” Gabriel didn’t know where the sudden calmness was coming from to infuse his words but he went with it before he lost his nerve entirely. “You said your...boss? Bobby? Knew how to deal with A-Asmodeus?” His voice broke on the name and he dropped his head to eye his plate rather than see whatever look the angel surely had on his borrowed face over it.
This is just like the panic from the restroom that day except it’s so much worse. He’s like a rat caught in a trap and squished between Castiel’s weight and the bed to boot. There’s nowhere to go and nowhere to run and as Castiel rams into him in one hot, long slide Dean feels something within him break. A sob tears from his throat as Castiel bottoms out and Dean just. . . checks out.
Dean hadn’t meant to fall asleep but when he woke it was to find he was warm and vaguely comfortable.
Despite himself Dean had to smile. Leave it to Benny to get protective of him like he was one of the man’s pups or something. “I appreciate it,” he said as he reached for the coffee cup. “But I’ll go. If I miss any more days Sam’ll show up like the overprotective mother hen he is and start stinking the place up with his worried pheromones!” Dean scrunched up his nose just thinking about it and took a big sip of his coffee just to get the phantom scent out of his head.

It took some searching but finally Dean found them--buried in a grave in the middle of a field in West Virginia. Between one blink and the next he and the soul had travelled there, the latter still cradled by his wings. It took little effort to exhume the pitiful grave, and Dean felt a stab of remorse that the beautiful soul hadn’t warranted something better. “I’m sorry, bud.” He told the soul, unsurprised for when it merely buried itself further into his wings. Hell aside, the poor thing seemed starved for affection and Dean was determined to do what he could while he still had the chance.
Dean wonders next; his panted breathes sounding loud and heavy in his ears. Sadly, there are no answers. There’s just the feel of his jeans and boxers being shoved further down his legs.
He told himself,
Dean looked at him like he was crazy which just made Gabriel laugh all the harder. It didn’t help that the whole thing was backed to “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” which just made it all the more ridiculous. Gabriel wheezed and shook his head, beyond answering.
The rest of the ride was spent in silence although it was much more comfortable. But before they knew it the three of them found themselves staring up at the mouth of a familiar alleyway that had both Gabriel and Castiel frowning. Despite their lives changing so much since then the alley looked much the same--the same windswept and sun faded brick walls, the same grungy green dumpster overflowing with refuse, and the same bright red door that stood between the three of them and certain hell.
Chapter warnings: Depressed Dean, paranoia, Stalking behavior & kidnapping
“Mmmhmmm!” Dean moans, louder this time, though considering the noise is barely above a grunt it’s hardly impressive. He does try to open his eyes, however. It’s slow-going; he’s sure each eyelid is weighted down with a ten-ton weight. In the end he only manages a slit, and only gets a brief, blurry flash of too bright before slamming his eyes shut once more.
“You’re a fucking disappointment!” The ghost of John Winchester shouts in his head and Dean cringes under the weight of the phantom. Things are bad enough without adding his father into the mix, he thinks bitterly. John was another alpha who’d set out to hurt Dean, and much like Castiel he had succeeded in doing so. It just figured that he’d rear his opinions when Dean was being hurt yet again by another alpha he trusted. When Castiel kisses him, Dean lets him. What’s the point in trying to fight anymore?
Gabriel blinked, obviously taken aback by the venom in his brother’s voice. He gaped wordlessly for a moment before deflating all at once like someone had let all the air out of him. “Cas…” He sighed, his gaze flitting away from the furious blue eyes staring at him. “It wasn’t supposed to be like that.” He said, the words so quiet they were practically a whisper. “Balth took me to a club, I didn’t expect what happened to happen.”
Later, as it turns out comes and goes without Dean ever being aware of it. Sleep has become his safe haven, his refuge, and he’s barely surfaced from it. Why should he? Better to sleep than suffer, he thinks, drifting back under without fully being awake.
Below him Dean gurgled out what could have either been an insult or an apology had it been able to be understood. The pain was more than overwhelming--he’d never felt any like it in his life! He had enough presence of mind to realize he’d bitten his tongue as blood filled his mouth before it dripped out onto the sheets below.
The fourth wall, what he could see of it, looked to be unfinished stone that someone had painted over with a deep yellowish gold color. A heavy brown curtain hung down one side of it, possibly covering a window. The bed was directly behind him--one of those fancy modern looking ones with just a thin headboard and cream and dark colored bedding. It was the only piece of furniture he could see in the room, and not for the first time Dean had to wonder just what in the hell had happened to him. Was this a joke? Who the fuck would go through all the trouble just to kidnap him in the first place?
“Sir?” The voice inquired hesitantly, “Can you hear me?” It’s a calm voice, carefully kept neutral--probably a Beta by Dean’s estimate—and has an air of someone who’s been asking the same question over and over for a while, “Sir?”
To Dean’s profound relief Castiel didn’t seem put off by Dean’s stumbling and stammering and general stupidity. Glancing away from the road, he fixed Dean with a brief worried look before resuming watching where he was going. “It’s a bar…” He said slowly, and Dean didn’t need to be able to see it to hear the frown in the alpha’s words. “and it’s a rather popular nightclub as well which was why I proposed we leave so late. I’m not sure what else would be open this time of evening but we can go somewhere else if you’d like?”
For a time after the angel left nothing of import happened in that idyllic field. The breeze blew, gently swaying the grass in its wake as woodland creatures roamed to their content. Truly it was like any other day...right up until it wasn’t.
Finally the demon pushed him back, that smug shark-grin full on its face as it eyed him over. “Not bad for a hunter,” it all but purred, “not bad at all. Too bad you won’t need those skills where you’re going!”
He wanted to groan or whine or even possibly yell but Dean didn’t dare. Cautiously he turned enough to see around the semi-open door that led into the bathroom and let out a nearly inaudible sigh of relief. Castiel was still sound asleep in his bed, right where Dean had left him a few moments prior. He was stupidly grateful he hadn’t woken the alpha. Considering he had him to thank for the way his face now looked Dean didn’t want to see what Castiel would do when angered.
“Oh you’re a feisty one, aren’t you?” The demon teased, clearly delighted at winding him up. “But that’s not the way this is going to work.” It declared, some of the amusement bleeding out of its voice. “You aren’t stupid, and neither am I Castiel Novak.” The demon paused there and hummed like it was considering something before all at once lighting up. “How about...One year. Take it or leave it.”
“Distress.” Came the reply as Dean’s head swung around so the angel was looking at Castiel fully. “There is great evil beyond the red door.” He stated, sounding disturbed by it. “I sense several non-humans as well as two human females within.”
(See the end of the chapter for
! He thought as he stared stupidly at the dark wallpaper splashed across the wall a few short feet in front of him. Delicate white vines and gold leaves spread across the dark background in a calming pattern but it was lost on Dean as he continued to stare. That wasn’t his wallpaper. Dread curling in the pit of his stomach, he squirmed his way carefully onto his side only to find his panic ratchet up another notch as he stared at the rest of the room.
Sam had the grace to look sheepish but he didn’t back down from his brother’s rising fury. “I do like him!” He retorted, “But you gotta admit there’s something weird going on here! I mean, when’s the last time you went out with anyone? Especially a coworker?” Sam had a point and he knew it--he couldn’t even remember the last time Dean had went on a date, let alone out for a drink with a coworker.
Both Hannah and Gadreel blinked at him wordlessly, shocked into speechlessness. Dean eyes first Gadreel then Hannah, his nervousness increasing. Whatever it was, it was bad, he thinks, and feels sick for it. He’s suddenly not sure he wants to know, and it shows in the way the scent of distressed omega begins filling the room.
For better or worse, between one blink and the next Chuck was gone. In his place, however, was someone far worse in Gabe’s opinion: his mother Naomi. Despite the dark, the fog, and the fact that Gabriel was sure he’d lost his mind somehow, Naomi looked as fierce as ever. The scowl on her perfectly painted lips as she eyed her middle child was something Gabriel still dreamed about, and not in the good way. He swallowed hard, torn between too many emotions to even begin fitting names to them. Naomi opened her mouth, possibly to utter a scathing retort that Gabriel remembered so well but before she could utter a sound she was gone. Vanished like she hadn’t even been there.
Holy freakin’ Mothra!” Gabe rambled, wide-eyed in fear as he watched him get closer and closer. Thankfully some part of his brain was still thinking logically because without fully deciding on it his foot slammed on the gas pedal. Gravel spun out as the car made an unholy lurching sound before it shot forward like a rocket. All Gabriel could do was laugh hysterically even as he clung to the steering wheel for dear life. He didn’t look back.
Somewhere during his sneaking around Cas had shifted, his face now facing towards the door. He looked tired, Gabriel noted with a frown. It was just like his little brother to take the weight of the world on his shoulders but it was disheartening to see the way he didn’t even seem to relax in sleep. “It’ll work out.” Gabriel whispered, though he wasn’t sure if the words were meant for himself or for Castiel. Either way he was sure they could work things out in the end, somehow. They didn’t really have a choice otherwise.
Welcome to the end! If you've read this far I'd just like to say thank you for reading! Please heed the tags!

Dean surfaces sometime later from dreams of molten lava and endless torture to crack weary eyes open in hell. It wasn’t a dream--he’s still here, still trapped. Castiel is long gone, the room cool and silent, yet Dean shivers violently in the aftermath. He can still feel Castiel’s eyes on him, can still feel every touch the alpha made against his skin. The keening wail starts up again, rising from the depths of his soul. It’s a miserable sound of loss and betrayal that echoes off the walls and sits in Dean’s bones. He languishes there, trapped in the echoes of screams and pain and knows nothing will ever be the same again.
this? It took some skilled maneuvering but eventually he managed to pull a lighter out of his pocket.
Castiel thought darkly when he was sure he finally had himself under control. Despite his mixed feelings otherwise he knew he needed to get up and try to start looking for his wayward brother. Or well, at least a phone at the very least considering he literally had no idea where he even was in the first place.
Behind him Dean stood frozen, shocked down to his core. He could feel the walls of his world closing in around him and he was powerless to stop it. Distantly he felt the impact as his knees hit the floor but he hardly cared. Nothing mattered anymore, especially not him.
Gabriel felt his jaw drop; he couldn’t help it. “W-what? Are you serious?!” He sputtered, shocked to the core. He and Castiel had a long discussion on what had happened after he’d woken up in that field, including Castiel meeting Dean. He leaned back, appraising Dean in a new light now that he knew what he was looking at. Now that he knew what to look for he was disappointed in himself for not seeing it earlier. Despite the casual gray band t-shirt and jeans Dean was wearing alongside a black leather jacket there was something about him that screamed “other!”. Perhaps it was the way he was sitting ramrod straight or perhaps it was the way his eyes seemed to glow under the fluorescent lights of the diner. Either way, once known there was no mistaking the creature sitting across him was definitely not a human. “You’re an angel.” He breathed out, shock winning out over the plethora of emotions bubbling up inside him. “You’re really real!”
Chapter warning: This chapter contains MAJOR CHARACTER DEATH, Castiel hallucinating before his deal comes due, depictions of Hellhounds that may be upsetting, and Castiel being taken to hell.
His inner voice nagged at him as he groaned and proceeded to bury his face in his hands. See, this was another reason why he didn’t date—it made him act like a damned idiot! “Do—do they have good drinks there?” He mumbled from behind his hand-shield. God, he hoped so! With the way things were going so far Dean was sure he was going to need at least half a dozen just to survive the night!
“Look at you,” Cas slurs, obviously drunk as he slides in closer. “All needy and perfect.” His hands reach out, running slowly up and down Dean’s flank, nimble fingers teasing at the hem of his shirt. “Just waiting for me, weren’t you?” The alpha breathes, the scent of whiskey practically coming out of every pore as he leans close enough for his breath to tickle the back of Dean’s neck.
Coming home again felt weird. Dean stood out in his driveway long after Garth’s taillights had disappeared around the corner yet makes no move to go inside.
Gabriel blinked slowly, unable to do much else. Gradually he became aware of little things--like the persistent sounds of beeping around them and the smell of antiseptic lingering in the air. That combined with the dawning realization that he was shaking alongside his brother spelled it out in shaking neon lights: he was in a hospital. The realization didn’t change things; he was still confused and obviously concussed but since Castiel was there everything had to be okay.
“I hope so!” Alfie looked so worried Sam’s heart practically melted right there on the spot. He shot Alfie a reassuring smile as he slowly backed towards the door. “He will, trust me! I’ll catch you later!” Sam said, giving a little wave as he pushed through the door.
Before he could decide on whether to go up or down his stomach gave a loud rumble that dully echoed in the huge space. “I guess that answers that,” he muttered to himself as he moved towards the staircase leading downwards. The idea of eating while Dean was still unconscious in his room made Sam’s stomach twinge unpleasantly.
He tried a third time, jerking harder than before only to freeze when the sound of clinking metal reached his ears. What.in.the.fuck?
Above him Castiel straightened, smirking. “That’s what I thought.” The alpha said, sounding smug. “You’ve been such a naughty puppy but you’ll learn your place soon enough.” Then, before Dean could parse through his words Castiel’s fists were flying again. He punched and pinched and hit and slapped until his hands were nothing more than a stinging mass. He hit any part of Dean he could reach: Head, arm, stomach, leg. It hardly mattered; the only thing that did was the satisfying sound of flesh hitting flesh as he pounded his point home. “You.” Punch. “Will.” Punch. “Learn.” Punch. Punch. “To obey me!”
Chuck Novak looked much the same he'd looked the last time Gabriel had seen him alive, clad in a ratty striped bathrobe with a coffee mug full of booze in one hand and a closed laptop in the other. All Gabriel could do was gape because

He could hear a commotion start up behind him along with several different voices calling his name, but he didn’t turn to look. He didn’t stop either; he just kept going. He let memory guide his way, twisting and turning down one hallway and then another before he finally reached the door for the stairs. He crashed through it at a dead run and would have kept on going if not for the large railing blocking his way.
He thought, a smile involuntarily stretching across his face. It just seemed his luck; he’d come to check on the human but the human was clearly already gone. Shrugging his wings out behind him, Dean observed the field around him for a long moment. It didn’t take long to find what he’d been looking for; there, at the very edge of the field near a human settlement shone the bright blue soul Dean had raised from Hell. Pleased to find the human still so close the angel spread his wings and flew after him. Maybe spending some more time with the human would help things make sense; if nothing else it certainly couldn’t hurt, could it?
It was a question Gabe had no answer for. It was like his brain had gone offline somewhere along the ride and had yet to reboot itself. Deep down inside, it was fear that kept him in his seat, pure and simple. Even most likely dead he was too far afraid of Asmodeus to even get out and look at his body. “When did I turn into such a coward?” He sighed, gaze fixed out into the middle distance.
Awareness kicked in like someone had slapped Dean across the face. He opened his eyes wide, and to his horror, found he wasn’t tangled up by his sheets like he’d thought.
The club... just thinking about it made Gabriel shudder and he swore the temperature in the car dropped several degrees. Despite there being half a country between there and here and a year to dull the memories Gabriel still remembered it all in sharp clarity. The bulked up bouncer with sharp pointed teeth that screamed ‘vampire!’; the buxom dark haired woman who knew what she was doing as she led him down a dark hallway; the sinister smile of the man in the white suit who’d shown up just as Gabriel orgasmed… Shame burned hot and fast down his neck as he unwillingly remembered the way the man had screamed about him raping his best girl and the unorthodox deal that had followed. Bile rose up his throat as he remembered the things the man had made him do, had
Yet he didn’t look back. His gaze remained on the road ahead, peering out into the long, dark night. Between the fog and the dark there was nothing to see beyond oblivion. Gabriel shook his head, cursing himself a fool as he started the car again. Surely, whatever was out there was better than being stuck here with bad memories and a dead family. So he drove, uncaring of what could come forward compared to what he was leaving behind.
There was a pregnant pause as the first voice considered what they were going to do. Unconsciously Dean held his breath, waiting. He didn’t have the foggiest clue who they were talking about but he was curious despite himself.
After a moment Gadreel nodded, apparently satisfied. “Looks good.” He said to Castiel, his voice giving nothing away with it’s quiet calmness. He turned back to the doors behind him and pushed the closest one open and ushered them inside. “Have a fun time.”
Gabriel was curious as fuck, loath as he was to admit it. In addition to hunting and the wild shit he’d seen and done, the young hunter was no stranger when it came to sex. Though picking up women in the towns they visited on cases was a completely different thing from going to a specialized club, he was beginning to realize. The things one did at clubs like those were simply something he could only imagine and the possibilities were both arousing and terrifying in spades. It was one thing to love ‘em and leave ‘em the next day, but what if he screwed something up in the club? A place called The Inferno sounded ominous and the whole thing was very much fucking with Gabriel’s head in a way he didn’t like. “You’ve been in there before?” It was another question he’d already asked, but like the other he simply couldn’t help himself.
at them; he doesn’t want to know how bad it’d hurt to try touching them. He feels lightheaded and without conscious decision he finds himself sinking downwards. The cold hardness of the door frame and the coolness of the tiled floor against his bare butt register though to Dean though the sensations are distant. Muted.
Sam wondered as he stared at his brother’s phone. He couldn’t imagine what could have happened to his brother; Dean had seemed dopily happy with Castiel the last Sam had seen them. Castiel was, as far as Sam knew, okay. The man had been distracted at work earlier, fumbling through the simplest of lines, but he’d been there. Sam stepped away from the car, frowning. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and dialed. It was time to call for help.
It was a lie, and he knew it, but it was the convincing he needed.
He frowns and comes to a stop right there in the middle of the street. At first glance nothing seems amiss—it’s still on the early side and the neighborhood seems peaceful. In the distance Sam spots a large lump of fur on someone’s porch, probably someone’s pet dog, but it doesn’t appear to be in distress.
The entire world appears to have gone silent, holding onto baited breath.
“I--you--the fuck!” Sam spluttered, his face turning red in part to his rising anger. He couldn’t believe this! His brother was quite obviously injured, and he was lying to him to boot! “You’re impossible!” He finally huffed, pissed. “You aren’t fine! You can’t even stand up straight!”
She walks back over to Dean and crouches down beside him once more. Her hand goes out and comes to rest gently on his forehead. To her aggravation he’s burning up and not responding at all. “Dean?” She asks, loudly. “Open your eyes.” God, if he gets truly sick or something what are they going to do? The thought is like a douse of ice water on her previously warm feelings because it isn’t like they can just take him to the nearest ER.
Sadly, all that is just the tip of the iceberg as far as Dean’s injuries go. Sam was fairly sure he was being kept in the dark about most of them but he had a sick feeling it extended far beyond the identical bloodied bruising around his both of his brother’s wrists. The worst of it, in Sam’s opinion, is the large swath of bandages covering near the entirety of his brother’s neck on the left side. Sam hadn’t gotten to see what laid underneath those bandages though he had a pretty good idea and it painted a picture he didn’t want to think about, let alone see. Sam growled low in his throat; hackles raised as he envisioned what he’d do to the bastard alpha who dared harm Dean. Just from what he’d seen alone he was ready to tear the offending alpha limb from limb without thinking twice.
~*~*~
from the Pit. Not human, at least… Castiel shook his head, stalling that line of thought right there.
He’d been up less than two hours and already the day felt like it was going to last forever. Castiel had never imagined he’d see Dean again and so he certainly wasn’t prepared to wake up to find the angel right there in his hotel room, less than ten feet from his bed! To say it’d been a shock was an understatement, though it had nothing upon finding out that somewhere along the line his angel and his brother had gone and become BFFs! Castiel grit his teeth just reliving the memory:
Gabriel tightened his lips into a thin line, watching his reflection in the window do the same. Castiel was right--of course he was--but that didn’t make him feel any better about this. If anything it made him feel worse because deep down Gabriel wasn’t sure he could do this. Could he confront the man who tortured and raped him and manage to kill him? Considering the thought alone made bile crawl up his throat Gabriel certainly didn’t think so. Even with the reassurance from Dean, of whom they’d found out was actually a soldier, he wasn’t convinced. Asmoudeus seemed so much bigger, so much larger than life than all of them. How were they supposed to kill him?
There wasn’t much to see: two beds, one occupied by a deeply sleeping Castiel, the table and chair, two partially open duffel bags, and the general furnishings found in motel rooms everywhere. Dean took it all in as he headed to the chair as indicated and stiffly sat down. Now that he was here he didn’t know what to do with himself, Bobby had never covered what he was supposed to do if he found himself in the hunters motel room! From the adjoining room came the sound of running water before the door opened to reveal Gabriel. He’d taken off his jacket and changed into a simple t-shirt and plaid pajama pants. He looked tired and suddenly Dean knew what to do without being told.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just like that Dean felt all his complaints shrivel up and die in his throat. Mouthing off to Bobby was one thing; standing up to John was a different one. Namely, he could get away with the one and not the other. Dean sighed, resigned, and hung his head. He didn’t want to do this but it seemed like he was getting absolutely no say in the matter. “Kay,” He finally muttered at length, defeated. He just hoped he would be able to survive…
Dean's seriously considering the pros and cons of pissing in one of the sinks when it finally descends through his whiskey-addled brain that there’s three doors set into the back wall. Each one is black, and nearly blends in with the décor which is how he missed them in the first place, but that isn’t what distracts Dean. No, the signs upon each door labeled Alpha, Beta, Omega, does that. It’s a bit of a shock to see; Dean’s sure he could count on one hand the number of public restrooms he’s seen divided by sub-gender but honestly at this point he couldn’t care less. He’d happily piss in a bucket in full view of all the alpha’s if he could be rid of the painful pressure.
He thinks desperately as he listens to the jingle of Cas’ belt being undone.
Castiel shrugged again, seemingly unbothered by Dean’s mounting anger. “Aren’t you a joke?” He inquired, “That’s what I was led to believe at any rate by, well, everyone. Your co-workers, the crew members. Even that boy at the gas station that has an unhealthy obsession with you described as much! Tell me, Dean, what are you?” The alpha leaned forward, his eyes still locked to Dean’s. “You pretend you’re so high and mighty and act like everyone else is beneath you. Even your own kin agrees--Sam practically admitted as much the first day I met him!”
It was almost comical the way he slithered out of bed and got dressed in the dark. A laugh bubbled up unexpectedly as he realized he was acting just like a teenager in a sitcom trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night. Better late than never, he figured, having never had the opportunity to try it out himself. When he finally deemed himself ready he slunk his way to the door, only to pause at the threshold to glance back at his brother.
Dean opens his mouth only to shut it again without uttering a sound. It’s not that he doesn’t want to answer Sam but more that he feels . . . strange. Not quite right in a way he can’t explain. He lifts his head to look his brother in the eyes when he feels it--a sharp burning pain building on the left side of his neck. It’s directly over the spot where the mating bite is and Dean scrambles at the bandages that are covering the mark. It’s been healed for over a month now, yet he still keeps it covered so it can’t be seen. He’s regretting it now as he tears at the bandages with a frantic need for them to be off. The burning is getting worse, traveling up his neck. Distantly Dean can hear Sam calling his name and the sounds of sirens growing closer but he can’t care at the moment.
Sadly, it doesn’t help. Castiel’s hands shoot out and become two vices clamping onto Dean’s hips, restricting any further movement. Before Dean can protest, or wrap his mind around what’s happening here, he’s being bent forward at an awkward angle. “Cas!” He gasps as his face is shoved forward into the tiny space between the wall and the water pipes that connect to the urinal. “What the hell!?” Dean struggles but it’s futile; Castiel’s body has become a heavy weight behind him pinning him in place.
“Oh hey Sam!” The dark-haired beta gave a wave as he looked up from the comic he was reading. “It’s been pretty quiet around here.” He waved to indicate the empty store. “Though it’s still early I suppose. How’s your brother doing?”
It was dark by the time he reached the field but Dean paid it no mind. He could see perfectly well in the dark and ths had no problems seeing the large hole in the ground where he’d buried the human.
“Yep!” she popped the ‘P’ loudly. “I can show you pictures if you don’t believe me. It’s okay if you don’t, most don’t until they see at least the ring or pictures or both! And before you go worrying your pretty little head, yes I know all the details, and no, I don’t care.”
Speaking of moving...what was it? There in the distance, partially obscured by the smoke shone a beautiful blue light. Even at a distance it was beyond stunning, so shining and pure, Dean barely felt able to witness it. What could possibly shine like that? He wondered as he continued through the fray. Surely it wasn’t...was it? Dean mulled over the possibility for a split second before he made up his mind; no matter what it was he had to check it out. He fought like an angel possessed, using his sword and wings to keep the vile bastards at bay as he struggled his way towards it.
“Hello Dean.” Castiel said, calm as a cucumber. His rumbling voice sounded deeper in the stillness of the room and seemed to rattle against Dean’s very bones. “You left your door unlocked.” He continued like this was a normal conversation. “That’s not a wise thing to do, just think of who could come in, especially when you were in such a state!”
Her words were weighted and ominous; Sam felt a shiver run up his spine as he listened. “I don’t plan on going anywhere.” And that was the truth—Sam was determined to be so far up his brother’s butt he’d be calling him a suppository. Whether it was the look in his eyes or the ringing truth in his words, the nurse seemed to be appeased. While she didn’t come out and smile there was a twinkling look in her eyes as she regarded him. Whatever else she was going to say, however, was lost as the door to Dean’s room opened behind Sam.
The wind picked up causing Dean to shiver violently. The thin pajama pants, ratty hoodie, and worn out sneakers he’d woken up in had done little to deter the cold. Dean had learned that quite quick--Hannah had just barely left when Dean started shaking from the cold. That had been . . . fuck, he had no idea. It could have been yesterday for all that Dean knew. He didn’t think it’d been
“You--are you fuckin’ kidding me right now?!” Sam yelped, clearly not buying it and edging towards being pissed. “You look like you’ve got broken ribs and an impressive shiner and you want me to believe you ‘fell down the stairs’?” His voice rose in his hysteria. He looked Dean over with eyes wide as dinner plates. “What really happened?”
The downside to sleeping so much, as it turned out, was that Dean had no context for when something
“Why Gabriel, are you
“Psshhh! We’ll make time.” The hand not on Dean’s shoulder waves dismissively like it’s not Benny’s ass on the line alongside Dean’s the longer they drag things out. “Can’t send you off going hungry, can I? What kind of bodyguard would I be?”
you?” He spluttered, recoiling in fear as she touched him.
"You sure you're okay there, brother?" Benny asked as he worriedly hovered while Dean slowly sank down into the comfortable leather of the SVU's backseat. A small whimper escaped him as he settled; Dean hadn't wanted to look but he was about ninety percent sure his ass was one giant bruise after the way Cas had smacked it last night. He’d always enjoyed some pain with his sex, but this was, frankly, ridiculous. He hadn’t felt this bad after Cas had fucked him senseless after the beating last night but he was sure making up for lost time this morning!
He thought as he tried to force his eyes open. It takes time; the low light in the room is enough to send lightning bolts of pain stabbing through his skull but Dean eventually gets them open...and freezes.
“Hannah.” A quiet commanding voice pipes up from across the room, breaking through the sudden tense atmosphere. “Give him time to gather his wits. The doctor should be here shortly.”
He was here to help...him? That brought Gabriel up short, and caused his brow to furrow as he frowned. “Help me with what?” He asked, obviously confused. Surely the angel had the wrong person--Gabriel didn’t need any divine intervention!
His gaze scans the tag and it’s like the words unlock something in his brain. “I…know…you…” He manages to get out; the words little more than a rasp forced through his bone-dry throat. As fucked up as the whole situation is, and he suspects it’s even worse than he’s visualizing, it’s somewhat comforting to realize he knows someone here with him.
Part of Castiel had to admit the demon knew what it was doing with the way it made the women's hips sway enticingly. If he’d been a lesser man he could admit he’d probably have been taken in by the whole package…
And wait.
It wasn’t a nice sound, more like nails on a chalkboard that made Castiel flinch under the weight of it. “I’ve been waiting for you.” The woman said simply, shrugging like this wasn’t the most unusual interaction Castiel could lay claim to having. “I didn’t think you were ever going to get up!”
It’s not a surprise when Dean doesn’t answer her or make any moves towards getting up. Still Meg sighs anyway, resigned and heading towards exasperated. She doesn’t blame Dean--it isn’t his fault his body has gone completely haywire thanks to what her husband did but still. It’s a whole lot of unfair that she’s the one stuck cleaning up the mess (literally) while Castiel watches. “Okay.” She repeats, mostly to psych herself up as she moves in position. Dean doesn’t react when she grabs him, nor when she lifts him bodily off the floor.
Sam thinks, somewhat hysterically. It’s a terrible thing to think, yet it’s so true Sam can’t even begin to feel bad about it. Dean’s thin, unnaturally so, and dressed in a pair of ratty sweatpants and hoodie that look at least two sizes too big. God, he can’t believe it’s really him! There’s no mistaking it though; the sandy blonde locks plastered to the forehead, the jut of his jaw, the angle of his nose. Dean’s curled up into a fetal position, his arms wrapped tightly around his legs and he’s still issuing broken pained noises like he just can’t stop. He doesn’t seem aware that Sam’s even there, his eyes are tightly closed, and he doesn’t even twitch as Sam slowly uncovers more of him.
“Don’t give me that dirty diaper look Cassie!” Gabriel taunted, “I could hear you thinking all the way over there! You should be thanking me for breaking you out of your funk!” He crossed his arms over his chest in a way he’d definitely gotten from their mother as he waited to see what Castiel would reply. It was a move that always drove Castiel absolutely crazy and he knew it--a fact proven when one eyebrow raised in challenge.
the one who went off with Balthazar and didn’t even bother letting me know where you were or anything! I thought you’d found yourselves another hunt and then Balth came crashing in and led me to your corpse! How do you think that went!?” Castiel’s voice was rising in volume and he was fairly sure it was starting to echo since the car door was still wide open but he didn’t care. He was so furious he didn’t give a damn if the whole world heard him chew Gabriel out; his brother deserved it!
The burning is growing more and more and more. It radiates outwards like a burning forest fire out of control, unstoppable. He finally rips the last of the bandages off with a strangled cry, horrified to see the blood soaking into the white cloth. Dean clutches his neck, a howl building in his throat as the pain threatens to overwhelm him. The last thought he has before his eyes roll up in his head is the nurses at the hospital were right. The old wives tales really are true--Castiel’s dead and Dean will suffer despite not being the one who pulled the trigger.
Dean shrugged, managing to make the motion look awkward and stiff as he did so. Even so, a secretive smile crossed his face as he preened, pleased that the hunter had noticed. “No need to drag everyone in on a private conversation.” He said easily, giving the human a look daring him to challenge it. He may not know much but Dean knew enough that one didn’t go discussing demons around humans all willy-nilly.
him. Claiming him in a way Dean wants no part of.
He thought as he drew his legs in anyway, curling up into a ball the best he could.
want to witness that! “P-p-ple-eeease!” He gasped out, his words muffled by the tears that were flowing hot and fast down his face.

Taking a second to roll his eyes at himself and his fit of childishness Gabriel turned to face Balthazar. “Okay,” He said, caught somewhere between resigned and willing to do it. “Let’s do this.” The ‘
Over where Alfie couldn’t see him well, Sam smirked as he filled his cup with coffee. It was no big secret to anyone aside from Dean’s completely obliviousness that Alfie had quite the crush on his big brother. Sam found it cute, himself. There was a bit of a gap, age wise, but he could see it working if Dean ever got his head out of his ass. “I don’t really know,” he replied, craning his neck to look over the shelves at the counter. “I haven’t talked to him this week. I know he called the other day and asked Bobby for some time off so I figured he was just taking a vacation, you know?”
?!” Gabriel floundered, opening and closing his mouth like a fish before finally snapping it shut. He shook his head, clearly overwhelmed and suddenly beyond exhausted. A yawn slipped out, proving how tired he really was before he finally shrugged in resignation. It wasn’t like there was any point in debating with the angel anyway seeing as they were already here. “Warn a guy first next time!” He muttered as he headed towards the door Dean had indicated, fishing the key out of his pocket as he went. “You coming in?”
He startles, turning as much as he can to blink up at her slowly. “A bath?” He mumbled, still more asleep than awake. Despite that, he does have to admit the offer is more than tempting. He hasn’t had a bath since he woke up here, bound as he is. Finally, he nods in agreement. “Okay.”
Bile clawed up his throat cutting off any words he may have said. Swallowing hard he shook his head and slowly rose the rest of the way to his feet.
He hits the back hall at a dead run, finally past the point of caring if anyone sees, and judges him, cause fuck them. He bursts through the men’s room door, hands already fumbling with his zipper only to come to an ungraceful skidding halt just inside the doors. “The fuck?” He mumbles, far too drunk and desperate to fully process what he’s seeing, or rather
“How about another bath? Hmm?” She hummed as she focused her attention back onto Dean. The poor omega certainly needed one: he was still covered in blood and semen from Castiel’s earlier visit and had been sweating like a pig ever since. Not to mention he stunk to literal high hell from the distressed pheromones and slick that was coming off, and out of his body thanks to the heat. It had taken all of Meg’s faux acting skills just to keep from wrinkling her nose at the combined odor. “I’ll make it a cool bath this time, what do you say?”
— “Dean?” Castiel’s deep rumble breaks into his thoughts suddenly leaving the omega blinking in surprise.  Whoops! There he went again, losing his damned mind all because of Castiel… Dean coughed feeling the tell-tale flush of embarrassment spreading hot across his face and neck. He’s suddenly grateful that they chose to wait until later to go because the dim light as the sun fades away is now working in his favor.
As a general rule angels didn’t panic. They were built to receive orders and mindlessly obey, not to worry or fret or panic like their father’s creation did. Dean, on the other hand, had always been a bit different compared to his brethren. He obeyed and followed orders with the best of them but deep down in his being he had...questions. It was a sensation Dean lacked the words to describe, and the knowledge to properly question. Who was he to question things anyway? He was a mere foot soldier, programmed to obey and follow orders from his superiors...the same superiors who had summoned him to God’s throne room.
Dean thinks dully, feeling oddly detached from the situation suddenly.
him to do. It’d been beyond humiliating and all Gabriel had wanted to do was die. Then came the torture and Gabriel was sure he was going to die...and then…
Gabriel’s face hardened though the look in his eyes was nothing short of haunted. He didn’t say anything for several long seconds and the sudden silence between them was suffocating. “Believe me when I say you don’t want to know.” He finally said at last in a broken quiet voice that Castiel had never heard before. “I’m serious Castiel; you really don’t want to know.”
For Sam, running had always been a calming activity—it was a way to drop all the stress of the world for a while and just
“He killed you.” Dean said quietly, meeting Gabriel’s gaze head on, his borrowed face a careful mask. “That’s why Bobby sent me here to help you stop him, before he does something similar to someone else.” He paused, eyeing Gabriel for any indication of objection, and upon finding none, he went on. “I know I don’t seem like much and all but Bobby’s rarely wrong. I know you don’t believe me but if he says we can defeat Asmodeus together then I believe him.”
“Didn’t have a--” The first voice sounded mortified. “Are you kidding me right now? Of course you had a choice! You could have left! Called the cops! Not went along with
, he thinks, feeling caught off guard and not liking it.
Now that the excitement was over, or so it seemed to Dean, he tuned out the actual words and just let their tones wash over him. They were quieter now and Dean didn’t resist as they pulled him back under into the welcome arms of sleep.
It was a cowardly move, Dean thought as he drifted back towards the Earth, but he couldn’t be roused to care. Doing a job well that he hadn’t particularly wanted in the first place was one thing but the reception he’d just gotten was absurd. So he’d saved a human, so what? It wasn’t like it changed anything, at least nothing Dean could see. Despite that Dean found himself flying back to the area where he’d buried the human. He hadn’t intended to return but since going back home wasn’t an option at the moment, why not?
Chapter Warning: This chapter contains one of the character's making a demon deal at the crossroads to sell their soul.
That was a question Dean had not been expecting, and he blinked a few times as he considered it. “I suppose they could have sent in the garrison.” He finally said at last, his tone thoughtful. “It certainly would make things much easier from a logistical standpoint.”
Chapter warning: This chapter contains non-con and rape (off screen). Also contains depictions of being buried alive/Castiel digging his way out of his coffin.
“He’s still rather warm.” Hannah replies as one of their hands drifts down to gently rest on Dean’s forehead. He makes a pleased sound though his eyes remain closed. “Are you sure he’s going to be able to handle it out there on his own?”
selfish for saving your ass?
He sighed loudly, eyes tracking the way his breath puffed out in front of him like smoke. He looked both ways up and down the street, though he needn’t have bothered. This early in the morning most of the residents had already left for work or were happily sleeping in. Sam wished he was one of the latter. Picking a direction at random, he took off down a side street, barely paying any attention as he ran. His music pounded through the earbuds nestled in his ears, the heavy upbeat pop tunes a good counter to the way his feet hit the pavement. He needed to stop dwelling; Sam knew. All he was doing was running himself crazy thinking about Dean and it wasn’t doing anyone a lick of good. He’d gotten snappy and irritable and had very nearly come to blows with Ruby a few nights ago because he couldn’t contain his temper any longer. Sam’s going out and running had been her idea…though Sam couldn’t escape the hot flush of embarrassment as he recalled the way her ‘suggestion’ had come with a barely veiled threat. He didn’t like to think that he was one of those ‘cowed’ alphas that bowed down to whatever their omegas wanted, but Sam knew the truth. He was well and truly whipped and there was no other way he’d have rather been.
He thought as he let himself go.
By the time it’s over Dean’s sure he’s dying. Everything hurts worse than before and to his horror he finds somewhere along the line he started to cry. It isn’t helping with the whole breathing thing but he can’t make himself stop either. It’s the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back and just like that all the fight goes out of Dean. He goes lax in his bonds and simply sobs.
“How the fuck did I miss
satisfying about watching an omega squirm underneath him. The rapidly darkening bruises painted Dean’s pale form like a canvas of Castiel’s own making and he felt like he could come just from the sight alone. He exhaled dreamily and reached down to grab Dean’s pathetically flaccid cock with one hand. He squeezed and pulled cruelly, loving the way Dean keened under him. Oh yes, this was perfect! “What’s the matter?” He cooed in mock sweetness as he continued his assault. “Aren’t you enjoying having your cock played with? You told me how much you enjoyed it!”
?” He hissed, and suddenly his weight on top of Dean increased ten-fold as he pressed down on Dean. “You don’t get to make the rules here!” Castiel snarled right into Dean’s ear. “I am the one in charge! NOT you!” With no warning whatsoever he reared back and took a swing at Dean’s head. His fist collided perfectly with the side of the omega’s jaw and the resulting whimper was music to his ears. “You would do well not to disrespect me in my own home!”
Across the table Gabriel shuddered and held up a hand. “Don’t!” He ground out, before looking up to meet Dean’s eyes. “Can you not toss his name out like that?” This whole thing was bad enough but Gabriel knew he wasn’t going to get through it if he had to keep hearing the demon’s name over and over. “No offense, but shouldn’t they have sent an army or something?”
“Ow! Son of a bitch!” Dean groaned as he was kicked in the ribs by one of Castiel’s feet. Certainly struggling on the ground wasn’t all that Hollywood made it out to be considering the way he was getting battered. He grunted and cursed and proceeded to bite and scratch back any part he could reach. “I’m trying!” He cried out as Castiel got in a particularly hard scratch down the side of his face. He could see it but reaching it wasn’t going to be easy.
? It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate being tossed out of Hell, but why had they let him loose? Neither he nor Gabriel had found anything in their feverish searching on demon contracts hinted at anyone coming
. . . And speaking of brothers. . . Against his will Gabriel found his eyes sliding back to the edge of the road, and sure enough, standing there where his parents had been stood Gabriel and Castiel’s two eldest brothers. Fraternal twins, Michael and Lucifer made up for their lack of sameness with matching disproving scowls that would have made their mother proud. Gabriel froze, feeling very much like a rat caught in a trap by two overly eager cats. Michael and Lucifer had been competitive bastards in life with everything from the football field to battling one another for their parents affections. Gabriel supposed the correct term nowadays would be ‘fighting like cats and dogs’ but with twin looks of revolusion heading his way all he felt was fear. It was ridiculous, especially considering Gabriel was now older than the twins had been when they were killed, but still, some memories never died. The twisted barbs, the beatings that their parents never seemed to notice… Gabriel shuddered under the weight of the recall, and turned his head away. Of all the horrors he’d witnessed, all the things he’d seen during his years of hunting, seeing his brothers again was a sight he didn’t need. The thought made his chest pulse, though with sympathy or something else, he didn’t know.
Dean winced, cowed. With everything that had happened afterwards Dean had completely forgotten about his call to Bobby. He’d only intended to take a day or so off not...however long it’d been now. Bobby had to be beyond pissed; Dean frowned as he pictured it. If he were anyone else, in any other kind of job his ass would have been fired for sure. “They don’t even miss me, do they.” It wasn’t a question--Dean already had a good idea of the answer.
Dean paused, giving Benny a thoughtful once-over as he pretended to think about it. “I dunno,” he finally said, doing far better at keeping himself in check than Benny. “You’d probably have to lose the beard and the ‘tude at the very least, but yeah. I can picture it.”
Thanks to the bathroom lights Dean can make out why his hips are hurting as bad as they are—the clear light of small bruising circling them makes it perfectly clear. Cas’ fingerprints, he realizes with dawning horror as he stares at the deep purple blobs. He moves closer into the room, to the mirror, despite himself. Bile crawls up his throat as his heart ramps up double time in his chest. What the actual fuck? Dean’s always liked a bit of pain with his sex, it ain’t like he’s tried to hide it, but this? This is something completely different. It’s night and day and he doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry or be sick about it. The bruising extends down both his legs, growing larger and more pronounced as his eyes trail the purple-black blobs downwards.
“The hell?” Gabriel exclaimed as he moved away instinctively from Dean. He blinked at the parking lot like he’d never seen it before as he tried to wrap his head around just what the hell had happened. “How did you do that?” He asked, a slight note of hysteria in his voice as he rounded on Dean. “What did you do?”
“Look at you! So gorgeous!” A familiar gravelly voice purrs from the vicinity of the doorway causing goosebumps to rise and Dean’s heart to sink because he knows that voice: “Cas.” He chokes through a throat that’s suddenly gone bone-dry. While Dean never considered himself a prude, he’s mighty uncomfortable; his shoulders have come up around his ears and his back is a hard line of tension where he’s automatically curled forward.
“Sir!” A stern voice sharply cuts through his little daydream, bringing Sam back down to reality. He startles, cutting off mid-growl to find the head nurse for the unit standing a few feet away. The woman was dark skinned and older than most of the other nurses Sam had seen thus far though the way she was eyeing him made it clear she wasn’t one to mess around with. “Boy, if you can’t control yourself I’ll toss you out of here!” She warned, her tone brooking no argument.
be! The eyes could deceive you, Castiel knew. He’d seen, or rather thought he’d seen, enough things growing up hunting to know one couldn’t fully trust what they were seeing in front of him. Denial didn’t make his brother sit up and yell “Gotcha!” however, no matter how much Castiel wished it to be so.
Gabriel froze, clearly recalling the brightly lit staircase that should have been there but he was too late--before he could turn to tell his companions it was a trap something hard and deadly fast swung out of the darkness and cracked him right in the head. Gabriel crumpled and went down hard to the sounds of his name being called from somewhere far away... Things devolved into confusion fast as Castiel and Dean went running and the lights clicked on somewhere down below revealing the brightly lit staircase and a bearded man with dark hair and a blood-splattered white suit standing there behind Gabriel’s collapsed body.
Ten minutes later Sam’s on his way back with his music off and earbuds dangling, huffing along at a nice leisurely pace when he hears it: a low pitiful moaning that sounds like a wounded animal.
That was the whole thing right there, wasn’t it? The angel talked a good game, or well, he sounded good at the least, but how would he do when faced with Asmodeus himself? The better question was how would
And how fucked was that? Asmodeus had spent
He hummed, not wanting to open his eyes. As long as he didn’t he could believe it was true whether or not it actually was. Sadly his peace was shattered when an unfamiliar female voice spoke up somewhere near his left side: “Rise and shine sunshine!”
He whined, lowering the bag as he slowly made his way into the room. “You two couldn’t have waited until later? You knew I was coming back!” He huffed out a dramatic sigh as he crossed the room to the small table and chairs in the corner, carefully not meeting either one of their eyes. If he did it’d be game over, for Gabriel sucked at keeping a straight face, especially when he was as pleased as he was now. It was a little weird to know his brother was hooking up with an angel but Gabriel found he was getting used to it. The week spent in the hospital as they recovered from the incident at the Inferno had opened his eyes to a lot of things, most notably the way Dean and Castiel gravitated towards one another like they were the only two in the world. It was fascinating and disgusting in the way young love often was and Gabriel was all down for it--just not when it was impacting his mealtimes.
For his part Dean just watched him placidly, letting Gabriel draw his only conclusions before he finally tossed the guy a bone and nodded his head. “Angels take vessels just like demons do.” He said, sounding just as matter of fact as if he was talking about the weather and not the fact he was possessing a living person. “The difference is angels require consent to take someone as a vessel; demons don’t.” He paused, obviously listening to something he alone could hear before he suddenly smiled. “My vessel--Matt--says to tell you he became a vessel willingly if that helps.”
~*~*~
He simply moans, fever-glazed eyes rolling to look up at her pitifully. For all intents and purposes he feels like complete and utter dog shit. His body is burning hot on the inside for release it just can’t find while the outside has been thoroughly battered thanks to Castiel. Dean whimpers again at just thinking of the alpha’s name. Slick drips out of his hole as he clenches and moans, torn between wishing Castiel was there to ease his pain and never wanting to see the alpha again. He doesn’t know how Meg can stand it--the bathroom feels like it must be a million degrees and stinks to high heaven of sickly sweet distressed omega in heat.
There, leaning across the wall from the bed (and when did he get back in bed?) is none other than Castiel Novak himself. The alpha is a sight for tired, and watery eyes. He looks almost as tired as Dean feels--there’s dark smudges under his eyes and his perpetual messy dark hair looks like he’s been running his hand through it. He’s dressed normal in a pair of faded, ripped jeans and an equally faded green Mt. Dew t-shirt. He looks good and despite the situation he’s in Dean finds himself licking his lips in appreciation. “Hello Dean.” The alpha rumbles.
To Dean's profound relief there didn't seem to be any snakes, at least none that he could see. But was the room getting hazy? Confused, Dean lifted his head and looked around the room, startled to see a fog like mist seeping out of the small vent fixed high on the wall near the bathroom door. "The fuck is that!?" He yelped but it was already too late: the mist quickly covered the room in a thick blanket of hazy white. Dean coughed, eyes watering. He dropped to the floor in a crouch but it didn't help. His head and vision swam in tandem as he felt his body slip sideways towards the floor. A familiar deep chuckle vibrated through his bones, following him down into the deep.
It feels like a blink of an eye passes—one moment Dean’s drifting in a not-quite-asleep haze and the next he’s blinking a shocking bright light out of his eyes and grumbling incoherently at whatever the source is.
the man standing there. It was impossible, beyond it even, as he whispered out a broken: "Dad?"
Castiel thinks and gives in, letting his alpha side take control. He leans in and captures Dean’s lips in a heated kiss. The omega is unresistant, frozen underneath him and it makes Castiel hunger for him even more. “You’re mine.” He growls out, eyes ringed in red and full of possessiveness. “I’m going to make sure everyone who lays eyes upon you knows it.”
Just as predicted he’s right where she left him. His eyes have slipped closed and to her relief, he doesn’t seem to be dry humping the floor anymore. In fact the omega is laying there completely lax like he’s completely given up. Despite knowing what Castiel ultimately has planned for him Meg can’t help the surge of compassion she feels towards Dean. He’s been so different from all the other omega’s they’ve taken over the years. It’s been, well, nice, if Meg says so. Not for the first time she wishes that she could keep him forever. She frowns briefly--it’s there and gone again in a second as she shoves the conflicting feelings down. Like it or not she can’t keep Dean so there’s little point in hoping...besides Dean needs her help now.
Sam ended his search in the garage, frowning at the silent sight of the Impala parked there. “Where’s Dean?” He asked the car like it was actually capable of answering back. Nothing in the house had looked disturbed and Sam didn’t know what bothered him more, that, or the fact the impala was still there. He circled the car slowly, frowning when he found the keys to it still hanging out of the ignition.
who’s been missing for months now! Sam stands frozen, one hand clamped down tightly on the corner of the tarp, shocked. He doesn’t know whether to laugh or scream for help or cry. In the end he doesn’t do any of them, just remains standing and stares down at his brother with wide, wet eyes.
Above him, Meg pauses in her petting to glare up at the pinhole sized camera lens she knows is nestled in the corner near the ceiling. It’s positioned to show the entirety of the bathroom, and thus has a great view of Dean’s suffering. Meg glares at it angrily, a bit of her heart going out to Dean’s distress despite herself. She knows Castiel is no doubt watching from the safety of their bedroom across the house and she wants him to get a good look. “Help him!” She mouths wordlessly, angrily, despite knowing Castiel won’t. He’d made his views on it quite clear when he’d finally came stumbling back to their room last night.
For his part Benny simply shakes his head, amazed and saddened as he watches Dean go. It’s obvious to him the omega is still hurting, still feeling the after-effects of his heat, yet there’s little he can do to help. As a beta his naturally calming scent helps—that was part of the reason he broke protocol to sit beside Dean for a while—yet the older man can’t help the way his heart clenches at seeing his friend suffer. It’s been this way for years now, practically ever since they met, yet it bothers him every single time. He looks skyward, momentarily ignoring Dean, and sends up a quick prayer to whoever might be listening that an alpha would come along who could properly help Dean. The omega wouldn’t thank him for it, had he known, but Benny supposed what he didn’t know couldn’t hurt him. It wasn’t likely such a prayer would be answered anyhow—Dean was far too stubborn for that.
He squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to see. Finally he dared to peek...and immediately wished he hadn’t. Wrapped around the delicate skin of his ankle was a solid steel cuff attached to an equally solid looking chain. Dean swore, his voice barely audible as he slowly moved his leg in closer to the rest of his body. Up close the cuff was worse than he thought--it was roughly five inches wide and there was no keyhole or any way to remove it that Dean could see. He gulped, feeling the hot swell of tears building behind his eyes.

If Castiel had felt flat-footed before it was nothing compared to the shock running through him now. “...Was that meant as a flirtation?” He grumbled, hating the way he could feel his face flame. Nobody had said anything about demons flirting during their deal making!
“Please?” Castiel mocked as he gave Dean’s cock a hard twist and drank in the deep screaming sob that tore from Dean’s throat as a result. “You’re so pathetic!” He declared as he finally let go of the abused organ. “I truly don’t know what I saw in you in the first place!” He huffed, seemingly offended. He leaned down until he was eye to eye with Dean, his gaze hard and cold as ice. “For your sake I hope you learn from this lesson.” Then he straightens and delivers one final hit to Dean’s skull, effectively knocking the omega out cold.

So what’s she doing here then? Meg wishes she knew. Sighing quietly she watches the steady rise and fall of Dean’s body as he slips off into sleep. She picks up the bowl and rises fluidly to her feet. “I’ll try again later.” She whispers, not wanting to wake him.
Luckily for him the motel was located on the fringes of a small town and within minutes Gabriel found himself walking along a darkened street. At first glance the place seemed to be one of those everything-shuts-down-at-nine p.m. types of places considering everything he passed was closed. Not that there was much: an old-styled brick bank, a towering court house, and a smattering of small businesses ranging from a laundromat to one of those hipster cafes that seemed to be everywhere nowadays. Gabriel rolled his eyes at the kitschy name--Brew HA HA!--as he passed, though if given the choice he definitely could have gone for some coffee about now. Sadly, the place was as closed as the rest of them, dark and decidedly empty. Shrugging his shoulders in defeat, Gabriel continued on his way.
“Beer glazed meatballs?” Dean parroted, perking up in interest. The surest way to get him to go along with anything was to involve food. Dean had always loved to eat even from when he was a young pup and he loved finding new things to try. “Sounds like a good plan to me!” Suddenly the thought of going to a bar/club sounded way more appealing.
Castiel whirled, nearly face-planting back into the dirt from his stiff legs, shocked to find a woman standing not three feet away from him. How long had she been standing there? He hadn’t heard anyone come up behind him! Then her words sunk in and left him gaping in confusion, “About time?” He parroted, caught flat-foot about this whole ordeal thus far.
The alpha took several deep breaths, each one deeper than the last as he inhaled the amazing scent of scared omega. It was like liquid fire in his veins and he soaked it up for all that it was worth.
“Y-yeah?” Sam chokes out. He shakes his head, forcing himself to snap out of it. “You okay?” He asks as he moves in closer wanting to see for his own eyes that Dean’s safe.
Sleep must have claimed him for the next time Dean opened his eyes the sky was starting to lighten with the coming dawn. Feeling more than half frozen he slowly uncurls himself from the dumpster and makes to stand. To his profound relief he doesn’t feel as shaky as he did the night before as he slowly makes his way to the mouth of the alley. Dean stops before he reaches the opening, however, and stares, dumbstruck. The world had awoken while he was sleeping apparently for where there was no one around the night before the streets are now alive with people.
Then another.
Wait. What? Was he hearing that right? Dean simply blinked, dumbfounded and at a complete loss of words because, seriously? He was the right angel for some job? He found his head lifting on its own, his disbelieving stare swinging from one face to the other because surely this was a joke. Nobody, and he meant
He thinks as he turns, completing the small circuit he started outside the doorway, and comes to a stop just off to the right side. They had allowed him into the room earlier, but he’d been pushed out several minutes ago by some of the nurses so they could get Dean cleaned up. Sam didn’t really get it since Dean looked like he’d been cleaned thoroughly before being brought into the room, but who was he to argue? Besides, if he angled himself just right he could still see what was going on to an extent. He did so now, feeling smug as he caught a glimpse of Dean’s face. It wasn’t the best view since the nurses had closed the curtains surrounding the bed as well but there’s just enough of a gap that Sam could get a fleeting look inside.
Hours passed and it just grew colder. The night seemed to deepen around Dean as he began stumbling more and more. He was sure he was walking in circles but since he couldn’t remember where he started or where he was headed he couldn’t make himself stop. All the streets look the same with the same empty buildings bearing down on him. It felt like suffocating. Dean continued to wander around and around until he felt on the verge of collapse. The thought terrifies him--what if he fell again? What if he broke his other arm? Or worse, his leg? The thought no sooner crossed his mind when he stumbled yet again. Swearing, he managed to catch himself before he hit the ground but it was a close thing. This settled it: he needed to rest, but where?
“Sounds good,” Dean said. A drink right about now sounded like a
Dean’s brother always seemed to know what to do, he’d surely know how to help him. Hell, just one hug from the giant moose would warm him up! Dean couldn’t help the smile that tugged on the corners of his mouth as he imagined it and of course that was when everything went (more) to hell. He stumbled over an unseen crack in the sidewalk and went sprawling. With nothing there to catch him Dean went down hard. A sharp *crack!* split the air seconds before pain spiked up Dean’s right arm. Nausea followed on its heels and he lost the next few minutes dry retching into the night.

It’s the middle of the night by the time Dean finally surfaces from the depths of unconsciousness. 3:19 a.m. the bedside clock reads, the glowing green numbers the only light in the otherwise dark room. For a while Dean’s simply content to lay there, taking stock of himself.
“Dean.” The alpha says, his voice barely more than a gravely gargle. There’s blood leaking from his mouth to match all the blood that’s seeped into his shirt. His hands are pressed against his stomach where the gun must have gone off but even as Dean watches blood wells up underneath Castiel’s fingers. “Dean.” He repeats, voice thicker.
Sam thought, hackles raised as he pulled his phone from his pocket. He dialed Dean’s number, hoping beyond hope that his brother would answer. It’d barely rang three times when Sam heard it: the muffled sounds of Led Zeppelin's ‘Ramble On’ coming from inside the car. Yanking open the driver’s side door Sam’s heart sunk down into his feet at the sight of his brother’s phone partially sticking out from underneath the seat. The terrible feelings he’d been trying to repress came rushing to the forefront of his mind as Sam realized he couldn’t ignore it anymore: something terrible had happened to Dean.
He knelt at the edge of the open grave that he had pulled the soul’s body from and examined it for a long moment. He didn’t like this part but it had to be done according to the plan he’d been told before they had set off for Hell. With a snap of his fingers the dismantled wooden coffin snapped back together, perfectly whole at the bottom of the grave. Dean frowned at it, not liking one bit of what he had to do. Wouldn’t it be simpler for the human to wake with the open sky above him? The field they were in was beautiful by any of his father’s standards; a bright blue sky, a shining sky, barely a cloud in the sky. There were the sounds of birdsong and insects in the air; all in all it was perfectly peaceful.
Dean knows, somewhere deep in his mind, what’s going to happen before it does. Part of him has been hyper aware while the rest of him has been drifting on the wave of drugs. He feels, more than sees, Castiel pull away. The sounds of a zipper being pulled down and Castiel’s near-pornographic moan make Dean’s heart kick into high gear yet he reigns himself in at the last moment. Maybe if he’s quiet enough,
“C’mon bud, it’s time to go home.” He murmured, surprisingly gentle as he reached down and scooped the soul up. The soul shook and shuddered under his hands, no doubt expecting hurt to come to it like what had happened so many times before. Dean shushed it, his hands gentle as he lowered it down towards the waiting body. He hoped he had done it justice; he’d used the soul’s memories to build the body correctly and he was fairly sure he’d gotten everything correct. At least he certainly hoped so; humans had some rather strange appendages that left the angel unsure. Still, no time like the present!
Unlike the rest of them which had been painted deep red the final door was an ominous black and it led straight down to the basement. If there was one place Asmodeus would be, it’d be there. Sweat had broken out on Gabriel’s neck and forehead as he looked at the door, remembering the last time he’d been confronted with it. He’d been half delirious with pain and beat to hell but he vividly remembered the way the matte black paint seemed to be a void opening in front him, like a monster with its jaw unhinged ready to devour his soul. He shuddered and stuffed the fear back down with effort before he slowly reached out for the handle. Just like last time it opened on soundless hinges as it swung inward revealing nothing but more darkness beyond.
For a time he simply lay there, panting as he struggled to catch his breath in the early evening breeze. He’d gotten enough of a look at his surroundings to know he was in a field but the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ of it all was the furthest thing from his mind at the moment. It was a silly, naive thing, but he was strangely proud of himself. He’d gotten himself free; but now what? The question lingered as he caught his breath, his desperate panting slowing to something approaching normal.
He’d just finished deciding when the waitress bustled out of the back, and having spotted him, came harrying over. The waitress was young with dark eyes and bright blue dyed hair that's been pulled back into a messy bun. She looked about as tired as Gabriel felt, though she managed to give him a smile nonetheless. “What can I get you?”
Somewhere along the line of his thoughts he’d picked a direction at random and began walking, oblivious to the world around him. How long had he been gone? Was the next thought to pop up and the realization that it could have been a decade or more made Castiel freeze in his tracks. What if too much time had passed and Gabriel was old and grey now, living out the rest of his life in a nursing home somewhere? Or, what if Gabriel had gotten jumped on a hunt since Castiel hadn’t been there to watch his back and he was dead now? The thought made Castiel run cold as he realized how very screwed he’d be if Gabriel was indeed dead. He currently had nothing in his name; no wallet, though the credit cards inside it were probably expired anyway, and no clothes beyond the ones currently on his back. That had him looking down at himself, frowning at the dirt covered jeans and white shirt he was wearing. There was no blood, he noted absently, which meant Gabriel had redressed him before planting him. The thought bothered him more than he thought it should’ve as he stood there shivering in the warm evening air.
Once he has it in his arm Dean doesn’t waste any time. He books it out of the yard and down the street as fast as his wobbling legs will carry him. It isn’t until he’s an entire street over that he finally gives in and wraps himself up in the tarp. While it doesn’t provide any warmth it stops the chill from biting through his clothes and it’s enough of a relief Dean nearly cries from it.
He supposed as he shrugged off his coat on autopilot. He moved towards the kitchen automatically, wishing he had thought about keeping the cup of ice Garth had gotten him, or at the very least the drink. He hadn’t managed more than a few sips of it but the icy coldness had felt wonderful against his raw throat.
Needless to say by the time Bobby called cut for the day Sam was more than ready to hit the road. He wasted no time in going back to his trailer to get out of his costume and back into his street clothes. From the time he got dressed to the time he reached his car he’d left two new messages on his brother’s phone and was very nearly ready to scream from sheer frustration. Channeling it into usefulness he put his foot down on the gas and sped off. It was nothing short of a miracle that Sam didn’t get stopped for a speeding ticket on his way to Dean’s for as fast as he drove. The house, when he arrived, was dark. There wasn’t a light to be seen anywhere and more than anything else that set the alarm bells ringing in Sam’s head as he parked and got out of the car.
“It looks closed.” Dean spoke up for the first time since they’d left the car. He looked unruffled as he always did but the way his gaze slowly traveled around the mouth of the alley proved otherwise. There was a frown on his face, indicating he didn’t like whatever he was sensing. Castiel looked down the alley as well but he didn’t see anything and gave it up as angelic abilities. “What is it?” He asked, unable to help himself.
Wait. What? Back the fuck up! Castiel blinked, anger flipping a switch inside as he pulled back just far enough to look his older brother in the eyes. “Selfish?
...Until suddenly there was a sharp *CRACK!* that echoed loudly throughout the small box. It made Castiel’s ears ring and he was sure his hands were bleeding but he hardly cared because his work had paid off: the hole had grown bigger and dirt was pouring in more and more. Castiel didn’t know what lay on the other side but surely it had to be better than the situation he was currently stuck in. He didn’t need to think twice: he reached up and began to dig.
Thankfully for him, Castiel wouldn’t have to resort to such measures as the hotel door flung wide open. It rebounded, but the person who’d opened it was too fast---Castiel got a glimpse of blood and familiar eyes before the driver’s side door was being flung open as well. “Please tell me you didn’t do what I think you did!” Gabriel growled lowly, viciously pissed. He didn’t even wait for a reply before he was wrapping his arms around his little brother and clinging to him tightly like he’d disappear before his eyes.
“Dean? Are you okay?” A voice asked from behind his right shoulder, successfully snapping Dean back into the present. He glanced over his shoulder to see Sam, his (arguably) favorite brother giving him a knowing look. Though Dean was technically older than Sam he’d never been able to hide anything from the younger angel. Generally it was an annoying trait, because who actively enjoyed hanging around someone who could read you like a book?, but right now he was grateful for it. Though there was absolutely nothing okay about any of this, Dean or otherwise, he mustered up a shaky grin. It wouldn’t do any good to break down now, and since none of them were getting out of here, the only way to go was through. “I’m fine.” He reassured his second even as he was grasping for courage he didn’t necessarily feel. He’d heard a human phrase once about ‘faking it ‘til you made it’ and while he was fairly sure it wasn’t for something as serious as laying siege to Hell, Dean clung to it. Who knew, maybe if he believed it long enough they could actually pull this insane idea off.
Castiel closed his eyes against the sudden rush of pain surging through him at the demon’s words. He’d foolishly hoped there’d be some way to break the contract before his time came due but that was no longer an option now. He gave himself five long seconds to mourn the life he was willingly throwing away before he opened his eyes again. Meeting the demon’s fiery red gaze again he finally surrendered. Before he could let himself think about what he was doing Castiel found himself kissing the demon full on the lips. It was a filthy kiss; it tasted like sulphur and death, but Castiel gave as good as he got, making it battle for every inch of dominance. It was stupid considering he’d sealed his fate as surely as they sealed their lips but he’d never been one to back down.
It was so cold. . . Dean thought miserably as he slowly stumbled his way down the dark street. His whole body felt like lead, every step seemed harder than the last. His feet drug, catching alongside every crack in the pavement. He had no idea where he was or even where he was supposed to go. Casting back he vaguely recalled a warm car and Hannah saying something about Sam but everything else was a blur. Most things had been that way since he’d woken--there were large gaps in between moments Dean had little to no context for. Like now. Was Sam out here somewhere? Was he waiting for Dean? It didn’t make sense in Dean’s foggy mind. Did Hannah even know who his brother was? And if they did then surely Sam would have found him by now, wouldn’t he? Dean squinted through the dark but it was impossible to see much beyond his own face. The landscape of empty dark buildings surrounding him seemed to stretch on endlessly leaving Dean feeling more confused than before. He didn’t have a clue as to what time it was but it had to be late given he seemed to be the only one out.
Dean wanders like that for a while, until exhaustion finally catches up with him. It hits him all at once with the fineness of being hit in the head with a hammer and sends him stumbling. He makes it all of two steps before he trips over his own feet and goes down. It hurts but unlike last time nothing appears to be broken. Still, he can’t get back up. Exhaustion sinks its teeth into him and doesn’t let go. Too tired to fight it, Dean does what anyone would in his position--he pulls the tarp over him and curls up. He’s tired and hurting and just wants to rest. Surely a few minutes can’t hurt, right?
Just because he didn’t attempt to pick up someone at every place they stopped didn’t mean Cas was a prude! If you asked him Castiel would say it meant his brother was nothing but a horn dog and----
With numb fingers, he managed to push the end button on the call, plunging the garage back into silence.
“Yeah.” Sam sounds like Dean feels--hollowed out and empty inside. “Look--before they get here tell me what happened, okay? Whatever it was we can deal with it. I just got you back; I’m not letting you go again!”
Sam huffed irritably and came to a stop in the middle of the sidewalk. He never thought he’d see the day where Dean would take a mate and now that he was so close to having one he was just gone? It just didn’t make sense! Bobby and Benny both had tried talking sense into him saying Dean would come back when he was ready, but Sam just didn’t buy it. Something was wrong, and he was determined to find out what.
His hands shake where they’re cuffed against his lower back, and Dean finds himself grateful that he can’t touch the bruises. They look painful enough just
All the anger seeped out of Gabriel like it’d never been there in the first place, leaving him frowning down at his plate of long cooled to the point of cold food. It didn’t look appetizing but he made himself take a few bites from the toast anyway. If nothing else it gave him time to think as he chewed, not that he felt any better about the situation by the time he managed to swallow. “You sound so sure.” He finally offered up at length, though he didn’t bother meeting the angel’s eyes. “I wish I was that sure.”
