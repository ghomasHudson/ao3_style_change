“I didn’t know you meant
As Cas said this last, Dean finally caught on to the fact that Cas was completely fucking with him.
“It is?”
“Well met, Dean. I hope you will enjoy your stay with us,” replied the lanky man who stepped into line behind them.
There was a pause.
Just when Dean thought he was going to lose his mind, Cas pulled out of the kiss and stood up. Dean felt his stomach drop until Cas said, “Take them off.” At Dean’s dazed confusion, Cas explained, “Your underwear. Take them off.”
“What’s up, Cas?”
“Dean!” Sam said, in his most strident “Dean, you’re being a dipshit” voice. “What the hell? You just let some dude walk up off the street and snow you into some ridiculous story because you think he makes a hot Xena?”
“Yeah, all right, but I ain’t going out there with a raging boner, man.”
Dean looked on the verge of tears, but Cas was too furious to notice.
opening,” Dean muttered.
It was only as he was walking toward the kitchen that Dean realized just how much Cas had changed—he hadn’t even reacted to Dean’s shirtlessness. Dean told himself that was a good thing, even as he felt disappointment wash over him. He’d liked flustering Cas, even though it made it harder to ignore his own attraction.
Dean groaned. “Aw, man, how long are we talking? A few days? A week? What?”
“Cas could build one, couldn’t you, Cas? I mean, that’s sorta what you do, right?” Sam asked.
“Here, I’ll help you put your stuff away,” Dean said, grabbing onto the pile in Castiel’s arms. Castiel ignored the little shiver of
"It wasn't good, no. But then my father turned to me and he said that he owned the house and it was my home as long as I wanted it to be. That he loved me just the same as he always had, and he'd speak with my mother." Cas unwrapped his sandwich but didn't start eating it. "Later that night, I heard her tell him he had to choose between us. I didn't want to hear more, so I covered my head with my pillow. When I got up the next morning, she was gone."
Cas huffed a small laugh and relaxed. “Are you asking because we’re dating, because you feel bad for me being alone, or because you want a repeat performance with your family?”
The next day, Castiel sought out Jacob Davidson, who was carving on his porch again. Cas explained – without mentioning their feelings or attraction for one another, obviously – that Dean had suggested getting an apartment together. Castiel asked if Jacob thought it would be good for him or not to do so.
Dean got the message and let go with some reluctance. Cas pulled away and bent over to kiss Dean. The angle was weird, but it didn’t feel any less good for that. Cas came up for air after a minute and gave Dean a searching look.
“You’re pretty,” she told Dean in a soft voice, her eyes wide with wonder.
“Cas?” His voice was barely a whisper and sounded as much like a plea as a question. He doubted anyone except Cas had been able to hear it.
Jacob shook his head again. “No, Castiel, that is no life. There are some men and women here who I suspect are like us, but have not found a partner in life. Those people live single lives and are happily celibate and can handle staying in this life. I have wished 1000 times that I left and stayed with the boy that I loved. I’ve had many years to regret my decision. Please don’t repeat my mistake.”
He relaxed instantly. The man smelled and felt as good as he looked. Warm, soft skin, solid muscles, and a smell like piney woods were always a good combination. He was starting to drift off—despite his mild state of arousal—when his relaxation became tension and a pounding heartbeat once again.
“Cas, you know I don’t just want you around for your mojo, right? You’re my friend and I’d want you around even if you couldn’t do any angel shit whatsoever. It just worries me because you can’t—”
“Uh, pretty sure that ain’t beef, Dean.” Cas’s imitation of him was not even close.
Okay. SO. Since I am going to miss that interaction so much and because I know you all have tropes you didn't get to see, I am going to allow everyone to suggest ONE trope that they would really like to see. However many suggestions I get, that's how many more chapters I will add to this. It won't be first come, first served, just like the list wasn't in order. They'll be written in the order the muse strikes me. And I won't necessarily write them every day. But I will write them and as soon as I can.  So think up good ones! The person who suggests it will get a shout out in the notes (unless I forget, which hopefully I won't.) Ready? Set? GO! ♥
Cas was staring at the key in his hands, realizing he’d never had the key to anyone’s home before except his brother’s—and he didn’t even have that at the moment. He didn’t even have a key to his parents’ house. Not that he intended to visit anyway.
Dean gave Gavin a perfunctory smile and wave as they walked the few feet to the Impala. As they slid in, he saw that Gavin was still watching them. Which was the excuse he gave himself for saying:
"I overheard you and Sammy talking. So I know everything. Well, I know the basics, anyway. And I went down to talk to Mom about it and realized I thought I should be mad about the lying, but honestly I'm not. It's actually freakin' awesome that you'd do something like that for us. You shouldn't have lied about it, but I know you thought you were protecting me from myself 'cause I am pretty stubborn about accepting help." He leaned close with a smirk. "Almost as stubborn as you with a stack of library books, insisting you were gonna walk four miles home." He winked and leaned back. "The truth is, though, all you'd have had to say was, 'Think about Sam and your mom' and I'd have been onboard. So next time you think up a crazy scheme, you better talk to me. Capisce?"
“Yes, I just needed some things in here for research.”
With that, she took off for upstairs, presumably to make the phone call. Dean pulled out his phone and sent off a text to Cas.
“Dean, it doesn’t matter, does it? Aren’t you glad we’re here?”
“Sam,” Charlie said through clenched teeth. “I think what Gabriel is trying to say is that we should all give our brothers the benefit of the doubt.”
Dean’s eyes were suspiciously red, but he nodded. “Yeah. Okay. I get it. It’s hard not hating myself for kicking you out, though, man.”
“Hey, Bobby, it’s me. How’s it going?” he asked when Bobby gave his standard gruff greeting.
When Dean turned the flashlight—which he’d wisely been looking for while Cas foolishly decided to move forward in the dark—toward him, Castiel could see that he was elbow-deep in the pelvis of a prone skeleton. As an angel he’d have known to whom the bones belonged, how long the person had lived, how they’d died.
Cas looked at him with wide, sad eyes. Then suddenly his face split into a beautiful smile. “I like you, Dean. I think you might be the first person in my life to ever really understand something I was feeling.”
mix them up.”
Dean really liked the idea of Cas making their table. And it was something he could keep when Cas was back in the village. Still, he hated to ask. “Well, I mean…you do that all day long at work now, so…”
“Where did you—”
“Ana made me promise to tell you that I
“Sam.” Bobby answered honestly. They barely said his name since he left. Dean needed to know he was ok, but other than that it only caused him to spiral, “He’s not coming home for the holidays, going to a new girlfriends place.”
“You’re ok then?” Castiel asked again.
“That must be Benny.” Jody got up and walked toward the door.
“W-what tr-truck d-d.” Dean stopped talking, taking a bite of his pie. He hated when he was like this. But this alpha, even if he did seem nice, didn’t help his ability to talk at all.
(See the end of the chapter for
about Charlie, but had not met her yet. She was in the tech industry and apparently could talk faster than Ana.
“I come from money, so I never had to do my own laundry—cook my own food. Nothing. Coming here and having a strict schedule—I thought I was in prison.” She smiled, “But I was able to get back on my feet. I reached out to my family who I thought wouldn’t hate me for dissolving my bond with my alpha. Gabriel is incredibly supportive, but not the stability I needed. But he brought Cassie, who was the support and stability I needed to recover. So now I moved out—oh, I guess it’s been three years now?” She looked at Jody who nodded, “And I am doing great, this placed helped me out so I give money and time when I can.” Dean was surprised she was so open about her story. She didn’t go into the weeds of details, but she spoke about everything so freely. Dean wished he could do that. He wished he could speak at all.
"It is an alpha's job to comfort omegas during heats. To know they are cared for- supported. It is a biological
He squealed, instantly turning it off again. His body
Dean barely got to his car before his phone vibrated.
“Oh. I hope your first heat since Cain went alright, have you seen a gynecologist as a checkup?”
“Bathroom?”
“Fuck.” His father said, stumbling toward the door. He managed to pull one of Sammy’s drawings off the wall in disgust as he walked out. Sammy was still crying as he crawled up to Dean.
He rocked down on the toy, rubbing his cock as fast as possible. He fell down to his arm again, fisting his own cock as he groaned into his sheets. He risked letting go of his cock for a brief second to increase the vibration. As soon as it kicked up, he came untouched. His hand was back on his cock, riding out the waves as his cum dribbled all over his fingers. He continued to rub his cock until it got soft and he winced.
“Ok.” Dean whispered back, starting to cry, “Why does Daddy yell at me?”
.” Cain said, but Dean wasn’t paying attention. He pressed his nose against Cain’s shoulder, breathing him in deeply. Dean wrapped an arm around Cain, holding him close. When he realized what he was doing, he froze.
“You did a great job protecting our nest Sam.” Dean whispered, tucking his too long hair behind one ear. Sam blushed bright red.
“You were military?” Dean asked.
Ana smiled, “I’d love to help, I’ll text Gabe too. He can go with us.” Dean wasn’t sure how he felt about Gabriel going along as well. Ana probably sensed it as he sat down next to her on the couch, “Gabriel is probably the most embarrassing person to go heat shopping with, but it’s definitely worth it. I was too self-conscious and shy to get anything, but he made sure I got it. And he explained everything. My heats for a while were more about snuggling, but I still needed supplies. Plus, Gabriel makes jokes out of everything so it doesn’t make you feel like you’re pulling out your own fingernails.”
“Helped me get to this, so I’m n-not complaining.” Dean replied. Castiel smiled brightly at Cain’s mark.
“I have an extra shirt in my car if you want it.” Cas said.
Dean shook his head, “N-no. S-She-sh-she.” Dean stuttered, he took a deep breath. She wasn’t here. He wanted to vomit.
“You get home ok?”
“Two IPAs and a Pilsner.” Dean answered.
to be touched. A strong arm pulled him closer before the kiss broke off entirely. Dean couldn’t help but grin, the snow blizzard scent had increased as well as the pine. Dean breathed it in deeply, not quite scenting him but definitely flirting with the line.
“I did.” Cain said carefully, “At first, you seemed so appalled at having an alpha, I didn’t know how to bring it up. Colette and I decided if we showed you we were a good pack, then you might come around.” Cain let out a breath, “And the last time you had an episode here I—before Colette suggested the Omega shelter—I didn’t ask then because I thought you’d say no. Dean, I knew you a year and a half before I was able to ask how long you had been unbound.” Dean frowned, “You put up a boundary around the topic, and I wanted to respect it.”
“I ended up in a bond with the older guy who owned the bakery before I did. He taught me that not all alphas are absolute dicks. That’s when Cassie came knocking.” Gabriel smiled, “Took us a bit to get our shit together and join his pack, but now my stutter is gone and I feel like I can breathe again.” It was quiet for a while. The two scents helped Dean breathe. He knew he wanted to talk about it, he hadn’t even managed to tell Missouri what happened yet. The last time he tried, his jaw locked up. But after hearing Gabriel, maybe—maybe he could.
“Y-yes” Dean acquiesced, making Castiel chuckle.
“Aw, come on Ellen. This is Dean, we met at the Omega shelter.”
It took a bit, but John eventually settled down. They lived in a rancher home not far from a school that allowed Dean to walk there. Dean asked if they could get a bed for Sammy, and one day John came back with two twin mattresses. Though Dean was only nine, he was getting good at figuring things out himself. He found a shelter nearby in the yellow book on the counter, they had been generous with food and clothing in the past. He dressed up Sammy and took him to the shelter to see if they had extra sheets.
“I think you’re allowed to speak up for yourself and it not be dramatic.” Billie said sternly which made Dean smile a bit.
“N-never.” Pam looked offended, making him smile.
“How are you feeling?” Colette asked. His fingers itched in desire to snuggle up to both of them.
“I can drive him.” Paterson volunteered.
that.
Dean stood up with a frown. He slid open the door and walked straight into the kitchen, “How long have y-you wanted to be m-my alpha?” Cain looked up a little shocked. He was assembling sandwiches while Colette was cleaning up.
“Honey, your alpha will know eventually.” She whispered, as if it would lighten the blow.
“You’re welcome Dean.” Paterson said, “Do you have a laptop or a computer at home?”
“We got a few different kinds—do you have a preference?”
“Um—considering my diagnosis, is there one I should pick?” Dean asked.
“That sounds perfect.” Dean said with a smile, “Congratulations.”
“Alright sweetheart. Why don’t you head to the bathroom real quick and put this on.” It was a slick pad. Dean’s face heated up, “It shouldn’t be bad for your first one, but rather safe than sorry. Okay? And I’ll let Mr. Paterson take you home.”
listen to an order.” Gabriel shook his head then sighed, “I didn’t take a bond for a while—just lived on my own. I had flair ups, but I managed them. I worked at a bakery with a guy who was patient and understanding of my condition. I wasn’t going to take an alpha bond because they were manipulative. Stupid.” He held out his arm with the multiple bites, “Each one was trying to get me to suppress my nature—to stop my heats or deny them. It was fuckin’ awful.”
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice was strained, and the low grumble from Cas was not going away. The metal was cold, and he yelped a bit. Another loud growl from Cas nearly had Dean covering his ears, “Just cold—sorry.” Dean managed to say, patting Castiel’s hand. Trying to comfort the alpha was at least distracting him, which was good.
Dean had given up on refusing food from them. They would just bring him food to the garage, or put it in his car. Food was their love language and they wanted to make sure Dean was well fed.
“Love you too Dean.” He kept brushing through his hair as he read the next chapter. Dean fell asleep, breathing in Sam’s comforting scent and listening to him flip the page.
Cas took Dean’s hand strongly and moved close. Dean couldn’t help but inhale, it had a chilling effect on his whole system, letting him breathe in deep. Dean leaned closer, not quite burying himself in Cas’s shoulder even though he wanted to do it. Taking another deep breath, his heart rate started to fall.
Dean managed a smile, “H-heats were the w-worst. R-ruby said I was w-weird for wanting to be a-around S-Sam. He w-wouldn't let me around h-him d-during. Just l-locked in my r-room."
“It’s annoying h-how much m-my body h-as already ad-adjusted.” Dean spoke once his plate was finished.
If you haven't read any of my other stories, you will know I am recklessly pro-therapy. This story continues that model :)
Dean. You got to let people care if they want to.” Another therapist line. It was said in defense of letting Dean take care of
“We all have set backs—you’re not sayin’ you're better than the rest of us, are you?” Pam asked with a smile. Dean scowled, but shook his head.
“Castiel?” Billie called out. Dean heard him answer as he walked back into the room, “First question is birth control.”
“Yeah.” Ash nodded.
“Dean?” Colette rubbed his shoulder, “There’s a group that I volunteer with sometimes—it’s a bunch of omegas kinda like you. They either went unbound for a bit, or just had really shitty alphas that leave them with ARS.” Dean flinched at the mention of his syndrome, “I know you don’t like talking—but I find it comforting just to listen.” Dean nodded, but didn’t really have any intention of going. He was sure it was going to be ridiculous. He didn’t want to gather around and listen to everyone’s sob stories. He took another deep breath, willing himself to push through.
“Hey Bobby” Dean called out as he walked into Bobby’s office. Bobby looked at him and blinked a few times, a smile spreading across his face, “What?”
on her way, rather than “on her way”.
“It’s the next Thursday. We tried—Missouri tried to pull you out of it—Jody. Bobby said it’s happened to you before for days at a time, it’s a common symptom of advanced ARS. I—we didn’t want to—we were scared—I didn’t want to ask you until—it just felt like I was taking advantage of your state if I asked then.” Cain confessed.
“Your brother?” Cain asked and Dean nodded. Cain met him after his bond was broken so Dean wasn’t sure how he knew about Sam, unless it was through Bobby.
“T-too b-big.” He frowned, staring out the window, “T-too d-dumb.”
Castiel frowned, like he just realized they were in the hospital.
“Good job, kid, just encourage him.” A gruff voice said.
back.
“We recommend all new packs sleep in the same bed the firsts two weeks.” Missouri stated.
“Bobby—
I'm not dead! Bits of this story are slowly coming together, but I wanted to write more before I posted the next chapter. Hope you enjoyed
“Oh.” Dean whispered.
Dean flipped the blankets over his head and curled up tighter into himself. Why couldn’t his body just be
“I—do you happen to have a long sleeve?” Castiel asked, half standing in the doorway as he wore his new shirt.
“Even further.” She said. Was he going to fall off the end? Dean closed his eyes a bit as he moved closer, “There ya go. First I’m going to do a pelvis exam, so I’m going to basically feel around to make sure nothing is off.” She showed off her gloved hands before reaching down. As soon as she touched Dean’s thigh, he flinched. A deep growl from Castiel made Dean cover his eyes with his free hand.
It was almost like since John couldn’t smell it, he never walked into the room. It had become a small oasis for the two boys. They brought in posters to hang up on the wall—well, Dead did—Sam continued to write his homework up on the wall if it was particularly complicated.
“I am on the board of Regent Hospital. I saw your application to be on the board come through, and knew your mate worked there. I came over to discuss opportunities.” Castiel grinned easily, but Dean was starting to suspect that this was part of his chess game.
It wasn’t exactly smooth sailing for Sam, and he’s the strongest man Dean knows. Adam was a civilian, a kid yanked from heaven who missed his mom. He wouldn't have survived.
The old steelworks is a couple miles out of Lebanon proper, and it’s been abandoned for as long as they’ve lived here. Barda at the post office told him once that it’s haunted, which it definitely ain’t, but it does have an eerie feel to it that keeps the locals away. They’ve used it a few times for these high-risk conversations slash ambushes, and never seen so much as a homeless person or a group of drunk teenagers.
Adam had a regular childhood, a normal mom. He probably doesn’t have the same hangups as Dean. The kid asked for an apology, maybe the least they can do is give him one even if it is too little too late.
“And anyway, it doesn’t matter!”
Dean is pretty sure that one isn’t on them. He knows angels and demons were conspiring all over the place to pop that particular box. Him and Sam were puppets then, too, they just didn’t know how high up the strings went.
First, they have to get to Sam and hope he’s still in one piece.
It’s not the first time a cosmic being has thrown a fancy title at them, and maybe that’s Chuck, maybe it ain’t. But Dean has been
That’s Chuck, he can hear it louder now. What’s that bastard doing with Eileen? Where the fuck is Sam?
“My dad caught me once,” he can’t bring himself to say
“Some things you just need to deal with alone,” he says instead, and he doesn’t know if he’s still talking about Hell.
Dean appreciates it, not least because his stomach is still aching uncomfortably and he can’t tell if it’s because of the swift kick to the balls or the lingering lactose intolerance. His throat is tender and sore and, judging from how Sam winces at him when they pass under Garth’s porch light, it’s bruising delightfully. Great.
“What do you say we make it interesting?”
Dean drags himself across the wreckage, grabs a bottle of whatever’s still intact and slumps to the floor.
When it all boils over, Dean is alone.
Dean has fallen a few paces behind, and Cas slows his steps to fall in next to him.
It’s mostly the kind of stock rations they can’t make use of on the move. He takes what he can. It’s no marshmallows and mac and cheese but they’ve got a few bottles of water, the remnants of Dean’s jerky stash and three tins of spam, and they can pick up discounted bread at any corner store on the way. They’ve survived for longer on less.
“Uh,” Sam says, the stupidest
“Samuel, please,” she cuts him off immediately. “You killing me was one of the best things that ever happened.”
Sam packs and Dean’s does a quick supply run (a six pack of beer, liquorice, water for Sammy and enough jerky to cover the 7 hour drive). By the time they’re ready to go, there’s been another attack reported, up to 5 vics, just to make them haul ass through the night.
suffocating and dark and--
Heavy silence fills the room. Guilt and dread, past and future, mingle together, churn nauseatingly.
“Sam is worried about you,” Adam says. He almost sounds genuine, but he also doesn’t loosen their grip. “He lost people too.”
“Sorry baby. I can always make more sons.”
“He means well,” Eileen smiles.
He’s losing it, his can hear the shake in his voice. His eyes are burning and he can’t bring himself to care, there’s no one here but him and his long list of screw ups.
“Michael,” he says, voice echoing and lilted like a cassette recorded over too many times. “Long time no see.”
“Yeah, we would’ve,” Dean says. And then, because Sam still looks like a kicked puppy and this is obviously more about Rowena than it is about Jack, he adds, “Look man, I get it. We have lost way,
“That’s Angela, Lee,” Lorna says over his shoulder. “She’s in here all the time.”
to come for us later, I know where I stand on that!”
There are tools all lined neatly on the wall, so his tips his chair that way and hopes its a cheap as it feels. He lands awkwardly on his bad shoulder, but it doesn’t dislocate and it’s enough to smash the chair and loosen the restraints around his feet.
“So, what,” Dean sighs. Snaps his laptop shut. “You got your panties twisted over Amara? Or Billie? Just so we’re clear.”
“Honey, I’m not stopping them.”
Fine.
“I admit I had my doubts,” Dean laughs. “But we didn’t think Jack was ever coming back from that. Ever. So coming home to this? Fortuna’s blessing might just be the real deal after all.”
“And all this will keep us off Chuck’s radar?” Dean asks her.
“We don’t need to find him, Sam,” Dean snaps. “He wants us dead, he’ll come to us. I don’t know about you but I ain’t exactly itching to hurry that along.”
“Same as everybody else,” he replies. Racks up the balls. “Better luck.”
Dean doesn’t wait for him to finish. He ducks around Sammy’s worried eyebrows, pegs it back to his room. The thing isn’t there anymore, or not visible at least, but if it’s really there and it’s really him then they can rig up another spell, cook him a new body, and--
is a littler trickier, but Sam has a good guess there too - their coins are dedicated to Fortuna, Goddess of Luck. Which leaves the real tricky job of luring her out, but that too is made easier when sweet, cryptic Evie the bartender lets slip that she’s never met the owner, but Pax is her son.
Dean needn’t have worried. Sam simmers quietly, pours the overflow into whatever he needs to get done. The 8 ball drops into the pocket smooth as fucking butter.
, a throbbing ache in his head and neck blossoming from his swollen jaw.
“Sally,” Dean assures. “Just tell me what happened.”
Dean arrives on scene just in time to see Cas firmly close the door on a raging Michael and the distinct sound of antique furniture being smashed.
Cas squints at him, then the bush, dips his chin ever so slightly.
Screw food, Dean heads for the liquor instead. A couple fingers of whisky don’t stop the anger bubbling in his throat, boiling in his blood, but it does clear his head enough that he knows he’s being irrational. Cas is obviously fine without them, without
Dean heads to the storage room on autopilot. Tries to marshal his thoughts.
“So, yes,” he says. “I will help you. What was done to the Darkness can be done to God, if he is as weak as you say. And I know how. That’s the spell.”
The look on her face is worth the honestly.
Donny also likes to hysterically remind them that their lives are absolutely batshit like he
, and Dean kicks in the door, fully expecting to be blasted to oblivion by God.
Yeah.
He slumps backwards so suddenly Dean thinks he’s passed out, and gives them the goddamn silent treatment.
Charlie and Stevie, Jody and Donna and the girls. Bobby and Garth and all the AU hunters.
“Hell yeah, he did. Little jerk likes to remind me of the pussy I was when I had ghost sickness-”
look where the reflection is coming from.
-” The red blossom, knew it! “-Cas has some issues with Chuck threatening people we care about? After what he did to Jack?”
The spell isn’t on the tablet, but the authors notes give them a jumping off point. If they can talk to Michael, he might know the binding spell they used on Amara.
Dean steps around Cas, towards the stairs, and Cas sighs loudly.
“We had a- a- an agreement, a
“I will.”
“I--I lo---” he can’t breathe, the words choking him, so many, and maybe that’s not the place to start.
“It’s fine,” Jack smiles. “Nothing’s happeni--”
He leads Jack away and the second they’re out of sight, Sam explodes into restless motion.
“Don’t you fuckin’ know it,” he winks, leans over to audibly whisper to Lorna, “Lucky 13 was out go-to hook up room in the motels of our troubled youth.”
“We’re gonna fight him,” Dean tells her.
Dean thinks of Rowena and her list of regrets, thinks of Benny and Jack and Charlie and Mom and everybody he didn’t get to save, people he never got the chance to thank for everything they did for him, all the times he never got to say goodbye before they were gone.
The world isn’t ending, yet. Dean should log off, take a break. But maybe it is, and it just doesn’t know it yet.
The bartender, Evie, seems friendly enough and when Dean asks after a game she directs them to a man named Pax with no hesitation. Pax is a well built dude with a confident air about him, but he doesn’t seem overtly threatening.
Cas is beautiful here, safe and satisfied, basking in an unexpected win.
“So you think it worked?” Sam asks. “Kept us off Chuck’s radar?”
“C’mon, dinner’s at 8,” she ushers them over the threshold. “And I’m gonna tell Donna you said I’m your favourite, by the way.”
“He did say that,” she tells him. “But I can’t. It’s too much.”
raised a queer, and for all that Dean had desperately pretended he wasn’t for a long time after.
No progress is made in the first 36 hours, and Dean goes to not-sleep in his room for a change, before the 70 year old armchairs eat his spine and give him a permanent hunchback.
“I know, I know. Look, she’s not the most reliable witness but. Best friends don’t just up and leave without saying goodbye.”
“Michael,” Cas says. “We needed to speak with you because God is back. You didn’t think the cage just opened on its own did you?”
“Sammy!” Dean says, shoves a plate at him. “Pancakes! Eat!” And he’s still too thin, skin too pale, dark circles too deep around his eyes, but he’s also somehow
“I wasn’t,” Dean starts, but he was. Kill Jack before he could hurt anyone else and kill himself in the deal before he ever had to feel the guilt. He
“Yeah,” Dean laughs. “
But this is Sam’s game, it’s Sam’s call. Dean trusts him, he needs to step back and let Sam make the choice.
“You haven’t even told me what case you’re working on, man.”
Even Jack, with all his worldly powers recovering and rebalancing, can’t sense it.
It’s stood by Dean’s desk, wispy and transparent.
It’s still as washed out as it ever was, trees wider than Baby blocking all light from above. It should be claustrophobic, should trigger half the panic buttons Dean has, but one breath of the musty, stale air and his shoulders relax.
“She…” Evie blinks. “She shut it down.”
He puts on his big boy pants, and heads for the basement.
It doesn’t speak, doesn’t do anything. Just wanders the rooms, lurks in corners and watches them.
Maybe Dean’s just getting old, but the idea of being a highschooler for eternity sounds like an as-yet-undiscovered circle of Hell. Maybe it’s just because he’s running on liquor right now.
Then he plucks the spell from where it rolled under a slot machine, holds it up in front of himself like he’s presenting Simba, squeezes the solid rock until it shatters, crumbles, evaporates uselessly into the air.
Joey is a chill dude hanging quietly in a corner nursing a drink - he hasn’t moved since they got here but everyone who walks past nods at him. He’s the big kahuna, no doubt.
“Okay,” Dean says, and stashes all the maybes for later. He prods the vile, leathery leviathan blossom laid out in front of him. “What do I do with this thing?”
“Dean,” he says, takes it.
“Whatever,” Dean grunts, rolls his eyes before he catches himself. He’s supposed to be making nice. “Hey, c’mon, man. You been staring at these chicken scratches for days. Would it kill you to take a break.”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he says, hesitant, but Cas clearly has no problem tackling her to the ground before she can stab him.
He lucks out - the corridor is empty, Sam’s bedroom door is firmly shut, and in the library his scattered research books have been piled haphazardly in the middle of a table.
“I don’t know.”
“Okay,” Sam says. “Just give us a second to wrap this up and we’ll come with you--”
And she dissolves into atoms before she’s got to the last syllable.
After Stanford, Dean singing out of tune was one of the quickest ways to annoy Sam out of a bad mood, and he’s just sort of fallen into the habit since. He’s pretty sure bad karaoke is still the most evil thing he did with black eyes, but he’s not gonna tell Lee that.
“But he looks like your dad.”
“Great.”
It doesn’t stop the hard, cold feeling in Dean’s gut.
“It’s instructions for how to look out for us soft, squishy humans if God isn’t there to watch our backs, yeah? So, what if it also has notes on how to get rid of him in the first place, huh?”
“Go!” She yells, and Dean ain’t gonna wait to be told twice. He grabs Kaia, Real-Kaia, and hauls her back towards the portal.
All he’s done for weeks is migrate between his bed and the kitchen, and now he can’t even do that without instigating a capital-T
He swallows. Nods.
He shuffles into the doorway, hunched and pale and miserable, and Dean doesn’t really need to ask but he does anyway;
He sucks it up and sings.
He doesn’t know why it always seems to be Cas that bears the brunt these days, except that Cas can take it.
“Just like I promised,” the leviathan says, raises his arms like the greatest fucking showman and Dean wants to shoot him on principle.
“Doing what we do,” Sam says, gently. “We’ve had to get used to losing people. Probably too used to it. With Adam, we said goodbye because we thought we had to. We were wrong.”
Dean wants to throw his own phone across the room just to hear the delicate parts smash apart, but he redirects the momentum into lunging towards the nearest laptop and pulls up the Find My Phone app.
the cage,” she says. “Every door here was flung wide when Chuck opened the fissure. Your archangel could be anywhere in hell. Or out of hell, for that matter.”
It settles him, in a weird way, this existential jigsaw puzzle. The big picture isn’t all there yet but he can play catchphrase with the pieces he has and they all scream one thing;
He really doesn’t.
Dean takes a rattling breath, digs deep into that rage. He’s been hollow for so long that it’s euphoric to feel
Dean asks her to hang around til closing, and Lee lets them stay in the roadhouse while he patches up the damaged window. Lorna takes a break from washing glasses and taking stock behind the bar to bring them coffee, because she’s a goddess.
There’s grass on his cheek.
“Which part,” Dean mutters into his beer. “Jack’s deal with Death, or the part where she’s got him eating angel hearts?”
Boy, does he get it. Whenever something good happens, it just starts the countdown in Dean’s head,
They’ve wandered to the war room, the scrolls from days ago still littered everywhere. Some of it is Enochian, some Cuneiform, all gibberish to Dean.
When the others eventually join him, beckoned by the smell of food, they don’t look well rested either. Eileen drowns herself in caffeine, Sam eats real pig without complaint.
“Heya Sammy,” Dean says. “You, uh. You feeling okay?”
“Well,” he says, pretends he doesn’t see Sam flinch in anticipation. “That’s good enough for me.”
So what if it doesn’t feel perfectly homey right now? It’s not going to get any better with them avoiding it. He wants cosy movie nights, he’s gonna have to work for it same as anything else.
On the other, Dean is stuck in a loop of endlessly refreshing the local, national and global news and the stream of clickbait, politics and fluff stories that are actually really fucking depressing stories dressed in an unconvincing Scooby villain mask is driving him insane.
“I knew it, Dean,” Cas says, suddenly. “When I was with Jack’s mother, she-- Kelly just had
He holds Cas’ look for a long moment before Sam pointedly clears his throat.
“Probably?” Sam scoffs. “What, like she had the ma’lak box figured out?”
What he can do, he decides as he pulls the acacia from the ingredients shelf, is try to do better.
“So, fix it!” she insists again, and thankfully that’s when Sam stumbles back in with her scotch.
Sam makes no promises, but he really does need to check on his brother. Dean has been a shell of himself since, well. He never did cope well when Cas was gone.
Cas sits at the map table, literally so far away from Dean that he’s not even technically in the library anymore, and flicks through a couple of Enochian scrolls in silence. Sam and Eileen settle at the wide study tables like normal people and don’t comment on the obvious, bleeding tension.
“That was our chance,” Sam says, clearly in the mood to torture himself from all angles. “To stop Chuck.”
“But what about cosmic balance, Cas?” he snaps. “I mean, Jack’s gonna kill God? What about Amara?”
“I still don’t like it,” Sam sighs.
And that got significantly more personal than Dean was expecting. He almost feels bad for watching now, but now he can’t stop listening. He thinks of Claire, though, the last time they saw her,
They’ve justified themselves for years by thinking he was gone. Burned out of his vessel by the almighty power of an Archangel, like they were promised would happen back in apocalypse take 1, or worse; trapped in his own head, drowning endlessly, unable to breathe but always just on the cusp of conciousness.
Oh yeah, he’s definitely still got it.
Sam slams his knuckles into the chrome worktop.
Either way, he trusts Sam.
It’s not a great solution, they both know that. But it’s something. It’s better than the alternative.
“What’s happening?!” Sam shouts from where he’s turned to barricade the door more solidly with his shoulder. “What’s going on?”
, whatever that means. Look, it might not even be real, you know how this stuff works. There’s always a catch.”
“Long time ago. His own kind, they didn’t trust him and they,” he makes an awful tearing sound in his throat, “Ripped him apart.”
“The only way to keep them safe,” Sam continues. “To keep
But somewhere down the line, in between catastrophes and probably longer ago that he will admit, Dean fell ass over tea kettle in love with a male-shaped angel and suddenly it matters a whole lot. Their chances are admittedly still pretty dicey, but if they do actually live through this mess, if they get any kind of shot at a happy ending… Cas is it for him.
“Yeah,” Dean says. “Yeah, it is.”
They both look dead on their feet, worn down to their very bones. Still frantically searching for any kind of solution. Dean should help them, should take over while they rest. Should help everyone who got Thanos snapped away, all their friends and everyone they ever saved and all the lucky bastards they never met. But he can’t bring himself to care.
the coffee machine is depressingly empty. Dean makes a note to go grocery shopping later and commits himself to the breakfast of champions; their last bottle of beer and dry cereal in the middle of the afternoon.
The ball clicks into the pocket, snaps Fortuna back to the here and now. She assesses the table in a few quick glances, then visibly shrugs off memory lane and tosses a bitter smile at Dean.
All they’ve got now is clutching desperately to straw after straw.
“I heard this story once about this place you can go if your luck's gone bad.”
Sister Jo is where they left her; a Kiwanis hall in Minnesota, living the simple life of modest do-gooder so long as you ignore her Gucci boots and the fact that she’s literally counting bills when they arrive.
Dean’s just starting to think this is a goose chase when he catches footfalls behind him, slower and somehow still louder than theirs. He waits another few minutes to confirm he’s not just being twitchy and paranoid but, no; once he’s looking for it, he registers movement in his peripheral.
Cas deserves better.
He’s snappy in a way that doesn’t suit him, and Dean can’t decide if it’s because he’s tired or because Dean’s never turned him down before. Kinda blowing his own trumpet, but he knows he’s a good lay. Either way, Lee waves him off, goes back to the window.
“But not today,” Dean agrees. “Sorry, man. But we did get Sam and Eileen back, s’not all bad.”
It’s easy to track the wolves down because they took Ashley back to their own house, which is stupid. Even stupider is the fact that they took her and tied her up instead of outright eating her, and they’re arguing really fucking loudly about it when Dean and Sam pull up.
Looking down at him, all Dean can think of is Jack kneeling in that graveyard, calm and accepting while Dean pressed a gun to his head, ready to die.
, but his face is uncooperative, feels stiff and forced.
Theirs, not Dean’s. His win was always one thing.
Dean checks his timer. 3 hours 8 minutes until the portal closes. It took them almost 3 hours to get here.
Dean, though. Dean can’t switch off that itch in his brain.
They have a time limit, an increasingly pressing time limit, and a job to do.
Dean shakes himself, breathes deep through his nose. Wipes his eyes.
“The prophet,” Cas says into his book. “Why?”
Michael scowls at him, then decides to needle Sam instead and some small, traitorous part of him is relieved.
So they leave him sat in a room talking to himself.
The way she says
but she’s cool with it. And Cas helped.”
“Fine. Yeah, I’ll play.” He pauses, meets the goddess’ eyes. “But not for our luck. For the lives of everybody in here.”
“Look at that,” Dean mocks. “Thought you weren’t a florist. Get up.”
, and Dean feels a rush that has nothing to do with he crowd. He’s pulled into another hug, and Lee steers him off the platform with the arm still around his shoulder.
He’d settle for a few hours of sleep, for now, but of course he doesn’t get them.
“Hey, you know a vamp around here named Benny? Burly guy, Cajun.”
Dean’s hallucinated Cas before. After purgatory, when the Mark was at it’s worst. It didn’t happen so often back then, wasn’t as clear or as persistent as whatever this is. Maybe Dean is officially certifiable.
Bess takes over, thankfully, and Dean can breathe out again. She bids them goodbye and wishes them good luck and thanks them again even though they didn’t do anything useful except maybe motivate Garth to follow them to Minnesota.
It’s just not his bag, okay. He doesn’t get that same thrill Sam does when an index card leads exactly where they need to go, or when the Men of Letters already translated that one super specific ancient skin scroll.
“Just shut up and listen,” Sam snaps, starts rummaging through the ingredients and handing them roughly to Dean one by one. “You don’t think-” Some moss. Some seeds. “-Maybe-” Lambs blood. “-just
“Right,” Lee says flatly, hands on his hips. “What do you say we act like this never happened huh? You just walk out that door?”
Cas leaves and Dean can’t blame him.
“What kind of place?” Sam asks, tentatively.
He picks up another jar, something green and wet, turns it over in his hands and watches the air bubbles slowly glug upwards through the thick fluid. Gross.
“She’s, uh. She’s asleep,” Sam says. “She had a big day.”
“Any luck?”
“Maybe option b,” he insists. “We have any soul catchers?”
“No problem, we’ll manage,” Sam says, smiles at her softly.
“I don’t get it, why the games?”
“I don’t know,” Cas sighs. “Eremiel is reasonable, he’ll hear me out at least. But. The Angels that are left mostly keep to themselves. They refused to stand with God against the Darkness, and he abandoned them again shortly afterwards. They may once again choose to
Cas smile at him indulgently, swirls his whisky like he’s thinking about actually drinking it. Dean sinks back into the leather of his chair. This is a good moment, he’s going to enjoy it.
He’s tempted for a moment to abandon this none-case and stay, tuck in to this amazing breakfast and then research together, the three of them. Except, it’s not Eileen he thinks of when he thinks
This chapter is spondered by my undending need for TFW to just fucking talk about some of their trauma occationally, and also I apologise in advance because this is the written equivalent of a long take in that there are no scene breaks, sorry!
“Yeah,” Garth agrees jovially, then all humour drops from his expression like a stone. “So, what’s up with your teeth?”
“Whoa, what-” Sam is saying but Dean can’t hear over the static in his head, suddenly. He’s moving before he knows where, why. Knows, vaguely, somewhere, that he should be angry, should be furious, but the black hole in his chest swallows that in on top of everything else.
“Alright,” Sam says, still studying his map. “So, if Garth is right, we take this road. But, honestly, it doesn’t look like there’s anything up there.”
And then he fucking
Everyone on Earth is back.
Dean hasn’t been here since Billie and Crowley opened the side door to Limbo and the Cage. It hasn’t changed. Neither has the instinctual shiver down his spine, a putrid mixture of fear and exhilaration that never fails to turn his stomach. He shrugs it off, takes that grating first step and then it’s a little easier to keep moving.
“Sam,” he says from the doorway. “C’mon man, relax. You want a burger?”
Mostly.
“So,” Rowena rolls her eyes, but it comes off more fond than anything else. “Why are you here?”
“Hell of a shot,” Joey says, and before Dean can say
He picks the most recent bookmark on his tablet and insists on a case, inflates the lifeboat.
“Then,” Dean says, carefully. “I’m glad it didn’t work.”
Sam must be pissed too, at least if his vindicating little huff is anything to go by.
“Okay,” he says, slides the phone back into his pocket. “Let’s split up.”
“What,” Dean says. “We can’t just want to see our favourite sheriff?”
. “I know, okay, Sam. Just. Go do your stalking or whatever.”
He can’t. Dean hasn’t cried since Mom, since after the funeral and everything came pouring out wet and real fucking ugly and it hadn’t helped at all.
It’s almost jarring how obliging Cas is being after weeks of oppressive tension between them, and it makes Dean feel even worse. He should have apologised ages ago, should have fucking talked to Cas before the last possible second, shouldn’t have waited until the moment he thought he’d never see Cas again.
“Go ahead and take it,” Sam says, not even convincingly. “We’ll get it back.”
“Ghost Sickness,” Dean confirms. “Man, it was no fun. Everything was scary! This cat jumped out at me and I shit myself dude!”
Before Dean’s even processed the plastic monstrosity, the buzzing starts up again, louder than before. The bookshelves shake, the walls tremble, the whole bunker creaks around them.
They make in home at any rate, and Sam launches immediately into ingredient gathering. Within ten minutes, he leads Eileen to the main bathroom.
Of course there isn’t. The empty chair sits where it always does, mocking him.
Michael allows himself to be lead passively, but as soon as they close the door he starts pacing like a caged lion. Every muscle in Dean’s shoulders is bunched up tight.
And they are on a schedule, and they don’t have any other options available. And maybe this can be a stop-gap measure; take Chuck off the board and then manage the mark. Lucifer passed it on, shared the burden, maybe they can work around it like that, maybe, maybe--
“What about Jack?” Sam asks, warier now. Dean can practically hear the cogs in his head working. “He’s in God’s book?”
Sam doesn’t push.
It’s nice to catch up with Donna after all the shit that’s gone down recently, so they hang around for a few days. Sam cracks a smile or two that don’t look painfully forced and Dean is self-aware enough to know he doesn’t drink as much Johnny Walker if he’s already full of doughnuts.
She isn’t done yet though.
But when Cas steps forward he’s frozen in place, completely rooted to the spot. It’s a damn angel trap and Goatee smirks at them, the smug big-mouthed fuck.
jack comes back? What do you mean,
Sam corners him later, in the store room.
“How’s Eileen?”
Right now he has shit to do, starting with a phone call.
That’s probably the first time Dean fell in love with him, a little, and Chuck must’ve laughed himself sick then spent the next decade killing and reviving Cas just to fuck with him.
supportive,” Sam says, exasperated, and grabs Dean’s shoulders before he can turn away. “I didn’t push when Cas left, when he was gone for weeks without answering his phone, even though he’s my friend too. I still don’t know what happened! Because neither of you jackasses will talk about it, you’d both rather
“Yeah,” Sam gives him a watery smile. “Yeah, sounds great.”
“Well what now,” Dean says, steels himself and steps forward. Takes the chance. “You’re not gonna dust us.”
Lee toasts, “To John Winchester.”
Cas shrugs with his whole body. Elbows, shoulders, eyebrows; everything. “Sorry, I don’t know.”
It’s a touchy subject.
“I think so. I think I saw his- his memories? He’s weak, Dean. I think we can beat him.”
“Yeah,” Sam snorts, bitter. “Yeah? Lucky them.”
What follows is a comedy of errors that even Shakespeare would be proud of.
Lee Fuckin Webb.
“I’ve heard. Repeatedly.”
Fortuna looks between them, shrugs.
pervy obsession with you.”
Adam had asked. And maybe he’s right, maybe he’s right, but Dean can not go back ten years and save Adam from the cage.
The kitchen reeks so strongly it’s making Dean dizzy, conjures the feeling of invisible fingers twisting his insides. He wants nothing more than to drown himself in the shower, but first they have a manhunt to organise.
“What happened?” Cas asks again, tucks his blade back into his coat at last.
For the first time in a long time, he falls asleep with a smile on his face.
“We left B’s around closing. I was pretty hammered but-- Angela, she was helping me to her car when I, ha,” she looks down, embarrassed, “ I needed-- y’know I got sick. And when I was done, she was gone. Angela was raptured and I was left behind.”
“Lee,” Dean has to try. Lee only sighs again, resigned.
“Had an uncle, though. He always listened when I needed it,” he gives her a pointed look.
“Good. The first quest was meant to strengthen your body. Step two is more spiritual in nature.”
But then she throws them for a double loop; her world is dying, and she knows that because she sees it through Real Kaia’s dreams.
They have no lore books in the car except a few journals, and he’s been through dad’s and Bobby’s enough to know they never went up against the manifestation of luck herself. They’ll have to comb the interweb, and even Sam’s psychic wifi signal doesn’t get bars way out here.
Cas nods, but the reminder does nothing to improve Sam’s mood.
, exactly, he’d just quite like to
“The hell are you doin’ here?”
Amara smiles again, beautific and ethereal.
! We weren’t supposed to TALK ABOUT IT! Not yet, not-- We were supposed to wait! Until
. That Jack would be good for the world. And I felt it too, I
He drops one last clear vial into Dean’s arms, like a witchy mic-drop, not that he needed to after that low fucking blow. Sam lets the heavy silence stew for a moment, then says;
Jody is exactly where she said she’d be, tied up and gagged in a stinking old barn but alive, she’s alive.
“Whatever, we need to go.”
He doesn’t.
Sam thinks Cas vanished with the others, dusted by Chuck. He- He doesn’t
He’s saved from having to make any big decisions when Sam skulks into the kitchen looking miserable as sin. Sam didn’t push him about Cas, so he doesn’t push about Rowena. That doesn’t mean he can’t play up the obnoxious big brother role to get Sam’s mind on something else.
They haven’t been safe for a long time, nobody who gets close to them ever is. Hell, more than once, the people they met exactly once have come back to haunt them as a big ol’ target for the baddie of the week. Maybe Cas isn’t used to being on this side of that threat, Dean thinks viciously. Maybe if he stuck around more often he’d know how this works.
She holds herself differently now, confident and strong; spine straighter, chin higher, arms crossed carelessly across her chest. Before she seemed more alive than the other, now she radiates power.
Dean leaves Sam and Cas conspiring in the hall, snatches a bottle of JD from the library stash and goes up to the gym.
Naturally, this is when they’re thrown head first into Chucks latest idiot-plot.
He knows he’s fucked up the instant he does.
“Texting your secret girlfriend?” she asks.
“Are you two hung over?”
“Yeah,
“Right, yeah, uh,” Sam says. “We… don’t know.”
What’s worse, he never got to tell Benny how much it meant to him. Any of it.
“I always do.”
who is in the cage. And
“So Chuck sent you to kill us?”
The first leg of the journey is familiar territory; up through South Dakota, North Dakota and over the border into Manitoba like when they drove Jody to Asa Fox’s funeral. They only have to stop twice for Baby, which is better than Dean was hoping for, but it’s almost four hours added to an already excruciating three day trip and when they call it a night and settle in to
or whatever?”
“Yeah and who told us that?” Sam asks.
“Hey Sam,” he says. “Dean.”
As always, find me on
“Glad you’re back.” He huffed, slamming the door on his tow truck.
It was supposedly common in packs to reaffirm bonds by biting down again. Dean knew it to be true because he saw some people with strong and noticeable pack bite marks. Bobby’s pack mark from Ellen was still prominent, even though she had died nearly a year previously. Same with his mating mark.
WARNINGS:
“Yeah. The ten-year anniversary was three months ago.” Castiel said as they all sat down at the table. Cain had made gnocchi and it smelled so good that Dean was drooling. Conversation went easy through dinner. Dean talked a bit and Cain looked insanely proud every time he did. Castiel was patient with his stutter, didn’t try to finish the words for him. Castiel brought up Dean’s work, but in a way that didn’t make Dean feel like he was pressuring him in any way. Castiel did follow him on Instagram, if only to see the new project’s Dean was working on of Cain’s.
It was seconds before Colette fell dead asleep. Dean figured it was a nursing technique to be able to fall asleep at a moment’s notice. Dean still felt too stiff. It was weird to be in bed with pack—right? He was being too much. Cain might wake up and wonder why he was in bed. Did other packs do this? He saw this on TV sometimes—but that didn’t make it real life. He should ask Missouri if this was part of his treatment or not.
“Sounds perfect. Want me to open a bottle of wine?”
.” Cain said strongly, “
Dean to be in my pack. Not as a filler. Not as a charity project. Not whatever doubts you got running through your mind. I don’t walk away from pack, not anymore.”
“Oh—still wet?” Cain asked, and Dean nodded. Cain's alpha scent was one of the few Dean didn’t mind. He used to have a crush on the older alpha even though he was about the same age as his father. Something about those eyes and messed up hair that made Dean melt a little the first time he saw Cain come into Bobby's shop. After meeting his mate Collette, Dean had fallen in love with her as well. For some reason, that made the Alpha all that much more attractive. In a loving relationship with an omega? Check. So hot its sinful? Double check. Committed to his omega? Another check. The crush had worn off into friendship, it was impossible not to feel attached to both of them. It was kinda weird being friends with people who were twice his age, but he didn’t have enough friends to be picky.
But she climbed directly over Cass on all fours first. She plunged her tongue deep into Cass’s mouth, suckling at her lips and losing herself for a moment in the sensations. When she had drunk her fill, she moved across Cass’s cheek and down her neck, inhaling the heady floral scent she had enjoyed so much earlier in a more intimate way.
Of course, letting Cas play in the stores of the bunker was maybe not such a good idea, but it made the guy feel like he was helping. He said it was important to catalog everything and that was true. Plus Sam and Dean had long since grown bored with the task, as much of it as they’d already done with no end in sight.
“I’m sorry you previously had uncultured friends with poor taste,” Cas said drily. “Sam is kind and smart and funny.” Cas dropped his gaze to his own plate then. “He takes after his brother, I think,” he added quietly.
When he reached his door, he burst through and found Cas staring down at Dean's dresser like it had done him wrong. Dean grabbed him by the shoulders and planted a big wet smooch on his big fat lips. Cas looked shocked and a little guilty, but he also got a dopey smile on his face.
“If you’re sure, yeah.”
He continued to pray for answers, but the most encouraging sign he’d had was hearing a gospel song when he was at the Christian book store. It was called “I Don’t Feel No Ways Tired” and it had spoken to Castiel deeply. He believed that his struggles with Dean were for good reason, that all would be revealed. He did not believe he was being tempted by the devil but rather being taught something by the Lord.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s eyes narrowed, but Cas pressed on.
“There is no need to explain, Dean. You are a man with sexual needs. It’s natural. Of course, if I had known you were interested in anal play, I could have given you assistance.”
He turned on his phone to find he had nearly a dozen messages. Realizing he’d forgotten to turn his volume back on, he did that first, then started sifting through the influx of “Thanks for the party!” messages. Sam’s also mentioned his situation and wished him luck. After that, there was only one left and Dean’s heart started to pound when he saw that it was from Cas. With a shaking finger, he pressed the screen to bring it up. His own message was there too and he reread that first, just to stall for another second.
“Do you have time to have dinner with us?” Mr. Campbell offered.
, ovaried up and asked Cass on an actual date and Cass—to Deanna’s continued amazement—had said yes.
On an ordinary day, he probably couldn’t have done it, but Dean was laughing too hard to defend himself. He was a little disappointed he would get another peek of Cas without his shirt, but he shoved that down in its box where it belonged.
He heard his brother say something to Cas about how it must have been some dream before he slammed the door. He leaned against it, knocking the back of his head on it for good measure. He couldn’t do this. He
Cas’s face was pinched and unhappy and Dean still didn’t feel like he knew where they stood. Was Cas regretting his decision?
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s happening?” Castiel asked the guard.
It stung, but Dean understood. He was one hundred percent at fault with their falling out. He’d always known that. No reason to shy away from it. He supposed he could try apologizing, but he doubted it would make a difference. Especially since he knew any apology would have to be accompanied by an explanation for Cas to accept it—and he wasn’t willing to give one.
, which was some combination.
When the living room was finished, he went to the bathroom to pack up and finally into Cas’ room. As he started carefully putting Cas’ things into boxes – much less haphazardly than he’d done his own – he realized how little there was of it. That made the doubts creep back. Was there so little because Cas hadn’t accumulated much? Or because he’d taken a lot with him?
“This here is the deed to the land and the paperwork for the bank accounts. I never told your dad, but I’d just been putting the money in an account and planning to give it back to him along with the deed on their anniversary. Instead, I ended up paying the property taxes with it after they died.” He cleared his throat and sniffed. “Now I want you to have it.”
Dean thought about that for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, I get that. If you’d have been a vamp or something...I dunno how I would have lived with that.” He looked Cas over as they sat there in awkward silence. Without thinking, he asked, “Are the rest of the angels as hot as you?”
lately? So I don't have to hock my stuff. BOOM!
He rationalized that he was good with girls, so he’d probably be good with guys too. It wasn’t like he didn’t prep girls with his hands too, just in a different place, right? Still. It
Cas shoved his phone back in his pocket, hoping she'd have some quick answers, but his phone remained silent. The ride to the restaurant was tense because the close proximity only enhanced the pheromones, but Dean did his best to distract them both. Cas tried to let himself be distracted, but it was difficult when all he could think of was how much he wanted to shove his nose into Dean's hair and scent him... and that was just for a start.
Castiel cocked an eyebrow, then looked Dean over, causing heat to pool low in Dean’s belly.
Staring down at Cas’ face to search for any signs of fear or hesitation, he saw none. All he could see was trust and love, perhaps even equal to his own, reflected back at him. He kissed Cas deeply as he rolled his hips forward and slid the first inch or two inside him. He stilled as he felt Cas tense beneath.
Throughout Bobby’s speech, Dean had noticed Cas’ brow furrowing deeper and deeper. At Bobby’s comment about chickens, he turned to Dean and asked, “You intend to make this into a farm?”
"You could make it up to me," Cas said.
“I heard it,” Gabriel said, sounding the most serious Dean had heard from him since they’d met. “Let’s go. Sam, I’ll be in touch.” With that, Gabriel snapped his fingers and disappeared into thin air.
Now that the lights were a little brighter, Cas could see when confusion gave way to arousal on Dean’s face. He was pleased with himself. Then Bal came back to make sure he was doing everything he was meant to and he knew it was time for the lap dance itself. It was difficult to keep his arousal in check, so he didn’t even try. Customers tended to tip better when the male dancers got hard, anyway.
Dean went into the bedroom to see what he wanted, then saw that the box of toys had not only already been signed for, but Cas had it on the bed and opened to display all the items inside.
“Oh, yeah? Well, you know normal me would never let you do this, right? He’s gonna hate you, in fact. Doesn’t think he’s
Castiel sat, frozen. He could not speak. He did not know if he should try to deny it, to pretend he did not understand or just confirm it and let himself be shunned. Yet another decision he was ill-equipped to make.
The last thing Dean expected—or wanted—to see was a naked Ed Zeddmore sitting cross-legged on the floor next to his equally nude man-friend. Dean suspected Ed probably felt similarly about him and Cas, but other than a widening of his eyes, Ed gave no indication he knew who Dean and Cas were, for which Dean was grateful.
As Dean looked at his boyfriend and his family and the joy in their faces, he was pretty sure Cas was right. This was the best Christmas he could ever remember.
Sam thought at first that Cas wasn’t going to answer, and in truth Cas was debating not doing so, but in the end, his shoulders drooped again and he sighed.
“Could. Do. Have for a long time. Dean, when you knelt here on the floor and expressed your ne—no. No, I won’t pretend it was need. Your
“So good for me.”
He threw the rest of the mail onto the kitchen table and went to get his shoes back on. The neighbor had been borrowing his Wi-Fi for months and that had been fine. Except now the bastard had apparently started using about a hundred times Cas’s normal usage—which just so happened to be about four times the amount allotted on Cas’s plan—and now Cas had a bill that was nearly eight hundred dollars.
Dean smiled back, happier by far than he’d been since the day Cas left for his new job. They still had a lot to talk about. It wasn’t everything he wanted yet. Cas still lived far away. But Cas returned at least some of his feelings. For now, that was more than enough.
“Dean, I didn’t say no.”
"Sam isn't the only one who can win teddy bears for his crush. Let's go!"
She gently led Cass over to the thick faux fur carpet in front of her fire place. With anyone else, it might have been a porno cliche, but with Cass, it was perfect. Cass deserved something soft beneath her, caressing her skin wherever Deanna herself was unable to reach. The rug was an altar on which Cass lay, ready to be worshiped.
“I was thinking I could speak with Jacob tomorrow and see if he can’t talk to the Campbells about allowing Sam to visit here every couple of weeks while you’re here.” He waited in the quiet, but he couldn’t even hear Dean breathing.
This was a great plan until there was a soft knock at the door and Cas called his name through it in that deep gravelly voice of his. Dean’s orgasm punched out of him and he had to ride it out before he could answer. Cas called his name again before he was done.
Dean felt his face flushing hot, but he played it off, instead of letting Sam know he’d hit a nerve. He scoffed and said, “Please. He said she was gorgeous, but then he said she wasn’t sentient. He’s clearly not husband material, dude.”
Then Castiel looked up and
He wanted to lie there and bask in the afterglow of an amazing night, but thinking about bed times tripped the booby-trap wire in his head connected to worries about needing to find a job so he could help his mom out with the rent. That would mean getting up at the asscrack of dawn every morning, most likely. His mom had said Bobby might have something, but he wasn’t keen on taking charity. In any case, Rufus was a mean old cuss and he’d be Dean’s immediate boss, so that was a consideration too.
“Wonderful. Now, Cas, I want you to take this hand.”
, Dean. Make me yours.”
Having Sam around was really helping, though, since the younger boy acted as a good buffer between them. It was much easier not to engage in longing looks when there was a constant witness to whatever they did. Sam was getting more at ease with Cas, too and had starting joking with him in a similar fashion to the way he teased Dean.
*pinches your cheeks* How're my favorite lovelies this evening, hm? Tell me all about it. ♥♥♥
“Cool. Um, anyway, it got service out on the boat yesterday, so I don’t see why it wouldn’t here. Satellite phone and all. It’s mainly the waterproof case I’m worried about.” He took a deep breath. “Wish me luck, dude.”
choose you. But if you’re too pigheaded to realize that I’m gay and have no interest in Meg, then maybe I made a bad choice!” They’d reached the driveway and Cas jumped out of the car, slamming the door behind him.
“Dean, the process is relatively straightforward—”
Dean laughed at Cas’ melodramatic hyperbole. He’d never talked like that before Dean came along and Dean liked knowing he’d had an impact. He also liked that Cas knew Sam so well – and that Cas’ culinary tastes were more similar to his own.
“Yeah?” Dean said, perking up again. “Cool. I’m Dean, by the way.” He held out his hand as he said it.
Dean saluted her. “Yes, ma’am!” he said, then headed for the plate cabinet before she could swat his behind again.
Aaron’s grin returned. “Sure am! Normally we wouldn’t do this until bed time, but since you two signed up late and don’t have anything going for a while, Ava thought it would be better if I went ahead and got you started.”
*watches stampede towards AO3...*"
“Can it be my birthday too?” she called out.
“No, I think that’s it. You’ve been a big help. Thanks.”
“Yes, but I should’ve trusted
He jumped back slightly, panting wetly. “Dean, I’m not –“
“You’re cute when you blush,” Cas said, baring his teeth in a grin as Dean led him through the front door.
“Dude, just... please, okay?” He tilted the phone as he heard his brother answer. “Hey, Sam, what’s up?”
“Actually, I didn’t specify a pair of what, did I? I could just as easily have meant ovaries... or breasts. You don’t know. You’re making biased assumptions.”
When later arrived, and they lay sated and sweaty in the middle of Cas’s bed, Dean huffed a laugh. “Thank God for bees,” he said, gratitude genuine.
It could hurt a bunch more kale, not that that was a bad thing. Fuck kale, anyway.
“I can’t believe you thought I would ever cheat on you. Dean, I loved you with every molecule in my body. I would never—” He stopped and shook his head, emotion threatening to get the better of him.
“Oh. Okay. That’s very... trusting of you.”
. I wouldn't... why would you think that? Don't you know how happy I am with you? Man, if I haven't made that clear, I've really fucked up."
paying me attention.” Dean ran a hand through his hair, huffing out a long breath. “And then the drinks started coming and I just... I let her. And I just kept letting her until we were in a cab together.”
Bright blue eyes looked at Dean and through him, searching his soul for compassion or maybe empathy. Dean had never been stranded on an island for six years, but somehow he knew just what Cas meant, anyway. Hadn’t he lived most of his life in a similar isolation?
Dean grinned. “I look pretty good for a hundred and fifty, huh?” He pulled down the collar of his shirt and revealed two small scars that were obvious puncture wounds.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What if I’m never ready?” Cas asked in a small voice.
Dean thought he was close already, but then Castiel prodded against his hole with a slick finger. Even though he stopped touching Dean’s cock while he worked the finger inside, Dean’s pleasure ratcheted up several notches. Then Cas stroked and stroked inside him until he found the right spot and Dean had a harder time maintaining the noise level. First he just gasped and swore, but pretty soon, he was spirally up and up and up. Then Castiel started using his mouth again and suddenly
Then he felt a tickle on his neck and went perfectly still. He could feel one of Cas’s hands on his hip and the other clutching his shoulder, yet there was a distinct third sensation... and, yes, a fourth, one on either side of his neck. He broke the kiss to see what the fuck.
“Yep,” Dean told him, without a trace of the guilt or shame Cas had felt previously. Then Dean gave a cocky grin and Cas felt his attraction spike up, which he hadn’t known was possible. “What can I say? He’s super hot.” Then Dean leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially. “But don’t worry, Sammy. I hear he’s got a cute brother for you.”
Dean laughed and did the same and they hurried to do up their pants before time was called. Then he hauled Cas back for one firm, chaste kiss. He slung his arm around Castiel as they strode out of the closet, not waiting for the alert.
Dean snorted. “Good enough.”
“You just want me to wait longer,” Cas accused.
“What? Oh. Oh, yes, thank you, I will,” Cas muttered, walking toward the room at the end of the hallway.
Dean smiled. His brother really was pretty awesome. “So,” he said, pulling Cas back against him. “Nap and then shower?”
Finally, he hired a motorcycle and made way up the long road to the castle, thankful that he’d convinced Castiel to get running water and electricity a few years ago, so at least he could have a hot bath. One day perhaps the drive would be passable by car, but that would take more resources than Cas was likely to want to devote to modernization. Balthazar would be lucky to convince him to get a phone or internet.
“Wait!” Dean gasped. “Wait, we need lube.”
He put down his juice and walked back in the dorm, only to find that Cas was already in the tub.
Dean blew out a breath. “Cas
“Shit.” Dean looked down and saw they both had come on their shirts.
“You’re afraid.” It wasn’t a question. Not really.
With that he was gone.
the one with the crush.”
“Yes, how...?”
“Dean,” Cas said as he retied his tie. “Report to your regular duties in the morning as usual, since I have to discuss my decision with my supervisor. When I am ready, I will send for you. Remember to address me as Mr. DeLourde during business hours.”
“Uh, hey,” Dean said from the doorway, voice low and hesitant.
“There’s two beds. You gonna bunk with me?” Dean asked. Castiel thought the question was not as casual as Dean wanted it to appear, but he couldn’t be certain.
“I’m staying off of Six Mile Road too, actually,” Cas said, with a pleased smile.
“I—that is—”
“Yes, well, if I’d brought a car, you couldn’t have given me a ride home and we wouldn’t be engaged and preparing to hire your little brother on for our staff, would we?”
Dean stared at her calmly for a moment. “Why are you picking a fight with me an hour before our party?” He leaned back against the wall and ran a hand through his hair. “ I did what felt right in the moment. I tried to enforce the rules and remind him of who was in charge without alienating him or embarrassing him too much. You’ve had fifteen years to be a parent, I’ve been at it for about six months.”
a home, he was put on a list of boys who needed one.”
Dean pursed his lips. “Yeah, all right. I mean, when you healed me, that was great, but you took off after that and fucking left me there, man.” He sighed and stared into the distance. Finally, he nodded. “All right. You wanna leave right now?”
“Languages?” Dean asked, perking up. “You speak French?”
went out with people. If he had opinions, he had yet to express a single one. And he had never, to date, shoved his tongue down Dean’s oh-so-very-willing throat.
But he couldn’t do those things. So instead he lay in the dark, clutching his blanket to him and longing for all the things his people told him were wrong.
Cas got his phone and pulled up Craigslist. Dean briefly noted the title “Bee Lovers Club!!” before Cas clicked the link and then handed the phone over. At first, Dean saw nothing weird, but as he got into the text further, he started to figure out the problem. Cas wasn’t good with subtleties at all. Dean read a few more lines with bad double entendres about stingers and honey and then he passed the phone back.
“Just read it, man. I went to a lot of trouble here.”
Then Cas sighed and said, “Dean, Sam, Charlie—this is my idiotic brother Gabriel. He was just leaving.”
“Ooh, is that a
“Dean, my love, what
“Y-yeah,” Dean said, nodded and clearing his throat in the middle. “I punched him. Knocked him out. The lady was there, so I just grabbed our shit and some food and money and we took off.” Dean looked miserable, but less like he might cry now. “I rationed the food, so it lasted a few days, but I knew it wasn’t going to last long. I was moving us from abandoned house to abandoned house -”
“It went great, Sammy. I still gotta be here another couple of months, but that’s cool. Jacob was... man, he said some really nice things about me. It was nice, you know?” He didn’t feel the least bit self-conscious confessing these things to his brother. Sam knew him pretty well.
“Why didn’t you just tell me that? Honesty, remember?”
“Shit!” Dean almost spilled his eggnog all over the ridiculous green sweater Charlie had made him wear. “Damn, man, you scar—what the fuck is that?” Dean asked, his expression going flat.
“Not really. Despite what he said, it’s going to take him hours down at the station and he gets pissed if I help people without him.”
“I wanted to see if I could get you to make the sounds from your dream. I assumed your brother would not want to hear them.”
Dean snorted. “Gabe? Come on, man, you know it’s probably got like oregano and cake sprinkles in it or something.”
“Thanks, Sammy.”
“That’s very interesting. Thank you... Ron, was it?”
“Dean, what—”
Then Xena apparently sensed his gaze because her head turned toward him and he was speared by twin beams of blue. An eyebrow cocked up, but Dean just grinned and gave her a thumbs up sign.
“I almost died, Dean.”
“What if I want things to change, Dean?”
“Oh. Wow, okay.” He chuckled lightly. “Man, Castiel, you have really changed since I saw you last, haven’t you?”
“I would love a whiskey, Dean. Thank you.” Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all.
"What?! No. Oh, fuck no. Uh-uh. I don't believe in that shit, man! Nope. Bullshit. Gimme something else."
Dean smiled, warmth suffusing him from head to toe. “Yeah. Good. And, you know, same.”
“If it means I can leave this conversation, I’m happy to,” Sam grumbled. He snatched the flowers from Dean’s hand and stalked off toward the kitchen.
Dean groaned aloud, not happy at the reminder of something he did his best to forget. He’d asked Cas on what he thought was a date. He hadn’t used the word, but he’d believed his meaning was clear. They’d spent the evening talking on their shared couch, getting closer and closer by degrees until there was barely any space between their bodies and none between the pair of bent knees—one belonging to each of them—in the middle.
The cold tone of his voice should have been a warning, but Dean didn’t catch it in time, possibly because he was starting the engine and didn’t like the weird noise Baby was making.
“Never mind. It isn’t of import. We should pack.” He walked away, looking unhappy.
Cas dropped his eyes to the floor. “Will you... sleep next to me tonight?” he asked softly.
Dean get anonymous letters in his locker and wants them to be from his best friend Cas.
“Boy, I tell you what, I already told Dean yesterday, but it is a shame you gotta go back to your village,” he said as he dished food onto plates around the table. “I’d keep you working around here as long as you wanted.”
“Why not? You told me.”
For many reasons, Dean wanted to stay the full weekend at Bobby’s and that was more than acceptable to Cas. While Bobby had no close neighbors, there was a church nearby and Cas had decided he wanted to attend services on Sunday. He was still a bit uncomfortable in English clothes, but he was getting used to it. However, he had one set of plain clothes that he thought he would wear to services.
“Is $1000 enough? You can keep the extra $800 for yourself, right?”
Mary leaned over and whispered, "He's not wrong." She sauntered to the front porch more slowly.
He stopped and shook his head, biting his lip over a disbelieving smile. Then he turned back and stepped up to Dean quickly, grabbing his face in both hands.
UPDATED 10/31/15: Complete! And very smutty.
“I guess what I’m really asking, Cas, is whether you’d want to go to dinner with me some time. On a date.” Dean could feel his skin melting off from the heat of his embarrassment, but he sat quietly, forcing himself to look Cas in the face.
Dean smiled, a weight lifted. Mary was right. Cas had done something awesome. He didn't deserve their anger. Not that Dean didn't still plan to pay him back in some way. But it wouldn't be with a fight. He stood up and kissed his mother's temple.
“No.” He was confused by the seeming nonsequiter, but he stayed quiet.
Inexplicably, as soon as he made plans to spend time apart from Dean, he immediately resented when Dean took him up on it and he didn’t want to separate right away. He’d intended for Dean to speak with the cook himself, while Castiel went to the barn and took time to himself. Instead, he had offered to speak with her
“Yeah, well, my brother’s an asshole, what can I say?” He seemed to realize how close he was standing to Cas and cleared his throat as he backed away. “Um, but anyway, as you can see, I have my own Wi-Fi.”
They got dressed for bed and tucked their dirty clothes into their packed bags to be washed later. They each had a set of “civilian” clothes laid out for the next morning. Cas had bought his own meager wardrobe on his last trip into town. Considering he’d never bought clothes for himself, Dean thought Cas had done all right. He definitely had his own flair, that was for sure. It was a lot more color than Dean preferred, but it would all look good on the brunet, Dean knew.
“Cas,” Dean said, slow and low, taking Cas by one shoulder. “Do you want this? Because I want this. I want your fantasy to become reality. Whaddya say?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s face cleared and he smiled. “Oh. It’s a pay as you go, um… basically it’s cheap and temporary and—you know what? Doesn’t matter.” He cleared his throat. “Bobby takes care of my phone. He got it for me so I’d always have a way to get in touch with him. Not that many pay phones around any more.”
Dean snorted, then full on laughed. “It was fucking awesome.” He cleared his throat. “After we get some food, you think we could try it again?”
“Uh, okay,” Dean said, turning around to face him. “What about money? I don’t think I can loan you any, dude,” he joked.
“No! I think Gabriel was right. You are far better looking than the stripper was, but after you rescued me, I could hardly stand by and let Gabriel maul you.”
“It was no trouble. Making the bed actually calms me. I used to do it for my brother.” He smiled in spite of himself. “He used to trick me into it, but then it became a habit.”
Lisa stared at him for a long moment. “Which one was Cas again?”
Dean grinned. “It is pretty great, huh?”
Dean's heart started hammering at the greeting, not needing the introduction to recognize that voice. All at once his Omega senses were tingling and he bet Spiderman never had to deal with this kinda shit. He swallowed, suddenly feeling like he didn't remember how to breathe.
come back, but Dean didn’t dare hope for that. He knew what living plain meant to Cas, maybe even better than Jacob did. There was a bit of melancholy that settled on him after that.
. So stop worrying.” Dean smiled. “Besides,
“That’s fucking delicious,” he told Baby after his first bite.
“Dean, you’re in no condition to drive. Please. I promise not to be a dick—or even speak to you, if you don’t want. But take a minute and get a hold of yourself before you try to drive, all right?”
Based on the prompt: “our best friends are dating you’re still the spawn of satan though” au
Cas gave him a curious look and picked up the coffee cup. He sipped and smiled at the buttery and bitter flavors on his tongue. Then, just at the end, a hint of spice.
are some “sexy shit,”” Cas said, complete with air quotes.
“Is Sam still coming over tomorrow?”
As the heat settled, he did feel a little calmer. He thought back to a week before, when he’d been planning to come home after pulling Cas’s plug and metaphorically pull his own. He still had the pills he’d been planning to take, sitting next to his bed. He went in and picked them up, looking at them as if for the first time. He took them to the medicine cabinet and put them back where they belonged.
Dean looked at the dog, who was staring back at him happily, tongue lolling to the side. It hit Dean then, all at once. He was losing his brother, he was losing his furry best friend, and he’d already lost the love of his—nope. Nope, nope—shit. It was too late. The tears were coming.
“Dean,” Cas panted, coming to shore after yet another wipe out. “I just don’t think I’m getting it. Can we take a break?”
“You’re handling this very well. Or maybe you’re going to blow up later.”
Cas smiled, a little more hopefully, and nodded again. "Ok, Dean. Let's try it."
to something closer to resignation. He went from looking like he was gonna smite the population of the bar—which was pretty sparse, considering the weather—to looking like he needed a hug and maybe a kitten to pet.
“Hey you crazy kids, what’ll it be? You look like you’re in Mai Tai moods. Or are you still testing driving new drinks?” Gabriel had apparently had his extra bucket of chipper this morning.
“Yes. Let’s do that. I don’t know why it feels so good, but I need you to fuck me.
He twitched slightly as he came fully awake and realized it was morning—and he had not been dreaming. Dean really was rubbing himself with Cas’s hand and rocking back against Cas’s dick.
“He’s gone,” Cas murmured.
“Sam called me, but I didn’t need him to tell me what a horrible mess I made of everything.” He rubbed his forehead with the fingers of one hand. “He told me about—Well. I didn’t know you were asking me on a date that time. I
“Nah, man. Stick to the classics, right? If it’s good, why swap it out?”
Regardless, he followed his dad as he flew down into the alley where Dean had seen the mugging. The fight was over and the original attacker was running away.
Thankfully, Cas laughed. “As tempting as that offer is, I’m sure Lisa wouldn’t approve.”
“Guess what?”
Dean grinned, hugging Cas to him. Cas for his part was also smiling, but it was one of the subtle smiles Dean wasn’t sure everyone could see. It was all in the eyes and a tiny uptick of one corner of his mouth. Dean decided to give him a quick peck.
“Is that your tribal name?”
He ached to touch Dean. He had wanted him for a long time, but had never allowed himself to consider the possibility because of Crowley. Now Cas had overcome that obstacle and suddenly being able to touch Dean was all he could seem to think about.
“I love you
"Depends. If I say yes, will you stop checking me out?"
Dean grinned. “That’s Sammy, all right. Info-sponge. I’m gonna have to remember to call him that.” Then Dean snapped his fingers. “Oh, you know, I should probably go ahead and call him. I told him I’d let him know how it went today. I should be back before it’s time to check the chicken, but if I’m more than a half hour, will you make sure it’s not overcooking?”
Dean couldn’t help the laugh that bubbled out of him, and he squeezed his eyes shut for a second before looking back at Cas with an equal seriousness. “Do you wanna risk it?”
Cas sucked in a shocked breath of air and blinked at him for a moment, before a grin broke across his face, lighting up the gloomy, dusty haze in the barn. “I love you too, Dean. I’m so glad I’m here with you.”
“Yeah, removing extraneous organs really takes it out of you, huh?” Gabriel says with a grin, but keeps his eyes on the road. “I was gonna save dinner for after, but they say you should never go shopping on an empty stomach.”
Cas snorted, pausing for an ambulance to drive by before crossing the road toward the residents apartment complex. The building was mercifully only a short walk away, tucked into a relatively quiet corner of the hospital campus on the other side of a small park. Dean already knew the route, since he’d parked in his assigned space in the lot before sprinting to the hospital’s HR office to pick up his official documents and ID that morning. Now all he had to do was figure out where exactly he would be living for the next four years, and hope that his new roommate wasn’t an obnoxious dick. He pulled his keys out of his pocket as they approached the parking lot and Cas followed him curiously toward the Impala.
Dean raises an eyebrow at that. “Well you’re about to feel a whole lot more of it.” He slowly kisses his way down Cas’s body, licking over a nipple as he passes before sliding back and kneeling between Cas’s legs. He sits back on his heels for a moment, just looking at Cas spread out in front of him, rubbing his thumbs over Cas’s hips. “I promise we’ll get there, but first…” he trails off, bending down over Cas’s cock and licking his lips as it twitches in anticipation. Dean licks a stripe up the length of it, pressing Cas’s hips down as his eyes roll up in his head and he tries to thrust upward.
The entire apartment smelled just as good as Dean had promised it would. Cas stopped in the doorway to the kitchen to bask in the aroma while Dean gave it a stir and then set to work mixing up a batch of cornbread to go with it.
“Fine, okay? You’re right. This is just weird as fuck. Jack’s asleep above us, and we’re practically fucking cuddling.”
“Good to know,” Dean replied, hastily divesting himself of the rest of his clothes. He held his arms out to the sides awaiting Cas’s approval. “Does this work for you?”
Ed blew out a breath, and then launched into his prepared spiel. “I heard about these guys a couple months back and laughed it off. I only ran across their videos again a few days ago. Trust me when I tell you they’re all pretty much along the same vein as what you saw, and I’m not laughing anymore. They travel to abandoned places like that, conjure up a death echo or something similar, and then Wulf takes it out.”
Did you get yourself dosed with truth serum while we were in there, or is your brain still frozen from your morning run?”
: I don’t know if I’d call it a masterpiece. It’s more experimental than anything I’ve written before. I’m concerned it won’t feel authentic.
“Careful, there. I think we’re gonna have to save the rough stuff for after that’s healed up.”
Cas’s smile broadened into genuine contentment as their guide welcomed them all to the Everglades and set out down the long path into the wilderness. The tram stopped frequently for the guide to point out interesting wildlife, as well as at several scheduled locations where everyone was encouraged to get out and walk right to the edge of the water to learn about the ecosystem of the Everglades. And they stopped even bothering trying to count the alligators after they hit two dozen.
Amused by how easy it had been to fluster Cas, and possibly emboldened by the caffeine finally hitting his system, Dean decided to tease him a little more. “Do
Sam’s entire face fell at Dean’s suggestive smirk. “Oh no, I don’t even wanna know.” He fumbled for the door handle and got out of the car as fast as possible, tripping over his own feet like a baby moose trying to get himself coordinated. “Why did I even bother trying to help you out again?”
Cas searched himself, and Jack felt him latch on to Dean’s nearly constant prayer to him. He was singing along to Ten Years Gone, and Cas smiled at that as he looked back up at Jack.
“Revenge is a pretty powerful motivator,” Billie says. “Which is why I’ll warn you all one more time. Keep your eyes open, and watch your backs.”
“Well, did he?” is all Dean can think to ask, even with this potential well of new information to draw from. Somehow, he'd much rather discover all of that stuff for himself.
Dean grinned at her. “Sorry for interrupting the grownups at work.”
Dean slowly came back to himself, hands balled into fists in his lap, and sent one final plea out to the universe, to Jack if he was still paying attention to these sorts of things and not busy inhabiting raindrops or whatever. As he unclenched his fists and considered getting out of the car, a light drizzle began to fall. For some reason, it made Dean smile.
“You’ve got a hairline fracture of your left humerus. It’ll heal up on its own in a few weeks, but I’m going to give you a sling to wear. It’ll take some of the pressure off the bone as it heals, and keep you from accidentally injuring it further.”
“I think I’ll use the morning to bake cookies,” Donna said idly as she let herself out into the hall. “You like cherry chocolate chip?”
Jack sighed. “No, we’re going to release all the power of creation and destruction, light and dark, order and chaos, and take ourselves out of the equation. That was always Chuck’s problem. He’d sewn himself into every open space in the universe. He couldn’t separate himself from his creation and just stand back and let it run itself. It only made him more and more intent on tinkering with it. We… we don’t want to do that.”
“So you said you got Dean’s number from a hunter?” Sam asked. It was probably a good place to begin, at least enough to fill the uncomfortable silence in Dean’s wake.
he’d been watching porn. If he was, he’d picked one with a really bizarre soundtrack. So he was just that weirded out for getting caught recognizing Dean’s shower singing and listening to the whole album. As far as Dean was concerned, there was nothing embarrassing about having good taste in music.
He scrolled up through the most recent messages-- random writing check-ins, a few discussions about procrastination, a meme he didn’t have any context for that apparently had something to do with something one of the actors had said at a con the previous weekend that he was only learning about now. He kept scrolling, looking for a few specific names until he spotted the one he’d most been hoping to see. FicFeathers had checked in late the night before for the regular evening word count update with a respectable 800 words written, and a lament about having to get up early for work in the morning. Dean himself had missed the evening update, too busy writing the last few thousand words of his own story to stop and report in on his progress.
: I think I can handle it lol
“Preferably later,” Cas added, and they descended the steps together, laughing giddily.
“Celia, this is Cas,” Dean says, giving him a nudge into the waiting chair. “He’s gonna be chilling with us because I’d run upstairs and grab him my copy of The Stand, but I’d probably throw my back out carrying it back down.”
He would’ve been lying if he said that Sam was the only reason he’d left his old life behind in Lawrence. Charlie had even helped him pick out an apartment, recommending neighborhoods that would be convenient, close to his new job, and most importantly, close enough for her to continue her campaign to convince him to come out of his shell and join her at one of the annual Unnatural conventions. He was still working up the nerve for that one. He’d only met Charlie face to face for the first time a few months earlier.
Sam gaped at her. “B-but… then why did you have some guy throw a spell at
“No paperwork for me, yet?” Mildred asks when Cas returns to her desk.
A woman’s voice he doesn’t recognize finally speaks. “You’re Sam’s brother, right?”
“Yeah, but you don’t have to listen to everything I say. And banged up ritual candles shouldn’t be romantic. I think one of ‘em’s got a bloodstain on it.”
Cas lets out a soft laugh. “Graduate school will either leave you incredibly fit, or with a permanent hunchback.”
Cas smiled and leaned in for a kiss. “We should get started, then.”
Cas winces at the thought of eating custard-filled anything for at least another hour or two, and Gabriel laughs again.
“Really, dude? Puns?”
Ed frowned at the familiar beast of a car and gave her a longing look as he shuffled in front of her. “So we’re not taking your sweet ride?”
Dean ate absentmindedly, stopping for just a moment to appreciate his own good cooking while reading and rereading the information in front of him. It didn’t really read much different from how it had the previous night.
Cas takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. “I trust you, Gabriel. That’s why I’m sitting here in the first place.”
I wouldn’t eat spiders. I am not an outlier and I very much should be counted. I’d just find a cave within Postmates delivery range. Not everyone can watch four episodes in three hours while also typing nonstop and end up with anything even remotely coherent.
“You really think that was a good idea? After she tried to kill us all and become God herself?”
It left him with a completely hollow feeling, churning around his stomach with worry and fear and way too much fancy beer. Feathers might be in trouble, or hurt, or
He wasn’t about to be happy about it, either. Hence all his grumpiness with Cas and his complaint sessions with Sam. No matter how hard he prodded for information on what he and Cas talked about while Dean had been holed up in his room, though, Sam wouldn’t break. If Cas was talking to Sam about his budding romantic feelings, he’d either sworn Sam to secrecy or Sam had decided to take a vow of silence out of spite for Dean’s increasingly irritable behavior.
The more he read, the more it seemed like Daphne’s role in everything was almost an afterthought, while Lydia was more actively involved in all of it, from the planning to the execution. If Lydia could get what she wanted, winning a little bonus prize for Daphne was just icing on the cake. Charlene had apparently tried to urge Hester to
QueenOfMoons, for example. Cas knew she lived in his general area, even if he didn’t know her real name. She went by Celeste, or Charlotte, or something like that for a while, years ago, before everyone simply started referring to her as the queen, or Your Highness. He knew she’d hosted Unnatural watch parties at her home, and that several other people he’d chatted with had attended. From what he’d gathered from their conversations, all of those people lived within a twenty mile radius of him, or near as. Many of them had also met up at Unnatural conventions over the years, but he’d never considered attending himself. Point was, he
Dean uncharitably wondered if he’d spent the last half hour rehearsing that line, before switching it to speakerphone and setting his phone on the table.
at him to see the technicolor ball of tangled thoughts flying through Dean’s mind. Dean just sat there letting it all run like a fast forward movie, hoping that Sam would get it without him having to put words to it. Sam saw all of it-- from the girlfriends he’d known about like Amanda Heckerling and Cassie Robinson to a slew of others that seemed vaguely familiar, alongside a long string of men he’d mostly never met. Lisa was in there for a hot minute, but toward the end, as he watched Dean squeeze his eyes shut as if that would make this any easier, he caught glimpses of Hell and flashes of light that resolved into Cas. Nothing but Cas, and an overwhelming feeling of warmth, safety, comfort, and happiness. Sam recognized that feeling, knew exactly what it was.
Cas frowned at him. “That makes a rather disturbing mental image first thing in the morning.”
He’d asked the question in all seriousness, but it had taken Dean completely by surprise. In an instant Dean became uncomfortably aware of just how close the two of them had drifted together on the sofa. He’d leaned in closer to follow Cas’s note taking, and Cas had leaned in closer to ask for Dean’s input, and over the course of a few hours they’d plate-tectoniced themselves right into this massive earthquake zone without even realizing it.
“You did it,” she said, clutching her wounded shoulder and trying to sit up. “You beat him, but he’s not dead.”
Dean sat and waited for a few minutes for Feathers to reply. He’d started to worry that he’d stepped too far over the line too soon, or maybe Feathers was insulted by his suggestion that anything he’d write might be shitty, even as a rough draft. All rough drafts were just that--
They’d only known each other for two days. It wasn’t like he was in a hurry. Cas would rather have Dean as a friend than make a fool of himself and have to face Dean every day at work afterward.
Dean smirked, grabbing another beer and offering one to Donna, who declined in favor of her wine. “I bet they didn’t use the word
Dean stood there picturing Cas on the other side of the wall, glaring down at the dropped bottle as if he could smite it with his mind. It was a look he knew he had an accurate visual representation for. He’d seen it a few hours ago at the hospital when Cas dropped a roll of sterile gauze and glared at it as it unrolled itself across the emergency room floor, rendering itself entirely useless in the process. At the time, Dean had been surprised it hadn’t burst into flames, Cas was giving it such an intense death glare. Though when Cas finally broke the awkward silence now, Dean had to reassess.
Cas squinted at him curiously. “Scope them out?”
“Good. Because I sent you a buttload of stuff. You have all the documentation you should need.” She paused for a moment, considering, and then added, “Though you may want to wake up early enough to share all of this with the class tomorrow…”
Cas smirks and gives a little shrug. “Heaven, apparently.”
“Oh, I am, but if I ever need this whole sack of flour to make a couple pizzas, I have screwed up so monumentally badly that you probably shouldn’t bother trying to eat them.”
Sam laughed. “You read it through four times. I think I’m getting the mandarin chicken salad.”
Dean laughs again, hand still absently moving in a soothing little circle on Cas’s back. “So, since we’re already here, tattoo first?”
He doesn’t even remember sending it, but he does remember the dream he’d been drifting into. Cas in his sack of a trenchcoat, climbing out of his new car out front of the shop, giving him a pleased smile before sprouting giant opalescent wings and taking to the skies.
As he talked, Dean’s brow furrowed deeper. Before Dean could reply to that, Cas smiled at him.
Dean knew exactly how he felt, and despite feeling awful on Cas’s behalf, he couldn’t help feeling a bit warm and fuzzy that Cas actually missed him, too. He stuck up his last magnet for today, a bee wearing a cowboy hat and tiny boots, swinging a little lasso while shouting “Bee Haw.” He added Cas’s note to his stack feeling as disappointed as Cas seemed to have been. His final note even managed to make Dean smile again.
interested in anything that would give him an excuse to spend more time chatting with Feathers. They’d been friends online for several years now, bouncing writing ideas off each other and frequently discussing their favorite show, but unlike with Charlie, Feathers had steadfastly maintained his anonymity, by his own choice. Dean understood completely, and had never pushed against his self-imposed boundaries. Hell, he had plenty of his own in place, too. But of everyone he talked to online, Feathers was the one he wished he could get to know for real.
“It’s only been two days. Give it time,” Dean replied, leaning in for a kiss. “Maybe we should try desensitization therapy. That could help.”
“You feeling all right, Cas?” Dean had asked about halfway through their lunch break. They were sitting in the library office at the big work table eating ham sandwiches and mac and cheese, and Cas realized he hadn’t said anything, nor even looked up from his tray in at least ten minutes. When he glanced up at Dean, he failed to control the panic in his eyes, and Dean held up a placating hand. “You seem kinda preoccupied, is all. I’m just worried about you.”
Jack protested that assessment. “I have a little bit of power. It’s inherent in my nature, even without a true angelic aspect of my being. Angels were always just pieces of Chuck’s own power. He created them to serve him, and that service isn’t required with the universe restored to itself.”
Dean snorted. “What, you expected us to magically become different people just because we got our personal shit together? We are who we are, Sammy, and we’re both good with that.”
“Long way?” Dean asked, suddenly wondering what he’d signed himself up for. A few steps ahead of him, Cas nodded but continued on his way.
That was Lorna’s voice, and one of the camera guys replied after a few clicking sounds.
“Riiiight,” Ed muttered and took a gulp of his beer.
Dean thought about that for a moment while he finished drying off, but the spell wouldn’t let him even think up a lie, let alone speak one. He shook his head as he hung up his towel to clear away the static fuzziness fighting the spell had left him with. “This sucks. Do you know how much of our job involves lying? Even just about small shit. We’d have been fucked if all four of us had been Obi Wan’ed this morning. How the fuck did Sam and Jack manage to function? Neither of them were this bad off.”
“That doesn’t explain the logic behind pushing Naomi up to the top of the list. From the looks of it, she’s one of the more upstanding members of her family, and from what I can tell she practically runs this hospital behind the scenes. Why would she put all that at risk just to please one relatively obscure member of her extended family?”
wanted to go on a date, with
Once he got through the opening scene, things went a lot more quickly. A typo here, a reworked clunky sentence there, and Dean had made it halfway through chapter two when the Discord notification beep sounded and jarred him out of his groove. He glanced at the time and was surprised to see it was near eleven. He’d fallen out of the habit of waking up to his alarm clock over the summer, but he still needed to be up by six to get to school on time in the morning. He wasn’t sure if he should feel relieved that he wouldn’t be awake to see any notifications from Feathers making comments on his fic, or disappointed that he wouldn’t be able to start reading Feathers’ story until tomorrow evening. He marked his place in his own editing with a hastily typed comment that he hoped Feathers would find amusing (
Dean doesn’t notice the man in hospital scrubs who’s come outside to help him at first. He’s so busy trying to help Sam get to his feet without sending him into another paroxysm of agony that it’s actually Sam who spots the doctor first.
He wasn’t sure what possessed him to draw a smiley face on the note, too. Like he was texting and leaving emoticons even in handwritten notes. He was pretty sure Cas would appreciate it, either way. As he walked out to the car, Dean was still smiling to himself and half wishing he could be there to see Cas’s reaction for himself.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh at that.”Meg might be a demon in scrubs, but Daphne at least seems like a decent person. Meanwhile I’m afraid if I look at Lydia too long she’s gonna try to baby trap me. I don’t know what sort of shift changes they have planned, but I don’t see how it could actually get much worse.”
Cas sighs and follows the trail of cardboard, peering into Gabriel’s office to see six boxes labeled
“Then what do we do when they actually show up?” Ed asked, to which everyone else gave a shrug.
The drive to Illinois took most of the day. It could’ve been a lot quicker, but in addition to Dana’s, they hit a steakhouse on the outskirts of Chicago for dinner before swinging back south toward their destination. Dean bypassed the Astoria Motel where a mirrored ceiling shattered by Cas’s angelic voice had once nearly killed him. He pointed it out as part of their trip down memory lane, but pulled up at a different motel clear across town with the excuse that it would be a shorter drive back to the barn in the morning. Their room was a lot less shabby, and a lot less pay-by-the-hour feeling than the Astoria, so Dean felt it was a win all around.
“Every attending you’ve worked with in the last week gave recommendations on how to partner you up for the inevitable split, and the administrative department read all those glowing reports from their highly esteemed staff members, including yours truly,” he added, holding one hand over his heart and doing his best to look humble.
Gabriel rolls his eyes. “I have a spare room. You’re more than welcome to it. I’m about six blocks closer to the hospital than Nick is, too, if you need a bigger carrot.”
Dr. Novak gives Dean a considering look, and then turns his attention back to Sam’s shoulder, covered in a large, menacing black dog haloed in blue with glowing red eyes, whose body continues around to his back.
Gabriel makes another turn and that’s when Cas sees it. Winchester Tattoo. Dean’s shop. He wonders how he could’ve forgotten Dean so quickly, but forgives himself since his entire life had been upended in the last two hours.
“Are you coming home with me?” Mary asked. “I mean, obviously you don’t need a ride, but I definitely wouldn’t mind the company on the long drive, either.”
Cas glanced over, keeping most of his attention facing forward even though Dean suspected Cas wasn’t really engrossed in the show any more than he was.
“Dean, it’s good to see you, brother,” Benny says, grabbing Dean up into a quick hug and patting him on the back.
“So we all agree that whatever this is, it’s not a coincidence that they’re gonna be a few miles away tomorrow night,” Sam said, shutting the laptop and leaning back in his seat.
Cas smiled at him, raising an eyebrow in response. “I got my masters in library science at the University of Maryland. I got a job working for a federal agency after I graduated, but I found the work rather soul crushing. I really wanted to work at a school, but I’d all but given up finding a position. For a while I was considering moving back home to Chicago and hoping for better luck when this job opened up.”
Cas maintained the spell, continuing the chant until the stream of emerging souls slowed to a trickle. Wulf took each of them in turn until the spectral crowd had nearly entirely dissipated. At long last, the final soul to emerge stood a foot from Wulf and simply grinned at him. The man looked young, not the old man Wulf had described to them. But there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that this was Louis.
“We don’t know what sort of spell the witch attempted to cast,” Cas told Dean. “Or if it’s still potentially active.”
“With a plate and everything,” Donna added with a knowing smirk.
Jack studied her for a moment, finding the location in her memories and ensuring a truck big enough to contain all her belongings would be waiting for her there. If he happened to drop a phone, a room key for a nearby motel and one of Sam and Dean’s magical credit cards on the front seat of the truck, he was sure she wouldn’t be too upset about it. Jack knew he hadn’t made her life any easier over the years. His birth had ripped a hole into the alternate universe she’d been trapped in for the better part of a year. It was only fair to make this next phase of her life as painless as possible.
“That sounds medically unlikely, and yet entirely plausible,” Cas replied, finishing the last bite of fish.
“Really? Their account is called UnnaturallyEvil?” Sam said with a scoff. “If the dude really is a demon, that’s a bit on the nose.”
“You were right, Dean,” Cas says, one arm flung over his face.
Sam shrugged. “Something weird is definitely going on there. I figured of everyone, Jack has the fewest deep, dark personal secrets. He’s got the least to risk here, at least among the four of us, and it seemed like a good case to give him some field experience without a lot of physical danger.”
“If it’s any consolation,” Cas said, gathering his dirty clothes and following after Dean, “I sincerely doubt we’ll encounter an actual bear.”
“It certainly appears that way,” Crowley confirmed. “I have no idea what you did, or how you dug up that dirt, but I knew setting you little hounds on the scent of a scandal was the most efficient course of action.”
Cas stabbed at his salad with his fork and grumbled. “Sometimes I wonder.”
, so you can officially lay off, right?”
Dean waited a beat, dissecting Cas’s tone and finding a true apology mixed in with a bit of disappointment, as if he’d really been enjoying Dean’s slightly off key mumbly shower singing. He thought about just picking up the song again, or making a self-deprecating joke, but he was almost done rinsing off anyway and decided the best course of action was to finish up quickly as if it hadn’t mattered in the least. He hoped it would set Cas at ease, anyway.
Cas stood there dripping and blinking at Dean’s retreating back as the shower room door clicked shut behind him. “Okay, Dean,” he said into the steamy air, but Dean was already long gone.
Dean snorted and dug through the drawer for the pizza cutter. “You had a lot of important decisions to make for the first time. I was just glad you found stuff you like.”
“Thank you all, again,” Wulf said, looking from Ed to Sam to Dean and finally to Cas. “And good luck with your future endeavors. If there’s ever anyone in Heaven I can give a message to on your behalf, just give me a call.” A grin spread across his face, and he and Louis disappeared.
