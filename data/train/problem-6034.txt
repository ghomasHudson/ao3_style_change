“you look good though. you’ve gained weight,” she said and she looked like her eyes were filling with tears. pepper was very sensitive in general, but once tony had brought up the courage to tell her he had cancer, they couldn’t talk much about it without her tearing up. she had protective feelings over the boy; she was five years older than him.
It took the A.I. quite a while to have the footage of Steve's and Tony's bedroom show up on screen, as if he'd been thinking about whether Peter should see or not.
He decided he'd heard enough, and left his spot in front of their door to run to his room and bawl his eyes out. It was clear to him that dad and pops were getting a divorce, why wouldn't they? It had happened to a lot of kids at his school before and just because Peter's parents were Avengers didn't mean they were any better at relationships. They were probably even worse.
“it’s alright. you’d probably rather be pushing through with those papers,” the man guessed. upon tony’s nod, he told him to do just that.
“i was going to drive on monday, my car’s still getting fixed and they’re hoping for it to be finished by lunch.” the fact that steve’s truck was gone hadn’t gone unnoticed to tony. he hadn’t seen it at its usual spot for a while.
steve thought it weird that tony was cutting him off like that suddenly, and also that his voice suddenly seemed shaky. “it’s four in the afternoon, why?”
they woke up well rested the next morning and somehow, steve’s world had regained some color overnight.
"I don't understand," steve said then, putting his arm around tony's chest and kissing the top of his head again.
from jarvis, tony knew that steve woke up at around two in the morning every night and lay awake for about an hour. steve had mentioned it to the man too, but he'd not been able to pin down an exact time. so yeah, tony usually made sure to pretend he was sleeping while steve read a book next to him to lull himself back to sleep.
this led them to talk about where they’d grown up, gone to school and soon a warm sense of nostalgia filled the air, probably because tony kept quiet about his age and health issues.
it seemed to be a general thing in the apartment because tony too was feeling fantastic. he pulled steve out of a last slumber by lying on top of him and kissing him softly at first and getting more thorough as the man started to wake up more.
and so bucky told andrew about his job in advertising and that he was a first generation immigrant with a physics professor as a dad and a mom in human resources.
“well. it’s pretty much being raised by a nanny until you’re old enough to go to the finest institutions around the world.”
the teenager blushed red as he sat down on steve’s lap again. “i’ve had them for a while, they’re kids underwear.”
Peter had felt similarly to his dad. It'd been a good few weeks since he'd spent quality time with his pops who was usually 'just catching up with an old friend'.
the counsellor kissed tony’s cheek goodnight, and the teenager figured it was better than nothing before getting on the next train back to manhattan.
the teenager blushed a deep red. the treatment had taken a lot out of him then, and there were a lot more embarrassing moments he all but wanted to forget.
tony knew steve was going to get mad at him for not telling him before. "I mean I know I had a nightmare but I have no idea what it was," the man said carefully.
steve nodded his head in response and by the time they arrived at his apartment, tony had already arranged for pepper to stay with him for a while the week after so he wouldn’t be alone. not that he would have been, but pepper didn’t need to know that.
steve worked the buckle of tony’s belt as if he’d done it a million times and pulled down his boxers with one slick move before taking the tip of his dick into his mouth.
“you okay?” steve asked after a while, when tony was softly caressing the strands of blond on top of his head.
tony sat up a little, then turned around, kneeling with steve’s legs between his and thanking himself for getting the big armchair when he furnished the apartment. steve reached around tony and held the small of his back so tony wouldn’t roll back; it’s what he did when his niece or nephew sat on his lap like that.
tony finished up his sources and put his laptop away, then cuddled further into steve’s lap. “you just finished about a weeks worth of work in three hours,” steve realized out loud.
“i’m sixteen. but hey, i’m more mature than steve,” the teenager said with a smile and took a long drag from his cigarette.
tony came back outside with a pair of black boxers and a shirt on he would sleep in. his naked mood had disappeared when he had seen that he’d had blood in his urine, meaning he’d have to go see his doctor the next day.
“oh,” tony said and took the pizza carton out of steve’s hands, placing it on the dining table before grabbing them some sodas. “don’t worry, everyone i’ve told so far didn’t let me out of their sight the first few weeks.”
“lunch is served,” a butler got their attention after a while and the whole party got up to walk to the sun deck.
steve laughed out loudly at that, almost spitting out his beer. tony took a pack of cigarettes from his fleece jacket and lit one, glaring at steve while at it.
tony shook his head in response. “chemo is for when you’ve tried everything and things don’t get better. well, it is for chronic leukaemia, anyway. i wasn’t given a treatment until a few months later. what they do is keep your blood cell count supervised and when the cancerous cells spike and your general well-being gets worse, they’ll try a treatment to make it go back down. chemo is more for acute danger of death,” the boy explained and steve’s tears were back. tony was so well spoken, so mature and it hit him way harder than it should have. “the five year chance of survival is 83 percent, but that’s mainly because most people who get diagnosed are seventy or older.”
“i uh…” tony leaned in against steve’s chest. “i peed blood, i have to go see my doctor first thing tomorrow morning.”
“i uh. i fled from my parents tonight because i can’t stand being in a room with them for too long. and all i’ve ever wanted was to have a loving family. and now here i am and get to see the epitome of what i’ve wished for my entire life.” tony turned around again and steve kissed the top of his head while wrapping his arms around the boy.
The boy was just about to turn four years old at that point, and he easily adapted to Steve being his other dad as well, no questions asked.
“i’ll tell them and invite you over once i’ve gotten in a routine but i’ll be mostly out of conscience for a couple days. i don’t want you to see me that way.” the teenager started biting on his finger nails then, anxious about steve’s reaction.
tony sat down in an armchair in the corner of steve’s room, feeling dizzy from the exhaustion of climbing up five flights of stairs to get there.
“the terrace must be amazing when it’s warm out,” steve added when they sat down on the couch with two glasses of wine and the rest of a way too expensive bottle on the couch table.
Thank you, Steve, so much, for becoming my family after I had none left. And, oh gosh, thank you, Steve, for being the best Pops I could've ever wished for my little Peter.
after dinner, when tony was starting to get a bit tipsy, he sat with jim , pamela and sarah as he drank his last glass of wine (steve had told everyone he was twenty one for other purposes), steve held adison close to his chest as he danced with her and something in the way that the man was so big and the girl was so small made tony’s eyes fill with tears.
tony’s heart made a summersault at that. that was adorable. “of course it is. did you eat something?”
“thank you, it’s my favorite,” tony said sheepishly and the pair fell into another long conversation about the stars and the universe and the ice caps and polar nights and what not.
tony stepped out on the balcony and wiped a few tears from his eyes before he heard someone step out of the door too. he turned around quickly and wiped at his eyes again when he saw steve, then quickly turned around again. who was he kidding? steve had seen and his shaking shoulders weren’t exactly subtle.
the group of five ate a big lunch, during which tony got progressively more drunk and steve and bucky began to like andrew.
tony wiped over his face one last time before he nearly dropped his wine glass when sarah appeared in the door to tell him goodnight.
"Steve," Tony said and huffed out a breath. "For the three and a half years that I've known you, you have been nothing but a blessing to my life. Gosh, this will sound so cheesy but before I met you, I didn't even know how to enjoy life. Well, I thought I did, truth be told, but you taught me the right way. There will never be anything that I love more than a lazy Sunday afternoon with you and Peter, while we teach you about the modern technology of the 21st century.
tony gave the things steve said a lot of thought. but no matter what way he twisted and turned the ‘problem’ around, he always concluded that he wanted to be with him.
since tony's nightmares had started, he'd figured out that during those 30 minutes, he didn't dream, and so he'd fallen into this exhausting routine just before steve and him had started to sleep in the same bed.
the three of them sat out on the balcony with a beer when finally, tony could ask bucky what he did.
the diagnosis had been nothing new. tony was to take things slowly, maybe even slower than he already was taking them. chemo was yet unspoken of. however, the teenager did have to try eating more, he was ten pounds underweight once again, and he had only just gained fifteen pounds 3 months before.
“no no, not at all,” tony assured. “there’s someone i want you to meet. he studied psychology at harvard and uh… we’ve been dating for a few weeks.” and now tony’s heart was beating rapidly but only until he saw howard smile at maria.
“yeah but hey, i shouldn’t be using your counselling during the semester break, right?” tony raised his eyebrows, not knowing what he was doing.
“i’ll explain over dinner tomorrow night, okay?” when steve nodded in response, tony finally leaned in and worked his tongue between steve’s lips. steve needed some time to think about this; tony knew from experience that after everyone has revaluated what they’ve been told, things would be very slightly easier to talk through.
lunches with his mother before he’d gotten cancer had been fun. they would go to the most exclusive places and talk and talk and talk. whereas since they knew that tony would die an early age, maria had tensed up a lot, gotten into drinking and who knows what else. the teenager was always glad when those meals were over and he wouldn’t see his parents again for a while. at least while he wasn’t out of it that’s how things tended to be.
Bucky was there, too. They were out in the woods and there were tents around and planes flying over them. Had his pops gone camping with Bucky and met someone there?"
“it’s a pleasure. these are for you.” steve handed maria a bouquet of white roses, having remember tony tell him her preference. “and of course, for the father we’ve got some cigars.” and steve pulled out a pack of five very rare cuban cigars after checking with tony if it would be okay.
“wow,” andrew said, honestly stunned. “i have always admired hard working youth. what do your parents do?”
"well that's what people do in a relationship tony," steve said. he wasn't reacting to tony's fresh set of tears and tony was glad.
the teenager stepped closer to his boyfriend and used his thumbs to wipe away the few tears that had already cascaded down steve’s cheeks. wow, no reaction of anyone he’d told had ever touched him like steve’s did right then. “is that where all those bruises come from?” steve’s voice was weak, hoarse and so unlike himself.
“sure is. there’s a rooftop terrace with an outdoor kitchen as well. i used to sleep out there a lot during my first months here.”
“there’s always a place here for you if you need anything honey,” sarah said and kissed the boy’s cheek before going inside.
On the third day with Pops alone, Peter was picked up at school by his uncle Clint, rather than his Pops. Clint wouldn't tell him why Steve hadn't been there to pick him up, and the seven-year-old became very, very suspicious.
the three of them said goodbye to the millionaire who invited them back for the summer, telling tony his assistant would call him for an appointment.
“come here baby,” steve said and leaned against his desk, crossing his arms in front of his chest all teacher like.
tony stepped closer to his boyfriend, thinking he would ask him out on a date leading up to sex hopefully.
the class was quite interesting that day as oppose to most other days. tony absolutely loved seeing steve talk about things he was passionate and that he knew like he knew the home he grew up in.
“come on, it’s okay rhodey. i did get up by myself, didn’t i?” said tony with a slight smile but james was in no such mood.
steve came back into the room, still naked of course. he rummaged through his bag, finding a new pair of jeans and a t-shirt that he put on right there. “do you want to eat breakfast?” he asked tony.
it was an hour later when tony and steve climbed into the teenager’s lamborghini with a month’s worth of the drug in a bag steve placed in the trunk.
tony was exhausted, to say the least. he'd been working hard for a few days and his naps throughout the day had become less and less. his stark watch, the thing he relied on to wake him silently next to steve, notified him that it needed to be charged at about eight in the evening. so tony plugged it in right when steve came walking into the lab.
tony opened his arms in order to be lifted into an embrace, which howard understood and they hugged for a while before tony was put into an arm chair by his bed.
“i guess,” tony shrugged with a smile. it felt weird to him, those two worlds combined but given the fact that steve was around, it would be okay. and besides, he hadn’t lounged around and eaten and drunk a weekend away in a long time. “you okay with that stevie?”
the date was cut short when steve got a call from his sister asking him to babysit in the afternoon for she had a job interview she’d been hoping for.
he could tell pepper was shocked that steve was in the know; tony mustn’t have shared a lot before his counselling had started, which didn’t come as much of a surprise really.
“he’s 25 and a counsellor in the engineering department. sometimes he gives lectures in human factors. we checked, it’s all legal.” tony was suddenly worried now that his parents might not approve of the age difference or their statuses at school.
the two sat like that for a while as tony calmed himself down from what he didn't know had upset him, he just knew it needed to get out of his system and he'd never let himself get comforted by steve before. it was wonderful.
I don't know why I feel the need to keep mentioning that steve is attracted to tony for his maturity, guess the thing is internally focalised on steve during those times...
“hey, you got dressed,” steve pouted but then he looked down at himself with a smirk. he was wearing tony’s briefs plastered in toy story characters.
“since it’s been two years since we’ve tried number 3, i want to suggest another four weeks on that. it was your most effective of all seven.”
steve had officially been with tony for a few weeks now. he loved to cuddle at night, to fall asleep with tony in his arms.
steve’s torso was so perfect tony could feel an erection build against the man’s legs. steve chuckled. “you’re easy to please,” he commented.
tony nodded then and closed his eyes. “thank you,” he whispered after a while. “for being here, i mean.”
Peter shook his head. "No. Can... can you show me what he's doing?" Now Peter knew that this was a very, very hard violation against his Pops' privacy, but he was worried and just had to know what was going on.
steve nodded slowly and lifted tony’s chin up so he could look him in the eyes. “yes. if you want to get off, i’ll do you the pleasure, but i want you to be fully there when…”
so tony slid off the armchair, kneeling in front of it while steve moved to the edge. the teenager pulled steve’s pants off and found no boxers, making him look gleefully at steve before sliding him into his mouth.
“do you live alone?” the counsellor asked a few minutes later when he was driving tony back to his apartment.
Steve found his son a few minutes later. The boy was sitting on his and Tony's bed, sobbing silently while looking at the photo album in his lap.
“well this turned on me quickly,” tony said with a whine and gulped down the last sip of his champagne.
"Jarvis, where is Pops?" Peter asked when Clint had told him to sit on the couch and watch TV until Pops would come to the living room.
“yeah. more than okay,” tony said with a smile and rubbed his head against steve’s shoulder for a mere second.
it was great having steve at the oncology centre with him as tony realized. he knew some of the faces in the waiting room; moms with kids who had cancer, kids with moms who had cancer and the odd person who came alone.
“but the vacations are nice. journeys like this are a bliss and the mansions around the world are nice. my parents do have a gift in buying nice homes they never use.”
the two had yet to have their first time together, or tony’s first time with a man after all. however, steve enjoyed this cuddling base they shared.
tony ejaculated into steve’s mouth, moaning up against the ceiling when he pulled at the blonde’s hair. steve gently pulled tony’s boxers back up and lay his cheek against the soft skin of his lower stomach and tony lay his head back down against the pillow, commanding his house system to shut the blinds and project the night sky against his ceiling.
this sparked conversations about the rogers growing up, jim’s family, about steve’s past in ballet for a few years which tony definitely had to touch back on.
“he’s uh… he’s got cancer and i’m worried because he hasn’t been here all week and he’s not answering my texts or calls.”
howard chuckled. “i figured. our intellect requires women the same age or older men. people who don’t bore us.”
it was later that afternoon when steve and tony were on the way back from dropping howard and maria off at the airport. tony had insisted he needed a change of scenery and so he was going to spend a few days in steve’s apartment. he had yet to meet bucky as well and that made him nervous.
if steve hadn’t said something about being hungry, tony might’ve never chewed on the smallest piece of pizza he could find and left the rest to his ‘date’.
“i know what happened the last time tony but you know how good you felt afterwards, for months.” yeah, howard had called dr. banner and told him the whole thing, worried that it might be some sort of complication with the treatment. tony still had to forgive him for that.
and tony breathed another breath of relief. “have you…” maria asked then, because they’d never had to have ‘the talk’ with tony. he’d been moved out by the time he reached that stage of puberty, and with the cancer and all there had been some things in the way.
“you’re so small,” steve said all flustered and with a blush before tony threw on the shirt that was so big on him it went down to the middle of his thighs.
steve left tony’s apartment building after the teenager had taken a quick shower, after which he made sure to take his meds unseen by steve, and put on a suit and coat, for his mom would be waiting with a limousine just outside.
they kissed way too long for this not to lead somewhere, and so tony grinded his hips against steve’s body. steve pushed him back a little before he himself got a hard on.
the two drove out of boston and steve stopped the car at a little restaurant by a rough looking part of the coast. “we’re getting you brunch,” he announced to tony.
“i love sleeping in bed together, it lets me sleep so much better,” tony said as he sat on the bed, then asked steve to give him a sleep shirt.
“i had just moved here. during my first week someone pointed out a big bruise on my upper arm. i hadn’t realised the bigger, black ones on my back because i never look at my back.” tony shrugged then. “and it’s not like i was seeing anyone at the time who could’ve pointed them out to me. i had turned fourteen only two months before.”
“maybe you can talk to my dad sometime, i’m sure he could put in a good word for you with a few people. you guys can come to one of our summer parties,” tony suggested. this was normal talk for the kids he grew up with in all those boarding schools. money stayed within those families through a lot of networking, and it seemed like every millionaire knew twelve others, and so on, and that environment was very familiar to tony, it was where he felt most homey.
he was beyond tired; sleeping had been hard again and eating was becoming way too filling way too fast.
the teenager lay his head on the man’s biceps and steve held his stomach close with his other arm. tony still hadn’t completely calmed down from his sadness spell a few minutes back, and steve’s biceps grew wet with a few stray tears out of the teenager’s eyes while they were trying to fall asleep.
“you could go stay with your parents again, or maybe you have someone else to take care of you, here?” dr. banner asked tony, glancing at steve swiftly.
the teenager woke up when steve got out of bed to head to the ensuite bathroom stark naked. “nice ass,” tony called after his boyfriend before lifting the blanket off himself.
the teenager was about to wallow in self pity when steve spoke up: “wait, when did you start smoking?”
“i have cancer steve,” tony whispered and he’d never seen tears form quicker in someone’s eyes than in steves’ right then. “i’m okay though. it’s chronic leukaemia and it’s going to be a whole while until it gets bad.”
“w-… well that would be great,” bucky said, not believing his ears. “isn’t howard stark’s son still a kid though?”
steve watched in amazement at how tony didn’t look up anything while writing his papers, merely images to illustrate what he thought.
"I mean I... I heard you fight and now dad is gone and you were crying and why are you kissing that lady, pops?" Peter whispered the last part and Steve used his thumb to wipe away the boy's tears.
“well, we can not leave a stark without a lunch invitation, can we? i’ll send a boat in about a half an hour, okay? your company can shower on the laura.”
the counsellor had sessions with students each morning, but no on campus work to do in the afternoon, so he kept tony entertained while the teenager threw up from time to time and lay on the couch, not moving most of the day. they had told him that tony would be better, the first week was always hard and steve tried hard not to be worried.
Tony told Steve that he couldn't dwell in the past forever, that Bucky was a changed man now and that he couldn't expect him to not be jealous when Steve spent all of his time with his best friend.
“how are you holding up?” andrew’s wife had died of a brain tumour only a few years before tony was diagnosed and although it seemed controversial, the man cared a lot about his friend’s kid.
“actually, this isn’t really about us. a few teachers have told me that you’ve seemed absent and tired lately, and i’m checking in on you as a counsellor,” steve said with a smile into tony’s smug brown eyes.
maria wasn’t drunk and coming to think of it, she had come out of rehab just a few weeks back. he and steve had moved all the alcohol tony had in his apartment into steve’s for just that reason.
“honestly?” tony asked. and when steve nodded he took a deep breath. “i was scared out of my mind. i was alone, 3000 miles away from my parents.”
“don’t worry, i can take you,” steve said with such clarity in his voice that tony nodded in response.
tony was sobbing softly into steve's musky shirt now, wrapping his arms around the man's torso while he was being held closely. it didn't feel like enough touch to him though. "can I..."
when they were both done, tony having swallowed the load, the teenager sat back up on steve’s lap. the man was completely naked aside from his socks now. he pulled the hem of tony’s sweater up as well, looking at the thin torso in front of him with affection.
“so, how are you, how’s business?” tony asked and pulled out a cigarette when he saw andrew signal over the butler holding a cigar box just behind him. the young man, who couldn’t be much older than steve, held out a lighter to first light tony’s cig, then andrew’s cigar. starks were served first. that was that. steve and bucky sat down on either side of tony, each  handed a glass of champagne right away and offered a cigar that both declined.
“i know what you’re thinking. and no, i don’t have a messias complex. he’s not bound to die soon so i’m just trying to enjoy and live in the moment.” but then tears started to fall from steve’s eyes and bucky looked over at him in concern. “he’s just a kid but his mind is that of a beautiful and challenging man and i-“ steve broke off, couldn’t grasp his emotions properly and didn’t even know why he was crying right then.
tony rose up the moment he reached clarity in his mind. “thanks,” he said with a smile. “what time is it?”
tony tried to stay awake for as long as he could, but he crashed against steve’s shoulder before the bells rang midnight.
steve chuckled in response because he didn’t know how else he could react. and if he was being honest, tony seemed ever more so attractive than all of the girls he’d had appointments with over the last semester.
“stark, is that you?” a jet ski motor was running to tony’s right, who turned to find a family friend with a girlfriend not much older than tony himself smile at him from the water.
to steve, seeing tony dressed so warm anyone else might overheat was painful. “i’ve been feeling a bit off ever since you told me,” the blond admitted.
tony slept bad for most of the night and he was exhausted by the time he spotted steve at the back of the counsellor’s favorite café in the village.
“follow me,” bucky told tony and led him down a corridor into steve’s bedroom. paintings were hung over most of the wall and he too had an ensuite bathroom, something always appreciated by cancer patients.
After a few minutes, his pops did walk into the living room, sniffed, and told him he would be down at Bucky's for a few minutes and that if anything was to come up, he should tell Jarvis to tell him to come.
the stark’s penthouse at their very own tower in the middle of manhattan was already neatly prepared and sterilized for tony’s arrival and for the first time in weeks, he felt alone. like really alone.
after a while, tony moved to sit back up and steve whimpered in response to the touch lost. “sorry stevie, i gotta pee,” tony smiled and got up, walking to the bathroom while steve watched him from behind.
at the rate he was going the first three semesters, the billion-dollar heir (who probably would be an heir of no sort, let’s be real) would have had his bachelor’s by the end of the following semester. but his doctor had told him to cut back a little before it was time to book classes, for his dysfunctional blood cell count was rising slowly, and another spike was to be expected soon.
"Is it because of me?" Peter asked and wiped his nose with the back of his hand, looking up at pops.
tony was glad to be asked questions, that way he could eat more slowly than everyone else who seemed to gulp the food down like it could be taken from them. “i think i learned it when i moved out. and one of my nannies always insisted i help her cook,” tony told sarah with a smile. he already liked the woman. “and my parents used to produce all sorts of weaponry, but we’re slowly expanding into different fields.”
things had changed that way since tony’s diagnosis. his mother invested a lot more time into seeing him. who could say they saw their parents more in college than in high school?
the teenager almost fucking cried when he said goodbye to steve as he left the apartment shortly before his parents’ arrival. “it’s only a few days,” steve assured. tony was sure his parents wouldn’t react badly to his coming out. he’d grown up with gay family friends and had never heard a single homophobic word out of howard and maria’s mouth, not even jokingly. they were young parents after all, barely older than steve himself. and also, with steve, the teenager had a lot to show for.
the teenager did piss his bed again, but he had expected it, practically waited for it to happen and successfully wasn’t all upset like the last time. howard seemingly had too, because the mattress beneath the sheet was covered in plastic and a fresh set of pajamas was ready inside the ensuite bathroom already.
“hi there,” tony said. he was still wearing the exclusive suit he’d put on in the morning, and steve had to admit that the boy looked beautiful.
"Oh Peter, sometimes when you live together, you get into arguments. But that doesn't mean we don't still love each other to pieces. And no, not even the argument was because of you honey. And the album... I think you're in for a history lesson," Pops said and braced himself not to break down again about Peggy's death.
“looking good out there,” a confident voice said and steve chuckled before changing into sweats and a puffer jacket a few feet away.
“will you dance with me?” adison asked and tony knew he shouldn’t be doing that because to be honest, he might fall over anytime now.
“wow,” tony said before getting up and doing the same, hoping steve wasn’t looking at him and making sure he wouldn’t see his back for now; it was bruised heavily from nothing major; the pit falls of leukaemia. the teenager’s arms and legs and stomach were too, but he blamed it on boxing lessons when steve asked.
tony liked seeing steve’s face from up there while the blond loved him how he’d never been loved before. it didn’t take long for tony to come, and the teenager was shocked when steve swallowed the load catapulted to the back of his throat.
tony wasn’t wrong to say the least. when he got back into his apartment all he could do was fall back asleep on his bed, despite having only been awake for a few hours. it took him a while to realize this could have to do with the medication and made sure to call the doctor about it soon.
steve chuckled in response. “i slept in the guest room, hope that’s okay.” he took a breath. “i figured you’d sleep better in your bed than on the couch and… i move slowly with people.”
Pepper had Peter put on his little suit and kept him busy, playing with him, briefing him on how he'd bring in the rings and where to stand while they were giving the vows.
tony himself loved steve’s body, obviously. but he also loved the sense of protection he got around the man, the adult guidance. and at the same time steve was so sensitive and unafraid to show his emotions and that the teenager loved too.
when they were done with breakfast, tony lay down on the couch between his parents, head in howard’s lap and legs in his mom’s.
he would have loved to daydream about steve, because as of the mit website, a graduate student was allowed to have a relationship with a staff member that wasn’t of authority to them.
he met steve sort of early the next morning, and they had a cup of coffee first before going for a walk in central park, all the while tony hoped his fatigue and nausea wouldn’t make an evil return now.
steve pulled tony up by his hips so the erection sprung at him just in front of his face. he unbuckled the boy’s belt, removing his pants and briefs without commenting on the latter; they had a toy story print on them. “take care of yourself first,” steve whispered.
"you can get it tomorrow," steve said and kissed tony's forehead before laying him down on his side of the bed. after taking off the man's shoes, socks and sweatpants, he lay down next to him and cuddled him close, falling asleep in peace.
after the pair had brushed their teeth and done all other night time duty, they lay down in bed where tony told steve to put his arms around him from behind.
“of course, balcony’s right through there. the kids need to go to bed now anyway,” pam said and so while tony got up, her and jim went over and took their kids into their arms before carrying them to down the hallway of the apartment.
it was eight in the morning, and tony quickly called his doctor to let him know he was due for a checkup, receiving an appointment only an hour later.
that afternoon tony lost his virginity in one of the countless hotel rooms that lined waikiki beach. the girl’s name was olivia, and she too cried upon seeing the boy’s back after sex.
tony never ended up sending that message because once his boyfriend walked in and pulled down the toy story boxers enough to take the teenager into his warm mouth, he effectively took his attention off the phone.
“when i first got-“ tony stopped himself there. he couldn’t tell a counsellor who didn’t know he had cancer that he started smoking when he first got diagnosed. “when i started at mit, actually. it’s not a big habit though, sometimes i just really get an urge to smoke one.”
“why wake up from a world like that? it is your life isn’t it? not like that’s gonna change,” bucky wondered.
so yes, tony took advantage of said workshop and made a few test runs for a possible drone he might be using for his master thesis before falling asleep on the couch situated closest to his desk.
the boy slept for twenty hours straight when they landed in boston early the next morning. he had two days until his mom would get lunch with him, and tony was a bit relieved that he wouldn’t be watched regarding his eating habits, because eating made him feel a lot sicker than hunger did.
the counsellor lasted longer than tony had, for he also had to direct the boy with what to do from time to time, but he loved it considering it was tony’s first time doing this.
“tony,” steve said and then sighed. “can you leave us some time to think this through? just… give me a few days. i don’t want to take advantage of you this way.”
he was woken by howard a few hours later. “hey kid, it’s probably time to get ready. steve will be here in a half an hour.”
tony had gotten skinnier again and his torso was bruised severely. his boyfriend moved his lips down the boy’s torso, all the while holding him tight around the waist before kneeling in front of the boy.
upon waking out of unconsciousness, tony saw his best friend cry for the first time in a long time, since shortly after he’d told him about his illness. he sprung from the bed to throw up in the adjacent bathroom, not making it completely but nevertheless not bad for being thrown into wake just seconds before.
What did not help Peter's fear of becoming a divorce kid was that his dad had to go on a five day trip to Los Angeles and that Bucky was over even more once he'd left.
“hey uh tony,” steve said when he shook the boy’s small frame awake the next morning. “your phone rang, i didn’t pick up but it’s your mom so i figured it might be important.”
“it’s just a small one,” tony blushed. “my dad wanted to teach me how to sail as a kid so he bought it for me and we placed it here when i started college.”
and tony didn’t know what to say to that, so he just had james put his head on the bed next to where he was lying and streaked his hair in circling motions.
“what’s it like growing up this rich?” steve asked over their exclusive dinner once they reached the appropriate flight level. tony had told the pilot to do a couple circuits over new york so steve could see the skyline he loved so much.
Inside Pops' and dad's bedroom, Peter found the album his pops had been looking at with ease; under the bed.
“it’s not like i’ve seen you in my office since the school year started,” steve said and took a bite from his protein bar.
the counsellor hummed and pulled his boyfriend even closer. “hey,” steve whispered, tightening his grip.
the conversation went quiet from then on, everyone seemingly intimidated with tony. and so the teenager spoke up: “so addy, are you in some sort of a dance group?”
tony didn’t like the word cry. crying was something for kids and he didn’t like that steve had caught him off guard like that.
in a very sober tone, dr. banner explained to tony that despite the momentary positive effects, his last treatment hadn’t been very effective, and that he was suggesting another therapy.
“hey you’re that new counsellor in engineering right?” the teenager had heard a few girls talk about dr. rogers before and after class, and how his schedule was always full because everyone was trying to make a pass on him.
“whatever it is tony, you’re very sick. i would never judge you for what happens when a treatment messes you up.”
and it wasn’t like he could talk to his friends about it; they would either say that tony’s a twink who he could just do or that he’s a pedophile, and if he was being honest, he could not face those things if they were the truth.
steve had yet to call, but he figured he’d leave himself as much time as he could in order to maybe look a bit more mature the next time he crossed paths with steve.
he wanted to see how the teenager was doing in natural settings. it would help him see how mature he was, and honestly the geographical proximity tickled his stomach a little.
“i know,” bucky said softly. “you guys are young though and there’s cancer research so please stevie, just stop worrying about the future too much and enjoy, okay?”
“i’m sorry stevie i don’t think i can eat much tonight,” tony said in dismay but steve waved it off.
He was seven years old when he first heard his fathers fight. It was a rough argument about a lot of things.
tony quickly realized that everyone at the table was living his dream of having a close family. he knew it was cheesy, but something about what he’d seen in movies had always touched his heart. adison and her younger brother joey (joseph, after sarah’s late husband) were loved all around, got to grow up with four adults who loved them to pieces. the teenager didn’t like himself getting jealous of things the way he did. but what was he to do? those kids had won big, that was for sure.
never had it gone this fast for either of them, and tony thought that surely now he would get more sick, because that is how life goes.
none of his professors dared to say anything about that, because they all knew tony could take on classes and graduate with a perfect score without studying for a minute.
“my mom’s a nurse but she’s just had surgery so she’s not working right now. and my dad passed away fifteen years ago, but he used to work at xerox in the sales department.”
and steve being the great person he was slipped one hand under his boyfriend's legs and left the other on his back, lifting him into his crossed lap with ease. tony in response buried his face in steve's collarbone, giving the blonde access to kissing the top of his head.
their time on o’ahu was cut short when the boy fainted in the middle of the living room and was held at the hospital for three full days, hooked up to every device one could imagine.
tony was given a glass of champagne while bucky and steve showered, and he updated andrew on how school was and where his parents were investing in houses for their next trips. holly snorted three lines of cocaine while the boy spoke, and none of them batted an eye at that.
“i’m not sure,” the man responded. and exactly how would he tell tony this? that his heart ached for time they’d never shared. that he should have taken care of tony as a kid, that he now enjoyed having someone dependent on him but the reason for that was so tragic he wished it wasn’t happening. “i’m glad we’re finding some sort of a curve to our relationship. i missed out on so much when you were a kid and i regret it.”
after being assured that that was in fact the case, pepper took a shuddery breath. “i’m not really supposed to tell anyone but tony, you know, the kid from human factors?”
"Why... What did you mean was because of you, Pete?" Steve said and took the album from the boy, closing it and putting it on the bed behind them, then faced his son again.
When he was four and a half years old, Peter started to call Steve Pops, and the blond man knew right away that this kid would always be a part of his life, whether he was with Tony or not.
they stood close together for a while, neither saying a word. then steve opened his arms wide and hugged the short boy, who barely reached his chest, as close as he could for about 10 minutes. then he left without another word.
the skinny type was steve’s type to some extent but usually it had always been with men his age, not teenager. so the man tried to think of tony’s body as just tony, not as a sixteen-year-old’s body in order not to feel like a predator. and besides, tony was a 12 intellectually.
“oh tony. i don’t want to hurt you. you’re meant to experiment, to have first times together with high school crushes.”
the two watched movies until late at night when bucky decided to call it a night. steve woke tony up so he could brush his teeth and change into something more comfortable.
The guests quieted down and Steve squeezed Peter's shoulders, then began to talk. "I remember the day when your dad brought you home as if it was yesterday. I remember the first time I put you to bed and the first time I kissed your wounds when you were hurt. I can clearly recall the first time you called me Pops because I haven't really been unhappy since-" Steve took a breath and Peter smiled at his Pops with glossy eyes.
tony nodded. “yeah.” he slid his hands up onto steve’s chest. “they give you ten to twenty years. it’s hard to make estimates.”
the counsellor stepped very close to tony’s back and rubbed the biceps that wasn’t holding a wine glass, his body heat emitting into tony. the teenager leaned back against steve’s muscular chest. “are you okay?”
People stood up and clapped, and now would actually be the point where Steve and Tony took each other's hand and walked out of the church, but instead, Steve crouched down in front of his stepson and placed both hands on his shoulders.
and so they went home a while later, deciding to meet again the next day and both unable to wait with excitement.
tony woke up the next morning seemingly well rested and not feeling sick for once. on days like those, the teenager took particular advantage of his health. he filled up on as many calories as he could and even took a slow walk in the morning.
steve’s full weight was crushed against tony’s legs, his hands reaching around the boy’s back, fingernails digging into the skin. it took tony longer than it ever had, making steve glad he wasn’t taking advantage of this vulnerability.
“breakfast?” the man asked and tony nodded in response. he sat down in his usual spot at the table howard started to set.
tony nodded and exited the shower, getting himself ready while steve washed off. “put on one of your kiddie boxers,” steve suggested through the stream of water. and so tony did; a pair of white boxers with a picture of sheriff woodie at the front.
Peter's gaze shifted between his Pops and his dad, who both had tear streaks on their faces. He stood there, leg bouncing a bit and his left hand on the back of Pops' thigh. His eyes were wet on their own, but all he could do was smile. Steve lifted his hand off of Peter's shoulder as Tony took the Vibranium ring from the pillow and placed it on his husband's finger.
“i’ll see you at dinner tomorrow, okay? i’ll pick you up,” tony said, which had never happened but he felt like driving again after not having done that in so long.
“don’t apologize for having feelings rogers,” tony said softly and turned back around closing his eyes.
the fact that tony said ‘it’ll be a while before it gets bad’ didn’t help him, it still meant that tony would die early on. and cancer is so unpredictable.
steve told him about his little dig through the refrigerator that was completely empty save for yoghurt and some milk. “we could grab lunch together?”
he felt so, heart wrenchingly sorry for hurting tony the way he did, or just the possibility of how hurt tony might be. but it seemed like this would be him taking advantage of tony’s juvenile affection.
they spent their day like that: watching movies, enjoying each other’s presence and physical touch although they weren’t used to these things. tony enjoyed his mom so sober and his dad so affectionate. they brought him lunch and the pill when it was time, and tony fell asleep right after.
“oh. do you want to come over? we’ll just have dinner all together and from about nine i’m all yours.”
tony’s chest fluttered with butterflies washed down with a new set of tears. he had never felt this wanted and protected and safe.
bucky didn’t ask questions when tony got up to take the pill, or when the teenager only ate a piece of his pizza and left the rest to them.
“use some time to think,” steve said and contemplated for a bit. “sit in my lap?” he asked the teenager; he really needed some physical touch right then.
steve was extremely excited for his first ride on tony’s private jet and the teenager loved every second of it.
by the time the sun started to set over the city, the teenager heard the elevator open into the penthouse of the tower and huffed out a breath in annoyance. did his folks really show up the one time he stayed at the apartment?
tony had driven most people away that cared. he would get mad when someone said an 83% survival rate for the next five years wasn’t bad. because if the survival rate was 17%, they’d say that tony was so special, and cancer sure wouldn’t take him which was absolute bullshit to the boy. so yeah, survival rate high or not, he would die early on anyway, so what’s the point of getting a company dependent on him for a maximum of ten or fifteen years?
tony booked enough classes to finish his grad degree within two semesters because he needed some sort of distraction and he felt invincible regarding his health right then.
The six-year-old's face crumpled as more tears made their way down his cheeks and he nodded eagerly, stepping forward into his Pops' open arms, who hugged him tight and let him sob into his expensive suit. The guests cheered again, giving Peter time to calm himself a little before Steve pressed a kiss to his temple and then got up and placed him onto his hip.
steve stayed seated when his boyfriend got up, but tony pulled him up after himself. steve got the quiet link and introduced himself simply as ‘steve’ when he sat down next to tony across from dr. banner.
it would take tony a few weeks to go deep into what steve needed to know but he felt a sense of relief he hadn't known before. maybe the mess he was would be less of a mess after sharing.
tony shook his head. “the doctor agreed to see me alone because i just took off my shirt to show the nurse at the reception, and she thought i was being abused at home. i didn’t tell her i wasn’t, just didn’t object. once i’d filled in my forms, the doctor sent me straight to an oncologist when i told him there was no reason for the bruises. so yeah, i was the one who got to tell my parents once i had it confirmed.”
steve had to teach another introduction into psychology right after tony left to head to his next class.
“can we please drive for a bit?” tony asked and steve nodded, knowing exactly where he would take the boy.
With the wedding ring on his finger, Steve took Peter's left hand into his right one and smiled down at the boy as he examined the new ring. "Tony," Steve started, voice already a bit shaky. "When I was young I would dream on and on about what the future would hold for me. I weighed out many options, and I don't think you'd be hurt if I said you weren't one of them.
tony was diagnosed with chronic leukaemia during his first month at mit. he was fourteen years old and scared shitless for the first few months. from then on, he had to go see a doctor once every few weeks and during any anomalies regarding his well-being.
tony figured now was the time to ask; steve was open and nostalgic and also freezing, so suggesting opening a bottle of wine back at his place seemed fair.
tony felt that way for the first time, in his life it felt like. and it made him a sort of sad he’d never experienced before. not even when he found out he had cancer.
what the super soldier didn't know, was that his boyfriend woke himself up after thirty minutes of sleep, stayed awake working for a while and went to sleep for another thirty minutes.
Officially, only Tony was Peter's father. He hadn't met Steve until he'd already been along in the process of adopting a child. They had been together for a mere year when Tony had brought Peter home.
“he hasn’t, actually. what kind of deal?” tony didn’t really care about these things, he was only being polite.
tony made sure to calm down as quickly as he could, and it’s not like he wasn’t used to those feelings. he blamed getting off of medication for this little incident and kissed steve intently while they were still out on the balcony.
You have given me a family after I was taken away from mine and love, you have given me a future that needs to be lived. Thank you, Tony, I love you with all my heart."
honestly, he developed a reckless type of behaviour during his university time. he took on twice the workload others did, for while his body was tired most of the time, his brain was what needed something to do during the nights he couldn’t sleep for sheer exhaustion (and questioning that fact was not on the list, it made him more anxious than it calmed him).
“well i’m happy there’s some positives. a lot of people struggle to understand that money isn’t everything in the world.”
tony shrugged in response. “i guess.” aside from all the throwing up on himself, a lot of tantrums and the occasional two hour nose bleed.
Steve diverted the fire away from himself and accused Tony of his lack of sleep, and how he couldn't possibly expect to lead a normal life with only two hours of downtime a night.
tony nodded his head yes, then got up to sit on the couch across from the two. he was becoming anxious. “we can take the lamborghini,” he said with a smile because who wouldn’t love to drive that. steve smiled, too.
"okay," tony said then. "I'll try and work on it. but I don't want you to experience this every night."
"do you want to talk about it?" steve asked when tony's tears had stopped falling. it had surprised him how openly tony had showed emotion; he had never seen him cry in the whole year they'd known each other. he himself had cried in front of tony a handful of times, sometimes even before they'd been together.
When I brought this little boy home, I gave him the gift of a father. But Steve, what you gave our sweetheart is a family. And I will forever love you for that and for a ton of things that would take too long to mention now."
when steve saw his little crush get into said limousine before pulling out of the garage, he decided to look up tony’s student file. something had to be wrong with that kid, right?
“i thought maybe within a safe distance from campus we could have coffee and consider things. if you’re still on board of course.”
the teenager took his usual spot in the fourth row next to pepper and maria, whom he’d tutored for a while when he started off at school in return for booze and being escorted to parties.
he’d brought some tea for himself and steve, and he would suggest opening a bottle of wine at his place after the surf session.
“alright,” bucky smiled and something about that told tony that he didn’t know about his health situation.
"Now that your dad and I have put a label on our relationship, I would like to put one on yours and mine too. Will you let me adopt you, Peter?"
somehow getting distracted and active and eating healthy really helped tony. he was really responding well to this treatment, and he loved the fact that now, after meeting steve, he seemed to enjoy life again even if it was without what seemed like a most serious crush.
images of tony’s bruised torso made these feelings in steve’s chest worse and the counsellor knew he couldn’t get into this now, or it would take him too long to recover. and so he put on a smile and distracted himself with the fact that later that night, tony would be all his after finishing his papers, and the tears dried up and his hands stopped shaking.
tony called steve the second he got back to the workshop and while his parents were settling back into their bedroom.
steve and bucky’s apartment was small, maybe half of the size of tony’s but the teenager loved how personal it looked. there were pictures of them as babies and then all of the pictures from kindergarten age on were of the two together.
“do you mind sleeping in the same bed as me?” steve picked up on the sadness in tony’s voice without having to look at the slight pout the teenager was dramatically giving off.
“i wanna dance too!” joey exclaimed and so steve moved addy to one side and picked the other kid right up, dancing around with them for a while. tony blinked quickly in response, he wouldn’t go and cry in front of steve’s family on the first day he met them. he didn’t even want to cry in front of his- boyfriend? steve sat down with both his niece and nephew on his lap and showered them with kisses.
the two of them sat close to each other when the music started softly and slowly, and steve’s hand was facing up on his lap, so in the middle of the movie tony slipped his own in there. they both pulled back a tiny bit for a short second, then intertwined their fingers like it was so normal.
“so what have you been doing this break?” the man asked in order to make conversation and was astonished when tony mentioned the mansion his family had on hawaii, unbeknownst to the fact of who the kid next to him really was.
“of course, thank you andrew,” tony said and waved when holly and the millionaire rode off back to his yacht thirty times the size of tony’s. as much as it was unspoken not to invite a stark when you saw them around lunch time, it was just as unspoken for a stark saying no to such an invitation. and because tony knew these things could happen, he had made sure all of them were dressed acceptably for the world he grew up in.
“sorry, the jokes just come spewing out when i’m drunk.” steve didn’t respond, eyes fixated on the road. “well, anyway. i think andrew liked you guys a lot, summer should be fun.”
the first time they saw each other apart from brushing hands in the hallway and tony seeing steve in his human factors class was on sunday night, when they met for dinner and cuddled all night long before tony fell asleep at nine pm due to sheer exhaustion.
tony took a shutter breath while he looked out on the open road. “i want my parents.” saying those words made tony’s eyes water for reasons he couldn’t explain.
when finally the tears ceased, steve picked up the hem of his shirt and used it to wipe his face. “sorry,” he said and before he could pull the shirt back down, tony stopped him, and steve’s hands went around tony again while his torso was being admired.
There was no doubt that this right there, them standing on the altar as a family for the first time, became their most beloved family picture for many years to come.
“well, howard does weird business, i always thought it would come crashing down at one point. lucky for me i’ll probably be dead by the time it does.”
“wow steve, you’ve outdone yourself by a landslide,” jim said and steve eyed tony who was sitting right next to him.
the two did make a return, but it wasn’t an evil one; when tony tripped over nothing but his weak muscles, he held on to steve’s arm, who in return took his hand into his and rubbed the back of it very gently. “you okay?”
context: howard and maria have just left boston and tony is spending the weekend at steve and bucky's. steve's upset because he starts to realize that tony really is sick and can't be saved.
steve said yes after considering that tony might not have reached drinking age yet, and so he agreed to go to the student’s apartment without much of a thought.
steve took a deep breath and tony placed his hands onto the tight shirt around his abs. “did your parents have to fly in?”
the semester was going to start one and a half weeks later, and since tony literally had nothing to do until then, he decided to try and train a little. he’d been in quite alright shape up until the last time he lost his appetite a few weeks back.
Peter leaned into his Pops' side at that and watched intently as his dad started to speak, smiling up at his fathers every now and then.
steve interrupted that train of thought by handing the teenager a pack of cigarette with a sort of retro design.
now steve knew he’d have to talk to tony soon. he’d been notified by a few lecturers and teaching assistants about tony’s rather tired demeanour ever since the semester had started up, and it was his duty as counsellor to make sure that tony was at his best health both mentally and physically.
“very well, thank you. do you think you can check on my son in the kitchen, i think he’s burning the sauce,” sarah said with a wink and turned back to her glass of wine. tony noted that the table was already neatly set and turned on his heel.
tony loved that steve cared so much about him that he’d ask that question right away. “yeah. my folks showed up,” he stated with a sigh. he didn’t know where this was going or what he wanted steve to do.
they hugged each other hello. “you okay? you look kind of tired.” steve said and for his eyes looked so sincere to tony that he decided not to lie.
tony woke the next day between his parents and again, it felt so right. he reached over his mother to grab his phone and find a few new text messages from steve, whom he hadn’t answered since the day before.
“yeah, you’re right.” he pulled his socks a little further up. “your appointments are always booked to the top by horny college girls though.”
“you didn’t have to do that,” tony told him when he pulled his boxers and pants back up and was helped into his shirt by steve. “thank you though,” he said and pressed another kiss on steve’s lips.
it turned out that the man had studied marketing and worked at a small startup in the city but was hoping to get into a big firm someday.
“where did you find that?” tony said when he took out one of them, realizing only two had been smoked before.
