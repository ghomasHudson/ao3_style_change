Well, that was just rude, Steve thought as he slammed his fist into the glass, which sent a series of cracks spiderwebbing out from the impact.  His Alpha apparently agreed with the sentiment.  It was nice they were so compatible.
Tony stared down at him for a span of heartbeats, then let out a breath, lips quirking into a half-smile.  “You will join me in my carriage today,” Tony announced. “Rhodey insists on riding with his soldiers, and if I lack for company, Lord Harris insists on joining me and telling me more about why I should strip lands from Lord Emerson because the old reprobate has managed to produce thirteen bastards and no legitimate heir, despite the, no doubt quite formidable efforts, he committed to the attempts.  Breakfast first, though,” Tony said.
“You will go back to our chambers,” Tony snapped.  His jaw worked around the words.  “You will take off your clothes and kneel on the bed until I return, and then we will deal with this.”
“I hear Rand wants his son to sit on the Council,” Bruce said.  “Stane’s vacant seat.”
Fear.  Terror bound with a near-certainty that he wasn’t meant to have this, not really.  Not
“It…it isn’t that simple,” Steve protested, though it sounded weak, even to his own ears.
His breath hitched.  A shudder wracked through him.  He put his elbows on the table with the letter between them and looked down at it, letting his head fall into the cradle of his hands.  Wasn’t it wonderful, getting everything you never thought you could have?  Stars and robots.  Freedom and acceptance.  They burned the false Maria, his mind supplied.  He thought she might have been relieved.
“You said people might not understand. About the Clan,” Tony reminded him. “And now winter is nearly here, and--”
He knocked. The taller of the two guards opened the door, frowning deeply at Steve from under bushy brows peppered with flecks of gray.
Steve risked a glance over the path’s edge, only to have a dizzying panic surge through him, closing his throat for a moment, close enough to the way his spells used to when he was younger.  He took a deep breath, forcing the cold air into his lungs, and that seemed to--not calm him, but push away some of the unreality of the situation, leaving him with no answers but a thrumming need to
, what was he supposed to do? Think?  Clearly that was overrated—was enough to wake up the rest of Tony’s body, thanks circulation.
“No,” Tony admitted with a slight wince.  In retrospect, he probably should have brought one with him, but showing up here with a stranger in tow to watch the drama and literally give it an official stamp was top of the list of things that just were not happening.  “You can come down to the Tower.  Or, my lawyer’s office.  Card’s in the file.  Bank.  Whatever.  Here,” he said, sliding the manila folder out from where it was tucked under his arm.  Steve grabbed it out of his hand before he could offer it, then turned and walked back to the kitchen, dropping the folder on the counter next to a can of corn.  “Everything’s in there.  You just sign.  Sign and we’re done,” Tony finished flatly, repeating Steve’s words back to him.
Tony stared at him, mouth opening and closing while he waited for the other shoe to drop.  When he couldn’t wait any longer, he finally sucked in a deep breath and stood up, pulling the dogtags over his head.  They were heavier than they looked, solid and cold against his the hollow of his chest, making a slight, roughened noise when they rubbed together.  His left hand snaked around them, clutching them in his fist and pulling the chain tight against the back of his neck until it dug into the crease of skin there.  He meant to ask what he was supposed to do up there at Rogers’ little Alpha hut, but what came out was, predictably, not quite what he’d intended.
“Oh? Okay. Thanks, Friday,” Steve said.
Well.  He finally managed to sound like his mother.  All it took was wanting to do anything to hang on to whatever shred of happiness that could be his.  Huh.  Almost like there was some kind of pattern there, Tony thought with a frustrated grimace.
“Do you require their permission?” Steve asked arching his brow.
“No, he’s not,” Cam interrupted, looking back and forth between them with a frown.
country.  The Pres---,” he broke off, shaking his head.  “You know, why am I even surprised anymore?  He wants me to do this?  Steve, I mean. Not the President.  Steve, he…he wants me to…to go to MIT?” Tony asked, digging each word out when they didn’t want to come.
,” Anthony pointed out.  Steve looked over and imagined him sitting curled up on the sofa with the blanket around him.  “
“Wow, it’s almost like there is some kind of a pattern there,” Pepper said with a slight smile.   Not for the first time, he was struck with just how remarkable she was.  He’d taken the loss of their relationship hard, though he had realized some time ago that it was the loss of her in his life he feared more than the loss of her in his heart.  Which probably told him a lot.
“Excellent,” Stark said. “Let’s go up to the roof, shall we?”
“You are,” Steve insisted, swallowing hard.  “I’m not lying.” He winced. “Not about this.”
Tony only looked back three times that Steve caught.  Steve shook his head and leaned over the edge of the craps table.  He placed his bet on the Pass line and picked two dice out of the dice boat the stickman offered and shook them in his fist while Stane watched.  His come out roll was a seven, earning him a round of applause.
It was Saturday, and miracle of miracles, he hadn’t pulled a shift at the construction site for once, so when Tony invited him up for the day, he was free to go.  He wasn’t quite sure how he felt about it, getting to spend all day with Tony instead of just the evening.  Some odd mixture of excited and ashamed at being excited, which seemed to be his usual state of being when it came to Tony.
“I love you,” Steve replied, and realized that was the only answer he could give. “I love you,” he repeated, leaning forward into the curve of Tony’s neck.
,” Zola said.  “Guards!” Zola called out.  Four splendidly dressed guards came out from somewhere beyond the red doors, their armor bearing the same flower as Zola’s pin and the bronze markers on the door.  “Take him inside and see that he is bathed, fed and prepared. Here,” he said, turning to Sitwell.  “A bit extra for your trouble.  A pleasure doing business with you, as always,” Zola said with a deferential nod.  A jingling pouch appeared from somewhere in Zola’s robes, and he handed it to Sitwell, who pocketed it inside his tunic.
Steve’s mouth finally left Tony’s nipple with a soft, wet popping sound, though Steve kept his head bent to Tony’s chest, pressing his mouth down a trail towards Tony’s stomach, then lower, then—Tony’s mind stuttered, skidded to a halt, hitting some kind of big, white wall of pleasure that crashed into him as Steve kept going, lower and lower, until his mouth touched the tight, reddened skin of Tony’s cock.  Steve looked up at him, mouth hovering, lips wet and shiny.
“Sure.  Sure,” Tony replied.  “Probably not turkey though,” he finished with a scowl.
“This has nothing to do with…that,” Steve snapped lowly at him, too quickly, he realized immediately by Bucky’s knowing look. “With anything, except completing the mission we came here to do. If there wasn’t a threat to the Realm, I’d be the first to hang up my shield, but we don’t—I can’t just walk away.” He kept his eyes on the far tent wall, noticing for the first time that there was a small tear at one of the seams, where it had started to fray in the heat and wind. He should have someone fix it, he thought, but it was an idle thought, without any kind of force behind it, the kind you think to not think of other things. Scratches on a wall, he thought suddenly, as if the thought had been shoved inside his head, then breathed out a long breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.
“I think…I think maybe luck isn’t always about being dealt the best hand,” Steve replied.  “Sometimes…sometimes, maybe it’s about not folding, even when that’s probably what the odds say to do.  Maybe sometimes, just every once in a while, maybe the House doesn’t get to win, you know? But, only if you stick around and play.”
Of course, nothing happened.  The thing was long-since broken from damage or age or some combination of both.  Still, he thought, holding the weight of it in his hands.  What must that have been like?  Some pimply-faced radio operator sitting back in some bunker in London switches on his receiver and hears Captain America talking back to him, and is suddenly relaying vital information to the front,  stopping the bad guys, helping a hero, drawn into becoming a part of some grand adventure.  Frodo with his ring of dials, wires and frequencies.
Steve asked him what it was like back in the camp, if he was happy, and Anto told him he was, that Clan was family, and he had an Alpha, and maybe one day, they would mate.  This was called a lie, he had learned, and it was a bad thing that could sometimes be a good thing, Steve had tried to explain. It didn’t make sense to Anto, but he decided this was a good lie, because it made Steve smile to hear it, though it was a soft, wistful smile that almost looked sad to Anto, though that didn’t make any sense.  Smiles were because you were happy, after all. Steve had said so.
Steve nodded, surprised by the lead in.  He wasn’t sure where Tony was going with this.
Steve had no idea what he was supposed to do now.  He pushed himself up and swung his legs off the edge of the bed, then stood, gingerly at first.  He winced at the sudden stab of pain, though it faded to a dull ache as he stood there.  He was sticky with sweat and…well.  Other things.  He could feel the King’s seed leaking out of him and down his thighs.  He looked down again at the King, then slowly walked towards the doors. He was almost there, when he turned around and looked toward the antechamber, where he had met the King earlier.  Curiosity drove him to walk over to the table and pick up the drawing that the King had been working on.  It showed a trebuchet attached to a wall, with a long throwing arm and lightweight beam, next to a toothed wheel that seemed to be designed to serve as a winch to load the catapult.  He studied it, committing it to memory.  It might be the last useful thing he did.  This…this was his life now, he thought, looking over his shoulder towards the bedroom, where he could just see the outline of a figure on the bed.  Tomorrow, he would serve someone else.  And the day after that, someone else.  Until no one wanted him anymore, and then, he would be used for something else.
Steve dropped his arm to his side, pumped his hips down on Tony’s fingers, then looked hazily down at Tony.
That didn’t narrow it down a whole lot.
“Not you,” the guard said.  “Just him,” he told Zola, nodding at Steve.  Zola shot an annoyed look at Steve, but bowed and murmured some politeness as the door closed in his face.  “In there,” the guard told Steve.
“I have to go,” he said, stopping with his hand on the doorknob, halfway out of the apartment.
“Jus—ugh—jus’ there—fuck—Steve—“ Tony slurred, eyes wide, mouth trying to form words that he couldn’t quite seem to find.  Tony shuddered and clenched, back curving into a bow, his neck cording with the effort as he came into Steve’s hand.  Steve felt the slick walls of Tony’s channel go from loose to tight around his cock as Tony’s whole body clamped down around Steve in quick, jerky motions as Tony spent himself.  Steve felt his own body tighten in response and pushed Tony’s back against the wall, using it for leverage and bracing both hands under Tony’s arms to keep him upright as the other man went languid.  Steve pushed in and out a few more times, hips snapping hard against the slick, wet heat of Tony’s ass, and then he was coming so hard the edges of his vision darkened.  His thrusts became sloppy, and he felt the strength leave his legs as if the serum was being leached out of him.  He somehow maneuvered them to the nearby futon, settling Tony down and then collapsing nearly on top of him, breathing heavily.
Though his chest tightened and his heart thudded almost painfully when he thought of finally seeing Tony again, the ride back was the same haze of pain and nausea the march to the desert had been all those months ago. The stiffness from the scars on his back seemed to worsen with each day in the saddle, though the weight of the shield strapped to his back was oddly comforting. He still had a few drops of the concoction Bruce had prepared for him before the trip. He could take that, but it dulled his wits even more than the pain, and though the threats were minimal on the way home under the King’s banner, he was still the commander and couldn’t afford a misstep.
?” Anthony asked.
A couple of chapter notes for anyone who is weird like me:
Steve wasn’t sure what he had wanted in the moments before.  A distraction.  A way out.  A way into something else.  Anything beyond the swirl of anger, fear and frustrated helplessness that seemed to fill his head anytime he opened his mind to the yawning maw of a future he didn’t want to face.  Now, looking at Tony, the he wanted something else.  He wanted Tony to see himself the way Steve could see him, if only for a little bit, or if only a little bit, the way you can only ever see the best version of yourself, parts and pieces and reflections of the whole, but never all at once.  Maybe he was using Tony, and maybe Tony was using him, but they were giving each other something, too, something maybe both of them had needed.
“Look, he’ll be back soon, and we have this dinner thing tonight, so can you stop with the,” Steve began, making a motion in the air with his hand.
Steve slanted his lips across Tony’s mouth and brought a hand up to cup the back of Tony’s head, one hand on Tony’s hip, keeping him still and applying enough pressure to get Tony to angle his mouth just so.  The tip of Steve’s tongue traced the seam of Tony’s mouth.  More pressure at the back of his head, and Tony gasped, a small, surprised wisp of air, his whole body going pliant.  Steve’s tongue swept inside Tony’s mouth, sliding along Tony’s, flicking the tip with the flat of his own, then, delving deep, just for a moment, curling back around Tony’s in a slow, velvety caress before drawing back.
“Hmmm,” Tony mumbled and stretched his arm up to curl around Steve’s neck.  “So, what if you had seen me? Back then, I mean?  In one of those photos or, I don’t know, on a mission or something.  Would you have been all White Hat about it?  My Knight in Shining Armor come to rescue me?”
One hundred and twenty-three days until Tony’s first parole hearing.
This was getting long, so while I anticipate just one more part, I'm notoriously terrible at predicting how much I'll end up writing.  At any rate, at 8K, it felt time to post this Part.  Enjoy!
“Yes, he will.  He will, Steve. You don’t know him.  I thought I did, but…” Tony said, looking down and away.  His eye caught on the line of progressively less-bowlish vases on the bookcase, and he let out a shuddering sigh.
He ran a thumb over the crest at the corner of the envelope, then turned it over and tore open the sealed flap.  The paper rustled as he pulled it out.  His hands were shaking again.  He swallowed back a lump of bile that was climbing up his throat and let out a cough to cover the way the paper shook in his hands as he opened the letter.  His fingers clenched of their own volition.  He sucked in a halting gasp of air, closed his eyes and bit his tongue hard enough to taste blood.  If this was a dream, he would be waking up now, right?
Tony didn’t remember closing his eyes, but he opened them into the darkness.  He turned his head towards the wall that separated his bedroom from Steve’s and stared for a minute, throat bobbing as he tried to swallow.  This was wrong.  He knew that.  This was for his Alpha.
“God, Tony,” Steve mumbled, catching Tony’s hips in his hands and holding him there at just the angle he seemed to always be able to find, hitting that sweet spot deep inside Tony on each thrust. Tony could feel his cock twitch with interest, though his body seemed to be held in a state of suspended animation for the moment, limbs languid, heartbeat steady, eyes wide, and breath coming in soft, little pants that kept time with Steve’s thrusts.
The only way to fix any of it was to undo it with the combined power of the stones.  That was one thing Bruce and Shuri agreed on. For Thanos to do what he did in a single snap of his fingers, he needed all of the stones.
“Good morning,” Steve replied, rolling off of Tony and allowing him to slide off the bed. He watched from the bed as he got up and put on a morning robe, then rang the bell for food.
clothes for the Raj’Inama!  More beautiful than you have ever seen!” Cam promised.
“Yeah, but--” Steve began.
“Then let them come,” Tony’s voice cut in sharply, a bright line through the darkness that clouded Steve’s mind. “Let them come and try.  He is mine. God or fate or whatever force you feel pressing on the wheel has decreed it. Perhaps I cannot have what I would want.  That is not entirely new to me, you know?  But, I can give him what I have, if he will have it of me.  I am…I am told that those things may be just as good.  If they are truly meant.”
“Thank you, Agent Coulson.  I have the, ah…”  Rogers began, hands going to his hips as he looked around.
Tony looked up.  Here, against the cloak of pale blue late evening sky, he could see a single star, just barely visible, though it burned so bright, it lit the way for all who looked for it.
Natasha and Captain Rhodes had returned at some point during the night, he noted, and Clint’s bedding was empty now. Thor was snoring lightly, and Bruce was buried under his blanket, only the top of his head visible.  Steve looked around, but couldn’t see past the first row of trees before the night swallowed the waning light of the fire.  It seemed a silly thing, now, a bad dream and nothing more, but he couldn’t quite shake the disquieted feeling.  Giving up on sleep for the moment, he pushed himself up, wincing as his back protested the action, though it wasn’t as bad as it could have been, all things considered.  Between stopping early and Bruce’s concoction, he felt better than he had the past few mornings.
“I—yes.  Yes, I’ve had a…this,” Steve said, then paused.  “I think.  It was…over quickly? That’s, I’m not—I mean…not me, or, well, not only me--”
“I get it,” Stark replied.  “Kind of the same thing, me and my machines.  When it’s all too much in my head, I can go to the shop, take something apart, put it back together. Build something. Fix something.  It’s control of this little slice of the world, making it make sense when…”
“Hello, Sir, how might I be of assistance,” came a disembodied British voice.
Tony opened his eyes and found the alien’s impossibly blue ones on him.  The alien moved down to the end of the table, between Tony’s legs, and studied him for a moment, his dark, blue eyes watching Tony’s face with a cautiousness that hadn’t been there before.
“There you are,” Ty said, walking over to stand in front of Tony.  “I’ve been looking for you.”
Tony kept talking, something about telling him if anything hurt, but Tony’s hand were moving Steve’s legs apart, spreading him wider and a slick finger was tracing its way down between Steve’s legs, rubbing lightly against the edge of his entrance, and if Tony didn’t finish what he’d started, Steve was probably going to ugly cry right here in the bed and never live it down.
Their end.
“Nhuh,” Steve managed as he sucked the lobe of Tony’s ear into his mouth.  “M’good.”
Come to me, he thought to himself.  Was it possible that someone was up there, hiding away from the world but somehow calling out to Steve?  Such a thing could only be the work of unnatural forces, or so the Reverend would have said, but as strange as the place was, as odd as the voice in his head made him feel, he was here safely, a circumstance that should have been impossible.  That had to mean something. At least, perhaps, if there was someone, perhaps they meant no harm? Perhaps they needed help and called out the only way they were able to, stuck way up here.
“It isn't all that surprising, really, that something fell through the cracks,” Mitch continued without pause. “Rather a new area of law, and one that, thankfully, is quickly becoming obsolete.”
Steve seemed suitably impressed by the Tower, if by impressed you meant showed virtually no reaction to anything other than polite appreciation.  Olympic-size pool fifty floors up?  Well, you sir are no James Buchanan Barnes, that’s for sure.  Where were the questions about every, single God-damned thing?  The not-so-subtle trolling that no one would believe came out of Captain America’s mouth?
“I’ve really…I’ve got stuff to do,” Tony ground out.  He gritted his teeth, gnashing his jaw together around the words, trying to keep his body taut.  He glanced over at the workstation, trying to focus on that.  It was hard to do, with Steve right there, but he had no choice.  If he kept looking at Steve, he was going to fall apart, like everything was held together with some string that staring too long at Steve was slowly loosening.
Tony’s mind flattened out as pleasure coursed through him, too much feeling to think about anything beyond it.  He felt safe. Maybe it wasn’t objective, maybe it was the magic finger whammy. Did telepathy work if transmitted through your prostate, Tony wondered with a shuddering, breathy laugh. Guess so, he thought as a tide of humorous assurance seemed to answer him.  The alien was smiling down at him now, and that, wow, Tony liked that. He liked seeing the alien happy, reflecting all of that back into Tony somehow. It was joyous and free, someone else’s happiness, untouched by Tony’s usual certainty that he didn’t deserve it. No, this was different. This was happiness undiluted.  Pure, concentrated feeling, and God, it was like the greatest hit of anything Tony had ever had.
“It’s just...I don’t wanna… you know,” Steve stammered, looking down pointedly at the tented bulge that didn’t leave much to the imagination with the way his damp swim trunks outlined him like a second skin.
in.  Though, despite the light that led him up here, no one appeared to be in residence at the moment, Steve realized with a disappointed grimace. The room was empty.  Yet...
Filtration systems.
Of course, all of his plans to ease his way into this explanation---which began somewhere around getting handed his first circuit board and told to call someone Uncle Obie and ended with a phone call Tony was fairly sure had been used to trace his whereabouts for the people coming to kill him--had blown up in his face.  Of course, it had. Quite literally, in one sense, though the slow-moving dagger of pain that was watching the dawning realization creep across Steve’s face was almost worse than any shrapnel had been. At least he didn’t remember his heart being literally shredded. This…this, Steve’s face, the way he was looking at Tony now, this, he was probably going to remember for the rest of his life.  Maybe it really was some kind of Karmic penance. Maybe it was only fair. After all, if anyone deserved to chew him out for being naïve and gullible to the point of gross negligence, it was Steve. Steve, who had watched his people die because of Tony in more ways than he realized.
The scrape of the chair as Tony was so loud it almost startled Steve, though Tony’s steps were measured. Careful.  He stopped in front of Steve and stood there, silent and still, then reached out a hand and cupped the side of Steve’s face, the way Steve had known he would.  Steve leaned into the warm, familiar curve of Tony’s hand, feeling the rough, calloused skin against his cheek.  Everything else seemed to fade away.  It was just Tony’s touch, his gaze, his heat. This, here, now.  Nothing else mattered.  Not in here.

“You…made a flashcard. About skin cancer,” Steve repeated in confusion, frowning down at the card Tony was holding out to him.
He was laughing, too, he realized, more because of Steve’s reaction than anything, but it was like someone had hit a release valve and everything that had been building up since they left the mini-golf came spilling out.  Tony rocked back on his heels, felt a small pull at his hand and   leaned forward again to the center of Steve’s chest.  He blinked.  Looked up.  Steve’s hands settled on Tony’s waist.  Tony’s breath hitched, his chest tightening and stomach swooping.  Whatever he might have said caught in his throat and refused to budge.  Steve was smiling down at him, laughter sparkling his eyes, lips still blue from the ridiculous drink he was so proud of winning, all handsy and adoring all of a sudden, like Tony was the only thing he cared about in the world.  He was beautiful.
.  Steve wanted more. Groaning, Steve let go of his hold on the bedpost and wound his arms around Tony’s back, pulling him closer until their chests met.  Between them, Steve could feel the harness of the jewel pushing into his skin like a brand.  He shivered, and Tony nipped lightly at Steve’s bottom lip, teeth just barely grazing the delicate skin before his tongue followed, almost in apology.
“Maybe,” Stark agreed.  “I like your stuff.  Tell me about it.”
“Because they wanted you to learn about how to behave, how to have good manners and act appropriately.  A lesson which you seem to have missed,” Howard pointed out.
“That...that wasn’t the deal,” Steve managed to choke out.  The pressure in his cock was overwhelming.  It pounded through Steve’s veins, echoing inside his head.  His chest tightened.  It felt like all the air had left the room. He couldn’t seem to think in any meaningful way, just feel, all of his nerves alight with feeling. His skin was hot and tingling, down to his toes, which curled where they dangled in the water.
“Thanks, Tony.  Night,” Steve said as he closed to the door, leaving Tony standing in the hallway staring dumbly at the door.
Steve looked around the opulent bathroom, with its wonderful pipes of hot water that steamed up from below.  He wasn’t supposed to be here.  He wasn’t supposed to be one of the ones who got to walk away from the war.  Not him, not when Bucky—when so many—who had something waiting for them were resting in unmarked graves while their families clung to memories and the lie that they had all died heroes.  He sighed.  An endless circle, that’s what guilt was, he reminded himself.  Once, some version of himself, the one that had nothing to do except spend days at a time confined to bed, he supposed, but once, he had dreamed.  Not of this, of course, but he had dreamed.  Simple dreams, though they seemed anything but that at the time.  Impossible things, but that was what dreams should be, he had told himself even as he burned with fever or tried to find air when it was all around him.  Someone to love and who loved him, even though he was no one and had nothing to offer except himself.  A family.  A place he belonged where he was useful, where he mattered and contributed, instead of the constant burden he had been to his mother.  A place where he was wanted.  A place filled with happiness and laughter and love, the kind of love that spoke the old words in front of standing stones and danced when the first snow fell.  He looked down at Tony.  Simple, impossible dreams.
you? That can be loud, too, if I do it right,” he waggled his eyebrows, making Steve’s lips curl into a smile almost involuntarily.  Tony caught it and smiled in return.  “There. That’s better.”
“Sometimes, I wish it was different, too,” Tony said, his voice low and husky in the darkness.
“Me,” Steve said.  “I would.  I’ve never felt better than with Iron Man at my side.  But, you’ve got to let me, and the rest of the team, stand by you, too.  The world should know. You deserve that.”
Steve drew a shaky breath, shook his head, “I’m not doing this with you tonight, Buck.  I-I can’t do this with you and then…”  Giving up and wanting to just get the hell out of here, he brushed past Bucky and threw open the door.  He’d heard enough.  Bucky knew him too well, saw too much, things Steve didn’t want to deal with right now.  It was like having all his worst fears spread out before him in bright Technicolor.
“Hey, aren’t you Tony Stark?” a student on the row in front of them asked, giving Tony a speculative look.
It will come to war, one day, won’t it, he wondered, swallowing hard. This isn’t sustainable. For either side.
“How do you want me? Usually I ask that before I get naked.  Dicks out is a really bad negotiating strategy, I’ve found.  So, gorgeous, we doing Ingres or Modigliani?” Kirk asked with a snort of low, breathy laughter, making Steve look up.  Kirk waggled his eyebrows at him as he reclined against the weight bench.
He stretched up on his toes, seeking more, letting his head fall back until Steve’s hand was all but holding him up, and God, it was so good.  Like flying off the highest point of a swing, arcing through the air, not sure how he would land.  He was drowning in heat and warmth and aching need, and just when he thought he couldn’t take any more, Steve shifted his mouth, found some other region of Tony’s mouth to explore, tightened his grip on Tony’s neck and growled, low in the back of his throat, sending the reverberation tremoring past Tony’s lips.  Tony sucked in a sharp breath, and felt his whole body seem to go liquid, spreading out, limbs loosening and muscles going limp.
Tony bit his lip and swiped a hand across his brow.  His stomach roiled, but thankfully, he hadn’t eaten dinner.  Or lunch.  Or…well.  Ty said they’d grab something on the way over, but then Ty had been busy.  He was close on one of his projects. Tony got that.  That was the thing.  Him and Ty, they
“Never hear the end of it from Cap if I messed up his field dressing,” Tony replied, dropping his gaze to the dark red stain that spread over the front of his shirt.  Steve had made some kind of bandage for it out of what looked like part of his uniform and belt.  He studied the makeshift bandage for a moment, then huffed out a burst of air at the irony.  It was truly a tragedy that Steve had apparently ripped his uniform off only to patch Tony up with the scraps, and, to top it off, Tony couldn’t even remember it happening.   The universe was thinking up some truly creative ways to punish him.
Heat-trapping was a petty, vindictive, truly shitty thing to do to anyone, let alone someone like Steve.  It was the worst kind of manipulation.  It happened often enough that even Tony was aware of it.  Hadn’t his mom told him some story about a friend of a friend, twice-removed, whatever, whose daughter ended up with a broken Bond right before her Heat and got some random Alpha on the hook? What a fucking mess.  Literally, he snorted.  He couldn’t do that to Steve.
you a bit.  That’s how I was going to keep you, when you inevitably came to your senses.  Ironic, huh?”
“Good thing no one cares you’re here,” Steve said with a slight roll of his eyes, pulling a notebook out of his backpack and opening it up to where the writing stopped and a fresh, white page waited. What had to be the jump-up in technology from papyrus scrolls came next, some kind of recording device that Steve set out in front of him, presumably for the monks to dip their ink in.
“Excellent.  I’ll take all the credit. You relax and enjoy,” Tony replied with a rakish grin.
“Actually, I do most of the cooking for us,” Steve said.  “Not that I’m great at it, but I can usually manage to put something on the table.  Tony’s got his robots, this whole thing with SHIELD, and, of course, his research—did you know he’s working with Caltech now?  The professor out there, he wants to publish their work in one of those science journals.  Says he’s been invited to give a speech in Switzerland next year. Someplace called CERN?  Anyway, he wants Tony to come along, kind of a thank you for all his hard work,” Steve announced.
“I was kidnapped with less arm-twisting than this,” Tony grumbled.
“He said that I don’t know how to let something good happen to me,” Steve continued in a flat, unaffected tone.  He was staring out the window, not really seeming to see much of anything, but kept letting his gaze slide halfway to Tony before pulling it back.
“So, basically, it’s a wormhole to heaven,” Tony said as he closed his eyes in bliss after the first taste of something called a chocolate dream.  Steve took his change from the lady at register and shoved it into his pocket, then took a big bite of his red velvet.  “Oh my God, never tell Pepper about this place.  I’ll never see her again.”
“Most don’t,” Tony replied with a cant of his head.  “I like it.  Helping. Being a part of it.  The team, they need to focus.  This is something I can do for them.  Take it off their shoulders.”
Almost as he said it, Steve realized how ridiculous the request was. Even if the man still frequented the… establishment, he probably didn’t remember Steve, and if he did, what were the chances he was really going to drop everything to rush to do all that again? Just because Steve needed it, didn’t mean that the stranger needed it. He assumed it was a breach of protocol to even ask. The whole point of a place like this was that you didn’t play favorites, the other person’s identity didn’t matter, but, well. The past two times, it had been perfect. Beyond perfect. He wanted that again, if he could figure out how to find it. Maybe the man didn’t matter, and it was all in Steve’s head, but he couldn’t help feeling the way he did.
Second, as always, a huge shout out to tastes-like-coconut for her awesome beta help!
He dressed carefully for the gala, discarding a never-worn tuxedo in favor of his Army dress uniform.  He rarely got a chance to wear it, but this was a benefit for the DAV, so it seemed appropriate to show respect for those who’d served.  He waited impatiently in the living room for Tony to arrive.  He heard Tony’s footfalls on the top steps before the man himself appeared on the staircase.  Of course, Tony managed to look fantastic, as always, Steve thought, before pushing anything further along those lines from his mind. Tony had paused midway down the stairs and was staring oddly at Steve, making Steve wonder for a moment if Tony hadn’t meant for them to go together.  Maybe Tony had plans.  He hadn’t…well, he hadn’t even considered that, but, of course, he should have realized…
“Buy the VA,” Barnes suggested around a mouthful of cheese.
“Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Fine.  Good.  I should really get JARVIS plugged in at some point, you know?  I’d almost forgotten how quiet and non-sarcastic a room can be up here,” Tony said absently, glancing over at the garage.
Yes, Steve thought, though he simply let his head fall to Tony’s shoulder in answer. He felt a pleased laugh vibrate through Tony’s chest and nuzzled his mouth into the curve of Tony’s neck.
“I know,” Steve finally replied. “I’m still not sure why we’re doing this.”
Something hot and sour curdled in his stomach, spreading up his spine and clawing at his mind.  The image of Tony on his knees in front of that—that woman, that horrible woman, came unbidden, but he couldn’t shake it.  His insides went cold. Bile rose in his throat. He hated it. The whole idea of it was—was
He saw Bucky start to say something, but cut him off.  “Don’t start. Please, Buck?” Steve said, trying to edge out the door before this became a thing.
“What?” Tony asked sharply.
it’s just...what you’re asking of me...to be a part of this, I--” Steve broke off, shaking his head.
“Did he really?” Peggy asked.  “Hard to imagine him running around out here, though I suppose he didn’t always have his head glued to one of those machines of his.  Jarvis said he built this one himself, from scratch, and wrote that man at Apple a strongly-worded letter.”
“So, just to be clear, you’re cool with grand gestures standing in for emotional honesty?  Outstanding, this relationship is going to work out so well,” Tony said, clapping his hands together and snapping his fingers with a flat, self-deprecating grimace twisting across his mouth.
Brock gave Steve a long, considering look.  “Huh,” he said, making the word pop.
“Does How—Dad know?” Tony questioned.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed with a sigh.  “They record everything, though they only keep them for a few months.  Just to be sure there aren’t any complaints with Vice or something, you know, but—” he broke off, flattening his mouth.  “I didn’t think about it. I should’ve thought about it, but…” he shook his head, closing his eyes in frustration.
“I—that—“ Steve stammered, watching the professor’s words appear across the screen.  “That’s nice, Tony, but my way was fine.  I don’t need—whatever this is.”
How hard would it be, really?  It was just sex. He’d had sex.  Sure, not a lot until Brock, at least not more than a few handjobs here and there and a couple of furtive blow jobs where he worried more about getting caught than just about anything else, but he figured their sex life was probably pretty normal now. It wasn’t like sex was a big deal, and it was over pretty quickly, anyway.
It means he thought about me.  While he was away.  He thought about me.   No, that wasn’t…that wasn’t quite it, Tony thought, giving the mug a frown.
“That’s because he’s stalemated, and he knows it!” the King replied.
He walked down the hall, but the billiards room sat empty.  Jarvis had already spirited away the glasses, returned the pool stick to its proper slot on the rack and emptied the ashtray.  Erased, Tony thought.  We do a lot of that around here.
“Hey,” Steve said, making Tony’s head jerk around in startle.  “May I?” he asked, nodding at Tony’s shirtfront where the tie hung halfway between a Windsor knot and something that belonged on Hello Kitty.
Tony could see it so clearly in his head.  Steve, pushing his cart, cleaning up the heaps of Starbucks cups and cigarette butts the build-up to finals week left behind, trying to actually do a good job because he cared, wanted things to look nice, liked being useful, he said.  What had he thought when the deputy showed up? When he looked at the paper?  When he saw those words? Lies, Tony corrected. Those lies.  Lies that this man had legitimized.  Lies that this man put the power of the state behind.  Lies that this man made real, at least to Steve.  Did they wait until the end of his shift to fire him?  Did someone watch him clean out his locker?  Did they escort him off campus? Because this…this person, signed an order that said Steve was dangerous.
“Oh.  Lion,” Steve told him.  Anto picked up a rock and held it out in front of him.  “Rock,” Steve said. He was baring his teeth again and nodding, making more of his words that Tony didn’t understand.
. That the one who holds it, holds it by right.  Whether ordained by God or battle or purchase, whatever your measure, it is as thin as a thread, and there are always those ready to cut it.  After Ty…” he shook his head, looked up at the ceiling, blinking, then slowly turned back to look down at Steve.  “I can’t. Besides, as Rhodey has pointed out to me one too many times, you know far too much of our defenses to ever be allowed to leave.”
“That’s--you don’t even…that was just a stupid story.  How do you even remember…look, you say that, but you don’t know what that really means,” Tony stammered haltingly.  “Not really.  I mean—“
“No billboard, Tony,” Steve ordered, sighing in what Tony assumed was guilt over the broken phone.
“Okay, so…well…what do you remember?” Tony asked. “The last thing you remember.  Right before you woke up here.”
Steve sighed deeply and straightened his spine, almost unconsciously falling into something near enough to parade rest to have the comfort of familiarity. “No, it’s me. It’s nothing. I’m just—sorry. This is…this is all very strange,” Steve admitted. “I’m—I’m trying. When we’re out there, I’ll be fine. I promise.”
“No.  No, let me get this out.  Please.  I need to just…say this.  Half the time, nothing makes sense anymore, and everything that I thought I knew, it’s like…it’s just gone.  And there’s this…this blank space in front of me, but it’s that white space, that white that’s so white, it almost hurts to look at, so I just…don’t.  I don’t look at it.  See, so, I need you to tell me,” Tony broke off, drawing in a shuddering breath.  Steve’s shoulder was wet.  Tony’s whole body felt shaky, tense and too loose at the same time.  “I need you to tell me how to do this.  Because, I’m…everywhere I look, it’s too bright, and I can’t see.  I can’t see, Steve.  How we do this.   I can’t see it.  So.  I need you to tell me.  Please.
“Were you homeschooled by the Church Lady on a Martian potato farm?” Tony demanded, cinching his shoulders up and rolling his eyes heavenward.  “How do you not know the Stones and the Beatles?”
“Why, hello, old chum, old pal,” Tony answered.
“I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true,” Steve replied with a shrug.  “I’m sorry I went off script.”
“You know me so well,” Cap said sarcastically, then chuckled, almost deprecatingly, like he was acknowledging the thread of truth in Tony’s teasing. Tony found himself grinning in response, though Cap couldn’t see him, of course.  “See you, Sunday, Iron Man.”
“The right partner,” Steve said instead, hoping that even though Tony wouldn’t exactly understand the reference, he would hear the feeling behind it, what it meant to Steve to be able to say that to someone, finally.   Tony stared at him for a long, silent moment.  For a heartbeat, Steve had the terrible thought that Tony was going to say he wasn’t interested in being…in dealing…with that.  Steve opened his mouth to try to reassure Tony that it didn’t mean they couldn’t, um…do things.

“Good news for SI, then, huh?” Obie said in a speculative tone that was trying hard to be placating.  “Army, eh?  Science Board’s a tough nut to crack, Howard.  Looks like Tony here’s something of a golden goose, as they say.  Hey, look,” Obie said, putting his hands up in the air, palms out.  A gesture of surrender, Tony thought.  “If the military folks don’t care, then I don’t care.  I’m just the money guy, okay?  Someone has to look after the books if we want to keep enjoying this kind of thing,” he said, waving a hand around the room.  “But, Tony’s the one they want, fine by me.  We’ll be progressive.  Hell, this is California.  Probably get some good press out of it.”
The alien hummed again, then moved down to the end of the table again and crawled up inside, laying next to Tony.  Tony turned his head to look at him, caught again by the vivid blue eyes that watched him so carefully. “You’re dgoing to do the whole mind meldy thing again, aren’t y--oh, there we go,” Tony sighed as the alien leaned his head forward until their foreheads touched.
“You know, I’ve heard that exact bullshit answer come out of my own mouth,” Tony replied after a beat of silence, though his voice was surprisingly gentle and devoid of judgment.  “I’ll help.  You know I will.  When all this is over, you, Barnes, we’ll figure it out, okay?  Whatever you need.  We’ll take care of it,” he promised softly, so only Steve could hear.
Rhodey shook his head slowly, then huffed out a laugh.  Then another.  Then he and Pepper were suddenly chortling like loons while Happy pulled the car out of the parking lot.
“Is that what this is, Mr. Stark?  Reevaluating your life choices?” another reporter asked.
That didn’t sit well.  “I don’t know that that’s really fair…I mean, it wasn’t Tony’s fault that I…well, that I left Mr. Hammer for the evening.  It doesn’t seem right to charge him for that,” Steve said, frowning at the idea.
“Barbecue on the roof this Saturday.  Tony needs to borrow your George Foreman,” Steve broke in, with a nod towards Barnes.
“Yeah, yeah, baby, that’s good, isn’t it?” Tony panted, sealing the praise against Steve’s lips.
Steve,” Barnes ground out.
And Steve had been pissed.  No shocker there, really, but—well, looking back…Steve’s eyes had been wide, body practically vibrating, with anger, or so Tony had thought, but that honestly wasn’t really how Steve did anger.  He was more of a tell you straight up what was wrong kind of guy and then explain with bullet points and a slideshow how you could fix it.  No, he hadn’t been angry, not really.  Or, okay, he had been a bit angry, Tony amended thinking back.  But not just that.  Steve had been scared.  Again.  For him.  Because…he reached for the thread of thought, somehow precariously floating around his brain, like grabbing for the string of balloon trying to drift away.  Steve had been scared for him because…because he cared.  Steve cared.
.  Hollowed out where there should be something, some emotion, anger or indignation or something, anything at all, that just wasn’t there anymore.  Whatever it was, it sure as hell didn’t feel like a good thing.  It felt like…well, it felt like a thing he didn’t want to think about, so there was that.    Sam would tell him the list of things he was carrying around was getting a tad long, but Sam managed to never make that sound like a judgment, probably because Sam carried enough himself to understand how hard putting any of down could be.
"I did. I read about it in the rep--the, ah. News. News report. I'm sorry about, well. Everything.  What happened in Afghanistan. The incident at your lab.  The crash.  That must've been terrible for you, losing someone so close to you like th--" Steve tried.
The alien shifted around the table and moved between Tony’s outstretched legs.  The not-gel bubbled and rolled, splaying Tony’s legs further apart. The alien was watching Tony.  Not curious like before, but focused. Intense. He made more noises, soft and soothing, almost like chanting.
“What did I tell you would happen if you left my bed again without permission?” Tony asked, almost nonchalantly, voice silky and smooth.
“Drop your left leg a bit.  Yeah, good.  Ah…what?” Steve replied.
“We’ll go look,” Tony said, answering the question Steve couldn’t ask in public. “Don’t want to impulse buy something this important.  Should be a statement piece.  Something classy and tasteful that can stand the test of time.  But, with far more me.”
“What?” Tony blurted out in confusion.  “Of course you can! What does that even—of course you can.  You’re fine.  Forget--forget what I said.  I didn’t mean that!  Hell, I’m the one who has the issues, really, we both know that.  If anyone shouldn’t be on the team, it’s me, let’s face it.  You’re—of course you can lead the team.”
this.   You want to act like you don’t?  Like you’re above this?  Special?  Fine.  But, we both know better, don’t we?   You really want to go through your Heat again without an Alpha?”
“Eat your donut, please,” Jarvis interrupted.  Tony shot him an apologetic grin and reached for one of the pastries.
“Have you seen Saw?” Jim asked.  Tony nodded and sipped his shake with a smile.  “A bit like that.  Less clowns. More possibility of bodily harm.”
Tony found himself focusing on another Alpha and his Omega, who were sitting across from each other at one of the booths.  She was young, blonde, courtesy of a store-bought box, and wearing too much make-up.  Not as young as he’d first thought, but trying to look it.  The Alpha was older, an accountant or lawyer-type, with wire-rimmed glasses and a sensible haircut.  Probably drove a BMW and called it a Beamer.   Watched The Wire down at the gym doing his cardio and pretended to read the stock reports and care about what he would refer to as ‘the situation in Syria.’  All that, who wouldn’t try a little Fountain of Botox to keep him?
“He’s…I mean, he seems pretty great.  Easy to talk to.  I don’t know.  Easier than it should be, anyway, blind date and all,” Tony told him.
Steve followed the direction Cam was pointing, and sure enough, between a gap in the mountains, the main tower of Highcastle loomed over the Ridge.  Seeming to almost be born out of the dark tan, almost gray, stone of the craggy mountain itself, Highcastle was the nearly impregnable fortress that was home to the Lord of the Ridge.  It sat atop a peak that was almost sheer rock, with nary a slope to it, and was accessible only by a steep path that only a few hardy locals would even attempt, and a pulley system that hefted men and supplies up and down the rockface.  It was, truly, a marvel, Steve could admit. Tony said the type of stone used to build it was all but depleted now, along with the way in which to work the stone to be able to build something like this. The people who had originally built it came over with the first Stark king, and brought with them little more than a few tools and their secrets, now lost to time.  As they wound their way closer, Steve could see where repairs had been done to the outer fortifications using a clearly different type of stone. Still, it didn’t detract from the sight. He shook his head in awe, silently agreeing with Cam’s exclamation of amazement.
There were marks on his hips and the insides of his thighs, already bluish in the morning light. He traced over them absently, pressing against the darkening flesh a bit and relishing the sharp, deep sting that came with them and the knowledge that Tony, who cared for him like he was something breakable and infinitely precious, had been so overcome that he had put those marks there. He brought his hands around to rub over his flat stomach. It was still hard to believe that it could be happening right now. Of course, it was way too soon to tell anything. Tony would know first, anyway. And Bruce had cautioned them not to be too hopeful, what with the unknown effects of the serum. But still.
“The limo’s too hard to park,” Tony said as he pocketed his sunglasses and tugged his phone out of his pocket, already beginning to tap away at the screen.  “Takes up two meters, and I never seem to have change on me.”  He gave Steve a slight eye roll that told him that Tony didn’t really care whether or not the limo was hard to park, but Happy was nodding vigorously, so Steve figured this, like the badges, was an ongoing topic of debate between the two of them.
.  He noticed and cared enough to try to accommodate Steve, which mattered, though Steve supposed it said something about his interactions of late that basic human decency was a tipping point.
“Glad you’re easily impressed,” Tony said weakly, letting his head fall back against the soft pad of the table.
He walked past the crowd without a backward glance, though he could feel the stares on his back as he pushed the doors to the locker room open and walked out. For once, it didn’t bother him.  For once, he wanted people to see him. See what he was like after his time away.  See what was
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Fugitive, big underwater prison thing, future of the planet on the line, yadda yadda,” Tony grumbled.  “Come home.”
He watched Tyber’s jaw work, his brow slumping with anger, his body practically vibrating with it.  Then he made a dismissive noise and turned, thrashing back through the forest while the rest of the clan slowly followed suit.
“Oh, I like you,” Stark said with a trilling timbre to his voice as he wagged a finger at Steve.
“Well, you definitely have a type, don’t you?” Tony sighed after a few, very distinct, memories assailed him.“Okay, I’m not naming you after someone I know. It’s weird. Your magic alien dick put healing eggs in my ass like some Goop party trick.”  The alien frowned at him in confusion. “Never mind,” Tony said, waving a hand through the air as another familiar face filled his mind. “Okay, okay, that’s...yeah, that could actually work. I mean, he’s a comic book character, so not an actual person, and you do have the whole blond, blue-eyed, beefcake thing going for you.  God, I was obsessed with those as a kid. Yes,” Tony hissed, giving the alien a disgruntled look as another image pulled to the forefront of his mind. “I discovered them again when I was in my discovering myself phase, don’t judge. It was a very trying time. Fine. Steve. Suits you.”
“Are you kidding, gorgeous?  Wait ‘til they get a look at you!  I’ll be the envy of every idiot schmoozer in there.   Come on,” his client replied, two-stepping to the side to give Steve room to exit the limo.  As he did, he was aware of a line of paparazzi and other people, most of whom were paying him little actual attention, but the sudden influx of attention jarred him.  He hadn’t been expecting that and found himself staring stupidly around, unsure what to do but follow the guy into the venue.  His client was looking around, eyes perked up, scanning the crowd for something, but apparently not finding it by the frown that filled his features.
He walked out, wrapped his hands around the edge of the balcony and looked out at the castle surround again.  Watched the guards dutifully stand at attention as a patrol walked by.  There would be three patrols, he knew.  The other would follow along in another half hour.  A long enough break for two people to slip out, unnoticed in the throngs of merchants and servants going in and out of the castle.  Stolen robes, simple ones, not like the lush, embroidered silks that filled the closet here.  Scarves to hide the collars.  Something to cover his head.  His blonde hair stood out too much here.  It could be remembered.
“Right,” Bucky said. “You’ve got a real nice dick, Stevie—”
It was the papers in her hand that Tony couldn’t look away from.  His stomach roiled and his throat tightened as he tried to swallow past the sudden surge of panic.  He knew what they were. Obie was a lot of things—cruel, calculating, manipulative, the list went on and on—but Obie was, above all else,
“Did we have technical difficulties?” Tony drawled with a satisfied smirk.  He peered over his shoulder to where the camera, or what was left of it, was on the floor next to the ladder.  “Feeling a little more enthused about our Christmas project?”
“Yeah,” Steve said. “Yeah, it was… it was perfect.”
it hurt.  It shouldn’t.  He should have expected it.  Hell, he should probably appreciate it, if anything.  Would it have really been better to see Tony and then get handed a check and a thanks-for-a-nice-night?  Probably not.  Probably, that would have been worse.
“It… yeah, it was hot,” Steve agreed, nodding, a smile forming.  “Definitely hot.”
“I did strike the killing blow, which I am sure is because of my amazing prowess and not because I am the King and Lord Ellis’ hunters allowed me the honor,” Tony quipped.
“Well, he ought not be running off in the first place,” Howard added.  “You hear me?” he said, wagging a finger at Tony, who had stood up only to find himself scooped up into Jarvis’s arms, small hands holding the figure dangling down Jarvis’s back while he buried his head in the curve of Jarvis’s neck where his tweed coat met the collar while Steve’s mind conjured a golden glow, warm and enveloping, protecting them all even when there wasn’t much to be done.  “Is that still recording?  God, turn that thing off for Christ’s sake.  Peggy—”
“Okay,” Steve replied, a slow, soft, somewhat disbelieving smile spreading over his face.
He took them away from me.
“I did not roll around in pig shit, Kadina,” Nyma shot back after a moment of silence, sending a frown at the older woman.  “Why must you say these things in front of him?  We had a farm.  No
“Huh? Oh, er. No. Thanks,” Steve said, shifting uncomfortably. “I should go.”
Phantom cold coated Steve’s skin as the memory bloomed bright and clear in his head. He grinned, chuckling lowly, and making a tutting sound.  It had been a long time since he thought of that.  He didn’t know why he was thinking about it tonight--about
She didn’t look old, not exactly.  Not the way Steve remembered her from the nursing home.  Just not young anymore, and in a way, it was almost worse to look at her like this.  There was a wrongness to it that kept disconcerting him, like opening a book in the middle part of a story.  She had always been suspended in his mind like some kind of marker of his life. Before the ice, and then after the ice, and here she was, in the middle, where life and work and love and all those things existed for her in this in-between time when he wasn’t supposed to be here.
“You should eat something,” Steve encouraged.
To Steve’s left, Tony was drowning.
the way I heard it,” Coulson shot back, though the placid expression never faltered.
Steve stared down the road where the man had been for a long time, until the night’s cold sank into his skin and his teeth started to chatter, then finally turned and trudged back down the road, cut through the forest and under the fence that framed the small patch of land that the Rogers could claim, and back to his house.
“They want to feel special, Steve. Not as if  you just happened to find time for them, but that you are always looking forward to seeing them.  It’s part of the fantasy for them.  So, no, I will not call Mr. Stark, Tony Stark of Stark Industries, one of the largest and most lucrative companies in the world, and tell him your busy schedule has suddenly cleared and you now have room for him,” she finished with a note of warning in her voice.
“What?” Tony snapped, his eyes snapping up to Steve’s.
“Shall we?” Tony asked, nodding his head towards the table.
“M’good,” Tony coughed a bit, the water gurgling back up his throat in some kind of battle with air that air was winning.  He coughed again, drank a bit more, then pushed the cup away and looked up at Steve.
“Yeah,” Steve said, his voice a broken whisper.
“Remember, be nice.  Smile for him.  Tell him how excited you are.  Show him what a good boy you are, how polite.  Let him talk.  They like it when  you listen.  Be impressed.  Tell him what an honor this is that he’s picked you,” his mother was saying, though he’d heard it enough times over the past couple of days he could have recited it backwards.
“On the one hand, I feel I should say something about your low standards.  On the other hand, let’s face it, that might be in your favor here,” Pepper said, one side of her mouth tugging up.
“Heal,” JARVIS’ voice said again.  “Fix.”
“You don’t need to,” Steve said, and God, that sounded weak and almost pleading even to his own ears.
“Genetic?” Steve questioned with a raised eyebrow, though he sounded at least interested.  Steve liked the ‘bots, that much Tony knew.    It was a pretty blatant play for a distraction, but it seemed to be doing the job.
“What happens if you don’t 'share’?” Tony asked.
Tony was not going to make this easy. On either of them.  Perhaps it was better that way, Steve thought, bracing his back a bit straighter and squaring his shoulders, body suddenly thrumming with a jittery energy.  They were not so very different, the two of them.  Neither could trust something that wasn’t hard won.
“You mean your little Scentsy warmer here?” Tony said under his breath as Barnes brushed past him.  “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
The gift is life.
“They used to watch the testing from the Sky Room at the old Desert Inn,” Steve said. He turned to look out the tinted window, where the Strip blazed with color.  “The rich and powerful people who ran Vegas.  They’d have parties up there and wait for the mushroom clouds.  I read that somewhere.”
Steve knocked Stane’s hand off his shoulder and stepped away in one fluid motion.
Stark shrugged. “I was getting bored out here anyway,” he added with a small smile.
Bruce came barreling in the door behind them, out of breath and panicked by the sound of his voice.  “Oh my God, is he—“ Bruce started, eyes going immediately to the machines.
“You really think the serum will help,” Steve asked.
Tony made his apologies to the food gods, who looked suspiciously like chatty, stainless steel versions of Guy Fieri and Gordon Ramsay in his head, and dumped the omelet in the trash. He put the other dishes and the rest of the silverware away, then leaned back against the counter, running his hands over the silver, metal edge.
Definitely, don't answer that.
“Hmm,” Coulson replied noncommittally.  “This is us,” he said, as the elevator pinged and came to a stop on their floor.
“Me neither. Okay. So, tell me about it,” Tony urged.
“It's fine, Tony,” Steve cut in. “Hey, you said you'd already built one of these reactor things?” Steve asked, clearly changing the subject, for which Tony couldn't help but be grateful. Every time his mind touched on the thought of something literally blowing up underneath Steve, it sort of derailed itself into uselessness, the mental equivalent of Gandalf shouting 'None Shall Pass,' or something.
Yes, there will be a part II.  Because I can't shut up with these two.
“Shoot,” Steve said good-naturedly as he pushed open the glass exit door and held it for Tony.  Tony blinked at the sudden brightness and pulled his sunglasses out of his pocket, shoving them on his face while deciding what to ask.
As he was leaving, he called Brock, like he promised, and explained that the bank had to put a ten day hold on a check like that, which Brock grumbled about, but there wasn’t really anything  they could do to change it, so they would just have to wait it out.
“Thinking what?” Tony asked.
“Well…er…I guess ‘have a good time’?” Steve said with a fond, familiar smile.
“Nothing,” the pale man said, blowing the word out with a puff of air through his lips.
“I’m sure,” Steve said, then smiled ruefully under the scarf wrapped over his nose and mouth. “I have no doubt that you will have a great deal to teach Peter one day.”
“Yeah.  She works at the club.  I asked her to grab some stuff for me. Thanks for bringing it up,” Steve said, walking over to pick up the bag.
“Yeah, yeah, totally, man,” Mitchell chimed in, nodding vigorously.  “I mean, I like pussy as much as the next guy, but I’d blow Stark for a few G’s, you know what I mean?”
“I shall miss her, too,” Cam sighed.  “I wish she would come, but she says the journey will be too difficult on her.  I am to bring her back some fine cloth and thread, if I find any.  She will make you even more beautiful things, and the King will be most pleased.”
Was this strategy? Lulling Tony into complacency to make things easier on himself? He could tell himself that it was. He wanted to tell himself that’s what it was. Seeing Tony happy was a siren’s call, and like that song, he knew he should resist it. Heeding it would only lead to ruin. For both of them. But, he couldn’t. He was too weak. Too weak to deny the part of him that desperately wanted this moment of happiness between them before he destroyed it all.

ness.  You smell like my Grandma, Rogers, he remembered a couple of the boys in the downstairs tenement would say, brushing against his shoulder as they walked past him to school, walking fast with their lungs that didn’t burn when they tried to breathe and their legs that didn’t hitch and their backs that weren’t curved and misshapen.  How he had hated them, then, in that moment. Envied and hated them.
“How did you two meet?” Tony asked when they stepped out of the ballroom into the hall.
“Screw luck. Bad luck, good luck, screw it.  I’ll take fate. I’ll take meant to be, because this?  There’s nothing about this that feels random,” Tony said. “I have been trying to get a dance from you in one sense or the other since we met,” Tony replied, winding his arms around Steve’s neck.  “This. Right here. Right now. It took some craziness to get here, sure, but....I think this is the dance we were always meant to have.”
Steve shouldn’t sound like that, but Tony had put that there somehow, and now he didn’t know what he was supposed to do or say to fix it.  Everything he’d done so far had been wrong, had ended up with his Omega barely able to look at him and obviously upset and it hurt, it hurt deep down in his gut like someone had taken something and jabbed it in and twisted and kept twisting and he just wanted it to stop, just stop, but he didn’t know how to make that happen.
Finally, sometime around Bucky’s discussion of a cooking show Nat was obsessed with even though she didn’t cook, Steve recognized Natasha’s car pull up at the corner, and hurried over.
“It is,” Steve agreed.  “But, you’re not just our benefactor and tech support.  You’re Iron Man,” he said, his voice going all breathy and amazed and making Tony’s stomach flip-flop like a politician.  “Tony Stark is Iron Man.”
“Need anything for tonight?” Steve asked.
“It’s a Kodak, as you well know, and Fallon doesn’t want to hear it.  He doesn’t think Americans will buy those ‘cheap gadgets’ as he calls them.  They got the SHIELD contract and sent it over as a thank you.  Daniel’s been making home movies. Of the family, Howard, calm yourself,” Peggy said, her rich, melodious voice, still tinged with enough of an accent to stand out, echoed on the screen.
“Good,” Bruce said.  “Tony…look, none of this was your fault.  Whatever happened, it happened when the jet blew.  He got winged with the repulsor, but that actually may have helped keep the blood loss from being worse.”
Tony was trying too hard for joviality, Steve could see that plainly enough, but he was trying, reaching out for something he thought Steve would enjoy.  The least Steve could do was meet Tony’s attempt halfway.
Cam smiled widely and gave a whoop of excitement.  They both watched the boy scamper out of the room.  Steve thought he even caught the younger of the two guards smiling a bit as he held the door for the boy.
“I was just over at the slots,” Steve frowned, turning a bit to where he had been sitting not too far away. Though, the casino was crowded and all the lights and noises made it hard to find people, he supposed.
“Well, newsflash, Steve, I don’t think it’s fucking working,” Tony ground out.
“Doesn’t seem to bode well,” Steve had said, but there had been a ghost of a smile lurking there, so Tony hadn’t worried.  “You okay?” Steve had asked then, sounding concerned.
“Tony!” Pepper shouted, aghast.  Steve’s eyes were darting between them like he was watching Serena and Venus on the grass court, but Tony caught the blink-and-you-miss-it quirk of Steve’s lips and couldn’t resist grinning in return.  Steve dipped his head and looked at the carpet where his new shoes were digging a rut in the wool rug, but not before Tony saw his shoulders hunch a with a bitten-back laugh.  “My God.  Would  you—just go.  Happy has the car waiting downstairs.  You have reservations at Guy Savoy’s.  Go.  And remember,” she said, coming to stand beside him and flicking away nonexistent lint off his shoulder.  “You’re happy.  Thrilled.  You’re in love.  It’s ridiculous, but you just can’t help yourself.  Got it?”
“You want to hear about my childhood?” Steve asked, brow furrowing a bit as he looked between the painting and Tony.
“No you don’t.  And neither do I,” Tony said, his voice soft, but furrows forming on his brow. “A king has many ready to stand for his defense, but as a man…I have precious few who would.  What you did today, it—it meant a great deal to me. And it terrified me,” he said, looking down at his hands for a moment before raising his eyes to Steve. “I don’t want to change who you are, Steve.  Who you are is—you are like no one else I have ever met. You see something that is wrong and you just, you do something about it. You have no idea how unusual that makes you. I just want to protect you.  Some of this—the veil, the guards, all the damn rules—I know it may not seem like it, but it is to keep you safe. If people knew what you meant to me…” he trailed off and looked away again.
“You should see it in action,” Stark replied, though he was smiling, clearly pleased and proud.
“Your chariot awaits,” Tony replied, sweeping out his arm.  Steve tried a smile at the gesture, but it didn’t seem to want to fit on his face, and from Tony’s look, he could tell he wasn’t doing a good job of it.  He kept his eyes on the car, where Happy had jumped out to open the door, and struggled inside as quickly as he could.  Tony sidled into the backseat next to him, and Happy shut the door, then rounded the car and hopped in the driver’s seat.
“We could’ve worked this out on the island,” Tony groused, idly shifting his chair closer to Steve and reaching to lace his fingers through Steve’s hand, feeling instantly better when he could feel Steve’s warm skin beneath his.
“Right. That’s definitely an important distinction, because you are such a take-it-slow, let’s-look-before-I-leap kind of a guy,” Bucky replied, nodding his head and drawing his brows together in a mock frown.    “Also, that wasn’t a denial.”
He was, Steve thought with a sharp pang. Tony had been waiting for him for a long time.  Too long, Steve thought with a grimace, but that was over.  The same thread.  A loop.  A circle, he thought, mind flashing to the disc in Tony’s chest as his eyes fell on his shield.  There was no meeting halfway, no partial journey to take.  There was only nothing or everything, and Tony was everything.
“Yeah,” Steve replied softly.  “I know you worry, Tony.  Come on, don’t look at me like that,” Steve pleaded.  “I know we talked about waiting, but…Tony, being out there.  Seeing what was done to this city.  I can’t keep cleaning up when I could be doing something to stop this from happening again.”
Steve nodded.
“It wasn’t--it wasn’t you.  Not really.  I just…I didn’t know how to deal with you…being you,” Steve admitted after a short pause while the computer finished installing its upgrades and faded to black.  “The CEO was there, and you were talking about all that investment stuff, and I was…holding a mop.  I’m not embarrassed by what I do,” Steve said quickly, then dropped his gaze to where the laptop screen was cycling through the various updates.  “I guess, I’m worried maybe you are.”
“That I shouldn’t be doing this.  That it’s crazy.  That I need therapy.  Go see the trauma guy Rhodey knows or something.  That this is guilt or anger or I don’t know, okay!?!” Tony heard himself shout.  Somewhere, a bird objected to the disturbance, cawing at them from its perch.  “That it’s fine for a project, in the workshop back in Malibu, but that needs to be the end of it.  That I have no business even thinking that I could…do something.  Something like…whatever this…
he remembered her telling him one evening as they sat around a fire that was little more than warm embers.  It’s the last thing Bucky would have wanted, and yet, it was the only thing Steve could picture himself doing. Certainly not this.  Never this.  The rest of his days were supposed to have been spent doing penance.  This didn’t feel at all like that, not anymore.
“How do you even know about any of this?” Rhodey asked.
“He is.  More important than anything,” Tony replied.
The gel held him, supporting the curve of his stomach where it would otherwise be uncomfortable, and the alien still had his arms wrapped protectively around Tony’s stomach, stroking it almost absently as Tony drifted between wakefulness and sleep.  The alien’s cock had stilled, finally, though the massive girth remained inside of him, keeping Tony feeling filled up in front and behind, his whole body feeling incredibly full and tight. His own cock was half-hard, he realized with a jolt of surprise. Full there, too, he thought.  Full everywhere.
“Hey, Boss,” Happy announced. Well.  Happy’s chin announced.
Steve nodded.  Then actually tried it and found that proposition took a bit more doing than he realized, but between the two of them, he managed to get his feet under him and follow the King into the bedchamber.  The King nudged him forward until his thighs hit the edge of the bed and he sat down heavily and looked up at the King who ran his hands down the sides of Steve’s face before dropping them to Steve’s shoulders and pushing him back onto the pillows.  Steve swung his legs up onto the bed and waited.
“That man can talk your ear off,” Tony sighed.  “He loves his horses more than his wife, I think.”
“Josh, really,” Rebecca admonished.
“I guess. Sometimes,” Steve answered stiffly, lacing and unlacing his hands, like he couldn’t decide what to do with them.
“Me, too,” Steve said.  He as looking up at the numbers on the elevator dial, watching as they ticked up to the Palazzo suite at the top.  “Thanks again for the clothes.”
“It did.  And they painted it the king’s colors of red and blue and drew a white star on the center, to mark where it came from,” Steve finished, then smiled, curling his hand into a fist.  He could almost feel the weight of it, so familiar was it in his mind, like an extension of his arm.  A part of him.
Well, dear husband, you have come to the right place, Tony thought, mentally cracking his knuckles as he pulled out his phone and started typing out long lines of code.  This. This one thing.  This, he could fix.
“Barnes is why he’s…” Pepper started, then trailed off and looked away.
“Picking flowers,” Bruce called out, his head popping up from behind a dessicated log that sat in a copse of nearby trees.  Steve watched Bruce shake his head in apparent surrender, then go back to whatever he was doing.
“Sit,” the King said after a moment, indicating the chair next to him.  He shot Steve a bleary, baleful look as Steve sat down.
“Don’t say anything,” Steve repeated, a furrow forming on his brow.
It was already happening, Steve wanted to say, but he just nodded. He could feel it.  This burgeoning warmth and contentment when he looked at Tony. His mind called up an image of Tony asleep in a big bed of white sheets, twisted in a down comforter. His hair was askew, mouth open as he dreamed. The feeling that curled deep inside Steve was like nothing he could name, but it was everything.  Perfect. Tony was
Fuck you, Alice.
“I’m saying that I’m not going to let them make me feel like that over these videos.  Whatever else, whatever happened, it got me here, and here…here is good, Tony. I’m not going to let them make me feel badly about it,” Steve said. He turned to catch Tony’s eye.  Tony’s hand that was mid-stroke in his hair stilled. “I like where I am.”
This is what it’s like, Tony thought with a start.  This whole relationship…
“Well,” Bruce said, a chagrined expression tightening his features. “That’s something, I guess.”
, Tony told him, laying his head against Steve’s shoulder and looking over at their shared reflection.
It sounded nice, but, no, Steve didn’t think he would.  Not yet. Soon, maybe. It was easier to think now, and he thought, yeah, maybe soon.  But, not now. For now, this was good, he decided, the thought clear and warm.
“Great. What’d you got?” Rhodey asked.
“Oh!” she said with a startled, tinkering laugh, bringing her hand to her throat.  She blinked at him, mouth agape. Her companion, a short, round man dressed in an orange robe, reached out and placed a hand on her arm, though she tossed it off and stepped forward.  Her head tilted to the side, regarding Steve with a long look that trailed from his bare feet all the way up, stopping briefly on the collar that peeked out from beneath his robe.
Tony peeked up at him.  His eyes were wide and coal-dark in the low light of the hearth.   Curls of dark, wispy hair were plastered to his forehead with sweat, but he smiled at Steve, a pleased, satisfied look that made Steve’s chest tighten and burn with an emotion he knew he could not name.
Thanks so much for reading and supporting this one!
“Quite common, I assure you,” Lord Rand chimed in from behind them.  “The Highcastle earned its name for a reason, after all,” he added, forcing a light chuckle that seemed to break the pallor.
“Major Carmichael’s alternate had to recuse himself due to personal reasons,” Matt said smoothly.  “Which left General Briar to step in.”
Steve blinked slowly at him.  He honestly had no idea what to say to that.  He’d never heard Stark talk like that, with such warmth and openness, about any of them before, but he couldn’t deny that it sounded genuine.
“I heard that,” Howard called out, a familiar grin splitting his face.  That was the Howard Steve remembered, hiding there as if under a layer of dust.
He didn’t want to try.
“Well. It is the way of things, I suppose,” Steve replied.  He leaned back against the bed, a sudden uncertainty filling him as Tony’s hands slipped from his shoulders. He should be frightened, shouldn’t he?  He couldn’t muster it. Mostly, he was just tired.  Tired of this body that failed him and this world that demanded so much to live in it.
Tony waited, staring down at the screen, his stomach churning.  Surely the universe would not create a guy that hot and deny him to a whole gender. That seemed wildly unfair.
“And you might be the first person to say that. At least to genuinely mean it,” Tony said, a half-smile ghosting over his lips.
“Uh-huh.  How about how it kind of sounds like you basically told him you were happy to spend time with James doing something you hated because, hey, it’s James!  But you didn’t have any interest in doing the same with him,” Pepper questioned, steepling her elbows on her desk as she peered around her computer monitor at him.
“What’s in it for you, right? Why risk it?” Tony asked. “I just need a few days. A few days, and this contact of mine, Batroc, he’s going to take the sample tech I gave him not to a terrorist cell, like the Feds are currently freaking out about, but to Obediah Stane, the CEO of Stark Industries, who is then going to give it to Alexander Pierce. You’ve heard of him, right? Okay,” Tony continued at Steve’s slow nod. “Pierce not going to turn this over to the authorities. In fact, he’s going to use it to try to make weapons for a group called Hydra. Heard of them? No? Well, very bad people, suffice it to say. Like Nazi bad. Look, there’s a lot more to it, but I’m telling you this so you’ll understand that this isn’t some game for me. This is real. This matters. I can’t let them get their hands on this tech, not this way. It’s too out in the open. The Feds would be all over it and the whole thing would go South and Pierce would skitter back into his hidey-hole.   I can’t just destroy it now, because they know about it and if I blow this hard drive to kingdom come, they’ll be all over my files in a heartbeat.”
Steve looked over his shoulder, up and down and around the tiny apartment like it held some kind of answer for that.  Tony could see him biting his lip, but when he turned back to face Tony, his face was slack and soft, younger somehow.
Our flag bleeds rivulets of red, reminders of what we lost for that one thing.  It bears the map of the stars that serves as a guide across the Dark Sea for those who leave everything behind for that one thing. Bucky died, because he believed that one thing was worth fighting for.   He shouldn’t want anything as much as that one thing, but God help him, he did.  He wanted Tony.  He wanted this, in here, like it was just a moment ago.
“Well, that’s your first mistake.  No one trusts my judgment. Hell, I don’t even trust my judgment most of the time,” Tony objected, throwing his hands up in the air.   “Vote, don’t vote, I don’t even care.  Just, you know, don’t vote one way because of me.  Let your conscience be your cricket. Or whatever.”
“Steve’s really excited to see Rhodey again,” Tony told Pepper.
“Steve,” Bucky said from where he leaned against the doorway.  “You really think wardrobe combination is going to somehow fool him into thinking you’re there for his winning personality?  Come on.  He knows why you’re doing this.”
Tony could hear his own heartbeat filling his ears in a rush of pounding he could feel in his throat.  His chest was tight, prickling with pinpoints of sensation, and Tony realized he’d forgotten to breathe.  He sucked in a gulp of air, and opened his mouth to say something, but no words came out, just a soft, breathy oh-sound that got partially stuck in his throat.  This is what they mean by weak in the knees, Tony thought to himself.  This blissful, draining feeling.  His mouth was dry.  He seemed to be able to breathe or swallow, and not both, so he chose air, but it burned its way through his chest when he drew in a deep breath.  There was a sick, queasy feeling low in his stomach, and he could feel himself clenching up, trying to stop what was happening.
“It—“ Tony started.
“Tell me, then,” Steve said. “Please.”
“Um, yeah,” Barnes said.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve put in, mouth flattening against the words.
“Think it makes you sound pretty human, to be honest.  Not to mention that you are checking on him. You’ve been calling, right? And didn’t you say you sent your friend over?  The scary lady who I thought was a dancer who threatened to make a necklace of certain parts of me of which I’m rather fond if I touched you during our hypothetical lap dance?” Tony asked, trying and somewhat succeeding to get a genuine smile out of Steve.  “It’s only been a couple of days, Steve.  You didn’t exactly leave him tied up in the yard with a bowl of water and one of your old t-shirts.  Wait, did you?  I’m not kink-shaming, but…”
“Stacy,” the woman said.
Well, fuck.
“I think of you often, Your Highness,” Steve replied honestly.
You promised, he thought, hand fisting in the front of Steve’s shirt.
Steve scrolled through the various faculty and program pages until the sun was low enough over the mountains that he figured Tony would emerge from his garage soon. Finally, he pushed himself off the sofa and walked into the kitchen where a drawer held a number of menus for local restaurants.  He leafed through them until he found one promising Italian-style pizza, whatever that meant.  He had no idea what Tony would like, so picked four options at random and decided to hope for the best.
“Maybe.  Maybe I… well, by any measure, I must still have strong feelings about what happened to you, and since you won’t speak of it, my mind makes it even worse than it likely was,” Tony said, then grimaced and looked down at Steve.  “I’ve dreamed of you encased in ice. Like a coffin around you.”
“Or something,” Tony said with a raise of his eyebrows.  “He really doesn’t know it’s me?”
“Tell you what.  You take a hundred of the bravest men you know and give me a thousand cowards, and we’ll see how we do,” Steve offered as he flipped through the pages of the book Tony had dropped on the ottoman in front of the large, down-cushioned chair that had appeared, without comment, in the workshop one evening a fortnight ago.  “I’m not saying there isn’t something to be gleaned from a study of history, but Vestigus never fought a single battle.  Half his source material is second or third hand accounts of commanders more concerned with preserving their own glory than giving any kind of accurate assessment.”
“What do you mean, it
“Tony, what are you talking about?” Steve asked, cocking his head to the side as he watched Tony with a confused frown.  It was one thing to be given a Guiltmobile because his Alpha felt bad about fucking around.  But the honest confusion on Steve’s face was just too God-damned much.  Anger fired through his veins, stretching his skin over his bones like he didn’t fit on himself anymore, like he could peel it off and show Steve there was a living, breathing, beating heart underneath.
“If you know the answer, why ask the question?” Tony said, taking a bite of the halibut.  “You kept tabs. That’s nice.  Makes my stalking seem less creepy somehow.  Eat your steak,” Tony instructed.  “I had them hold the wasabi pea puree. You’d have thought I’d asked them to include some chicken nuggets and a toy.  You ever get back there?”
“Why does he keep saying that then?” Fury asked brusquely, pounding in the code for the door.
Why had Steve even kept the damn thing?  He obviously hadn’t liked it, though, admittedly, it had been something of a joke, not that Tony had meant anything by it, not really.  Okay, he admitted to himself.  Okay, that wasn’t entirely true. Actually, it wasn’t even a little true, not really, not when you scratched off the surface and got down to the black center of it all.  Truth of it was, he
“They probably just didn’t believe someone with that many versions of ‘Like a Surgeon’ was capable of hacking their system,” Steve teased.
, the likes of Hydra’s cannons would shred those walls and your towers, and with so few men garrisoning them, General Rhodes is right, you’d never patch them up before you were overrun,” Steve explained.  “I was thinking, though…a star.  The wall, if it—if it were built more in the shape of a star…”
,” Anthony argued mildly.  “
him, just some fuzzy image that wouldn’t quite coalesce.  He shook his head to clear it, then turned back to face Jarvis, crossing his arms over his chest as he did.  “I mean.  Look around you.  I’ve got everything I could possibly want,” Tony finished in a flat, listless tone.
It was always too late.
before falling asleep.  Though, where exactly here was posed an entirely different concern, Steve thought as he glanced around nervously, trying to find anything that looked remotely familiar, but everything he could see was not only completely unknown to him, but, as far as he knew, completely unknown to anyone.
“St—Steve.  Please, God, just—“ Tony stammered, the pleas ending in a nonsensical smash of letters and sounds.  It made Steve’s head swim a little, like everything in his mind was sliding off to one side, the way Tony could come apart so easily.
“Sorry, sorry,” Zola stammered in the middle of heaves of air.  “Mistake.  Sorry. You, up!  Now.  Hurry.  Hurry, I said,” Zola hissed when Steve didn’t move.
“It’s fine,” Tony said quickly, waving his hand and taking another puff on the pipe as if to diffuse the situation. “Ul-Tarn, I assure you, I thought only to secure a vast area in the most expedient manner possible, not to undermine your authority. I would not want your soldiers stretched too thin, a concern I believe you raised when asking for more weapons?” Tony reminded the Ul, his voice pitched high in question. “But, enough of that. Besides, you have assured me that your rule of the wastes is absolute and you have no rivals that could possibly raise a challenge to you, so as I assume that is still the case,” Tony continued with a pointed look, “do not let these groundless worries plague your mind, dear friend. Once the Chitauri learn of the power of the Jerak’ho, you may find that a few of those will render whatever concerns we share about our enemies to the South to be moot. Now, come, let us enjoy the night and celebrate the long friendship between our peoples.”
need...well, that’s ah.  Okay. So, you, ah. You have to--to what?  Do that every so often or something?”
“All over the place,” Rhodey assured him.
“Did you go see him last night?” Brock demanded suddenly.  “Is that where you went when you ran out of here?”
The garden was quiet, though lamps still glowed from the corridors and walkways around it, probably because of the party, Steve assumed.  Miss Potts would not waste the oil otherwise.   He walked towards the fountain where it bubbled near the center and sank down on the narrow stone wall that encircled it.  His heartbeat and breathing slowly returned to normal.
“You would do that? Really?” Steve asked, the words came out more demanding and harsher than he meant them.
“Tony, I don’t know what to do. I don’t—” Steve started.
“Green berets.  And not
Steve frowned.  He wanted to argue with Tony. Tell him that he was wrong, explain how the people of the Free States were different. How they had all come from nothing on desperate wings, longing for something that barely had a name in this world. How they would never be like this place.  Something in Tony’s words niggled at the back of his mind, though, twisting through his gut like ice. He didn’t want Tony to be right, but he knew that wasn’t the same as Tony not being right.
“God, you have absolutely no chill,” Tony muttered through his teeth.
“I should’ve been there,” Tony replied stubbornly.  “I could’ve helped. Or.  I don’t know, but I should’ve been there.  With you.  Not a good time?  That’s when I should’ve been there the most.  You—Barnes said you came looking for me on 9/11.”
OMG, more fluffy porn.  What is my life?
Tony could see it so clearly, the two of them on the floor of what had been Steve’s crappy apartment at the time, before it became theirs for those few months when he’d believed everything was just beginning.  Hours spent furiously writing and re-writing code, while Steve taught the useless scrap-pile red versus orange over and over until the subroutine finally kicked in.
“I reviewed the footage, of course, and nothing was outside the boundaries of Room Six’s restrictions. I’ve confirmed with Room Six that we can delete the tape as per our usual course, as long as you are agreeable to that. We will, of course, refund your credits,” she told him, as if that was what Steve cared about.
It was a little after five in the evening by the time Happy dropped Tony off outside the building where Steve worked, and already dark enough for stars to be visible and headlights to form a chain of white dots, punctuated by insistent honking, up and down the street.  The temperature was dropping fast.  Tony’s lungs were already burning with the cold night air, and he could feel it seeping through the layers of clothing and settling over his skin.
“Table,” Tony said again, breaking the kiss long enough to look over at the bedside table. Right.  Concierge. Supplies.
He stared at it in his hand for a moment, then brought it to his nose and breathed in the now-familiar scent.  Cleans An Alpha Up Right, their ads proclaimed, usually with some Paul Bunyan-type sauntering through rocky mountain streams while vaguely Irish music played in the background.  Tony was fairly sure Coulson had brought it to the cabin on one of his supply runs while Steve was gone right after they Bonded, because Steve had asked him once in all seriousness if it was a joke and then seemed to not quite believe Tony when he said it was a real thing.
“Nat and I can get across the pond multiple times.
thinking about anymore.  He wiped a hand over his face.  Yeah.  That plan was going just
“JARVIS, can you get something nice sent over from Neiman’s for the bed? Something in red, but not too garish?  Eh, well, a little garish, it’s me.  I have to kill someone, or I’d do it, but talk to Bryce over there, he’s a champ,” Tony said, in what he thought was a perfectly clear tone, but JARVIS seemed to be having some trouble understanding him.
“God, yes.  I hate them,” Tony shot back with a grin.
“I have to,” Steve said quietly, his mouth pulling down into a grimace.  “Please, Buck.  Please.  You…you know what you mean to me.  Don’t be…Please,  I can’t do this without you.  I need you, always have…but I have to do this,” Steve pleaded.  Steve’s eyes searched Bucky’s for some acceptance, pleading with him to understand.  Bucky’s hands slid from his face, his body rigid with tension.
He had time.  There was no rush.  He could come or not.  It didn’t matter. He could do whatever he wanted.  Tony wasn’t even watching. No one was seeing him. It was just him.  There was no right or wrong thing to do, except that one thing, and that...didn’t seem as important as it had been moments ago.
“This is so cool,” Tony said, shaking his head with a resurgence of disbelief.  My Alpha’s
Steve wanted the company to be a success.  That was the whole point of all this, and if that was what Steve wanted, then, well, Tony would give it to him.  It was as simple as that.  In a way, it was calming, to have something he knew he could do for Steve, something that would make Steve happy.  I can take care of him, Tony thought.  Not the way he wanted to, but the way Steve wanted him to, and that was the point, wasn’t it?  Hadn’t Steve shown him that these past months?
“If you Braille his ass, it spells out ‘Hot Damn,’” Tony replied flatly.
“Have you priced housing in Brooklyn?” Steve laughed.  “It’s a little outside my pay grade at the moment.” Waiters arrived to deftly remove their plates and replace them with the second course, some kind of soft-boiled egg on a spinach puree with a cheese sauce.  It turned out to be delicious.
In retrospect, he could have been a bit more helpful instead of just assuming that there was a bright future at the end of their rainbow. He'd ranted and railed at the injustice of it all, cut back where he could. That had seemed painful, at the time, but now, he wondered how his tightening of the proverbial belt had really looked to Steve. Little rich boy, playing at being poor like it was one of those charity-vacations the well-meaning, well-off went on these days, going native for just long enough to feel better about himself, but never actually having to internalize any of what Steve dealt with. Easy to judge when everything is always easy, Tony could admit, at least now, if only because he wanted to, and what did that tell him?
“Leave him be,” Bucky said flatly.  He spared a look at Steve.  “This is a terrible idea.”
“You can help me,” Tony repeated slowly, oddly sure that was exactly what the whole Vulcan mind-meld thing had been trying to communicate.  “You can help me...with the palladium? With the whole poison thing, you can...fix that? You...you want to give me something. A gift. Medicine?” Tony guessed hopefully. “Some kind of weird alien medicine?” That didn’t sound right in his head, though he had no clue
Tony lifted his hips, canting them forward, then angling himself back until he felt the tip of Steve’s cock catch against the rim of his hole.  Tony drew in a breath.  A fresh rush of slick ran out of him.  Behind him, he heard Steve bite off a groan.  Hands gripped his hips, giving him purchase.  He slowly pushed back and down, feeling the burning stretch of muscle as Steve’s cock pressed into his hole.   It never seemed like it would work, that first part of the way, when Steve was barely inside of him.  It always seemed like it must be impossible, but then, his body twitched, gave way, and Tony was sliding down Steve’s cock, taking him in, sinking down until he was fully seated.
“Did you use a lance?” Cam asked Steve, face scrunching up in curiosity.
“Could use your help on the helicarrier design, too,” Fury continued, and damn if there wasn’t a smile the cagey bastard’s voice, Tony thought.  “Maybe you can suggest some improvements there.  Heard you got a good look at the engines.”
Steve knew about that, though.  He knew Obie had been selling weapons under the table, and he knew that those weapons had ended up in the hands of the Ten Rings at Gulmira.  He knew those weapons—Tony’s weapons—had probably killed some of his unit and had cost Barnes an arm and left both of them with a lifetime of recovery.  Hell, that was at least part of the reason why Steve had agreed to this insane scheme in the first place.
,” Tony spat out.
“Okay, fine, so I might have missed the invitation.  My bad,” Tony groused, holding his hands out in front of him in a placating gesture. “Not like I forgot to put the heart in the cooler.”
