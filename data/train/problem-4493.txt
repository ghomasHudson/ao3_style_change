The young maid looked down at their hands cautiously, accustomed to the way her Prince did not care for decorum when in his own chambers. Taking her hand out of his gently, she rubbed both her palms on her apron and curtsied “As you wish, my Prince. Please go ahead and light the fire whilst I prepare your bath. Would you like a masking herb blend today or plain soap?”
He all but started running to take another corner when he collided with a sturdy body, causing him to stumble like a pup that had not yet learned to walk. For a split second, he was afraid he might actually hit the ground but a strong and comforting arm caught him round the waist and steadied him with a hand on his shoulder.
Castiel takes the papers and clutches them in his hand, swallowing the growing lump in his throat. Everything about this man has managed to settle and unsettle every nerve in Castiel’s body, without much effort on his part except a well-timed smile and a devil-may-care attitude.
Castiel does not forget he is supposed to be here to form lasting relationships that will become beneficial to his country in some way, shape or form. No - the decision for such under the table, rude comments is entirely his own. His fury is palpable but it is not disabling his faculties - he knows exactly what he means with his words.
He heaves a heavy sigh once inside and gets to work immediately. It’s mindless work where your brain can wander whilst your body takes the brunt. Dior’s thoughts stray to Lisa and all the dangerous situations she might be in.
The prince’s eyes prick. Here he is, inadequate and unable to look after Dior, yet the man does not hesitate in giving him this moment. He has never been on the receiving end of an omega’s ‘scent blanket’, something only family and mates would do for one.
. They shook hands and the alpha promised to be in contact with Crowley tomorrow in order to book the required days. Dior heads inside with a smile on his face, a bunch of books under his arm, anxious but happy. And, of course, that would be when Crowley had to open his pie hole and ruin it for him.
He took in the way glistening frost took over the grass in the mornings when they departed, the way people seemed to greet each other left and right, something that would’ve been abhorrent back at home. He smiled at the easy affection parents seemed to shower their children with and thought of his father in passing, and how he'd like it here. He loved the way the language rolled off with ease off the locals’ tongues, nothing like the blocky pronunciation he heard from his peers back in England. It felt natural, languid and so impossibly
It was with that embarrassing thought Dior realised neither he or the alpha had said anything for a while. He could feel colour spreading up his neck, wavering under the intense stare of his alpha.
“I need to go,” he tells them and turns to the bubbling pail of water. He only barely manages to remember not to grab it with his bare hands and brings it over to the dumbwaiter, dumping it inside hastily.
Dior swallows again, somewhat easier this time, and lowers his voice before replying, “An omega wing, if you’ve got one,” he fires rapidly under his breath, “The door needs a lock. Food included - it has to be three meals a day. Preferably with a private bath but a shared lavatory would do fine. A comfortable enough bed - we’re willing to compromise on the decor as long as the mattress is not harsh on the muscles-” he continues, speaking quickly, clearly.
More than halfway through his allocated time, he had moved along to admire the statues. Where the paintings had evoked many questions regarding technique and ideas behind them, the statues seemed to speak to Castiel on a much more personal level. They were all mesmerising. He found it incredibly hard to move from one to the next. They did not feel like chunks of stone and marble to him. He felt they were more alive than he had been lately, their faces full of emotions, their bodies posed in such a way that he felt they might get up and start walking any second. He felt more and more breathless. Oh, how could he have ever gone forward in life not knowing such beauty exists? It was blasphemous to him. If their Heavenly Father had left these amazing gifts for them to create and admire, would it not be disrespectful to go a lifetime without properly appreciating everything the world has to offer?
He doesn’t look at her when he replies, keeping his head down and focusing on taking things out, “I’m not allowed to say,” he blurts out.
When he speaks next, it’s gentle, consoling, “I will tell you however many times you will want to hear it, Dior. Were it after me, I would be next to you as much or as little as you’ll have me.”
Chrissie steps closer and Dior wants to flinch, thinking back to how Cas had stepped closer to him last night. He doesn’t have the energy to. Neither is he able to tell Chrissie off when she takes a sniff off him.
He takes a seat next to one of the boys on the second floor, Aiden, throwing him a smile and getting one in return. The moment his ass hits the chair, the flurry of conversations starts around him again, coaxing a smile out of him. “You should have woken me up. I’m the cook in this household,” he scolds them good-naturedly.
“You heard the boy, Uriel. Are you planning on keeping us here all night?” One of the alphas snapped at a greying and balding man on Dior’s left.
Thank you so much for reading - I hope you liked this chapter!! There's fluff but there's also angst and we've got some more world-building which is always my favourite thing. I'd love to hear what your favourite part was *puppy eyes*
They sit in silence together, Dior’s brain working overtime trying to find a way to help her, to ensure Lisa doesn’t have to go through either of those options. But
Sam rolled his eyes. “Right. Sorry. I forgot we’re the only ones using these things and not our phones like, you know, normal people.”
"Quite. I am looking forward to seeing France with my own two eyes. You have done a good job of raising expectations. I do hope you're ready to face them, now." Castiel teased.
Castiel pondered this for a second and then the doors were opening for his floor. “I’ll think about it. See you later Charlie,” he said and gave the petite woman a weak wave.
It is a new feeling; both scary and exhilarating. It feels like he could both die or grow into something different. The short, wispy roots in-between his ribs elongate and wrap around each vertebra further, fracturing bone and imprinting themselves forever.
Castiel looks at him, exasperated, “How is this ludicrous? It is simply a matter of logic: the weather is polar and you are wearing barely anything-”
“Hey there! Can I help?” the man - Sam, his tag said - greeted. He had his hair up in a bun, dandelio-yellow apron stained with green, and a kind smile on his face.
“Uhm, if you’d like to help, would you mind getting his bottle ready? He doesn’t do well with strangers.” he finally says, rubbing soothing circles onto the baby’s back. “It’s not hard, you just need to get the bottle and put it in the bottle warmer - it’ll only take a couple of minutes.”
. He needed to because if he smelled half scent bonded no alpha would touch him, and they paid best and if he didn’t get enough centimes then there’s no way he’d be able to help Lisa.
be associated with him. But he’d tried. He’d tried his best to wake up for her sake, and even though he’s groggily making his way through the days, there are no more tears on his behalf and that- that’s all he can bring himself to ask for.
Castiel can feel himself getting agitated at the words, his scent cloying into something musty. Balthazar and Princess Margot must have noticed this, since he is seated in-between the two. Balt discreetly touches his elbow and Meg shifts herself from facing them to facing the Russian alpha in a touching moment of solidarity. He inhales cherry wine and firewood, willing himself to relax.
If one were to say that contentment is very much different from happiness, Dior would have been hard-pressed to believe them. Surely, if someone was content that meant their life was good and satisfying enough for it to be counted as happy. After all, life is made up of shitty and less shitty things.
“Started snowing, did it?” Castiel thinks he hears Sam talking, but he can’t be sure. He’s still staring at the apparition.
And so he sits outside the room, head a mess, wondering where the conversation had gone wrong - why the man had reacted so. Was it the present? Was it Castiel’s inability to flirt back? It would not be the first time his inadequacy would cause discomfort to the people in his vicinity. He turns every possibility every which way in his head - but is unable to come to a conclusion. Each one seems just as likely to be the cause as not.
So, of course, he doesn’t come up to bring reminders. On any other day, it wouldn’t matter. Dior is at least competent enough to keep track of important information.
scone. There were crumbs falling on his vest, his mother’s long fingers brushing them away, amusement dancing on her lips, hair in a perfect, complex plait, no strand out of place.
Both alphas and omegas are capable of scent blanketing/marking, betas are unable to since they do not possess scent glands, but are able of BEING scent blanketed/marked superficially through their skin (lasts barely any time at all). Omegas scent marking anyone but their children is seen as ‘not knowing their place’ and can have repercussions. However, having an omega scent blanket you is perceived as proof of someone’s ‘prowess in subduing an omega’.
“Right?” Adrien chips in, getting up and starting stacking plates. “We’re talking about the guy who refuses to buy extra soap.”
He started gently rocking the crying baby, humming his favourite nursery rhyme in a low voice and cradling his face into his neck, hoping the vibrations would soothe him. It took a few minutes for Jack to go from eardrum-bursting shrieks to sniffles and sobs but they got there. It was better than nothing.

“I’m sorry,” Lisa starts, looking down and shaking her head, tightening her palms into balls on his bare chest.
Dior’s head spins and spins when he slides down to the floor, not even bothering to stand up. He crawls on his hands and knees over to Princess Abbadon, then sits down on his ass, legs bunched next to him. He looks up at her through his eyelashes, hyper-aware of the beads of sweat traveling down his spine. Her Highness hates him sweaty.
“Nah, man. Don’t worry about it. Babies are a lot of work. Take your time, we’re not far off.” Dean says, good-naturedly, now standing across from Castiel on the other side of the stroller. “It’s kinda dark now, do you want me to hold him?”
, Dior. Thank you for taking care of the bath for us again. You are too sweet for your own good,” Lisa says.
Everyone around them agrees hastily, throwing affirmative words or nods. Dior laughs. “Well, aren’t you all a group of charmers?”
“Don’t be so hasty, Cassie, look,” Balt says, pointing at what appears to be a random bench further down the path.
That evening is so clear in his mind, and he’s reliving it again and again whenever his thoughts wander - which is every free waking moment. He can smell the Prince, can hear the little breaths he gave whenever Dior said something amusing, can see the smooth skin next to his eyes and forehead move and glow in the firelight.
He takes a leap of faith and turns his whole body inwards, coming chest to chest with Cas, his thumbs immediately sliding down to his wrists, under his gloves and pressing, pressing,
The journey from Calais to the Palace of Versaille took the best of five days. They couldn’t travel after dark, so their journeying hours had to start late in the morning and finish early in the afternoon at this time of the year. Castiel did not mind whatsoever. It gave him many opportunities to enjoy the French countryside and to try and commit to memory as many details as he could.
And so, Dior eats two pieces, closes up the box, then hides it between two of his thinnest nightshirts in the wardrobe, placing the garments next to the corner that has a hole in it and allows the draft from the window to invade the enclosed space. It’s a far cry from an icebox, but Dior is finally thankful for that crack when only yesterday he was cursing his clothes being frigid in the mornings.
The moment they reached the bottom of the stairs, they were offered a drink from one of the waiters, and Castiel couldn’t help but notice a peculiar detail. “I can’t smell them,” he said and continued making their way further down the room.
Dean’s cheeks get pink quite quickly - so not because of the cold - but before he can reply, the warmer dings. Castiel takes the bottle, quickly checking the temperature at the back of his wrist, and rearranges Jack in his arms so he can feed comfortably.
= the gland where scent pheromones are created; most potent ‘scent point’ of the body; located on the neck at the same level as the mating gland but towards the front, rather than the back; betas do not possess this.
“If I knew you were so sneaky, we could’ve had a lot of fun,” he tells her, hoping to ease the tension.
“Does this suit your tastes, your Highness? I have chosen a matching, single-breasted navy waistcoat and trousers, paired with a white dress shirt. Brown and navy oxfords and a navy, narrow cravat. I have not chosen a frock as I am aware you are impartial to your beige coat.” Alfie informed him, carefully setting down some suspenders and a pair of gloves.
Dior wanted to growl at the derogatory term used but he knew better than to be so stupid. The last time he’d dared correct one of them he’d ended up with bleeding ass cheeks. Instead, he kept his playful smile. “Now, now. No need to get heated. Keep that for the bedroom gentlemen.” he teased, receiving some darkening looks in response. “
“Then it’s time you hired an assistant. And a housekeeper to cook breakfast and do laundry. We can take care of everything else,” Dior said, putting his feet on top of Crowley’s lap, pulling a holier-than-thou expression. “
But now he’s somehow managed to fuck up so monumentally that he is faced with the last person in this God-forsaken world he ever wanted to see him like this.
Telling Lisa all of this isn’t going to do anything but bring her more grief. He stops his pacing and closes his eyes, hands finding their way behind his neck and squeezing. There has to be something - anything - he can do. Dior knows he’s useless, that there’s nothing he’s particularly good at, he’s got no money,
“That’s wonderful, darling. We are ever so happy. Maybe your brother, Gabriel, will be happy to accompany you to the grounds today and you can enjoy riding your mare for a while.” Queen Naomi, their mother, chipped in, sounding genuinely delighted. “If his servants will ever find that troublesome boy.” she added, shaking her head wistfully.
When he believes himself adequately scrubbed, he gets out but doesn’t get to emptying his tub immediately, looking through his drawers for his razor and shaving cream, not bothering to cover himself, water trailing behind him and pooling at his feet.
Dean chuckles, although Castiel isn’t sure what’s so entertaining. “Alright. Do you want them to grow anything? Like cones or berries?”
He lets his eyes roam from the sky, to the snow, the winter blossoms and a servant jogging across the courtyard, “I am but a client to him right now - which is… fine - exceptional, even,” the prince bites out and closes his eyes, turning his face to the mild sun.
And so Dior helped the young Prince maneuver his way through his first game, explaining rules as they went. He looked very serious throughout the round, taking in everything Dior said as if he was spouting poetry and not facts. Something he had learned about the alpha was that he was as straightforward as they came and did not cower from speaking his mind, tact and all. An admiring trait in this two-faced world where everything had an innuendo.
“An appointment would ensure that I am otherwise not… preoccupied.” Dior informed him, grimacing. “I reside at
Balt only makes a ‘hmm’ sound, oddly subdued. Castiel does not enquire further, enjoying this small moment of tranquility in the mesmerising garden of the Palace of Versailles. He spots two more magpies, hiding from sight between some bigger branches.
“I am willing to become a funny, local myth if it helps Caesar,” he says. Jesse’s smile is soft and gentle whenever his husband’s name passes his lips. Cas wonders if Jesse knows that.
A couple approached him sheepishly and asked if he needed assistance. Apparently, Castiel had been staring at that particular statue for the better part of twenty minutes and they had grown concerned. He assured the two women he was alright, just entranced. They explained that they were on their honeymoon, the three of them falling in easy conversation.
Because Dior can’t be responsible for grabbing him with filthy hands, staining him, causing him to fall.
Neither of them speaks again, awkward, heavy silence settling between them - a stark contrast to the companionable one they shared earlier in the night. The comfort inside the carriage seems like ages ago.
, see him sneak back into his room to find Lisa awake, hiding under his covers. The shadows twist and bend and suddenly they resemble him in a different sort of way - he feels like the shadow.
,” Caesar replies, looking pleased with his sale. He proceeds to take a third piece of paper and envelope from Jesse, this time giving them to Dior. “These are care instructions, along with a recommendation for a dry-cleaner.”
Blood rushes from the prince’s face. He hurries after his friend and hopes nobody is eavesdropping on their conversation. The smell of snow is very potent and cleans out everything else, including the scent of any bypassers. Funnily enough, that alone helps to keep his head on his shoulders and not lose his temper.
“Nonsense. You must realise your manners are impeccable, Dior. And without proper lessons, too. Quite the feat. I am impressed and you should be confident,” Cain said. “However, if it makes you feel better, I can have you visit me a few days this coming week for some lessons.”
First of all,  I would like to thank each and every one of you for your comments and kudos - they've been the highlight of my days. Thank you for taking a chance with this fic and giving it a read!
King Azazel talked of his many concubines and of his dreams of having as many alpha children as possible, to assure that his bloodline remained on the throne. He did not wish to take another wife. Castiel kept quiet through most of that topic as he was not knowledgeable about how legitimacy worked in France. By God’s grace, Balthazar was well-informed where he wasn’t, not allowing a stall in conversation or silence to permeate the room.
“I’ll inform Caesar of your arrival and I’ll be back shortly with some refreshments. Tea, coffee?” Jesse asks.
painful. She grabs him by the bicep, nails scratching right over a blister, not quite opening it, but it causes a cry to die at the back of Dior’s throat.
Dior laughs but doesn’t reply to that. Instead, once naked, he sits on the table on his back at first, extremely familiar with the whole process. He’s also hoping to hurry this along quickly and that, by the time he comes out, Lisa will be waiting for her turn as she has done every Monday he has known her for.
Caesar laughs - a very jolly sound - and switches back to French, “Your pronunciation is very good.”
He thinks of how cold and alone the omega must have been on the streets after he had been abandoned by yet another group of people - and what a dastardly thing to do! Especially by an institution that thrives on the tax and benevolence of the people - and especially to a
He didn’t mean to sound so fucking desperate, despite actually being more than fucking desperate. He can’t leave Lisa stranded, can’t let her succumb to the same fate so many others before her have. He will protect her and her pup even if it costs him his life, as little value as it has.
it should hurt more. Dior should be in a shit load of pain right now, instead of this paltry stinging sensation but even this - even
“Smell who, Your Highness?” Balt asked, using his proper title, as was the usual in a public setting.
It is at that moment that the betas return and Caesar hands over two pieces of paper to Castiel, “The first one is a receipt of purchase and the second one is a ownership contract. Feel free to read it over before signing since you’ve never come across one before.”
Okay. This is fine. His nose is just blocked, right? This cold is wreaking havoc and he’ll be back to normal by tomorrow. His mind is whirring, the disarming feeling of being unable to discern his surroundings through his nose along with the rest of his sense disconcerting. Is this how betas live? Dior can’t imagine going through this sensation every single day, he feels like someone’s cut off a limb.
Cain sighed and tore his gaze away, taking a big sip of alcohol. “Indeed. It appears high-end courtesans or escorts are a must at social gatherings nowadays. Apparently, not hiring one to lead the gaiety of the private parlour is a faux-pas and I cannot afford anything less than perfection for this.” The man seemed very troubled for asking this of Dior. His respect for him grew impossibly more.
Once at the bottom of the stairs, he quickly ducks behind and tries the window - open. Lisa must have forgotten to put the latch back in place, a somewhat uneasy thought when he imagines any random person could have sneaked in.
“That’s… that’s a lot of variety. I’m afraid I have no clue.” Castiel admits, stopping when Dean does and facing the taller man.
“The nursery can only be accessed through the shop, so you’re in the right place. Let me ring Dean up and he’ll come to get ya.” Sam replied, taking out a two-way radio as Castiel thanked him. “There’s someone here to see the nursery, let me know how long you’ll be.”
Before he knows what he is doing, Castiel tears open the door of the still-moving carriage and starts a sprint down the road, back to where figures were starting to become shadows once again. His inner wolf is unbearable - the howling and destruction he is unleashing is almost enough to bring the prince to his knees once his feet hit gravel.
. What, did God decide he’d had enough of ugly humans and poured a few hundred years worth of beauty into this one man? High cheekbones that rolled into a perfectly sculpted jaw, chin that dipped in the middle ever so slightly - it looked like the perfect spot to pepper with kisses. Thick, pink lips perched atop the chin, sculpted to perfection as if to mock everyone else’s of their inadequacy. The alpha’s eyes were nothing short of terrifying. Dior shivered when he let himself sink into those depths. He’d seen his fair share of bright, almost icy blue eyes. But these? These radiated warmth and still managed to look the exact shade of blue you’d find at the bottom of a clear lake on a cloudy, early morning. With a rising heat in his gut, Dior wondered what they’d look like when the alpha climaxed, whether they’d brighten up or darken and whether he’d be allowed to watch them when it happened.
Uriel. I hope you will join another game of poker with me tonight.”, he quickly greeted the third alpha, nodding his head back to the cards table, an inviting smile on his lips.
Getting closer and closer to the exit, an absolutely horrid weight settled at the bottom of his stomach. He could feel his eyes burn and sweat form under his beret, making his hair stick to his forehead.
“A few - anything more specific you’re looking for?” the beta asks, and had Dior not been well versed in body language, he’d have missed the encouraging twinkle in her eyes.
“You honour me, Your Highness. It would do me great pleasure to join you,” Castiel replied, giving her his most charming smile. Or at least, he thought it was.
Dior was the best earning prostitute so he was given a modest but well furnished studio on the last floor with his own personal water closet and tub. No running bath water, but at least they had working plumbing for the toilets and did not have to resort to chamber pots like half of France. His room had a comfortable four-poster double bed, a good sized sofa and coffee table in front of a rather large, round window overviewing the busy streets. He had a desk, a fireplace, good rugs that didn’t feel scratchy on his knees whenever his clients were feeling particularly feral. On his floor it was just him and Ruby, the second highest earning of the omegas.
The omega watches Castiel’s pupils glow in the light. First, a shivering red. Second, a pumping orange. Third, a crescendoing white. Only to come full circle to intense blue.
What the fuck does Castiel think he’s doing? Has he lost his mind? Why is he putting on this- this obedient act for Dior? Who is Dior for the alpha to show such intimate behaviour, as if they’re equals?
It lasts a second before they unclasp ever so slightly and the prince can feel a thumb rubbing back and forth, up and down his inner wrist. The honeyed pecans come back tenfold.
thing to do here, Cas,” he says, affronted. “It’s proper omega etiquette to wait for the alpha to order. You know that, being a prince and all.”
The prince feels a small surge of defensiveness for the flower, and is quick to correct this misunderstanding, “Absolutely not,” he says. “They might appear plain at first, being so small and of such simple form - but have you noticed they are whiter than snow, carry the smell of hope and - despite being so delicate, they possess true strength? Strong enough to often be the first to poke their petals through after a harsh winter and harsher snowstorms? They are the furthest thing from bad luck.”
“She would let me climb under the covers and allow me to burrow into her bosom for a few minutes - parental affection is not given freely in the eye of the public, you see,” he goes on, not giving a rest to his ministrations upon the foliage. “She smells like roasted coffee beans and myrrh - which are not the most enticing of smells for a six year old,” an amused huff escapes him. “But she smelled like my
Dior bobs his head in understanding, a small frown occupying his face, “That must be very stressful.”
Dior hesitates in the doorway. Will what he’s got in the bag be enough? He does some quick math in his head, and he
The princess raised a finger to his cheekbone, her perfectly manicured red nail lightly digging into his skin as she dragged it down to his jaw and then chin. “Yes, I can imagine he is simply scrumptious.” she purred, giving him a salacious sneer and grabbing his face in her hand, raising his head as if to inspect a piece of meat at the butchers.
Castiel is unfazed, gaze transfixed onto the glittering orbs of fir-green, not for the first time wondering how people have traveled long and far in search of wonders of the earth, when there are two whole worlds floating inside those eyes, windows to the most radiant of souls.
Dior seems at odds with what to say, but his chance is stolen by Jesse announcing his return to the room with a cough and carrying a tray of nibbles and drinks, another man behind him.
There is a lot of symbolism scattered around this chapter - I offer brownie/any-other-snack-you-like points to anyone able to tell me what some (if not all!) are <3
“I assure you it’s fine. I’m - I’m a single dad,” he says, voice trembling. “No partner at home to berate me for beautiful men flirting with me.”
The beta throws him a look that would be insulting had Castiel not been riding on euphoria, “Of course, sir. Your appointment ends at ten-thirty. As you are the omega’s last appointment of the day, feel free to keep him until eleven - subject to paying half an hour’s rate,” he tells Castiel.
Cas forms tight fists at his side, his arms shaking minutely. Sour honey and burning paper itch Dior’s nose and he wonders if telling him all of this is wise. But he dismisses that thought because the more the prince gets to know, the more he’ll want to stay away.
Dior ponders his answer before finally replying, “We’re not allowed to keep presents from our clients.” resignation resonates both in his voice and scent. Castiel is getting quite fed up with how it contorts it into staleness.
?” he asks, accentuating the last words with a quick look to the stupefied alphas around the rectangular piece of wood that suddenly feels less like a table and more like a torture device.
life, just like art had been hers. He spoke of her as if she was a piece of art herself, a perfect creation of God, even her faults beautiful beyond reproach.
“Very well. And afterwards, we will be dining for lunch in a town restaurant, if you’re agreeable,” Cain said. At this point, Dior would be willing to do anything the alpha wanted. Today was going to be one he’d remember for the rest of his life, he knew.
Sitting there, all he could do was try to relax and enjoy the cinnamon that seemed to cling to his suit.
Next, it was Alastair that got up “Thank you for the game, Your Highness. Shall we head over to the billiards table now? Omega, come.” he commanded, all alpha authority. Dior didn’t even think about it as his body headed for the man.
The beta throws him a weird look that Cas cannot interpret before asking them to take a seat. The alpha takes the blanket off the omega’s shoulders and keeps hold of his hand as he takes a seat. Cas makes sure to replace the blanket over his knees immediately.
Castiel backs away instinctually, hoping to appear less threatening when he asks, “What do you mean?”
, but has only ever bought him for his time and not his body. The first few times it happened, he had been apprehensive because - not to blow his own horn - he was not a cheap prostitute, being the most sought after omega at his establishment, and nobody spends that amount of money to just
Balt’s eyes turn stormy again, the earlier softness gone in an instant. He throws his arms up in a rapid motion and stalks angrily away from Castiel, “There are no bloody failings! You can’t get your cock up for every omega that prances around you. What the
A hand lands on his shoulder and the prince stops walking. He turns around and is greeted by his friend’s unusually somber face.
Outside, there is an elegant, grey landau carriage waiting for them. Once the alpha had been reassured an appropriate (or mayhaps excessive) amount of time by Balt that nobody would pay him any heed - he had gone and rented a carriage and coachman for the next month. It was paid out of his own fortune and not put down as public expense on the receipts the Queen’s accountant would receive for this trip.
He starts shrieking when the thunder-clap pain hits. Blurry shapes turn black and then to colours and then it feels like he’s looking through the thickest, most textured glass he’s ever come across.
They pass many bars and the prince has a private laugh to himself whenever groups of elder gentlemen or younger lasses come out holding onto each other and singing dubiously pitched songs, giggling like children or, in the case of a couple of them, even sobbing.
“You are in luck then, my Lord. I was on the way back there myself. Would you care to accompany me?” the omega asked, nibbling on his bottom lip and an endearing flush appearing onto his cheeks, freckles now in full bloom.
“I can see that. Your instructions were very clear and easy to understand.” The Prince smiled, a soft gesture, which forced a similar one from Dior himself. “I am afraid I do not attend enough social events back home to have needed this knowledge.”
The only times he had been able to determine someone’s emotions through scent alone was whenever a family member was feeling something in a powerful way.
Dean laughs earnestly and wonderfully and Castiel wishes he’d do it again. “Man, I think you need new friends - and to never stop doing those air quotes. That’s adorable.”
There’s a gagging noise coming from someone who sounds suspiciously like Chrissie, followed by a sharp slapping noise and a hiss. Dior chuckles with his mouth full but doesn’t look towards the culprits.
?” he’d asked, doing his damned best not to let the alpha’s smell overwhelm his senses, though that also proved pointless. Even breathing through his mouth did nothing to help.
!” was all she said before taking a sharp turn around a corner. It was not long before they came to a heavy and intricately decorated, wooden door. It was already open so they walked straight in, Balthazar come over immediately.
A couple of lampposts away, the lone figure under the flickering light is not so alone. It is dark and they are far away at first so the prince is only able to separate three different people; two men and a woman.
The omega raises himself carefully off the pillow in order to sit up in bed, causing the thick, down blanket to pool at his waist. The fire roaring in the room is big enough that the difference in temperature between the room and under the blanket is negligible.
His mate tries to continue peeling the robe off his back but Dior cries out in agony, fat tears rolling on the hills of his cheeks, “No, no! Stop, stop, I can’t-”
and as he bathed. When in bed, surrounded by his blanket and listening to the crackling of his fireplace, he thought about how it was all probably a dream and he had finally gone mad.
When the water starts to heat up, steam rising out steadily, he carefully braces his hands on the wall in front of him and ducks his whole face above the steam. One of the books
To his benefit, the alpha doesn’t bat an eyelid when he turns down the hallway and yells back for them, “I’ll go. You - all of you - get a move on. The physician charges hourly
and you think you get claiming rights?” his whole body starts shaking from head to toe. “You buy me one fucking outfit-”
“No, no! I don’t need rest. I am perfectly fine,” he insists, finding his dressing gown and putting his arms through the sleeves. “I can work, Crowley, and I don’t need any drugs.”
He helps her out of the tub, takes his own robe off, and slips Lisa’s arm through the sleeves. At her quizzical look, he tells her “To cover your scent with mine as much as possible,” and leaves it at that. He sits her on the bed and runs back downstairs to her room, returning the items he took earlier.
Dior closes his eyes and remembers the Prince - remembers Castiel. He remembers how the alpha’s eyes were wide and nervous, how his hands gave a barely-there shake when he took the box out of his inner pocket. He thinks of how the Prince seemed worried about making a mistake toward Dior.
He does not give Dior the chance to ask what he means, simply striding back into the omega’s personal space and seamlessly slipping his arm around Dior’s, a perfect mirror of how the man had been holding on to him the whole evening.
“Apologies for the wait,” he says instead, climbing into the carriage and closing the door quickly, not wishing to let too much cold air in.
Princess Abbadon did not deign him with a reply, just a nod of acknowledgment. Instead, she turned her head towards Castiel and addressed him directly, “Prince Castiel, would you give me a minute of your time?”
, Balt. You are conscious of my disposition. To answer your question, yes, my mating cycle is due to start during our stay. However, as you are already in the know," he peered at his friend without turning his head, an expression on his face that pleaded the conversation be dropped, "I have my own preference of treatment."
Jesse gives a bobbing nod and rotates the teacup in his hands, “We started courting when we were sixteen and got married as soon as we were both of age. “
Castiel took the leaflet and shoved it into his bag without looking at it. “Thank you. I’ll see you at three.” he leaned down to Jack who was still sniffling and pressed small kisses all over his face, earning him a disgruntled sound. “I love you. Be a good boy, Jack.”
It feels like sand slipping through his fingers despite trying his best to keep all of it in the palm of his hands - the more he tries, the more gaps appear and less sand there is to hold onto.
Once his stomach seems appeased, Dior pushes it away from him and attempts to stand up. Two different hands grab an arm each and assist him.
The omega whips his head around immediately, heart hammering in his chest, wide eyes staring at the shape in front of his door - Lisa. His body is close to sagging in relief at seeing her in his vicinity, but when he takes a closer look, the relief flies out of the window.
But there’s no time for him to be distracted - Lisa’s ready now. And so he watches himself wash his hand off immediately, not sparing a second glance to the water once his hands run clean. He watches himself instruct Lisa on what to do.
This was bad. It was fucking bad. If the alpha caught a whiff of his arousal, this could mean very big problems for him. He needed to calm down - and
Exhaustion turns into short-lived adrenaline that carries his legs around a corner he deems far enough. The moment they get hidden by the shadows, the omega throws his back against the wall, breathing rapidly and eyesight going hazy.
he’d told Dior. Somehow, this meant that he took a particular liking to the omega and Dior wouldn’t complain. It let him get away with a lot.
The betas exchange glances before both of their attention falls back onto the couple in front of them. Neither Dior nor Cas is concerned with the silent conversation the two are having.
Castiel chuckled and draped the still-screaming Jack over his shoulder, still rocking him. “Your brother might have implied you aren’t a big fan of technology.”
“You need to go,” he hears the beta man say. “I’m not going to be able to keep her back any longer.”
The scent blooms and Dior’s purring intensifies before dying out slowly until it is quiet. He stirs and straightens himself with an elegance someone woken up from deep slumber should not be capable of - something Castiel knows he would never be able to achieve.
Saturday found Castiel excited about being out of the house with Jack for Christmas shopping. The feeling which persevered all throughout the morning, getting the baby up and ready.
Once home, it was time for their usual dance of nap-food-play-bath-sleepy time. Some days it went swimmingly, others - Castiel had to pray for either patience, energy, or will to live. Sometimes all of them at once.
But Dior can’t allow him to speak further. Not if he has to hear anything that could break him. He can’t afford to be any more broken right now. He’s got things to do, responsibilities to fulfill. He can’t let Castiel - the fucking Third Alpha Prince of England - voice the inevitable.
The omega shuffles on the sofa uncertainly before he answers, more a question than a reply, “Coffee, please, and thank you,
The last time he had felt that, his mother had boldly told him to live quietly, follow her orders and not make a fuss - that he is broken now and broken things must be kept in check so they do not shatter to pieces.
“I n-need it to stop,” he repeats, burrowing his nose straight into Cas’ neck, searching for his alpha’s scent gland. The omega finds it easily, calling to him like a siren.
Castiel smiled. To everyone that bothered to ask, he’d told them Jack was his son and not his nephew. Maybe it was the cowardly thing to do, but it was better to have them assume he was a single dad rather than having them awkwardly shuffle off after being offered the truth.
Castiel takes a proper look around him and finds that the land is not unlike a Scandinavian forest - with shorter trees. He can’t help being impressed. He tells Dean as much and Dean beams once more, obviously unconcerned with what it does to Castiel’s cardiac rhythm.
Castiel’s heart constricts painfully. He had wanted to get to know Dior more, had craved to know Dior might feel the same about him. He had, somewhere deep in his conscience, thought that they might one day bask in honeyed pecans often. Now, it feels like he has been given every piece of information he was looking for, increased a thousandfold, blinding him. Opening his eyes. Overjoying him. Ruining him.
. Even heaven would probably crack up at him for wishing he could at least spend his afterlife together with him. Dior had felt desperation and sadness many times in his short, miserable life. But nothing could have ever prepared him for this sense of loss. He never had anything worth losing so he couldn’t have known.
Dior gave a small shrug. “The omegas at the house aren’t very interested in education. They don't see the point of it and tend to focus a lot on the now rather than later; which I cannot fault them for,” he explained.
Castiel watched him and listened to his own heart give out. He loathed everyone in this room, at this very minute. They dared touch Heaven’s gift to Earth in a frivolous manner and not revere in every brush of Dior’s skin against their filthy bodies. His instincts told him to rip every single one of them apart, seize his omega and hide him in the safety of his own quarters, protecting him from every wicked grope.
“As long as you like odd, I do not mind the label,” he tells him. “Every human is different, Dior. There are no two people that are the same on this Earth. They might resemble each other - but they will never be the other.
He wrote down the address, turned the laptop off, and got ready for some shut-eye before Jack woke up for his bottle in a few hours.
And talk they do. When Castiel asks why Dior chose this particular place, the omega tells him he has never been, although he always wanted to. The prince is ecstatic to learn that Dior adores history and is extremely knowledgeable in regards to historical architecture. The prince sits and listens to the man marvel about how Napoleon Bonaparte was so eager to showcase France’s might with the quadriga taken from Venice - only for it to be returned to Austria and replaced with a new one after his downfall.
“Whichever way you prefer, Your Highness. As I was saying, specify the day you’d like to see me and then my bawd will reply with the available times.”
Thankfully, that did not happen. Balthazar had been enraged, reprimanding him for his recklessness and demanding to know what had happened. He was reluctant to tell his friend what had made him act so rashly. Yet, he also desperately wanted someone to tell him he hadn’t gone crazy and that his reaction had been completely natural.
“That - that’s the most ludricrous t-thing I h-have ever heard,” he says, no longer attempting to take off any of the garments or to put distance between them.
Dior opens the single door which creaks loudly on its hinges, in dire need of some oil. The sound disturbs the mild atmosphere only slightly, the patrons littered around the ground floor paying him the briefest of attention before returning to their task.
The beta twists and bends all of his joints, asking if there’s any pain or difference in flexibility. The answer is no. She looks between his toes and this time asks if there has been any flaking skin, itchiness, or redness. Also no.
Dr. Sunders talks him through it. Her voice a weird, lukewarm balm to the iciness he always feels creeping up during the internal checkups.
Maybe it’s the lingering, full scent of the lavender wafting in the room from the still-hot water, maybe it’s the fact that Dior’s distracted and annoyed, but he doesn’t realise there’s someone in his room until they speak out.
With the alpha in his arms as pliant as he’ll ever be in this situation - which isn’t much to begin with - he takes a chance by grabbing Cas’ wrist with all the force he can muster, turns them on their heels, and runs.
Castiel took an amused look at his friend's face and gave him a small, encouraging smile. Yes, if he would have his way, that was how he intended to come back. Lighter in soul and soft-footed, ready to tackle responsibilities that came with being Third Alpha Price of England.
, it is already midnight and all lights appear to be out. Even Dior’s impressive, round window remains darkened by the night. He makes a swift exit and wastes no time in sliding the document inside the box, hurrying back to the carriage. It is carnage outside and he is infinitely happier now about their purchases today.
Lisa nods again, understanding and gratitude leaking into her beautiful features, this time less tense, and begins to unbutton her dress, slips out of her shoes. Dior smiles, happy that he hadn’t skipped his nightly bath yesterday, which meant this tub of water should be mostly clean but still carrying his smell potently.
Dior opens his eyes, lowers his legs sideways and grabs the box in both of his palms once again. He’s been doing this every morning before clients and every night after. It was a ritual of sorts, maybe. To reassure himself that it did happen, maybe.
Alfie made his way to the bath and offered Castiel a very low bow, with an arm tightly clasped behind his back. He stopped the unsavory urge to roll his eyes at his footman. Surely, he should know by now decorum is to be ignored in his chambers?
Dior startles when the beta slides right next to him and starts shouting, “Come get your toiletries, people! Scented oils and powder so fine it could be snow! Pretty satin drawers in fashionable colours! All for a good price!”
This train of thought is close to being obliterated when the prince starts catching whiffs of immense nervousness. However, there is also a heavy feeling of expectation mixed in and - to his absolute delight - awe.
“Yes, a good amount,” the beta replies, drinking from his cup and raising both of his eyebrows at the prince.
Crowley looked at his diary, “You’re off to Monsieur Cain for most of the day. Starting at nine this morning and you’re due back by four this afternoon. You then have a full evening of bookings so make sure you’re back in plenty of time.”
“He was the one to undo your corset, just so you are aware,” he explains in one breath, turning his eyes away from the omega. “It was ever so tight and you were not breathing properly. He left some burning lavender oil, hoping it will aid the aching and keep you resting for longer.”
Dior whines ever so slightly when he recalls the way Cas smelled - burning whiskey and raging fire. Were he not so damn tired, he swears he probably would’ve started to harden then and there, causing even more problems.
“It’s fucking winter, Lisa. You’ll freeze to death if starvation doesn’t kill you first,” he tells her and feels like shit when she starts sobbing in earnest now. But he can’t stop - he needs her to understand what she’s planning on doing, how crazy it is, how it’s not going to work. “You won’t have access to any scent neutralisers, everyone you pass will know you’re an omega. What do you think happens when a psychopath catches you have nowhere to go? You’ll most probably-” Dior stops.
Cas surprises him by dropping to his knees and tangling his hand with his. Dior scoots closer to the edge without meaning to, as if the alpha’s body is a beacon to be answered. The small contact sends shivers down his spine and he can almost feel the surge of contentment building.
, was not it. He had been in plenty of expensive mansions, yet none could even come close to the magnificence of the Louvre. It was pretty overwhelming if he was honest. Everything was full of history and brilliance. Even with his limited knowledge, he could name some of the paintings, their artists, and the year of creation. Cain seemed impressed with his insight and he couldn’t help but feel a bit proud.
“In another five days’ time?” The omega asks, a small, dry swallowing sound reverberating inside the four walls.
“So what are you proposing here, exactly, Alexandrov?” Christoph, the Austrian alpha, asks, a touch sharp.
“Where are you going to go, Lis? You don’t have any money and no one is going to suddenly grow a heart, offering an unspoken for omega a job.
No - if Crowley sees him like this he’ll cancel all of his appointments and that’ll do the worst damage to Dior’s earnings. He’d rather descend into literal hell.
“You are,” he reiterates. “You are the most wonderful person I have ever met - of any gender, status or age. You are so special, Dior.”
Dior watches her move back behind her own table. He looks down at his feet, takes a deep breath, and starts yelling.
Dior laughed. “You guys will find that people have all sorts of fetishes. They might even ask you to let them lick your
Castiel straightens his back, adjusts his coat - not his usual one so he does feel a bit naked - and his beret then starts making his way to the entry queue. His hands shook slightly as he handed over the entry fee to the guard. The inside took his breath away immediately. If he had thought the outside was beautiful, it was nothing compared to the inside. And it was all Castiel’s to explore on his own for the next few hours.
the alpha next to him to smell him. He wanted to see his eyes blow up in need and hear his breathing turn ragged. Dior wanted to see his composure crumble, whether that was on top of him or with the omega between his murderous thighs. Wouldn’t that just be bliss? If he wasn’t leaking slick already, Dior knew he would be now. The thought put a smile on his face and a quake in his legs.
The woman speaks again once Dior can no longer hear his lungs trying to oxygenate, “Very good. Now you can tell me.”
,” he says, sitting forward in his seat, arms rested along the edges of his chair, hands in loose fists. “You’re basically asking him to compromise his livelihood-”
Castiel titled his head to the side and hummed his response "I would expect nothing less from the noble who is rumoured to have swept half the Royal Court of their feet. I shall find myself entertainment. I hear the Louvre is quite the sight." Castiel looked out the window, already getting excited at the prospect of being in a place that will allow a better sense of autonomy than his home. He has been making plans of visiting galleries and theaters by himself, maybe even dine at a local coffeehouse if he was careful and clever enough.
Yet, Castiel didn’t want to. He set up Jack’s old bedside crib near his own bed again. The boy seemed thrilled with the turn of events, grabbing a couple of Castiel’s fingers in one hand, gripping his sleep aid in the other, and dummy in his mouth. It took an embarrassingly short few seconds for him to be deep asleep.
“His Majesty, my father, is very eager to come to favourable conclusions. He does hope this will be resolved quickly,” he hears Princess Margot say.
“We should be on our way now,” he tells the room and Dior makes his way to Cas’ side, putting down his hand muff on the sofa, and makes haste in buttoning up Castiel’s coat, throwing a warning glance towards him.
. As if his day hasn’t been going to shit already, his body decides to go through some weird late puberty shit where it gives him body hair none of his clients are going to take lightly to. He knew the fact that he’s taller and more angular than your average omega will come to bite him in the ass at some point.
It’s then he notices there is a slight fluff of blond hair sprinkled on his forearms. He stops and brings his arm at eye level, squinting at the thin strands glinting in the morning winter sun. Dior is stunned - the hair wasn’t there last night when he was giving himself a quick wipe down after the last alpha.
As promised, Balthazar has one of the passing servants bring them their coats, and then they start making their way outdoors.
He might be at the bottom of the barrel but he’s still got arms and legs and doesn’t need anyone else’s.
His shoulders slump in relief - disbelief coursing through him at having managed to find adequate housing so quickly. He might be able to pull this off, after all.
Castiel nods and they make their way through the paths, admiring the multitude of trees on their every side. Dean was right - their selection was very wide and Castiel briefly wondered how hard it was to keep track of all of them and if the upkeep was worth the profit. The land, from what he could see, was actually quite impressive in size, having walked for maybe five minutes and not yet arrived at their destination.
The older woman’s smile slips and she skips the pleasantries, straightening out her back, “What happened to you, boy? Look at the state of you.”
He and Dean go around the area together, looking at different sizes and shapes. Castiel’s house has taller ceilings than average but he doesn’t want a tree taller than he is. It’d seem excessive seeing as it’s just him and Jack. Dean asks him to think about where he’s placing it in order to try to eye out one that’s not too wide.
For as long as he can remember, Prince Castiel has loathed being woken from slumber by anyone. When he was a child, he’d start crying until he was allowed to return to bed, regardless of the fact he would wake himself up thirty minutes later. He supposes it was one of the reasons he was regarded as peculiar by his family and subjects. The servants and family have long since learned to wait for his quarter’s bell to ring and to not disturb him needlessly.
Dior thinks of the chocolate box he’s so carefully hidden between his garments and almost wants to tell Lisa that none of this matters to him. Not the ‘gifts’ and not Crowley. He stops himself, reluctant to tell her about the prince’s gift, an unpleasant sensation building in his stomach.
"The heavens wept when God created you, sent you on Earth. The angels mourned the loss of the most beautiful and bright of brothers," he whispers, low but loud with admiration. "Who would not want to keep you in their sights? Least of all an unworthy man."
Instead, he basks in giving good night embraces and pecks, wishes on top of wishes and none are for him. And that’s alright - he doesn’t need any.
The first to speak - well, to break into a sob on her way to throwing herself in his arms - is Marjorie, the small thing of barely fifteen. She hides in his chest, head not even grazing his collarbone and fists bunching at the front of his clothes.
Next, he looked up a Christmas tree nursery. The problem was Castiel flatly refused a cut one and apparently, that’s all they did around these parts. What happened to getting a potted tree and nurturing it beyond the holiday?
Dior shushes him like one might silence a child, making Castiel feel chastised but no less concerned.
A knock came right as he was about to reach for the tinder box. “Good morning, Your Royal Highness. May I enter?” the maid asked.
The coachman takes his top hat off and gives his scalp a brief scratch, “Not a lot will be open at this time of the night, my Lord”. Castiel’s heart sinks. “Although I hear there is a new couturier - Caesar Cuevas - that arrived in Paris but a month ago. Been gossip that he’s eager to get exposure.”
The table murmurs their assent and Castiel catches Balt and the Princess’ eyes, giving an almost imperceptible roll of his own. Both of them give tiny huffs of amusement at his antics, pleasing him greatly.
“Alpha!” Dior raises his voice, tone trembling on the last letter. Castiel’s breath catches and his resolve falters for a second before it’s back in place.
The fact that she was the one to bring the plate over to him, combined with the trickle of pink he could see in her cheeks, made his chest constrict less.
God, he must be more exhausted than he thought if his mattress feels this damn good. There is the clicking of a clock that lulls him slowly back to sleep.
Castiel hears a high whimper which he believes to be from his counterpart at first, but realises soon enough that it was actually Dior, who has now dropped his head in the crook of his neck, nose tenderly pressing behind his ear.
Next, he makes his way to a hotel that’s close enough to the maison that it’s going to make it easier for him to visit - but not close enough for Crowley to come sniffing around. The building is nothing impressive to look at with its bland cement walls and dark wood, chipping windows, but it’s clean and not hidden in a dingy alleyway.
There are two slits at elbow height in front of each arm, openings through which Dior currently has his arms sticking out, only for them to quickly disappear back into a tunnel of fur that is almost the length of an entire forearm - a hand muff.
. Once he’s finished lining out all of the requirements, he feels himself turn ruddy - these all sounded like demands. A nervous buzz starts playing under his skin - the beta could turn inhospitable at a moment’s notice if he gets out of turn.
They pass Castiel’s carriage, the driver shouting after them but not following. All for the better - Cas is in no state of being around anyone else right now, not even betas.
“I miss him, too. It’s hard - He was with me full-time until I started here. We’re both adjusting.” he said.
The omega stops a good distance from him, leaving enough space between them that Cas can take him in properly - greedily.
“Fish, amongst other things,” Balthazar replied. “You know what else I can smell? No responsibilities - and it smells
There is some Spanish in this chapter that I, once again, relied on google translate for, yikes! If any of you speak it and are horrified at it - you have my heartfelt apologies.
If at all possible, Dean’s face changes shades completely, going from pink to bright red. If this was one of Jack’s cartoons, Castiel thinks he might have had smoke coming out of his ears. He found it ridiculously endearing and so much harder to take his eyes away from him. If anything, Dean’s flustered reaction has given Castiel a confidence boost.
Dior clenches tighter on reflex, basically trapping Castiel’s fingers. It doesn’t deter the alpha at all and he repeats the back and forth motion once, twice, thrice before he drags them out of the confines the omega created.
One of the men and the woman are crowding the second man, who is touching both of their chests, back against the post and bending at a perfect angle to accentuate beautiful legs and golden hair.
To his delight, she smiles at him - his raised voice forgotten. He looks around the kitchen and comes to a startling realisation.
“Everything seems to be in order. Your penis has no marks or boils, sensitivity is good, and colour normal. Your anus has no cuts or grazes-” Dior thanks whatever entity exists out there for that “- and your canal looks perfect and boring in its normalcy. Very good fluid secretion.”
Dior flushes, shame creeping up his neck. She didn’t know where they came from or what they could’ve been used for, but Dior did, and having someone ask that in broad daylight made him shrivel.
Dior was there the first time a client visit went south for Lisa, he was there to massage feeling back into her numb thighs, clean the open wounds on her scalp where small clumps of her beautiful hair had been pulled out. He still remembers her silent trail of tears as he rubbed her back until sleep took over her.
His friend could only shrug. “Society has evolved, mayhaps. That does not mean all families progress with it.”
Dior's hackles rise. What’s with people and telling him he doesn’t smell right? He smells fine, damn it!
His thinking is interrupted by Cas stirring. He lets out a sleepy sound before twitching his fingers - so close to Dior’s own,
It’s like a slap across his face because Dior is the furthest thing from it. He’s barely doing anything. He promised Lisa he’d be there for her and not even a week down the line he’s failing her.
The omegas look at each other and Chrissie pushes them back down, shaking her head, “We can smell you from outside the door, Dior.”
He picks up his pace, cold sweat running down his back along with the fever one. It’s record time he makes to the hotel Lisa is staying in. The lobby is empty tonight but
“Please forgive me if this is too forward - but it sounds to me like your preferences have a lot to do with your experience, rather than the aesthetic,” Dior resumes their conversation, bringing the prince back to their conversation rather than on the pink of the omega’s ears.
The other omega takes a long look at him, finally clocking onto his clammy skin, deep eyebags, the way his hair is plastered to his forehead and neck despite it not snowing right now.
One of Dior’s hands appears in his field of vision, resting close to his - but not touching, dragging his attention to the plant he has between his fingers - glove grinded green, the leaf damaged. He snatches his hand away from it as if burned, guilt settling in his soul.
At first, there is nothing, again, and the omega is ready to scratch his fingernails off on the walls, watch blood bloom - but then his skin starts to redden, sharp, almost trivial pain starts spreading all over. He looks down at himself in the water, among the colourful petals, leaves and plant stalks and is helpless in letting out an enormous sob, followed by big gulps of air one after the others.
,” Dior whispers, not taking his eyes off it. “I imagine this is what clouds would feel like if one could touch them. I have never -  never touched anything this wonderful,” he says, bringing his eyes back up, delight shining in emerald pools.
” she shouts back in French, snapping her jaws like an unhinged hyena Dior had once glimpsed at a circus.
“What the hell are you doing?” Chrissie shouts next to his ear before roughly pulling him back up. “Are you trying to melt off your face?”
The new person slams the door, dropping a fine leather, maroon suitcase on the floor. Fingers with long, razor-sharp,
but restrains himself. He is taken aback at how easy it would be to let that line out of his mouth and into existence. Flirting isn’t something he does. Or, it wasn’t.
“You have your work cut out with this one. His baby blues could guilt anyone into feeling sorry for him.” the assistant said and then handed over a piece of paper. “It’s the nursery’s Christmas schedule. There’s information about the days we’ll be closed and the short days.”
Alastair.” he said, back straight and gaze unwavering. His scent took on a steely form, thick enough that it left no room for argument.
about him. Ever since the death of his wife, he has become a recluse,” Alastair scoffed. “To make such a fuss over the death of one beta. There are thousands more willing bodies out there to warm his bed.”
“Quite well, father. I have managed a good amount of sleep and the hot bath this morning has eased any aches. I’m elated to have woken up with an appetite, too!” Anna replied enthusiastically. Castiel had to agree that she appeared in much better spirits today than she had this past week. There was a speckle of blush in her cheeks that had, unfortunately, been absent for a while. It was a shame, really. Anna had been born with a poor constitution, their parents having had problems conceiving after bringing Castiel into the world. It had taken them many losses and 8 years before their family had been blessed with Anna. It was a relief when she hadn’t presented by 15 and the royal physician declared her a beta, rather than an omega or alpha. It meant there weren’t going to be any more health complications that would come with imminent ruts or heats.
The workday followed the same pattern it always did, the routine only half-welcome. In-between emails, editing documents, and a meeting, Castiel ruminated over what Charlie had told him. Was he being a bad guardian for not trying to make Jack’s first Christmas ‘special’? It seemed a bit absurd, seeing as the boy won’t even remember it.
The alpha interrupts the other man by hastily taking off his own, knitted woolen scarf and winding it a couple of times around the slender neck, tying an elegant, loose knot at the front.
Expectation and elatedness of a degree Castiel was not aware he was capable of surge through his whole being and he, quite literally, starts shivering in anticipation.
“Two weeks is the minimum for long term and it’s cheaper than the daily charge. How long were you thinking?” she asks, opening a leather-bound book that resembles the one Crowley has - a slightly disturbing detail, for some reason.
“Of course, Your Highness. Please, show the way,” Castiel bowed again and then offered his elbow to her, giving the other people a short nod of his own.
“Alright, Mother Nature,” his friend quips, putting up his hands in mock surrender, letting go of the bud, which bounces back softly, as if nothing even touched it to begin with. “Did she make any remarks about the lengthening of our stay?”
He walked the Louvre’s halls excitedly, feeling like he was eight years old again in his mother’s greenhouse, following a group of bees around as they went from flower to flower. He sat on the benches provided in each room and allowed his mind to absorb the superb art in front of him, paying close attention to the strokes, imagining the way the artist might have moved their wrists and the way paint would be splattered at the base of the easel. At that moment, he was glad that Britain had started to be open to Romanticism (even if he disagreed with ignoring Rationalism, because why could these two not co-exist?) and his mother had seen it worth to have her children well versed in many forms of art.
Cas is only furtively taken aback by his bodily response before lifting himself slightly, still on his knees, body searching for his own, “I can help. You do not need to put yourself in harm’s way like this, Dior. Ask of me what you need and you shall receive.”
He observes his face next. Why does he seem so surprised? Surely this other-him expected this? Was there ever any other ending? Of course not - and he’d be stupid to think otherwise.
might have happened,” Dior laughs. Castiel basks in the sound, letting it enforce the threads holding his heart together.
He does not linger on it. He cannot - despite wanting to reciprocate right away. He does not allow himself to think about how the man would look with drooping eyelids, breathing softly, body pliant-
She asks him to sit on his hands and knees after she’s satisfied with his front. Her hands are cold despite having sucked all warmth out of his skin. It makes Dior shiver. The instruments are freezing him from inside out when she opens him up like a turkey he hears people stuff for holidays in America.
He starts taking out some of them to show Lisa: a copper hair clip with foggy crystals, a black leather collar that was in fashion last year, a bottle of scent amplifier perfume, a couple of lace open-crotch drawers that Dior absolutely loathes.
That is the least of Dior’s worries right now. His mind is on Lisa and the knowledge nobody’s seen her today. Weighing his options, he decides this can’t be hidden from Crowley - better tell him first before he finds out when it gets to Lisa’s turn, which is only third in line.
= specific area on the body where scents tend to accumulate and be most potent; located at the wrists, behind ears, inside of elbows, back of knees and groin; betas do not possess this.
How could he have forgotten how spellbinding the omega was? His scent is back to its neutral tones, allowing the alpha to take in everything about the vision before him - because that is what Dior has been from the moment he entered Castiel’s life. Had it only been a fortnight? It seemed like a lifetime, since he was allowed to witness this wondrous man.
It does not fail to grab his notice how the Omega Princess appears to prefer taking her meals in the presence of the dignitaries rather than her own family’s. The Royal Family does not dine with their little party often - in fact, Castiel would put it at exactly three times in the two weeks they have resided at the palace. It is not improper for them to, per say, but everyone is aware the King discusses national issues at large with the Crown and Beta Princesses at meal times.
“Wonderful. Let him know I will be not a minute,” he instructed the butler before turning back to his family. “I shall take my leave. I bid you all a good day,” Castiel says whilst getting up and pressing a chaste kiss to his sister’s cheek before heading out, grabbing his coat from Alfie.
He kind of wishes he’d be able to stay awake, to let himself cry endlessly, but he is so fucking tired, his body won’t even allow that.
Castiel watches him bend down to pour fresh tea into the cups. His wide-open shirt rustles and it grabs the prince’s attention, his gaze briefly following the movement and noticing a small, oval, white scar with one jagged edge, where his mating glad would be if he had one. He frowns and squints at it for a second.
Despite the fact that most of the people present nod their agreements, it brings him no sense of accomplishment.
As he comes closer, he’s relieved to find the matron is a beta. Her being a beta doesn’t say much for her personality since some of them tend to have the same societal expectation from omegas as alphas do. They thread a thin line in the balance but still deal a better hand than his gender.
Cain must have noticed him getting anxious and put Dior’s arm around his elbow again, leading him toward the exit. “Let us go, Dior. We still have lunch to attend and I don't want to send you home on an empty stomach.”
"Very well, Cassie." he heard Balth give a small, resigned sigh. "Just… Please do not shut me out. You know you will always have little old me if you need."
He closed his heart off like he had so many times in his past. He could physically feel the stony remains being encompassed in ice as he led the four of them to one of the tables, laid out the game for them and offered drinks. If his nose decided to develop a mind of his own and inhale the honey scent, that was none of his business.
He wipes between her fingers, making sure to get under her fingernails as well, “No. All in your own time,
“What is the matter?” he asks, eyes wide in wonder. The vibrations don’t stop - his heart aches with them. “Do you not believe yourself to be worthy of salvation? Of
Such was tonight, Jack vehemently refusing to settle in his crib. Castiel would sing and cradle him to the point of small snoozing sounds, only for him to start crying again the moment Castiel tried to lay him down. An hour later and still no luck, he decided enough is enough, no matter what all those parenting books said about letting them ‘cry it out’. It worked when it worked and tonight was obviously not one of those nights.
They headed out of his room together, Alfie two steps behind. He opened the door to the dining hall for Castiel and bowed. Castiel saw his parents and oldest siblings already sitting, enjoying cups of tea, and chatting about this morning’s newspaper.
“Sugar, hey, breathe,” the beta whispers, a small hand finding his over the desk. “Look at me, honey. Breathe with me.”
The Crown Princess finally let Dior’s face go but not before digging her nails in for a split second. His skin was smarting, sure sign she had left at least soft red marks, if not shallow scratches. Now free, he allowed himself to turn his head towards the alpha, surprised to find he was staring at him with the same intensity as back in the hall. It took his breath away, being the focus of those gems.
It does not take long for his fragile good mood to get catapulted into the unknown when the conversation picks up again - this time on a completely different matter. The next person to speak amidst metal clanking is an older alpha from Russia. Castiel groans internally, mentally preparing himself for what is sure to be an absolutely ludicrous statement from the dark-haired man. Even amongst the dignitaries, everyone is well aware of how Russia is the most unwilling participant in these treaties, one of their main purposes being the domination of trade and travel routes through the Black Sea into the Mediterranean. Most definitely not how to peacefully coexist and improve international relationships.
Dior finally manages to rip his eyes away from Cas’ heated ones, choosing instead to appraise the cape. He takes a hand out of the muff and lets it sink into the fluffy strands of fur. “I have to agree - they are perfect. I didn’t think it was possible for anything to be softer than the blanket you brought,” he huffs a small laugh. “I was proven wrong, of course.”
And then… Then, Cas starts dragging his hands down Dior’s thighs, following their curve slowly down, toward the inside of his knee. He dips his fingers in the crevice and massages soothing circles in the skin there. The omega’s breath hitches.
And for the first time since he woke up, Dior exhales in relief despite the fact that she’s putting pressure where he’s sure there’s a cluster of blisters on the back of his neck.
“A cold,” he tells her, giving a half-hearted cough that even he doesn’t believe. “I’ve been careless.”
. The bath is all ready. Can you please wake everyone up to bathe and start on breakfast? Everything is laid out for French toast so ask someone to make the mixture and I’ll come down in time to help with frying.”
“Four for birth,” he says, staring after the feathered creature, taking in its colouring and how it quickly disappears, gliding through the wind, freedom a given. The wind seems to have changed, the atmosphere shifting to something heavier. He tries not to give it too much thought - even though Castiel’s intuition has always been awfully accurate.
The other man stops as soon as the words escape him, Castiel stopping with him. Dior bends his head down slightly so he can look straight at him, eyes big and scent singing an unsure tune of embarrassed and touched.
“You think I don’t know that?” she asks him, tone annoyed. “This isn’t me pining for him and hoping he’ll come back to sweep me off my feet.”
, Castiel thinks. If that is what is needed for him to get his point across to the omega, he is willing to be the cause of it.
Castiel does not feel as though he is in his right mind… which is probably why the next thing he says is, “You can call me a liar - call me anything under the sun - if it will make you smell like sunshine again.”
Making sure he maintains eye contact, away from unmarked, heavily-freckled skin, he tells Dior about how this past week has been an absolute menace, how they have had back to back meetings for most of the days. He laments having to listen to so many outdated and downright cruel ideas and perceptions, frustration growing due to being bound by politics, and thus, unable to express his honest opinions.
“No, you haven’t. That’s brilliant - what better way to destress after another atrocious meeting with the knotheads inside?” his friend says and Castiel opens his eyes to see him lean back, hands gripping the edges of the fountain. “Excited?”
He really is - but he’s kept a mental note of his profit and it’s not enough. It’ll pay for a room for a while, but if he’s to help Lisa for more than a couple of weeks, he’ll need a lot more. This is where he hopes the jewelry he’s got left in his bag will bring him a better amount.
"So, are we ready for our upcoming journey to one of my home countries?" Balthazar said, waking Castiel out of his reverie.
The prince finds himself relocating to Dior’s bench, the omega quickly spreading the blanket across his lap as well, making sure it is tucked snugly to his side. There is a mortifying moment when Castiel thinks he will blurt out
Dior doesn’t watch her go through her mental checklist as she lifts and pokes at him. He tried to watch the first few times he had to go through this, hoping to ease the burn in his cheeks and eyes. When that didn’t work, he decided he’s better off not looking.
wasn’t fit. On the contrary, he seemed to be all lean lines and taut muscles - much to his groin’s approval. It was the way he held himself and looked at Dior, an unknown expression set on his face.
Before anyone can answer, the kitchen door swings open and Crowley looks at Dior then past him, addressing them as a collective unit. “Glad to see we’re all ready. Doctor Sunders is here,” he says and turns his gaze to Dior, this time explicitly talking to him. “Ruby’s done you her usual courtesy of taking your place of being first in line.”
, how lovely it is to see you here!” Balthazar greeted back, perhaps more stiffly than usual. “His Highness and I were starting to worry none of our acquaintances are here.”
seemed to bloom in the alpha’s scent. Seriously, what the hell was he on about, thinking he can smell
He clenches his teeth and snatches the box from his pocket before the beta can say anything in response. He unties the bow hastily and almost slams it on the wooden desk with a frantic look in his eyes. The woman looks at him, concern marring her docile features but Dior pays her no heed.
They’d been out for a while, and despite Jack being fed regularly and given toys for entertainment, he was starting to get squeamish. It’d been a while since they’ve been out together for so long and Castiel supposed it was enough excitement for now. There was still the tree itself to buy, but he reckoned they could go later in the day after jack had a proper nap at home. The zoo would have to wait another day.
His palms have changed direction again. They caress over blemished skin, unstoppable in their mission. The pain is unfocused, now. Dior's eyelids flutter, exhaustion a blanket in the chilliest of nights.
Dior knew enough about noble interaction to see the Prince’s reply for what it was: a command for Alastair to depart on his own. He had never seen someone command the alpha like this before, so confidently and with no remorse. He could feel Alastair wanting to snap but then realising who it is he’s dealing with before bowing and leaving with the proverbial tail between his legs. It was incredible.
“No. But it stopped as it began - swiftly,” Dior shakes his head and rolls his neck experimentally. He feels oddly hollow as if he’s missing a very important piece of information. He tries to remember what it was that went through his head at the time but he’s coming up blank. It feels like something happened, a shadow billowing behind him begging to be looked at - but when he turns around to do so it disappears and he’s unable to gaze upon it.
The other omega looks conflicted, at war with not wanting to burden Dior but desperately wishing to protect her unborn offspring. Dior takes everything out of the box and dumps it in a cloth bag, tying it up.
Annoyance and frustration join the worry that has been bubbling and floating around his head, causing him to groan and resume scrubbing aggressively.
Cain considered him with a strange look. Dior’s shame grew, heat rising from his neck all the way to the top of his ears. He should’ve kept his own damn mouth shut. Of course the man would feel taken advantage of. First he offers Dior not one, but multiple books as a gift, and then he goes and asks for more.
“How are you inclined to spend the day, Monsieur Cain? I am not opposed to more knife-wielding training. Chess would also be agreeable as I have missed playing.” Dior asked, excited to hear what the man had planned.
The way he says it drips with barely contained fond exasperation - and that overjoys the prince. It makes him believe that Dior and him are no longer strangers - that they have crossed the threshold into friendship. Castiel is not daft - he knows that he is buying Dior’s time right now and remains his client, regardless. But--
She growls, bringing that same pointy end on his cheek and pushing down, Dior’s head exploding in white bursts. He wants to scream at the top of his lungs, gunshots firing behind his eyelids. He only lets out a single whimper - just the way she likes.
He half-turns toward a small hallway and straightens his arm toward it, “Could you follow me, please?” he asks Dior.
“Well - I mean, of course.” Dior started, confused as to why an alpha of the Prince’s status would even contemplate stepping into a
The beta side-eyes him whilst she cleans her instruments on the side. “And you’re as perky as you were last week. And the week before that. And so on.”
“If this is your way of asking nicely, I don’t want to know what the less pleasant version is,” Crowley replies, but does not move Dior’s feet.
“We don’t get paid. Everything we earn goes to Crowley. The taxes are sixty-five percent of our earnings, fifteen percent goes to Crowley for food and maintenance of the building and the rest is our due to him for the housing, medical needs, and his protection,” Dior explains, taking another sip of his forgotten water. It feels amazing on his parched throat.
Is Dior going to scent mark him? He is a mere few centimeters away from his scent gland, the alpha becoming painfully aware that his body is already adjusting to this development - a wave of honey and well-loved paper wafting strongly enough to disperse in the closed quarters, ready to interlock with another scent.
Ruby still isn’t out when Crowley returns from upstairs, his face betraying no sign of anything being wrong. Of course, not everyone knows Crowley the way Dior does. He can see the alpha’s stiffer walk, his brows brought together minutely - it’s enough to set his nerves on edge.
You have eased the worries of this old man,” Cain replied. He already did appear in better spirits. “I know I don’t have to worry about you, but you ought to know there will be the most distinguished guests in attendance. The other duke, viscounts, marquises, etcetera. I have also invited the foreign representatives the Royals are currently hosting. The Royal family itself as well, of course. But they never make an appearance, the invitation was just a courtesy.”
“Princess Abbadon, I see you have found my wayward prince. I am deeply indebted to you,” Balt bowed low and kissed one of the princess’ hands. “I will take this troublemaker off your hands so you can return to the table. Your sisters have been anxiously awaiting your return.”
and given them the status of courtesans but not the autonomy that comes with it. Dior knew why that was.
, he thinks “-and suddenly I have to accept everything you bring to the table, no doubt ending in taking a knot over and over and have to
He could see the shore now. Twinkling lights in the distance, but not quite near enough to hear the bustle that goes along with a busy port. Castiel grabbed onto the rails of the ship with both hands and inhaled the air deeply. The soft breeze brought forth whiffs of fish, sweat, ale, and coal amongst other things. It smelled like
, he could not help but feel reluctant to see it as truth. According to them, it is normal for the inner wolf to start manifesting in puberty, not long before a youth’s first mating cycle - in the case of omegas and alphas.
The beta closes his eyes and laughs, looking relaxed and giving the half of the room where everything resides a fond look.
,” he continues, “I have taken the initiative of investigating many reports from our law enforcers. It appears most of the altercations have stemmed from a married beta disregarding an alpha’s position for the sake of their beta spouse.”
? Shall we stop the game for now and return to the main room? A group of such esteemed and handsome Alphas should not be hidden away from the main activities.” He purred, shivering inwardly. God, he hated all of them so much and wanted to gag at the scent of arousal coming from Alastair. He could feel his hand snaking up his arse, groping him.
“What are you even doing here? Why are you not at the palace? Are you stalking me, huh, is that it?” Dior says, voice loud enough to echo ominously in the night. He hugs himself to the point of pain, fingernails digging into the flesh of his right bicep. He ignores the small, meager and rational part of his brain that says if that was the case, the Prince would’ve stepped in when his first client bent him over in the alley.
“No - they’re just things that were put upon me. It’s different,” he replies, “And if selling them means I can help? I’ll be glad to be rid of them.”
The thought alone makes Castiel’s skin itchy with anger, grief and hopelessness. Logically, he knows he could not have helped, because they did not know of the other’s existence - but the feeling of having failed yet another person permeates him.
“My late wife,” Cain started, “she was an artist. She enjoyed art as much as she enjoyed life. It would not be far-fetched to say that she lived and breathed art. We spent much of our free time together; but when I was gone, art was her lover.”
“What about your sister? Or perhaps your father? I am eager to listen,” the omega says, looping their arms together again and tactfully steering him down the pathways once again. The snow is falling a bit heavier now, the crowd of people thinner than before, their steps crunching underneath.
His fingers curl protectively around her wrist, not too tight to hurt but tightly enough to show her he’s here, present “You don’t know that.”
“M-make it- make it stop!” he howls, fighting for some sort of grip on the arms around his body. “It burns, it burns, it
He gets out of the tub, not even wincing when his crimson skin pulls in what should be a painful way. That hurt is barely there, whereas the abdominal and chest pains have not ceased, becoming a pumping misery that makes him want to curl in a nest of a thousand blankets, nose buried in a scent token from Cas-
And yet… he couldn’t stop himself from trying his best to display himself as enticing as possible. He leaned down and whispered in patrons’ ears, he’d make an effort to laugh boisterously to dimwitted jokes and unimpressive pool moves. Worse, he kept positioning his body in such ways that his ass would be accentuated that was
The Prince did not have the courage to look backwards and witness the displeased faces of French nobility. It would not have been the proper thing to do, regardless. And so they both made their way to the entrance where they gave their invitation to the butler and their capes and hats to a female servant. The butler greeted them appropriately then led them down the corridor. He went through a very large set of dark wooden doors with golden handles and immediately announced their presence.
as a way of getting a rise out of him. The dark-haired man doesn’t think Dean realises he’d just nicknamed this stranger and set him alight with excitement.
As it happens when you’re feeling like you’re at the brink of death, Dior forgets what today is, what his regular appointments are. Crowley usually comes up before the first clients trickle in just to remind him and Ruby of their schedules.
“Your highness, Princess Margot. Are those the escorts’ names, Inias and Hael?” Castiel asks her with genuine interest.
As quickly as the wave of arousal hits the trenches of his body, it retreats just as quickly into the night never to be seen again.
Dior is still silent when they reach the carriage - still has not uttered another word when the prince retrieves the blanket and wraps it around his shoulders this time, instructing him to keep hold of it before closing the carriage door and disappearing around to the front of it.
It is a great relief when Dior accepts. He appears excited at the prospect, scent still of muddy-water but less rancid, expression open, but stiff. The omega asks him to wait outside whilst he changes into outdoor clothing - but not before teasing Castiel by telling him he is welcome to remain in the room. He does not.
Another exasperated look marrs Dior’s features and the prince silently wonders what it says about him - the fact that he revels in the multitude of expressions he has managed to pry out of the omega today, regardless if they were positive or not.
Alastair snagged his waist tightly and leaned his face into his own, his pungent ash smell cloying the air. “Continue this beguilement and you might find yourself in danger,
Castiel’s heart skips a beat and fails to remember that it is supposed to go on afterward. He lifts his head and chances another look in the omega’s eyes, shame still burning brightly. There is no hurt, no blame to be picked apart from Dior - right now, he is the embodiment of calm, of fondness, of-
He keeps his expression open and scent clear, agitation crawling under his skin, “What do you mean - not allowed to?”
“They are,” she answered him. “You may call me Meg, Your Highness. I find ‘Margot’ doesn’t suit me right,” she smiles at him good-naturedly. “The pleasure extends to you as well, Monsieur Balthazar.”
The prince and the omega turn their heads sharply - both surprised by the sound, having forgotten where they were. Jesse places the tray on the coffee table in front of them.
“I loved it,” Dior says, expression soft, thankful - smell repulsive. “It was - it was the best thing I have ever received, Castiel.”
The question is unexpected even to him, so it is only natural Dior would be baffled when he says, “Excuse me?”
“Headaches are not very serious, Dior. Migraines on the other hand - they can be dangerous,” the prince tells the omega. He thinks of Anna’s migraines and how she would be in constant agony for as long as weeks, about how they cause her to be bedridden a lot of time and render her powerless.
The cover is nondescript, a simple pink background with a silver border. Dior opens it and is greeted by rows and rows of baby names, followed by their pronunciation and their meanings.
A small bucket appears out of nowhere and no sooner than it does, Dior leans over it and brings up his breakfast along with what feels to be the entirety of his stomach contents. It’s bitter and disgusting, the taste sticking to his teeth and provoking another wave of nausea. He watches as the bucket slowly fills with his waste and he dazedly wonders if one can die from such a thing.
He’s down to nine francs and forty-five centimes. The soap was on sale, three for the price of ninety-nine centimes.
This chapter fought me tooth and nail for reasons not even I can understand - which is very frustrating. It ran very long and I had barely gone through half of my chapter outline so I took the advice of my beta and cut it so there would be 2 long-ish chapters, rather than the mammoth it would've been otherwise.
“You’ll take good care of these for me, won’t you, Cas?” he asks, clutching to the fabric of the blanket.
That’s all he managed to get her. Not even half of his hourly charge. Enough to last her a few weeks, not enough to help her in any substantial way. His fingernails dig into the skin of his palm, pain blooming in small bursts.
Cas shifts around on the bed so he is no longer sitting half off of it. Instead, he grabs Dior’s thighs and keeps him secure whilst he twists in one single motion in order to sit up against Dior’s headboard. He goes to untangle Dior’s legs from behind him.
“Won’t you take a bath with us? It might neutralise some of-” Chrissie calls after him when he goes to exit the room.
He and the alpha moved along the museum arm in arm, Cain explaining as much as he could about as many paintings and statues as possible. Dior listened ardently, finding everything so fascinating. He was also very impressed with the alpha’s vast art knowledge and did actually tell him so.
Cas is only lightly stunned by this piece of news, starting to get accustomed to being constantly impressed by this man. Commoners are usually versed in a single language - mostly verbal, regardless of their primary gender, due to families not being able to afford sending their pups to school as it would mean losing the extra working hands and income. And since the parents were not taught either, the vicious cycle continues. This is yet another thing that starts up that incessant itch Castiel feels whenever he finds out something new about the omega, which only prompts the wish to learn even
The nursery assistant was looking at him in a way that was both awkward and pitying. “I could just take him, sir. He’ll settle once you go.”, they said.
“Oh. I see,” was all Castiel could add to that. He knew prostitutes existed, of course. However, back home they were seen as less than people, worse than sub-class citizens. There had been many discussions about the moral implications of such occupations, and how to end as much of it as possible. The meetings were never compassionate to these people. It was always about how to subjugate, threaten and intimidate them in stopping. Castiel had always felt horrid for sitting in on those meetings and being unable to make a difference - any difference. Most of these changes were based upon vote, so it was always him against everyone else.
Dior doesn’t think any further about it, just in case his nerves fail him. He shifts in bed so he’s kneeling on all fours, one arm stretching to wrap around Cas’ collar and
Sweat and pheromones and iron explode and the omega almost pukes his guts out on the already grimy cobblestone.
Cain had lent him a while ago that explained the basics of being a merchant, including tips on haggling and generic price tags of more common items.
He can’t see past his nose anymore. If Dior could, he’d be witness to the way Castiel goes white and somber. His head is thumping, his ears are ringing - the only thing he can discern now is his own voice.
He takes a few coins out, counting them hidden in his fist. Turning to the beta, he thanks her for her help and wishes her a productive day.
They all said ‘ewww’ in unison and had all degrees of disgust on their faces. He cared a great deal about these kids. He knew what it was like to be discarded by society and be regarded as useless. Having a roof over their heads, even if they were giving something so precious in return, was a blessing. At least they were all registered with the government, which meant they were protected against being arrested or in danger of being raped whilst trying to survive on the streets. He gave Lorette, the brown-haired girl, a kiss on the forehead and told them to quit the gossip and finish washing. Dior then took care of his own bath, filling a pail with water and sending it up using the dumbwaiter.
Dior has no towel or camomile flowers so he makes up for it by bringing his face closer than what’s probably safe since his skin is
, he assumes. It is the only plant in the waiting room he was unceremoniously shoved into. Lone as it is, it is still an impressive, tall specimen.
Dior shushes her again, “With this,” he says, and moves his hand under his bed, blindingly looking for something and sliding a wooden box out. He brings it to his lap and lets Lisa stare at it.
“I hear pretty lies every day,” he laughs and puts his head on the back of the sofa, exposing an enticing expanse of skin that raises goosebumps at the back of Castiel’s own neck. “The truth ought to be better.”
“It sounds like she was an enchanting lady. You seem to have loved her a great deal.” Dior said, softly rubbing the alpha’s forearm in a comforting gesture.
By the time the two men get to the end of the hallway and entrance to the lounge, Castiel is on his feet, arms linked at his front, eagerness kneading inside of him.
And so he clings to that length of rope and lets himself dangle, silently hoping it’ll all be done, soon.
Castiel sighs and they fall into a normal pace next to each other, “I apologise for my outburst. I just could not sit there and listen to such rubbish.”
Options were limited, seeing as Castiel refused to spend it with their family in New York, despite the invitation. He ground his teeth when he remembered his mum trying to manipulate and emotionally blackmail him into coming down for Thanksgiving, regardless of the fact that they hadn’t talked since-
He could feel his face break in what must have been a hugely dumb smile. His face hurt, using muscles he almost never used. It only grew that much bigger when
soon,” the alpha explained, his composure seemingly getting stiffer and scent more bitter by the second. He was now puffing his chest up and was paying minute attention to their surroundings.
, she had been older than most omegas, her personality more than halfway formed, making it hard for her to adjust. It took a while for her to stop looking like she’d consider doing something… something stupid.
Baseless or not, it’s the only thing holding him together, a thin length of rope he’s clutching to deliriously. If he lets go, Dior is sure it can only be death waiting for him at the end of the drop.
Dean’s grin turns into an outright beam and their surroundings suddenly seem brighter, as if the man itself was the light source and everything else gets to bask in it. Castiel realises with a start that Dean’s eyes are green - an evergreen that promises forests and whispers in the dark, smiles in crowds, and lives lived well. They have flashes of gold now and he doesn’t know if that’s simply the light from the lamp posts or if it’s possible for someone’s soul to shine through irises.
“I would like to call you a liar, Castiel. But your scent makes it impossible to do so,” the omega says, backing away three steps, eyes never leaving him, scarf bundled in a fist and hanging along the line of his thigh. The alpha feels bare under his scrutiny.
I love her, BTW!!! Her fic "Patient Love" is one of my favourites and I will literally GUSH about how beautiful it is to anyone who wants to listen. Give that a read if you're a fan of AUs in which there's angst and comfort galore.
“Are we ready, gentlemen?” He asked around the table, looking at each of the players, locking eyes for no more than a second, giving them a playful smile.
They exchange good-natured looks and share laughter before Castiel excuses himself for a moment and makes his way to the front of the carriage. He tells the coachman to wait for his instructions for when they can depart, the coachman agreeing with a polite
He was close to letting his temper slip through his cracks - which might be close to the only thing he inherited from his mother’s personality - when someone blessedly interrupted them. Castiel turned toward this new participant and was surprised to see the Crown Princess approach them.
Castiel does not deign the unpleasant man with a reply and neither does Dior - which pleases him endlessly. He wants Dior to know his worth, revel in his own charisma and not have to engage with anyone that is not willing to show him the respect owed to him.
Dior shakes his head aggressively, jostling him and bringing forth another avalanche of burning. He can hear Cas’ pulse from where he is and refuses to let go.
“I did not come here for a spouse or to fornicate, Balt! Whether the Princess finds me attractive or not, it does not change anything. It is not in my interest or hers. Besides, you know I don’t…” Castiel rubbed at his temples tiredly but did not finish his sentence. It appears he did not have the patience for his friend’s antics today.
Dior can’t help but chuckle. Now that he knows how to help, he’s feeling unnervingly serene. “I know,
Castiel can not help it. He slows down once again and looks at his friend with carefully hidden interest, “I would be amenable to that.”
Cain sighed and rolled his wine inside his glass, looking very put off. “Yes, me. Unfortunately, it appears my fading from high society this past year has insinuated to some of my business competitors, and other noble families, that my influence has fallen. They have become quite bold in their actions, if not plain foolish.” He continued, “My associates have informed me that I must correct this and the simplest way would be to host an extravagant party of my own. Flaunt my wealth like some kind of peacock. Preparations have been going on for the better part of last month. Everything is ready except for one thing…”
They all made their way inside the palace, Castiel and Balthazar walking shoulder to shoulder at a very formal and appropriate distance behind the Royal Family. He marveled at the French architecture, the intricate designs, and statues that were peppered liberally in the impressive front gardens of the palace. Even with the onset of winter, everything still appeared lush green as if the time here stopped mid-spring. Countless breeds of flowers, bushes and trees were planted in sophisticated patterns, very much the model of the romantic trend France was the pioneer of. So strong were the aromas around him that it took him by surprise when he could not smell anything except for the surrounding greenery. No alpha, beta or omega scents. No bodily functions, no fumes or smoke or even
Dior wasn’t sure why Cain would think he didn’t need one or thought him well spoken. Did he just choose to ignore his unseemly speech and did not realise the extent of his ignorance? Or maybe he just could not fathom someone not being able to understand his books. Either way, Dior thanked him profusely for his benevolence.
“I’m glad,” he starts, voice low, placating, encouraging. “Then, would it be presumptuous of me to invite you on a carriage drive? I know it’s late but Paris is truly breathtaking at night, lamp posts shining like stars on Earth. I have a carriage ready - of course, that does not mean you are required to say yes. I - I would like nothing more than to have your company,” he finishes in a breath.
The Prince seemed pleased with the information. “It sounds simple enough.” he looked at Dior and looked like he wanted to say something before changing his mind. “Thank you, Dior. I need to depart now. Meeting you was the highlight of my evening and I am looking forward to seeing you again.”
, the young prince thought to himself, admiring both the Louvre and the people that were gathered on its grounds. Balthazar had told him that this was not peak time for tourism, and yet the number of visitors was nothing short of notable. He was curious to see just how many people could gather at those peak times.
The Prince interrupted him with a raise of his hand “Could I not come and make an appointment myself? I will send a footman if that is protocol, of course. I am merely curious.”
“Crowley,” he says more confidently than he feels, fists tightening next to his hips, “Lisa’s not down yet. I was going to check on her and ask her to come down.”
“What do you mean she volunteered? Crowley never lets us go in town for his errands,” he asks, a strain to his voice.
Balthazar breathes a huff of indignation but Castiel is focused on the bare branches, catching a glimpse of fluffy white feathers on a magpie’s stomach. “It’s oddly soothing,” he says.
“I don’t know, Cassie… If I was to make regular plans to see a person of a different presentation, such as, say, two times in a week - someone might be inclined to consider that I, at the very least, am showing
They return to their previous seats and sit in silence for a minute, quietly sipping their tea, Castiel admiring the array of colours in the room, trying his best not to linger on what looked
They arrived at the port shortly after. They were the first to disembark, their luggage already being put in a carriage by a servant sent to assist them. Before following Balthazar inside, Castiel allowed himself to look at his surroundings for a minute. His friend was right, the smell was most definitely just as bad as Dover, but he found he did not mind it at all. The bustle was uninterrupted by their arrival, which was a relief. Their arrival had not been announced in the papers to the country, something he had arranged himself. And so they boarded the carriage with no interference and were on their way to Versailles.
A sudden thought comes unbidden to Dior. The moment it takes life, his whole body comes alive with it, every centimeter lighting up in affirmation. His scent morphs into cinnamon that promises dessert. If Castiel really wants to help, this might be perfect. It’s - there’s no need for emotional entanglement that will drag and lock him down. It’s simple, so simple.
. He imagines how scared he must have been to go through his first heat alone, without the aid of another familiar face bringing him water, food and changing his beddings when needed.
, he thought. But just as he was about to open his mouth and try to rectify the situation, the alpha started speaking again.
How could you miss someone you haven’t ever met? Castiel feels like he had been missing this man his whole life - he just did not have the words to explain that longing until this moment. It feels like the green of his eyes had always popped into his dreams - only to be forgotten upon waking, but leaving behind this hopeless need.
“Okay, we’ll start with a few basic questions. Fragrance level?” Dean asks, shoving his hands in his pockets.
Castiel sighed and put him back into the baby carrier basket, making sure he had his bee sleep aid turned on. The boy clung to it immediately, burying his little head into the material and looking at his uncle with the most miserable eyes.
“I have no family,” he starts, easy as anything, not much different from how an actor would read from the script in rehearsals. “I was in a monastery orphanage until I was around fourteen - or fifteen. The nuns kicked me out because I refused to go to Sunday mass and pray every day. Though… it might have also been my stubbornness. And causing them problems daily.”
“We are free to leave whenever,” the omega explains, fiddling with his cup and looking around the room. “But if we leave we are penniless, unspoken for omegas in an alpha world. We’d have to resort to being nightwalkers-”
Castiel watched him go. He watched Dior make his way to the poker table, not sitting but standing in the middle of the players, hands gripping the edge of the furniture, his back arching out the smallest of amounts, buttocks suddenly more pronounced and alarmingly curved. He watched him dip down to many of the patrons’ ears, much like he had done to him. He watched him clap and shower praise when an infuriating alpha grabbed his waist in celebration for a sub-par billiards move.
Castiel turned towards his friend with his whole body and leaned in, patting his friend's knee fondly. "Thank you. I know. You must know there is no one I hold in higher regard than you, except for my blood family. I vow you, I shall try my best to be a most congenial companion."
His friend only sighs in response, scent calming down from lighting and thunderstorms to a midsummer rain. “Nevermind. You are simply incorrigible.”
By some miracle he makes it to his room in one, sweaty, heavy breathing piece, brings up the water on the dumbwaiter and fills his bath. He rummages desperately through one of his desk drawers, the box of scent-neutralising herbs almost slipping from his grasp. Fuck, he can’t
Dior’s brain stutters at the last word and he flinches at a phantom pain. The omega suddenly feels much too vulnerable and scrutinised under their gazes. He is perfectly fine. Dior’s not sure what that intense pain was about but it’s gone now and there’s no need to dwell on it. Especially not at the risk of missing a day’s work and losing time with his clients. It would be disastrous for his earnings and he can’t- Dior
Dior knows the doctor is simply jesting - it’s a running gag between them, proof of their familiarity. This time, however, the wording strikes him in an unexpected way. His feelings weren’t hurt and there’s no self-loathing floating at the back of his mind.
and he can feel his face redden in shame. He does not say that - despite his wolf insisting he is being a ghastly alpha for not praising his ‘mate’.
They hit town first, checking out the local shops and buying a few of bags filled with different decorations for the inside and outside of the house, plus for the tree. Castiel relented and bought an outdoor pack of fairy lights from Walmart - because what was Christmas without outdoor lights? He promised to himself he’d try to use them for as many years as possible.
Castiel has never been a man for light colours. He much prefers darker hues, black being the shade he has an affinity to - regardless of how much he has been told blue suits him better. If given a choice, white would not be high on his list of preferences.
and Castiel was comprehensively consumed by him. “Apologies are not necessary, my Lord. I am grateful to know you are unharmed. Were you on your way to the private parlour?” the man had inquired.
“Hi, yes - I’m actually looking for the tree nursery? I couldn’t find the entrance.” Castiel says, pushing his stroller closer.
The omega sits up straight, abandoning his earlier, comfortable looking position, his expression turning sharp, “You’ve been having them every day?”
Dior feels, rather than sees, her rolling her eyes. “Of course, Dior. You’re so selfish you don’t wake up an hour before everyone, prepare the bath, the food and make sure we’re up in time. How vile of you!”
Castiel was decidedly not on his way there, knowing what he does now about them, but he would follow this omega to the ends of the Earth. All he need do is ask, and he will receive. “I - Yes. I appear to have lost my way, to my great embarrassment,” he replied, chastising himself for talking before filtering his response. He did not want to be thought of as a lascivious alpha who looks to moisten their member as much as possible.
Castiel was tempted to glare their soul into the nether. Not for the first time, he wondered whether he had gone with the right nursery, seeing as none of their employees had any sort of sympathy towards a
The older woman shrugs her shoulders in a neat motion, “Mostly. We don’t have an omega wing, per se, but there are rooms allocated to these types of requests, of course. I don’t run a back alley inn, sugar,” she throws him an amused grin.
It’s a busy day, people walking up and down the streets, everyone looking like they’re on a mission. Dior wonders if he looks like that once he starts making his way towards the market.
Dior rummages in his wardrobe and manages to put together a more casual outfit consisting of dark grey trousers, a white shirt, suspenders, and a black thin coat. The coat will have to do - he doesn’t own any outdoor ones. It’s not an attire that screams ‘whore’ and it could also fool people into thinking he’s spoken for. He’s thinking back on one of the books
“You must know I would never let Tessa chastise you for my shortcomings, Hannah.” he replied kindly, gently grabbing one of Hannah’s hands in both of his. “Fear not, she will not find out and I would be incredibly grateful if you allowed me to assist you, at least with this.”
Her eyes are brimming with tears again and Dior swallows thickly. He wishes so badly he could tell her she’s wrong, that Crowley isn’t that much of a knothead, that he’d give her a job as their errand runner, that he’ll give her a wage -
“Will you be visiting me soon? I have missed our chess matches. Nobody is willing to learn back at the
Suddenly, he wasn’t excited about having true independence for the first time in his life anymore. He was suffocating with overwhelming homesickness, as if…
He closed his eyes and listened to the soft wind pushing against the glass of the windows, the crackling of flames in the fireplace across from his bed, and how his breathing seemed to echo in his muscles on every exhale. He will have to attend as many social functions and balls as possible, now. He was expected to form business relationships, build lasting friendships, praise his Kingdom and not be a disappointment, of course. Nevertheless, between them, there would be plenty of time for him to explore Paris - and maybe even neighboring cities - with Balthazar or just on his own.
The prince responds by taking a step closer to the bed, Dior’s heart skipping a beat. “Do you mean to go out again tomorrow night?”
The back door opened with a quiet creak and both of their heads turned toward it. Castiel heard his breath hitch.
He stared at the clear sky, a twisted satisfaction building in his stomach when thinking about how his parents would react to him visiting a Catholic cathedral. Not only to visit, but to
“My siblings?” he asks and when the other man nods, he continues: “I have four - three older brothers - two alphas and a beta - and a younger sister, also a beta: Michael - the oldest - followed by his twin, Lucius - but we call him Lucifer sometimes.”
. Castiel was a man of strong faith and often found solace in prayer. It made him feel less alone when he thought of the Lord and how He is ever-present in His children’s lives.
It’s been about three and a half years since he’d started working for Crowley and about two of being on the top floor. He’s had quite a few clients give him things along the years: creams, powders, herb jars, accessories, even rouge once… Along with a request of using the items on their next visit. It was always bittersweet - being given a gift but feeling like it was never really meant for
Dior feels like a jerk, suddenly. “It’s okay, I’m just - I’m just surprised,” he says, trying to soothe her nerves. She’s only been here a couple of months, he doesn’t want to spook her any more than she already is.
“That’s right, it's me,” the low baritone of his alpha’s voice soothing him, one hand stroking his hair, the other one peeling off the offensive red silk.
Being so close to Cas ignites Dior and he thinks he might be the one to combust next. All his nerves light up, goosebumps raising with every vocal roll of the possessive growl. His eyes slip closed when Cas buries his nose and mouth further into the crook of his neck, right between his scent and mating glands. The alpha never once averts his eyes from the intruders.
He comes across nobody as he navigates the hotel blindly, simply following his nose and his ears. The omega fails to notice anything and anyone, desperate to make his exit, as far away as possible from this nightmare.
,” Dior reiterates, his fingers having made their way to the hand Cas has on the sofa, next to his thigh. They stop their journey before skin can meet skin but the warmth Cas can feel coming from the man is encouragement enough to prompt his own fingers to move forwards and find the space between Dior’s, intertwining them without pulling away from the cushion.
The conversation halted when the kitchen maids started coming through with their breakfast, placing an impressive spread of sausages, eggs, vegetables, bacon, and pastries on the table, along with a few pots of tea.
Cain’s carriage to arrive. When he got to the estate early afternoon, there had been no guests there yet so he was instructed by the butler to sit in the parlour and make himself comfortable. Instead of doing that, he made sure the parlour was in order, all the entertainment ready, candles in appropriate positions and the bar well stocked. That didn’t take very long, and so he found himself shuffling awkwardly around the room before deciding to make his way to the main ballroom and offering help to the staff running about. They all seemed to be appreciative of his help, obviously panicked about tonight and under extreme pressure. Dior was happy to help, as it kept his own fear of disappointing and shaming the alpha at bay.
Castiel fit jack in the crook of his neck, gave him a dummy, gathered up his blanket, sleep aid, and teething ring - just in case - and then his own laptop. He laid down in his bed, back to the headboard, baby on his chest and laptop in his lap.
Caesar and Jesse are taken by surprise briefly before smiles begin creeping on their faces. “We’re from Mexico - Spanish is our mother tongue,” Caesar replies. “Do you speak any?”
When he opens them back up, he appears to have succumbed to the tiredness that settled deep into him without his knowledge - or perhaps refused to let himself acknowledge. He blinks blearly, eyelashes resting on his cheeks longer than they should.
TW/CW lower down but please do note that this might be my heaviest chapter yet. It's pretty much 12k of angst. It's angst even when it's comfort - that type of thing. I would like to pour ALL of the blame on ChaoticDean for always encouraging my angst-loving ass. So if by the end of this chapter you feel like punching or throwing stones at someone, please do it at her <3
“Yes - whatever is in trend, whatever colour works best for him. Accessories, too,” Castiel pays Dior’s protests no heed.
After Alastair took his ugly ass out of his room, Dior didn’t waste any time in getting himself clean. They weren’t lucky enough to have running hot water like other establishments but Crowley promised that business was good and another year of good revenue would enable him to do the necessary renovations. Dior counted the days on his fingers until then.
They assume the position they had taken the last time Castiel had been there, with one of them at each end of the sofa, one of Dior's legs tucked under himself, except this time there is no bare thigh exposed - just straining linen against the most splendid of legs.
Before the prince can embarrass himself, Dior’s hands come away with his scarf and just like that, the moment unburdens itself. Castiel blinks once, realising his eyes have turned misty, his legs gelatinous.
Dean looks down at the gently whirring machine with what could be a satisfied smile. “That’s so cool, man. I haven’t seen one of these before.”
He’s barely able to stand up but Princess Abbadon has him in a tight vice, bringing their faces close together. Dior’s gut rolls again once it catches a whiff of liquorice from her. She grabs both his cheeks in her other clawed hand.
“I have never seen something more enchanting,” he says quietly, affectionately. “I could sit and catalogue each and every one of them for hours on end, shall you ever allow me.”
Slightly flummoxed by this unexpected request, Castiel scrambles to take his coat off and then his hat, holding them awkwardly on his forearm, unsure how to proceed. Should he apologise? He cannot think what else he could do - the scent is cloying, heady, stirring the wolf within that Castiel had managed to placate.
He thinks of different, smaller hands gripping a bare belly. Of how they held on to protect and not to harm. He remembers the slight shake to them and the fierce, resigned eyes of their owner.
Secondly, I want to apologise for the lateness of this chapter. It was written and beta-ed already but I've had a couple of family losses these past couple of weeks and my fic completely blew out of my mind, thus making me forget to update. I'm really sorry about that.
Castiel draws a blank for a second, unsure whether his ears are failing him. Dior’s expression is coy.
Castiel was not aware that the purchasing of garbs usually demanded a written contract on top of a receipt of purchase - it seems an excessive measure for some garments.
The couturier is silent for a few seconds before he taps a finger on his husband’s knuckles twice, “Jesse.”
is that he truly was not put on this Earth for any other purpose than to be a good, little son to his parents, a loyal servant of his country - a common sentry with a common purpose and-
“Tell you what - I’ll take the silk and box but I’ve no need for the candy,” she says and Dior almost protests, “They’re very good quality - it’ll pay the difference, plus an extra week, honey. What do you say? Deal?”
This isn’t what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. But he didn’t know anyone who had tried leaving it and had neither ended back in or dead somewhere on the streets. There was also no way of him saving up any money. Seventy percent of his earnings went to taxes for being registered and the rest went to Crowley for his food and shelter. He didn’t even buy his own clothes. That, again, was done by Crowley and his secretary. There wasn’t anything he owned in this world. Not his furniture, not the clothes on his back, not even his own damn name. How fucking depressing was that?
There is no chance to say anything because they arrive at their destination and the omega wastes no time in folding the blanket with utmost care and placing it carefully in the storage under Castiel’s original bench. Castiel exits first and helps Dior out of the carriage, and both of them shiver at the sudden change in temperature. He does not expect it when the omega takes hold of his arm once again, slightly
Prince Castiel stepped around the chair, coming face to face with Dior. His heart was pounding in his ears with the alpha so close to him and having his undivided attention. He realised the Prince was a few centimeters shorter than Dior, giving him a lovely perspective of his face.
Her hair over his face when she undoes the ropes and turns him on his back. Her nails when they intentionally nick when putting on a new silk robe over his leaking shoulders and tightening the cord too much. Her smoking soul when she caresses his face with glacial words of ‘
