“And it’s same in the boardroom!” Pepper cried, she waved her glass and a little scotch sloshed over the right edge. “As if I need double Domosterone to run Stark Industries! It’s like I can’t let my guard down for even a minute!”
Steve took his mouth in a deep kiss, hard and heavy. He pulled Tony’s wrists closer together, so he could hold them both in one massive hand. Then, as they kissed, he pressed forward, bending Tony back and back—until for one jolting moment Tony thought he’d fall. But he didn’t. (Of course he didn’t.) Steve’s other hand was between his shoulder blades, holding him up. Tony relaxed into it; Steve moaned.
“There. Okay?” Tony murmured. “Sit tight, buddy. There.” Tony pet awkwardly at the claw, glad Rhodey couldn’t see him now. The scotch burned going down in the best possible way.
“Hey,” Steve said with a little smile as he stepped into the workshop.  Steve’s footfalls as he approached always seemed too quiet for such a big guy—super-soldiers were designed to be graceful and stealthy, apparently.  Or maybe Steve always had been. . . .
“Wait, wait,” Tony said, voice a little ragged.  He carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, then tightened his grip to keep Steve from moving forward again.  Steve knelt, hands bound, Tony’s cock still in his mouth, unable to move his head as Tony held him in place and continued talking:
“Before, you were doing it just because I’m a sub—at work and in front of our teammates—and you didn’t have my permission. It was—“
Steve stared blankly a moment, then looked horrified. “I wouldn’t! I didn’t even think of—” he stammered.
One of the spiders had leapt twenty feet into the air and wrapped its legs around him, squeezing. Its fangs slammed against the armor, looking for a join between helmet and shoulder. Tony’s flight went uneven with the sudden added weight.
“Okay, so, that’s JARVIS.  He runs the tower and is eyes and ears on everything.  I don’t just, like, sit around and watch the footage to spy on people or anything, but in the event of emergency we can call it up.  There’s a privacy mode you can use on your own floor, but anyway, I’ll go over that in more detail when everybody gets here.”
photo has been in my wallet ever since you showed it to me.” He cupped Steve’s face in his hands and kissed him tenderly. All Tony’s insecurities vanished in the face of Steve’s own. He pressed his forehead against Steve’s and whispered, “I’m in love with Steve Rogers. Not Captain America.”
Steve stared, blank and uncomprehending for a few long moments then repeated, “Nothing” with a slight upward lilt.
Tony started to leave, then paused for a moment. He turned back to gather up the delivery containers and put the leftovers in Steve’s refrigerator. It was practically empty: just some milk, a beer, and two glass bottles of Coca-Cola.
.”  It came out a rough whisper.  Steve wanted to inch closer on his knees, rub up against Tony like a cat.
“I’m sorry I lost my temper,” Steve whispered against Tony’s cheek.  He rubbed Tony’s back for a few minutes.  Eventually, he added with a sigh, “But we really do need to talk.”
“Yeah,” Bruce nodded, then gave an awkward smile. “Uh, if possible, I’d rather just be Bruce Banner, scientist. If I
Hill looked at Fury then back at them, and hastened to say, “Remember that your contacts require SHIELD approval for press releases and public disclosures. Failure to receive official approval would place you in violation of your contracts.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed.  “But from what I overheard—and by that I do mean ‘eavesdropped on’— it’s Fury and his minions’ who didn’t get it loaded.”
Steve stroked his hands up and down Tony’s back, then gripped Tony’s hips to pull him up closer for a warm, lazy kiss. Tony ran a hand over Steve’s chest, brushing his nipple, and opened his mouth, inviting Steve in, teasing with his tongue.
Tony could hear Steve singing along, ever so faintly under his breath as they moved across the dance floor.
Tony stepped away and threw his shoulder back, chin up.  “Every second of every day, every inch of my home is under video surveillance.  There is no privacy mode in my presence.  If you
After a long, lingering moment, Rogers took a step closer and accepted the glass. Tony poured them each a few fingers of scotch and clinked the crystal together. Tony raised his glass and fumbled around for a toast; Rogers waited, but made no suggestions.
—then phoned me in a panic at the last minute to call off the sale. And the way he used to talk about the Captain, when they first met—the guy sounded like a nightmare. I know Tony’s difficult, but that’s no excuse! Meeting him was hard on Tony. When Tony was a kid, it’s like he loved Captain America, and hated Captain America, and Captain America was the ultimate ideal Tony could never live up to. And now he’s
Soon the whole team was giving Steve a mini-history of pop music, calling requests out to JARVIS, and fact-checking wikipedia for disputed trivia. Potatoes were diced. Apples were sliced. Mrs. Rhodes’ orders were followed with prompt obedience.
Tony’s stomach gave a little lurch, part eager and part nervous.  (Was Steve about to get ambitious?) Steve kissed him again, his fingers carding through Tony’s hair. (What might he use?  Flogger? Paddle? Crop?)
“You did great,” Tony said softly. “You’re really amazing, you know that? We, ah, we’re lucky to have you on the team.”
“There are currently six restaurants with three stars in the area,” JARVIS replied. “You wish a reservation at each of them?”
“Did you have fun last night, Tony?” she asked. He nodded sleepily, clutching at his coffee. Natasha smirked. “Good. Also, your night out is trending on twitter.”
"The arrangements are already under way and, of course, we'll bring gifts for the Stark family: King Howard, Queen Maria, and their son, Crown Prince Anthony."
Obie had not been pleased.  And he’d oh-so-helpfully read all the worst of the news coverage and comment boards.
Tony worked on the new color e-ink displays. Pepper texted him reminders to eat and, when he didn’t answer, ordered delivery for him from that sushi place on Santa Monica he loved. It was good. He was making progress.
It annoyed Tony all the more that he was.  The way Rogers had said “you're Iron Man,” tone full of admiration, bordering on awe-- it had been such a shock that, without realizing it, he'd had the beginnings of a perception shift, a hopeful realignment. . .
Steve stuttered a little, grappling for the right word, but Tony’s mind was leaping ahead to supply possibilities. (“--charity case.” “–freeloader.” “–lazy bum.” Shit.) Tony blinked. (
“Mmm,” Tony murmured with approval, shifting against the headboard. He pulled at Steve’s shoulder, turning him until they were facing each other. “So.”
Steve shivered and realized abruptly he was hard in his pants. Tony’s body was so close they were almost touching all up and down, and Steve wanted it desperately, but feared that touch at the same time. (Not again, not again—you can’t. Not like last time.)
The elevator felt slow, even though he knew it wasn’t, and it took active effort not to pace the small space. When the doors opened the common room was dark except for the white lights on the tree they hadn’t taken down yet.
“And the electromagnetic radiation has actually decreased,” Bruce added, bringing up the old data points at the second console.
“I’m going to get you a book.  Maybe a couple.  They’re things I liked.  And I’ll get at least one written specifically for you—I mean, for submissives, so you won’t have to feel like you’re looking into the Dom’s Handbook without permission or something.  But please, Steve, please read the things I give you.”
“Uh, I’m going to go check the grounds,” Bruce said, still sounding a little off.  “I want to look at the force field from the other side.”
Tony smelled amazing.  Steve nearly groaned.  He closed his eyes and tried to think about something else.  Penguins.  Morgan Freeman.  Penguins.  Was Tony really dreaming about math and penguins?  Had he ever dreamed about sex with Steve?  About Steve sucking his cock?
loves this body.)  There was absolutely nothing to be shy about.  (And Tony just said he doesn’t expect some sort of
So, he'd hopped on his bike and headed to St. Michael's where he found Meredith tending the garden. The parishioners volunteered in turns to keep things in order and Steve was relieved to find something he could help with. He'd dug and planted and weeded with Meredith, did kitchen prep with Tom for dinner at the shelter, and helped Jon unload the latest donations. (And if the eighty-year-old noticed that Steve carried far more at once than even a fit twenty-five year old should be able to, he kindly didn't mention it.)
“You too, gorgeous,” Tony answered, then stopped his mouth with a kiss. He shifted to press his hip to Steve’s leaking dick.
Steve twitched. For a second, Tony thought Steve was going to reach up and hug him, or press his face to Tony’s stomach, but the moment passed.
For a minute (okay, maybe a few minutes, spread out over many days), Tony considered hacking SHIELD’s security cameras for another peek, but decided against it.  He’d seen enough of Captain America as a kid.
“Tony!” Steve stood frozen in the doorway, beautiful and awkward in his sharply tailored tuxedo. “You’re back.”
“Tony, I’m Bradford Johnson. I’ve been looking forward to speaking with you all evening.” He held out his hand. “If I may?”
In the drawing, a muscular man was kneeling naked with his wrists bound behind his back in thick, heavy loops of rope.  His legs were spread wide, his back to the viewer, giving an enticing view of the glorious swell of his ass, the elegant curve of his spine, the impressive expanse of his broad shoulders.  The man was situated in front of a mirror, so that his bowed head, flushed cheeks, and bedroom eyes were still visible, his gaze lowered.
exactly. Shit. If an SI employee had done that, Pepper would have thrown the book at him or her ages ago!  Strangely, though, Tony hadn’t
Eventually Tony headed to the workshop on the feeble excuse of work, but Steve hadn’t raised any objections and even said he “had a few projects to tie up too.”  (Tony hoped that maybe it was
Standing right in front of Steve, Tony slowly slipped his belt free of his trousers and wrapped the wide, supple leather loosely around his hand before shucking his trousers and kicking them aside.  Steve licked his lips.  Tony’s cock was hard and flushed, jutting from his body only a foot from Steve’s mouth.  He wanted to ask for permission to suck Tony’s cock, wanted to beg for another lesson, but he couldn’t bear to break the silence, so instead he just stared up at Tony.  Waiting.
“You’ve gone two years without an incident,” Romanov said to Bruce, stepping forward around Fury, “I’m sure you don’t want to break that record.”
Steve nodded. “This morning.” Tony bit his lip. (Shit! Did I tune him out and--) “He asked me to say goodbye; he hated to interrupt you when you were in the zone.” Steve gave him a kind of guilty look and pushed the plate of sandwiches closer. “Anyway, um, why don't you eat a few of these and I'll just, uh, leave you to it?”
The three were moving so fast Tony could hardly track the individual motions as they fought, apparently each one for themselves in an intense three way battle. It was never clear if they were being thrown or jumping away, but as they dodged, punched, spun and slid the sheer physicality of them all was staggering.
Tony pushed Steve’s head, a gentle pressure urging him down, and Steve moaned again, a loud noise muffled by Tony’s dick in his mouth.  Tony curled his fingers in Steve’s hair and pulled as he moved back up.  Steve worked the head with lips and tongue, sucking and lapping, until Tony (careful! careful!) pushed him back down his cock.  Tony could hear Steve breathing heavily through his nose.
’s what I get for telling sentimental stories,” Tony snarked, “I’m doing it more often.” He took a long sip of coffee.
And what did it say about Tony that simply kneeling and being petted threw him for a loop? More than it would have for Steve to grab him by the hair, push him to his knees, and growl, “Get down there and suck my cock. I want to come down your throat while you choke on it!”
coffee boy now?” Tony asked, still typing. “Does this mean you pick up the dry cleaning too? Are you the guy to call if I want donuts? ‘Cause I--”
I had a hard time figuring out what I thought 19 year old Prince Tony would be like, but now that I feel like I've got a handle on him I'm tempted to spend more time with these two...
Steve hastened to add, “Not that we didn’t go on some missions together and get along okay. I liked him fine--I did--but just . . .” Steve frowned. “I could never shake the feeling I was this fascinating experiment to him, proof of his genius. And he was so worldly and sophisticated and
Thanks so much for all your support!  I'm going through sort of a rough patch and sharing this story with you makes things a little bit better.  I'm very grateful for your kindness.
After a productive talk with Pepper about the StarkTab upgrade specs—mercifully undamaged by their time with lesser engineers—and brainstormed marketing—which Tony was good at, but found boring— they’d rung off with a promise to talk about something other than business soon.  Pepper ran to her next meeting and Tony returned to the common room.
“Well, I’m here for the magic touch,” Tony said, taking a seat. “Need to be camera ready and all that.”
Pepper sighed and leaned back in her chair.  She set her glass down.  “Fine.  I just—you two seemed to click on a level I’ve never seen you click with anyone.  When Bruce moved in and we were—“ she swallowed, “when there were just the three of us in the Tower, I’d come down to the lab and you would be working on something together and you looked so happy, speaking science to each other in your own little world.”  Pepper gave a little shrug.  “I had no idea you and the Captain had become so close.”
(Me? Fine.  Except, okay yeah, feeling guilty that I’ve been ignoring you even if I didn’t mean to—and, hey, progress!  I actually noticed that it had been . . . um?  two days?  three? . . . since I saw you.  This is huge!)
“Excellent. You were originally on the guest list as ‘plus one,’ but even after the attack they haven’t sold all the tickets and would love an extra bump. Their publicist asked if all the Avengers might be willing to attend as a group and, if so, if she’s allowed to leak that to the press.”
Startled, the girl on the other side of the restaurant hunched down, chastised, and put her phone back in her bag.  Tony couldn’t tell if she’d actually been taking a picture of him and Steve or if they would have been the blurry background for her friends.  Either way, Tony was tempted to salute Jake, but hated to draw any attention.
“NOOOOOOO!!!” the dragon roared, then shattered into little shards of light.  Tony blinked.  Natasha was hanging from one of the ceiling ropes where the dragon had been projected.
Steve gasped at the feel of Tony pressing a second finger against his rim, teasing him with it for a moment before pressing inside.  As Tony worked his second finger in, Steve felt a marvelously vivid sort of ache.  He threaded his fingers through Tony’s hair, wanting something to anchor him, something to do with his hands.  He pulled Tony down for a kiss.  This wasn’t like last time— the floating, there-not-there, held-everywhere feeling—but it was good, so good to have Tony’s fingers in his body, his tongue in his mouth, all hot and urgent and tremendously present.  Steve moaned.
“This?” Tony asked, shaking the paper cup. “I’ll be through this in no time. Just drop the mug on the hotplate, would ya, Steve?”
“Right,” Tony said.  “So, Bruce and I are gonna take our not quite enough data home to play with it.  JARVIS transmitted everything to the Tower already.”
“Steve, can you . . . can you tell me how you first discovered what you want?  I mean, before you told me and slid to your knees, you’d clearly thought about it a lot.  How did you get to that point?”
“What do you want, sweetheart?” Tony asked.  His slick finger went still, a light pressure at Steve’s entrance.
Thank you so much for your patience and support!  This chapter was a struggle to write, so if you liked this chapter or had a favorite bit, or maybe have nice or curious ramblings in response, I’d really really love to hear from you.  (I may write a meta about their scene on tumblr?)  Anyway, I really hope you liked it. *blushes, stammers, hides*
Tony frowned at the current equations for the Security Blanket. And, okay, it was strong and it was stretchy, but if it was
Tony was a little surprised when, instead of tossing him onto the bed, Steve set him on his feet beside it then sat down.
Tony tossed on a pair of black jeans and a tanktop, then grabbed the hoodie he’d been wearing earlier. He gave it a sniff as he walked down the hallway.  (Meh.  Good enough.)   He shrugged it on, preparing to launch himself at Rhodey as soon as the elevator doors opened—he stopped short.
Rogers opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again, expression anxious.  After some invisible struggle, Rogers slumped a little.
Steve set the book aside, fumbling a little in his haste, and it fell to the floor with a dull thud.  Steve leapt from his seat and began to pace.
“Mmm,” Tony mumbled absently.  (Shithead douchbag . . . should hack in and have him CC Fury on the betting chain. . . . Nah, Fury’d probably laugh.  Maybe scramble the guy’s access card, let it malfunction and leave him in one of their interrogation rooms . . .)
Tony gave an experimental little wriggle.  Steve took a sharp breath when Tony brushed his still-hard cock.  Tony perked up, feeling steadily more alert.
Tony shook his head laughed, at least partly with sincere amusement. “At least he saved me from some hideous cotillion. I’d have hated it. So, there’s that.”
“I know SHIELD got off on the wrong foot with you,” Fury began. Tony snorted and Fury glanced up at him for a moment with a wry look.
“No, no, I think they’re fine,” Steve said, frowning down at them. “And the bacon should be good. You ready for food? I was about to call the team, but I’m not above giving my fella special treatment.”
Steve grinned. “Deal,” he said, with a brisk nod and turned to go. “See you soon!” he called over his shoulder.
“Okay then, I’m calling it!” Clint said. “Everybody back to the Ranch Mansion. I won, so I get hot chocolate first.”
Tony grinned. They were (mostly) distracting him from the churning in his stomach. (SHIELD food—it gave you indigestion
As Steve reached down to undo Tony’s belt, he wondered if it was actually getting a little too warm.
“Oh, hey, listen to this,” Clint called, turning back to the paper and reading out: “’Ms. Romanov was dynamically sublime in a curve-hugging Versace gown; the emerald satin V-neck paired beautifully with her auburn hair to give her the air of an exotic flower.’ Hear that, Nat? You’re dynamically sublime. You know, like an exotic flower or some shit.”
“Oh! I thought I was just taking you out to dinner because we’re friends and I’m terribly fond of you. Good to know that my motives are more altruistic.”
“Pretty good,” Tony said with a shrug.  “We’re just getting started.  I want Bruce to let go; it’ll be good for him and for the team.  Hulk’s a force to be reckoned with--will be a real asset.  But we have to get past Bruce’s walls first.”
Tony felt certain Rogers wasn’t being straight with him, but it didn’t seem like Tony could press the point since Rogers was right—Clint and Natasha
Tony waved a hand. “You can get anything if you know the right people. Or if your people know the right people.”
Steve wrapped strong arms around Tony from behind, pressing his chest to Tony’s back.  “Hey, sweetheart,” Steve murmured softly.  He pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple and nuzzled a little against his neck, then he rested his chin on Tony’s shoulder, just holding him.  They were silent a few moments.
Up in the kitchen, they threw together a heap of sandwiches and dug in, devouring them in companionable silence. Clint grabbed his tablet; Tony checked messages on his phone.
(Say it!  Go on . . . Is it okay to have him move?  Yeah, he’d probably like it.  Okay.  Here we go.)
Steve told Tony about his tactical analysis of their battle with the Doom and Gloom Grad Bots.  Tony told Steve about his ideas for upgrading Widow’s weaponry.  They argued about Bond movies.  (And of course Steve likes Daniel Craig’s Bond—the one with *feelings.*  He’s James Bond for God’s sake!  He doesn’t do feelings.)  Little by little, Steve’s uneasiness diminished but, now that Tony knew what he was looking for, he could tell it was never fully dispelled.
Tony gasped again and with a jolt Steve finally recognized those noises: Tony was touching himself.  Tony was stroking his cock while looking at Steve prostrate at his feet.  Steve shivered.
Thanks so much for reading!  I couldn't possibly do Jon Stewart justice--I love that guy, and so much of it is vocal inflection and facial expressions--but I couldn't resist trying anyway.  :-)
let somebody else’s opinion or the press or anything else stop him from doing exactly what he wants?”
“Good thing you don’t seem to mind going backwards,” Steve said with a grin.  “First date after first—“ he hesitated, glancing around, “-- *other things.*”  Steve took a sip of his beer then set it down suddenly.  He leaned forward.  He was blushing but mostly just looking curious as he asked: “Tony, do you think I’m still a virgin?”
Steve nodded and looked at Tony’s crotch with new concentration.  He palmed Tony’s balls assertively, a little too hard for a moment, before easing up.
At the first touch of Tony’s hand on his cock, Steve cried out and came, whimpering and shuddering, his ass clenching tight on Tony’s fingers.
Tony tried to land on the damn thing full force, hoping to squash it. It rolled out of the way at the last second-- he missed its body and landed on its legs instead. The exoskeleton cracked and blood oozed forth; the thing chittered. Two of its remaining legs shot out and wrapped around Tony, pinning his arms to his chest. It squeezed. Tony shot one of his miniature shoulder missiles at it, but couldn’t get the angle right for a repuslor blast.
(Bullshit.) Tony pivoted and stepped around him, getting between Steve and the patch of rug he’d been staring at, forcing himself into Steve’s gaze.
Tony fiddled with his fork, running mental calculations.  Interpersonal calculations, the kind of calculations Tony wasn’t good at.  (And if ever you needed proof that subs aren’t naturally more socially and emotionally perceptive than their Dom counterparts, well, here he is!)  He’d run all these calculations before, had a mental list of data points: that 17%; the distance between them on the couch; going to Mass in
Tony’s eyes were prickling again.  (Absurd! Steve hadn’t even started . . . whatever it was he’d tied him up for.)
“You always want a hot dog,” Natasha said, startling Tony as she appeared from nowhere behind him.  He glared at her; she shrugged.
“Oh, nothing much.” Rhodey shrugged, then continued, faux-casual, “But, hey, since you ask . . . well, I was thinking Thanksgiving’s not that far off and I’ve got a leave coming, so I might come to New York.”
“I’m good,” Tony repeated, smoothing out the suit, then asking (suddenly remembering his manners), “How are you?”
“Good,” Steve repeated as they started following the others. “Would you believe that was my first snowball fight?”
DUM-E bumped up against Tony's thigh like a demanding house cat and Tony realized that he'd been standing around with the blow torch running, staring into space and he'd forgotten what he'd been working on.  With a disgusted little noise, Tony shut it off and set it aside.   He pet DUM-E's claw absently.
Tony gave Steve a hard look and then a smile spread over his face. He came closer and fluttered his eyes coquettishly.
“Yes!  Yes, sorry.  I can go now.  Or, do I need to change?”  Tony went on before Steve could answer, “JARVIS, save and close all this.  So, wait, where are we going and what should I wear?”
Tony stroked his chest, teasing his nipples.  He kissed his way down Steve’s body, making him gasp and jerk, as he reached for something at the end of the bed.  Tony came back with a pair of padded leather restraints.  They had heavy metal buckles and a thick metal hoop in the middle.  He held them up for Steve to see.
“So,” Tony said, “I’ll slow down and instead of grabbing you, I’ll grab the shield.  So get a good grip on it, Cap, one that won’t break your arm.”
“I’ll be good to you,” Steve said. He ran his hands up and down Tony’s back and pressed a kiss to Tony’s hair. “Gonna be so good to you, sweetheart. Always.”
“Dude, that doesn’t mean he’s not gonna pour, I dunno, chocolate, flowers, jewelry, and probably some super thoughtful, meaningful crap in your lap. Isn’t that what Dom’s are supposed to do?”
Steve opened his mouth to speak, but then Tony was kissing him, licking at his lips and pressing his tongue inside.  Steve moaned into Tony’s mouth.  Tony took hold of Steve’s hip and set up a slow, rocking motion, thrusting and rolling. His tongue fucked in and out of Steve’s mouth, fingers curling tight around the back of Steve’s neck.  Steve fumbled awkwardly under the covers, yanking at Tony’s sweatpants, desperate for skin on skin.  Tony wiggled his hips obligingly and soon they were cock to cock, hard flesh and velvety skin all slickened with pre-come.  They were both panting.  Roll and thrust, roll and thrust.  Push, pull, push, pull.  The moments melted together.  Roll, thrust, push, pull.
“There used to be this amazing chocolate cake,” he said, glancing down at the menu again, “but I don’t see it.”
It was good. Working with Bruce was good. At least, it was after he let Tony name the project ‘Operation Security Blanket’ and swore a few more times that he hoped they wouldn’t need it and had (at least some) faith in The Actual Plan.
And here's an example of a Northern Renaissance chaperon; I’d frankly love to see Tony Stark wearing this!: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperon_(headgear)#/media/File:Portrait_of_a_Man_by_Jan_van_Eyck-small.jpg
Tony shrugged.  “I never thought about it much.  For me, it happened all at once, so I never wondered about shades of virginity.”  Steve raised his eyebrows, obviously curious, so Tony continued.  “It was a party at MIT.  I was drunk and sixteen, got kissed and got laid all on the same night.”  He smiled a little ruefully.  “What can I say, I was a teenager—it was over pretty quickly.”  Tony frowned.  “Mary?  Steph?  Who knows, but I’m pretty sure she was a biochemistry major.”
“He was like my brother.  We did everything together and he did his best to look after me. I was a mess most of the time.”
“He was a real tough talker, Bucky, sharp-tongued and we’d give each other hell.  Rough housed too-- he always took it easy on me, but pretended not to.  I was frail then, you know, and too proud for my own good.”  The noise Steve made was half-chuckle, half-choking.  Steve shook his head.  “The scrapes we got into!  But Bucky always got us out. . .”
“Good boy.”  Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck.  “Don’t move.”  And then the warmth of Tony’s body withdrew and Steve could hear him walking away, crossing to the other side of the workshop.
“Steve, sweetheart,” Tony said, still at a loss for words.  He gave Steve a hug and took a deep breath.  “Come on.  Let’s not do this huddled at my bench, yeah?  Let’s at least go sit on the couch.  Come on, baby.”
“She does sound pretty great, though, and I’m hard to please,” Tony admitted with a rueful smile. “Apparently she’s a military historian at Columbia. She read Rhodey’s Masters Thesis on the Tuskegee Airmen and wrote him a letter about it so they started nerding out about history and media representation and stuff. Apparently, she only just realized he’s The James Rhodes, as in War Machine, so it’s not like she’s just into the celebrity or whatever. So, uh, yeah. Anyway, looks like Rhodey’s coming for Thanksgiving to see his girl, and his mom’s coming too.”
“--wanna get to my run,” Cap was saying. “I’ve sort of got a new running buddy and I don’t want to miss him.”
“I can’t figure Rogers out,” Tony eventually blurted out, rudely cutting off Pepper’s description the new Klimt exhibit at LACMA.
“Shhh,” Tony murmured, trying not to panic.  (What the hell?)  “It’s okay. . .  Whatever it is, it’s okay. . . I’ve got you . . .”  Tony kept his left arm firmly around Steve’s waist, trying to anchor him, while with his right hand he kept caressing Steve’s neck and hair.
And now the musicians’ break was apparently over. As Tony finished off his scotch and discarded the glass, they shuffled back on stage and leafed through their sheet music. Tony was suddenly aware of just how close to Steve he was standing, but he didn’t step away. The band began to play a slow, loping waltz and the dance floor began to fill.
Tony didn’t actually know all that much about Moroccan cuisine or Steve’s taste so he just ordered most of the menu and, when Steve tried to protest, pointed out that the whole team would enjoy the copious left-overs and, no, of course he wouldn’t let any food go to waste.  (Besides, Steve could probably eat half of what Tony ordered himself considering his super-metabolism.)
“Thanks.” Tony paused. (JARVIS would have said something if anyone else had tried to visit, right? Right. No need to ask.) Tony took a sip of coffee, then asked, “And Steve?”
“Everybody should get to pick out some ornaments for the tree,” Steve said, with the tone of man repeating himself. (Or a patient dad.)
Steve continued, his voice stronger, more confident: “Tony, I love you—no matter what—and you don’t have to do all this for me to make me want to be with you.  I just want to make you happy.  If this doesn’t make you happy, I don’t want it.  I
“Tony?  How’s it going?” Steve asked, voice concerned.  “I, uh, ran into Pepper and she filled me in a little.  It sounds really rough.”  Steve shuffled his feet, looking down bashfully. “I know there’s really nothing I can do to help on the engineering end, or the legal end, or the PR end, or really help in any way at all, but, um, I got you pizza.”  He smiled and held out the box.  “I went to Piaci.  I got you the one with lettuce you liked so much.”
“Mr. Stark,” Katie Winters began briskly, “you know it’s much easier for Michael and me to do our job when you return our phone calls. Or emails.”
Steve kissed his way up Tony’s body, caressing his thighs, hips, sides, chest with lips and hands as Tony laid spent and shuddering beneath him. Steve pulled a blanket over them both, holding Tony in his arms and nuzzling his neck.
Steve smiled for a moment, but a glance at the pile of papers dimmed his smile. “I’d better keep studying.”
.  Hell, she hadn’t necessarily been asking him on a date!  (Yeah, she had.)  Steve frowned.  (Okay, yeah, pretty sure she had.  But whatever.)
“It’s too late in the day to start our main training plans,” Steve said consideringly. “And we should probably ease into our—“ he considered his words for a moment before settling on “first encounter.” He turned to Bruce and added, “Don’t you think?”
have overstated the atheist anti-Christmas thing to Rhodey. Just a bit. But Christmas with the Rhodes is so full of strangers! And this big thing! With all these traditions and lots of Church and stuff. So, uh,
Steve could feel a trickle of water easing down his throat (relaxed, open), but he swallowed half-way through his tiny mouthful.  (It
“Sam,” she said, a little breathlessly, “I had no idea you’d bring me a present home from the gala.” She turned to Tony playfully, “You are for me, aren’t you?”
(“Is that a threat or a promise?” Tony’d asked with a smirk.  “Or both.  ‘Cause I’m insatiable.  I could take you, one right after another, right here on the ballroom floor . . .”)
Tony smiled. (Good man, JARVIS.) Steve was still sleeping on Tony’s work couch, lips slightly parted. He’d been even more exhausted than Tony’d realized. (And, really, the super soldier serum must be the only reason that Steve hadn’t had the most massively hideous dark circles under his eyes. Terribly unfair really.) Steve’s chest rose and fell deeply in a steady rhythm. (He looks so young.) A few more files had fallen from the couch as Steve shifted in his sleep.
Tony gave a wry smile. “Dunno, some of those society types are worse than aliens.” He laughed. “Trust me—I know. I’m one of them.”
“Thanks, J!”  Tony turned to Bruce, trying to hold in his relief.  He aimed for an apologetic expression. “Well, I’d better go start getting ready!  You can stay here and work a little longer if you like. I’ve just got some other stuff to wrap up.”
Tony bit his lip. He wanted to drop his head, tilt it to the side and look up at Steve through his eyelashes—it required active effort not to do something that felt not only natural, but
“I’d love that,” Steve said, then asked in a low tone, teasingly formal, “May I have the honor of escorting you home?”
lived here?”  Rogers gave a little nod.  “Aw, that’s cute, but nope.  This is your floor.” Rogers looked uneasy, so Tony added, “But don’t get your equality-loving undies in a twist—no preferential treatment.  Bruce and the ninjas each have a floor too.”
“Captain Rogers,” she said in that scrupulously polite voice she used with him. She turned around with a pinched smile, makeup immaculate.  (Maybe he’d been wrong. Or maybe women like Ms. Potts could cry without mussing their paint.)
“Mr. Stark,” Rogers said, brisk and composed, “I’d be happy to give you individual combat training if you’d like."
Rhodey’s brows were furrowed, expression pinched—part worry, part anger—as he asked, “He didn’t . . . try and pull anything, did he?”
Tony froze, then turned to give him a curious look.  Steve flushed with embarrassment.  (Pathetic—so desperate for a little human contact you make it sound like a call to assemble. He’s busy, stupid.  He’s not lonely and he probably doesn’t care about Christmas.  Or you.)  They stood staring for a few long moments.  Steve looked away first, preparing to apologize—though what for he couldn’t exactly say.  (For asking you to spend time with me?  For not wanting to be entirely alone on Christmas?  For offering you cocoa when you’ve just told me you want coffee?)
He could hold his own, but there was no sense pretending he was on her level.  Nat was a demon hand-to-hand.
“There are lots of ways to get wounded,” Tony said, finally summoning some of those phrases he hadn’t needed in years. (Phrases he’d learned for Rhodey.) “There are lots of types of wounds, on the battlefield and off. Pain while you’re healing, even chronic pain, doesn’t make you weak, no matter the type of wound.”
“I’ll just rock my usual flawless tux, red and gold details. No need for something new.” He rubbed his cheek, leaving grease in his goatee. He’d catch it later. “Maybe new accessories, though. We’ll figure it out later.”
“You’re beautiful, Tony,” Steve told him. It did something funny to Tony’s stomach and he suddenly felt too warm.
Tony tuned him out.  It hardly mattered. He was here now. (And if it was miserable, he had contingency plans for escape.)  He wrapped himself in a heavy fur cloak and emerged once more.
having a career and wouldn’t see it as a burden. Somebody fierce and independent, who’da been glad I wasn’t the kind of Dom who’d insist he quit if we got married.” Steve’s voice was soft, almost reverent, “Somebody who’d
“I dunno,” he said, shaking his head as scanned the results. “It looks like it sacrifices too much strength. Unless—“
“Don’t you think,” Nat asked in a wry voice, “we could make an exception to the ‘quiet on the comm’ policy while
And there was really no point denying it, so Tony gave a tight little nod, still not meeting Steve’s gaze.
At exactly 3:59, Steve stepped into the pub, blinking as he adjusted to the dim light. A voluptuous redhead in a beautifully cut green dress approached him immediately with a slight smile. She extended her hand and greeted him in a deep voice: “Good afternoon, Mr. Rogers.”
Tony stepped out of the elevator and into Steve’s suite.  All the lights were off, except for the little safety lights in the hall and by the elevator—not that Steve was likely to trip in the dark and sue Stark Industries, but whatever…  Tony padded quietly down the hall to Steve’s bedroom.  Steve usually shut the door before bed, but tonight it was open.  Tony hovered in the doorway.
And if there was something wet against Tony’s neck, seeping into the collar of his shirt, they didn’t say anything about it.  Tony just kept giving Steve slow, firm caresses he hoped were reassuring.  The elevator had long since reached the garage.
Tony worked frantically—finally, finally making progress and absently devouring the pizza Steve had brought him slice by slice every twenty minutes or so.
Steve sighed. Day three of Tony's engineering isolation had dawned bright and beautiful, but Steve had felt a certain uneasy melancholy. When Steve went down to the lab with breakfast, he'd found Tony slumped across his workbench, drooling slightly on his arm as he slept. The dark circles under Tony's eyes looked a sickly blue in the light of his glowing schematics-- dozens upon dozens of them floating all over the shop. Steve had never seen so many at once. He knew better than to wake his lover when he finally nodded off, so he'd just left the sliced apples and buttered toast with a hastily scribbled “Food is fuel! Please eat. Love, Steve.”
Bruce was good.  Great, really.  They did Science together and, although the Dom lacked Tony’s science stamina—something Tony commented on loudly and often—it was good. At first Tony was pissed that Bruce kept dragging him to the team bonding stuff, but once he realized that it wasn’t a “Tony, come do your duty to this team!” thing and more of a “Tony, you’re the person I trust and new people are scary—help me!” thing, Tony found he didn’t actually mind.
“I told her about the monument,” Pepper told him gently, then a little amused, added, “she liked the idea of a fountain best.” Pep shook her head. “Told you a statue was . . . too much.”
The hostess’ eyes went wide for a split second, then her features smoothed out into a polite smile as she said, “Of course, sir. Please follow me.”
Tony flipped his sunglasses up and grinned at the Agent on duty. (Geeze, are they recruiting kids now? He barely looks 19...)
When the clock ticked 7:30, Steve immediately set aside the book he’d been pretending to read.  (Face it Rogers, you’ve been daydreaming all day.)  Normally, he’d give Tony fifteen minutes of leeway before showing up—he hated to look impatient—but right now he’d waited as long as he could.   He’d taken a ridiculously long time in the shower and picking out his clothes—a fitted blue button down and black trousers Tony had given him—and then he’d just had to
Tony washed his hands, splashed some water on his face, and dried off with a hand towel, grateful to have the washroom to himself. He was just deciding whether to guarantee his privacy by stepping into a stall, make himself at home for a few minutes in the decadent lounge area, or return to the gala—the door swung open.
“I’ll take the subway,” Steve said, “and I borrowed a dolly for the presents. Mr. Thompson—he works in custodial for SI—was very helpful.”
And Tony really really wanted to ignore him, but he found himself looking up without entirely meaning to.  “Yeah? What?”
Tony turned to Steve with a wry smile.  “Little mishap in the shop.  One of my robots and, really, can’t work without coffee, ya know?”  Steve nodded.  “Top secret Avengers gear—work in progress.  Will tell you all about it later if it works.  Which it will, ‘cause I’m a genius.”  He gave Steve a wink, then gathered the coffee machine in his arms and started towards the elevator.
Rogers seemed almost nervous.  He hesitated a moment, then asked, the words formal and precise: “Mr. Stark, may I have the honor of calling you Anthony?”
Jackie raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. “And since when are you such a prude, Tony Stark? I’ve never seen you to hesitate to verbally drool over the celebrity Dom with the best butt and prettiest tits.”
“Not bad,” Cap said, releasing him with an approving nod. “Next time, though, wait a little longer. Using your body weight to advantage is a good idea, but if you do it too soon, I can maneuver around it. Okay? Now, again”
Tony intended the gesture and formalities to be playfully extravagant, but his heart started hammering in his chest the moment the words left his lips. Tony stayed in a slight bow, hand outstretched, as he looked up at Steve with a smile and slightly raised eyebrow.
“Nah, just some of it,” the Captain says. “Bruce is a good cook; better than me. And we’re all connesours of an array of take out joints.”
Tony fiddled absently with the wrench he’d been using on the Security Blanket and glared at the screen.
) As Tony pushed inside with a second finger, for a moment there was resistance, an almost burn, but then Steve pushed back and the two fingers slid in without difficulty.
Steve looked away, expression hard and voice harsh. “I’ll come here and be polite and drink and make small talk, because it’s the right thing to do and I want to help, but I’m not gonna sing and dance on command.” He took a sharp breath. “I’m not a performing monkey, not anymore; left that behind with the USO tour. They can’t just . . . Just . . .”
Comments and musings are a delight, and if there are any particular bits that you especially liked I’d love to know what they were!  (As you know, I find negative concrit paralyzing, but I learn a lot by hearing what your favorite parts are…)
Steve had worried he might startle them, but he should have known better.  Natasha had clearly heard him coming.  “Morning, Cap.”  She threw back the last of her coffee, taking it like a shot, and put the mug in the dish washing machine, then sauntered towards the exit.  “Better get a move on, Clint.  Can’t keep Hill waiting.”  Clint grimaced and finished his coffee.  Natasha nodded to Steve as she passed.  “Have a good day, Cap.”  Clint slapped him on the shoulder and said, “See ya,” as he followed Natasha out.  Steve wanted to call after them, to ask if maybe he should come too, if they were going on a mission, what he could do to help.  But he didn’t say a word.  He picked Clint’s mug up off the kitchen island, washed it, and put it away.
“Thanks, J.” Tony swallowed the pills with small, careful sips of water. He took stock of himself. A bit hungover, but all in all not so bad; he was pretty sure it wouldn’t show today. And in the end it was nothing a little time and a few pills couldn’t cure.
And if Steve’s eyes were bloodshot when he came back from the bathroom, Tony wouldn’t dream of mentioning it.
Steve would never put on a dirty uniform. Which meant he’d never taken it off. (And Steve’s hair wasn’t fluffing up at the back the way it usually did; actually, it looked kinda greasy.)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tony observed Steve out of the corner of his eye, still watchful for some sign of disapproval about his antics the previous night, though he was no longer bracing for a direct remark. But next to him, Steve just kept smiling, every now and then casting Tony this soft little look that Tony didn’t know what to do with.
“I know there’s nothing going on,” Steve said.  “You’re my fella and I trust you. Of course I do.  But I still felt . . .”   Steve trailed off with a melancholy shrug.
“I’m glad,” Steve said haltingly. “That was-- I dunno. Harder and easier than I was expecting, if that makes sense?” Tony nodded and squeezed his hand. “Stephen was easy to talk to. And I knew you’d be watching.” He shook his head. “I’m glad to be done.”
. . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A search for “War Machine Iron Man portal New York” gave him over eleven-hundred hits, many of them video. Tony hit play.
“Good fight, Iron Man,” Rogers said seriously.  Only Captain America could seem dignified in a spangly outfit like that.
Tony probably wasn’t blushing—it was just hot in the shower, right? He slid gracefully to his knees.
. (Does Steve even know what that is?  Okay, he must—he looked it up online, right?  And that is an amazing thing to imagine-- hot and hilarious all at once.  Bet his eyes bugged out...) Tony closed his eyes and took deep steadying breaths.
. . . that he wouldn’t go into subspace and they weren’t allowed to try and put him under. He didn’t necessarily say he
“That’s sweet.  And bullshit, asshole, but sweet bullshit so whatever.  Fine, I’ll fix the damn suit.  But I’ll take my time about it.”  Tony hesitated.  “I’ve missed you.  It’ll be good to catch up.”  (Steve!  Tell him about Steve!)  Tony shook himself.  “Good repairs are meticulous!  So no hurrying in and hurrying out!”
Berber Café was a riotous explosion of patterns and colors, from the intricate rugs and floor cushions to the delicately carved tables and vivid wall panels.  Bright reds and blues, creams and golds, illuminated by oil lamps, and an open fire. (There are electric lights too, of course, but they’ve created the illusion of candle light expertly.)
Flipping through the book, reading snippets here and there, Steve had been getting an understanding of how much
Steve’s hands closed around his wrists and pulled Tony’s hands down away from his belt. Steve shook his head, his expression serious.
“Oh, now I know you’re spoiling for a fight!” Steve exclaimed jokingly.  He took a sip of his beer and hummed in satisfaction.
Steve rolled his hips and rocked back onto Tony’s finger.  Tony let out a strangled noise, but just kept slowly pulling out and pushing back in with one finger.  (Not enough . . . more . . . more. . . )
Steve raised his head to give Tony a blank look for a moment before looking a hint concerned. He hesitated a moment before asking, “What?”
“And just so we’re clear, this is for me, Steve.”  Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck then whispered, hot and rough into Steve’s ear: “Spread your legs.”
Steve shivered.  He wanted Tony.  All of him, everything, and he definitely wanted sex with Tony.  Wanted it fiercely, desperately, urgently.  Steve wondered distantly if he was guilty of the sin of lust, but the idea couldn’t hold his attention.  (Love—it’s
“I need to tell you something. I probably should have told you sooner.  It’s not that I don’t trust you, it’s just something I’ve had to struggle with.”
“Aww, don’t be such a spoilsport!” Clint took a long chug of orange juice and began again, “Best for last—‘Clint ‘Hawkeye’ Barton, looking dashing in a custom Gucci tuxedo, greeted fans and guests on the red carpet with the ease and charm of a practiced entertainer.’ Wait? That’s it? No simile? This is bullshit. I’m cancelling my subscription! I mean—“
On the ride back to the Tower, Tony could barely focus on Natasha and Clint’s amiable chatter. All he could think about were Steve’s ardent kisses. The pressure of his strong hands circling Tony’s wrists. The warmth radiating from his body. The intoxicating smell of his skin. (Don’t blush!)
“Cap’s floor, JARVIS,” Tony said frowning, then remembered his manners, “Oh, uh, ask him if I can drop by, would ya?”
Back at the tower--looking fabulous but still feeling a little like a plucked chicken--Tony went down to the workshop. He’d resisted the temptation to dye the grey at his temples, but had come away a little conflicted about it. (Well, the temptation to dye
“You asked me to keep an eye on Cap,” Tony blurted. “I don’t think I’ve been doing a very good job. I maybe need your help.”
“Riddles,” Steven said with another shrug.  “Dragons love riddles. And they take oaths very seriously.  I talked her into a battle of the mind; and if I won, she’d cease to ravage our land and instead protect us from invaders.  She’s welcome to eat any invading armies that may come to our shores.”
“Of course, Mr. Stark,” Katie said briskly. Another pause, then more softly, “People don’t know half the good you do.”
Steve wanted to smack him for asking and snap, 'none of your business,' but he'd asked for more details and it was clearly relevant.
Tony chuckled. Jackie launched into a riff on Madonna and ‘sexy Jesus’ and Tony was glad to have everything back to normal. (And Captain America banished from the conversation.)
Tony took a deep breath and tried to focus, isolate the problem.  Was it just the aggregate, or had he crossed a specific boundary he hadn’t realized, touched an unexpected trigger.  Had something reminded Steve of trauma from his past?  They sure as shit both had enough traumatic events in their pasts for that to be a serious possibility. . . But wouldn’t Steve have used his safeword?  Maybe he forgot his safeword?  Was he so deep he went non-verbal and couldn’t remember what he needed to do to get free?  But he could have pulled free easily—
“Hey Steve?” Tony said tentatively, glancing over to where Steve was shading something with a red colored pencil.
“Four!” Tony cried. “How did it get so late? Crap. Uh, yeah. Tell him I’ll be down in five. No! Fifteen. Tell him fifteen. There’s something I need to finish up first.”
He was fine. He should have known something like this would surface eventually. Tony’d put it in every contract he’d written since . . . since
Steve leapt up. “Would you excuse me for a minute?” he said to Rhodey, then called out after his fella, “Tony!”
Tony held the door open for Rhodey silently, then they made their way over to the couch.  Rhodey laid his crutch aside and lowed himself down very carefully onto the cushions, then eased his right leg up onto the coffee table. The late afternoon light flooded the glass-paneled section of the terrace.  (Not a traditional sunroom, but whatever—it has a great view of Iron Man’s landing strip.)
calls me Anthony.   Second, what the fuck? Who asks that anymore?”  Tony looked at the man suspiciously.  “You on a first name basis with Barton?”
There was a time Tony would have chuckled at that or said “Hurry up, stud, it’s not rocket science.”
The team split up to do their duty and mingle—after all, that was why they were there. Not just PR for the Avengers, but to help boost fundraising for The American Association for Homeless Outreach.
“Yep! Unless Bruce changed his mind, which seems unlikely. I wasn’t expecting him to be so excited about it, but he seemed pretty pleased.”
.)  Waves of relief coursed through Steve and he felt a sense of distant surprise at their intensity.  (I did well.  I got it right.)  Steve flushed with pride.
Of course, that had all stopped when Tony presented as a sub at thirteen.  Howard ran the blood tests three times himself, then hired an expert for a second opinion before admitting his son was no Steve Rogers.
“Do you now?” Steve asked and, next thing he knew, Steve had flipped him over and pinned him in the snow with a grin.
Steve pulled back and added, “Don’t see how Artist or Lawyer or Social Worker Steve would have ever met gorgeous billionaire genius philanthropist Tony Stark, but it means a lot to know you think they’d have gotten on anyway.”
The concrete floor was hard and cold, its texture rough against Steve’s bare skin.  He could hear Tony opening cabinets and rummaging around, but figured he shouldn’t be trying to guess what Tony was up to or what he was planning.  (Tony’s in control.  Just stay still.  Be good.  “
Steve had carried Tony to bed before—first, with pity and concern when Tony was blackout drunk and stinking of vomit; later with a certain resigned affection after another of Tony’s benders; and a few times after that when Tony had been wounded in battle, the suit rendered inoperative.  Once, Tony had been unconscious.  Steve’s heart had pounded with panic and he’d held Tony at an awkward angle to keep his chest visible so he could check the light of the arc reactor every few steps to make sure Tony was still with him.
“Yes, of course,” Steve said. He was surprised to find her in the Tower. (Or willingly talking to him—their last interaction had been far from cordial.) “What can I do for you, ma’am?”
“The Captain is frustrated, sir.” Another pause. “With some of the material and the gaps in his knowledge. I believe he finds it . . . hard.”
They were silent in the elevator.  Steve wracked his brain for the right questions to ask about Tony, but they all sounded judgmental or prying and by the time he was halfway to something decent they’d arrived.
When Tony went up to the kitchen a few hours later, he found Steve working at the dinning room table. He was reading a huge PR briefing packet—printed on actual paper—and he was taking notes in the margins.
“Tony, are you all right?”  Pepper asked, her flustered voice echoing across the speakers in the workshop.
Tony looked up and Rogers smiled at him as he slid a beautiful omelet onto the counter for Tony.  Something about Rogers’ smile made him nervous.  It wasn’t bright or obviously happy; it was a quiet smile, subtly pleased.  Tony looked at the omelet.  Suddenly, Tony didn’t want it anymore; he forced himself to pick up his fork anyway.  Rogers took a seat next to him and served himself some fruit and a pancake.  He asked Bruce something about tornadoes.
So, even with a safeword, Tony still had to keep a close eye on him since, apparently, “submissives sometimes forget their safewords” or “a submissive sometimes becomes so accepting of the dominant’s wishes or so ‘endorphined-out’ by the session that calling their safeword will not occur to them . . . in such a case, an unperceptive dominant could unknowingly cause severe damage . . .” (53).
Tony’d expected Steve to practically trip over himself in eagerness, relieved and happy, but instead Steve looked even more uncertain as he stepped forward to pull Tony’s chair out for him.
Tony went back and forth between the Bob data and tinkering on some ancient engine.  Today it was a BSA Super Rocket.
Phillips cut in.  "There have been strange happenings at the Stark court.  Rumors of an assassination attempt.  And stranger still, a ship of Norns claimed that they'd met with Afani bandits armed with Stark steel."
Tony’s fit of pique had chased some of the worry from Rhodey’s face, though he didn’t look quite ready to drop it. Tony sighed. “We’re good. I just . . . there’s nothing to talk about.”
“I didn’t really think you were a virgin,” Tony said softly. “I was just goading you. I didn’t mean for—”
“But,” Sylvia added, with an amused smile, “I trust you’ll understand if there are questions I decline to answer. Your reputation precedes you—I’m hardly going to give you the opportunity to engineer it yourself after the gala, when I’m very much hoping to make a deal with Ms. Potts.”
"The Starks are a rich dynasty and their kingdom prosperous.  With our coffers so badly depleted, we're unlikely to impress them with the gifts we're able to provide, but ritual gift giving is an essential part of any successful treaty. We don't dare give offense by arriving with underwhelming . . . gifts."
“I’m good with frittata,” Tony said. “Uh, actually, Steve? I really like eggs. I’ve even tried to make omelets myself! So don’t worry about serving them to me.”
He’d known of course--the look on Steve’s face made it obvious--but he hadn’t expected such a blunt answer.  It left him unbalanced.
Steve smiled, hesitance bleeding away.  He took a few long deep breaths, shrugged out of his blazer, and draped it over the back of a chair.
Steve fumbled a little with his belt, bending his eyes to the carpet again, just listening to Tony breathe.  He undid his trousers, let them fall to the floor, and then kicked them aside.  His erection, which had flagged earlier in the face of his embarrassment, now jutted proudly from his body again.  Steve shoved his boxers down his legs and added them to his messy pile of clothes.  Unsure what to do now, Steve kept his head bowed, but the rest of his body eased into parade rest of its own accord.  At least it gave him something to do with his hands, but putting them behind his back seemed to draw more attention to his cock.  Then again, from the sound of Tony’s labored breathing, that was hardly a bad thing.
“I’m glad,” Tony answered with an amused little smirk, then said with mock seriousness, “I must have my dignity, after all.”  Steve just snorted.
(And he could plant it in one of the satellites he already had, of course. That wouldn’t be too hard. Just a matter of adjusting the hatch . . .)
Steve tried very hard to be professional and not let her impassivity get to him.  (Is it a test?)  Somehow it was scarier on her than it was on Fury.  Steve took a deep breath and focused on his training report.
It was the Sexual Ethics section of the Employee Conduct Module.  The one that gave absurdly obvious, boring, and PC advice on how not to sexually harass your co-workers, then had a “quiz” with things like :
She asked with a teasing smile, “Come on, Tony, why are we acting so glum?”  She quickly cut him off when he started to answer.  “That’s rhetorical!  Don’t smart ass me.  Really, we should be celebrating.  So go on—”  she leaned forward across the table, “--give me the gossip.  Tell me about Steve.”
Pepper continued: “Anyway, we floated the possibility to the Captain and he had a few ideas too. Seemed very enthusiastic.”
“I have a proposition for a pleasant way to spend the evening—I promise you won’t regret it—but first, I feel I should ask,” his expression had the look of a man ready to laugh at his own joke, “you’re not
“Yeah,” Steve said. “Tony took me to the most amazing restaurant last night! Have you ever had Persian food?”
“Tones? What’s going on?” Rhodey cut in. Tony’s heart clenched. It felt like there wasn’t enough air in the suit. “Tony? I’m almost there with back up.”
need,” Tony pressed on, “is someone studying the worldwide energy readings and weather patterns, like Steve said—and I know jack shit about climate science compared to you. So, here’s what I suggest: division of labor. Me, take care of the engineering. You, work on figuring out what the hell is going on with the intersections of global and interplanetary weirding. See if these are natural phenomena, then work on how to fix it from there. Okay?”
“Sam Deetz!” Tony cried, grabbing the multi-millionaire’s arm as he walked by. “You naughty man, you haven’t said two words to me all night, but--” Tony dropped his head and looked up through his lashes— “when you look so dashing I can’t stay mad.”
“So,” Tony said, “I hear you can’t make time in your busy schedule to train with me so you’re pawning me off on Clint instead.”
Tony watched as Steve and Francesca lingered, looking at each other, a matching wistfulness on their faces, lost in memories of two people they’d both lost. After a few moments, Francesca shook herself a little.
“Good. There are four charity galas I recommend you attend. The Firefighter’s Association was actually on your calendar before, but they rescheduled after the October attack—the original date was for the 4
Tony opened his mouth, but JARVIS spoke first, announcing, “Sir, your pizzas have arrived. Identification authenticated; shall I allow elevator access?”
Tony’s mind was already leaping three steps ahead. It was far too early in the evening to let himself be monopolized by one person for too long or to try and slip out (even briefly), but he could do a little flirting then arrange to meet up at the end of the evening.
JARVIS complied.  Tony heard Rogers exclaim something that sounded like “ack” as a horde of zombies appeared out of nowhere and began ambling towards him.
Steve shook his head, the slightest hint of a blush on his cheeks.  “No.  I hoped we could—” he paused, dropping his eyes. “I thought I’d let you be in charge.”
when—“ He snapped his mouth shut, nearly vibrating with outrage. “Tend your own goddamn house, Fury.”
Then Rogers smiled. “Yes, of course. I’d be happy to bring you a cheeseburger, Mr. Stark.” Then Cap gave him a suspicious look. “You’re allowed to have rich food, right? It won’t hurt your recovery?”
Natasha had brought Tony a plate of sandwiches and a big mug of coffee.  (Had she been taking lessons from Pepper?)  He’d barely touched them.  (Steve said “love”.  He couldn’t mean . . . “This” couldn’t be
Bruce laughed.  Steve smiled and said, “I don’t know what that means, Tony, but it sounds quite sweet.”  Steve kissed Tony on the cheek.  (Oh my God.  I can kiss you.  I can kiss you, right here in the living room.  In front of our friends.)  “Green shirt, no tie.”  Tony nodded and sauntered off.  Steve called after him, “And you’ll need your leather jacket!”
“I’ve got you,” Steve promised. He crouched down beside Tony and kissed his forehead, then his left palm, then his right.
“Oh?” Steve said curiously, allowing Tony to turn them slowly to the right (almost) keeping time with the music.  (Apparently Steve and Sam had not been practicing the waltz.)
; there was nothing but stubborn silence. Steve waited a few moments more than he should, then closed the door.
“To you jumping out of the armor, with no backup and no place to retreat to?  Damn straight we wouldn’t have agreed,” Steve said, getting louder with every word.  “But that’s not the only way we could have tested your theory!”
Steve was stroking his ass, his hips.  (Or was he planning something more ambitious?  Cane or single tail?)  Tony shivered.  He loved a good whipping, but without the right training and practice whip work could go south pretty easily. And Tony was tied facing out into the room, so Steve didn’t have access to his buttocks or back, the safest targets for most impact play.
“Sure,” Bruce said, pushing his glasses back into place. “You’ve already spent a lot of time on this and—“
“You’re not injured? Or sick? Or leaving on an insanely dangerous mission from which you’re not expected to return?”
“Mmmm,” Tony murmured stroking Steve’s cheek.  “Love kissing you so damn much, but I can’t get distracted.  I brought you something.”
Tony swirled his scotch and watched thick legs form around the edge of the glass. He chuckled quietly. Yeah, Rogers wasn’t one of the Dicks of SHIELD, bless his backwards, old-fashioned little heart. Rogers didn’t even get defensive after Tony snapped at him!  He’d just apologized and asked Tony to
Rogers faltered.  “Um, yes?”  He didn’t seem so sure now and was fidgeting slightly under Tony’s unabashed stare.  Tony may be a good bit shorter than most Doms and certainly shorter than Rogers, but he knew how to stare down an arrogant alpha (even looking up at him).
The next day, Tony showed up to the training room at three on the dot. (What? He could be responsible. Besides, he’d maybe been looking forward to reclaiming a bit of his pride. This time, Rogers was going down!)
Steve chuckled and nuzzled Tony’s neck, snuggling into his arms and wrapping a leg around Tony’s.  They laid sleepily together, exchanging slow, lingering touches, for long pleasant minutes.
“I don’t know Clint, Natasha, or Bruce all that well,” Rhodey said, a little hesitant, “But Steve—Steve seems like a Christmas kind of guy.”
“Perhaps some other time,” Tony said sincerely, with a kind smile. He squeezed Harry’s hand. “It was lovely chatting with you, but I’m quite eager to get home. It’s been a long evening.”
He found Steve waiting in the foyer, standing at parade rest. (He did that when he was nervous.) He was wearing a beautiful navy blue suit—not one of the cheap ones he’d bought before moving into the Tower and being set up with Tony’s tailors. It was classic but modern, with a hint of 40s traditionalism; elegant but not overwhelmingly dressy. (Michael Kors had really outdone himself. Then again, with a model like Steve, who wouldn’t?)
She glared.  “ ‘Beer’ is not a verb, Clint,” she said, but grabbed two from the fridge all the same.
As Tony went for his winter things, he found himself smiling unexpectedly. It had gone well. Really well. Katie and Mikie had earned their no-doubt many-zeroed salaries. (Though, Tony actually had no idea what SI paid their PR rockstars… Huh) The reporters had asked way fewer obnoxious questions than he’d expected and, though it was too soon to say for sure, he had a feeling they’d all be happy with the tone and how the team was presented.
(And, as I've asked so many times before, if you don't enjoy my writing for whatever reason, just hit the back button; please don't ruin my day by enumerating all the things you hate about it.)
He left a large tip in the jar and made his way stealthily towards Steve, skirting the back of the bandstand to avoid attracting attention. Tony grinned at Steve as he approached, waving the Sam Adams at him. Steve’s answering smile was lovely, at once happy and relieved.
They lingered over ktefa, quietly sipping more tea, and exchanging long, lingering looks.  Tony hadn’t even said anything and Steve was already blushing.  (Well, no mystery what he’s thinking about!)
If any of you lovely readers are also artists and would like to do artwork for this story, I'd be tremendously pleased and flattered; I'd be delighted to post a link!  In fact, if anybody would like to do a few specific photo manips for the next chapter, please let me know!  Thanks!!!
“Are you joining us after all?” Bruce asked Rogers. Rogers gave a hesitant little smile, a shrug, and a nod.
“Gentle, Hulk,” Steve said in a patient voice. “Like this!” He demonstrated the soft underhand toss again.
“Well, yeah,” Clint admitted. “But really, the hot dog—the New York hot dog—deserves to be its own food group, because—”
Tony was disassembling an old Mark IV gauntlet when he noticed a silent shadow fall across the floor from the doorway. It sent his heart racing and a shaky jolt of adrenaline bursting through his veins.

“I’ve occasionally heard of creeps trying to persuade their lovers to accept abuse because it was ‘part of SM.’  I hope the exposure provided by this book greatly reduces such incidents.  The Bible says, ‘He who doeth evil hateth the light.’  I want this book to be a floodlight, exposing evil and cruelty.”  (5)
“Grab a beer,” Tony said, waving at the kitchen and patting the seat next to him magnanimously. “I’m picking all the best episodes.”
Instead he opened his sketchbook. He frowned at the drawing. (Was that even what a dulcimer looked like?)
“I’ve got you,” Steve whispered into Tony’s neck, hands stroking soothingly up and down Tony’s back.
“So, hey, maybe now’s a good time for these,” Clint said, attempting casual but failing even to Tony’s ears.
“Oh, right,” Rogers said, then set the coffee cup on the counter.  “Would you like some brunch?  I’d be happy to put another omelet on the stove for you, Mr. Stark.”
Tony threw his phone back on the end table with a clatter.  He couldn’t stay there, couldn’t just wait.  He rushed down the hall, grateful to find the living room empty, and slammed the door to his little workshop.
“I know you’re taking me out on a date tonight,” Steve said, a little shyly, “but I was on my way back from my appointment and passed a flower shop and thought it would still be okay to get you these.”
Rogers swallowed and his tongue darted out to swipe across his lip before he continued, “So, not only can you build one, Mr. Stark, you’ve made it small enough that we’ll be able to fit it in the clearing where the force field showed up.  Or wherever else it might appear. That’s really--” Rogers seemed to struggle for words before settling on, “amazing.” The word was soft, almost awed.  At last he turned to look at Tony. “So, if the only thing I can do to help is bring you coffee, I don’t mind.  Because, this?  This is amazing.”
Thank you all so much for the happiness this story has brought me!  I honestly would have quit writing it if it weren't for your continued interest and support, and I'm very grateful that you've encouraged me to keep going. It has been a really wonderful thing in my life and that is your doing.
“Not gonna lie,” Steve said, rubbing his forehead again. “I’m counting down the moments till I can get out of here.”
Captain America was wearing a grey and white checkered shirt with a pair of glorious jeans Tony suspected Katie Winters had picked out for him.  (Gorgeous.)  And he was carrying an actual tray with a huge glass of water, an unopened beer, and a plate heaped high with chicken, roasted potatoes, and veggies. Cap set it carefully at the far end of Tony’s workbench.
“It won’t be my decision,” Fury answered.  “As team leader, Captain Rogers would be making the final decision.”
“If you want to pester somebody’s cooking, go pester the Captain!” Mrs. Rhodes added as Tony walked away. He paused.
“Dunno,” Clint called, then added with a baffled frown, “Actually, I haven’t seen him since yesterday afternoon.”
“What did you want, Rogers?”  Tony asked, voice hard and diction crisp, the soft, almost slurred tone he'd had with Pepper banished in an instant.
Bathed, groomed, and naked, Tony studied his reflection. He looked good: his shoulders and arms were nicely toned, but not bulging; his legs were strong and muscular (apart from his soft, fleshy inner thighs); his stomach was still (basically) flat and his hairless chest had good definition (interrupted by the arc reactor). He stepped closer to the mirror.
“No! Of course not, Tony!” Bruce exclaimed, holding up his hands in surrender. “Of course I trust your engineering. I was just surprised, that’s all. I didn’t realize you were that close to a solution.”
(Really fucking eloquent, Stark.) The thought came unbidden and made his guts clench.  (God damn it, I don’t have to impress him. You’re fucking dead, Howard, so just fucking--)
“And what did I know about him?” Natasha asked, pouring herself a vodka and then draping herself across the wing-back chair opposite Tony.
At last, Steve broke away with a gasp. Panting heavily, he pressed his lips to Tony’s throat and jaw, then murmured again, “Do you like that, sweetheart?”
“It was too much, wasn’t it?” Tony asked.  And how could he sound so guilty and so relieved at the same time?  “I shouldn’t have—”
Seriously people? This is Captain America we’re talking about; he’s hardly some virginal little ingenue who can’t make adult choices. So what if there’s an age difference? They’re both DEFINITELY consenting adults.
“Some of it has been successfully returned,” Tony said tentatively after a moment of melancholy silence. “The Klimt portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer were returned to her descendants.”
“Don’t fake with me,” Steve scolded. “You’ve got a real eye for design! Plus,” Steve hesitated again,“the point is to do it
“Christ it’s cold!” Tony said, wriggling closer to Steve. “I was only out there for a moment and I’m freezing.” (It wasn’t
“You make the most beautiful noises, Steve,” Tony murmured, eyes fixed intently on Steve’s face. Steve stared back at him wide-eyed, captivated.  Tony drew his finger out, then pressed in to touch that place again.
“Sorry, Steve,” Tony said, “you have to wait a little longer for yours. Doesn’t exactly fit under the tree. Now, who wants more eggnog?”
When he caught sight of Tony, Rogers smiled warmly; then his brow creased, the smile dimmed, and he opened and shut his mouth a few times. He glanced down at the pancakes and bacon and then back.
“Please, Tony.  I  . . .” (Go on.  Say it.)  “I want your cock.  I want to drive you crazy, make you come.  Please let me.”
“Hey, Tony? I was going to pick up the--” Bruce said, then went silent, frozen in the doorway.  “Oh, hello, Captain.  Tony, our package wasn’t there.”
“I mean, that’s your floor, so you can do whatever you want with it, you know? Just thought, since you seem to like this kitchen better, maybe we should redo yours.”
and put him under; couldn’t say or do in a calculated or explicit manner any of those little things Doms did to help their subs into subspace. He’d learned the hard way how much it hurt for none of that to work and the added pressure of a Dom who felt their ego on the line was too much.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, with a sly smile, “something tells me you’d give me a sandwich just of the asking.”
Tony took the stairs two at a time and was waiting when the elevator doors opened.  Rogers gave him a brilliant smile, his big blue eyes bright and his blond hair perfectly combed and shining.
“Mass is at seven,” Rogers said with a little shrug.  He took another sip of coffee.  Tony just stared.  (Mass?  Like
“I’m very happy for you.”  She glanced over her shoulder at the door Tony had just exited.  “Be good to him.”  Then she added before Steve could protest.  “I know you will be.”
Tony made everything seem so effortless, simple as breathing, natural as his genius.  Dominance seemed to flow from Tony’s body-- a reflex, an instinct.  It was silly, but Steve had sometimes wondered if that had drawn him to Tony in the first place, as if the hidden submissive inside him was calling out to Tony’s dominance for completion, finding yet another reason to love Tony beyond all the obvious ones anyone could see: Tony’s courage, his kindness, his fierce intelligence, his generosity, his sense of humor . . . Tony had taken charge like it was the most natural thing in the world for him, like he knew exactly what to do with Steve, exactly what Steve needed.
“Yeah. And pumpkin curry, medium. Tom Kha Gai. And spring rolls. Double spring rolls, JARVIS! And mango with sticky rice. Thanks, J!”
Tony and Rhodey resumed their awkward shuffle. Once they finally reached his bedroom, Tony let himself go boneless and flopped face-first on the bed. (Ouph. Should’a done that more gently . . .)
After Theresa Williams—the famous managing partner of the even more famous Williams Law Firm—married Jackie, Tony’d expected him to give up his salon, but five years later his beauty empire had only grown.
Steve pressed him back still further; Tony’s thighs went taught with the effort of holding position.
“Definitely,” Tony agreed and cast a look over at Natasha. Across the room Natasha raised an eyebrow at him.
“I’m not fixated and Ms. Potts would never speak ill of you,” Steve said with considerable irritation. “She slapped me.”
Tony nodded.  “Yeah, that was a good bike.  I mean, nothing compared to what I could design, but not bad for the old stuff.”
With a gentle pressure on his jaw, Steve tipped Tony’s chin up and kissed him, mouth warm and soft. Tony parted his lips with a sigh and felt Steve’s tongue tentatively skim his bottom lip.
Tony sauntered forward with a grin and a shrug. “Geeze, Captain, are you always so loud? Mr. Belford was just heading out.” Tony took Rogers’ arm, and tossed over his shoulder, “Good chat,
“Anyway, Father Gabe also worked with the kids at Magdalene House and Bucky’d just arrived and was giving them hell. He had his father’s temper and some of his fight training and was pretty mad at the world, ya know? He’d had free run before, since his dad was never around much, and now there were all these rules and other kids, and he was angry and a real big guy for his age and—well.” Steve grimaced. “He wasn’t adjusting well.”
“You’d never hurt me,” Steve said solemnly, with absolute confidence.  Tony’s heart clenched.  He let out a strangled little noise, then took a deep breath.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“Well good,” Clint said. “Uh, ‘cause I maybe really like Christmas trees. Maybe. Are we gonna decorate it?”
“Steve, I—“ Tony said.  “Look, I know I was a playboy and a manwhore, but I’ve *never* cheated on anyone.  I wouldn’t.  I—“  (And, yeah, maybe it sounds a little sharp or maybe a little defensive, and, shit, now Steve is pulling away and—)
Rogers looked ravishing, but somehow wrong in a tux: beautiful, but almost too big, although it was expertly tailored. Maybe it was just his stiff discomfort ruining the look. When he caught sight of Tony, he stopped pulling at his tie and gave a nervous laugh.
The next chapter has been proving particularly hard to write, but hopefully I won't be stuck for too long.  Musings, curiosity, and cheer-leading welcome at my tumblr: ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com
stay to hear any more. Bad enough he'd eavesdropped on Ms Potts, but he wouldn't do that to Bruce, his friend and his teammate.
Over the next few days, Tony and Bruce worked on the spectrometer and Tony found himself almost, well,
“May I get your coat?” Steve asked, voice pitched low as they stepped into the little vestibule. He was standing very close. Tony’s heart gave a little jump as he nodded.
“The short answer is ‘no’.” Captain Rogers shakes his head. “I’m the wrong person to ask about the science side of things; Doctors Stark and Banner are working on an array of theories, but I’m not at liberty to disclose any of their findings at present. And I probably couldn’t explain it even if they’d asked me to try. For now I’ll just say that I have absolute faith in them and we have every reason to believe that the portal closure devices will work in the event of a second attack.”
“God, Tony,” Steve groaned against his throat, “The mouth on you! The way you talk . . . you just--”
“Coming, Nat,” Clint called, “cause, I’m not sure that killing the dragon automatically means you won that round.  The way I see it--”
It wasn’t that he hated Christmas, or didn’t love the Rhodes. (Rhodes? Rhodeses?) But Christmas was the time when Matriarch Marianne Rhodes gathered her
At last: The Conversation.  I had no idea that the end of chapter two would be considered a cliff hanger-- please accept my apologies and chapter 3 by way of recompense.  Thank you for your kind words of (outraged) enthusiasm!  :-)
The Agent, who’d looked more and more distressed as Tony spoke, now stepped in front of the door.  Tony glared.
Steve took out a fresh sheet of paper. He wouldn’t give up.  He’d just keep trying until he could get it right and then he’d be able to continue his painting.  He sketched out the familiar lines of Tony’s jaw, his cheeks, the curve of his forehead.  Steve took a sip of tea.  Earl grey, which still reminded him of Peggy, but in a good way.  His little studio—with easels and drawing boards, paints and charcoal—was always a refuge.
But there was nothing to apologize for and Tony wasn’t about to let Steve out of his sight in this mood. He pulled the door shut and approached Steve with the blanket. Steve’s exposed skin was bright pink with frostbite
“Yeah,” Bruce said, “He was making a case for Thompson’s new theory about the Einstein Rosen bridge.”
“God, Tony,” Steve choked out, pressing his face to Tony’s neck. “You’re perfect . . . so perfect like this, bound and gasping, I want to—“
“Yeah. Sure,” Bruce bit his lip. “Just, I—are you really sure about the Security Blanket? I thought—“
(And if Tony felt a shameful little burst of jealousy, he tried to smother it. He could be happy for Rhodey. Besides, lovers came and went, and Rhodey’d never abandoned him.)
The cover was, frankly, a bit of a mess. They’d used separate close-ups of Tony and Steve instead of a picture of them standing together. (Maybe the blocking was meant to imply that, secret romance or no, they were so incompatible they couldn’t share a frame?) Tony shook his head. (Don’t overthink it, Stark.) The cover looked like exactly what it was: a fiction cobbled awkwardly together. Tony scrolled to the inside, though, and felt a jolt of shock and recognition at the interior photos.
She held his gaze for a few long moments and some small part of Tony shied away at the sheer sincerity of that promise.
“Welcome to St. Michael’s,” a woman’s voice said softly.  “Just let me know if you’d like a tour or any information about the architecture or our ministries.  I’d be happy to—  Oh!  Steve!”
Tony frowned and bit his lip. He had work to do, but he couldn’t bear to wake Steve. And, really, he didn’t want to pull himself away from that warm embrace.
Steve paused, breathing deeply as he got himself under control; Tony kissed him sweetly, murmuring between kisses, “Thank you . . . so good . . . love you . . . Steve . . . Steve . . .”
Tony’s face was relaxed with sleep, his lips parted.  Steve noticed for the first time that there were little flecks of grey in the stubble around Tony’s well-trimmed beard, but no grey in his hair.  There were fine lines around his eyes.  Steve smiled.  He pictured Tony frowning and squinting at the projections in the workshop, when Tony was running on too much coffee and too little sleep.
Steve laid caresses on every bit of skin he exposed—Tony’s ass, his flank, his thighs, his knees, his ankles.  With a little nudge he got Tony to step out of his trousers, tossed them aside, then resumed his meticulous explorations.
Tony made a slashing motion and JARVIS ended the call. Tony sighed, feeling at sixes and sevens. He went to the bathroom for a piss, still trying to decide what to do. Washing up, he caught sight of his eyebrows and grimaced.
“But since you ask, yeah, I organized it,” Dom said. “No harm in having a little harmless fun in our down time.”
Rogers shrugged. “We’re developing skills, Iron Man, not trying to leave each other a mess of bruises.”
Steve felt a surge of triumph.  He could feel the head of Tony’s cock touching the back of his throat, still open, just resting there like Tony said.  He tried to memorize the feel of it (
Tony swallowed, his throat feeling tight and his eyes beginning a tell-tale prickle. He pulled himself up a bit to lean against the headboard of Steve’s bed.
Tony extricated himself from the Jacobs and was heading for the coatroom—dodging would-be conversational partners with a carefully averted gaze and selective hearing—when he ran into Harry. Tony couldn’t ignore that eager smile.
“We’d like a bottle of the Montepulciano d’Abruzzo and I’ll have the risotto a la Milanese, followed by the costolette di agnello vino rosso and patate.”
Then Steve started moving faster, with purpose, winding Tony higher and higher until he was whimpering with every motion.
“Hey, guys?” Tony said, flipping up the faceplate, “I’ve gotta take this call. Very important. Stark Industries! I’ll meet you back at the house. JARVIS can reboot the training robots if you’re not done yet.”
the one with a little crush.”  He smirked at Bruce.  “You sure you’re a Dom, Banner?  Of course, rumor has it Carter was a Domme, but she went belly-up for the Super-Mega-Dom, so you wouldn’t be the first to solo-switch for Big, Blond, and Beautiful.  Just, ya know, I thought you went for brains and tits not cock and—”
Steve leaned back and looked up at him a little bemused, but unconcerned.  He shrugged.  “It wasn’t on the list,” Steve said, cocking his head.  At Tony’s look of confusion, he clarified, “When you gave me the spreadsheet, I put the words I didn’t know into wikipedia.”
Tony was only too happy to stop hammering at the damn Security Blanket with his brain. He was on the verge of an engineering headache. Seriously, it was never gonna be strong enough.
“I called Mother Superior and offered to bring toys to Magdalene House on Christmas dressed as St. Nicholas,” Steve said with a little shrug. He finished tying a bow, then added, “Uh, she said the kids would probably appreciate a visit from the real Captain America more than a pretend St. Nick, but yeah. She gave me all their wish lists, and the teachers added some notes. So, Jessica asked for a doll, but shows an aptitude for science according to Sister Margaretta, so I got her the chemistry set too. Stuff like that.” Another shrug. “It’s been fun. And we haven’t been that busy lately.”
In the elevator, Tony tapped his fingers against the arc reactor. He sighed. When he hit the penthouse, Tony poured himself a scotch then realized it was 1:35 pm and set it back down under the imagined weight of Pepper’s disapproving stare. (Damnit.)
Steve seemed disappointed as he left the workshop. Tony almost called out after him—he hated to disappoint Steve—but he hadn’t worked on the training bots in ages and really he was terribly busy. He’d already spent lots of time on all the Christmas stuff. He was absurdly behind with his projects. The training bots. The latest StarkTech upgrades. A new round of arrows for Clint. Lots of stuff really. He couldn’t just hop on the back of Steve’s bike and—
Tony was still tinkering with the old laptop, taking it apart and putting it back together.  He could make a better machine from scratch and, considering it was a
“Good thinking. I’ll talk to SHIELD medical and get some procedures we can adapt.” Steve turned to Tony. “Can you and JARVIS do a diagnostic scan on the field?”
“Bruce?” Tony said with an apologetic smile. “There’s something I need to take care of. I’m gonna head out for a bit.”
“You’ll do fine,” Tony told him with a shrug. “You look great, Cap.” Tony raised an eyebrow and added, “Though, you’re messing up that bowtie.”
“That’s enough,” Steve said firmly, looking at the Powerpoint very seriously.  “I appreciate the offer of added resources, but I have to agree with Iron Man.  The . . . support . . . you’re proposing is at odds with our training strategy.”
The Captain looks lost for a second. He leans forward to whisper to Colbert, “What’s the Superbowl?”
Tony had been expecting quite a few more notes than this, though, especially considering the start they’d made together.  There was only one, next to “role play”:
Tony played with his pen, mind running through possible barometric correlations with portal appearances. (Oh, hm, better ask Bruce if--)
Rogers looked very seriously at him and then shook his head with a sigh.  “No.  I’m team leader.  Ultimately, it’s my fault the mini-spectrometer wasn’t ready.  If it had been, you and Dr. Banner would have at least the first set of readings, right?”
it, but he wasn’t half as bad at the business side of Stark Industries as some people assumed he was. He reviewed the Marketing Department’s proposed campaign for the next StarkTabs. (Pepper agreed wholeheartedly that there weren’t enough subs or POC in the campaign and was planning to have A Word with Jenny to have A Word with the New Guy.)
Bruce seemed happier once they got to work, but Tony was getting terribly frustrated.  Running in circles with the same fucking data was driving him crazy. And it was
(It’s cool you lied to the press. You’re pretty fucking shrewd. Sorry I thought you might be a moron. But you’re not! Yay! Anyway, thanks for lying to make me look better. You’re all right.)
Steve gave a rueful smile and shook his head. “Wasn’t a lot of time for art when I was in Europe,” Steve said softly.
Rogers gnawed on his lip, brow furrowed, looking at Tony very intently.  Tony swirled his glass of scotch and waited.  (Two can use the Pepper Voodoo.)
Tons and tons of love to everyone who has stuck with me for all this time and a warm welcome to any new readers!
relaxed, curled up in the armchair. She looked like the very picture of relaxation. So maybe that’s why Tony looked again. And then again as the film continued.
“You’re Iron Man.”  Rogers sounded earnest and impressed.   (From someone else, it might have sounded
. Hidden in a barn to keep her from the Nazis. I stayed up with her all night. She was so beautiful and—“ Steve took a rough breath and said thickly, “And there’d been so little time for beauty.”
doesn’t feel weird…) Steve took another sip of water and brought the dildo back to his mouth, determined. He closed his eyes.
. How could I possibly recommend sending you into emergency response situations in that state?  Into
In the elevator on the way down, Bruce was awkward and fidgety. (More so than usual, that is.) He probably shouldn’t try it, but Tony couldn’t resist saying:
“That sounds lovey!” Steve said, as he put a platter of bacon on the table. “I enjoyed the porridge you shared, when was it? Last week maybe? The one with—“
“Look, JARVIS, said you weren’t answering him anymore, so I came down. Are you still coming up for sushi and
“Can you try?  For me?” Tony asked a moment later.  Steve sighed and nodded.  He thought for a while, then took a deep breath and tried again.
“Thank you for the invitation, Tony,” Pepper said softly from the loveseat.  “It’s nice to see you.”
just cut the melon and was putting toast in the toaster. Maybe that counted as ‘cooking breakfast’ in Steve’s eyes.
“Well, I couldn’t possibly eat any popcorn,” Pepper announced, “But I am interested in a cocktail. You’re a good bartender, Clint. What shall we make?”
But it clearly wasn’t ok.  And the wrongness of it left Tony’s stomach twisting and his cheeks heating with (stupid, irrational) shame.  His throat felt tight.
“I was about to make eggs for myself,” Rogers said. He set the newspaper aside.  “Would you like some?”
I really really hope you liked this!  Steve and I had quite a bit of performance anxiety here that made it really hard to write . . . so, uh, if you want to give your writer some aftercare, she'd really appreciate it.
She hadn’t noticed him yet.  Steve considered turning around and beating a hasty retreat.  He knew perfectly well how Ms. Potts felt about him and--much as he admired her loyalty to Tony--he wasn’t terribly fond of her either.
. People looked at him, but they always did. Tony was not only rich—they all were at these sorts of things—but famous. (Infamous too.) So, Tony talked to people he knew (whether he liked them or not) and let new people introduce themselves (whether he wanted to meet them or not). Politeness prevailed. The evening felt no different from dozens of others he’d had at The Regency, The Plaza, or The Carlyle. Little by little, Tony started to relax. He went to the bar.
“In anticipation of the Avenger’s first confrontation with the Hulk, we have earmarked the following equipment and personnel.”
“Mmmmm,” Tony murmured, eyes still shut.  He shifted against Steve, holding him close, savoring the long expanse of his warm body. Steve ran his fingers over Tony’s pajamas in a caress, skating down Tony’s shoulder, his chest, his side, then coming to rest on his hip.
(Shit.) Tony threw back the last of his coffee--he’d need it—then said hopefully, “And pancakes after? Right?”
Tony wriggled and tried to lean up for a kiss, but Steve pressed him harder into the cushion, holding him in place. His blue eyes were very bright as he recited: “To enter in these bonds, is to be free;”
Tony waved at the TV.  “That means Saturday morning cartoons.  Hey, JARVIS?  Hit it!  Oh, and get brunch delivered from that place—whatsit on 9
It was strange to realize that Rogers had to actively study the present and recent past. Not that Tony hadn’t known it before—obviously the man had a lot of catching up to do, but now it felt more immediate. Rogers had to memorize things other Americans in 2012 just . . .
and the serum had just brought out what was already there.  He became the perfect Dom because he always had been the perfect Dom.
Tony nodded and rushed ahead, “You can definitely wrap Christmas presents in the common room. And we can get a tree! You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
“Some of them were just soldiers, you know?” Steve’s voice went quiet. “They were just boys, and I wondered sometimes, was he drafted or did he volunteer?” The words came pouring out faster and faster. “Does he love Hitler or just his country or is he simply afraid? Did his mother, sister, little brother pray every night for him to come home safe? Hans or Fritz or Kurt or whatever his name was I’d left bleeding in the mud.” Steve’s hands were clenched together, twisting in his lap. Tony’s throat felt tight as Steve kept rambling:
, like way more work than anything else and then I was thinking about that night when I told you about myself and then, well, there was this bit at the beginning.  It was . . . it—“ Steve gave up and handed the book over to Tony, pointing to a paragraph on page 48.
Steve moaned around Tony’s dick and pulled back to lavish attention on the head, circling it with his tongue, then sucking and caressing it with his lips.  Tony cried out.  He grabbed Steve’s head and thrust with his hips, forcing his cock deep into Steve’s mouth again.
“Seriously, though, am I the only one?” Tony asked, ignoring Steve’s admonishment. “Everybody else played catch as kids?”
“Oh, man,” Tony said, “has anybody introduced you to Taylor Swift yet? Here! We’ve gotta watch the video. It’s too fucking adorable. You’ll love it! And, hey, did you say something about pancakes?”
“I’m still open from your cock last night,” Tony told him roughly. “Hardly need any prep. Please, Steve? I want you to. Let go. Let yourself have this.”
“Riddles,” Tony repeated.  He couldn’t help but laugh. “This is the terrifying King to whom I’ve been sent as tribute!”
The officer in the kitchen outranked him; Steve snapped to attention. (Some reflexes never go away, apparently.) Steve swallowed. The colonel was standing in profile, very handsome with dark skin, broad shoulders and a strong jaw. (Handsome? Stop it. You shouldn’t think like that.) Steve shook his head.
“I didn’t realize it was still a sore spot, ok?” Rhodey hesitated. “And, you know I didn’t really mind much anyway. I thought it was kinda sweet.”
Tony nodded. “Leila and Amir used to have a food truck near Stark Industries and Pep and I used to eat there all the time. It was so good it melted our brains. I used to get the

“Still coming in. So far Specs 33 and 89 show most promise,” Bruce answered, voice tense. “I’ve been looking at your blueprints for a reverse polarity device, but I don’t know—I’m not an engineer, Tony.”
“Sweetheart?” Deetz called out as they entered the Carlyle’s Presidential suite. “I’ve brought a friend.”
Tony blinked. (He’s never heard that tone from Steve before.) He was still trying to figure out how to answer, when Steve added bitterly, “And, apparently, I’ve been asleep at my post for weeks.” Steve shook his head. “I should have been preparing.” He glared at Tony. “And
Steve wanted to rip Tony’s clothes off, but Tony had been moving so slowly, so sensually—he tried to keep the same tempo.  Slowly, he pulled Tony’s sweater and T-shirt off as Tony obligingly raised his arms.  He kissed his way from Tony’s neck down to his wrist on his right, then on his left. He ran his hands across Tony’s shoulders, his chest, the arc reactor.  He kissed Tony deeply and caressed his shoulder blades for a while.  Eager but trying not to rush, Steve pulled away to carefully unzip Tony’s trousers.  Steve slid Tony’s trousers and underwear down his legs, turning it into a caress.  Steve dropped to his knees.
Tony turned to watch his sleeping Dom as he huffed and rolled over. He was still frowning slightly in his sleep. He looked so young--no wrinkles on his face, except the crease of his frown. Without thinking, Tony ran his hand down Steve’s back; his frown eased and he let out a long, deep sigh, still sleeping.
Tony felt like there was still something missing, but the moment slipped past and Pep turned her attention back to the uniforms, saying, “So, walk me through the manufacturing.”
Tony frowned. If Steve wanted solo time with his buddy that was fine, but he was acting weird about it.
Inside the Carlyle, there was a band on the main stage, a silent auction to the right, and a giant Tiffany monstrosity for the ball drop. Tony blinked—he’d half-forgotten that this fundraiser was also a New Year’s Eve party.
help me,” Tony said, adjusting himself against a mound of pillows. “Seriously, man, I’m dying in this place. You’re here to help me sneak out, right?”
Tony spent a week in the workshop nonstop finishing up the arc reactor for the tower, then gave the suit a new paint job for good measure.  Only Pepper came down, just to ensure he got regular feedings.  She used her befuddling combination of “I’m a Mistress obey me” voice and the “I’m a fellow sub who wants to nurture you” voice. (Not all switches could pull off both so effortlessly.  It was a real feat.)
It was hardly Tony’s first rodeo—he could barely muster the energy to be nervous anymore—and even with Katie and Mikie running the show, the style of questions was deplorably predictable:
They all piled into the elevator. Tony bade Clint and Natasha a distracted ‘goodnight.’ When the elevator stopped at Bruce’s floor, he looked at Tony expectantly.
The glowing screens disappeared. Tony grabbed a random screwdriver and spun to the door with a grin for--
“And I mean it,” Tony said fiercely, “if they don’t back off when you say so, I’ll sic the lawyers on them. Serum or no, they don’t own you. There are laws you know!”
Steve rushed to put the flowers in a pitcher, grabbed his coat, and hurried back to join Tony in the elevator. Tony found Steve’s haste ridiculously endearing; he rather liked seeing Steve sweetly flustered for him.
“Anyway,” the man said, shoulders back and head held high, “I took the picture for my grandson because I knew he’d be excited. I wasn’t gonna sell it or some nonsense.”
Tony shook himself. “I’m on it!” he yelled, and took off after the creatures, as a red, white, and blue blur leapt the perimeter and made chase.
—though, as it turns out that isn’t actually Persian, just something Americans expect from a Middle-Eastern-looking food truck. Oh! Have you had
Tony nodded and took a long drink from his water bottle. Clint had really put him through his paces.
“Then I’m all ears.” Tony smiled, then asked: “Is it a plan that pairs with caviar and pierogies or arancini and calamari.”
Tony wasn’t the first to arrive. There he was in all his glory: Captain America, six-foot-two & eyes-of-blue, wearing a magnificent tuxedo, hovering and fidgeting in the middle of Tony’s living room.
Leila’d seen them off with a brisk, “I’m so glad you enjoyed it, Captain; read your mail, Stark.” In the car, Tony put on the Old Timey Music Mix he’d asked JARVIS to make earlier. As he cut in front of a truck turning out of the alleyway, the band struck up. Steve turned in the passenger seat to gaze at Tony’s profile, humming along under his breath.
Tony took a deep breath.  He could smell Steve’s sweat, hints of his shampoo, the heady smell of sex hanging in the air.
“If I snatch a piece of bacon from the skillet, will you rap my knuckles with your spatula?” Tony asked impishly.
"Something is afoot in Manottan," Fury said.  "We need this treaty to go well.  Need them to be our allies; but we also need to know what's happening to keep one step ahead.  So, this isn't a job for a dewy eyed little O; we need someone with grit and brains.  A patriot.  Someone who wants to serve their country.  Only question is, is that person you?"
She cleared her throat and looked over her shoulder. “Captain? Could you please carry Tony to the elevator for me?”
And then Steve found himself fumbling around in his mind for another avenue of conversation and failing utterly.  For all the times he’d come into the common areas hoping his team would be there, he hadn’t done much thinking about what he’d say to them if they were.  He felt like an awkward little shrimp standing on the sidelines again, tongue-tied and embarrassed.
Tony was still wearing his clothes from the night before, his tank top dimming the glow of the arc reactor, a grey sweatshirt covering his beautiful shoulders.  Steve loved Tony’s shoulders—well-muscled without being bulky, like a classical statue only warm, so unlike cold white marble.  (And sure, Greek statues had actually been polychromatic, but that’s not how you see them in museums, so it’s kinda hard to picture them that way.)  Tony was built like Apollo, but he’d make a better Hephaestus—god of blacksmiths.  Steve smiled.  He’d probably like that.  Maybe Steve would sketch him as Hephaestus sometime.  Or draw the pair of them—as Achilles and Petroclus or members of the Sacred Band of Thebes, lover-warriors who fought as pairs in ancient Greece.  Steve shook his head, half chuckling to himself.  They’d probably look ridiculous if he tried to draw them like that.  Still, it might be fun to try.
could come pouring out of there and if we don’t know how to close it . . .  well, it—how’d you say?— it gives me the ‘heebie-jeebies.’”
and Thai food, Tony was kinda surprised to get another, “Captain Rogers regrets he is unavailable, but thanks you for the invitation.”
Steve shifted nervously in his seat and stared at the student work displayed in the hallway. Fine, but generic.  Steve didn’t care for it.  (And couldn’t help thinking he’d be capable of better, given such fine paints and canvass--not to mention lessons.)
“What!? No!” Tony fumbled. (Shit. Miscalculated.) “No, it’s cool! Cook wherever. I don’t think this kitchen’s ever had so much cooking happen in it, really, which is pretty ‘
Tony hesitated a moment, then shrugged and said, tone subdued:  “I really doubt it since, ‘Captain America’ was invented as 1940’s propaganda. Doubt they’d have liked this one bit.”  Tony shook his head.  “But, yeah, Steve Rogers is gay.”
Tony looked around the restaurant with new interest and said, “You must have liked it if you wanted to come back now.”
Steve bobbed his head, up and down, working his lips and tongue, trying to remember the things Tony had done to him, the ones that made his toes curl and his blood sing. It was strange, doing this alone on a
Silence settled in the workshop. Tony’s plate was empty; he’d finished the breakfast quite a while ago without noticing it.
Steve took a deep breath and knelt on the floor beside the bed. He did a few breathing exercises to relax and tried to let his throat go loose and open. Then he tipped the cup and tried to let a little bit of water slide down his throat without swallowing. It worked! Encouraged, he tried again, but was overconfident and ended up swallowing to avoid choking. (Don’t get cocky, Rogers.) Steve snorted. (
Tony’s partner—some start up hot shot (or wanna be) from Silicon Valley—was droning on and on. Tony glanced over his partner’s shoulder to see Steve shaking his head again and giving an apologetic smile to a lovely young sub in an indigo tuxedo. Their eyes met for a moment, but Steve quickly looked away again.
“In that case, sir,” JARVIS continued smoothly.  “Perhaps it is an ideal time to catch up on your correspondence.  You have seventy-nine new emails. 22 marked urgent from Ms. Winters and nine from Ms. Potts.”
Without a word Steve nodded, set his notebook aside, and followed her to the elevator. She didn’t say anything. His heart was pounding.
“Yeah, well,” Tony said, heart hammering. “Spider aliens don’t invade in ‘real life’ either. It’ll work out.”
Pepper waited a moment before giving Tony a little smile and prompting, “So, who is she?  Do I know her?”
When Tony reached into one of the bags, rooting around for a spring roll, though, it drew a cry of protest.
Steve’s voice dropped to a whisper so low Tony could barely hear him: “They say freezing’s a pretty quiet way to go, almost gentle . . . but the cold didn’t get me first, not till I was breathing in ice water and it burned my lungs and it was so cold and I couldn’t-- Couldn’t--”
He worked hard on the e-ink displays. It was good. And, well, if he was a little distracted sometimes there was nobody there (sitting on his couch, drawing quietly, reading a paper book) to notice.
It was getting late.  Maybe Tony wasn’t coming today after all.  The afternoon light was just trending into evening, long and lovely, the sky filled with striking, luminously pastel clouds.  Needing to get out of the Tower without actually leaving it, Steve headed for the roof deck to enjoy the sky.
“Nope!  Super soldiers need their supper.”  Tony stood and pulled up his trousers.  (How could he make that look so elegant?)  “Besides, we’re running late as it is.  Get yourself in order, soldier.  Go on!”
Slowly and awkwardly, half-leaning on Rhodey, Tony stumbled along to the elevator, then down the hall. (Why was his bedroom so far from the elevator, anyway?) They started to tip forward, but—
The old man gave him an unimpressed look and said, “That’s usually what a man standing at a bus stop is doing, yes.”
(“Don’t worry, I always bring enough to share with my friends!  Who wants to do a line off my ass?”)
, Tony found it touching how transparently moved he was by the film. He would gasp, squeeze Tony’s hand, and even wiped his eyes a few times.  Tony felt his own prickle in sympathy; he hoped the Battle of Helm’s Deep didn’t bring back painful memories of The War.
it was the right call to model the training robots on storm troopers. Who doesn’t want to join the rebel alliance?)
“Would you like some cocoa?” Steve blurted, too urgent and too loud.  He almost winced at the sound of his voice, half ashamed of how desperate he was for Tony to stay, even for just a few minutes, to ramble about his project for a while or simply sit with him in silence.
Tony nodded with satisfaction, then brushed past to flop on Roger’s couch. It was soft, but not too soft. (Of course. Tony’d picked it.)
“Understood.” Tony clinked his mug to Steve’s. “Coffee is sacred—I should never have questioned you, Captain.” Tony gave a joking salute.
“Yeah. He’s actually the one who convinced me to go see her, because she’d helped him so much. I, uh—I didn’t want to go at first, for stupid reasons, but Rhodey can be damn persuasive.”
For Tony, presenting had been a horrible downgrade, a fluke, a failure. (You can’t hear me, but I’m so sorry, mom. So fucking sorry . . .) Had Rogers been relieved? Overjoyed? Numb? Confused? Had he, against all the odds, actually been disappointed? What was it like growing up then as a sub? Tony wanted to know everything about this Steve Rogers, not Howard’s Captain America.
Tony worried his bottom lip a moment. He glanced around the workshop. Dummy was still playing ball, unaware of the tension behind him. (Lucky bot.) Tony cleared his throat.
Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He’d looked at it the first time around, typing it by hand—compiling it from sample charts in honest-to-God paper books that he’d gotten from the library at MIT in the days before the internet. Thinking like an idiot that if he could give his crush a full, grown-up contract—
“Oh, fuck,” Tony mumbled.  Steve could hear him rummaging around in the black bag and then the familiar sound of a plastic cap flicking open.  Steve’s heart leapt.
“Well how’d ya like that?” Steve asked shaking his head. “Lost interest already. That’s what I get for warning him. Now what am I gonna do for a model? Oh wait, he—“
For whatever reason, it seemed like Bruce only wanted to see Steve after The Incident, so Tony hardly saw his Dom. Steve was almost always in Bruce's room, talking in a low tone (not that Tony tried to eavesdrop because eavesdropping is wrong) about something he didn't share with Tony. (Trying to keep Bruce on the team? Working on new safety protocols? (Hopefully) smoothing the way for Tony's (increasingly abject) apology?) And when Steve came back he was always exhausted and a little melancholy.
Natasha smiled at him and it was always hard to read her expressions, but the way her lips quirked to the side and her brows furrowed looked maybe a little amused, and maybe more than a little sad.
“No, sir. Of course not,” Dominick said turning back to the slides.  “As I was saying, the agenda is to review the science team’s findings, the Avenger’s proposed off-site training exercises, and SHIELD’s support measures.”
(I hate hearing you cough like that—reminds me of being sick, the pain in my chest. I was always sick. Before.)
“I know you’re there,” Tony called without turning around.  “Even if you and JARVIS have some sort of creepy deal that he not announce you, which is obviously cheating by the way.”  (Damn super spies.)  He thought he could
“. . . if you gag a submissive, you obviously have to stay with them and watch them even more closely than you ordinarily would . . . for safety’s sake, you should attach the mouth-stuffing to the strap so that it cannot work its way into the back of the submissive’s throat.  Again, failure to do that has resulted in many accidental deaths. . .” (149).
“What? No. I don’t do Christmas.” Tony swallowed. “And, yeah. You should invite him. I don’t think it would be good for Steve to be alone.”
“Please, Pep?  Just tell me.”  He’d said it quietly, seriously, and knew he’d won when she bit her lip.
Tony rolled his eyes and let out a sigh. Rebecca gave him a little pinch on the arm. “Don’t give me that,” she scolded, then added more gently, “You deserve consideration and tenderness, Tony. Everyone needs care.” She took a little step closer and entreated, “Promise you’ll call me?”
Steve bowed his head and Mrs. Rhodes did the same. Tony looked down, feeling a little awkward, as Steve said softly, “Bless us Oh Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thy bounty, through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.”
“Your mom?” Steve asked, surprised. (And okay perhaps a little jealous. Know enough orphans and you start to assume
Mrs. Rhodes, ever a trendsetter, started the chain of good nights. One by one, Bruce, Natasha, and Clint took their leave. Steve lingered a few moments, then waved kinda awkwardly at the couch and said, “Good night! See you tomorrow.”
They’d all taken their seats around the tree and Clint was fussing over which package to give out first.
, but . . . I—” Rogers faltered, then started again: “When you refused and I kept asking that . . . that was disrespectful of me. My behavior was inappropriate and wrong.”
“How can you joke about it!?” Rogers cried. The man floundered. He looked like he wanted to rip somebody’s arms off. “It’s—it’s—“
“Thank you, Mr. Stark.”  And the Captain smiled a gentle little smile, like being let into the workshop
Steve let Tony lead him up to his luxurious shower, kissing softly in the elevator on the way. They’d stripped each other of their sweaty clothes, still kissing, which made it a little awkward. (Steve didn’t want to stop kissing long enough to get his shirt off—it was kind of adorable.) Tony was already hard—had been since the elevator—and he could tell from the way Steve’s gaze lingered between his thighs that Steve liked that. Liked it a lot.
Bruce was still talking, the sound muffled a little now that Tony was under the adjustor.  “I hope you don’t mind me speculating about the Captain.  It did seem worth mentioning, right?”
“Some of them caught fire?” Steve said with a look of concern, then shook himself and said, “Well, these look wonderful! Thank you.”
Natasha filled Tony’s ‘I <3 NYC’ mug nearly full to overflowing and set it on the counter for him. Tony snatched it up eagerly.
The creature wasn’t dead. As soon as Cap lowered his shield and turned away, it sprang up, spinneret shooting a web that dragged Cap into its grasping four top legs. He tried to smash at it with his shield. He couldn’t get a good shot, but managed to keep the shield between him and its fangs--at least for now.
Steve’s elbows were slightly bent, his wrists clipped low on the headboard.  He gave a tiny, experimental tug, then went still.  (Is that okay?)  He looked at Tony uncertainly.
“Ms. Katzen! Your heels are fierce, but not half so much as your latest interview—took my breath away!”
“Babe, it’s ok,” Tony said. “That’s not why I was frowning. I mean, I’m not excited about telling SHIELD because they’re assholes and I have a feeling they’re gonna give us shit, but—“ He took a deep breath. “Maybe we should just tell them. Today. Get it over with. Since they’ll find out eventually and if we
Tony nodded. Rebecca’s words made him feel warm, both with embarrassment and with pleasure. “Yeah. All right,” Tony said, glancing away. “I promise.”
“Okay,” Steve said. “I just thought they might be special.” He hesitated, then began softly, “Tony, did these belong to your—“
Steve’s thoughts skittered off in a new direction, but Tony continued undeterred: “You’re always being watched, one way or another. Credit cards, cell phone, GPS, traffic cameras, google maps, all the apps—each of them just pinging your information into a vast network that knows your every move and preference, what you like to buy, and how you tend to think. Welcome to big data, Capsicle!”
“Mmmm,” Steve murmured as he nuzzled Tony’s crotch with his face, rubbing his cheek across Tony’s balls and cock.  Steve’s breath was hot against his skin.
Steve nodded.  Tony smiled and leaned up to give Steve a quick peck.  He cupped Steve’s face with one hand, caressing his cheek with his thumb.  Steve smiled and leaned into the touch, looking down at him with wide blue eyes.  Tony’s breath caught.   (So beautiful, so trusting.  Fuck, Steve.)
“You sure you don’t want to stay for breakfast?” she asked when he emerged once more wearing his sumptuous tux. Tony shook his head a little regretfully—he was eager to get home.
Rogers lifted his chin a little and looked down at Fury across the table.  “I want Iron Man for my team, sir. I realize that SHIELD has some concerns.  If Mr. Stark agrees, I propose making Iron Man a member of the Avengers immediately, with clearly delineated expectations-- the same contract you would give myself or Agent Romanov.  In the event of performance issues or breach of contract, SHEILD can remove any member of the team as required.”  Rogers paused, then added a belated, “Sir.”
I found this chapter really hard to write and I ended up deleting a lot of what I'd written and starting over.  There was originally more about the attack's various victims, but I kept making myself cry. . .
“Yeah.” Tony said, pouring himself a second cup. “I’m upgrading your body armor. I mean, all the body armor of course. So, yeah. New uniform on the way.”
“Look,” Tony said, holding out a cut-crystal tumbler, “apology accepted, I don’t hate you, so-- drink with me!”
“Looking at the final round of results Howard said, dazed—like he was in a state of shock—right in front of me, like I wasn’t even there anymore: ‘But he was supposed to change the world.’”
But as he tried to massage the tension from Tony's shoulders, they seemed to become more stiff. Tony hunched in on himself, half-ducking from under Steve's hands.
Rogers snorted. “That one has nothing to complain about. It’s still working!” He cracked a bit of a smile and shook his head. “You should see the tech they gave me at SHIELD early on. They said to be careful with it, but they kept giving me these stupid tests that pissed me off, so I pushed too hard and put my finger clean through the tablet!”
that, but suddenly I just felt . . . it felt real.”  Steve squeezed his eyes shut and felt a tear roll slowly down his cheek.  He wouldn’t move to wipe it away.
Tony took a moment to think about it—Rebecca would expect him to give the question sincere consideration. He answered decisively, feeling a little more awake, “Good. Really good.”
Bruce nodded. “Glad I could help.” He stared at the chart in silence a few moments before adding, “I—it was . . .
Tony hovered.  “Here,” he said, “You don’t need to do that.  I’ll call my cleaning crew.  They’re just downstairs and--”
Rogers allowed himself to be dragged into the elevator, murmuring a rather subdued, “All right, Mr. Stark.”
Slick, gentle fingers caressed Tony’s entrance; it sent his heart pounding at breakneck speed, all eager anticipation. But even more than that it was the rapt look on Steve’s face—so beautiful, his eyes bright and that furrow of concentration pulling at his brow.
“Guys!  Hurry up!” Clint called.  Steve and Tony joined the others in their usual seats on the vast, wide, v-shaped couch.   Natasha, Clint, and Thor on one wing, then Bruce, Tony, Steve on the next.
“Well, she was laying waste to our forests, fields, and livestock,” Steven said, “She had already killed some of our best knights and the poor king--and Bucky’d lost his arm to her--so I challenged her to a duel of wit instead.”
as a kid, whenever I could, but yeah. Anyway. Good idea to give some DC a try for once, right? Thanks, Tony.”
“Mrs. Rhodes,” Tony said, taking both her small hands in his and kissing her on each cheek as she stepped from the elevator. He made a show of studying her, then declared, “You’re more lovely every time I see you. It’s simply unfair.”
She nodded, then opened the door and stepped inside.   “I’ll see you soon, Tony,”  she added through the open window.
“And our fiscal year ended in November,” Leila reminded him. “Which you’d know if you bothered to open the mail we send you.”
Tony grabbed his tablet and propped up in bed beside his Dom. He set the brightness to low and hoped it wouldn’t wake Steve. (Seemed like a good bet, since the arc reactor’s glow hadn’t troubled him so far.)
Steve shuddered as he choked out, “You, Tony . . . you, always you. . . you . . .” Steve couldn’t get enough air, couldn’t put it into words.  (You fucking me . . . being spitted on your cock . . . pinned down, spread open . . . taken, claimed . . . ) He couldn’t hold still any longer—he jerked back and forth desperately.
“Aw yeah?” Steve asked, Brooklyn lilt coming out full force. He gave Tony a shy smile. “That’s good to know.”
The King gestured for Tony to sit first.  As the warmth of the fire poured over him, Tony felt a flicker of gratitude. It was far more comfortable here.
