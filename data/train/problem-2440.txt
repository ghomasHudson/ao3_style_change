Mrs Hudson was not home it appeared so John tugging guilty ascended the stairs his omega slave following behind. Closing the door behind them John set down the duffle and turned to kneel by his omega. Both kneeling they were closer in height but John still had nearly six inches on the boy. Seeming to notice this the boy hunched his shoulders ducking his head to make himself even smaller.
“What are you doing up there?” John wriggled so that he was on his back gazing up into his omega’s swirling grey-blue eyes.
“Are you hurt?”
The door swung open and a flurry of brown haired omega exploded out from it. Molly swept the younger omega up in a hug and squealed. Behind her stood a large grey-haired alpha. He was slightly taller than John wearing a tight t-shirt and jeans. His feet were bare and he had a kitchen towel slung over his shoulder. A tiny dark-haired pup cradled in one arm.
“Jawn!”  Sherlock’s voice carried from the bath.
Several omegas were already in the room, a pregnant female slept curled up on a purple cushion. A tiny pup, on his belly, next to her tugged on it’s sleeping mother’s trouser leg. Another omega, an older male scooped up the tiny pup hushing him softly and running fingers through the soft baby hair.
John groaned internally he just wanted to keep holding his Omega and go to sleep. Not a particularly busy day but defiantly an emotionally trying one.
How had he served this country that allowed such treatment?
New chapter kinda rushed.
Pregnant omega were constantly tired the first one or two weeks of the pregnancy and John as a Doctor didn’t worry about the seemingly random bouts of tiredness.
“How are you so perfect?”
“I wanted to say thank you”
John was saved having to answer by Sherlock’s entrance into the room. Sherlock had proudly fastened his collar onto his own neck and pulled on another of John’s oversized jumpers falling to mid-thigh with a pair of royal blue cotton pants beneath. His hair was rather tousled lips still rather red from snogging and his belly bump just visible.
The temptation in John had been feeling was put on hold as he processed those words.
Sherlock huffed sitting back on his heels.
“It’ll be alright I’ll carry you the whole time, no one will bother us okay?”
But the boy seemed to ignore the chair and instead knelt by the alpha’s side and rested his head on John’s thigh. He would have been lying if he said he didn’t like the contact of his omega on his leg, but the boy needed to eat.
“No, I don’t want another omega. Sherlock is more than enough for me.”
The omega, Sherlock, looked lost in thought a moment and then slipped onto the floor to crawl behind John.
Sorry for the delay and haste in this chapter. I ended up having to cook today and I am a bloody awful cook and made a huge mess of burnt chicken in the oven and had to start over and then had an annoyed family that would not leave me alone because it was so late before the food was finally done. (It's not like I didn't warn them, I said mum should cook and not me. But they said I needed to figure out how to cook now because my 'wife' might want a day off sometimes... lol. But I guess a husband would be just as likely to want help in the kitchen.)
“Are you saying you wish you hadn’t?” She pressed unfazed by the glaring of her brother.
“yeth Jawn”
His heat would start within the next two days maybe John would give in by then. A heat alone would be painful.
Holly was the one to break the silence. “Was Dr. John a bad alpha?”
“Yes, I want him” The beta shook her head slightly in disbelief and typed something into her phone.
“No, no one minds up here we all take care of each other and each other’s pups.”
The only reason Sherlock didn’t immediately identify the man’s gender was because there was a certain artificial blankness to his scent.
Sherlock didn’t answer instead he reached a slim hand into John’s trousers almost shyly. Thumbing at the alpha’s rapidly hardening cock Sherlock looked up through his eyelashes.
John shoveled down the mushy cardboard and water tasting food like a man possessed.
It didn’t come.
As always friendly comments, questions, or suggestion are welcome.
“No, but can you wait a few minutes?”
“I’m perfectly fine thank you, Just in need of sleep.”
“You’re welcome, Sherlock”  Pushing the bowl closer to the omega John smiled.
“I’m proud of you. Using the bathroom, and showering by yourself was very brave. You did a good job Love. Okay? You didn’t do anything wrong. I overreacted okay? I love you, Sherlock. Do you understand.”
“Yusuf, this is Sherlock. Now would you do me the honour of introducing your omega to me.”
Mike stood outside the door listening to the hushed voice of John speaking and the sounds of drawers being pulled open and clothes being pulled on. Satisfied that his friend was exiting the room Mike wandered to the kitchen to make tea.
First name: Sherlock
Friendly comments, questions, or suggestions are welcome below.
As if on cue a heavily breathing Alpha burst into the bus just as it was pulling out and cast around wildly. He was young late teens early twenties with messy brown hair and lust-crazed eyes. He inhaled deeply and stalked forwards toward the cowering female omega.
Then there had come Ryan. Evil, twisted, tying him down for days, forcing things inside him, beating him, forcing a bond, starving him, sharing him with other alpha’s and killing his pups, over and over again.
“Sherlock” he rested a hand on the omega’s back “this is Mike, an old friend of mine.”
“Afghanistan…Love, how did you know?”   The reply was a soft whimper.
It was a high honour and he would accept the honour.
“Baker Street.” The cabbie announced red-faced and sweating, “and feel free to leave that gorgeous toy of yours for a little while, he smells good probably gonna go into heat soon. I’d even pay for a turn.” The man leered his eyes hopeful and bright with lust.
Sherlock blinked looking up from John’s tray.
The omega smiled lazily and dropped off to sleep. John shifted slightly to better accommodate his knot and stroked down the black curls and soft spine tenderly. “I promise Sherlock… ”
“Er em, yes”
“A little”
The boy tensed into a tighter ball and then sighed relaxing into John’s arms.
The alpha allowed the omega to slip onto the sofa while he turned to set up the film.
“that still doesn’t explain why you were getting a slave in the first place, you’ve always been against slaves, you’ve been very vocal about it!”
“Alrighth…” the omega sighed nuzzling his face into the indentation of warmth John had left on the sofa.
Shaking his head sadly John bit back another growl. Sean seemed to be the only alpha Sherlock mentioned in a good light, in fact, he seemed rather sad and wistful when mentioning the deceased man.
Hands shaking Sherlock wiped his eyes in the mirror. Black madrassa ran down his cheeks in rivers. His lips puffy and red, eyes tear bright. In all honesty, he looked rather stunning. Shaking his head the boy scrubbed his face clean and hastily replied his eye make-up.
“Thank you Jawn” “No, don’t say that sick.” The alpha growled.  “I am never punishing you again… It’s inhumane”
“When I’m bad.” The boy corrected himself. “Like when I didn’t pick up my bookth and you had to punith me.”
He folded the items over his arms and entered the bedroom.
“Yeah?” The boy cocked his head to the side, confused.
“How old are you?”
“Love you have to, I’ll just be a floor away and you’ll be safe here. “ the alpha reassured.
He shouldn’t have left Sherlock all alone up there the poor boy was probably terrified.
“Hush love, it’s not bye. I’ll see you later.” Sherlock closed his eyes tightly squeezing the life out of his backpack and bee not wanting to see the alpha leave.
The tiny beta shoved a tiny fist into his mouth and waved his other hand in the air.
“Not tonight” John repeated. “I just want to hold you tonight.”
Long pale fingers twitched every so often and he could practically feel the slave vibrating with discomfort.
“I am getting ready to leave, per your inthruction”  Sherlock spoke almost haughtily an eyebrow-raising.
John stopped reading.
“It’s fine. Now get up this floor is filthy.”
“No, don’t take me away from Jawn”
Bowing his head over the violin the boy’s shoulders hitched once and then twice his body shaking in silent tears.
Sorry for the delay I've attended two interviews for schools today and was pretty knackered. I didn't proof read this chapter but I'm posting anyway. Friendly comments, questions, or suggestions are always welcome.
The blond practically yanked the boy off his feet and high up in his arms scenting the boy’s neck possessively.
“Can we go to the storage locker tomorrow? It’s been a long day and I really just want to eat something and lay in bed.”
John snatched his keys and wallet off the counter, checked to see if Sherlock still had his mobile and scooping up the omega backpack and all flew down the stairs out the front door and straight into the cab.
He could walk now, a bit unsteadily and he still held tightly onto John’s hand but Sherlock was able to stand on his own two feet.
Tender pale hands stroked him through the intense aftershock, and pink lips swallowed everything he had to give only the slightest bit of white overflowing on the corner of his mouth. John laid back on the bed panting the tiny omega still between his trembling legs.
“N-noth-nothing I-I don’t know” the boy continued crying and nuzzled into John’s stomach.
“I will be here brother mine.”
“Watson!” her nasally voice shouted without warning causing Sherlock to jump and whimper and John to glare at her. Walking into the door indicated John held a protective arm around his omega. Sherlock for his part was overwhelmed the scents of so many newly bonded couples lingered on every object, clinging to the brown wallpaper, and rising up from the ugly carpet.
“Jawn, Pleathe, breed me.” He gasped heat already taking over his mind his body needing to be refilled by the knot.  The blond smiled sleepily and circled his hips lazily thrusting into the omega slowly.
“Brilliant observation …?”
“Alright John, can I call you John?”
“One called me Peth” The boy had a lisp not uncommon to omegas who had been raised as slaves from a young age.
John kept his voice steady.
“Then why’d you plead guilty Johnny?”
“Alright. Okay, love.”
The girl whimpered pressing her face into John’s calf. Sherlock was ridged in the blond’s arms hiding his face in the striped jumper.
“Good?”
“Sherlock?”
“Get off of me!” Sherlock wriggled fruitlessly, panic beginning to flit in his eyes.
“Do you need anything else,love?” The muscular alpha murmured into the cuddling omega’s ear.
“Andre?” Sherlock smiled softly and nodded his head towards the smallest of the litter in Greg’s arms.
“I wish I had something that would fit you better but I guess what you’ve got on now will have to work.” The alpha sighed eyeing the too large red jumper, shorts, and huge grey socks.
Sherlock yelped sinking his teeth lightly into the muscle on John’s thigh as Molly pressed slightly too hard on a bruise.
Sherlock licked his lips but didn’t bend down as John had expected instead the boy stood and stripped out of John’s Jumper and the tight black pants teasingly. Then turning his back to John bent over to tug off his socks giving his alpha an unhindered view of his pale plush arse and winking pink hole.
“No!” The boy flinched. “I mean no, I’ll clean them up, you, you go wash your face. “
“Yeah love, come on I’ll show you how I make it.”
This time when John rested his hand on the boy’s trembling form Sherlock allowed it.
“That was amazing…” John gasped. “Come up here”
The scream to mount the boy was deafening.
Sherlock writhed in pleasure keening brokenly, face collapsing into the mattress and screaming in pleasure. The moment the swollen knot locked them together the boy shouted and came John biting deep into the back of his neck and pumping the omega full with his seed.
Walking was out of the question unless ordered to do so. It would hurt like hell to even stand, when John had ordered him to stand at the auction house he had been forced to bite back a yelp of pain.
Outside of the courthouse, the three sat on the stone steps waiting for the girl (whose name turned out to be Abby)’s brother. An omega resting on both knees John stared up at the sky awkwardly. Sherlock seemed to have been rendered mute and the girl was following the basic understanding of do not speak unless spoken to.
So enraptured was John in the omega beneath him that he didn’t hear Mike barge into the flat in his usual careless manner and fling open the bedroom door.
Laying on his stomach Sherlock felt more exposed knowing there was little to nothing he could do to escape an attack in this position. John’s warm calloused hands rubbed in his curls and let him relax.
“Sherlock, look at me.”
His omega, his beautiful clever omega. John lay the omega down on his queen sized bed and brushed silky curls from his glazed eyes.
John’s eyes snapped open the moment his alarm went off. He instinctively turned his head to Sherlock’s side of the bed to be met with the sight of a wet marble white back.  Water droplets rolled gently down the boy’s contours and spine and across the plush arse.
John stared eyes wide at the picture presented to him.
The large alpha buried his head between Sherlock’s thighs licking up the shining slick with a greedy tongue. Making the boy’s toes curl in embarrassment and pleasure.
John waved a hand at the sofa. The omega crawled and sat dutifully in front of the piece of furniture.
John held onto those pale hips roughly thrusting into the tight wet heat above him. Sherlock was so tight almost painfully as he clenched down on John’s cock greedily.
“Ther- Ther- Sherlock”
“I’m sorry?” The blond looked up from his tray.
“Waiting for you, mathter? Mathter thaid to wait…” the young man sounded puzzled how could his alpha not know what he was doing?
“Oh, pity. I thought there was perhaps an excuse for your poor grammar.”
Rubbing his thumb in circles over Sherlock’s thigh John tried to soothe the boy.
“Yes in self-defense! And in defense of every other man and woman, he thought he could put his hands on.”
John grunted and hummed when required answering questions with generic, “I see” or “not really” s.
“That’s not fine, and I intend to feed you multiple times every day. Besides you hardly ate last night you have to be hungry.”
“Yeth Jawn.”
List of Owners
“I would know Jawn! I need my punishment, pleathe… Ju-J-Just be careful of the pups.”
The boy was suddenly awake flinching back from the blond and rising to a sitting position.
“You misunderstand, the process of digestion slows my mental prowess. My transport reverts energy to the digestion system rather than the mind leaving me impaired.”
“Hmmm?” John rushed forwards not understanding the worry he was feeling over the omega’s comfort.
“Do you love me when I’m bad?” The voice was muffled but John could still hear every word.
“Jawn!” Sherlock protested as John seized his legs pulling them over the alpha shoulders and burying his face in the crotch of Sherlock’s pajama trousers and inhaled deeply.
Sherlock sat stiffly in John’s lap the entire train ride hugging his bee and never quite relaxing. He wore a royal blue button-down shirt over black jeans with John’s spare coat swallowing up his small frame. The new collar shone pridefully around his neck
Sorry again for the delay mum got mad at me and I ended up having to stay at my Dad and his husband's flat a few days and forgot to bring my lap-top.
“He’s 33, I jutht was placed with him yethterday, he fed me latht night, and hath yet to ‘fuck me’ as you so crudely phrased it. Thecondly, I am not a child I am fully physically mature and you are only a few yearth older than me so you may stop acting as if you were my mother.  Thirdly it has come to light that my birth name is Sherlock and lathtly why ever did you change your lipthtick?”
Twenty minutes, more time to prepare than most had given him.
“How long have you been with John?”
“Stand up” he hadn’t meant for it to sound like a command but it did all the same.
The guards would step forwards to unchain his hands from the table.
A middle-aged middle-eastern alpha and a thin somewhat familiar-looking red-haired omega in his mid 20’s.
Sherlock, however, seems unfazed nuzzling into John’s chest in his sleep his soft scent warm and content.
“Mrs H please! He was given to me. I need the stuff please Mrs Hudson He’ll be starting his heat soon within the next 24 hours!”
The alpha forced his emotions down, crying was not going to help his omega.
The blond clung to his omega dampening the boy’s bond mark with his tears.
Half asleep he felt John lifting him up and carrying him into a room he had not yet seen.
'One of the ‘murderers’ you are referring to' this slight boy with big eyes pink lips and the face of an angel had killed a man.
Sherlock clutched John’s thigh and sniffed, the boy lay face down over the plush green sofa’s cushions pale backside bared. The flawless marble flesh was now mottled blue and purple a skin broken in one place.
“Obviously they can. And it appears they don’t care about uni at this point.”
“Jawn I need y-you! ” The omega was writhing now in the nest, rutting against the soft fabrics, arse clenching desperately for something to fill it.
Sherlock clung to his plush bee chewing nervously on his thumb's nail. As John tried to sit him down from resting on his hip the omega whinged burying his face in the alpha’s white coat.
“Please, I’d like to talk to you before you see that.”
And choked at the sight that met him.
“Sherlock…” he paused throat swelling with emotion. “Love, I’m not going to punish you… I don’t even know what you think you need punishing for!”
“Posture, you stand at parade rest and sit with your back straight. When we sat you chose a seat in which you could see the entire room. Also the RAMC tattoo on your bicep.”
Sherlock perked up at the sight having expected something more like the kennels Ryan had left him in during business trips.
“Okay,” the boy had yet to open his eyes and did so lazily his green silver eyes half-lidded.
“It’s nothing Mrs H, he has been badly abused, new people seem to make him nervous.”
“Master Thean let me netht but that was before I had heat. He said I could whenever I wanted, even if I wathn’t old enough for heat yet. ”
The boy whimpered curling in on himself and letting his naked back face John as the two alpha guards roughly clamped a lead on the leather collar. John’s alpha fought to bite back a growl when one smacked the omega’s bare arse with the lead.
“Piss off”
Heritage: French/English
John scrubbed a hand arcos his mouth distastefully the stuff was gross.
It wasn’t normal to wait.
“Collar”  was the omega’s only response. “What? No!” Sherlock shrunk deeper into the couch.
A tall man with dark skin and a crooked smile was the boldest, he reached forward seizing Sherlock’s arm and pulling the boy flush against him.
Even with the doctor’s slow movements John’s still felt his hackles raise as the alpha’s latex clothes finger gently probed inside of Sherlock. The boy whimpering was the only thing that brought him back to focus.
John stepped back, confused and stared down at the wide blinking eyes. The girl's dark eyes were filled with terror her clothes ripped as if she had been grabbed and just barely escaped.
“Jawn?”
“I don’t want to go.”  The alpha only half-joked.
“This is freezing!” Sherlock complained teeth chattering under the shower head’s steady stream.
He’d put those pups there and his omega was carrying them. A side effect of the pregnancy was while the boy didn’t have heat he was in an almost constant state of arousal. While John didn’t dislike the omega’s attentions he knew it would get more difficult tomorrow when at the surgery.
“Yeth Jawn” the omega breathed. “I don’t want to do this…” the alpha bit his lip angry at himself. He only was required to punish the omega until they were legal equals and if everything went according to plan that should be by the end of the day.
“Woah Woah Woah,” the brunet backed away slowly. “Fine you don’t share guess I’ll find one somewhere else.”
“Auction house.”  He bit out.
Friendly comments, questions, or suggestions are welcome below.
“s’lock? Whaaaat are you doing?” John spoke through a massive yawn. The omega bowed his head further bitting at his trembling lip.
Eyes: Grey
Being an omega his body produced it’s own lubricant but both unprepared and outside of heat it could hurt. Sherlock liked John so far, he didn’t want it to hurt, it would remind him too much of Ryan. The omega propped himself up tugging off the robe and neatly laying it over the end of the bed. Reaching down with practised ease the omega began preparing himself with clinical detachment.
He promised to never sell the boy, he taught Sherlock music, asking the omega to spend hours a day on the violin until he perfected it. He promised to bond with the omega once he hit his first heat, he never raised a hand in anger against Sherlock unless he had been particularly disobedient. In truth, if there was a master Sherlock had truly loved it had been Sean.
Sherlock slept the entire time it took for John to load up the few boxes and didn’t wake until the couple was pulling up at baker street. Sleepily the boy waved his hand at a random red haired omega man trailing behind his alpha and smiled. The omega did not smile back but did wave back eyebrows furrowed.
“You get in any fights?” and as always he would answer…
“Thank you, thank you so much” the man babbled at John. “I don’t know how to repay you.”
John spoke slowly carefully placing each word.
Sherlock nodded.
Placing one large hand over top of the ever so small baby curve on the raven haired omegas stomach he hummed. This pup would be strong healthy and loved.
It was so predictable it might as well have a script. Next, she would ask.
He wasn’t disappointed, the thin omega crawled forwards placing his arse between John’s spread legs and snuggling back into the alpha making a small noise of contentment as John tucked the blanket over both of them.
“Sherlock  lay over my lap.” The alpha had both legs firmly planted on the floor. Whimpering the omega obeyed, his stomach was flat still slightly concave but a warm thrumming against the alpha’s thigh left no doubts to the new life forming within.
“It seems a previous alpha bonded with him when he was very young before he was capable of heats and only triggered the emotional bond rather than a physical one.”
“Two years more” Sherlock whispered. “I had pups, two beautiful pups, Mia and Alex. He kept me until they didn’t need a mother and then sold me back.”
The blond alpha growled stomping away from the desk and back to his mate. He once again scooped up the omega and stormed from the building ignoring the stares.
“Well his real name is Sherlock but yes”
The couple exited to be met with the worried stare of the beta woman. Not seeing any visible marks of abuse the woman relaxed deflating slightly when John sat his selection down.
The omega rubbed a hand over his concave stomach he couldn’t let it happen again. No one would kill his pups, even if that meant running away and most likely being killed for it. No one would touch his pups if he were to ever to have them.
John didn’t miss the trembling, or the shiver of fear when he touched the omega. Forcing his alpha down he struggled to speak.
“Why would he want that?”
John was angry with himself now, he knew how typical alpha/omega relationships worked and he knew that holding an omega’s head underwater was not an uncommon punishment, often used on omega’s who had drunk without permission.
Placing a hand on the boy’s rounded belly John grin widened the tiny life inside thrummed happily.
“Jawn” the omega whispered still hazy on hormones and rolled on his side to face the alpha.
Four-year-old Jeremiah gently took Andre from Sherlock’s arms and followed the larger Holly up the stairs as she held a pup in each arm.
Still, John used a finger to stuff his seed back into Sherlock’s puffy hole and pulled the omega’s trousers back up from around his knees.
John threw his blanket off his head and sat upright.
Sherlock continued to pout as John’s laughed died down into a snicker.
“It’th fine Jawn you only have to feed me every 24 hourth.”
Except for this time his cell wasn’t empty.
Guilty.
The bulging muscles of the blond alpha were soon hidden underneath a black and white striped jumper that Sherlock quickly deemed his favorite. Before the blond could fully shimmy into his pants however Sherlock had dropped to his knees nuzzling the large alpha cock into hardness.
The kiss remained slow and tender and when John’s tongue asked for entrance Sherlock didn’t hesitate to allow the gentle probing with a low moan of pleasure. The pheromones of happy omega and alpha drenched the air. Gently John trailed his fingers across the sharp bone structure of Sherlock's face and hummed contentedly into the younger man’s mouth.
Curling his right arm around the boy’s waist the blond continued to eat ignoring the clatter of the noisy canteen around them.
An omega pressing themselves against your knot was insanely arousing the kissing of his hand more so.
“Are you certain? I must warn you this one is particularly clingy”
Additional Notes: Extraordinarily clingy: dislikes being alone  Disobedient, has been known to talk without permission, has been know to sleep without permission, often makes eye contact, has been known to drink without permission, has refused medical drugs, has once struck an alpha in claimed self-defence. Becomes overly attached to pups acts out after termination of each litter.
The raven-haired-omega looked puzzled and nearly trampled the older freckled omega in his lurching forward to scent him.
John barked a laugh that made the other prisoner jump. “Sorry try again”
Greg stepped closer and John growled.
And without fail the woman would lie and say.
“Just come and shower with me tonight. Alister showers in the morning I’ll try and keep the others at bay. I’m no Alister but most people listen to me.”
Friendly comments, questions, or suggestions are more than welcome!
“Don’t want to” the omega mumbled into John’s neck and then froze suddenly awake.
“Abby!” He made a grab for his sister and smelling the family bond John allowed it. The girl keened and hugged her brother tightly.
“I found your name.”
“Yeah, cheers mate,” John called Mike swiftly shut the door behind him.
The petite blond woman across the table from him barely flinched at the outburst of shouting.
The green-blue eyes quickly met Mike’s only to drop away and lean closer to John.
“I promise, Love”
Considering the bags of stuff they obtained at the shop John had hailed a cab and was now resting thankfully in the backseat with Sherlock curled around both the plush bee and John. This cabby was a beta and the fact that Sherlock was clean and that John had fixed him with a glare killed any protests he would have had at an omega being in the cab rather than the boot.
John groaned throwing his arm across the mattress to tug his mate closer. Instead, he was met only with cold sheets.
Which means this man was most likely an alpha, beta’s would have no need to hide their scent, even around newly bonded couples. An alpha, on the other hand, would put him or herself at great risk.
“I see”
Burying his face deeper into John’s chest the boy nodded and John felt sick.
Birthdate: Unknown estimated January-March 2002
Biting his lip and nodding his head the muscular alpha dashed back up the stairs.
Suddenly the alpha was wide awake he shot up sitting bolt upright.
Friendly comments, questions, or suggestions are welcome below.
Unfazed Sherlock didn’t even flinch continuing on with his explanation of some chemical experiment that John was baffled to even think about.
John just stared at his cellmate.
“You said ‘I’m a doctor’ which is false, you are presumably in here for murder which revokes your license. You are no longer a doctor. Therefore the correct word is ‘was’ ”
Not only shocking but how did he manage it? The boy was as thin as a rail and looked to be about John’s height.
“Sure thing, meters still running though.”
Swallowing thickly John moved the omega from his lap ignoring the whine of protest.
“yeth, Jawn”
Sherlock cradled the tiny pup to his chest gently rocking the baby in his arms he was so emerged with studying the delicate facial construction that he failed to notice John’s approach until Mark nudged him.
“Fifteen”
“Shhhhhh it’s okay” John soothed laying a hand on the boy’s knee. “Can you show me why you can’t talk?” The boy calmed at John’s words and reached hesitantly towards the collar at his throat. For the first time, John paid attention to the leather strap and felt his alpha blood boil.
With a sigh, John slung the duffle securely around his good shoulder and scooped the tiny omega up awkwardly. Reaching the lobby John paused at the exit desk. And setting the thin body down plucked up the keys for the chains and a generic pair of grey joggers provided with his purchase of an omega.
John Watson twenty-eight had been a resident of block 23 for the past two years, three months, one week, and 5 days.
He was sleepy and sated from last night, the omega hadn’t even been aware he could orgasam as much as he did the night before.
“John dear, whatever is wrong?” Before he could answer the chatty beta went on “and what was all the shouting a few minutes ago!”
“Sweet boy.” John murmured rubbing his hand over his omega’s neck and lower back.
The blond took the soft fabric with shaking hands and ever so gently fastened the buckle.
“No, ah shit, no Sherlock, love. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
The alpha returned to the bedroom and re-exited through the door with the small omega on his hip, pale arms and legs twined around the alpha.
“WHAT?!! WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN’T MARRY HIM?”
“What?”
Sherlock shifted again pressing his thighs together and trying to catch John’s eye. The blond was, however, staring at a rack of soft furled leather collars intently.
He hoped he was right.
Tomorrow he’d be back at the surgery and John supposed he’ll have to bring Sherlock along. It wouldn’t be wise to leave the boy alone. Not while the boy was pregnant and the bonding papers had not yet been finalized.
Horrified John stepped backward slamming his back into the doorjamb.
“Yeah love, John. You done with that?” The raven-haired omega handed over his empty mug.
It would have to work until later when he would have time to read the omega’s file.
“You are a complete wanker”
“Oh imagine your boy fucking her while I fucked him. Oh - wow. Come on how much?”
“JAAAWWN!”
“SHIT” John’s trembling hand instead reached forward and Sherlock flinched at the contact.
“Yes, love even then”
“Love, Sherlock?” The boy’s head arched into the hand “hmm?” Came the sleepy reply.
Understanding dawned.
He was still a boy. He could pass for as young as 16 but considering his placement in the room had to be at least 18.
“Molly!” Sherlock wrapped his limbs tighter around John as he spoke drawing the attention to himself.
The omega stiffened. “Yeth Jawn” he whispered.
“Then what were you asking? Is it important or can I proceed to suck-“
It shouldn’t have been so surprising honestly he WAS in prison. But somehow John had been picturing something more deserving of an asbo being blown out of proportion by strict parents or even housebreaking.
The kitchen also was empty. Thundering down the stairs John nearly trampled Mrs. Hudson.
Dark soft leather, lined with navy blue satin and a silver clasp. Sherlock was actually excited to wear a collar for once. This one was far more comfortable than the rough leather and rusty buckle of the free one provided by the auction house.
“Alright. I’ll help you to the loo then we can get this sorted before breakfast. Okay?” The curly head dipped slightly.
Friendly comments, questions or suggestions are welcome.
The alpha HAD offered to carry him.
Sherlock obeyed without question squeaking rather loudly when his entire pale length was swallowed by his alpha.
“Jawn Pleathe!” Sherlock braced himself for the next hit.
“I’d say you look right knackered.”
“No your cock! Your knot Jawn Pleathe!”
The dark-skinned doctor growled in frustration muttering under his breath before smiling tersely a moment.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully before turning his eyes back down to the small beta.
When the pair made their way to the clothing area the omega perked up considerably even reaching out to trail his fingers over the proffered fabrics and smiling uncertainly at his alpha from time to time. John noticed the omega cleaning towards richer colours and soft fabrics. The omega’s particular favourite seemed to be a soft warm purple sweater that The omega had nuzzled his face into and then, in turn, offered the sleeve for John to rub against.
The alpha skipped the groin area in favour of doing what would most likely be the worst last and examined the torso of his omega, concave stomach and prominent heavily bruised ribs, miraculously nothing broken, the omega’s neck would need tending something to stop the swelling and a salve to heal the skin.
John furrowed his brow ignoring the nuzzling of his mate in favour of thought.
“What you think I’m going to hurt him? Me?”
“Holy — “ the alpha sighed. What was he supposed to do? Sherlock was right, it was the law and he was literally begging for some sort of punishment.
John watched his omega eating and a low growl of pleasure hummed in his throat. The boy needed food, he needed meat on his bones. When the boy was almost through his bowl John decided to tell him he had found his name.
“I am in you,” John smirked wriggling his fingers teasingly deep inside the boy’s arse.
John pulled his omega into a hug.
Molly hushed her quietly as John shifted in his seat unsure how to respond.
“Us?”
“Thank you alpha Lestrade for allowing us to come.”
Sherlock whimpered above him, his face flushed in embarrassment.
“That’s not what people normally say.”
John himself wanted to be sick he also wanted to tear the two alphas apart. The marble pale back was plastered in makeup but even that couldn’t hide the deep grooves cut into the skin, the harsh raised scars.
Nothing big or fancy as he doubted the omega could hold much at the moment. As the water boiled John opened the duffel they had given him curiously.
“Jawn yeth, it’s the law and I need you to … Pleathe?” John felt his throat tighten and he gave a curt nod.
So yeah this is insanely short and thats because I don't have anything else written yet its sorta just a teaser and tbh I don't know if anyone will even read it considering how long it's been. I need to read through everything I wrote and get a better feel for the story because right now I feel sorta akaward and I don't really remember much about how I wrote it.
“I’m not entirely certain, our Sire sold you off as soon as mother would allow. He wasn’t pleased with the fact that she had been impregnated by another alpha. You served as a reminder to that fact.”
“Was”
“You are such a tease.” John moaned as the boy rocked back against him.
Recovered February 2009 -severe internal tearing, concussion, multiple broken bones.
Friendly comments, questions, or suggestions are always welcome!
Hailing a cap John placed their order on his mobile and handed the man a few extra notes to allow Sherlock to sit in the cab.
Sherlock shook his curls and smashed his face deeper into John’s chest.
The blond sunk down to the floor and reached for his omega, his heartbreaking when the boy recoiled, scooting backward on the cold tile.
“Mornin’”
“You thould wear your thriped jumper tonight”
Great sobs were heaving through Sherlock’s chest his worry of running mascara long gone. Though John had said fifteen the belt had just landed it’s twenty-third stroke. About halfway through the first 15, John had lost any trace of hesitance and the scent of his anger and frustration coloured the air.
the words chanted in his head. He stepped forward and rested a gentle hand on the flank of pale arse.
He didn’t want to do this. He really didn’t want to do this. But it was either this or dragging the young man through the street. He went around to the boot and popped it open his omega wordlessly dragged himself up and into the small space. John couldn’t bring himself to shut the lid and leave the poor man in darkness. Fumbling in his pocket he pulled out a miniature torch and flicked it on.
John carded a hand through silky curls as the alpha worked, and relaxed visibly when the man removed his hands.
Self-defense.
“W. Sherlock S. Holmes”
“We need to go around to the shops and get some things before your heat alright?”
“I’m thorry I know he’th not my mather anymore but…”
“Pleathe stop, Pleathe!” Sherlock pleaded as another teeth chattering strike pulsed through his body spreading red hot waves of pain through his sensitive arse and exposed aching private parts.
John bristled at the thought a low growl building deep in his throat.
“You were military.” John looked up sharply to catch the boy staring unabashedly as John’s abs. Sherlock flushed and looked away.
That was something people said about dogs. His alpha was practically bursting but he couldn’t let it free now, not while it was so enraged. If he were to slip he would be on his omega in an instant. Claiming him, bonding him, breeding him, he didn’t want to force himself on the omega. No matter how badly John wanted the younger man he couldn’t allow himself to force a bond.
“No,” John spoke levelly. “Sit up properly, It wouldn’t matter if I were shorter than you. I wouldn’t have you punishing yourself over something you can’t control.” The young man whimper and slowly unrolled his shoulders to sit upright and avoid looking John in the eyes.
Friendly comments, question, or suggestions are welcome below!
Without hesitation, the large alpha handed the tiny pup to the omega.
Small pink cock bouncing in time with John’s thrusts the boy whined all of it too much and yet not enough. Sherlock reached to grab his own cock but his hands were batted away by John.
Oh, how he wanted the strong alpha to carry him in his arms again. It had felt so safe and this Alpha hadn’t made the carrying remotely sexual. Which made it all the more pleasurable to the omega. But no, he couldn’t ask for the alpha to carry him.
“So what happened why were you returned?”
Pressing one last kiss to the boy’s motionless plush lips John settled himself laying covering the omega’s small body covering every inch of the boy’s body with his own.
I really do try and add what people want, give me suggestions!
Grimacing at his own actions John fastened the hateful leather collar back around the omegas neck loosely enough that Sherlock could have fit his entire hand between the collar and his bruised neck.
“He likes you,” Mark eased himself down on the green cushion beside the pair.
“No buts about it, if this poor boy has been in an auction house he’ll need to know he is allowed to do things on his own. He needs to be treated like he has a choice.”
“Correct brother-mine’”
“Oh,” Sherlock wriggled on the hard plastic bench. “I don’t think they’d care. They wouldn’t expect an Alpha to notice them.”
“Third”
The storage facility they ended up at was huge and far posher than John had expected.
“Heart attack, I wath nine had no idea what happened. Took two dayth till thomeone found uth.”
He was both terrified and eager to please his Alpha. John had been gentle so far, but so had Aaron.
John considered a moment before shaking his head
If only Sherlock was as able to spring back from the abuse he’d suffered.
“I don’t have what you want.” He laughed gently brushing his hand through the pup’s thick curls.
And everyone who knew an iota of John Hamish Watson wouldn’t doubt that he had a damn good reason for shooting Major Moran. Unfortunately, the blond seemed to feel something different about his actions.
Sherlock looked up from picking at his foam plate and raised his brows in confusion.
“Okay, that’s all done. I’ll write everything up and you will get a call when everything goes through the system. Until then you can’t leave the omega I mean Sherlock alone in a building or send him out of the house. He will need to stay with you as any alpha claiming him will most likely be able to sway the law in their favour without legal documents proving a bond between the two of you.”
He was such an idiot!!!!!!!!!!!
John had walked to the auction house but he had no intent on dragging the half-starved omega the entire walk to Baker Street.
“Love I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have punished you like that, I’m not a good alpha I’m supposed to take care of you not hurt you, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”
The blond alpha sighed heavily through his nose.
“I’ll be eighteen in three months they didn’t want to bother with the hassle of transferring me.”
Sloppy wet kisses covered the alpha’s face as the omega sobbed outrageously clutching John’s beetles tee.
Kneeling up Sherlock found himself face to … head with John’s penis.  A few men whistled or catcalled.
“Brother…” Sherlock rolled the word around in his mouth.
“Bleeding?”
John paused seventeen year age difference…that was quite a lot for a free bonding. But many slave omega bonds were even older in age gaps sometimes as much as fifty years.
“Do you think I could use thome… some- some…” he faltered and ducked his head with a blush.
The boy continued to stare at his nails and John sighed, grumbling under his breath about death wishes.
The boy was relaxed humming slightly to show he understood but not moving from John’s shoulder.
Sherlock cowered backward further into John’s arms and shook his head.
The omega jumped, whimpered, and cowered in the sofa corner before seeing John. And relaxed quickly after spotting the alpha, though he still looked slightly nervous.
“Jawn?”
Molly had frozen the dish she was holding hovering a few centimeters from resting on the table. Greg stood his stance protective over the thin omega. Sherlock for his part stood very still as if the yelp could be taken back from not moving.
“Doctor Watson, or Captain Watson”
“Most not,”
This alpha his new master John was watching him carefully with a smile which was rather unnerving.
The blond paused soaping his chest to look up. Three or four men were already staring, one lazily pulling on his cock, eyes fixed on the teenager.
He realised with a start. He was a slave owner, something he had never wanted to be. Two muscular men alphas dressed in the black uniform of slave handlers grabbed the boy from the cage by either arm literally dragging the limp form to John and dropping it in a heap at his feet.
The small boy rushed into the sitting room to see where John had fallen flat on the floor after tripping over a stack of Sherlock’s books.
John ruffled his short blond hair in frustration as he entered the room. Sherlock sat in the far end of the tub expectantly his curls straightening from the heavy weight of the water.
“Pleathe, in black”
“What are you doing down there?”
“No Jawn, they thaid it wath thupid.” Sherlock confided matter of factly as he steadily drank the chocolate drink.
Mia A. Weathers,  4 pounds four ounces, Gender: alpha  Sex: female Hair: Red Eyes: grey. Length: 15 inches.
He wasn’t bulky just pleasantly defined.
John settled on the loveseat's left side (closer to the door.) with his legs spread and back straight in the perfect picture of dominance and aggression. Having his newly bound omega around so many strange scents were stamping on his nerves.
“Now this one?” John tapped a silver locker door and with Sherlock’s nod entered the code.
“I’m going to wash your hair.”
“Oh” John flopped onto his stomach and looked sideways at the boy. “Why?”
“Alright Doctor, So it says here that this is your first bonding. Is that accurate?”
John stroked the curls and faced the dark-haired man.
“He wants to have sex with me?” The dark-haired boy looked utterly confused.
“mghmmh Jawn?” The boy moaned into his neck throwing a slender arm over the solider’s chest.
Alarmed John rushed forwards and gently removed the case from the boy’s lap. Tugging his omega into his arms John held him tightly and resting his chin on the silky strawberry shampoo scented curls.
“Drink this” John pressed one mug into the pale hands, “slowly” The man searched John’s eyes momentarily and dropped his gaze.
Not much he could do physically to kill someone unless it was a woman… or a child. His blood ran cold and he found himself scooting farther back in his bunk.
Sherlock broke away from Molly to kneel at Greg’s feet.
“Love, I was the one who was bad there, I’ve told you I shouldn’t have reacted that way.”
“Fuck...you’re already soaking for me.”
John sighed at the answer he had deduced as much but to hear from his omega’s mouth was somehow sobering.
Returned: February 2019
Sherlock leapt up quickly after tanking a second to return the pup to his mother.
Bought: December 2018 - Aaron M. Green
John felt a hitch in his throat. “I’m not going to call you ‘puppy’.”
He had every right to punish his omega, most would say he was being soft by not having punished the boy already. So why was he hesitating?  Shaking his head the blond tugged down both jeans and pants in one movement barring the trembling omega’s arse to the cool air.
“Okay”
John looked up at that, he hadn’t even checked to see if he had injured the omega, and with as hard as he had been hitting the boy there was a good possibility he had broken the skin. How had he not thought to check?
“Sherlock” Molly’s voice was soft and mothering. “Sweetheart please talk to us”
His first thought was that there must be a mistake. The man laying on the bed opposite of his wasn’t even a man.
“Oh.”
Returned October 2018
“Oh dear, John? What is it? Is he alright?”
“I said go sit and wait for me. I didn’t mean kneel uncomfortably on the floor. You can sit there”
“You also have glanced at my arse no leth than 23 times thince we arrived home and my lipth nearly twithe that many timeth”
He would grunt.
“Fine”. The alpha rolled his eyes, of course, he’d gotten one of those freaky omega activists “This will be Sherlock’s second bonding then?”
I am so so sorry that was forever since I updated but my mum and step-dad went to the country this weekend so my boyfriend sayed over while they were gone and I didn't reall yhave time to write. Anyway here's the new chapter!
John gave the young man a small but genuine smile and moving slowly tugged off the oversized jumper leaving the boy naked again.
“Extra time for this,”  the raven-haired-boy gently cupped John’s overly interested cock and gave it a single teasing stroke.
“John, John Watson” The alpha stuck out a hand without thinking and was surprised when the omega shook it. Again it was unusual for an omega to make contact of any sort with an alpha not their own.
‘Well that was agonizing to watch, now tilt your head back.”
Disgusting.
“Your - Your clothes I want your scent in my netht pleathe.”
“He doesn’t have a family alpha, Mrs Hudson. He doesn’t have a family. He’s from the auction house.”
John flinched internally when noticed the scar of an unwanted, and later broken bond as a doctor he knew what a consensual bond mark looked like, this wasn’t one of them. The fact that another Alpha had bread, bonded and knotted HIS omega made the alpha in him scream to mount the boy right then.
Bonded: April 2013- Ryan L. Weathers
“I will be right back I’m just going downstairs alright?”
“After love, I need you to eat first. You gotta keep you and who knows how many pups fed.”
“yeth, Jawn.”
Nothing.
On the bus, John stood holding his omega close despite the multiple empty seats. A small female omega with dark cocoa skin and a headful of crisp curls entered the bus alone running frantically sat down on the floor beneath John’s feet pressing against his legs and whimpered.
“Sherlock.” The alpha’s firm hand pressed against the boy’s back in a gentle reminder.
“Love?”
Murder? No had not even been on his radar.
Mike went to retrieve the mugs while John settled both himself and the omega on the sofa. Placing two mugs within John’s reach Mike settled on one of the two armchairs and waited. The fear scent making the omega decidedly less appealing to the weaker alpha.
“Wednesday at thix?”
“Nothing much, just admiring the view” the blond smirked and dipped his head down to lick across on pale arse cheek.
“But-“
John let his gaze drift over the malnourished frame through the bars the alpha and doctor in him both bristling at the clear outline of ribs and concave stomach.
“Yeth Jawn “
Glancing at the sleeping mother Sherlock hesitated.
John burst out laughing slapping the table once and giggling hysterically. Sherlock rose his eyebrow again and then stuck out his lip in a pout.
That had been nearly two hours ago and the thin omega was still talking quietly to Molly and listening attentively to her words.
John growled lowly in his throat his arousal instantly making itself evident.
“No, love” John reassured pulling the flushed omega to his t-shirt clad chest.
“You were a doctor.” The boy explained examining his cuticles.
“I did rugby myself,”
Still grinning and battling arousal the alpha gathered some of his softest t-shirts and jumpers and passed them to the omega, who then proceeded to tuck the articles of clothing around the nest.
“He up for sale? Do you rent?”
“But not the omega’s?”
“Your alpha’s here”
Glad of the fact he had worn a shirt beneath his jumper the alpha tugged off his oatmeal coloured cloth and pulled it gently over the omega’s shocked expression. The jumper was huge on the thin boy falling to cover the tops of his thighs and hanging over his fingertips. Smiling sadly John rose to his feet and due to the aching of his shoulder, allowed the boy to crawl behind him.
A thin manual listing the rules of owning an omega which basically equated to don’t kill them unless necessary, don’t free them, and other things like wearing collars in public, not making eye contact with alphas. A much thicker manual nearly four times the size listed punishments and gave detailed explanations on how to carry them out. Disgusted John promptly dropped the punishment book in the trash. A leather riding crop and whip also joined the punishment book in the trash. Lastly in the bag were both an orange file and a rough grey dressing gown embroidered with the slaves so old and used it was hardly more than a rag, this also he tossed in the trash.
Sherlock nodded seriously and keened as John buried a hand in his curls.
“I am truly sorry brother mine. And John?”
“Well, I-“
“I love you and I care about you. Why would I ever hurt someone I cherish?”
“Woah, Woah, there.” A warm male voice caused Sherlock to look up. The older male omega he had noticed earlier crouched in front of him.
The boy ground down harder the head of John’s red cock slipping between slicked cheeks.
One hand cradled his Bee the other held John’s mobile captive his face lighting up as Molly rambled on with a story on the other end of the line.
Now John was busy stripping both of them Sherlock to sleepy and hunger sated to pay much attention to the alpha.
The elderly beta smiled sadly and crept forwards slowly holding out a fluffy mint green baby blanket. That had been slung over her shoulder.
The brown haired beta quickly read the alpha’s name tag and made eye contact.
While their items were scanned John felt his stomach grumble, it was now closing into 1 in the afternoon and they had somehow managed to skip breakfast. A tiny answering rumble came from Sherlock who only blushed and ducked his head.
“My alpha pleathe… Everyone know…my alpha …yours” broken breaths cut off words as the omega moaned desperately rolling onto his stomach and pressing his leaking arse against John’s bulging arousal.
Lifting the boot lid to see he saw his small omega curled on his side knees drawn to his chest with a slight smile on his bow lips. He held the miniature torch in both hands his eyes fixed on the glowing tip seemingly unaware of the open boot.
Settling on the bench John allowed the omega to scoot closer sitting between the taller alpha’s knees as he unlocked the heavy chains. The omega instantly rubbed at his wrists gratefully nuzzling into John’s thigh with a pleased whimper. With a sad smile the alpha pet the dirty hair and leaned to help the naked body into the joggers, thumbs brushing against razor-sharp hip bones John frowned. There were rules regarding feeding omega slaves. The boy should not be this thin.
Bracing himself above the boy John pitched forwards, tenderly assaulting the pliant mouth beneath him, the omega whimpered. Pulling back for air and to search the alpha’s eyes. A moments pause and the two mouths joined again.
Inside the shop, Sherlock mostly kept his face buried in John’s neck except when John asked him a question and even then the omega would only look briefly and then hide his face as he thought before giving John an answer.
Pulling the curled up omega to his black and white jumper striped chest John laughed. “We really do need to get dressed now.”
Instantly cold brown eyes turned to John meeting his gaze. It was so unusual for an omega to actually make eye contact with an alpha that John had to gather his thoughts for a moment.
“No, I mean you can sit on the sofa.” Pale eyes widened in disbelief and the boy looked close to tears again. Instead, he calmed his features and rushed to John’s feet. John almost jumped back in alarm but stopped at the last second and found the pale man nuzzling into his calf again and whispering “thank you, mathter,” over and over in a loop.
Friendly comments, questions or suggestions welcome below!
Panic had set in for the alpha halfway through his third patient but the Doctor had been forced to wait until his lunch break to leave.
(side note: Also what do you get your boyfriend for his birthday? I'm really not good with that type of stuff... Help!)
“Oh hush Greg, your an alpha, John’s an alpha and his recently bonded omega is half-naked on your couch, of course, he doesn’t want you staring at Sherlock’s arse.”  Molly snapped leaving the older alpha suitably chastened.
John winced. “No, not really… just a one-off”
Sherlock loosened his death grip on John’s coat and let his legs fall to the floor.
“Th-thank you”  the boy managed the words sounding strange in his mouth.
“Sherlock, Love I-“ the blond choked and fell to his knees beside the omega.
“Doctor Watson? He shouldn’t bring them down stairs they could get sick.”
“Yeth please.”
“Guess we’ll eat a little late” John yawned into Sherlock’s dark curls.
Sherlock opened his mouth to defend his alpha but Molly wasn’t finished.
The scent of omega in heat was stifling, and all John wanted was to claim he omega and mark him where all could see.
“I’m never going to punish you again because I want to marry you.”
An hour later John woke to a sleeping omega nuzzling into his stomach and immediately smiled.
“Yes, sorry can I help you?”
“Yeah?”
“No jawn”
“He’s bloody gorgeous! Where’d you get an omega like that?”
“Hey, shhh it’s okay” the blond soothed rubbing small circles with his thumb on the boy’ thigh.
Seconds later the pair was out cold asleep.
“Are you alright? You’ve been sitting there with your eyes closed for a while now.”
“I woke up and you were gone. I panicked I thought someone had taken you.”
“I love you too Sherlock… And I will never let anyone hurt you, or your pups.” The omega felt tears in his eyes.
There was one last scribbled in entry with black pen before the next page.
What was expected of him? Would John expect him to prepare himself? And if he didn’t would the alpha take the time to do so?
Head bowed in preparation for the punishment sure to come.
“Mine” John agreed shifting the boy until he was positioned directly above his leaking cock.
John brushed a thumb over one sharp cheekbone. The boy’s eyes fell to the ground.
“In a backpack?”
“Pleathe”
“Here so you’ll have some light.” The boy looked up at John in amazement his bow lips parting slightly in awe. Tears instantaneously began to trickle down from the green-blue eyes as the young man hugged the light to his jumper clad chest humming slightly. His scent changed growing sweeter, happier as the omega turned to nuzzle his face into the alpha’s hand and settle contentedly on the floor of the boot.
“What about when I’m angry?”
Snagging the purple blanket from earlier John turned to the sofa and settled himself stretched out in the corner of the sofa, inviting the omega to settle in his lap.
“J-j- Jawn! peathe! I ne-need to see you pleathe”
“I-I don’th remember,” he cringed backing himself off of John’s lap and against the closed door
“That people were gonna try and fuck you? Or course I was. I’ve been here for over two years. I know how these people think.”
“Sherlock love?”
The boy had pushed up the sleeves of the red jumper and the slight sheen of sweat droplets dotted his brow.
Sherlock uncurled from the T-shirt and nodded slowly at John.
Bought: May 2009 - Sean H. Ericsson (deceased)
“Oh, John!”The woman clapped her hands happily. “Since when?”
“Love, come on you need to let go of me.”
Nodding politely to the two omegas still seated on the blanket the tall alpha spun on heel and nearly marched away.
“That won’t be necessary.” The blond shifted
“Sorry, so sorry” John stammered. “I thought you were someone else.”
Remembering his master’s promise of good news he quickly stabbed a noodle with the fork provided. It had been ages since he was allowed a fork but he still remembered how to handle one. He kept his eyes trained on his bowl and focused on eating slowly, who knew when he would eat again or what the punishment for eating to quickly be.
“I’ll let you finish brushing your teeth.”
“How many times have I told you to put your books back when you are done with them? HOW MANY?”
“Not you, I’m asking Sherlock”
The man’s brow furrowed. “Yes?”
Sherlock was squished against John chewing on his bent knuckle and hugging the plush to his chest. Abby held tightly onto John’s hand but other than that did not cuddle up to the alpha in any way.
John sighed the constant asking for permission was getting old “Of course”
Looking up he saw John exiting the bedroom in a battered Beetles t-shirt and jeans, hair ruffled, lips swollen.
Frozen in place Mike found himself assaulted by the scent of mouth-watering omega hormones.
“Sherlock, we need to get up.”
“Please stop fidgeting, young man. You are making this more difficult than it needs to be.”
The beta took the answer the wrong way.
The stripped Jumper while defiantly comfortable wasn’t very intimidating and gave off more of a cuddly teddybear look than strong alpha.
“Greg Lestrade” the grey-haired alpha brought John’s attention away from his children and thrust out his free hand.
Mark seemed to hold his breath.
“Thith wath the day before he died.” Sherlock had volunteered without looking up at John.
“Can I pull up my trousers now?” Sherlock whispered softly.
The omega calmed himself slowly when John didn’t grab for him and at himself down slowly in the water submissively. The tightened boy repeatedly cupped water in his hands and let it drop back in the water whimpering something underlies breath.
When John had first dialed the number he had been met with a friendly but steeling underlaid alpha voice. Returning the stiffness with his captain’s voice John had curtly asked to speak to Molly. The alpha on the other end of the line could be heard bristling and asked again who was calling.
“Holy hell” the visiting alpha breathed.
The blond ran back up the stairs shouting.
Smiling softly at the praise Sherlock grew more bold unzipping and tugging the aroused cock fully into the air. Somehow the image of John’s cock standing proudly through his fly was even more pornographic than if he’d been naked.
Sherlock smiled sleepily at the large alpha’s panic.
“Hello Jawn”
Tiny fists planted on her hips the matter of fact announcements brought a smile to John’s lips.
“What happened?” Greg’s voice was carefully calm.
“Mhhhmm Jawn!” Sherlock moaned quietly in pleasure and need.
“Chinese?”
Sherlock smiling sat down in the plush cushioned chair only to shoot back up with a yelp of pain tears welling in his eyes.
“I always will love you, Sherlock, Even if I do a bad job of showing it I will never stop loving you.”
“I thayed with hith body. I was too thcared to leave. I kept thinking maybe he would ‘wake-up’ and wathn’t really dead. Then they brought me back to the auction houthe and thold me to Ryan. I didn’t even go to hith funeral.”
John sat Sherlock down on his own feet as he rung the bell to Molly and Greg’s house and fidgeted with his too cuddly jumper.
“It was my father. And don’t worry I don’t plan on killing anyone else.”
The grey haired omega shook his head his eyes portraying a mix of annoyance and amusement.
A huge man well over six feet and face covered in tattoos stared down at the boy, fingers digging painfully into the boy’s shoulder. Sherlock to his credit did not flinch. John’s laughed had died his face turning blank.
His crime?
“Dinner!” Molly called from the kitchen. Everyone migrated towards the table Sherlock holding Andre with a soft smile on his lips as the baby gummed at his knuckle.
His hand held captive by the tiny beta’s drooling mouth and chubby hands Sherlock made his way to one of the large cushions and settled down on the soft yellow fabric.
He was kneeling in his cage either refusing or unable to stand.
The raven-haired youth rolled his eyes to the heavens and sighed.
“What’th hith name?” The boy questioned bringing his gaze back to Mark.
“Pleathe mathter let me help my alpha show me how, pleathe mathter,” Each time the word master left those lip John wanted to scream. But not so soon, he couldn’t ban the word so soon, the poor boy was already terrified and confused.
“Fine, here’s your boy-toy back”
Sherlock shuffled on his knees despite not having drunk anything at lunch the two cups of tea from that morning were putting pressuring his bladder. The red-haired woman wrapped a hideous floral print collar around his neck and seemed to consider it a moment before looking up at John’s distasteful grimace.
“Yours” Sherlock agreed without hesitation.
“Pregnant? Are you sure? Can you tell how many, when do they come?” And a dawning of terrified shock
John again felt a deep coil of jealousy in his stomach.
After tea, he decided and quickly gulped down his own drink impatiently. Gently hushing the omega’s whimpering with a tender caress of his curls John tugged down the jogging pants and ran a hand around the abused ankles and lower calves. The skin was mostly scabbed over from long use but traces of blood were still visible.
“A slave? Really John never thought you’d be the type to buy a boy”
“I’ll make sure that if anything ever happens to me you don’t go back to the auction house. You’ll live with Mrs. Hudson or my sister or Molly. But you won’t ever go back there you understand?”
“89d47H0”
Impregnated:
The wet curly head nodded into the tile but didn’t look up.
The smile on the dark-skinned alpha’s face was terse.
The omega was young, very young probably done growing but still it’s face was filled with youthfulness. Noting the heavy bruising around the omega’s neck Mike furrowed his brow?
Sherlock blowdried his hair on low heat using his circular hairbrush to tame his curls into some semblance of order.
Without even glancing at his alpha for permission Mycroft nodded.
The toothbrush fell out of the boy’s mouth clattering onto the floor.
Greg growled causing Molly, Jeremiah, Sherlock, and Andre to shrink slightly.
Here it is people. Everyone has been asking for smutt and I hope this works. I've never actually written something like this before but I tried. Please advise! Friendly comments, questions, and suggestions are more than welcome!
“Mine” the alpha snarled his teeth still sunken into the young omega’s scent gland. Panting Sherlock collapsed the movement tugging at the knot tying the two together as John lavished the new bond mark with his tongue.
The previous blush and uncertain look settled on the boy’s face as he nodded towards the eye make-up.
He hadn’t taken John outside of heat yet and he wasn’t entirely sure his body could adjust comfortably to such a large intrusion.
“Yeth Jawn” the boy whispered. “I don’t know how but…” the dark-haired boy sunk to the floor stretching out his neck for the older omega.
“Sir?”
Refusing to make eye contact the omega boy nodded.
“Mhm, you smell good love.”
Sherlock snorted softly in amusement and twisted to look down at his mate.
“Uhhhh? John!”
“Love, what’s wrong.”
John licked his lips with a dry tongue. “No, it’s okay love…. Do I really have to?”
The blond alpha reached into the backpack he had brought along and pulled out the stuffed bee. Grateful and a bit embarrassed Sherlock curled his fingers around one fuzzy antenna and hugged the home scented plush to his chest.
Marriage?
“A complete and utter idiot. Or insane.”
He was younger than most of the omegas on stage just barely stopped growing from what John could tell. While most had their eyes trained on the floor of their cages this boy’s pale eyes were darting around the room landing on John and searching the solider and then when noticing the solider’s gaze on him flinching and dropping his eyes to the filthy cage floor.
“Wh-why can’t I just stay with you?” John sighed and pet the boy’s curls tenderly.
“Sher-“ John gasped falling back to sit on the mattress. “What are y-“ the questions turned into a deep groan as Sherlock sucked the thick head into his angelic bow lips.
That’s when John smelled it… the boy was going into heat and soon, within the next 24 hours. His hormones would be off the wall.
“I’m yourth.” Sherlock whispered and only yelped slightly when John seized his arse with both hands squeezing.
“Don’t”
Mike finally huffed leaning back in the leather armchair tired of the silent game.
“To what feeling hungry?”
The muscular alpha finally seemed to come to and took an overly large bite from his jam slathered toast. Crumbs stuck to the beginnings of a four-day-old beard. He would have to shave, Sherlock being an omega had no such problem, he couldn’t have grown a beard if he wanted to.
“Similar nature?”
“Can you lay down for me? Stretch all the way out.” The boy blinked and his eyes flickered slightly in fear before he did as directed.
“Yeth Jawn”
“ther- Sherlo- Sherlock” the omega repeated struggling with the name in his mouth.
“I’m gonna be a father…” he whispered again pulling the omega flush with his own much larger body.
“Problem?” John put on his best arrogant face.
A halo of ebony curls fanned around an angelic pale face completely with delicate brows, straight nose, long black lashes, and plush pink lips parted slightly in a heart shape.
John watched as Holly was busily stomped around a tower she built to make it fall.  Jeremiah sat curled up on a soft green sofa two tiny pups cradled gently in his chubby arms.
“Why?” He croaked.
“Love?”
“Love, what are you doing?”
“Oh, I’m sorry I didn't realise I'm-“ he stopped this wasn’t going to help anything.
“Now I understand Mycroft that you have scented family at this flat? Is that right?”
The omega was, as he had said, pregnant.
Thundering down the stair John brought himself to a halt just outside Mrs Hudson’s door. The elderly lady despite her protests of “not your housekeeper” functioned very much like a nanny to the Surgeon.
Squaring his shoulders Sherlock stared at his reflection. He would have to please John, be a perfect omega, submissive and helpful.
“Okay” John spoke loudly feeling uncomfortable being so close to another alpha’s mate.
The older omega stiffened in apparent distaste before crawling forward to bow at John’s feet. John scowled and pulled back.
The omega squared his bare shoulders slightly and stopped gnawing on his lower lip
They’d eaten the take away lazily curled on the sofa watching a documentary about how acid works.
Sherlock allowed John to carry him but did not cuddle into the Doctor as he normally did. He instead clung to the plush Bee, legs wrapped securely around John’s waist flinching anytime the alpha strayed his hand past his upper back.
One it was inconvenient to his master. An omega should never inconvenience his master that was a lesson he learned with his first master when he was still five years old.
“His mother won’t mind?”
“Prat” the insult was said with such a blinding smile Sherlock forgot to be scared or offended.
The cabbie murmured impatiently as John got in, and proceeded to drive aggressively nostrils flaring at the sweet scent of fertile unbounded omega. John could feel nothing but jealousy in the moment and he soon realised he was practically drowning the cab in the sent of aggressive alpha hormones. For the sake of the omega in the boot behind him, he tried to calm down.
“Mycroft!” Yusuf growled.
“No chairs?”
John had hardily fastened up his own flies when Mrs. Hudson called up that the cab had arrived.
“Yes “
Somehow those words did clam the ex-solider. He after al. had killed many men in combat and one in self-defense.
Current age: 16
“Oh?”
Opening the door John tugged gently at the lead bringing the omega into the foyer and shouting “Mrs Hudson I’m home!” The young man let out a high pitched yelp and curled at John’s feet hands clutching his head in the same fashion he had when first brought to John.
“I-I-Don’th know. He juth didn’t want to I gueth”
The omega scrambled after him crawling on his reddened hands and knees. They got nearly to the lift door before John noticed the boy was still on the ground.
Sherlock whined lowly in his throat but hastily began to obey, even if John wouldn’t hurt him there was nothing stopping this alpha from trying to do so. Omega bonded or unbonded were still required to obey any alpha to a certain degree.
Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on his plate eating his sandwich steadily. His alpha was more than angry and if sherlock was honest with himself he would agree that he was disappointed as well. The idea of not having to wear a collar, or being free to go out alone, and being free from punishments while terrifying was also exciting. Another thing was consent a married omega had the right to say no to any form of sexual harassment.
“I-I think I love you” The alpha took hold of the omega’s hips and quickly twisted so that the omega was laying on top of John's chest to chest eye to eye.
As the film played John felt the boy relaxing more and more even humming along with some of the songs and laughing at some of the scenes.
“Tea?” The muscular alpha turned to ask the cowering omega. The boy’s face lit up slightly and he crawled forwards to the kitchen in order to find the tea bags and a mug.
He suppressed it.
“Love I want whatever you want.”
The omega had finally gone and done something on his own and what had John gone and done. Shouted at a traumatized abuse victim.  Clenching his fist again the blond put his full power behind slamming into the mattress.
But the boy latched on wrapping himself around John’s torso eyes half-lidded and movements sloppy.
“Of courthe Jawn.”
“Y-you won’t kill them?”
Eye colour? John had bit his lip and finally wrote (light) He was basically asking for the opposite of himself in physical appearance. Male/ Female/ Either. He pen hovered over female and moment before scratching out (either) in the blank.
“Stay safe Johnny”
“Mhmm” the boy hummed nuzzling into John’s firm chest happily.
“In self-defense?”
“No love, I meant do you want some tea?” The slave sat back on his heels rubbing his glossy lips together nervously. He looked pleadingly at John looking for permission to speak.
“I’m gonna do the washing up I’ll be back in twenty minutes okay?”
This is kinda short and has a lot of internal conflict for John. Friendly comments, questions or suggestion are welcome below!
An indigent squeal form he pup caused the two to break away and look down.
Sherlock perked up slightly hugging the plush toy to his chest.
“Jawn Pleathe!” The raven-haired boy wailed as wet tongue and thick finger worked their way inside of him. “I’m ready pleathe!”
He did not.
Pushing in, agonizingly slowly thick length streaching the boy's pink rim obseanly.  Sherlock grabbed onto the muscular shoulders and keened desperately bucking to impale hismelf further.
“I don’t understand. What was a bit not good?”
The pale omega let out a slight squeak of surprise when the alpha scooped him up and placed him on the counter. The omega tucked his legs to the side and watched John gather two mugs and the tea bags. A content and still slightly fearful scent filled the air the fear heightening each time John moved to quickly near the omega. The boy paid rapt attention to how the Doctor prepared the drink.
Laying the panting omega in the center of the nest John stepped back to observe the beauty before him.
Shaking it firmly John noded his head. “John Watson”
“I’m th-th-thorry, You thaid I could uthe the bathroom whenever I wanted tho I was just thowering and getting ready. I won’t do it again I’m thorry Mathter, I mean Jawn.”
The raven-haired omega swept into the room hair and make-up completed and body wrapped loosely in the blue silk dressing gown he’d come to love.
“Oy bit of a mouthful there.” The raven-haired boy nodded his sliver eyes still fixed on the little pup with a touch of longing. He sated himself with putting a hand over his belly and feeling the life within’s happy thrum.
John was coming, he was in the hall. Sherlock pulled away from his hand and knelt on the bed all fours, face pressed into the mattress, presenting himself for the alpha.
“Love, that’s- that’s not a big deal. I don’t need to punish you for not wanting to wake up.”
While Sherlock was saying goodbye to Andre cuddling the small pup to his chest Greg cornered John in the front hall.
“Okay- Ow DAMN IT! SHERLOCK!!”
“Do I have to sit over here?”
He felt extremely uncomfortable. Eating at the same table as his master, like an equal? He would have been beaten for even hoping it before.
Sherlock was breathing slowly, eyelashes fluttering closed, and plush lips parting slightly with each huff of breath. John allowed his fingers to tangle in the silky curls and hummed lowly.
“Have you ever read a book?”
Bronze tanned skin dusted with curling golden hair, bulging muscles and abs, firm pecks and a massive throbbing alpha arousal.
If the two were to be married they would be legally equal. No more collars in public, Sherlock would even be able to get a job if he so wished.
The blond’s smirking grin turned predatory as he crawled his way up the omega’s trembling body.
“Sherlock.” John ran a warm hand down the omega’s spine and over his buttocks.
“I’m thorry, I’m fine I didn’t mean to worry you.” The younger omega bowed his head respectfully shyly watching the playful pup through his lashes.
Suppressors.
“I’m thorry, mathter” The number of times John had felt like being sick was to numeral to count so John simply stood taking the collar and lead with him and walking deeper into the flat.
Sherlock shuddered and pressed himself further into John. So far John reminded him of Sean.
“Enough with the hugging please” he tried to sound firm but he mostly was confused. His mind firing quickly, Sherlock was a mother, he had pups, two of them, that he hadn’t seen in at least a year. A second thing was they were now roughly 15 hours away from heat and they needed to be home soon in order for Sherlock to nest.
“Mathter! I don’t want a different alpha mathter pleathe, masthter. pleathe keep Pup- Love pleathe mathter!”
“Look at this we got a pretty one and he’s still a baby. Can’t even speak proper”
The boy kept his eyes on the ground and pointed timidly over to the cosmetics section. John dutifully pushed the trolley in that direction. Soothing the heavily blushing omega by rubbing tender circles on his back.  The section was full of collared omegas most with impatient, or incredibly bored alphas standing nearby. There was one omega though a female wearing a marriage cuff, with no alpha in sight. She struggled to reach a small tube on the top shelf and John easily handed it down to her.
The rest of the next three days were filled with much of the same. Mindless breeding and rutting with fluffy sleepy cuddling, sweet moments shared curled up in Sherlock’s nest.
“Why?”
While a collar was not the same as marriage and cuffs. It was still a collar from John. Something that let the world know that John owned him and John was his protector. The very thought made the boy flush and He pressed his thighs together now for a completely different reason.
Anyway sorry this took so long. Hope you enjoy it despite the wait.
“Ryan Weathers kept multiple omega’s. Sherlock was his favourite, but when he couldn’t deliver  Ryan used me. I was 15 when he bought Sherlock, but he was only ten. We helped each other. Ryan sold me in 2016 said he couldn’t afford both of us. I was 18 by then but andr- Sherlock still wasn’t full grown. How much longer did he keep you?” Molly turned her question to Sherlock.
Bit of a wait sorry about that I had a 'sleepover' last night and didn't really have time to write. On the plus side my crush (lets just call him J) asked me to be his boyfriend... aparnetly he's liked me for quite awhile.
John slid out from under his omega draping the blanket-clad boy on the sofa and sneaking into the kitchen to prepare dinner.
“Er was Sean rich?”
“Your eyeth are dilated approximately 69% more than on average, your thcent indicates arouthal and pothethiveneth,”
John nodded slowly, disliking the idea of this alpha even being in the same room as his omega let alone examining him.
The blond alpha looked around frantically and spotted his omega in the far left corner. The boy sat on a sprawling blue blanket cuddled up with two other omega’s a small pup in his arms and another sitting proudly on his outstretched legs.
John examined each frightfully thin wrist in turn. He would be so easy to break the alpha in him would have been able to snap the omega in an instant. John let his finger ghost across the omega’s face and realised a heavy layer of foundation covered several bruises.
Wincing John allowed it.
“Of course love, do you know the code?”
“Sherlock Love?”
“Alright, so on our to-do list so far, get dressed” the alpha smirked glancing down at their barely clothed bodies. “Shave” John scrubbed his cheek grumpily. “Go to registration, the courthouse, maybe stop for lunch, get your cuffs, and then get stuff from your locker.” The alpha began clearing off the table. “Then dinner and telly?”
“Then by all means retrieve our omega though I will remind you we have a private room down the hall for you to ‘eat lunch’ in without disrupting others.”
John balled his hands into fists hating himself more by the minute.
Distasteful but not uncommon.
John’s face creased “‘I totally forgot to check it…sorry mate, I was a bit busy.”
The thin beta woman at the omega registry looked incredibly bored. She was chewing on a piece of gum as if her jaw depended on it and staring off into the middle distance blankly.
John barked out a laugh and grinned.
“Seventeen! Bloody hell how are you even in here?”
“Right thanks” John finished handing the man his notes and struggling up the steps plastic bags in hand.
“Mh” a sleepy huff of warm breath tickled John’s neck making him smile.
Dressed and clutching the Bee Sherlock sat securely on John’s hip. True the boy was now capable of walking by himself but the former arm captain was feeling possessive and had simply scooped the boy up with one arm.
“Alright come in and sit, I’ll get him.”
“Yeth”
“Oh, John don’t you think that’s a bit soon? You can’t have possibly talked to his sire alpha yet.”
His plea?
The man spread his hands wide.
Sitting up Sherlock stretched his arms above his head a second yawn widening his jaw until his lips stretch uncomfortably. Swinging his feet to dangle off the side of the bed he hesitated.
John shifts one of his hands to rest against the boy’s small belly bump and feels the tiny thrum of life inside. Sherlock wriggles closer grumbling in his sleep from the loss of warmth on his neck. John smiles softy and glances at the clock, it’s rather late but the alpha supposes they can have a bit of a lie-in.
“Deduce it”
“Wake-up”
The boy kept his face to the ground. “Look at me” the omega rose his head slightly flinching and cringing away from John’s large hands and cain.
“M’kay” the omega yawned and licked John’s bicep softly before falling into a half-sleep.
The alpha groaned flopping on his stomach, face planting into the sheets.
“I don’t know, thmelled nice though. Thafe. Feel like I should know him.”
“Can I bring my bee?” Sherlock voice floated into he sitting room where John was looking for his mobile.
He sat upright. They were bonded now, which meant they would need to report it straight away to the office of omega registration. A second thought burst into his mind.
Molly seemed to catch on to John’s discomfort and Sherlock’s preheat scent and retreated a few paces.
Sinking down ever so slowly the boy moaned his head thrown back dark curls shining in the light from the window. John opened his mouth in a silent moan arching his back up off the bed in an attempt to sink fully into the delicious heat and tightness. The blond bottomed out his omega’s arse pressed firmly into his hipbones with no space between them.
John ground his teeth together in anger, a human, his soon to be mate, should not have to ride in the boot and then be moved to tears by the simple act of a light being handed to him. This was inhuman. Softly he shut the lid taking extra notice of the vent holes on the sides of the lid.
“Andre’s Mate?”
“I’ll get you at lunchtime, we can eat in the canteen together.”
“Now is there anything else you’d like love?”
“I-wasn’t I didn’t that’s”
“Wha- I mean no, It’s nothing I’m just getting my omega so we can eat together.”
Every so often she would wrap a new collar around his throat and remove it shaking her head.
John was fairly out of it as Greg talked to him only making polite conversational replies. The larger alpha, however, didn’t seem to notice and continued to ramble on about his job and children as he set the table.
January 2019
Pup births (2)
John rubbed his face in an attempt to collect himself. This was sickening, absolutely sickening and it hadn’t even been more than an hour. Holding one mug in each hand he walked to the sitting room to be greeted by a conflicting sight. The animalistic part of John’s alpha relished in the boy, his omega, kneeling on the ground upright on his knees, back arched, legs slightly spread, hands on his nape, head bowed in submission. John himself was saddened and enraged. He forced himself to speak calmly.
Sorry this a a bit late but I had a pretty busy day... something super exciting in fact. I sorta came out to my crush and turns out he's bi and we went and got ice cream. So yeah I was on cloud nine. I mean my parents would kill me but it's a huge load off my shoulders to have someone who actually knows my name and stuff not regect me... ANYWAY (sorry got a bit off track there)
“Pleathe!”  He didn’t need to ask twice. In an instant, John was over him on all fours plundering the omega’s mouth and rutting against the much smaller cock.
“That’s not what I was asking, although you are wrong four out of five men in this place claim to be straight and more than half of them would offer if it meant gaining protection in the future.”
“Yes.”
“I-“ Sherlock looked pleadingly at John. “Am I allowed to call Molly?” The silver eyes begged and John found himself nodding his head before the request had even fully processed.
“Thank you love.” John smiled. He hadn’t even had to voice his thoughts and already his omega had solved the problem. Looking in the mirror Sherlock was right. The boots add a whole to air to the outfit.
John snatched a crumbled t-shirt off the floor and exited to the sitting room where Yusuf lounged on the sofa. The red-haired omega kneeling on the hardwood floors.
The emphasis on the word Boy made John bristle.  It made him sound like some perverted old man snatching a child off the street.
Scrunching himself small Sherlock tried to burrow deeper into the smell of his alpha.
“Mycroft, I do need to get to that meeting. If you could please wrap this up.”
“I know you know what you did was wrong. And I know you said you were sorry but I want you to know I will be watching. That boy means the world to Molly so if I feel that you are in any way abusing him I will have him removed from you.”
“Thank you”
“Em-er- I mean no. But damn. Two omegas. Do you have them fuck each other for you?”
Friendly, comments, questions, or suggestion are welcome below!
“No, they are with their father.”
Alex L. Weathers, 2 pounds six ounces, Gender: omega Sex: male Hair: Black Eyes: Blue Length: 11 inches
Sherlock smiled softly.
“Even when I need to be punithed?”
The possessive growl John let out only served t arouse the boy more and a thin stream of slick slipped down those lovely legs.
“Budge up a bit it’s bloody freezing.” The omega scooted up allowing John to pull open the duvet and sheets and then slipped in beside the alpha.
“Please.” The girl whispered and pressed back against his legs.
12 October 2018
“Did you leave them with a sitter of something? You know you don’t have to, you can just bring them here until they are in school.”
“What happened to his feet?”
“You do realize I can have him removed from you within 24 hours and you locked up for life? I’ve got plenty of friends in the OA omega abuse division. ”
“Love you”
The list went on, listing more and more punishment that had seemed to work on his omega and were recommended for future use. Holding his head in his hands the alpha let out a dry sob.
The boy only curled into himself tighter.
“Can you tell me what it is?”
“Well obviously, I’d hardly be offering to suck your cock if I were not gay or at the very least bisexual.”
John hummed to himself as he wiped his hands dry and turned to leave the kitchen. He tugged off his jumper and vest in the hall, he had gotten them both wet washing up and he preferred to sleep shirtless anyways.
John groaned and thumped his head against his palm.
“John Watson 24 hours is more than enough time for the two of you to pick out what you need. I’ll cook something for you but it is in your omega’s best intrust to let him make some decisions”
“Yes thank you, you already said.”
Sherlock allowed his dressing gown to fall open and off his pale shoulders grasping the thick arousal in both hands. He laved at the shaft, pressing tender kisses along the prominent vein sucking the darkly coloured head like a lolly and flicking his tongue in the slit. John made the mistake of looking downright as his omega slid down on his cock, lips stretch obscenely on the thick shaft and instantly lost any semblance of control he had over his orgasm.
“Shhhhh It’s okay love, I’ve got you.” John scooped up the omega in one arm the other still holding the protein drink.  John ran a gentle hand down the omega’s back and allowed his fingers to graze between the boy’s legs and was relieved to find the omega had not yet started lubricating. That meant they had a while before the pills would become necessary and plenty of time to get ready.
John was angry at John too. In fact, he was furious with himself. And the fact that Sherlock couldn’t get it through his head that he hadn’t done anything wrong made him want to scream.
“yeth, Jawn?” the omega ducked his head submissively.
“I’m gonna be a father”
John braced himself and stirred the pasta reading further barely holding onto his calm. The sheer amount of terminations was staggering and it became clear that the other alpha had used Sherlock as nothing more than a toy.
The man was posh and well-spoken and John felt rather compelled to shut the door in his face. For all his polite words the man seemed rather stuck up.
“Mathter?”
A hand rested on John’s leg causing him to jump.
Sherlock was waiting impatiently his own fingers shoved deep inside himself as he rolled in the warmth John had left behind on the sheets.
Sherlock repeated the question tacking on a please this time.
“I suggest you wait until your omega has reached the proper agenda then marry him at that time.”
John sighed.
Sherlock was curled into a pretzel on the leather sofa dressed only in one of John’s oversized jumpers a pair of tempting black pants and some fuzzy blue puppy dog covered socks Mrs. Hudson had brought up.
“Like I said,” John ran a tender hand through the dark curls “he was given to me, the military decided to reward my service with an omega… I had no choice in the matter. And I couldn’t leave him, he can’t even walk Mike.”
“Really?” The boy’s voice was a mixture of curiosity and disgust.
Rubbing the soft fabric to his cheek Sherlock hummed and snuggled back into John for a few minutes as John munched down his sandwich. He felt a swelteringly warm wave wash over him and whimpered slightly into his now empty mug.
“John!” With a start, the doctor jumped back sitting back to straddle the pale figure below him and growled out a furious warning howl. The male below John whined slightly at the loss and then threw an arm over his face in embarrassment
Purring happily the omega burrowed back into John’s chest licking the tan skin affectionately.
Last name: Unknown
“I was wondering if we could talk to your omega? With your supervision of course.”
The words were spoken with a smile and underlined with ice.
John scowled and turned his back to the young nurse.
“I was thix years old when he first bought me why wouldn’t I play gamth?”
“Anyways I suppose I am one of the ‘Murderers’ you are referring to. I’ll fit right in”
“Oh…” Sherlock hid his disappointment flawlessly.
John himself had nearly fallen asleep when Sherlock thrust the mobile back into his hand and wrapped himself like a limpet around John’s muscular body.
“Mike so help me if you cock block me one more time I swear I'll-!”
I am amazed at the feedback I've gotten from this fic. I've honestly never had anyone like my writing this much before and it is staggering. Thank you all for your support! As usual friendly comments, questions, or suggestions are welcome below!
“Sherlock I don’t think you-“ Molly started
A small giggle escaped Sherlock’s mouth at that.
“Maybe one of two. How are you and Clara?”
“Because I bloody well shot him, Harry! I’m not going to hide something I clearly did!”
John was overwhelmed with a sense of guilt and even now Sherlock scent gave off traces of apprehension.
“Sunday? Around 12?” The teenager suggested timidly.
Sherlock bit his lip and nodded into John’s beetles T.
The kneeling redhead jerked at Sherlock’s name but kept his head down dutifully.
Probing gently over the thin back and shoulders and settling on the bond bite. Red and slightly puffy the mark had begun to take on a pink colour that marked it as consensual beneath the mark there could be seen silver scaring from a non-consensual bond and beneath that the faintest traces of another pinkish mark now fading from being broken.
“Love, please sit in the chair and eat. I have had some good news for you once you start eating”
“Two, and alpha girl and a omega boy. They’ll be 9 months tomorrow.”
“What did your old masters call you?” The omega tensed visibly and then forced himself to relax back into the larger male’s arms.
John was floored. The man while strong and handsome was really not at all what he had been expecting.
The words took a moment to sink in.
“Ready”
“yeth Jawn” he murmured and pulled himself into the wood chair.
Bought: January 2013 - Ryan L. Weathers
Sherlock’s shoulders tensed. “No”
Sherlock wriggled closer to the warmth and scent of his mate. Rolling over so that he could face the tall alpha, and nuzzle into the blond’s neck.
“You don’t need to punish him, sir, he was only wriggling a bit. Don’t punish him on my account.”
“My new name ith ‘Love’?” John just smiled tightly and nodded his head.
Unpacking the the two boxes had brought another round of tears as Sherlock was reminded of Sean. The first box was filled with books on chemistry and music. The second was compiled of a folder of sheet music, a soft fluffy blanket, several plush toys, a yellowed sketch book, a soft pencil case, a pair or head phones and an ancient iPod.
John bristled his lip lifting off his teeth slightly in a half snarl.
It was well lit without being painfully bright, the soft carpeted floor was strewn with large colourful cushions and blankets. Short white bookshelves lined one wall.
“Okay shhh, shhh. Calm down. Let’s do this slowly.”
The boy hummed quietly still trying to hide his erection.
“Pleathe be careful Jawn, certain punishmenth could hurt the pupth at thuch an early thage.” John leaned forward toward his omega his heart bursting with sorrow. He’d thought they were over this.
“If you want hot water you’ve gotta shower in the morning. Which unless you want to be gang-raped by Alister and his cronies you’re not going to do.”
John started running a hand through his hair.
“I’m so sorry I didn’t-“ The older omega stood and wrapped himself around Sherlock pulling the thin boy into a comforting hug, the soft omega scent calming them both.
“I’m sorry master, yes alpha Watson” the low voice was bitter and sarcastic.
Sherlock grumbled in his sleep and blinked blearily into John’s chest.
John woke up completely curled around his omega legs and arms twined around the thin body preventing any form of escape.
The man only grinned a little wider and bit at the boy’s pale neck hand squeezing at the plush arse.
The boy nuzzled his face into John’s chest and stilled waiting for a response, negative or positive. John let out a long breath of amazement, “brilliant”
After a moment Sherlock joined in the two making their way to the showers.
John pressed his lips together in distaste.
“I don’t want the medicine’’ the omega boy whispered. “I-I-I want my pups to be with you, you are safe.”
The shadow kneeling by John’s bed shifted the form becoming more distinct as John’s eyes adjusted.
“No most oalpha’s don’t like that idea. So the hospital just sticks with cushions. That way they can satisfy the less strict alphas by providing comfort while not offending the more traditional alphas..”
“yeth, mathter”  The omega held out his arms for the doctor to pick him and place him on the floor.
John stepped forward and scooped the omega up in his arms scenting the boys neck heavily so that it would be clear to everyone who could smell them that the omega was spoken for.
“Ballet” the boy corrected with a challenging look on his face as if daring John to laugh.
“Mine, MINE! my mate.” John snarled losing himself in his alpha.  “Claim, knot, bond, breed.” He whispered under his breath thrusting with a sharp snap of his hip at each word.
Sherlock caught himself staring at the wriggling pup and moment too long before he shook himself to answer the man.
“I don’t want to stay…” Sherlock whispered.
“I’ll clean up my bookth before we go” Sherlock started to kneel down.
“Mine!” He growled grinding forcefully down.
“I don’t want your brother”
John froze unsure what had brought this on and slowly eased onto his haunches keeping his hands in clear view. Trying to take on the least threatening position he could muster while murmuring gentle reassurances.
Pushing at the shorts the omega whined unable to remove the offending fabric. Stepping forward quickly and rather eagerly John assisted the omega tugging of the shorts and tacking in the sight greedily.
Sherlock flinched violently recoiling and dropping down to the floor in a kowtow.
“Doctor Watson please explain what your omega is rambling on about.”
So yea comment if you read this and um well if anyone is still around I'll post another full length chapter.
“We’re going to be late.” The omega murmured head bowed in submission.
“I am fine Jawn, I’m uthed to it.”
“I-I didn’t mean -I shouldn’t have- I’m so-” the alpha searched for words.
John snarled the mental image of this teenage claiming his omega breaking his calm. The boy jumped back eyes wide with fear.
“And I’m going to be a mother with a handthome, gentle, throng alpha.”
That’s all it was supposed to be. A quick peck and then sleep.
Friendly comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome below!
Sherlock glared at the man.
The omega in his lap wriggled and pulled back to see the alpha’s face
John was angry this alpha had bred the poor boy almost every single heat since he was 10 years old. Bred and terminated each litter of pups.  Murdered them in John’s eyes. It was after all legal but by no means right considering the omega would have had no say in the terminations.
“Is there something wrong Dr Watson? May I help you?”
Pulling down three mugs from the sparse collection an orange folder caught his eye, reaching for it a sharp command froze him in place.
“Sign here” she tapped a paper on her clipboard, “here, here, here, and here”
“You want to get up and eat breakfast?”
“yeth Jawn.” The younger man lisped voice fearful.
“You can walk if you want to but I wouldn’t suggest it since your feet are pretty bad.”
“Come on” he whispered more to himself than the young man and pushed open the door tugging slightly at the lead in order to break the boy from the daydream he seemed to have fallen into. John rubbed his face. What was he getting into?
He would make sure of it.
“I don’t know if you want pups… or if you would want pups with me… but if you don’t you’ll need to take these so you don’t get pregnant.”
“Are you done staring?” John jumped back slightly.
They were back in the bedroom the omega flushed, still naked, and trembling. The alpha resigned to dolling out punishment to the boy… He had seen omegas be punished before and resolved that is would be nothing like that. He straightened his shoulders. Best to get this over with.
“Thop Jawn thop crying and apologizing. I disobeyed you I deserved punishment. I’m sorry Jawn. I am the one who thould be thorry. I will obey you next time.” The confidence slowly died through Sherlock's speech until the last sentence was nothing more than a whisper.
Biting his bow lips Sherlock nodded tearily. Why couldn’t he have just remembered to pick up those books. Why was he so bad.
The younger male relaxed, he hadn’t displeased the alpha.
Finally seated heavy balls slaping agaisnt the plush arse the alpha gave an experimental circle of his hips.
Sherlock managed to unfreeze himself in the doorway and practically fled to John’s lap sitting with his back to the blond’s chest the muscular arms closing around his waist instinctively.
Turning on his side the omega stared at his sleeping mate watching the gentle huffs of breath that fell from John’s lips and the steady swell and rise of his defined chest. Golden blond hair still cut to military precision shone in the rising sun. The alpha’s short eyelashes caught sparks of sunlight throwing the glow over his lax face.
A heavy hand dropped on the boy’s shoulder causing his head to jerk up and whirl around.
“I’d shoot him again if I got the chance. Hell, I’d shoot him a hundred times!”
“If there was a bonding other than that of Ryan L Weathers and Doctor Watson’s why was it not registered?”
Gratefully Sherlock pressed a kiss on his alpha’s cheek and settled down across the row, knees pulled to his chest, head in John’s lap and fingers gently stroking the soft new collar.
Mike had called the man a half dozen time and sent a dozen messages the original question wasn’t all that important anymore now he was worried about why the depressed alpha wasn’t answering…
“Oh…”
“Mike this is Sherlock, MY omega” the emphasis in the word ‘my’ was unmistakable.
Mark carried on.
“YOU…” John took a deep breath. “Alright, you have no say over the matter. What can we do?”
The greying blond omega nodded “I’m Mark.” He offered “you?”
John glared hard at the man and slowly eased off.
Bond Broken: October 2018
“You told me to get up twithe, I talked back. I apologithe. I am ready for my punishment.” John rubbed his face
“I was bored.”
“Come.” Sherlock crept forwards slowly.
Stepping lightly John went to wake his napping omega without scaring the boy.
“PICK UP YOUR BLOODY THINGS FOR ONCE!”
“Without a mirror, I find the concept of watching my own arse to be rather difficult.”
“Sherlock?” John turned quickly to face the boy.
The boy sucked hungrily at John’s neck and ground his own smaller omega cock against John’s firm abs his arse just barely teasing his own engorged cock.
Scenting the air Mike was hit with two things, One the boy in his friend's arms was unbounded and quite young omega. Two, the boy was terrified, but not of John, of him.
John inhaled deeply and nearly sunk into the mouthwatering smell he shook his head to clear it
“Jawn! “
The female alpha looked slightly upset.
John sighed internally, he would have much rather carried the boy.
Height: 5’ 2’’
The two sat up for John to pull on his pants and trousers and Sherlock to limp over to the dresser.
“I really don’t want to punish you, love.” John murmured rubbing a calloused hand over the pale buttocks. “I’m- I’m only going to do five and I am not going to do them hard understand?”
While John was happy for his omega he was also rather apprehensive about meeting Molly’s alpha. The man had sounded rather intense at first and the threat still hung over John’s head.
Mike smirked and glanced the omega certainly attractive to look at and suddenly got a whiff of the hormonal scent.
As always friendly comment or questions are always welcome.
Cause: Not given.
Friendly, comments, questions, or suggestions are welcome below!
The dark-haired alpha barked out a short laugh.
Murder of a senior officer.
Sherlock smiled softly allowing the small boy to explore his hand his smile widening when the pup decided Sherlock’s thumb would be a good snack.
Mike leaned, forwards
Sherlock writhed literally wrapping his legs around his alpha’s shoulders in ecstasy. A few heavy swipes from John’s tongue and a thin sweet stream of slick emptied into John’s mouth.
“ANSWER ME!!!!!!!” The blond took a step forward towering over the small boy.
It was a stupid mistake and John was kicking himself for making it.
“M’ hungry”
“I’m sorry, I’ve told Sherlock I’m sorry. Shouldn’t that be enough?”
Retrieving his collar from the table Sherlock knelt down baring his neck for John.
“John- John Watson.”
Sherlock stiffened at the command thinking he had somehow displeased his master and relaxing at the second part.
“Yeth Jawn pleathe.” Scooping up the hot to the touch omega John carried him easily to the bedroom barely able to resist the urge to mount him right there in the hallway.
“Why?”  A hastily added “mathter?” followed.
That was until John leaned to kiss him goodnight.
“John Watson,” was all it took for the voice to turn pleasant.
John stared after the feisty omega a moment before shaking his head to clear it.
The embrace was soft and tender as John ever so slowly pumped in and out in circular motions. Huge glistening cock pircing the omega lazily.
That alpha was sweet kind and then he ordered the teenage omega into his bed and nearly broke the thin body, impregnating the omega and beating him severely when the litter of pups didn’t make it. Throwing Sherlock back to the slavery-like a piece of rubbish.
Omegas bound or unbound were required to wear collars in public. Wearing a cuff or bracelet instead was a privilege given only to bound and married omegas.
“So I’m gonna run a bath for you after that I can wrap up your wounds okay?”
The tattooed man smirked.
“It’s not like he took my virginity, in fact, it was much nicer having sex with Thean than my other Mathers. He taught me how to read and write, I already knew French but he had a tutor teach me how to read and write it as well. He had a speech therapith help me with my lithp I used to be impothible to understand it was tho bad.”
Slowly as to not alarm his omega he inched forwards and copied the cupping movement, pouring each handful of water over the greasy black curls. The boy closed his eye contentedly as the alpha messaged his tender scalp with the minty shampoo. The male omega hummed appreciatively and gave John’s arm a slight lick of affection.
Pouting the boy murmured. “Seventeen”
(See the end of the chapter for
While the scent was inoffensive to John, the blond still bristled, pulling Sherlock even further into his lap and barring his teeth.  Sherlock burrowed deeper into John’s side with a whine.
“Sherlock, Love does he smell familiar to you?”
Sherlock smiled and relaxed back into the purple cushion content to let the pup lay safely on his chest.
“‘Yes, sorry just thinking.” The blond rubbed his eyes.
Sherlock slid off the bed until his feet hit the floor, snatching his blue dressing gown from the foot of the bed he rounded the mattress and once at John’s side nearest the door and pressed a soft kiss on the alpha’s forehead before exiting into the shower.
“Hey he’s your omega it was just a suggestion”
“Since you have two do you share? I mean I’d be willing to pay for a little fuck. I thought that girl was pretty but your boy is practically sin.”
“Deal”
“Andre’s new ‘master’ I presume. I don’t know if you are aware Sir but there are laws regarding proper diet for omegas and it does not appear you are following them.”
“You already did you, Berk!”
“Pretty good, I’m working on quitting the bottle.”
John pulled his mobile from his pocket and set Sherlock lightly down in a bus row encouraging the girl to sit also.
John himself fidgeted with his outfit in the mirror.
John rested on of his large hands on the boy's cheekbone tracing over the sinfully soft pink lips with a broad thumb.
He was technically in the cell for murder as well.
Molly finally spoke.
“Right then,” John sighed despondently. “New collar, something more comfortable.”
John tilted his head to watch a slight smiled gracing his lips.
The omega opened his eyes fully alert.
“Hush, shhhh I’m not getting rid of you, love. I just don’t want to be called ‘master’ please just call me John.”
John seized the tiny omega dragging him into a fierce hug.
“Of course, you can call anyone you’d like Love”
“Apologies, Mycroft great the man properly.”
the omega drew invisible circles on the alpha’s new striped jumper calming himself by inhaling the alpha’s strong scent; gunpowder, wool, something spicy, and strangely enough strawberry jam.
John Watson clutched his letter tightly in one hand as he limped heavily down the street. A letter that informed him that as a former soldier and an unbounded alpha he was required to accept an omega. The letter also had an address, date, and time.
*Yaaaaaaawwwwwwwwn* had a late night last night and I'm honestly not sure how i even managed to write today. Sorry for any mistakes.
“Come along you can just watch me this time.”
“Thank you still.”
“Come here” John commanded.
“Sherlock no one would know!”
“Hush love, I’m just going to take care of your bruises okay?” A small sigh of relief escaped and the tiny omega uncurled his legs and allowed John access.
Sherlock for his part was growing more apprehensive and restless by the minute. The last time he had been in a room like this is when was with Ryan and he had been only ten years old. He still remembered the severe beating he had gotten after the beta doing their paperwork had left.
Teasingly the alpha gave a quick squeeze to the boy’s plush arse and grinned at the high pitched squeak.
Without hesitation, Sherlock obeyed straddling the alpha’s lap teasingly. He was sitting in such a way that John couldn’t quite sink up into the boy.
Sherlock moaned drinking in the sight of his alpha-like one starved of water.
Sherlock yawned arching his back of the mattress his entire body quivering in a full-body stretch.
“Oh come here” John invited lifting the smaller male into his lap and deciding to leave the washing up till later. The raven-haired omega securely and eagerly curled in his arms John stood and made his way to the sitting room.
Sherlock wriggled a bit on the sofa from where he’d thrown himself in a fit frustration after his failure to reach the top shelf in the kitchen.
I am sorry this is a bit late. I had a horrible day yesterday and didn't have time to write. The private school I was supposed to be attending this coming year had a mix-up and does not have enough room for me to attend, and now with school starting back next month I have nowhere to attend and not enough time to apply. . . Friendly questions comments and suggestions are welcome.
John just shook his head. And pulled the boy to his feet towards the lavatory in the back of the shop.
Wordlessly the omega rolled over burying his face in the leather sofa with a small whimper. The alpha reared it’s head again upon seeing the thick scar lashes beneath the heavy oil coating and John was forced to bite back a snarl.
“Thank you, love.” John tugged the boy into his lap.
“Understood.”
The boy tensed and wrapped himself tighter around his alpha clinging on top of the man.
“Why?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“And you know Sherlock how?”
The ex-solider looked back at the boy. He was so young and small. The alpha pressed his lips together and sighed internally plucking up an Indiana Jones film and quickly put it back down. The cracking of a whip was not going to help his omega calm down. Instead, he chose a random musical that he knew would be free for violence.
But, John had said no, not tonight, perhaps by morning John would give in to his alpha and calm him. Sherlock would admit he was puzzled as to why his alpha hadn’t claimed him yet.
“Thank you Jawn!” He whispered and the boy leaning to the side to nuzzle his face in John’s chest.
“Hello” John poked the boy’s hip with his nose feeling rather playful.
“Mhm mhng gh camg” the boy mumbled into the soft jumper his words impossible to understand
“I-I want to stay.” John furrowed his brow. “Of course love… I wouldn’t sell you back.”
“Ready?” The omega adjusted slightly on the alpha’s lap and nodded “Pleathe John”. John brought the flat of his hand down across the pert behind hard enough to sting slightly but not anywhere near hard enough to leave a mark. “One” the omega whispered without prompting. Again John left his hand fall wincing at the sound of each smack. “thwo, three” the boy wriggled on John’s lap pale fingers wrapping around his ankle. “Four!” He gasped the smack slightly harder than the others. “Five” he whispered nuzzling into John’s leg.
John burst into the bathroom and stopped short.
Omegas could smell him and know that he wasn’t a violent man, they could smell the contentment rising from Sherlock and know he was safe.
Scenting the young omega deeply John buried his nose in his neck and allowed his free hand to explore the contours and ripples of the alabaster back tears pricking his eyes at the uneven ridges of lash marks.
“Okay fine.” Mike held up his hands in surrender.
“Back off” the teenager snarled “she’s mine, I found her first”
The muscular bond smiled and patted the dark curls.
"Molly's told me all about you, I heard you once.."
Without another word Sherlock had closed the album back into the small wooden box with the collar and ring. He slid it under the sitting room’s table and while John had yet to see his open it back up the blond could have sworn the box had moved atleast once every day.
So I'll won't be able to update everyday anymore and it will be more like two or three times a week. Sorry:(
“Besides you are a minor I’m 28”
Sherlock chewed on the corner of his lip and nodded.
Fearful of interrupting his alpha’s brooding Sherlock refrained from drinking any water as his bladder was already quite full and he did not want to have to ask permission.
“But come on get up we have a couple of visitors”
The Alpha in the chair flipped through the second folder on his lap and raised an eyebrow.
Blue-green eyes hesitated and pink lips made an abortive movement without sound.
Moments later a powerfully built man slightly shorter than John but larger than a beta rushed into the room wearing a white lab coat and dress slacks.
The blond simply shrugged stepping out of his orange jumpsuit.
John squeezed his eyes shut tighter and opened his mouth in jaw cracking yawn. The bed was warm from the mates combined body heat.
“There’s a thorage locker, I don’t know if it’th thill there but Master Thean had thomeone place my personal items there in cathe anything ever happened to him. Tho I could come and get them. I mean I know omegas aren’t thupposed to have belongingth. But Thean did give me things he thaid I could keep. Could we get it?”
Molly enveloped the younger omega in a hug a second time John being pulled into the embrace by the fact that he was still holding Sherlock.
“I wanna ride you”
Friendly comments, questions or suggestions are always welcome!
The house was cozy, warm, and well-lived in.
He quickly hailed a cab and opened the door. The cabbie scowled at the filthy omega and then at John. “It goes in the back.” It? That was just low. John was about to protest when he noticed his omega looking slightly confused and tugging away from the interior of the cab and towards the boot.
“Fuck Sherlock you’re pretty.”
Friendly comments, questions, or sugggestions are welocme below!
“Aaron, Chole, and Andre” Molly supplied the names from over her shoulder.
John had watched with fear as Sherlock ran his pale fingers over one particular photo. The man, Sean John assumed, had his eyes crinkled up in laughter, arm thrown around a sheepishly grinning Sherlock. The pair were both covered in flour Sherlock’s bouncy curls dusted white the silver and gold collar still gleaming under the bright light of the massive kitchen.
John slowly deposited the omega on the sofa and rummaged through the bathroom cabinet and lifting up the medication triumphantly John darted back to the omega.
John didn’t want to appear weak.
“Now.”
John gently set the boy down on the steps to retrieve the boxes.
The younger male pulled back to press a tender chaste kiss on his alpha’s lips.
John allowed his hand to smooth over the minuscule bump of the omega’s stomach.
“You seem like a good alpha, but in case you prove me wrong my alpha is a DI for Scotland Yard and he would not hesitate to have Sherlock removed from you, should abuse of any sort become evident.”
While naked neither party seemed to be pushing more than heavy snogging.
John bared his teeth when the other alpha let his gaze linger a moment too long on the boy’s pale arse. Sherlock limped steadily to the metal exam table John followed behind despite the other alpha saying it really wasn’t necessary
“Mmmmm” was the boy’s only response as he burrowed deeper into John, hiding his face in the alpha’s armpit.

“Damn it, John, what did you do to him!” Sherlock flinched at Greg’s tone and stepped closer to John.
John grinned against the plush arse and rose his head, eyes dark with lust to meet the younger male’s eyes.
“You be needing help to get everything inside?” The beta nodded his head towards 221 as they pulled up to the curb.
John growled deep in his throat scaring the beta clerk and making an omega mother, his alpha, and three pups turn to look at him curiously.
“Military?”
Sherlock hesitated and glanced up at his alpha for confirmation.
How could this be the world he lived in?
“Roll over”
“Up Jawn, we might have a little extra time if you hurry.”
“Mike apparently” the other alpha laughed good-naturedly.
Instantly alert the blond alpha sat bolt upright to stare at the empty side of the bed. Scrambling up John grabbed his gun from his bedside drawer and ran into the sitting room.
“Would you rather talk alone?”
“You would have an omega sit on your furniture?  How positively novel!.”
