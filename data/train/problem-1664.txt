"Nor do I?" The idea was mildly horrifying.
"Don't want to," said Euros mutinously. There was a brief butterfly moment as thoughts flitted over her expression. Then she smiled and it was Sherlock's real person smile. "But fine. I'll go."
"Obviously she is not," said Sherlock. "If you paid attention, you'd realize that some form of disease afflicted the figure from before and this girl. They're both Humans at different stages of the disease."
"Of course," it boomed. "The Federation no longer exists. When the Borg invaded Earth, Starfleet's local defenses attempted to channel fusion energy from the Sol star through the lunar defense systems to destroy the Borg ship, which resulted in a chain reaction that destroyed the entire system along with the Borg ship. With two of its founding worlds, Vulcan and Earth, destroyed, and the Andorian reproduction rates reaching an extinction level point, the Federation quickly fell to invasions by its nearest neighbors."
Liquid crystal memory
His first time choosing.
His head hurt, because as he recalled that meant Sherlock's parents. "But why the," John gestured at the helmets with their pointed noses, "if you're human?" Silly question, but he was curious and couldn't remember if he'd asked Sherlock.
He asked about his options to protest the decision. She sent him links to three forms. "These may take a few months to process. We have to process all the records for personnel who are reaching their five year mark, as well as our normal duties handling new personnel." She shook her head. "Really, the Borg were hell on paperwork."
"I… Sh'Alaack paused. "I won't." She looked nervously at John, who knew that was his cue to leave.
He was happy enough to fall asleep time to time enfolded by kilometers of an alpha making like an octopus, and to indulge in the games they liked to play.
His choice.
"About fucking time!" Donovan came over the com.
She tilted her head towards him.
"One of the people I woke up with, one of the engineers I left behind in the engine room looked just like Tomalak," said Bihr urgently. "Do you think he could be a Romulan?"
When they'd had less physical ongoing contact – the beginning or that time the Trelane trapped Sherlock on the planet with the strange Robin Hood fantasy – there were fewer fertilized eggs. When they had more contact - the time they were captured by gambling incorporeal consciousness and made to mate as part of creating new race of warriors for gladiatorial games – they had more. Never more than thirteen, which John had begun to think of as the Bakerstreet dozen. Never less than four.
So, it was a bit of a surprise when Sherlock said, almost hesitantly, "Have you ever considered, in a less painful way, and science of course, and genetic review of any fertilized specimens, and if I can get a uterine replicator, a…"
"No," they looked around the room. Smiled softly. More to themselves than to John. Smiling inwardly. "The Bakerstreet is as good a place to raise the child of a god."
"Willfully, perhaps," said Grendel. He muttered under his breath, "As soon get in bed with a snake." Then louder, "It means that despite the other Alignments very strong request that you remain here, we can reach a separate compromise."
"The DNA test. While John turned into a little slut sniffing around every alpha that came by, you should know what you're getting into there." She rattled the table again. Shifting side to side in her seat. "I know he kept that up when he went to the academy. I could smell it on him when we went for our visits."
John had sent information for possible drug therapies as soon as his research reached that point, but the progression from getting the information to testing to human trials had been agonizing. The first two treatments had been failures. In the end, John had found the cure analyzing genetics from every member of his family descended from Anthea cross referenced with Connor and Billy's DNA.
Harry. His twin, who he'd seen was spiraling, but hadn't understood why. Had been so wrapped up in his own life that he hadn't stopped her decent.
He limped a lot.
Sherlock said, "Obvious." Because it was obvious. Equally obvious was that John was now an alpha to Sherlock's omega. The gift of Apollo. An opportunity to experience what John felt like. To know. A perfect birthday.
"Then why did you come in?" asked Sherlock sharply, before saying, "Ah, you have not been able to find Moriarty."
John bought himself some time by replicating a butcher's knife for himself. A few onions. His knife technique was good. He quickly diced a white onion into fragments. "It's not you." A horrible beginning. He ripped the skin off another onion. Wiped a few tears away, because onions. Peeled off a truth. If not the more immediate one. "When I was younger, I wanted to get into Starfleet so bad. Then there was dad." Chop. Chop. Chop. "Sometimes I forget. Sometimes I think about him. Killander said that Dad targeted certain parts of the colony population. The ones who weren't Augments, and I've gone over the manifest of who he selected to die. He rigged the lottery. Prick wasn't wrong." Chop. Chop. Chop.
It was the sort of axle that John could wrap around and around.
"Getting a leg over," said Odo. "That may be a difficult alibi to establish."
"Doctor Culverton, I have access to the entire Starfleet medical database and my own experience since being activated. Mr. Wilkes' symptoms are consistent with celebium poisoning. You yourself said the other personnel from your expedition died of celebrium exposure."
John had not gone through pseudo heat. He was going through pseudo heat. Thinking about his alluringly sultry scent would not solve the essential problem that John had regressed in age.
He also had to wonder what would happen if word got out. It was bound to eventually. What if beings thought all Augments had that special something in their blood?
They kept going through the woods until they finally outpaced their maddened friends.
There was the Tale of Teleros the Tellerite, a gastronomic comedy. His mum was droll as Teleros. His father was wry as the new neighbor. His cousins made pratfalls across the stage until the final scene where the dinner was saved. Everything ending in laughter.
"Okay, and the twee kid," said Ginger Sparkles.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip%C3%B3n
"Yes, Mama," came the aggrieved reply.
"No." Then Mummy sighed. "Sherlock, you can't go back. The window closed while you were in treatment. That time window won't open again for another three hundred and sixty-four years. If you were to open the portal now, it would open to a completely different point in history. The last time moment to go through was when you crashed on this planet."
Mummy hissed, familiar eyes narrow, "Perhaps it was a weakness to desire some part of Mycroft back. But I did not simply clone Mycroft. I do not have clones of any of you."
No surprise. Sherlock had been going non-stop at the Exo-Genetics conference on Andor for the last week. He'd wanted to drag John to every panel, and join Sherlock visiting various cutting edge research facilities solving the mysteries of science, but as John had had to remind his great git several times, John had his own career and interests.
Sherlock picked up the only Ferengi left on the planet, who cowered in his body shield, and said, "Send the code to call for transport to the larger bird of prey."
John had a very bad, sinking feeling. He opened his mouth, but couldn't find words. He closed his mouth.
"Huh." Mollyhoo absorbed that idea. Titrated it into every stratum of her.
He ended up beaming down after all.
Eva ran over to the wall of ferns at one end of the promenade and asked Ms. Hebron all sorts of questions. Eva asked lots of questions. Sometimes, Connor though about that one time they'd all lost their memory. He thought must be what it was like to be Eva.
Multiple forms walked about the room with heavy metalic steps.
Admittedly, part of the reason had been to support his mother-in-law's request that he encourage John to visit Harry. Sherlock reasoned there could be no better encouragement than to drop off supplies, provide the annual maintenance, and let John's own strong sense of loyalty direct his actions.
. I was Benedict and Clare was my Beatrice and, she made me swear to kill my best friend for love of her. If you're not willing to kill for love, then it's not really love." Harry looked away. "That's not an excuse. There's no excuse. But that squamous frell came to me and wanted me to betray my family. I didn't mean to… no!" She straightened in her seat. A Watson, she looked him in the eyes. "Fuck penny or pound. I meant to do it, and once done, I knew they must all be dealt with."
As it was, she'd done a discrete scan on John when she'd first met him and had been glad that he shared less than one percent DNA with Mycroft.
"But Daddy, you like what a filthy boy I am." He walked up to Sherlock in his stupid purple silk jim jams. "Because you're my daddy, and I belong to you. Please, Daddy. Baby's been so lonely without his daddy. Won't you tuck me in?"
None of this was on.
"You do not want to do that," said Sh'Alaack. "He's taken the evening off to spend some time with Doctor Watson." Sh'Alaack rubbed her hands together as if washing them.
"Yeah," sighed Billy. "Connor is beside himself to think that he'll have to leave. The first time in his life he could just be a child has been here. I… I heard from… someone that Beta Aurigae has a large Augment population, but I don't know anyone there." Billy's heart rate was quick. His pheromones reeked of fear. A sharp tinge.
Veema said, "The 6
"I was thinking that you have a long time before you need to be an adult and that you should enjoy being a child now," said John with what he hoped was a convincing smile.
Sherlock landed lightly on a mat. He really hadn't thought this through. "Francis Drake." After all, he couldn't very well introduce himself as William, Sherlock, or Scott.
He felt proud that his mate had chosen him again. His mate's scent enriching wonderfully. Painfully. Driving Sherlock on to answer his mate's commands.
Sherlock breathing rate increased. Harshened. He cleared his throat. "So, very hot. The kind of heat with only one cure." The naughty Sugar Baby curled up inside the mass interphasic transomater. He said, 'Daddy, I'm sick. Please, Daddy, I need a little prick of medicine,' and he rubbed his little sugar bum all over the inside of that machine."
Trelane wearing something that wouldn't have been amiss on a sixteenth century English poet, all in black velvet, was sitting miserably under a tiny pine.
It had been hours since Billy had sent a message saying that John hadn't arrived.
Sherlock lifted his arms and John threaded his head between them to lean against him. It didn't entirely fix the essential problem, but it felt good to be close.
"I believe so. Although, after a thousand years as pure mental energy, that blurred. Was irrelevant."
Mr. Stonn explained how they worked when Eva asked.
If you have enjoyed reading these voyages check out my other (much shorter, because this is the longest thing I've ever done) works in AO3 or check out my profile for info on things posted elsewhere.
Robert, "But please call me, Bob," Frankland got the tour of Tantalus asylum's facilities from the outgoing asylum director, Jacqui Stapleton.
John held his gaze and made a Lordis stretch using the potions table for leverage. John was burning up. Sweat beaded on his forehead. He wanted his alpha now. Deserved him.
He paused as she snorted.
"How do you know how many crew they have?" asked Billy pulling a hypo out of the medkit.
It was never Sherlock's intention to seek his husband out during the day. They had separate interests. Separate careers. But he had the ship's computer tell him when John went to their quarters in the middle of the day.
He looked at Bashir. "Too bad they took the books."
While some part of Sherlock eased on waking with John nesting in his bed in his quarters, a place they had never spent any time before, with full consciousness that part would tighten again knowing the cost was too high.
Billy watched his grandfather watch Connor bounce happily around the living room as if he hadn't tried to throw a chair through the window trying to get out. He watched his grandfather when Connor asked, "When can I start school again. I know became really behind and I want to catch up." There hadn't been time to start school after they'd arrived. Had been taking a break to get to know each other and then biology happened. "There were only a few kids on the Bakerstreet. Are there lots of children at the schools here? Do you think they'll like me?
The ship lurched, which really wasn't the reaction he'd expected. Tricorders generally didn't do that when he blew them up. Still, no time to think as they went through the doors and into the smoky bridge. Billy slammed the medkit into the head of the night shift pilot, just as John registered what was on the ship's main monitor.
John thought about the various encounters over the years with their great-great-somethings. "Yeah, they do seem to like to do that sort of thing."

She'd seen him dressed like Roman Legionnaire and she'd seen the same side of the Dominion he had in the Gamma Quadrant. He could take her communication. As soon as he came on, she said, "You are fucking insane? You can't the fuck give Watson a fucking commission and transfer all the fucking senior staff off the Bakerstreet. Holmes will eat any new crew you send out here alive. Then he'll blow the fucking ship and then where will you be?
Connor grabbed the rock under Sestre's arm and rolled it towards the creature.
John stroked his fingers through not-Sherlock's hair. It was just as soft and silky as Sherlock's.
Sherlock sighed. "Boring." Then recoiled a bit at John's look. "Fine. It's fascinating. Utterly riveting."
Lucy cornered him while he was washing his hair in the sink. "I warned you this would happen."
She sniffed. "Or not. Move."
Connor ate some soup to give himself a moment to think things through. "They're probably just lonely, because there aren't that many of them. Anyway, they didn't put me in the A.S. class. They put me in class with you."
Sherlock grumbled and John splashed Mollyhoo. She should only stay if she wasn't going to upset Sherlock.
Martha sipped from her sweet little china cup. She'd been particular about taking the one with the lilies as it was her favorite. "
Ironically given his purpose in wanting to observe Karidian, was that she relaxed in his presence. During the comedic performance in the cargo bay, there was a frenetic energy to all the performers. Elise's energy creating a feedback look to the others that came through as comedy, which had the children giggling. When he approached to congratulate them on their performance, that energy dissipated and she suggested tea in the galley.
"It had to be yours," said Mummy without a change in expression. "I had no choice in that."
"Do you know why we've been ordered here?"
That after everything Frankland had done to her, she'd shot Frankland. That Frankland himself might have been under the control of this Adams person.
Normally, William would be listening to Victor. Following his every word. Instead, he was quiet. Deep in his own thoughts. Chin sat next to him. Dared to place her hand next to his on the balance beam and brush her little finger against his. He looked up at her and nodded. Curled his little finger over hers.
The Klingons ambled off presumably to get very high on Denosian amber and very low on blood wine.
While he was away, Harry grew out her hair. Put on a silver ring. Threw the gold one at John when he announced he wasn't joining the theater company. That his dream of joining Starfleet and becoming a doctor was real.
Victorious had John.
Lurin had the lobes for success.
"Hush, now," said Hudson, sending Donovan a quick glare. "I felt that woman take the captain's consciousness, which means there's something to take back. We have a choice between going to Sigma I, which is a very small irradiated rock. Sigma VI, a heavily glaciated planet, and Sigma CXCII, which is a frozen moon to Sigma CXC, but it has some volcanic activity."
Amazing Sparkles moved a little closer on that remark, which was lovely. Wonderful. He looked down at the outfit that his Master – possibly his spouse – definitely his lover – had placed on his body. Felt the tightness of the lacing holding him as if he were in a continual embrace. "You may address that question to the captain."
Thil wanted to pick the story tonight. Thil wanted Papa Ishros – because he would do all the voices – to read them the story of Aidalas the Constant before bed. He loved the part about Aidalas defended the honor of his shen Mother in a duel with the clan leader that had tried to kill her after slaying all of the clan leader's troops, but Papa Shroleb said, "That's not actually a children's story."
Sherlock's hand kept stroking his hair. John felt his lips press against the top of John's head. John shifted to cuddle closer, wanting to scent him. Needing him. As he moved, he felt Sherlock's cock, hard and erect under his thigh. He froze. Suddenly aware of the constant slickness between his thighs. His cock gave a little jump. He was very aware of the way his sensitive nipples brushed against the fabric of his shirt. Very aware of the heat emanating from Sherlock's body. Very aware of Sherlock's cock. His big, fat, beautiful cock that would feel so wonderful if he shoved it in John.
John pulled a body stabilization cast, a thermal blanket, and a hypospray out of his pack. "If her pulse is thready, give her two ccs of pheladrohol." He shouldered his rucksack and swallowed. "Be careful." He set off down the canyon.
She was locked in with her own thoughts for the night. Which was better than most of her former associates were faring in the holding area in the cargo bay and brig.
Finally, they reached the entry bay to the asylum and penal colony, and were transferred inside the dome of the facility. The inward curve of the dome was an egg shell blue. Green grass gently rustled on a slightly sloping hillside to what looked like some sort of quaint village from a historical vid. As he understood it, every night the dome sky dimmed into a brilliant sunset and then a simulation of the local night sky.
The tapestry fell over the alcove door behind John. "So," he said more to scrub his brain, "ever hear of the story Frozen?"
Sherlock smiled, which was not agreement. Anyway, John had never been capable of observing when Sherlock followed him. It was a constant in their relationship.
"Yeah, a few things have happened since you went down to the planet and got body swapped. We got word that the 221C hadn't arrived on Beta Aurigae. We went to investigate, but found nothing but debris." Donovan helped him to his feet.
Still, seeing John touch his cum covered fingers. Smile. Laugh. Sigh again. It was good. John would be fine. His career would be fine.
Finally, they came into a wide open chamber full of fascinating bioluminescent rock formations. He was about to explain that to Connor, when Connor pointed. There were two of the creatures in a large shallow hollow in the room. One creature was far larger. Its surface was cracked and pitted, charred in some places, as if it had been subjected to an explosion. Perhaps the one the shop keeper had described. The other was much smaller. Only half the first creature's mass. It had a red pulsing wound where Sestre's father and Ms. Hebron had shot it.
He couldn't have.
"It's empty," said Sherlock, who had every reason to know that it should be empty.
John held Sherlock's hand all the way down to Sickbay. He only let go when he needed both hands to pull a well-worn box out of the bottom drawer of his desk. He turned on the privacy shield while Sherlock examined its contents.
Not-Sherlock dropped it to the floor and cupped John's face in his hands. He licked at the blood on his face. Delicately. Sweetly. With a sort of awestruck expression. "Was this your plan all along? To draw Victorious out of his palace. Get him away from his guards. Give our children everything we dreamed of? Was this why you left?"
The sickbay doors opened and his body walked in the door. It said in a cheerful tone, "How is our patient? Still alive? Great to see. Just great."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633676/
Sherlock looked at John worriedly. "Are you angry?" He had that brain racing to avoid consequences look.
"The end," said Sherlock very quickly.
"Nerve damage healed I see, and…" Killander looked around the room, "where is your cane exactly?"
John's twin, Harry, glared at him. Sherlock found being near her somewhat disturbing. Monozygotic rather than fraternal twins. No longer identical, years and determined effort had seen to that, but with so many similarities, her alpha scent put Sherlock on edge. Made him want to pull away. She appeared to feel the same, as she turned and immediately fell into a dispute with her former sexual partner, who was still dressed in her princess costume.
Killander, it figured, had no idea what went on at the chapel. "The logs show that you left campus frequently. What were you doing? Making contacts with other Augment dissidents?"
Sarabeth and Mollyhoo sat down next to them dangling bare legs into the water. Mollyhoo sighed as she sat down. Looked everywhere but at them. She and Sarabeth didn't say anything for a long time, so John ignored them. Kissing Sherlock was more interesting.
Donovan wrestled him through a door. The holosuite. They walked into a simulation of sickbay. Julian was waiting. "Yeah," said Donovan. "Dick also didn't know just how many places we've set up for to turn Julian on." She pointed at Julian. "No fucking jokes."
When he got up, he saw the orange sky of Ligos VII through a fissure straight above. Donovan, Cho, and Washington came around the corner. Donovan said, "The explosion didn't disrupt the force shield by the entrance."
She was looking happily at the door and chewing grain for the next batch of beer, when Sarabeth said, "I'd gotten so used to alphas trying to kill us, I'd forgotten how good they can smell."
Some of the Augments on the ship were certain that adolescents couldn't go into heat and used exclamation points to prove their point. Others had all sorts of stories of friends of friends. Khatri wanted to know if they'd be having this discussion if the captain had become an adolescent. There was quickly deleted post that the captain was a teenager based on his behavior. Owen made a rambly post about how the worst part of pseudoheat had been the horniness, which was just like Owen and ridiculous. Everyone piled on him for reinforcing negative stereotypes about omegas. Khatri tried to defend Owen, but was crushed by a tide of exclamations and emoji's.
John didn't have the words to say whatever it was he wanted. Instead he spread Sherlock's hand and rested his own against it palm out. The hands with their husband rings.
Sherlock felt the weight of those words and focused on the important point. "If I am so broken, send me back!" Sherlock didn't remember much about the last few months. He remembered enough. "If I’ve learned anything about any of you over the years, it's that your children are replaceable. Lose a Mycroft. Clone a Mycroft. Euros acts out of line, freeze her. Euros breaks my mind, hide me away. For all I know you have a clone of me somewhere. Frozen and stacked like cordwood. To be decanted if I died, ready to thrown into the past as needed."
He sighed. "The answer is more complicated than that." He pulled on that smile that never put anyone at ease. "It's not what I would do, but what he'd want me to do. On consideration, I think your father gave you his answer to how he felt about what you were doing."
"Okay," said Connor. They listened to the lecture about ferns. His mum hadn't come back yet.
She did not suggest that they should have perhaps approached the Ferengi if they had been looking to trade.
Brittanus was not so sure that they would be able to commit so wholly. They steeled themselves in that moment to bear what must be done and seize what advantage they could.
"I can only speak to what information I've been programmed with. I was created to mimic an existing person and yet I was given constraints. Even with curiosity enabled, I have limits. I would not wish to become those scientists so full of arrogance. But it also takes arrogance to think you can crack the nature of the universe." Julian looked down at his hands. His smile was wry. "But you do happen to reside on a ship whose captain is the most curious Human I've ever met, who also happens to be an expert in exo-biology, and with whom you have already partnered on significant research. You'll be able to partner with John on the genome-wise-association-study he's planning. Perhaps ask for Captain Holmes' help understanding Augment sexuality."
"Then you did not meet Ishros," said not-Shroeb.
She thought about that as she waited for word if John, Hudson, or the crew on the planet had made their escape.
Thil and his twin, Shor, giggled, because that was the point of all the stories Auntie Harry sent them. They were for big kids. Still Thil protested, "But it's a good story."
"You've got to know that as soon as you started talking, no one could take their eyes away from you." John slid the lab coat off his shoulders. "I couldn't take my eyes off you, and I'm hard to impress."
Mama G held up the club. "Can't leave this in there while he's being like this."
Frankland said, "It really is a pity that you're no longer commissioned and that your husband elected not to join you, but we can't have everything. All we can hope for is drive off the hounds of pain, and fill hearts with warmth and love. Now that John has joined us that will even be more possible. We'll be able to reach so many more hearts"
That was pretty much his last thought as he turned to look at the cause of the rumble behind him.
He headed for the lift doors and then paused. "John, why aren't you following me?" He glared at John. "Of course you're supposed to follow me. We can take their statements from the monitor in our quarters."
"Tell me they weren't trying to get her off planet. They can't trust Ish."
Instead of going into heat, she experienced horrific cramps. Then the part where the past was made of tiny organisms trying to disrupt her intestinal tract took over. She became extremely nauseous. No diarrhea thankfully, but plenty out the other end.
There were a series of pops, set off by Julian, as every stick of purple chalk, paint, glitter, or other purple thing that Julian and the children could find and deploy along the route, blew up.
Sherlock struggled against his bonds and shouted into the gag.
John didn't want to speak. He never wanted to speak. He opened his eyes into Sherlock's. Pupils dilated. Always observing him. He pushed Sherlock's right hand in the direction of what he wanted. Sherlock's smile was unutterably sweet.
Other children meant Lucy and Hudson. Course, just at the moment, he was most likely very, very, very, very, oh, so very pregnant. Little clumps of cells looking to cling to the cell walls of his uterus like cancer in a few days to a week.
The Hippocrates lurched forward in a way it really wasn't designed to do. Spinning as it went under the remains of the Cortez, massive hold doors open, and scooping up air and debris and people. Parson's trembled as he slapped the controls for the holds a little more forcefully than was necessary.
"What!" Sherlock grabbed John's pad, but that was exactly what the idiots at Starfleet had opted to do. He considered a late night raid to threaten Killander to… or contacting Th'Azetron, or Mycroft, or,"
There were few private spaces in the palace. Sherlock had crafted those islands carefully.
Mycroft looked down at his brother's small still form under the white medical sheet. Eyes closed. Absent of the energy and activity that had been a part of him from the moment he was decanted from the uterine replicator, a tiny wailing bundle in Mummy's hands.
"I said I would get sick if I didn't get to sickbay," said John, who decided the floor was a very good place to be right then. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he curled up as tightly as he could in a futile attempt to tell the cramps twisting his guts to fuck off. This would have to happen while he wearing only his robe while his clothes dried.
Hudson correctly interpreted that, because she said, "We've traced the ion trail from the ship to the Sigma Draconis system. There are three M class planets there."
From what he'd seen of Warden Barrymore, the man had a tritanium rod inserted very far up his abdominal cavity. He'd be surprised if the man did anything that deviated from regulation.
"Great," John didn't have time to argue semantics. "Let's go rescue Sherlock."
"You're brilliant." John stepped closer. Sherlock could feel the warm from his body. "You're beautiful." He plucked the unnecessary glasses off Sherlock's face and he hadn’t realized how heavy they'd been. How light his face felt without them. Free. How they had created a sheen of sweat that accentuated the subtle push of John's breath. Faintly sweet. He'd been chewing a clove. "You're oblivious to just how amazing you are. Would you be interested in… sharing a drink?"
Sherlock was also aware that he was the one who had suggested that they could outrun the storm in time to reach the Bakerstreet, which mercifully John had not brought up.
"Which affects language skills, memory, and emotion," said John feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the rain.
When John came, he drank that down. Breathing quietly as John loosened his grip in Sherlock's hair. Pulled away. John whispered, "You are my favorite. I'm going to send all the others right off. You're the only one I need."
Sherlock looked around quickly. The scent of the dead alphas was strong. There needed to be less dead alpha in their cave. Sherlock picked up the ankles of both. Sherlock carried the bodies out of the cave, dragged them up the valley, and threw them over the wall at the top of the valley as a warning.
"That's it!" shouted Supersmart, "Obviously, not the injection. But there could be a localized energy field that's interfering with our memories." They scanned the room with the tricorder. "There's it is.
"Yeah, well, Harry will be different. It's better to see her on my own." John hadn't seen Harry since what happened had happened.
To any and all, I hope you've enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
"It's only been a few weeks," said Hudson. "I know you're concerned about her, but this will be good for her."
It was going to be fine. John was going to figure this out. The Head of Genetics at a Beta Aurigae university had reached out to him in response to John's genetics study. Not that Billy had discussed the results of John's initial research with Connor. He didn't want to worry his son over something that might never be.
If very un-professional in that robe he kept insisting on wearing.
Sherlock snarled at them. The alpha mewed submissively and exposed their neck. Sherlock could have left them there, but there was food to feed the alpha and by their scent, they were a juvenile. A teen. The pride needed more alphas. Sherlock could not be everywhere. Sherlock reached down and pulled the alpha out. Carried the alpha back to the cave over his shoulder. The alpha shivered with Sherlock's every step.
Soft beeps from the shuttle. The whir from the engine. The shifting sounds of the supplies being transferred down to the colony. Several chairs had been removed to make way for stacks of lashed down crates. They were full of larger items that couldn't be replicated inside the facility below, because there weren't facilities for a large scale replicator. Smaller boxes held infra-sensory drugs for the asylum that couldn't be replicated.
"Come," said Noonian. "Brit should hear of this psychic accident to determine if it may be of use in their experiments."
She forced herself to focus on her current mission, which was to negotiate on behalf of the 23
, which abstained, as was typical.
She wasn't abandoning her people if she went home. The other Bihr would return and step into the place that she'd left. That Bihr would meet this Ishros and… it hurt to see him so wounded. When she'd asked about his bondmates, he'd flinched. "They thought if we simply lay down, the Khan would leave us be. They don't see what I do."
Soo-Lin leaned over. "Section 31 is based in London."
That meant something John was going to do something foolish and he was going to die and it was going to be Sherlock's fault. If he'd simply worked on inventions for Victorious while John was away. But he couldn't have. Not while his light was gone.
"I also didn't know," said Second Father. "And I had nothing to with creating the... monster that damaged you."
John was at loose ends for the first time in his adult life. He had nowhere he needed to be. It felt like all the sorrow in the universe pooled in his veins. Almost thirty years old and going through adolescence.
They laid in a course, while John told Sherlock's body in no uncertain terms that he was not allowed to die. Then set to work on figuring out how to trigger functions to get it moving.
They gathered in the temple's main chamber. Incense smoke curled about the chamber. The arching dome of the roof dark. The space only lit by thick tallow candles on tall brass stanchions and the golden light sparkling within the ancient arch of the Atavachron at the center of the room.
Never betrayed she knew how to work it.
"I should say that my step-mother says that. As I recently found out that she's not my birth mother."
Sherlock growled to let the alpha know she shouldn't approach his mate. To stay where she was and die. John rapped the ground with the butt of a spear to let the alpha know that he agreed with Sherlock.
Greg had spent months stuck playing gumshoe. Then months commanding Roman legions in endless wars. A vacation world he'd been happy to escape.
"Show me, you owe me that, Mother."
John was still sufficiently loose from his orgasm to be fine with it.
They were taken through a door that required two keycards to enter, and then finally into a cell with a toilet hole in the floor and that was it for furnishings.
"Well, you're about to. It's full of singing and dancing and you're going to benefit from my childhood obsession with it because," he waved back at the alcove, "as I recall, singing in your own head can keep the voices down."
John sighed.
After some thought, John took the hypo and gave the medkit's case to Billy. "If anyone comes at us, hit them with this."
There was quite probably a very different story from Hudson's perspective that Sherlock had no access to.
"So we can defeat out enemies and complete our quests," said Thil, his antennae standing up proudly. His twin, Shor, looked at them carefully from Thil's right hand side.
"As I said, it's in all our best interests if he's returned to the prince," said Owen. "You were assigned inferior reclamation duty after… your fall from grace. Stay off the ketry and find the Prince's pet before he has the Executioner fire up the anti-matter chambers for all of us."
For one thing, the thought of Mummy and sex, and particularly Mummy and the sex that had created the first Mycroft was deeply disturbing. The thought that what had just occurred, Mummy had gone through the same. With another alpha with an equal lack of control. A Beta Human taking advantage of Mummy's genetics. He didn't want to think about it.
As always, Killian McCarthy setup the new pool.
Were walking hand in hand when they came into the entry cave to the scent of copper. Shattered pottery. An unattended fire. No one guarding the door. Screaming. They ran towards the sound. John knew what they'd find.
"Lieutenant Commander Martha Hudson suggested that I come see you."
While the door camera focused on them, John staged blankets on a bunk on the far side of the room to provide the illusion of a couple of fake people trying to sleep, and crawled to the door. Getting the door panel off was the easy part. Sliding the plastic between the door circuits was harder, given the softness of the plastic. Eventually, there was a slight sigh from the door's power unit as the door unlocked.
Ginger Sparkles tapped a control. "He's already outside the ship." The screen shifted. They watched a space whale squirt away from the Bakerstreet.
The red Breen trilled after its long silence.
"Ah," sighed Garak. "Pity. I'll pull up some designs while you contact your sibling."
Sherlock looked around him. The mountains looming over the valley, the ice cliffs, everything was strangely familiar. As if in a dream.
Mollyhoo rubbed Vesha's shoulder. "Anyway, while we're still lucid, we do what we can to close off the entrance with stones. Have those of us who are umm… affected… move up into one of the higher chambers. But mostly…"
While at the same time, not knowing if it mattered. With no voice. With no body.
Sherlock growled at the alpha. He pulled himself up to his full height and bared his teeth. John was silent, but he held his spear at the ready. The alpha moved behind Sarabeth, grinning. A form of bared teeth.
She looked at him significantly. He looked at Billy, who was worrying his hands. Sherlock said, "Ah, you've heard that personnel are likely to be reassigned, and are concerned about your status, or non-status as a citizen of no planet."
When he saw Doctor Watson's call for participants in a genome-wide-association-study, he knew immediately he had what he needed. It was all there written out. A request for participants in a study to identify a trait in the general population resulting from a specific set of genes passed on by three of the original British Augments. A three that might include Khan Brittanus. Those participants that matched a specific set of genetic markers, helpfully provided with the study, would be asked to provide phenotypic information about their behavior between the ages of thirteen to sixteen. Well, okay, technically, it's a PheWAS. i.e., he knows a trait, and is trying to map the genes associated with it, but I'll stick with spelling out GWAS in when talking about the study. Yes, the study will keep coming up. This, like Lucy's study was for her, a career defining project for John.
John took Sherlock's hand. "Let's go save you."
"Prince… balls… fucking..." which could mean anything given Donovan.
The Bakerstreet did not have the facilities to take several thousand people anywhere, but Starfleet quickly ordered a large capacity troop transport when Command learned that there was an ion ship available for study in return. It wasn't a violation of the Prime Directive. Although, a certain degree of obfuscation about the current technical level of the Eymorg and Morg was called for.
Course that would be when the window shattered in the gymnasium. "Oh, for fuck's sake." John ran into the room, but whichever children had been inside, they were already out the window and gone.
"No, indeed," said the alpha. "There are indications on your hands and civilian clothing that you are associated with on board childcare."
"Where is William?"
"I remember." John nodded. Nodded again. "Yeah. So, I'll see you in our quarters." He left Sherlock looking at the tricorder.
There were many things Sherlock could have said. Many feelings he didn't quite know how to process without John standing next to him. He looked over Chin's shoulder to where Grendel was smiling at Billy. Where John was standing. He said, "We should rejoin the party." As Chin turned around, Sherlock said, "Good luck. When John agreed to marry me, it was the most fortunate moment of my life."
"About your father?" A question for a question. His mum poured him another cup of tea. At his nod, she said, "No, I knew he came to me haunted. Broken. Something grand dropped from a great height and shattered by the fall. I knew it was why he was so reckless when we first got together. Your grandfather asked me if I really wanted to take on someone with that many jagged edges inside." She sighed. "But I was already in love, and his broken pieces fit with mine. I wish I could say he calmed down after the accident where he was so badly injured, and I broke my arm, but that took several miscarriages and the two of you."
Sherlock swallowed.
When his knot released him, he crawled in between them. Nuzzling and licking everyone in the pile. Laughing in delight as John licked his cock clean.
Sherlock's voice came through the com. "I know, John. It's good to see you."
"That's right." Hudson called up a schematic of their route. "The Federation is opening negotiations for a peace treaty with the Tamarians, a race who speaks entirely in references to commonly understood stories. The Federation negotiation team has requested a theater troop capable of performing a wide assortment of plays from throughout the Federation to help establish a shared language that can be used in in the treaty."
Sh'Alaack told herself to focus on her work.
They were only an hour away when word came from Queue base. There had been an accident. For some reason after dinner, Sholto had gone off by himself in the hills above the base and fallen to his death in the dark.
The falcon cannot hear the falconer, things fall apart
He didn't really want John to finish any time soon.
It had been horrible enough the last time.
For once, Mycroft didn’t look to Mummy. He released Sherlock so he could get up.
"No," Trelane put a heavy level of scorn in that no. Jupiter's gravity levels of scorn. "They're the ones who told me to get out of the Continuum for a bit and leave them alone. They suggested I come talk to you."
It was war.
"Didn't know about Mum's plan," muttered a kid with bright blue hair and his grandfather Noonian's complexion.
That they were mining.
They picked up their bags and went to the dry dock. Stonn waited while Sestre boarded the transport that would carry Sestre to New Vulcan. Then having seen to his youngest son, went to compose missives to his two older children so they would know about his change in circumstances, and be able to follow the news accordingly.
Connor leaned into Grandfather. "I'm glad you are doing the right thing."
John had enough time to think, "How does he know about Killander?" when Soo-Lin said, "Please, there are people trapped with these creatures. One of the creatures is injured. It needs Doctor Watson's help."
"I don't think he knows," said Cho.
Jacqui pointed at a rather cheery mural of a droll black hound dog with a lolling red tongue and sparkling blue eyes on a green field with white sheep grazing in the distance. "Some of the inmates refer to him the Hound. If you end up going over to Baskerville, and you will if there's a disturbance, take the time to talk to old Finney. He's been here since the place was built and knows every story."
On that bit of news, they returned to the festivities and to whatever the future would bring.
John did not fill in the next line. He was too busy sucking on Sherlock's index finger, what John liked to think of as his fuck finger, the one he always used to stretch John with first.
John had a thought. "We should find sickbay. He could have injected us with a neural inhibitor, preventing us from accessing our memories." He had no idea if he really was a medic, but it couldn't hurt.
She went outside and it was a lovely day. A day that she wanted to be sharing with Sarabeth. She felt awkward. Wrong footed. Wanted a solution for… everything.
"Why he made a little Shakespeare reference in response to mine, very droll. So droll. This way," Frankland headed for the door. They made their way through a series of hallways and curving ramps. There were a number of patients in pale green, blue, and purple scrubs walking in the opposite direction. "Ah, I see you've noticed our color coding system. My own idea. To indicate our guests readiness to move on to the next phase in the sylvan resort – to use your compatriot's words – above. I developed it after I perfected grandfather's design of the neural neutralizer. He worked at this facility as well. Well, worked. I mean he designed the facility and ran it. Such a tragedy that his life was cut short. In the prime of his life. So much left to do. Well, we carry on his work in a small way. But we have big dreams. Such big dreams. As you're a doctor yourself, I'll name drop a bit. Doctor Adams. Perhaps you've heard of him."
Had needed John from the moment that Dionysus first transformed him. From the moment the Dionysian festival had begun.
Statistics. Think about statistics. Given only one crèche, Mummy's creche, among Augments created by the British Nation state had been designed with that gene variant, two omegas and one alpha, Augments originating on Earth would have a low statistical probability of presenting the gene. There was of course the issue of the Breen, but they were irrelevant to John, John, John. Even several steps away, the alluring scent lingered. Ravishing the senses.
Connor had grown so much since they'd arrive in the future. Made friends. Blossomed in ways Billy never would have even hoped once upon a time.
John lost words.
"I can't believe how good I feel," Sarabeth. She was wiggling her hand. "I broke my arm when I was a kid and it's ached when it rains ever since. Now I feel great."
"We didn't fall into a star," said John crossing his legs and leaning back. "A definite win."
Now was the time to say very firmly, "I want my son released into my care now." The doctors didn't move. He decided to call on relevant authorities. "He can receive the best of care in my grandfather's home."
"Really far in the past. We're not even sure when."
Relief flooded through her. This could work. "Bring Connor, there's someone it's long past time you should both meet." It had to.
Her mum said, "Oh, honey. You've come back to me."
"Um," said Mum. "I… maybe. Not really up on my Federation astro cartography."
She suffered through watching John coo over Sherlock through dinner. The sharp scent in the air, the way they kept touching hands, and bumping knees making it obvious they'd had sex just before she'd arrived for dinner.
The alpha went a funny sort of color. Bit greenish and grey. He held out his hands pleadingly. "Please, you have to intercede for me. My crèche can pay. The minerals from an asteroid or a pleasure palace on the home world."
Through the jungle fog of rut, he dimly thought that something was very wrong. Dim as the interior of a moon.
Sh'Alaack staggered from out of the light and sound booth, holding a phaser. Her expression was wild. She shouldn't even have been out of bed, much less at the play. "Kodos, you don't deserve the honor of Ushaan. Of being allowed to fight my challenge to your honor. You should be killed like a rock slug. With fire and heat." She lifted her phaser.
"Just too right," said John. The Breen removed their restraints, which was a good sign. Course, the Breen were wearing walking tanks. Could be useful if there was a clear spot to pull a runner. They were taken to a turbolift that looked like something out of a wild eighteen hundreds fantasy with ribbed gates and pulsing blue walls. It smelled faintly of vanilla and bread. Billy put himself between the Breen and Connor and as the doors to the lift opened, exploded into motion attacking the nearest Breen, sweeping its feet out from under it, and wrenching a neural disrupter off one of their gauntlets.
A note appeared on John's parchment. "Sorry, Professor Holmes is riding you so hard." Tadpole looked him from across the potions desk. He looked so young to John.
"And your Alignment believes heresy," said Veema, "You 5ths are as bad as the 22
They were sprawled on the mats when their sister, Euros, crept into the room.
He stared at Victor. At his hands still curled around Victor's head. "Why? Why did I do that?"
Her scent was… John blurted, "Mum didn't mention that you transitioned back to an omega." It didn't make any sense. He couldn't count the number of time that she'd argued with their parents that she was ready for the transition therapy and didn't want to wait until she was eighteen. He'd been on one of his breaks from school when he'd found out that she'd been taking black market hormone shots. Nothing that would take her the whole way through her transition, but enough to stop her the pseudo heat that started in adolescence as part of omega maturation into adulthood. That had been part of a whole other set of arguments. Given Dad had been concerned about the damage the shots might be doing to Harry's growth, while Mum wanted to talk about how hard John was taking pseudo-heat, and Harry had gone ballistic about another conversation that shifted to how John was doing.
He'd forgotten Washington had been transferred to the Cortez. Felt like he was forgetting most things.
Sherlock looked into the shifting colors at the center of the Guardian. "I still don't remember Victor or Chin as children."
"He would. But details." Sherlock could feel every cell in his body straining to absorb what Chin might say next.
John felt the box sharp and angular against his ribs. Every cube was full of the grandchildren of a mass murderer. John had that inside him too. Every Augment did, wasn't that what every Normal thought. That every Augment had the genes to become dictators and mass murders.
"Oh, thank God!" He rubbed the side of his head. "I can think again. The last week has been murder." He looked down, as if expecting Sherlock's come had magically transformed him into an adult. "I'm still young."
"Oh, no," said one of the younger kids. "Should we do something? Mummy will be so upset with Daddy."
Who was John to deny that? The sun grew closer to the horizon. Really time in ancient Pompeii didn't move like normal time. Plenty of time to stretch Sherlock's sphincter muscles with the smallest of the wooden dildos, while teasing his labia with the larger. Size was lovely and all, but knowing where Sherlock's prostate and graffenberg spots were was better. John had Sherlock coming before he'd made it to the largest dildo, and after that, he rolled Sherlock over to enthusiastically enjoy another round of making a two backed beast. All the better because John could see how happy Sherlock was.
"Because Humans will reproduce," agreed Elim companionably.
John quickly holstered his phaser and focused on his medical tricorder, and confirmed what his eyes were telling him. "Its cells are aging rapidly. Centuries in seconds." The figure's death rattle was more of a faint sigh.
Melas left them standing in the hall.
Billy pulled away. Pulled himself together. "I can't believe she would do something like that. Soo Lin hadn't had an easy time growing up. There were expectations from her parents that she didn't feel she'd ever measure up too. A childhood that sounded as isolated as mine. It took her months to hold hands, but… I can't believe that she would do something so horrible. She knew that my grandfather was in one of those cryo-chambers. I told her that. I told her what it was like in the twenty-first century and all that time she was hiding that she'd done… this. How?"
John ran for the medical tricorder in the emergency hatch. Scanned Sherlock.
Shor said, "It's probably for security. For the war."
Her only fuck was to do the opposite of what Grendel wanted her to do.
John held up his arms, wanting Sherlock's arms around him. "Yes, Daddy."
John made the special preparations for that particular scenario. He slid the cock sleeve over his cock. He lubed up both the vaginal and anal stimulators before inserting them. Although, the vaginal one hardly needed it. John had been constantly slick with secretions for the last week. He could smell his own arousal when he changed pants. He'd taken to rubbing them on Sherlock's pillow as soon as he left to investigate. Rubbing his body all over their bed. All over their room.
John poked his head out of the closet. There was a male Klingon declaring his love in iambic pentameter to a female Klingon. The female said, "I need rocks to throw at you."
"I doubt it," said Constable Odo. They frowned looking at Sherlock. "I dislike secrets."
Donovan crossed her arms. "He shows up or we go without him. I'm not sitting in shuttle traffic because Watson decided he needed an extra morning shag with the freak."
Sherlock was more than amenable to explain the differences in texture. Describe John to himself while looking at John. Into bright blue eyes. Until somehow, he was leaning over John. Both their swim wear long since gone.
He ran around to the main entrance. He didn't know where the system that Marymor had entered went, but he knew where he needed to go. He shouted, "Alphas!" as he ran through the entrance. Jovas, who had slept through both their departures woke with a start.
The daimon sighed. "Have a Klingon do it. It's what we're paying them for."
"Yes, yes," said Sherlock. Not-Sherlock. "But good attention to detail. Easier to deploy than to take back."
"Hey, I don't talk about all the times you and John bring up the privacy shield," said Julian.
More rounds of Killander repeated the same questions. Sherlock hated repeating himself.
John smiled and hoped she'd fill in more details, which only made her look at him in a baffled sort of way.
Trying. Trying. Trying to cling to a level of control.
"That's wonderful," said Billy, who didn't feel that scoring a point was worth not focusing on the main objective. "But… won't they still be kidnapped?"
But when she asked Shroleb, he'd laughed. "We're nowhere near running out of food. Algae is boring, but filling." Then he grinned. "Just wait until the salamander meat becomes available."
Everyone was questioned.
"No fucking shit, Holmes," said Donovan. "The only way that you would leave a search for Watson to someone else was if you were dead or not you. And I'm not really discounting the dead part."
Odo snorted and gave Bashir a look. "Of course. I've also identified the level where the cryo chamber were kept." He handed each of them tricorders. "As we suspected, Khan was being held at same facility he was held at originally, a hundred years ago."
Billy braced himself to take the blow as the Klingon raised his hand, but Connor darted between them. "Please. There is no honor in beating a captive. My mother is in love. That's all. He wanted to contact his lover to let her know that he hadn't abandoned her. Love makes us all foolish."
"Who are you talking to?" asked a child's voice.
Two identical people were sitting on chairs in the center of the room. They both drew in a breath as she entered and stood up.
"You know what I meant."
"If you kill him, I'll destroy the power for the facility," said Sherlock through the com. "You could kidnap a hundred Controllers and they couldn't help you."
The alpha turned to him. "John, I'm sorry about all this. When Billy told me you'd gone missing, I came as soon as I could."
He held up a hand to gently stop her. "I have read the packets on every guest at this facility." He looked around brightly. From what he'd seen so far, Tantalus was a bit dated – and terribly named – but well designed to affect a healing ambiance. He said, "I was very excited to be offered the opportunity to direct the treatment at a facility designed by Doctor Tristan Adams." Bob was always happy to introduce one of the greats in their field in a conversation with a peer.
"Really!" said Euros softly. Brightly. Hopefully.
There at least Sherlock's research had told him what to say. "All that is mine is yours." Then in case this was ambiguous to someone of John's level of obliviousness, he added, "Yes. I would like to have sex with you."
"While it is a widely held belief, but there's no medical evidence that an adult alpha can trigger a true heat in an adolescent omega," said Julian, as if she would ever believe his confirmation of anything.
An alien female stood there with three males. The males were wearing silver belts with a green circle on it.
Too late, because while they had been blowing up the artificial intelligence, forces from the Dominion-Cardassian alliance seized control of DS9.
The floor was covered with it.
"We're both wearing suits, and you love theater." Sherlock slipped his arm through John's and called for a transport.
He was home.
She looked down at a monitor and spotted her captain crossing a fallow field followed by a positively ancient old man. An old man that she had actually met and remembered given he'd been the one who'd sprung her out of Adam's chamber of horrors.
John took up door duty again. Focused on talking about Ferengi accounting dramas and legends of immense wealth. Nom wasn't very literate in theater, but Cafa loved Accounting Dramas and had seen every episode of "As the Ledger Balances".
Grandfather had acted like a hundred wasn't a lot of people, but it was. Especially when they were all watching him. At first he figured it was like back on the Bakerstreet. If someone new had joined in, but not really.
"Please don't tell me we're going to die," said Owen loudly. Glancing at John and Sherlock with a questioning look.
Left her wondering if she would be able to face Doctor Watson without flinching. Without seeing his twin raising Bihr's own phaser. Without seeing her parent's murderer giving his life to save her.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. The cave system was extensive. He'd intended to explore it more fully, but everything had kept him busy. There had been no time to explore the sections with sudden drops and sheer cliffs. He knew when he saw Marymor slide into a crevice between the rocks that she had kept looking.
Mum whispered urgently, "Stay with the other parents. I'll deal with this."
They waited with excitement for the attachment.
Maybe John shouldn't have punched him, but after everything it certainly felt good.
Until the Bakerstreet.
He dressed. Putting on clothes felt wrong. Too hot. But he needed clothes for the scenario, which would get him what he needed. White Shirt with Gryffindor tie. Tidy whitey pants. Jeans. Socks, also in Gryffindor colors. Trainers. Black robe over the whole thing with an extra rub from that morning's pants on the folds of fabric.
Sherlock mildly allowed himself to be shoved back into the mine.
The lights dimmed. The woman looked up. "Controller! Stop it. Do job. Keep lights on."
There was a box in his office. He could just open his mouth and say something.
Sherlock almost grinned. It was in his eyes, if his mouth was virgin prim. Even as he spread his legs wide. "Sir, you're so large. I'm afraid you'll hurt me."
The blue Breen titled its head.  "There is something that you should know."
His mother said, "You didn't wait to hear the result of the Breen bio scans. You didn't know that your husband's mitochondrial DNA and your Y chromosome DNA are a match for the earliest Breen."
As to Mollyhoo, she spent more time in the refrigeration chamber than she liked. Best spot to throw up given the lack of cleanup. She set off John, who set off Sarabeth.
"You'd think," said McCarthy between tightly clenched teeth, "that if they think we're a perversion, they wouldn't want us bleeding on the dirt."
"Liar!" Eva looked at Freddy. "Make her go away. I want Mommy!" She burst into tears and ran into Freddy's room. Presumably into the little fort they kept replicated for her there for when she stayed over.
Stonn continued with a slightly raised voice, "Within a few years, you would have left to attend a place of higher learning."
"My mum suggested I go see this version. She'd heard good things. So, I suggested to Commander Holmes, as a good friend, that he should come with me," said John quickly.
"John, no!" Sherlock jumped after him, even as some part of him said that he should stay behind to ensure there were a way back. Even as he thought that he'd follow John into hell's heart if he had to. Then he was through and the building was gone.
John forged on. "Even if your immune system doesn't attack them, your body may repair the microchimeric transfer of genetic material from the blastocysts to your body. If that happens, your body will not be able to provide them with nourishment."
"It's her brother's fault. His head was full of that kind of thing. But if I were to fix that then it would be all black butterflies and diamond rain and I don't want that."
Sherlock sprawled back in his seat. Feeling reckless with so much to lose. Attack. Attack. Attack. "You've caught me. I am Khan Brittanus. My diabolically evil plan was to join Starfleet, spend years at research facilities focusing on exobiology, write reports on how to defeat the Borg, have my work ignored, be consigned to teaching, go on my own recognizance to stop the Borg from assimilating Earth, and be given the command of a hastily built exploratory vessel. How horrible my plans to seek out new life and new civilizations have been foiled by an intelligence agency with poor record keeping."
Lucy glanced at him sharply. "What is there to be sorry about?"
"Two point three to one," said Sherlock absently.
Sherlock stared down at the blade embedded in the wood. Placed the palm of his left hand on the board and pulled up with his right. The board rattled on the counter top. He contemplated the onion. "It is perhaps late in our relationship to ask this question, but… is your aversion to reproduction itself, or is it to…" another slice, a rather dangerous swipe of Sherlock's hand across his cheek with the hand holding the knife, "reproduction with me? I realize I haven't exactly proven myself a good father figure," a quick slice through the half round. More of a quarter round by now, "in the past."
Hunter answered that statement with an arched eyebrow and a sharp, "Oh, for fuck's sake! Do you need me to slap you? Would that help?"
An idea that went over like a lead balloon tied to a neutron star and dropped off in the proximity of a black hole with the Khans, Mummy most definitely included.
"Stockholm syndrome," mused John. He looked at Sherlock. "Holmes syndrome. Not sure how we report this. If we report that the Khans are running around, at this point, all I'm certain we'll get is more dicks like Killander coming out of the woodwork, or," he waved in the general direction of the bridge, "fucking tits like this Wilkes character. Fact is, Normal Human's can be as fucked up as they want, but one Khan is proof we're all out to murder everyone."
http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Immunity_Syndrome_(episode)
The rumbly feeling in Connor's belly didn't go away. If anything, as he burrowed against his mummy, it got worse.
It didn't matter. The most important thing was finding John.
Cold cruel Artemis, her face caught in the eternal dew of youth, repeated, "Brother, it's time."
"Did you know?"
He didn't page through history now. That would just be avoidance.
Several Breen shouted, "22
It was hard after the miscarriage. Especially as the life growing inside Mollyhoo made itself more and more evident. She was also fairly certain that all the other omegas were breeding again. Whatever it was Sherlock had done, it had been permanent, which was more than a bit horrifying. Birth control wasn't something she was sure she could reinvent, but they'd need it unless they wanted biology to take over. Birth control by miscarriage wasn't… it wasn't a plan.
Since they could not very well meet on each other's ships, Sherlock and Chin met at the party on Benecia. Withdrew from the bonfires on the shore up to a further place on the beach.
A delicious scent filled the room. Apples baked in a pie by her mum. Cinnamon and cloves. Heavy spices. A female voice said, "Just the way I designed it."
Sally did not ask, "What the ever living fuck are you on?" He didn't have the mildly strung out look of a man who'd taken to drugs to deal with a boring arse post overseeing criminals. She said, "Care to give me the tour?" At a minimum, if she'd get more intel, which she could put in a report and someone outside of her grade could deal with it. Eventually, given Starfleet bureaucracy.
After all, no Ferengi with any sort of lobes would set foot on a world where there were unprocessed vendarite deposits.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is when researchers look at aggregated data (not 1 person, lots of people) and drill down on the correlation between # with a certain set of SNPs who confirm they do or don't have a trait (phenotype).
The Breen did not respond. They simply scanned Billy.
If he drifted back into sleep, he'd fling himself out of bed and head down to the Observation deck. Stood on the transparent surface over the dark of space littered with stars. Knew that he was small and fragile in all that expanse. That Mummy and his parent's plans were small too. In face of everything, he'd find himself writing concertos for the violin. For the wave. The geyser. Love.
They looked back inside his quarters. Lucy could hear her child crying. She ached with wanting to comfort her and couldn't. Her arms were full of seedlings. She was the cause of those tears.
Connor squeezed Billy's hand. "Mummy, she's not honest with us." His expression earnest and determined.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Seed_(novel)
Sherlock pulled something out of a pocket, because of course Sherlock had pockets in his robe. "While I have a present for her." He handed John some small purple crystals.
Gremel raised the disrupter higher. "Won't matter. Killander will take care of your hubby."
John did what he always did when faced with this sort of problem. Lifted his chin. Squared his shoulders. Declared a mental fuck this noise. "We need weapons. Better defenses than rocks. We're from technologically advanced societies," he said very firmly. He was. He still was.
Sh'Alaack on the other hand was at least competent enough to see the implications. "But not if we explode a minute amount in the tunnel shaft that the Captain has been digging. We know that we're close to the surface and its well away from the main seam of vendarite and the entrance.
"What are you doing here?" asked Sherlock, who had been held waiting in a subterranean conference room for thirty minutes.
"You are going to love it here," said Johnho. "Other than the twins, we're about the only ones that…"
It was why when Chief Gremel had asked the miners and refinery folk to step up and volunteer to take a shift guarding the refinery, Jo had stepped up. He and Gremel didn't see eye to eye on the Breen deal, but he was still the plant chief.
Brittanus pulled away from Meiying to glance at Euros. "A curious turn of phrase." Their eyes – looking like brilliant green ice in the light streaming around the tapestry – lanced through John. He tried telling himself the truth of who he was so utterly absurd that Sherlock's Mum couldn't possibly pluck it out of the air. After being married umpteen years, John was meeting Sherlock's parents like a stand-in shoved on stage with no script. Brittanus said, "Noonian, who is this and why have you brought him here? Mei and I have already progressed far in our negotiations for our next move."
She'd replicate anything she needed. He should say something about that.
Tripping his shame that lived under his temper. After all, he'd given his parents a lot of trouble back when he'd actually been the age he appeared to be. Lived up to the preconceptions society had about omegas, but without the biological excuse of heat.
The Hippocrates wasn't much to look at. It had been a Y-500 freighter in a previous life. It had minimal attack capabilities – mostly good for pot shots at pirates. All its power went into its massive engines. Shields. Some set aside for holo-generators for one hour bursts for up to twenty holographic doctors with no long term memory capacity, and rows of biobeds lined up in three of the former cargo holds. Although, to John's mind, the one hold converted into a morgue said how Starfleet really expected the upcoming battles to go.
He just knew it.
Which was why John was in the stairwell when Stonn came pelting past him. He followed him just in case, but Stonn stopped as he arrived at the daycare.
"This is so bad," said Marida after an all to brief visit ended in growls.
A voice boomed over the coms. "Welcome, my Terran children. You've left behind wine dark seas to sail the stars as I was certain you would. Where I have waited for you."
Mining the wormhole had been guaranteed to trigger a response from the Dominion-Cardassian alliance. But really, allowing continual resupply by a massive and hostile presence on their border hadn't been a great option either. Anyone deployed in the Gamma Quadrant had seen firsthand how aggressive the Dominion could be.
So, of course, he looked for a solution.
"This must be the home world. There may still be evidence here. Records. Something to tell me what happened."
Sherlock endured John's playing in the Bad Band.
He looked up at Sherlock. At his father, who had sat down heavily on a block. His mum had gone into mum mode, checking to see if everyone was alright. If anyone needed a glass of water or a soother.
"Say, yes." Sherlock was aware looming over the person he was asking to marry him was non-traditional, but he found himself unable to do anything else. "We already know we're extremely sexually compatible." He dared to place his hand over where John's scar had been before Sherlock had come so very many times on it and smoothed scars away.
Garak wrapped the tape around Sherlock's waist and hummed. "He's come by the station before. When you were a more frequent visitor. An interesting gentleman." Garak measured Sherlock's chest. He really was a tailor given the tiny needle marks on the pads of his fingers, the small tufts of thread clinging to his trouser legs, and the speed with which he was measuring Sherlock's body, but he also hadn't turned his back once to the open door.
Into that quiet, he asked, "What did Chin mean?" It felt like his millionth question of the day. He missed the Bakerstreet, where there weren't questions all the time.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was the first time Karidian had addressed him directly.
Cafa, one of the guards, who John got the impression was some sort of cousin to Daimon Lurin, said, "There is no profit in this Lady of the Flowers story. Why tell it?"
"No," John raised his chin. "I wouldn't be betraying him. I'd be doing everything I can to get back to him. Anyway," he met Victor's gaze, "the first time I met my Sherlock, he deduced I'd had sex with a Caitian the night before. I'm an amazing fuck." He tried to remember the cocky young John who'd gone on the pull every night. To pull that person on like a sweater. Bit bulky and shapeless at this point after years of disuse.
John groaned. "I hated being a teenager." He'd gone from being a happy outgoing kid to a teen dragging his family down a rabbit hole of family drama, screaming matches, and eventually landing him at a parochial school to give him some stability.
All of which made sense because onions.
She looked around the office. Her antennae moving slowly. Scenting the room. "I would very much like to be the person that I was when I couldn't remember who I was. Who couldn't understand why I didn't just tell my loved ones that I love them." She adjusted the picture slightly. "I cannot be that person. Unaffected by memories."
In either case, they were late for their shifts and they still met in their quarters or sickbay or the bridge or wherever it was they met that day.
Which was strange. Every other memory was Harry being absolutely certain that this was the right thing to do. Harry had never been hesitant in her life.
Mycroft said, "Who are you?"
Smith raised a glass. "Here, here."
"No," John looked at the array of arms and pseudopods attached to the facility walls and ceiling.
"Just don’t get in my way," said Killander, "And you," he pointed at Sherlock, "Don't leave the ship."
She was too busy fabricating the right identity for what she called reconnaissance. A year or so among the enemy learning their weaknesses. Father Noonian laughed and told her it was well past time that she ran away from home. Mummy was enigmatic as usual. Father Meiying reminded her of her duty.
Paying all the attention.
"It's still possible I could be reassigned to the Bakerstreet," said Sherlock. Certainly given the trajectory of his career, if his commission was reupped, assignment to a ship with a ten year lifespan would make sense. However, other eventualities were also possible. "If I am transferred to a different command, I'll make a place for you onboard. As a ship or base commander, I'd have," he glanced at Hudson, "a certain level of discretion about bringing on personnel for needed roles."
(See the end of the chapter for
They both disappeared in a sparkle of light.
It was the most animation Sherlock had seen from John since his father's death.
Sherlock flushed. "Yes. Let's do it now. Immediately."
John had said, "Holy, fuck!" when he outlined the scenario.
John wondered what it said about them that he didn't have a problem with the idea. He waved his fork at Sherlock. "I'm not turning into a teen again."
"Hells, yeah," said her twin. Their younger siblings murmured their agreement.
"Endorphins. Dopamine, really good estrus sex," said Mollyhoo. She stretched. "I feel better too. Better than I have since I got here. Not," she brushed her hand along the side of Sarabeth's head, "that it's not good with you. It's always amazing with you. The way you…"
Sherlock stored it all in his memory palace for when John was ready to hear it.
Trelane breathed in and out several times in short order. "She doesn't think I can be a perfect knight because I'm omnipotent, but I can! There's this other entity that's been filling her head with ideas about power and what it means and it has no poetry in its soul."
When they'd been invited down to the planet Maiwand by the local government, there hadn't really been any mention of the isolationists who felt all aliens were a perversion on the sacred soil of their world.
Sherlock woke laughing. Lay sprawled on his alpha, dried cum on his thighs, and said, "These aliens have been without human adoration for thousands of years. They must have some other source of energy. We just need to find it." Peppered his alpha with kisses as he spoke.
"The ethics around studying medical studies involving children is always tricky." Julian's expression was calm. "Given Augment history, most Augmented parents won't participate in studies even now."
Which was when he knew what he had to do. Sherlock said, "I'm under orders to stay, you are under no such orders. Internal Affairs has no official authority over you. Killander had no authority."
"Nothing," said Ishros.
He sneered. "If it was going to be applied, then the time was more than a hundred years ago when it was actually interfering with mining operations." He smiled superiorly. "But, of course, you don't have access to classified records and don't know that information of the creature's intelligence was suppressed."
Bloody Hands was a pirate queen, but she couldn't live without her heart.
John mouthed the words along with Beatrice as he always did, "O that I were a man for his sake! or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving."
It was horrible. Maudlin.
Like listening to each Department Head argue with her over crew rotations for hours as if her current physical appearance had anything to do with her capabilities to assign crew to certain duties.
Sherlock had certainly been more than ready, although winter was far from over and not all the omegas were breeding. Most, but not all. But that was up to John. Sherlock was more than happy to feel sunshine on his face. Look up at the sharp peaks around the valley and feel the cool air of their territory.
She sounded angry. No furious.
As soon as he came through the door, Benjamin shook his hand of all things. "I don't know the details, but I want to thank you for what you did stopping the Borg."
https://youtu.be/FD7sqGJ3NBg
"Yeah, we looked a lot alike when we were younger," said John.
Blue hair rolled his eyes. "That's all we need. More of us to ignore."
A good portion of the crew beamed down to Bencia. No wanted to have a party in the cargo bay. Khatri did most of the organizing.
Then there was the other problem.
He slashed across the femoral artery in his right leg. Slicing across and through the nicely engorged arteries in that tube of meat that was no longer connected to Victor and over his left femoral. A small effective motion at that angle.
But Sherlock was the one who wanted to play with her and make a snowman. So he was her Anna. She had to save him from Victor.
"I don't know." Sherlock did not like knowing. He particularly did not like not knowing under these circumstances. There were no fertility figures in the smaller chamber. But there four photographs on the wall. Each of his parents surrounded by their followers and one with them together.
"Other than Coronel Green's torture experiments," said Lucy bitterly.
They put on the story of the prodigal child. Harry, who was playing the good child, looked right at John as she complained to their father about killing the fatted calf when the wastrel child returned. Shelly was penitent as the prodigal. Changed by her experiences in the world and happy to return to her parents arms.
Whatever setting she used, it was enormously painful. He was able to say, "Thank you," before opening his eyes in his own body.
His back arched as his omega squeezed around him, as his omega laughed. Pushed down just before Sherlock's knot expanded. Sherlock was caught exactly where he wanted to be. Releasing inside his mate.
All the easier to shake his head at the expression on Stamford's face.
They stopped singing when they saw them, and as one, knelt on one knee.
John smiled at him from the other side of the screen. For whatever reason Second Father was standing next to him.
"What!" said John.
Some lines from Sherlock's wedding speech in "The Sign of Three"
Hudson's expression if anything got more pleasant. "Oh, dear. I suppose I have lost my touch." Her hand fluttered close to her face. "Perhaps, if I could observe you and your people as they search the ship. To refresh my memory." Her hand came to rest on her upper chest near her throat.
Eva looked around and asked, "Where's your mom?" when they heard it. A faint rumbling from within the wall.
"Are you here to call me a monster?" She turned her hands in the field, palm up. "What, will these hands ne'er be clear? No more than my Lord Father's. I marred all with this starting. Bloody hands."
Ghostlike, John wandered the Bakerstreet.
Billy took the knitting needle from Connor's hand. "You're right." If they were going to be safe, they'd have to fight for it.
"You always say that," whispered John. Who pulled himself up to examine the bio computer and his own results. Now that John knew what worked based on his own blood workup, John was easily able to manufacture a cure. Cho didn’t lose consciousness with her dose of the cure. Miri, pleading for forgiveness from John, had it even easier.
Two viable placenta. The third had already been reabsorbed by Sherlock's body. Sherlock said, "I should have noticed it wasn't getting the right nutrients." He said, "I should have been more careful." He said… John stopped what he was going to say next. Kissed him and held him. Called in sick that day. They lay together in silence. The long dark of space passing outside.
"We discovered the answer eventually," said Pavan.
"No, I…" she looked around her. "I met someone you know. Ishros."
Mollyhoo stumbled into the chamber. Her scent was soft and satisfied. She looked at them. "Henryba Skerville. Henryba is that you?" She came a little closer. "Oh, yeah. Right. You probably don't remember me. But I remember you. You lived down the street before we were moved to the ghetto. I remember."
His father glanced up briefly from the book he was reading, but as was generally the case, said nothing.
"Although," said Hudson, "It was certainly worth a visit," tapping her forehead, smiling. "It is wonderful to come back home." She took a ginger step forward. "And I don't have to heal a nasty break that this body never had. Only the ones I've earned with this one."
They searched the room looking for anything that the Ferengi had missed, but unless they were planning on using the sink, they were out of luck.
She sat there silently for long moments. When her heart rate had slowed somewhat, he said, "If he were alive, would you know him if you saw him?"
To require representatives, implied divisions. Brittanus could use that.
John knew what he meant. His dad had had an accident. Years ago. Not long after he met Mom. Got banged up pretty badly. He'd had to have surgery, which was why it was ridiculous for Sholto to have claimed to have recognized his father. He couldn't have looked the same.
He should say something.
John whispered back. "Our babies." He tugged Sherlock's hand to rest on his belly. "Ours."
Alignment stuff."
"It doesn't matter," he said. "They can't cut off our air supply anymore." He picked up his pickaxe, well-worn to his hand after several weeks and climbed up the stone wall to the surface. He didn't wait for the others. There was no time. He had spent four weeks in a mine. John was growing ever more vulnerable up on the ship. It was all he could do to remember to use the axe. His first victim was the force field generator. His second were the houseless Klingon guards. At least they were no longer bored.
Stonn, Sh'Alaack and her bondmates wanted to know how the children looked. If they were fine. If they looked okay. "Hudson, Lucy, and John are looking after them." They appeared to need more. "They appear to be in good health." He briefly had a vision of some even smaller version of John in the schoolroom at the mercy of the Ferengi, and understood their fear. "They are in better health than we are."
True to her word, Sarabeth worked on a stunningly beautiful painting in the next cave, which was for the best. John couldn't draw more than simple shapes.
"Strangely, I feel unwilling to give up my life to enable you to live in ever dwindling number in a cave system," said Sherlock.
Harry said, "You either want your Lochinvar, or you're already doing it. I bet you've done it on this couch." Her lips curled.
There was no safe places. No one to rescue them.
John looked at the stones more closely. "I can't speak to its conductivity, but in its unrefined form its highly toxic to the fluid in Ferengi ear drums." He looked at the crystals and at the wincing guards. "This looks pretty unrefined."
But as long as John was careful, it was fine. He’d healed the members of his pride. What they did after that was up to them.
Which to remind everyone is how Sherlock's brain works. Because Euros. Because brain damage. So both he and John are basically now teens. Well, John just got all the hormones dumped on him at once, which is why his emotions are so out of wack.  Um... science...
The alpha whined and knelt her head submissively.
"Sorry sir," squeaked John. "I don't know what's come over me." Even John could scent his own pheromones blooming out of him at the sensations.
He certainly didn't need an ensign whose com badge didn't have a single scratch on it tried to insist that John give him his phaser when their little errand of mercy got an away team stranded on Organia where a rogue Klingon clan was intent on making it their base of operations. Especially an ensign who couldn't hit the broadside of a shuttle.
Over a loudspeaker, a voice said, "Please, welcome Professor Holmes, whose utterly brilliant research into Vacuuvita life forms has revolutionized our understanding of the possible."
"But he decided to send our ancestors back," started Terellhoo, before they were drowned out by the shouting crowd.
The monitor kept scrolling down to images of twenty-two smaller figures, less absurdly pregnant, and one slender figure with their face turned away. Two alphas with their cocks erect and fully knotted knelt in front of the Omegas. Another lay on their back, even if their cock was at full-mast.
Jake fussed over Eva. Lucy and Eva were cousins on his mother's side. Eva claimed to remember Jake, and told him a story with Flopsy. It took up much of the conversation until Lucy took Eva off to bed, and Jake went to sleep.
The big bad Section 31 agents tried to escape three times.
Captain Killander leaned back in Sherlock's chair. "I have reason to believe that despite that annual training, you brought an unauthorized person or persons back from the past and have been sheltering them on this ship in exchange for access to the healing capabilities that the early Augments had locked into their very blood.
The smell of Acheron's burning flesh was still rank in her antennae. She came closer to the two Watsons. Attempting to discern any difference between them that would identify, which one was the correct one.
They ignored each other in the quiet gym. Until Hunter ran in, drenched in sweat and wearing jogging clothes, with Julian, who for some reason had altered his program to look as if he too had working sweat ducts.
She cried dry tears. Sat on the dry aromatic earth and listened to Owen colorfully tell her it would be fine. The shocked faces of the omegas and Normal women around them belied those words, but still she listened. They'd served together a long time. She was not a child, but she knew the smell of pine would be forever ruined.
Mr. Melas said, "Doctor Watson, what a lovely Toga Trabea. Is that part of the usual uniform?"
"Back of the napkin," said Hahn.
It was catching, Lucy was feeling pretty subdued too. She hadn't seen her daughter in weeks while she'd been on Marilac, and now that she was back, she still wasn't able to be her mother.
"You are a genius, and I love you too."
"What you're currently doing," gasped Sherlock, bringing his hands up to John's hips, "isn't really conducive to eating dinner."
It was the sort of question that echoed around the plaza and into the sharp squeeze of John's heart. "Is there another one we should take?" asked John, feeling more than a little shattered.
Second Father turned on Mother. "This was your plan all along wasn't it? My part in the alliance dead at the hands of that chimera you created. You should have left your monster in the labyrinth."
Billy pulled Connor back. "Don't bother Aunti Khatri now. You know how knitting calms her nerves." The communicator was the better bet. Send a message to Chin and keep Connor from doing something foolish until she arrived. That's all he had to do.
, a Lieutenant, who was looking intently at a pad –
John shook his head. John told himself, "Tell him about the box." He repeated it until he about thought he'd said something.
He pushed the Ice Queen behind him and waited for Yellowbeard to make his move.
Bihr kept her gaze down and whispered, "I believe the ion storm caused a surge in the transporter circuits, which created a brief interdimensional contact with a parallel reality at the exact same time our duplicates were transporting in the same location." She did not say that Fisher had altered the device on the transporter designed to prevent just such an event. It was not the time for that and if they returned, she must deal with Fisher on her own.
"How you met John's father," said Sherlock.
John had a point and he was sticking to it. "I fucked Tadpole when I was this age. He put his knot in me and came inside me."
However, during her forty years of field work, if she'd run an operation at a location being worked by a fellow operative, she had checked in with them not only as a courtesy, but to make sure that their missions were not at cross purposes. She'd learned that the hard way.
"Stun, please," said Amazing Sparkles. "There could be another explanation, and death is hard to take back, I think."
"Personally, I think that's because of the corpses Sherlock and John left outside of the valley after the last attack," said Mollyhoo.
He had thought he'd made it. That Connor would grow up safe. Protected by people who wouldn't take advantage of him.
Brittanus repressed once again thoughts of Mycroft. Left behind in the last days. The odds of any of the ships finding fertile soil had been too high to bring him.
Sherlock looked at him blankly. "I was not in proximity with omegas during the years when pseudo heat might occur." A smile broke like lightening on those kissable lips of his. Crashing on the shores of those cheekbones. "Which was then followed by my running away from home, forging my identity, and joining Starfleet at age fifteen." He said in that sly way he had when he wanted John to be impressed. "I went through the academy in half the normal time. Tested out of most classes."
John walked briskly towards him. He wasn't running. Brisk walking. Suppressing the fear that every time they parted would be the last time it would be as themselves.
Sherlock laughed. "Parallel Earth's, John!" and ran out of the room.
Sherlock glared. "You told me you were caught and that your parents had to send you to a school to control your behavior."
"Yes," said John, not wanting to press even harder on the wound. Letting Sherlock lance it himself.
Sherlock's smile shone like electric stage lights. "Interesting. Have there been any changes in the mining operations."
"Ah, love," said Elise. She bent and pressed a kiss to Karidian's head. Took his hand and squeezed it, pulling him to his feet. "It's not about what we deserve." She flashed Sherlock a smile. "Thank you for showing us this space, but we need to get ready for when we arrive at the meeting site. Not," she wagged the index finger of her free hand, "that you're getting out of answering questions about the Analyst and the Lady of the Flowers, but perhaps after we've done what we're here to do."
His blurry vision was clearing out of his left eye, which was a relief.
His mother laughed. "We were hardly a perfect fit." She sighed. "I think sometimes that we did you and Harry a disservice by not arguing in front of you. Not letting you see where the jagged edges were. The work it took to work through them because it was worth the effort. But, we wanted to present a united front, and Harry was… always so sensitive." She smiled at him softly. "Have you spoken to Harry since she was sent to Tantalus asylum?"
"Uh," said John, lowering his voice and looking around. "Is it something to do with," he leaned forward and whispered, "Section 31?" He really hoped it did. That would take some of the pressure off wondering what was coming next.
He should have done something.
John was still not prepared by the time they arrived at Planet Queue. He was completely thrown when the shuttle docked at the Starfleet base planet side, and they were greeted by not only his parents, but by Captain Sholto. Formerly Professor Sholto. Formerly dated for several disastrous weeks in his second year, Sholto.
The humanoid snatched it from his hand. "How much more?"
"It was less of a memory and more of I just… knew how to do it." Amazing Sparkles shrugged.
Supersmart examined Moriarty's face looking for a further clues, when something entirely unexpected happened. Mama G clocked Moriarty in the back of the head hard with the flute club. Hard enough to make a loud thud. Moriarty's head briefly glowed orange and shivered. His entire body melted and shifted until instead of facing the instruments, he was now facing Mama G. "You really shouldn't have done that."
"It is strange that you should bring that up for it has been in my thoughts much of late." She took a deep breath. "I have been unable to speak the words to my family, who bear the weight of my moods. But if my children are to know their grandparents, if my partners are to know why sometimes darkness takes me, then I must practice the speaking of them."
(See the end of the chapter for
He stopped when he saw John and his brother.
Feeling his own body's new reactions, he was sure.
But nine alphas had gotten in.
John said, "I'm very glad to see you."
Mummy went back to his chair. "I need to contact John. I meant to send a longer message thanking him for all he's done for Connor. I need to let him know how sorry I am. I mean, perhaps children aren't part of what he wants for himself and Captain Holmes, but to be forced to leave their children behind." He shook his head. "That's awful."
Killander sneered and gestured to one of his security goons. "We'll question the child first."
Precisely the same thing she'd said on their previous visit. Down to the phrasing. "May we never find space so vast, planets so cold, hearts and minds so plagued by the hounds of pain that theater cannot fill them with love and warmth."
Alexis lay back on the couch utterly destroyed. Limbs loose with pleasure. They'd just met Apollo. Just been swept away to a flower lined bower. Had their uniform discarded on the rocks outside the bower. They should not be floating down from a release with a being they'd just met.
Sherlock moved quickly, the alpha seemed so slow by comparison. He twisted the arm with the stone knife. Marymor kicked at him. Snapping her teeth at his neck. He slammed her back against the cave wall once, twice.
It would be fine.
"Of course, now that Connor is better, we want to be able to apply the treatment to other children in the Breen Confederation." Billy smiled. His smile was sincere. Hudson had always told him the way to sell a smile was to think about the ways what he was saying was true and it was true that John would be able to help Augmented teens all over the Federation with this treatment.
The omega's scent subtly shifted. Their arousal apparent even in their loose fitting trousers.
About as useful as John felt.
It also put things in a certain perspective when the colony on Gama Hydra IV was infected by a disease that caused rapid aging, John raced against the clock to cure the colonists. All the while in the back of his mind, he was thinking, maybe Sherlock's blood, his sperm, his whatever, could cure a colony.
John did not fail to notice that he was smiling all the time. That maybe he referred to his husband all the time. That everyone was giving them indulgent, if occasionally in the case of meetings in the ready room, wary, smiles.
John made himself wink at him. This simulation of hopeful youth. Actually, thinking about Tadpole was a little sad given how things had worked out. But even as Tadpole blushed, from across the classroom, Sherlock waved his wand and muttered a spell.
There was a flash of light and Sherlock felt himself dissolve into nothing.
Sex with Sherlock had gone from something that could get John cashiered out of Starfleet for breaking regulations to something that could turn Sherlock into something for experimentation. Endlessly harvested for what he could give. Because Section 31 was real. Because the Obsidian Order and the Tal Shiar and any number of other organizations were real.
Harry, who on one of John's breaks from school had tearfully begged their parents to be allowed to transition to an alpha. That she felt like an alien in her own body. That she'd never wanted a gold gender ring. She wanted a silver ring. Before John could say anything, the conversation became yet another argument about whether or not John should stay at that medieval Catholic school. The only period in his life, he'd ever seen his parents argue.
Sherlock lowered his gaze. "Shall I put this on? Or would you like to put it on me?"
"Sir, I was at the battle of Wolf 359," said the lieutenant, sitting very stiffly in her chair.
A feradon did not leap out at her. She did not lose her way. She didn't stumble when Euros – she would never call that bitch her sister – made her see what wasn't there. Her brother, who could do anything, did not leave her behind. There was no need for a stranger from another alignment, or so she'd been told, to carry her back to her parents.
Sometimes, she felt as if she'd been promoted to a position of authority that she doubted she would have gained on any other ship. Stonn was older and more qualified. Certainly, he saw fit to make changes to systems without obtaining her authorization. How could she complain to Captain Holmes? He knew everything. Was constantly making his own changes. Admittedly, documented and under some form of change management after Watson had spoken with him on Bihr's behalf.
He waved at the Orion woman. "Lethe here used to be an inmate and now she serves on my staff." Frankland lowered his voice. "I changed her name if you're wondering. A little conceit of mine now that she's forgotten all of her nasty old ways."
It just about broke Mollyhoo's heart to see them ambling up past them, leaning against each other, nuzzling as they went further into the cave system. She leaned into Sarabeth. Not wanting to put her fears on Sarabeth. Not after what Sarabeth had just gone through.
She didn't really mean to do what she did next. She didn't mean to pick a memory that was still bruised in Sherlock's memory and squeeze it even tighter. She didn't mean to say, "Your pet sehlat saved us. It saved us from the nasty beast. But now it's really injured. It needs to be put out of its pain."
Sisko was saying something. Bashir responded.
All John could do was follow Noonian out of the cave and into the ice canyons.
There was a movement from across the room. Donovan sat in a chair in the dark. She said, "Good you're awake."
Bihr resumed explaining the systems that she'd been documenting. That night she dreamed of warp cores.
While the holographic teacher finished the older children's lesson on history of the Federation, she sat next to the younger children who were getting a writing lesson from Ishros.
Sh'Alaack and Stonn simultaneously remembered meetings they were late for and left the room.
Protector grudgingly nodded. "I'll want to question them anyway."
Sherlock positioned the butcher's knife over the curved half of a yellow onion. Slowly pushed down and there was the heavy thunk of the blade hitting a freshly replicated cutting board. John would bet the steel blade of the replicated blade was razor sharp too.
"Yours is the least failure, Lieutenant. Go rest," said Sherlock, who knew that he should have stopped what had happened and saved John from this pain.
An extra warning: references miscarriage and abortion.
"Err… why?" asked John. London was a city. On Earth. Starfleet had facilities all over Earth.
He'd do that and ask Sherlock, "Could you talk to me until I fall asleep?"
John held on to the sound of Sherlock's voice. The feeling of his arms. His scent. Held onto the sound as another wave crashed around him. As Sherlock lowered him into warm water. After crushing weight, he floated.
alignment still say we should have used the device to prevent Sarpeidon from sending them back in the first place. Take us to the pure history when there was only the first mother and father."
Soon, Sally found herself in a control room with full access to all the cities cameras, sensor arrays in multiple sectors, and no response when she tapped her com. Which made sense. Andorian architecture burrowed into the ground not up, which was hell on com signals.
Sherlock dropped his voice. Deeper and deeper, as he described the detritus of the spores he'd collected from his uniform after being transported by Gomtuu. Their properties. The precise sensation of transportation.
Donovan shoved a piece of fabric in his mouth. "Always wanted to do that."
John wasn't sure that had to do with collective amnesia, but he said, "We've been to parallel Rome, so I think you're right, but we should do more research." John popped an ampule of lube from the nightstand next to the bed. Curled behind Sherlock and slid his cock between slick thighs. All the while sliding his hand up and down his dearest friend's cock. It was different than penetrative intercourse. Looser. Slower. They shifted several times, trading places. Until finally John came on Sherlock's chest.
He'd heard a bit about Doctor Frankland. Made a name for himself in the medical profession in the last year and a half with some pretty amazing claims about being able to rewire violent impulses. John had done his research. He might not visit Harry, but he did care. The tech was based on some older research from a hundred years back, but the theory was solid. Gently redirecting neural impulses down new pathways with positive association. Sense memory kind of stuff.
When their heartbeats slowed, Sherlock pulled so carefully, so gently away. Laid John on the bunk like something precious. John watched him go to the replicator. Dispose of the lube, and the towel, and return with a hot flannel. It cooled itself on John's skin, before Sherlock put John back into his clothes. Put him back together again.
He replicated colored pencils and pens for her so she could color her letter.
A fourth finger.
He wanted to promise William that he'd never let anything like that happen again, but couldn't.
"Sir, I… I don't… I've never," Sherlock curled his neck as if he hadn't kept asking for this. John's genius. John's precious boy for the afternoon.
Now all there were was high walled faces staring at her.
"I can land us away from the main clusters of radiation. It should be fine for our purposes of crashing."
The black iron cauldron that appeared was almost a surprise. John forced out the words, "Sorry, Professor Holmes."
The Eugenics Wars in Star Trek were in the 90s. After that, WWIII. So, in this universe the Harry Potter series would have been written in that context. An odd thought when I was first planning this series of stories for where/when to get these two characters into some Harry Potter roleplay.
He kept staring until Melusine said, "Ah, I understand," Ms. Melusine's smile was kind. Caring. Just a little hungry. "It's still too traumatic for you after all this time. Perhaps later, when you've gotten to know us better. Off to your desk now."
Some long past admitable things. To take Sherlock by the hand, ask Julian to shove off, turn on the privacy shield and open his bottom desk drawer, show Sherlock what he had been holding onto for over a decade in some cases.
Sestre was kneeling next to the creature that Lucy and Stonn had shot earlier. Stonn raised his phaser. "Sestre! Come over here!"
Idiot.
Killander's team was thorough. Martha had to give them that.
Federation needed him. Sherlock needed him. He needed Sherlock.
Not stealing hours when John fell asleep after intercourse.
Sestre did examine the tunnel left behind by the creature before entering it with the tricorder, which his father had neglected to get back from him in the excitement.
While Sherlock simply repeated John's name as he gave into the scent and sound and feeling of the moment.
John tossed Sherlock his boots and joined him in Transporter Room Forest with Cho, and Donovan.
Even coolly stunning three Klingons earned him a, "Lucky shot, Doc."
Sherlock very nearly said, "Don't go!" He very nearly said, "Don't leave me!" The words burst out of him. "You should take it."
"Yeah, it worked."
It was going to be fine.
"You're not going without me," said John. Firmly. Stoically. With that little lift to his chin that made Sherlock's heart stop a beat.
John had time to think, "I have to have him. Forever. Always," before he was being fiercely kissed by a very aroused teenager in a silk robe thing that draped over one shoulder and left nothing to the imagination. Pale skin and green silk and hands. Hands everywhere. His own hands. Sherlock's. Lips. Sweet seductive scent. Intoxicating. Eyes blinded by fluttering closed and opening in brilliant sunshine.
"Brother dear, the Federation and by extension Starfleet is not the government with which I have any measure of authority. Although, I do have my instructions from Mummy."
He opened his mouth to say what he had to say, and everything went black.
Eva straightened her shoulders. "You can all share my mama. Kay."
Sherlock slid his fingers along John's arm.
