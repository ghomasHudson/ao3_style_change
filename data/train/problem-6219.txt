Tony walked over and sat down next to Steve on the bed, close enough that the lines of their bodies were touching.  He let out a low sigh, then leaned over and pressed a kiss against the slope of Steve’s shoulder.
He finished the rest of his workout uninterrupted, then went back up to the suite, showered and changed before making his way out to the  kitchen in search of food.  Instead, he found Tony with a phone headset of some kind sitting at the dining table sipping a dark green smoothie that looked like the picture in the dictionary next to the word ‘revolting.’
“You’re right,” Steve agreed, nodding at Howard.  “Enrolling in those college classes was completely ridiculous.  He had absolutely no business there.”
Steve righted himself at the sound, blinking a bit as if dazed, then gifted Tony with a quick, furtive look before he sat back and pulled his shirt over his head. “Oh, thank God, I thought we were going to talk more,” Tony said with abject relief, then stopped and stared for a moment, a wide grin breaking out over his face. “You’re wearing it!” Tony crowed with delight.
“Thank me properly after the tourney,” Tony replied with a painted-on leer that didn’t quite chase the pall out of his eyes.  “It’s nothing,” he said again with a slight wave and shake of his head.
“I’m not leaving, Tony,” Steve promised.  “I swear it. And I’m always honest.”  Tony came with a harsh sob, hunching over Steve as he shuddered, short, shallow thrusts emptying him out.  Tony collapsed onto Steve’s chest, great, heaving breaths torn from him.  He found that didn’t want to pull out right away, though he couldn’t knot again this soon.  Staying inside Steve even as his cock softened was close enough that he couldn’t bring himself to withdraw, the feeling of being inside Steve, being joined, even this rather poor substitute, too heady to let go right away.  He nuzzled against Steve for awhile, floating in the security of being this close to his Omega, being part of him.
He stopped abruptly as soon as he pushed back the curtain and held it there for a long moment.  Fairy tricks, he thought, with a shake of his head to try clear it, though it only partially worked.  Something to occupy me, Steve remembered.  Something to occupy him turned out to be a tall, wooden easel, with a large canvas stretched over it and a table laden with jars of paints in so many hues that Steve couldn’t name them all and a case of brushes in various lengths and bristle shapes, one a delicate fan of miniver-tail hairs so finely wrought, when he held it to the light, Steve could see each translucent fiber where it was woven together with a waxen silk thread at the base.  There was even a treatise by Alcherius on colors and techniques, its pages so old, they were yellowed and crisp with age.
“He probably just doesn’t want to worry you, Maria,” Peggy suggested, darting a quick, hard look at the camera.
“You wanted a way out.  But, you wanted to beat them, too.  You took something they did to you, something they tried to take from you, and you turned it against them.  The thing they thought debilitated you, made you easy to control?  You took it and made yourself stronger than any of them ever imagined,” Steve continued.  “Tony...you’re mine.  Mine,” Steve growled low in his throat, making Tony’s heart skip and breath catch.  “Every part of you is mine.  This part…maybe especially this part.”
Steve puffed out a frustrated breath of air and turned his eyes back to stare at the bed’s canopy without really seeing it.  It was…frustrating.  Annoying, even.  That’s what the tight, twisting sensation in the back of his mind was.  Annoyance.  With himself or with Tony, he wasn’t sure.  Himself, mostly, he supposed.  Had he said no before?  To Tony? Why not?  In the beginning, he had been too worried that any misstep would mean a terrible fate for Cam, but that worry had passed some time ago, if he was honest with himself.  So, why had he held his tongue for this long?
He tipped his head back and looked at the ceiling again. Perseverance. You can do it.  You’re having the time of your life, he told himself.  This is what you wanted.  No take-backs, he thought as he swiped his hand on his shirt to clear the last of the punch as best he could and reached for the end call button, thumb hovering for just a moment.  The fifth ring cut off mid-ring.  Tony’s stomach dropped to probably the house’s basement, then bobbed back up to his throat.
He followed Fury to the elevator, watching him surreptitiously as Fury’s voice authorization for the isolation floor was accepted. When they reached their destination, the doors slid open into a rather sterile looking environment, a large room with a few seats and a window that offered a view into a similar room on the other side.  Fury went to stand by the glass, peering inside, then nodded, as if satisfied and stepped back.
“No, that’s it. Um…thanks, JARVIS,” Steve said.  He grabbed his pack from beside the bed and went to put his last few items in his bag for the journey.  As he reached in, his hand stopped, hovering just above the contents of his pack.  He frowned, momentarily confused, because he knew he hadn’t put that—oh.  He huffed out a breath of air, as he pulled the long, cardboard tube from his pack.  Steve grinned and opened the tube, dumping the contents into his hand.  He carefully spread the new version of the Iron Man poster out on the bed. This one, like his drawing, had Tony with the faceplate up in the Iron Man armor, but it was clearly Tony, eyes intense and focused, staring in challenge from the center of the poster.
“Look—“ Tony started, then broke off as he watched Steve nod along politely with whatever it was the young man next to him was saying.  That wasn’t the thing that bothered Tony, though.  It was the way Steve had his arm up, slightly outstretched in front of him, hand fisted tightly across his chest.  Tony had seen the movement enough to know it from memory.  It was just that usually there was an actual shield there.  Fuck.  Seriously, just fuck my life, Tony thought, turning and slamming the glass down on the bar hard enough for some of the golden liquid to slosh onto the tips of his fingers where they gripped the glass.
“Liked your surprise, huh?” Tony asked around a yawn.  His limbs were heavy.  Movement seemed…not worth it.  Steve would take care of him, anyway.  There would be soft cloths, wet with warm, scented water stroking over his skin.  There would be a clean blanket, the puffy down kind that Tony liked.  A cold bottle of water with little chips of ice in it.  Bites of chocolate and crisp apples, if he wanted them.  Tony liked those parts, too, when he could just let it happen around him and keep on drifting like this until he slept.
Getting up, Steve picked up the water bottle, a few tissues, and the seat cushion from the chair, then walked over to the wall. He poured some of the water onto the man’s ass, making him jump in startle a bit, Steve noticed, grinning slightly. He used the tissues to clean the man up a bit, then tossed those and the water bottle aside. The cushion went on the floor, and he quickly sank down onto his knees. The beautiful, wide hole—the one that had been waiting just for him, just the way he left it because someone trusted him enough to want to do this again even after everything—was directly in front of him.
Steve knew he should probably refuse the ride and just walk to the bus stop, but he couldn’t have given up these last few moments with Tony for anything.  He crawled into the car without looking up and sank back into the seat.  To his surprise, Tony slammed the limo door shut without getting in and walked over to where Hammer was about to get into his own car.  Steve couldn’t see what was going on with the concrete pile-on or hear anything from inside the limo, but that didn’t stop his imagination from running wild with the possibilities.  Probably something along the lines of, “Dodged a bullet with that one, Hammer, too clingy by half,” Steve imagined bitterly.
“They have a lot of programs that he believes you would excel in,” Coulson replied.  “I know he wanted to deliver the news himself, but this current mission is…a bit uncertain.  Timing-wise, I mean.  And the acceptance deadline is coming up in a few weeks.  Plus, I think he was…excited.  For you to know.”
“Hey!  You saw me fly!” Tony said, leaning forward and pointing the sandwich that had been halfway to his mouth at Steve.
“I’m not a hero, Tony,” Steve said.  “I’m not.  Just a man.  You credit me far too much, and yourself far too little. I haven’t done anything that anyone else in my position wouldn’t do,” Steve protested.
. God, he could really have this.  If he just hadn’t screwed it up already, his sins hovering around him like Jacob Marley shaking his chains.  He couldn’t lose Steve. Even if this all went south, he couldn’t lose Steve, he just couldn’t. The universe would just have to understand, he told himself firmly, turning to the side and swiping his hand over his face.
“Good,” Steve said, visibly relaxing.  Tony could feel muscles uncoil from Steve’s fight or, well, fight harder mode. “Fridge should be full.  How ‘bout I pack us up some lunch, huh?” Steve offered.
“Enjoy fishing, Captain. I hear it’s a very relaxing pastime,” Coulson said as brightly as Coulson probably did anything, nodding his goodbye as Steve finally dropped his hand and let the elevator doors slide shut.  Steve wasn’t sure if Coulson was trying to make a joke or a point.
“You know, it really does,” Steve agreed.  Steve laughed then, loud and full-bodied, with a smile that lit up his face like a beacon.  It was the laugh Tony loved, the one that belonged to him, but had started to belong more and more to both of them, to that space in between them that was slowly filling with all kinds of things, he thought.  Good things.  Happy things.  Laughter and joy and coffee machine beeps, warm toes and roving hands and soft places to land when they needed them.
Steve shot him a glare over his shoulder and felt Tony’s body shake with laughter where he curled against Steve’s side.
“He just likes me because I was the one who found him,” Tony suggested, watching Steve try to squirm his way out of Natasha’s reach.
There was an idea in geology, neocatastrophism, to be exact, that said that conditions on earth change very slowly, except when they don’t, or, said differently, the history of the earth is basically long periods of boredom interrupted occasionally by panic.  That pretty much summed up his life, Tony thought with a dull sort of discomfit.
Steve stopped in front of a door where someone had written 4B in the center using what looked like a black sharpie.  There was a blue carpet mat outside the door, and Tony’s mind flashed to the truly obnoxious welcome mat Steve had gotten for their crappy Boston apartment, with its picture of a cheerful beaver gnawing on a branch proclaiming “I’ve got beaver fever,” which Steve had found hysterical because the MIT mascot was, of course, nature’s industrious engineer.  He’d gotten it from the campus store, probably spent half their grocery budget on the damn thing, then been caught between giggles and red-faced embarrassment over it.  Honestly, sometimes, the guy had the sense of humor of a 12-year old.  Tony had complained and mocked and threatened and secretly loved everything about it, he remembered, absently twisting the Brass Rat that signified an MIT grad on his finger.
“If the prophecy is true, then I don’t think it works that way, Tony,”  Steve said around a rough sigh. “I can’t just turn my back on what I’m supposed to do.”
“It is a big change,” Obie said agreeably, sipping at his drink.  “Lots of change happening lately.”
He’d told Pepper that closure would be good for him. Maybe he needed it more than he had realized or more than he had been willing to admit. Seeing Steve again...it had rattled him, that much was easy to parse, but the rest of it, the way he could draw the exact color of Steve's eyes to his mind, the way they got soft and crinkled at the corners when he really smiled, the current of feeling that still seemed to run between them, no matter how stretched thin it should be, how quickly the remembered burst of warmth could resurface when he thought about Steve bragging—yes, bragging, dammit—on Tony, everything was running circles through his head, and his subconscious was already busy happily offering every excuse it could.
“Tony,” Steve said again, quieter, gentler, and pulling Tony’s gaze back to him of its own volition.
“Sorry.  Sorry, that was…God, that was a lot.  I didn’t mean to just dump all my shit on you like that,” Tony said, pushing a hand through his hair.  “It’s not bad, most of the time, I mean. I’m not, like—it isn’t that I wouldn’t be there. With you.  I don’t work
As the man stepped closer, it occurred to Steve that perhaps he should be afraid and that he might better run, even if it hurt, what with it being night and this man being unknown to him, but the thoughts were distant somehow, replaced with a wide, open curiosity about the newcomer.
“Oh. Oh, Tony,ugh, please, just…gah, Tony,” Steve murmured, head tossing from side to side and eyes glazed wide, staring down at Tony’s mouth wrapped around his cock.  Tony thought about the way Steve’s hole had cradled his cock last night, and closed his eyes with a groan, taking as much of Steve’s length as he could handle.  Steve’s hip bucked once, then twice, his balls tightening and stomach muscles clenching.  Steve’s hands wound in Tony’s hair, not pulling, but strong enough to hold Tony steady.  Tony felt the hot gush of come flow down his throat, the shout of Tony’s name falling from his lips.  He swallowed around Steve’s cock, the taste of him filling Tony’s mouth.
“Calvin wouldn’t know a good opportunity if it smacked him on the ass. But, he wasn’t opposed to the idea, let’s just say. Even suggested I see if we could work out a trade,” Whitney purred, watching Tony with slanted eyes, her head cocked to the side in question. “I think he may have quite enjoyed that.”
“Hey, if the bootie fits,” Tony shrugged, trying to pry Steve’s hands, which seemed to have somehow achieved tentacle-like gripping abilities, from whatever parts of the suit one grabbed onto as soon as Tony managed to get the other one free.  “He.  Won’t.  Let—oomph--Go.”
His legs started to ache after a while, and he shifted slightly, though he didn’t come out of the kneel.  Tony told him to kneel, so he would kneel.  He had already disobeyed once, even though Tony had explained his reason for telling Steve to stay in their chambers.  True, he hadn’t been thinking of it at the time, not really, but he wondered, as he waited, if it hadn’t been there in the back of his mind when he left the room.  He remembered needing to get out, thinking the guards may stop him and not caring.  Maybe wanting it a little.  Wanting to see what would happen, spoiling for a fight he could win and not what battle was raging between his mind and heart.
They stayed like that for a long moment, until Steve could feel his body start to go boneless, like he could simply melt to the floor if he let himself.  He felt Tony pull out, leaving a sudden emptiness. He sighed and heard a soft, answering chuffing noise from Tony.
“Are you okay?” Helicarrier Steve asked in a hushed, awed voice that Steve barely recognized.  “Wow, Tony.  Wow,” Helicarrier Steve whispered, then crawled off of Tony and laid down next to him, pulling Tony over until he rested on his chest.
They broke apart, and Tony stretched over to reach the bowl of oil warming over a candle that Steve now noticed was on the bedside table.  He slathered a good portion the oil over his hands.  Steve swallowed.  Sucked in a breath.  Tony canted his head to look at Steve, then slowly, deliberately, with his eyes locked on Steve’s, rubbed an oiled hand up and down his own cock until it was coated so liberally as to be dripping.
He was trying though.  He read the latest Franzen after all.  Well, most of it, anyway.  Okay, like a couple chapters.  Jesus that dude was pre-tent-ious, Tony thought, elongating the word in his head.  Still, he went to all those lectures with Ty where the speakers talked about things that were Kafkaesque, whatever the fuck that was, and those poetry readings where guys with chin pubes and black turtlenecks recited line after line that all seemed to Tony to stack up to, ‘I can’t get laid, and it’s definitely not my fault.’  He visited museums and art galleries with Ty, where they stared at a black canvas and talked about how deep the artist’s message about the painful death spiral of life was.  Well, Ty talked. Tony mostly nodded.
“So…we are to stay here,” Steve said as he leaned back heavily on the divan and rubbed a hand over his stomach.  Over the balcony’s ledge, he could see the city spread out before him, all sand and rust colored, as if the houses and buildings had sprung out of the rocks themselves, and the Castle rising up behind him, ringing its thick, stone walls around the bailey and the outbuildings, including the compound where he and Cam stuffed themselves on the King’s largesse.
“Sweet and grumpy?  Those two things don’t even go together, Rogers.  They are, in fact, diametrically opposed,” Tony replied.  “Besides, I am
“Yeah, but you had those out when I came down.  Now…let me think…who else would be up this early?  Hmm…wait, wait…its coming to me…oh, right!  Steve usually heads down here after his run and shower, which I’m sure is totally unrelated to your presence, because it isn’t like you’ve memorized his schedule or anything,” Clint said, sitting down in one of the counter stools and leaning over, cupping his chin in one hand, all innocence.
Steve dropped the tags abruptly and stepped back, turning towards the railing and bracing his palms on top of it.  He dipped his head to his chest, let out a long breath and closed his eyes for a moment before looking back at Tony.
good.  So good, you’ve earned a reward.”  Steve could feel his skin heat at Tony’s words.  Pleasure, pride, elation, satisfaction, it all swirled around in a heady haze in his mind that he could bask in.  He had done well. He had been good for Tony. He
“Yes, this is for you,” Tony said, holding up a long, thick metal phallus that curved slightly upward and had a strand of perfectly cut pearls, each as big as a large berry, on the end that swung down against Tony’s arm.  It was exquisitely crafted, with a rounded head and small slit, and even veins running up and down the side of the shaft.  He knew, of course, whose cock it was modeled after, and that thought, that Tony had ordered this made, knowing what he would use it for, wanting to use it, that was enough to make Steve’s cock swell against the cage around it.  Steve made a garbled sound in the back of his throat.  Tony hummed in response, coating the plug in oil until it dripped with it, then walked back over and stood at the foot of the bed again where Steve’s ass hung in the air.  Without preamble, Tony pushed an oil-slickened finger inside Steve’s hole, making him jolt with the sudden intrusion.
“Who isn’t afraid to do what must be done to keep order and balance in this realm,” Stane replied.  “Even when his King will not.”
Tony was trying too hard for joviality, Steve could see that plainly enough, but he was trying, reaching out for something he thought Steve would enjoy.  The least Steve could do was meet Tony’s attempt halfway.
“Why not?” Tony said to the photographer.  The security guard moved away, and Tony slid his arm around Steve’s waist and moved closer, beaming at the photographer while the camera flashed.
Tony rolled back over and sat up.  There was a loud thwumping noise getting progressively louder, and the whole room was shaking just enough for Tony to feel it.  Above him, a thud followed by a creaking sound, and the whole room seemed to almost jump.  Or, Tony did, he wasn’t sure.  His mind had already gotten past helicopter and run screaming into the arms of Thank Fucking God.  He scooted off the bed and walked carefully to the bedroom door as the noise and vibration continued from above.
Steve’s grip on the edge of the sink tightened hard enough that he could feel the tiny fissures start to form against the pads of his fingers where the porcelain cracked under the strain.  Damn.  He was usually better about being careful.  Better about a lot of things.  Better.  Behind him, the shower pounded into the tile, background noise to the throbbing refrain in his head, drowning it out, or letting him drown in it, he wasn’t sure.
Finishing up his sketches, Steve looked down at them.  He’d gotten them right.  Finally.  Steve carefully laid them out on the table in a row, then with a last look, gathered them up and transferred them to a portfolio.  He sent an email to Deirdre, telling her they were done, and placed them outside his apartment for the courier to pick up.
Breakfast turned out to be a somewhat hurried affair, now that the world seemed to know that the King was awake.   Steve barely managed to put on a robe and down a piece of buttered bread before Cam came in, followed by two of Tony’s personal servants.  Cam ushered him out of the room and down to the smaller antechamber where Cam had spent the night with one of the trunks meant for Steve. Somehow, getting dressed and on the way ended up taking far longer than Steve would have imagined, despite everyone’s attempts to stick to the schedule Ms. Potts had so meticulously prepared for them.   Cam went through several outfits before settling on cream colored robes embroidered with golden threads and a matching headpiece that covered his hair and most of his face, save for his eyes, where a ruby the size of a small pebble hung just above them. Something simple for travel, Cam said, while Steve made a face. Tony clearly approved, though, Steve noted when he stepped out of the inn and made his way towards Tony’s carriage.  His gaze was warm and appreciative.
“I want to meet him,” Steve repeated.  “If he agrees, then…yes,” Steve said, feeling the air go out of him in a whoosh, making his chest tight.
“Hold his neck,” she ordered.  “Help me roll him.”  Stane took Tony’s head and neck in his hands, and Howard took his legs, and the three of them carefully rolled him to his side. Daniel shrugged off his jacket and laid it over Tony’s shoulders while he heaved.
“I—it’s not an actual list.  It isn’t,” Steve insisted when Tony shot him a skeptical look.  “Just in my head.”
Beyond the door, a large, round security desk waited, manned by two hulking cave troll-sized Alphas doing their best to avoid eye contact with Tony.  Good to know that the contingency plan of the government’s top spy agency for an infiltration by Omegas was literally just looking the other way, Tony thought with a flash of annoyance.  He didn’t have time for this. Steve was here, somewhere, and there had been an
Why was it so hard?  This is what they had been working towards, wasn’t it?  He looked over at Shellhead, who wasn’t looking at him, just staring down at his tentacles where they undulated in the water with a strangely hard expression on his face.  If I don’t leave now, I won’t go, Steve thought to himself. The knowledge, and it
“Because of the one eye thing!  That’s—come on, that’s funny!” Tony protested.  “Who snitched?  Was it Paz?  It was Coulson, wasn’t it?  Because I mocked his forms. I’m going to hack their system and block Galaga, I swear to God.   Clint has the three highest scores, but I think he only cares because he enters his initials as ASS.  Which, like, no one is exactly suggesting that’s inaccurate or anything.  Anyway, I just wanted to know when you’d be back.  He was being less than forthcoming.  Was he pissed?”
Hindsight currently deciding to be somewhat predictably helpful, Tony realized that he probably should have at least made a show to Coulson, on one of the man's frequent visits to the cabin, about being concerned over Steve's longer-than-expected mission. That would have been proper. Polite.
“I’d like to be on—ow, ow, okay, I’m going,” Tony smirked as Bruce grabbed him and dragged him bodily towards the door.
“I don’t think that is required,” Steve replied quietly, then flattened his mouth into a grimace. Something in his stomach twisted at the words, true though they were.  “Sometimes it can just be…a good match.”
Tony’s eyes were still on him, watching his movements in the mirror, hands curled into fists against the glass.  Steve knelt down, feeling the gym mat sink a bit beneath his weight, and tugged off Tony’s shoes and socks, then pulled Tony’s pants and boxers the rest of the way off of him until Tony was bared from the waist down.  He knew Tony was still uncomfortable about his chest, whatever wound he’d received in Afghanistan, so Steve didn’t push it.  He looked up, drinking in the sight before him.  There was something obscenely glorious about seeing Tony like this, about having put Tony like this, half-naked under the bright glare of the gym lights, smearing himself against the mirror as he waited for Steve.
Tony was gone, too.  Whether to Thanos and his gauntlet or something else, it didn’t really matter. Tony was gone.  No one had heard from him since he hopped a ride on one of Thanos’ ships. If he could have, if there was any possible way, Tony would have at least contacted Pepper and Rhodey.  Steve knew that. Them, at least, Steve thought with a slight gnashing of his teeth as his jaw tightened. Tony would have tried to reach them. Which meant, in all likelihood, Tony was gone, one way or the other.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Steve replied.  “Strange day,” he said, looking over his shoulder at Tony.  “I say this as someone who once woke up seventy years in the future surrounded by SHIELD scientists with blow-dryers, so when I say that it was a strange way to wake up, I want you to know that I do have a frame of reference.”
“You built this?”  Steve asked.  “In a cave?  In Afghanistan?  While a captive?  Tony…this…that’s amazing.”
“I am fine,” Steve said again.  He thought he sounded better.  Stronger.  At least his voice wasn’t shaking like a leaf on the wind any longer.
“They would not touch you,” Steve cut in with the same delusional certainty.  “If you want to learn how to drive, I don’t see how it’s anyone’s business but mine.”
It took that fraction of a second for Steve to realize that he had stopped pretending somewhere between a panic attack and Gene Simmons’ tongue.  This wasn’t a date.  This wasn’t real.  All of this, Tony’s attention and interest, this was for YouTube and Twitter and the Vegas police, not for him, not really.  In the real world, someone like Tony Stark would never be interested in much of anything beyond the obvious from someone like him, and that had been fine the other day, but now, Steve’s gut twisted, and he felt as if someone had doused him in cold water.
This wonderful fanart was done by mushroomhobbit (mushroomhobbit.tumblr.com) to go with Celestial Navigation and depicts Tony trying his best to make dinner for Steve.  I love how it captures how hard this was for him and how brave he was trying to be.    Posted with permission of the artist.
“You were very brave.  Throwing the lamp was completely not an overreaction,” Nat intoned mildly, a smile playing on her lips as she twined her arm through Barnes’ and leaned in close.
“Those things you signed away. They're worth millions. Probably tens of millions,” Tony told him, watching Steve's face closely for any sign of shock or surprise that never so much as registered. “You could've been sitting pretty, living off the Stark dole all these years instead of blowing it all. Is that what you did? Forget it. I don't care,” Tony corrected with a sharp wave of his hand.
“Rhodey told me about Gulmira, Hansel,” Tony said, voice going tight and quiet.  The elevator pinged, making Steve jump.  His heart raced.  Just the elevator, he told himself.  It’s just a damn elevator chime.  “Sorry, that’s—timing, yeah.  I know.  I’m—shit.  I’m sorry, here,” Tony rushed out, bracing an arm across the elevator door to hold it.  “I just thought you should know.  That I know.  That he told me, I mean.  Not the—not the details or whatever, just that you were there and uh, that you—I guess I kind of owe you my life, seeing as how I’d probably be still doing my forty years of wandering in the desert if it weren’t for you, so there’s that, and, so, I wanted to say, you know…thanks and that’s really, really small, and—I like the tie, too, so.  Yeah.  Thanks.  For the tie thing, but mostly the location thing, however you got it, and I’m sorry for—for what happened to you and your team over there.  You should know that I’m terrible with guilt.  Truly, truly awful.  Back me up here, Pep—Pep?”
“It’ll ruin me.  It’ll ruin everything.  You know that.  They’ll blacklist me.  Company’s already struggling.  This…it’ll ruin things for him, too,” Howard said, voice steady now, whatever façade of sorrow or contrition he’d been attempting seeming to have faded entirely.
“Let us get up, then, shall we?  You must be tired from your travels,” Lord Rand observed.  “Your rooms await, and we will toast your good journey at the feast tonight.  I am glad you will be staying with us long enough to enjoy some of the Ridge’s hospitality.  My son has prepared a small tourney for your amusement the tomorrow after our morning tour to Deep Illum.  If any of your knights would care to participate, they are more than welcome.”
In his head, Tony could hear Rhodey's words, not the ones about something being off, though that was bouncing in his head, too, but about how Steve had looked at him. Moon eyes, Rhodey said. And Pepper, who just wanted him to be happy, and could see past all of this to what it was that gave him that chance.
“That’s not the point, Buck.  It’s not good. It’s…I don’t know what it is, I’m still trying to wrap my head around it,” Steve said.  “Did you order the whole room service menu?” he demanded, frowning down at Barnes.
“Settled?” Steve asked.  His voice sounded warm and fond, and it ran down Tony’s spine with a shiver.
It didn’t matter.  It wasn’t his problem.  There wasn’t really anything for him to do, anyway.  It was up to Anthony’s parents to find a suitable mate, not that it particularly boded well that they were willing to offer him up to…whoever it was Fury told these people Steve was.
“No idea what you mean,” Tony replied through clenched teeth, a flash of annoyance sparking through him.  He honestly just…wanted this to not get screwed up, just this one thing.  Cap would come in, freshly showered from his run, and Tony would have coffee ready and maybe he could whip up an omelet or, you know, grab Steve and take him someplace where Tony could pay someone to make an omelet that was actually edible, whatever.
“Well…rather awkwardly, the building kind of came with keys to each of the units.  Just in case of emergency.  Pepper has them.  Not me.  I wouldn’t…except for that time where I did, but, all in all, I think we can agree that ended well.  Or, will end well.  Not that that’s an excuse, because, obviously, huge invasion of privacy and all that.  Which…yeah.  What I’m saying is—“ Tony tried.
“Don’t do that,” Steve snapped at Barnes, who flattened his mouth in response and let out a long breath through is nose.
“The faithful would say the dead speak to us, if we but listen,” Tony told him.  “The faith has its uses, to be sure, but I don’t usually put much stock into their precepts, but that…After the death of my parents, I would sometimes hear their voices in my head.  My father berating me for not...being what I was supposed to be, more often than not. Or that of Jarvis, my father’s manservant. His voice, probably most of all. Usually when I was doing something that I knew wasn’t good for me. Which, at that time, was rather often,” Tony admitted with a slight shrug, mouth twisting into a flat grimace.
“Right, right, the toroidal field lines keep it self-sustaining while—“ Tony looked up, blinking at him in surprise.  Steve dropped the towel.  “Yeah, we’re done.”
“Yeah.  I--I get that. Something worth it in the trying, I mean,” Tony said, taking a quick bite.  “So why…” Tony began, then stopped himself, his mouth flattening.
This wasn’t a punishment.  She wouldn’t have done that, even if she had some way of knowing what would happen between him and Tony.   The dead still speak to us, he thought with a weary sigh, as he remembered T’Challa’s words and clicked on the next file.
“There’s…” Tony muttered, glancing around in frustration, “an appalling lack of available items to throw at your head.”
“It’s crap if you can’t be smart about who you spout off to.  Like Mr. Stark here, he doesn’t want to hear that kind of thing!  Come on, you know that if you’d played your cards right, they’d have given you another Medal of Honor, but you had to go mouth off at General Sorenson in front of the Congressional delegation.  Don’t give me that thing with the little frown, you know I’m right. He knows I’m right,” Brock finished, turning to Tony. “He just can’t help himself.”
Tony, of course, didn’t want anything like that, not from Steve, anyway. He wanted his garage and his privacy and his pills, and so Steve would make sure he had that, because that was--that was the thing he could do today.  That, and just buy the damn things on the list.  Come on, soldier, Steve told himself, a breath of frustration leaking out.
He wasn’t even sure what was a lie anymore and what he just wished were not true.  Maybe it didn’t matter, not now.
“Really?  You know astronomy, hmmm? How fascinating,” Stone said with a low, surprised bark of laughter.  He took another drag of his cigarette.  “What about that one?” he asked, pointing towards a general area above the U.S. Bank Tower.
Tony looked up at him, his expression tight, almost pained, and he swallowed hard enough for Steve to hear it.  He opened his mouth, then closed it again, blinking at Steve as he sucked in a breath, then slowly let it out. “I love you, too.”
in Tony’s estimation.  In fact, as life highlights went, that was pretty much at the top of Tony’s list.  It might also have been the only thing on Tony’s list at that point, but whatever.  He had not been
“The spectacle, as you put it, is what they want.  What they expect,” Tony said.  “Believe me, I have been doing this longer than you have been alive, my beautiful one.”
A surge of sour, frustrated bitterness clogged his throat for a moment as he approached the door.   How ironic.  He’d hated it then, the whole idea of Bonding to this hand-picked stranger.  It shouldn’t have surprised him the way it did, that his parents would find someone to stick him with who could further their interests. That was what he was good for.  He should have expected it.  It shouldn’t have hurt that much.
“Uh-huh.  Because old-fashioned, ex-military, hippy-dippy artist just screams ‘for a good time, call,’” Tony snorted.
“Stop it, Buck, come on, this isn’t on you. I told you, if I had been there that night at the bar, I’d have decked the guy, too.  You know me. You really think I’d have just walked it off? This whole thing, this is…this is the media and paparazzi and all kinds of stuff we were never meant to be dealing with, okay?” Steve said.  “It’s not on you.”
“Please. Some of us are trying to eat, here.  It was bad enough before, the two of you, gods,” Bruce quipped with a shake of his head.  He poked at the fire with a stick, sending embers into the air like bright dandelion seeds.
“Is the adorably awkward thing a show? Because I have to say, it’s working for me. How are you real? Seriously, get down here and kiss me,” Tony demanded over a laugh, arms snaking up around Steve’s neck.
“I’m sorry,” Tony replied, voice gruff with emotion.  “You want, we can go down and see her. After the thing with Ross is done. Maybe stop at the Tower on the way back.  Get away from all this a little.  Let things settle.”
“Threatening an officer. I know.  It was fantastic,” Tony grinned.  Rhodey smiled in return, for a moment, then the joviality faded from his face.
Er, well, I will possibly still be sabrecmc on tumblr.  You can also find me on twitter, Discord, pillowfort and Dreamwidth under sabrecmc.
That was probably the one thing he couldn’t do.  Maybe they had known it. Bruce, at least. Steve thought there had been a moment just as he stepped onto the platform when Bruce had looked at him and understood.  Because Bruce would be ready to stop trying soon, to start trying to adjust, to live with it, and Steve couldn’t. Wouldn’t. And they both knew it, and saw the moment when they parted ways on the horizon, inching closer, and neither of them able to do anything to stop it.
“So, wait, you said you had to go into cryosleep to stave off the need to, ah, do this. Why? What’s that about?  I mean, can’t you just, you know?” Tony asked, making a crude, jerking motion between his legs.
“Don’t give him the reactor,” Steve said abruptly.   “I don’t care what he says about what’s happening with the company or how much the company needs it.”
“The Captain is strong.  This magical potion that runs in his veins…it will help, yes?” Thor asked, looking around at all of them in turn.  No one answered.  It was the quietest silence Tony had ever heard, the kind that is waiting for someone to speak and say what no one wants to say.  He wanted to shout into the quiet, roar out his pain and fear and anger, throw things for good measure, make some God-damned noise, anything that would break the silence that seemed to echo with too much of what wasn’t being said.
. Behind those walls Tony put around him like armor.  He wanted to tear them down and see what was there.
“You’re something else, Tony,” Steve said, glancing down at the other man.  It was a strange feeling, Steve thought.  Being noticed.  Being seen.  Having someone care enough to pay attention to the stupid, little things that didn’t matter.  Almost as nice as having someone notice the big things that did. Good Lord, the man was probably going to buy him a bike and put him in therapy, Steve thought with a chuckle that drew Tony’s eyes to his face.  He wasn’t sure if he should shake Tony or hug him or both.
“You like the pretty light, huh?  How about this?” Tony said, holding the gauntlet out in front of him and powering it up just enough to make it glow blue and spark.   “Not a magical, glowing bridge through space, but not bad, right?”
Tony withdrew enough to enjoy the sight of his cock coated in Steve’s slick before pushing back in again, long, deep thrusts, gripping Steve’s hips to keep him in place as Tony’s balls slapped against the crack of Steve’s ass, coming away wet.  His rhythm faltered at that, felt himself tighten, stomach clenching.  He reached down as his cock slid out in again, he pressed his index finger in as well, hooking it upwards to press against the cluster of nerves as he thrust, the sensation of Steve’s body stretched around his finger and cock, both ramming forward at different angles almost too much.  Steve was making a low, guttural sound, and well, there went another rent in carpeting, but who cared because Steve was pressing back against him, meeting his thrusts, so he pulled his finger out, keeping his cock pumping in and out, and used the slippery moisture dripping off his finger to reach around and coat Steve’s shaft as it jutted against his stomach.
“In here,” Tony said, pointing to a large, glass-enclosed room that held a grand piano and a few comfortable looking sofas.
“I feel like I should tell you not to do that, but…not going to lie, it’s kind of awesome,” Tony said, returning Steve’s look.
to go a little bit more, yes?” Cam suggested.  Steve turned around and gave him a long look, then nodded and watched the boy smile with relief, eyes brightening again.
“I know this is a lot to take in,” Tony started, choosing the words carefully.  His gaze was locked on Steve, but his eyes were soft. “You don’t have to process everything tonight. Bruce is going to give you some of his sleepy-time juice.  Just a small dose, but it should knock you out. If you want. It’ll help with the headaches.”
Tony bit the corner of his lip and twisted his head to look out the window as Happy slowed the car to turn.  A large, ornately scrolling gate flanked by a high, sand-colored stone wall loomed in front of them.  Happy tapped the keycode into a small box that jutted out just in front of the gate, and it slowly began to swing open.  Not for the first time, Tony was reminded of a large mouth, swallowing them down some creature’s gullet, its metal mouth closing behind them.  He cast a quick look at Steve, who seemed to be staring straight ahead, though his gaze flicked to Tony as soon as Tony looked over.
“Quera,” the Captain said, then lifted him down and dismounted, drawing his sword while one of his men rushed forward and drove a blade into the ground in front of Obie.
, he had not forgotten. “There are two rooms, just like this one,” he continued, then stopped and cleared his throat, rocking back a bit on his heels.  “I just—I didn’t want you to think…I know I come on strong sometimes. Habit,” he grimaced. “I know we’re doing this whole in-like thing…or, the, ah. The other thing we said.  Sort of said. Anyway, point being, I’m all about taking it slow, okay? I’ve got a long history of making bad decisions. Rushing into things and screwing it up before it could go anywhere.  Bit of a thing with me,” his reflection grimaced. “But, I am trying—with you—break the cycle and all that, right? So, just…I’m saying, no expectations, okay? No pressure. No rush at all, whatsoever, alright?” he paused and reached up to scratch at the side of his face, then scrub at his goatee with one hand.  “Except, obviously for the whole marriage thing.”
“Okay, so it’s Briar, Booker and then it’s…Doctor Stevenson, the civilian, right?” Steve said, looking down at the notice in his folder.
“Only that her Aunt left instructions in her will that it was to be given to you,” T’Challa told him.
“I know,” Tony said quietly.  “Bruce says you’re my inkwell.  No.  Wait.  That’s not right.  You have a ponytail.”
for once in his life. Of course he hadn’t done that. When did he ever? That wasn’t fair, he knew that, but God-dammit, he wasn’t in the mood for fair. He wanted to shake him. To shake someone. But he couldn’t, because they were celebrating. They’d
“My records do not indicate a message with those particular parameters from Captain America,” JARVIS responded.
“Wow. That must’ve hurt to get out,” Steve said finally with a small, frustrated sigh to keep the bitterness at bay.  He eyed Tony, who was looking between Steve and the water bottle clutched in his hands.
“I suspect they would like that very much, indeed,” Tony replied, casting a quick look over the boy’s head to Steve.  “Keep at your studies and perhaps you will meet them one day.  Your tutor says you are his brightest student.”
“Pepper did it,” Tony replied truthfully.  “My aesthetic is more dogs playing poker,” Tony said with a grin, causing Museum Guy to drop his hand as if burned.
Besides, Anto didn’t think it would have ever even occurred to anyone else to keep the cave’s existence a secret.  He didn’t think any of the rest of the would even be able to comprehend a secret. There were things they did not know, because they lacked the Memories for those things, but these weren’t secrets.  Not the way the cave was.
He heard Tony grunt in acceptance, but he didn’t relax against Steve, keeping his hold tight, as if he could keep the words in that way or keep other words from spilling out, Steve wasn’t sure which. At some point, Tony got up and padded naked over to the washbasin, returning with dampened towels that they used to clean themselves as best they could. Tony dropped them haphazardly on the floor when they were done, so Steve got up and placed them in a pile off to the side. His stomach decided to awaken enough to remind him that he had not yet eaten, so he grabbed the tray of food from the small table. He placed it on the bed, and passed the flagon of wine to Tony before taking a drink himself. They ate cold meat and warm cheese on soft breads, sliced pears drizzled with honey and squares of dark chocolate that Tony had eventually convinced Steve to at least try.
Thirty seconds ago, and it was, sure, fine, whatever you want Tony.  Have a pat on the head.  Now, one casual mention of actual legal authority having an objection, and suddenly, Steve was
“Aren’t you two supposed to be honeymooning it?” Barnes asked, raising a skeptical eyebrow.  “What’s it going to look like, me showing up and third wheeling it?”
“Come now. I chose it a little more than you did,” Tony corrected gently. Steve let out a breath of air and looked away. “I can’t change that for you. I wish I could, but I can’t. I can change it for others.”
“You want to try removing him, Glenn?  Be my guest.  As it is, I have a team of security officers who are all currently indisposed with a sudden but debilitating illness that prevents them from responding,” Coulson said with a huff.  “Come on, Glenn.  It isn’t like Rogers is going to catch an infection, is it?” Coulson argued.  “What do you want me to do?” Coulson finished, gesturing towards were Tony was gripping Steve’s wrist and shoulder while Steve glowered at them all through half-lidded eyes.
“It’s already there.  Right where we call ourselves a team,” Steve responded, giving Tony a moment to decide how he was going to take that.  “We have to be different, Tony.  It has to mean something, really mean something.  Us. Together.”  He wasn’t even sure what he was talking about anymore, but Tony didn’t seem to want to press the issue.
“Huh?  Me?  Oh, ah, no.  Not that time. Heard about it from Nat.  She was with you.  You know, for a super-spy, she is really, really chatty when she wants to be,” Tony mentioned as he maneuvered through the streets.  He remembered that conversation because it had largely consisted of Tony shouting ‘He did what???’ over and over again.  “I was on SHIELD’s Naughty List at the time.  Or HYDRA’s as the case may be.  They weren’t exactly sharing.”  Voluntarily, anyway.  Wasn’t like he hadn’t been keeping tabs on St--his teammates.  Again, all of his teammates.
“Gifts,” Steve said slowly as if he was testing the word. “I would have…tried to find out what interested you, so I could talk to you about it.  Dinners at restaurants you liked.  Ah, outings to places you enjoyed.  Chaperoned, of course.  The usual.”
He could see the tension spread out in waves across Steve’s chest, muscles tightening and stance becoming rigid.  Fight or fight harder, Tony had a split-second to recognize, before Steve moved, just, as it turns out, to cross his arms over his chest, but it was movement, and the line was way, way behind Tony, he knew that, he always had to push, didn’t he, but, Tony wasn’t stupid.   He ducked his head, braced himself and waited.  The waiting was the worst.  That was a lie, but he sometimes told himself that when he waited.
“I didn’t want to like you,” Steve said again.   “But, I did.  You made me laugh.  You made me think.  You made me remember what it was like to—to be someone I haven’t been in a long time.   I didn’t know what to do with that.  I wasn’t supposed to want to be with you.  You were supposed to be this—this monster, and I would get through it, for Cam, I suppose, and then, eventually, I wouldn’t get through it, and this would all stop.  The ocean was supposed to take me, you see.  I wasn’t supposed to be the one who lived.  What was the point?  I had nothing to return to, no one waiting on me, no life ahead to live, just the next fight.  And then the next.  So, this?  All of this?  It didn’t matter.  Not really.  None of this was supposed to matter.
“No,” Maria cut in.  Peggy’s mouth fell shut and she craned her head away, looking out over the lake.
“---And, ah, we had coffee, and now there's a lawyer going over divorce papers with him and I hate it, I hate it so fucking much, feel free to stop me anytime here, but God, Rhodey, I don't know what I'm doing anymore,” Tony finished in a frustrated rush as he stalked down the sidewalk towards where he'd parked the car in that surreal, pre-box time when things had made some kind of sense.
“Well, I’m betting the letter Dugan received wasn’t quite as sweet as yours,” Bucky pointed out with a sly grin forming as he propped his spear against the tightly-pulled tent wall next to his pallet and unbuckled the metal arm from its shoulder holster, setting it down next to the spear. He unknotted the ties from his leather hauberk and shrugged that off, too, then pulled the undershirt away from his body where it stuck to his skin.
His mind wanted to deny what his eyes were seeing, but he couldn’t. He was in the mountains, that much was obvious, but where?  This place was...what
Steve’s smile widened.  He helped Anto get to righted and got his pack back on properly.  Anto’s hands were shaking. He couldn’t seem to make his body cooperate, and Steve kept touching him, just little, light caresses, but each one filled his head with some kind of warm, happy, dazed feeling, and he couldn’t seem to stop smiling, sometimes letting out a breathy chuckle for no reason, though Steve didn’t seem to mind.  Steve took his amulet from where Anto clutched it in his hand and placed it over Anto’s head, so the round, flat disc hung at the center of Anto’s chest.
“Yeah, help me with him,” he heard Bruce say, but it was distant, like the sound was coming through water.  Steve felt Thor’s arms moving under him, lifting, and then there was a bright, cold flash of pain and his stomach heaved, but there was nothing in it.  He heard someone shouting to turn his head to the side, and he tried to comply, but there was no air that way, there was no air anywhere, and he’d felt this before, except it had been cold then, so very cold, and the air had been freezing and wet and had filled his mouth and nose and pressed on top of his chest until he thought he would burst from it.  Someone was yelling next to his ear, and he gagged as something was shoved in his throat, and reached for it, but his arms were pinned and he couldn’t move, couldn’t get free, and there was no air here.
Finally, Steve pushed the blanket off of him where he must have tangled himself up in it during the night and swung his legs to the side of the bed, planting his feet on the wooden floor beneath him.  Cold air prickled over his sweat-soaked skin, and he looked down, noting the mess over his thighs and stomach.  Maybe he
,” he thought he might come unglued.  Where was the Steve who baited and goaded Tony and made smart aleck remarks that made people blink at him in confusion while they tried to figure out if Captain America just sassed the shit out of them while Tony grinned like a fool?  This Steve…this Steve did everything carefully, controlled in a way that…well, that his Steve…wait, not his Steve--whatever, point was this Steve was wound tighter than a South Beach face-lift.
Stark took a sip of his wine, rolled it around on his tongue for a moment and swallowed, keeping his eyes on Steve.
“Maybe a little,” Steve replied, biting back a grin.  His eyes were doing that soft, crinkly thing that Tony liked so much, which made Tony’s heartrate do that thing he didn’t like so much.  “You figure any of them out yet?”
“I already ate while you were swimming,” Cam replied, turning a large, brown-striped shell over in his hand. “May I go back to the beach and look for more shells to go with this one?”
Seemingly of its own accord, his mind conjured up an elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque dish-putting-away machine that distracted him enough so that he managed not to break anything, and only dropped a fork, which he picked up and stared at guiltily for a few seconds before deciding the five second rule applied to forks and shoving it back in the drawer.
Steve could move fast when he wanted, Tony reminded himself a moment later when his back jarred against the edge of the counter, Steve pressing the length of his body against him, hands wrapped low on Tony’s hips, pulling him against the juncture of Steve’s thighs.  His mind stuttered to a standstill as pleasure and arousal shot through him, chasing away everything that wasn’t Steve’s hands, his mouth slanting over Tony’s, so close, Tony could taste the air of his words.
“What was he thinking?  He knows it’s shallow there.  He knows there are rocks.  I’ve told him a million times. Jarvis, you know I’ve told him.  He knows, he knows, he—” Maria stopped, hand going to her mouth for a moment before she wrapped both arms tightly around her middle and rocked herself slowly, back and forth.
The thing at least had a concrete floor already, so that was something.  He coated it with epoxy, then went to work on the wiring and electrical.  A rotary screw compressor, which he tore apart as soon as it arrived, formed the basis of the fabrication unit.  Sound absorbing panels came next, then a power amplifier and back-up generator, because the cabin’s lights kept flickering, and he’d already blown the microwave’s fuse twice, since that was the only appliance he was using other than the computer.
“I’ve not shared what you told me with anyone save Bruce,” Tony cut in, “but you can’t expect me to simply pretend there is nothing to be gained by learning more about this,” Tony replied softly in answer to Steve’s unspoken question.  “You don’t know what any of this means for you, Steve. How it might affect you. You asked no questions, made no objections, just took whatever some--” he stopped as his voice started to rise, twisting with a frustrated worry that he couldn’t hide.  “I know you wanted only to help your people, but did you ever think of the consequences of any of this? For you? What if it is harming you, even now?”
“Thanks,” Steve said with a slight grimace before shaking his head and looking over at Tony again.  “Hey,” Steve said, drawing Tony’s gaze.  “Thanks, Tony.  Really,” he repeated, though this time, there was a warm, open gratefulness in the tone.
He figured Coulson wouldn’t go for the big ticket items right off the bat, so he started small, with a request for sockets, wiring, compressed air outlets and a set of pneumatic tools.  They arrived, exactly as he’d specified, a few days later.
“No. No, you can’t look at it like that.  One thing and then another, that’s how it has to be.  If you try to think of the whole thing at once, you’ll freak yourself out,” Barnes warned.
“Did you care when you agreed to have me Bonded to someone you’d never even met?” Tony demanded, the words hissing out through his teeth.
“Where would you go?” Steve questioned.  To be fair, Steve sounded genuinely interested, but Tony knew there were right and wrong answers to opinion questions just as much as there were to fact questions, at least if you were an Omega.
“This stuff is terrible for you,” Rhodey argued around a large bite.  “Damn. That’s good.  You should really try this,” Rhodey snorted, then wrapped the burger back up and handed it to Tony.  “Quit stalling.”
His mind flashed to Sugar, worrying that Tony hadn’t eaten enough and if her son would ever settle down.  Charles, with his photograph of his boys and their fishing poles, and wondered if he and David had traced their fingers over Benji’s name on the Wall.  A bittersweet pang of longing twisted in his chest, high and tight, wrapping around his heart and squeezing, hard enough that he screwed his eyes shut for a second, letting it pass.  When he opened them, Steve was watching him. Steve’s eyes dropped down to where Tony’s arm rested on the table next to his half-eaten plate of salad.  Tony followed his line of sight down to the watch, then gave a quick shake of his head.  He wasn’t going to bow out tonight.  He wasn’t sure why he was so determined to stick the landing tonight, but he was.
“You got it paid back?” Tony finally husked out, voice quavering as it rose in question. His hand dropped off the doorknob as he slowly turned around to face Steve. “That's not possible.”
He sat up, or tried to.  The heavy blanket-like...thing...covering him held him down by some unseen force, like a hand gently pressing down.  Frustrated, Tony twisted his head from side to side to try to see his surroundings, but the blanket stuff--some gel-like pinkish substance that emitted a soft glow and looked like it should be sticky, but instead felt velvety soft and pleasantly warm--formed some kind of hood over his head, blocking his view.  He looked down towards the end of the table he was on and caught sight of a large window opened onto a smattering of stars around a sun that was instantly recognizable as not his own.
“Okay?” Tony repeated.  Rogers pushed the chair back and stood up, pulling at the bottom of his dress uniform jacket, which made the medals shake across his chest.  “So, that’s it.  Just like that.  We’re…you’re…and I’m…”
.  That other thing that loomed at the edge of dreams he couldn’t remember.  Too soon.  That had been his first thought when he got the cryptic message.  It was too soon. They weren’t ready.  Not even close to it.  Too fractured, too angry, too far apart, too--
Seven thousand, though.  Seven thousand.  Tony hadn’t even blinked.  And all in under a week.  Bonus points for getting to keep his clothes on, Steve thought with a slight grimace.  They could finally start to move on, to get back to whatever it was their lives were supposed to be that had gotten so derailed he could hardly recognize things anymore.  Sometimes, it was like he was living someone else’s life and just didn’t know how to stop, and, at some point, he knew, there wasn’t going to be a way back to whatever was left.  Lines drawn in the sand, he thought out of nowhere, then shook his head and tried to wet his suddenly dry mouth.  Everything had been day to day for so long.  Looking at a future that had an actual start date on it was…well, it was something they hadn’t had for a long time.  He could do just about anything for that chance.
Small ripples lapped at the shore, and the sea stretched out towards an endless horizon.  Nothing moved out there except waves and the occasional bird.. No telltale puffs of sails, at least.  He hadn’t seen a single ship since he woke up here, which meant wherever this was, it was pretty far off the usual trade routes and even out of the way of the less reputable crews, which, Steve supposed, was good if you were something like the creature and wanted to avoid much contact with the human world, as it seemed wont to do.  Not that Steve could blame it. Humans had, in Peggy’s terms, rather mucked it up, he could admit.
