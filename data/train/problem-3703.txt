"If you don't want it, Daisy will gladly have it," the man says without looking up from a newspaper he's reading. As if to agree, the dog barks once. It's nothing like her previous vicious barks, she looks relaxed, tongue lolling out the side of her mouth and tail wriggling.
Cas makes a face like it hurts him to hear that. Dean has come clean to him about his homelessness earlier tonight. He didn't want to feel like he had to hide it, or to dread Cas' rejection when he'd found out, so he told him everything. There was never any pity in Cas' gaze, just sadness and compassion, just like now.
Dean moans in frustration and lets himself fall back to his side of the bed, dramatically pushing Cas' face away with one hand. Cas chuckles, lightly biting the fingers on his face until Dean takes them away.
In about two hours, he’s discovered that he had a son, just to lose him almost immediately. He had gotten Castiel back and now...now he’s probably lost him again. The simple idea that he could have lost Sam too...He can’t calm down, can’t bury it. Not this time. Not right now.
“Yeah I do. You told me that whole story about your brother and I’ve told you nearly zero personal things about me yet,” Dean argues. “Plus your whole family history is on every time I turn on my TV these days, so it kinda feels unbalanced.”
Castiel is sitting on the dock, leaning back on his hands, his legs dangling in the lake water as he enjoys the tingling sensation of the sun on his skin. A little farther in the water, he can hear Charlie and Jo giggling as they splash each other.
He scratches the hair behind Cas' neck, enjoying the way the other man shivers in response. Encouraged by that response, he slips his hands into the back of his hair, massaging his scalp. He's wanted to do that for so long. Just, mess up those hair even more. He pulls on a tuft of hair behind Cas' ear and the other man's breath itches, bringing Dean's attention to his mouth.
************
Dean looks down at the guy, still wondering why there is a damn hippie (with a cute butt) lying on his kitchen floor. At least this time the guy is wearing clothes, even if his white t-shirt has ridden up, letting Dean see a trail of light hair that disappears under jeans that are barely covering his hips. The guy pushes a little more under the sink and his jeans ride lower, showing off the edge of what looks like pale blue lace.
When Cas finally dares to turn back toward Dean, the hunter has overturned the small table with the spell ingredients, as well as broken what was probably a chair. His brow is furrowed and his fists squeezed so hard it makes his hands white by his side as he stands there, surrounded by broken things. Cas tilts his hand in worry when he notices the blood dripping from his fist. Dean must have hurt himself during his fit of rage.
“No. No, I did not realize that. Give me a minute,” Dean says. “SAM!”
“Sam thinks we can use the bunker’s detection system, he just doesn’t know how to make it work yet.”
“After all I’ve done for you, you betray me like that,” Charlie says, acting dramatically over offended. Castiel just smirks at her. She immediately points at Dean accusingly. “You’re a bad influence on him, boy.” Cas tilts his head on the side, wondering if that was supposed to be an imitation of Jody because that sounded exactly like her. “Now you better make it up to me,” Charlie declares, playing miffed.
"Come on, Jacky-bear, come say hello to Aunty Shirley," she calls with a grin exposing huge teeth.
Castiel squints at him like he's wondering if that means Dean is gonna rob him for a moment, before he hands him a wad of cash.
“Do I need to look at more photos?”
He’s watched Dean for four days. He’s seen who that man is, and he’s neither stupid, nor dishonest, nor a coward. Yet something scared him. Whatever he discovered was enough to make him give up on what he called his dream job just a few days ago.
"Yes," Dean breathes. "Yes!" he says louder when Cas starts to slowly push in. He's not even inside to the second knuckle before Dean is panting. It doesn't hurt, Cas is being careful enough to slowly thrust his finger, pushing increasingly deeper and deeper. It doesn't hurt, but it still feels like an intrusion, like this finger is never going to fit in there, let alone anything else. He can feel his body pushing against it, but also clenching desperately for it when Cas slips out. Dean's whole focus is on those sensations, barely able to feel it as Cas strokes his dick.
Dean is holding Jimmy in a baby carrier on his front. He has a paint brush covered in green paint in one hand, wall half painted in front of him. On his chest, Jimmy is waving happily a much smaller paint brush. Despite the fact that Jimmy’s brush is devoid of paint (thank God), they’re still both covered in more paint that is probably advised. It doesn’t take Cas long to notice the small handprints on the freshly painted wall and to understand why his son looks like a tiny Hulk right now. He frowns his disapproval, but can’t retain a smile in front of Dean's sheepish look.
He only realizes he's thrown his head back when Cas' lips latched onto the skin just under his Adam's apple. Cas' hand is still stroking his dick between them, harder and harder. Dean's never felt like this before. He's thrashing, moving his hips frantically on Cas' lap and dick, searching for a high that is still just this side of not enough. He's grabbing the edge of the tub so hard his fingers are cramping, but still he uses the pressure to help him move, to fight against the weight of the water and bubbles trying to lift him away from Cas.
"What was that?!" he asks, not quite yelling. He starts pacing, rubbing a hand through his already pretty ruffled hair.
*****
What a strange and fascinating human being, Castiel reflects, sipping his coffee as he observes Winchester.
Sam is telling Cas how he missed him and how he still doesn’t understand why he left, reassuring him that he always has a place by their side and...yeah, Dean really needs to explain everything.
“You asked me to let you apologize…” Cas says, a teasing glint in his eyes despite the previous tension.
Dean can't help himself, he grabs the back of his head to pull him forward for a kiss. He strokes his own cock a few times, spreading a generous amount of lube, as they breathe against each other's mouth, too taken by desire to do more than that. Dean breaks the kiss, leaning his forehead against the other man's.
“Okay,” Dean seems to decide, with a nonchalant shrug.
"See something you like?" Bobby asks, mefiant, when he notices Dean looking around.
"Look, Dean, I've found a stick!!" Jack announces excitedly, nearly hitting Dean in the face with it when Dean squat down to greet the three years old boy.
“It’s
"Oh don't worry, I'll find you some work."
(See the end of the chapter for
He focuses on showing Jimmy how to paint the other wall with his blank brush while Dean sends him quick sideway looks, looking agitated.
Dean takes his time anyway, sucking a mark on the taut skin of Cas' stomach, mouth following that damn happy trail that has been driving him crazy for so long. He noses at the band of the panties, trailing small kisses along it until he can bite at the sharp edge of Cas' left hip.
The view would be the hottest thing Dean has ever seen if Cas wasn't also fast asleep and drooling on Dean's pillow.
The girls giggle, making Cas jump a little, blushing and turning away from their long stare exchange. He tries to get up, but a hand on his shoulder stops him. He shivers when he feels Dean’s breath on the shell of his ear.
“It’s a bust so far. Where’s Cas?”
“To Dean,” Sam deducts with a frown that Dean doesn’t like.
He doesn't know what to do anymore.
It took Castiel ten months with Jody before he stopped being scared of what would happen if he stopped shaving. When he finally tried, all that Jody did was hug him really tight. Now the tables have turned, and he throws a fit every time she pesters him to get a haircut.
"Hey, what's up buddy?" he says, grimacing when he can feel Jack's wet face and snotty nose against the collar of his suit jacket. There goes the nice suit....
Cas sighs like it's breaking his heart to say what he's going to say next. "No one is going to come tomorrow."
Most of all, it's the realization that he could have died that first night at the salvage yard that makes his belly hitches with a new sob. He could have died miserable, and alone, and thinking he wasn't worth shit, when really, two of the most amazing men he's ever met were waiting for him to find his way back to them.
"Are you sure you don't want me to stay?" Castiel asks, brows creased in what look like genuine worry. "I don't like the idea of leaving you here alone, especially if you're not well."
“Huh. Yeah. I’ve talked to her once or twice," Sam answers, squirming in his seat.
Dean takes a look at his wristwatch. It's not even ten in the evening yet. God, they're old.
“I don’t drink alcohol.”
"About your new pet," Lucifer spits, his tone as viscous as the glare he puts on Dean.
"The heart wants what it wants," she says with a resigned roll of her eyes.
Next chapter's title: The truth about Castiel Mills
“Why would you do that?” Dean asks. He doesn’t wait for an answer though and starts gulping back the rest of his beer before throwing it in the bin and opening the fridge. “Is Sprite okay?”
"What are you doing here?"
"So the rumor was true then, you really did pick up a stray," one of the men greets them.
He counts to three and literally rips himself from Cas, rolling to the side. He probably should have assessed the situation a little better, because he hadn't realized he was that close to the edge of a bed.
“It wasn’t just a handprint, Dean. I know you can’t see it, but it left a permanent imprint on your soul as well as my Grace.”
He’s interrupted by Sam running straight to the front door, barely stopping as he runs outside screaming “shotgun!”. Castiel has no idea what that means.
"The bill? I'm not a freaking toddler, Benny! It's my money!"
“I don’t want us to kiss,” Cas decides. He doesn’t like to do things that he doesn’t know how to do well. Best to avoid that.
Thankfully, Castiel knows numbers. He knows how to make them reveal all their secrets and he will definitely get to the bottom of that mystery.
“Go on then. And you better not touch my beer. I may be older and fatter than you, but I can still kick your ass.”
They stay like this for a moment, just lying down facing each other and exploring the other's face with their eyes. Cas really has a nice one, and Dean takes the opportunity to watch his fill. There are just far enough that they're not touching, but close enough for him to see the fine lines in the corners of Cas' eyes and that one little speck a shade darker into his left pupil.
He bites his lips, too close to revealing the real story about Castiel and him. Dean may not want to hide who he is anymore, but he doesn't plan on causing problems for Cas by confessing to the whole deception. It's not his story to tell.
“Fast, but not too fast, I don’t think,” Charlie says, sounding uncertain as she squeezes his wrist. “We should call Jody.”
make a few hundred bucks off the back of those rich assholes.
When he looks up, his eyes immediately meet Dean’s. The light is low because they closed the drapes, and he regrets not being able to see the color of Dean’s eyes properly. He has such nice eyes.
I'm sorry about the cliffhanger, although I admit that your comments made me cackle with sadistic glee.
Dean is so taken by his contemplation, that he startles when Cas grabs one of his hands. He can only blink dumbly as the man brings it behind himself until Dean's finger brushes the wet warmth behind him. Dean inhales deeply, observing the invitation in Cas' eyes before he presses his finger harder, dipping just inside.
"You should know that someone laughing while looking at your naked body is not exactly a confidence boost," Castiel remarks dryly.
“Fuck!” Dean exclaims, getting up. “You, look after him for a minute. Anything happens to him and I’ll find you and kick your ass, you hear me?” he threatens a skinny guy who nods, looking terrified. Dean runs back into the house.
“You’re a free man and an adult, Cas, you don’t have to ask my permission.” He didn’t mean it to sound so harsh but his bitterness at the situation bleeds into his tone.
“I thought the angels left, like, a year ago.”
Dean's heart is suddenly in his throat. He can't help but look around, a little frantic to notice that more than one other pair of eyes are admiring Cas too. Dean can't help but tense up. It's not so much jealousy...Okay, not
It's so boring that Dean is nearly grateful to Naomi when she finally puts a stop to it. "My friends, I think it's time I go introduce this-," she pauses for a thousandth of a second here, "gentleman to the rest of the party. Be sure to try the foie gras toasts, we've just received it directly from le Périgord and it's scrumptious," she adds before dragging Dean toward another group of people. Castiel exchanges Dean's empty glass with a full one just as they reach a group of four people. Dean doesn't know if he should feel thankful or wary that Cas thinks it's necessary right at this moment.
Naomi turns toward him, back as straight as ever. She looks at him from head to toe with the face of a three years old looking at a plate of spinach.
,” Jody assures, “but you need to take it one step at a time, kiddo, you can’t just go all out with this.”
But first, he leans down and takes his first taste of those lips. It's just a kitten lap, just teasing. It makes Cas' grips his hips harder, one thumb sliding under Dean's shirt and making him shiver. He looks up at Cas' eyes and there is not much blue left, dark pleasure having taken over.
They both stay silent for a minute. Dean may have hated it at first, but now he's not eager to quit the warm seat of the Tesla to go sleep on the cold backseat of the Impala. His baby will always be number one in his heart and he still thinks this car is ridiculous, but it's the middle of November already and he's not looking forward to freezing his ass off. Especially after a night spent mingling with High Society. Just thinking of the contrast is giving him whiplash.
"Both of you," Dean admits, the sound of his heart pounding deafening in his ears. He can feel Cas' pulse point under his fingers, can feel how his heart suddenly picks up too and it gives him the confidence to gently tug on Cas' wrist. "Thank you for giving me another chance."
Dean slams the door of the bunker behind him, wincing at the noise. Sam seems agitated, running from the map table to the old fashion equipement near the opposite wall. His laptop is connected to the table by a bunch of cables.
Two fingers slip under the waistband of his sweatpants, pulling on it once as a question. Dean has no idea why he raises his hips in agreement, letting the other man push his pants down and off, leaving him in only a black pair of boxers. He doesn't make it a habit to go to strangers’ houses and let them take his clothes off. Well, not men, at least. And definitely not for massages.
“I talked to Ezekiel,” Cas says, “He told me he was the one who asked you to…” Cas searches for the right words.
"You should be way past a hundred by now."
“Shut up and sleep,” Dean grunts, eyes closed and seeming to have found a somewhat comfortable enough position to sleep on that small chair. It doesn’t look comfortable at all.
He remembers Dean talking on the phone yesterday. Castiel has let the blow to his ego obstruct what Dean had been saying, but Dean checked all the numbers with his providers. He didn’t need to do that. Not unless he noticed something was wrong. Something that he’s scared to talk about to Cas because he doesn’t trust him.
"It's...very sweet of you, Dean. Really, I appreciate all that you've done for Jack."
Even his parents have pretty much disinherited him after the fight he had with them about it.
think it’s time we talk about the way your father had with words.”
Dean snorts, "Please don't remind me of those," Dean grimaces, looking down at his blue jeans and plaid shirt. He's not sure a lot of people would consider it an improvement, but he likes it. It feels like him in a way all those suits and fancy clothes never did.
Dean gulps a little nervously. He’d rather not think too much about what Cas could see. “Let’s do it.”
"Castiel found him," the woman with blond hair tucked into a white bonnet reassures him with a gentle smile, as soon as he gets out of the car.
“Five. Jimmy doesn’t sleep much.”
"Because he still refuses to admit that it's a bad idea!" Michael says, like it makes sense and is not the result of a stubbornness so strong that a whole family ends up freezing their asses off every year for nearly two decades.
Even now, his guts are churning, thinking back on Cas telling him he loves him. What if it's not enough? What if they end up making each other miserable? They're not even together, yet Dean is already thinking about the day he'll irremediably fuck up. What about Jack then? What if Dean has to leave again? What if Cas
"What about your father, couldn't he have cared for his own child?" Lucifer asks. Like always when Lucifer talks, the bluntness of his tone grates on Dean's nerves.
He can get his son back
He ends up moving erratically until Cas' hand grabs his hip and stops him from moving. Cas guides him firmly down, pressing him harder against him until he's sitting directly on Castiel's shaft, the head of it poking the soft spot just behind his balls. He moves his hips forward and back, just a little, and it is suddenly perfect.
The only one missing in those pictures is his mom. Sometimes he thinks that Victor has a picture of her dead body in one of his files and never showed it to him. Cas’s not sure if he wants to know yet, so he doesn’t ask. He knows he will some day, just not today.
Note: this one is really angsty. We dig deep into Dean's self-esteem issues, as well as Cas and Jack's own issues. Brace yourselves and scream at me in the comments if you must.
“You will show me some respect,” Cas affirms, voice firm and so rough it croaks at the end.
Even though he has to admit that it seems to be the only position in which there is no elbow poking his ribs uncomfortably, it’s still highly distressing. Castiel isn’t used to such close proximity. He feels like he can feel Dean’s pulse beating in all the places that they’re touching.
"I'm awesome!" Jack nods with a toothy smile. He lets himself dramatically fall back into the bed, grabbing Bee-Bee and raising his arms in the air so Dean can push up the blankets over him.
"Yeah he is. He reminds me of someone actually," Dean says, passing an arm around Cas' hips and squeezing him closer to his side. "And Claire definitely takes after you," he adds with a smirk.
still owe me the last three months of your rent," his ex landlord says on the phone.
Castiel looks up at him, eyes wide.
Dean closes his eyes and runs to hide in the bathroom, ignoring Cas' confused head tilt.
************
"Hello," Dean says softly in the orange light streaming between the curtains.
WARNING: Smut is coming.
Dean can't help but sigh in relief. The move makes him aware of the fact that his arm is still around Cas' waist, hand comfortably resting on his hip. He takes it off with the pretense of grabbing food from a passing platter. He grabs a nappin and starts loading it.
Along with the Archangels and his Father’s picture, there are other people that he recognizes and fears. He feels a little better when he tries to think of someone else that used to scare him that wouldn’t be in those pictures and can’t. He says exactly that to agent Henrikson. The FBI agent’s eyes are suddenly a little too humid. He pats Castiel’s cheek like he wants to hug him, but doesn’t.
He takes a breath and the next thing he knows, Dean’s lips are on his. Who knew that his lips touching others could feel so intense? He feels warm all over, like there’s a fire burning under his skin, like he’s never needed anything more than he needs Dean’s lips on his right now.
They both laugh a little.
His smile is missing some teeth and digging lopsided dimples in his cheeks. He's wearing the ugliest hat Dean has ever seen, some peruvian monstrosity with what is probably supposed to be a monkey face on it. He has a blue knitted vest over red shorts, and his feet are covered by huge yellow rain plastic boots with multicolor dots on them. He looks about four or five years old and like he dressed himself with the first random things he could find.
The noise of his engine as it starts up when the light turns green seems louder than ever. Cas tenses, worried that he’ll cross paths with police. He feels like a criminal being outside like this, which is all kind of absurd.
When she raises again, she looks like nothing happened. She salutes Dean's neighbor with a charming smile and a suggestive wink, sends a bitter look to Dean and leaves.
"Oh, we will," Dean assures, leering at Cas. He's still wondering about how a guy like Cas could still be a virgin at thirty. Sure Cas had some experiences with blowjobs and probably handstuff, but why nothing else? It can't be because he didn't get the chance. Surely, anyone meeting Cas would want to tap that ass. Hell, Dean was heterosexual and even he did! So how come Cas never had actual penetrative sex before Dean? And most importantly, why would he let a bum like Dean be his first if he was so selective?
Cas recoils. "What?"
"Where is the priiiize?" Jack says excitedly, climbing on Dean until he's seated on his lap.
She puts the cup under his nose and he takes a prudent sniff at it. It doesn’t smell like alcohol, just like basic soda. He ponders for a second while Meg wriggles a little on his lap with a lascivious smile. In the end, any drink seems better than one more second of that, so he takes the cup from her hand. He takes a sip, holding it in his mouth to analyse. It does seem devoid of any alcohol, so he drinks it up.
"What?" Dean asks, dumbfounded.
Castiel looks at Jo and Charlie whispering about the little Spongebobs’ painted on Charlie’s nails. They’re both sitting sideways on the armchair, in reverse so they can face each other. After a while, looking at nails seems to become an excuse to play with each other’s hands.
His whole childhood.
Dean’s soul inflates in remembrance before it starts flying around in urgency.
Furthermore, Meg keeps suggesting to take his virginity, or as she puts it “take away his delicate little flower and turn him into the wild sex lion that she knows he is”. That sentence doesn’t make any sense to him, but he feels like he should avoid
"Yeah, fine," Cas waves it off. "Rough day." He looks like he shakes himself, that fake grin coming back on. "But you two look like you're going to have a nice evening," he adds. "Hi, I'm Castiel."
"Of course, you idjit," Bobby says, like just thinking the idea of not being in Dean's life anymore is absurd. There's something soft in his eyes, something that Dean has searched for in John's eyes for years and isn't quite ready to confront now, so he drops his own gaze. "And don't believe I won't ride your boyfriend's ass if he turns out to be a rightist, too."
Dean blushes, self-consciously scratching at the mark Cas has left on his neck while Castiel squirms beside him. They’re all in the sitting room, waiting for lunch to be served and now everyone is, more or less discreetly, trying to take a peek at his throat.
"What? Eh no, it's not pathetic. Surprising, yeah. But, to each their own, you know?"
: Dean Winchester. Just thinking it gives him a rush and makes him feel like the luckiest bastard alive.
Castiel looks like he's second guessing this whole deal. Dean wonders if there is a 'throw the passenger out' option on the Tesla. If so, he's fucked.
your kid," Dean adds with a pointed finger, like it's a solid argument and not insanity.
“You,” Cas’ spits toward the ground. In the next second, he’s appeared on the other side of the room, grabbing Sam by the throat and slamming him against the wall. He keeps him there, the hunter’s feet dangling above the ground as he struggles uselessly against the hold pressing on his trachea. “You were supposed to ward this place! Jimmy was supposed to be safe here!” Cas yells, face contorted by fury.
“Cas!” Dean screams, rushing to their side. He grabs Cas’ arm, pulling to try and make him release his brother.
"There's a prize?!!"
Cas stares at him some more, chewing on his lips. He takes a few steps, looking around his living room.
One of the dogs barks again, jumping a step forward and clacking his teeth, making Dean bumps back against the car. He gulps, looking from the beast to the way he just came from.
"Eh, I read," Dean mutters to himself. He's not surprised when he's ignored.
“Naomi won’t agree with this,” Rariel notes, still looking worried.
“Not really.”
"Mother, let me introduce you to my boyfriend," Castiel says, looking ill at ease. He's obviously not a very good liar.
"That's my point, you have no idea. For all you know, I could be a psychopedo or something."
“Why didn’t you bring him back to Heaven then?”
"I'm sorry for the way my mother behaved toward you. I assure you, being yourself will be amply sufficient to the task."
Sam just glares at him in answer, obviously as lost as him.
How could Dean ever be a good father when he only ever had shitty ones? His first one didn't give a shit about him. His adoptive one didn't give a shit about who he was. He ended up disappointing both of them. He was as awful a son as he would be as a father. Even a stepfather.
"Damn right I wish!" Dean says, hugging the basket to his chest. There are some weird things in there like some moldy looking cheese, and overly complicated chocolates. He can't wait to try it all. It probably tastes disgusting, but he's still gonna eat it all, just because he can.
“I’m doing what now? How can you even tell?”
Once he had decided that he wanted to have intercourse, Dean Winchester seemed like the obvious choice.
He went to buy a freaking americano and three weeks later he's in bed with a guy and questioning his whole sexuality.
Claire stares at him for a moment, her brows so furrowed it's crushing up her whole features. Finally she bats her arms dramatically. "Alright!" she declared. She drags her feet a few steps to show her disapprobation before she obviously can't keep the excitement down anymore and starts running toward the nursery.
He gulps, takes a deep breath and slides forward until he's kneeling right in front of Castiel. He didn't think those blue eyes could get any wider, yet here they are, nearly bulging out. It would be funny if Dean's heart wasn't panicking in his chest too.
"Mother told me she came to see you, and...I couldn't stand to wait any longer," he admits. "I don't mean to rush you or force your hand," he makes clear, "I just...I wanted to see you. I needed to know if I'm ever going to see you again or-or not," he finishes, hanging his head.
"I wanna be a knight when I grow up"
"You're welcome to keep it all if you wish."
“Of course. You can always talk to me, Dean. All I wanted was for you to know that,” Castiel says sincerely.
Not knowing what else to do, he walks along the edge of the wire mesh, trying to look through it for a peek of his Baby. He's halfway around the property, burried ankles deep in snow and mud when he finally sees her. It immediately appeases something deep inside him. It only lasts for a second though, before it's replaced by fear. He was so focused on finding his car that he didn't allow himself to think this through.
"I told you to-"
A silence follows his statement.
Dean raises his head, ready to bitch. This leads him to notice that he is indeed sprawled in diagonal over the bed. He sighs and rolls as well as he can with minimal effort until he's more or less on his side of the bed.
“Of course, I’m not, Cas,” Dean groans. “You’ve got to stop it with the mother hen act,” the human reproaches, resolutely looking at the wall as Cas glares at the back of his head. They’ve had this discussion many times already. Dean thinks Cas is overprotective, Cas thinks Dean tends to be reckless with Jimmy’s safety. Again: their son swallowed a
An hour later, when Winchester gets what Castiel thinks is supposed to be a pie out of the oven, he looks very disappointed by the end result. He spends a long time looking from the gelatinous looking mass in his dish to the computer screen, scratching his head.
When Dean looks up, Cas is gloriously naked with the exception of his tie. It should look ridiculous, yet it's the sexiest thing Dean has ever seen. Their eyes meet, blue hooded with so much desire it makes Dean shivers in anticipation. He continues to stare at Castiel as he circles a hand over the base of his shaft, captivated by Cas' reaction as he starts to slowly stroke up and down. He passes a thumb over the head, pressing a little over the slit and Cas bites his lip. Dean feels wet heat over the pad of his finger and he can't help his eyes from sliding along Cas' torso, down to the member right in front of him. He doesn't hesitate, poking his tongue out to gather the little pearl of precome. Cas' moan is everything Dean ever wants to hear. So he does it again, tongue pushing at the slit, then rolling around the head and pressing just under it. He opens his mouth wider and let's his tongue slide against the vein under Cas' cock as he takes it into his mouth for the first time. He can't take much of it in, so he covers the base with his hand, holding the shaft steady as he experiments with moving a little forward and backward.
Things between Cas and him are still a little awkward. Dean can feel that there are some things they need to talk about, but has no idea what he should or want to say about them. They've fallen back into their habit of taking a moment outside after Jack goes to bed. It's mid-February now, so they don't linger outside for too long, hiding from the rain under Dean's porch as Cas smokes his evening joint. They don't talk much, just take a moment to breathe out the stress of the day together.
"My mom is dead and my dad is in prison. Where are yours?"
“I was homeless, Dean. For eight months, I didn’t have a home or money and I certainly didn’t have anyone I could count on. No
He stops when he sees Dean looking at him like he’s grown another head. He self-consciously touches his hair, but no, nothing weird there, just hair.
His right hand slides a little further up his torso. He shivers when the move brings his t-shirt up, the cold air hitting the soft skin of his stomach, bringing goosebumps to his skin. He lazily passes a finger over his nipple, a slight pinch making him groan again. He raises his hip a little, his morning wood brushing against the soft fabrics of his underwear. He does it a few more times, pulling at his hair a little in counterpart.
“No wait-” Dean groans again because Cas has already disappeared. God, Dean didn’t miss all the zapping around. “It’s five am, I’m not getting up,” the hunter announces to the baby sitting beside him. Jimmy seems to understand because he lies down next to him.
“I know,” Dean relents. “You should do it.”
When Cas looks up at Dean, the jock beams at him, before putting the bowl of chips under his nose. Castiel can’t help but smile shyly back, because that guy sure is enticing. He starts relaxing a little more, only jumping when the Singer family’s howling at the screen gets really loud. Now he knows who Jo takes her foul language from, he reflects, gazing wide eyed at Bobby after a particularly vitriolic comment.
"Oh yeah, keep talking dirty to me," Cas intices, rolling on his side and sliding closer to Dean, one leg covering his.
Please feel free to tell me what you feel about this chapter in the comments. Or scream at me.
“It’s okay, Cas, you can stay as long as you need to,” Dean promises, grabbing the sock that the kid once again managed to take off and stuff in his mouth.
In the end, they chose the second outfit. Dean gets the job. Castiel starts regretting it when that means they don't have as much time to spend together anymore. Between taking care of Sam, school and his job, Dean always seems busy.
The man himself suddenly pokes his head back through it, raising an eyebrow at Dean. "Are you coming?"
*************
A plate with a huge burger is put in front of her, and Jody’s smile grows larger, radiant. Cas has never seen her like this. She moved her whole life away from everyone she has ever known for him. She’s never happy anymore.
For now, his finger slides a little to the right and clicks the F1 button to mute the rest of the conversation. He needs a break.
"No."
*Run away before you all start throwing rocks at me for that ending*
Next to the TV, there’s a photo of two little boys and what looks like Dean’s dad. He’s older and has a beard, but it’s definitely him. Dean is hugging Sam from behind and they’re both laughing at the camera. Dean must be around 8 or 9 and Sam is still a toddler.
“Are you?” Cas asks, head inclined as he observes him.
Dean glares at her, raising up to his feet and collecting the trash from the coffee table. He hopes him leaving the room will be enough to cut this conversation short, but Charlie follows him, counting on her fingers.
Dean can't help but smile at the grumpy old man routine. At least, he's not alone anymore. He's got this old grunt in his life now.
Dean shrugs, "No pressure, I-I kinda just want to see what will happen if you do."
Next chapter on Saturday: 'Bees are smarter than men'
It's twenty minutes and three videos later when Castiel appears in his kitchen, nearly making Dean bump his head again. He's going to buy that damn family a couple collars with bells on it, he swears.
“Stop moving so much, I’m trying to get a good shot,” Jo responds, sounding breathless from laughter. Cas still can’t see anything. His arms are pinned between a squirming mass and the edge of the tub.
Cas is not sure which one he prefers, which story is the most beautiful. He wishes he didn't have to choose.
************
For the first time since he was five and got severely chastised for it, Castiel feels the urge to stick his tongue out to someone. So he does. Dean's laugh feels very satisfying.
When they arrive in the living room, Bobby and Sammy are on the couch while Jo and Charlie are squeezed on one of the armchairs, a fact that Charlie seems really happy about. One armchair is left.
“I think I like him,” Castiel admits, trying to revert back to their previous conversation.
“I do like you, Cas. More than you could ever know. I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to be brave enough to admit it.”
“Sorry,” Cas apologizes.
“I just wanted to talk about Dean,” Cas implores, sniffing.
“Hello Mr Singer. My name is Castiel, I’m one of your daughter’s fellow high schoolers.”
Be there on Wednesday for chapter 11: 'And then they were roomates!'
Castiel and Jack have always felt right. They've always felt like family.
“No way, Sam. After what he did to you?”
"Huh. Tada?" Dean says with a grimace. "It was supposed to be a surprise! Jack isn't here, is he?"
"You alright?"
It stops Cas for a second, makes him close his eyes and takes a deep breath that can't quite pass the ball of lies that is stuck in his throat. Two years now, and he still chokes on them sometimes. Still spend sleepless nights thinking of all that he's lost.
He, Sam and Castiel, that’s the dream. That’s everything he’s ever wanted.
His answer comes in the form of a literal horde invading his lawn the next day. They are about thirty people dressed up in middle ages attire. Jack's eyes when he takes a look into the garden bulge out and he lets out a happy scream that manages to make everyone shuts up for a second before they answer with a roar of 'Happy Birthday!', raising fake swords and axes in the air.
Something tries to push him away and he feels himself floating away, he feels himself being nothing again. Panic rises again. When the presence brushes him again, Dean grabs onto it in desperation, grabs so hard that he can feel himself pouring into the ethereal being surrounding him. It squirms to get away, but Dean is terrified, he can’t let go, he can’t let the only thing making him feel alive get away. So he grows, he grows around that reassuring wave until he’s all around it, and he squeezes and presses until he is entirely surrounding it. He feels a crack open up under the pressure, and he rushes to fill it, to get inside. To get to safety.
Teenagers seem to put a lot of importance on other students’ sexual life.  Castiel can’t say he cares about it at all, like most of most teenagers’ interests. The only reason he’s even entertaining the idea of losing his virginity is because it seems to be a rite of passage for people his age. He might at well get rid of it right away.
"Isn't that what you're doing? What you're
"You know what, you just saved me from having to drag them back screaming and kicking. I bought them a new board game to play tonight, how about you offer it to them?"
"You don't look so good either. Does
"It's no mystery that I love you."
want a relationship with him," Charlie exclaims, pointing a finger under his nose.
“I was pooping, Cas.
“Nothing, Sammy. Don’t worry. Go back to sleep, I’ll explain tomorrow.” Dean’s voice is affectionate, but still sounds like an order.
Dean grunts when Cas sits on the side of the bed to take off his shoes. It makes the mattress move and brush against his swollen stomach. Why is he still wearing pants anyway? He slides a hand under himself to undo the buttons on his jeans and groans in relief when the pressure on his stomach is finally released. He starts squirming to try and shimmy out of his pants altogether.
“Huh, what are you doing?” Dean asks, rubbing the back of his neck.
Dean should probably keep his noises in check, because the one he makes at this is nearly indecent. The half mast he's sporting is embarrassing enough, he doesn't need to both look
He looks around and realizes that he shouldn't be surprised. This house looks straight out of the nineties, with orange flowery wallpaper, a mint colored formica kitchen and a catodic television in the living room. The couch Dean slept on is probably older than him and there are piles of yellowed books everywhere.
The smell of bacon immediately perks him up when he enters the house. This time, he sits with no hesitation and starts shoveling food into his mouth. Bobby doesn't even look up from his newspaper. Dean wonders if it's the same one as last night. There's no way a new one was delivered this morning in that snow. Who reads the newspaper nowadays anyway?
Dean pauses when he notices the metal gate of the Salvage Yard is closed. He pushes on his frozen tiptoes to peak above it. All the lights in the main house a little further up are turned off.
They actually catch a case while they're just starting on painting the bedroom. Cas promises them that it's okay, that he could finish it and that he's perfectly capable of mounting the bedframe alone. As he leaves, Dean is pretty sure that they will come back to a completely destroyed piece of furniture and a few bandages on his friend’s hands from the fight with that Ikea’s nightmare. They go anyway.
Does he even want that?
"Sorry about your suit," he says with a grimace as he pushes Daisy with his foot so she stays outside.
"No it's not!"
He barely has time to see the satisfied smile stretching Cas' lips before they're stretching around his length. Dean throws his head back, fisting the sheets to stop himself from thrusting up. As if sensing the urge, Cas' hands pin his hips down against the mattress. He mouths at Dean's cock, waiting patiently for Dean to look down at him before he swallows him whole in one go.
It's tight, tighter than he was expecting, and yet he feels Cas body squeezing and sucking his finger deeper in. He resists the pull for a second, playing with the rim instead, testing the looseness of it as well as Cas' reaction when he does. The way the other man's eyebrows twitches, nearly a frown, or how Cas bites his lips, making them redder and redder. The invitation is too enticing and Dean catches Cas' bottom lip between his just as his finger pushes deeper inside. He swallows Cas' pants as his finger starts to move faster and faster, soon joined by another one.
You’re the way we’re gonna find Jimmy,” Cas realizes, his Grace pouring itself into Dean’s soul as it reminds him of the son he misses so much. “That’s how he found you. That’s why he always comes to you.”
Once again, he hasn't seen him coming and he jumps at the sound of his voice. At least this time, the guy doesn’t invite himself inside his house. Dean has just spent the afternoon mowing and tending to his front lawn. Now the sun is setting on the horizon. He's stiff and sunburnt and not in the mood to entertain his crazy neighbor.
“Not always, but sometimes I think I should,” Cas reflects, “Charlie does it too, but she’s always scared to push too hard. Jo doesn’t give a fuck.”
I know that they should both be wearing masks. Although I wrote this story while I was in quarantine myself and at the time (May 2020) everyone was saying that masks were useless, so it’s actually more realistic for them not to be wearing them at that point of the story. Plus, it's an AU and not really covid so I do what I want :-p
“What? How?” Dean exclaims, astounded.
Cas bites the other man's chin, before trailing kisses along his jaw and toward his ear. "Good thing there’s a thing or two I'm good at, or you would have never married me."
This time, he's not missing his chance and he's not giving up without a fight.
Dean nibbles on his bottom lip for a second, looking at the antiquated garage around him. "I'll take it anyway," he affirms, sliding back under the car.
“Get off me, Meg,” Cas warns.
“I’ll help you anyway I can,” Arariel adds.
Castiel Mills, resident weirdo of Lawrence High is going to have sex with the most popular and attractive guy in his school. It may be a very superficial thought, but Cas feel his chest puff out in pride all the way home anyway.
Dean hesitates. He's imagined that moment a thousand times already, yet he can't find anything to say. He wants to fall to his knees and beg. Or run away before Cas manages to hurt him even more than he did before. No one had ever hurt him like that.
************
"You're looking good, brother," Benny greets him when he enters the bar. Dean must certainly look better than the last time Benny saw him, since he happened to
"I just... I needed something from in there."
“Yeah. Sure,” Dean mumbles, rummaging in the fridge, voluntarily clinking the beers together, hoping that he’ll have an excuse for not hearing what may come next.
"Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence."
"Not-," Castiel clears his throat, "-not long."
It's probably an understatement. Naomi looks like she's worried just sitting here is giving her some kind of disease. He'd bet his Baby that she's not gonna touch her coffee. He still puts a cupful in front of her, before sitting on the other side of the table.
So, that’s not a lie.
“Yeah, I’ve noticed,” Dean answers, yawning.
"You said he was a pompous ass!"
Cas nods. "It looks like it's gonna be your problem too now."
“So. You’re sleeping with Dean, huh,” she states, as soon as Charlie finishes her story.
By the time Dean finishes mending the fences, he's exhausted and everything hurts. It's a good kind of hurt though, the kind that comes from hard work. He fixed the hole he made, and then saw other weaknesses in the mesh as he was walking back, so he fixed those too. He ended up checking the whole fence surrounding the property, making sure everything was solidly in place and fixing the parts that weren't. The place would probably be safer with a few motion triggered lamps, which he is now telling Bobby around dinner. The dogs are good, but not infallible, especially to cover such a large area. The lamps would also help the dogs spot intruders.
“Yeah, but remember how the collar was shining? It’s blocking his powers, keeping them contained, but Jimmy is still producing energy so we might be able to detect it,” Sam explains.
“No, Cas, that’s not fair and you know-”
Claire sends him a dubious look, clearly still unhappy about him taking her stick. Jack, though, literally jumps to his feet, looking ready to sprint away to find a new one.
They need to get to him. They need to…
“Why can’t I just talk about Dean?”
"Well, not
"You were the one to push it so far in the first place," Castiel reminds. Accuses, really.
"I wonder this every single day," Castiel sighs, miming despair despite the amused smile at the corner of his lips.
"You coming or you need a special invitation, princess?" the man calls over his shoulders.
“Is...Is he…”
"There's a key badly hidden under the pot plant."
Or not. Maybe he hasn’t even heard Dean. Or doesn’t care. Yeah, it’s probably that. Why would he, right? He probably has tons of more important stuff to think about than Dean and his blurb. Like pancakes for lunch.
"They just fed me a whole jar of olives, I think my stomach needs a break," Dean complains, pushing a little against Cas' hand when it looks like he's going to stop his caress. To be honest, he was probably picking bits of food out of it more than caressing his hair, but still, it felt good. Cas rolls his eyes fondly, eating from his plate with one hand while he continues to play with Dean's hair with the other.
"You think he'll ever come back for Jack?"
"I want to
“Rock, paper, scissors?” Sam asks with a reluctant grimace.
“I hope you eat meat, because ain’t no tofu gonna be touching my barbecue,” Bobby announces.
okay. His stomach has been crying for food since last morning, and he's what? Supposed to help this stranger by saying no to free lunch at one of the most prestigious restaurants in town? Fuck no. He's gonna eat like a king
The sky is a little cloudy, but there is no wind, so they warm up easily by walking. Castiel has been talking to Michael for a while, staying a little behind Dean, Gabriel, and the kids. Anael and Lilith are chatting with Gadreel, Hannah has stayed home for the day again. Lucifer and Naomi are leading the way.
"Then sell it."
Cas’ avoids her eyes, jaw working with anger. She seems to take it as an answer.
It always confused him. He understood that his Father favored the children in his image, but why wait until their puberty to see what color their hair was? He asked his mom once.
but about resigning or maybe changing departments. Chuck wouldn’t hear about it. After all, it’s not like he even gave Cas any choice at all about taking that job in the first place.
“Stop torturing Cas and go take your shower, Sammy, ” Dean scolds, barging into the room and slapping the kid with a towel until Sam runs away. Dean gives a towel smack right on Cas’ blanket covered ass too before he goes. “Move your ass too and come eat breakfast, Aurora.”
He jumps when Pamela touches his arm, and looks at her with round eyes. She draws Castiel’s hand back from his head. When he looks down there’s a tuft of hair in his hand.
Wait. Heart??
“Yes.” Castiel beams, happy that Dean listened to him. It happens way less than it should with other people.
“Oh my god, have you been looking up every nonsense word he’s said so far to try and find one that means something?”
“Well, you choose the best day to come back! I brought us premium meat for tonight and some cherry pie. And not some gas station’s cherry pie. Pie from an actual
“How did you..." Dean asks, eyebrows to his hairline and baffled.
He's not eager to find out.
"Only four years but-," Dean looks down at his plate. He's not ashamed of his past, he's just not sure if sharing it with this crowd is a good idea. It's Castiel's hand squeezing his thigh that convinces him. Those people have opened their house and family to him, the least he could do is share some of his history too. "My mom died when he was still a baby, and I had to care for him."
He blinks out of those somber plans when Dean scratches his throat.
As expected, he really likes the flea markets and buys tons of miscellaneous ugly things that he doesn’t need. Why buying a figurine of a garden gnome playing guitar is an an obvious choice to him, but choosing a mattress and a bed frame at Ikea takes him two hours and twenty six minutes is a mystery to Dean, but he’s glad he was there to see it...even if those two hours and twenty six minutes seemed like the longest of his life.
"You don't know what you're getting into," Dean says, sucking a bruise at the cord of Cas' neck. The other man pushes back his head, giving him better access.
“You stop right now,” Jody orders, jaw clenched. “That’s not what I’m saying, and you know it.”
Bobby doesn’t say anything else, just turn around and leave.
"It was awesome," Dean says dreamily into his pillow.
“He’s a very peculiar man,” Cas remarks out loud.
“What the hell, Dean?” Sam asks later in the car, looking at the case file that Dean has printed. “This isn’t an emergency, it could have waited a few hours.”
“Stop screaming,” Cas moans, as someone wipes at his mouth with something. It’s not clear who, because he can’t open his eyes anymore.
People should know that his mother isn’t a monster, that he and his twin brother were just normal kids. The circumstances they grew up in were strange, but
She suddenly screams and jumps off him when Jo pours her entire glass of coke right into Meg’s low neck top. As soon as she’s up, Cas pushes his chair as close to the table as possible so she can’t sit back. Thankfully she seems more concerned with her drenched top.
"You cook?" Dean asks, dubious.
"You're not a stranger, you're my neighbor."
He doesn't regret going for a walk though. The lake is gorgeous and the forest all around it magnificent. Dean's been following a path along the edge of the water for half an hour now, so amazed by the beauty of it all that he has nearly forgotten about Castiel and his pompous family. The sound of the wind blowing through the tree, making leaves dance in the air around him is broken by the sound of children laughing, picking Dean's curiosity.
"Is that what you were thinking about?" Dean asks, searching his eyes.
"No it's not," the five years old little girl declares proudly. Jack looks like he's going to bawl his eyes out. Dean sends a look to Hannah who just rolls her eyes in exasperation, visibly used to her daughter's bitchy antics.
“Okay, first, I’m the Sheriff of this damn town so don’t even joke about that. Second, do you think I’m an idiot? I know what you’re doing,” she accused Cas. “You’re going to that party whether you like it or not,” she declares.
"Yes, yes, yes," Claire answers while jumping up and down in his lap. "Thank you, thank you!" She leans back against his chest in what is probably supposed to pass as another hug as she reads what's written on the box for her little brother's benefit.
"Am I working for you now?" he asks as he slides under the car.
"Yeah, God forbid
“Is that some kind of pretty woman thing?”
"It's okay, mother, Dean won't be joining us for lunch."
“So, are you?” Cas insists, stopping in the middle of the kitchen while Dean hides in the fridge.
Castiel can’t hear the answer from what must be Bobby Singer, the provider of that particular car. The frown that suddenly appears on his colleague’s face worries him. He checks the files. 1969, Chevrolet Camaro. Blue with white stripes. Less than 40,000 mileage.
This room. There are inside Cas’ memory, inside Cas’ mind. Outside of it, there is only nothingness and Dean has no control there, can only float aimlessly. Unless he’s grabbing onto the Wave.
“Tell. me. How,” Cas asks again, taking a menacing step toward Dean. The hunter glares right back.
At least, now that he’s not an honorary jock anymore, Dean sits with them nearly every lunch. The table feels strangely bereft when he doesn’t, and so does Castiel’s mood.
By the time he sits up, he’s sheepish; water is dripping from his face and hair. He glares at the mocking eyebrow his neighbor is pointing at him.
So what if he’s an emotionally constipated asshole? He’s always been one! Cas liked him just fine before, so there’s no reason that he can’t like him again, that they can’t go back to how they were.
********************
“I thought angels didn’t sleep?”
"There's not much of a salary to earn," Bobby says regretfully.
Despite trying to be careful, Cas startles awake when Dean slips under the covers. The other man raises his head, blinking and grimacing against the light. He groans when he notices Dean watching him from under the covers.
Damn, that man is bendy.
The taste of Cas is more and more heady in his mouth, Cas' voice more hoarse and the hand in his hair starting to pull a little more. Dean can feel his partner is close and it's making his own balls draw up in anticipation, his own hips bucking more widely.
He sits down and waits for them to notice him, which they don’t seem to do.
The wave is getting agitated around him again, trying to get away, but Dean holds on to it, doesn’t let it back away.
Dean slides a little closer. Castiel's hands automatically go to his hips as Dean straddles his thighs. Dean grabs the edge of the tub over Cas' shoulders to stabilize himself as he sits himself on the other man's lap. Dean's shaft is squeezed between them, Cas' under him. If he slides a little more forward, he can just about feel the head of Cas' dick against his ass. It's a novel sensation. One he wants to explore more of. He's surprised by the urgency of that need.
Dean's eyes roam avidly over the other man's body until he notices the smirk on the corner of Cas' lips. Cas' eyes when he meets them look as blue as ever, eyelighted by black eyeliner.
Dean mouths a quiet 'thank you' to Hannah.
"I'm a mechanic," he lies. He'd rather stay as close to the truth as possible. It's a little unfair that Castiel is letting him do all the talking when his initial demand was that he stayed silent, especially since it's his skin that Dean is apparently saving, but the guy looks like he's swallowed a potato whole.
One more time I want to thank my amazing betas because they really did a great work on this story and are continuing to do so on the others stories that are coming.
"I don't always make good decisions with it," Dean admits.
He’s hoping that she’ll lose interest in him once he won’t be burdened by his virgin status anymore. She always says that she favors virgins (which is very creepy and quite worrying, according to Charlie).
"Then ask your d- whatever the guy you're living with is to you to teach you."
"We went for coffee," he finally says.
“No, thank you. In which room do you wish us to have sex?” he asks, turning around to look at the small living room.
"That's just pie," Jack protests with a pout.
"Yeah, I did. Lucifer had quite a ridiculous fall and ended up spitting snow," he says with a cheeky smile.
“I’ve never tried it,” Cas says, distracted because he’s still trying to answer the first question in an appropriate manner. “Dean, I don’t know if I should be h-”
He squeezes his hand a little harder, moves it a little faster in rhythm with the thrusts of Dean into his mouth. He can feel the head of Dean’s cock bumping against the back of his throat every few thrusts and with a little surge of grace he erases the slight discomfort it brings. The hunter must feel it somehow, because he pushes deeper with a broken cry. He rests there for a few moments, looking down in amazement at Cas, his cock buried in the angel’s throat.
Dean doesn't miss the way Naomi is looking at them out of the corner of his eyes. She's been acting strangely magnanimous tonight and it's unsettling, if welcomed.
“Well, don’t believe all that you hear,” Dean mumbles. He seems upset. He looks over at Cas with a kind look though, his hand still on his forearm. “You sure then?”
Here's a picture of Bee-Bee to make you feel better:
Castiel looks around, thinking that he can maybe find a chair somewhere to sit on. He’s even okay with the ground if needed. Before he can make that offer though, Dean is dragging him (again!) toward the armchair. Everyone screams at them when they pass in front of the tv. Cas is so startled by it that he barely reacts when Dean pushes him into the armchair.
"I'm not sure I've told you the date of it yet."
Dean tries to look up, but can't see much, barely the shadow of a baseball cap, behind the lamp torch pointed straight at him, along with a shotgun.
"Yeah it's fine. My car is just around the corner," Dean says, pointing vaguely in the direction of the Impala.
Cas' eyes widens, just a little bit, and he takes a long breath through his nose, like he’d forgotten to breath for a while. He slowly push his hips forward until the head of his dick rests on Dean's bottom lip and Dean pokes his tongue out, curling it a little under it. That makes Cas hum in appreciation, and he pushes even further forward until his cockhead nudges to just past Dean's teeth, resting on his tongue. It's instinctive to close his lips and sucks on the head.
Cas takes a second to try and calm himself before following him inside. He had no idea this would be so stressful. It’s just sex. He’s informed himself on how to do it properly. He even experimented with some things on himself. He feels he has enough knowledge to be able to do it properly. It shouldn’t be different to passing any other test he’s prepared for.
"Thank you for telling me," he says earnestly.
Dean blanches. “What night?” he asks, voice strangled. He knows exactly what night Cas is talking about. The night Cas babysat his coworker’s kid, the last night they spent together. His heart is beating fast and his legs tensing with the need to run away just thinking about it. Cas sends him an impatient look, calling Dean on his bullshit.  “No, we don’t. We said we would never talk about it again,” he reminds, voice firm.
"I'm teasing you, Cas."
"Yeah yeah, I know the deal. You think no one has told me that one before? No bueno, man, I'm keeping your deposit," Ricky grumbles.
"You're not gonna say that when you start sweating cheese during the night," Castiel warns, teasing. "Believe me, we've all been there and have learnt from our mistakes."
this. What the hell is even sexual identity when confronted with something this good? Who the fuck even cares anymore?
sometimes. It's probably an ugly thought, but the fact that Jack seems to reject Cas as much as him, is working to convince him that the problem lay with Jack's mental state as a whole, and not only as a result of how Dean's treated him. Although he doesn't fool himself in thinking it isn't a part of it.
Dean bites the inside of his lips, still looking at the portrait even though the kid has now laid his head on his shoulder, rubbing his fists to his eyes and looking like he’s on the verge of falling asleep. Dean reflexively rubs a hand on the baby’s back as he snuggled his nose into the hunter’s shirt, sniffing sleepily.
Dean won't be overdramatic and says that everyone stopped talking when they entered the room, but they definitely draw more than a pair of eyes. Everyone is dressed in expensive dresses and suits. Dean bought nice black jeans, a red shirt and even a black tie for the occasion, thanks to Castiel's money. He thought his attire would pass as good enough, while still being reusable in future job interviews. He didn't expect people to be dressed like they were at the Queen of England's wedding.
"What happened? Is he okay?" Dean asks, stomach twisting in worry.
Sam and Dean look at the bunker’s kitchen, mouths agape.
"A weekend sounds more intimate. How much PDA do you think they will expect?" Dean asks, scratching his ear and hating the fact that just talking about it is making his cheeks heat. What is he, a thirteen year old girl?
“We’re getting burgers.” Dean answers, maybe a little too harshly.
"We're not friends," Dean corrects, downing his glass in one go and signaling for more.
“Are you implying that I generally don’t care about my personal hygiene?”
, I have no idea who’s in on this. I could get fired, Sammy, or
“No, hey, it’s okay, it’s not-” Cas doesn’t hear what Dean says next, having already ran away.
Dean throws his head back and gives a throaty laugh with his mouth opened, green eyes twinkling and dimples showing. "You are such a fucking sap!"
She muffles something that sounds like an apology, face so squished against his breast bone that he can't understand her words. He doesn't need to. He hugs her back anyway.
Cas is stomping down the street, shouting Jack's name and Dean runs to catch up with him.
Next chapter's title: First times
He looks around, searching for another witness to this weird display, but there is no one around, just a bunch of houses that look exactly like his. He's not a fan of the generic look with the beige walls and white porch, but it was the most decent house he visited in his price range, so it will have to do for now. Like the real estate agent told him, it has 'potential', a blank canvas that he gets to decorate to his taste.
“Don’t objectify me,” Cas repeats for what must be the millions times. Meg is always coming onto him, staring at his ass and making improper comments. It’s quite tiring.
It purrs over him until there is no panic left, no fear, just a conscious thought of existing. It’s warm without fire, the most beautiful melody without sound and the softest silk without touch. Dean can’t help but want to get closer, to melt into it until it encompasses his whole existence.
“Well it’s not like I intend to go to College anyway so…” Dean grumbles to his plate, just loud enough for Bobby to take it as a taunt.
"Dean," she says as what is apparently a sufficient goodbye. Thank God. "I'll be sure to see you on Saturday," she reminds just as they walk away.
"You used to run, although not very assiduously and you haven't done so in a few weeks." Dean opens his mouth, but the other guy goes on, hands passing on the back of his thighs, stopping just under the swell of his ass cheeks. "You have an office job. You sit a lot."
on one.
"That sounds like you're turning this into a wonderful event, mother, Anna must be delighted," Castiel compliments.
Dean should probably have seen that punch coming. As it is, he falls right on his ass, dazed for a second before he's getting right back up.
Oh God.
It's only a matter of minutes before they unload someone's trunk and install themselves in Dean's garden.
Yet Castiel...he's spent the whole drive here wondering if the scruff on his cheeks would feel rough like his own or softer (it's softer, he touched it last night). He has the most beautiful eyes Dean has ever seen, woman or man. His voice makes Dean shiver in places he definitely shouldn't shiver for a man. And his damn hair. Dean wants to either pull on it or tame it at all times.
“This is demon magic, no angel can use that spell,” Cas says as he walks to the map room and looks at the open laptop. “What is this?”
He’s stopped short on the threshold of the kitchen when the first thing he sees looks like a flashback from weeks ago. Dean is standing in front of the kitchen’s glass door, blasted by sunlight as he drinks from a beer bottle. His Adam's apple and his neck are doing that damn thing where they seem to catch Cas’ eyes and renders him unable to look away. Dean’s eyes turn onto him. He suddenly sputters and starts coughing.
"Nah. He's more like his uncle Cas in that way."
"Dean! Dean!" Claire starts calling, trying to pick up an enormous tree branch from the ground. It's at least twice her size. "I win!!" she screams happily..
Dean already has planned to prepare a room just for Castiel. He has green paint in the truck of the Impala, because for some reason that’s Cas’ favorite color. He even found a lamp shaped like a bee that he knows Cas will love. Dean will make a nice place for him, in the bunker and in their life. For the first time, Castiel has no reason to leave, for the first time they can stay together.
," the little girl protests.
I also have
," Cas insists, grabbing his hands back. "Why do you think I started all this in the first place? My family gave up everything so that I could live freely, love anyone I care to, yet I'm thirty and still single. I felt a- a responsibility."
“Gh-un!” Jimmy says in a hiccup.
************
"What went wrong with this one?" Dean laughs.
Well, the dogs are a surprise, at least.
Castiel looks at him sleeping for what he knows is too long.
Sorry about the cliffhanger (or am I?). You can scream at me in the comment section ;-)
He doesn't push inside, just keeps it there, so close to Dean's gaping mouth that he can feel the warmth of it against his lips, smell the musk of it under his nose. There's a question in Cas' eyes as he waits for Dean to make the next move.
"Oh, is it because your attire isn't appropriate?" Castiel's mother asks, looking at the holes in Dean's jeans and the big leather jacket that used to be his dad's. "I assure you they won't say a word about it if you're with us," she reassures.
“I won’t have my baby’s first word be ‘gun’, Dean.”
“Does he...have other powers?”
************
“I’m the bone in this metaphor.” Cas points out wistfully.
"I knew I shouldn't trust you," Cas growls, shaking his head. His eyes are wide and dry, pupils abnormally dilated. There is also a red rim around them that Dean has learned to recognize from his frat days.
"Oh believe me I would love to tell your mom to fuck off, but I like my balls attached to my body, so that's a hard pass."
Next chapter on Wednesday: Chapter 4: A tale of failures
*************************
Dean is crouching just in front of him, one hand on his thigh and the other on his cheek. He looks in his eyes, shaking him when Cas can’t keep them open long enough for him to check his pupils.
They both jump away from each other, before they break out laughing. Cas curls up against him, nose pushing under his chin, and Dean wraps his arms around him.
There must be a way...Cas reappears in the library, opening one of the books on nephilims.
"Do you like strawberries?"
Sam doesn’t say anything, groaning and throwing his hand up in exasperation, his knuckles knocking against the Impala’s roof. “I’ll buy you a new one!”
Dean goes extra slowly as he takes his wallet out of his inside pocket. He slides it over the table to the man, who goes through it until he finds Dean's licence and the Impala's registration papers.
"Dean," Castiel gasps, hands squeezing around the other man's waist to try and guide him closer.
They don't like the same things, and while Dean could hold a conversation with Cas and his family, offer some nodding and semi-pertinent questions, he won't be able to fool them for long. Certainly not long enough for them to have any kind of relationship. Cas is bound to realize that they just don't have anything in common.
“We’ll talk about it tonight. Just...go put on the table or something since you’re useless in the kitchen.”
Castiel falls asleep feeling safe and loved for the first time in years.
They end up going back to Cas' house for 'The Land Before Time' on DVD (which Jack is very happy didn't burn as it's one of his favorites). Later, Dean is glad that they close the blinds to watch it as he tries to discreetly wipe a tear or two away with the sleeve of his hoodie.
Cas makes as if he didn’t hear him, a little too obvious in his ignorance. Dean rolls his eyes.
“I should burn it,” he declares one day, sitting crossed legs on the bed and staring at it, while Charlie lies behind him reading a comic book. The Summer holidays have come around, and Jo went back to her mom’s in Sioux Fall for a fortnight, so Charlie keeps him company every day while Jody goes to work.
No, that's stupid. He might not know the guy that well, but Cas doesn't strike him as a midnight gropper. Hell, Dean tends to be an octopus when he sleeps, Castiel should probably be worried about
"I wish you could see yourself as I see you."
he does."
So far all the art for this story has been made by me. I hope you enjoy it too. I'm not the best photoshopper, but I liked doing those. Of course, I'd be overjoyed to see some of your art for this fic too.
“Jesus,” Dean whispers, leaving Cas’ mouth long enough to gaze down at their bodies.
“He’ll be there.” Dean cuts him off which provokes some happy yells from the jocks. “We’re gonna eat with my cousin today, but I’ll catch you all later, okay?” Dean says, extending his hands again for their weird salute. The jocks all bump hands with him and go back to their table. “See? That wasn’t that bad,” Dean declares with a mocking smirk as they get in line to get their food.
"I call that progress."
"Huh. Cas?"
“And then what?” Cas says between clenched teeth. Dean takes a step back, literally taken aback by the anger he can see reflected in the angel’s eyes. “We would have raised him together? Raised the result of that mistake you couldn’t even bring yourself to talk about?” he taunts.
He remembers earlier, how he managed to pull the wave into his own memory, how his desperation to be heard and understood was broadcasted so strongly that the Wave became agitated.
Dean clears the table and goes to the couch instead. As soon as he sits, Jack comes to cuddle into his side. Dean has half a mind to push him away, but can't find the will to. He can put some distance between them on another day. Right now Jack looks upset and tired, and Dean is not a monster. Whether or not he meant to, he cares about this kid (and his stupid father). So he hugs Jack to his side and asks him inane questions about the cartoon they're watching, trying to make him laugh.
He hits the top of the castle he was building, flinching at the flash of pain from his finger. He looks at it with a pout for a second, watching the purple indentation of the hammer on his nail.
Despite everything, Castiel can’t help but smile when he arrives at lunch to Jo and Charlie making out at their table. Sure, it’s unbecoming, because that’s where food is, and that’s not proper, but he’s happy for them. He ignores the little pinch of jealousy in his heart.
What Chuck wants, what Chuck gets, though, so now Cas is at the head of a team buying stuff he knows nothing about instead of alone in his own office doing what he loves: working the numbers.
************
,” she adds sarcastically. “Do you think he even remembers your name? Your face?” Cas can feel himself shaking, his eyes closed as he’s trying to remember how to breathe, eyes burning. “Do you think he remembers Jimmy?”
“So...We’re good?” he asks, a little hesitant.
"I shouldn't take more of your time," Cas apologizes, taking his wallet out. Dean goggles at the amount of cash in there.
"I'm sure," he says tenderly, squeezing Cas' hand in his and slipping his other arm behind him until he can hug him to his side. "This is good too."
“You okay, Cas?” Sam asks, seemingly noticing Cas’ fareway look too.
“Kinky!” Dean declares, grinning at Cas’ responding blush before he jumps into the water.
“Why didn’t you do this before, then?” Dean asks, getting more and more pissed off by Castiel’s attitude. He can’t just order Sam around like he didn’t nearly kill him last time he saw him!
As I had promised: shorter but angstier... What did you think?
"Come on kiddos, dinner first and then,
“I didn’t even want to go, but Charlie said it would be rude not to,” he pouts.
"And brush your teeth while you're at it!" Dean calls. A clashing noise a few seconds later makes him realise what he just said and he rushes to the bathroom. "Not at the same time!!"
“Hey,” Dean says with a charming smile. He takes a step even closer but stops when Cas backs up, tense. Dean frowns, taking back the hand he just put on the other boy’s hip. “Everything okay?” he asks, worried.
“Shoes and socks can be bothersome during foreplay, so I’m preemptively taking them off, in order to be more efficient,” Cas explains, arranging his socks into his empty shoes. He gets up, wipes his hands on his jeans again and approaches Dean. The other man is looking at him with his mouth pursed and his eyebrows furrowed in bafflement. “I do trust that you have condoms and water based lubricant? I brought some, but forgot them in my bike’s satchel.”
Cas opens his mouth. Close it. “I have no idea actually. It’s never been done before,” he admits, sheepish. “The closest anyone has ever come was me grabbing you from Hell.”
"We'll still see each other a lot, I promise."
Is that how Cas lived that moment? Did he...did he let Dean do this so he wouldn’t abandon him again?
He's never told anyone about Sammy either. About the worst day of his life and those harsh words that pushed the kid out of his life forever. About how he had a choice to make, his dad or his little brother, and made the wrong one. About how he lost everything because of it. Bobby doesn't say anything, doesn't react much, just listen.
Cas inclines his head like he's not sure he does know.
What a freaking asshole! He gets that he's worried and angry, but Jesus, what an asshole!
"What?"
He’s watching a group of people trying to light a bonfire on the lawn, wondering if he should preemptively call the fire department. They seem to be trying to lit it by smashing rocks together, so he thinks he’s safe for now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fuck his life.
"Feet then?" Dean can work with feet. It's not his thing, but Cas is worth a few awkward acts involving feet.
Finding out she was alive has been a shock, but not a surprise. Naomi was clever, way too clever to let herself be killed that easily. She had kept a part of her Grace in a failsafe in Heaven growing back slowly until she was able to possess her vessel again. Not only had it saved her life, she was also able to stay in Heaven, to stay an angel as all her brothers and sisters fell to Earth. Thinking himself alone in Heaven, Metatron had been careless in protecting himself and Naomi had no difficulty capturing him. She took all the valuable knowledge from his head before she killed him. She had opened the door of Heaven back to come to earth, but hadn’t told anyone about it or Metatron’s death yet. Only Castiel.
Castiel wholefully agrees that it’s time for a change of topic.
Castiel frowns when he opens his laptop’s lid the next morning. It’s 7am and Dean is already (still?) working, looking harassed and like he hasn’t slept much, if at all.
"That's just how Lucifer
"What kind of 'work thing' can a mechanic possibly have on a Saturday evening?"
"I assure you I didn't see-," Castiel gulps, not quite meeting his eyes. "Why are you naked in our jacuzzi?" he asks, voice strangled.
She does that sometimes, when she needs to remind herself that he’s okay, like the fact that he has hair on his head means that he’s doing better. It’s probably true, because the last time he didn’t have hair, everything was horrible.
"My clients are here."
“Badada!” Jimmy says to him over his shoulder, like he approves on that last point.
"Sorry, buddy, but I already have plans for tonight," Dean apologizes. Jack pouts, looking like he's two seconds away from crying. "But how about you go have a good night sleep and I'll come over tomorrow morning with breakfast, so we can watch Paw Patrol together?"
“Rude,” he mutters. He’s nearly missing Kevin right now. Thankfully, they do stop kissing before he can lose his appetite. “I’m guessing the rest of your weekend was enjoyable?” he teases the girls, as Charlie steals an apple off his tray.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You want me to go check if I find your dad?"
************
The only kid he's ever cared for before was his little brother, and with Sam...he screwed up too. He screwed everything up. The thought of ever hurting Jack is unbearable, and Dean can't help but think that he should put some distance between them before the worst happens. He's not even sure how they became that close in the first place, although Jack seems to have the same talent as his adoptive father for inserting himself into people's life and heart whether they want him to or not.
“Where does this stuff even come from?” He ponders into his cup of coffee.
“I didn’t exactly have many options.”
“Thankfully, as soon as Bartholemew brought him to earth, Jimmy did exactly this,” Cas explains with a nod toward his son on Dean’s lap, barely getting the hunter’s cup of coffee away before it can be thrown off the table.
Dean doesn't go far though, something tackling his legs and nearly sending him to the floor. He huffs and grabs the kid hugging his legs, raising him in his arms until he's cuddling to his chest instead.
“Yes,” Castiel confirms. He lets out a gasp in surprise when Dean grabs his belt and brings him close. Their chests collide and stay flush together as Dean’s fingers slide under Cas’ shirt to caress his hips, making him shiver.
“I could make my dad’s bed…”
"I love your onesie, dude, those bees are super cute!" Charlie says enthusiastically.
He gets why Hannah didn't bring them all to the park. Claire was an angel compared to Lucifer's kids. He's pretty sure that the ten year old named Crowley tried to lift his wallet, and Ruby spent the whole meal telling them about the dead bird she found, in excruciating detail. Michael's twins were a little better, mostly because they were still toddlers, so they didn't do much except laugh and slobber on everything. Still, Dean had a new found respect for the poor nannies that have to take care of the kids while their parents went to have a good time skiing.
"Buying this house was the first thing I did when I quit my old life."
"Not very competitive, is he?" Dean chuckles.
More than this, he's not sure how he's supposed to make it so Jack stops doubting himself like that. He's been trying, again and again, for weeks to convince the kid that he's worth staying for, that he's worth
“What for?”
"Yeah, I'm fine. I should go," he says, waving a dismissing hand over his shoulder.
Castiel’s new apartment was as obsolete as Dean expected it to be. It was just a small room where they could barely fit the huge sofa Dean made him buy, a small kitchenette, a barely decent bathroom, and a bedroom with a surprisingly big wardrobe that Castiel didn’t even have enough clothes to fill since he was still wearing the Winchester's hand me downs.
Now it’s all gone and the silence has never felt so oppressing before. Castiel has never been as aware of how utterly alone he is as at that moment.
He walks to the nearest cardboard box to grab a bunch of books, stacking them on the newly installed shelf. It takes a while to put them in a way that they don't end up sliding off the tilted shelf.
"Did you know that there are no girl worms?" Jack says as he takes Dean's hand to follow him.
So, what are your thoughts on this chapter? Are you satisfied with the way everything was resolved? TELL ME EVERYTHING.
When he raises his eyes, Dean tries to act as if he’s very focused on his work again. He’s such an emotionally constipated doofus, Cas thinks, rolling his eyes affectionately.
Dean can't help but feel like a fraud. No matter their flaws, the Novak family has welcomed him into their ranks. Hannah's words keep turning inside his head. Castiel is a gentle soul. Surely he deserves better than this whole masquerade. He deserves to meet someone real. He deserves to introduce his real boyfriend to his family and live all those first times with him. Dean shouldn't be here and spoiling it all with a lie. They're opening their arms (barely, but still) to him, who knows if they will do the same to Castiel's next partner? Who's to say that their bad experience with Dean won't impact their behavior toward Cas' future
, so even though he was only born two minutes before me, he always took care of me. He didn’t drink his Grace either, not without me. He took my hand and hid us behind a dresser, covered under a blanket like he always did when he used to tell me scary stories.” Castiel wipes at his eyes. “He tried to reassure me, to convince me that it was going to be okay, that our Father was waiting for us. I wanted to try and run away instead, but his belief was too strong. All we needed to do was close our eyes and drink our Grace. Easy, he said. We promised we would do it together. I promised him I was going to be brave enough to do it, too.”
It's rare to leave Cas speechless, Dean would mock his round eyes and gaping mouth if he wasn't having a tiny panic attack of his own.
She makes him a whole continental breakfast, and he forces himself to eat it to please her, even though his own stomach is in knots.
Cas doesn’t answer, he can’t. He feels petrified, like his whole body has stopped functioning.
He doesn't exactly have a stellar past in terms of romance and relationships. He's always been more of a fuck them and leave them kinda man. The last girlfriend he had was Cassie in highschool and it lasted about four months. Or did Lisa count? He was very fond of Lisa, even though that ship sailed after about five dates.
By the time he gets out of the bathroom, Cas is nowhere to be seen, having probably already gone down for breakfast. Dean ponders for a few minutes if he should even get out of this room. He's still queasy from all the cheese. Their morning adventures didn't help, making him so nervous that his stomach is in knots. His thoughts are racing and he doesn't feel like seeing Cas right now.
. Look at that, Cas, this gift basket probably cost more than I make in
As if to prove a point, the kid flies right into Dean’s arms. “Yeah, good luck with that,” Dean scoffs, pointing at the baby grabbing his chin to try and suck on it.
Castiel squints in that confused way he has, but Dean doesn't have the energy to be philosophical right now. When he notices that Dean is not moving to grab the envelope, he goes to Dean's backpack and shoves it inside.
Dean can't quite bring himself to.
Thank God he's still wearing boxers or this would be really weird.
"What's my name?"
Dean may have to wait his turn to go to the bathroom in the morning, but Castiel is a pretty good cook so that's a win. Jack is still adjusting, but Dean finds it hard to blame him for being difficult. At four years old, that kid has lived through more trauma than most adults. If he wants to run around screaming wearing only a purple tutu on his head, Dean will indulge him. Anything to let him blow off some steam, it's not like it's hurting anyone.
Cas can't quite look  him in the eyes, so he grabs his chin and brings him in for another kiss. It's the best diversion he's found. Sex and affection always prevail over anything else for Dean.
"What am I even doing here? Jesus," he grumbles, getting frustrated as he struggles to put his shirt the right side on.
"I could totally bang a dude as hot as you if I wanted," Charlie says before hitting his arm, "and don't change the subject! Cas was totally jealous and you know it."
Okay, so maybe Cas is a little pissed after all. But at least he’s still here, right?
He leaves Dean alone in one of the bedrooms of his goddamn house.
That night, Jody sleeps in his bed, holding his hand. He likes when she sleeps with him, though never dares to ask her to. He’s glad she’s here now. He still has nightmares of monsters lurking on the outside of blankets forts, but every time he opens his eyes and she’s there, it reminds him that sometimes the blanket falls over and a knight with a star on their heart is there to protect him.
As usual, you can hit Dean (or the author) by adding a kudo or a comment ;-)
Dean opens the garden's gate and stops, mouth hanging open. All he can think for about five seconds is the word 'butt' as there is one pointed right at him from just ten feets away. A very nice butt, barely hidden by a skin-clinging pair of grey yoga pants.
He should give his resignation to Chuck right away. He tried to talk about it with his stepfather yesterday night. Well, not it
“Good, then I can go back to sleep,” Bobby declares, straightening. “You need a ride, kiddo?” he asks Charlie.
Dean's eyes bulge out, "That's way more than five hundred dollars."
"Am I?" Dean says back, skeptical, but Castiel is already gone.
“Dean…”
Dean raises an interrogative eyebrow at her, feeling like they're a story behind that remark.
Dean stirs at the sound of his neighbor's dog barking. He groans a little, his right hand sliding under his shirt to scratch at his stomach as the other one caress his hair in a soothing move. If he doesn’t open his eyes, he can nearly believe it’s someone else’s hand caressing him like this.
“What, you’re still all mormon and shit?” Ash asks, not meanly.
Oh great. So much for the end of the gay freakout.
“Well, it
Castiel must not be very spiteful though, because he gets back to work a second later. Dean throws his head back, biting his bottom lip to try and stay as quiet as possible. He's never been very loud in the bedroom, has certainly never been a screamer, yet there's a shout in his throat right now that the whole family would probably hear if he dares to let it out.
He jumps when the door suddenly opens. He looks wide eyes at Castiel, standing in the doorway of the bathroom, a frown appearing on the angel’s face as the seconds tick by and Dean says nothing. Jimmy is wrapped into a towel, light brown hair wet and sucking on his big toe. Dean stares at him, the baby just calmly blinking back. After a while, Jimmy offers him a big smile, tongue picking out a little under his front teeth. Damn, he’s seen that smile before.
The man shrugs and starts putting on a shirt. "Jack is a very shy kid, and she's a pincher," he explains with a grimace that makes Dean think that she has pinched more than Jack's cheeks in the past.
"I think Dean is very handsome, Castiel," a gorgeous woman with auburn hair says.
Dean is willing, you can play your new game with him," Gadreed announced, picking up Jack from Dean's lap and putting him on his own hip. He nudges Claire until she climbs off Dean too, looking disgruntled.
He looks around the little entry and messy living room. It's configured just as his house, yet doesn't look anything like it. There's a green couch in the middle of the living room with two mismatched armchairs and a coffee table looking like it's been painted by Jack (hazardly and with too many colors). A few piles of books that look like they are on the verge of tipping over, as well as toys, are scattered everywhere. An arched wall leads to a kitchen full of cabinets as blue as the outside walls of the house. A beaded curtain is hanging from the door Castiel disappeared through.
It all accelerates again, his surroundings moving too fast to really process anything.
“Yeah, pretty exciting,” Dean says dryly, moving his head so he can keep reading his laptop’s screen over the kid’s head. The baby suddenly throws himself backward, headbutting the hunter in the chin, making him wince in pain.
Dean sighs. He hates Benny for this...but that's also the kindest thing anyone has ever done for him. Maybe Benny really is a friend after all, because Dean is hundred percent sure that, in his current state of mind, he would burn through all that money in less than a month. He just can't see a way out right now. He's seen how the other half lives. More than the luxury, it showed him what having a family is like, and it makes Dean aches to know that all the money in the world isn't going to give him that. His mom has been dead for decades, his dad is gone too, and Sammy...Sammy is just as well as gone too. Or rather, Dean is dead to him.
“I can give you back the physical version if you want, but I thought it would be easier to get it around once digitized,” she explains, a little hesitant as she gives him the key. “I also edited a few typos.”
Dean pushes open the door and Cas looks up. For the first time since the moment after Jimmy was taken, his face isn't painted in wrath or completely closed off. Though he does look like he’s trying to hide his emotions for a few seconds, he can’t seem to be able to right now. Their eyes lock and suddenly Cas starts shaking, looking so devastated that Dean can’t help but rush to his side with the need to comfort him. His ass is barely on the bed before Cas is sobbing into his collarbone, breaking down for what Dean suspects is the first time since his son was taken.
The truth is, what else can he say when he can barely admit to himself that he may indeed like Cas that way? That liking may not even be the right word for what he feels.
"I mean, as the owner of this fine establishment, I'm all for it, but as a friend-"
Dean gulps down the rest of his beer to give himself some time to find an appropriate answer. He feels like he might need another one. Oh, great, an excuse to get out of here. Perfect.
"It's easy you just tap what you want here," Jack explains, pointing at the search bar. "I don't know how to write yet. Do you?" Jack asks, looking like he's suddenly doubting it.
"Still. I feel like you deserve an explanation."
A tap on his naked ass makes him yelp in surprise and they both laugh. Cas turns around, to avoid the touch as much as to try and change the subject. He grabs the back of Dean's neck, clashing their lips together in a kiss that doesn't last as long as he would like. He still marvels at the fact that he can do that now, at the privilege it is to be able to caress and kiss Dean whenever he wants to. He does it a lot.
"I think I'll take the duck today," Naomi notes. "Nobody cooks it better than chef Francis. How about you Dean? Have you ever come here before?" There is a mean glint in her eyes that says she knows perfectly well he hasn't. Hell, from the side eyes he got from everyone as they crossed the room, everyone here knows he's not from their world. There are three holes in his jeans, threads hanging from the bottom and his dad's leather jacket probably should have ended up in the trash about three years ago. Even now, it's still too big for him and the sleeves are so scruffed that they're nearly paper thin. The original dark brown color has turned to a light beige in most places from wear. Dean's scruff is just the bad side of too long now, and he hasn't had a haircut since April, strands starting to fall into his eyes. At least, he's wearing his best plaid shirt and managed to wash up last night, so he's not smelling too rank. Why would Castiel pick him out of all the people in the street at that moment to play his boyfriend? It makes no sense at all. From the guy's obvious discomfort as he hides behind his menu, he's probably starting to realize it.
Next chapter's title: For Sammy
"The forest?"
“Can you believe it?" he asks Sam, bewildered.
She squeezes his knee as she sits down and sends him a look, checking silently if he’s okay. He knows that as delighted as she looks at seeing what sounds like a friend from her old life, she would drive them right home without any hesitation at any sign of distress on Cas’ face.
