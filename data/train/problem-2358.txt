John grunted his acknowledgement and put on a burst of speed, cutting to the right to make that direction a less appealing option for the suspect. Sure enough, the man wavered for a moment, then disappeared down the alley to the left at full tilt.
John looked down and blinked.
Sherlock sighed. “As much as I’d prefer you naked, I suppose seeing you in my clothes will be a satisfactory second option.”

Then they were inside, the thick, too-warm atmosphere of the pub wrapping them in humidity as they headed for a corner of the pub holding no less than fifteen strapping military lads, all of whom turned to cheer as their little group entered. The six of them made their way over and grabbed a table on the edge of the gathering, John steering Sherlock to the seats on the end so they could make a quick getaway if needed.
The gloves did look amazing on Sherlock’s hands, though.

"But we all know that's not true. I'm breaking his confidence right now, but Molly and I couldn't stand to watch you two torture yourselves any longer."
The snow was falling in earnest by the time Sherlock returned from his shopping excursion, his cheeks flushed with cold and his hair dusted with fine powdery flakes. A warm, sweet scent filled the entryway of 221 Baker Street as he closed the door behind him, welcoming him home and drawing him upstairs. Inside, John stood before the hob, stirring a pot with a wooden spoon and humming quietly to himself.

Sherlock blinked, and his gaze swept over John one more time in apparent confusion.
All pretense of wellness was gone. The naloxone had helped, had held Sherlock’s facade in place for nearly an hour, but here, between the two of them in the empty shell of their shared home, Sherlock shook and sweated, pleaded with silent, pained eyes. John sat on the edge of the bed, brushed the damp curls off Sherlock’s forehead, and Sherlock curled onto his side, curving around John’s hip and leaning his forehead into John’s thigh with a strangled whisper.
John barked a harsh laugh. "Well, I'm so glad you've managed to overcome your blind spot to pour salt into every raw place in my psyche. Now that you've thoroughly analyzed me I imagine we're done now, right? There's nothing left to figure out, so I'm boring now.

“John,” he murmured, pulling him from his memories with a hand on his shoulder. John blinked and looked up at him, the painful haze slowly fading from his eyes. Sherlock smiled, just a little, before moving to the door and pulling on his coat.

Sherlock stopped in his tracks right in the middle of the crowd, enveloped by the pack of revelers all swallowed in their coats and scarves, huddled against the increasingly chilled wind. His head was bent over his phone, his mouth pressed into an unhappy line, while his parents walked on without him. They made it halfway across the square before they realized that Sherlock was no longer with them, then doubled back. Sherlock didn’t look up as they approached.

It seems like after our conversation on your birthday we should really be better at this. That talk was more than we’ve ever had, but even still, we mostly talked around things rather than about them. There’s so much…
Being impressed with Sherlock's restraint and manners, however, was a wholly new experience.
“An execution,” John snapped, the suffocating weight in his chest forcing the words down into roughness. His hands fell away from his face, and he clenched his fists, shut his eyes, swallowed hard.

John allowed himself a brief minute to breathe in the fresh afternoon air, to let new truths settle into their puzzle piece slots before diving into the busy closing time crowd at Speedy’s. 3:15 PM, just enough time to order fish and chips, some veggie risotto, and a cup of soup in case nothing else sat well on Sherlock’s stomach. He sat down at the frontmost table to wait for his order and was hardly surprised when the tip of an umbrella and a pair of bespoke shoes obscured his view of the floor. A faint rattle accompanied the drop of another prescription bag against the tabletop next to him.
“Not at all,” John said.
John mustered a wry smile.
“I thought much the same. But I hoped. Just a bit.”
John looked around to verify his appraisal of the situation with the nearest sane human being. None were to be found.
John flushed and shot them a grateful smile. ”I will. I promise.”

Sherlock felt suddenly shy, knowing everything was written large on his face for John to see. His eyes darted to the side, to the floor, but John wouldn’t have it. He guided Sherlock’s hand, still clutching his wine glass, up to chest level, then clinked his own glass against Sherlock’s in a toast. “We’ve waited so very long. And I am so unbelievably happy to finally be here. All I ever wanted for Christmas was you. Thank you for this perfect gift.”
[The room falls silent as GL picks up his champagne glass and looks over the assembled guests]
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched, and then they were off again, giggling like school children. And something about it all made John brave, because he stepped forward to brace his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder, resting one hand on Sherlock’s hip as he laughed. Sherlock didn’t miss a beat, resting his cheek on the side of John’s head and wrapping one arm around John’s shaking shoulders. When Mr. and Mrs. Holmes arrived with the desserts, they broke apart, wiping their eyes, their chuckles trailing off.
Dear Sherlock,
When the DI and his officers finally showed up to take the suspect off their hands (quite literally, in John’s case), John ended up backed into a corner by a rather persistent Officer Jamison who wanted to “take his statement.” She was exactly the sort of woman John would have gone for, before. Confident, bold and direct, free with her innuendo and with the buttons of her shirt. Her dark hair was pulled back from her lovely round face, her eyes bright and mischievous.
His summer of med school bartending came in handy as he managed his way back to the table with four pints and a rocks glass clutched expertly together in his hands. It appeared he was too late, though, as he overheard their conversation on his approach.

John tightened his hold and brushed his lips over curls, cheekbones, nose. “I always would have chosen you. I chose you the day we met. I’m sorry it took me so long to tell you.”

The drive passed in a blur of panting need, John somehow managing to get three fingers back inside Sherlock, keeping him open and adding more lube so they could resume without delay. John was only aware of their arrival once the driver knocked on the opaque divider window.
John’s heart leapt, and he snuck a glance across the table. Sherlock looked like he wanted to drown himself in his wine glass.

Mrs. Hudson bustled forward, never one to be cowed by Sherlock’s moods. “Not at all, dear, just the first to arrive.” She took the Tesco’s bag from him and peeked inside, then patted him on the cheek. “Molly will be here, never you worry, Inspector. Have you met the Holmes’ yet?”
It had been quite a task to procure tea, milk, and sugar from Mrs. Hudson without engaging in a drawn out discussion of Sherlock’s fate, but he’d managed with a battery of doctorly excuses and a healthy dose of his trademark prickliness. He filled the kettle and set it to boil, then prepared their two mugs side by side, just like before. It had only been a week, after all. The muscle memory still carried his fingers from task to task, easy as breathing.

It took a moment for the pressure of the silence to break through Sherlock’s internal battle. He looked up in alarm to find John staring at the card, his mouth tight and unhappy. Sherlock stood, came to John’s side to look over his shoulder.
Mrs. Hudson patted his hand and leaned back. “I don’t know what you think you’ve managed to keep secret from the most observant man in the world, but of course, you have my word.”

“There are no recording devices in this room. You needn’t worry about anything you say being used against you later.”
"They'll take the piss all bloody night if I show up alone. I’d rather not be laughed at for two straight hours."
Sherlock huffed, but complied, giving his curls a toss to emphasize his irritation. “There. Eyes on road. Who are you texting? Is it Mrs. Hudson? Has her pompous nephew finally driven her to murder? Tell her to make it interesting, at least.”

“Mummy,” Sherlock snapped again, visibly horrified. John waved him off, though, and met Mummy’s gaze with a slight nod, his heart aching for the young, vulnerable Sherlock who had his heart broken. Sherlock deserved his honesty after that revelation. Time to fulfill his part of the plan.
“I must have deleted it,” Sherlock said eventually, a bit breathless.
Molly Hooper was a woman on a mission, and she refused to be swayed. She had Sherlock Holmes backed into the corner of an adorable sweet shop draped in gauzy fake snow and cheerful twinkling fairy lights, pinned there by the force of her glare.

They worked side-by-side for two hours, in near silence that grew progressively more comfortable as the sun rose and London came awake on the street below. Empty dust outlines were filled as items returned to their former homes, tea and toast were consumed, and every piece put back felt like another brick in the wall, rebuilding their fortress. Just the two of them against the rest of the world. At home, together.

Why do you think I have a drinking problem?
I know this is stupidly early, but it’s also years too late at the same time, so it’s a compromise, right? And it doesn’t have to mean marriage if you don’t want it to, but it does mean that you have my commitment, Sherlock. I’m home. Forever.

Five chapters today. Sorry to all you folks who don't read much fic on the weekends—you'll have a lot of catching up to do tomorrow!
John smiled, bent down to frame Sherlock’s face with his thumbs and press a sweet kiss on his lips. His eyes were soft and bright, such a deep blue when viewed so close up, and the mischievous crinkle at their corners stoked the fire in Sherlock’s belly. He lifted his hips and dragged himself over John’s slick cock with an impatient groan.

. This one guy, Thom, wanted to take me home, and when I said no he offered to suck me off in the loo instead. I declined, of course, told him I wasn’t looking for anything tonight. It would have felt like a betrayal to Sherlock, obviously. But his wanting didn’t feel wrong. It felt amazing. And whenever dad’s voice made an appearance, I just danced closer, let my hands wander, let the music drown it out. I never would have acted on it, not with the way I feel about Sherlock, but for once this wasn’t about him. It was about me. It was about who I am, what I needed. Who I want to be.
So when you come to 221B Baker Street these days, this is what you’ll see: two men and their daughter, fiercely in love and utterly devoted. It’s been a long time coming, and we certainly took the hard road to get here. But now that we are, it’s like the world has snapped into focus.
When I startled him out of one of these dazes for the third time, he apologized and admitted to being preoccupied with Sherlock’s latest letter. Finally having confirmation that Sherlock is gay and has had a relationship in the past shook John to the point of a drinking binge, though not out of any homophobic discomfort. He

“How about we skip the going out part,” Sherlock said, shifting closer until he could feel the heat of John all along his body, “and go straight to bed.”
And there was something in his voice, in his eyes, that made Sherlock obey. With one last skeptical look for Lestrade, he slid his finger under the flap of the envelope and broke the seal with an impatient rip. Inside was a single heavyweight stationary card, embossed with silver snowflakes around the edges. In the center of the card, in Lestrade's neatest handwriting, was a message:

“Right.

Then tomorrow morning, I want to drag you out for brunch while you’re still susceptible to being fed.”

“And hungry now, too! If I’d known a good shag would make you so compliant, I would have gotten my courage up a long time ago.”
In all possible universes, John Watson will always ask Sherlock Holmes if he wanks. It is a fixed point.
what actually comes out is, “Since when do you wear a ring?”
Sherlock glared daggers at his mother’s back as he paced around the sitting room, doing his best to tune out the horrid small talk his family insisted on. They’d only been there for six hours and Sherlock was already on the verge of creating a crime scene of his own. They’d managed to finish decorating the tree, have lunch, ‘catch up’, and watch a horrid holiday movie together in that time, and though John had done an admirable job of keeping Mycroft in check and managing Sherlock’s moods simultaneously, they were both still teetering on the edge of their tempers.
“I’m sorry if that was the wrong thing to do,” he said quietly, his eyes fixed straight ahead, “but it seemed the quickest way to shut him up. He deserved to be made a fool of.”

There was a bustle of activity as Mummy and Father cleared the dishes and disappeared into the kitchen to gather the deserts, and the weight of Sherlock’s stare, of being alone with him, suddenly felt crushing. He pushed back from the table with the loud scape of wood on wood and stumbled to his feet.

Sherlock finally broke the silence. He pulled away just enough to let John’s cock slide from his arse, then turned in John’s arms to capture his lips in a slow, sweet kiss.
John wrenched his eyes away from Sherlock’s body and snatched the baby monitor off the desk, his heart aching. Mrs. Hudson was home, and she was always good for tea and company. Yes. Tea. Good. Safe. He crept down to 221A, careful to avoid the squeaky stair, and knocked gently on Mrs. Hudson’s door. She opened it a moment later with a brilliant smile.

Sherlock’s shout echoed through the kitchen, the sound reflecting back at him in all its ragged desperation. He’d forgotten how loud he was in bed, and John-bloody-Watson was bringing it out in him in spades, reducing him to a panting-moaning-babbling mess with tongue and lips and hands all over his body. There was no subtlety, no teasing; John took Sherlock apart with single-minded determination, with long strokes of his entire mouth, his tongue working the underside of his cock with each pull in a rhythm that left Sherlock gasping, hovering on the blurry edge of awareness.

He thought about giving it to Sherlock during one of their dinners out, or during a quiet movie night on the couch together, but both felt too... intimate. Too revealing. It wouldn't do to spoil the whole experiment by scaring Sherlock off before he could test all four languages.

John paused just outside the door to 221b with his heart in his throat.
And I’ve started rambling again. I wasn’t even intending to get into that whole thing yet, but you pull one thread and it all starts unraveling at once. It’s such a tangled mess.
“I… ahh… I thought we were going to bed?” he said with a groan.
He realized too late that every time they spent an evening together, John sank into it wholly, let himself get just as wrapped up in Sherlock as he did during a case, let the time go by and the space between them erode until he was drunk on proximity and cleverness. At the end of it all, John couldn’t be sure how much of it was Sherlock and how much was his own feelings showing through, coloring the experience.

Sherlock cried out and pushed back against John’s hand until one finger was fully seated, then two, until before long he was bouncing his arse with abandon on three of John’s fingers. Tension coiled tight in John’s belly, and he gripped the base of his cock tight as he marveled at the sight of Sherlock taking his pleasure.
“Let me be perfectly precise, Sherlock,” John said, tracing the tip of his nose along Sherlock’s neck. “In case there’s any remaining doubt: I have been in love with you for years. 221B has always been my home. You are the father of my child. And I’m deeply sorry for what I’ve put you through, but I can promise you this. You are the rest of my life.”

“Come on,” he said, nudging Sherlock’s shoulder with a smile. “Let’s ditch these cases. Your mother is not someone to keep waiting.”

His eyes locked back on John, tight with remembered hurt, as John stepped in front of Sherlock to shield him. “I’ve seen your blog. I know what the score is. You may not know it, but you’re in love with him, Johnny.”
Out in the sunlight, John could almost pretend. They’d walked together through the park on many sunny days before, the motion of aimless wandering a catalyst for Sherlock’s brain when John’s presence alone wasn’t enough. It could be any such day, a mystery just ahead and Lestrade on their heels, the maddening sensation of a solution just on the tip of the brain.
John cut him off with another kiss, harder and more desperate. “I’m so sorry, Sherlock, if I had known I would never—”
“I forgive you for trying,” Sherlock said, then pulled a foil packet from the pocket of his pyjama bottoms and shoved it into John’s hand.
"All of the above," he said, low and rough.
Okay, apparently he'd have to be even more direct. Why had Sherlock chosen this of all moments to be frustratingly obtuse?
And, against all logic and sanity, Iain held out a hand to John for a shake. He pasted on what passed for a polite smile, still two-thirds sardonic at the best of times, and shook his head when John accepted his hand.
John saw the exact moment he shifted from half-asleep and panicked back into the armored, distant skin he wore in the daytime. He pulled all that vulnerability back in, tucked it away, though his body betrayed him. His eyes darted first over John, then over the entire room, sweep after sweep. His respiration increased, and his pulse visibly sped in the fluttering of his carotid artery.

Sherlock’s mouth seized up in a tight frown. He took a deep breath through his nose and swallowed.
The evening began at the courthouse, where Sherlock became Rosie’s father in the eyes of the law. He was already her father, of course, but the official recognition means a lot. Those closest to us were in attendance as witnesses to the adoption order, so Rosie was surrounded by her entire extended family when she officially became Rosie Watson-Holmes. I think Sherlock was more emotional for the adoption decree than he was for our actual wedding ceremony, which was held immediately afterward at the Mayfair Library. No special significance to that spot, it was just a certified venue that was convenient to both the courthouse and Baker Street, though apparently Sherlock does have some fondness for libraries. Who knew. Afterward, we all went to the restaurant where Sherlock and I had our first date for dinner and general celebrating. There was a lot of champagne. A LOT. And a ridiculous cake. It was a lovely evening, a lot of fun, and it was great having all our friends and family together.
Yours,
John shrugged, but didn’t look away. “Technically true. That’s the kind of rationalizing you do when your parents are… like mine.”
John winced. “Sorry, Molly. We have a… thing. To handle.”

God, I didn’t realize how much of that I had completely blocked out. He used to lay into me after every single rugby practice. he insisted that I chose rugby over football so I could roll around with shirtless guys after school.
He could not have been less interested. And even if he had been tempted, the look on Sherlock’s face when John spotted him over Jamison’s shoulder would have killed it instantly. He cut off whatever she’d be saying with a shake of his head.
“Sherlock, wait!” he called. Sherlock stopped but didn’t turn around, the line of his shoulders hunched and rigid.
The highest of praise. Let’s do this again soon.
“You want me?” he asked, a small break on the last word.
Sherlock would need maximum specificity. Had to have all the facts. Couldn't leave anything to assumption or implication. John took a bracing sip of tea and forged ahead.
John and Sherlock were about to catch a cab home from a crime scene when a voice nearby caught John's ear: "Oh shit, is that Sherlock? Yeah, oh my

“Hmm, yes,” John said. “Get you ready for round two, yeah? You have more lube?”

As soon as they made it inside, Sherlock fell back onto the bed and propped himself up on his elbows, his hard cock obscenely obvious in his tented trousers. He watched John’s eyes go dark, watched the slow slide of his smile from sweet into dirty, and he threw his head back in submission as John climbed onto the bed, on top of him, hands at the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt.

“All gone?” John asked, taking up the empty water glass on the bedside table and replacing it with tea and food. Sherlock nodded and poked at the fish and chips, though judging from the protective hand resting over his belly it wasn’t likely to work out. John ducked into the bathroom to refill the glass from the tap and studiously avoided his reflection. He was transparent to Sherlock on the best of days, but now, after everything, John felt it spilling out from every glance, written bold in every line around his mouth. Pain, regret, worry, yes, but also… longing. Hope.

I can’t believe I’ve been hating myself for this for years, since I was a teenager. I hated myself for loving Sherlock because he was a man. I still hate myself, a little bit, for wanting him because he’s my best friend. Hopefully that last little bit will be gone soon, though. Because I have to tell him.
: Dr. Watson, can you speak on the veterans’ concerns that they wouldn’t be taken seriously due to their mental health?

“Did you let him fuck you?” John demanded, pulling back just enough to shift his spit-slick cock between Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock jerked hard, a thrill of pleasure blooming at the base of his spine.
/ 11:43 AM
John captured Sherlock’s wandering finger in the crook of his own, used it to pull Sherlock into him as he tripped up the stoop of 221B, his back to the door.
You’ll have to talk to Sherlock about that.
Sherlock studied John for a long moment, bringing his folded hands to just barely touch his mouth.
John has informed me that I’m required to invite you to Watson’s first birthday party this Saturday
You’re not taking my cases
And when Sherlock tugged him back toward the bedroom, half-dressed and flushed, John kept their lips sealed together and went, free and wanting and ready. He took Sherlock to bed, wrapped him up in his arms, and for the first time let himself believe with his whole heart.
“God, Sherlock, I could come just like this, come all over your gorgeous hole. You’re so perfect, so hot, does that feel good? Do you like it?”
Thanks again.
That’s not what I’m saying.
The Sherlock I knew back then couldn’t be more different than the one here today, and that difference is all down to John. The Sherlock of seven years ago refused to let anyone think he might have feelings at all. Today, Sherlock is a husband, a father, and a truly good man, with John still by his side—
“I do hope you know what you’re doing. Be careful with him, Doctor.”
Hallucinations [  ]   Delusions [  ]   Sleep Problems [X]   Appetite Problems [X]   Drug/Alcohol Abuse [  ]
Greg knows his mouth is hanging open in that way that Sherlock loves to make fun of, but he can’t seem to stop himself. He shakes his head once, then again. “Would anyone like to enlighten me?”
Sherlock hummed and thrust his arse back against John’s hand, cocking his hips to present his arse for best effect and rubbing back against John's clothed cock.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” his mouth asked as the rest of him spun uselessly, seeking traction, failing utterly.
“I see no reason not to. He was a perfectly adequate lover, and lacking any other options—”
Sherlock choked on his sip of wine at the implication, and John had to quietly admire Mummy’s gall. It was only the first shot of her volley, however.
"Our names were only in the drawing because Lestrade wanted to get back at you for that stunt you pulled in the courtroom last month. Besides, the names had already been drawn. If we'd backed out, two people at the party would have gone without a secret Santa gift. The only two people we actually consider friends, at that."
Ask to see the brother-in-law’s shoes
After secreting these completely unlabeled numbers away in his case notebook, it took John two long weeks to figure out there was no good time or place to spring an unexpected gift on someone.
"John..."
a future. He is making plans, reconnecting with friends, letting his family back into his life. He spent nearly ten minutes talking about his plans for Rosie Watson’s birthday party this weekend, which he has been working hard to plan and prepare. The pictures of his craft projects were a delightful addition to our session.
John,
“I know you can’t learn how to care for a child from a book, of course,” Sherlock began, “and I have no practical experience, but I… she…”
You and me, we’re okay?
D’you want to come up for one more drink?
(Laughter)
Sorry. Right.

“I tried to tell myself I… grew out of it or something.”
At that, their eyes met for a brief, silent moment, and they broke into a fit of uncontrollable giggles. Sherlock spun around and snatched the crystal ashtray from its place on the mantle, then formally presented it to John on a flat, outstretched palm.

“I never would have checked a hiding place so high above your head. Very clever indeed, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock said. He let his lean body slide against John’s as he stretched up for the top cabinet and drew down… a bottle of scotch and rizla paper?
A long pause, and John silently urged him,
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock said. “Today, let’s just… keep it. For us.”
He cocked his head, his lips pressed into a sad, horrible smile.

See you at 2:30. Have those chips ready for me
Sherlock chuckled, inexplicably charmed just like before, the easy camaraderie falling back into place.
“—going down to 221C. It’ll be fine, John. I’ve already started cleaning up down there.”

They talked about the things they unearthed, too. Sherlock’s Cambridge degrees and fencing trophies, his academic awards and judo certificate. John’s rugby jersey and a bone from med school, his grandfather’s broken watch and his military mementos. Things they wanted to remember and things they’d just as soon forget, all shared.

“Perfect!” Lestrade said, leading them toward the car. “We should be done just in time for the start of the office Christmas party, too.”
Sherlock's love language? If he were to want to receive love, how would he want it? How would he hear it? It apparently wasn't acts of service, as John had tried that plenty. But that still left four options.
, even, perhaps. Sherlock allowed himself a brief smug smile and an indulgent glance at John’s back, hips, and arse. The thought of John’s eyes on him made his heart race, his skin tingle with awareness; the thought of his
Perhaps it was only that John participated in the settling, this time around. At his first view of Baker Street six years ago, Sherlock had already moved in, both his clutter and his personality filling every crack in the floorboards and spot on the shelves. John had slotted in happily enough, winding himself around the big mess and bigger ego. But this time, as Sherlock’s things found their way out of boxes, John also brought over his things from the suburbs, and they wove together a life out of books and wires, socks and mismatched cutlery.
20 January 15:09
John and Sherlock, you have made your promises before these witnesses, and in doing so begin the rest of your lives together. May you always believe in each other, and in the love that you share. It now gives me great pleasure to pronounce that you are now legally married, joined for life.
“I love you too,” he murmured, and kissed him again. “I didn’t get a chance to say.”

Sherlock Holmes was languid and content from his post-case shower and fully absorbed in the comforts of 221B. His shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, his feet were bare under the cuffs of his trousers, and a hot cup of perfect tea sat as his elbow as he slouched in his desk chair and scrolled through his inbox, lazily solving a few cases with quick emails.

“Am I early?” Lestrade asked into the suddenly heavy silence that had fallen over 221b.
Sherlock snorted. “Yes, John, I have been through this before, you know.”
Withdrawal symptoms have been absent for a full two weeks now with no relapse. Sherlock reports better sleeping and eating habits over the past four days since completing his not-assignments. I hope to see him continue in this new direction and will consider removing these indicators after one month of healthy eating and sleeping.

“I went too far. I hurt you.”
I’ve given you so much grief about Irene Adler over the years. You were always so dodgy about her, would never give me a straight answer, and I always assumed it was because you had feelings for her but didn’t know how to act on them, or didn’t want anyone to know. I just wanted to support you, if she was what you wanted. Now I know better. I’ll leave it alone. I promise.
John pressed his forehead into Sherlock's temple and gave a weak chuckle. "I thought I was painfully transparent and you were just exercising discretion for the first time in your life."
A weight off his soul, words shared rather than hidden away, and it was the start of a chain reaction he couldn’t control.
Yes, definitely right.
John, will you take Sherlock to be your lawful wedded husband, to be loving, faithful and loyal to him for the rest of your life together?

Before you are both joined together in marriage it is my duty to remind you of the solemn and binding character of the vows you are about to make. Marriage in this country is the union of two people voluntarily entered into for life to the exclusion of all others.
I don’t want you to think I’m ignoring what you said in your last letter. Honestly… I would love to move back to 221B with Rosie. I really would. I’m desperate to, actually. But I can’t have that conversation until after I’m done with anger management, okay? For your safety, and for mine. In the meantime, I have something else that I’ve been wanting to tell you for years. I don’t know how much of this you’ve already deduced, but I’m going to pretend it’s none of it, for the sake of full disclosure.
They could love Sherlock together, he and his little one.
"I can promise you with absolute certainty," he murmured against Sherlock's skin, "that these men are not homophobic, and they would never do anything to harm you in any way. It would be hypocritical, for one, considering their own past behavior. I'd never put myself in this situation if they were, for two. Remember why you’re here? And third," he said, daring one last kiss before letting their hands rest back on Sherlock's knee, "I would never let anything happen to you. I always have your back. You know that."
For good this time.
On his way through the kitchen, he stopped to take a quick inventory of the necessities. The whole flat felt wrong on so many levels, but the lack of tea kettle was an affront that could not be borne. One box, perched precariously on the edge of the kitchen table and marked

John guided him through the sitting room door with his eyes on Sherlock’s dragging steps and quiet, whispered encouragement on his lips.

The snow showed no signs of slowing, had already started to pile up against the outer door. They’d be snowed in by eight o’clock. Mummy and Father demurred at John’s suggestion of an evening drink, pleading fatigue after the day’s walking. Sherlock shot them a grateful glance as they disappeared into 221A, then refocused on John.

That same smile in return, with a squeeze from the hand around his waist. "It's okay with me," Sherlock said again.
"Hey hey hey, Sherlock, breathe, okay? Of course it's not a joke. I would never. Not about this." He cleared his throat and looked away. Guilt. "You know John and I go to the pub on occasion."
I noticed an update to your library records as well.
God, he’d never thought he’d actually have to put this stuff into words. People assumed easily enough, but Mummy obviously wasn’t going to rescue him.

Not a bad idea. Better than watching yet another remake of A Christmas Carol. Bah Humbug. But that still didn’t solve the Johnlessness issue.
John briefly considered discussing the fake relationship thing with Sherlock before they went in, but swiftly dismissed the idea. The whole thing was mortifying enough to begin with, and trying to establish how they'd gotten together and what their dynamic would be like would drag them far too close to true things John wasn't ready to discuss. He'd just stick as close as he could to the truth, hope Sherlock would follow his lead, and try not to put his foot in his mouth.
I can’t believe I can have this.
John pulled Sherlock’s head into the crook of his neck and breathed deep.

Then the phone was thrust into John’s hands. He looked down at it, puzzled.
I was prepared for utter disaster. I was prepared to beg Molly to get me out of there before I drank half the bar. I was prepared to panic, run screaming, get angry and have to use the stuff I learned in anger management.
“Fantastic,” John said when Sherlock deduced the link between the clockmaker and the suspect.
“Figured we could distract ourselves with some crap telly,” John said, shifting another box aside to access the power outlet. A faint click from the kitchen called him back, and John finished preparing their tea—milk, sugar, tea bags out, the most British of solutions to an excess of suppressed emotion. John carried the lot of it into the bedroom along with the food from Speedy’s.
John dropped his bag and wrapped both arms around Sherlock’s lean frame, one hand on the back of his neck, the other at the curve of his waist. Sherlock hesitated, then brought his arms around John’s shoulders and leaned down to rest his temple against the side of John’s head. John’s arms tightened into a fierce hug, and Sherlock was on the verge of cracking wide open, his heart displayed, everything he felt for this man there for all to see.
One. More. Breath.
“You never would have shown up if I hadn’t gotten John to bring you and you know it.” With that, she turned her back on her son to wrap John in a long motherly hug.

John leapt to his feet as if burned and stood there for a moment, stunned, his hands limp at his sides.
“Asking about my therapy sessions, John, really? That’s supposed to be private.” He didn’t truly sound annoyed, though, so John pressed on.
John groaned and let his head fall forward onto Sherlock's shoulder. No mistaking that. This was happening. Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his cock through his jeans outside a pub, panting in his ear about getting fucked. Un-fucking-real.

I know you don’t think much of my skills as a writer but for better or worse, it’s much easier for me to get my thoughts out on a page or a screen than to speak them out loud. I hope you can tolerate my writing long enough to hear what I have to say. So to speak.
The cabbie counted the money, then nodded. "Sure, mate. Make it quick."
Something fierce and joyful bubbled up in Sherlock’s chest, and a smile spilled onto his face.
Sherlock hummed an acknowledgement. John took a breath. Steadied his nerves.
I think I like this new John Watson. I hope you do, too.
Sherlock picked up his champagne glass and waited for John to do the same, then clinked them together. “Well, not completely free. At least, I hope not.”
So, here’s my first offering of honesty:

John’s stomach lurched, but he nodded.
And you should be too, especially after today
It’s truly moving to finally see these two men happy. I look forward to helping them take these next steps together.
I hope you’re well.
Sherlock bit the inside of his bottom lip and glanced away.

Sherlock shook his head faintly.

John smiled despite the nervous hammering of his heart and opened the door behind him. He climbed out into the warm summer evening and held the door for Sherlock, holding out his hand to help him out. Sherlock hesitated for the barest fraction of a second before taking it.
A beat of silence.
as he withdrew a silvery blue envelope. "There you are, now."
So. I’m rambling to avoid actually getting to the point, I know. It’s hard to know where to start.
I can get for you, Doctor?” Mycroft asked. He feigned put-upon annoyance, but John could see echoes of the Mycroft from the plane. The one who, defeated and shaken, had asked John to “look after him, please.” John gestured at the tiny table’s other end.

Things are okay. I didn’t get the promotion, but they said they’re considering me for a different position instead, which would be better hours. Still no girlfriend, but for the first time in my life I’m kind of enjoying focusing on myself, you know?
—though the distance let his mind regain a bit of its former equilibrium.
"How have you been showing him how you feel so far?"
Tonight was perfect. Thank you again, Sherlock. For forgiving me. You truly didn’t have to, and I appreciate it. I promise, I’ll earn it every day. I’ll keep working hard. For you.
Not that it’s a secret. Not for long.
It was barely a murmur, but John heard it.
John’s smile shifted; a bit more secretive, a bit more

John woke to a strangled cry and the heavy thump of a forehead against his breastbone. Sherlock was curled against him, face pressed into John’s shirt as his body trembled, whimpering half-intelligible protestations at some unseen threat. The blankets were shoved to the end of the bed, evidence of Sherlock’s unconscious, thrashing efforts to seek a protective presence.
Well, that sounded simple enough. "Okay, so, he was telling you he loved you in one way, but you wanted to hear it in a different way."
Not even gonna ask.
It was worth it.
“Enough!”
Last one for tonight!
He'd been dreading this trial since the start of the experiment.

The chef pulled a honeycomb frame from one of the hives and offered them a taste, scooped out onto sticky fingers. And somehow, the raw honey here was even more intense than what had been served at their table.
He held out a hand to Sherlock and hauled him out of his chair, catching him when he wobbled a bit. “And we’ll… talk about some things. Okay?”
They went downstairs to join Sherlock’s parents shortly thereafter, following the bright scents of lemon and garlic and the clink of dishes and silverware. They’d barely crossed the threshold before Mummy was on them, ushering them to two seats at the dining table, romantically lit with candles and piled high with food and… presents?
Her first steps happened just after I got home from my class. Sherlock was on the floor with his back against my chair, his legs outstretched, and Rosie stood in front of him with her hands braced against his for balance. I came over, picked her up for a cuddle, then set her back down on the floor, expecting her to crawl. Instead, she stood up and toddled right back to Sherlock and collapsed into his chest.
Sherlock slipped the card from John’s fingers and shoved it to the bottom of the pile of mail.

The corner of John’s mouth twitched.

The particular phrasing grates at Sherlock. "He's not
John grinned at her, then slid a hand up Sherlock’s arm in a comforting gesture. “I am, don’t worry! It’s just for one night. I
Sherlock’s breath quickened. “I think you’d better keep my mouth occupied or I’ll wake the baby.”
But we’re good?

They were silent for a long moment. Sherlock shifted closer and reached a tentative hand across the pillow.

“What is it?” Sherlock said with a little squeeze of his arm.

Mycroft winced and covered his eyes, and John snapped.

“My grandmother used to visit and cook elaborate French feasts for New Year’s Eve and Day when I was a child. I hear Mummy still cooks oysters and scallops. They used to do foie gras, too, before they decided it was inhumane.”
Oh, shut up.
I’m honored to be a Holmes and to give my daughter your name. Thank you for being such great grandparents to her! It was lovely to see you at the wedding.
Do we mere mortals deserve to be unhappy because we’re not as smart? Do we not deserve good things?
Sherlock jammed his goggles down over his eyes with a scowl, and the ice in his voice dropped the temperature in the flat by several degrees. "So go call up one of your past conquests, or go pull some woman of questionable intelligence at the pub and leave me in peace."
Always only him. He’s…
Iain smirked. “Ahh, but that would have spoiled the surprise.”

"You guys planning to stand out in the cold all night?" Molly asked, her cheeks rosy from wine. "Come on in!"
It was a marvel. A revelation. Sherlock caught between his two hands, two fingers buried deep in his arse and a fist wrapped around their cocks, writhing and moaning and chasing his release with tiny pants of

Please do let me know if you require any assistance with the paperwork.
Sherlock picked them both up and handed one to John, who looked up from under his lashes with a shy smile. John held the glass up to the light and watched it refract through the crimson liquid for a moment before cutting his eyes back to Sherlock.
Then the clinking of utensils against pint glasses filled their whole corner of the pub, and John looked up to find the whole army contingent watching them with wolfish grins.

Sherlock’s tiny intake of breath echoed in John’s head, the moment stretching long.
“I’m going to try, though. At Christmas.”
And there they sat for a long moment, staring at their joined hands, both waiting for the other to let go first.
One final chapter tomorrow morning. *sob*
John cried out as Sherlock took his cock in again, his fingers tangling in dark curls and pulling a rumbling groan from Sherlock’s throat.
Then he remembered the box in the sitting room.

Considering my history and the past instability of our relationship, it seems the way forward may be… challenging

contained Sherlock’s microscope and some of the lab equipment he’d made such terrific messes with. John unpacked all of it into a messy heap on the table.
John took a breath and dared to take just one step closer to Sherlock.
"I was missing a crucial data point," Sherlock said, stunned. Then, sheepishly: "This may be one of my primary blind spots."

[They are still for the next 30 seconds. Finally, JW leans in to press a kiss to Rosie’s cheek. SH’s respiration visibly speeds, and he squeezes his eyes shut again, even tighter, as if in pain]
I’ll see you tomorrow morning with Rosie.
There’s nothing desperately unspoken that needs release here, because now when I have something to say I can just talk to you. Because you’re always there. We share a home. We’re family. We have a daughter together. We have a marriage we tend to, work we love, and instead of those desperate letters, we share other kinds of writing now: grocery lists and reminder notes, receipts and bills, Rosie’s health records, our bank statements, your endless library receipts, sticky notes on the bathroom mirror and a hundred other bits of evidence from which even the most hopeless of the met’s officers could deduce our love and our life together.

Sherlock narrowed his eyes and thought back. John had mentioned something about Harry while they were baking cookies the other day, but he’d also stripped down to his vest once the heat of the oven got to be too much, and his
[RW squeals from her pushchair, kicking her legs in excitement when a goose lands and chases away the ducks. SH and JW both smile, laugh a bit, and SH pulls her from the pushchair and holds her close, rocking gently back and forth. He looks at John over the top of her head]
John snorted, shrugging at Lestrade as if to say,
to say! Would you prefer that I stop wearing my suits? Would that make you feel better?”
John has continued his abstinence from alcohol, and his sleep is much less impacted by intrusive thoughts, though increased physical exhaustion may play a role. I will continue to keep an eye on both issues.
Sounds great Bill, would love to once we’re back in town. We’ll be in touch.
“All right, all right, love,” John said, gentling him with soft brushes of hands over shoulders and chest. He hooked one of Sherlock’s legs over his good shoulder and lined himself up, then glanced up and caught Sherlock’s gaze as he nudged himself just barely inside with a roll of his hips. Sherlock shivered at the initial push, his cock twitching at the wave of need it sent to the tips of his fingers and toes, then groaned in frustration when John only circled his hips, barely rocking in and out, shallow,
Their gazes locked, both of them breathing hard through their anger.
John took Sherlock’s pulse every ten minutes, got out his stethoscope and listened to his heart and lungs over and over. The suboxone was taking effect, judging by the slowly unspooling tension between Sherlock’s eyebrows, the gradual creep of his vital signs toward normal ranges, but another half tablet would likely be necessary. Eventually, John gave up timing his vital recordings and lay down beside Sherlock, one eartip of the stethoscope in his ear, the diaphragm over Sherlock’s heart, and two of his fingers firm on the pulse point in Sherlock’s wrist. Tomorrow, if all went well with the medication, he’d likely be well enough to stay awake and would need a better distraction.

“No!” John answered without a second’s hesitation, then shut his mouth with an audible click and pursed lips. Sherlock barely suppressed a grin, and Mrs. Hudson hid a snicker behind her hand when John flushed. “I think the rest of the world frowns on going out in a dressing gown and pyjamas,” John added. “Or only a sheet, for that matter.”
Obviously I don’t have a problem with it
I need to give a huge shoutout to the real hero behind the scenes—
[SH’s lips part and he stares down at JW, pained]
He closed his eyes and let himself drift, remembering the press of John’s lips and body, the strength of his arms, the gleam of joy in his eyes. His body pulled and ached in delicious ways with remembered pleasure from the night before, and Sherlock’s mouth tugged up at the corner of the memory of their first time. And the second. And the third.
Yes, I know, he’s quite silly, isn’t he?
John laughed and scooped a hand under Sherlock’s hips so he could shove a pillow under, then lay down between Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and arched his back as John’s tongue explored
Interesting.
A crossroads.
John squeezed his eyes shut, tilted his head to the side, breathing through the wave of pain. A good man. Right.
“I wasn’t ready for you then, John, and I’m sorry. I’m ready for you now. I’ve loved you, I love you, and I will love you. John Watson,” he said, as if relishing the feel of John’s name on his tongue. “If you’ll have me.”
Jesus, I’m so bloody nervous.
Have you read it yet?
You look different.
John stood next to his chair for a long moment, then grabbed the arm and dragged it closer to Sherlock’s. When he sat, his feet rested between Sherlock’s on the floor. The first tiny confession. He sat back and braced his elbow on the arm of the chair, bringing one knuckle up to tap at his pursed lips.
I’m gay
His task done, John let out a long breath, set down the needle and let his competence and strength and professionalism all bleed out of him, slip between the cracks in the floor, sap the strength from his legs and and his heart. His knees hit the floorboards at Sherlock’s bedside as if kneeling at church, and his forehead dropped to his clasped hands, propped on the edge of the bed near Sherlock’s too-pale hand.

One of John’s hands splayed wide over Sherlock’s belly, dragging over muscle and tracing the lines of his hip bones, while the other dipped between his thighs. Sherlock’s brain tried to feed him anatomy charts, worked desperately to quantify how John unraveled him, until a finger pressed just behind his balls, gently at first, then harder. A rare curse dropped from Sherlock’s lips at the end of a ragged moan, and his brain shut down completely, abandoning the search for pleasure points and reasoning. Sherlock’s hands flew to John’s hair, his hips twitching forward in tiny, shallow thrusts, out of his control.
“Where’d this come from?” he said. “I thought our wine rack was empty.”

Defense mechanism. John's expression softened. "I wasn't sure if you were gay or just... not into anyone. Anything."
“Blue carbuncle?” he asked.

“Okay. Well. Good.” He nodded. “Good.”

And now that I’ve said all that, I also feel like even more of a spectacular arse for leaving you hanging after you wrote me your letter about Irene and Victor and all that, because I haven’t even finished this letter yet and I’m already going out of my mind waiting for your reaction. Which I’m sure will be… well, no, actually, I have no idea. I don’t know if you already suspected, or knew. I don’t know if you’ll even care. But this was a really huge thing for me. This was the source of all my anger, all my self-hatred, my messed up marriage and history with girlfriends and… and more than that, too. This was almost all of it.

John ran the tip of his tongue along his lower lip and turned, finally catching Sherlock’s gaze.
He screwed up his courage, checked his shirt one last time in the bedroom mirror, and descended the stairs to join Sherlock in the sitting room.

As usual, Sherlock spent much of the beginning of our time talking about other people. He spoke at length about his best friend John’s daughter, who he has been spending considerable time with these past few weeks. He appears to be quite the devoted godfather and spent several minutes describing the things he’s bought for her, the things he’s taught her, feeding her, soothing her, and how he feels about her.

If you skipped the last chapter, all that happened other than smut was that John gave Sherlock a bottle of the same brand of scotch they drank on his stag night so they could have a do-over.
Every plane that passed, no matter the direction or distance, he sent love to it. He pictured the troops in their worn fatigues, catching brief snatches of nightmare-pocked sleep in their cramped airplane seats, and he loved them and loved them and loved them. He imagined every bit of feeling, every flutter of his heart, every bit of grit in the lens, all of it pouring from his chest to theirs. His brain to their brains. It was a game he played.

Your advice makes sense. I think I have a friend who could go with me, if you want to send me a few addresses. Maybe a bar or club would be good. Not that I need to be around alcohol right now, but at least I know how to handle myself in that kind of environment. I’d be a bit more comfortable there than sitting around in a coffee shop staring at blokes in cardigans or something.
