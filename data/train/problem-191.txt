But feelings could not to be ruled over, not even by someone like Mycroft with all his infinite influence and power, and no matter how good John looked on paper, Mycroft couldn’t help but resent the man for having caught Sherlock’s fancy to such an extent that he was willing to share a huge part of his life with him, in almost every aspect except the romantic one.
“What
Magnussen raised his eyebrows in astonishment, but Mycroft remained unwavering.
The difference between him and Sherlock though was that the detective would be able to make a deduction out of it whereas John only saw the oddity but didn’t know what to do with it
The brisk night air against my face is a welcome distraction from the aching in my heart and the despair in my stomach.
Sherlock is standing in the middle of the room, so John tells him to sit in the desk chair as he seats himself on the edge of his own bed. For a few long minutes they simply stare at each other - John is trying to think of how to start the conversation, and Sherlock is desperately trying to stop himself from confessing anything else.
“Well, it’s never put
As Sherlock’s lips move yet closer to John’s, he whispers a plea, “John.”
They stare each other in the eye for a few moments before Watson turns away, unable to think of an answer.
“Still old enough to understand why Mycroft was walking with an oddly wonky gait and wincing whenever he sat,” Sherlock mumbled, smirking at John.
“I’m glad you did,” Holmes whispers, eyes prickling with tears at the thought of nearly having lost his best friend, “Thank you,” he adds sincerely.
It wasn't often that John knew something Sherlock didn't. The man might have the world’s most extensive knowledge on cigarette ash and an aptitude for molecular chemistry, but he was also completely ignorant on other topics that he deemed unimportant.
“Extremely,” Watson easily agrees.
John tells Sherlock that he should have contacted him, yet the detective keeps insisting it was for a case as well as deducing that John has started cycling to work. Wiggins makes a comment about how “some guy” hit him, John says it was probably some addict in need of a fix, and Sherlock – quickly deducing that it was John who sprained the arm – agrees that in a way it was.
John hissed before placing his forehead and nose against Sherlock’s, eyes closed in bliss, “Lord knows I will probably lose control soon and fuck you senseless into that posh mattress of yours,” he practically warned, to which Sherlock responded by moaning low and pulsing his body against John’s, “but,” John stressed, nuzzling his nose affectionately, “let me relish this - in finally having you. In being allowed to touch you, kiss you, love you.”
“If it makes you that quietly excited, it can’t be good for me.”
it sounds utterly
“No, he is dating,” Mr. Holmes answered, “He’s bringing him up to meet us next month when they get time off. He says that his boyfriend is extremely busy. High profile job, from what I hear…”
“I’m sorry, a what?” Watson asks.
“Why is Sherlock lying? Surely he discovered the off switch like you did,” Watson questions.
Holmes grips tighter to Watson.
Sherlock splutters, uncertain if this is part of the ritual, but as the men begin to laugh he assumes it’s just a Bill thing, “Thank you, peasant, you may sit,” he answers with an air of poshness that comes too easily to him.
“Uh uh,” John negates with a raising of his left hand and a smile, “you challenged and you do not have the highest ranking coin on the table, so you owe Sherlock a drink.”
“I am aware that I have certain...gaps, if you will, in my knowledge,” Sherlock said, tilting his head and then turning his laptop around to show John a picture of a man bent over with his own penis in his mouth, “Like this. I have never seen this before. Why? Why is he doing this, John?”
“You are such a nerd,” he states with clear affection in his voice and eyes.
“Oh, no way!” Zach exclaims.
“Oh God, does
It was enough; the heat mixed with the touch and his name. With an unbelievably loud and incoherent yell, Sherlock came in his satin boxer shorts, coating the insides with an impressive amount of semen which clung sticky and cloying to his skin and pubic hair.
“Husband?!” Watson asks, looking offended, “Why does Mrs. Hudson assume we’re gay?”
John laughs, “You’re not the only one in the world with a good memory, Sherlock.”
Not that he hadn't missed this. The quiet and calm of his life back at Baker Street which included the mad dashes around London, solving cases, and helping people again. It had been the perfect balm for the trauma and hurt of his failed marriage and the child that wasn't his, not to mention the "death" of his best friend and subject of John's every waking fantasy. Well – sometimes not even
John shakes his head, “Not with my family history in mind. Also, it’s not even
John’s head shakes before he vocalizes the answer, “No, thank God.”
Lestrade rubs his face with his hands and announces, “Yeah, never mind; I can’t do this, it’s too weird,” and he stands from the chair.
Watson laughs as it’s his turn to frame the other’s face tenderly in his hands, “You’re lucky I love you.”
Sherlock disappears downstairs and John returns to reading his Nook - finally activating the backlight. John looks up again about ten minutes later when Sherlock bursts back into the flat with empty hands and a scowling face.
If it’s a dream then it’s a nice one. Sherlock slowly unbuttons John’s trousers and works them down, trying desperately hard not to look or stare (
When the knocking on the front door interrupted our solace, Holmes gave me a look that was a mix of regret and excitement as we pulled our feet back underneath our own chairs, away from the other. I gave him a reassuring smile as we heard Mrs. Hudson greeting the guest before leading them upstairs.
I can understand – I truly can – why you couldn’t bring yourself to forgive my lengthy absence to the full degree that I had hoped you would. I spent so many nights imagining returning home to you, to find you reading in your chair in 221B. You’d get up and punch me in the face, yell about what a selfish arse I had been, and then, just as you tired yourself out, you’d grab my face and kiss me hard.
“Well, it seems to have pushed Sherlock ‘round the bend, as well.”
“How did these get back here? Who got in?”
So with a heavy, tired sigh, John flips over to his left side and pulls Sherlock in to his arms as their legs intertwine almost in a lock. He sighs again, in contentment this time, as he buries his face in Sherlock’s chest.
He remained seated on the ground for a few minutes, just trying to steady his own wildly beating heart, then he became aware of a hand reaching out to help him get to his feet. It belonged to the person who had brought him the medical kit, a man called Freddie.
But he, as I was later informed of, never forgot about me, and he held on to some deluded idea that he and I were meant for each other. As he was not able to achieve that result on his own, he apparently decided to find someone who could help him arrange it for him.
“Maybe you should concentrate on things that you are familiar with instead of venturing off on topics you haven’t the faintest idea of,” he muttered and pushed a terrine of smoked salmon and steamed vegetables towards Mycroft. “You know what our mother used to say: “If your words doesn’t improve the state of silence, shut your mouth and stay quiet.”
“You spoke of some monetary exchange. For me to get back on my feet, resign from my current position, maybe move back home.”
He closed his eyes for a second and when he opened them again he wasn’t alone in the room anymore. A hand reached out, stroking his curls and then caressed his cheek before it ended up with its fingers firmly around his throat.
John’s head was turned towards Sherlock as well and there was worry in his eyes, mixed with something that looked like....anger?
“As the inhabitant I’m interest in, is not inside at the moment, there is no reason for me to join you,” Magnussen said airily, as if he had been invited to begin with.
But there were always so many unwritten rules that he had no clue even existed before he had managed to break them and every time it happened he could see that little hint of disappointment in John’s eyes.
But then he silently turned his head towards the riding crop that John casually held in his grip and nodded, the gesture enough to indicate what he wanted to ask.
As he watched John grow increasingly sleepy, he managed to lure him over to the sofa under the pretence of further snogging, letting his fingers soothingly massage John’s scalp to speed up the effect of lethargy and when the other man finally dozed off, Sherlock carefully arranged his body in a comfortable position on the sofa, draping a blanket over his body, before rushing off to take a shower and change clothes.
“What are you going to do about the phone situation? Magnussen doesn’t know that all of this was because of a case, he will keep ringing your damn mobile relentlessly if you don’t put an end to it.”
“Just saying, you’ve made worse decisions in your life. This might not even make the top three....”
John had fallen straight through the rabbit hole face first and found himself in the company of the Mad Hatter ever sense, with the Cheshire Cat in the shape of Mycroft as some sort of often annoying side-note to his every-day life cohabiting with Sherlock Holmes.
"Is he going by the same arrangements as the other ones?”
“I know you think this is all fun and games having someone like Magnussen by a leach of his own bodily urges while you play him like violin, pretending to focus on finding the vault while in reality dragging this out so you can figure out the identity of that mystery guest you for some unfathomable reason think is more worthy of your interest than the blackmailing Magnussen is doing to innocent people in the meantime. The bane of my life is that I
The corridor in front of him was swarming with people, other doors forced open, someone carrying the still unconscious butler with a surprising effortlessness, as if disposing of a dirty carpet, the limp body  hanging over his shoulder like a rag doll.
What was Sherlock playing at?
Ever since meeting John, companionship had shown its advances against the solitude he had preferred earlier in life, even if the company came in the shape of a murderer. Perhaps it could help him pass the time instead of fretting about how long until he died.
Sherlock opened a door and then strode in, making a welcoming gesture for John to follow.
“Welcome, Dr Watson,” Magnussen offered without rising from his chair.
“We have a little bit of spare time on our hands I believe,” he said and let his eyes meet Sherlock’s, a suggestive tone in his voice. During the Magnussen case it had felt as if his time with Sherlock had been somehow shared with Magnussen, but as that obstacle was now removed, maybe he could get his flatmate’s full attention back again.
“But, Sir...” she began, and Sherlock could imagine Magnussen cutting her off despite trying to not pay her any attention. “Very well, Sir. I’ll tell him,” she resumed meekly and then the conversation was over.
“You’re disappointed.....,” he muttered and scrunched his lips into what looked like a pout and John stared at him incredulously.
In hindsight he had difficulty telling if that feeling had really occurred or if he had only felt it afterwards when dreaming about it, but in the end both the real John Watson as well as his subconscious self did not make that fatal decision but allowed the ridiculous figure on the bed to remain as he was.
“What a good Samaritan you are, Mycroft, always thinking of others.”
Maybe Magnussen was already testing him?
“Oh, I insist. They’re quite the work of art,” Magnussen purred.
But an acquaintance of his introduced me to a solution to that problem in the form of a line of white powder that suddenly made all those things I hated bearable somehow. With that substance in my body I was suddenly the greatest dancer on every dancefloor, I was witty and knew how to loosen up, I became uninhibited in my socialising and I felt like a God some nights.
It didn’t seem likely, but still, Sherlock wouldn’t have minded getting a closer look. If he hadn’t cut Mycroft off from the case, he could have asked him about it, he probably knew if other pairs like it existed, but as the situation was, he was on his own in this.
But the crowd was not very forthcoming, and the only option was to forcefully push his way through it if he wanted to get a closer look.
Sherlock did cast him, as well as the chair, a scrutinizing look when he returned home a few hours later, but he didn’t say anything, so maybe it was just John’s own imagination playing tricks on him, the same way he felt like a bit of a thief when he once borrowed some of that expensive shampoo Sherlock keeps in the bathroom, before going on a date.
“Presumably in the same way you do? By spying on people against their wishes. Keeping them under surveillance.”
Curiously he opened the envelope to take a peek.
In all fairness he had expected Sherlock to be the only companion in the room, but unfortunately, this wasn’t the case either.
His mind was still reeling from the information he had received yesterday, it all felt a bit vague and nothing Mycroft had told him had really cleared anything up. In fact his words had managed to create even more question marks instead of diminishing them and in the middle of it all the brothers lingered in his thoughts, like two vague creatures that tried shedding some light over an otherwise shrouded situation but unfortunately failed to do so.
“How long has this been going on? And what’s the matter with him? You haven’t been particularly informative towards Victor and he is understandably very upset by being denied access to his fiancé.”
Victor Trevor was still going to marry Sherlock, Magnussen was most likely having his way with the groom-to-be right this minute and then he was going to come after John with all the resources and need for retaliation that such a man had at his disposal. What Mycroft’s fate in all of this was going to be was anyone’s guess, but it didn’t matter, Magnussen was going to ruin them all and most likely enjoy himself immensely while doing so.
With his face still turned towards the window, facing away from John, Sherlock asked in a low suggestive voice:
Granted, Magnussen’s office wasn’t too far away, but taking into calculation the London traffic and transportation issues, it was impressive and also very telling. Someone was eager.
“Indeed not.”
need is for you to be gone and leave me alone or so help me...”
As the initial annoyance was beginning to ebb out, he could even see the slight humour in Sherlock producing his own lubricant based on some ill-advised words from Mycroft.
Or maybe his own curiosity was getting the better of him and he only wanted to be privy to some information because it intrigued him to know what kind of man Sherlock would go for. He sincerely hoped he wasn't that immature though.
“And what do you know of it? You're only interest in him is to get him into your bed. You don’t even know him, you have no idea what our life consists of, what we have, who we are. ”
Stunned by the firmness in John’s voice, Sherlock at first didn’t even move but simply remained where he was, a few feet away from John’s quietly seething presence.
But like the rest of the people gathered around the table, the mood was far from celebratory, the only two who looked pleased were the host and then Victor Trevor who beamed from ear to ear with a smug grin that made John turn his eyes away in annoyance at the sight of it.
“I hear dear Sherlock is feeling unwell, whatever is the matter with him? Victor is quite upset about his inability to see his fiancé…” Magnussen had smoothly said and Mycroft had given him the same kind of vague answer that he had offered Victor, knowing full well that Magnussen had the wits about him to know that Mycroft was hiding something and would put his focus on figuring out what it could be.
He could feel his hand pulsating with actual pain and could imagine how the venom made its way through his veins like gasoline on fire, ruthless and brutal in its path, no stopping it once ignited.
The chauffeur was Mycroft’s so he waited for his employer to confirm the order. When Mycroft gave him a short nod he started the car and they were off.
Stamford looked happy to see John and greeted him with a cheery smile as he approached.
Mycroft sighed.
“Of course there isn’t any need,” John growled, anger simmering just beneath the surface. He felt the sudden urge to wipe Victor’s smarmy smile off his face with a well-directed punch but clenched his fists to prevent himself from doing anything rash.
They were all of Sherlock, his naked torso easily recognisable because of a small scar on his scapula that he had received in his early childhood, caused by Mycroft during one of their very rare physical combats.
As if knowing Sherlock’s intentions, Dr Roylott looked down at the wound as well.
John was positively fuming while alternating between starting to pack his meagre belongs into a bag and leave, or simply go down the much more immature route and destroy some of Sherlock’s belongings before leaving, just out of pure retaliation and a sense of well-deserved vengefulness.
Sherlock’s voice came flowing through the darkness like a velvet mist, the familiar timbre pulling at feelings deeply hidden inside of Mycroft.
To his rising dismay John realised that however awful that sounded, there was a possibility that the answer to that question was yes.
“Ok, so if I understand you correctly, Victor came raging into the house, fired two shots to each head but only managed to put his victims to sleep. Did he realise that himself? He seemed quite out of it when I got there.”
That is the only clue they have and under circumstances it isn’t much.
“And why would that be of interest to you?”
“As they should. But keep it that way, no matter what he might try to persuade you into believing. I have known him my whole life and I have yet to learn how to not allow him to get under my skin, he is the only one who can reduce me to a person who occasionally
Despite being the one who had originally come up with this plan himself, he seemed to have forgotten what a loose cannon his brother could be. But despite this fact, Magnussen’s interest was obviously piqued.
Despite the difficulty to see his eyes properly, John could sense that Sherlock looked resigned when he answered.
It was somewhat satisfying to notice that other people could also be rendered speechless by unexpected events, because Victor was clearly lost inside his own head at the moment and had lost his momentum.
“Oh...I see..,” John’s eyes widened as he allowed that piece of information to settle, picturing a mob of angry men in suits raging against Magnussen up in that tower of his back in London.
But the physician in him knows that it’s not the professional way to go about things, especially not with a person who probably could send him to a well-hidden Gulag in a forgotten part of the world, never to be heard from again.
Sherlock had put his book down next to him and now pulled John closer by snaking a finger through one of his belt-loops, clearly not interested in taking about Mycroft when there were other more pleasurable things to occupy himself with.
He had never regretted that decision and had quickly settled into his new environment and the other people who worked and lived around him.
“Know much about that experience, do you?” Sherlock said in a sardonic tone.
Still, Mycroft figured it was worth the effort to ask him to join them if it meant getting rid of Magnussen. Magnussen was hardly going to tolerate the presence of Dr Watson and would therefore likely suggest moving in different vehicles.
That last question is clearly redundant because Mycroft wouldn’t be here if Sherlock was alright, but he can’t think of another way to get to the core of the issue without stating the obvious.
With growing bitterness, John heard Victor’s words continue in the background as he drank heavily from his glass and looked at Sherlock’s motionless features across the table.
The only unknown variables were how painful his death was going to be and the duration of time before he drew his last breath. If he hadn’t been so personally involved in the end result it would have been an interesting experiment to conduct. As it was now, it was simply the tragic result of very unexpected circumstances and unfortunately unchangeable. There was nothing he could do to alter any of it.
But the dilemma of Sherlock’s sudden departure from the scene was a troublesome throwback and something he needed to take a closer look at.
“You need to be a little more specific than that, I’m afraid.”
John swallowed and finally managed to tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s helpless form to look at Magnussen instead.
“You think you could handle this adequately, Captain?”
“That is one way of describing it. But it is of curse never as simple as that when dealing with actual people. Numbers and statistics are all fine and well, but then there is always that unpredictable human angle that muddles it all by bringing feelings into the mix. Case in point would be my own brother, even if he would never admit to it himself. Not only did he bring about this whole disaster with Trevor and Magnussen in the first place on account of some childish desire to acquire himself a friend and then to get back at me for pointing out the dangers of getting involved , but he also managed to drag you into the mess as well, in a very round about sort of way paved with rash decisions that must have caused both you and him many sleepless nights.”
In his delusional and limited way of looking at the situation, the only thing that mattered was that Sherlock belonged to him and how Sherlock felt was of no particular interest.
John didn’t answer and Victor’s smile faded for a second, something hard crossing his features. The silence stretched and for a second it seemed as if John would have no other choice but to come up with a lie, naturally not offering the true reason for his forgetfulness.
Mycroft on the screen freezes on the spot but the live version by the door does indeed make use of his mobility by forming the most curt twist of his lips, taking in the situation in front of him before his eyes switches to himself on the screen.
But there were others as well.
He looked a bit bored to be honest which was yet another detail John felt was slightly odd. This was in honour of his brother and his future brother in law, surely some expression of interest wouldn’t be too much to ask for?
“But we don’t want to annoy him too much. This is bordering on rude, Sherlock.”
Mycroft frowned.
In fact, they had never spoken a single word about anything that had to do with this whole situation that now plagued John so much that he, as soon as he reached his destination, in frustration stormed into the barrack with eyes like thunder and pounded his fists against the wall until his knuckles bled, just to vent his rising frustration.
But there are other places around the world where Mycroft can keep an eye on him, other cities besides London, other crimes for him to solve, other flats where he can keep experimenting, entertain his appalling untidiness, indulge in his interests privately. A place where Mycroft can continue to watch over him through his cameras.
“But what makes you think this will be a permanent state? You said that you feared Sherlock would never come back....?”
Sherlock gave him a pointed look and then nodded towards the overflowing plates on the table.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose in a challenge and before Mycroft had the chance to fully grasp the situation, his little brother had stepped up to him, crossing the line of personal space so much that their noses almost touched. Feeling uncomfortable with this much proximity, Mycroft couldn’t help but step away from the intrusion, involuntarily backing into the chair that was behind him, the unbalance causing him to gracelessly seat himself down in it with a soft thud.
when describing his blackmailing victims could actually be debatable if I was inclined to bother about such things. As the topic is dull enough as it is, I won’t.”
And he could simply not tolerate it.
“Considering the fact that I’m here to help you save your brother it would be greatly appreciated if you could tone down the snark just a little bit....”
Magnussen shook his head.
As expected, the door to the library was open but there was no light on.
Well, technically it
“I’m not. I swear. Believe me, it would have been less complicated if I didn’t miss you, it certainly wouldn’t have felt this embarrassing to admit to such a thing as I would never go through the trouble of saying it if I didn’t mean it.”
“But now....?”
“So, is this enough for you to be willing to offer me something for it? If I corroborate my story with proof?”
“But, by the look of things, I think I’ll have a good chance of getting you to do as I say,” he whispered and then winked before he bent down to kiss those luscious lips that eagerly had awaited his move.
John whipped his head to stare at him.
John recalled what Sherlock had told him about first meeting Victor and how happy but also afraid he had been in the beginning. Happy to finally have a friend after so many years of loneliness but at the same time afraid to lose the friendship as quickly as he had gained it. And then of course Mycroft’s misgivings about getting involved with other people, surely undermining everything Sherlock secretly hoped for when finding someone who was willing to put up with him.
He opened his mouth to say something,
John did his outmost not to let his eyes wonder but that meant that he instead had to meet the other man’s inquisitive stare and as their gazes locked he didn’t know what option was worse, staring into those mesmerising eyes that seemed to penetrate him with profound intensity, or letting his gaze fall down to the more private area of Sherlock’s naked anatomy that were just inches from him and offered an overwhelming temptation to reach out and touch.
“Well,
“Jesus, stop waving the gun around and scratching your head with it!” Watson admonishes.
Sherlock does
John smirks, "It's designed for battery efficiency; since it's just a reader with e-ink and not a smart device, a charge lasts for weeks."
Holmes smiles because Watson isn’t judging him for it, “Absolutely no idea,” he admits and they both laugh.
Holmes doesn’t answer, because he’s entranced by the body language on the screen. He can feel the tension building up.
It didn't take long for John to have breakfast ready. He was midway through the chorus of 'I will always love you' when Sherlock came into the kitchen and clicked off the radio.
Sherlock merely shakes his head, silently agreeing that it was actually quite pleasant.
“I don’t really get a lot of attention from
“He's been a pain in my bottom for as long as I can remember,” Sherlock answered, lip pouting and arms folded.
“Oh!” Sherlock cried, his eyes flickering open and his mouth making a perfect circle, “Oh that's – Oh, how exquisite. How utterly perfect and – and – John? Where are you going?”
Sherlock and John arrive at the Thames and examine the security guard’s body. Sherlock proclaims that the painting - never yet mentioned - is a fake, then explains the mythology behind the Golem. Deductions that place the victim as a security guard. John talks to the guard’s roommate while Sherlock impersonates a guard and confronts the art exhibitor.
“What about ‘boyfriend’?” He asked shyly.
“Stop!” Sherlock shouts angrily.
It was chaste - if such a forbidden action can be considered such - and over far sooner than either of us would have preferred, I like to think. We separated and stared cautiously into each other’s eyes, judging whether the other deemed it a mistake.
“Shut up.”
“So you’re telling me that if I let you eat off of my plate, you would eat more consistently?” He clarifies.
Sherlock looked like he was fishing some long-forgotten information from the very recesses of his mind palace, “Isn’t friends with benefits a thing? What’s that? Let’s do that.”
“Why do people keep saying that?” Watson asks, a flush rising on his cheeks born of the implication of the words.
“But social situations,” Holmes reasons with a look of distaste.
After a few minutes of silence, Sherlock grabs the remote and selects the next episode with a heavy sigh.
“I do not
Sherlock’s brow creases in uncertainty, so John slowly moves his face towards his with clear intent, hand still on his chin to steady them both. John is giving him time to realize what’s going on and back away; he’s taking the risk to finally clear things up. It suddenly becomes vitally important to Sherlock that he take an active role in these proceedings to show his absolute willingness, so he surges forward, eyes closed, and relishes the quiet moan that John makes.
“You brought it on yourself,” Watson intones, sounding a bit bored repeating the same conversation they have had many times before.
“I wonder if John also doesn’t know how to drive,” Holmes contemplates aloud.
“John!” Sherlock moaned aloud as his hands moved to grasp John’s biceps and their bodies moved together of their own accord, clothed erections meeting with too little friction.
John pulls the covers on the right side of the bed up so he can climb beneath them. He lays down on his back and is surprised at how quickly Sherlock curls in to him, resting his head on his left shoulder, his left hand over his heart.
Holmes and Watson immediately recognize the difference: when Watson had married Mary, it was a very small court affair and gathering in their home afterwards. While Holmes had been his witness (best man), there was no call for a speech to be given.
Greg, Sally, and some more police officers arrive at the Tower of London to find Moriarty inside the glass case, wearing the crown jewels and sitting on the throne. He cheekily proclaims that there was no rush.
“The boys?”
“More certifiably insane, you mean?” Watson offers.
that?” Holmes asks in mild horror.
The feelings only grew in intensity as they left their seats and headed back into the main hall where a large band had set up. People milled around them, getting refreshed drinks or chatting with old classmates, but John and Sherlock simply stood - John's arm wrapped in the crook of Sherlock's arm as the
“They are
“I’ll get my pants,” John croaked, licking his dry lips.
“Would you have gone, if you had the chance?” He asked as he turned on the stool to face John instead of the table.
Holmes shifts uneasily on the sofa, feeling that Sherlock is becoming extremely transparent about his feelings towards John, and worrying that Watson will question it. Will he then wonder if all Sherlock Holmes’ care for their John Watson romantically? What is he supposed to do if that happens? Lie and say that
John finally looks over at Sherlock, and the other man can’t help but meet his gaze. For what feels an eternity, they simply attempt to read each other’s minds, willing the other to speak first.
John snorts, “No, best not in case anyone hears you,” he states, noticing the few subtle looks they’ve already garnered thanks to their whispered conversation. He just can’t bring himself to care if they’re disturbed by them; he genuinely needs a distraction this very moment, “Do the saints instead,” he offers, nodding towards some of the stained glass windows, each containing the likeness and name of a different saint.
“Can I get dressed first?”
“Your plan still played out in the background with a few different changes to its original outset. But various aspects threatened to botch up all those carefully laid arrangements, particularly with the interference of Victor Trevor at the scene and then of course the unfortunate event of Magnussen locating Sherlock and bringing him back to his house. Without preparations for different eventualities, both of those incidents could have resulted in a very poor ending for us all. But as we came prepared, these interferences didn’t cause us any disadvantage.”
The way he was informed of this was during his lunch break where there was an incessant buzzing going on among the other men and when he finally managed to catch the gist of what they were talking about he wondered how they knew any of this.
But despite other differences between that situation and this, the two red dots were achingly familiar and however perplexing it sounded, his first though actually was that it looked as if Sherlock had been subjected to a snake bite.
Oh sweet faithful John who always had the combination of a worried look in his eyes with a mirthful twitch of his lips when looking at Sherlock.
“So what if it’s dinner, go eat it yourself! I’m not hungry.”
If nothing else, he might at least find out what happens in the flat when he leaves the Holmes brothers to their own devices.
“Do you really want to bring the police’s attention to your illegal service weapon? Not sure they’re going to side with you as readily as you might think. Accidents happen, triggers get pulled and it is awfully dark out here. Who’s to say who did what when there are no other witnesses around and no one to corroborate your story? That gun is more incriminating to you than it is to me.”
God lord, he was in that obstinate mood apparently, the mood where he was playing difficult just out pure spite. Mycroft didn’t like it, it always made for a tiresome conversation and he was far too tired to indulge in one of those at this hour.
The issue of control was quite obvious in this situation and it was honestly a bit daunting, whatever legal rights Mycroft Holmes claimed to have regarding his right to take an active part of his brother’s health and this didn’t agree well with John if he really thought about it. Even less so if he added the fact that his patient’s future husband was apparently planning to continue in a similar vein, although without the aid of John.
“Why not? Just end the engagement. I know your brother seems intent on you going through with it for some reason, but you can’t live your life trying to please others if it is making you unhappy in the process.”
Impatiently he growled when his sweater deprived him of the glorious sight of Sherlock with his back pressed against the table surface and when finally rid of the hindrance his frustration caused him to pull at Sherlock’s pants quite forcefully, tearing them apart by the hem as well so he got an eyeful of Sherlock’s erect cock, a sight that immediately sent a jolt of excitement straight to his groin.
But instead of asking anything straight out that might cause himself any embarrassment he changed topics and raised the hand that was holding the medical bag.
And what was that about not ever returning?
John watched him intently and actually thought it looked as if Sherlock was physically ill, running a fever or something worse. But Victor either did not notice or did not care, the kiss intensified, and he squeezed his hand possessively at the nape of Sherlock’s neck while John felt his fists tightening under the table at the sight of it.
And even if that would most certainly have led to a row of epic proportions, it could have ended right there and then. But unfortunately, that’s not how it went down.
Seeing Sherlock initially had been a huge relief, but it had quickly turned into shock and actual horror when realising what state he was in. He didn’t seem able to react to John’s voice which was shocking to realise, and the limpness of his body even more so.
Magnussen climbed the now open window, his phone pressed to his ear with one hand while the other held on to the windowpane to keep his balance.
As if savouring a particularly delectable dish, Magnussen practically purred when talking about Sherlock, but the final part of his speech didn't go unnoticed.
Just turn a blind eye and a deaf ear and he could continue pretending that things were just like they always had been and would continue to be, as long as he didn’t try looking too closely or listening to the things he didn’t want to hear.
“Gentlemen, please. I have no intention listening to a discussion befitting a pair of stray dogs fighting over a bone, especially as the subject matter is my own brother. Whatever differences you might have, let’s leave it for the time being and focus on the task at hand. And for further information, no one knows Sherlock Holmes better than I do and my advice to you both is to stay as far away from him as humanly possible, not for his sake but for your own. The man has been trouble on two legs ever since first gracing our nursery and he has never grown out of it, despite my endless efforts to tame him. Hence, that’s why I’m sitting here instead of enjoying a fine glass of Laphroaig in my own sitting room, undisturbed and content. “
No use making an enemy of the man who had helped him out with the ambulance this morning. But still, it was annoying when people insisted on forcing their unwanted company on someone who wasn’t interested in what they were offering. This was part of a scheme to take down one of the most revolting men in the country, not a luncheon at the Café Royal.
It was absurd to even consider the kind of discussion he needed to have with Sherlock eventually, but on the other hand it was one of the few reasons that prevented him from going down the dark path of realisation that Sherlock might be dead by the end of the night and none of this would no longer  matter.
“Well, as I believe I mentioned mere minutes ago, communication is the simplest way of getting the information you want. For a couple about to get married you’re seriously lacking in that department. So, might I suggest talking to Sherlock instead of harassing me? If you don’t believe me, just ask him and he’ll confirm it.”
John had felt a somewhat slow pulse and Sherlock’s breathing was decidedly shallow, his skin glistening with sweat, his skin tone deadly white and then there was the fact that he was close to unconscious, but beyond that.....
He presses play and it is a familiar scenario that springs to life.
But who was he to say anything, when he couldn’t keep his own feeling properly in check?
As he contemplated the person he had talked to mere weeks ago, it was baffling to realise how Victor’s unravelling had begun to pick up the pace now, as once there had been a somewhat distinguished young man, however full of hot airs, he had at least managed to conduct himself in an orderly fashion. Despicable to the bone but still fit to engage with in a respectable manner.
Watson turns to glare at him defensively, “Well, why not? What better way to understand the situation than to observe the evidence?”
wrong?” I smirk, eyes shining with affection.
And now, not only have I laid my soul to paper for you – the only person I have ever dreamed to love – and the woman who took advantage of my absence, you’re asking me to teach you to
John frowned at the tone but agreed without a thought, “Yeah, we can go. I need to use the loo before we do, so why don’t you go and say your goodbye’s to Mr. Ellis while I’m gone.”
All three watch as Sherlock makes mention of the counter still stuck at 1895. Molly and Greg talk about his relationship status – Sherlock says his wife is sleeping with a PE teacher. Molly and John talk about how Sherlock was complaining about John going to see his sister for the holiday – Sherlock says Harry is not actually sober as she claims and John yells at him. Sherlock then deduces the present at the top of the bag that Molly brought, saying that it’s clear she’s in love with whomever it’s for. John, in the background, looks so sadly understanding at her because he knows before Sherlock does who the gift is for. Sherlock reads the label and is caught off guard, apologizes – much to John and Watson’s shock – and places a kiss on her cheek.
Up in 221B, Sherlock and John are playing The Rizla Game: John has “Madonna” on his forehead and Sherlock has “Sherlock Holmes” on his own.
Next, a man who looks like an interesting mix of Jesus and Weird Al Yankovich is running through a forest, is captured, and is then whipped in what appears to be a bunker. The man watching the thrashing is revealed to be Mycroft, and the whipped man none other than Sherlock.
Sherlock withdrew his hand quickly, almost guiltily, as he heard his name again. The thought entered his mind unbidden: his mouth on John. Sherlock moaned quietly as he envisioned it, leaking more precome into his shorts. He placed his left hand on the frame of the door for support as he fought to control his breathing again.
They laugh as Watson pulls him in for another kiss.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded eagerly, leaning further down so his head lay on John’s chest so he could watch the slit in John’s cock widen, “Yes, show me,” he breathed in excitement.
John snorts, looking relieved that Sherlock hasn’t simply run screaming straight away, “Okay, never have I ever held another man’s hand romantically.”
Mrs. Hudson simply thinks it, but never vocalizes it.”
“Now, I know it will matter little to you both, but I do not condone you continuing to watch these DVDs,” Mycroft says as he stands up and straightens his suit.
“Touche, John,” Sherlock laughed, pulling John towards him for a tender kiss.
My face and stomach fall as I tell you to go dance so people don’t start to talk. I know how much you hate it when people talk.
“Sherlock
“Yes, but what if things are happening while we’re both asleep?”
“We can talk about this,” John said.
, but John has nowhere to escape to this time, so just has to bear it, “For the
Watson inhales sharply, his left hand reaches out blindly to grasp at Holmes’ right resting atop his leg. Holmes doesn’t even register that his own grips back tightly.
“I was allowed to come back here briefly to pack up some things,” Sherlock says, which is true.
Angelo waves a dismissive hand as though nothing has sounded more preposterous to him in his entire life, “Please, it’s a gift from all of us to you; we’ve been waiting such a long time for you two to figure it out.”
John looks back in to Sherlock’s eyes sharply. He debates telling him, confessing everything: that he’s loved him for years, that he’s brilliant and adorable, that he has never met anyone like him, that he can’t understand why he chose John over everyone to be close to…but he can’t. Even if Sherlock does remember this once the potion wears off, he won’t say those words now, after so long of holding them in.
“Not compared to you,” he mumbled, already losing the fight to stay conscious.
. Though I guess it is a bit more exciting: war vs jollity and all that.”
?” Watson fires back. When the words finally register for both men, they begin to laugh at the ridiculousness.
“Of course it was,” John tells him sincerely, “it was extraordinary.”
“Ah, John Watson: so easily manipulated in every dimension,” he says with a smirk.
“He loves you, too,” he admits on the barest of breaths before becoming emboldened, “
John moves back imperceptibly before urging, still in a hushed tone, “It’s your turn again.”
“Oh my God,” Watson whispers as realization dawns. Sherlock was taking punches and headbutts while sore, and being tackled to the ground with healing whip lashes on his back.
hands. I think of them on my body, touching everywhere. They would map out every detail as you deduce what I like most, and you would play me with the same incredible knowledge you possess of your violin. Oh, how you would make me sing for you.”
John lets his head fall back to his headboard and closes his eyes.
John walks in to an expansive building and meets Sherlock. They discuss how to gain access: corrupting a key card and then having Magnussen’s personal assistant let them in. The personal assistant just so happens to be Janine, and he does, indeed, propose to her to get her to allow them upstairs.
The theme song ends and the case begins.
Holmes practically hisses as he sees Magnussen; the man still gives him the creeps and he detests the way he prayed on people.
Holmes’ lips quirk up despite himself, “Yes, but Moriarty
“What…?” Is all John can manage to ask.
Mycroft is waiting for John outside of Speedy’s in the rain.
And if John will not allow him to sign his letters, he decides that he will end them all the same from here on out.
Both men are subdued by the knowledge of what is to come.
?” Holmes asks, sitting up straight again as the windows are blown from the flat on the screen.
They watch, Holmes with rapt attention and Watson with amusement at his friend’s antics.
,” Sherlock stresses, “I’m going to see if my presence affects you in any way, even if I’m not sleeping, and also see if your presence affects my own sense of fatigue.”
John looks around the flat and notices the boxes for the first time. They’re messy, unsealed, and haphazard. He puts the pieces together remarkably quick.
After a few minutes of silence, Sherlock whispers the answer he couldn’t before, “I had lost you. My nightmares are always about something happening to you.”
Sherlock and John have been talking with Dr. Stapleton, exposing the glowing rabbit as being in the room with them. The detective uses the information to commandeer use of a microscope, so the three make their way to another portion of the lab. There, Sherlock discovers that the sugar is, in fact, simply sugar and not a drug. He goes in to an explanation of his thought process.
Sherlock doesn’t even answer verbally, simply moves away just enough to remove his boxers and throw them outside of the blanket. John chuckles as he does the same, but then he hesitates in pulling Sherlock back to him, not wanting to overwhelm him.
Gum on the glass, diamond inside it. A little dance and a fire extinguisher to the diamond later, and he’s in.
He could give him that.
“Never have I ever,” Sherlock slurs, his eyes slightly glazed, “put my finger in another person’s anus.”
“Perhaps not.”
“St. Hippolytus - Patron Saint of Hippos and Platypuses.”
“It is,” Mycroft asserts calmly.
Magnussen returns to his home, down in to what appears to be an archive, and finds Lady Smallwood’s file. After refreshing his memory, he finds her in her office and threatens to release the letters that her husband wrote to an underage girl. Magnussen licks her face (to prove that he can) and both Holmes and Watson shudder. Lady Smallwood, on her way home, decides abruptly to seek the assistance of Sherlock Holmes to end the blackmail on her.
“You’re positive there’s nothing else?”
He sighs heavily, “Yes, John?” He asks before he even turns his head towards the other man.
“Bloody
Holmes smiles gratefully before turning away.
Sherlock looks lost, hurt, and confused all at once as he watches John completely remove his jeans before crawling under his thick duvet in the neutral middle of the fort. With a content sigh at the increased warmth - though he’s still overly cold - he pokes his head out of the blanket to stare at Sherlock impishly.
Sherlock smiles sadly at the gesture, knowing John’s train of thought without him even needing to speak. He has not used drugs since the middle of the Magnussen case. As soon as John came back in to his life - including moving back in to 221B after things fell through with Mary - he had no need for them. Love and admiration are the new drugs, and John is his only dealer. He rolls his eyes at his own teenage poetic sentimentality, but John doesn’t notice as he moves back to his left arm.
“You can’t keep them,” Mycroft firmly tells the pair seated on the couch.
John looks off, lost in thought for just a moment, remembering, “Well, most of our troupe didn’t make it through the attack that invalided me home, but of those that did, we’re what’s left of those that were close.”
...or...I
They flash through a number of their cases (The Hollow Client, The Poisoned Giant, the mysterious matchbox case, a generic love affair, and The Elephant in the Room) before Sherlock goes in to full detail of The Bloody Guardsman.
John runs forward, being knocked off balance by a cyclist, disorienting him. He gets up and continues to Sherlock, seeing his bloody face for the first time.
As the second round of drinks are drained, Bill leans back in his chair with a mischievous smile on his face, his hand reaching for the pocket of his jeans. Sherlock is incredibly confused, and remains that way as Bill pulls a coin from the pocket with an air of triumph.
Sherlock hears the faint sound of the door to the street opening and closing nearly silently. Mycroft must have seen her in route via CCTV and sent Lestrade to investigate. Though Sherlock hadn’t ever observed the man to move this silently - he apparently knew exactly which parts of which stairs to avoid so as not to make a single sound - he figures that he must possess these skills to have become a detective inspector.
“I’m going to go look at the room and make sure nothing is going to burn the castle down,” John says tiredly before standing from the bed.
Back to the “present”, Sherlock gets the cue from Mary that his train of thought has crossed over in to the territory of Not Good and attempts to wrap up the speech.
“Yes, Sherlock. And I’ll even sweeten the deal by agreeing to whatever experiment you’re working out in your head if you just, please,
“You might not have found your...um...style,” John blushed and then smiled, “it takes some experimentation.”
“Yes, perfectly calm, I see it now,” Holmes agrees sarcastically.
John grabs his own bag and follows obediently while trying to keep his eyes above the waist, but God does Sherlock’s arse look good in any cloth. Sweatpants, bed sheet, posh trousers, or plain denim, it doesn’t even matter; the man knows how to dress. The deep purple button-down that he decided to tuck into the jeans and roll the sleeves up to his elbows wasn’t going to make this night any easier for John to get through.
Sherlock's confusion has given way to intrigue, "Is that why you prefer it?"
John feels the anger within his chest that he sees reflected on his own face, but at the same time he also feels vindicated. Part of him has wondered if he was being irrational choosing to take Mary down along with Moriarty instead of standing by her…to have essentially chosen Sherlock over his wife. He’s glad to know his choice was right.
“A truly dreadful plan,” Holmes says, deducing Sherlock’s thought process (supposedly sharing a brain with the man, it’s not that difficult).
. It’s not that the nightmares are at all pleasant, because they are anything but, however they tend to leave more of a feeling of loss than of torment these days.
“Yes, but what if things are happening while we’re both asleep?”
“For them, maybe,” Holmes tells him softly, looking him in the eye honestly, not able to keep his true feelings out of his gaze with Watson so clearly upset by the denial of the declaration of love John Watson so deserves from Sherlock Holmes.
Suddenly, Mrs. Hudson appears at the door with a client. Sherlock and John, as intoxicated as they are, keep dosing off on the couch as Tessa relays her story about having dinner with a ghost. She seems extremely unfazed by their lack of professionalism or consciousness. Bit odd, really.
Sherlock can feel John’s gaze appraising his form from behind and smiles smugly to himself.
As John moves his gaze from Sherlock’s face to his bouncing cock, his eyes are drawn naturally to his own left hand. The freckle on Sherlock’s right hip falls just above the knuckle of his thumb, as if approving of the hand being there: making their joining more beautiful.
He sat back on the bed, resting against the headboard in the same position John had chosen. He hadn’t removed his pants yet because he found he enjoyed the feeling of his hand over the fabric separating his hand from his cock. He bit his bottom lip as he traced his outline, but he was only partially hard.
John dismisses the statement with a wave and a shake of his head, “It’s fine.”
hear was Sherlock’s gasping moan after he re-entered the fort and caught him masturbating.
“He’s not jealous, he’s unsettled,” Watson negates, though it’s not true.
And just like that, we were on our way back home via another silent hansom ride.
It must have somehow manifested itself in his appearance because a twist of something indiscernible ghosted across Mycroft’s features as he looked at him.
John felt the pulsating cock slowly soften as he withdrew his head, a tingle of anticipation run through his body as he heard Sherlock’s breathing even out and then return to normal before he nimbly slid down to John’s level on the floor and kissed him, the taste of semen and saliva mixing in John’s mouth as Sherlock’s tongue penetrated his mouth with eagerness, as if not just having orgasmed spectacularly into John’s mouth a mere moment ago. Sherlock’s stamina was always a wonder to behold, the dexterity of his movements a true blessing in John’s eyes.
Mycroft has grown more bored of this insignificant specimen of a man that he ever thought was possible and now he has the gall to invade Mycroft’s personal sanctum as well, making demands no less.
While John was mentally trying to stop himself from ruining the moment by overthinking things, his hands were still occupied with ridding the other man from his trousers while  Sherlock pressed himself against John’s stiffening cock and almost grinded against the friction like a lust-ridden cat, making it difficult for John to concentrate on what his hands were doing.
If Mycroft didn’t comply to his terms, Magnussen would inform his superiors of what we had done. I would end up in jail for stealing state secrets and Mycroft would most likely join me on account of the forgery as well as aiding and abetting a crime. He would also lose his position for helping me out. In his eyes I think that’s even worse than ending up behind bars.”
Then he nimbly jumped down from the window, the dressing gown billowing around his ankles and the knot that was holding the garment together looked like it was about to slip loose.
He took a deep breath and collected himself, straightened his back as well as his shoulders in resolution. Enough of the wallowing, eyes on the prize and just get on with it, Captain Watson, he thought, bracing himself for whatever was going to happen as he stepped into Magnussen’s office tonight.
Sherlock felt no moral ambiguities when it came to anything, morals and good manners where for simpletons and boring people.
But it was clearly no use telling Mycroft any of this as he had decided that Sherlock wasn’t going to succeed with the case and maybe it was gentler to just let him believe that he was right, shedding some of the heat he was putting Sherlock under by sticking his nose into this.
In the shock from realising that Sherlock wasn’t waking up, he blurted this observation out, along with a lot of other things, among them many curse words over their utter helplessness of the situation. Mycroft had grimly nodded his head and when finally regaining his voice enough to speak, he admitted that while searching the house he had happened upon a terrarium in one of the rooms, as well as some other....unpleasant features.
“He’s been through quite a lot of doctors along the way, never quite finding the right fit, but you seem to carry some magic talents when it comes to dealing with him, considering how long you’ve lasted. Mycroft says you saved Sherlock’s life and that it was how you initially met, so let me begin by offering my gratitude for that. It might also explain why he accepts you more readily than he did the others.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow in question.
“And you do, do you? I
“But then after all, there doesn’t need to be more than just a little bit of bad luck for things to go catastrophically wrong. As I’m sure your former patient could attest to, if you were still on speaking terms. Ready to turn his life into hell, Dr Watson?”
John seldom felt any reason to fear that his friend would find interest in someone else and he certainly didn’t have to worry about Magnussen on that regard and yet...
But if he had hoped that a change of focus might stave off whatever it was Sherlock had in mind at the moment, he was sorely mistaken. In a voice that practically purred with sexual inuendo in such a manner that it sent a tingling jolt straight to John’s groin at the sound of it, Sherlock declared:
Then suddenly John was gone again and even if he had realised that it must have been a hallucination all along, he still felt surprisingly saddened by imaginary-John leaving him to his own misery.
But Magnussen had been around long enough to know that everyone had their pressure point ready to be used in a downfall. And deliciously unpredictable Sherlock was just the perfect candidate to help with this particular achievement.
, John though headily, getting even more fodder for his fantasies now apparently.....
Even if he had not been tied down, he would not have managed to escape in this feeble state.
But Sherlock simply shrugged, unaffected
“March over to that wall and spread your legs!”
“How very dramatically put.”
It didn’t even require that many details, good lies didn’t have details, Mycroft had taught him that years ago. He had simply omitted the part about the handcuffs, him hanging by the wrists, turning the whole thing into a more innocent version where the reason for his undone shirt had been an accident with spilt water.
Magnussen raised a hand to make a vague dismissive gesture that signalled that he wasn’t interested in hearing anymore excuses.
“Hardly. The idea of sitting permanently glued to an office chair is not exactly an alluring prospect. At the moment I’m idling away as my brother would say, trying to find something worthy to occupy my time.”
He wasn’t especially interested in what sort of sexual kinks his brother got up to in the bedroom with his loyal army doctor. Deciding to change the topic quickly, before Sherlock decided to tell him even more, Mycroft turned away and walked a few paces to put some well-deserved distance between them.
“Well, we are as close to catching him unguarded as we are possibly going to get, seeing as we are standing by his bloody gate and there is probably someone looking at us right now. Since you two refuse to risk ruining your fancy suits by climbing the gate, I don’t see many more options than to actually call and announce that we are here,” he sneered.
“You want to do the examination in
John panted from exertion as he looked at the shambles in front of him and the sound of a satisfied snort escaped his lips which was ironic as he simultaneously realised that this was simply a petty revenge that wouldn’t even put a dent in whatever plans Magnussen had in store for all of them.
“We’re making a stop at my brother’s flat to pick someone up who will be interested in coming along,” he said coolly, secretly wishing that this actually was the case. Considering John Watson’s state of mind when last seeing him, it wasn’t a given that he would be interested in joining them.
It was a conundrum that he was constantly contemplating  at the back of his mind, because now that he had relished the taste of owning both Holmes brothers, the thought of being deprived that pleasure did not sit well with him. But for now, no further ideas had presented themselves.
“I didn’t want to disturb, I just.....is there any further news?” he asks.
As he stepped out of the barrack his eyes failed to see anyone.
Meanwhile Sherlock continued to explore his cock with his eager tongue, swirling it around the glands, lapping up the precum that leaked from the slit before it returned to move up and down the shaft with increasing pace as John panted heavily on top of him, his grip around Sherlock’s curls tightening from pleasure.
The actual house was surrounded by a few plain-looking beeches as well as the hint of a garden that stretched out at the back, but the main impression was that not a single detail was particularly memorable and that the whole place almost looked empty. Not so much as a bird in sight.
Shortly before the end of the shift he walked out for some refreshment along with a few of the others and as they approached the water fountain outside there was a small gathering of people surrounding the same shiny silver car he had seen arrive earlier.
Mycroft rose from his bed and went over to the window where dark clouds were implementing the feeling of doom that lay over the place, accompanied by thunder that was much closer than he had predicted. Suddenly lightning flashed across the early morning sky and the ominous rumbling followed shortly after.
He slammed his napkin down on the half-eaten plate in front of him, causing the cutlery to rattle.
John had dryly informed him that whoever provided him with that treat perhaps hadn’t been informed that he expected ginger nuts with every cup from now on, whereupon Sherlock replied:” What person would that be? Tea and biscuits just wait for me whenever I’m ready to have them, I’ve never once seen anyone being in charge of arranging for it”, which was Sherlock’s way of saying that if things were not particularly important or interesting, he didn’t pay them any attention. He wanted ginger nuts with his cup of tea but wasn’t particularly interested in how they got there.
The door to the street opens forcefully and feet bound up the 17 steps. Sherlock stands from his chair, heart racing as he imagines John finally,
My left hand clenched at my side at his tone, but I struggled to keep the offense I felt off of my face lest it arouse his suspicions. I saw Inspector Lestrade glance warily at me out of the corner of his eye before he chuckled half-heartedly and agreed, “Yes,” quite awkwardly.
Almost immediately John, Alan, and David have their challenge coins out of their pockets and on the table in front of them, but then John turns to Sherlock, “Fuck,” he says in resignation, but then lights up with a memory, “Sherlock! Quick, grab my wallet from your coat,” Sherlock moves to stand, but John’s hand on his arm makes him pause just after rising; they lock eyes and John looks incredibly serious, “You must reach it in only one step and one reach. Can you manage it?”
They settle, relaxing into the warmth of their cocoon and letting themselves drift away until Sherlock is snoring softly, his breath fluttering the hairs on John’s chest. It’s completely perfect until the power comes back on with a start, the central heating immediately kicking in with a thrum of activity and a clanking of old pipes.
“They couldn’t,” Sherlock quietly agrees.
This idea was thrust upon me quite cunningly by
“There are a few reasons I can think of, but I don’t know which is correct,” he admits.
Holmes searches his eyes for a moment before realization dawns, “The fall.”
John pulled him down again for another intense kiss, like the ones they shared in the back of the car. Sherlock began to walk them towards the bed as his hands removed John’s jacket before moving to pull his shirt from his trousers.
John walks out in to the night and sees the Morse code message again, so he goes to investigate. What he finds is quite mentally scarring and he’d rather delete it but doesn’t know how.
“Mary?” Watson whispers in shock. Holmes doesn’t respond.
You move silently towards your chair, still where it belongs, and I move to mine. We sit staring at each other for a few long moments before you speak up again.
Sherlock closes the distance between them faster than John is prepared for, his mouth claiming the doctor’s.
John turned off the TV and scratched at his belly. Sherlock was sleeping with his face crushed into John's neck, a thin line of drool settling on his skin as Sherlock murmured occasionally. John picked up on certain words; his name, for example, followed by 'idiot' or 'fish-skin' (which boggled John's mind as to what Sherlock was dreaming). Deciding, in the end, that it was probably better not to know, John curled his arm around Sherlock and kissed the top of his head.
“One of my experiments that doesn’t yet have a name,” Sherlock answers, then adds, “May not ever have a name; this is unbearable.”
“Yeah, that line sounds familiar,” Watson muses with a wistful smile.
“John, you must understand: there were events in Sherlock’s past, during his less than coherent times, that went incredibly poorly for him. Haven’t you wondered why he has no recollection of masturbation?”
Sherlock can’t think of anything to say as the pints start lining up on the bar. Zach sees John and David leave the loo and takes a calculated risk, stepping yet closer to Sherlock and laying a hand on his arm.
,” he stressed with clear intent.
kissed a man; never for a romantic or sexual reason, but sometimes using his looks was the best way to find out information on cases. Not that Sherlock would like to admit that, of course…
“Were you there?” Watson asks in that quiet tone that indicates true anger.
“I don’t think you truly understand what it is that I do when I deduce,” Sherlock informs him seriously with a glower, “All I have is a name and what may or may not be an accurate depiction of someone who may or may not have ever existed.”
“Normally I wouldn’t,” Sherlock admitted, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly, “but you looked so devilishly handsome when you kicked the murderer in the face that I got a little...
We're thinking of surprising you with two chapters today!
“Oh, Watson, please don’t talk to me in that tone of voice.”
Holmes stares at him calculatingly, as though putting pieces together.
Holmes tilts his head in a considering pose before answering, “What if it…God, that sounds idiotic.”
Time has passed that he has no recollection of.
Sherlock begins his speech by pointing out everything that he deems to be wrong with the idea of marriage in general, and the look on John’s face clearly shows him contemplating if Mike or Greg
Sherlock is right, because of course he is.
John smiled reassuringly at him as he moved to support him once more. Sherlock was magnificent like this, and John thought it a damn shame that the younger man had never allowed himself to experience this before. He was beyond chuffed that Sherlock had chosen him above all others.
The older man’s face tightens in determination, not daring to look away from this woman who has already taken so much from him. Mary has turned her head slightly towards John, but her eyes and gun have stayed steady on Sherlock.
“I said
Holmes smiles triumphantly.
Faintly - but not too - the pair in the kitchen could hear Mrs. Holmes’ voice shouting to Sherlock.
“Well, tonight will certainly take a bit of acting for your friends not to completely despise me and kick me out of the group within five minutes,” he smiles while grabbing his coat and draping it over his arm, “but I’m quite good at what I do.”
“Oi! I knew this would be a terrible idea,” John jokes before asking Sherlock, “Pint?” Sherlock makes a face of disgust, “I know, not your favorite, but it’ll be better than drinking scotch all night.”
Later, Sherlock and Janine practice dancing. She’s still attempting to flirt with him a bit, but he’s still politely turning her down. John joins them, joking about Sherlock pulling with Janine, even with an attempted murder at the reception. Greg enters, leading the photographer back in to the building. It is revealed that the photographer was the killer, and then they make their way in to the dance hall as Greg arrests him.
John takes a cab back to 221B (
As Sherlock drinks his scotch (of surprisingly high quality) and the others focus on their third beers of the night, the talk turns to current life events: jobs, hobbies, significant others. It’s the topic John had been fearing the most, and Sherlock finds himself naturally - if a bit subconsciously - inconspicuously placing his right hand on John’s left thigh in comfort. He feels John tense initially, but then he settles quickly into it, almost leaning into the touch.
“Are you not weirded out by this? I mean, that man looks
“Sorry about that,” Watson apologizes for the both of them before standing to retrieve their phones from their respective bedrooms. When he reenters, Holmes is nearly done efficiently (read: quickly and impatiently) explaining about the DVDs.
“You’re telling us that these are from…another version of ourselves in another dimension?”
Holmes and Watson realize it, too, and start to have to face how their (Holmes') past actions have affected them (Watson), and how it's changed their relationship overall.
Outside the door, Sherlock’s brain had skidded offline. He could still hear the sounds of John’s self-pleasure. The slick sound of flesh combined with John’s deep groaning seemed to echo around Sherlock’s mind palace, spreading out and sticking to every surface so that Sherlock was unable to walk the corridors without hearing his name being wantonly moaned.
he seems extremely unconcerned by his nearness to fame. Sherlock questions why John cares what people think of him, but he avoids the question.
Flash forward to Christmas and a celebration they’re hosting in 221B that Holmes and Watson never did. Sherlock is playing the violin, John is in an ugly jumper, and all around everyone appears to be having a grand old time. Sherlock tries to thank John’s new girlfriend and ends up insulting her by going through the list of all of John’s recent paramours while trying to remember her name.
It doesn’t depict it on the “show” for some reason, but Holmes and Watson remember perfectly how they reached Kitty’s place.
“No idea how Moriarty knew what Magnussen saw when he looked at people. As we both are aware, Magnussen simply
He started, and I cursed that infernal comma. That makes twice now, but I have seen many a man make the same, meaningless error many more times than two before.
The door was closed, which was out of the ordinary for the middle of the day like this, so Sherlock paused on the top step with a furrowed brow and a slight tilt of his head. With his keen ears, he could hear the unmistakable sound of skin-on-skin and the moans that John was obviously trying to muffle.
After another minute of pursuit, the murderer changes tactics. He stops suddenly and doubles over, causing John to fly over him on to the pavement. John groans as he lies on his back, attempting to get his breath back. Before he can, the suspect has him standing in his arms, held steady as a knife is placed against his neck hard enough to draw a bit of blood.
They arrive at the scene where Sherlock breaks in to Soo Lin Yao’s flat before Holmes speaks again.
“Not much different than usual, then?” Sherlock teased, rubbing his nose against John’s arm affectionately.
John stands before offering his hands to Sherlock and aiding him up to his feet. Sherlock knows he’s simply meant to turn around and kneel on the couch so that John can have access to the marks on his shoulders and back, but he can’t help but to pull John flush against him and kiss him hungrily first. Sherlock presses his cock against the other man, but hisses slightly at the discomfort of coming in to contact with the other man’s trousers. He removes them efficiently, but before Sherlock can do more than appreciate his nudity, John gives him a wicked smirk before turning him to face the couch and purposefully pressing him forward.
“I called out for you,” you admit before allowing your gaze to fall to the floor, “like I used to.”
You can follow KittieHill on
John stands and slowly comes back around the chair so that they are face to face. He keeps eye contact as he places his knees on either side of Sherlock’s hips, his hands on the other man’s shoulders. And then he continues in a soft seduction.
And right there, in the light of day with the door open where Mrs. Hudson could stumble upon us at any moment, I kissed Sherlock Holmes: the love of my life.
He falls to his knees, eyes that are filled with despair tracing the pattern on the rug beneath him. She steps yet closer.
“No, then you’ll come and be
“If you’d like,” he nods in agreement, affection beginning to shine through the caution.
The truth about my life is that I’ve never been very good when it comes to people, but I have always longed to find someone to spend my life with, just like everyone else.
“You could always just leave,” Watson says innocently before bringing their joined hands to his lips to place a kiss on the back of Holmes’.
Holmes turns to him in shock, “
“I already know you love me,” he delivered with a quizzical tilting of the head.
“Oh no, princess,” John teased and Sherlock awoke more fully to become properly offended, “you’ll need to walk. But I’ll help support you.”
John questions Sherlock’s mood and tells him to go apologize to Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock refuses, of course, and then starts talking fast and crazy about how he needs a case. John, growing frustrated, shouts back that he’s just solved one.
Sherlock’s brain works around the information as John falls back in to a comfortable, warm slumber. It’s some time before Sherlock speaks up again.
Sherlock freezes, unable to believe that he’s understood this part correctly, even with the honesty of every other answer.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock breathes out heavily, longing to bridge the small gap between them.
Holmes laughs, “Must be a universal opinion of Sherlock Holmes’ everywhere.”
John lifts the left corner of his mouth slightly at that, “Will you keep leaving me out of the loop of important information? Will you run off and leave me to think you’re dead for two years, let me mourn you long enough to have to move on, and then come back like you did nothing wrong?” By the time he ends the question, his eyes are hard with a mix of anger and despair.
“There’s no rush; there’s all the time in the world,” John assured him.
But instead they separate, agreeing to order some food since it is now nearly 3:30pm. They’ll continue the DVDs once it’s arrived.
Magnussen tells them that the end goal had been to get at Mycroft, whose pressure point is Sherlock, whose pressure point is John, whose pressure point is Mary. Sherlock hands over the computer, but refuses to give the password until he’s gotten all physical evidence the blackmailer has against Mary.
Follow me on
When you’re ready to stop being an idiot…
John and Mary exchange words of settlement and John has a face - when she can’t see him - that clearly speaks of discontent.
“I know, it’s a bit tight,” John said breathily, his cock fit to burst, “just need you to relax for me. Bear down…like you’re using the loo. It’ll help.”
“Ye--ees,” Sherlock sighed, “Honestly John, it’s not exactly news.”
Sherlock’s head tilts to the left in confusion, “Of course I am. You said you would consent to the experiment I thought up, and I’d like to begin tonight,” he ends by sounding defensive.
“Hey, wake up, sleepy-head. We need to go to bed,” John whispered, gently rousing Sherlock from his sleep.
“To what are you referring?” He asks petulantly.
“I forgot about that part,” Holmes admits.
John merely sighs quietly, an uneasy feeling in his gut, and echoes the sentiment back.
Henry is running through a field at night, gun in hand as he tries to evade the hound that’s following him with glowing red eyes. He turns and takes a clumsy shot at it, but then he’s suddenly back in his house. He tried to shoot his therapist. He apologizes profusely, looking at the gun in his hand as though he just noticed it was there, and then runs away.
do it.”
“You have truly never doubted me?” Holmes asks seriously.
,” he stresses with a small pout.
“Oh!” Sherlock cried out, his hands moving to John’s thighs to grip them tightly, his nails causing half crescents in the skin, “Oh, John! Oh that’s...”
They share a smile, Watson squeezes the other man’s hand, and then their hands both drop as they turn back to the telly.
“My darling!” Mrs. Holmes cooed, throwing her arms wide open and grabbing Sherlock into a tight and unavoidable hug. John watched with a warmth in his chest as Sherlock returned the hug, resting his chin on his mother’s head, “I’ve missed you, my darling boy! Your father is in the rose gardens, he wouldn’t move until he removed all of the pesky greenflies,” she tutted and rolled her eyes, “You know how he gets.”
John glares at him defensively, “Well, why not? What better way to understand the situation than to observe the evidence?”
“That’s a bit of a weird choice,” Watson says, eyes calculating again.
“Alright, you arse,” John huffed, walking to make a coffee, “You better have an early night tonight. It’s an early start in the morning.”
“I emphatically insist that the beard really
“She was yelling up towards your bedroom,” Holmes answers with a calculating look, deducing the trajectory.
“Dammit, enough of that now,” John ordered, his thrusts taking a decidedly more deliberate rhythm.
“Hey,” John said, “can I come in?”
“He’s jealous,” Holmes states conversationally.
Holmes reaches to pause the credits, then looks back to find Watson glaring at him.
“You did well today,” John praises.
Sherlock first asked, “Is that a unicorn?” to which John responded, “Watch out for Voldemort, he needs the blood.”
“Oh shut up.”
Sherlock ignores the statement, instead demanding: "Let me use your laptop."
As improper as it was - equal parts folly and blind madness - I reached up to kiss him then. I caught him a bit off guard, this man who misses very little, but within moments he was pressing his mouth firmer to mine as I felt his hands on my back pull me closer.
Holmes looks perplexed, “Really?” he asks disbelieving.
Henry remembers the actual events of that night: his father fighting a man, not a hound. There was a gas mask on the attacker, and his shirt proclaimed “H.O.U.N.D.” He’s stunned at the realization and John takes the opportunity to remove the gun from his loose hand as Greg arrives in the hollow.
“It’s a good question…just part of the creative process for Moriarty?”
except fondly amused, but he couldn’t bring himself to care about what the appropriate response should be. Instead, he merely shook his head while performing his high-pitched giggle, “If I didn’t love you…” he let escape without realising.
were alive!” He yells, the pain from the old wound bubbling up without permission, “I begged you not to be dead.
“Someone once told me that skin to skin contact is the best way to treat hypothermia,” John says as a way to distract himself from the beautiful sight before him.
“That's lovely,” John said, allowing Mr. Holmes to put the albums away before they changed the topic of conversation.
Sherlock huffed at the lack of specifics and pushed John off of him, “Strip,” he ordered.
He’s been working on a potion for the last couple of months that combines amortentia and veritaserum. The main goal of the mixture is to aid those in honestly finding their true love versus creating false feelings. The amortentia will help the user to discover those smells associated with the one they love, and the veritaserum will force them to be truthful about it.
Mass texts of “Sherlock lives” and then they’re in a bedroom with Mary and John. Mary is reading from John’s blog as he lathers up in the bathroom. She teases him about shaving off the moustache.
“You’re just jealous,” Watson goads.
“He misses him,” Holmes observes, feeling a pang of sadness for his counterpart, “that’s why he keeps imagining him speaking: he wants John to be a part of cases again.”
“I think you need to speak to your brother. There may be friction ahead…” Greg explained, rubbing his eyes tiredly, “I think he’s starting to remember his sex drive.”
Sherlock texts him on his way back towards town, asking him to interview Henry’s therapist, Dr. Mortimer. He even sends John a picture of her to entice him to go speak with her. Of course John does.
Which is how John and Greg ended up gaping at Sherlock, their mouths slack and their eyebrows almost at their hairline as they watched grainy CCTV from the house of a murder victim. The murderer was outside the living room window, his face covered with a mask whilst his trousers were pulled below his buttocks, and his hand moved frantically on his cock.
“You don’t know that,” Holmes calls him on his bluff.
Then there’s the scene at Angelo’s.
Magnussen comes to the flat to discuss business. His henchmen frisk Sherlock and John, discovering the tire lever still in John’s trousers.
Holmes turns to look at Watson’s face, but the older man does not return the gesture, simply stares resolutely at the screen. They watch as Sherlock asks John what he’d say if he were dying, the genuine – if quick - look of regret afterwards, Sherlock’s belittling of an entire room as he explains his findings, and then as he follows the murderer out of the flat without so much as a code word to anyone.
than he had originally bargained for. This may be an exhausting evening.
Like Sherlock and his dancing, this song has been following me, and I've been living in hope of the right (case) fanfic. It may have taken 11 years, but I finally managed it! But seriously, two roommates where the closeted (yet obviously) gay one is hopelessly in love with his supposedly straight roommate? COME ON!
John’s reply is drowned out by the sound of running water as Sherlock rinses his mouth. The taller man enters the living room with a disgruntled look on his face.
Sherlock is playing the violin piece from the beginning of the “episode” that he wrote for John and Mary. He makes another impromptu speech pledging to always be there for the couple and ending on an unexpected deduction about Mary being pregnant. He cues the DJ for the music to start and goes down to talk to the pair.
“You’re going to see how much you can interrupt my sleep if you’re awake the entire time versus asleep?” He snarks, extremely displeased at the prospect.
“John.”
“We were on a case!” John said, helping Sherlock to sit on the edge of the bed before crouching down in front of him, “I didn’t think you’d want to be distracted.”
“Does John seem a bit more hot headed and impulsive than usual to you?” Holmes asks.
; I don’t know how.
Watson nods once and turns away, grabbing the remote off the table.
This is another part that Moriarty must have taken cinematic liberties with, for how could he have possibly known what went on in Sherlock’s mind here?
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John breathed, his own cock giving a twitch of interest, something not missed by Sherlock who switched to his best and most innocent eyes.
Mrs. Hudson is banging around her kitchen, showing her displeasure with John’s long absence from Baker Street. She gives him honest advice about the moustache aging him and he tries to be polite, knowing she’s still a bit hurt he hasn’t been emotionally able to return over the years. They talk about how hard it’s been for the both of them, how much things have changed over that time.
And though Sherlock couldn’t put voice to the feeling yet, he felt his chest swell with love for this stoic, brave, kind man.
“No, that won't be necessary, will it, John?” Sherlock glared as his father stood up, moving to the large bureau in the corner.
The following hours pass silently as Sherlock types away on both computer and phone, and John reads and stokes the fire as necessary.
“Yes. Stop asking,” Sherlock grumbled.
They make their way back to his office and he helps her to sit before turning back and closing the door. When he turns back around, the entire facade has been dropped.
Sherlock and John lock gazes, both frightened by the change that this will bring. They could easily pretend that the marriage wasn’t going to change their friendship, but a baby? They can’t deny the change about to occur in their lives any longer. They look away from each other and Sherlock’s (forced) smile falls in to a look of uncertainty and abandonment.
Watson spares a moment to think about what it would have been like to have Mary around for longer than three weeks after Holmes’ “death”, or to have found her shortly after it like John had. How different would it have been to have her support through it all, instead of the distraction of her illness? God, the guilt he still feels, nearly three years after the fact, of having cared about Holmes’ death more than Mary’s is staggering.
“Oh,” she blushes further in embarrassment, “I just assumed from your interactions and…” she trails off, gesturing to their outfits.
Both men flinch at the memory of Moriarty and all of the hardships they endured because of him.
“What is your sister’s name?”
Mycroft turns in the doorway, never being able to resist a touch of the dramatic, “You have no idea how this could change things.”
“Ouch,” Sherlock winced. Obviously he hadn’t intended on speaking as he froze and looked at John nervously.
“There you go, now just do what feels good,” John supplied, trying not to think about how his own cock wanted to stir back to life at the sight and sound.
I read the text messages, sent at such a late hour on a Friday that you must either be inebriated or fighting with your wife. I sigh heavily, allowing my head to drop to the back of the couch as my eyes close against the pain in my chest.
When you’re ready to stop fighting this stupid battle of who could care less…
What must be the next day, Mycroft is reading a newspaper in The Diogenes Club that proclaims his brother’s death. He sets it down and places his hands to his lips, just as Sherlock tends to do when in thought.
John rolled his eyes in exasperation, paper falling to his lap as he sighed heavily, “I
“Now be a good boy and do as I have asked. If nothing else, it will give you the opportunity to meet a blackmailer and see how spends his time. I would have thought it would pique your curiosity, as you seem to like surrounding yourself with criminals on a regular basis.”
It’s so inclusive in fact that it isn’t even certain that he actually has Sherlock, if not for the glaring point that they both seem to have vanished at the same time.
“I spent a rather fascinating time with your little brother last night, Mr Holmes,”
“John, let me carry him. We need to pick up the pace. He needs antidote and probably oxygen, and whatever else required in this situation. You’re slowing us down!”
The doctor made an indifferent shrug with his shoulders.
John’s face came closer again and it felt like Sherlock was now being lifted from the bed, the feel of John’s arms around his upper body sending a familiar comfort through him, for a second taking precedence over the pulsating pain.
And this was the part John realised was a detail that perhaps could work to his advantage.
But if it was so easy to turn on the charm and the pretended affection, who knew how much of Sherlock’s fondness for John was the genuine thing and not just a ploy to keep him by his side, exploiting his love as a means of gaining control over him? As long as John loved Sherlock and desired him, adored him even, he wasn’t going anywhere and Sherlock could keep his trustful companion and never worry about John leaving.
Seething with anger, Mycroft decided that Pemberton would be dealt with accordingly and not grace the halls of the Foreign Secretary ever again. At least the information that Sherlock and Magnussen had been seen together served as confirmation that the plan was ticking along as it should, and shortly after, Mycroft left the banquet.
Sherlock immediately  feigned ignorance.
He had borrowed a bicycle from a co-worker to get there and discarded the vehicle next to a bush before walking the remaining overgrown path leading up to the cottage, wondering how Sherlock had managed to make his way here without getting noticed. For some reason, using Mycroft’s car did not seem like a good option if he wanted to be discreet and there had been no tire marks on the somewhat muddy ground surrounding the place,
“Was all you needed to hear to be able to see the whole picture as if being here yourself to see it. Bloody hell, what kind of people have I gotten myself involved with.”
The bewilderment must have been obvious in his features because Sherlock looked at him and then at the room as if seeing the mess for the very first time through another person’s eyes and then picked up a few papers as if to stuff them away, only to realise that there was no place to put them so he simply put them down again on top of an already staggering  pile of old magazines.
He kept redialling every other minute despite knowing that Mycroft wasn’t going to pick up. But somehow it kept his panic in check sufficiently enough to prevent him from just losing it.
And as if choosing this precis moment by sensing the suggestive tone between them Sherlock's dressing gown conveniently slipped down one of the shoulders to expose a firm naked arm beneath and Sherlock’s smile widened.
“What??!” John cut him off, his voice raised now, his face seething with rising anger at the thought of being just one in a long line of people Sherlock had seduced. “You slept with all of us?”
He had been in the army, for God’s sake! A bratty flatmate five years his junior should not be a challenge!
“Of course it was. Do you really think Mycroft voluntarily would stoop so low as to come in person and ask you to come back when he cold have easily replaced you with one of his own goons the minute you walked out of the door? Fortunately,
“But considering everything he has.....” Sherlock began but Mycroft raised a hand to stop him from going any further.
“What’s going on here?”
“And I brought company.” Magnussen added when the silence just seemed to stretch on.
He looked pale, well paler than usual, and there were signs of him having been put through some slightly rough handling, probably on account of the emergency situation.
“I have no idea. Mycroft is being very shady about the whole thing, says that Sherlock needs his rest, that he isn’t feeling well and so forth. I want you to get through to him that he can’t deny me access to what technically is mine!”
John reached out to grab Mycroft by the arm to stop him in his tracks.
From a safe distance, half-hidden behind other mingling guests, John was also observing the scene.
“My occupation is not of any importance in this matter. What I’m about to propose to you is of a more personal nature, Dr Watson.”
“Lubricant.”
“You can’t be serious!”
John’s eyes widen while his mind attempts to wrap itself around the words coming from Mycroft’s mouth.
Mycroft is perfectly unphased by this outburst.
He had gone to bed early and then woken up, gone to work and consequently come home exhausted with nothing but sleep on his mind after a particularly gruesome shift.  When waking up this morning, the door to Sherlock’s bedroom had been closed and since Sherlock, when deigning to sleep, was a late riser, John had thought nothing of it and gone about his usual morning routine instead.
Then John went ahead and married Mary anyway.
No Magnussen in sight though.
“Where have you been?!”
While swiftly passing the large window facing the park outside, keeping his distance from Dr Roylott’s waving fists, a distorted face had suddenly been staring at him from the other side of the glass, mouth wide open, baring a pair of frightful fangs.
Whatever he might feel for Sherlock must be put on the backburner for now, it will only serve him as a painful reminder of what he has lost if he keeps dwelling on sentiment.
There were too many unknown variables to who Dr Grimesby Roylott really was, for Mycroft’s liking, but at least they were headed for his home now, the rest would hopefully fall into place upon arrival.
“Must everything you do always be tainted by danger, Sherlock?”
“How am I supposed to achieve all of this?” John asked with a hint of doubt in his voice.
Whatever the reason, it had been bothersome to be subjected to and Sherlock had after a few hours began to ignore the man instead. Such attitude had earned him a few hours of reprieve but that was apparently over now.
“Dr Watson. I hope I’m not keeping you from something important?”
This knowledge is what helps John through situations like these, when they have not been standing side by side facing an enemy together, the unwavering trust in Sherlock’s ability to always land on his feet somehow, however dire the situation.
“Well, I met with Mycroft. We had a little lesson in clarification regarding who’s controlling who. He started talking about archaic punishment methods, like spanking. I informed him that with the right person, a little spanking could actually be quite exciting. I think my point came across quite well.”
If that product is the magical explanation for Sherlock’s glossy and soft curls John wasn’t averse to having some of it in his own hair, but as he had worked it into his own tresses the overpowering scent of Sherlock had unmistakably made itself known in the air of the bathroom, for some reason making John feel guilty despite not knowing why that was, and he had quickly taken his own much cheaper version of Wash n Go to massage into his scalp to replace the feeling of treading on dangerous waters. Luckily for him, he managed to evaporate the scent by opening up a window and he decided to not try Sherlock’s products any more.
Dr Grimesby Roylott was in his early fifties, descendant of a once prominent family who had fallen on hard times during the previous century and the only remaining feature of their once illustrious assets was Stoke Moran, the ancestral home in the family’s possession for centuries but now ill-kept and not up to its former glory.
“I know Mr Holmes seems to be a stickler for protocol but it’s not essential for you to stay on my account, I can very well handle meeting my patient alone,” he tried but despite this, the other man stubbornly remained where he was.
“Because if killing Magnussen was all we needed to do to solve our problem, we would have done so a long time ago. A person with that amount of power and leverage over people naturally has a lot of enemies, and yet he walks around more or less unprotected, conducting his daily business without a care in the world. That’s because he has made proper arrangements for all secrets to be revealed if anything happens to him. Killing him would be like unleashing a booby trap right beneath our own feet.
Sherlock sighed.
Then, as quickly as he had made his initial move of intimidation, Sherlock backed away from Mycroft who was still slumped in his chair, and turned his back on him.
Magnussen had turned to face Mycroft now, a predatory smile glued to his lips.  It was only a marginal improvement of his usual expression but a strong testament of his current mood and that surely had to count as a success Mycroft thought with a flutter of hope.
“Before your arrival here, my intel was informative enough to show me a very interesting clip caught on CCTV where you are seen running half-dressed just a street away from Magnussen’s residence less than an hour ago. A quick check at the other cameras in the area showed you entering his flat half an hour earlier and Magnussen himself arriving some twenty minutes after, rather eagerly getting out of his car. And once again, this begs the question: what
As John cycled through the night, the cold wind biting his cheeks, he began plotting how he was going to go about letting Victor know what exactly Magnussen had been up to behind his back and if a nagging little voice inside his head reminded him that it was unwise to scheme without involving Sherlock, a much stronger voice told him that this was simply a precautionary measure, for his own safety, not something he deliberately was trying to keep from his fellow-schemer.
He felt a pang of regret about how he had dealt with the John aspect of this whole affair.
Perhaps it had been something in the look John had presented that made him suddenly very aware of this being somewhat chaotic.
Still, he couldn’t deny that it was a tad unfortunate that the first interesting man he encountered since being discharged was not only taken but also a potential patient of his.
He opened his eyes to look at his lover who was standing a few feet away looking back at him.
Even if John technically realised that Sherlock hardly was genuinely interested in the despicable reptile of a man they were targeting at the moment, it was the way Sherlock had gone about trying to solve the case that angered him the most.
On the leather seat next to him as he climbed inside Sherlock’s medical records was already waiting for him and as the car drove off he opened it up and began to read.
He has always been a man of action rather than sitting still in a chair, going through a vast amount of evidence. How Lestrade manages to do it on a daily basis without succumbing to boredom has always been a puzzle to him.
But the fact that it is something is evident since someone has seen fit to edit the film after all.
He needed to stop their exit and perhaps, if possible, try to explain what he had found once they were outside. With Magnussen unexpectedly out of the picture now it would be easier to talk more freely with Mycroft and decide what to do next.
“This is naturally happy news and as I said, we are very grateful for your resourcefulness. And as it happens, my brother is in the need of finding himself a personal physician since the previous holder of that position…well, decided to make better use of his time elsewhere…And that’s where you come in, Dr Watson. It is not a permanent position and it might not be much of any actual work, so it would be advisable that you remain in your current employment if you want to keep yourself occupied every day. But the pay is very generous and if you do a good job it might open up opportunities for advancement, perhaps a position similar to a friend of yours I believe, who works at the research facility.”
“Don’t bother, as there is really no need to. I know what I’m doing. You see, behind every powerful man, there is someone infinitely more cleaver who knows exactly what buttons to push to yield the desirable result.”
“If I can’t rely on your discretion and help in this matter, I have no further use for you, Dr Watson.”
“There’s a problem to your suggestion,” Victor said and the firm grip around John’s neck was released as doubt now had been replaced with resignation in his voice when he spoke. “Sherlock hasn’t been available for me to talk to since we parted from Mr Magnussen’s dinner party last Saturday. Mycroft says he’s feeling unwell and who, if not his trusted doctor, would know what that is all about? So naturally you would be my first source of information. There is something odd about the whole thing and that’s not the first strange thing that has happened since you decided to step into our lives.”
“No, it’s is my first attempt at something like this actually. I made it this very morning,”
“Naturally. You are allowed to leave whenever you want if what I offer is of no interest to you.”
During that time, Mycroft had felt close to despair and despite his constant effort to remain logical and in control under all circumstances, he had been close to losing it himself afterwards, when seeing his brother’s bleeding skin.
On his phone John watches the older brother as he crosses the distance between him and Sherlock, saying something about loyalty to family.
It took every fibre of his being not to trash against his confinements, trying to escape, knowing how hopeless it was. It was even tempting to call out the name of his captor, trying to get his attention. Bargaining with a human was much easier than doing so with an animal, however depraved humans sometimes were. Surely there was something to be said to convince Dr Roylott to remove the snake? If just given the chance.
I’m sorry that I lied to you, I know you were very upset by the drugs and that you have been thinking about it even if you didn’t really mention it the other night. There is no need for you to worry. I’m not a drug addict, merely a manipulator who wanted your help but couldn’t be bothered to ask for it, so instead I used trickery and deceit to get what I wanted. I’m sorry about that.”
He shuddered to think what his brother might have done if no one had been there to keep a close watch over him. He would probably be dead or locked up somewhere if not for Mycroft’s constant hovering.
John narrowed his eyes at this.
And with that Magnussen left and John stumbled out through the door, no longer caring about taking Victor’s car to drive him home. He would get a cab if necessary and pay the staggering amount required, as long as he could get the hell out of here.
He walked a couple of steps along the shore, allowing his feet to come in contact with the cold water, sinking into the wet sand, as he made sure that Victor would be given enough time to disappear. Then he slowly began heading back up the hill towards the barrack once more.
Before any of the others could beat him to the biggest question mark of the story, him being seen with his shirt still open while walking away from Magnussen's flat, he declared that his hasty escape had been because Magnussen had simply behaved too ardently after seeing the exposure of naked skin.
On some level he could fully grasp that Mycroft might have once had secret missile plans in his office, however outrageous that image might have seemed in any other context, and wasn’t that the whole key to their strange way of living,  nothing was ever normal with them, except for the fact that in their eyes, it was.
So this is the end.
“...Is nothing but advice I ignore the way I do everything that I don’t agree with,” Sherlock interrupted. They had engaged in this conversation many times over the years, it never resulted in a different outcome. “I know a cigarette is cancer in the shape of a white paper stick, I’m not stupid, Mycroft. And don’t pretend you never said it, because I heard you plenty of times growing up. Besides...” Mycroft could hear his brother scoff in the dark, “...
So Mycroft simply continued to look at his visitor until Magnussen stepped closer, and seated himself in the chair on the other side of the desk. The chair where those who came for guidance or punishment usually ended up sitting. Mycroft suspected that Magnussen wasn’t looking for either of those though.
off then?” John asked as he quickly followed him.
The one to finally terminate the stale mate was Mycroft who broke eye contact by nodding towards the stranger.
“...Sir, it’s Anthea here. I’m afraid I have some bad news. It’s about your brother..."
He eats the sandwich that has been left on a plate for him while he leaves the surveillance room to clear his head.
Once he was gone John turned to his patient, eyes wide in bewilderment. The wish to raise his voice and throw his arm up in the air to vent this frustration for being kept in the dark was for a second overwhelming. Maybe the childish antics of his patient was rubbing off on him as well?
Someone caught up with him and held an umbrella over his head as they walked the short trail over to the secluded area of the cemetery where a shiny new stone, fittingly black and devoid of unnecessary ornaments now resided next to a newly dug gravesite. White flowers in a wreath was the only sign of other grievers having visited the place. Mycroft most likely, who else was left?
“Yes,” Sherlock answered in a hollow tone that John didn’t know what to make of. “So get your clothes on and then leave, I’ll go out to stall him while you get yourself in order.”
“You?” was all he managed before the figure standing by the door detached himself from his immobile position in the shadows and resolutely stepped into the room.
John’s eyes narrowed for a second because why did this keep happening, that people always knew who he was without him having any idea of who they were in return? It was starting to become annoying.
The man simply shook his head in misery and continued to move away.
He had learned not to ask Sherlock about what exactly his experiments consisted of as he never managed to receive a satisfying answer and more often than not did it only cause him to feel alarm over what his brother had chosen to spend his time on. The more absurd the better seemed to be Sherlock’s motto.
His brother's eyes narrowed at once, clearly not done with being a nuisance.
He put a set of black trainers on and was kneeling down on the floor to tie them when the door opened behind his back.
Because Sherlock didn’t like anyone telling him what to do, not even John, not when it was case related. The doctor could trick him into eating the odd portion of food or quit smoking indoors, put labels on experiments that could be poisonous and try not to flush pieces of carcasses down their drain after finishing with them. His brother could be made to heel when the things one asked of him where small and inconsequential. No bother really, just inconveniences.
Sherlock nodded and then moved his hand in a beckoning gesture.
On the other hand, Sherlock was a capricious creature, unpredictable and prone to rash decisions at all hours of the day and fully capable of overdosing in a spectacular manner if that was something he for some reason wanted to do, even if he prided himself for his logical thinking.
“No! I’m not accepting this! I demand to see him!”
As Sherlock would have put it, if he had still been around to pass a comment, how utterly ridiculous.
“Well, that’s who I am, isn’t it?”
“I didn’t come here to talk about expensive drinks. I believe you had a proposition for me. Otherwise I’m wasting my time by being here.”
A talk with Dr Watson was perhaps due to be scheduled after all.
“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” he whispered, his hands fisting the collar of the black coat Sherlock wore, for a second almost angry for being kept in the dark from all of this.
And considering how protective Mycroft is of his little brother, John can’t really see such information being well-perceived by the man who is charge of a whole group of secret service agents and probably could ruin John's life with the snap of his fingers.
So instead of replying, Sherlock remained calmly looking at the increasingly aggressive  doctor, waiting for the actual threat to come. Most likely involving that poker he was making a point of showcasing so openly.
There was something almost reptilian about the way Magnussen looked at him, like he stared straight into John’s most inner core with those dead beady eyes, but his voice remained smooth as he spoke and he had that vague disturbing smile playing on his lips the whole time.
“If we are to continue doing this I’m not sure I like to do it in your brother’s room, it feels a .....bit.....well, uncomfortable I guess. Like we’re sticking it to him even more than we already are by luring him with our new plan. So either you clean up that room of yours upstairs or introduce me to your own bedroom.”
“I thought you quit smoking.”
It was one of the things Sherlock really appreciated about John, the uncertainty of how he was going to behave when turned on. It could be the undone savagery of pure sex or the gentleness of just being taken care of, slowly bringing them both to completion in due time, and it was always difficult to tell which option John would go for, probably because he didn’t know it himself.
As he stormed into his own flat, still high on the success of recent events, throwing his coat across the nearest available surface, he was disappointed to notice that the atmosphere in the room was not as welcoming as he would have hoped.
“That’s what
At the moment he looked immobilized, but one could never tell with a man like that, so John continued to aim his gun at him while he pulled his phone out and called Mycroft.
“Who cares, I haven’t bothered talking to him. He always comes across as perpetually displeased with us all, he can very well entertain himself if he made the decision to come here. My boss says that he has icicles where his balls should be. I’m just happy I don't have to work directly with him, just imagine what his staff has to suffer through.”
May I ask why?”
Besides, if Sherlock had been called away on a case for Scotland Yard, John would have been invited as well. The invitations from Lestrade was always extended to him these days, especially now that people seemed to realise that he and Sherlock were a couple and came as a pair, not only as the expert and his trustworthy fanboy sidekick.
He knew with certainty that whatever Sherlock was likely suffering from was not in the least contagious but more an embarrassment for Mycroft to discuss, and yet he couldn’t help but needle the other man when given the opportunity.
“I don’t think. I
If Sherlock believed him or not was unclear, but at least he didn’t say anything further about the matter. Instead he sat down on the only chair in the room and expectantly looked at John.
John had everything he wanted pressed against his own aroused body and he could care for nothing else.
In the background a phone had started ringing but he didn’t care as he ran along the corridor, passing the young woman still on her knees on the floor, scrubbing away at the carpet. He didn’t hear her crying this time, he didn’t look at her, he just ran and when he finally reached his destination, he tore the door open and stormed inside.
Sherlock could feel his throat tightening while realising the implication, simultaneously trying to grasp how this could even be possible.
A predatory smile stretched across the face of the man in the chair.
And this is the end! Thank you to everyone who read, commented and gave us kudos and love.
“And then we can try again?” Sherlock asks hopefully, a bit shy.
“I am sure there is no reason to go that far. But the occasional peck on the cheek is perhaps to be expected and I will try to tolerate it as well as I am able. As I’m sure John will as well.”
The information that he was engaged to be married had been a bit disappointing though, even if John probably never would have decided to make a move towards a patient as long as he was working as his physician, he had some principles that he tended to stick to after all.
“Sherlock has been....well, I guess abducted is the appropriate word even if he possibly went quite willingly and the abductor certainly won’t harm him. But what else would you call a scenario where someone lures another person away with the intent of not returning,
John took a deep breath of fresh air to clear his head, his nostrils flaring and his knuckles gripping tightly around the balcony baluster on account of his pent-up frustration. He was only a bit tipsy now and he could probably stave it off with a bit of food. But the question was if he would be able to stomach anymore of what was going on downstairs.
“It is tempting...” John admitted.
“Was it all a game to you? From the very beginning? From that first kiss you gave me? Did you do it because you knew that you could manipulate me into overlooking your drug abuse, to not see what you were doing to yourself behind my back? Your brother and fiancé demanded that you were assigned a doctor to check up on you and this was the easiest way to go along with their demands and still get away with your secret, wasn’t it?”
“Well, we can’t all be experts, can we.”
Not long after his departure, John decided to leave as well, before being forced to join the rest of the staff with cleaning duties.
Mycroft ignored the slight and finished his wine.
When no answer came forth, Magnussen stepped up to him slowly, despite realising the foolishness of aggravating a man of Dr Roylott’s disposition. On the other hand, Magnussen had enough on the man to put him behind bars for a long time if he wanted to and such an upper hand made him boldly decide to confront instead of keeping quiet.
And yet he would never had wished for his annoying little brother to end up chained to such a deranged man as Victor Trevor.
I have no idea how he got wind of Magnussen in particular, how he knew that Magnussen was the one who could help him achieve his goals, but about a year ago Mycroft was approached by Magnussen with a very shocking proposition that basically made us realise that we had not gotten away with our little scheme. “
Sherlock nodded and rose from the table.
Mycroft seems to support this theory even if everything they have so far are actually just theories. Sherlock himself would be appalled by the way they work a case around hypotheses instead of facts, but as there are no solid facts to be had, theories are all they have.
I remember that even Mycroft reacted with surprise when he found out about Victor, which confirmed my suspicions even further, that wanting to be with me was some sort of abnormality and probably to do with some underlying motive. Mycroft said that I was better off without complicating my life by attaching myself to someone that was bound to cause me pain in the end, but I was so happy that I ignored his advice and decided to enjoy my friendship with Victor whatever the consequences.”
Thrown off by the unexpected sight, John didn’t reply, for now trying to simply focus on his own task, silently praying that Sherlock was going to keep up his end of the bargain. Whatever disturbing images he was going to see this evening, he couldn’t allow them to derail him from his own agenda.
Mycroft sighed. They had engaged in this topic on numerous occasions but somehow they always ended up at this very same stand point. He was too tired and angry to take the bait this time though so he straightened his features into neutrality instead and prepared himself for this evening’s farewell. He would bring up the reason for his brother intrusion into the research facility tomorrow but he realised that he was not going to get any answers tonight.
your line of work, Mr Holmes?” he quipped, but if he had expected a reaction he was once again denied a satisfactory response.
“Because his secret vault where he keeps all his blackmailing material isn’t in his office. I’ve already tried that angle once, it simply isn’t there. We have managed to narrow it down to his house in London after extensive research, the same place where the dinner party was held, but on that specific evening we were naturally unable access it, too many people around. Besides, he is most likely the only person who can open it anyway.
He looked down at the fragile figure on the bed, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
Finding Sherlock in the state he now was in had been a real schock that was still reverberating inside of John and he knew he couldn’t bare it if Sherlock actually died.
John frowned as he searched his memory, seemingly coming up short.
As the car came to a halt in front of the stairs leading up to the main entrance, the door opened and the silhouette of a man presented itself in the doorway, the light from inside making him difficult to distinguish, but he seemed to be of a rather formidable build, taking up a large portion of the space he was occupying, taller and broader than Sherlock by far, even more so than even Mycroft.
“You know as well as I do that such a thing isn’t possible. We simply need to keep looking.”
The corridor leading up to the ward where Sherlock was admitted was more or less empty by this time in the evening. Visiting hours were technically over but as usual an exception had been made on his account and as he strode down the hall the sound of his shoes as well as the tip of his umbrella touching the floor with each step announced his arrival to the occupant of the room where he was headed.
John sighed and wished that he could have had a way to communicate all of this to Sherlock straight away but knew that he had to wait until evening came.
“You’re hardly one to talk.....,” John muttered. “Feelings are not exactly your strongest forte either.”
After he has been delivered the whiskey, a generous helping in a paper cup of all things, as if John is not to be trusted with any fancy glassware, he locks the door and delves into his mission with newly found ardour.
“I’m very grateful for the time you take out of your......” the man nodded his head flippantly towards the glass partition and the work that was continuing on the floor below, “......probably
And yes, Mycroft did indeed look bothered, but to his credit he managed to keep his composure while speaking.
Still no reply and he couldn’t discern if that was telling or if Sherlock actually had his thoughts on something else. With Sherlock one never truly knew.
John thought about Sherlock’s living arrangement as they were right now, the sealed windows, the high gates, the house that felt more like a confinement than an actual home. When you put the added health exams and the STD tests into the equation it felt more or less like a gilded cage, but perhaps that was Mycroft’s idea of perfectly controlled protection.
He didn’t like to be questioned on the decisions he made, least of all from Sherlock, and certainly not in front of other people. But then he let it pass and smoothed out whatever signs of irritation his face presented and opted for a more casual expression.
Sure, Mycroft probably does his own share of snooping by watching some of the surveillance material himself, he is just that type of control freak to be unable to resist it from time to time, but the main bulk of it must be delegated to staff, Mycroft simply wouldn’t have the time to spare, busy man that he is.
“Stop stalling, Sherlock. No need to remind me what that man is capable of. Your fiancé made sure of that. Instead of dwelling on things we can’t change, we need to look ahead instead. Dinner is getting cold downstairs, so you're coming with me even if I have to drag you by the hair to join me at the table.”
But after having spent so much time in the man’s presence today Mycroft couldn’t bare the thought of reaching out to check on him, exposing himself to another bout of craziness and melodrama, so he decided to let sleeping dogs rest for  now and seated himself in front of the fireplace, book in hand to patiently await further news from his brother or the doctor.
And now, with a swift reveal of what reality really looked like and some particularly cruel words from Sherlock, it had all crumbled down into small, unsalvageable pieces scattered before his very eyes.
Victor gave him a glare of disbelief because Mycroft not descending like a thunderstorm upon everything regarding this unfortunate situation was exceedingly surprising to grasp.
John shook his head slowly, looking at Magnussen, trying to suss out what the man was actually saying.
Then he saw Imaginary-John turn his face around, as if addressing someone else, not visible to Sherlock, perhaps not even present in the room. It looked like he was screaming.
He remembers this day vividly.
Later during that visit Mycroft had used the bathroom, before departing. This detail nags at John’s attention, it had done so even back then, because Mycroft never used their facilities otherwise, if nothing else he always abhorred the state of the flat and wouldn’t deign using their bathroom for anything, not wanting to run  the risk of catching something from one of Sherlock ‘s endless experiments.
He cast a regretful look at the girl on the floor, not yet done with his game but also realising that there were other things of importance that demanded his attention, then he waived her away along with the servant.
He pressed the tip rather firmly into the soft flesh of the doctor’s arm and it caused a moaning stir before the sleeping man’s eyelids began to flutter.
Granted, this was an exceptionally good-looking man and something about him made John’s knees go all week while he simultaneously wanted to grab that firm ass and just take him right there on the spot, on that pristine-looking bed.
Mycroft gave Sherlock a stern look.
“Oh, don’t bother, he isn’t siding with me. He merely wants to have his way with my brother, that’s where his interest both begins and ends in this matter…And convinced as well that he might achieve it. Perhaps he will thanks to you.”
It appeared to be some sort of office and would surely have been a better option for keeping secrets than the living room.
*************************
But now, he clearly had something on his mind and hopefully, whatever that was, it wouldn’t be a price too high to pay.
There was no one waiting for him anymore.
“I assume I will need to be prepared to face Magnussen soon enough myself, perhaps even tonight. He will most likely want to see me with his own eyes if he is going to believe what you and John are telling him regarding my ailing health. He won’t be as easily dismissed as Victor.”
“No one is as clever as my brother when it comes to getting his way. I have no idea where he got the drugs from and right now it doesn’t matter. All I care about is him waking up from his comatose state, the rest can be dealt with later. “
John felt the discreet tingle in his fingers out of a desire to smack his friend over the head for his insolence, but there was a fear that such actions would actually provoke Sherlock into doing something irrational out of pure spite.
He had never  quite settled here, and he didn’t spend much time in the house, preferring the home he had in the city. But this was the ancestral pile of bricks after all, it needed to be looked after occasionally and as he was the only one willing to take that responsibility, he made the effort to visit the place every now and then.
Sherlock’s brother or not, John had neve managed to warm to this man.
“Yes.” John indicated a briefcase he had snatched from one of his colleagues while he hadn’t been looking and that had to pose as the supposed proof Magnussen expected to see. Hopefully he wouldn't be forced to open it up as it didn't contain anything of what he had promised.
He allowed himself to bask a little in their obvious attention but as expected, the person who elicited the most whispers, as well as some curious glances, was of course Sherlock.
If Magnussen noticed any of this, he didn’t show it, he simply continued to taunt, twisting the proverbial knife even deeper.
Disappearing into a haze of lustful fogginess, John let go of his earlier sleepiness, succumbing completely to pure carnal pleasure as the other man brought him to completion and by that action started the day in the best way imaginable.
There was a sound to his left and suddenly light flooded from a door opening and the expected silhouette of Dr Roylott appeared on the threshold.
Lestrade taps the photo over Sherlock’s tranquil face and then puts it inside the pocket of his coat.
“What’s your brother’s name?”
But a firm grip around his wrist put a stop to that idea and the figure leaned in even closer, until they almost ended up face to face, a gust of warm breath ghosting John’s cheek.
But no such luck.
He briskly marched over to it, knocked on the window to the driver’s seat and was rewarded with the window being rolled down, revealing the large silent man usually in charge of taking him to the house.
“If you’re not interested, this trip was clearly a waste of my time. I’m not desperate, you know. I don’t have to go along with anything. I was doing just fine before you called me.”
found out about the gun? And more importantly, how had he managed to get his hands on it?
He wondered if Mycroft would point that out later, but for now he wasn’t willing to risk Sherlock’s trust by being too meticulous in his reports.
Magnussen tutted at that.
“Well. A modified form of tranquilising darts, far quicker in effect than usual, putting the victim in immediate sedation, leaving a minimal punctuation wound. Trevor aimed at their heads, with the intent to kill them, so the tiny darts most likely got lost in the tresses of their hair. Sherlock’s in particular would have been difficult to locate. I have been telling him to get a haircut, but you know how it is with siblings, do they ever deign to listen?”
John suddenly realised that Sherlock never had told him the circumstances surrounding their first meeting and what it was that had caused that anaphylactic shock. As it had not been on account of a wasp sting, what had it been about?
When John arrived at the large house a few days later he had his medical bag with him, a ton of questions and Sherlock’s medical journal.
“He’s just envious. The diet he’s just started on isn’t working, that’s bound to annoy him immensely and make him more irritable. Don’t worry about it.”
While pushing his way past the man in the doorway to head for Sherlock’s bedroom to see what sort of situation this is turning out to be, he barks over his shoulder at Mycroft, the barking indicating that he has gone into military mode now, as he tends to do when faced with what appears to be a threatening situation.
As he moved to discard the empty bottle, slumping down on the sofa quite heavily, his eyes caught something white lying on the floor beneath the coffee table.
Not that Mycroft was a man easily targeted. People who had previously tried did not usually live to tell the tale.
“John, you might want to consider getting up and putting some clothes on now,” he said and quickly stumped his cigarette against his usual place on the windowpane, the spell of tranquillity abruptly broken.
“No, I wouldn’t say so,” Magnussen finally offered. “But he is
The standstill was interrupted by the doctor suddenly turning away, walking over to the fireplace, leaving Sherlock to follow his movements with curiosity.
“You told me yourself to reign myself in regarding him.”
He wrote some stern words about the smoking habits and some pretend guidelines on how Sherlock should be eating and sleeping to feel better.
“Indeed. Welcome to my house, Dr Watson. My name is Charles Magnussen, the host for the evening. I hope you’re looking forward to celebrate the union of the happy couple with us tonight?”
Mycroft's eyes actually widened when hearing this, before narrowing again, his nails digging hard into the soft skin of his palms.
And what a delectable piece of vulnerability it had turned out to be, Magnussen could feel his mouth salivating at the mere thought of it.
Sherlock snorted at that but refrained from answering, which was unusual for him, so Mycroft took another few steps forward to take a closer look at him.
“Why ever would I do that?” Roylott spit out, beginning to work himself up into a temper now. “I have no interest in him. His childish efforts at playing detective is of no concern to me. He doesn’t even really know who I am! And to me, he is only that piece of ass you been running after lately, Magnussen, nothing more.”
The time to conduct business was finally here and with a sense of resolve and finality, John stepped into the room.
So he put in the effort and concentrated on what he had in front of him, working in silence next to the others and managed for a few blissful hours to mute the jealous demon raging inside of him.
Deciding that it was too early for such childish games, Mycroft’s tone took on a firmer tone when he didn’t get a reply.
As the helicopter finally landed, close to the gates surrounding the ominous building that was Stoke Moran, Mycroft steeled himself for what was about to come.
“Is there something else that would be of interest for me to know about? Any other developments? Has Mr Trevor been informed of this yet?”
Now it was Sherlock's turn to look annoyed.
“Who?
“It wasn’t me that ended it…” came a defensive muttering from the wall and John narrowed his eyes.
Magnussen ignored it at first, his tongue moving more fervently, long strokes along the skin from the lining of the trousers up to the belly button. But the sound insistently returned a second later, a little firmer this time and a growled out:
