“I’ll take it under advisement. You need something for that?” Dean runs a finger over his ass. Cas jumps and hisses.
The next morning Diran shows him a cabinet full of brightly colored pre-packaged cups of cereal. He picks out a little cup of fruitloops. He eats in silence, watching Diran brew coffee for them both.
“Were we?” Cas asks, because he has to be a dick, and because he wants the smack Dean lands on his ass for being snarky.
Cas collapses onto Dean eventually, a little breathless. Dean takes advantage of the moment to sit them both up then press Cas down into the matress, taking over the rhythm.
Cas helps him to his feet then reels him close by the hip and kisses him, slow and lazy and full of thanks.
“Cas, Cas, oh fuck, I’m--” he’s gasping into Cas’s shoulder, by now, eyes watering again, clenching on the dildo, a moment from coming.
“Yes,” and it’s true, somehow, even with the fake IDs and the grimacing judge and the kiss that’s observed by total strangers in some no-name town in fucking Nebraska. Dean feels better once they’ve signed their fake names and listed their fake address and shared a real kiss. It’s only once they’re in the car on the way home that Dean realizes they might need to tell Sam and Jack about this.
Castiel pulled away from Dean’s lips to look at his face. His eyes, so green they almost hurt to look at. His cheeks flushed from exertion, the freckles standing out when they were usually more subdued. The bruised lips, with his panting breath coming unevenly. “Perfect,” Castiel murmured as he took in the lines, the planes, every single bit that he could see, and remembered the things he couldn’t while they were both in human bodies. “Absolutely perfect.”
Then the lights finally went on, and Dean realized exactly what Crowley had been doing, possibly even what he’d been doing all along. A woman could barely glance at Dean and he could immediately tell if she was interested in him. But when it came to men, Dean was even more clueless than Castiel, and considering Dean had a thirty or so year head start on him for learning how humans worked, that was really saying something.
“What was supposed to happen?” Cas asked when Sam motioned them to follow him. It took them at least twenty times as long as usual, but the three, or two by now, managed to make it to one of the Men of Letters' storage rooms.
Dean wished there was something he could actually do about it, but at least play flirting as a teasing technique was better than nothing. “I mean, look at that muscle definition,” Dean continued, doing exactly what he’d said, because damn the angel was hot when he was naked from the waist up. He was probably even better from… Dean banished the thought before it could make his jeans uncomfortable, though it was definitely a thought he planned on using later in the bunker, during his long, hot shower. “You must work out,” Dean added, knowing Cas’ reaction to that one would probably be hilarious.
“You’re not supposed to tell,” Sam said, but he was cut off from saying anything more as Cas walked over and suddenly grabbed Dean’s face, pulling him into a very heavy kiss.
The line moved up, and Castiel placed their order. Just in case Claire decided to get fussy, he ordered an easily handled shake for himself, and got the smallest chocolate cone they had for her. After he paid, he stepped to the side where all the other customers were waiting for their orders to be ready.
It was the black lace pair that had broken the angel’s resolve. The brothers were at Bobby’s, as both a slight rest and to do a bit of research before they went bounding after their next target. Sam had happily sat on the couch in Bobby’s cozy living room with a book, and Bobby had sat at the desk doing the same while taking notes. Dean, on the other hand, had avoided the lure of knowledge by saying he needed to tune up the Impala, and had rushed out the front door before anybody could say a word to stop him. Castiel picked up a book as well, one written in ancient Sanskrit that was dusty enough that it probably wasn’t used often, and after wiping off the worst of it, he started reading, still standing. But it only took about ten minutes before he became too restless to concentrate, as well.
“Yeah, she definitely had her eye on me tonight, Cas,” Dean said grumpily, “as well as a hand. On my ass. Twice.”
“Just,” Dean said, holding his hand up because he seriously didn’t know how to react to anything like this. He waved it around in annoyance, before standing up, Cas automatically at his side. “We’ll just never talk about this ever again,” he mumbled.
That dark blue sweater definitely needed to be going home with him, Dean decided once saw it up close, and a heartbeat later he kinda wanted to bring its creator along with it. Blue was all that he saw when the guy first looked up. Since when did they make blue that… blue? After that, messy dark hair, a five o’clock shadow, and a pretty nice looking body from what showed under the guy’s shirt, all turned into a (very hot) person. “Can I help you? Anything in particular catch your eye?” The guy asked in a gravelly voice, and Dean was smitten.
"Well, for starters, mine's not halfway down my back," Sam answered, not even bothering to look up from his research book.
"Oh, from what you saw, huh?" Dean hissed, his face close enough now that he could see Cas almost flinch from it. "What you saw?"
“Would it have been better if I’d chosen a female vessel, instead of Jimmy?” Cas asked, and it took Dean a few moments before he could figure out how to say what he felt.
“Cute,” Dean deadpanned sarcastically. “But I think we’ll pass.” He walked closer to the throne and the assbutt sitting on it, giving Crowley a smile that made the angel feel proud of him. “Now what was this emergency, exactly, that you needed me so desperately for?”
“I am right here, you know?” Castiel reminded them both. “And I can hear everything you’re saying, Crowley,” he finished, heavily implying that he knew exactly what the demon wasn’t outright saying, as well.
Castiel kissed him, pushing against him for that earlier friction, but Dean pushed him away enough to show him the bottle of clear liquid. “If I open myself up with this,” he promised, “it’ll feel a million times better, Cas,” he finished with a lascivious grin.
"You know what? Who the hell are you to judge such a classic piece of art?" Dean shouted as the bunker door slammed open. "Obviously, angels have shitty taste." The same argument had been going on since they left the theater.
The man was in his late teens, maybe really early twenties, and looked like he’d been making the ladies swoon from birth. He had a classically beautiful face, almost as if he’d stepped out of a Renaissance painting at the museum and decided to try wearing underwear for a living. His body was sculpted in a way that didn’t look forced, like he hadn’t earned those lithe muscles anywhere as boring as a gym. He was golden all over, with a sprinkling of freckles that should’ve made him more cute than hot, yet they just seemed to turn the temperature up all the more. His light brown hair was spiky, in a way that made Castiel want to run his hands through it to see if it was soft under all that gel, and even from here, those impossibly green eyes sparkled with humor and intelligence.
“Goodbye,” Castiel whispered as he followed Dean out the door. And even though it was just an inanimate object, it almost felt like the house said goodbye back.
“With you,” Castiel started hesitantly. He paused, trying to gather his thoughts together to explain this properly. “When I brought your soul back from hell...”
“That’s right Dean. Fuck yourself for me. Get yourself wet and loose for me. Take your time.” Cas’s voice is steady and commanding. Dean lets his eyes slip closed as he rides the dildo.
Cas sits up and the panties keep the dildo in place. He goes to straddle Dean, heart thudding as the dildo moves inside him, stimulating him in all kinds of new ways. Cas doesn’t know what Dean has planned but he already knows it’s going to be torture.
But Dean is soft he thinks as he looks in on Cas, curled on his side, hands tucked underneath his chin, shoulders rising and falling slowly in sleep.
So Dean takes the dildo in hand again and starts working it in. He doesn’t think he’ll manage. He asks for more lube at some point then goes back to work. It hurts. It stings and burns and the first time he gets it all the way in he cries out at how much it hurts but the pain makes it better. The pain makes him burn, sends pleasure sparking through his body, makes him grind against Cas’s fingers where they’re working over his cock.
Cas doesn’t last long. He’s groaning Dean’s name and holding Dean down on his cock for almost too long making tears spill over in Dean’s eyes. Then his cock twitches on Dean’s tongue and Dean’s mouth floods with the bitter taste of him.
It's all slow and easy and domestic. Dean never thought he would see a day in his life like this. He thinks if John could see him now, chopping carrots in the kitchen, preparing a stew for his lover, he'd probably lay into Dean for going soft.
Dean’s close now, his heaving chest pressed against Cas’s, so close Cas can see the sweat beaded on his forehead.
“You got anything to add?” Even Dean’s lips are tense these days, his vowels tight, his jaw clenched. Cas wonders if he grinds his teeth in his sleep.
It's not hot or even really passionate yet. Just simple and sweet. Cas saying hello to Dean with his lips, but then Dean slips his tongue out and Cas sighs against him and before long Cas is nipping at his lips making Dean whine out embarrassing little noises.
His future self is gasping out of control while Cas steadily fingerfucks him and sucks him off. Dean would be more impressed with the coordination that move takes if he didn't feel like he was going to combust on the spot. His skin is pickling with sweat. He's only ever experienced a blowjob like that once before and it was akin to revelation, leaving him speechless, breathless, ready to be led along in supplication by the mouth.
Cas is gasping, moaning. Dean wraps his free arm around Cas’s hip and rests his free hand against Cas’s stomach, enjoying the way it flexes and tenses under Dean’s hand as Cas writhes under him.
So here he is, on his knees on the bed, in front of Cas, while he fucks himself on the relatively normal part of he dildo.
“You are a brat,” Cas tells him, voice low and frustrated. He drops his book and gets up off the bed and Dean’s stomach sinks. Cas, ever practical, is just going to leave him here. Dean probably deserves that.
“Yeah, that sounds right,” Dean chokes out, for the first time realizing that perhaps his relationship with Cas isn’t some broken little thing.
Cas doesn’t move, looking up at Dean. He’s still pinned under Dean though Dean isn't touching him at and now it doesn’t feel warm or good anymore. He just feels sick and tired and lonely.
It’s not a great angle and Dean’s wrist is probably gonna end up sore but Cas doesn’t mind as Dean thrusts gently. His palm is pressing against Cas’s dick, not crushing, just a nice pressure that Cas appreciates when Dean starts curling his finger against that spot inside Cas that makes him gasp and moan.
“I am struggling to understand,” who I am, he doesn’t say. “Who says I am a man?” Who says he is Cas? Who says he is anything at all? He’s not an angel anymore. He doesn’t have a family anymore. He doesn’t have Dean or Sam. There is no mission. He was cast out, then cast out again and now he’s supposed to do what? Learn to live? Live as what? And for who?
Dean's been drifting in and out of sleep all night. For all he's good at sleeping in unfamiliar places (and really are there any familiar places in his life?), he struggles to relax here. He doesn't trust his future self and he doesn't know anyone in the whole camp except for Cas. For all he knows one of his future self's jilted lovers is going to come in here to try and kill him.
Dean rolls his eyes towards the ceiling, silently praying for the strength to have this argument for the 8th time this week.
"Lay back," Cas says quietly and Dean hears the soft thump of a body hitting the bed. Dean's not sure what's happening for a few minutes. Cas doesn't move from the floor but Cas's arm is moving, which could be any number of things. He imagines Cas touching his taint or holding his balls gently, licking over them. The imagination is almost better than knowing exactly what's happening.
“I am no longer an angel, Dean. And we don’t have to do it if it makes you uncomfortable,” he sounded brittle and little bitchy.
Sure enough, the center is closed. The lights are off. He shakes the handle all the same, then stands there, unsure what to do. He sits on the step. It's as good a place as any to wait until they're open tomorrow.
Cas smiles. He only teases Dean for a minute longer before he sinks down, taking all of Dean’s cock in one move. He stays there for a moment holding Dean inside, and Dean can feel his muscles fluttering. He’s probably so sensitive it’s unbearable.
“Yes, but you’ve never… You’ve never invited me. You never asked me to stay,” there’s quiet awe in his voice and Dean feels guilt drop into his stomach that Cas didn’t know he was wanted.
“Good,” he lets go of Cas’s throat to slip three fingers in and finally fucks Cas like he means it until Cas is bucking against his palm, grinding his dick into Dean’s palm, pressing back against him, hungrily hoping Dean fucks him after this.
With nothing better to do, he goes to the center. He's hungry but he already knows he can make his remaining money stretch longer if he skips more meals, so he ignores it.
Dean doesn’t say anything, just gently rubs the lotion in. Cas is grateful that he has the right kind laying around the cabin. The thought comes to him that maybe Dean does this with someone else, maybe he keeps this lotion around for the women he fucks while he’s studiously avoiding Cas. His eyes prickle.
Cas can feel his high dipping after dinner but he resists taking another hit. He’s long since learned the lesson that sex while too high is always a disappointment. So he lets the high wane, idly playing with Dean’s fingers, admiring the freckles along his knuckles. He put those freckles back in place when he rebuilt Dean.
“This ok?” Cas asks, scratching nails down his chest, making Dean arch when Cas’s nail catches a nipple.
“Yes, I would like to adjust,” he’s breathless, but still somehow sounds like a fucking librarian. Dean snorts fondly, kissing the back of his neck again, before pulling out.
Cas is shaking a little when he announces “Three pages,” and that’s the fun of it, seeing Cas’s control slowly unspool, knowing no matter how in command of Dean he is, it will only last so long before Dean undoes him. As Cas turns the last pages Dean revels in him, in the solid weight of Cas in his lap, pinning him down. He rubs his hands over Cas's thighs, hopefully soothing and a little distraction. Dean loves his thighs, loves being buried between them, their strength and heft and the thick dark hair Cas is so proud of.
Dean obliges; he seals his mouth over Cas's cock and sucks. Cas makes an inarticulate sound, surprise and need, and tugs at Dean’s hair hard. Dean hums, pleased.
On the porch, Dean stomps mud off his boots--a nice gesture but when are his boots ever free of mud Cas wonders--then leaves them at the door, socks in a neat, if wet, pile on top.
Dean stops touching him entirely, cracking open the beer and Cas is laying there, waiting for Dean to kick him out. He’s crying now, silent and still, turned away from Dean.
“I’m going fuck your face. You can touch yourself if you want. But I am going to fuck you with that knot after I come in your mouth.”
The view isn’t great. Cas is tucked close between Dean’s thighs and it’s dark and Dean’s angle from the floor means his future self’s thighs block much of the view but he can hear the soft wet sounds of Cas’s mouth and he can hear himself moaning. He can hear Cas make a low pleased noise in the back of his throat that makes future Dean curse and makes Dean dig his fingers into his thigh. He wants to jack off.
Dean pulls out, gently as he can, and collapses beside Cas, who stays where Dean left him, ass up, face pressed to the bed.
“I love you, man. I do. But I don’t – I can’t. I don’t do the romance thing. The candles and roses and cutesy shit. It’s not me,” he’s ashamed by the confession.
Dean keeps working Cas through his orgasm then keeps sucking softly at Cas's dick after until Cas makes an uncomfortable little noise. He pulls away, draws his fingers out and kisses Cas’s heaving stomach, his sternum, his cheek, then his lips.
They don't kiss, which is frankly stupid because Dean knows how much he likes kissing someone and tasting himself on their tongue.
In the back, there’s a profusion of couches and a little kitchenette and a television and shelves and shelves of books, some of them half blocked by the couches.
Dean lays there for a moment, heart racing, fucked out. That was better than anything he could have imagined this morning. Cas rubs his hands over Dean’s chest soothingly before pulling off with a wince. Dean laughs a little at him. Of the two of them, Dean much prefers to be left dripping. Cas just finds the sensation annoying.
“Are you sure you wouldn’t prefer something fancier?” Cas asked as he held up the two bottles of beer he’d grabbed from the kitchen. “We could have anything we want, like Jack explained,” he reminded the former hunter, tilting his head in that way that Dean would never get tired of.
Dean laughed, embarrassed but hopefully not looking it. “My, uhh, my booth. Over there.” Dean pointed, tripping over his own words because dayum this guy was sexy. “I was hoping you could maybe watch it for me? I gotta pee like nobody’s business, and…” Dean quickly stopped when he realized he was oversharing. He was usually smooth with the guys and ladies, but there was something about this one, something that made Dean feel like a teenager in both a bad and a good kind of way. “So yeah, could you watch it for me for a few minutes?”
Dean blushed, though Castiel didn’t understand what he could possibly have to be embarrassed about. “Not too bad yourself,” he replied weakly.
“We can do it again anytime you want,” Dean whispered. “The kissing, too,” he added, even though he looked like he hadn’t wanted to.
Cas went over to his booth and scribbled a receipt on a piece of paper, before grabbing a bag stuffed to the brim with dark blue sweater. “Here you go,” Cas said with another smile, handing the bag over.
The Charlie in question walked up right in time for the punchline, and laughed loudly enough to startle Dean. “I’m not his girlfriend,” she said, still chuckling. “He’s as gay as I am, if not more.” She glanced between the two men for a few moments, taking a much longer time eyeing up Dean. “And he’s as single, too,” she said with a wink, before heading towards the appetizer table.
“Definitely,” Dean agreed, and Castiel sighed in relief. Dean must’ve been really good with kids, because it was usually next to impossible to stop Claire once she got on the warpath.
While Sam stared after the new couple, Mrs. Butters put her hand on Jack’s shoulder. “Now, how about we go watch that parade?”
before I could recreate you,” Castiel said, remembering what it had been like, seeing the very being of the hunter sitting in front of him, no barriers, just soul to grace. He blushed again, but this he knew was from what he’d been thinking about. “So now, when I heal you with my grace, it… knows without your body needing to tell it. It’s already been there, already constructed it atom by atom. I will never forget that, will never forget even a single piece of your body, Dean.” Castiel could feel his blush deepening as he spoke, knowing that it was all coming out sounding wrong, but it was like the words were speaking themselves.
Dean releases the nipple, thumbing over it as it hardens in the cool air. He keeps rubbing over it, as Cas kisses him again and the stimulation is making him ache for Dean. He breaks away to strip off his shirt and boxers. Dean takes the moment to kick off his own jeans.
Cas can’t sleep. He thought sleep was supposed to be easy, come upon humans unnoticed. But Cas often can’t stop thinking, or his heart beats so hard he can feel it in his whole body, or he just lies awake in quiet misery, hoping for unconsciousness, feeling more tense by the minute.
So it totally blindsides him when Sam corners in him in the war room and hisses, “Dean, you need to talk to Cas.”
They chat. Cas asks after Diran's kids, all well, the youngest has fallen in love with a kid's movie called Frozen. They talk about Nora and Cas's struggles with work, the way he's going around the store reading all the packages to understand what they are really selling. For some reason this makes Diran laugh.
“Roll over,” he orders. Cas rolls onto his back, staring up at Dean through half-closed eyes. He feels like he’s high.
He tries to bring the sensations to mind now. The taste of Cas on his tongue, the rush of fucking somewhere public, somewhere Cas
“Good?” Cas asks, pressing it back in. Dean can’t speak, too focused on the stretch. He whines when it pops back in.
Dean wonders what that means. He wonders what any of this means. Are he and Cas together? Did Cas just come here in the middle of the night to steal a kiss he knew would be rejected? Why?
“I’ll be right back,” Dean says quietly and takes his hand away. In his absence Cas feels cold and lonely. No doubt Dean will give Cas a towel to wipe away the mess and a glass of water and then kick him out of the cabin. Cas shivers, semen cooling on his face. His nakedness feels vulnerable, his ass is beginning to ache uncomfortably.
Cas looks up from his book, tilts his head, squints a little and stares at him. Were it anyone else, Dean would squirm under the scrutiny.
Through it all, Dean hasn’t given much thought to Sam. He tries to avoid alerting his brother to the bedsharing and they keep the PDA down to non-kissing in front of others and Sam never says anything. And Jack, well. Jack has Cas’s lack of understanding of human social rules and he’s so young. Dean doesn’t think he needs to explain to Jack yet.
“I still have 20 pages of reading to do Dean, and I won’t let you get  in the way of that. I am going to sit on your cock and you are going to be quiet and still and good for me. Can you do that for me?” Cas asks, and Dean’s heart is racing. He nods eagerly.
He sits on the edge of the tub, Cas’s hand on his knee. He gets a gets a new bandage, smoothes it down, then tapes it in place with practiced motions. Cas suppresses a shiver. Other than Mick’s hugs and holding baby Tanya, hardly anyone has touched him since Dean kicked him out. He wants more.
Dean gives him a minute, stroking over his back, kissing and sucking his neck and Cas is going to have a ring of hickeys tomorrow morning, he just knows it.
“Yes, Dean. I will make sure to get in the habit of being nosier. I am sure it will serve me well on our next hunt.”
A wedding with the family means flowers and dances and declarations of enteral love and it makes Dean’s skin crawl. Cas looks over at him.
“Sorry,” Cas mumbleds then hitches Dean’s shirt up to leave lingering open mouthed kisses on Dean’s chest, his nipples, down his sternum. Cas’s stubble drags along his skin, making him twitch. When Dean can’t stand it anymore, the press of lips and tongue against his body, reverent, illustrating his love on every inch of Dean’s skin, he groans out, “Cas,” and pulls the man up to kiss him again.
"Where did you even get these?" Dean doesn’t remember Cas grabbing either from where they keep the supplies at the head of the bed.
Dean collapses atop him as Cas is twitching through the aftershocks, groaning quietly into Cas’s hair as his hips jackrabbit, seeking his own orgasm. Cas keens when Dean comes, feeling him twitching inside. He can just barely feel the heat of come spilling deep inside him. He feels hot all over again.
He'd been dreaming about Dean. About sitting on the impala on the top of a great hill looking down on Dean going about his life. Watching the familiar creases around his eyes as he laughed, the charming quirk of his mouth when he's trying to be humorous, the gentleness of his hands as he helps someone away from danger and the ruthlessness of them as he kills.
Cas is much more straightforward. He palms Dean through his boxers, pressing against his dick until Dean groans.
What could he possibly say to Mick, or Diran or Nora even. He feels tired all the time, in a way sleep cannot reach. He will probably still feel so tired when his circumstances are not so dire. He's just heavy and he has nowhere to set himself down.
"Here, uh, there's a center in town. It's not a shelter but they will be able to help you better than we can." She rummages around her desk, then hands him a crumpled flier. He examines the cover.
It used to be that Dean was an open book, at least to Cas. He could see every flicker in his expression, every change in his soul, every emotion swirling behind his eyes. Cas didn't have the context for any of it back when he was an angel. He could read Dean but he didn't know the meaning. Now, cut off from heaven, Cas can't see Dean's soul. Only his tired human face, the scruff he hasn't bothered to shave off in days. His expressions, once so open to Cas, have gone tight and closed off, full of exasperation and anger and annoyance and cold determination. Cas doesn't know if Dean's expression means desire or annoyance right now, but he decides to be hopeful and sets off for his cabin, shirtless, through the downpour..
Dean moves his arms finally, to hold Cas against him as they recover. He sneaks his hands up the back of Cas’s shirt and holds him close, feeling his ribs expand under his hands.
“I was wondering when you were going to figure it out,” he says, inhaling sharply when Dean pinches his nipple.
“Or, they’re varying their patrol patterns regularly. There are reports of new tank tracks in different parts of the city every two weeks, which you would notice if you paid attention. They vary in eight week cycles, if I’m remembering correctly.” Cas is remembering correctly; he never misremembers anything. “Which means if you go north in two days you will run into some very unfriendly tanks on your way there,” he finishes off with a condescending little smile.
Cas takes a moment to appreciate his leader in wet jeans and oversized rain jacket and bare fucking feet on the porch. He looks human, touchable, dripping on the grey wood.
He could use help, he thinks, one evening alone in the gas-n-sip. His shoulder and hip ache from sleeping on the floor and he feels terribly heavy, all the time. He's not sure what to call this feeling. He's discovering that human emotions are large and he feels them in his whole body. His hands sweat when he's nervous, his neck gets hot when he's embarrassed, shame makes him feel like he's swallowed a hot coal. Fear makes his stomach drop. It really feels like it physically moves. It hurts. He's always amazed how much being human hurts, even gratitude, love, happiness, feel so big they hurt sometimes.
Cas laughed, dislodging a protesting Dean, but only for a moment. "I personally prefer green eyes and freckles underneath flannel," he said softly, running his hands through Dean's hair.
“I guess hindsight is always twenty twenty,” Cas said with a shrug. “Now I’m extra glad to have seen you.”
“Well,” Dean said with a cough, then seemed to finally gather himself together. “These past few months have been the freaking greatest,” he explained, and Castiel nodded along with him. “And I don’t want to ruin a good thing, but, well…” He paused, long enough for Castiel to make impatient go-on motions with his hands. “Well, I know we’re both omegas and all, but, well, I was wondering if maybe you’d want our next night out to be a date night, because I really, really want it to be.”
Dean rolled his eyes. "He's her only chance for grandkids, so that makes her even worse sometimes." Just in case it wasn't obvious, Dean added, "Yanno, because I'm gay." He paused, as if he were still slightly worried about homophobic backlash from his confession even after being in the modeling world for more than ten minutes.
“What’s going on?” Sam asked, before turning around himself. “Cas, why are you gliding towards Dean without moving your feet?” He asked, dumbfounded. Dean knew that feeling well, right now.
Dean definitely wasn’t gay, he knew that one for a fact. Women looked too good, felt too good in his arms, for him to be batting for the other team exclusively. But his.. Crush? Attraction? Whatever the hell it was that made him stare at Cas as if looking away was the worst fate imaginable, it was really making him think about things. Things he didn’t really want to be thinking about but wouldn’t get shoved down deep like they were supposed to. Not just about Cas, either. Looking back without his I’m-super-straight glasses on, he could remember seeing guys and thinking that they were attractive the same way he’d look at women, but again, he really, really thought he was as straight as it got, so he just told himself that he was admiring their clothing, or their general sense of style, or their confidence, or something even more ridiculous that would make him laugh now. If he weren’t so messed up about Cas, at least.
"Oh really, Dean?" Cas snapped back at him. "Like what? And don't say that gun fight with the swordsman." He was so angry at this point that he was half way to growling. If he still had his wings, they'd definitely be raised in a threatening position, the feathers ruffled to make them look even more dangerous.
The fact that he actually had to bother reminding himself of this basic bodily function only served to make Castiel feel even more nervous. Yeah, the guy was hot. Hell, just calling him hot was a huge understatement. He looked like he should be modeling for Hot Topic, not working in their chain store in a tiny Kansas mall in the middle of BFE. And the fact that he was so nice only seemed to make things worse for Castiel's big, throbbing puppy love crush.
Castiel sighed, trying to hide just how tempted he’d been at that suggestion. “It was all our family and friends, Dean, not just the ones we like.”
“Yes, you dunce,” Crowley said, though you could tell that the insult was meant to be endearing. As much as Castiel really did not like that demon right now, he could at least understand where he was coming from. It had taken him quite a few years to understand exactly what it was he’d felt towards the hunter, and he’d never quite known how to go about flirting in the first place, but even he had been frustrated by Dean’s blindness towards that aspect of their relationship.
“Sorry,” Castiel replied awkwardly, not sure if there was anything else he could do, now that he was done healing Dean’s burn.
Crowley smiled, laying on the charm extra thick this time. “Guilty as charged,” he admitted. "Though since you’re here anyway, I thought maybe we could hop out for a drink, just like the old days?”
Castiel immediately blushed as red as humanly possible, and was surprised when Dean did the same. "Uhh…" Castiel said, not sure what was appropriate at times such as these, when you weren't starring in a romantic comedy.
Sam covered his mouth to hide the worst of his laughter. “Dean being the one to move in closer to you,” he muttered, before returning to his barely concealed laughter.
"Go!" She yelled, loud enough that they probably heard her in the Rue 21 next door. She smiled as the two all but scrambled out of the store in fear. It was gonna be a bitch to clean up this mess alone, but at least those two dumbasses would finally stop tiptoeing around each other already.
Mind you, a big chunk of the perfection came, not from being in Heaven itself, but from the company. He patted the empty half of the bed when Cas came into the bedroom they shared.
Dean wanted to start small, wanting the pleasure Cas felt to build slowly, getting him hotter and hotter until he exploded, and not just physically. So he ever so slightly licked the drips of precum that had already gathered in anticipation. Cas' dick always seemed to know when it was going to be properly blown, acting like one of Pavlov's dogs, like it had somehow been trained. Dean smiled at the weird thought, knowing he'd never tell Cas about how obedient his dick was. As a treat for that obedience, though, Dean licked a slow stripe from the head downwards, until he hit pubes, then reversed and came the same way back up again.
The gasp was involuntary, impossible to keep to himself, and much louder than any of the other potential gasps would have been. This was, by and far, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, as well as the most erotic. It took mere moments before his erection was straining against his pants, almost to the point of being painful. And this, of course, was when Dean chose to turn around.
“Even worse, that he thought giving some kind of sex accessory thing at a party like that was a good idea,” Dean pointed out, before taking a drink from the bottle of beer at his side. “My mom could’ve seen it, or even worse, my grandma.” Charlie let out a giggle at that, but looked adequately apologetic after, so Dean was willing to forgive her.
Dean rolled his eyes, since this was definitely the lamest excuse yet for Cas’ leaning habit. “Have you maybe tried just not moving closer?” Dean asked sarcastically, trying his absolute hardest to ignore his little brother’s mostly silent giggles from the other side of the motel room.
Crowley shifted nervously in his seat, and Castiel couldn’t help but laugh silently to himself. As he’d guessed when Dean got the text, this was just another excuse for him to hit on Dean, and if Castiel hadn’t been there, the demon would probably be trying to get him to go somewhere for a date, even though he wouldn’t call it that.
"And Jo can start cleaning up the mess," Jo announced loudly, not that either of them were paying attention.
, Cas,” Dean said, having heard the angel’s muttering. “And Crowley’s always being a drama queen, so that’s nothing new.”
“Okay...” Cas responded, drawing it out and proving that he was starting to pick up on how people actually spoke in this century. He gave Dean another confused stare, this one going on a lot longer than the other, before going back to digging.
Dean pushed back with his hips, really putting his back into it, but he was no match for Cas' strength. So instead, he started to edge them to the left, towards his room with the bed and the big ass bottle of lube. Because while frottage is fun, it's also the most frustrating thing in the world when you just want to be slamming into someone at the most punishing pace that you can manage.
“Fuck yes,” Dean exclaimed before his brain could think better of it. It wasn’t every day you got such a polite invitation to be sexually destroyed, possibly while being held against the wall. That had always been a secret fantasy of his, and now…
Castiel let out a groan of both pleasure and displeasure as he forced his tongue into Dean's mouth and shoved his fingers into Dean's hair. Dean was giving as good as he got, though, his own tongue reenacting their earlier battle of wills, his teeth rending another tear into Cas' already battered and bleeding chapped bottom lip. He grabbed hold of the angel's unbelievably toned ass, shoving their bodies together in a harsh way that promised to ache as soon as they bothered to pay attention to it.
Dean blushed, and Castiel couldn't help but grin like an idiot at how adorable it was. "Thanks, I tried to do my best so you wouldn't get yelled at."
“Exactly,” Dean replied, before they stared at the box again, stunned. They only managed to shake out of it when they saw the gift tag that had been attached to the box’s wrapping.
He was still pretty sure that nobody had really noticed, especially not Cas. As much as he l… fuck it, as much as he loved the guy, he was pretty oblivious to a lot of human stuff. Sam might have an idea, maybe, but he was probably just teasing him about the eye contact thing to be the annoying little brother than he is. He didn’t notice much of anybody giving him suspicious looks, either, strangers and friends alike, so at least he wasn’t being too obvious about it all. Yet.
Castiel rolled his eyes, but he at least gave her a small smile. He was about to recall all the filthy things they’d done in bed in the few weeks they’d been seeing each other, since the guy had only been insufficient in the intellectual areas, but he was at work, and he was supposed to at least pretend he was a professional. “You said the model was ready?” He asked Meg, giving her a glare to remind her to go back to pretending, as well.
If he had any guts at all, he'd’ve just asked the guy out ages ago. Dean didn't seem to have a homophobic bone in his body, so even if he was super straight he wouldn't have been grossed out by Castiel asking. He'd even been on the cash register the day Castiel had bought those gay pride rainbow pins a few months back. And he'd given him that wink he just loved to give Castiel, like they had an inside joke just because they were constantly bumping into each other here.
Cas started untangling their limbs as he nodded. After a few quick flashes from his angel mojo, they got off the now clean bed and put their now fixed clothing onto their now clean and undamaged bodies. Cas only left the headboard as is because Dean liked to count the broken ones as trophies. This was the third one this month.
“First, it’s a Butterfinger, and second, you’re gonna love the rest of this stuff too, I promise,” Dean said, his hands already digging through the colorful wrappers to find the next treat. “Here, this one’s a Snickers,” Dean explained as he handed over the foil wrapped candy.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean let out, freezing for a second in a way he hadn’t since he was about twelve, then he was pushed to the side as Cas positioned himself in front to defend him. The vamp didn’t have a chance, and his head slid off to the floor before the body even got close to Dean. “Son of a bitch,” Dean muttered, this time aimed at himself.
The meeting goes on, Cas shooting little holes in Dean’s plans and Dean getting more and more frustrated. Cas could tell Dean these things in advance; Cas could be transparent but they would end up having these same conversations anyway only then Cas would have to look in Dean’s eye and know he doesn’t care. So Cas argues, he argues just to argue, just to bother Dean, just to entertain himself but mostly he wants the aftermath. He wants this: Dean at the end of the meeting, quietly seething, “What is your fucking problem?” Dean punctuates his question with a shove.
Cas finds his first orgasm like that, grinding tightly on Dean, gasping, held, Dean teasing one nipple as he shudders. It’s a bright little orgasm, over too quick.
“We can do that,” Cas tells him and for a second Dean, expects Cas to push him face down into the bed and tug the toy out and fuck him like that.
Things don’t get easier with Dean at the motel room. There had been smiles in the car but after Dean had burst out “Damn it, Cas! Just let me take you back to the motel!” things have been tense. So, as soon as they get into the room, Cas flees for the showers.
When Cas climbs back into his lap, he straddles one of Dean’s thighs. His thighs are things of beauty and Cas wants to worship them, wants to be buried in them, wants to drag him out of every fucking command meeting where he’s wearing that infuriating thigh holster to fuck him urgently in the back of the cabin.
Cas levels him with a stern look. That look used to make Dean smile, or at least roll his eyes in exasperation. Now there's only cold suspicion. Cas turns his head back up to the sky enjoying the late summer rain wetting his hair and dripping steadily down his face, over his nose, over his lips. It's a little like being held by the storm.
“Cas!” Dean snaps, and he clicks back into attention. Dean’s all tight lipped and military straight these days. Brittle, Cas thinks.
"Gotcha,” he points to a gap in the wood ceiling. As they look, a handful of hornets come crawling out. “Tell Al to get out here and kill the fucking things for me," he snaps at Cas.
Dean examines his work. “That should do it. You gonna be ok while I deal with the body?” He’s not looking Cas in the eye. He wonders what he’s done wrong this time.
What can Cas say? 'I caused my whole family to fall from heaven and my only human friends turned me out for no reason I can understand.' 'I am afraid and hungry and I do not understand this world, nor how to navigate it.'
Is he a man? He's never really considered his gender before. He's been comfortable in this vessel, comfortable with the way humans respond to him while in this vessel. Mostly. The way Dean responds to him, pulling him close and then pushing him away when Cas steps too close is not his favorite. The way he so willingly touches women, touched Anna, but so rarely touches Cas, no matter how he earns for it. And the way the men in the shower responded to him, the new awareness of his own otherness, even now away from them, settles in his stomach like lead. What
Cas shakes out his hair again, just to annoy Dean. "Wish you would let me cut it--" Dean says, wiping droplets from his face.
“What is Dean explaining?” a new voice calls from the mezzanine and there’s Jack, back from visiting Claire with no warning at all, stepping right into the mess of Dean’s life.
Steve knows Rhea. She's easy to work with, very quiet, sometimes follows Cas around like she's lost.
“Dean, if I wanted something else, if I wanted to be somewhere else, I would have gone there already. I have nowhere else I want to be and no one else I want to be with.”
He takes his harness off, leaving it in the bathroom, and washes his hands, comes back with a damp towel for Cas.
“Cas,” he moans out. He’s not flexible enough, not with his knees set wide to give Cas a full view of his cock, now fully hard, and his hole split open on the toy.
Sex with Cas somehow always feels like this, like Cas is making new universes inside Dean, making him glow from the inside out. Sometimes, Dean wonders if Cas did manage to keep some tiny sliver of grace in him that he can only use to give Dean earth shattering orgasms.
Dean loves this, the ache in his jaw, the taste of Cas on his tongue, the velvet heat, the way his eyes water when Cas holds him down just a moment too long. He’s just a vessel for Cas’s pleasure, for his love, rough and beautiful and tender.
He ends up not having to ask, because Mick texts him that night, "You should Come to the bookstore tonight! There's a poetry reading! It's free"
Thankfully, Dean saw through it as well. “Bullshit,” he said, making Castiel smile in relief. “You’ve been acting like a total jerk to Cas, for no freaking reason, for the last few months,” he retorted.
“You would eventually get over it,” Castiel replied stiffly. He knew that Dean still mourned his lost loved ones, like Ellen and Jo, but he didn’t let it interfere with protecting the world and his current loved ones.
He’d hung out with his best friend Benny for a bit, but that hadn’t really been thrilling because they’d just hung out two weeks ago when Dean threw a barbecue for his family and friends, and the Cajun teddy bear and his wife had traveled all twenty minutes to get there. Seeing his ex, Lisa, had been nice, especially since he’d also got to learn everything there was to know about her awesome son, Ben. It had been an amicable break up, so there hadn’t been any awkwardness, but still, there were only so many cell phone pictures of a kid that a single guy could look at before they all blended together in his memory. He’d said hi to a few other people he remembered, polite chit about about basic topics, but those never really lasted for more than a minute or so.
“Shit!” was Dean’s first response at seeing Castiel behind him. He hastily pulled his shirts down, though the blush easily told Castiel that Dean most likely knew exactly what the angel had just seen. “It’s not what it looks like,” he rushed out. “It was… a gag gift? I was out of clean boxers? I mean, it’s not like...” Dean babbled, his blush deepening as he spoke.
They leaned against each other, holding themselves up as they laughed until they could barely breathe.
Cas chuckled again, before accepting the coffee and the handful of different types of creamer and sugar/sugar substitutes. “Thanks, I’d love a cup,” he said, smiling, as he opened the lid and started pouring damn near everything in. “There was an older couple looking at your stuff not too long after you left, and I told them you’d be back soon.” He smiled again, and Dean started to (agnostically) pray that the guy wasn’t straight or attached or something, because that would just be way too unfair. And if his gaze wandered to Cas’ ringless left hand, could you really blame him?
“And, umm… I thought maybe you’d want this, too?” Cas asked, turning shades of red that Dean hadn’t known existed outside of a tube of paint.
“Well shit,” Dean said, finally catching up. “I’m with Cas now, man. You seriously need to stop all of this. I’m not dumping him any time soon, and it sure as hell won’t be for you, Crowley.” Dean finally looked properly upset for the circumstances, and Castiel was the one who got to smile smugly now. Finally.
"But I'm oblivious and stupid sometimes," Castiel finished for him, even though those weren't the words Dean would've chose. "Really stupid," Castiel repeated, looking at Dean again, marveling at just how green his eyes were. He'd never been close enough to notice before.
“It kinda worries me that your brother thought that buying your engagement present at what had to have been a sex shop was a good idea,” Charlie said through a mouth of food, before quickly swallowing the chewed pizza in embarrassment.
Castiel chuckled at Dean's accidental accuracy. "I have the apartment already, and that's way better than any medal." He smiled again, fully aware that this was definitely the happiest he'd been in a while, especially considering he was at work.
Physical attraction, physical acts of said attraction, had never seemed like they’d mean much to Castiel, but he was struggling to breathe even though he didn’t need to, as he opened his mouth further, exploring Dean’s as his was explored in return. He landed in Dean’s lap, feeling what could only be Dean’s physical attraction to him. There were wants, needs, desires, that Castiel felt, and he wanted to indulge in every single one of them.
As a photographer at a model agency, Castiel has of course has dated some of the talent over the years, but when the newest model, Dean Winchester, steps into his studio, he knows that this time is different because Dean is definitely different.
“We fake destroy them,” Dean explained, without really explaining anything. At the look of further confusion, he tried to explain his explanation. “The boxers, like yours, only we fake destroy them, then send ‘em back.”
“I don’t need a babysitter, damn it,” Dean growled at his brother. He’d been a chick, at least physically, for only a few hours, but he was already hating how everybody was treating him like a soft, delicate little flower, or something equally as breakable. He’d been hunting monsters for decades, so even in a different body, that should count for something, right? “I’m not weak,” he grumbled so that only Cas could hear him.
“Don’t pull too hard, it’s a pretty weak bone,” Sam told Jack as Mrs. Butters started the countdown.
“You’re only saying that because all the nuisances were on your side,” Dean teased, even though he was basically right.
“I had just thought, since we were mimicking a heterosexual porn movie, that adding in a few extra details might make up for the fact that, unlike the actual babysitter, I’m not female.”
All this time, Castiel was watching in a mixture of fascination and horror as his feet drifted in Dean’s general direction at a snail’s pace. “Did you miss any hidden hex bags when you checked in?” he asked the brothers, since it was the most obvious place to start.
Finding a pair of boots that fit his new girl sized feet wasn't too humiliating, and neither was grabbing a somewhat random pile of jeans from the women's clothing section. He was beet red by the time he got to the self checkout, though. There wasn't enough beer and pie in the world to make him face a real person behind a register, but even looking at the stuff as he scanned each item felt like torture. He did the bras and undies as quickly as possible, and all but ran out the door when he was done and paid up.
“Got all them muscles really working for you,” Dean flirtingly teased again, going so far as to flutter his lashes even though Cas couldn’t see it.
Castiel was staring in awe at the omega who had gone through hell and back, and had only come out stronger. “Wow,” he muttered. “I hope I can be even half as amazing as you some day.” He’d blurted that one without thinking, as well, but this time he was okay with that. Even though he barely knew the guy, Dean was now his new hero.
“Then stay, have a beer or two, you could probably use the company.” Dean patted Cas on the back as he went past, loving the feel of the trenchcoat fibers beneath his fingertips. Yeah, he would have to learn to be a lot less lame if he were ever to spill his big bi crush secret.
Castiel nodded along, no longer just trying to be polite. The way Dean told the story, it almost felt like a soap opera drama on television, and Castiel couldn’t turn the channel if he tried.
Dean chuckled, making his eyes, and the rest of his face, look even better. "Sounds like we were both pretty stupid."
Mrs. Butters let out a sigh, and seemed more pouting than insulted. “You poor angels, not even getting to enjoy a little green bean casserole for the holidays.” She let out a huff, before placing a consoling hand on Cas’ shoulder. There was a quick flash of unexpected light, then as everybody else was blinking away the afterimages, she picked Cas’ plate back up and started to heap on the different foods. “There, that fixes that. It’s only temporary, but at least you won’t feel left out now.”
Everybody in that apartment slept happily that night. Except for Ben, who woke up two hours later with an unhappily soggy diaper. But after that was changed and he was back in dreamland a few minutes later, everybody went back to sleeping happily.
“Wasn’t any other empty tables, so I figured you could share ours,” Dean explained when Castiel was close enough to hear him. Emma was eating her hot fudge sundae as if she’d been starving for years while the baby happily gummed one of the soft pretzels Castiel had seen behind the counter.
“Yes, I have been flirting mercilessly with you for years, Dean,” Crowley spelled out slowly. “And yet you had the bad taste to pick Feathers over here, who couldn’t flirt his way out of a bloody paper bag,” he said, an aggravated hiss to his tone. “We could’ve been so much more,” he finished, sounding far more smug than anybody should after a declaration like that.
Castiel scooted in closer to stare Dean directly in the eyes. No way was he getting out of praise this time, no matter how much it seemed to embarrass him. “Thank you, Dean, for doing this for me,” he said slowly, watching the golden flecks in Dean’s otherwise green eyes move about as his eyes refocused. “I really appreciate it.”
“No problem,” Dean said with a chuckle. “Us solo-flying omegas have to stick together out here in the big bad world.” He grinned, making Castiel’s knees feel weak, before grabbing a napkin from the mound that was on the table in front of him and clearing off a line of drool that was about to drop from his son’s pretzel.
Of course it did, Samuel. Women don’t often get ‘emotionally constipated’ like your dear brother. A little more trust next time would be appreciated.
“No, now!” She shrieked. Castiel’s good mood from meeting Dean deflated, and he unbuckled her from her stroller to try and stop the ensuing temper tantrum before it went any farther. “Now, Daddy!”
Castiel tilted his head to the side in confusion for a few seconds, before he caught up with what exactly Dean was asking him. “Well, with most people the grace goes where the body knows that it’s needed. The human body knows itself a lot better than I ever could, so it directs my power as necessary.”
Dean let out a tortured sigh and stared Castiel in the face. “Dude, it means you can eat all the candy you want, and actually
“You know damn well those washboard abs of yours turn me on every time,” Dean answered, walking over to run his hands along them for a visual aid.
“Next model’s ready,” Meg called into the studio as Castiel set up the specialized equipment he’d be using for this particular shoot.
Castiel was looking through his camera lens, trying to find the best lighting for this backdrop, when he was interrupted by a pointed cough. “The lady said I can just leave the robe by the door, right?” The young man’s voice made Castiel internally wince. Not another clueless newbie. The agency was supposed to train everybody that came through before they were sent Castiel’s way, but he still ended up having to explain how the process went to at least half the new models, and this guy sounded clueless enough to make that fate all but inevitable now.
“Really?” Dean asked, his bravado slowly returning. “Is it the gauziness that you like? Or maybe the stitching?”
“Actually, Cas,” Dean started to say, already looking as embarrassed as he had that first day when Castiel had told him how brave he’d been. “I’m hopefully not reading this wrong or anything,” Dean continued, looking like he was having trouble getting the words out.
“Heya, Cas,” Dean managed to say without sounding awkward. How fair was it that Cas had only gotten hotter as he aged? Because seriously, damn.
As the two got up to take the bone from the nymph, Dean teased Jack. “I’m not gonna go easy on you, just because you’re a kid, you know.”
Movies always made high school reunions look way more interesting than this, Dean thought as he scanned the barely decorated gymnasium. It had been ten years since he’d been here, and the school really hadn’t changed a bit. It was both nostalgic and depressing at the same time, because this place had sucked when he went here, and it looked like it still did.
“So you like the little bow?” Dean purred, leaning in towards the angel, eyes already blown with lust. “I have others with little bows,” he teased. “Maybe I can show you them, too.”
“I know you wouldn’t, Cas, and that’s probably one of the reasons I love you, but, well…” Dean looked down at his current body, at the bumps under his shirt and the strands of hair that had fallen out of his poorly done ponytail that were falling over his small shoulders, the hands in his lap so small and petite compared to the ones he’d seen and barely noticed for most of his life. “I think, if we’re going to do anything,” he said reluctantly, looking back up at Cas so that the angel could see what he meant as he spoke. “If we do anything, I don’t want it to be like this. With me like this. I don’t know how long I’m gonna be stuck as a girl, but I want you, and I want me, to know that this has nothing to do with female hormones or womanly urges or anything like that. I want to look at you as a man, and still love you, still want you, and I want you to look at me as a man when I say it. Does that even make sense?”
When Dean finally did look away, it was to pull into an empty parking lot. He turned the stereo and the car off, and only smiled when Castiel gave him his most confused expression, with extra head tilt and everything.
The first glimpse, and it was the briefest of glimpses, of the hidden lace that caught Castiel’s attention and kept it in a vice hold, happened after a rather vigorous hunt in the middle of October. There were always more cases during this month that any other, because the holiday made otherwise normal people bring out the Ouija boards and spell books, and take to forest clearings to perform rituals that they had no actual understanding of, so hunters had to deal with the aftermath of those things as well as the usual threats.
“Sam said to come get you, because dinner’s ready,” he explained, and a mild tingle went down Dean’s spine at how much the angel’s voice affected him lately.
“Stupid oven mitt had a hole in it,” Dean complained as the grace did its healing work. He nudged one boot at the floor pie sadly. “That was gonna taste so good,” he said wistfully.
Cas stretched out his fingers a few more times before removing them. Dean muttered swears under his breath as Cas lubed himself up. The hunter was already to his third 'fucking sadist angel' when Cas pushed his whole cock in at once. "Fuuuuuckkkk!!!" Dean all but shrieked. "Fuck yes, Cas!"
“We need to talk about everything first,” Castiel reminded him, “but yes, afterwards. A rain check.”
“I’m Castiel,” Castiel finally said as he held his hand out to shake, only just realizing that he’d never introduced himself.
Dean grabbed a cart and kept his head down in shame as he headed towards the underwear section. He grimaced as he grabbed a few different bras, hoping that his guess from the short yet traumatizing time he was naked earlier was right for at least one of these. He threw in a few packs of underwear in different sizes as well, before he headed to the shoes.
Dean was back in his artist zone, having reached a spot in the drawing that didn’t need constant observation of the attractive subject, when he was startled by a cough. Remembering where he was and why he was there, he looked up to greet the potential customer. Instead of starting his sales pitch, worthy of a fast food employee from saying the same things over and over, he almost dropped his sketchpad when it turned out to be Cas instead. He slammed the pad shut at the speed of sound, covering up the sonic boom of embarrassment with a little chuckle. Thankfully, he’d been holding it upright, so Cas most likely hadn’t seen what, or better who, he’d been drawing.
A few minutes and a few inches later, Dean was already getting bored. He’d tried teasing Cas in a couple different ways, because he was in a petulant kind of mood that way, but the angel hadn’t fallen for any of them, so now it was just the sound of crickets and the shovel hitting the dirt. The movement of Cas digging was actually kind of mesmerizing if you paid attention. Since angels didn’t get tired the way humans did, it was all very smooth and even. Shovel down, dig up dirt, shovel up, throw dirt, repeat as necessary. And hell, was Cas always that built underneath all that frumpy clothing?
“Uh, thanks?” Cas replied, his momentum faltering at the comment. Dean mentally celebrated his success.
“Hell, I’m kinda really digging you being a guy,” Dean admitted. “If I’d known gay sex was this great when I was younger…”
Giving Cas her own apologetic look, Charlie tried to continue scheming, but failed miserably even after concentrating really, really hard. “Yeah, he is definitely weird like that,” she said forlornly when she finally admitted to herself that she’d given up. “So that kind of takes away a lot of our options.”
Feelings. Ugh. They were never Dean’s strong suit. Or at least talking about them. That was one of the great things about Sam: he never really had to say things in words, his brother just knew. A quick, manly hug, a pat on the back, then share a few beers, maybe look up at the sky for a while, and they were good to go. Even when it was literally life or death, the only real difference was a tighter hug, maybe a tear or two if it’s really bad, but even then there was no real real talk of feelings.
“Then why’d you shove me aside? You never pull that overprotective bullshit when I’m a guy,” Dean snapped back, the unconscious part of his brain putting these feelings away in order to never treat women like this, after he turned back into a guy. If he turned back. Oh god, he hoped he’d turn back.
It all started with Eileen’s birthday party three months ago. Dean knew how much she adored his paintings, so he’d decided to make one for her as a present. Her and Sam already had a couple canvases of his hanging in their house, though, so he figured he’d try something different this time. He’d gotten one of those wooden plank things, the ones that are supposed to look like old wood found in the forest and not at Michael’s in the craft section, and he’d painted a happy little woodland scene, complete with a moose in the background (might as well include Sammy in the picture somewhere, right?). She’d loved it, of course, and he’d thought that had been the  end of it. But then all her friends oohed and ahhed over it, begging her to tell them where she got it so that they could buy a bunch of them, as well. That was when the idea for him getting a booth at the craft show that was held the second weekend of every other month at the rec center downtown popped into her head. He'd tried to resist, but they’d even got their oldest daughter into it, with her puppy dog eyes that were already on par with her father’s, even though she was only four and a half.
He looks at Dean, who for some reason is still here. He didn’t take off last night, insisted Cas come back to the motel room with him, shared a bed with him, and now, is offering to take him to breakfast. Cas has no idea what Dean wants. Cas wants to spend more time with Dean, even if it hurts.
Right as he's wondering about who in the camp might want to commit probably well earned murder against him, he hears the steps creaking. He tenses, trying to reach for the knife under his pillow. Of course, he doesn't fucking have it because his future self wanted him to sleep in the middle of unknown terrorist completely defenseless. So he just waits as the person at the door jiggles the handle, then inserts a key. Dean’s trying to control his heartbeat, trying to appear like he’s sleeping, trying to convince himself that anyone with a key to this cabin is clearly welcome and if they aren't, his future self probably sleeps with a dozen guns.
“Shhh-- just let me,” he doesn’t finish, just watches Cas take his fingers easily, beautifully until Dean can’t stand it anymore and Cas is bucking his hips asking for more.
Cas watches Dean. He looks good, thigh holster on, pointing at the map like he knows what he’s talking about.
Dean gives a stifled sigh, “I’ll review the reports tomorrow morning. As a precaution, we’ll go west instead.”
“Dean was just explaining to Sam that we go married,” Cas says and Dean throws him a withering look.
It’s not really their business anyway, to know that Dean and Cas have started kissing in their free time.
The pink one isn’t too long or even too thick, just a pleasant easy size, something Cas has used to fuck Dean in the past.
They’ve just crossed the state line into Ohio when Dean says, “I can’t date but I wouldn’t mind if we were committed.”
Dean’s warm and solid and dry behind him and he hooks his chin over Cas’s shoulder, holding him fast. This is the kind of tenderness, the kind of touching, that Dean so rarely allows himself. It is also the tenderness Cas so desperately craves. He’s got one hand low on Cas’s belly, fingers edging into his boxers, thumb stroking the soft skin curve of his belly. The other arm is wrapped around his ribcage, one hand cupping a breast.
“You deserve so much more than this life. I would make it so you never hurt again, if I could. But I cannot, so please you must look out for yourself.”
Cas shrugs, laying back, stroking himself lazily. His cock is hard and pink against his belly, he’s flushed and gazing up at Dean like he’s never seen him before.
When he gets out, Dean’s not there. He sighs, pulling on a pair of boxers and an oversized cotton sweater. Then he hops into bed and pulls out his pipe.
In the following lull of conversation, Dean sees him fidgeting. Cas opens his mouth a few times, then close it again. Dean tries to wait him out.
Cas lolls his head back, smiling at Dean. His hair brushes the back of his neck. It’s a good feeling so he rolls his head again, enjoying it.
He doesn’t call Dean. He doesn’t text Sam. He does check in regularly with Diran. He talks with Nora regularly. He meets up with Marin at a local pay as you will cafe in town for coffee. He starts sleeping in the the back of the gas-n-sip, once the queer friendly shelter ran out of space again. He had no idea college towns had such problems with homelessness.
“You can move your hips but be good for me and leave your hands there,” he finally tells Dean as he lets go of Dean’s wrists. Dean would do anything to be good for Cas.
No one follows him from the showers but a heavy set man with a towel wrapped around his waist sits at the end of the row and watches Cas intently. He scrubs his body dry quickly in the little locker room. He gets the towel wet in a puddle on the scuffed blue tile but he doesn't dare grab another dry towel for himself. He dresses quickly, heart racing, feeling urgently like he needs to run, aware of the man
it reads in big letters across the top. There's a rainbow underneath and then a little description reading
It's an old white Ford pickup. The windshield has a dramatic crack spanning half the glass and Cas wonders if Dean could fix that. Probably, given the time. The cab smells like cigarettes and incense.
“Yeah, ok, gimme a minute,” he shifts to get up, but Cas hooks a leg around his hip, draws him in for another kiss and to press his hard cock against Dean’s belly.
“Will you shut the fuck up and let me finish? Cas and I love each other but we’re not really conventional. We don’t really do the whole romance thing. We just, we want to spend the rest of our lives together, as friends.”
Dean takes him by the hips, guiding Cas’s movements. Cas gets hard against Dean, swollen and wet and eager for Dean to be inside him. He keeps going, Dean’s skin getting wet from Cas’s arousal. Dean puts up with it until finally he loses patience and pulls Cas close with hands on his ass.
But Dean’s also gotten better at feeling like his worth is stored in things other than his dick. So, he takes a deep breath through the sting of rejection, and says with a smile that's not a lie, "Maybe later?"
They chat about camp matters over dinner, the raid on a hospital planned for Thursday, how the three newcomers are settling in, how Cas’s weed garden is going.
“In that case, would you take this to the bathroom please,” he says, because he’s reasonable, and a graduate student and doesn’t have time to have sex time Dean gets a little horny.
“Wouldn’t do that either. Roads are mostly impassable that way.” It’s a tiny bit of an exaggeration. The roads are passable, but just barely.
Cas stays in the bathroom, dressing his wound, rather than follow Dean to the crib where he is putting Tanya down. He wishes he could watch. Dean’s hands are so gentle. He is so full of kindness and he doesn’t even know.
“We don’t. I am a poor example of an angel. Especially now. But I choose Jimmy for a reason, though, I am still unsure what that reason was.”
Dean doesn’t give a whole lot of thought to what others will even think of their relationship until one hunt where some witch called their love a meaningless little unconsummated trifle. It’s stupid. It’s stupid to feel bad about the words of a mass murdering witch and yet, back at the motel, while Cas is in the shower, Dean works himself into a panic. They don’t fuck, Dean doesn’t take Cas on dates, no one’s ever seen them kiss, they’re the only people in the world who know how devoted they are to each other and suddenly that doesn’t feel like enough. Sure he loves Cas but not in any way he can explain. He wants Cas to be with him every day but not – but not what. Not really, not fully, not the way the movies tell him he should want Cas.
Cas nods. He’s so hot he feels like he’s burning, like Dean’s turned the cabin into a sauna, like Dean’s focus on him is the heat of the midday sun beating down.
takes notes in the margins. He squeezes around Dean every once in a while or shifts a little, rocking back and forth, a little tease of how Dean’s going to get fucked later if he’s good and God he wants to be good.
“I didn’t think it was relevant,” Cas says easily, which is a lie. He doesn’t tell Dean these things by force of habit now. Dean’s not going to listen to him anyway, and the frustration of telling him over and over until he deigns Cas’s warnings worthy of hearing is much less fun than Dean’s frustration, in the middle of a meeting, when Cas gets to cut him down.
“Just-- Let me,” Dean takes the lighter, it’s his lighter, the silver one he’s fished out of the ashes of funeral pyres more times than he can probably count. Cas leans in and lets Dean light the joint for him.
He finds himself putting on an episode of Next Generation and holding up his arm one night, waiting for Cas. Cas passes him the popcorn and fits himself into the space of Dean’s arm. Dean draws him in by the waist and starts explaining Star Trek lore through mouthfuls of popcorn and it really doesn’t feel any different than before.
They don't fuck that day. Cas is slow and sleepy from his nap. They watch Prince of Egypt while eating stew instead, because Cas was raised under a fucking rock and never really got to watch movies before moving in with Dean and because Dean will never admit it but Prince of Egypt was his favorite movie growing up.
“The music, can’t hear it. Turn it up.” So Cas does and it’s terrible 80s pop and Dean would like to know where the fuck Cas got a taste for 80s pop music anyway.
Cas shrugs. “Could be interesting,” he replies, amused at Dean’s exasperated expression. "What do you want? what does the great leader seek today?" Cas asks and just to wind him up more he strips out of his soaked shirt, wringing it out on the ground.
Cas’s moans go high and frantic. He shakes under Dean, hips twitching. He collapses under Dean, gasping. Dean follows, pressed to his back. He strokes Cas’s sweaty hair, as Cas breathes, eyes closed, smiling into the pillow.
After that he wanders, looking at the titles. There's a small collection of poems: Whitman, Corral, Vuong, Waites, Sappho, Lorde, Hughs. There were children's books, fiction books, romance novels with well muscled young men in cowboy hats and assless chaps on the cover. There’s even a section on spirituality and religion with titles like
Dean kisses the top of his head. They lay like that as Cas catches his breath. Cas traces idle patterns over Dean’s chest, his stomach, touches his half-hard dick through his pajama pants in a lazy kind of way.
Dean reaches for the whiskey and drinks straight from the bottle. He grabs his blanket and pillow and hightails it out the front door, leaving it unlocked, praying he won't run into himself.
“Actually, Sam, I am quite happy with my relationship with Dean,” Cas says from the mezzanine and Dean just about has a heart attack from the shock.
It goes on like that. Sometimes on cold nights or on hunts with just the two of them they share a bed. He wakes up with Cas plastered against his back a couple of times. Sometimes they’re just in bed together, Cas’s hand clenched in his shirt, or their backs pressed together in the mornings. Cas wakes him up after a nightmare once and wordlessly shuffles into Dean’s arms, shuddering faintly.
"Enjoying the rain," Cas answers, blowing water off his lips to answer. There's no answer and when he looks over, Dean is standing there staring at him, oversized rain jacket zipped up tight. The hood, which he’s got pulled up, makes him look like a little kid dressed by his mother. It would be more endearing if Dean weren't looking at him like he’s taken leave of his senses.
“Come up here,” Dean opens his arms, choosing not to care about the wet spot or how sweaty and gross they both are.
Dean pauses to think about it, about all the times he’s touched Cas, reached for him, comforted him.
Dean huffs but once he's done cleaning himself up and tossing the damp towel at the chair he shuffles up to the head of the bed and into Cas’s arms.
“Actually,” Jeremy pipes up, “That’s not true. We were out that way last week and they’re bad but still manageable.”
“If you give me a few minutes I can help you with that,” Cas says, nodding down to where Dean’s holding the base of his silicone cock, rubbing it against his dick underneath.
“It would be accurate to say I am also trans,” Cas offers. His voice is steady but for some reason, his heart is racing.
Cas’s eyes gleam and he smiles, sweet and a little diabolical. He grabs the lube again, slicks Dean up, and wipes his hand on the sheet, making Dean wince. Dean’s ready for Cas to slide down on him but Cas only lets his cock slip inside a bit before drawing back and grinding their cocks together.
Cas thinks about that for a moment. Does crying at poems make him a person? Does kindness to insects make him a person? Does any of it make him whole? How can he be a whole person when hardly anyone knows his name?
“Who’d you let fuck you?” he says, rubbing slowly at Cas’s dick. Cas can feel how wet his underwear is, even now.
“Here,” Cas stands for a minute, shucking his pants, and Dean only gets to admire his half hard cock for a second before Cas settles behind him, pulling Dean against his chest. He takes some of Dean’s weight, kisses and sucks at his neck, bites at his ear. As he’s doing it, he slips a hand down to rub at Dean’s cock. Dean groans and fucks down on the toy. He could probably come just like this if he really wanted to, but Cas says with lips pressed to Dean’s ear, “Go ahead, show me how badly you want me.”
Except he can’t move. Anything he does will make them aware he’s awake. He’s in view of the exits but unfortunately so is future Dean, from his bed, which is strategically placed as Dean’s own sleeping location. And Dean is vehemently opposed to making them aware that he's awake. He might just combust of embarrassment. Besides who is he to stand in the way of whatever the fuck those two have going on?
Cas leans down, still cradling Dean’s face, and kisses him. The angle is bad, with Dean sitting on the bed and Cas still standing. Dean’s tugging on Cas, trying to get him down here, closer. Cas breaks away only to kneel between Dean’s knees. Dean inhales sharply, looking at Cas. Cas brushes a thumb along his cheekbone, down to press against his bottom lip. Dean exhales against Cas’s finger. Cas tilts his head to the side, gently guiding, to leave open mouthed kisses on his throat, under his ear.
Dean comes first, arching, bucking up into Cas hard, making Cas cry out and lose his balance. Cas comes only a second after Dean, clamping down around Dean as he comes, groaning and collapsing against Dean’s chest.
Dean doesn't answer. He's frozen still as a curious hornet nudges at his nose. No one breathes as it explores Dean's face, then his jacket.
Cas doesn't really understand humans' relationship with their own nakedness. He understands the vulnerability of it. He can understand protecting the body from the sun, the cold, insects, from abrasive surfaces. But the need to hide the body from the eyes of others, the way Dean is fiercely protective of his own nakedness, that he’s never quite understood though.
“You’re assuming the military is patrolling the east based on Gavin’s report,” Dean nods. “Two week before his report Mel’s team reported tank tracks to the north.”
“Dean, you’re so good for me. So good, taking my cock like this. Such a good slut for me,” Cas is rambling. He’s back to stoking Dean’s cock, letting Dean hold the knot inside himself. It’s good, way better than he thought it was going to be. He forgets why he was nervous in the first place. He’s already half thinking about getting a bigger size.
Dean plucks the joint from his fingers. “Come here,” he says, voice low and steady and still gentle.
For a second, Dean is still, hands against Cas’s chest. He might leave now, or kiss Cas, or wrap a hand around his throat. The idea makes Cas’s hands shake. What a strange thing, to have hands that shake while Dean looks at him and decides his fate.
The first hit Dean lands on his ass makes Cas cry out as he clenches around the dildo. The feeling is overwhelming, bright and almost painful in how hard Cas clenches. But god, it feels good too, to be full and seen and gasping under Dean’s hands. Dean lands a second hit on Cas’s other cheek, then repeats, giving Cas no time to recover. Cas cries out, trying his best to stay still for Dean, but jolting and twisting a little at each hit.
"That's what I was thinking." It’s mid afternoon in their shitty little downtown apartment. Cas has  been dutifully studying but Dean’s been thinking about getting his mouth on Cas since this morning, when they laid in bed and kissed lazily for an hour.
“Ok, ok. I’m gonna shower. You just, I’ll try to be quiet, stay on my side of the bed and all that. Kick me if I snore too loud.”
“You like it,” he gasps out, “The door,” he pauses to gasp as Dean slips out accidentally. Dean guides his dick back in. “You like that they could see us fucking. Your dick, ah, oh fuck, your dick in me.”
Cas laughs, low and designed to be alluring and Dean mouths at Cas’s throat, biting and sucking at it. He keeps it up, rubbing Cas’s dick over his boxers and sucking at his throat, until Cas is putty against him.
Cas imagines it, the way he would look right now, his hole stretched around Dean, Dean deep in him about to come and leave him dripping. And Dean’s the only one he lets come in him. Cas has got enough condoms to last at least a few years and everyone but Dean has to use them. Only Dean gets this and Dean knows it.
“Or I’ll get the vibrating plug and make you wear it while I edge you until you cry,” he says and it’s not an idle threat. He’s done it before and Dean had actually cried.
They talk. Eventually, Marin orders them a pizza. It’s greasy, heavy, filling and the smell alone makes his mouth water. It’s maybe the best thing he’s ever tasted.
Cas is on his side when Dean gets back, sex towel discarded on the floor. Dean hands him the damp towel and climbs up next to Cas, grabbing the lube again. When Cas is done cleaning up, he curls around Dean, sleepily nosing his hair and kissing his temple as Dean rubs his cock. Dean’s hard and wet and actually a little desperate to get off. He sighs out his pleasure as he rubs his cock. When he looks over at Cas, he finds Cas’s whole attention centered on him.
Cas helps him onto the bed again, on his back this time, and lays beside him. He wastes no time, kissing Dean and grabbing the base of the dildo and tugging it until the knot pops out.
He grinds against Dean, wet from Dean’s mouth and his own slick; Dean grunts, rutting up against him.
“Yeah, De-” his orgasm floods through him, hot and sharp, leaving him writhing under Dean. It’s so good it's on the edge of pain, on the edge of breaking him apart. He’s moaning with abandon, not caring a wit that at least half the camp can hear him, Dean’s too good, the pleasure he gives Cas too great.
Cas shudders a little at the thrill of it and kisses Dean again, long and slow and deep until Dean’s making little noises into his mouth.
“Thank you for telling me, Cas,” Mick says quietly, voice solemn. Cas swallows. “You’re Cas. You’re just Cas.”
See the thing is, Dean doesn’t know how to explain himself. He’s in love with Cas, except not really except they exchanged wedding vows and promises of forever except Dean did go out and sleep with a hot bartender last week and Cas knows about that and he doesn’t mind because Cas doesn’t want to fuck Dean and Dean doesn’t want to fuck Cas but he does want to hold him pretty much every night as they fall asleep. How does he explain that to his brother? To Jack?
At least, he can trust that Dean's actions, Dean kicking him out of the bunker and his profound silence afterwards, are an unambiguous rejection. A solid statement that no matter what affection he feels for Cas, he is still disposable to Dean. He might as well be a barn cat, he reflects, useful to kill the mice but not welcome in the house. Now that he's lost his claws he's not welcome at all.
"Steve, look I'm sorry but you will need to leave tomorrow." Marlene tells him once they’re sequestered in her tiny office.
He touches his belly, tries to be grateful for these petty difficult organs for keeping him alive, even when he’s hungry, even when he dreads getting up off the floor in the morning.
"Well, Steve, I've got a few things to do before we can talk but you can sit here. Feel free to watch TV or read any of the books. There are some snacks in the kitchen and I think there might be brownies from yesterday in the fridge. You're welcome to them."
"I dunno man, a few years back I had to help a friend out of an abusive situation. You remind me of him."
“Come for me, Dean,” and what can Dean do but follow his command. He clenches, crying out  as shakes he apart in Cas’s arms. Cas presses the knot firmly into him and Dean shudders, choking at the burn of it all over again, until finally he collapses back into the mattress.
rebuilt it while bringing him back to life. That he’s in Jimmy’s body cannot be an accident, that Jimmy spent such time and money and effort to build this body only to give it to Cas, cannot mean nothing. Becoming human was not intended and Cas aches to be an angel again, but he is also presented with the rare chance to know himself, away from the garrison, away from the orders of the host, away, even, from the Winchesters. He lays back on his side. He tries to be grateful.
“Look, I want to get married. Let’s go to the courthouse tomorrow. You have a fake driver’s license, right? And I do too.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says reverently. Dean smiles at him, too tired to remind him that he doesn’t have to thank Dean for absolutely everything.
"I think so," Cas says, then opens his arm in invitation. Dean settles next to him on the couch. Cas shifts around so he's got his legs flung over Dean's lap and Dean holds onto his ankle, brushing his thumb against the bone there.
“All day, I thought about you in here, fucking other people. When it should be me; you’re mine. Even when you fuck them, you’re mine,” Dean punctuates it with bite to Cas’s shoulder that makes him shudder.
Dean’s body slumped underneath Castiel’s as the two fell back in the chair, boneless and sated in a way neither had ever felt before. It took a few minutes before Dean’s breathing slowed down enough to form coherent sentences, but when it did he grabbed one of the angel’s hands and squeezed. “I think I was in love with you before that barn,” Dean mumbled. “Just didn’t know what the hell it was I was feeling.”
By this time, Dean was an impossible shade of red, and slowly sinking in his chair as if to hide under the table. “This was why I didn’t wanna tell him,” he muttered sulkily.
Dean visibly relaxed. “Oh, good. I really need this money to help pay for my kid brother’s college tuition. Stanford is freaking expensive.” He nodded as if agreeing with himself.
Castiel laughed, and Dean wasn’t sure if it was at him or at the situation in general. “Dean, you may be an expert in lying and fooling people on the job, but your crush on me was never a secret. Sam picked up on it first, of course, and then Bobby. It took me a while to sort out my feelings, since I’ve never felt anything like this before, but I eventually knew as well.”
Dean hastily pushed aside a bunch of boxes, probably breaking some of the contents yet not caring in the slightest. “Room for two,” he suggested, patting the plush carpet next to him before pulling his own tie off in a single, practiced movement. Castiel was on his mouth in seconds, and the next day they had to pay extra cleaning fees, but it had been totally worth it.
“Chocolate, Daddy?” The blonde-haired toddler asked, her face glowing with an innocence that her omega father knew could disappear at any moment if she wasn’t happy. Whoever came up with the term ‘terrible twos’ had greatly underestimated Claire Novak.
“I thought I would be helping, Dean,” Castiel replied, finally angry enough himself to meet Dean’s level of shouting. “I thought I would be saving everybody by locking Heaven. I had no way of knowing that Metatron was double crossing me the whole time.”
"I don't suggest it," Castiel said, trying not to think about growing out surrounded by so many siblings. "I have three other siblings of the non-straight variety, too, so Thanksgiving was insane every year, same with Christmas."
Emma pouted for a few moments, before sulkily admitting, “Fine, most of a forever.” Dean and Castiel couldn’t help chuckling at that.
"You like riding on my cock and you know it," Cas said, right before starting to pump. By now, Dean was able to meet Cas stroke for stroke, and his nails habitually went right for the flesh on Cas' back. When he scratched over the lines from earlier, Cas let out a moan of pleasurepain that managed to get Dean harder and closer to his own release. But before he could utter a single word, Cas' hand was already clamping down tightly at the base of his borderline painful cock. "No," was all that Cas said, but it was enough.
“Is that the pizza man?” They both heard Cas asking from the area just past the stairwell. He sounded like a really bad actor, which only caused Sam to start giggling again. As mortifying as this whole situation was, at least he’d have teasing material for Dean for the next decade, at least. He choked on his next laugh when he looked down at Cas, though.
“I’m going to really miss this place,” Castiel said as he looked at the empty living room, a few stray boxes the only thing left of a life lived happily.
Cas ducked his head, possibly in embarrassment, which made Dean feel at least a little bit better about his current insane reactions. “I’d always wished we could’ve been friends, back in school,” Cas admitted. “You seemed so interesting, like we could’ve gotten along great, but you were kind of intimidating, too.”
“Gabe gave it to us for an engagement present apparently,” Castiel said in an appropriately annoyed tone. Then he turned away from the pineapple boxers to start gathering the necessary dishware for dinner, much of which had been in the same present pile as said boxers.
“Make sure to watch out for Dean, and get him out of there if you need to,” Sam called to them as they were about to head out the bunker door.
He dumped the rest of the mail on the table by the door, not able to focus on boring bills and junk mail until the mystery of the puzzling package was solved. He ripped through the tape and yanked open the box like a kid at Christmas, and was confused when a few scraps of dirty looking cloth fell out, along with a folded sheet of paper. Now he was really intrigued.
“That’s not what I mean, Cas.” Dean sighed. “I… I don’t really know what I mean, actually.” He felt a tear slide down his cheek, and while later he would blame it on the unwanted estrogen running havoc through his system, deep down he knew it was his alone.
He’s silent when his orgasm hits, rigid and desperate and breathless, incapable of anything but breaking apart in Dean’s hands. He’s shaking with it, face pressed into Dean’s bed. Dean keeps fucking him, slow now, prolonging the aching pleasure.
Cas’s face burns and his heart races as he moves into place, conscious of the toy the whole time, the way it must be pressing on the seat of the panties, the way it’s going to feel when Dean finally gets to work. Dean watches him the whole time, helping arrange his limbs and this makes Cas burn too, in a complicated way. He yearns for Dean’s attention all the time, now that he has it, it almost hurts.
They hold the door open for him. He heaves his bag up and walks in. It's dark inside but once he gets around the privacy wall he can see light on in a back room.
He pulls Cas in and lays a chaste kiss on his lips, longer than a peck but more restrained than Dean is used to.
Cas lets the comment go as Dean swipes a thumb over Cas’s nipple and slides a hand down to press against Cas’s dick, over his boxers to Cas’s disappointment. Cas hums, pressing more firmly into Dean.
Cas hurries to comply, resting on his elbows, keeping his hips wide in a way that will be sure to make him ache later. Dean wastes no time mounting him again. Cas cries out at the first thrust, harder and faster than their earlier pace.
Cas gestures him over. When he’s close, Cas takes a deep hit and grabs Dean’s chin. He holds the smoke then pulls Dean close; Dean dutifully opens his mouth, letting Cas exhale the smoke into him, their lips brushing. Dean pulls back just far enough to stare into Cas’s eyes. Cas stares back greedily, admiring all over again how beautiful Dean’s eyes are.
“Yes. Now come here,” he orders, urging Cas up with a hand still on his ass, the other on his own dick.
Sam doesn’t comment, but Dean can feel him watching. Jack doesn’t comment either but he seems to take their increased intimacy as an invitation to touch more too. When Eileen comes to visit it is somehow Jack who gives her the first hug, much to her delight and Sam’s mild dismay.
Dean gets up after a minute. Cas hears him in the bathroom, then Dean’s opening the cabinets in the kitchen. He comes back with an undoubtedly  warm beer. Cas has one leg propped up and Dean gets an eyeful when he gets back in the room. He pauses, taking Cas in.
Another poet comes up, saying, "Hi, I'm Ezra. My pronouns are they/them." Mick calls "Hey, Ez!" They smile.
Cas nods, giving a choked sound of affirmation and Dean keeps going. His arm is probably getting tired, Cas thinks, but it doesn’t really matter as Cas starts to feel good again. There’s a kind of overwhelmed pleasure Cas’s human body is capable of, an advantage when he has so many orgies, but it’s also terribly raw and vulnerable. That’s where Dean is pushing him now. Cas keeps stroking himself with shaking hands, groaning with every breath. This orgasm is different. He feels it in his feet and the legs and spine and chest. Like every string in his body has been cut, it makes him feel a little hysterical, a little like he’s been reborn as liquid pleasure. He being burned up from the inside by Dean, cracked open and made into a simple creature, just a shuddering body, a vessel full of pleasure and for a moment, maybe love. Maybe Dean’s love.
Dean snorts quietly, “No.” He sounds amused. When Cas opens his eyes, he sees Dean kneeling beside him, holding a sweating beer can to his cheek, no doubt trying to cool down. He’s still flushed and sweating from his orgasm.
He can just feel Cas’s length through his boxers, pressing against Dean’s thigh. Why is he still wearing jeans, Dean wonders.
Today, he has been thinking of his body. It had been a slow quiet day at work and when he could no longer focus on the package labels he’s been reading or the magazines or his phone, he had taken to examining his hands. He has a mole on one knuckle he’d never noticed before. There are scars left over from when this was still Jimmy’s body. His nails are ragged. He knew this before, from the way t hey scrape along his skin uncomfortably when he scratches an itch. He
"I started thinking about the men in my life and thinking, what parts of them do I admire. I like the way my dad gardens and is humble. I had a teacher in high school who wore lots of jewelry and I always thought that was cool. I like how gentle my cousin is with children. My neighbor makes food for me and our other roommates when someone is sick. I mean, maybe you don't know that many nonbinary people, but you can still look at the people that I admire in your life, the people you evny and try to emulate that. You're not inventing a new gender, Wren, you're just figuring yourself out."
“Close your eyes,” Dean says gently and Cas let’s his eyes slip closed. He floats as he listens to Dean above him, breathing hard, making tiny choked noises as he jerks off over Cas’s face. Cas can feel his heat and smell Dean’s body. He wants Dean in his mouth, in an idle tired way. A shame he won’t get the chance to tonight. Or tomorrow morning. No doubt Dean won’t stay. Cas pushes those thoughts away and listens as Dean’s breath hitches and he moans quietly, coming on Cas’s face without fanfare.
“Thank you Mick. I enjoy being around also,” he’s surprised to find it’s true. “Can you read that poem from last week? About the mint plants?”
There’s some shuffling and Dean’s watching through slitted eyes now, hoping not to alert either of them that he’s awake, wondering what the fuck is going on.
“Uh, according to this article it’s like a relationship that’s more intense than a friendship but lacks certain romantic or sexual norms? Common with people who are aromantic or asexual.”
He thinks of Dean; he is always thinking of Dean. He has broken through the skin’s thin page, Dean’s skin, touched his heart, seen every bit of him. He still knows where every vein lies, where he remade every freckle, the exact size of Dean’s beating heart. He ran his angelic fingers over all of it, knitting him back into his body. He has never understood the subsequent distance Dean insists on putting between them. Cas wishes, with sudden violence, that he were close enough to break through to Dean, to leave a bruise, to share this heavy aching he feels all the time.
“Take your pants off,” he commands. Dean rushes to comply, cock springing out when he strips off his jeans.
“Thank you,” Cas takes the towel and carefully wipes the semen off his eyelid. “Did you know semen burns when it gets in your eye?”
“No,” Cas gasps then whines as Dean withdraws his fingers entirely to cradle Cas’s throat in his hand. There’s no pressure, just the suggestion of it, fingers pressing into blood vessels just enough for Cas to feel it. Dean’s fingers are wet from Cas and he’s rutting against him slightly now, pressing against his ass. Cas stays very still. He’s not exactly human now, but certainly no angel either. If Dean presses down, Cas’s vision will go spotty and he’ll gasp and burn like any other human. Dean doesn’t press, just holds Cas’s throat like he owns him--yes, yes, Cas wants to be his--and kisses under his jaw.
He throws off his pants, and shirt for good measure, and gets in bed on his belly, back arched invitingly for Dean.
Cas considers. Some might be embarrassed. He’s had lovers who hate anyone helping after. Dean is one of those lovers. He will not accept a gentle hand to help him clean away the mess. But Cas needs Dean to stay, needs those hands soft and gentle now, while he’s still wide open and raw. He’ll take anymore of Dean he can get.
He’s never been this full, never had the occasion to be adventurous about fucking himself before now. But with Cas here, holding him, pushing the dildo further into him every once in a while, stroking his cock he feels full. Full of Cas, surrounded, possessed, safe.
“I can’t move.” Dean’s got an arm braced around his waist, keeping him close and basically immobile.
He sucks Cas through it, making sure to swallow. He holds Cas’s cock on his tongue for as long as he can get away with. When Cas pulls him off by the hair, Dean stares up at him. He must be a wreck, lips slick and swollen, shining with sweat, tears still not dry on his cheeks.
When it finishes its quest, Dean snarls "Fucking things. Thought we got all of them.” He examines the ceiling, the eves.
He slides a hand under Dean’s sleeve, fitting his palm over the scar there. Dean shudders at the contact, cutting off in the middle of a needlessly long explanation of whatever he was doing in the garage before he found Cas standing in the rain.
They smile brightly and wander farther back into the building. It takes a few minutes before Cas dares poke around in the kitchen. There are indeed brownies in the fridge. He finds a knife and dishes himself two slices.
Dean’s hand leaves Cas’s nipple--terrible--to tug his hand away and pin it to the counter--better. “Be patient,” he commands, with a nip to Cas’s ear. Cas presses his ass back against Dean’s groin. He lost the pants somewhere and his dick presses against Cas’s ass through their boxers. When Cas is groaning with frustration Dean finally slips a finger in.
Cas twists to kiss Dean briefly on the lips, then turn on his belly, back arched. Dean’s dick absolutely throbs looking at him, open and ready and beautifully pliant for Dean.
The first brush of fingers against his back makes Cas jump but he settles as Dean rubs a hand up his back, then down again. It’s rough and heavy and warm as it slides down his back to his ass. He slips his hand further down, pressing over Cas’s underwear, and Cas did put them on specifically for Dean, pressing on his dick, making Cas sigh.
“What do you want Dean?” Cas asks. Wrong question. Dean wants everything. He wants to come right now, he wants to hold the knot in him for the next hour, he wants Cas in him, he wants so much he cannot possibly say.
Sam gapes at him for a minute. Cas leaves the room only to return a moment later with an orange. He sits at the table and sets his piercing gaze on Sam.
He doesn’t know what his future self says, if anything, but there’s some shuffling and Cas is kneeling on the floor and his future self is sitting on the edge of the bed and Dean needs to get the fuck out of here right now.
“Fuck,” he hisses. He’s so eager he wants it in him right now, needs to take it, to show Cas he can take it.
he? He’s human now, but he lacks the context to understand what that means. He is in a man’s body, a body that was made to be a man, but does that mean he too is a man?
“Cas, c’mon, I gotta take off my jeans,” he gets out and Cas finally pulls away. He’s like this, clinging to Dean, staying inside after he’s come and gone soft, holding Dean tight and close, watching Dean with something like wonder as he takes off his jeans. He’s a possessive weirdo. This shouldn’t surprise Dean.
“You need to be more careful, Dean. I can no longer heal you.” Castiel has finished taping the gauze in place but he’s still holding onto Dean’s arm, looking up at him from the floor.
"Yeah, we've had problems with them before. I'm sorry about that. I'm Marin by the way, they them pronouns."
Cas's pillow is wet and his heart is racing and feels too big for his chest, like it might fill up his whole chest if he's not careful.
When he’s landed six hits on Cas’s ass, he pauses, rubbing his hand over Cas’s stinging ass. He presses the toy into Cas again and Cas makes a wild needy noise at the stimulation. Dean keeps at it for a minute, just fucking the dildo into Cas ever so slightly, until Cas is thrusting back desperate to get more, more stimulation, more pleasure, at which point Dean lands another hit on his ass and Cas wails, jolting forward and squirming with it, panting with denied pleasure. He’s soaking wet.
“That good?” he asks, looking down at the side of Cas’s face can see, his open mouth, gasping into the pillow.
at him. Cas has been sending out beacons into the dark with all kinds of warnings, trying to get Dean to see he’s scared, he’s in pain, he’s hanging on by a fucking thread, that he needs Dean to look at him. He doesn’t even need Dean to look at him fondly, just to look at all. He’s looking now.
After the pizza box has been thrown in the dumpster out back and the napkins cleared away Diran says, “Ok, Steve.I know a few people who might be willing to hire you. Let me make a few calls.”
After a minute, Cas asks, "Ok?" and future Dean only grunts in response, shifting his hips. Dean finally understands when he sees Cas's arm moving in time with the bobbing of his head. Dean feels like he's on fire. He inhales sharply at the same time his future self groans.
He’s solid and heavy and comforting against Dean. The weight of his hard cock against Dean’s thigh is thrilling.
“Hurts just right,” Dean admits, too turned onvto feel even a little embarrassed with the admission.
“Dean.” His eyes fly open but there’s no one in the room. He tilts his head, looks into Dean’s room, future Dean’s room, where he can see Cas’s broad shoulders in the doorway.
He hands the phone over the table and Cas and Jack lean over it. Dean sits on the other side of Jack but doesn’t bother reading the tiny phone screen. He’ll look it up later.
Cas starts to sag into him after another hour of reading. Dean looks over to find he's blinking sleepily at the book he's got in his lap.
There's a young blond person standing in the doorway. They're chubby with two nose rings and big wire frame glasses.
He slumps back in the aftermath, elbows on the counter, just taking a moment to breathe. His whole body feels pleasantly warm. Dean sucks softly at his dick until Cas is whimpering with overstimulation. Then he eases back, pulling his fingers out and settling back to sit on his heels.
“Turn around,” Dean orders. So Cas turns, leaning on the counter. Dean slips his fingers back in, The angle’s worse and now Cas can’t grind against his palm anymore but Dean makes up for it by kissing down Cas’s chest.
“C’mon Cas, you can’t be serious. You want this? Shitty motel rooms and a bunker with no sunlight and my emotionally unavailable ass. You’re better than this.”
“Look at you,” Cas breathes, when Dean’s on his knees looking up at him. “All those times -- I didn’t know then, that I wanted you. I didn’t know what wanting was, but every time you’re on your knees...” Cas trails off. Instead of continuing, he slips his fingers into Dean’s mouth, pulls his jaw open, pressing down on his tongue. Dean seals his lips around Cas’s fingers and swirls his tongue, giving him a preview.
It’s the most shocking sensation tonight somehow. The wet heat of his come on Cas’s cheek, on his eyelid, dripping messily onto his ear, is a surprise. He feels it in his whole body.
Cas figures out how to fuck him so the knot never quite comes all the way out or goes all the way in. He holds Dean on the knife’s edge of too much, and Dean’s sure he’s going to break apart. He will gladly let Cas break him apart again.
“Oh Dean,” Cas gasps. The angle isn’t as deep but he’s hitting Cas’s g-spot on every thrust. Cas can’t help the little whimpers he makes as Dean thrusts quickly. He’s so sensitive, right on the knife’s edge of another orgasm.
Cas gets a hand between their bodies to rub frantically. He’s losing his pace, twitching. He gasps out “Dean, Dean, I’m--”
Cas doesn’t immediately sink down on Dean, but takes his dick in hand and rubs the head over his hole. He loves this, the moment of anticipation, the heady excitement, heightened by the lingering high, the feel of skin on skin and god, Cas is so hungry for him.
“What’s that?” Jack asks, now seated beside Cas at the table. Dean wanders over to them, putting a hand on Cas’s shoulder.
“C’mer,” Dean says, as he reels Cas in by the hips. Cas’s hands come up to cup his face and Dean rests his forehead there, against Cas’s belly for a moment, enjoying Cas, warm and solid in his hands.
"Look, if you need some help getting a prescription for cheap, I can send you in the right direction."
“On your knees,” he orders, taking a step back. Cas goes easily, knees hitting the dusty floor hard. Dean slips a thumb into Cas’s gasping mouth. Cas closes his lips around the digit and swirls his tongue, giving Dean a little preview. He’s become an expert at sucking dick these last few years, which Dean has reaped the benefits of many a time. Dean shivers as Cas works his finger. He’s expecting the order to open Dean’s pants and get to work, but it doesn’t come. Instead, Dean pulls his finger out and orders, “Stay there.”
His future self falls back onto the bed with a groan. Dean, Dean on the floor by the cabinets, holds perfectly still, aching with want, waiting to see if his future self will get up to follow.
He’s not convinced, he’s still not convinced, even now as he fucks himself on it. It’s big, thick, not too long but the real kicker is the knot at the bottom. He’s not sure he’ll be able to take it, he wasn’t even sure he wanted to try until Cas had already slicked it up, and was running the wet tip over his dick, down to his hole, pressing in just a bit before sliding back up, to grind against his hardening cock. He’d looked at the knot, fat in Cas’s big hands, and his heart had kicked up at the idea of taking it inside himself. It’ll hurt, he’s almost sure of it, and fuck he wants it, the stretch, the way Cas will smile at him and kiss him while Dean is gasping.
Cas grabs the lube, smearing it on himself. He swings a leg over Dean's lap and pumps his dick twice, getting it slick, then wipes his hand on the sheet beside Dean, probably doing it specifically to annoy Dean.
“Good, feels good,” he presses down until he can feel the bulk of the knot at his hole, clenches around the toy.
Cas shuffles down the bed to look at his hole which is no doubt dripping and sloppy. He slips a finger in, making Dean hiss.
Dean risks himself unnecessarily on a hunt again. Dean throws himself in front of Cas to protect him from a hit that wouldn’t even have been that bad. His arm is bleeding, he wrenched his shoulder, and there wasn’t even time to stop and fix the wound in the rush to salt and burn the bones before the ghost could get them. In the aftermath, Cas drives them to the motel in stony silence as Dean presses gauze to the wound, the gauze that Cas insists they keep in the glovebox. He shuffles Dean inside and slams the door and none too kindly orders Dean to take off his shirt.
“Cas, I’m sorry, if I had known,” Dean’s speaking to him through the open bathroom door as Cas carefully shaves in the mirror. It’s been a trial, learning how to shave by himself. It still requires a considerable amount of concentration on his part.
And Cas comes up to hold him. Later there will be a bath, and an order of Indian food delivered to their house, and Cas will help him change the sheets before they fall into bed together to sleep later that night. But right now they tangle their legs together and Cas rubs a hand over his side and Dean kisses Cas’s forehead then his cheek then the hollow of his throat, and says right into Cas’s chest, “Love you.”
Cas whimpers and gets a hand on his dick. He rubs quick and with abandon, chasing his orgasm eagerly. This is one of the best parts of humanity Cas decided long ago, the orgasm, the moment the body breaks into mindless pleasure--pleasure so great it’s almost pain--the moment he is not himself but a bundle of sensation in someone else’s hands.
And Dean, he feels good. Settled. There’s no big disasters coming their way and for once, Cas isn’t itching to run out the door. It’s good.
Dean loses patience, grabbing his arm and hauling him under a nearby pavilion. Cas shakes his hair like a dog once they’re out of the rain. The move makes the world spin a bit but Dean steadies him with a hand on his shoulder.
The meeting goes on. There's laughter and someone gets out a speaker at some point and people get up to dance. It's happy and a little overwhelming. Cas sits back and takes it all in.
The job at the gas-n-sip keeps him afloat, once he finally starts getting money. He hadn’t realized, at first, that it would take time before he got paid. He hadn’t realized that money would be taken off for taxes. He knows so little about the minutiae of daily human life these days.
Cas takes a long shaky inhale. He holds it, willing the tears to stop. He breathes out steadily. He takes his next hit probably too quickly.
He shifts now. He’s wearing only boxers, his hair is wet. He’s tired. Whatever Dean is about to say, Cas doesn’t know that he has the energy to hear.
He had woken this morning hard and had thrust sleepily against Cas’s hip until Cas grumbled at him to knock it off. They had kissed over their coffee that morning before Cas headed out to the office and Dean had manfully resisted slipping a hand under his shirt or drawing him close to give him a hickey. He’d tried to convince Cas to fuck no less than an hour ago, and only gotten an amused look in response. Cas isn’t behind on his reading, he’s meticulous and methodical about his studies in a way Dean will never be. He just won’t.
