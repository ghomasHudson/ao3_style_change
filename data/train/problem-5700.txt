“Please, I’m not him. I’m not with Hydra. I’m here to save you.”
The avengers moved together nearly seamlessly, using the sixth sense they had developed of each other’s fighting styles to maximum effect. The doombots never stood a chance.
Afterwards, they settled back down onto the cot. Tony curled up easily into Steve’s arms, tucking himself into the line of Steve’s side as if they’d been made to fit together. Steve breathed deeply, content. His arm was stretched out under Tony and it was easy to fold Tony into towards, holding him protectively in the circle of his arms.
This Tony was different. He was perfect. The wrinkle and the stress lines had all been wiped away leaving his skin as smooth and untouchable as marble. Even the little laughter lines near his eyes were gone. The man before Steve was an artist’s representation of Tony, all his imperfections forgotten, his handsomeness amplified; his scars, his history lost.
Maria laughed, one hand coming up to stroke his face, her skin soft and warm against his cheeks. Her eyes were dancing, full of energy.
“He’s wrong. I know you’d be an amazing superhero.”
He didn’t understand. Neither Doctor Everette nor his mother had explained what the scratch test was and he jolted like a live wire at the first sharp line that nicked into his back.
Inside the viewing room, Steve felt his heart stop, straining as if it would break into two. He could see the pain, the momentary doubt in Tony’s eyes, the desperate desire to be loved. The Hydra Supreme saw it too, his mouth twitching with victory.
“You haven’t wanted to kiss me all night.”
He reached out for the door to the room where Tony was being kept and stopped, fingers resting on the doorknob. The metal was warm, fading heat from someone else’s hands. Steve pulled away sharply, his heart was beating fast, a rapid rabbit rhythm against his rib cage. He moved to the other door, the viewing room and entered, hand resting on his shield.
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve told him hoarsely, forcing himself to slow down, to drag out one long shuddering kiss. Tony mouth was red, swollen from the rough treatment. Steve wanted to touch it, to drag his thumb over that pouting bottom lip.  “That was the first thought I had when I met you. That you were the most handsome man I ever met.”
Tony snorted and closed his eyes, head leaning back to rest uncaringly against the damp, moss-covered wall. “This is a hallucination, isn’t it?”
Maria spun away from Tony, beaming at the doctor who entered the room. Tony recognised the man’s voice as the doctor who had done the procedure and cringed, focusing on his blanket covered knees rather than the doctor’s face. Tony drifted away, letting his thought unravel as his mother and the doctor exchanged pleasantries. The doctor’s brisk attitude had disappeared, worn down into something mesmerised and fumbling in the face of his mother’s beauty. Tony realised he preferred the nurse; at least her lack of interest was consistent.
before and knew it was bad, he always imagined it was a capital letter word.
“Oh Peter…”
Steve swung his gaze back to Tony, his expression fierce, burning with feeling. “So, you need to keep trying. People need you. I need you.”
“Well, I don’t want to overdo it.”
“Wow, you were hungry,” Tony said. Steve made an agreeing noise, cheeks stuffed with food. Tony laughed fondly and switched on the TV facing them from across the room.
Tony nodded uncertainly, slumping against Steve’s bare chest with a sigh. Steve shivered at the feel of Tony’s face, his facial hair against his exposed skin.
“An A.I.” Tony finished.
“Interception of doombots in approximately four minutes,” JARVIS’ said, his steady voice almost enough to calm the jittery rabbit beat of Tony’s heart. On the overlay screen in Tony’s headset, he could see Steve’s number flashing at him. Tony ignored it.
It was painfully easy to gain entry into the Triskelion. Everything was coded to Steve’s DNA and the scurrying Hydra minions were too afraid to question why the Hydra Supreme was walking around alone. Steve’s heart was beating like a drum in his chest, almost rabbit-like as he marched through the Triskelion atrium. The flying eagle of S.H.I.E.L.D. which had once arched across the marble atrium floor was gone, crudely painted over by the hollow-eyed Hydra Skull. Steve clenched his fists at sight, leather cracking with his anger.
“Tony?” Steve asked gently, “What’s wrong?”
Steve realised as he spoke, he was telling truth. He did need Tony. He wanted Tony. He remembered the days after Tony had recovered his company as some of the best times Steve had had in the Avengers and at least half of that was down to Tony, to sharing the experience with this man. Tony had been a good superhero. He had been a good friend. He had been Steve’s best friend.
Tony followed her arm and stared dumb and confused. This wasn’t a conversation he knew how to navigate and he felt anxiety clawing at him as he became aware that he had done something wrong but was ignorant as to what his mistake had been.
The image of the screen changed; Tony’s face replaced by the Triskelion. It loomed against the sky, blocking the sun. Seared into the pale walls like a brand was the dark symbol of Hydra. Steve’s jaw clenched in anger at the sight of it. Hydra had taken Shield’s most secure base, because of him.
“Shit.”
Steve sniffs and takes James into his lap while Harley and Sarah crawl into Tony’s.
“No,” Steve says with a shake of his head and reaches for his glass again, taking a bigger drink until his wine is almost gone. “I get where you’re coming from, but we have to work together on this. He needs us both.”
“I’m just trying to figure this out. I have no idea what I’m doing.” Steve frowns.
“Mr. Alexander Pierce accompanied you home.”
“And if I need you for anything?”
“So?”
Steve nods and takes another drink.
“No,” Natasha says and everyone turns toward her. “It’s mine. I knew something was wrong and I...I guess I didn’t want to believe that he would do this. It’s not like Steve to-he wouldn’t do this.”
“True.”
“I won’t but I need to train with Auntie Nat.”
“Uh...okay?”
Steve chuckles. “I think you need to share, Petey.”
“Like it or not Steve left us in charge,” Sam says, his tone shifting into one Tony’s heard the other team members use with him.
“Oh...um no.I got it.”
“Mama, he’s mean to me.” Harley whines and runs straight into Steve’s stomach.
Steve rolls his eyes.
“Almost there,” Steve grins and he rubs his hand over Tony's large belly, hoping the touch would coax their son to kick. It was late and they both should be asleep by now, but he couldn’t go to sleep without talking to their son first. It was irritating to Tony. He was always accusing Steve of waking Peter up. “Hi, Petey,” Steve coos, trailing his hand over the bump until it’s resting over the spot where their son is.
“Hold on, sweetheart. Let me deal with your brother first.”
Sam waves a hand dismissively. “Man, don’t worry about it. I know how moving is. And with four pups. Yikes. I can’t imagine that.”
Nat smiles. “No. SHIELD agent.”
“Sounds hard.”
“I’m sure your time at Stark Industries was more important. Maybe you should just stay there instead,” Steve says coolly, and he yanks himself free from Tony’s grasp.
Tony turns toward his mate, ready to tell him about the family vacation he’s planning, only to rethink the idea when he senses the change in Steve’s scent. The omega is staring out the SUVs window, mindlessly playing with the messy hair atop James’ head. The little pup yawns and his eyes fall shut.
Steve lets out a huff and glances down at his watch. Ten minutes. That’s what Tony said was all the time he needed to get ready. And that was twenty minutes ago.
“Go be with him. He’s probably confused and scared. I can take Morgan for the night and give you a chance to properly talk with him. He means a lot to me and everyone else, too. We want him to be okay.”
“You’re trying to make me feel guilty, aren’t you?”
“That would’ve been stupid,” Tony says, his voice rough. He squeezes Steve’s hand again and shifts, grunting when he tries to sit up. “I’m fine,” he waves Steve off.
“I guess I’m worrying for nothing,” Steve continues their previous conversation. “The baby’s healthy.”
Steve frowns. “Until then? You think we’ll need to hide that long?”
And it hurts like hell when Peter shows he doesn’t need him. The ignored calls, messages and voicemails stings. This was karma.
Peter takes a deep breath to calm himself and once he deems himself presentable, he leaves the bathroom. He makes the mistake of glancing down, and that’s when he collides with another body. Shit. It’s probably Flash.
Doctor. Patterson smiles and pulls Steve in for a hug. “Good luck, Steve. You’re going to be fine.”
Sam glances at Nick. “You heard the kid.”
“Fuck! Come on, Steve, harder. Fuck me harder!”

There was only one way to find out.
“We’re gonna go see Auntie Pepper okay?” Tony tells her as he dresses her for the day.
The alpha sighs heavily. “He wasn’t always the bad guy. Or at least not to me. Sometimes we don’t know people as well as we thought we did.”
“You want to do what?” Nick eventually asks, his tone dripping with irritation. This conversation mirrors the one Steve had with him fifteen years ago. Steve reminds himself how that conversation ended, and he’s hopeful this one would be the same.
A plan begins to form. Tony has to stop himself, hating the idea that his brain conjures up. He’s had a lot of terrible ideas, but none were as dark and twisted as the one he has now.
“Just a few days,” Tony reminds as if Steve had forgotten. “I love you and I’ll call you as soon as I can.”
“Sorry!” Tony panics. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean-”
“Hey!” Tony cries out for his coffee. “I wasn’t done.”
“Sir,” Tony calls out to get the clerk’s attention. “I don’t know this man.”
Steve nods again.
The tears stream down his face and he uses the sleeve of his shirt to wipe them away before he’s noticed, but he’s not quick enough, and he glances up when a hand rests over his shoulder.
“I know.”
“‘M fine,” Tony tries to assure.
He trails a hand over his stomach, grimacing at the softness he finds. His firm abs were gone.
Steve gasps when long fingers explore his most intimate place. He’s ashamed to find himself growing aroused and wet with slick. His body was betraying him.
“Does he listen to anyone?” Pepper teases.
Tony pulls out slowly and leans back on his haunches, panting heavily. Steve had grown still, no longer trying to break free from the cuffs. His head is hanging down, blond hair matted to his forehead.
“Oh. I mean, if you don’t mind…”
“Hey, kiddo!” Tony greets cheerily. He doesn’t ruffle his son’s hair, knowing it’ll probably make Peter irritable. He can’t remember when the mood swings start but he doesn’t want to take any chances.
“One cup won’t hurt right? And it’s not like you’re nursing right now. Unless you want to visit him today?”
There was no point in hoping for Tony to show up. Sam was right: Tony hadn’t showed up the first time Steve called him and he wasn’t going to do it now. They were on their own.
Tony cringes to himself when Steve leaves first and heads up the stairs. A part of him wants to call after the omega and beg him to stay. But he lets Steve go.
“Midtown High,” Peter replies. He’s still playing with his fingers.
“What about this?” Tony asks, swiping to the next slide on his tablet. He tilts the screen for Pepper to see, showing off the bedroom designs he’s been secretly working on. Ever since he talked with Peter about the idea of having him move into the tower, Tony couldn’t help but get to work on designing a room for his son.
“I don’t want to touch it ever!” Peter exclaims angrily and more hot tears run down his face. “This is his home too. Why do we have to mess it up?”
Tony mentally scolds himself. Of course this would be hard for Steve. Nursing Morgan was his thing; it was an important job that only he could perform. It was more intimate. It was their bonding time.
Tony rolls his eyes and makes a gesture for Happy to shut up. He opens the door for Steve and helps him get out. Steve is still hesitant.
“Who was he?” Steve asks. He doesn’t expect an answer, not when he wasn’t allowed any knowledge about the alphas that are brought in. This alpha had been different and since that night, it was all Steve could think about.
“Yeah, yeah. She’s...fine.”
Tony comes closer, taking cautious steps to avoid upsetting the omega even more. Steve grants him permission to come close and he reaches out for Steve’s hand.
“Steve, listen. It’s okay. I’m going to keep you safe. I promised.”
Tony smiles. “Good answer.”
Steve rolls over until he’s hovering over Tony again and kisses him. “You have no idea.”
Steve sighs again.
Steve chokes back a sob.
Tony nods and turns to leave, only to stop when Peter calls out to him again.
I got this chapter done and I’m so happy!
“What serum?” Bruce questions. “Is he taking something? Tony, what are you talking about?”
Steve peers up at him, offering a small smile. “Fine. Tired mostly.”
“Who’s she?” Tony gestures with his chin in the direction of the stranger.
“Is important to him!”
“Yeah. Well, I lost both so…maybe not that much in common.”
“And then he just took off the ring, like it meant absolutely nothing.” Tony huffs and leans back in the chair. Pepper is sitting quietly at her desk across from him, a concerned frown etched on her face. She hadn’t said much when Tony first began to tell the story, deciding to let him ramble before adding her perspective.
Peter gets out and Tony follows after him. They come to a door Tony knows all too well and he has to find the strength to go through it.
Eventually the penthouse becomes too small, and it’s Tony’s idea to move his family somewhere with open space and privacy. Retiring from the team was bound to happen sooner or later, and it was the birth of their son that gave Steve and Tony that final push.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice comes through the other side of the door, followed by a knock. “Tony, open the door. Jarvis told me.”
“And...you are too, right?”
“You want to cuddle?” Tony chuckles.
That eases Tony’s fears just a bit and he pulls Steve into a tender kiss.
Steve only groans in response. He can’t hold off and he pushes again, whining through gritted teeth when a burning sensation builds between his legs.
I’ll update soon! ❤️
“You didn’t mean it.”
“M-mine,” is all Steve says before falling limp.
Tony ignores the annoyed look on her face when she steps into the lab. He can’t remember if he had a meeting today or new interns to meet. Even if he did, he didn’t care. None of it mattered.
Tony hesitates to answer at first. He didn’t consider himself the famous hero anymore. He and Iron Man used to be the same, but that was the past now. Heroes didn’t run when things got too rough. Heroes defended until the very end. Just like Steve had. Steve was the real hero.
His thoughts drift to Flash and how he was supposed to break the news to him. He’d have to somehow get him alone and beg him not to tell anyone. That part should be easy enough. Flash didn’t want people to know that they slept together anyway.
Peter shook his head. He didn’t have the words to explain. There was just a horrible, awful, desperate feeling in his chest that hurt really bad.
“Oh, this position seems familiar, doesn’t it?” Tony grinned darkly as if hearing Steve’s thoughts. “I can see why you liked it.”
Clint’s cooed with laughter at them, appearing at the other end of the room. He was shrugging into his combat gear, stumbling his way towards them.
The Steve on screen was wearing black. The suit was tight and protective like his Captain America outfit, like his commander outfit. But the star motif was gone. It was all gone.
Hurt flashed across Tony’s face. He sent a stiff smile in Steve’s direction and Steve grimaced, realising he had mis-stepped.
There was a pause as F.R.I.D.A.Y. considered how to respond. Steve almost smiled. “You at might as well tell where he is, otherwise I’m going to start tearing this place apart.”
Tony was stood behind him, wide-eyed and clutching takeout in white-knuckled fingers. He dropped the food onto the bed and stepped forward, his hands urgent, seeking as he reached out towards Steve’s injury. Steve grabbed his wrists gently before he could make contact. “I’m fine.”
“Why haven’t you sent people in after him?” Steve asked, his voice sharp. If Hydra had had Tony for three days, they should have been going after him, rescuing him before something bad happened.
Steve struggled for a moment, his silence making Tony look at him curiously. Steve saw another version of the man imposed over this one, a Tony with a beaten face, snarling in defiance as he lay defeated. Telling Steve to ‘finish it.’  Steve swallowed, “I hurt a friend, nearly killed him.”
“But-”
“Oh, I’m sure you didn’t mean –“
Without the abrupt, sickening shock of pain, Tony was able to follow the worming tube more clearly; he imagined he could trace its clumsy path as it curled through his intestines. The sharpest pain seemed to happen when the tube was forced to bend, scraping his insides as it contorted. And there was always the discomforted feeling of being too full, of having the tube bulging through his insides, pulling him apart. His gut clenched, spasming in protest and Tony, feeling strangely disconnected from his body, wondered why they were doing this to him, why his mother had wanted them to do this to him.
Steve sighed and frowned at the boy. The child was watching him intently from under his dark curls, his eyes wary. He was, Steve realised guilty, afraid of him. Steve made himself relax, forcing a smile onto his face. Despite his reputation as a family-friendly superhero, Steve had never been great with children. Tony had always been the charmer, a chameleon adapting to his audience. Children loved him, taken in by his childishness, his energy. In comparison, Steve had a habit of making children uncomfortable. They seemed to see the artifice in Steve, to sense that he felt stiff, awkward despite his trained camera smile. Relax, Steve told himself, his internal voice sounding distinctly like Tony.
Steve’s gaze sharpened, finally taking in the boy’s full appearance. Tony was wearing an ill-fitting t-shirt and shorts; his bare feet were red and sore looking, raw from walking without shoes across the rough, hot ground. His face was pale, exhausted and hungry looking and there was a bruise starting to form in thin strips of purple across his jaw. As if someone had grabbed his face and shaken him, hard. His wrists and ankles were similarly marked, red and welted. Steve knew marks like that, they were the result of being tied up tight for too long. Anger unfurled inside Steve’s chest. The tiny, child version of Tony had been tied up. His shoes taken off him so he couldn’t run easily. Violence used to scare him into submissive compliance. Steve couldn’t stand bullies and abusers. Especially not child abusers.
“Tony, extremis is dangerous! You of all people should know that!” Steve could feel himself getting agitated. Tony’s unfeeling response kindled the anger burning inside him. He could feel his fingers twitching and repressed the urge to reach out and shake the other man. Didn’t Tony remember the hallucinations, the overloading of information, the mind control! Did he not care. “Why! Why would you sell it? What were you thinking?!’
Tony wasn’t sure how long it lasted; he thought it took a long time maybe but once he started breathing in the gas, time went unstable.
"Figuring what out?"
He sees it in Tony’s smile when Tony glances up at him, eyes sparkling and mischievous. He smiles at Steve like he’s found everything in life he’s been looking for, like he loves him, and Steve can see that nothing could ever compare, not for Tony. He doesn’t hesitate to dive into his projects, and he doesn’t hesitate to love Steve as best he can either.
It feels a little like the moment time slowed down as Tony’s breathing hitched underneath him, shattered glass between them and blood staining Steve’s hands.
It’s silly to think about now, seventy years into the future and free from the plague of his childhood asthma, but his sleepy brain clings on to it. When he falls back asleep, his fingers are tangled with Tony’s over the warm reactor.

they kiss, and it’s stardust and starlight, it is dawnbreak and a million explosions. it is heaven and hell, and tony can’t think of anything better.
She didn't live long enough to see Tony Stark carry a nuke through a hole in space, or to see him be pronounced dead only to make a triumphant return, but I know if she had, she would have smiled and shook her head, almost as proud of his accomplishments as mine.
“Hi,” Harley says, nodding his head in my direction. He turns to Rogers and raises his eyebrows in excitement, his eyes going wide. “I’m gonna be down in the lab, yeah? Tony says he’s got some new stuff for me to look at?”

In return, she shot me one of the saddest smiles I'd ever seen her have. Her next words were chosen carefully, slowly. I'll never forget them.
“It’ll be okay,” Tony reassures, even though he doesn’t know that, even though he doesn’t know anything.
“Heading to bed?” Tony asks, as nonchalantly as possible.
I hear her voice, sometimes, and it's especially clear now, as Steve Rogers guides me to a different car, and opens the door for me before getting in the driver's seat.
He wants to gather up every piece of Tony Stark he can get, but he can’t, because he doesn’t deserve it, he loves him, and he’s such a fucking coward. He wants Tony Stark to ruin him, just so he can see the man he’s always loved finally find some peace after all these years.
It doesn’t have the appeal for him it does most people.
“Sorry,” Steve grits out, eyes shuffling away. “Didn’t mean for you to see that.”
what Steve Rogers fell for. His eyes are bright and soft, his smile is sweet and caring.
Tony has to swallow hard when Steve says his name. He still says it in exactly the same way, but it’s softer, somehow, these days. Less angry. More...something. Tony doesn’t know what, but he catches the looks Steve gives him, sometimes. He looks at Tony like he’s constantly on the verge of apologizing, but doesn’t know how.
“No,” Tony says, “I don’t.”

Written on April 9, 2019.
He’s been a fool for Steve Rogers ever since he fell from the sky with the thought of blue eyes and wide, hopeless grins in his mind.
Tony laughs, and Rogers grins. “No,” he says, “I don’t think so. What about you, Tony?”
sad, to watch Steve struggling for air while leaned against a couch cushion.
This time, Steve takes a sip.
Tony tilts his head at him and nods. “Yeah,” he says, voice low, and Steve wonders if Tony even remembers. They’d danced and laughed and walked their way around the city, hiding under street lamps and alleyways when people would walk by. It’d been wonderfully fun, having Tony draped against him, his skin so warm, his laugh lighting up the sky.

A month later, as I watch Tony Stark, exchange “I do’s” with Steve Rogers, I’m absolutely certain that my mother was right. Love is a blessing, and I have no doubt, that going into the future, their marriage, this union, will be nothing but a blessing.
Rogers and Stark are an obvious example of my mother's words. Rogers does his best to answer every question, despite his qualms. He leans forward, he smiles, he contemplates before answering, and every word is earnest and genuine. Stark, on the other hand, is all glib smiles and jokes, evading my questions with effortless ease. By the time I've realized he hasn't answered a single question, it's been forty minutes and he's managed to cover an array of subjects, from his fellow avengers to the ludicrousy of the wage gap.
"Eccentric," I finish, and Rogers nods, looking sheepish and grateful.
He sighs and shakes his head a little, although the corners of his lips tug up in a ghost of a smile. “We do fight,” he says slowly, “But not as much as we used to. Tony takes less risks, and I try to be less of a ‘stubborn asshole,’ as he likes to say.”
To reassure him, I shake my head. “There’s nothing sweeter to see than people in love,” I say, tipping my own glass towards Stark.
He wants to burn the letter and obliterate the phone, but that wouldn’t help, he’s smart enough to know that. So instead, he memorizes every word, and he slips the phone into his pocket.
“What?” Steve asks, eyes confused in the faint glow of the backup lights.
(See the end of the chapter for
a choice, not for Steve. He doesn’t hesitate to run headfirst into a fight, and he doesn’t hesitate to love Tony in entirety either.
“Maybe,” Steve replies, words soft, not as steady as they used to be. Tony sits there, fiddling with his tablet, trying to pretend that he isn’t watching Steve out of the corner of his eye. Steve sits there, shifting against the cushions, as if he’s trying to get comfortable. Now that Tony’s thinking about it, he doesn’t think he’s seen Steve actually sleep in his room since he got back. Every single day, when Tony would head to bed, or at least, pretend to, Steve would be on the couch, a grimace etched into his face.
I mention this to Captain Rogers, who smiles fondly as he looks down, rubbing his wedding ring.
He wants to run to him, to let the consequences be damned, to leave the safety of Wakanda and tell Tony how he feels. But it’s hopeless. So instead he helps what’s left of the Avengers, he hopes Tony calls.
“Jesse,” he says, gesturing to the boy, “This is Harley Keener.”
But as most of the room stiffens, Rogers relaxes. His shoulders slump, his eyes soften, his hands steady, and he looks up at Stark with clear adoration and respect in his eyes. It feels almost intimate, to watch them just look at each other.
it’s not that steve doesn’t love tony in all the small ways too, the quiet “good mornings” and soft smiles, but being with him always feels like the whole world at his fingertips.
Steve nods, and looks down at his feet again. He’s wearing sweatpants and a soft T-shirt, and he looks downright...terrified. Scared. Lost. Confused.
And with that, she sent me off to take out the garbage and wash my hands before dinner. My mother never did stop holding out hope for Tony Stark, even as she lie on her deathbed. We both watched his news conference from her hospital room, Stark’s arm in a sling, cheeseburger in hand, as he bared his soul to the world.
The Hydra Supreme made the next move, advancing hard on Steve. Steve was panting, the wound in his side aching, sapping his energy as he struggled to ward off the lightning-fast blows coming from the electric baton. The baton went left and Steve twisted, catching it with his shield. The movement sent a hot twist of pain through him and he was slow, unsteady as he tried to re-centre himself.
“I don’t think I could do it again. Last time nearly destroyed me.” Tony was saying, his voice distant with memories.
Tony paused; his eyes narrowed as he assessed Steve. A shark smile flashed across his features, so brief Steve thought he had imagined it. “You know, I cried myself sick after you died. Sat next to your body and begged for you to come back. I don’t think I took the suit off for months, couldn’t bear to face myself. I blamed myself for everything. Not that I remember it of course. I wonder if bullet wound in your corpse wasn’t quite normal then too. Maybe I was too busy beating myself up to notice.”
“You took the serum because you were a sad, little nobody who would have done anything to be more than what you were.” Tony sneered, “Just like the rest of them.”
“I know you hate crumbs in the sheets but you look like you could do with dinner in bed,” Tony said a plate held out in offering before him. Steve’s stomach made a sudden loud growl, ignored hunger making itself know. Tony laughed at the sound. “I brought extra. I know how much you can eat.”
“Yeah maybe…” Tony mumbled, wincing as he remembered his reaction to that photography. He had forgotten that had even happened, still couldn’t quite remember why he’d been in the hospital or when the picture had been taken. When he tried to remember, he felt like he wanted to vomit or like he wanted to hide, to run and never stop. His memories scratched at the back of his mind, a monster hiding out of sight in a child’s closet.
Tony stiffened, and the stern nurse frowned in warning at him. “Remember the position.” She told him.
Something else occurred to Steve, a sickening thought that made him close his eyes. “No.”
Across the room, Steve made a little noise of surprise. The sound was a gunshot in the silent room and Tony jumped, turning to look at him quickly.
That day, Maria had been having one of her bad days. Howard was meant to be on business and Tony had been so hungry. It felt like he was always hungry nowadays, and it was only when Tony’s mind was occupied did the cramping, biting hunger pangs seem to disappear. It hadn’t seemed like a huge risk at the time.
There was a pause. If Steve had been talking to a person, he would have recognised the delay as indicative that he was starting to annoy them.
Tony was laid out across the bed, barely breathing. He was so still it took a moment for Steve to even notice him. Without the healing pod, he looked pale and thin as if his fat and muscles had been eaten off him slowly. His wrists and ankles were narrower than Steve had ever seen, bird-like against the sheets. The sight of Tony, lying so vulnerable made something clench, stutter in Steve's chest. He needed to get him out of here now. Before the Hydra Supreme got to him
It didn’t matter though, there were plenty of other paediatricians who were happy to answer the call from the Stark household. Each new doctor brought his mother excitement. She was a child at Christmas, too full of energy to stand still as she told Tony fervidly that “This is the one. This one would help us.”
“Look what you’ve done.” She snapped, arm gesturing to the door. “He’s left now!”
Tony’s laugh snapped like a whip between them. His mouth curled into a sneer. “Yeah, I don’t think so. Nice try though.” He made to walk away; a hand raised towards Steve dismissively as if he could brush him away.
“Suit yourself.”
Tony laughed, “Terrifying.”
Tony swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing, drawing Steve’s attention to the long vulnerable lines of his neck. “I didn’t know that.”
“Hey, hey, what’s up? Peter you look like you’re about to cry?”
“Get up,” Steve repeated loudly. His voice had finally stirred the occupants of the bed and the young couple sleepily roused, mumbling confusedly into Tony’s pillow. From the bed, there came a dark, muffled chuckle and then Tony was twisting, moving easily to sit upright in the bed, his arms around the naked occupants of the bed. It was a show, a demonstration. Except Steve didn’t understand what it meant.
“No,” I say, rushing to explain, “He does it in the
When he was 7 years old, Howard had ripped his nightlight out from its socket, claiming that he was too old “to be babied” and that it was stupid and frivolous. He’d shaken a finger at Tony and said that if Tony fixed it, there would be “consequences.”
“I wouldn’t take you to be cat people,” I say, as they watch their cat settling herself in my lap.
Tony Stark loves like he builds. The sky is the limit, with him, and the more Steve pays attention the deeper he falls in love.
Rogers nods and smiles as Harley bounds away, his feet flying down the stairs to what I presume is Stark’s workshop.
Tony shrugs, but a smirk finds its way onto his features. “Lots of people rub their rings.”
He sees it in Steve’s eyes when Steve glances up at him, a soft, tender smile on his face. He looks at Tony like he’s precious, like he can’t take his eyes off him, like he loves him, and Tony can see that this was
It feels like waiting for an execution.
, like they’re dancing on the grave of their memories, but also, it’s the only thing Tony knows how to do, so he supposes it has to be the slightest bit right too.
Tony is in the kitchen, slumped over a tablet, when Steve first starts gasping. It reminds Tony of the way he gasps for air when he has nightmares, low and slow and desperate. It’s sad,
It’s fascinating to just watch them exist, the sheer trust they have in each other. There’s no doubt in my mind, watching them as Tony walks into the house, immediately seeking Steve’s embrace, that they would do anything and everything for each other.
Then, he snaps out of it and claps his hands together, smiling. “Well,” he says, shrugging, “Guess that’s what happens when you’ve been with the guy for 10 years.”
before raising an eyebrow and smirking. “No,” he says, leaning against Rogers, “Not unless you go all Terminator on me.”
Their cat nudges against my legs, and I’m reminded that I only have a few more moments with the couple until I’ve got a plane to catch.
“Nice kid,” I comment, and Steve smiles, his eyes fond.
Written on March 7, 2019.
Tony is his home.
Tony’s not sure if it’s his place, but after a few seconds, he gets up from his chair and crosses over to Steve. Tony hesitates for a moment before reaching out and settling a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
it’s not that tony doesn’t love steve in all the big ways, all the big messy, “here i am, love me?” kind of ways, but loving him is fantastically, beautifully simple.
“Steve,” he says, softly, “Steve. Wake up. You’re alright.”
Tony blinks, hard, and swallows down what might be tears. He knows what that feels like.
“Dumped with her, more like,” Steve murmurs below his breath, and Stark’s grin grows wider.
Tony meets his gaze. It’s watery and sad, but there’s still a spark there, that determined glint that Tony loves.
And this, this is why Steve’s an idiot. Because he’s been in love with Tony Stark since he can remember, because Tony is smart and kind and beautifully broken, and Steve wants every piece of him.
it’s beautifully fearless, and steve adores it.
He doesn’t hesitate to say
“He seems sweet,” I offer. Tony smiles, wide, all teeth, before it turns softer, kinder, and in that moment, I understand
"Yeah," he says, considering it, "yeah, that's one word for him." He smiles then, and I might expect shame or some lingering embarrassment, but instead of both, I find wonder in his tone. It's sweet to see, especially with their stark differences.
“Steve,” I say. “He rubs at his ring too.”
“It’ll be okay,” Steve repeats, staring down into the depths of his cup.
I nod. It’s not strange, to think of Tony Stark taking young bright minds under his wing. It’s almost sweet, to imagine the scene without me in it, to picture Tony Stark and Steve Rogers joking with Harley, a achingly domestic scene. And while Rogers said that they aren’t looking into adoption at the moment, it’s easy to imagine Tony Stark beaming like a proud parent at Harley’s graduation, or to picture him holding a child in his arms.
“You remember it?” Tony asks, his voice casual even as he avoids looking at Steve.
“You’re okay,” Tony reassures, pressing down a little with his hand. The words seem to have some sort of effect, and Steve heaves in a deep breath.
Steve wishes he never sent that letter, or that stupid phone. He couldn’t get the words out so he shouldn’t have tried to force it anyway. He couldn’t find the perfect way to say “I’m so sorry,” so he went halfway and fucked up.
And I find myself believing him. Not because the few minutes I spent with Harley Keener were particularly enlightening, but because Tony Stark has the inexplicable capability of making words seem powerful, of making the future seem almost tangible. Stark’s a futurist, after all, and when he points his finger at me and proclaims that the young teenager I met yesterday is going places, I believe him instinctually.
Tony pulls out two teabags and drops one into a cup full of hot water and drags the string back and forth a little. He remembers doing this before, before Ultron, before Siberia, before...everything. It’s strange, doing things that they used to before the end of the world. It feels
It feels a little like a vibranium shield to the chest, a little like ice, seeping into his bones, a little like the clang of Steve’s shield as it hit the cold, concrete floor.
When I mention Harley to Stark, he laughs, throwing his head back, a loud clear sound.
And this, this is why Steve’s an idiot. Because he’s been in love with Tony Stark since he can remember, because Tony is smart and kind and beautifully broken, and Steve wants every piece of him.
Steve looks up at him, and shakes his head. “That’s not...I didn’t mean it like that, Tony.”
“-What my darling fiance is trying to say, of course, is that we were kindly gifted with her.”
Tony’s eyebrows furrow, and his lips turn downwards. “Hey,” he says, “Not an issue. It’s been a while, I know, but even I remember that you’re human.”
The scene is so normal, so effortlessly simple, and yet it stirs an emotion in my chest I can’t quite describe. Here are two of the most powerful men in the world, Captain America, a man who punched Hitler, who sacrificed his life for thousands, a living legend, and Tony Stark, the invincible genius, sitting together, drinking wine and talking to me.
, it whispers, and he can’t even be bothered to deny it.
He misses people too.
sometimes love is this small ebbing flow that washes over in waves, but to be frank? loving tony is the exact opposite. it’s not a slow realisation, or pining, it’s not quiet soulmates and slow smiles. it’s fast and overwhelming and everything steve wants in every way.
His thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. It was Natasha. Steve looked up with a sigh muttering a quiet 'come in'. Nat walked in with a frown on her face. Sure she didn't always agree with Tony and how he had been acting but that didn't mean she had wanted any of this to happen. She never thought that this could be what Tony's retirement lead to.
Tony took a step back and shook his head. "But I'm not joking." He tried to make his tone and expression as serious as he possibly could. "I talked to Fury the other day and he's already helping me decide who'll take lead once I'm gone." There it was again that shocked, confused, and worried expression on the faces of his teammates.
call. If I really thought we couldn't handle it I wouldn't have had us go." he scoffed turning back to his work trying not to let himself shrink under the intense gaze of the bio soldier.
He would miss it all. He liked his work. He loved the team and working with them in the field. But both Steve and Natasha were right. He wasn't fit to lead. He was selfish and reckless just like they had said.
"Fury said that he'd try and send men in to get Tony. But without knowing just what exactly Tony was working with we can't go in." He winced. Without thinking he had clenched his fits again nails digging into the wound that was already there. "Falcon, Hawkeye, Hulk you're with me we're going to head over to the facility do an assessment of what we're dealing with and go in."
He had made it home to his new penthouse. It was dark and quiet. The silence was loud as he made his way to his room. No stupid remarks from Clint. No wise quotes from the capsicle. No stupid banter about who's stronger from Thor and Hulk. Tony felt his eyes begin to sting and there it was, the tears.
This had never happened before. He always handled the press well. It had never been an issue in the past. But now? All he wanted to do was get away from the waves of flashing lights and be in the comfort of his home. Thank god Steve came to the rescue ushering the press away giving Tony an opening to sneak away to his car taking off without a word.
Steve was gonna be sick. The last conversations he had with Tony. . the last things he ever told Tony. He had called Tony selfish, he had told him he tarnished the Stark name. He reached into his drawer quickly tending to his palms. When done he let out a shaky sigh letting his head fall into his hands. This wasn't happening. There's now way this was happening not now.
." he began to raise his voice as he threw his hands up in defeat. "If this is what the Avengers is about I want no part in whatever the hell you're trying to accomplish." Steve paused for a moment. "You know I was wrong about you. You're nothing like you're father."  Tony paused as Steve continued. "You tarnish your father's legacy. Your father. He wanted to do everything he could for the benefit of the people. But you? You're just a selfish, billionaire prick Tony."
A week had passed and Tony was almost done packing up his belongings. Members of the team would stop by and stare from time to time as he worked. Some of them seemed to be worried about his departure but none dared to speak up. They all seemed to know that Tony had made up his mind and that he was likely too stubborn to change it.
He let out a huff as he taped up the last box of his belongings. This was it, his last few days in the tower. He sighed walking down the hall thinking of the memories that were created in the tower. The stupid things said over team bonding night and all the days he spent going over what needed to be repaired after each battle.
"I'm no hero Steve. I don't belong on the battle field atleast not like this you said it yourself. I'm an inventor I belong in a lab." his breath hitched as he pat Steve on the shoulder. "Well congratulations Captain and best of luck. Know that you'll always have Stark Industries to back you up if it be financially or new tech."
seemed to mess up the good things he was given in life. But this was the one thing he could save before it was damaged beyond repair.
Tony stayed silent letting the words sink in as he stared at the screen in front of him. "Unbelievable Anthony. Still nothing to say? Screw you I'm done with you and all your reckless decisions. I quit." Tony flinched as the Avengers ID card hit the desk. Steve scoffed before turning and walking out the door. Tony sat there for a moment before turning to see the card sitting at the edge of the desk. He took a deep breath knowing some of what Steve had said was just purely out of anger. But the longer he let those words replay in his head the more he realized just how much he had messed up.
"That would be true. Friend Tony was a wreck after you left." The asgardian spoke up. Steve stilled and now Natasha was more upset than before. She didn't think it was fair to blame Tony's choice to leave on them.
Steve should've been happy with the praise. Tony rarely praised someone so highly. But there was this odd feeling in his chest that made this upsetting in some way that he didn't appreciate.
"Look I just know you'll definitely do a better job than I had." He placed a hand on Steve's shoulder. "You were the crazy super soldier that my father would praise. The expectations that I could never meet. You're Captain America and now I'm just Tony Stark again." he smiled but Steve could see the sadness behind it all.
"Yes sir. Contacting the avengers now." Within minutes each member had piled into the living room one by one. Tony smiled as he waited for everyone.
During a mission Clint ends up with a broken arm and Sam may have a concussion all which happened after the orders Tony had given in his sleep deprived state. Natasha never agreed with the reckless calls that Tony made and she confronts him about it as he's pouring a drink. It all leads to him accidentally revealing his plans of retirement. They always wanted Tony to step down because of his reckless choices but now that he was they were judging him harshly for that too.
He balled his fists at his sides trying to ground himself. He suddenly felt nervous that he was to be scolded again. In another attempt to avoid eye contact he turned to the cabinet to grab more glasses. he couldn't face them as he spoke. "Don't worry. This will still be Avengers tower and I'll be moving out as soon as possible." he paused turning back to grab the liquor. "If you're worried about money don't worry about that either. Stark industries will continue to fund the avengers." Before he could continue Barton cut him off.
"What makes you think that I'd even want to take this position?" He questioned. Tony shook his head. He knew Steve would be glad to be able to return to his team without Tony being there. Being able to lead was just a bonus.
'Hello Avengers. I'm FRIDAY." They looked at each other and for a moment their silence caused Tony to grow worried. But soon they turned and smiled at him. He had let go of the breath he didn't even realize he was holding.
(See the end of the chapter for
Today was the day that they would be going over who was taking over Tony's position. Fury had thought it would be best they met on S.H.I.E.L.D. territory. So they were meeting on the tricarrier. He was already late but he couldn't stop the anxiety bubbling up. Hence why he had stopped to take shots before going to the meeting in an attempt to calm his nerves.
Tony shot him a soft smile and nodded. "Fine. Now what can I do for you Cap?" Tony pushed passed him and walked over to the sink to wash his face. Steve opened his mouth to speak but didn't say anything until Tony had turned to face him.
Steve turned to face them. "Now that's enough we don't need to be fighting amongst each other." He was getting irritated now. "It won't be good if we have a situation in the field and our own team is arguing with each other." Clint shot Steve a glare.
"Nick. Tony is still in there. According to Pete he had canceled their usual meetup in order to visit the facility. He hasn't made it our yet Fury." He explained trying not to sound as desperate as he did but he failed. Even though the two weren't on the best of terms at the moment Tony was still his friend. "Can we send any one in?"
"You'll be fine without me. You got Sam here and he's as smart and maybe even smarter than me. Plus you also have Bruce, Peter, and Scott some of the smartest people I know."  Tony began to pour the glasses. "Besides if you really need me Fury can patch you through to me." Everyone stood there surprised. Tony never really praised anyone so highly before it seemed unnatural.
"You put your own agenda before the team
Steve nodded not that the man could see. "I. . I understand. Thank you sir." But he didn't understand. Fire, chemicals? When had that ever stopped them before. Something was adding up. He unclenched his palms as he began to feel the sting of blood being drawn. His nails had dug into his palm and he was bleeding.
Tony sighed and downed another shot. "Mm you see that's where you're wrong Nat. This is me taking responsibility." Tony started. "You said it yourself I'm not fit to lead. I'm not in the right place mentally or emotionally to be calling the shots in the field." He slammed the glass down. "It's better for me to step down now before I end up leading you all to your death." First they wanted him to step down. Now they were judging him him for stepping down. He couldn't catch a break could he.
They were all silent for a moment. Honestly most of the team hadn't exactly thought to stop and think about how Tony was really feeling with the whole façade he had going. They hadn't stop to think about his mental health.
Well that's the uh end of the chapter. Can we guess who's coming in to lead the avengers it's not that surprising I'll be honest. But yeah Tony has revealed to the team that he's retiring Iron Man. Tony in his feels and such :D
He found an empty bed and he sat there and cried. He had lost the people he had grown to consider his family. The only real family Tony had in years. Gone in the blink of an eye.
This was it. The final steps before he was back to being just Tony Stark. He would spend the last day cleaning up around the tower. Upgrading any tech to ensure that he wouldn't need to come back and upgrade any more tech.
He wanted to ask the other if he was alright the exhaustion clear on Tony's face. But he felt he wasn't in any position to be friendly with Tony. After their fight and the radio silence between the two of them. Hell Steve was convinced he was one of the factors that pushed Tony towards that decision.
'Steve I know you wouldn't mind returning to the team. Especially since I'll be gone. You're a good leader and I know you'll do well. Tony smiled before he stood up from his seat. he was starting to feel nervous causing him to get nauseated. "Now that this is out of the way if you'll excuse me."
:"Yes I can see that Captain Rogers. All the staff seemed to have made it out alright so what seems to be the issue." Of course Fury had that I know best, I don't really care so get on with it. When did Fury ever really care. Steve stood their for a moment not saying a word hands clenched into fists at his side. "Captain?"
Steve had that unreadable expression on his face again. "Look, you were right Steve, I'm not fit to lead. I'm not the right guy so here's your chance to say I told you so." He spoke quietly and Steve could hear the exhaustion in the other man's voice. "I don't want anymore people to die because of me."
it’s the “i want to spend everyday with you, not because i can’t live without you, but because you make me happy,” kind of love. it’s the “you steal the sheets and you mumble to yourself but that still makes me happy” kind of love. it’s the “there are a million reasons why we shouldn’t work and a million more why we should, and yet, i love you regardless,” kind of love. it’s simple.
"I still don't understand why they-" Steve Rogers shoots me a nervous look, that all American purity showing through. "why they want to know
Find it
Find it
We talk for a few moments, nothing important, and yet it’s striking, just to watch them interact. Rogers takes an interest in the wine Stark’s holding, and Tony holds the glass up to his lips, tipping it back. Rogers accepts the routine with ease, and after he pulls away, Stark gently swipes at his bottom lip, wiping any wine that’s spilled.
The future is noisy and disjointed but his team is a steady constant. He gets caught in the crossfire of Clint and Thor’s extravagant prank wars, Natasha’s smile hidden behind her hand as Bruce watches curiously with muffled giggles for science. It’s Tony that finally gives him a home. Vibrant, flamboyant, and beautiful Tony, with his magnetic gaze that draws all the Avengers together under one roof.
Rogers follows him to the car, and before Stark steps into the sleek, elegant black car, he presses a kiss to Rogers lips and grabs his ass for good measure. Then, the billionaire slips into the car and off it goes, an engineering marvel, remotely driven.
Steve waited, running his hands through his hair in frustration.
Tony looked down into his coffee cup; it was still nearly full. The once steaming liquid had cooled to something tepid in his hands. His strained, bruised eyes stared back at him from the surface of the coffee, haunted-looking. “Bad dreams.” He told his reflection with a grimace.
In the centre of the bed was Tony. He was lying face down, his body serpentine and golden as it twisted across the dark sheets. His back was naked, exposed to the room and Steve tried not to think about why he could recognise Tony just from the deep line that cut down the centre of his bare back. Tony wasn’t alone. His face was pressed into the naked breasts of a slender woman and there was a man, tall and blonde curled on his other side. One of the man’s muscular arms was thrown possessively across Tony’s back, fingers moving lazily against Tony’s skin in his sleep.
“You’re a good man too.” Steve protested. The memory of child-Tony saying that he couldn’t be a superhero, that his father had told him he wasn’t good like Captain America was still painfully fresh. Tony had always struggled with self-doubt, a strange contradiction of over-confidence and a crippling lack of self-worth. Somehow Steve had never connected the dots, never thought about who had instilled a sense of worthlessness into Tony so strong that it had become something organic, a fixture of the man’s personality. T
Peter thought maybe he was still crying because Papa had hit him. Amy said her mom had cried a lot, maybe that’s what would happen to his Daddy now. He’d just keep crying.
“Jesus Christ, Tony!” Steve ran a hand through his hair in disbelief. “What happened to you? This isn’t you! You used to care about people, you used to want to help people!”
“One of you grabbed him by the face and hurt him. Which one of you did it.”
“Are you not hungry?” Jarvis asked insistently, breaking his polite, demure demeanour. He was frowning and Tony could feel himself getting agitated, shifting in his seat as he tried to guess what the right thing to say was.
“What? Did you miss the bit where he is Hydra?”
Every jump seemed to weaken the nanobots just a little more, break down his body that tiny bit further. He was bleeding again, a small, sluggish amount but even that would kill him eventually. He didn’t know how much more of this he could take. Steve pressed down hard, applying pressure to the wound. He glanced around, a memory lingering at the dusty edges of his mind; of Tony waiting for, bathed in light. Steve shook his, trying to clear as if he was shaking off dust. It wasn’t he place to be thinking about strange, fever induced dreams, he needed to figure out where he was. Even more urgently he needed to stop the bleeding of his strange bullet wound.
There was something about the way F.R.I.D.A.Y. had announced the intruder. Neither the A.I. nor Tony had seemed that concerned. If anything, Tony had seemed… excited.
Even the anger they inspired in each other had been a clue Steve was too blind to see. A lot of superheroes had been for the SHRA but none of them had enraged Steve in quite the same way as Tony. Steve had told himself it was because Tony was his best friend. That Tony should have known better and Steve was so angry because Tony had betrayed him. But Sharon had betrayed him, shot him on those courthouse steps and Steve had barely given her two thoughts. Tony had always been different.
Steve smiled back at him and then glanced down, realising for the first time since he got here that he was still in pyjamas and slippers. He coughed awkwardly, toes wiggling against the cold floor. “There might be a few things I need first.”
Tony nodded, gladdened that she understood he hadn’t meant to be naughty.
“Yeah, I’m sorry about that,” Tony interrupted. “I’m just tired. Don’t know what came over me.”
Steve nodded, it sounded like a very Tony thing to do. “OK, so where is the stasis pod now?”
He pressed the glass to Tony’s mouth, “drink.” He ordered.
Steve sighed in frustration, “Where are my clothes? The clothes I arrived wearing.”
“Everyone?”
Tony’s lips twitched, teeth flashing. “I have only one recipient for the serum in mind.”
Steve winced, “I got into a little trouble. Trusted the wrong person. But I’m here now.”
At least the kidnappers hadn’t been able to get hold of child-Tony. The thought of the kid made him smile. With Steve’s recent experiences with SHRA, with red-eyed Tony, it had been easy to forget the aspects of Tony that made Steve like him in the first place, the bits of him that had made him a hero. Child Tony had been a rough diamond, his goodness and intelligence and wit shining through in precious breath-taking glimpses. He wondered if Tony remembered the stranger that had helped him all those years ago. Did time travel even work like that?
The mismatch of TV and computer screens stacked up in the corner of the room suddenly sparked to life, static filling the room.  Steve turned towards the noise. His eyes tracked the screens quickly, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. Diagnostics ran across the bottom, heart rate, oxygen intake, brain activity. The rest of the screens were taken up by a close camera video feed of Tony’s sleeping face. Steve felt something in his chest relax, unwind and he released a long, shaking breath. He went to the screens, pressing his fingers to Tony’s pale face. The man’s eyes were moving, a brief flicker beneath his eyelids.
“Oh,” Tony didn’t know how to respond, he felt off-kilter, surprised by Steve’s mention of his father and his words dried up as he tried to realign himself within the conversation. Tony looked back at the coffee cup, almost able to see his mother’s delicate hand curled around it, pushing it towards him, urging him to drink up to settle his stomach. He wondered what Steve would think if he told him that his mother used to give him coffee when he was four years old.
Steve scowled, “They’re saying you sold extremis, that most of the city is using it.”
“We going to find him,” Steve said.
“Well, you’re turning out to be a huge disappointment. It seems only fair I do too.” Tony jeered darkly, raising his glass.
“Jesus.” Steve hissed. Like his bedfellows, Tony was completely naked, shameless as he stood bare in front of Steve. His eyes slanted off to the side of the room, his cheeks burning. “Put some clothes on!”
Like a predatory sensing weakness, Tony stalked forward, dropping down on top of Steve. He landed heavily in Steve’s lap, legs bracketed Steve’s thighs and his hands pressing hard into each of Steve’s shoulders. Steve stared up at him, trapped and broken. He had a memory of another fight between them. But in that fight it had been Tony who had ended up on his back, staring up at Steve, unable to move.
Steve tilted his head, his expression pitying. “I do love you.” His thumb came to rest of Tony’s bottom lip, pressing and dragging it down. Blood welled up around his digit and he smeared it across Tony’s mouth, leaving it vividly red in contrast to Tony’s pale face. “The other stuff was a lie but we were real. It’s still real. We can still be together.”
Tony was silent for a moment, there was something in his face, a theory not quite articulated. He bit his lip, the expression strange considering he was made out of pixel.  “Now that I’ve stopped trying to bring you here, you won’t jump as fast and it should stop hurting as much,”
“I never told you?”
Tony made an unhappy noise but her fingers dug in tighter and her eyes were hard, annoyed as she stared down at him. Tony licked his lips, they were cracking and he was thirsty. There had been no breakfast, no drinks today. He let his head fall back against her chest, and after a moment the slow movement of her rocking chair started up again and his mother’s voice lilted back into a soft, soothing lullaby.
Steve rubbed a hand over his mouth disbelieving, trying to control his reactive anger.
This wasn’t Tony. This wasn’t even a person.
For a minute, Steve didn’t understand what he was seeing. Tony was blue. Pale, electric blue. Steve stepped back, moving into a defensive position automatically. Tony started to shimmer, flickering like a light bulb and then the suit was empty and Tony was standing next to Steve, boxy pixels shimmering, smoothing into something fluid and human. Tony stretched out his arms awkwardly; He was translucent. Steve could see the workshop through him.
Steve smiles and comes over to take Peter into his arms. Tony doesn’t mean to do it, but it’s difficult not to stare. There was something about seeing Steve after one of his runs. Maybe it was because it was one of the few times Tony's able to witness Steve laid back and relaxed. Running has always been a way for Steve to clear his mind, forget all his worries. Or maybe it was because of the tight shirt Steve always had to wear, or the look of his flushed, sweaty appearance. Whatever the reason, Tony liked it.
“Your Papa isn’t gonna be happy that we’re waking him up,” Tony sighs. Morgan continues to voice her hunger, leaving Tony no choice but to wake Steve up. “He’ll understand. You’re the one asking for food, not me.”
“Steve? Hon, what’s wrong?”
“Oh.” Natasha frowns. “You have time to work things out with him. Don’t worry about that yet. Does anyone else know or just me?”
Dodger barks again, this time tugging on the sleeve of Tony’s shirt and pulling him forward. Tony immediately knows he needs to follow him and he rises to his feet. He catches movement from the entryway of his lab and he glances up, eyes locking with pain-filled blue ones.
“It’s fine. I like it.”
“Yeah.”
Bruce nods in agreement. “I hate to say it but...I don’t think it ever will be.”
“It’s bad, huh?” Steve winces again from the pain; it’s beginning to burn.
“So are you. He was your friend too.”
“Hey,” Tony says softly, the sound of his voice capturing the omega’s attention. Steve lifts his head, a small gasp escaping him.
Steve sits with his younger pups on the floor, holding Sarah up by her hands to help steady her on her little legs. He’s almost certain she should’ve taken her first steps by now, but given the life she’s had, she was probably behind on a lot of milestones. She’s barely said a word since he’s met her.
Tony doesn’t hesitate. “Yes.”
“Look at him.” Tony smiles. “He’s so beautiful. A lot of hair, too.”
“After the mission. We can’t keep doing this.”
“Here.” Steve holds out the bottle. “Take them. They don’t work anyway.”
Natasha rolls her eyes. “How come you and Steve-”
“I’m changing,” he grumbles and turns to go back upstairs, only to stop when Tony calls out to him.
“I don’t doubt you for a second.”
“Yeah.” Bruce nods again and leans back in his seat with a tired sigh. “To tell you the truth it gets a little tiring. That’s not me saying I don’t like helping you because I do,” he adds quickly.
Peter does as he’s told and climbs into the passenger seat. He doesn’t even get a chance to buckle his seatbelt before the car takes off and speeds away.
The family of six leave and Steve is relieved to find Happy waiting outside for them. He sends a look Tony’s way and chuckles.
“Of course, sir.”
“I know. It is,” Tony says, bouncing Peter in his arms. “And this little guy is gonna walk down the aisle, huh? Yes you are.”
“She won’t,” Tony says and Steve glances up at him, smiling softly. “She’s going to miss you and probably wonder where you are, but like you said, this will be good.”
Tony shrugs off his suit jacket and approaches his mate. Steve senses him then and glances up, smiling tiredly.
“Me, too. But I’ll be here when you need me okay? And don’t feel guilty about this. Enjoy the peace and quiet.”
The scent is intoxicating, waking up the alpha inside of him, luring Tony in to claim the omega. To fuck. To breed.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut. He can’t listen.
He gives up on the walking, deciding he’d rather lie down again. Bucky helps him back to the bed and adjusts the pillows for him, making sure Steve is comfortable.
The first thing he does is rush down to the lab to tell Tony the good news. He tries the code he remembers Tony giving him, only for his access to be denied. He figures he mixed up some of the digits and enters the code again, this time a little slower. He was excited.
Peter’s face grows hot and he sinks into the leather seat. A part of him is still annoyed with his dad for telling Happy about his pregnancy, but the other half is relieved. He was hiding a huge secret, one only a small handful of people knew about. Even his uncles and aunt didn’t know. If anyone else deserved to know about the baby then it would be Happy. He was loyal and someone Peter could trust.
“Then don’t hold back. I trust you. I know what kind of alpha you are, Tony. You’re one of the good ones.”
Tony joins Steve on the bed, leaning over to rest his head on his shoulder so that he can get a glimpse of their sleeping son.
“Good. I had to clean him up because there was an incident after lunch.”
Or maybe his dad would come back and his family wouldn’t be so broken anymore.
Peter doesn’t rush to Stark Tower after the meeting with his uncles. He wishes he didn’t have to bail on his aunt, but he needed to see his dad and tell him the good news.
James shakes his head.
“I don’t believe you.” Steve narrows his eyes, then he lets out a sigh of defeat. “Fine.”
Steve scoffs and shakes his head. One hand falls to his belly, and a frown appears over his face. “Not really.”
Tony wraps an arm around Steve and pulls him closer, leaning down to kiss the top of his head. “Goodnight, sweetheart.”
“Not yet. You’ll be the first to know.”
He’s taken into another room, this one a complete contrast from the one he was removed from. It’s clean, the walls blinding white and the air sterile. Tony inhales deeply, glad to be breathing anything other than alpha stink. The tiled floor is cold against his bare feet, but the rest of the room is engulfed in a comfortable heat.
“Then why do I feel like there’s something you’re not telling me?”
“Yeah? Everyone is so cool with their powers and...do you think I’m good enough?
“I just haven’t slept good in days and all I want to do is sleep and take a damn shower.”
“Relax, kiddo,” Tony waves Peter off. “We just haven’t used that thing in a while. Maybe we should,” Tony says those last words to his husband, who nods in response.
“Of course, sir. I have a suggestion for Mr. Rogers.”
But then Harley was born and Morgan lost the chance of having a little sister. It was fine though. Harley was cute and didn’t scream and fuss like most babies Morgan had been around. He wasn’t so bad.
“She’s a daddy’s girl, huh?” Steve jokes and crawls onto the bed to join them. Tony smiles and gives a small shrug in response. “I knew it. The boy’s love you too.”
Both boys are dressed and at the table by the time Tony makes it downstairs. He greets both of them with kisses and tousles their hair. Both Harley and Peter giggle.
Sam whips around to face Clint. “You know what, you’re the one who started it. Everything had been going smoothly until you ran your mouth.”
Peter shrugs in response. “I don’t know. I know I should be angry but...I don’t know. You’re my dad and I love you.”
“You’re being so good to me. I mean, we broke up and…”
California was growing on him. The weather was comfortable and the days were always sunny. This time of year New York was cool, but it was still Steve’s home. He had envisioned meeting an alpha there and raising their large family. He missed Brooklyn.
Poor Steve. Tony better hurry home! Ugh this chapter was hard for me and I'm sorry if it was hard for anyone else. Hang on to that eventual happy ending tag, folks! It's there for a reason!
“Good. We can work on it later if you want. I know you have school in-” Tony pauses to glance down at his watch. He frowns. “-three hours. Why are you up?”
“That’s harsh, Tony.”
Natalie opens the door all the way revealing two men. They don’t look like police. One of them is dressed in black tactical gear with a bow and arrow strapped behind his back. The other man is older, his hair thinning in some places. He’s dressed in a black suit.
It’s near his bedtime when a knock on a door interrupts, and Peter yanks his earbuds out of his ears and grants permission to the person on the other side of the door to enter.
“We’re agents of SHIELD and here to take you home.”
The nesting phase was just around the corner. Steve knew what to expect when the urge came, and he was grateful that this time would be different compared to the others. For one he had a safe place to build his nest, and he had a mate to share it with.
“Come on, Steve. Push!” Tony encourages, excitement growing in his voice when the baby’s shoulders emerge next.
“I don’t know. You said you loved him but...nevermind. Just forget it okay?”
“Papa, can you stay? Please?” Peter begs, showing off his tear filled eyes.
“How was school?” Bucky asks. He’s still playing with his new friend. Peter’s just happy to see him distracted and smiling again.
“Happy birthday, Pete.”
The project becomes the last thing on Tony’s uneasy mind. Any focus and motivation he had for it has now vanished and doesn’t appear like it’s coming back. With a huff he leans back in his chair and pushes himself away from the workbench. He peers up at the large screen of the live feed from cameras, hoping he doesn’t find Steve suffering from another nightmare again. He doesn’t; Steve is still fast asleep.
Happy makes sure he’s close behind.
Steve groans and does as he’s told, dropping his chin down to his chest and pushing as hard as he can. A burning sensation flares between his legs, emitting a scream from Steve’s throat. He pushes harder, unable to fight his body’s urges. He listens to Tony and the soft words he tells him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter rolls his eyes and gets up from his seat so that he can squeeze through and take over the project. “I’ll take over from here. I can probably make a better suit than you.”
Steve grows nervous when Jarvis starts. He’s not used to the new technology of the world, and Tony’s tech was different from what was already out there. But he trusts the alpha.
“What?”
“We have to tell him. He already knows something’s wrong.”
“The man I met downstairs. He’s your-he’s the alpha that hurt you, isn’t he?”
“I am a little hungry.”
Even JARVIS sighs. “He’s getting more decorations, Captain. Apparently, he needed to...up the scare factor.”
They still had a long and bumpy road ahead of them. The healing wasn’t over yet, and whatever awaited them, no matter how difficult the struggle may be, they’d overcome it. Together.
“It hurts so bad,” Steve sobs, “I wanted this baby. What did I do wrong?”
“Late. Come on,” Tony urges.
“You never should’ve done it in the first place.”
Even Steve can’t help but tense. He knows Tony won’t react badly, but he’s been in this same situation. He had made the same mistake.
Tony sighs again and rests his head against the door. “Pete, I’m sorry. I’m sorry you had to find out. We didn’t know how else to tell you. Can you let me in please?”
“You didn’t. It’s okay. You’re busy.” Morgan does her best to keep any hurt from her tone.
Steve steeled himself, jaw twitching in defiance. “Then why don’t you crush me.”
“As far as everyone else is aware Tony is in a coma, safe and hidden at one of his properties. But three days ago, one of the alarms on the pod went off. Steve found him. He’s trying to wake Tony up.”
Tony smiled, a small, weary thing that flitted across his face. “I can’t tell you how much I have wanted to hear you say that.”
Steve conceded to Tony’s demands without another word, troubled by his thoughts. He strapped the band to his wrist, swallowing as it clicked into place, a blue like flickering on. Static electricity raced across his limbs, a cold finger running up his spine. Like tiles being tipped over, the blue of the suit was swallowed by a wave of black. The Hydra symbol sat proudly, sickeningly, on his chest.
The last time Steve had seen Tony, the man had looked awful. Steve had never seen the Tony look so old, so broken before. His face had been all bones, eyes sunken and surrounded by dark purple circles.  His skin had been papery, lines pressed deep around his eyes, his mouth; his forehead locked in knots of tension. Tony had been a man on the edge, moments away from breaking.
Tony smiled weakly; he was glowing, shining with a faint, watery blue light. “Go, you need to save Tony.”
“You’ve heard him say that?” Steve asked finally, his voice hoarse.
Steve stepped forward, desperate to know. “You said it wasn’t what I was thinking. Then show me, Tony. Take me to him so he can explain.”
“No! Yes! Sort of.”
“Oh.” Tony seemed slightly confused but accepting. “You know that I don’t mind if we-“
Steve looked away, frowning, “Are we? Are we friends here?”
The worry that it might happen again kept him awake at night, he lay rigid in his bed, straining to hear any bad noises, but he never heard anything. Peter wondered how long it would be before Daddy left Papa. He wondered who he would have to live with.
“Fight me?” Tony asked, an amused frown flitting across his face. “You think this was a fight?”
He smiled weakly up at Steve, ‘I’m fine. I’ll be right behind you. Go kick in some Hydra heads.’
“I’m really smart too!” Tony said excitedly, “Who is he?”
Tony’s shoulder inched up defensively, “I can walk.”
Tony found himself staring at his mother’s delicate hand, fingers itching as he remembered the silky, slippery fabric of her gloves. The gloves, his mother had explained completed her ‘look’. Tony wasn’t exactly sure what that meant but he had figured it was mostly about other people looking at his mother. A lot of people looked at his mother, and they all said that she was a beautiful, kind, flawless woman. And yet, Tony found himself thinking of the cigarette burns and the hidden blisters under her gloves. The sores that she popped and picked until they swelled, red and angry.
Tony could still feel the phantom touch of her hand on his shoulder squeezing hard, her fingernails biting into his skin in warning. He shivered and shook his head, stomach churning.
Most things seemed normal anyway.
Steve turned to face his enemy, unhooking his shield slowly.
“Things got bad, Steve. Really, really bad.”
Tony’s smiled. For a moment his expression flickered – blink-and-you-miss- it-quick; his soft smile replaced by something hungry and cold. A predator’s grin.
Steve shrugged, smiling. “He was pretty cool.”
“We had some victories.” Tony said, “Take it. It’s yours.”
“I’ve got you,” Steve said, his voice warm and safe and sounding far away.
He took the food from Tony without complaint; halfway through the burger before Tony had even settled on the bed next to him. If he hadn’t of been so engrossed in his food, he would have noticed that was Tony was settling in gently next to him, shoulder to shoulder.
“Trust me, as much I like the idea of playing with you. I’m not making this up. Think about it, Steve, you appeared out of thin air in the middle of a park in San Francisco. You have a wound you can’t heal from. You’re in a different city. Look at me, I’m not the same Tony you left behind right.”
To the right was a small en-suite. Steve rummaged through the bathroom mirror, smiling as he found a familiar first aid kit. He gingerly pulled his uniform off his shoulders, leaving the bodysuit half hanging off his hips. The nanobots were all but gone, a few remained twitched across the bullet wound, working hard to drag the torn skin together. Steve knew without them he would have been dead a long time ago but the sight of them still made his skin crawl with unease. The rest of the wound was a gaping red hole, swollen and infected looking. Spiderwebbing out from the wound were dark angular lines, poison running through his system. Steve stared down at his torso, his jaw clenched. He just didn’t understand why he wasn’t healing. Even a base-level human would have clotted.
