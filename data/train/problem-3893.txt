Sam chuckled. “No problem.”
“Goodnight, Dean,” the angel spoke softly.
“You did say the theme was pie and Zeppelin.”
Castiel’s stiffened in his seat, smile disappeared. “Dean, the anomaly.”
ean was cruising down the empty road- if you could call going 90 mph ‘cruising’. The classic rock tune of ‘Carry on My Wayward Son’ was blasting through Baby’s speakers which seemed somehow more amplified than Dean remembered.
“Anyway, we should get a move on if we want to reach that nest by daybreak.”
“And find Claire.” Jody said. Alex replied with an “on it” and left the room.
“Dean, last I saw you I opened my heart to you in the most… bare and vulnerable way a person can…to a man I know could never reciprocate those feelings.”
“Dean!” Castiel belted.
“Really?” Dean’s eyebrow raised in quiet indignation. “That’s what I get for saving the world. My own best friend doesn’t even know anything about my favorite band.”
Dean and Castiel follow the trail and stumble upon a case.
Dean softly said, “I’ve been waiting to do that.”
They shared a knowing smile, and Sam’s heart ached. Dean really would have loved this. “No chick flick moments, my ass”.
Castiel was clearly over his jealousy from Dean’s earlier interaction with the librarian. After the third round of pink squirrels, Castiel, was subconsciously bouncing his leg along to the rhythm of the music, a pleased smile replacing his earlier frown, blue eyes crinkled in the corners. Dean could not help the warmth that spread through him.
The stores looked like old-fashioned mom and pop shops- advertisements for cola with an old-fashioned logo. A gas station across the street had a sign- “31 cents/gallon.” Signs were all over storefront windows for the most recent fashion trends, foods, liquor, cigarettes- you name it.
“The date is February 10, 1958.”
!” He quoted. Castiel squinted and cocked his head, looking confused. “Never mind”.
“A long, lonely time…. And time goes by so slowly…”
Two deputies were speaking to a thin woman with a beehive hairstyle, Dean assumed, getting a statement. A little boy was pressed against her leg, both to hide his face and muffle his sobs. Her hand was absentmindedly patting the boy’s shoulder. Dean quickly surmised that she must have been the significant other to the deceased.
“Yup,” Jody said next to Sam. “Word got out fast. A lot of people have just been comin’ in and out. There were even these two dorky guys- couldn’t have been hunters. Called themselves… Ghostbusters? No, that’s not it.  Well, whatever it was. They stopped by too.”
“Oh, yes.” She moved to leave. “If you need anything, I will be at the front desk.” She made a small hum sound as if she just finished a scrumptious piece of pie, and then quickly left the room.
Okay, well, now Dean was getting extremely anxious for this “unspoken thing” to finally be spoken. “It’s cool, buddy. Er, Cas, whatever it is, you can tell me.” He gave Castiel his undivided attention.
Thunder rumbled from somewhere out in the distance causing the two hunters to look up. Another storm was on the horizon. They still had time.
“So, what? You take it back?” Fear trickled through his voice.
“I’ll just take this pie in the kitchen. Sam, there are so many pies by the way.”
“I can still track it. We must find it before it’s gone, Dean. Because if we can’t, if it
“We already checked your car, man. We know you’re not playin’ backseat bingo in there,” called out asshat #2.
“Dean.” The song cut out to a low gravelly voice, only to go cut back to the song. Dean’s breath hitched.
Cas doesn’t move, doesn’t respond, and when Dean’s brain catches up with him and he pulls back in panic, Cas is looking at him with confusion, and with even more hurt. Shit.
Cas is the one who gets up to wet the washcloth in the sink and clean them both up. Dean feels a little like a dick about just laying there and doing nothing, but whatever the fuck endorphins flooded his system from Cas’ finger magic have wiped his mind blissfully blank so he doesn’t feel too guilty. And when Cas nudges him onto his side and pushes up behind him, throws an arm around him and kisses his neck, he grabs Cas’ hand and laces their fingers together and doesn’t even pretend that he doesn’t want this.
The sheriff put a hand on the back of Dean’s neck and ran the tip of his dick along Dean’s half opened lips. “Very much,” the sheriff said, and pressed in.
“Well, most of the sex was very boring to watch,” Cas tells him in a reassuring tone. He pauses then, and asks, “Are you cooking something? What are you making?”
Dean glares at him one more time for good measure and then jerks his head to the bench by the wall where he sometimes lays his tools out. Cas ambles over but Dean takes his time reattaching the cables he’d disconnected and closing Baby’s hood. He wipes his hands on the greasy rag as best as he can and tosses it into the box he keeps by the door and finally walks over to the bench to sit down heavily beside Cas. Cas watches him the whole time.
“Take your pants off,” Cas says against his lips. “And give me the holy oil.”
“Look, Sam,” Dean says, clearing his throat. He has to just do it, rip the bandaid off. “Cas is…” He falters there because Cas is what? His...boyfriend? His completely tactless life partner? He and Cas haven’t even talked about this yet.
= 1. An infinite plane divided by one line consists of two regions. Substituting 1 into the formula gives
a stripe up the crease, pulling a high-pitched sound out of Dean that he’s never heard himself make before. Cas’ tongue is so soft and wet against his hole, licking and circling the over-sensitive skin there, making Dean bury his whimpers into his elbow.
Dean ducks his head to hide his smile. "Could have crossed my mind, yeah," he allows.
Dean takes Castiel and Sam one day to see the ocean.
“Look, I’m gay, okay?” Dean says, as fast as he can. Then he stops and makes a face. “Kind of.”
Cas keeps one hand braced against the cabinet, and the other curved around Dean’s jaw, his thumb brushing along Dean’s cheekbone, soft and sweet. Dean knows Cas can feel his jaw working against his palm as he sucks his dick and the thought makes him hot; he can feel a flush rising on his own chest. He pulls off once to take a breath and say, because he can't help himself, “You know what would make this perfect? If you were in a priest getup right now.”
t started with a rumble and a growl from somewhere high above the clouds. Billowing white cumulus turned into dark nimbostratus clouds that hung low and angry. The rain followed a few days after and decided to prolong their visit.
The Peppermint Club was surprisingly packed for a Monday night in 1958 middle America. The large oval hall was adorned with red and white spiral lights that hung from high ceilings. A wooden dance floor occupied the center of the room, encircled by intimate round tables covered in long white table-clothes. Musicians were playing on a small stage in the back of the room. A man in a wool jacket belted out some tunes while being backed by a group of three women in fancy blue dresses and fancy hairdos.
“Stars shining bright above you…”
Dean and Castiel gathered their supplies and headed back to deposit them in the trunk of the Bel-air. Everything was in its place, yet Dean still had that niggling feeling. His hand on the top of the open trunk to steady himself, he plowed on.
you find me, anyway? If I was lost? And, please, feel free to dumb it down for me.”
Castiel stood to close the bedroom door, his hand hovered over the knob.
“Stars shining bright above me…”
She hesitated. “It’s crazy. I’m sure I imagined it. I saw a figure…in the corner of the room. A man, an older man in a-a a sailor’s uniform. He looked so pale. He said something. He said ‘this is my house. I will not allow my house to be defiled’. He shouted it. He was so angry I could almost feel it,” she whispered.
Dean practically jumped out of the car before Castiel could respond to his pathetic attempt at a flirtation. “Play it cool, Winchester,” he mumbled to himself.
Dean reemerged a short time later with a completely different outfit. The gray pleated pants were replaced by dark cuffed jeans, black boots, and a white undershirt. A leather jacket completed the outfit, making Dean look like a badass Greaser.
Dean gulped down his drink and ordered another round. He caught the glaring eyes of a group of men, squared shouldered and beefy, from across the bar. They looked ready for a fight, and him and Cas were their targets. Dean tried to ignore it.
An uncomfortable silence settled between the two. Of all that they have talked about since meeting at the hospital, there was still so much left unsaid. It was what wasn’t said that made Dean feel that nervous itch, that niggling fear, in his stomach. He tried subtly glancing at Castiel while he was looking away. Dean had the sudden urge to stop the man and hug him like their lives depended on it. Castiel must have felt the heat of Dean’s gaze and turned his head towards the taller man. Dean quickly turned away.
Which is why the oldest Winchester was walking up and down the halls of the bunker at 3 in the morning with a beer in hand. Post-case adrenaline was coursing through his restless body. And some other feeling he was not quite ready to give a name to that had everything to do with a certain angel. He quietly padded around the corner, passed Sam’s room-the sound of snoring softly escaping through the door. After being plagued for years with nightmares and terrifying memories of yellow-eyed demons, it was comforting to know that Sam was finally allowed some sort of vengeance and closure, even if it was not the same yellow eyes.
“Oh, my darling…. I’ve hungered for your touch…”
Dean swallowed. “Okay.” The angel turned toward the passenger side door. “Cas.”
“Oh yes,” she said adjusting the rim of her glasses. “This town is so rich in history dating as far back as 1728. Many of the buildings here are considered landmark sites often visited and lived in by the founding fathers themselves. Is there any particular landmark you were interested in?” She smiled coquettishly.
ean was surprised by the obvious use of a Star Wars reference. Sometimes it was easy to forget that Metatron imbued Castiel with a vast knowledge of pop culture some time ago. “Did you just quote Luke Skywalker at me?”
“On it!” Dean quickly scrambled up, pulling the match box out of his own pocket.
The drive to Oak Hill Cemetery was not a long one. By the time they parked the car down a side street, hardly anyone was in sight. They filled their arms with shovels, a few other miscellaneous tools, a flashlight, and some boxes of salt. A matchbook in Dean’s pocket; the magnum, loaded with bullets, tucked in his jeans. He did not see a need for the gun, if he were honest, but it did give him a nice feeling of security, so he brought it along.
He stayed by Dean’s side when he asked him to. He said, “it’s ok”, without really feeling it because Dean needed it. And Dean deserved it. His older brother sacrificed so much for him, for the world, never asking for anything in return. It was the least Sam could do and at the same time the hardest thing he’d ever done.
cannot walk away from this.”
Dean smiled, relieved to hear that low gravelly voice, almost like a monotone song to his ears- one that washed away the ache and pain from the hunter’s bones. Castiel stood back and opened the door a little more, allowing the hunter to step inside the room.
Now, all that baggage started to trickle back in. His old fears and doubts were slowly making their way back to the surface. He mentally shook his head to try to push them down and looked to his friend who he now realized was walking away from him.
“On behalf of Jaybird and the Squealers, I would like to thank you for spending this night with us. And now, we’re going to end the night with a little something for the lovers out there.” Jaybird winked to the crowd. The mood of the music shifted from loud and bouncy to soft and smooth.
Sam lowered his hands and opened his eyes to the sight of Claire standing before him unblemished and otherwise healthy. But she was not alone. Standing right beside her, in all his glory was Jack, smiling and waving at Sam.
Dean felt the tension in the room and quickly looked down to try to dispel it. Rolling the beer bottle in between his hands gave him something to focus on.
“We’re hunters. This is for Dean. So, no chick-flick moments.”
Before he could change his mind, Dean reached a hand over the empty space that separated him and Castiel. His fingers clasped the angel’s wrist, twisting him around until their bodies’ centimeters apart, lips slightly parted. A flutter of nerves escaped Dean; hesitant lips met his own. Castiel stood stiffly at first. A moment of shock subsided. Unsure lips became more demanding. Arms soon found their way around Dean’s neck pulling him closer.
“Actually,” Dean said. “My friend here and I are huge history buffs. We were just passing through town but couldn’t help but notice some of the houses in the neighborhood.”
Castiel chuckled. “I’d be concerned if you did.” Dean snorted.
Dean hesitated; nerves kicked in. he pushed onward. “You look like you’d be a natural.”
With arms spread, he tackled assbutt #2 causing them both to fall to the ground. Dean took advantage of his position above the bully and punched him in the jaw. It did not last, however. Sed took a cue from Dean, jumped from his left side, and knocked him off assbutt #2. Dean first thought Sed to be the puny of the three, but what he lacked in muscle he made up for in speed. He was a slippery one and Dean was getting fed up with these bozos, especially since there was a ghost that looked ready to be tagged into the fight.
He looked around him only to see fog and maybe some sort of lake to his far left. Dean could barely make out the glint of moonlight off the water. Steam rose from the bent hood of the car. Dean quickly surmised that he must have hit the side of a bridge. When did he get to a bridge, anyway? It didn’t seem like a very long bridge though. He could see the edge of it a little far up ahead of him. Blurred lights through the fog were getting closer. The sound of a siren could be heard far off in the distance.
he semitransparent spirit of Arthur Munchin loomed just behind the oblivious bullies. Fury over his disturbed body exuded from the ghost like pus oozing from an infected wound. Dean had to think fast. Before Arthur Munchin could make his move, the hunter made his own.
“Oh, right,” Dean said shaking his head. “I miss Zeppelin.”
“Yes, well. I stood frozen at the bottom of the stairs. I heard a gurgling sound, which I know now was…“ Mrs. Smalls placed her hand over her mouth again to stop from crying. She took a deep breath before continuing her account. “It was Hubert choking for air! The sound jilted me out of my stupor, and I ran up the stairs, calling for him. But it was too late. By the time I’d gotten to him, Hubert was lying on the ground.”
“It’s just,” Castiel lowered his voice and leaned into the table. “I need to urinate.”
“Oh, right,” Castiel said sheepishly. “I must have forgotten.”
Castiel softly smiled. “You must miss him. I am a little surprised you waited so long to ask me about Sam. I expected that to be your first question.”
And Sam was fine with that. He had enough of intense, for a little while at least.
Distracted by the bullies, Dean did not see Arthur Munchin rapidly come at him. With an immense invisible force, Dean was thrown back, landing by the edge of the open grave. He had to get rid of this ghost fast.
“There’s something I’ve been wondering. Actually, there’s a lot of things that have been nagging at me…” Dean started.
“Dean helped a lot of people.”
Ahh, young love. Sam almost forgot what it felt like to be so in love and scared and excited all at the same time. Not that he does not feel those things for Eileen. But with age comes a new sort of deference to the whole ideal of love. The passion was still there, just a little calmer, a little less intense.
“I look like a grandpa.” Dean said with a raised eyebrow. “I mean look at this. These pants practically go up to my chest.”
“Oh no. no no no no.” Mrs. Smalls raised the hand that wasn’t on little Billy’s shoulder, to cover her mouth for a moment. She continued, “The voice did strike me as odd though- deep, guttural. It was most assuredly a man’s voice.”
“Dean’s top 13 Zepp Tra xx”
“Yea, but not tonight, buddy.”
Hunter and angel stood watching the fire in comfortable silence. A thunderclap rebounded through the night sky.
The song played on. “And time goes by so slowly….”
The storm was finally dissipating.
“Yes,” Castiel fished some out of a pocket. “We are beginning to run low on funds, Dean. It might be best- “
he car that Dean had found himself in before waking in the hospital was not his beloved Impala. Castiel had found the crashed car from the residual energy radiating off of it. The energy that resided from the electrical storm was so strong like a lighthouse beacon showing the way home. Dean grumbled about the lack of car, but Castiel had said that it was completely unusable which is why they found themselves following the anomaly's trail by foot (or rather, Dean followed Castiel).
“What? That’s not enough?” Dean was having a hard time keeping up. Too much at once. He really was back on earth.
“You are right about that. It does seem to be pointing to the conclusion that they are connected in some way.”
Back on present-day Earth, Sam struggles with life without his big brother.
Sam cut her off as quickly as could. “It is what it is.” He looked around the room. The song changed to some heavy metal song Sam didn’t recognize. “He would’ve loved this.”
“You weren’t ready” Dean scoffed, lowering his arm. “I thought heaven was fluid. You had boundless amounts of time, and you weren’t ready?”
Bobby and Charlie were not there, however. After everything that happened, the people from the alternate universe that Dean and Sam rescued, disappeared. Sam assumed Jack put everyone back in their place which meant all those people went back to their own universe. Sam would have appreciated seeing their faces again though.
He was half tempted to pick “Earth Angel” but thought better of it. “Too soon”, he thought. He ultimately chose a safer route and picked “Shout” by the Isley Brothers.
Castiel sighed in defeat. Dean smirked back, knowing he had won. “And what of the anomaly, Dean?”
She looked straight at the second officer and said simply, “he vanished.”
Sam ruminates on the side of a highway while out on a hunt with Claire.
“I need your love….”
“I’m sure he’s busy”, Dean said. Still, seeing Bobby, having Baby, and driving down an empty road with no real end in sight was a beautiful thing.
“Too damn long.”
Dean laughed. “Wait, the Darkness has skin?”
The sky ripped open once more, lightning collided with the Bel-air, sending electric shockwaves through its chrome exterior. Inside, however, was empty.
Dean twisted around towards the ghost just in time to get knocked back, away from the grave. Castiel emptied a box of salt over the casket and patted his pockets for a match.
The crowd grew as the night went on. Not one bare spot was noticeable on the dance floor. There was spinning and flipping. And there were glances. A gorgeous young brunette in a long yellow dress batted her eyelashes from across the room. When Dean noticed the come hither looks aimed in his direction, Castiel was in mid-conversation, telling him how Jack saved him from the empty, and all thoughts of yellow dresses disappeared.
“Zeppelin didn’t form until 1968. I’ve told you this before, man.”
The static cleared. The disjointed voice urgently responded. “Dean!”
The hunter stayed in Kansas, not quite ready to move on. He kept on hunting but less so. He got a menial office job working for a low-level newspaper company that specialized in publications designed for lawyers and law firms. He rented out a decent-sized apartment.
Castiel took a breath, choosing his words carefully. “There is an anomaly that has been appearing in heaven at random intervals. Jack and I have been having a difficult time, to say the least, pinpointing what it is or even exactly where it is coming from.” He took a few more steps into the room, closer to Dean.  “Whatever it is, it has been causing these electrical bursts throughout heaven.”
“It will. I know, Sam. I’ve been doing this for a while now.”
Eileen had wanted to come but had been on a case in Ireland for two weeks. She was ready to board the next plane to be by Sam’s side, but he told her not to. After everything that had happened, his relationship with the mute hunter had been rocky at best. Chuck manipulating their lives was not something she was able to reconcile quickly with. Sam didn’t blame her though. They decided to take things slow and he remained hopeful.
Sam readied himself in a defensive stance, determination pouring out of his pores.
Suddenly, the weight was lifted off Sam’s back and he immediately jumped-up straight, groaning along the way. He looked to Claire, who already had her steel blade up in the air, blood dripping to the hilt. The second vampire, headless, fell to the floor.
“Gentlemen.”, Dean said raising his arms in mock-surrender. “You guys look pretty sensible. No one wants a fight here. So why don’t we stow the homophobic slurs and call it a night. Huh?”
“Where exactly are we headed?” Dean asked.
The librarian’s smile fell. The cat backed away from its prey. “I’ll see what I can find.” She scurried away.
Really, the only thinking remarkably different were the prices- everything under a dollar. Even the food on the menu was the same- burgers and sandwiches, milkshakes, and sodas. And Dean couldn’t forget the apple pie (“15 cents a slice?! I’ll take 2, please!”).
“And how can I help you today, sir?” she asked. Her voice almost purred if humans could purr. Her light blue eyes focused entirely on Dean.
The annoyed, quiet angel sitting across from him, arms folded, wasn’t helping matters.
Claire sighed. No one ever knew what to say to Sam in those moments. Sam didn’t even know what to say to Sam in those moments. It was best to just change the topic as quickly as possible and hope that that would be enough. It was still a learning process though. And Claire was a very stubborn girl.
It was a long freakin’ day- the overcast sky contributed to the grey thoughts from the memories of the days’ events. Dean felt drained and sore from the battle with the prince of hell, Ramiel. Surprisingly, Crowley really stepped up to the plate to help the Winchesters and their angel out, and Dean was silently grateful for it. Watching his best friend slowly die in agony was the hardest thing he has had to deal with in a long while. The image of that black poison gushing out of his best friend’s mouth kept forcing its way into Dean’s subconscious so much so that he couldn’t shake the image nor the feeling of panic and fear that accompanied it.
But let’s face it. The feeling he has for the fallen angel was different. It’s not every day that someone saves you from hell or defies heaven for you; literally falls from the heavens for you. Call it profound, call it ineffable, call it whatever the hell you want. But inwardly, Dean knew. Whatever it was, it was so passed familial, and hovered over dangerous uncharted territory. And Dean was not ready for it to make its landing.
“Hey, we know you’re out here!” slurred asshat #1.
Defeated, Dean grabbed the rest of the clothes and traipsed over to the tiny bathroom connected to the room. After relieving himself, he swiftly washed up via the small white sink and changed clothes.  The pleated pants fit almost perfectly. The shirt (a little snug around the chest) was a red and gray striped short-sleeved V-neck with matching-colored buttons down the center, stopping halfway. The shoes matched the pants in color too (“who did Cas steal these from?”). They were a half-size too big, but Dean figured he could manage. A cardigan completed the typical 1950s style. Overall, Dean felt self-conscience- he missed his flannel and boots. He grumbled once he was back in front of the angel.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel smiled that all too familiar smile, softening his features.
Dean plucked up some courage with the help of his new friend, Mr. White Russian, and turned to Castiel. “you ever dance before?”
Sam was quickly surrounded by people. After Donna, there was Precious Turner and Chrissy Chambers (“you’re hunting now?”), Jesse and Cesar Cuevas (“still retired?”). A group of hunters Sam hadn’t seen in ages were grouped together by the couch, sipping bottles of beer. Walt and Roy were among them.
Exposition, thy name is Castiel.
Dean saw a glint of guilt in the angel’s eyes. His anger subsided. For that moment. “My head’s pounding. You’re gonna have to give me a minute to get all this straight. So, time rift- what does that mean exactly? Are we in a ‘save the clocktower’ type situation? How
“What sort of luck? Are you expecting something that requires luck?” Castiel completely missed the reference.
The impala suddenly vanished into the pitch-black sky along with its singular occupant.
Castiel quickly straightened, a crunch of dirt behind Dean. He whipped himself around and ducked just in time as assbutt #2’s closed fist whizzed by his ear. Dean grabbed the outreached arm and pulled it back flush against the bully’s back, his elbow at an awkward angle. He moaned, “All right, all right. I give!"
“Shacked up?” Sam asked bemused.
“Dean, it’s probably best if we keep somewhat of a low profile.” He nodded towards the couple.
A moment of silence transcended the two old friends. Dean realized his mouth was still hanging open and swiftly shut it. He was so surprised; he couldn’t help the gulp that followed. “Cas?” He asked in a sort of reverence. “Wow”. A light blushed graced Dean’s freckled cheeks at the endearment.
“Jody…” Sam instantly hugged her which she returned with a pat on the back and a sniffle.
“Sam!”
“Not quite. When Jack defeated Chuck, Jack infused his own power with Chuck’s, and already having Amara’s flowing through him, Jack became more powerful than the Darkness itself. He planned to restore the universe, heaven, everything. That included restoring angels as it is our energy that sustains heaven’s immensity. Jack did not just save me, Dean. He reawakened all of us.”
Sam chuckled. “We’re taking things slow.”
Dean sighed and nodded. “A bit yea.”
After finishing their meal, Castiel placed his hands on the table. “Dean?”
He looked at the thermometer wearily but did as he was told.
“Yes, although it isn’t an exact quote. But I suppose it pertains to the current situation.” Castiel replied.
He finished the last dregs of his beer and put headphones to ears, listening to the comforting sounds of Led Zeppelin’s ‘Thank You’ as he laid down and closed his eyes, falling asleep to the feel of full lips against his.
When he remembered that Dean had the matches he called, “Dean- “
How can silence be comforting and awkward at the same time?
“Those friends of Dorothy are out here, Sed.”
“I figured that will be useful to you at some point.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Uh…Hey, Dead body burning. We should probably pack up before anyone decides to pick a fight.”
“Thank you, Dean. For everything.”
“Yea. Yea he did.” Jody eyes watered.
Sam and Jody stepped out of the hall and into the living room. Sam was so distracted by the left-over rain on his now cold and damp clothes that he didn’t even notice the people. It was a small gathering of about 30 people. Some of them Sam knew from random hunts him and Dean have worked together.
he incessant sound of a car horn jolted Dean out of unconsciousness. His head was pounding. Of course, heaven couldn’t have been a calm and boring place. He grunted as he slowly lifted his head from its resting place against the steering wheel. The noise stopped and he opened his eyes. The light from the streets added to the pain of Dean’s headache.
I apologize for any inaccuracies. I only have minimum knowledge of basic routines for car accident victims in hospitals. Please, feel free to leave comments below.
“How’s things going with Eileen? You ask her to move in yet?” Her attempt at light-hearted subterfuge seemed to work.
Dean blushed. Did Castiel just flirt with him?
The cars were freaking awesome. Dean’s love of cars mostly centered around the 1966 to late 1970’s era muscle cars. Those were amazing beauties- built to last and to live in. Most of the models were large and metal and chrome and could withstand anything, except maybe gas prices. Some (like Baby) have proven to last the test of time. But Baby would not have been Baby if not for its ancestors. A cream-white 1957 Chevy Impala with red rims drove by, making Dean’s mouth water.
ean was in his element. He lucked out and managed to find an unoccupied 1956 Chevy Bel-Air hardtop, sky blue and ivory exterior, with matching interior vinyl bucket seats. Dean breathed in that old car smell and smiled to himself.
Castiel impatiently sighed and moved a few inches toward Dean, elbows brushed together. The scent of fresh earth and diner food filled the space around them. “4207 Maple Drive. We need all the information you have on this location. Now.” His eyes narrowed.
“Could it be because this weather has gone nutso recently?”
Yeah, Sam had questions. Although, he usually kept them to himself.
A little surprised, a little shocked Dean managed to mumble some sort of ‘goodnight’ before Castiel closed the door quietly, thus putting the wall back up between the two…
“Sam, we’ve been over this,” Claire huffed. “The vamp nest is right there, west of those abandoned trained tracks. I staked it out myself.”
“Wait, I died. Shouldn’t I be a ghost?” What was that word Sam used?  “Incorporeal?” Dean stood up. Screw being half-naked.
Dean pulled Castiel in for another deep kiss. He was more than willing to stand there for the rest of the night, hell for the rest of his life.
Sam deserves a good night’s sleep. At least one of us can get some shut eye.
Farther into the room were two short staircases- one leading to the next floor, one to the lower. The two men followed the signs leading to the informational desk where a female librarian stood watch.
The door creaked open, revealing a rumpled looking angel. He was dressed in borrowed sweats and a solid black t-shirt that Dean gave him. It was to replace his usual suit and tan coat until the angel got his mojo back up and running to magic the torn and dirtied outfit back to pristine conditions.
He stopped dragging his feet through the hall of the bunker’s barracks and stood in front of Castiel’s door. Though the poison left his body, the angel was still weak, and recuperation was a slow process. The brothers offered up a vacant bedroom in the bunker for Castiel to rest in. Not that he really slept. But at least it was more comfortable than sitting in one of the library’s chairs all night.
“You too, Donna,” Sam smiled back.
With flushed cheeks, Castiel coughed a few more times before answering. “Just some food caught in my throat.”
“Well, nobody’s perfect.” Dean shrugged.
“I bought you something.” Castiel twisted towards the back and sifted through the bags.
“You know,” he started thoughtfully, “at first I did. But lately, I don’t know… I just keep getting this… feeling. Something isn’t right.
They stopped a few passers-by for directions who seemed all too genial to help a uniformed officer in need. Why Castiel did not like this era was something that Dean questioned. Although, he figured, that probably had something to do with the fancy ‘costume’ he wore.
Dean looked ahead. The sky was giving the impression of a perpetual sunset- light blues turned into darker shades of blues; the blues blended into the yellows and oranges; oranges turned into red then deeper reds. The eternalness of it all began to sink in. How long as he been driving down this long stretch of road? Better yet, how long has he been listening to this same song?
Dean cleared his throat, trying simultaneously to clear the unease but failing dismally.  He broke their gaze and dared to step over the threshold that is the doorway and sat on the edge of the bed.
At first Dean, was thrilled. But with the thrill of seeing his best friend came a bubble of anger at the disappointment of not seeing him in heaven. Why now? Dean tried to keep his cool though- take care of the current issue first. With a grimace, he shifted his body lowering his feet to the floor, so he was facing Castiel more fully. A cool draft from the gown reminded Dean of how little he had on and promptly covered his legs with the bed blanket.
Before Castiel could finish his sentence, Dean had already grabbed the outstretched handful of money. “Be right back.”
“Our Mr. John Doe, I see you are awake.” Her tone of voice very clipped.
“I do wish the circumstances were better. Sam, I am so sorry- “
Deep gash vamp held Claire by the throat with one hand, her legs frantic, trying to make physical contact with the big guy’s torso but she couldn’t reach. Sam laid unconscious in the mud outside the train car for a long two minutes from a brutal whack across the chest, his shirt torn showing the bloodied slash of vampire nail.
A glint of light from the street lamppost shone onto a clothing department’s window display. “You got any more cash on you, Cas?”
Dean was lost in the sensation of heat and passion, skin against skin as the kiss became more demanding. A moan rumbled from one of the two. Dean was not quite sure which. He didn’t really care either. Kissing Castiel felt like he was back in heaven. Except this was better.
He’d been sifting through old newspaper articles on an old microform for the past two hours. The screen of the old machine was giving him a headache. What he wouldn’t give for an actual computer and some internet service.
“Well, yea. They were totally…” Claire looked at Sam’s confused expression and seemed to decide against finishing her thought.
“If you found all the information you need, then we should go. We’ve wasted enough time as it is.” Castiel abruptly stood and walked towards the exit leaving the hunter to scramble after him.
That one word caught in his throat- “love”. It was so rarely used in Dean’s life. Yet, it was not something he took for granted. He felt it- of course he felt it. With all his being, he felt it. Love for his younger brother, Sam; love for his mother, Mary. Love for his close friends, Jody, Claire- those he considers family. Familial love was easy, comfortable. And Dean tried to pin Castiel in that same category. Outwardly, he declared it- Castiel is family, no question. Because Dean equates family with love. It was all so simple.
He gave the angel a once-over, stopping at those deep blue eyes. “You- you look good…uh. Are you feeling ok?”.  He inwardly winced at his own stutter.
Dean fell silent. He was disappointed to say the least.
Why is my heart beating so fast?
“Was that not the correct address?”
“Sam,” Claire choked out.
Dean glanced around the room, a sea of endless heteronormative couples. “I would ask you to dance. But I got a feeling it wouldn’t go over well here.”
The music suddenly crackled like bad reception cutting in and out.  A moment of fluctuating static interference passed before it was replaced by white noise. Dean scrunched his forehead.  He played with the dials on the dash, to try to fix the signal. “Do I even need a signal in heaven?” he thought. “How the hell does that even work here?”
“Maybe he found Castiel,” Claire said hopeful. “Maybe they finally got over themselves and shacked up. Livin’ the domestic dream life in heaven.”
Dean looked to Castiel. “I was really only missing one thing.”
Keep it together, Winchester.
“The song that you were humming is “That’s the Way”,” Castiel said. “It is a beautiful song. I might go so far as to say it’s my favorite.”
“Did you recognize the voice, Mrs. Smalls?” the second officer asked.
“Yea, ok.” Dean huffed, feeling awkward. “I’ll just wait here then.”
“I made peace with my fate, Dean. But being there…it was more harrowing than I expected- reliving those memories repeatedly. But the thought of you…and Sam filled me with a sense of hope and happiness the Darkness did not appreciate.” Cas chuckled. ‘Apparently, I have a talent for being an “incessant pestilence that chafes under the skin.’ The Darkness’s words, not mine.”
But what Dean was really after was the bar.
“You’re just being dramatic, Dean. I think you look very…. handsome”. Castiel smiled innocently.
“Uh, er.” Dean’s mind went blank. Normally, he’d have a pseudonym and a back story all ready to go for situations like this. But he was dead. He was supposed to be in heaven on a permanent holiday, not wherever the hell he was now. Though, judging by the dulled look of things and a bitter taste he couldn’t quite put a name to, he’d say he was back on earth. Thankfully he didn’t need to worry about coming up with anything because suddenly the room was occupied by a third person.
“And what time period is that?” Dean questioned.
Dean pouted, letting assbutt #2 go. He stepped back instantly, clutching his sore arm. “You guys are nuts.”
“I forgot how beautiful this can be.”
“No. I’m positive- no.”
Suddenly, a burst of bright light engulfed the car, Sam shielded his eyes from the intense light. A piercing screeee sound ripped through the air. Sam dropped the blade on instinct and covered his bleeding ear drums. With eyes closed, he had no idea what was happening. His only thought was “Jack, please protect Claire”.
“Dean,” Castiel nudged the hunter’s elbow. The drinks lay on the bar in front of them. Dean lifted his drink to the bartender as if in thanks but all he got back were narrowed beady eyes.
Sed rose from the ground on shaky legs. He and assbutt #2 collected their other hapless compatriot and shuffled back through the cemetery gates.
The rain pelted down like a Gatling gun with infinite ammo, the sound of it hitting against the windows echoed through the stuffy train car.
The ghost’s look of rage turned to that of anguish. An unearthly scream bubbled up from the spirit as it burned along with its body until it was finally gone.
“The cemetery is 10 miles west of here. It’s still too early to go sneaking around without raising some eyebrows. Way I see it, we’re here.  We might as well kick back a little, enjoy the “Golden age”. Besides, man, I’ve been here for how long? And I haven’t touched a drink once?! I think I deserve a little hooch, huh? When was the last time you let loose a little too? We both deserve it.”
“What?”
He was about to make some pop-culture reference Dean would have enjoyed. He stopped when Claire’s smiled turned down. Her eyes stared right behind him. He quickly twisted to see a male vampire- big, (bigger than him), broad with sharp teeth, a deep gash across his forehead, and he was angry.
Dean did not have any money on him. Why would he? He did not need it in heaven, and he wasn’t exactly planning the Back to the Future trip. Luckily, Castiel thought ahead and procured some money. Dean wasn’t too sure where, but he was not about to question it.
“So were me and Dean,” Sam murmured gaining immediate sympathy from the young hunter.
“Any updates on the anomaly? And are we really stickin’ with that name? I feel like we could do better.” Dean wondered aloud.
Sam folded up the map. The two hunters got into the car, Sam behind the drivers’ wheel. He turned the key in the ignition, bringing Baby back to life. The engine’s sound of purr meets roar pervaded Sam’s ears. Sometimes, it was as if the car was weeping, missing its true owner. He gave the steering wheel a comforting pat.
They subtly inched their way to the woman and policemen, enough so that they’d be within earshot but still out of view.
Castiel shifted from one foot to another. An army cap rested in the crook of his right arm and hip. “Well,” Castiel begins, “Dean Winchester, I am here to rescue you.”
Castiel reappeared in a matter of moments, holding out a folded set of clothes toward Dean.
“No,” Castiel said shortly.
“Hey,” Dean mumbled out.
“It is February, ma’am,” the second officer mumbled. The first officer cleared his throat and scolded his partner with a piercing stare. “Um, continue. Please.” At least he seemed ashamed of his own comment.
Dean nodded in response. A silence passed between them.
Castiel sighed. “I suppose we can stop to have one drink. If we have ‘time to murder’.”
But his guilt for his older brother’s death outweighed the pride- guilt of the loss of his best friend, the one person he had always looked up to and relied upon. When the chips were down, when the shit got shittier, Dean was always there by Sam’s side to fix whatever needed fixing.
Castiel stopped short and faced Dean. Dean felt heat rise to his face from the close proximity and cleared his throat. “No, I cannot use my mojo. At least not extensively. I can heal you if truly necessary. But it isn’t stable. And any energy I do exert,” he continued pointedly, “will not be replaced quickly. I can only use it sparingly. There’s more.”
“I’m alright! Just get the salt!” Dean ordered.
Sam smiled in appreciation. “Thanks, Garth.”
There was tension in the air. A trapeze artist could have walked across the space between them and not have fallen. It was clear something needed to break. Someone had to say something. Dean just did not want it to be him.
“Please, continue,” said the first officer.
A flash of a headlight caught Dean’s eye, sobering him up. “Cas, the flashlight.”
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel’s familiar tone crushed the silence of the night.
“Dean,” Castiel admonished.
Sam laughed. “Right”, Sam affirmed.
“I think you look very nice, Dean.” Castiel averted his eyes when Dean’s head shot up.
“For how long?” Castiel gazed longingly.
Even still, it thrilled him and terrified him how much he wanted to reciprocate those feeling that Castiel felt. But that niggling fear kept holding him back. He thought he left it behind in heaven. Apparently, he had a stow-away.
“On a stormy sea of moving emotion, I set a course…”
Asshat #2 sneered. “Now, who here said we weren’t wantin’ to fight?”
Dean didn’t realize how much negative weight he had been carrying around with him all his life until after he died and went to heaven. It was like all that extra baggage was just left at the gate. But now…
The second verse began- guitar chords in tune with the drums’ beat. “I’ll stop in a little while”. Dean was going to enjoy every moment of this while he could. He let Steve Walsh’s vocals wash over him as he pressed down on the gas pedal just a little, burning rubber on the sun-soaked asphalt as he went along.
Castiel tilted his head in confusion. “Yes. Asmodeus and Dagon are left- both formidable demons not to be taken lightly. It will take immense amounts of power to defeat them should we need to.” Castiel slowly moved to sit beside Dean.
The vampire snarled, “Let’s rumble, big boy.”
“You were in a car accident. No serious injury aside from that gash to your noggin. I’m just going to check your vitals now.” She magicked up a glass thermometer from where, Dean was afraid to think too much about where. “Stick out your tongue.”
It was just a mass chain of sadness and uncontrollable laughter as Claire told the story of when she and Dean went mini golfing. She omitted the parts about her mother, and Sam was fairly sure she tweaked the story a bit just to make everyone laugh a little.
One thing Dean could say- Jaybird and the Squealers put on a good show. They played mostly covers, sticking with upbeat numbers even he could dance to. Some of the songs that he recognized (‘jailhouse Rock’, ‘Hound Dog’, ‘Sha’boom’) were mostly Elvis Presley renditions and that song from ‘Clue’.
The nurse seemed to get a case of the butterflies because she was all aflutter. “Oh, sir. Of course.”
Sam laughed. “Garth! Man, how’s it going?” Garth let go, allowing Sam to turn to face the tall lanky werewolf. He saw the distraught expression from Garth and said, “Garth. It’s alright.”
“Oh thank, fuck. It was just a dream,” Dean mumbled. He tried to focus and take in everything. He was in a plain white hospital gown and nothing else. Alright, no total surprise there.  The walls were white, the floor was white, everything was so damn white it hurt.
“So, this is heaven, huh?” Dean said to no one. He could feel the little hairs on his neck blowing from the wind through the open window of his 1967 Chevrolet Impala. The smell of the vinyl upholstery mixed with hot motor oil and exhaust fumes permeated his senses. He smiled.
“I was just informing your brother of his injuries- “
The weather had certainly changed morose, in Sam’s opinion. His hunter instincts were ringing in his head like a Spidey-sense.
Dean’s jaw dropped. That third person was occupying the vessel of Jimmy Novak yet encompassed the prominence of Castiel, angel of Thursdays- his best friend; brother in arms. Those deep blue eyes stared back at him; his head slightly tilted to the side. He looked quite spiffy too. He apparently traded in his trademark suit, blue tie and trench coat for an army officers’ dress uniform complete with some shiny pins along both sides of the collar. “I am his brother. His name is Dean. I am Corporal Novak.”
She was beginning to lose hope when a groan came from the corner.
She checked his eyes for dilation and overall cognizance. “Possible concussion.” She picked up her clipboard and continued giving it her undivided attention. “You didn’t have any identification on you. What is your name? Is there someone we can call for you? A family member?” She finally looked up again and stared at Dean’s blank face.
“A time rift is, well, a gateway. Much like the rift Jack inadvertently created between our known universe and the alternate ones. Though, in this case, it connected heaven with a perceived time here on earth.” Castiel looked behind him as if he just remembered there could be eavesdroppers. “We should finish this conversation somewhere else, Dean.”
Before his thoughts could form some sort of logical reasoning because well, denial is always so much easier, Dean stumbled to his bedroom, lightheaded as he felt.
“What’s the magic word?” Dean tightened his grip.
Jack had said he planned to be hands-off and Sam knew he meant it. Jack was in everything- from every grain of dirt to every single molecule in the air- and Sam believed it; felt it in his bones. Even though he was not there physically, Jack was there. It was comforting at the time.
“No,” Castiel said resolutely. “I wasn’t ready to face you because I didn’t know what to say. And, at the same time, I knew exactly what to say to you. I have thought of countless ways you would react and respond, Dean. I suppose, in the end, I just… got cold feet. But, Dean, I would never take back what I said. Because I have never meant anything more profoundly.”
“Yea,” Dean said with anticipation.
Six feet of dirt, and who knew how many pounds, laid in a high pile beside the hole they dug from. Castiel worked on opening the top of the casket with a pry bar. Sweat dripped down Dean’s temple.
He turned the radio dial with a click. Ella Fitzgerald’s voice accompanied the deep tone of Louis Armstrong's.
Dean smirked. Finally. “I’m on it.”
But Sam wasn’t alone for long. He was pulled in further to the room by Donna Hanscum.
Dean thought of flirting with some of the women in the room, just to get those homophobic pricks off their backs. But the last time he did that, Castiel became grumpy and jealous and that was the opposite of what Dean’s intentions were. So, he ignored the women.
One of the deputies (the older-looking and chunkier of the two) spoke gently, “I understand this is difficult, ma’am. Any information though will help in uncovering what happened here.”
“Dean, we do not have time for this.” Castiel stood stiffly in front of Dean.
A crackle in the sky caught Dean’s attention. In front of him, the sky turned an angry shade of dark A lightning bolt crashed, splitting the sky in two. “This isn’t supposed to happen!” Dean risked a glance out the window at the brewing storm while quickly rolling up the glass.
He started questioning the use of the term ‘hell’ while in heaven when the music came back on. The sound of the electric guitar, however, was replaced by soothing crooning and a soft bass beat.
“And you didn’t hear anything else before the shouting? Something that might indicate a break-in. A window breaking, perhaps.”
Huh? Dean was stunned. Why should he be though? He’s been to hell, purgatory a couple times. He’s even been to alternate universes on several occasions. He’s died more times than Voldemort had horcruxes. Still, he really expected the last death to count.
“I am a little embarrassed…”
The sound of someone shuffling about on the other side of the bedroom door jostled Dean out of his thoughts. Preparing himself, he took a deep sigh and softly knocked on the door.
Dean looked down at himself and waved his arms in front of him. “Uh, Cas buddy. I’m gonna need some fresh duds. Ain’t no one gonna let me out of this hospital like…this. Plus, it’s, uh…drafty”, Dean smiled sheepishly.
His nerves quickly abated, instinct kicked in, when an ambulance suddenly drove down the road, its sirens echoed behind.
Dean felt concerned and was about to vocalize said concern. But Castiel peeked at him over his raised glass of water, a smile tugged at his lips crinkling his eyes, and Dean forgot what he was about to say.
A heavyset older woman carrying a clipboard finally walked into the room. She had the worst sour-lemon look Dean ever remembered seeing. Oh, this will be fun.
But Sam’s attention was centered solely on the map- flat on the hood of his black Impala- and the young blonde standing next to him, getting impatient.
Dean smacked his lips together after a long sip of his white Russian. “How’s your pink drink?” Dean smirked.
Dean’s eyes lit up. “Thanks!” What to choose? Sifting through the choices, his smile slowly faded. “Right, the 50’s. It’s all doo-wop and jazz”.
The fear and desperation in Claire’s voice was enough for Sam to force himself onto wobbly legs. Rain bullets bounced off the blade Claire had dropped during the scuffle. Sam slowly limped toward it, grabbed it by the hilt, and mustered all his residual strength for one last swing.
When they stepped outside, Dean’s immediate thought was, “so this is what Marty Mcfly must have felt when he stepped into Hill Valley for the first time”. The song Mr. Sandman began playing in a loop in his head.
“So, princes of hell, huh? Azazel, now Ramiel. Two down. Two to go. I’m guessin’ it’s probably too much to hope that they’re on a Disney prince level of bad.” Dean chuckled at his own joke.
Old nerves and fears started kicking in the pit of Dean’s gut. He wasn’t sure he was alive again before. But he was positive, that he was alive right then if the butterflies in his stomach were any indication. “Let’s just get out here, Cas.” He waved his arms toward the door. “Lead the way, man.”
“I’m sorry. This must be strange for you.”
“Holy shit, what the hell is that?” Sed cried out. He finally saw the ghost of Arthur Munchin.
Sam smiled. “Yea…maybe. Anyway, Jack wouldn’t have let Dean rot in hell. Not after everything. No, he’s gotta be in heaven,” he said half-heartedly.
ean was humming “That’s the Way” loudly while sitting in a booth opposite the angel. A couple behind them turned their heads in annoyance.
Dean ignored the mangled phrase and patted Castiel on the shoulder. “There ya go. The 1950’s was kinda cool- I mean they got Elvis Presley and poodle skirts.” The hunter glanced at his uniform-clad companion with a nod. “Gotta admit, though, I’m digging the outfit. Definitely better than a poodle skirt.”
“Claire!” Sam grunted out.
“Like the lightning storm that hit me?”
“Dean,” Castiel started hesitantly. He knew the hunter well enough that discussing emotions and feelings were not in the realm of Dean’s comfort zone. “What I said earlier- “
The angel grumbled to the empty car.
Dean’s foot loosened on the gas pedal as he glanced back and forth from the road to the receiver. He tried changing the station again, but the song remained the same.
Dean continued playing “Safe” songs throughout their meal. He didn’t realize how hungry he was until he bit into his burger. This was heaven. Oh, how he missed the juicy salty taste of fried red meat covered in cheese and onions (“extra onion!”) and ketchup and pressed between 2 slices of seeded bread. He couldn’t help the satisfied moan that escaped his lips.
“Yes.”
“What the hell?” Dean mumbled.
The notes to Led Zeppelin’s ‘That’s the Way’ reached Sam’s ears as the door finally creaked opened. Jody craned her neck upward and brightened in delight.
“It moved?” Gray clouds enclosed the black sky, thunder roared from up above. A lightning bolt unexpectedly crashed in the distance, lighting up the sky for a brief second.
“So, you got out again because you annoyed it enough?”
“I will find out, you know.”
“Hey, Jody,” Sam smiled.
“So, we’re gonna work the case?” Dean almost begged. Castiel chuckled at his child-like whimsy.
He glanced towards Castiel who, thankfully, was winning his own fight against assbutt #1. Fletch was huge comparatively to the angel, like a freaking stone pillar. But Fletch never led his own garrison. Castiel spun around behind the big guy and jumped on his back, his arms tight around the burly guy’s thick neck slowly blocking air to his windpipe. Castiel held on long enough until Fletch kneeled to the ground, lost consciousness, and subsequently fell face first onto the mossy ground.
Like taking the time to be with friends and loved ones. Dean once told Sam that he wanted a big funeral- big and loud and everyone there together. Well, Sam may not have been able to handle the big and loud just yet, but he did owe his big brother the ‘together’ part.
He lifted a hand to his head only to come away with blood. “Son of a bitch,” Dean slurred. His eyesight became fuzzy as he passed out.
“Dean. I meant every word.” Dean looked up- green eyes locked with blue.
Dean turned, his back against the bar as he watched the dancing couples.
This was not your everyday librarian. At least not for the 1950’s. She did have the fashionable cat-eyes framed glasses accompanied by a tight bun hairstyle that was stereotypical of a librarian. But Dean could just tell, once the doors closed for the night, those glasses would come off, that bun would come undone, and the lioness would come out to play. At least, that’s what he imagined.
“Which is?”
Eventually, Dean managed to calm himself down. That probably was not the best reaction especially after he said that he was embarrassed. But Dean couldn’t control it. There was a huge tension bubble waiting to burst. “I’ll make it up to him”, Dean thought. Many ways he could accomplish that task sprang to mind and the tension bubble began to refill itself.
The library itself was pretty much precisely as you’d expect. A kiosk stood by the front entrance. It was littered with pamphlets and signs for book readings, informational classes, and a kids’ “knowledge is power” artwork display on a corkboard.
Castiel hesitated. “Yes. That is not all. The anomaly… is also affecting my grace.” Castiel continued walking down the street. Dean followed a few steps after.
“Is that?” Dean was almost afraid to say his name aloud.
He looked up from his burger when Castiel choked. “Cas, you okay?”
“I feel slightly better. That poison took a lot out of me. I should be back to full power in a few days’ time.”
“Oh, here let me get that from ya.” Sam passed the box over and took his coat off. “Claire is on coat duty”, she said looking around the house from where they stood, “but of course she disappeared. She and Kaia are probably off doing… well, let’s not think about that.”
He shifted, smirking at an oddly quiet Castiel. “Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold.”
A moment passed before anyone spoke. The second officer grew too anxious, however. “And then what happened?”
But there was a downside to this decade- everything was so slow. Dean lived a life of having access to any and all information at the touch of a button. But this was a different time- a time without internet, a time without computers, a time without food delivery. It was a time where there was no electronic device attached to the hip and it left Dean feeling disconnected from the world. To put it simply, he missed "WiFi".
Dean waved the stout bartender over. “A white Russian and a…pink squirrel for my friend here.” The bartender narrowed his beady eyes at the two men before making their order.
And he tried to ignore the stares. The bartender leaned towards them; the glaring became too unbearable. Dean took that as their cure to leave. He bumped Castiel’s arm toward the exit. Thankfully, that was all it took for the angel to understand. Maybe he was more aware of the glares than Dean thought.
“Green,” Cas answered, finding no oddity in the unusual question.
“Okay, if you say so. But, Dean, you know if there is ever anything you need to talk about”—
“Of course.”
“What about the soulless ones? Amara’s been busy,” Dean spoke. “Crowley killed Jenna, it seemed to be the only thing that worked or are you still in to saving all the people?”
“Yeah, I mean, I just bottle it all up and hope I can get through it all without exploding. It’s easier that way.”
“Yeah,” Dean chirped, unsure of what to say.
“And Rudy, and this whole town, and Amara’s parents, hell, even Death, and I wouldn’t feel like such a screw up…” Dean’s words trailed off and lost him. He was unsure of what to say. The two sat in silence for a few moments, Dean unwilling to look at Cas, feeling ashamed and embarrassed of all of his mistakes. Cas watched him carefully, hands still touching. His eyes fluttered downwards, staring at them briefly before he looked up at Dean again.
“It’s quiet,” said Sam softly, sipping his beer.
“What happened…Cas, you didn’t deserve that. You’ve never deserved that, and you never will. You’re the greatest friend I have, and what I did,” Dean’s voice cracked, “I know it traumatized you, and it traumatized me, too. Scared the hell out of me—still does, and always will. I don’t ever want to lose control of myself like that ever again, and I don’t ever want to hurt you, so I’m sorry. For everything…for whatever you are experiencing right now, for whatever in the past, but I’m going to really try in the future to be the kind of friend to you as you are to me,” his eyes finally met Cas, “I want you to know that you can talk to me about whatever you are feeling, and that I want to help you get through this.”
“And don’t think for a second that we don’t care about you,” Dean reassured, “Because we do. I do. I care about you, Cas. I know I’m too harsh on you. I know I bicker with you and tease you. I know I’m an ass, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care about you. You’re family to me, Cas—you’re family to Sam, and this is where you belong. With us, so that feeling of being used… no more. You’re not the world’s play toy, Cas. You’re a person—angel, whatever, and you’re important. Sam and I will help you in any way you need, and you and I will get through this rough patch together, and if you ever feel this way ever again talk to me and we will work through it like we always do, but for now we have to get you off the Netflix. I know you’re trying to use that as a comfort, but it’s time we ease you back in to the world. Baby steps, but we are going to get you back to you again.”
“I understand that the conversations we have are private,” Cas recites like a sullen robot, and Dean hides a smile into the curve of Cas’ neck.
Dean glares down at the rag in his hand and tries to unclench his jaw. "You lose your phone or something?" he asks in a low voice, knowing the answer.
“Gonna teach me?” Dean smirked, unable to help himself.
“It’s not going to hu—
"What the—" Sam gasps, jumping up from where he'd been napping against the window.
Cas looks up to see him looking and smiles, just a small quirk at the corner of his lips, but it reassures Dean. Cas comes back down to the bed and slides up behind him, his dick heavy and thick against Dean’s ass. He feels Cas kiss him between his shoulder blades and warmth bubbles up inside him, a familiar response to all of Cas’ touches.
“Why did you do that?” Cas asks, eyes wide. He reaches a hand up to touch his own lips wonderingly.
When Cas—the sheriff—when the sheriff finally withdrew the gun, Dean took in a shaky breath at the absence. The sheriff placed the gun on the bar without looking at it and sank down to his knees, grabbed him and pressed his lips to Dean’s open mouth. Dean kissed back on instinct, his mouth still slack. His thoughts still felt like molasses, slow and dazed.
Castiel says that to him sometimes, whispers in his ear, “You’re beautiful,” as he teases his soft earlobe and mouths at the perfect line of his jaw.
He doesn't hear a response from Cas so he turns around to look at him. Cas is looking down at Kushiel with his face tight and his fists clenched. He looks angry but there's something else in his expression too, something that looks a little like shame.
Sam sighs and turns back to his window.
Dean gets it, gets that Cas needs to protect himself from him. It’s almost a relief to have Cas tell him what to do. He nods and promises, “Okay.”
Thankfully, Cas stops and switches hands, and the new angle is awkward enough that he has to go a lot slower, which gives Dean a reprieve. Cas’ new rhythm is steady but relaxed and as Dean’s heart rate eases, he draws Cas’ mouth in for that belated kiss. Cas uses his lubed up right hand to pull Dean's leg up higher on his hip but Dean is too loose-limbed to feel anxious about what’s coming. He feels Cas' hand reaching around him, the weight of Cas' wrist on the curve of his ass, and keeps his eyes on the blue glint of Cas' own, and bites his lip. When Cas' finger ghosts over his hole, he sucks in a breath, unable to help it. The sensation is so foreign, and the skin there so sensitive.
"Hello, Dean," Cas says.
"We're supposed to be working, you know," Dean tries again, though he's not sure why he's bothering to argue when he's undoing Cas' belt at the same time. Maybe it’s the fact that doing this in a church feels extra illegal, like an archangel is going to come smite them where they stand or something.
He means it. It’s the first true thing he’s said to Cas in a long time.
They do make a mess, and Cas winds up doing most of the cleanup, cheating a little with his angel mojo. Dean directs him from where he’s stretched out on the bed. Dean thinks he’s earned the right to lay back and be taken care of for once since he’s (a) human, and (b) just lost his ass virginity.
Cas looks at him for a long moment and something like disappointment replaces the confusion on his face. Then he looks away, drawing into himself, somehow smaller than before. It’s strange how, even as a human, Cas can see right through him.
“Am I hurting you?” Cas asks, sounding worried.
“I don’t understand, what is the significance of the color of the underwear?”
And Dean closes his eyes and nods, feeling recognition deep within his soul.
“We’re always working,” Cas responds in between sucking kisses at the spot under Dean’s ear that he’s always liked.
He’s never felt less so in his life, half-naked on a vestment cabinet with his shirt rucked up and his dick hanging out, sweaty and flushed, but he only rolls his eyes a little and pulls Cas in by his tie to kiss him. He keeps a hand curled around Cas’ neck as he watches him pour out more holy oil to slick up his dick. He takes the time to run his thumb along Cas’ jaw, drag it through the stubble there, and press it against the bow of Cas’ bottom lip, watching his eyes, his lips, his hand on his own dick. Cas lets him touch for a moment and then nips at his thumb; Dean pulls it away, grinning.
In a flash, Dean pulled his gun from the holster hidden at his hip, flipped it and pointed it at the sheriff. The sheriff froze suddenly, looking from the gun to Dean, a confused look coming over his face.
Dean takes them to bars with large wooden patios, where the doors and windows are left open to the ocean breeze. They buy drinks served in fishbowls with tiny paper umbrellas in them. “Ugh, tastes nasty,” Dean says, but he insists on finishing it. Sam makes a face and abandons his, and then an hour later, abandons them, saying he wants to try a surfing class.
When he looks at the unhappiness on Cas’ face now, something painful twinges inside him. The dull ache that’s been inside himself these last few weeks is becoming overwhelming. He knows all of this is on him; he put that look there. And it’s an asshole move but Cas is standing so close to him, the way he always forgets he shouldn’t, and Dean has spent years trying not to be drawn to the bright blue of his eyes, the sharp line of his mouth. Somehow, tonight, the weight of all the lies he’s told cracks something inside him and he can’t help himself from closing the small distance to finally press a kiss to the downturned corner of Cas’ lips.
“You like that name?” Dean asked, breath hitching as he watched Sheriff Cas pull his cock out, thick and hard.
Dean grits his teeth. He's realizing now that Cas is going to make him say it. "Okay fine," he forces out. "I
He trails his hand across Dean’s chest toward his shoulder. And here is where the brand remains on Dean's soul, where Castiel had been forced to grip him, when Dean had fought him during his own rescue, full of grief and anger and confusion. Castiel had healed the outer scar, but the mark will remain a part of Dean forever.
Not all the angels are on board though and sometimes one goes rogue. Dean and Sam help Cas track down Kushiel, who’s started smiting humans. Kushiel seems to be attacking anyone who’s committed some kind of sin, no matter the severity, so the body count he’s racked up includes a couple of adulterers, three abusive boyfriends, and a kleptomaniac. They corner him in a warehouse on the outskirts of Omaha, knock him around a little, and trap him in a circle of holy fire while Sam slaps the handcuffs they found in the bunker on him. Kushiel doesn’t exactly go quietly, and lashes out at Cas while he’s trapped.
Sam only makes it a couple of miles before he starts to crack. "Dean," he says, sounding uncomfortable. "You know you can tell me anything, right?"
"Something you'll like,” Dean says, and stirs the pot of bubbling gumbo gently. “Get home soon.”
Dean looks at the messages for a second, makes a face, and then closes the screen so he won't be tempted to check for a response. He sees Sam eyeing him and ducks back into the car. He needs a fucking drink.
“Jesus,” Dean curses as Cas’ dick drags against his prostate on every withdrawal, his orgasm building back in him. It's almost not fair the way Cas doesn't break a sweat holding him up, fucking him deep like this, with his angelic grace helping him, but Dean is shaking apart from it.
Dean moans into Cas’ mouth and lets Cas maneuver him back down onto the bed and roll him over onto his stomach. He pillows his head on his crossed arms and feels his toes curl as Cas sucks wet kisses into the base of his spine. Cas makes his way lower and lower as he palms Dean's ass possessively and Dean huffs out a breath in anticipation. What he doesn’t expect is for Cas to spread his cheeks and
“You were once chosen by God, Castiel and now you lie with filth. I can
Dean frowns over at him at the non sequitur. "What are you talking about?"
That night, Dean finds Cas in the Dean-Cave, slumped in an armchair watching a rerun of Maury. His heart does something embarrassing in his chest at the sight. Dean has been making progress in getting Cas to break out of his full-suit getup while he's in the bunker and now he's wearing a pair of Dean's pajama pants with little burgers on them and a worn black t-shirt that Dean wants to feel under his fingers.
Cas tilted his head. “You’re not tied u—”
“I’m going to go slow,” Cas says behind him, and Dean rolls his eyes even though Cas can't see him.
“You,” he said finally, “You, Dean.”
“Shut up! You’re just trying to twist things, this is still all your fault”—
“What? Not going to mock me like I mocked you?” Dean questioned and Cas shook his head with a smile.
“Of course,” Dean mouthed grouchily, pulling up to the closest hotel he could find. The three men got out of the car and Sam checked them in as Cas and Dean remained outside by the car. Cas had begun to walk inside with Sam when Dean pulled him back.
He spent the day doing the same as the day before. He watched movies, drunkenly texted Sam, who informed him it would be at least another two days before he came home. When he couldn’t handle the day drinking any longer, he wandered back into the library of the bunker with his laptop and sat down, hoping to find a case, but the world was quiet. The regular day-to-day politics continued, but no matter how hard he looked, no one was reporting on anything particularly weird. He fell asleep in his chair, slumped over the computer.
“You know, Cas, I’m not good at just saying it, like you are, I’m not good with words, I’m not good at speaking my mind or talking about how I feel. That has always been something I have buried because that’s what I was taught. I never got to be a kid, I always had to take care of Sam, and to Dad...well, to Dad, talking about how you felt was a weakness. Being sad was a weakness. Allowing yourself to feel anything other than anger and revenge was a weakness.”
“You’re the one who made them this way,” Dean reminded her and she shrugged.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas spoke finally, breaking the silence and his stubborn stance on the situation. He believed cooperation was better than bickering, even if he was tired of being manipulated. He knew there was a bigger picture here.
“Not if I can stop it,” Cas mumbled.
“Yeah,” Dean spoke, “You.”
“For science!” Henry explained enthusiastically.
“What? Really?” Dean said, perking up.
“You should try to rest,” Cas suggested, “Sam is asleep. It’s been a long day. I will try to think of some solutions while you rest.”
“Yeah, which apparently they already tried doing that and curing the sick but they have no idea what they are dealing with.”
“Sam, I can’t even look at the guy, I don’t know how you think I can handle talking to him about it.”
“You’re wrong about Dean and I,” Amara spoke suddenly, “We are bonded, in a way not even you can break. He’s strong, for now, but a day will come when Dean Winchester turns away from you and walks toward me.”
“Alright, well, I’ll stand up,” Cas offered.
“Dean…”
“Still a few of them, but with proper police force they can be contained.” Cas answered.
“What?” Cas snapped in disbelief.
“Maybe he’s right,” Dean said, taking another swig of his beer.
“You pinned the angels against each other—you made it look like it was Cas’s fault that they fell,” Dean recalled defensively.
“Me too,” Cas agreed, “If it means you’ll feel better.”
“It was,” Cas reassured, “for me, at least. The other angels seemed to enjoy it. It was a lot more brutal than what it was made out to be.”
“Well, for me, too, but mainly for you. Your ‘profound bond’—or whatever.”
"No," Cas admitted, "Dean, she said something that made me question things. She informed me that I was wrong - that apparently I do have some kind of soul, and that she can feel it."
“Where are you now?” Dean questioned.
Dean remained silent; the words coming out of the angel’s mouth were painful to him for some reason. There was a sadness in Castiel’s eyes that Dean hated to look at. Dean felt guilty over everything—it was true, and it had always been this way. Stock market crashes? Dean’s fault. Gas prices go up? Dean’s fault. Trying to save the world? Dean’s fault.
“Okay,” Dean agreed with a nod, “Just, Cas, don’t run off anywhere while we are asleep and not tell us, okay?”
“Answer my question.”
“Incredible how you can turn his attention away from me like that,” Amara whispered, approaching the angel. “That’s not easy to accomplish, considering our bond.”
Moments later, the car drove by a sign that informed them that they were in the town where Metatron had been spotted. It was bigger than a town, really, but lacked the hustle of a city. Dean turned to poke his brother who was still snoozing in the back seat.
“Dean will always choose the light over the darkness,” Cas snapped defensively, “You don’t know him like I do—you can’t see his soul as more than just something to temp or devour. There’s a light in him that I saw the moment I rescued him from hell. Him and his brother—despite everything—are not easily corrupted. You may think you know Dean Winchester, but you are wrong. He may have been the key to unleashing the darkness, but do not think for one moment that he is anything but light and that he is not strong enough to break free of your seduction.”
“Don’t come any closer,” Cas warned, parading his angel blade that he had recovered from the table. Amara smiled.
“What? No, I don’t want to leave you here by yourself.”
“Dean…what happened?” Sam questioned carefully. Dean took a few moments to gather his thoughts.
“How big is this town?” Cas questioned.
“Yeah, well, guess even the good doc can’t hide form the darkness,” Dean spoke. "I'm guessing things with Amara didn't go over so well with you?"
“We’ll see about that,” Amara claimed, “We’ll meet again.”
This time, the road trip was not quiet. Sam was hurling information at Dean, and Dean would listen and respond while Cas would chime in occasionally. Instantly, the three were a team again, and Dean and Cas pushed aside previous thoughts for the sake of their new mission, a feat Dean was not foreign to.
"Angel like me?" Cas questioned, his eyes squinting.
Cas was hesitant as the man motioned for him to come closer to him, but the gun aimed at Dean was threatening. Cas moved slowly, his eyes fixated on the man’s. Suddenly, the same soulless blonde woman from before returned from behind and knocked Castiel unconscious once again. The two stood over their bodies with wide eyes and adrenaline, their soulless nature curious and menacing.
“Where’s Sam?” Castiel asked, looking around.
“And we will be here to fight for it with you, Dean,” Sam confirmed, looking at his brother with a small smile. Dean nodded at him before looking at the angel, who bowed his head shyly. They saved a total of two hundred and eighty seven people that day.
“I’m not admitting anything,” Dean snapped, “I just…I don’t know. There’s something there with Cas—something wonderfully awkward and I can’t explain it, but it’s there. I don’t know where it’s going or if it’s even going, but I admit—things between him and I…well, maybe I think of him as a little more than just a friend.”
“How are you feeling?” Dean asked Cas, who sat at one of the tables in the library of the bunker.
“We will find him,” Cas reassured as Dean pulled away. He stood across from Cas, tears on his cheeks. Dean saw that there was tears in Cas’s eyes as well. Cas understood, and he would do anything to make it better.
“Space?” Dean questioned.
“Yeah, yeah, go have fun, lover boy,” Dean replied jokingly. Sam smirked and waved his brother goodbye, climbing the stairs to the outside. When the door creaked shut, Dean was alone. Alone for the first time in a long time. He sat at the table, his legs elevated and a beer in his hand. It grew warm against his palm as the minutes crept past in peace and loneliness. He didn’t know how to feel, or what to feel. It was his time to rest, to reflect, but he was a man who had never stopped moving. He sighed heavily and abandoned his position at the table.
“The man who attacked you—he’s a doctor, I think. He had a tag. Henry. He said his name was James Henry. I think he was one of the doctors sent here to diagnose the outbreak.”
“That’s...a lot to take in, in such a short amount of time.”
“We saved some people—we fixed some things…I worked things out with Cas.”
“I trust her,” Sam announced.
“What? Are you serious?” Dean blurted out.
“Sam’s right—mass panic isn’t needed if we can stop it, and we will stop it. Besides—there’s no way to prepare for it. This is something only we can do.”
“It’s all my fault, Cas,” Dean whispered uneasily, bowing his head. The tears had began to flow, slowly and singularly but they were still there, “I screw up everything I touch. I can’t do anything right without somehow making five new wrongs.”
Cas removed the hand that had been over Dean’s. Dean didn’t move, but he didn’t like the sudden coldness he felt when Cas moved away and he didn’t expect what would happen next. It was a simple gesture, light and soft, but it was full of so much meaning and built up emotion. Cas kneeled down next to the man, his eyes soft and tender. His face was close—Dean was forced to look up at him as he moved closer. Dean’s sad expression shifted to curiosity and uncertainty, unsure of what Cas was doing. Cas moved slowly, uncertain himself of what he was doing. Dean’s eyes flickered down to Cas’s lips, captivated by their closeness and slight part. He was torn between staring at them and staring at Cas’s gentle blue eyes, full of engrossing tranquility. Cas’s attention was undivided. They were focused completely on the sorrowful green in front of him. When Cas’s nose finally met Dean’s, Cas paused for a moment, his eyes falling shut as he tilted his chin. Dean breathed heavily, his body stiffening as Cas pressed his faintly parted lips against Dean’s. Dean had been kissed several times, often when he wasn’t expecting it to happen, but nothing like this. The previous ones were passionate, full of desire and lust, but this was different. It was awkward, but gentle and delicate—a way of saying “I care about you, in more ways than you know.” It was innocent and subtle, not heated or sloppy. It was barely a kiss—their lips hardly moved, but it was enough to make Dean question everything, and for everything to become so clear.
At some point during the drive, Dean pulled over and Sam switched spots with Cas. Sam wanted to sleep, and since Dean wasn’t tired and Cas didn’t sleep, he agreed that Sam should get some rest. They continued their drive with Cas in the passenger seat, Sam stretched out in the back, and Dean driving. The ride was silent for nearly half an hour, Sam’s gentle sounds of slumber echoing from the backseat. Cas stared out the window. Dean stared out on the dark highway.
“No, I guess not,” Dean chuckled, his eyes wandering around to the small mess the angel had made of his brother’s room. “We really need to get you your own room.”
“Really?” Castiel said hopefully.
“You don’t have to say anything,” Dean reassured him, “Just…in the future when you need to talk, talk.”
“I don’t think things through, Cas. I trusted Crowley over my own brother and you. I should have told Sam I was wrong when I let Gadreel in— begged for his forgiveness— but I was so stubborn. Then maybe…you and him would have been around to prevent me from doing something stupid. Prevent me from going to Crowley. Prevent me from visiting Cain and taking on the mark. We could have found another way to take on Abaddon—hell, cut her up, scatter her across the whole universe for all I care…then maybe…maybe Jenna would still be alive”—
“Enough with your games, Metatron!” Cas yelled, stepping forward. Dean pulled him back, placing a hand on his shoulder.
“I think I may have found something on Metatron,” Sam declared the next day over supper, his eyes wide with discovery. Dean sat with his legs propped up on another chair, eating leftover tacos from the night before. He shifted in his seat upon hearing this information, sitting up and leaning over the table to listen to his brother.
“Yeah,” Dean said with a smile, “It...made me think things over. Made me realize that maybe everything has been different than what I was seeing. Hell, I didn’t think I was capable of being loved. I thought I was everything you said I wasn’t. You, an angel, telling me I deserve to be saved, telling me I’m not a monster? It’s a relief.”
“Of course…what is it?” Cas’s curiosity peaked and he leaned over the table, his own hands woven together like his companion’s, except Dean’s didn’t stay in that position for too much longer. He slowly untangled his fingers, leaving one hand spread out on the table, the other moving slowly, finally resting on top of Cas’s hands. Cas tensed up a bit, glancing down at the soft touch and then back up at Dean, his head tilting slightly, unsure of what to make of such a simple yet tender gesture coming from a man who rarely showed such emotion. He moved his right hand away from the grasp, leaving his left fully exposed to Dean’s touch. Dean cupped his hand on top Cas’s, thumbing at Cas’s knuckles lightly, his eyes fixated on their hands as Cas watched Dean’s expressions. Dean wore a shy smile. Thought collected on his brow. Castiel waited for what Dean had to say.
“I hurt my leg earlier today”—one person spoke
“Cas!” he yelled upon seeing him, running up to greet the angel. He cradled him in his hands, pulling him up onto his lap. His grace was already healing him rapidly—he hadn’t been out for long. He was foggy, but he woke up upon being moved, his head heavy and his vision blurred.
“Don’t move,” the man demanded. Dean could see the fear in Cas’s eyes. Dean sat still, but the man turned the gun suddenly and slammed it against Dean’s head, knocking him out. He pointed it at Castiel, who raised his hands as a response.
"It's true," Amara reassured.
“What?” Sam said quickly, taking offense, “And you didn’t tell me?”
“Cas, wait,” Dean spoke with a hint of desperation in his voice, abandoning his warm beer to rise to his feet. Cas was turned away, Dean staring at his back while standing next to the table. Cas took a breath and turned slowly, taking a step down from the doorway and into the kitchen.
“We understand,” the little girl spoke, “We won’t tell.”
“To grieve,” Cas elaborated, not moving.
“Okay.”
“I know,” Amara whispered, “Your loyalty is clear. It doesn’t matter; despite what you believe what I have said is true. There’s no stopping it—I have big plans and Dean Winchester is mine.”
“Dean—I,” Cas began, shaking his head. He was unsure of what to say or do. He was secretly hoping this conversation would never happen, or that Dean wouldn’t notice his more-than-usual oddness.
“That doesn’t have to be a bad thing,” Dean reassured him.
“This is a kind gesture,” Cas spoke, “And I appreciate it and will accept it, but I have to be honest, Dean.”
He stumbled to get up but eventually made it to his feet. He tilted his chin upwards, staring at the dimmed lights. The light returned to the bulbs in a quick flash. Dean squinted grumpily. The buzzing of electrical disturbance subsided. The quiet threatened him again, except this time, it was interrupted by a voice, clear as day.
“You don’t have to justify your decision to me,” Cas informed, “I’ll go with you no matter where you need me to go.”
“I’m glad,” Castiel said in satisfaction. Dean eyed Castiel’s hand, preparing his words carefully.
Nothing was on his mind, not particularly. He hunched over the table, thumb on his chin and finger on his lip. He leaned on his arm, the other holding a beer that had long gone warm. His eyes were unfixed.
“What about the soulless people? We can’t just tell them to lock them up if they haven’t committed a crime,” Dean pointed out.
“He’s clever.”
Dean had saved the people he had been accompanying. Sam frantically asked him where Castiel was, and when Dean informed him that they had spotted Amara and she had aged, Sam became worried.
“Of course,” Cas answered, lifting himself up into a sitting position next to Dean. He held his head, which was still throbbing. His eyes met Dean’s before darting to the side, realizing that there was a short, round man standing behind Dean with a gun lifted to his head.
“Yep,” and the two headed up the stairs and out the bunker.
Amara smiled slightly and approached the angel. Cas stiffened, unsure of what she was doing. She placed an unusually gentle hand on the angel’s chest, staring at it for a few moments before tilting her head up to look at him.
“Don’t say that.”
“And?” Dean asked, his heart skipping a beat at the word /deal/.
“Well, you were pretty messed up, Dean,” Cas defended him, “But you still found your way back enough to stop yourself form doing anything worse, and your prolonged guilt over this incident makes you more compassionate than any angel and the majority of mankind.”
“Well, I’ll meet you at the hotel. I’ll go ahead and pack the car up so we can leave as soon as you get there.”
“Cas, I have to tell you something.” Dean spoke, shifting in his seat.
“Dean”—
“Is everything okay?” Sam questioned, his real thoughts finally surfacing.
“I don’t know, Sam,” Dean answered, “I know that Cas is the bestest friend I have ever had, and I want him here. I want him back here with me. I want him to know that he changed me, too. I want to have time to figure things out, now that I know how he feels and now that we can. We know that someone else isn’t writing our story.”
"I thought so at first, too, but like I said...this time, it's different. Perhaps Amara is right. It makes sense to me, Dean, but I guess I just never thought about it."
“Look, Dean, I know you don’t like talking about your feelings, and maybe I’m the wrong person to be talking about this with, but how do you think Cas feels about you?” Sam asked softly, trying not to offend his brother.
“Like how I nearly killed you?” Dean finally uttered what was on his mind, his words full of escaping emotions. Cas could sense the guilt and the pain in his voice. Cas shook his head.
“No, Cas”—Dean objected, looking up at the angel.
“I...haven’t even really had time to explain it to myself, honestly,” Dean started, “Yet at the same time, it’s there, constantly, at the back of my head, those last few moments with Cas.”
“I haven’t been able to do that in a long time, Dean,” Cas reminded him, “Guess I’m useless.”
“Because…” Cas paused, pondering. “We are family, too.”
“Yeah, I agree,” Dean spoke casually, “What are you in to?”
“Just trying to save some time—if Metatron shows back up where he was then you two will be there. Amber also has some information on The Darkness.”
“I don’t know, basement maybe? Can you try zapping out and getting help?” Dean asked hopefully and Cas shook his head.
“I understand,” Dean lifted himself up out of his chair and Cas mimicked him. Cas stood as Dean circled around the table and opened his arms, wrapping them around Cas, one hand on the back of his head and one around his waist. Cas leaned into Dean, tucking himself into Dean’s collar bone. Cas closed his eyes in content and Dean couldn’t help but smile. The hug held for only a few seconds before Dean pulled away and took a few steps back, patting Cas on his shoulder.
“Dean, they’re not only terrified. They’re working together.”
“We will get out of it, Dean, we always do,” Cas reassured.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas whispered suddenly, looking away. He sat back now, staring off, distant from the man he had just kissed, “That was uncalled for.”
“There’s something I should tell you,” Castiel began and Dean’s heart dropped.
“I know, Sam, and I didn’t have time to react. He said it so quickly, and the next moment he was gone. He was gone, Sammy...he’s gone,” Dean choked, a guilty tear rolling down his cheek, “And everything has been nonstop since then. He’s not here to see us win. He doesn’t know that /we won/. He’s not here to celebrate, and it hurts. It hurts like hell, and worst of all? I can’t even tell him how /I/ feel.”
“Yeah, right before all the light of day is gone, but after the colors of the sunset have settled. Sammy and I, when we were younger we used to watch the sunset a lot and his favorite part was of course the colors, but I always liked the calmness that came with that dark blue.”
Dean informed Castiel of the situation as soon as he opened the driver’s door. Castiel was unhappy about Metatron’s escape, but he was eager to find out more about Amara and the darkness and help in any way he could. Back at the hotel, Dean shoved their belongings into the duffle bags and tossed them into the car. He was worked up and ready to get to the bottom of their problem, but Sam was taking longer than he had hoped. Dean paced the floor as Castiel sat, watching him.
“No,” Cas informed, “They’re gone, for now. Not sleeping, of course, they don’t need to do that, but they’re not around.”
“I thought you said he was being too aggressive”—
And now the darkness was coming.
“Dude, seriously? When we had Metatron and I was beating him up you literally knocked the whole door down when I wouldn’t open the door, and you weren’t at full power then, either. You’ve got this.”
Dean had learned a lot in the past few days.
“Home is not a box built on this Earth. Home, to me…is you. You and Sam, you are my home, and wherever life takes us, no matter where we are, as long as I am with the two of you, I am home.”
“Now…we’ve got work to do. Are you in?” Dean questioned softly, "Baby steps."
“Can you hear them? Are they nearby?” Dean whispered at the top of the staircase, as if the soulless people had super hearing.
“That’s no excuse.”
“Hey, welcome to the club. So will I,” Dean said with a shrug, “I don’t care if you are an angel or not, Cas, I just wanted you back, in any way, shape, or form.”
“Thank you,” Dean stopped pacing, halting in front of Castiel. Cas stared at him softly, wishing he could find a topic to talk about that would somehow ease Dean’s anxiety. Dean, on the other hand, began recalling his conversation with Metatron regarding Cas. He became curious, but he was afraid to ask any questions.
“I understand, Dean,” Cas spoke as Dean’s words trailed off, Dean struggling to find words careful yet suited enough to tell the man in front of him how he felt about him.
“Sam, no, okay, I just…I don’t know, I just really want him to get better,” he spoke truthfully, which it wasn’t a lie—Dean really did want Cas to get better, but what was really bothering him he didn’t want to talk about.
“Cas, cool down,” Dean whispered to him. Cas was taken back by Dean’s gentle touch. He nodded.
“Take them to safety,” Cas demanded, “I’ll handle her.”
“This has happened before,” Dean reminded him softly.
“For science?” Dean repeated with disbelief.
“I’ve been thinking about something, something that doesn’t make sense.”
“Me too,” Dean agreed.
“D-Dean,” Castiel stammered.
No ghosts.
“Uh, she said she won’t be able to meet us until morning,” Sam informed, looking at text messages exchanged between him and Amber. “So, hotel?”
“Emotions discussed?” Sam questioned. Dean nodded awkwardly.
"That's...not possible," Cas spoke.
“I believe in you, Cas,” Dean interrupted, “Like you believe in me.”
“You’re different,” Dean spoke, “Ever since the curse. Ever since…back with the Stynes…” his words trailed off and his eyes lowered, “You’ve been through a lot, man. Losing your grace, me kicking you out of here, and then the whole watching me take on the mark and the demon thing. Then…you try to save me, and I hurt you. I guess I never really thanked you for that, or apologized for what I did.”
Castiel appeared in the kitchen doorway. He loomed, and Dean didn’t notice him at first. Several moments passed in silence, Cas unsure of what to say or if he should even bother Dean. Dean noticed the silhouette in the shadow on the wall and casually sipped his warm beer, acting as if he had been doing that the entire time.
“There was a clarity in the anger, a clarity that reminded me of how tired I am of feeling used. I sometimes feel like that is my only purpose in life—to be used. Maybe I’m just naïve and too trusting of others. The angels used me as a soldier for their false word of god. Metatron used me for my grace. Hannah used me to get information on you two”—
It was during one of their escorts to the building when Dean saw her—Amara, now a young woman. It was ominous and instant—his attention suddenly adverted from Castiel and the small group of people they were with to her. Castiel noticed the falter.
“I know where Amara is,” Sam blurted out, grabbing Dean’s attention.
“Well, maybe we can get him back somehow,” Sam said hopefully, “We have time. We can figure it out.”
“Chuck said Cas rebelling was not part of the story, Dean,” Sam said, “If Cas did this because he loved you...Dean, that was real. That wasn’t Chuck writing.”
“I’m Dean,” Dean answered finally when the crowd began stirring, wishing to know their names, “Dean Winchester, and this is my brother Sam.”
“We captured Metatron”—Dean spoke, heading back in to the building, but Metatron was nowhere to be found. “Dammit!”
“Sam, I didn’t know,” Dean replied softly, “I didn’t know until Billie was after us, pounding on the door, and nearly killed me. We were trapped, Sam. She had gotten us, we were both going to die, and that’s when he told me about the deal. He said it was the only way out for me, that he had made a deal with The Empty that in his happiest moment, The Empty would come for him and drag him back.”
“He’s with Eileen. I don’t know if Jack caught you up…”
“What?”
“Dean, he does all of this because he cares about you,” Sam informed Dean with ease, as if it was something the whole world knew and understood. Dean glanced at him with confusion, as if he didn’t know this obvious fact, “He, now more than ever, knows what it is like to be under the influence of something terrible and lose control. What happened…was awful, but that’s behind us. Cas doesn’t hold grudges, and you don’t have to let this eat at you for the rest of your life. Have you talked to him about what happened?”
“Yeah, and I don’t get why he hasn’t hauled ass away from us.”
“Well, sure, why not, of course we get captured by a bunch of soulless psychopathic Doctor House’s,” Dean spoke in disbelief. The man frowned.
“We’re going on a hunch given to you by a girl you met one time years ago?” Dean objected.
“Sorry I woke you up,” Dean quickly apologized.
“Do you think we should call Cas and see if he needs us to pick anything up for him?” Sam thought aloud, breaking the silence.
The next morning, Sam was the one to make the call to the police. The brothers had gotten a few hours rest as Cas watched over the people. The town lacked a police station because it was so small—the closest one was ten minutes away in the city that was untouched by the disease. The people they saved stuck to their story—a rapid mad cow-like sickness, the few doctors who had not been sucked soulless and have survived confirming to the police their lie. The remaining townspeople agreed to test to ensure that they were not infected, even though they all knew it was out of their systems. The few murders that had taken place during the whole incident were blamed on the soulless people, including the murders of the doctors who had kidnapped Dean and Castiel. Local reporters showed up and all fell for the story. Sam, Dean, and Castiel drove home in the impala, all tired and ready to sleep for days.
His hard-on ached in his pants but Cas took mercy. Cas’ arm around his hip held him tight as his other hand made quick work of Dean’s belt buckle and fly. Dean moaned when Cas’ hand wrapped around his dick and he leaned his forehead into the crook of Cas’ neck, the collar of the shirt he'd made Cas wear scratchy against his skin. Cas slicked the precome down the length of his dick as he stroked him. Dean panted into Cas’ neck and Cas turned to drop a kiss onto his cheek, the gesture pulling at something inside Dean. He was still bound, wrists tied up, but Cas had him, a solid support for him to lean on.
“Glad we had this talk,” he says, grabbing his salad and getting the hell out of there.
Cas ends up rolling back in two days later. Dean's in the garage cleaning out Baby's battery terminals when the bay door cranks open and Cas' truck pulls up. Dean's been working in the garage a lot the last couple of days, not because he knew that this is the first place Cas would come in from. Definitely not for that reason.
Cas finds him in the sacristy of the church they're staking out for a ghoul sighting tonight. He's digging through the drawers of the vestment cabinet with his back to the door when Cas sneaks up on him with: "Dean."
, he thinks, and doesn’t say.
Suddenly, there was a hand in his hair, pulling his head back to bare his throat. A gasp escaped Dean, his eyes sliding closed half in pleasure, half in pain. He was powerless, safe in surrender, and as that thought went through his mind, his erection throbbed against the seam of his pants. He waited for the expected sound of a belt buckle opening, but instead startled when something cold and metallic pressed against his half-opened lips. He opened his eyes to see the silver glint of his own gun.
