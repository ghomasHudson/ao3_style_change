His arrival in the waiting room was only minimally awkward, given the circumstances. Strange had apparently returned to the Sanctum arm in arm with their new ally, Carol, which was a minor disappointment given the number of questions Tony had for her, or really any glowing woman. Yet Wilson seemed genuinely relieved to see him back on his feet, and Tony was doubly pleased to receive just the usual wary Pym civility from Hope and sunny welcome from Scott.
Peter had wrapped his arms around Tony, as if scared to let go. Yet the kid was the first to pull away. His eyes were full with unshed tears, but he just nodded, jaw resolute. “I’ll do my best to make you proud, Mr Stark.”
Yet she didn’t leave. “God, you’re such an asshole,” she muttered. “But fine, have it your way. If I’m not your nurse, then I guess I’m just your friend.” And a series of odd rustling noises followed.
Steve tapped his freshly shaved chin in response. “Strategic recon.” His smug grin grew wider. “Turns out it’s considered standard bathroom issue here.”
“I don’t want to?” he finished, mortified at his lack of a better answer. Yet Tony didn’t seem to notice; the other man let out a slow breath, sitting down slowly. Only then did Steve notice the fresh lines of tension etched into Tony’s face. “Are
As a plan, Tony thought it was good, made sense, was worth doing… except maybe for the utter overwhelming impossibility of them ever figuring out where in the universe Thanos had sent the Soul Stone so everything they tried was doomed and pointless and stupid because there was no hope left, he had failed, he had failed them all and Pepper was dead and Peter was dead and he hadn’t seen it coming, he should have seen it coming, he should have done more while there was still a chance because no matter where he looked for hope there was nothing now but a dead man’s laughter in his head.
It turned out Tony was right about the magic. The Doctor was literally a wizard, which turned out to be both a thing and a thing Earth had secretly depended on for centuries to avert total apocalyptic catastrophe, which was just great news. He also claimed to be the cult-appointed guardian of the Time Stone. Since Thor had brought the Space Stone and Vision held the Mind Stone, that meant three of the most powerful cosmic forces in the universe were now gathered in a room that smelled of nervous armpit.
“The names,” Steve whispered. “At first it was just on the bad days, but now I think about them all the time. Except if there’s a fight, but… I need them. So much that I don’t know if I can stop. I’m not even sure I want to.” He blew out a shocked breath, turned his face away from his own words. “That’s… that’s awful. Right?”
Tony had missed another public alert while he was out, but thankfully this time the approaching spaceship was a friendly, sent by the very alive but currently absent Thor. The Valkyrie had informed them of Loki’s death, then explained how Thor had taken a detour but was soon expected to return. The new ship’s crew were a group known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, renowned heroes who had already once thwarted Thanos’ plans to obtain the Power Stone. They’d landed their ship in Wakanda and were ready to assist in the Mind Stone’s defense.
“Bruce called Steve, who called me,” Rhodey said. “Wanda and Vision were in Scotland, the others got them out but not before Vision was injured. Some sort of energy disruption, he couldn’t heal himself, took him out of the game. He suggested destroying the Mind Stone right away, but Steve said no, got us to Wakanda instead. Shuri tried rewiring Vision so we could take out the Stone without killing him, but next thing an alien army was on our doorstep. Thor showed up with some friends, helped even the score but it was still heading south. In the end, we ran out of time.”
Remarkably, Nebula did not flinch, but only raised her chin higher. “Me,” she said, hatred and satisfaction mingling in her voice. And then she reached down, twisted the ax and dragged it from his chest. Thanos howled once in outrage, then again in animal despair, but all his renowned strength, all of his foul will could not delay the inevitable rush of life from his body. They watched, silent, as the Mad Titan took one last tormented breath, then fell still.
Without saying a word, Tony took Steve’s hand and pressed it to his lips, another of his small, ineffable gestures, but just like that, Steve’s day got better.
“Okay, I get it, I believe you,” Steve said desperately. “But please, Tony, just… can you talk to me?” Tony shook his head, pressing his lips together, but this time Steve was determined to wait out the silence; eventually the other man sighed in defeat.
A soft splashing alerted him that someone was nearby, but the cracks would spread if he moved, and so Steve sat still, eyes fixed wide on nothing. The someone knelt beside him, touched his shoulder, interrupted his view. Nebula, face stern, eyes kind. Had he never noticed?
“Nat,” he said, voice crisp with battlefield urgency. “Get rid of him.” She was staring at Tony, her face draining of color, but then the former assassin nodded sharply and left the room, whispering to the nurse as they went.
The faceless man sighed. “To earn the power of the Soul Stone, you must give up the life of someone you love.”
Tony found the trail down to the water and followed it without much difficulty, this being their eighth day at this particular location. As he approached their usual barrel-filling rock, he saw the three large containers sitting empty nearby, but no sign of Steve. He frowned, looking around, trying to suppress the usual stab of nerves that signaled something was not as expected, then closed his eyes and tried to listen to the forest around him. Steve’s trick, from his war days. Granted, it was slightly harder to discern the relative normality of sounds in an alien ecosystem, but the surrounding wildlife were busily chattering away in their strange knocking version of birdsong, and it was silence that Steve had always warned him about. So, there was probably not a space bear, about to eat him.
Tony found his way back to full cognition eventually, still twitching from aftermath. Opening his eyes, he saw above him a serene, not-at-all-smug Steve wiping him down with a fresh cloth. Tony lay quiet, unable to imagine a benefit to ever moving again, and watched the other man care for him. There was a contented curve to Steve’s lips that Tony approved of, even if it meant Steve had won. Tony might even let him win again, for the scientific benefit of, uhhh… astronomy. Five stars? Galaxies. When he was done, Steve tossed the cloth aside and began studying Tony’s body again, but this time he didn’t keep his distance; instead he reached out to brush his fingers along the myriad scars visible on Tony’s skin.
By the time Rhodey pulled him aside and asked if he was okay, it took everything left in Tony not to scream. That made it seven since breakfast alone; seven individual people stopping to check up on him, as if they all didn’t have something better to do, more important, more useful. But once more he swallowed his frustration, nodded, smiled. He even summoned up a joke and a wink, enough to send his best friend away comforted.
Tony tossed the nearest journalist a flamboyant wink. “Wow, cancel everything, the day’s ruined…” As he’d hoped, his joking broke the room’s focus, and as low rumbles of conversation broke out amongst the crowd, he and T’Challa were able to make a clean escape.
It was now coming up to four o’clock in the afternoon, so when Wong came upstairs to cover his post, Steve was eager to find food. What he found, to his renewed irritation, was Stark sitting with the Doctor, both huddled over a large cauldron that was no doubt doing something magical and obscure. Steve stopped in the doorway, unnoticed, trying to school his breathing back towards calm.
Hurriedly, Tony ran the calculations. “If everything goes well today, I can maybe get away at the weekend,” he said.
“Nah, we’ll grab something on the way,” Tony said quickly, Ty’s impatience like a fierce wind at his back. “I’ll be back first thing in the morning, then we’ll catch up on the road, Bruce, yeah?”
He glanced over at Steve; the other man was sitting frozen, his expression unreadable. Tony wrenched his gaze away. “I asked him to hurt me,” Tony said. “Things got fucked up, but that’s how it started. Better you know now.” His words hung in the air between them; Tony tried to focus on the blurring view out the window, the smooth leather of the steering wheel.
Tony felt his throat tighten. Probably he should opt for caution here, should wait until they were both in a better place to deal with this, but… truth was truth. “Siberia,” he said.
Somewhere, he could hear a woman talking. She sounded worried, so Steve forced his eyes to open. Tony had backed away until he was standing by the wall. As far away as he could get. A dark-haired woman had her hand on his arm, and Tony was shaking his head.
“It would have been murder either way,” Tony said softly. Which was a truth that only time and distance had allowed him to admit. It had felt bad, back then, to lose; he knew now he would never have forgiven himself if he’d won. Barnes just nodded, as if he understood Tony’s regret.
But Steve made no further move. “Actually, Tony, you should know… I was about to ask a different question,” he said, voice brutal in its restraint, because there were
“And gee, you got me a whole extra day to go swoosh-swoosh on the merry-go-round,” Tony cooed. “Thanks, Captain Au-pair-ica.” Which was probably the weakest joke he’d ever made in his life and made them both pull appropriately appalled faces, but at least it also made Steve laugh.
he thought, darkly jubilant. And with one smooth step he had slipped into Tiberius’ arms, was pressing apologies against his fiancé’s lips.
In a burst of horror, Tony understood; he fired his repulsors recklessly, enough to melt the concrete’s grip, and he
He wants to joke. Make them smile. Thanos dropped a moon on me, he wants to say. I went into space and everyone I met was stupid. The wizard had a magic cape, and it died when he died. Died for me. They were dead now. He was dead.
From his seat beside Tony, Rhodey cleared his throat. “No, it’s not.” His voice was rough with emotion, and when Tony glanced at him, his best friend’s smile held such delight that it almost hurt to witness. Rhodey gripped his shoulder then stood, gesturing for Steve to take his place on the couch. Steve did just that, his usual grace slightly impeded by Tony having fastened himself to the other man’s body like some deranged limpet. Tony was vaguely aware his behavior was embarrassing bordering on pathetic, but he still couldn’t care about anything but staying near Steve. Preferably
By unanimous private consensus, the launch ceremony was itself just a formality, and the space network had been secretly up and running for the past week. Better to avoid embarrassing mishaps when broadcasting live on global TV, Tony knew. The public needed to feel secure in their planetary defenses almost as much as the defenses had to actually be secure. It was the same reason they had built a showy central headquarters in San Francisco, despite the fact the system’s diffused network could be accessed from anywhere as needed. The pageantry had its own function.
Peter closed the door and sat shyly on the floor beside him. “Sorry if you wanted to be alone, but Aunt May said the Captain is really sick,” he said words spilling out all in a rush. “She said he’s comfortable, but they all look so sad. It’s… it’s bad, right?”
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said, his face stiff. He forced a nod. Smiled. “Well, looks like duty calls, folks. Enjoy the buffet, and hey, let’s make it a free bar, shall we? Raise a glass or three, my treat.” He turned away from the now-jubilant crowd and followed T’Challa safely out of sight.
It was really no big deal. “Pencils in the bag,” Tony answered, and flopped down on the nice tickle-free blanket, happy to stay out of the way. It looked like tomorrow in the lab would need to be a long day, but he figured if he sorted his thoughts now, he could at least get his shit done as efficiently as possible. And he did spend a good chunk of time mentally reviewing his task list, but gradually, he felt his awareness slow to match the deep peace of the land around them. In return, a hazy sleepy contentment seeped throughout his body and set him floating away from all of his worries.
Red Skull shook his head. “You have traveled far in these difficult times so I will not waste words on ceremony, but please understand, the Soul Stone has no keeper; indeed, it can have no true master. Alone among the Infinity Stones, it will lend its power only for a time, and always for a price. Death, as you have seen, is a common path to its release.” He gestured to their surroundings. “To here, then, the Stone always returns; here it dwells, until the next seeker comes. The Stone keeps me here, but not as a valued companion. I am merely a convenient servant, guiding others along a path I myself cannot follow.” He paused. “Any further questions?”
“A-all of them?” Further into the ship, the raccoon was staring up at Nebula, its ears and tail drooping towards heartbreak. The android gave a reluctant nod and the small creature backed away with a sob, holding out its paws in such a human gesture that Tony could not see it as an animal anymore; just another broken heart.
He was going to die. He was really going to die, right here in this awful plastic room. He sucked in a ragged breath, some sort of tube under his nose, but his mind was reeling, halfway convinced his airway was closing in again-
“I killed Thanos,” Nebula announced; apparently she had been listening. She turned now, her emotions back under control. “At the moment of his death, the Soul Stone vanished. We believe Thanos sent it away to keep it beyond our reach. We seek a way to track it.”
Panic erupted within him, Tony’s mind seeking refuge in memories of the man he’d always known, endless images of Steve, fighting, laughing, arguing, always effortlessly strong and sure. But to his horror, his memories had
When he was alone, when it was safe, Tony sank to the floor, and he cried. Violent sobs erupted in great heaving gasps, the cries of a child wretched with rage because it wasn’t fair, it wasn’t
Tony was full of complaints, had suggested the android open a portal to the top of the mountain so they could walk down instead. Nebula had refused, saying it wouldn’t feel right. That there was something waiting. Something… holy. That revelation had shut Tony up. Mostly from the existential crisis it had provoked. Finding someone or something had cut a trail around the mountainside hadn’t helped.
Steve pushed aside the oxygen mask and grabbed Tony’s bare hand, clutching it to his lips in a kiss that felt like a prayer.
He looked up; she was in focus but everything else was blurring, melting. “I’m sorry,” he gasped. “I don’t…”
. When Starlord comes round, he thinks Steve is trying to steal his ship and attacks. Steve lets him take the Power Stone and watches him leave, sick with hope that this future might go better for someone, somewhere.
As the dawn light crept in, lifting them out of anonymous shadow, Steve finally made love to the other man. Once more, neither spoke a word. In the silence, their union felt solemn. Holy, almost. Steve truly tried to savor it, tried to slow down and memorize every new expression etched on Tony’s face, but the more he reveled in the moment, the quicker his pleasure surged. An inevitable momentum took him over, sending first Tony then himself plunging over the edge into a bliss that obliterated all that came before.
“Are you sure?” she asked instead, and now Tony was staring at her, at the loving acceptance stitched across her face, a patchwork of worry and courage, and pain, and trust, and…
But the super-soldier was studying him. “Tony, are you sure you’re up to this?” he asked, still gentle yet his doubt so clear.
-” Steve could have happily stayed there in Tony’s arms forever, but he sat up, struggling to make sense of the other man’s stammering words.
The trembling increased; Thanos looked up, and Steve realized with a sick jolt that the Mad Titan was
“I’m sorry about your friend,” Carol said; she sounded sincere, “but Thanos is still a threat. Fury said you have a second team guarding the Mind Stone. We need to warn them, they may be his next target.”
“Guh, welcome to Earth! Lousy stinkin’ joke of a planet,” the raccoon griped. They all ignored him, having long learned not to pay his grumblings much heed.
a quick learner,” Ty drawled; an avalanche of humiliation slammed into Tony, memories of long hours spent in front of the mirror, Ty endlessly scrutinizing his every expression, correcting his face, his words, his gestures.
Steve didn’t know how to explain his tears. He just knew that he was okay, that he was indescribably better than okay, that for the first time in years it felt like he’d found somewhere he belonged, and so he just closed his eyes and let himself be held. As the morning light seeped in around them, he heard Tony’s breath soften and slow towards sleep; heart shyly buoyant, Steve let his own exhaustion pull him under, smiling as he went.
Enough. Steve held out his right hand to Tony who accepted it instantly; by mutual unspoken agreement they turned their backs on the laughing Titan and walked away without a second glance.
Short seconds later, a small bundle landed neatly at Peter’s feet, the new armor unfolding to encase the stunned teenager in the best protection Tony could manage. While Peter danced around in glee, nearly incoherent with excitement, May clutched painfully at Tony’s arm. “Wow, Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!” the kid crowed.
Steve buried his face into Tony’s shoulder, probably failing to hide his smile. “Did you sleep?” he asked. “Because it only counts as morning if you sleep.” Which was supposed to be a joke, but when Steve looked up and saw Tony’s expression, his words trailed away in a sudden fog of foreboding, because Tony looked… wrong.
“I have a… There’s something I wanted to ask you for years, but it was never the right time… do you think… I mean, can now be good?” His voice sounded so wistful and lonely; through the haze Steve wondered what the question might be.
? With the situation on Titan so fragile, Steve still clinging desperately to him every night as they slept, and Tony halfway losing the ability to breathe whenever the super-soldier left his sight? This was no time for… complications. Setting aside the minor issue that was Steve’s total lack of interest in men who weren’t Barnes, once this future was erased, they’d both forget everything anyway. And it felt worse somehow, knowing that they’d both forget. If in some universe they ever did… get complicated… he thought it would deserve to be remembered. At least, Tony would want to remember. Steve probably just wanted to get back to Barnes. Just as Tony would go back to Pepper.
“See, man?” Sam protested. “This is exactly the kind of thing I’m talking about. You act like you can’t stand the guy, but you’ve been secretly pining for him instead? Since when?”
Then his gaze raked Tony up and down before settling on his crotch, his smirk turning competitive. “Well,” he said, “so far, maybe.”
He sighed. It would be so much easier if Tony would just yell at him. At least then Steve would know what he was thinking. Right now, Tony was just a few feet away, eyes firmly closed, yet in the endless silence, he’d never felt more distant. Almost alien. Like Bucky on the bridge, no recognition in his eyes. Like Peggy. Here, but gone.
“Speak for yourself, Mistoffolees,” Tony muttered. He hadn’t really meant for anyone to hear, but Shuri laughed heartily; no one else bothered to respond. For some reason, Tony thought of Peter, of how even after two years, the kid was still too awed in his presence to fully laugh at his jokes; Tony found it both awkward and adorable.
“They told me he was drunk.” The other man’s voice sounded dead. “That the crash was his fault.” He tilted his head. “I believed it.”
Therefore when the NEO alert went off midway through the congratulatory speeches, triggering a melodramatic cascade of red lights and alarms ringing throughout the building, Tony’s first thought was that it had to be a prank. His second, that it was a glitch. The network would have picked up on an approaching ship long before it reached near-earth orbit.
in to land. Good. It had taken a lot to convince Nebula to hang back for the initial confrontation, but she’d agreed it was necessary for someone to protect their replica Gauntlet, and who better than its appointed wielder? The android had only requested that Thanos be kept alive until she arrived, if possible. He hoped she’d be pleased at their success.
Wide-eyed, Peter’s words spilled out faster and faster. “Sorry I kinda disappeared there for a minute Mr Stark but I thought I recognized this place so I went to check outside and I was right, this is the hospital where Aunt May works, you remember her, Mr Stark? Of course you do, but anyway she was meant to be off today but when I called she’d actually come in already to help out in case people panicked and there were injuries with the alert and everything so when I called she was upstairs and she’s on her way down to join us, if that’s okay?”
Yet no attack came. “My old enemy,” the faceless man greeted the super-soldier, ignoring all else. “It’s been many years.”
actually sing, you know,” he grumbled, pulling his own jacket on against the descending evening chill.
As the alien ship took off, leaving behind one freshly severed alien hand, Stark’s helmet melted away. “Everyone good?” he asked, panting, eyes darting over everyone in visual range. Even Steve, briefly. Professional courtesy, Steve assumed.
He’d slept a long time, longer than he would have preferred, so by the time he got back to the lab he’d missed the rest of Tony’s surgery and most of the enhanced healing procedure. After Rhodey returned with Pepper, faces smooth with smiles and sympathy, Steve had left to give his report to the gathered team, which had not gone well. Ever since he’d woken up, despite his efforts to focus, he couldn’t seem to think straight. He knew what he wanted to say, but his mind kept dripping away from him in weird, loopy tangents; it took everything he had just to explain the broad strokes of Thanos’ previous victory, and how he and Tony had managed their return. On top of that, the team had new faces. New threats. When the green-skinned woman asked about Vormir, Steve had felt an overwhelming dizziness, had started stammering nonsense while everyone stared, and Sam had taken him back to the room. Bucky’s room. Steve had almost forgotten that.
“Okay,” Tony said, trying not to sound as terrified as he felt, and closed his eyes. By reflex, he squeezed Steve’s hand inside the Gauntlet, and was unaccountably cheered when Steve squeezed back before counting them down.
“Only if they survive,” Shuri muttered, and Tony winced at the razor-sharp truth in her words. Rocket had told them how close the Guardians had come to dying using just the Power Stone. Since Vision had used the Mind Stone for years without any negative effects, Tony believed Nebula’s synthetic body stood an excellent chance of wielding all six Infinity Stones without disintegrating, and he reckoned her mind would hold together through the power of pure spite. On the other hand, Thor had shrugged off a direct blast from a star without a scratch, so even if the android failed in her vengeance, the Asgardian would be on hand to attempt the Devastation’s undoing.
“Are- are you sure?” Tony asked, his last brain cell on duty working hard not to be selfish. “You know you don’t have to rush into anything.” Steve shot him such a weird look that for a second Tony thought he’d said something to offend him. “I just mean it’s okay if you want to wait, your first time should be special-”
No, it was easy for Steve to see all of Tony now, to embrace his uncertainty alongside his determination, cherish his vulnerability as well as his strength, and finally understand that there was nothing here that needed fixing. Tony just needed his help, for Steve to hold him safe until he slept; the next morning, Steve had watched a restored Tony wake up and bounce back into hopeful action, ready to damn the odds. Steve knew that to be the day this new thing between them had grown beyond plain necessity, had blossomed into delight.
“How does it feel?” Tony asked, deeply curious. Like they’d hoped, her synthetic body was showing no signs of rejection or damage, which was a good sign for the endgame.
And because Steve Rogers was never anything less than polite, he then began to fuck Tony as requested, setting a near-punishing rhythm that once more skated the line between too rough and not enough, that once more bordered on reckless in the best possible way. Finding himself surrounded by Steve, heart, body and mind, Tony was delirious, incandescent; his pleasure building and surging towards a glorious reckoning that he knew would consume him utterly, a destruction he welcomed with his whole heart, knew to be just another face of renewal.
“Yes. In my former life I dared too far and was judged unworthy,” Red Skull said. “My penance now is to serve.” He huffed air through his lipless mouth as if laughing, a grotesque and painful sound. “So much time spent without another soul to speak to, and now twice within the year, I have guests.”
She’d always been more Steve’s friend than his. “Thanks, Nat.” She hugged him then, pressed her lips to his cheek in a gesture that was both welcome and apology, before stepping aside.
Tony landed heavily beside him, his helmet disappearing as he scanned Steve anxiously head to toe. “Hey, you okay?” the billionaire asked.
The super-soldier reached into his jacket’s inner pocket and pulled out a flip phone identical to the one Tony had lost. He powered it up and held it out to Tony without speaking. Tony took it delicately, not sure what he was supposed to do next, but Steve was staring away into the distance, his shoulders hardened into battle lines yet somehow, still, brittle.
“Sure, yeah, by today’s standards,” Steve countered. “But back then I spent half my childhood sick in bed, not knowing if I would even wake up the next morning.” Years of memories, years of frustration. “Always standing on the sidelines, watching other people live their lives without me.” Choking on jealousy. Yelling at his mother, the only person he could reach. Witnessing her exhaustion. Then, the shame.
But then sure fingers were brushing against Steve’s cheek; Tony, gently wiping away his tears. Turning Steve’s face up to meet his dark, inscrutable gaze.
Yet even as fresh despair drained the life from Steve’s limbs, Tony stood and made his way around the table with cool, deliberate steps. Steve sat still, helpless, as the other man stopped beside his chair. “And we are
Alternative hypothesis: impossible as Tony was, maybe sometime in the last six months, he’d grown on the man. Possibly, if improbably, in ways that came with words connected to feelings of the L variety.
“I’m going to live forever,” he blurted out. Tony blinked, looking so confused that Steve hacked out a laugh, an awful cheerless sound. “Shuri said. The serum changed me, Tony. It wasn’t the ice. I can’t age. So I won’t die.” Broken. Wrong.
They’d spent the rest of the day resting. Bucky telling them about his goats. Sam asking careful measured questions about their shared past, the erased future, projecting calm and reassurance even as Steve got lost in the details, so slow to assemble answers. Friend Sam. But also dragging Steve out of the room to get ‘fresh air and a proper meal’. Medic Sam. Annoying good.
In the face of his continuing silence, Tony frowned, uncertain. “Uh, so. Would it be okay if I…?” He gestured at Steve’s hand, and finally Steve allowed himself to understand. H
The return of hope was a rush beyond anything Tony could have dreamed. It also made his knees buckle, and only Peter’s quick grab had kept him from hitting the floor.
And Steve saw the attack play out in his mind, movie-clear, even before Thanos grasped the arrow buried in his thigh, wrenched it free, sent its impossibly sharp edge hurtling towards Tony’s unprotected neck.
, Steve realized. He took a breath, heard a faint rattle in his lungs. “They took her away, so maybe…”
It takes a short time for Steve to explain who he is, much longer for them to start believing him. Showing off the nano suit finally tips them over the edge, judging by their stunned expressions. Yet through all their questions and challenges, all he can really feel is Tony’s gaze on his face, all he can think is
Sam caught up but didn’t touch him this time, just kept pace beside him as Steve slowed his walk, got his breathing back under control. Gone. “You good, man?” Sam asked eventually.
“She wouldn’t tell me,” Tony said, shaky with aftermath. Steve looked down; their hands were still entwined. That seemed important.
The view was as spectacular from the ground as Tony had predicted, but he was by now super extra hungry and so he left Steve to his staring and sneakily resumed custody of the supply bag abandoned by the super-soldier’s feet. It took a good ten minutes for the super-soldier to return to reality, and by then Tony was sitting on a blanket, a full picnic on display.
“I would say no,” Tony said. “But it’s kinda the usual. More so whenever he’s on edge.” He watched Shuri carefully. She’d been the last to talk to Steve before he’d gone full Lumber-Jack Torrance, so she probably knew more than he did about what was happening right now.
In his arrogance, Thanos had never expected a direct attack here on his home-world, and so they had managed to catch him off-guard, the Gauntlet nowhere to be seen. Once more, Thor had hit him with a chest strike, but this time there was no escape for the Mad Titan. His roars of agonized outrage were now echoing around the small valley in which he’d made his home, but Steve felt a distinct absence of pity for the wounded alien.
He stepped aside to give them more space, pulling out his phone as an excuse to stay clear of the rest of the group, and was oddly heartened that he had exactly zero missed calls. No furious voice-mails, no scathing messages demanding his immediate attention. Tony tapped idly at the screen, welcoming the brief moment of peace despite the looming end of the world.
theory, actually, Bruce - is that Thanos will be erased in each timeline the second he claims two Infinity Stones. So if Loki had brought him both the scepter and the Tesseract, that would have actually solved our problem. Unfortunately-”
She broke off, swallowing back tears. Tony reached out and took her hand, awed by her towering courage, her determination to trust. Like any good parent, her child’s happiness defined her whole world. She had to know that supporting Peter would over the years bring her more heartache than joy, but for better or worse here she was, taking on the challenge anyway. Finding a way to give Peter her fullest attention, her deepest trust. Time and again, her actions proving her love.
Clint had told them everything that had happened, if only once, and so Steve is prepared for the mountain, the cold, the sky. He is even prepared for Schmidt, who barely blinks at his arrival.
That was all he had time to say, because next thing someone was pushing him aside, someone tall and blonde and-
Bruce’s glance slid away, and for one dizzying moment Tony thought his friend was going to decline. But Bruce came through. “I’ll always be there for Tony,” he said instead.
Too late, Steve realized the other conversation had fallen silent. Nat squeezed his arm in subtle apology, meaning his team-mates had definitely been listening for a while. Anger flared within him but faded just as quickly, snuffed out by his awareness of the grief recently spent on his behalf. Besides, if his mistakes were affecting the team, he owed them a chance to speak.
what the kid deserves to know is that no matter how hard he tries you’ll never be capable of anything better-”
The amused affection in his voice was a familiar balm applied to a long-neglected ache; Steve hadn’t known it was possible to be homesick for a person. Despite everything else about this awful week, Bucky had been restored to him. He may have lost his job, his team, and damaged -
“Then explain it to me,” Steve breathed, his eyes stinging at the defeat in Tony’s shoulders, the tremble in his voice. “I want to understand. Please, talk to me, Tony. Let me help you.”
“I…” the android trailed off. “I feel… something.” She clenched her fist and the Space Stone emitted a faint blue glow in response, the color traveling up her arm in short pulses, its energy diffusing under her synthetic skin. The effect would be pretty, if it weren’t so terrifying to think of the damage such power would do to an organic body.
Nebula caught Tony looking and raised her chin haughtily, as if to deny her own sorrow. “Rocket is one of the Guardians, like Gamora and Quill,” the android explained. Then she stared at the raccoon, as if seeing him for the first time. “I suppose he is now the last.” Rocket moaned softly, his anguish at the news wrenching to witness.
“How very noble of you,” Tony drawls, but he’s still hilariously distracted by the nano-suit; Steve can practically feel his genius mind fizzing over the possibilities.
“Wait- Steve? What… what are you talking about?” Tony’s voice rang harsh with fear; Steve regretted ever speaking a word, ever waking, ever trying, broken
He couldn’t tell which of them was the more shocked. Even in Steve’s limited experience, the kiss felt clumsy; Tony’s mouth stayed hard and dry and unresponsive beneath his own.
Steve took a moment, considering. “Alright. Leave it alone for now. We’ll evacuate non-essentials to Earth, then give it a try.”
speeding safely away, but then the super-soldier pulled him into his side, held him tight, and Tony thought that maybe this would be better, either way.
There, time passed oddly, everything seeming to jumble together out of sequence. In a kaleidoscope of fractured moments, Steve talked to Tony, then to Peggy; he watched Sam and Tony glare at each other. Then Sam was at the window alone, looking worried, but somewhere in between the pain woke, obliterating him again; Steve felt his mind turn inside out, heard himself screaming, and then Tony was back behind the glass and promising he wouldn’t leave again but Steve couldn’t
Thankfully, Clint spotted Steve’s dilemma and immediately stood, announcing his need to do a pre-dawn snack run and dragging a grumbling Bruce away with him. Bucky took his place on the floor, briefly gripping Steve’s offered hand then wrapping his arm around Steve’s leg in mute relief. Wielding her usual discretion, Nat pointed Thor to Bruce’s vacated spot on the other couch and struck up a loud conversation with him, Rhodey and Sam. Her cover freed Steve to give Bucky the full attention he deserved, their reunion two years delayed by the strict terms of Steve's parole.
“Hey, easy,” Tony said, leaning forward. “Easy, Steve, relax.” He was so much closer now, so much clearer, but still out of reach- “We have a plan, okay? Strange is gonna buy us time to make the serum, so you’re going to be just fine,” Tony continued, but Steve could see the tension twisting his mouth, dragging down its corners. As if Tony was trying to convince himself his words held hope, even more than Steve. Which was… infuriating. Steve could handle bad news. Even the worst.
Muscle by muscle, Steve forced himself to relax, closing his eyes against the stinging spray of hot water. His mistake was embarrassing, and all too clear in hindsight, but at least there was an obvious remedy available to him.
“Crack the formula? Yeah, probably.” Tony spread his hands. “But then give it to who? The Army? SHIELD? Fury was already hounding me to hand over Extremis after I helped Pepper. At least DC changed his mind on that one. Imagine an army of Rumlows breathing fire. Uh, no thanks.”
After the rogue Avengers are pardoned, they visit New York. It’s not home, not anymore, but it’ll do. They pick 4th July to officially retire. The world goes on, oblivious. Steve is glad. Tony is glad.
, and then Steve was kissing him back, was in fact pinning Tony against the bathroom door and devouring him, ravenous, his mouth eager enough,
And there was a discreet but exasperating ping from FRIDAY, the signal to request their full attention. At least the interruption had made Tony jump too.
“I didn’t plan it,” Tony whispered, his voice cracking. “Just so you know. That night, I didn’t… It wasn’t revenge.”
“I’m sorry,” she said. Tony glared as if offended by her pessimism, but Helen held firm. “That will take time, and…”
“Contrary to what you’re thinking, that little reunion was not actually on the schedule,” he declared, earning a few anxious giggles. “But if nothing else, today’s demonstration proves that Earth’s orbital defense system is fully operational. From this moment onward, nothing can or will approach our planet without our awareness and permission. What’s more, if I may be so bold as to confirm the return of Thor Odinson and Bruce Banner- no spoilers- it looks like the Avengers team might soon be back at full capacity. Not a bad day at the office, if I may say so myself.”
And now Steve has to look away, has to blink back the tears, because no matter how many times he has asked himself that question, he has found no answer that he can live with, no possibility that brings him a single shred of comfort.
“Shuri is investigating,” T’Challa said. He and Okoye spoke then, hashing out details of necessary schedule changes as they walked, not too fast, to the rooftop airstrip. Tony tuned it all out, drifting in a cold bubble of unreality. Bruce was back. Thor was back. Asgard was gone. Earth was next-
Steve shook his head, light-headed despite the oxygen mask’s assistance. “I would have forgiven you, if I’d known, Tony… You could have talked to me.”
“King of the North,” Shuri greeted him. The memory of the first time she’d called him that made Tony smile. But it also felt so very long ago.
As the alien ship came into view, the small crowd grew dutifully quiet. Tony felt rather than saw someone slip in behind Barton, and turned his head automatically. And there
The other man swung round, lips sneered, as if the very sight of Tony offended him. “I thought you wanted to get me home,
Back in the old days, Tony or Clint would’ve stepped up long before this, cracked a joke, lightened the tension, but the billionaire was frowning at the floor, his mind clearly miles away and traveling at maximum warp, and the archer… Well, Steve hadn’t seen him smile since he’d joined them in Wakanda. Now Clint stood glaring at the door as if Thanos himself was waiting on the other side. Steve glanced at Natasha beside him; she too was studying Clint, her gaze cool with professional detachment. The two of them had volunteered for scout duty, their skills being the best suited to finding Thanos and observing him without detection. Natasha caught Steve looking, gave him a curt nod. On top of locating the target, she would also need to keep Clint’s thirst for vengeance in check, so the archer didn’t kill himself doing something stupid. It was her job within the job. Steve understood.
Rhodey came in and sat across from them, stifling a yawn with the back of his hand. “Mornnngh,” he muttered. Tony poured him a cup of coffee and pushed it towards him. Odd. Usually Rhodey was a morning person. Nearby, Clint dropped his fork with a loud clang, cursing as he stretched down to pick it up and Tony’s ribs twinged in sympathy. The archer had badly snapped a forearm in training yesterday, and despite the joys of instant healing, some sensations tended to linger.
…which means changing that one day, that one moment, cannot be risked. Steve knows it is the one thing that cannot ever be risked, and so, again, he lets go of hope.
“Yeah so I’ll be back,” Tony announced abruptly. He received no response, and when Tony returned thirty minutes later, Steve blinked and glanced over at his station as if the super-soldier hadn’t even noticed he’d left.
And somehow, for some reason, the idea of Steve waking up alone made Tony’s insides crumble. His body started trembling, every cell united in a refusal that was going to be really embarrassing to explain, because Tony was suddenly mathematically certain that if he were to leave the hospital right now, Steve would die, or maybe Tony would, or both.
,” Tony mocked him, the dangerous glint back in his eyes. “Okay, Rogers, then talk.” He pushed his plate away despite having eaten nothing. “Let’s start with how you knew Hydra murdered my parents and you didn’t tell me.”
He felt a hand on his face; the Captain brushed it aside, met concerned eyes, watched confusion set in. The Captain rolled to his feet in one fluid movement, approaching the Soul Stone still hovering nearby.
And then, Stark’s army of lawyers had ripped the Accords apart, forcing through amendments and protocols that Steve had never dreamed of, the finalized document safeguarding their ability to act as they saw fit in the interest of humanity. In truth, as an organization the Avengers had emerged better off than before, able to call on expert international assistance rather than being forced to scramble through situations on their own.
Rhodey led him through corridors until they arrived in a large warm room with the Wakandan equivalent of kitchen appliances along one wall.
“Mrrow,” he growled, and opened his eyes. Tony was standing by the window, the dark-haired woman again at his side.
Contempt for the man’s pettiness broke the last of Tony’s restraint. “Oh, fuck off, I’m not doing this, you understand? Something is happening, something serious, and I have to do my
Pepper was again trying to blink back tears, Tony’s heart crushing smaller and tighter as she continued. “But don’t try to tell me you would make any other choice. Even if you had known what it meant, what leaving would do to us. You will always leave me behind, without a second of hesitation. That’s part of who you are. It’s what makes you a hero. But it’s the one part of you, the one part of
Eventually, Steve made a move, scooping Tony up and sliding him under the blanket, his cooling skin finding this a welcome refuge from the slight chill of the night air. Once they were both settled and warm, Steve bent in to kiss Tony’s neck, his eyes, his lips. “So long,” he murmured, reverent against Tony’s skin. “I’ve loved you so long.”
More specifically, it was the way they shared a bed now, and that felt… right, but from the glances he was getting here and there, he wasn’t sure it was right. No one had mentioned Pepper where Steve could hear, but he saw Rhodey subtly check Tony’s hand for his engagement ring every morning, as if to be sure he hadn’t removed it. Hadn’t forgotten her. As if Tony could ever forget Pepper. They were the strongest couple Steve knew.
“You…” Steve bowed his head as the realization hit, then he raised himself on his elbow and stared down at Tony as if he was still the key to saving the universe. “You really think you could?”
, Steve-” and then he was enveloped in Steve’s arms, pinned under Steve’s weight, Steve’s tongue claiming his mouth; every part of Tony surrendered, drifting further into a bliss he’d never known he’d been missing. Just in time, one last brain cell fired in self-preservation, and he opened reluctant eyes, chattered reluctant words, “wait, wait, hang on, we’re gonna need…”
He had a job to do, so he held his focus throughout the reunion with Thor and Bruce, the introductions to the new faces and the reintroduction to one particularly greasy, smug face that Barton managed to flatten with a single punch. Worth the broken hand, in Tony’s opinion. They moved indoors for the real talk, Barton reappearing in a sling just as Romanoff finished briefing the newcomers on the past three years’ socio-political happenings, culminating in Wakanda’s emergence as the world’s nicest superpower.
“My bad, babe,” Tony answered. “Medical discharged me late, everyone else had left for Norway already but I figured I’d come pick you up first.”
something was coming; he’d warned the team, but no one had wanted to hear it. Every time he pushed, they’d picked Rogers instead, falling in behind his noble words and shiny optimism. No matter what he said now, he knew they would rather follow their Captain, all the way to their noble shiny destruction.
The billionaire sounded sincere. Steve wanted to believe he really was sincere. Yet he also knew Tony would sacrifice anything, betray everything, for a chance to do what he thought was right. It was a detail he’d somehow sneered at from afar. He flat-out hated it now, up close. But regardless, it was true and it was real, and so Steve had accepted it.
So naturally, instead, he’d had to spend an additional eight hours fielding panicked queries from jittery squad leads who apparently had skipped their Ready-Brek and now “just wanted to be sure” that one plus one still equaled two. Amateurs. You’d think they’d never built a space station before.
For the tiniest of moments, Stark’s eyes met Steve’s, then flicked heavenward in exasperation. And Steve couldn’t help but give the tiniest grin in response.
Steve knows his presence will change this world. He’s counting on it. And yet, in this moment, he hates himself for it.
He could easily pick out the six videos Ty had used to threaten him, but with a sickening lurch, Tony spotted at least a dozen more that he’d never seen before. All of him. Some with Ty. But some with
The super-soldier was awake and lying across from him, less than a foot away. He looked different lying down. Younger, maybe. Or perhaps it was the beard. Too sleep-fogged to resist, Tony reached out and ran his fingers through the scruff. Steve closed his eyes at the playful contact, opened them, smiled. Somehow this felt easy. Natural.
She positioned the plastic chair closer to the bed, and Tony obediently sat, keeping his hands safely raised.
When the remaining four Stones were gathered on Earth, Thanos would have no choice but to attack. The magical Doctor and his gloom-faced monk friend would be able harness the power of the Stones to protect the planet, while the Avengers would take on Thanos directly.
“Okay, Fri, send it off, wrap everything up,” Tony said. “Then engage bunker mode for the next twelve hours. Anything short of an apocalypse, I don’t want to hear it. Some of us have important business to attend to.”
She sounded calm, but Tony looked scared, and Steve felt the stars murmur a warning, cold dread seeping through his insides. “But Tony?” he asked desperately. “What about Tony?”
“Exactly,” Stark crowed, giving Strange the glorious star-burst grin that Steve had once so cherished.
They both looked at Steve expectantly, as if waiting for his opinion. He wished people would stop doing that for areas outside his expertise. Magic wasn’t punching. Yet the books he’d read on leadership said that most people just wanted support to validate their own choices, so he tried to look calm and certain. “Yeah, sounds good,” he said, and nodded to the cauldron. “What’s this for?” he asked.
His friend paused, then shrugged. “Compared to what?” At Steve’s frown, he shook his head. “I’m fine, Stevie. Really. It’s just that one of the perks of being on the run was that I didn’t have to spend my days thinking about all the lives I took. Wondering about the families they left behind.”
Tony held up his hands in surrender and settled back in the chair. Rhodey sat back down on a nearby stool, and they looked at each other.
?” the billionaire asked, snapping back into his usual intense focus. Steve followed, just a beat behind.
Clint and Natasha led them all down the ramp and into the bright sunlight. There, Tony was delighted to find Shuri accompanied by the Dora Milaje, although it pained him to guess what that meant for her mother and brother.
Steve had been busy strapping down his shield, and now handed Tony one of Rocket’s breathers. He put it on before he summoned the Iron Man armor, letting the nanobots swarm over the alien device without impeding its function. After checking Steve’s breather was correctly in place, Tony turned to Nebula and nodded. “Ready.”
Again, Red Skull paused before replying, and the sound of the wind rang through the silence like a warning. “Complete the journey to the summit, and I will answer all of your questions.” The others looked as shocked as Tony felt. There was possibly nothing waiting for them ahead but a trap, yet the possibility of retrieving the Soul Stone was too urgent a temptation. Therefore they had nothing to discuss; after a couple of glances, they fell in beside each other and followed the faceless man along the last stretch of the trail.
“Ty found out I was using him to get back at you,” he said, full of self-loathing at the ugly truth. “It broke his heart. He threatened to leave, but I begged him to stay.”
“I know,” Tony whispered back. “Sorry.” A pause. “Technically though, that promise was more regarding the fight with Thanos than a perpetual commitment...”
Nebula hesitated, then gestured and another portal opened. Steve had been oddly quiet since their arrival and even now seemed preoccupied, so Tony stepped through first, repulsors ready. At first he found nothing but the same gloomy view, but then he turned and saw the single tall mountain peak rising over them.
“If he’d let you?” Steve blurted out. Tony’s face went blank, and Steve wondered if he’d gone too far, mentioning Stone. But instead of shutting Steve down, the other man took a breath, bowed his head, and nodded in acknowledgment.
Rhodey eyed him. “Nebula told us what happened on Titan, you know. How you went toe to toe with Thanos. Even made him bleed.”
“I’m gonna make you feel so good, Steve,” Tony murmured, beyond paying attention to what he was saying anymore.
Clint is silent. Then he yells. Points out what Steve has done. The danger of them knowing the cost ahead of time. The cruelty when in order to beat Thanos they’ll
And once more, it seemed, the scientist was showing him the way. Steve stepped back, bridging the gap between the two and Natasha on his other side. He nudged Bruce’s elbow to get his attention, then when the scientist opened his eyes, Steve raised his right hand and placed it on his own chest. Bruce cottoned on instantly, quirked a half-grin at Steve and reached out to place his left hand on Steve’s chest. Thor opened his eyes at the motion, also catching on, and poked Tony on his other side; the billionaire was startled but instantly joined in once he saw what they were doing. Steve raised his left hand towards Natasha, let her guide it into place over her heart. There was one long moment - when Clint finally looked around, saw the space kept for him in the circle, stared narrow-eyed at Natasha’s offered hand - where Steve thought the archer was going to refuse the gesture. Please, Steve thought. Please. But eventually, Clint too stepped in, placed his left hand over Tony’s heart, and for a long minute they all stood gently, eyes closed, breathing as one. Inhale and exhale.
,” he said; he watched in awe as Steve Rogers smiled with his whole soul, his face lit up like a goddamn fireworks display, and if there was ever going to be a more beautiful sight in the universe then Tony had no interest in seeing it.
It was all he had time to think, because Tony’s mouth was heated gold against his own, Steve falling endlessly into him; Tony’s fingers raked ungentle lines along Steve’s jaw, through Steve’s hair. In glorious desperation, Steve opened his lips, snaked his tongue into Tony’s mouth, needing more, demanding
It wouldn’t only be Tony, either. Peter was sharing their couch, curled up at the other end with Tony’s feet on his lap, and was currently snoring softly. Nat was stretched precariously along the back of the couch, her head resting on Steve’s shoulder and her arm tucked around both him and Tony. Sam and Clint were sitting on the floor but each kept finding ways to subtly lean against Steve. Bruce and Rhodey had dragged the other couch over for themselves, nearly closing the group into a circle. Rationally, Steve knew that the team was just seeking reassurance after the near loss of their leader, but it was kinda intense to go from full isolation protocol to being stuck in a nest of semi-traumatized friends.
Tony half-laughed, half-sobbed. Steve. From what he could see, the super-soldier’s body had been restored to its usual perfection, and Tony buried his head into Steve’s shoulder, carelessly thanking whatever force in the universe might be listening.
Steve wanted to lie. He wanted to run. He wished he could be anywhere but here, could watch any heart break but this one. Yet Tony had held on to his control long enough to ask the question. He deserved for Steve to meet him halfway with the answer. Deserved the truth, whatever it cost.
Steve struggled to breathe, grasping towards some sort of reply, an argument, an appeal. Anything to make Tony give him another chance, just one more chance. But no answer came. “I guess…” he started, then gave up. “I guess you don’t.”
He knew Peter wouldn’t turn seventeen for another month, but… “Happy birthday, kid,” Tony whispered softly. “Karen, you home?” When Peter’s AI confirmed she had been successfully transferred, Tony pushed himself to his feet and rounded the table, May following close at his side.
Her doctors kept telling him her recovery was slow but proceeding well. They kept saying they’d let him know when she was strong enough for visitors.
“There's too much bleeding, they’re taking him straight up to surgery,” the tall man said crisply, but his hand on Tony’s shoulder was gentle. “Christine Palmer is the best trauma surgeon I’ve ever known. She’ll get him through this.”
“Hey Pete, can you please take pity on an old man, not to mention dolphins everywhere, and slow the heck down,” Tony said, trying not to sound like a total grouch.
With only a small sample needed, nothing about the process should have affected him, yet he felt oddly depleted afterwards. Young though she was, Shuri was wise enough not to smother him in thanks. Instead she shooed him out of her lab as if nothing significant had just occurred.
This time the Space Stone takes him to Morag, where he watches Rhodey put Starlord in the dirt. All things are possible so once they’re out of sight, Steve drags him back to the
. “Okay, but then we really should get going,” he said. “I was just getting ready to leave myself, didn’t fancy third wheeling it much longer.”
, he guessed, just as a tall man in a red cape stepped through, accompanied by a short man dressed like a monk.
Nebula glared over at the billionaire, and Steve wondered if he should intervene. But the android just rolled her eyes. “Yes. Again, I am certain. This is Titan, restored to its former appearance by Thanos. As I have explained. Multiple times.”
“Your leader carries the Space Stone, what I once knew as the Tesseract. This is one of six gems…” the faceless man began but Tony rolled his eyes and cut in.
“Oh yeah? Cool,” Tony murmured, stifling a yawn behind his hand. Then his eyes popped fully open, and he swiveled back to stare at Steve, suddenly wide awake.
“I hope you know I don’t believe what I said,” Steve said. “I was just so angry at you, and- and sad, and when I lost it, I went way too far. What I said yesterday was cruel and untrue, and you didn’t deserve any of it. ”
Tony stared at him as if deciding whether to believe his words, then glanced around and shook his head. “I don’t…” He looked back at Steve. “Did we just win?”
“Great, I don’t care,” Tony said, already marching off towards the Quinjet. “Oh, and I’m taking my ship back,” he called over his shoulder.
Wilson, out on patrol, happened to spot him. “We got visual-” he managed, then yelled as the big purple alien waved his big golden glove and his wings crumbled into red ash.
“Uh, because it’s me?” Tony raised one shoulder in a lopsided shrug. “Half the global media wants to jerk off on how I’m a spoiled rich brat with a god complex, while apparently half the damn Internet needs to believe that I’m some indestructible robot messiah just so they can get through their day. I start crying victim, they’d probably all demand a refund.” His lips twisted in a failed smirk. “Wouldn’t exactly be the trademark Tony Stark experience.”
This time, he thought of Peggy, her loss still so raw, still so unbelievable. Steve’s mind fastened onto their first meeting, how her fiery spirit had immediately captured his attention, then his imagination. How he’d longed to draw her. How he’d never dared ask. Not yet, he’d kept telling himself. Not now. After their dance. After the war.
The other man kept his gaze averted. “Do what you want,” he said, but his voice felt like ice itself.
Even as he fumbled for an adequate apology, Steve could see Stark’s hurt drain away, replaced by something vicious, almost feral.
Steve looked at Tony, now noticing traces of the same slightly manic elation as Gamora. “What did you see? Memories?”
“So what, you see me without the serum for one minute and you’re already thinking wow, poor tiny Steve, it’s cute how he tries to be brave but now I know how he’s so pathetic really-”
Barnes kicked the only chair towards him, opting himself to slouch against the wall. “You should sit,” he said. “Magic healing really wears you out.”
“Fuck,” Tony announced, because what else was there to say, and he leaned in to crush the other man’s mouth against his own, Steve holding him close as if he would never let go. After that first surge, the kiss softened into something unhurried, slow and sweet; when they eventually broke apart, it was more out of the need to look at each other than to catch their breath.
Stark was staring down at it, his nose crinkled in confusion. “You told me that was a real-time feed of an alien sky.”
“Hi,” Pepper said, caressing his forehead, his cheek. He surrendered to her touch, content, watching her face. “I heard you had quite the trip,” she said eventually, a hint of… something… in her voice. Of course. New York. To her, he had just left. Had left her.
The first hints of early summer dawn was already brightening the room. With Steve now stable in recovery, the New York team decided it would be best to go back to the Sanctum and rest up before the next attack. Despite his own lack of fatigue, Tony judged this a good move, and had even made up his mind to leave with them, but right as Wong began opening the portal, Wilson announced his intention to stay behind until Steve woke up.
Across the table, Peter stirred. “Mr Stark is injured, he shouldn’t go.” He stood, shoulders square. “But I will.”
Steve stared after Tony, unaware of anything else, until Bucky gave him an impatient shove. “This is the part where you go after him, Stevie.”
“Ah, the Captain,” the alien said, an odd note of reverence entering his voice. “Man out of time. I must confess, your story moves me deeply, for I too have suffered the loss of an entire living world. I too have been cast out, left to wander without a home. Therefore to you alone, I will show mercy.”
“No, it’s fine,” Steve said. “I mean, if you don’t mind staying?” Because maybe Tony didn’t want to be here. Maybe Tony didn’t want to be sad.
In a quiet but resolute voice, Tony announced he would be going to the mansion the next day to confront Stone. As a distraction, he said. Steve knew it meant far more than that, so he didn’t argue, despite Tony peering at him suspiciously. Steve waited until the meeting was over and they were alone, then quietly asked if he could come too.
The lyrics made Tony smile; leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder, he relaxed into a sweet, wandering happiness, imagining with a soft thrill the
“No, no, he’s alive, Tony,” his friend rushed to reassure him. “We didn’t lose him. It’s okay. Steve’s alive.”
Tony sat down without ceremony, slapping Bruce’s knee as a greeting. The scientist nodded his way but both Shuri and Okoye - it turned out the General was from a farming background - were paying rapt attention to his words. With such an audience, nothing could break Bruce’s excited babble of observations thus far on Titan’s native flora and how its alien biology was reflected in the fauna they’d so far encountered, using the lumpy plant they were peeling as an example. Tony rolled his eyes; internally, because friends. But no one should be this excited over a space potato.
Then for a while Tony lost the thread of things, the voices above his head blending into strands of meaningless noise. Later he felt himself lifted, strong bodies on either side helping him stumble forward. And then it was quiet, and he was warm, like he was flying through a summer sky, all of his thoughts drifting apart and away, into the clouds.
“Yeah, well, hot brunettes, more your thing than mine,” Tony said, then froze, eyes darting to his face then away.
For a moment, Tony had no idea what Steve was talking about. He usually blasted music out loud when he worked and sang along to that, if anything. Then he remembered the earphones he’d worn earlier, so he could play music without disturbing Steve. Music that was apparently loud enough to prevent him from hearing himself make noise. Meaning…
“Why thank you, Mr Odinson,” May said, smiling up at the Asgardian, a certain twinkle in her eye suggesting she’d taken note of his enthusiasm. While May leaned over to give Tony then Steve a quick kiss on the head, Thor managed to pick Peter up; there was one accidental introduction of the kid’s head to a stray wall, but under May’s supervision, they left without further incident.
The former assassin chuckled, looking more relaxed than Tony could have imagined. “Well, you know, sufficiently advanced technology…”
“No, Tony,” he said, and damn the man if he wasn’t giving him the blue-eyed Captain Earnest stare. “I think… I just needed to know that you were okay.” Steve hesitated. “That we were okay.”
Once Steve’s sedative kicked in, the full impossible weight of Tony’s anguish broke through, annihilating his earlier promises.
“Yeah gotta say, that was a weird choice.” Tony was doing his trademark babbling-in-the-face-of-evil thing, sounding supremely confident. Hiding his fear so well. “Guess arrogance is a universal super-villain problem. I mean, look around, Crusoe. You didn’t think we’d come for you? That someone in the universe would fight back?”
Before he can knock, Steve opens the door, but instead of saying anything the man just raises a single damn eyebrow at him, the beard even more glorious than Tony remembers-
But for his defiance he had burned too recklessly, too bright, as he had always feared, always known he would; the second Steve stopped to take a breath, he knew the ice would be waiting, this time blotting out everything, leaving no warmth, no light, no hope. Only bargains, and costs, because the Captain had a mission; there was nothing else left now but the mission.
He must have slept deeply but not for long, for it was not yet noon when he next opened his eyes. Steve found himself on his side with both arms fastened around Tony’s waist, gentle fingers idly twining through his hair. The other man was staring at the ceiling, wide awake,.
Tony, in contrast, seemed overwhelmed by the support, so Steve offered to take over logistics. Given the unofficial nature of their actions, they had to maintain the illusion of normality as far as possible, so Thor agreed that New Asgard would stage a celebratory feast on behalf of Earth’s great victory, starting immediately. By custom, such a feast lasted for days, and would both explain their absence from the Compound and give each of them a respectable alibi.
“Do not move him!” the tall man orders; the Captain snarls, but Steve listens, hears the words, bleeding, stabilized, pressure, shock. Fumbling, he takes Tony’s hand, presses it against his cheek, waits while the others go, to and fro. Eyes flutter open. Steve sees. Then Tony, weak; Steve’s hand to his lips; Steve shakes. Relief, warm, together.
- they would have to live up to the name. As if everything in their lives had inevitably led up to this moment, the job not just another mission but some grand confluence of destiny. He was as ready as he could be, Steve thought. His body felt strong and rested. His mind felt focused and calm. In the inner space the Captain was waiting. But even there, in the most stable place he knew, Steve could feel a lurking terror underneath, a barely suppressed tremble that warned of the hell to come the second he stopped fighting the fear into remission. And looking around, he could see the same in his teammates, the struggle it took just to stand still.
“If what’s too late, sweetheart?” Tony asked; he knew but he needed to verify because that was the game now, but god, this wasn’t a game, this was Steve, this was
“What stopped you?” Tony asked. Calmly. As if he’d hadn’t spent years having nightmares about this question and all its possible hellchild answers.
Desperate beyond reason, Tony increased power to his repulsors to the max safe levels; he began to make slow progress through the resistance, but Steve was dying, so he increased them again, then again. Warning indicators were flashing everywhere on his visual display but he ignored them, his mind and heart focused only on reaching the super-soldier in time. The arc reactor was screaming now, and maybe he was too; when Steve fell silent, he channeled every scrap of energy into one last desperate burst of acceleration. Light flashed orange around him - the air itself catching fire - and instead of watching his nanobots flame to ash, he closed his eyes and prepared to die.
May turned to Peter. “Actually, sweetie, I’m getting a headache, can you go grab me a coffee? Hazelnut milk, if they have it.” Once the kid had left them alone, she eyed Tony up and down. “Tony, you have a serious concussion.”
Tony glared at him and flounced away, as Steve probably should have expected. He hurried to catch up, falling into step with Tony so they approached Thanos together.
A soothing voice among the voices is murmuring reassurances, stroking his brow. Nat. He doesn’t realize he says her name out loud until she responds, asking him about Tony, why he’d mentioned him, what he knew. Tony’s on Titan, he tells her. He has to get there, he says. She wipes his tears away, promises they’ll find a way, but he can hear doubt in the voices. Then, they fall silent. The Captain suggests defensive measures. Steve ignores.
Tony’s gaze dropped to his phone, then slid away. “Trust me, Rogers,” he said. “Nowhere I’d rather be.” His words sounded sincere, but that didn’t mean much. Tony could be kind when it mattered. He could also lie better than anyone Steve had ever known. Yet either way, Steve didn’t have the energy to argue. The exhaustion had been growing within him, hour by hour, and this latest doze hadn’t made a dent.
“Excuse me, those are Stark modified so therefore our nanobots, and gee, you know, kinda bleeding out at the time…” Joking around felt good, except Rhodey looked kinda sick. Oops.
Tony set aside the apple core - composting was important - and moved further into the room, not so subtly making his presence known to the twins by engaging in their favorite Godzilla impression. His hammy shambling growls were met with the usual flurry of giggles and plushie-bomb attacks, aided a little too well by Nat. After they had successfully tackled Godzilla to the ground and were sitting on him, triumphant, Nat declared victory to the twins; graciously, they allowed Tony to sit up and catch his breath for a full ten seconds.
Looking down, Tony took Steve’s hand in his, the callused rasp of Tony’s skin against his own sending chills racing over Steve’s entire body. “Do you want to kiss me?” Tony murmured.
Tony found his voice. “You think Steve… and me? Why? If anyone, it would be you-” He broke off when Barnes barked a laugh.
Ty’s gaze narrowed on Tony’s face; Tony’s stomach lurched as if he was physically in the room. “Oh, my sweet, foolish Anthony. Did you really think the truth wouldn’t come out? Hospitals aren’t secure, you know that. Even I can’t sit on this story forever. People are already whispering about your conspicuous failure to fight for Earth. About what a horrendous disappointment you turned out to be. Imagine what they’ll say when they see all of this…” He gestured wide to the screens around the room, still displaying their unspeakable horrors.
“So’s patience,” Bucky shot back. He looked towards where Tony had gone, his mouth drawn tight. “And he’s had a shit day even by our standards, so maybe give the guy a break.”
“Maybe since New York?” Steve said, then frowned as the others all groaned in frustration. “But I didn’t know what to call it, I’ve never fallen for a man before, I just… I knew he was important somehow, and being around him made me feel, I don’t know…”
Steve’s mind hushed to silence at his touch. Wordless, he stared up at the other man, unable to move until Tony brushed a thumb over his lips; Steve gasped, his breath hitching as if in pain.
. Nat is quiet, resolute. Strong. Steve holds her close and tells her he’s wrong, Clint is wrong, if Bruce is right then no one ever has to worry about Thanos anymore, the price has already been paid but no matter what Steve says there is still too much doubt on her face, still that silent debt in her eyes…
Steve’s grip must have tightened because Ty moaned again. “I need you to understand what will happen to you if you make a move against Tony, or his company, or anyone connected to him. It won’t happen straight away. You might spend days thinking you have succeeded, believing you are safe. You will be wrong. No matter how well you plan, no matter who you buy, it will never be enough. There will come a day that feels just like all the others, right up until you find yourself on the floor, screaming. And despite all your riches, all your cleverness, there will be no one around to find you. Instead you’ll die alone, in agony. We’ll make sure of it.”
“I strongly disagree and will fight you over everything you just said,” the billionaire said in a severe tone, but he was smiling.
Tony felt his heart sinking further as the frenzied minutes wore on. For every step they forced the alien back, he managed to take two towards the Sanctum. Briefly, things looked up when Peter swung in out of nowhere - Tony was gonna
seek.” He raised his left hand, showing off the golden gauntlet he wore. The three Stones he had already collected. Red, purple and… blue.
But Steve couldn’t look at him anymore, couldn’t bear to see this stranger wearing Tony’s face. Instead, he buried his face in his hands, trying not to collapse fully onto the table, waiting for the room to stop spinning. Worse than the despair was the shock, as if until now, Steve had somehow believed this situation could end happily. He should have known better. Once, with the serum, Steve had been granted everything he’d ever wanted. But like a fairytale boy who’d used up all his wishes, it meant he could never be lucky again.
After a beat, Steve clasped his wrist and got to his feet heavily; Tony had to support his weight more than he’d expected until the super-soldier stepped free. “What’s going on?”
As Rhodey stepped back, Nat slipped close and pressed her lips to Tony’s cheek. He smiled. “Go save the world,” he told them.
“Okay fine, fine, but jalapeno to ghost pepper, how spicy we talkin’?” Tony asked, winking at the nearest wide-eyed journalist.
Dr Lewis finished taking the second sample and left after a significantly more subdued rounds of goodbyes.
“Uhm, so maybe this is more of a, uh, personal question,” the kid said, “but, uh, the readers of my blog would really like to know, are you going to return to New York after the launch? You know, with the wedding coming up…”
Somehow, his former nickname made Steve’s heart ache worse than his ribs, but once more the pain medication was softening his grip on the conversation. “Okay,” he whispered, his eyes drifting shut.
“I know,” he said. But he didn’t; instead he trash talked hospital food which somehow turned into May tricking him into promising his attendance at Peter’s celebration dinner. Therefore in the spirit of vengeance, when the kid returned Tony managed to sweet-talk May as his self-appointed friend into letting him have just one blessed sip of her dreadful coffee. Between that and the sandwich, Tony’s mood drastically improved, and by the time his new official nurse took him off the drip, he felt well enough to get out of bed.
Tony gritted his teeth against yet another wave of slow, hot tears, trying to shelve his own misery but failing. It wasn’t fair. This was supposed to be the better future, the one where everyone could live mundanely ever after, as happily or as miserably as they wanted. To win it back, Tony had been willing to sacrifice everything, pay any price. But not this. Not
“-and what did you mean, ‘catch up on the road’? Did you seriously think you could just up and leave me again-”
“Oh, great,” Tony mutters, then fixes Steve with a glare. “Okay, Samurai Jack, that was Bruce’s theory, what was mine?”
And then, he was standing on a featureless plain underneath an orange sky. The ground underfoot looked like water but was solid, mirror-like. There was a small open structure nearby, with a familiar figure waiting beneath it.
“I’m so sorry,” she said. “I ran the tests myself, three times. Your immune system has been dormant since the serum was administered in the 1940s. Unfortunately, that means your current immune response is nonexistent. Your body is just not able to handle the modern era without the serum’s assistance.”
For now, the Captain had his own job to do. Steve left Thanos’ cracked Gauntlet under the capable protection of Natasha and Rocket, ducking out of the hut’s low doorway and blinking in the harsh noon sunlight. He was aware of Tony following him out, a little surprised that the billionaire wasn’t choosing to stay and nerd out with the others.
,” Tony sang back; the two grinned at each other. Lost as he was, at least this esoteric exchange wasn’t science-related. Somehow Steve had never heard Tony sing before. New detail: he had a pleasant voice.
Of course, Tony would have already figured it out, would have seen instantly Steve’s cowardly part in this betrayal, but here he was, almost calm, giving Steve a chance to explain. Asking Steve for a way out of this.
Rhodey hesitated. He was already dead, Tony thought in a blinding stab of panic, he died a year ago and nobody told me. “Rhodey…” Tony felt his breath catch, a warning sign of what was to come.
Tony reached out and traced his fingertips along Steve’s face, across his closed eyes. Blond eyelashes. “I’ll mark you yet.”
As if disturbed by Steve’s gaze, Tony finally stirred, stifling a suspiciously authentic yawn. They’d been flying in total silence for over an hour. Perhaps he really had been asleep. The other man stretched, catlike despite the suit, then leaned over and switched off stealth mode.
The super-soldier froze at his touch, silent; then he grabbed onto Tony’s encircling arms as if he were drowning, and they sat together wordlessly, watching as the sun set the horizon ablaze in one last wash of ecstatic color.
Another time jump brings another memory of that touch on his wrist, of dark eyes and careless whispers. Steve makes no attempt to resist when the guards surround him, their eyes widening at the sight of Mjolnir in his grasp. He meets the Queen, her eyes sharp with kindness, before this world’s Thor comes charging in, his cheery confusion filling the room. Steve relates what he was told of the Convergence, of London, of the Dark Elves’ awakening.
“Yes,” Tony said, and how fitting that their last conversation was an argument. He raised his voice. “The price is a life, right? So I do this, Steve gets the Stone. That’s the bargain.”
“Stark asked what I knew about the Soul Stone,” Doctor Strange answered. “Which unfortunately isn’t much. I don’t believe it has ever made its way to Earth.”
Yet there were still tears in her eyes. “I’m sorry too. But after you left Earth, I made a decision, Tony.” And she held up her left hand.
One last time, he uses the Space Stone, returning to the very place his real life began. Steve steps into the carefully calculated darkness of the warehouse, nanobots obscuring his face to avert recognition, altering his uniform to match. Yet there is no one to see him as he replaces the Tesseract and leaves. There is no one to notice him while he makes his way to Peggy’s office and lays the letter on her desk, thick with details of Bucky’s capture, Hydra’s infiltration of SHIELD, this Steve’s location in the ice.
“Adding another Stone is going to kill you.” No shit, Tony thought. “Perhaps we can… If I take your hand out…”
So Steve thought it best to apologize, untangled himself and pushed Tony away to a safe distance so he could properly say how sorry he was for bothering him, but Tony’s face kept doing a strange crumpled thing so that didn’t help either, Steve’s teeth beginning to chatter from the seeping cold while he begged for Tony to forgive him, told him all the best ways to forget him. But no matter what Steve said, there was Tony, waiting and listening until he ran out of words again; then he was gathering Steve back in his arms and Steve didn’t know where else to go so in the end he just let Tony carry him through, the other man holding his body close, murmuring soft words in his ear. Warm words. Impossible words. Steve knew he should keep himself awake, should listen to the words until he believed, until he deserved, but there was so much wrapped up in them that he couldn’t quite reach, and he was so tired. He was just so goddamn tired.
Yet he had no time to waste on speculation. If he didn’t act now, Tony would leave without him and probably never think about him again-
Of course, Tony has the answers. “Well, red is the classic, right? True love, passion, all that jazz. Orange can mean either pride or desire, pink is gratitude and admiration. Ivory roses mean richness and perfection, so obviously they’re the flower equivalent of me-”
“I know. I know, Steve. But it’s too much, this way. You have to stop. Wait for us to figure out how to help you.”
“You were protecting me,” the super-soldier said, his voice dull. “This whole time, that’s why you didn’t… that’s why you stayed.”
Thanos hesitated, then marched towards her, throwing a punch at her face. A punch which the glowing woman casually caught in her glowing hand. “I’m Carol, by the way,” she said, peeking past the nonplussed alien to meet Tony’s gaze. “Nick says hi.”
“He’s fine. I told him to go eat, and your friends too. They kinda looked like they needed a break.”
“That’s not what I meant.” Tony leaned back, aware he had to say it out loud, at least once. “Spider-Man was with me.”
, Tony thought. Then he was back on the chair, Strange ordering him to dismiss the suit and breathe slowly as something warm was wrapped around him.
that Tony might have cried were it not for the catastrophic emergency that had been initiated by Steve not moving anymore that left Tony thinking he might genuinely expire in the next ten seconds.
“Your bloodwork also shows that you are,” May picked up his chart again, “dehydrated, exhausted, borderline malnourished. Your pancreas and heart are overworked, your liver and kidneys are barely functional.”
Steve had been appalled to realize that this had always been Stark’s plan, but for whatever reason the man hadn’t trusted Steve enough to share his full intentions. Yet thinking back, it was hard to blame him. As a colleague, Steve hadn’t listened, hadn’t trusted him enough to sign even though the billionaire had basically begged. And as a person, Steve hadn’t been brave, hadn’t done the right thing when it mattered most. Regardless of subsequent events, Steve knew Stark had paid a bitter price for Steve’s own mistrust, being the one Zemo had sought to destroy.
. Technically, after Germany, he was a war criminal. There was a larger than zero possibility that Tony was on the phone right now organizing Steve’s delivery to the Raft. Yet if that was the case, Steve would comply. His concerns about the Accords notwithstanding, he needed to show he was serious about making amends. If the cost of keeping the Avengers intact was his own incarceration, then so be it. From now on, he’d do whatever it took to keep the team together, even if that meant leaving his fate in Tony’s hands.
Luckily, Steve has an answer prepared. “Because your world got screwed the second Loki escaped with the Tesseract. There’s no telling how much danger he poses, even with Thanos neutralised.” He looks around the table, halfway believing his own words. “I’m here to help clean up our mess.”
Steve raised his head, all the better to glare at him. “Bullshit,” he said fiercely. “I said that stuff to hurt you because sometimes I’m an asshole. And that’s the real goddamn truth.”
They return to Wakanda, Tony, Bruce and Shuri working long hours to crack the formula. With T’Challa’s permission, Steve sits in the restored garden, peaceful amid the flowers. He watches the people work, summoning life and beauty from empty dirt. He wonders at their power, but they laugh and say life is born knowing how to live. So long as nothing gets in the way, time will do the rest.
“In case you’re wondering,” Tony says, “I know.” There is no need for questions, not here in this odd dream. “The way you talked about him… The way you looked at me.” Tony hesitates. “I’ve always known.”
“Brought you something,” Tony said. He retrieved Steve’s sketchbook from the bag, tempted to throw it at his idiot smiling face but tossing it onto Steve’s stomach instead. The super-soldier’s eyes flew open and he sat up in surprise. He stared at the sketchbook so long that Tony was beginning to wonder if he’d done something wrong.
Leaving a sprawled Steve extinguished on the bed, Tony got up to fetch a wet cloth from the bathroom, surprised to discover he was still wearing his left shoe. That seemed a worthy testament to the urgency of recent events, but for dignity’s sake, he kicked it off before returning to bed. As he finished wiping them both down, Steve’s eyes fluttered open. “Tony? Are you… Was that okay?” he asked, his words slurring together.
As Thor explained the recent happenings in space, all the talk of prophecies and Infinity Stones and interplanetary genocide made the Accords conflict seem so unbelievably petty in comparison. Tony tried to listen carefully, his mind reeling, but as the scale of the threat facing them became clear, he felt a wave of hopelessness so pure that he couldn’t speak. His silence didn’t go unnoticed, judging by the glances he could feel from the others. Especially Bruce. But thankfully no one pressed him to contribute.
“Yeah well, mission accomplished,” Tony muttered darkly; immediately regretting the dig, he brushed his hand over Steve’s cheek in apology, and the other man pressed into the contact, leaning in with just a touch of desperation. Tony had the thought that maybe there’d been enough revelations spilled for one day, was in fact about to change the subject when another realization scattered his intentions. “Hold up… in Germany, right after I told you Pepper had left me… for a minute there it looked like you were really gonna sign the Accords.”
Pepper squeezed his hand. Kind. Wrong. Why? “I just wanted to let you know, I called off the wedding as soon as Tony left on that ship. So whatever you two have been up to these past six months, he’s not… He’s free to figure it out.”
The serum. It felt a week ago. Steve reached out and swatted him gently on the nose. “Nuh-uh. Bad Tony.” The billionaire looked scandalized, but Steve was already halfway out the door. All these weeks, he’d felt the growing sense that there was something urgent he was missing within the strange soothing peace they had established; that the future lay coiled in some vast unfathomable wave towering above him and Steve could do nothing but wait for it to fall; now, it seemed, the time of waiting may be over. If it truly was time to act, well, action was always what Steve did best. If there could only be one path to saving the world, he knew in his heart that Tony would find it now.
But maybe Tony could help him stay safe. “Strange, could you open a portal to the Compound?” he asked, his voice sounding odd in his own ears. The Doctor raised an eyebrow but complied with a lazy wave. “Friday, unlock 17-A.”
And in a numbing burst Steve saw, too late, the vicious edges of Tony’s revenge. Understood the depths of the abyss the other man had now opened between them. The revelatory night they had just shared had been nothing but a trap, one Steve had marched into willingly, too eager to show trust, too desperate to risk caution.
Steve stepped back and grabbed the billionaire by the shoulders. “You are not facing Thanos alone,” he said desperately, scrutinizing Tony’s face for a sign that his words were getting through. “Not now, not ever.”
A few days after his talk with Strange, Tony asked Friday to calculate the odds not only of Steve’s successful revival, but also of Steve remembering everything that had happened up until his death. When it took her a week just to estimate how long it would take her to complete the calculation, he figured he was better off not knowing.
?” he spat out. “It’s the end of the goddamn world, you’d think Stark of all people would get out of bed on time.”
“Hi, Captain Rogers, it’s Doctor Lewis,” he said brightly. “We haven’t actually met before but I work with Doctor Cho, she sent me down to get just a couple more samples from you. Won’t take a minute, if that’s okay?”
, holy and free. Over time, Steve had found his own path to the wilderness; there he had found the artist waiting, impatient, beyond control, but somehow, miraculously, his; in that wild place, Steve had made his home, building deep roots amid the mysteries.
, thought Steve. Unable to speak, he just stared at Tony, a fuzzy sort of sunshine rising within him.
It was nothing revelatory. Tony and Bruce would assist Shuri in the lab until there was trouble, at which point, Okoye and T’Challa would marshal the Wakandan defenses. Tony was not surprised when Barton chose to accompany Wanda and Vision as personal security detail, but somehow he hadn’t expected Romanoff to do the same. The two women had grown close in the past few years, he supposed. Yet perhaps Romanoff had more personal motivation, as she subtly maneuvered Bruce aside for a private chat. For his part, the scientist looked endearingly eager to participate in said chat, her low voice drawing him in closer and closer.
“No, no, hey, I’m happy to help out anytime-” the kid insisted miserably from behind them, but the lingering battle-rush had already sent the situation rocketing towards dangerous and Stark was squaring up to Steve like it was their first fight on the Helicarrier all over again.
After a quick examination, it transpired his blood sugar was dangerously low, and the medical staff refused to let him back near Steve until he ate something. Since Steve was still unconscious, Tony had reluctantly surrendered to their demands. May brought him to a quiet staff canteen where she made sure no one bothered him. She also insisted on supervising his every bite, which proved to be something of an ordeal until Peter joined them partway through the meal. The kid swore he was just there to keep them company but he greedily devoured every morsel Tony managed to sneak to him under May’s notice. When Tony finally realized May had been sneaking her own food onto Tony’s plate in turn, Peter laughed so hard he nearly choked. Between the food and the teasing, for a few minutes Tony felt pretty good.
But, fuck, because there went his mind with the same old bullshit, trying to play the same old tricks. Setting himself up again as the lone judge and jury and defendant-executioner, hoarding blame as if it delivered control, because the familiar halls of self-recrimination provoked less existential terror than admitting that the best person he knew might have actually fucked up here, might have hurt him in ways that Tony hadn’t earned, had broken his heart without even trying, because if that was true, then regardless of how worthy Tony made himself, there could be no guarantees Steve wouldn’t do it again.
“But the serum fixed me, it could fix a lot of other people…” Steve said, his mind whirling with unfamiliar possibilities. Up until Shuri’s request, he had somehow assumed Erskine’s formula was an unreachable part of his past. A relic, buried in time. Not something that could affect any future but his own. But it would be selfish of him to keep such an opportunity to himself.
“But I want you to know I’ll always be your friend, Tony,” Steve told him. “Even if you’re no longer mine.”
- instead he felt an inexorable tide rise within him, despair spilling from his mouth, secret words, wrong words.
Thor and Bruce were standing slightly behind the rest. The scientist had one hand on his own chest and one hand on Thor’s, and vice-versa. They both had their eyes closed and were counting breaths together, slow inhales, longer exhales. A fond smile came to his lips as Steve watched the unlikely pair meditate together. Bruce had been instrumental in those early days for getting Thor back on his feet, but truly the scientist had been nothing short of a revelation to Steve in the long weeks since the Devastation. His determination to keep helping in the face of futility was a beacon of reassurance to them all, gently guiding them through the most hopeless days, but more than that, his steady calm had proved by example that it was possible to keep some kind of equilibrium within the madness. Years of practice, he’d quipped once, and Steve had felt a hot sting of tears as he thought about how hard-won that wisdom had been. The scientist’s quick mastery of Jane Foster’s research on the Bifrost had helped Thor plead his case to the others, but for Steve, Bruce’s inclusion on the strike team was already a no-brainer, regardless of the Hulk’s ongoing refusal to emerge.
She joins him, shoulder to shoulder, silent until she sighs. “Such power in your possession, Captain, and yet here you stand on the sidelines. Are you not at all tempted to use it?”
“Even I find it hard to read you lately,” Natasha admitted. “You were always a closed book, but now it’s almost a blank page.”
?” Tony asked for the third time since their arrival, the words erupting despite his obvious efforts to contain them.
“You mean Tiberius?” Bruce asked. An involuntary shudder ran down Steve’s spine and he clenched his jaw, trying to drag his focus back to the meaningless words on his screen.
“Jeez, Tony,” his friend complained. “Give me a heads up or something before you do that Nosferatu shit, maybe?”
“I’d like to say it’s because you asked me to,” Tony said dully. “But maybe I just couldn’t face the fight, I don’t know.”
“Yeah, well…” Shuri shrugged, clearly trying not to show how much the setback pained her. “Hopefully the other me will figure something out.”
“Actually,” Rogers says, “I’m early.” Then he tosses Loki’s scepter to a surprised Thor and looks around the table, his blue eyes dark with unspoken emotion.
These days, he liked to build his own traditions, with a daily routine that ran from morning coffees to bedtime lullabies, and a calendar inked with birthdays and anniversaries. Even the tattooed ring on his finger, which this time had lasted a full seven months. Each experience was composed of mere moments, bubbles of perfection so fragile and rare he hardly dared blink, yet Steve had learned; time would bring more of everything if he let it. Hoarding the details meant holding on too hard to what was already gone, meant he was using his strength in the wrong direction, and sometimes even happiness could get in the way.
was the string he hung everything on? That I’d just up and throw myself into mortal danger at the opportune moment?
Nearby, someone cleared their throat, but neither looked away. “We need to begin now, Captain Rogers.”
“I have to go,” Tony blurted, and ended the call. He stared at the inert icon on the nano-display, flushed with immediate regret. “Friday, send follow-up text: Sorry, darling, had to run. Duty calls, you know how it is. See you on Sunday.” He paused. “I love you. End text.”
And there was more to look forward to, Tony realized, so much more than he knew how to believe, but whatever problems that came their way, whatever their mistakes and fears and doubts, he and Steve could tackle them together. In their shared future, there would be hard days and heartaches and long, difficult conversations, but he also knew there would be no hidden debt to fear, no cost to silently reckon.
, ready, his cheek so soft and warm and real against Tony’s fingertips. The other man closed his eyes and leaned helplessly into the contact with a groan; Tony felt some trapped twisted thing within him, half-buried, half-prized, finally surrender to peace.
“Alright,” Rogers announced as he stood up, the others as usual springing to attention at his every twitch. “I’ll keep a full team with me in New York to protect the Time Stone. Everyone else will head to Wakanda to work on the Mind Stone and coordinate the planetary defenses. Thor will use the Space Stone to bring us the Reality Stone. By the time he returns, we will hopefully have a way to neutralize these things.”
Tony, as always, had an infinite supply of questions, but none were relevant to their current mission and so he shook his head. He supposed he should have been relieved that Thanos had not sabotaged their plan beyond salvage, but something about the idea of an Infinity Stone with
Part of a deep hidden canyon lay spread before them, two wide and shallow rivers plummeting over the cliffs at each end. The falls of water were delicate, ethereal, spreading misty angel wings over the greenery far below. The sun sent glimmering rainbows playing around the edges. Steve stood and stared, all eyeballs, drinking in the sight as though he could swallow it whole.
The confirmation dislodged something within Tony, his rage now a steady inferno, snatching the opportunity to burst free. “Funny you should say that,” he snarled. “I seem to recall plenty of suffering when you were sobbing that I broke your heart.”
Steve opened his eyes, screaming, his very bones torn asunder by some unseen monster, but Tony was there again, which was how Steve knew he was still dreaming, was trapped in a nightmare both fluorescent and horrible, machines and tubes curling around him, blank-faced strangers carving him apart and Tony was there, standing in the door, so far away and Steve couldn’t reach, could never
The other man drew back, then paused, intense. Focused. “Steven Grant Rogers,” he said huskily, and it was all Steve could do not to moan out loud. “Do you want to fuck me?”
Into the silence, Steve Rogers stepped forward, shield raised. “We will remember him ourselves,” he told Thanos, his voice calm and strong. “Right after we defeat you.”
Steve pauses. Tony is silent. He wonders if it feels weird, hearing Steve say goodbye to someone he will never be.
Rocket took one look at the billionaire and turned to leave. “I’m guessing there’s only one captain for this job,” the raccoon said, stabbing his thumb over his shoulder at Tony and giving Steve a significant glare on his way out. Thor elected to say nothing but clapped Steve on the arm and smirked before he too left the lab.
The second winter passes, and disaster strikes; Clint’s family. Nat calls, voice trembling. Kidnapped. They go. Steve fights, Tony rescues, and it’s not so bad, not until Steve gets home and the shaking starts. Tony holds him safe, and it’s not so bad. He wakes early and goes to the garden, digs his fingers into empty earth. Life will grow. Tony appears, shivering. California chill. Steve teases. Tony complains. They go back to bed.
The small room seemed enormous in the silence. Tony pulled off his sunglasses and sank onto a nearby couch, knuckling at his eyes. After the successful launch last week, he’d planned to catch up on his sleep, look strong and rested for the cameras. He’d spent every night instead staring at the ceiling stains in his tacky hotel room, trying not to think of the date, listing reasons to not break open the minibar. He’d somehow managed to stay sober despite the endless boredom, managed to stay alert despite the seeping exhaustion, until now. Halfway through the busiest day he’d had all year, and his body was beginning to crash.
“I wanted you to know exactly what you broke,” Tony said, and the disdain was back in his eyes, and the terror was back in Steve’s throat, because these couldn’t be Tony’s words, no, there had to be some mistake,
That awful huffing noise emanated from the faceless man again, and Tony suppressed a shudder. Steve was a living picture of fury, raising his shield as if to strike his old nemesis. “You dare laugh?” the super-soldier questioned him, voice lethal.
“Get him to the Sanctum,” Tony ordered. It was the last thing he had the breath to say for some time, as from that point on the fight with Thanos got… weird, and frantic, and terrifying, and did he mention weird? Reality morphed and changed, the ground itself rippling like liquid, cars launching themselves into the sky. Tony had to sacrifice a third of his nanobots deflecting several purple blasts from the golden glove before the fleet of drones he’d summoned finally arrived from orbit. Yet with one lazy wave, Thanos had turned each drone into a ginormous fanged butterfly and sent them chasing after Scott and Hope, which was just rude.
“On it, boss,” the AI answered. Tony took the opportunity to walk over to the wide window, admiring the summer sprawl of the ivy outside, his thoughts drifting towards the evening. A discreet chime brought his attention back into the room. “Incoming call from Peter Parker,” Friday announced.
“Well, now, that kinda sounds like a good story,” Tony said, his dark eyes crinkling into a genuine smile.
Much, much later, Steve heard a soft tread on the stairs. A numb sort of exhaustion swept over him, but he shot to his feet anyway, squinting against the sudden glare of lights around him.
Steve felt the hot humiliating sting of tears but clenched his jaw against their release, desperately ordering himself to hold it together, at least until he was alone.
“Sometimes he terrifies me,” May admitted. “Sometimes, I look at him and I am so scared for his future that I can’t remember how to breathe. But what Peter does, everything he chooses to do, it all flows from the very best part of him. And that means I couldn’t shut Spider-Man down if I tried. I would be destroying exactly what makes Peter’s heart so special-”
Steve sent a grin in his direction, looking offensively cheerful. “Felt like the right thing to do.”
“Good enough to make me miss you even more,” the answer came. “So tell me, when are you coming home?”
“…hoped,” Thanos wheezed, his eyes drifting closed. “Hoped it was… done.” The Mad Titan panted, opened his eyes. “Stark… You must know… There was no other way.”
Yet the harsh line of Tony’s mouth only tightened, and Steve realized the other man had expected more of a fight. Tony stabbed his fork at his uneaten food, his face still eerily blank.
Steve saw Natasha shrug. “He’s always kept odd hours,” she said. “Still gets the job done, so clearly it works for him.”
His friend sighed. “Like you telling Steve you’re falling in love with him. Idiot.” And Tony laughed. He shouldn’t have laughed. Nothing about this was funny, except he’d spent months - years? - so terrified of what his friends would think that he’d never admitted such a possibility even to himself. And now Rhodey was the one to put a name to his secret, had said it out loud as if it was an ordinary acceptable truth.
After he woke, Steve had made a bargain with himself that he was allowed to lie about the ice so long as he managed to leave it behind; besides, he really didn’t want to explain to the kind faces how his mind had stayed awake even through the first wave of freezing, shattering over and over, until something broke and his awareness plunged down a layer to a place beyond words, only pain. Even then, he wasn’t sure he fully stopped
He drinks the water without coughing. More good. Then they help him lie down again. Less good. Not… time.
Tony broke off, panting for breath. He hugged his knees closer to his chest; a small, wounded gesture.
“Enough, Steve,” the other man said, his voice almost gentle. “You get that we’re done here, right?” He was looking towards the exit. “You go your way, and I’ll go mine.”
Tony gave a shuddering sigh, then he traced a heart onto the back of Steve’s gloved hand and glanced up, almost shy.
He powered down his gauntlet and looked around. “Steve?” he asked. The other man turned towards him, blond and tall and powerful.
The other man’s hands were shaking. “It’s not that simple, Cap, it’s not- I can’t-” He eyed the door as if he was about to run.
In one quick motion, he had pulled off his visor, was standing, was leaning over Steve and then- oh, god- he was tasting Steve’s lips against his own, hearing the hitch in other man’s breath,
At the unexpected sound of the glass door sliding open, Steve’s eyes flew open, the surrounding machines betraying his shock. A painfully young man approached his bed and blinked down at him through a plastic face visor, a cheerful smile pinned across his face.
There was no other way, the wizard had said, and for the first time Tony understood why he’d sounded so
Tony took a deep breath, mentally checking his defenses. Phone, earpiece, nanite glove. Steve. “Let’s go.”
Too restrained, given what Tony craved, in this one moment, more than he’d ever craved anything in his stupid glorious life. “Steve,” Tony whispered breathlessly, “please, harder.” The other man shuddered and stopped moving, looking down at him with blue eyes so impossibly earnest and
It’s the third summer and the flowers are blooming. Once more disaster calls, and they answer. Steve comes home with a stab wound in his shoulder. It takes three days to heal. He watches. There’s a scar, and it’s beautiful. Tony agrees. Steve sketches. Steve paints. Colors, life. Summer passes.
, you can’t just cancel out countless living beings and expect the survivors to carry on like nothing happened. As if their loss wouldn’t affect everything that came after. That collapse you wanted to prevent so bad? Congratulations, it’s happening right now instead. But because of you, it’s happening
“I thought you were dead,” Steve said, “but that’s not…” He shook his head, jaw clenched, and gestured at the phone.
As far as Steve could tell, the only people who knew about Siberia were those who’d been there. In all their dealings since, T’Challa had never mentioned it. Bucky would have known to be discreet, and Zemo was locked away, probably delighted at how well his plan had succeeded. At first, Steve hadn’t said anything because he’d figured Tony would want to disclose Steve’s betrayal himself. As time went by and no one, not even Rhodey, seemed to know, Steve had felt increasingly guilty, but if Tony truly didn’t want to talk about it, Steve had to respect his decision.
“Don’t, don’t do that,” the other man cut him off. “Don’t ever be sorry, Steve, please, I’m the one who should be sorry, I didn’t…”
Without breaking eye contact, Tony slowly stripped off his double layer of gloves. The isolation room was designed to keep a pleasant temperature but the air felt cool on his newly bared skin, the contrast sharpening his focus. Steve’s eyes followed his every move, rapt and ravenous, as every inch of Tony’s awareness narrowed down to this one simple gesture. Just one yearning, wordless act.
“A lot has happened, Pepper,” he said, hating how his voice shook; her hand paused, but resumed its gentle strokes.
“He’s Rachel and you’re Chandler and you just saw him naked,” Rhodey continued. “Think about it. Before the Soul Stone dragged it out of him, he ever mention any sort of L-word feelings to you?”
“Stevie was in pieces after leaving you,” Barnes said after a pause, “but every time I brought it up he refused to talk about it, in that special stubborn Stevie way that means it’s important.” Slightly confused, Tony met his gaze, and the former assassin smirked, just a little. “Between you and me, I think he’s quite smitten.”
“What if I don’t know?” Steve was sure he’d never sounded so stupid in his entire life, but Tony was smiling up at him, no trace of his earlier cold disdain in his eyes, and Steve was too entranced to look away.
The ice turned to him with love in its eyes, smiled before kissing his forehead - he blossomed at its touch, and Steve awoke, Steve looked, Steve saw.
Across the weird bowl, Stark’s smile had faded. “Before you start with the yelling, Rogers, my suit is still on patrol, I can see everything Friday sees from right here,” and he tapped at his sunglasses, the lenses faded to clear in the gloomy indoor light. “I just had a thought I couldn’t shake, and since Thor’s off on vacay, I needed Dumbledore’s input.”
In his tiredness, Peter’s exhilarated babbling still felt like a slap on the ears. “OhmigodTony didyouseethis Ican’tbelieveit thisissocool-”
The gates slowly swung open, Tony sneaking through before they fully opened, just as he had a hundred times before. As he never had before. All those other times he’d been alone. He knew the car’s treated glass would shield Steve’s presence from Ty’s security systems right up until they got out of the car, but as the gloomy exterior of the mansion came into view, Tony felt queasily certain that the house itself knew what he was up to. And that it disapproved.
The Mad Titan was still on the ground and struggling just to breathe, the air bubbling strangely around the ax still embedded in his chest. Thor had a wild intensity in his eyes as he watched his prisoner, a feverish anticipation matched only by Clint who waited nearby, an enhanced vibranium arrow at the ready. Thanos was feathered with more than a few already, proving the worth of Shuri’s design.
“Normally I’d say no way, but with Stephen’s help, I believe the risk is manageable. And if this Cradle can really do what you say… I’d really like to see one.”
Tony doesn’t reply, just turns his face into Steve’s chest as if to hide. Steve holds him until he falls asleep, then settles him on the couch. As Tony sleeps, he lights a fire for the first time in weeks, then breaks open one of the least-awful MRE packs to heat some stew. Then he sits on the floor, slouching against the wall, and watches over the flames.
Truth was, Tony was still stunned by how quickly their supposed victory had fallen apart. Crumbled away in their hands like- he shut down that line of thinking. Rationally, he knew no one could have anticipated the disappearance of the Soul Stone, but emotionally he still struggled to comprehend that it was really gone. And the person responsible was dead. Laughing, he thought. Funny. He may be further away from okay than he was from Earth.
The maimed ship tried to spin away one last time, but a snarl from Nebula saw it dropping instead to the Earth with an unholy clanking noise. Tony thought he might be feeling relief, but it was currently manifesting as light-headedness in a way that was really annoying, so he tried to ignore it and get out of his flight chair without needing help. He had lost significant amounts of blood on Titan before Nebula had finished patching him up, and apparently the half of Star-Lord that was human was not the digestive half because the rations they’d found onboard would have given toxic goop a bad name. The hunger was getting to Tony more than anything. A few times, in his dizzier moments, he’d even caught Nebula looking at him with a scowling sort of concern, but he knew a few square meals and a good night’s sleep would be enough to have him back on his feet. Would have to be enough. Too much work to do.
Steve cleared his throat. “Okay, I’m listening.” At his words, the team subtly relaxed, to his dismay.
“Then give him antibiotics,” Tony snapped, leaping to his feet. “He needs treatment, medication, he-” His face crumpled. “Don’t just stand there, Helen,
Red Skull gave him a disinterested glance, then returned to staring at Steve. “That is no mystery. I showed him the way. As was my duty.”
After about a minute, Tony managed a laugh. “Guess I should’ve read the manual on the end of the world, huh?”
“Honestly, I’m just a little shocked that you gave it up so easy,” Tony joked, releasing Steve’s hand in order to elbow him in the ribs.
“He hates you because of me,” Tony clarified. “Because I told him about Siberia. And after. He knows everything.”
“Can’t blame a guy for having dreams,” he said, tossing his head airily, then he yelped as Steve stood, lifting the other man easily in his arms.
Steve pushed open the door to Ty’s bedroom and stopped still, staring. Dizzy, Tony peeked past him and gasped.
“Uh,” Steve said, peering over her shoulder. “What happened here?” Tony followed his gaze towards the car, where a dozen arrows were buried several inches into the ground.
She lays a hand on his arm - Mjolnir trembles - and Steve’s world dissolves into a cathedral of light, each rainbow thread shading into the next in an endlessly shifting tapestry.
Much later, back in bed, Tony confided in Steve that he was considering legal action against Stone, regardless of the public consequences it would bring.
After unhooking his machines, they rolled him out of the room, the blurred corridors sliding by in a maze of endless ceilings.
Just as Tony’s control was about to slip, T’Challa appeared at his side. “My apologies, Stark, but my staff requests your assistance regarding some operational analysis they wish to conduct,” he said, nodding serenely to anyone watching.
Trapped, Tony fought to break free as Friday screamed a warning that there was no one left between Thanos and Strange, and the Doctor was distracted, his magic the only thing keeping a hovering bus from crushing the injured Wong.
Steve was seething beyond sense, giddy with the eruption of long-dormant resentments. “-because I may be back to useless but I don’t need your goddamn
He sank back on the sofa, still feeling warm and slouchy in the afternoon sunshine. He’d missed some paint under his nails, he noticed. With the hectic schedule around the new launch - providing Peter liked his appearance in Cap #50, providing he approved Spider-Man #01 tomorrow - Steve hadn’t picked up a paintbrush in weeks; certainly he hadn’t expected today to be the day, but Nat had insisted he grab a couple hours after lunch. In truth, Steve had been too busy daydreaming to accomplish much actual work. Mind floating on the thrill of his later plans, he’d let his body splash random bright colors onto a spare canvas, resulting in the exact kind of abstract nonsense he’d usually roll his eyes at and itch to paint over. But this one he thought might be a pleasant sort of nonsense. Who knows, he might even keep it.
Steve tore his gaze away from Tony’s profile, just in time. The billionaire lowered his wrist and turned to him, his dark eyes sparkling. “Scooby Gang are on their way.”
The sound of their laughter was loud enough to wake Tony. “Whhuh?” he asked, raising his face away from Steve’s neck and peering around in confusion, eyes still heavy with sleep. He had a patch of tiny red wrinkles across his cheek from Steve’s shirt, he’d clearly been drooling, and his hair was sticking out in every direction at once.
The confirmation seemed to upset Steve even more. Over the speakers, Ty began bragging again but they both ignored him, Steve staring at Tony with blank eyes, as if at a stranger. Tony closed his eyes, unable to bear the sight, wishing he could disappear under the weight of his thoughtless mistakes, his stupid, selfish choices…
“Gotta say, I’m loving the beard,” Tony bites out, looking him up and down. “The whole lumberjack thing is really working for you.”
Rhodey had collapsed onto the opposite couch, devastated, his head in his hands but watching Tony through his fingers, as if scared the other man would vanish the second he looked away.
, and as Earth’s shakiest heroes head out the door, Steve has the weirdest feeling that things might actually turn out okay.
The thought echoed through him, anguished and hollow and wrong; in him woke the sorrow so vast that he had never dared speak of it.
Yet Nebula was striding forward to confront him, her Gauntlet raised and glowing. “My sister Gamora came with him. Is she here?” The hope in her voice was almost too much to bear. “
Natasha leaned against the door and folded her arms, halfway to a fighting stance. “It’s not you I’m worried about.”
He was on his feet, his chair knocked to the floor, Pepper staring up at him in astonishment. “No,” he told her again, as if it would explain everything, but Sam tried to take his arm and Steve flinched away, then fled to where the eyes couldn’t follow, the worried voices couldn’t reach.
The Doctor looked down at it and shrugged. “Oh, the Favored Bowl of Caelindiel. At one time it was used for scrying, but now it’s just decorative.”
“Your oxygen levels are a little low, Captain Rogers,” Dr Palmer said, frowning. “I know you’re not a fan but I’m going to need you to use the full mask from now on, okay?”
From a safer distance, Tony was again staring at Steve as he never had before. This time, like he’d never seen anything as pathetic. Steve wished he could sink into the floor and disappear, but he waited for the other man to speak, to annihilate him with righteous contempt.
“Yeah, Thor’s making it out to be the party of the century, I figured you might want to make an appearance.” Tony let his voice crack slightly, as if in sudden doubt. “I didn’t make any commitments, though. I know I’ve been away a lot lately, so if you want us to stay home, that’s fine too.” Fat chance; Tony knew the tycoon would never reject such an exclusive invitation.
It’s full summer when he returns, the dirt track closed over into a green tunnel, branches scraping at the sides of his car. Tony has been trying all day to smother the ridiculous nerves in his stomach, but walking up to the cabin he feels very much like he’s being called to the principal’s office, not that many of his actual teachers over the years would ever have dared-
As it turned out, the route to pleasure lay along many of the same landmarks as pain, and Steve was nothing if not a quick study. As the night wore on, he couldn’t decide which part he liked more, his new-found ability to reduce Tony to a babbling mess, or the tender aftermath where Tony would lie spent in his arms, the perpetual chatterbox finally satiated into silence. Again, Steve marveled at how comfortable, how
At first, the tycoon had called it ‘media training’. Tony preferred to call it ridiculous, but he soon found that the better he complied, the more time Ty would allow him in the workshop alone; after a while it was easier not to resist. Yet as the months went on, the sessions got longer and more exhausting, Ty claiming the increased media scrutiny after he announced their wedding meant Tony had to work even harder. The tycoon would tear apart every public appearance he made, confront him with every paparazzi shot, spend hours hunting for a moment where Tony was not performing his role of devoted fiancé to perfection. Given Ty’s swarm of tabloid locusts would follow him every time he left the mansion and the prospect of further ‘training’ on his return, Tony’s math had begun to swing in favor of just staying home.
Tony sulkily grabbed the sandwich, feeling ridiculous. “Fine, whatever.” They ate together, the silence not exactly comfortable but not quite awkward.
Tony wanted to resist on principle, but he really was so exhausted. “Ten minutes, tops,” he murmured.
“Okay,” Steve agreed, because Tony had stayed when Steve had asked. Therefore because Tony had asked, Steve would stay. A truth as pure as time itself, as inevitable as…
By the time Tony was done talking, his plate was empty and his blood sugar felt a little steadier; beyond that, it settled him, somehow, to speak the story out loud and make what had happened real outside his head. That other future had been comprehensively eradicated as a possibility; they would all be safe here in this weird, happy version of the world. Yet the memories were still alive within him, impossible horrors echoing through his head, even now. It may have been more convenient in the short term to stay quiet, act fine until they faded, pretend as if his phantom experiences were deletable, erasable. Convenient, but somehow horrifying; it felt too close to declaring himself deletable, if some miseries, some
He heard Tony sigh, a careful and unhappy sound. “Not today, Steve,” the other man said. “Today I want to talk about us.”
“Good morning,” the super-soldier started, then faltered when Tony started to laugh, because that was a really excellent joke. No one else laughed. More glances. Steve’s hand on his shoulder. He was being problematic. Tony stared down at his feet, where the night’s fire was burning out. Ashes, he thought, and shuddered, closing his eyes.
Early in the fourth summer, Tony spends an unavoidable week off-world with Nebula. Steve picks movies to fill the time. Not quiet, not happy. Tony wouldn’t approve, but Steve wants a challenge. War movies, fine. Dystopias, no problem. Then Lord of the Rings. He watches through his fingers. After, he digs up his garden, replants everything in different locations. Same lives, new arrangements. Mixed up. Jumbled. True. Tony comes home, and Steve is okay, and he stays okay for months. He’s doing fine. Sam returns, and they go back to the VA, where Steve listens. Different lives, jumbled, true. He comes home and sketches. He goes back and speaks.
Dr Lewis and Dr Palmer both wore frowns, but Helen nodded in quick agreement. “It is a breach of protocol, but I believe a brief contact will not pose a threat to the Captain.” Tony knew what she meant. Steve was too far gone for it to matter.
His fiancé scooped him up off the ground and dramatically kissed him. Just as he knew Tony hated. “I missed you,” he whispered when he let Tony go. “I know you said Sunday, but I guessed you would be here, and once he recognized me, the guy at the gate let me in.”
How could he not? It’d been broken often enough. And each time felt like the worst time, until the next time. As a kid, losing faith in his parents’ love, then losing them completely. As an adult, learning how deeply his life’s work had harmed the world, then learning why. As an Avenger, being considered a liability, then proving himself one. He’d thought Germany had to be his ultimate low, from his decision to recruit a literal child right through to watching Rhodey fall from the sky. All because he’d placed too much faith in a friendship he’d desperately chased, one he’d never really thought he deserved but tried to live up to anyway.
Tony paused, thinking back to the strange orange planet. “Up until then, the wizard had swore blind that his one job was to protect the Time Stone. That he would let me and the kid die if that’s what it took. But whatever he saw of the future, it changed his mind. When Thanos stabbed me, Strange gave him the Time Stone in exchange for my life. He said there was no other way. And… that’s it. That’s all I know.”
Yet at the first brush of Steve’s touch, Tony wrenched himself away, staggering as if wounded, still hacking out those choked, agonized sounds as he headed for the exit.
The worst part was that he knew Tony would rather launch himself into another wormhole than let anyone see him break down like this, but Steve couldn’t seem to stop
“Although I applaud your intention, please understand, if you proceed I can guarantee neither your survival nor success,” the Soul Stone said, delicate but blunt. “Are you willing to risk everything, perhaps for nothing?”
He was actually still awake when someone placed a blanket over him, but he hadn’t the energy to protest. Consequently he was so comfortable that he slept for a full thirty, long enough that when he woke, the plane was already descending. Tony tried to stretch the stiffness from his limbs without anyone noticing, looking around as he did. Not only was the plane beautifully designed, but like all Wakandan tech it was also fast, smooth and silent. His own jet seemed almost commercial in comparison.
In the silence beyond the machines, Steve could easily follow the soft tread of steps returning to his side; with a rustle of fabric, he felt something soft settle over him. The blanket was still warm and smelled of motor oil and cinnamon.
“Tony!” Wilson was gripping his shoulder. “Focus, okay? Steve needs you. Can you help him?” The other man was blurry but he sounded scared.
The archer stared at him, eyes narrow. “Still. Would’ve been nice to have some assistance back when it started raining aliens.”
He had stopped in the doorway and was staring back at Tony, both oblivious to the shocked gasps rippling through the room.
“No, please, listen to me. I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve said. But he could hear the defeat ringing through his own voice, doubt banishing hope itself, and in its wake came a deep and nameless terror.
Tony watched the super-soldier look around, misery threatening to sink him right through the floor. He didn’t need to look at the screens. There had been so many videos he didn’t remember.
After a slight pause, the other man began to roll his hips, the deliberate movements eliciting further sobbing cries from Tony which this time Steve resolutely ignored. Once Tony was clearly settled around him, Steve withdrew almost the full way before sliding home, again, then again, his thrusts deep but still so tender, still so restrained.
Steve looked upset at that. “I always enjoyed your company, Tony. I’m sorry if it ever felt like I didn’t. I really… I just didn’t want to get too close.”
Next time he woke, he found himself coughing so hard he swore he heard his own ribs rattle. “Goddamn,” he muttered.
It works, really well, and it hurts that it works so well, but Steve is used to that sting, is willing to pay that price anytime. He keeps talking, earnest and low, promising he will tell each of them exactly what he knows about their lives in that other future, but later, in private. Before they return to SHIELD, he asks Clint and Natasha not to bring Fury in for now, asks them to swear in Laura’s name. Clint is furious at the mention of his wife, but the tactic wins him a nod from Natasha. Steve doesn’t ask, but Thor gives him his oath anyway, awkwardly followed by Bruce. Tony puffs himself up to full outrage and declares he will say what he wants to whoever he wants.
The android considered the question. “As though I can feel my shadow, but it stretches all the way across the galaxy, and beyond.”
Reluctantly, Tony slowed as they approached the soft golden meadows he and Rhodey had passed over a few weeks back on one of their evening flights. He parked the speeder and jumped down, grabbing the large bag of supplies he’d hastily packed. Steve was looking around at the stunning landscape, still pink-cheeked with pleasure. Thankfully semi-permanent inoculation against sun damage was part of Shuri’s magic bag of medical tricks, so they could both relax outdoors without fear of sunburn. Wakanda was full of such casual wonders.
The android was staring at the Infinity Stones scattered on the floor. They lay just as they had fallen when Thanos’ Gauntlet had finally cracked into useless shards of metal, his final act of sabotage too much for the device to withstand. Nebula looked up when Tony joined her, a furrow of confusion on her brow.
Steve pushed aside the oxygen mask, as ever loathing the taste of canned air. As a kid, he’d been on the wrong end of medical creativity too many times to count. “What…?”
They followed her inside. Rocket was standing a respectful distance from Thanos’ Gauntlet. Tony let out a low whistle once he caught sight of it. “Guess that’s why he left it on the shelf.”
Scrambling. Red planet, red suit. And Tony, sweat-drenched and bleeding amid the rocks. A tall man leans over him, a wide-eyed kid at his side, others gathered, others following. He hears Vision give another message, another portal, others leaving. Steve doesn’t care. Tony. Alive, warm, his.
But landing without detection was the first and most critical step. Thankfully the Wakandan stealth shield Shuri had developed had suitably impressed both Rocket and Nebula, enough for them to spend a week outfitting the
“No, Steve,” Tony said, steady despite his pulse pounding in his ears. “It’s not awful. It’s sad, and I hate it, but it’s the truth. And please, trust me, this is exactly the kind of thing I want to know. That I want you to tell me, if you can.”
Barnes muttered something under his breath in Russian which translated to, “dear god, there’s two of them.” Then Barnes was moving, grabbing a pillow off the bed and dropping it to the floor before sitting on it. He slouched back against the wall and sighed. “Look, Steve’ll be back soon, then you can talk to him yourself. In the meantime, tell me more about Asimov.”
“He never asked,” Steve said, the words unplanned. “Everything he was trying to do. Maybe an answer to what went wrong.” He held out his hands, studied them. “It’s been right here, in my blood, this whole time. But he never asked.”
Roused to anger, Tiberius could always switch just as easily to lust, and was now unable to resist pinning Tony against the car, ruthlessly grinding against him. For the first time in months, Tony welcomed the pain, was able to transmute it into harsh pleasure; hot poisoned fuel for his own poisonous heat. So much like the early days, Tiberius cruel as a hurricane but Tony his savage equal. How reckless he had been, back in those early days. How heedless of the cost.
Red Skull shook his head, raised placating hands. “I do not seek to offend. Truly. But now I understand your quest, I believe I have good news. The Soul Stone is here.”
Steve looked a bit puzzled, but nodded. “The garden’s back to how it was, yeah. Bucky said Shuri and Peter were in there all day sciencing, trying to figure it out.”
“Christine!” Strange bellowed, marching straight through the center of the room. A blonde woman in medical scrubs swung around, prepared to be annoyed. Her eyes widened when she saw them, and she immediately dove into action, rushing over to Steve’s side.
, fell beyond the reach of acceptable, were deserving of being erased. He did not know why that idea felt so threatening - or maybe he did; hello, textbook narcissism - but that was a bargain he would never accept. Better to share; better to speak. Better, always, not to carry it alone.
Across the room, Tony had stopped on the last step, staring. Probably seeing what Zemo had seen. The weaknesses. The failures.
Red Skull regarded her, his voice almost gentle. “To proceed requires a great sacrifice, to prove your strength of will. The one before you made this choice. Yet many turn away, unable to bear the cost. There is no shame in refusal.”
Steve cleared his throat. “Can I ask you something, Tony?” He sounded upset, but Tony didn’t dare look at him.
Tony’s eyes, closing, but he squeezes Steve’s fingers. “Everything,” he whispers. Grins. “Except maybe… the part where… this hurt so much, wow-” and then he whines through his teeth, the pain, the pain. “Steve? I can’t…”
“It won’t be enough,” he said, and everyone fell silent. As if they already knew. As if they all knew but they’d been waiting for someone else to say it. Tony gritted his teeth. “Let’s assume everything goes perfectly. Assume we win, take out Thanos, gather the full set of sparkle stones. Whoopee, congratulations to us. But actually, our bad, because Earth has just permanently painted a target on its back.”
As Tony watched in amazement, the tycoon reached into his shirt, removing with trembling fingers a small card with a printed spider on the back. “How did- Are you
Time passed and he could have been anywhere, but Steve wanted to see Nebula try on the Gauntlet before they left, and so Tony was there in the hut when the android picked up the golden glove and put it on for the first time. Just in case, Eitri had made it also large enough for Thor, but the metal artefact fit over her right hand - for balance, she’d mockingly insisted - as if grown there. Nebula stood tall, gave a curt nod to signal her readiness. Satisfied, Steve made to leave, but Tony hung back, something about the sight deeply bothering him.
Tony’s mind kept spinning on the word, marveling at how syllables could fit together so well when Steve’s ribs-
Lulled by the Quinjet’s steady hum, Steve stared out through the cockpit window but he saw nothing of the artificially dulled sky. Instead, he thought back to the last time he’d seen Peggy alive, nearly five months ago. Pneumonia, Sharon had said on the phone. She was away on a mission, or she’d go herself. Steve was unprepared for his discovery that regardless of the century, all hospitals smelled the same. The mingled traces of chemicals and distress hung in the air like a warning, unease coating his throat as he hurried along endless drab corridors.
Today, Steve could sympathize with the impulse to complain. Yet he was the team leader; it would not be appropriate to get involved.
For a long moment, Tony assumed he was dead; he then realized he was encased in nanobots. FRIDAY must have triggered his suit’s automatic deployment before the blast took her out. His sensors were overwhelmed so he couldn’t get a read on his surroundings, his vision was temporarily whited out as his visor fought to compensate for the scintillating violet light around him. Then his ears registered the noise he was hearing, identified its source.
For many days, Earth’s defenders debated over the merits of keeping the Reality Stone if it could still undo future deaths among enhanced beings, but eventually all agreed a death cure would pose too tempting a proposition for other alien superpowers, and would thereby make Earth a target once more. With Vision safely adapted to tiny arc-reactor tech, Wanda and Carol were free to combine their powers and destroy the Reality Stone along with the Mind, Space and Power Stones.
Nobody argued, which was in itself a worrying sign. Yet Tony had to admit it was kinda nice watching the team relax and chat over breakfast instead of hurrying off to their endless duties. Even Shuri joined them for a while, quickly approving the change in plan and even offering stealth transport to anywhere in the world. Clint and Nat were the first to take up the Queen’s offer, wishing to visit the farm, with Okoye volunteering to fly them. She and Nat had become close friends through their many weeks running the night shift, and from what Tony understood things were still strained between the General and her exiled husband, so likely Okoye preferred the distraction.
Tony shook his head, squeezed Steve’s hand. “Hey, remember Doctor Cho’s cradle? We’re rolling the technology out in fifteen major trauma centers this year, and once we’ve got enough momentum, there’ll be one on every street corner. Steve, I promise it’s gonna do everything the serum could have done to help people who are suffering. But only in the ways they want to be helped. No fixing. And no super-soldiers.”
-the ensuite bathroom door opened, and Steve emerged, froze. Beard gone. Explaining the Steve-gone. The cold bed.
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, ignoring the oblivious amusement of his friends. Clearly, he was not going to solve this on his own. Too many variables. He would have to talk to Steve, and soon.
Unaccountably, Ty laughed. “Sadly, Captain, your reputation precedes you. Your threats are as empty as your propaganda. America’s own ubermensch, born under the fireworks on Independence Day itself.” He paused. “Why, that makes today your birthday, does it not?”
distracted because he forgot to end the call and Tony was treated to a few seconds of excited Ned vs bemused Peter arguing over ‘how many comic books were too many comic books when one was
is the easier option?” Steve said, trying to gesture at their surroundings, but his arm was so heavy. He gave up, an even steeper wave of exhaustion crashing over him. “With the other fight, at least there'd be a chance of winning.”
who first ran out of patience, sitting them both upright and swinging his legs off the side of the bed, whereupon Tony graciously decided it might be time to move along. He slid down onto the floor, ignoring any complaints from his knees and helped Steve finish kicking off his pants, revealing no underwear - Cap, you icon - and a cock so impeccably sculpted that Tony heard choirs of delirious angels sing in his head. Eureka. Hallelujah.
The other man was laughing at him, but in that golden Steve way that felt like sunshine. “Tony, do you seriously think this is my first time with another man?”
And Steve doesn’t mean to let it slip so casually, had meant to break it to him gently in private, but the question
“Yes, Steve,” Tony whispered. “That can be enough.” He swallowed, brimming with indecision. “On one condition.”
Steve tried not to glare. The other man was often rude, but rarely this hurtful. Yet it had been a rough day for him, Tony was entitled to feel upset. “Okay, you may have a point, but I’ll deal with the team later. Right now, I want to talk to you, Tony.”
But because Bruce was a wonderful, tactful friend, he changed the subject himself; Romanoff, who to her credit looked embarrassed by her part in the awkwardness, also stepped up to smooth the conversation over. By the time the crowd began to disperse, the three of them were firmly returned to merriment and soon left on their own quest, marching off arm in arm in search of Bruce’s favorite, long-lost foods.
“Not exactly,” Tony answered, looking at him carefully. “I knew T’Challa was concerned. Before. But it’s a smart move.”
Tony opened his eyes to a beautiful world, Steve Rogers lying sideways beside him. Serene, golden. His. They looked at each other as their breaths slowed towards peace. Neither considered words to be necessary.
The blue pillar lit up, emitting a long enthusiastic flash of light, followed with slower, dimmer pulses by the rest. The Soul Stone smiled, corrected herself. “We all will. And after, if you survive, we will honor your courage with any reward you may dream.”
“I can speak for Wakanda’s defenses,” T’Challa said. “But who will lead the second team in your absence, Stark?”
“How long?” Tony asked, suddenly needing to understand. When Steve had known. How long he’d been waiting.
And as usual, when Steve lost his focus, grief surged forward, spilling memories into the void of his misery.
Tony was mystified. “Uh, why? I feel fine.” Five hours’ sleep was more than he was usually allowed. In fact, he felt pretty good.
On the hill, they sit, limbs comfortably tangled; their watch marks the passage of yet another day. Yet another year.
Tony sits neatly beside him. There is still something tentative about his movements. Something weary in his eyes. Shuri says the healing will never really end.
“Is the pain back?” the other man asked, hands fidgeting helplessly at the air. “Should I call someone?
In the harsh blue light, the ghastly features of the man before them was a nightmare made flesh, but behind that first aesthetic shock lay another, of something far worse. Recognition. And Tony was not the only one.
“Ah yes,” Bruce said softly. “That time the Avengers beat up an airport instead of communicating like adults. If only Tony could learn from your example.”
In Wakanda, time slips past easily for the both of them. Bucky’s memories feel sharper when Steve is near, which helps him feel more stable. He also experiences at least one nightmare less per month for every goat they raise, a correlation about which Shuri teases him endlessly.
Patience, Bucky had advised. That never had been Steve’s best attribute. But he’d learn. If it helped earn Tony’s forgiveness, he would learn.
. His mind kept replaying their reunion just a few minutes before, right here at these same stairs. Despite their bitter arguments, despite events in Germany, Tony had followed Steve all the way to Siberia. Steve’s heart had leapt at the very sight of him, then had been further cheered by his unexpectedly friendly chatter. He’d taken it as more evidence of the other man’s sunny resilience. A sign that maybe they were going to be okay.
Seeing the other man felt like… Steve still couldn’t find the words to fit such joy. But Tony had fallen apart at the sight of him, shadows deep as bruises under his eyes, desperation written in the lines etched across his face. Steve had rushed to comfort him, but even wrapped in his arms Tony felt dangerously brittle, as if one wrong move would cause him to shatter completely, crumbling away into dust. Hoping some good news would reassure the other man enough to let him rest, Steve had asked the others for details of the victory; the team had obliged, the deep concern on their faces mirroring Steve’s own desperate worry.
Flowers bloom across the sky, instant, then gone. The water reflects explosive colors, serene. Beauty, then nothing. Then beauty again.
But this time it was Steve’s turn to be interrupted, ambushed, because in one swift move, Tony sat up and kissed him. Sunrise, sunlight.
The rest of the New York team had apparently been shown to a private waiting room down the hall where they could rest and wait for updates on Steve. Normally Tony would have steered the hell clear, but Peter loudly assumed he’d want to be with his friends in such a difficult time and Tony didn’t have the heart to correct the kid. Despite his best efforts, he staggered once on the way there. Still chattering at full-throttle, Peter caught him before he could fall, the kid’s grip on Tony’s arm deadly strong yet discreet. Tony should have felt mortified at his weakness, but somehow the kid’s easy cheer made it okay.
“He has an infection,” Tony said, the words tight in his throat. “And without the serum, his body can’t fight it.”
And so he did, leading the super-soldier outside into the warm sunshine and onto the waiting speeder, the onboard map blinking arrows towards their destination. Driving on land or sea never produced quite the same thrill as flying, but as he pushed the vehicle as fast as it could go, Tony felt like he could soar at the windswept bliss on Steve’s face.
Tony flinched back, as if struck by a blow, and looked at Steve as he never had before; there was something worse than shock, clearer than disappointment in his eyes. As if Tony was only now seeing the truth of what he was. And everything he wasn’t. Tony shuddered and his gaze slid away, as if repelled by the very sight of him, and Steve’s heart crushed inward with the loss.
Instead, Steve tried to practice letting go, because he had learned that life couldn’t stop. Wouldn’t stop. Not even for him. It had to be messy, and glorious, and stupid; it was not a thing to be displayed safe and dead in a museum, admired only from afar. These days Steve knew the deepest beauty lay not in the art but the
“-is not give up until we find it,” Steve finished, smiled, and Tony could have kissed him because sideways Steve got it, he believed him, he understood.
Steve frowned. Sure, he liked to draw flowers, but most plants were just plants to him. Even the glowing purple ones. “I’m not familiar with it, no,” he answered.
. Tony made sure to place his left hand into the Gauntlet before he took out the right; he didn’t know the exact user protocols for magic gloves but there was no way he was downloading the full installation package for a second time.
Steve’s hands greedily explored Tony’s body, found his ass, squeezed; the other man lifted him easily -
“Well, I couldn’t tell Clint I fell asleep on his favorite movie, so I hid in the bathroom looking for a recap and there was a YouTube channel with these furry things-”
“Aka the Space Stone,” Tony explained, sitting heavily. “Looks like a big shiny blue cube. Something like the Mind Stone in Vision’s head. But the Tesseract’s abilities are more about bending space, creating wormholes, all that good shit. It’s how Loki was able to bring the Chitauri through to New York.”
“Tony? Jeez, hi, is that really you? Yeah, sorry, we just got here, apparently we tripped an alarm or something, was that one of yours?”
“How about I try to switch hands? At least then we can look each other in the face.” Unbelievably, Steve flinched, and Tony felt a tiny stupid surge of anger. “I’m sorry, is there something about the concept of eye contact that suddenly bothers you?”
It was enough. Steve cut him off with a kiss that tasted of surrender then took himself in hand, and Tony helped guide Steve home. As the first delicious stretch intensified almost to pain, Tony groaned Steve’s name aloud. The other man drew in a sharp hooked breath and closed his eyes, but kept pressing deeper, careful yet relentless. It was so close to too much, but also not enough. Tony reached up and gripped Steve’s head in his hands, watched how concentration painted lines on his face, adored him. And then Steve was fully within him, and it was too much, and it would never be enough.
Lungs burning, he had to pull back, Tony beneath him; lips flushed, eyes soft. He heard Tony breathe his name, voice rough, but Steve squeezed his eyes shut, helpless to resist as everything changed; as nothing changed.
Bucky must have been thinking along the same lines. “I dunno if it’s a comfort or a curse,” he said after a discreet pause, “but somehow you’re even worse with the fellas than you were with the dames. I mean, goddamn, Stevie.”
For a shameful moment Tony was seriously tempted by the idea, but he shook his head. “Ty wouldn’t let you in,” he said. “He would just broadcast the feed of you breaking into his house and wait for the cops. Considering you’re technically on a plane to Norway right now, that could get messy.” He took a deep breath, nerves jangling with reluctant fear. “No, it has to be me.”
“Stark?” Thanos asked, incredulous. His hands were bare of any Gauntlet, as were his and Tony’s. Hidden again, or this time truly gone, Steve didn’t know. The Captain murmured discontent at their lack of defenses, but issued no commands.
Tony closed his eyes, breathing in her sadness. Wondering at her strength. “More than you have been?”
Tony stared around the room, both seeking and loathing the unspoken agreement he saw on everyone’s faces. “Maybe we really can take out Thanos. Maybe. But what about the next guy? And the next? And the ten guys after that?”
Schmidt shot a glance at her, and huffed another painful laugh. “Sorrow’s child, be at ease.” He hesitated, turned towards Steve. “I think you will appreciate my lesson, Captain Rogers, more than most. In my former life I sought the Tesseract believing its power would make me strong, but my desire proved only my weakness. In truth I was seeking protection from my own fear, indulging in my own greed for control, rejecting the humanity of all who stood in my way. I can never atone for the evil I unleashed upon those innocent souls. The hideous bargain I tried to make; their lives for my comfort. I thought that is why the Stone brought me here. I thought that was my penance. To watch so many others make the choice I so easily made, but also to experience the cruelty that is betrayal, to witness the cost of sacrifice when made upon a loving heart. Even the Mad Titan cried, Captain Rogers.”
