John looks up at Sherlock, searching his eyes. His arm hangs awkwardly from where Sherlock holds his hand, tugging impatiently. Sherlock looks sleepily confused, looking back at John with eyes narrowed from light sensitivity. He's completely oblivious to the implications of this, John realises. He's clueless about the rules, because he's never done any of it. No lovers, and no friends.
I licked my lips in a moment of indecision. “Damn it”, I murmured, and hurried back across the courtyard.
Something about this spitting and hissing creature is so adorable that the words fly out of John's mouth before he can think. “Hey, you should come with me to Harry's.”
“I deduced the ending during the first three minutes.”
The first spin I go into leaves me a little dizzy; for a moment I forget to keep track of where William is in the room. I am brutally reminded of it when I drop into a crouch and feel the gust of air from his foot, kicking the air right above my head.
“Hmm. Dance with me”, he hummed.

Thanks
talked.”
“Me?”
Their lips part. They look at each other and hold their breath. Listen to the sounds of Mrs Hudson shuffling through the hallway. Wait for her call:
Sherlock's chest is firm and solid against John's. It's like an anchor, a rock, a safe weight that pushes against John's lungs. Allows him to take deep breaths without his chest exploding.
The corner of his mouth twitched. “For the work”, he repeated. He held my gaze for a moment longer, then he turned away. “Irene!” he shouted.
I take my time to kiss him properly. When I step back from him he looks a bit dazed; his first priority is no longer to deduce why I'm here, I can tell. It's to snog me senseless. I love being able to do that to him.
Sherlock suddenly rose from the floor. “If

William looks very serious. “You couldn't be more wrong. Ordinary people aren't kind; they are selfish and smarmy. They're polite, maybe, but not kind.”
Sherlock grabbed the edge of the dressing table until his fingers whitened. “You think you can make me fall for you?”
being walking the earth.
Sherlock looking back at me. Although his make-up was hard, his face was softly shining with the light I'd only seen when he was alone with me. My eyes wandered over his face, taking him in, hoping to keep him.
Minor complication?? What the fuck does
The first thing he's aware of is the humid heat against his breastbone. It blooms across his chest, withdraws a tiny bit, then blooms again in a hypnotic rhythm. It matches the rise and fall of John's arms around the body he's holding. And that must be where the lovely smell comes from; it feels like waking up in a bloody soap factory, only a million times better. No soap producer could imitate this kind of scent, desperately though they're trying.
Hang on, what is the leash doing in the
“They did ask you to come, then.” John leans his hip on the sink.
” He turned around, and I stopped a couple of metres behind him. “
John took off his t-shirt and trousers before lying down. Sherlock stared at his body; the quiet strength in his broad shoulders and upper arms; the string of hair disappearing beneath his boxers. He’s spent the better part of an hour running his hands all over John’s skin, familiarising himself with the way he feels when nothing is in the way.
She is five weeks old and has finally reached the size of an average newborn baby. People who do not see her every day comment on how small she is; to me she is positively gigantic at this point. The changes she has gone through since birth are staggering.
“Goodbye, then”, I said. Unable to stop myself, I reached out for his hand. His eyes followed me intently when I raised it to my lips, kissing the back of it, closing my eyes against the feeling of his skin.
Sherlock    14:05
The eyes staring back at me had the strangest colour I'd ever seen. They were pale and burning all at once, boring into me as if trying to hypnotise me into never looking at anything else ever again. I wouldn't have been surprised if when I looked away there were still two spots on my retina, as if I'd been staring into two suns.
Sherlock    13:56
He is one with the world around him. And when Sherlock sees his face, he sees that also the beautiful Afghanistan sky lives in the soldier's eyes, and the sun lives in his smile. After watching him for a few minutes, Sherlock has practically forgotten why he is there.
His mouth closed. I took two more steps and I was inside his personal space, looking up into his pale eyes.

“John”, he says. His voice is rough in a way it has never been before, taking him by surprise; John's name sounds more like an exclamation of passion. “Can we-”
“The ending. I don’t know how to write about… you know.”
I would have ripped my way through a horde of men with guns, I would have silenced the rush of blood in my ears, quelled a sea of thundering applause, held my heart in my bare hands and watched it die, just to hear that voice sing.
The thief's car beeps once more and the gate remains firmly locked.
7:56:20: John, muttering curses when he removes his drenched coat.
“Of course not”, he scoffed. “All that matters to me is the work. If I don't stay focused, I will never be anything more than a whore on the streets. I care about music and acting, I care about learning and perfecting, thinking and calculating; caring about

I wondered if my choice of clothing told Sherlock something. It probably did. Probably braces meant I had slept on my right side that night, and waistcoat meant left side, or something like that. The thought was oddly comforting. It was as if by seeing me, by really
His breaths were a steady stream of my whispered name when I set up a rhythm. His eyes closed in bliss. I watched him as the tension built in his pelvis, as my name dissolved into wordless moans.

Irene tossed Molly to the side, finally letting go. Molly grasped her battered wrist.
John gazes up at him. He looks soft and honest, the way he only ever does in bed with John; when he doesn't impress John with his genius, when he doesn't appeal to John's weakness for the thrill of danger; when he's just Sherlock, John's best friend, his very favourite person.
I should have thought twice about that cough he had.
“Come on.” Sherlock bites his lip in a way he hopes is seductive, then traces John’s sternum with the tip of his forefinger. “What do you think about the most?”
Second of all, you didn't do something. SH

“Stop there”
The fortieth year, happiness seems to constantly seep in through every crack in the wall and every crack in their exterior. The sun is bright on their wooden floors and the riddle of love is simpler than John ever guessed it to be. He takes Sherlock's hand whenever he can and kisses his neck when he passes him by. There is a gleam in their eyes and softness on their skin, and their still inappropriately-timed smiles make John think about how he was right thirty years ago; he will never grow tired of this. He will want this man forever.
Sherlock stills his hand. “You were…?”

I laughed silently. “You're stuck with me, you know.”
“Oh. Okay.”
I'm dragging our old Christmas tree behind me in the mud. It's been standing askew in our garden since Saint Knut's Day, when we threw Christmas out of our house. There is not a single needle left on the tree now.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about it is that John doesn’t try to hide it. He looks at Sherlock openly, his whole face aglow with the emotion inside. Sherlock’s eyes warm from the first hint of unshed tears.

“Where the hell have you been?” John asks, letting him go.
He closed his mouth and stared defiantly at me. I pursed my lips and tried to process what I had just witnessed, but it was something so out of this world that I could do no more than nod in defeat.
He stared at himself and tried to raise his chin, imagined changing into a dress and walking to the tower. He had walked that way to so many strange men before and it had never mattered. But this time, he kept seeing my face, and had to close his eyes again.
“Gentlemen?” the guide asks from the bus door. “It's time to get going.”
Thing is, I never let go of Sherlock. That wasn't- that wasn't part of the arrangement.
John steps back. Sherlock takes a moment to compose himself, then he lowers his chin and opens his eyes. John is biting his lip again.
And he knows all about my moving out, the undertaker, Mary.
John    22:42
“Okay?”
The thirty-fifth year, Rosie gets married. John thinks they will manage not to cry, but when the brides enter the aisle with beautiful hair and radiant eyes, he hears Sherlock sniffle once and then John is done for. When the party is over and they lie in bed, they laugh over how soppy they have become, although Rosie would argue that they always were.
Moriarty's gaze flitted over to me. I nodded, trying to look less caught out and more professional.
Answer your damn phone, Sherlock, please.
I kept stroking his hair. “Then you don't have to.”
His hand slammed into the ground and they pulled at me, wouldn't let me check, examine him, – I begged but nobody heard. Maybe it was just in my head. My legs gave out in the arms of strangers.
“Yes”, he breathed into my hipbone. His sensuous French curled deep in my belly: “I want to, John. Let me have you, John.”

“It's been a long time since Moran got to use his gun”, Moriarty half-smiled, and his voice was like a haunting melody. “Don't worry; it doesn't mean he's out of practice. If he sees the writer set foot in the Moulin Rouge ever again…” He lurched forward, suddenly screaming: “
“Obviously.”
“Oh.” Sherlock looks around in the kitchen, again surprised at the even bigger chaos there. On the floor lies a shattered tea mug, part of the RAMC logo visible on one of the shards. The corners of his mouth twitch downwards briefly. “You can use another mug.”
When I started to make my way across the room, he saw me. His eyes were unreadable during the second they met mine, and then he left his spot, walking away. I cursed the drunken people stumbling across my path, afraid that he would slip out the door before I could reach him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “That girl would never have agreed to sleep with him anyway. If anything, we spared him the humiliation of rejection.”
John    22:41
Our eye contact was a physical presence in the room. Someone passed us by, and I realised I was still holding on to his elbow. I dropped my hand.
“Oh, don’t underestimate him, John”, Sherlock says with a dangerous smile. “Never underestimate him. Mycroft never does anything by chance, and there’s nothing he shies away from when it comes to tormenting me. This is why you should never trust him – he can’t even buy a Christmas present without being sadistic!”
“You trust him.”
His lips twisted in disdain. “Well, I do. If you cannot see that-”
Sherlock reaches through the railings to grab the back of John's head, drawing his face in closer to get better access to his mouth. John's nose presses painfully against a railing when he tries to angle his face in a way that will make this work. When Sherlock releases his mouth to try to kiss his neck, pulling John against the gate until iron digs into his skin, John's had enough. He reaches out to grab the front of Sherlock's coat and force him back upright.
Sherlock stared back at me impassively. A muscle in the corner of his mouth shifted, but his control was so tight that I couldn't discern what it meant. His eyes hid every emotion when he brushed past me.
The inn seems comfortable enough. They get their keys, tread the stairs, find the door. Sherlock opens it, and then he stops dead.

grunting when I try to ask him.
They stared at each other, the space between them intimately narrow. They made a good pair, I thought, and hated myself for thinking it. Sherlock's exotic Hindu Dancer dress was like a decoration to Moriarty's expensive suit. Their eyes were equally intense; Sherlock's bright and piercing, Moriarty's dark and unrelenting.
He texts her as soon as he's in a cab to the Yard. Her flirty reply tells him there's no lasting damage done.
I remained standing in the middle of the carpet, turning fully to Sherlock on the bed and folding my arms over my chest. Sherlock's eyes looked capable of killing, and would have made a lesser person scramble to comply. But I had stood face to face with worse weapons.
it, John can feel it in everything he does. Sherlock's name tries to wretch itself free from John's tongue, and Sherlock gives a wretched whimper as he lowers his head further. John sucks in a harsh breath; he can already tell that he's going to have the most spectacular orgasm in ages.
Want to get a dog with me?
“Good.”
The brief conversation with Mrs Hudson is awkward, but John doesn't care about that either. “I just need to save us both from hypothermia”, he says, and he makes his shower as quick as possible. When he gets into Sherlock's bedroom, the water is still running in the bath.
“It's strange, though”, John says, keeping his voice casual. “When she cheated the first time, her cat went crazy. I'm telling you, it's the laziest cat I've met, but the day after, it completely wrecked her apartment. Toppled the Christmas tree, broke all her plants, played with the rubbish, it even took in a rat and ate it on the couch.” Sherlock keeps looking out his window, pretending not to listen. John is unfazed: “That's justice, right there. Almost like God intervened to punish her.”
Come on, you know you want to ask

Sherlock was shivering in my arms. I looked at him, and I have never felt so useless in my life.
He turned from me to lift the bottle from the ice bucket, and I hoped I wasn't being rude: “If you don't mind, I'd rather just get it over and done with.”
Mostly I need to deal with my own stuff.
In case you missed it, SausageBird made some goregous

Thank you for the email. Yes, it is very hard for me to trust you again, and the last case didn't exactly make it easier. I believe you when you say you didn't do it on purpose, but that's also what worries me a bit. I'm afraid you'll do it again by accident. I need to know you'll never hurt me like that again, but I know there's nothing you can do to guarantee me that. I just need to trust you, but I suppose that will take time.
Sherlock frowns. “But then I have to leave you.”
“You need a hot shower, you're too cold.”
I was interrupted by Sherlock shoving me backwards to get out of my now limp grip. He sat back against the bed, and his eyes were hard enough to burn holes into me. With a thrill I realised that I'd done it – I had broken through the façade. Every trace of servility was gone from his face, and his body language reminded me much more of the man from the dance. I wondered how anyone could look so dignified and in control in such exposing clothes, leaning back with limbs carelessly sprawling. But Sherlock did; he looked terrifyingly assertive.
I am less “amazing” with people.
“I mean, do you want to come in?”
stop it”, Sherlock says. “You're inside my space.”
His cheeks are pink and his pupils are a hard black when I let him go.
John strokes his back soothingly, grazing his fingers across the miles of sweaty skin. He could stay here forever, with this tiny ball of tousled and sated genius detective.
“Hrm, yeah. Like I said. It smelled nice.”

All words but one. If only the reader could see the way my fingers shake over that name. If they could sense the way my eyes fill with tears when I look at its beautiful shape on the paper. If they had any idea how long it takes me to bring myself to type it.
John had offered to come with Sherlock, of course. But really, he had to stay at home. The bathroom renovations were due to be be finished the same week, and at least one of them needed to be there to oversee the proceedings. Also, Sherlock had been in contact with an old beekeeper who had agreed to sell Sherlock her equipment and empty hives, and it had to be collected that same week. Sherlock had asked John to do it for him and gone away, not really grasping how long a week would be without his husband.
A heavy grunt, and a moment of time standing still. In the middle of the floor stood Gregory, eyes wide with shock, and Sherlock caught limply in his arms.

His forehead tasted like salt when I kissed it. His mouth tasted like cold air. He didn't move for a long time, and just when I thought he was too tired to speak, he said it again:
guest?” Sherlock repeats.
“Uh, I think you missed something important here. You see, but you don't observe.”
But that was before he had allowed himself to be seen. That was before he had stood on top of the world, feeling the wind blow into his face and let himself imagine flying. That was before he had opened up his chest for me and let me cradle his heart in my hands, exposing every beat of life inside him for me.
“Why?”
I grin helplessly at his back. William lies down on my bed and I slip in under the blanket.

People have suddenly started telling me to
“Yeah”, I croaked, and suddenly he was right before me, far too close. Looming over me, his eyes stone-hard but shifting, shimmering undersea-rainbows, roving over my face. He breathed heavily through his nose and his air brushed my face. It smelled divine. I felt myself stupidly lick my lips and he watched the movement. He watched everything, he saw…
“Oh my god”, John answers, stroking his back lightly.
Sherlock almost didn't flinch at his name. “I don't care.”
John    16:19
Before Moriarty could answer, Sherlock grabbed the lapels of his suit and tugged him violently forward. He dragged him along until they hit the bed and toppled down onto it, Sherlock on his back and Moriarty on top of him. “I can't wait any more”, Sherlock whined breathlessly. “Take me!”
Well hello again! Time for the next few chapters. This one is set later the same day as the previous chapter - that is, the morning after John went to Sherlock and ended up having sex.

There are days when I wonder why anyone would bother with me. I have seen so many wars now, wars without winners and losers, with only wounds and corpses. It does things to a person. It sucks the life right out of you, if you're not careful.
after last chapter, you absolutely HAVE to do it now! The contest between the two young men in that clip is 100% what inspired me to let John and William do the same. That sort of contest wasn't/isn't actually held on the dance floors the way I wrote it – this was purely for self-gratification.
“Right. I bought a few plants and did research on where to plant them, and how. That bloke on the beekeeping blogwrote about different flowers for different seasons, so I started with the ones that bloom now. Wanted it to look nice when you got back home.”

“Oh.”
“Why do you keep stating the obvious?”
Thompson was vibrant with the spring. We let her loose. She splattered wet snow on our trousers. Sherlock didn't manage to say anything about it. Neither of us had a voice.
Of course, I wouldn't do that to you.
You know you can talk to me about this.
and she is happy to help when I need it. SH
I looked around, feeling confusedly out of place. To my left I discovered Stamford, watching me knowingly. I opened my mouth to speak, but then he raised his arm, handing me my cane.
The limited range of motion makes something light up in Sherlock's nervous system, starting at his neck and shuddering down all the way to his toes. The softness of the sofa cushions is familiar beneath Sherlock's back but the weight of John's body, half on top of him, is decidedly not. The contrast is dizzying.
Sherlock    14:13
He trusted my judgement enough to walk up the flight of stairs to Stamford's flat wearing his dressing gown. And it was one of the most perfect things I have ever seen, Sherlock sitting next to Stamford by the piano, looking soft and private, singing

- No, this is stupid.
He did not look like someone who had nearly fallen to his death but one hour before. He looked too gorgeous to be alive in the first place. His sharp features were even more cutting with the shadows highlighted by his black garments, and his crimson mouth outshone the red velvet in the room.
I smiled when I sang the end of the song. I no longer cared about any imperfections in my voice, didn't care about anything besides making my song heard.
“Mycroft”, he mutters.
“Yes, Doctor”, Sherlock breathes, and shocked at his own daring, he drops his hands to his fly and unzips it.
“Oh. It's not important.” I rose to my feet. “It can wait until tomorrow.”
“Sherlock?” he tries. Sherlock’s nose twitches, which John takes as a good sign. “Dinner’s served.”
Thought that's what I was supposed to do.
John smiles into his coffee. “Well, I like this job. You know. Doing something that matters again.”
Finally I manage to swallow and tear myself away, turning back to the wood in my hands. It's only then that I wonder that if William looked like
So in the end, it was me lowering myself onto him. He watched me with drooping eyelids. His jaw hung loose, asymmetrical lips looking lush, and his brows were twitching, fighting not to let his eyes close. My hands dug into his pectorals, his hands were clenching and unclenching on my hips.
This makes Sherlock pause. “Really?” John can see his brain kick into gear, his eyes dancing over John’s face and around the room – likely analysing the comings and goings of daylight that his subconscious has registered, seeing details that no one but Sherlock knows to look for. John watches as he deduces that it is, in fact, New Year’s Eve, and that midnight is seconds away.
I swallowed, clenching and unclenching my fists, feeling very lonely on the luxurious carpet. “Well, I hope you'll like what I do. It's quite… different, I suppose. Might feel a bit strange at first, but- but if you're open, you might enjoy it.”

When he was out of sight, Holmes sank down onto the vacated chair. For just a moment, he allowed himself to put his elbows on his knees and hide his face in his hands.

“No.”
“What did he do?”
They lie down facing each other in the small space. Their legs slot together. John shuffles until he finds the way they fit best, where they touch at as many square inches as possible.
Sherlock's stream of deductions an hour ago were like cloud cover shifting to pour sunlight over the world. Then he throws himself at the blade of a knife, and John knows that if Sherlock disappears now, John will spin away into space like a planet that's lost its sun. He suspects that Sherlock doesn't realise he's gambling with his own life, but what he definitely doesn't know is that he's also gambling with John's.
I was still awake, fingers resting on my typewriter keys without any words coming forth. I rose reflexively when he entered, walking up to him without knowing what to say.
“You can’t say you didn’t know”, he distantly hears John say.
“Yeah – that's how it works when you're stuck on different sides of an iron gate.”
“Obviously.” He rolled his eyes. “Nothing else will fit.” He shrugged into his long coat, hiding the shirt underneath, and crouched to put on his shoes. When he straightened, his eyes met mine. “What?” he asked, and I realised I was smiling stupidly.
He doesn't look like I remember. I was walking towards him, and he stayed in place. Something was off with his face. Last time I saw him, before, he looked… young. He was recklessly alive, burning with curiosity and passion. He was never this still.
I always thought I'd find a pretty girl to marry. That was a given; never once have I thought that I might need to rethink it. Girls
, and John is torn between defending the school, stroking Sherlock's hair to calm him down, or just giggling at the two of them. He should probably not encourage Sherlock in front of Rosie, but this year he realises that they are already odd beyond help, and all three of them really prefer it that way.
I stroked my hands up the insides of his coat lapels, gripping them, pulling him in. Touching my forehead to his, letting myself inhale the intoxicating scent at the side of his nose before kissing him.
When the door shut behind Sherlock, I put my palms against it, bowing my head between my arms. I could feel his absence like a hole in my belly, and I was shocked by the intensity of it, the physical sensation of loss. The pain was enough to make me surrender and admit to myself that this was something I had never felt before.
She is thirteen hours old when I finally see her again. John is holding her against his chest, his shirt open to allow them to stay skin-to-skin. I only see the dark-blonde back of her head above the blanket. I wonder irrationally if she remembers me.
Greg had not been happy to be pulled from a New Year's party half an hour before midnight, especially since he worked last New Year's too. But he grudgingly agreed to come and take the thief off John's hands. He also offered John and Sherlock a ride, but Sherlock would never agree to ride in a police car. John had no desire to cap this night off with
“I don't care!” Moriarty screamed, so suddenly that every person in the room flinched. His face was a battlefield of ire. “Why shouldn't the Dancer choose the Maharajah?!”
“Him”, I said weakly, but I couldn't take it back, I couldn't crawl back into the shadows and hide under the illusion of an unassuming poor man. “He doesn't love
“Sherlock, you okay in there?”
At six p.m., the lasagne is in the oven, and the sexual tension in the room is making it hard to move. Sherlock's eyes are making indecent proposals while John stubbornly sets the table, and the New Year's kiss for Dhaka gets quickly out of hand. Fifteen minutes later, they are eating, and the candles play in Sherlock's eyes when he leans over the table to kiss him with another “Happy New Year”. When he does it again after another fifteen minutes, John chuckles:
On his face was that same lost vulnerability as when he stood in my room for the first time, asking only this of me. My face twisted when I pulled him up to my chest, wrapping my arms around him as tightly as I could.
Apparently, we were heading for my flat. We walked quietly through the windmill vestibule and onto the street. I was acutely aware of his body moving beside mine, face half-hidden behind the high, upturned coat collar. The twilight made the sky a deep-sea blue and made Sherlock's figure shadowy and thrilling. I was constantly on the border of an embarrassing blush, remembering how wrecked this now perfectly composed man had been in my arms just one day prior.
William's eyes gleam with playfulness. He keeps challenging me with cocky looks and boastful steps. I think we're about to invent a new set of halling moves, in which two dancers pretend to kick and slap each other when they get close enough to do it. The effect is probably lessened, though, by the way neither of us can't really stop smiling.
Yep, even Sherlock Holmes gets brainwashed by the popular music of his time. This makes it all even more wonderful, because he obviously didn't choose to do this.

I chuckle and walk up to him, stopping in the sand just before him. “Yeah. Hello.”
“Fine.”
Then he sniffs haughtily and adds: “Of course, the average dancer doesn't bother to really listen to the music. They dance in time with the beat but are too lazy to listen for nuances.” He rolls his eyes. “Dull. Tedious to play for. Why dance if you don't want to

She arched an eyebrow. “Tell him yourself.”

There's a bouquet of roses on his desk. No card. No clues. Nothing but the blatant display of affection.
His hair… yeah. You know I could write a whole blog post of poetry about it, but I think I need to just leave it at that this time.
Sherlock half-expected him to have changed his mind. John’s unhesitating welcome, even though he hoped for it, throws him off. It feels as though reality itself has shifted into something just barely recognisable.

so much; he wants to open his mouth and consume this man, he wants to hold him as carefully as he possibly can and touch him more lightly than either of them can stand.
“Oh, he's garbage!” Gregory said. “Nobody likes him anyway.”
Sherlock jumps, and the summer disappears around him as if it had never been there. He blinks towards the cracked ceiling above the sofa, and as soon as the Baker Street living room floods his senses, he knows that he has been unforgivably fanciful. Childish. Laughable.

Sherlock was in the living room. He was dressed in a pair of tight, black leggings and one of my old sleeping t-shirts. On his feet were a pair of ballet shoes I've never seen before. He was dancing.

The goodnight kisses become longer and the texts more daring. John is getting frustrated in a rather nice way, a low buzz of arousal lining his days. He longs for a warm body pressing against him – so he carefully steps back from touching Sherlock, because that would be beyond weird. He can't mix up his desire to snog Tori and his urge to hold Sherlock. He stops the lie-ins, instead leaving bed and sending a good-morning-text to Tori.
His speech cuts of, his train of thought screeching to a halt. John has just folded his coat collar aside and put his mouth on Sherlock's throat.
Also, you were the one nagging me about doing the shopping.
I keep myself from walking up to him. He doesn't approach me either. But there's never a moment where I'm not acutely aware of where he is in the room – and whenever I look there, his eyes are already on me.

I'm sure it could.
At this point I caught Holmes' eye, and he nodded silently to me to continue. I relaxed a bit; perhaps I could pull this off after all.
John smiles gently. “Kissing, for now.”
Well IT WAS. IT'S IMPORTANT.
But this time, Mikael has a plan. We need to meet new people if we want to successfully woo someone at Midsummer, he says. The idea is that the three of us go to the neighbouring village for a few Saturday dances during the spring. Once Midsummer comes we'll have introduced ourselves to the girls there and have a chance to be let inside their rooms.
“I think I need to frame this for you”, John says, his voice weak when he's managed to stop laughing.
After an eternity much too short, he ended the kisses and leaned his forehead against mine.
Stamford's rooms were chaotic. In one end, there was still a set piece from the abandoned play by the previous writer, and flimsy props and instruments were lying around, thoroughly ignored by the partying people stumbling around them. The colourful Moulin Rouge dresses looked tacky in the light from a naked light bulb in the ceiling, and everyone was too deep into their bottles to notice the clutter and dirt. The floor was stained with beverages and the air was hazy with tobacco smoke.
He glances at me sideways, an amused glint in his eye. “Yes, you were.”
I wouldn't have noticed I was crying if not for how bloody cold it was, freezing the tears on my cheeks.
John blinks. He still has not looked away, not once, even at loaded words such as
The beginning doesn't seem like the beginning, and this ending is not the end. Sherlock and I are a golden thread running through the weave of time, and our story slots into a much larger one, one too great for us to see. When I close my eyes and go back to the stage, to singing

I look up again and see that William has turned. While he plays he's moving in a slow circle on the spot, so that his eyes can always be fixed on me. He creates the music entirely based on the way I move.
Holmes' voice became as close to a growl as it ever had been: “And you are dallying with the writer.”

“'Cause I can't keep quiet”, John whimpers, clamping his mouth shut with a wary look at the turned-away heads. No one seems to have heard him – yet.
“I know you don't”, I murmured.
John looks tired but entirely calm. He watches me when I flutter about the hospital room, unpack the bag and show him the articles he asked for. He smiles at the baby clothes I present. I realise now that I am the one to have chosen the first clothes she will ever wear.
Even in sleep, the annoying git defies every rule. Even in sleep, Sherlock slots into place beside John as if he was always meant to be there, demanding space in a way that's intrusive and welcome at the same time. Sherlock's body is so familiar to him, its weight, its heartbeats, its smell, and the presence of it only makes John feel peaceful. He has slept
I don't know why they're so upset about it. This is only our second year of night-wooing, and we get three more chances before the season is over. Mikael and Greger have both grown a great deal during the winter – grown into their bodies and become quite handsome – and I'm pretty sure I have too. Someone is bound to notice sooner or later.
I was supposed to be with you. I could have helped you, I could have protected you. I can't believe you didn't let me protect you.
Sherlock breathes calmly through his slow tears and it's all so easy.
“I still think this arrangement is an abomination”, he muttered.
The hound case was such a roller-coaster,
Sherlock looked over his shoulder in panic, seeing Moran raise the gun. “No”, he pleaded, “John”, tears drawing stripes in his stage powder.

her just as she saw him. And he would say I'm stupid to worry. He would say that if there is anyone who can survive in this world, it's Martha Hudson.
He didn't join the rest of us for food that day either. I kept glancing around while Gregory took me to sit with a pair of Moulin Rouge dancers, now actors in the show. One of them was Mary, smiling widely and holding my gaze for too long. The other was a brunette wearing something that might as well have been an outfit for her night-time job, and she turned to smile at me with stark red lips.

Sherlock laughs silently, the heady scent of his air puffing against John's face. “It's not an experiment.”
“He was there during your number”, he said instead, weighing on his heels.
I raised my eyebrows in surprise. “Well, you need to work that out with your choreographer, don't you.”

Moriarty paused, letting the word sink in before continuing.
Moving had never been so effortless. Sherlock was strong and demanding, yet light as a fairy in my arms. He led me across the floor and my feet followed him easily, as if they had just been waiting for him to come and show me the way.
I move closer to the door and rest a hand lightly on the wood before I speak again.
John    12:56
He didn't look into my eyes again, and he didn't say anything else before he let the door fall shut behind him. And that lack of connection was what made me realise that it had happened. In the shift from one moment into the next – the shift from the tender press of lips into pulling back, damp skin clinging for just a second – he had ended us.
“You're not like anyone I've ever met, either”, I tell him. “I think you're amazing.”
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest and sneered at me. “And where do you propose we go?”

A pair of girls went by in the far end of the hallway, laughing loudly. Sherlock glanced nervously at them, and I took a step back into the shadows until they had passed. Then he looked back at me, and he looked naked, his bare shoulders and his big eyes exposed.
“You had your nose against my neck like this”, John whispers. “And your hand on my chest. And your cock against my bottom. And then… we started moving. I pressed back to be closer to you – yes, just like that – God, Sherlock, it felt so good to be close to you. You kissed my neck. Like this. You touched my nipple. Like this.”

Last time I saw it, I wrote a secret letter to you the morning after our first time together. Come to think of it, that's probably why I left it at 221B when I moved out.
And now, only the last, fateful hours remain.
His jaw was set and he stared at me so fiercely. His passion felt like a punch in the face and I could only nod.
No reply. John sighs. Might as well take some food down to Mrs Hudson, then, if she’s home.
Does he care about me at all – how can I be sure that he does? How can I be sure that he'll turn up outside my door tomorrow the way he used to do?
“I was worried.”
I look into Mikael's kind eyes and sigh. “No.” I rise from the bench in the corner where William and I usually sit. “Let's go, then.”
The kisses were like his laugh; inevitable, unrestrained, joyful. I fell into him, my laughter now transformed into giddy kisses on his bottom lip.

A hand appeared at my hand, lacing our fingers together. When our joined hands came to rest across my chest, I automatically leaned back into the warm body behind me. The other arm snaked around my waist as the flat chest of a man pressed against my back.
“John”, I said absently. Across the room, Sherlock was thrown off-balance by someone dancing, and he accidentally disturbed the two women kissing in the corner.
I was grateful that I had bothered with a shirt beneath the waistcoat yesterday, when Martha Hudson stepped into my flat. She had to endure the beard, though.
His entire being, body and mind, is filled with one single truth. John is attracted to him. It is huge and radical.
The street was already a river of heavy raindrops. The buildings were grey, the red lights were out, the blades spun and didn't care that the world had just ended. The Moulin Rouge entrance was empty.
“For you and me both.”
Greger narrows his eyes at me. “You sure?” I know I'm being weird; it's an hour's walk back to Drömme, a long way to walk alone in the middle of the night.

The sight of his own face like this almost startles him.
John does his best to look dignified and unmoved at those moments. All he really wants to do is overpower Sherlock and tickle his belly until the scowl is wiped away and he screams with laughter.
If you let me, I will do everything in my power to earn back your trust. Although I understand how my behaviour might lead you to think I do not take this seriously, that impression does not reflect my reality. I am acutely aware of our situation, and it is a matter that I mourn every day. Nothing is more important to me than repairing the damage done, to the greatest extent possible.
“Boys, think you can do this outside?” Lestrade.
John huffs; a combination of laughing and gasping. “Christ, do you have any idea how sexy you are?”
“Don't feel bad for me, John, I told you. I want to go where you want to go. It provides me with more data about you.” John tightens his arms, and Sherlock contentedly wriggles back into him. “Also, it's a sex holiday. It doesn't matter

“You realise that your bed is too far away. We’re both too turned on to walk all the way there. You look over at the table, which is miraculously cleared today, because this is a fantasy.” Sherlock is too far out of his mind to laugh at the jab. “I see what you’re thinking, and I push you backwards until you’re in front of the table. Then I pull down your trousers and pants. You lie back onto the table and wrap your legs around me. I look down at you – it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. I take out the bottle of lube I’ve had in my pocket all day, then open my fly. I slowly… slowly… sink into you.”
“Of course it is.” His eyes are fierce. “We will have the ceremony by the lake – where we met during the Midsummer night-wooing. Soling Jacob will be the witness, and Soling Alfred can officiate the wedding.”
She wants to return a shirt he left behind in her flat. John has no desire to come over, and she says she doesn't blame him, bitterness heavy in her text; the prawn smell is as strong as ever. It can't be the carpet and it can't be lingering in the curtains, because she's washed those. There must be some shells she never found, she writes, and she doesn't understand how the cat managed to hide them so well from her. She desperately asks John if he has any ideas, but he doesn't. And he doesn't want the shirt, either.
John    14:08
“Mm, yes. The power in you scares me, Moriarty. I want to savour it. I want to long for it until I'm desperate for you.”
Now I don't know.
The immediacy of the moment is almost too much, yet Sherlock cannot break away from John’s earnest gaze.
I don't know what William will say. I only know that if I can't have him as mine, then my heart will break.
There was a new lustre to John's skin; there is no other way to describe it. Although it has been raining all day, John has been aglow as though touched by the sun. And something about the way he holds his body has shifted.
Sherlock strides to the back door and throws it open, fully expecting to see the beehives in a pile of rotten wood or something equally as frightful. But no; they stand in the middle of the lawn, looking stable just as described. What makes Sherlock stop short in the doorway is the state of the garden itself.

He's right, of course. He knows it, and he knows that I know it. I'm not even put out by it; I wouldn't deny him the title of Sweden's best halling dancer if he went after it. But I find that I like teasing him about it. Even though he knows he's right, he just can't leave it alone without getting the last word.
“Oh.” John’s cheeks colour a bit. “I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, I wouldn’t have a problem with it, if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s all fine. It’s just that… well, I’d formed the impression you aren’t the kind of person who, you know. Who wants things like that.”

He rolled his eyes. “Dull.”
It's not normal to smell an old pillow case and feel nauseous because it hasn't kept the smell of posh shampoo and sleepy skin. It's not normal to wake up clutching a pillow to one's chest, and upon realising it's a pillow and not a person feel as if one has been punched in the gut.
“I'm going to play with Jacob. He will not be here until late, though.”
He lifts his head to stare at John's back when he walks to the worktop, getting out the ingredients of an ambitious dinner recipe. His shirt stretches over his back muscles when he digs out a couple of candles from a drawer. He glances over his shoulder, waving the candles in Sherlock's general direction.
He gives me a withering look. “
“You need to try harder”, John teases, and then they are running around the table, skidding on the floor, trying to trick each other by changing directions. Sherlock gropes for him across the table but John jumps out of his reach. When Sherlock nearly gets him, John runs into the living room, back into the kitchen, another turn to the living room and then down the hall. At the threshold of the bedroom, Sherlock finally grasps John's waist and they stumble across the floor, landing on the bed. John giggles hysterically while he squirms to get out of Sherlock's hold, but Sherlock has the advantage since he landed on top.

I glanced at Stamford, seeing my own irritation reflected on his face. On stage, Sherlock folded his arms impatiently across his chest. He had just executed a brilliant performance and expected praise.
Moriarty turned to him. Sherlock's voice was so much weaker than he wanted it to be when he answered.
Martha let out a tiny sound, covering her mouth with her hand.
“I don't
I couldn't help but smile seeing Stamford step into the director part. It was a good thing that he had dropped out of university, because this was clearly where he belonged. His eyes were gleaming when he led the script reading – and when the actors started reading my lines out loud, I understood how he felt. All of a sudden, everything that I had kept confined in my head and heart ever since I wrote my first poem materialised before me. It became real in the shape of Gregory's imposing impression of the Evil Maharajah, Molly's sincere Penniless Sitar-Player, and Sherlock… His deep voice poured melted chocolate into my words, making me blush faintly every time we reached the Hindu Dancer's lines.
“There's something I'm missing”, he says without sparing John a glance. “What is it?”

John turns his head and grins at him. “Nice.”
I led the way up the stairs, feeling my body shift into military posture under the stress of having Sherlock right behind me. His steps were quiet despite the high heels.

The room felt like a jail cell belonging to Duke Moriarty. In a roil of furious disgust, Sherlock grabbed a sculpture from the closest pedestal and smashed it onto the floor. It broke into shards and dust.
Suddenly Sherlock feels hesitant. Cold air lingers around his neck where he was previously protected by the coat collar. He feels unsteady without his coat. But he made the decision to hang it on the hook and now here he is, strangely bare in his tailored suit.
“Mmm”, she mumbles sleepily, tightening her hold on his chest.
“Oh.” I glanced down at myself stupidly, and the fairly worn black waistcoat I had put on over one of my regular off-white shirts. “Um, thanks.”
The space between them quivers with heat; dares them to step forward.
Except that Sherlock knows John didn't pet the hair of his army lovers.

John can't help his laughter then, echoing across the tiles. He calmly washes his hair while the lock rattles. “Seven seconds, John!” he hears Sherlock shout just before the door bangs open.
They've wanted this, they both absently note. Not just when Sherlock was gone and they wanted each other in every way. Any tiny breeze of the other they could – couldn't – get.

I am a decent halling dancer myself, but when William does it it looks like no effort at all. This is the most physically demanding solo-dance that can be seen in the dance barns of Sweden, and it's unfair that someone who can play the fiddle as though possessed by the devil can also move his body in this way.
