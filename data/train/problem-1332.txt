You bring colours to my life. I never knew before, that we have had a relationship much deeper than friendship. You meant so much to me. I cannot lose you again. The last two years were a time of horrible nightmares, so please, Sherlock, don’t leave me behind. Not again.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I…”John couldn’t continue, because Sherlock had pressed in for a kiss, right on John’s mouth. It was a messy kiss, as Sherlock obviously lacked experience on these kind of things.
John listened without saying a word. He looked serious.
I couldn’t… I… I… couldn’t bear the pain, I could not lose him again.
No time for rubbish gibbering. Returning to liver dissection.
“Well, or I’ll just kill him.”
"A freak who's out of his mind," they said
Mycroft knew very well, that he could never make Sherlock do what he did not want to do. With or without his objection, Sherlock would still risk everything to rescue John.
“Where? Where did you put him? What have you done to him?” Sherlock said anxiously, although pretending to be cold.
All the time Sherlock did not say a word.
“Because I didn’t warn you of that bastard trying to sneak up on you and stab you.”
John ran (more like crawl actually) towards Sherlock and hugged him. He held Sherlock’s head in his arms and caressed his back soothingly. “Ssh… Me too, Sherlock, you don’t know how much I love you.”
“Well, well, John, it’s always nice to see you. I’ve been expecting you. What took you so long, Johnny-boy?” It was the devilish voice of the man who brought torture upon John for days. The Devil in a suit. Moriarty.
Eighteen.
How he hated being alive.
Quivering, he reaches for the blade in his nightstand.
A minute of silence follows, in which John fidgets in his seat uncomfortably.
Dinner is eaten, dishes washed, John sits on the sofa reading newspaper while Sherlock types on his phone.
Now it’s Sherlock. He was special. He was not like any of John’s ex-dates. He was everything in John’s eyes, perfect in any way. John hadn’t been that in love with someone ever in his life. It was pure, true-heart affection. Not childish dates John had before. It was real, and it was even more difficult to let go.
First time we met,
No. NO!
Sherlock didn’t have plans for the future. However, his crewmen were waiting for his orders. He quietly took his telescope out and saw a luxurious ship. Without doubt, he knew it was the Royal Naval USN Victress.
Of course, he had plenty of people around him. His crew, they were hardworking and never complained. A couple of times when he was on the shore, he messed around with the women in the villages.
“Take the whip.”
But the only heart burnt was mine for you.
John Watson.
When you started to talk,
I tried so hard, but one moment of impulse made me sputtered out the words I so carefully attempted to hide, but at the same time so desperate to tell.
And it said: Sherlock Holmes.
Every day he hung out with Greg, they joked, they fought, they did what best mates would do. But months passed by. Years too. In the blink of an eye John turned eighteen, and he still hadn’t got his mark. He began feeling uneasy.
After checking that the two of them were dead, John lay on the ground, exhausted. In his fight, he had torn open many wounds and they were really painful.
. Fascinating.” Moriarty took Moran’s gun and gave it to John. “Sorry, Sebby, I’ll let you play with another guy next time, I cannot waste this moment.”
okay so that's the end. It's finished. Hope you've enjoyed it. Tho I have reli enjoyed my self in writing this... excuse me for the shitty ending and shitty OOCs and shitty writings
“Mycroft. Oh what a beautiful name.” Greg often said to John dreamily. “He must be a very handsome man, taller than me, maybe, with brown hair, just like mine. He would have blue eyes, and a long pointed face.” John would usually be too boiled with jealousy to respond.
“Yes. And I don’t have the experience. I didn’t trust my body, which clearly showed signs which I could not ignore. These biological signs include dilated pupils, increased pulse, the nausea, emotional instability. And they are intensifying…”
“No I don’t. I
John puts the blade back.
He couldn’t hurt Sherlock. He couldn’t let there be another
who loved him just as much. Sherlock could do anything for John.
For days on end, nightmares come and go, but John uses all his willpower not to touch the blade.
“Oops. Well, I’ll just wait here, hurry up. Lestrade is waiting for us.”
John would never cheat on Sherlock, nor would he tell him to “piss off because he does not love him”. But still, John could not trust himself. He didn’t know what he would do to break Sherlock’s heart on that day. That stupid curse.
John opened the door by his key, and he saw an unconscious Sherlock lying on the floor with used needles around, and the floor covered with unknown white powders. John’s brain couldn’t comprehend this peculiar picture.
Sherlock quickly retrieved his hand from John’s cheek and stood up. “Eh, eh, I… I didn’t know you were awake. I… I shouldn’t have touched you… I… I’ll go now. I… am trying to… know if you’re… alright… I’ll leave now.”
The sound of the heavy lock turning and a seep of light entered the darkness of his cage. The sudden rush of light gave Sherlock a headache. Being in the dark for four days now, his eyes were not accustomed to bright light.
“Funny, John.” Mycroft pulled one of his fake smiles. “Are we to expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
He would not love me back. At the moment, if I suddenly popped up being alive, he would probably hate me to the core, for deceiving him.
“Well we are brothers, but… not in that way. Anyway, I’ve had enough of the country walks, tomorrow I’ll set off to find this Mr. Holmes.” Greg said happily.
The excruciating agony.
John loved Sherlock. That’s the exact reason why they couldn’t go on. John knew Sherlock. He was not a psychopath or a sociopath or a freak, he was just weak and lonely underneath the arrogance. And he loved John. If John did anything that hurt him, if they broke up, Sherlock would really grieve to death. Literally.
Surprisingly, as the only person whom I could confide in except John, Mycroft was very open towards my new situation: the building up of my affection towards my former flat mate. I could still not quite get over the fact that I had a heart, that I would be loving someone. I reported everything I felt at the moment to my brother, and he listened without much talking.
Sherlock leaned in and whispered in John’s ears, “Because I love you.”
“You… are…” Sherlock finally opened his mouth and said. “a dumbass.” With the slightest twitch on the corner of his mouth.
Your voice in my mind never leaves.
(Sherlock)
John opened his mouth, trying to rebuke him.
"I love you."
As the story of us played back like a film.
Anger rose inside John but he didn’t know why. He felt devastated. “I bloody well saw it!” He shouted. “People whom I want to be soulmates with abandoned me for some fucking rat guy! How many times I wished that my soul is connected to the only decent guy I love! And it’s fucking connected with a psychopath! Why don’t you just put me in hell! If we are really soulmates, shouldn’t you care for me? Shouldn’t you love me? How many times you called me an idiot? How many times you ignored me? How many times you show off in front of me? How many times I tripped over your fucking experiments? How many times you made a mess and I cleaned up for you? Are you even capable of emotions? Of love? Do you even have a heart?” John took a deep breath.
That night, John does something that surprises even himself. He asks Sherlock to sleep with him. And he agrees.
“Fine. Sooner or later you will give in. It is just a matter of time. So tell me, where is Moriarty?”
Maybe he did care about me. As a flat mate, I was annoying, and a bit crazy, but he tolerated me. I realized I should not leave him alone. My sudden suicide must have hurt him deeply. I didn’t feel sympathetic to others, but to John, my feelings were different. I would want him to be happy. I would want him not to suffer. But I could see that my “death” drained all the cheerfulness in his life.
I choose to ignore the insult.
What?! Don’t order me! I do what I please! –SH
Right at the moment I saw you, I knew you would be someone special to me. Your name, your face, your body, everything about you, reminds me of John. Forgive me if I had ever offended you earlier today, it was because I was confused and not sure. Do forgive me.”
Moriarty eyed John, raising his brows and said mockingly, “Always the brave little soldier boy.” He approached, his fingertips clutching John’s chin and pulled his head up, “Where. Are. Your. Manners? Let’s get you educated, shall we?”
“No such thing!” Greg laughed, panting. He lay on the grass, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He grabbed John’s shirt and pulled him down too. John let out a grunt of pain, and they fought playfully for a little while on the grass.
Okay I was really considering deleting this fic because it is getting boring now... isn't it?  And... I don't know how to continue
We formulated a plan, to get John back to me.
could fill that hole in his heart. He needed a friend,
“Steady the ship! Hand out the guns! Brace yourselves for pirates’ attack!” John ordered calmly. He was desperate to cover up his panicking. He wasn’t sure the Victress could survive the attack.
“Boring, boring,
In the cab, I tried to make conversation but Sherlock was busy on his phone. I wondered what he was doing.
John shrugs off the thought, his flatmate’s personal life is none of his business.
If Sherlock can be so understanding, and yes, gentle, and not force anything with John, if Sherlock can change everything for John, why can’t John change a little bit of himself for Sherlock as well?
John is a timid guy. He is always worrying about me. Like when I skipped breakfast, he would nag at me all day and force me to eat a sandwich instead. And when he wants to kiss me, he is afraid that I will be angry. Why will I be angry? I cannot be gladder when he kisses me!
I felt weak. Was I dead?
As expected, the flat was empty.
” He tried to warn John but it was too late.
White foam was formed on the azure waters, and he felt just like the bubbles. Drifting, aimless, weak.
At last, he spoke in an overly calm tone. “John.” He avoided eye contact. “You… saw it?”
John knew what this meant. When two persons got their marks for each other, it was because they both loved each other.
“Why? Dying frees me from pain. I don’t need to care about other things anymore. It is eternal freedom.” I said bitterly, thinking of John.
It was five in the morning, and John was not sleepy. Just worn out. He knew Mycroft was here, in his daily morning checks. John croaked his voice and called Mycroft.
“No one understands me. But you are the least stupid among them, brother. Why don’t you tell me?”
He was saying sweet things to his girlfriend, so sweet I could not bear to hear. Every loving sound that came out of his mouth, was a dagger driven straight into my heart.
John felt as if he had been hit by a lightning bolt. Sherlock woke as well. He looked like a frightened kitten. He opened his mouth to speak but no words came out.
He was almost in a state of ecstasy when he was with John. The feeling, the completeness, it was beyond the description of words. And yet now he was alone again, in the dark, in silence. That was unbearable.
“Errr, Mycroft, why are you
“Yes, but can’t you wait for a moment? I am showering!” I shouted back, muffled by the water.
He was calm. Sherlock was all he could think of now. Silently, he gestured for Mycroft’s men to come in and position themselves.
It would be ridiculous to say that John completely stops having nightmares and stops self-harming. After all, he has been living such a life for years and it is not easy for him just to cut it off. Sometimes he really needs the pain to keep himself together.
I knew who my heart's with.
“Yes, Doctor Watson?” Mycroft went rushing in, with a look of annoyance on his face. “I presume that you have more important things to tell me than an outburst of sentiments? Perhaps information of Moriarty’s network?”
“Shut up, brother mine, you haven’t helped at all!” Sherlock said.
And Sherlock is actually
You are
Sherlock looked at him timidly. “J…John? Are you not mad at me now?” He looked so scared and so small, John couldn’t hardly focus on what he’s got to say. He took a deep breath and sat on the sofa, next to Sherlock.
John was furious. “Are you going to listen, or are you going to sit here and watch Sherlock dies?”
“You know Mycroft,” Sherlock said between kisses, “love is a magical thing. You should find yourself a goldfish, like…
“Sherlock. Sherlock.” John whispered into his ears soothingly. “Sherlock. Promise me, never leave me alone. Never go away. Never leave me broken and desperately missing you. We would never, ever let anyone stop us from being together from now on. I could not lose you again. Not after these painful years.”
Centuries after their era, pirates of all countries and all tongue would know of this ancient sea chanty, about a Pirate Captain and a Royal Navy Captain, who fell in love, and sailed to the world’s edge and the sea’s end together. All kinds of challenge awaited them, but their strong bond of love broke every curse.
I was moaning and complaining and not knowing what had happened, and I protested against this sudden confusion. But John was kissing me so hard that I couldn’t even move my head. The feeling was amazing, but I was too puzzled to enjoy the moment.
John could not do this. Sherlock had to go. Even if that meant John would lose the love of his life.
Five.
“Good. I’ll be helping you.” He said coolly at the end of our conversation.
“Oh, come in, Mycroft. You can skip those delicate little acts, you are never a polite man who respects people’s privacy. I am used to your encroachment.” I said.
"Where's John?" The detective asked.
John was lonely. He felt hollow. All the glory and fame he once got was snatched away by these thieves at sea. He had been the captain of a giant, beautiful Naval ship, and what was he now? A wretched, poor prisoner, humiliated and hated.
As he calmly watches the red liquid seep out, he hears violin music from the living room.
That night I stayed at her house. That was more than enough progress for one day.
I didn’t wake him up, because I did not want him to face whatever he was facing, whatever that worried him. I did not want to see that peacefulness slip away from his face. I smoothen the bedsheets and sat down on his bed. I studied him, from his eyelashes to his lips. He was like a little child, care-free, innocent, adorable. There was a strange sensation glowing in my heart, I was not sure what it was, but I let it be, I let it send an impulse towards my brain, I let it move my hand to touch Sherlock’s face softly. My fingers moved along his cheekbones, and I tugged his hair, twisting those lovely curls.
I went back to reality. I was lying in a bed, in a hospital-like place, with those fancy instruments beeping around me. Mycroft was staring into my face, with worriedness.
But these years has been a really memorable experience for me. I was a lonely and unsociable man before I met you, Sherlock. Life was dull, life was meaningful, but all the thrill you gave me, all the excitement you gave me, I value them a lot.
W…What! Why are you here, Mycroft?
“Hi, I... err… I just… want a little chat.” The bright face of the pirate captain popped in and said softly.
was how a proper pirate captain should look like.
John thought for a while, obviously still in doubt. But Lestrade merely gave him a reassuring smile and a pat on his shoulders.
Sherlock held John’s face in his palms and kissed him again. “Then you are very mistaken, my doctor. I’ll never be angry at you, well, frustrated because you are so stupid, yes, but I’ll never leave you, John. You are the one thing that is more important than my work. I’m attracted to you. I’m married not to my work, but to you, John.”
I met her some weeks ago. That was a cold, briskly night. I lay in my bed, tossing and turning, tortured by nightmares. Unable to put up with the troubles, I went down the streets and went into a pub. I didn’t particularly enjoy alcohol, but a few quick slips of beer could temporarily pull me away from sorrow. I was getting a little drunk and I was fuzzing about in the bar. I created quite a mess there when I bumped into a girl holding drinks.
I wish I could tear the sadness,
Someone kicked him hard on his stomach, and he cried out a painful scream. “Moriarty! Tell me his whereabouts!”
He felt good.
“And you’re sure your memory is reliable? No offence, but, torture victims tend to have a wilder imagination.”
John started with Teresa. It was also pleasant, and they got along well. On the sixty-ninth day of their relationship, John got into a heated quarrel with Teresa on who-knows-what. In a rage, he told her to “piss off” because “he doesn’t love her”. It ended with Teresa crying and running away.
“C’mon, c’mon,” The consulting criminal patted Sherlock on his back. “Move, it’s play-time!”
Professor Moriarty yelled towards the London streets beneath their feet, “Don’t make me furious, or you will end up
thinking.
, well, Sherlock, is it
Next morning John found himself in his own bedroom again. He was so hungover everywhere on his body was painful. But especially on his wrist.
John was released.
, for teaching him the solar system, for everything.
smile.
I never wanted to die, actually. But what I heard from John made a really deep cut in my heart, and I was so broken, I didn’t think properly. It felt to me, that I owed John a lot. He gave meaning and colour to the broken, confused, plain life of mine. He transformed me. But in turn, I could do nothing for him, not even a little thing, whenever I appeared, I just messed things up. I couldn’t even make him smile.
John pulled me to the cinema hall, and crossed his arms. “So, explain yourself, Sherlock Holmes.” I saw the anger that hid beneath him, but he was trying very hard not to make a huge outburst of rage. I considered my words carefully, tailoring them to avoid triggering his outburst.
There were sudden gunshots outside the room. A smile went across Moran’s face. He knew the professor would save him!
that you feel?”
You are being impossible, Sherlock. I don’t think you will be able to stand up straight in a week. Now you are yelping. I warned you not to be naughty and yet you don’t listen. That’s the consequence.
“Professor! You’re safe! You got me out!” Moran was touched.
The blade is put back, and John goes to sleep in the lullaby of the violin.
I woke up with a jolt, terror-stricken.
Sherlock went to his meeting with Moriarty.
can’t lose you. I was troubled by your sudden depressed behavior.” He sighed. “If you need anything, just tell me. I will help you, Sherlock. But, don’t, don’t try something stupid.” He looked at me earnestly.
John walked on the street, balancing difficultly on his walking stick. Each step torn open his old wounds and he didn’t mind. He could endure
He was dragged onto the deck of the pirate boat. He stood unyieldingly, but a kick on his knee cap soon brought him to kneel. There he saw its captain standing arrogantly. He was younger than John imagined. The pirate captain was around 30 years of age, and looked bright.
So why the fuss about dying? At the end, all of us would leave the world with a heavy heart and a broken soul.
He continued. “But John, I do wonder how, in your drunken state, could you hop on a cab, and the cabbie would mysteriously know where you’d be going to, and take you to Baker Street?”
John came seconds later, catching his breath. “Watch your words, bro!” He pretended to hit Greg. “I intentionally let you win, cause I always win the races.”
It was painful seeing the pirates bomb the Victress. John had been its captain for 7 years, and he had rather a lot of emotions attached to it.
out.  The only time when I could really take a good look at him, was in the EU. I watched him, the machines beeping dangerously, his heart rate unsteady, his brows knitted with loneliness.” Mycroft took a deep breath and tried to steady himself. “I am the brother. Sherlock has always been emotional. He needs to be taken care of. But I can’t. There’s something in me that prevents me from understanding him. It is I who put him in this state. Who else am I to blame? It’s all my fault. I am no better. Even with this intelligence, I’m still a
For the three words I had never said.
“He’s fucking hurt me. He’s locked me out! I tried! I tried!” he told himself. “I do not love him! It’s Greg I love!”
"Just the two of us against the world,"
When he finally spoke, he had really taken me by surprise. Just this sentence, “I love you, John.” seep into my heart like a swirl of warm air, gushing in my veins, warming my heart and my soul.
After twenty lashes, Sherlock was already unconscious. John knelt on the floor, exhausted, both physically and mentally.
“Since… since when, Sherlock?” John stammers.
He snapped his fingers and Moran walked into the room. “Sebastian, much as I want to let you have the fun, I have other plans. As compensation, I’ll let you watch the whole thing.” Then, Moriarty took out a whip from a bag on the floor and held it for John. “Familiar, isn’t it? Remember, Sherlock, the tender strokes you left on John’s body? Now you are going to do the same, John. For the twenty lashes your men left on Sebastian, I will double that on you, Sherlock.”
His heart had never been, and never would, be mine.
Scars, old and new, line his thighs. Doesn’t matter if he add a couple more now. He needs the pain. He needs to feel good, like he always does after cutting.
“Sit.” John said. And he told Lestrade all about his feelings for Sherlock and the thing about the curse.
" Sherlock typed.
Any attempt at small talk is awkwardly ended.
“No, you fucking don’t.”
.” Sherlock said, leaning closer, “Have I ever been angry at you?” He stepped towards John, until their faces were only inches apart.
The floor was a mess, with his coat and shirts everywhere, and some torn pages from his notebook, scribbled on was Sherlock’s untidy handwriting about a case we’re working on.
Through my drunkard eyes, she was the most beautiful human being that I had ever known. As an action to express my apology, as well as to earn myself some time observing her, I accompanied her home. We talked along the way. She said her name was Mary. Oh, Mary, I thought, what a lovely name.
would break him.
Sherlock was still out of breath, and breathlessly said, “Let. Him. Go. I’m all yours.”
Was I feeling
John woke up with sores on his body. His bedsheets were bright red from the blood dripping down his improperly healed wounds. He lifted himself up with his elbow, and a groan of pain escaped his mouth.
Boring. The three cases are not related.
"I'm taking you to meet him right away." Moriarty flicked Sherlock's face. "And you'll be able to kiss him goodbye."
Sherlock was crying too. The man he loved, snatched away from him for years, suddenly and so unbelievably appeared before his eyes. He was so shocked.
John leaned into Sherlock’s chest, nuzzling his neck. “Moriarty, you pig, don’t lay your filthy hands on Sherlock! Don’t you dare!” He was screaming so desperately.
John didn’t know what that cursed number had to do with himself, really he didn’t. John didn’t know what he had done to deserve such a punishment. A punishment so brutal that he could never, ever love someone. If he tried to do so, he would only cause hurt and anger and sadness.
Members:
Mycroft smiled. “That mark, you’ve had it the first day you met John Watson. But love, love is never your area, right? What matters is only the work.”
“And by the way, Mikey has a brother who wants a flatmate. I know you can’t afford this alone, so maybe you can live with him. He is Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes. You can find him at St. Bart’s anytime.”
A newfound, almost sacred calmness filled his mind and body. Time was frozen. He was drifting in bliss, in where his nightmares could not reach him.
Unless… John go with him and sabotage the relationship between Greg and this Mycroft.
Mycroft cleared his throat. “Well, my job is done, I’d better be off now.” He smiled awkwardly.
“And John. Your… uh…
Moran, again, refused. He felt a needle injected into his arms, but he didn’t know what the chemical was. In a few seconds, his arm muscles twisted and contracted painfully, causing incredible and intolerable discomfort to him. His whole body trembled and shook, his head feeling as if being squashed to pieces. His shrill, piercing screams echoed in the metal-walled chamber.
“Love. Love is your greatest fear.”
So I said to him, “Do not touch me, you don’t deserve it. You know what, they are right about you. You are a psychopath, and you are a wicked man. You broke into my life, messed it up, and then abandoned me like some kind of rubbish. I hate you, and I will hate you forever. You don’t deserve my love. You don’t deserve anything. You can go straight out to the streets and get run over by a car, and I will not help you. I will stand here and see you injured, lying on the road. Because that’s what man like you deserve to be. Leave me alone.”
the activity?
I’m really sorry, Greg. I’m afraid we are doing some quite intensive activities in the bedroom right now. Neither of us can go out to the living room at the moment.
“Finally.” John said to himself, walked over to Sherlock, planted a kiss on his cheek, and pointed the gun tip at him. He didn’t move for a few seconds, but he suddenly turned around, and shot Moriarty in his head. Moran ran to the professor’s rescue and wrestled with John. John knew he was weak, and not in any way fit for a fight, but with Sherlock on mind, he could feel a brand new stream of energy in his muscles. He pinned Moran on the ground and shot him dead.
What, man, no!
Triple homicide. Sealed doors, locked rooms, and death notes.
Soon John got tired of trying. Maybe he had mistaken. There was nothing behind that coldness. Sherlock was a machine.
Sherlock couldn’t believe his eyes, nor his ears. No. No! It could not be! His logical scientific mind told him that he was dreaming. Something so miraculous could never happen.
“John! There’s a murder at---“a drowsy, half naked Sherlock barges in. John drops his bandages in shock.
And that he seems to forget how to put on the slippers on his foot right now.
I was sinking in a pool of sadness. I felt the hot tears rolling down my cheeks. It was an emotion I so rarely feel.
It was the sixty-fourth day since they had been together. Five days later and it would be end of the world. At least for John and Sherlock.
John had no choice. He slashed out and closed his eyes when Sherlock screamed in agony. “I’m sorry, Sherlock, I really am.” He mumbled.
“I am sorry, Doctor. I’ve hurried. So, Sherlock, how’s he?” Mycroft said with a genuine look of concern on his face.
In a blur, I saw someone dressed in black carry Sherlock’s body away. I screamed for them to stop, I screamed for them to let me hug Sherlock for one last time. Thieves! Thieves! He was my everything! I never even got the chance to look at him properly since two years ago, I never even got the chance to touch him! He left my life, reentered so abruptly and because of my own fault, left it again, shamefully.
Sherlock is determined to save John, even when he had to use his own life to trade for John's. Even Mycroft couldn't stop him.
John, though bounded, looked so hurt and broken with every wound Sherlock suffered, yelled for them to stop. “Sherlock! Sherlock! Listen to them and do it! I probably can’t even feel it, a few strikes won’t do much harm.” He sighed when he knew Sherlock wouldn’t listen. “DO IT, or I’ll smash my head onto the wall THIS INSTANT!”
There was a tiny window in his cell. John stared into the deep, roaring ocean. He sighed. He was just a traveler in its embrace, gone in a blink. His life was meaningless, and he was sick of the sea. 7 years on the sea, and yet he desired more.
I got so annoyed and I turned around to confront him. And then I saw it. I saw him. It was a clever disguise, but, I knew it was him. I just knew it. Still that cold, all-knowing look, but there was misery and loneliness on his face. I was shocked, and my mind went blank. I didn’t know what I was doing when I dragged him out. All I was thinking about was how unfair life was. Two years he had let me grieve for him, worry about him, care about him, miss him, and love him. Now he suddenly popped out alive, like nothing had happened. And he did not even try to make contact with me. He had no idea how painful these years had been to me. He had no idea.
“No,” John said. “Stay.”
His torturer heaved a long sigh, and Moran felt a lash of pain on his hips. And then on his knees. Another on his chest. Moran was whipped, and whipped, and whipped, and he felt his body weak and broken.
A part of John wondered how Mycroft could possibly know. But the bigger part of him wouldn’t be surprised if someone tell him Mycroft was in charge of even the fucking soulmate system. He could almost picture Mycroft in one of those Greek robes, lying leisurely on a cloud, maybe with cakes surrounding him, and checking a list, saying “He goes with her, she goes with him; this goes with that, that goes with this.”
“Okay, that’s enough now. Romantic tragedy… How very sweet.” Moriarty said in a wicked tone. “But I’m afraid Sherlock has to go now, Johnny-boy, he has the rest of his life’s time to play with me.”
Sorry Greg, his phone is in his coat in the living room.
It was a cycle. John met someone. Went on well. Did something unforgivably cruel. Broke up. Found someone. And all over again.
Distant footsteps echoed along the hallway, and stopped at Moran’s room.
The woman had not a disgusting look, but I could quite get why John could be attracted to such a woman. I mean, honest, his levels were falling every time, from Sarah and now to this… well, plain-faced… hu…human?
eats, while Sherlock pokes his peas with a fork like a little child.
Sherlock was weak in the knees and knelt down, his face touching John's. He whispered in his ears, "John... John... what has he done to you..."
One last whip. He could do this. I could do this, Sherlock thought to himself. His memories floated back to the two’s first meeting, the innocent look in John’s eyes when he muttered the word “Amazing” in the cab. The joy of being praised gushed into Sherlock’s heart like honey. The voice of John, asking him to buy milk, scolding him for creating a mess in the kitchen; the quick but steady footsteps of John, always following him around, tolerating him, giving him support; the smile on John’s face, the pure happiness he felt for his friend after solving a case; the carefree nights they spent together, wandering around like two fools on the London streets…
Two years it had been, and yet the surge of sorrow still lingered around. Every day I woke up, battered by nightmares, and remembered that I was alone. The room around me, so quiet, so empty, so miserable it echoed with my broken heart.
Sherlock fighting himself. Sherlock admitting that he is lonely. Alone no longer protects him. Along hurts him.
“What are you doing just now, sweetheart? I’ve called you several times. ” I asked casually.
I checked the clock, and realized that it was only five in the morning. After several unsuccessful attempts to get back to sleep, I sat on the sofa and turned on the telly. What else could I do? I don’t live that crime-solving twenty-four seven life anymore, not after
There came the villain of our fairytale,
I heard a soft voice coming out from the gap between the door and the floor. It was surely Mary’s voice, but much more serious and low-pitched. It was like the voice of an agent on work, stony and steel-edged. Puzzled, I stayed and listened.
They came, at last. The first thing I noticed was that awful mustache. My flat mate looked very ancient indeed. Even my father seemed younger than him. Once I got him in my hands, I would definitely get rid of that filthy mustache.
He whispered my name again and again, but I turned and left.
When the canons were fired, the Victress immediately fell. However hard its crew struggled, the Naval ship was in bad shape after the extreme firings. Water gushed into its cabins.
“So,” he turned to John. “Is your wrist alright now? Not painful anymore?” Still smirking.
John couldn’t control his laughter. “I don’t know you occupy a minor position in the heavens too, Mycroft.”
Night fell and the luminous stars twinkled on the deep blue canvas we called the sky. There was a knock on the cell’s gate. John was startled.
But now? Now was different. Sherlock had been happy. He had tasted the sweetness of friendship, and
“Why should I be?”
This woman in front of me was going to bring light back into my miserable life. I was a ship that had just changed sail. Sherlock had left my life and was out of my memory. Mary had become my new sail. My life turned around her like how the Earth moved around the Sun. The past and its sorrow, I left it all behind me. I was now running a new track, and pursuing a new goal: Mary.
“I do not know why, well I can fathom a guess, but I don’t know accurately why you do that. But I know how. How you feel when you make the first cut. And how it feels, afterwards.”
“To the high in my life, to my light, to the love of my life,” Sherlock gets on one knee. “Marry me.”
When John didn’t respond, Greg shrugged and said: “Anyway, I’m moving out tomorrow. I’m gonna live with Mikey. Having a soulmate is the best thing in the world, you’ve only known a person for an afternoon and you already seem like you’ve known him for decades. Wish you get yourself one soon, mate.”
I am doing an experiment.
“Brother dear. Where’s John?” No reply. ‘Oh. So he knows.” Sherlock nodded.
“You are confused. Your heart is saying that you indeed feel emotions, but your brain refuses to acknowledge that. You are disagreeing with yourself, Sherlock.”
“Finally. You’re awake, Sebastian Moran. ” A cold, deep voice addressed him. “I must apologize for this awkward situation that you are currently in. There is something I need from you. Would you mind providing me with it?”
The thing that pained me most, is not his death. Well of course it was painful, it was painful like hell, but the worst part was how he died in vain. I could not accept that he killed himself in guilt and shame, when the whole world put its blame on him. People said really bad things about him. I couldn’t let him just die like this. If he had to die, this… hero, this… best friend of mine, he would have to die gloriously, with friends and family around, flowers stuffed in the room, plenty of laughter, something like this.
The chamber door was suddenly opened and John immediately got up, ready for a fight. He could only see the sickening figure of a man dressed in a nice suit, tapping his umbrella on the floor.
A voice in his mind said.
“Tick tock, tick tock!” Moriarty whispered in his ears. “One stroke left, and your Johnny-boy can go home. Why are you always so selfish? Your friend is one step away from safety, and now you worry about your ethics. Not an angel, after all.”
Anyway, I was used to this so I didn’t say a word.
Moriarty planning to make Sherlock break. Will he?
Okay, right. Just read through the case.
Sherlock woke up in the chamber, and was greeted by Moriarty. He saw the bloody state of John and said goodbye.
Scotland Yard. How disappointing.
Sherlock’s own cold voice rang in his head. “Alone protects me.” He once said. That was true, he was weird, he was strange. Being alone made him untouchable. He was a ghost, no sentiment, no attachment, whatsoever. No one could hurt him when he was invisible.
Following closely, was Sherlock Holmes, the arch enemy of the professor. For all the troubles and hardships the professor suffered because of the Holmes brothers, a sense of disgust rushed into Moran’s mind.
Eventually, the lashes stopped. Everywhere on his body ached with boiling pain. Blood ran out from his wounds like tiny little streams of red. Moran was exhausted. He was panicking with fear.
John snorted. “And I thought
Who made the people say, you were a fake.
John wakes, in agony and despair. It is still dark. He is lying alone on his bed, surrounding him only silence and darkness.
Sebastian Moran woke up with immense pain on his body. He tried to move but realized that his hands were tied up high above his head to the ceiling. His wrist was swollen and sore from the bounding. He was blindfolded, and uneasiness swept in.
Yay yay I've got some ideas as to how this should end. You'd love it
“You’re not angry at me?”
“You’ve been careful to hide your mark from him. Because you know, he will leave you when he sees it. You don’t want him to leave. But you don’t want to love him.”
We’ve been together for almost a month now, and I think it is time we let everyone know. I’ve never expected that things will turn up this way, considering that I was just looking for a flat mate in the first place.
John sighed. “It’s not myself that I was worried about. It’s… you know… it’s him.” He put his hand in his hair. “It is just, that feeling when you desperately wanted to save him, but this useless body, this limp, this wound, this bruise, you can do nothing. I don’t suppose you have any of that experience before, Mycroft? You’re a superman. I’m just a guy.”
Deep breaths.
Behind him were Mycroft’s super minions team. They were planning to attack Moriarty and his men while John was diverting their attention. And for diversion, John thought, meant more
"Sherl... Sherlock..."John's voice was croaked and unnatural. "Don't... You must run... You're going to die... He... he... will torture you to death. You can't do this for me... why did you come, you idiot! He'll kill you!"
Roses are red,
Mycroft heaved a long sigh. “Alright Sherlock.” He clutched Sherlock’s shoulder tightly. “Just remember, I love you, and I’ll always be there for you. No matter what happens. You’re always the cute and emotional little brother in my heart. I wish you good luck, and may God bless you and help you through whatever is going to happen to you.”
“That dude just ran onto the streets suddenly, scared me to death. He was screaming some something, something about a guy called John and he was apologizing.  He begged the drivers to knock him over and kill him. That man was crazy!” The driver said, pointing a finger at Sherlock.
Hi everyone! Hi my friends! I am happy! Sherlock is a good boyfriend! I love him!
But I couldn't find you anyhow.
One day he held the blade in his hand for the first time. He was not sure if this was a good idea. John Watson, once a man of steel, was now just a coward who could not even face his nightmares. John Watson, who used to run towards the most dangerous war zones, who used to carry dozens of wounded men on his shoulders from explosions and cannon shots, was now too timid to face reality.
! If you ever bother to remember.
“Yeah you sure have to. And there’s one present which will be perfect,” said Lestrade as he walked in. “it’s that for once you can say my name correctly, Sherlock, it’s Greg! Greg Lestrade!”
What are you two?! You are freaking psychopaths!
John’s dislike for Sherlock grew with time.
They eat in silence. Well,
John felt as if his heart had been torn out. Extreme sadness grabbed his mind. He, too, was crying. How he loved Sherlock, his arrogance, his cheekbones. But they couldn’t. They could never have a future together. He wanted Sherlock to go, to stop loving him, because John knew, deep inside, that the more Sherlock love him, the more he will be hurt. Later.
Sherlock pulled him close. "Because i can't let them kill you."
With our dear
Sherlock sweeps a quick look at the mess on the floor, then his legs, and eventually, his blue eyes bores into John’s for a few seconds, lips pursed, brows slightly knitted.
Anger and jealousy blinded John, as he swore to snatch Greg back from this ratty man.
PS: I am not nervous about our wedding. Wedding is a meaningless showcase of wealth. But John is anxious, everyone is anxious. Except me.
“Did you not like it?” John asked, a bit disappointed.
Solving crimes and chasing thieves.
A loud noise reached his ears, and a pang of pain erupted from his shoulders. He felt like being ripped apart. But he felt good. He felt saved, from the hell he was in. Finally, he was going to join his friends. Blissfully, he closed his eyes and fell unconscious.
“My best mate, John.” Greg patted John’s chest. “How I love hanging out with you. And how I love these moments with you, just lying here, not thinking, not doing anything. If our times could last forever.”
He pulled a chair and sat down, facing me. What was he doing here? Did something happen? I was not very used to not knowing people’s intention when they come to me. Well, at least for the average ones. Everything about them could be deduced in an instant. But that would not be working for my brother. He was too… uh … non-average. I would like to say smart, but not quite. I would never say to him or describe him in a word of praise.
, smart and cold, how far would he have to be pushed to break?
And… the great Mycroft Holmes walked in. “Tsk… Tsk…” He said with a smirk. “Am I interrupting anything?”
John was getting uneasy. He secretly wanted to slap himself for his stupid behavior. “Good job there, John Watson, now you’ve ruined everything. Sherlock will hate you forever. You have broken his heart, idiot. Happy?” He thought to himself, doing a mental eye-roll.
doing here? Shouldn’t you be busy battling with terrorists? –SH
.  John? Are you coming?” Sherlock was yelling from the living room.
But we will, in the near future.” He said with a smirk.
Well, judging by the physical conditions of the victims, it is a poison. Cyanide, to be precise. There are some traces of the poison on all of the victim’s right cheek, so the murderer must be a left-hander. The footprints outside the houses are firm and steady, therefore someone familiar to the victims…
“I did. But now?” the younger Holmes shrugged. “Helps me put off some things.”
I was done. I was so done. Sherlock Holmes, I would hate you forever.
Moriarty glanced at the CCTV footage inside the box. Sherlock was thinking. He was
. You don’t know what a
From your face all the way down.
AND MY NAME IS NOT GAVIN
Who the heck added you in?!
It is a cool autumn night. John’s nightmares bounce back to life, crushing John, threatening to tear him apart. He reaches for the blade. As soon as Sherlock starts playing in the living room though, John stops himself. He thinks of Sherlock. John has always known how selfish he is, to let Sherlock worry about him.
And down he flew.
The next morning John wakes with a yawn. Oh crap. He forgot to dress his cuts last night. He knows he doesn’t want an infection, and definitely not Sherlock poking his head into stuff like this. He scrambles to the bathroom, digging for the bandages. He is halfway through bandaging when the bathroom door is pushed open violently.
Anyway, I was rather pleased with the progress of my project to snatch my cute little flat mate from the woman, one of the hardest case for me to crack, which I named
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good morning, brother mine. How’s your day?” Oh, that fake smile, that
. But he did not mind. He did not mind at all. If Sherlock died, he might as well die with him. He could not live alone. Not when his love of his life died a painful death.
“No shit, Mycroft! You didn’t arrange that, did you? Don’t tell me that cabbie is one of your minions!”
”, an interesting contact name, Gregory.
Hey, Sherlock. Are you free now?
Sherlock stood aside, watching his boyfriend fighting. Ah, violent John was amazing as always. He enjoyed observing that unyielding look in John’s eyes and the twitch and tensing of his muscles when he was fighting.
His partners in the Navies had already found their companions. They had someone to share their ups and downs, and yet John, having met quite a number of pretty women, had still not yet found the love of his life.
Just help me. I’m out of depth...
Sherlock reached out to him, trying to find a part on his body that wasn't bleeding. Unable to do so, he stroked John fondly on his head, fingers seeping into the forest of hair, clogged with dirt and sweat. "John... it's okay, John. I'm here, Moriarty will let you out because now he has me to play with." Upon hearing this, John just shook his head vigorously. Tears welled up in his eye sockets, and because John was a brave man who didn't really cry, Sherlock was shocked to see that John was expressing his weakness. A look of pure sadness and hopelessness was written on his face, and he was still attempting to say something.
“Oh stop trying to argue with me, you know I’m always right. Why else would you think I would hate you or even leave you? You are perfect for me. Even though you are over-imaginative and stupid.”
John was red in the cheek. “Mycroft! Stop that rubbish! I hate you!”
They went out together, solving cases, and John had to admit life with Sherlock was exciting. He’d always loved dangers, and Sherlock always provided him with that.
John got seated next to me. I could feel his body warmth against me. The fresh scent of his hair gel flushed into my nose.
Mycroft twisted his mouth at the state the flat was in, with cigarette butts and drug needles lying everywhere. “I thought you quit the smoking.”
That’s it, John thought. He was going to slam the door and leave John.
Hey guys I created this group with John here so when I have a case, I can always notify John.
Sherlock walked to John’s side, and whispered in his ear, “You’d better be careful here. Me and my crew have a bit of a history with you Navies.” He slapped the prisoner hard on the face, and sneered.
Oooh, bet you wanna punch John after reading.
while doing
Sherlock?
Armed men burst into the chamber and killed the torturer. The intruders freed Moran and carried him into a waiting black limousine. James Moriarty was on the passenger seat, beside Moran.
“Get Sherlock away from the door. I’ll let you in.” John said, his voice croaked and unnatural, like he had been sobbing.
Mycroft seemed calm when I phoned him. Had he expected my call? I just hate the thought so much that he could really see through me. He knew my feelings and he knew what I’d be doing. It was annoying to have such a brother, but it was not always a bad thing.
Lestrade barked an unamused laugh after John’s finished. “You’re nuts, John. Idiotic. That’s silly. Go out and say sorry to poor Sherlock. Did you seriously believe in that non-sense?”
John went out, seeing Sherlock crying on the sofa, and he felt a searing pain in his chest. “Sher…Sherlock…”John said softly.
There’s a knock on the door. “My Sebby.” Moriarty smiled and opened the door. Moran was standing in the hallway.
I was a lonely man, thought John. All these years he sailed along the sea, seeing all the wonders and beauties of this world. And yet nothing,
Sherlock glanced down onto his hands, knuckles white from grasping the whip too hard. He looked at John, bloody and barely conscious. What has he done? Sherlock realized with horror.
The helplessness of not being able to help his friends. The guilt of surviving while none of his friends did. The despair of watching brave, good men perish under flames and gunshots. The loneliness of losing everyone and everything he once loved.
Sherlock was exhausted. Where’s John? Where’s him when he’s most needed? This total darkness, the loneliness, was more than Sherlock could possibly bear.
Greg did not even tried to hide his surprise as he ushered Holmes to sit. “I… eh… I think you are aware… that… my soulmate is you, and yours is mine as well. So… eh… I haven’t properly introduced myself. I’m Greg.” His face was blushed bright red.
I’ve found someone. She’s lovely. I love her, how she brightened up my day and accompany me when I was going through all the sleepless nights.
Wait,
“You rescued me.” I said, with a hint of anger.
Sherlock was actually very afraid, for he could only imagine what would life be like in the hands of the Napoleon of crime. Last time, in the incident of the Reichenbach’s fall, he at least had his brother’s support and a fail-safe plan. This time was totally different. He had nothing to rely on. He was really going to die.
You stood on the roof,
John was walking along the streets. Without a home, without some criminal to chase down, London felt hollow. Empty. Just like how John was feeling right now.
Lestrade just shook his head. “Look, if I come here five days later, on that “special end-of-the-world” day, will you feel better? If you really do something bad, I promise I will stop you. If you hurt Sherlock and he wants to go away, I promise I will make him stay. There won’t be anything that separates the two of you on that day, not on my watch. Satisfied?”
“Moriarty, Sherlock is suffering. He is tortured. I want to end his pain.” John stumbled the words out slowly, gingerly, like it was explosives in his mouth. “Please, let me make him go peacefully. Please.”
Greg did not notice. He carried on talking about his day with Mycroft. “You know what? Mikey is so rich his house is about twenty times bigger than ours!” “I can’t believe there’re actually still people at this age who keeps a pocket watch! Well, Mikey does!”
“Captain? Captain Holmes? Where’re we heading to?” His crew asked. His train of thoughts were abruptly interrupted.
The pirates seemed enraged and they tied John up instead. They dragged him by his collar, and John stumbled along the way.
Fluffy~
“John, John, I need you. I’m so alone. I’m so lost.” Sherlock said, hopelessly sank to the floor. “I know I am not the perfect boyfriend. I know I’m arrogant, selfish, greedy, and cold. I… I don’t deserve you… I blow up the microwave, I don’t buy milk, I play the violin late at night, I boast of myself, I annoy people all the time. I swear, I will change. Just… just come out. Please.” Sherlock felt something trickling down his cheek. He gasped and touch his face. It was tears. He was crying. Crying! He panicked. “I have loved you from the beginning, but sentiment is an unfamiliar subject to me. I hide my feelings, my loneliness behind that cold mask. I was shocked, really shocked when you told me you loved me. I’m just a freak who doesn’t deserve to be loved. You warmed me, John. You saved me. Please, John, I don’t know what to do right now. Save me one more time.”
My words were full of hatred, and Sherlock was so hurt. He looked as if someone had driven a dagger into his heart. He was in pain, and his features were all ugly twisted, and he whispered my name for a dozen times.
Sherlock? Please? We got information that tonight there will be a fourth!
And it said: Mycroft Holmes.
There were so many questions in my head that I just could not figure out, but I did not want to spoil this moment so I remained silent. I patted him on his back gently, and I pulled him even closer to my body. I enjoyed the feeling of him, his tiny little body, against me.
This flat mate of mine, however, is a weird guy. He’s got a body of a grown-up, and super high IQ, but a mind so childish. He often winds people up because of his arrogance and ignorant in social relationships and social skills.
I called his name.
“Yes.”
All hope was shattered. Only John remained. Why would Moriarty keep him alive? There was nothing John could do for Sherlock anymore. He was weak and useless.
John spat on Moriarty’s hand. Moriarty frowned a bit and laughed. “Oi, that’s a little puppy!” He cleaned his hand on John’s shirt. “Do it!”
John carefully listens to the music, pleasantly intoxicating in the melody. It is fast, passionate, burning; it is slow, gentle, caressing… It strikes John that it may be a love song, John thinks half-amusedly. Is Sherlock in love with someone?
He pulled Sherlock to a hug.
Lost in sadness and remorse, I lost my balance and fell to the ground.
Thank god. How can you ever work that out?
They solved a case. Lestrade thanked them with a bottle of champagne. It’s been three years since John last touched the sharp object in his nightstand.
“Who told you that non-sense?” John said angrily, before realizing those were the exact words he once told Sherlock.
What? Love? No! I was a high-functioning sociopath, I was not capable of human emotions! Of course I don’t love him. I just, sort of… It’s odd. I did not know how I felt about John. I had never felt something like this before. The feeling of being happy and comfortable at the thought of him.
What? What was going on? WHO was in love with WHOM? WHAT UPDATES? I was so confused that my mind was blank.
I felt my legs shaking, and tears that welled in my eyes. John, oh, John!
John wasn’t listening. He stared at Greg, whose face, like any young boys, was smooth and white. His hair, an angry brown, was messy and fierce. His eyes shone with a special charm. John could not take his eyes off him. Greg was a nice guy, and quite good-looking. And sometimes he thought, there was something more than friendship between them. But so innocent and young, what did he know?
John hated himself for not being able to fight back. He shivered at the thought of being held prisoners by the pirates. What kind of torture lay ahead of him?
Sherlock felt uneasy. Who was this? What was he or she implying?
“Don’t…don’t you think… you and I should be… soulmates?” John was almost crying. He could not accept the fact that Greg would be spending his lifetime with another person, that Greg’s soul had never belonged to him.
Still a short chapter. I'm not sure if I've got a thing with short paragraphs
Lestrade walked into John’s bedroom, with glass vases smashed on the floor and papers crumbled in frustration. Lestrade frowned.
Mycroft opened his mouth and shut it again. “So enlighten me, Doctor.”
Yes, I would describe Sherlock as my sail. He was the one who drove my life, and lit me up. If I was a watch, he would be the gear; If I was the Earth, he would be the axis. I never liked saying these mushy things, but, regretting how I never got the chance to thank my flat mate for bringing so much joy into my life, I would never see him again, I would never be able to tell him how much I cared about him and how much I valued him.
“On the count of three, fire the canons. One… Two… Three… FIRE!” Sherlock commanded with absolute leadership. The Naval Victress was weak and small, compared to his magnificent ship—the Jolly Mary.
Four.
What is it this time –SH
Gavin, please, how much dumber can you be. Just go arrest that idiot.
What secrets were my girlfriend hiding from me? I realized that she never really mentioned her past to me. I hadn’t know a thing about her before that night at the pub.
That night John knew what heart-broken meant. He had never been clearer about how he felt about Greg since that moment. But Greg was unreachable. Their paths would never cross.
“Yes, yes. I will. Yes sir.” A pause. “Oh, he is doing fine. Yeah, but he’s evidently in love with me.” Another pause. “Great, I’ll report the updates to you.”
That woman was called to Mycroft’s office to report John’s daily schedules. John was such a regular little man, never changing his habits. Monday, lunch at Macy’s. Tuesday, dinner at Jim’s. Wednesday, little break at the library. So predictable.
The captain looked insulted. “Look, I apologize for any misunderstanding between us. I come here with good will.” He pulled a key from his pocket and unlocked the gate. He stepped in and sat beside John.
“Because I lost the paper bag. I was too foolish to notice someone behind me.”
“Tell me about it. It will help.” Mycroft said calmly.
I was quite impressed with that woman. She had skills of a professional intelligence agent. I was very disappointed with myself that I had not been able to spot anything different in her before Mycroft told me her real identity.
Sherlock turned his head and refused to take it. Moriarty, murmuring a “What a shame”, asked his men to beat Sherlock until he yielded. While a really heavy blow in the stomach sent Sherlock crashing onto the floor and probably smashing his elbow, another kick in the chest produced a sickening sound of rib bones breaking, he did not even whimpered.
One day, both Greg and John’s parents decided to send them to the city, to work. Greg had been so excited. He resumed his enquiring after arriving at the city.
I knelt and I screamed but I didn't cry,
This guy, I love him so much. He is crazily lovely.
“He said he was worried, something about the curse. So he followed us.”
, leave you behind.” Moriarty kissed Moran softly on the cheek.
“You should know, it has been almost two years. Since your ‘suicide’.” He said with a shrug on the word. “The people you left behind, the life you abruptly left.”
That was, until he heard the term “soulmates”. And John was certain Greg and he were soulmates. They talked about everything, and they understood each other so well, that there was possibly no other explanation except that their souls were connected and that they were destined to spend their lives together.
Sweat on his forehead. Pained cries haunt his dreams. John screams as the bloody hands claw at his uniform, as the bullet hits his shoulder.
Why is this happening? John asks himself. The mere presence of Sherlock is enough to calm John, as he bathes in the familiar blissfulness of numbness. And happiness.
Sherlock opened his mouth, wanting to protest. But with a hammer hit on the back of his head, he passed out on the ground.
“Lestrade? Why would he be there?”
failure I am.”
“No you won’t! You won’t!” Sherlock chuckled.
All those years I dreamt of him by my side, I dreamt of living happily with him for the rest of my life, just the two of us against the world. And this sudden revelation didn’t seem true to me. Sherlock Holmes would never fall in love with anyone, let alone me.
John suddenly put his left index finger against my lips and stopped me. We looked into each other’s eyes for a second or two, and all of a sudden, John leaned toward me and kissed my lips.
But my nightmare began,
Moriarty tapped his fingers on the table. The beat echoed around the room. He was formulating a plan. A plan to
The unconscious John slumped onto the floor like a ball of cotton, and Sherlock immediately rushed towards him. Gingerly touching his numerous wounds, Sherlock held the weak man in his arms.
Ah, how he loves the pain.
“Since I was about twelve. Got more serious when I started taking drugs. But let’s not dwell into that right now. The real question is, when did I stop? And why? I have stopped that for two years, four months and five days. I have found something more worthy of my time and my attention. I have found something that makes me feel alive. That is, when I met someone at Barts, moved in with him, and lived a wonderful life from then on. He is the high in my life. He makes me feel alive. His every smile, every blink, takes my breath away. Life with him is fantastic, and never boring. I am no longer an outcast, nor a useless being, because I found my meaning beside him.
At the thought of John, Sherlock was torn back to the painful reality in front of him. He was in a box. A metal chest. He could feel the icy touch on his pale skin. He could not stretch his legs. He was in a, kind of, fetal kneeling position.
John shakes his head. “No you don’t.” No one understands him. What Sherlock sees is a cheerful lad, but nobody sees who John really is. Nobody knows how close to drowning John is. He is drowning in agony, suffocating in loneliness. “You may know a hell lot of biological knowledge about this. I don’t care if you point out the little malfunctions in my brain, whatever hormones I lack, whatever chemical failure I am.” John stands up. “But you never know how it
Please, you know I value your comments, please, please. I'm so lost in my thoughts
It’s not like he’s missing Sherlock. “There’s no way I’ll be missing that crazy man.” He said to himself. “Think about Greg. Think about Greg.” But all that came into his mind was the tall, slim figure, those curls, that coat that’s flapping.
Sherlock, petrified by John’s threat, reluctantly took the whip and walked towards John. His hands were shaking, and so were his legs. “John, I am so sorry.” Something wet rolled along his face and Sherlock realized by surprise that they were tears. Tears? He hadn’t cried once ever since he was five, after Victor Trevor died.
“You know, I will punch you if you don’t stop messing around.”
In fact, it was not a bad option either, knowing that he would never love me. He would leave me behind, broken, alone, so why should I live when the one I loved most hated me and would never come back to me? Life would not be happy, nor meaningful, if I had to part with John. What is the use of my life, if it was waking up every morning, staring into an empty flat, in an eerie silence, without the usual laughter and jokes from him? Why should I keep my heart beating, if it was so hollow and empty inside? What was the difference between me and a log of wood, if there wasn’t him around, warming me up, cheering me up? Life would simply lost its meaning.
Sherlock was getting worried. John had locked himself in his room for two days now, only coming out for a quick shower and a sandwich meal he made for himself. Sherlock had thought about things he had done wrong, when he had angered John. But he couldn’t think of any.
“Christ Sherlock. I’ve just woke up!”
Moriarty rolled his eyes, seeing that Sherlock was still thinking. And
I would never, ever allow my cute little doctor to get ugly.
“For God’s sake, Sherlock, striking a deal with a criminal mastermind is no child play. You can’t just go into Moriarty’s organization and ask for John’s return. You know that he will lock you up, and beat you, and kill you. This is a no-return journey! You’re going to hell, Sherlock! I can’t let you do that!” Mycroft stared at Sherlock, his cold hard eyes suddenly welled with tears.
69 days. And all of this would be taken away from him. All of the happy memories, the laughter, the smiles, would end so brutally.
After a while, he seemed to have solved the mystery.
In fact, Anthea added me in. She’s an excellent hacker, I can tell you.
“Listen… my love, it’s not your fault. It never is.” John began. He soon told Sherlock about everything. When he finished, Sherlock just stared, wide-eyed and not speaking. That look on his face was scary. For several minutes he didn’t move, not even a frown or a blink.
Lestrade, again, offered us a ride in the police cars, but Sherlock, as usual, ignored and called a cab. He was playing with my fingers during the ride, obviously deep in thoughts. Something or someone in the case was clearly troubling him.
People always say you don’t realize how important someone is to you until you lose them. Yes, I didn’t even know how much I value Sherlock in my heart. I don’t know, I just feel hollow without him beside me. I used to confide everything to him, and he would listen, even when I know these human emotions bored him. He was a good flat mate. He was a good friend.
Suddenly I felt someone tickling at my waist. I lost my balance and fell of the bed. I struggled to get up but accidentally tripped over Sherlock’s slippers and fell flat onto the floor. Sherlock roared with laughter, pointing at me. I must have looked hilarious.
For ten years or so, John doesn’t know there is any other way to achieve this happiness besides cutting himself. He knows it is unhealthy for him to cut himself, but for the high he gets afterwards, he continues.
“John.” Sherlock’s throat were dry. He had not had a single drop of water since he was held captive. “You’re here. I… m…miss you.”
Of which the bricks were soaked red,
Two weeks later he was discharged. Sitting on his bed in his old little flat, he remembered how good the pain from the shoulder wound felt. He remembered how the pain seemed to calm him down. He remembered how the pain took him away from reality and into a wonderland of blissful ignorance. He wondered if it would work again.
John could feel Sherlock’s breath on his face. “No… it’s only… it’s the sixty-ninth day. I thought, maybe you would… I don’t know… you wo…”
And John says yes.
Sherlock to help.
When, in your eyes, despair flickered.
Moriarty looked at the battered man, and pulled him to a tight embrace. “Sebastian, I will never,
Sherlock’s gaze sat upon John’s wrist. “The mark.”
“Impressive physique. However precious time cannot be wasted, Moriarty will start his next attacks soon. There is not a moment to lose. Well then, chop off his fingers one by one till he talks.” Sherlock Holmes said callously, and he left with his brother.
The pain.
an old friend. But the arrival of John, the sunshine he brought to me, chased the loneliness away.
Smiling? What kind of a man smiles under such tortures? He should have kept John. He should have killed John in front of Sherlock.
That look in John’s eyes was beyond the description of words. It was a mixture of love, hatred, longingness, sympathy, and unspoken sadness.

Sherlock is lying beside him, eyes open, and looking out the window. The night is peaceful, quiet, and calm. Time is frozen. The devils cannot reach John for now.
(Sherlock)
Mycroft sighed again. “Think of it this way, you will bring hurt to all the ones who love you and who care about you if you just die so… irresponsibly.”
(John)
“Once I’ve ensured that you are cooperative, I’ll send him away. Dump him in a waste bin or on the road, whatever.” Moriarty waved his hands, getting excited.
All of a sudden I remembered how cruel he had treated me, and I was filled with rage again. He did not care about me, he didn’t even remember me, how on earth would he love me? That was impossible. He said those words just to make me forgive him.
The two men talked for a while, neither acknowledging John’s presence, when they suddenly left for a walk. All the while John was not spoken to.
John turned his head towards me, annoyed, and said furiously, “Excuse me, but why are you staring at me all the time? Do I know you? Can you stop tha…” he stopped abruptly, and his jaw fell open. His gaze was piercing through my disguise, and I felt as if he was ripping open my heart.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock opened the door.
Moriarty rolled his eyes. “It… is sweet. Such a shame it’s ending so soon.” He turned to Sherlock and held his chin with his long fingers. “Sherlock, I will break you. Crush that little brain of yours. But no rush, we have all the time in the world. First I have to take care of my little Sebby, who is so thirsty for revenge.”
“No!” John shouted. “I’ll take it.”
I date John myself.
I’m sure John will help me
Very well, then, dinner first.
Now he knows, he knows, it’s love, that keeps him from falling apart.
“Look, I’m sorry for that. Let’s start all over again, okay?” John added.
“Ha!” He exclaimed, and gave my hand a quick kiss. “The game is on!”
in pain, and I really
“What are you going to do with him?”
“Professor.” He said, eyes on the floor. “You have summoned me.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and whipped John again. John let out a scream and slipped into unconsciousness.
“Your thoughts are wondering. Oh let me see, what are you thinking about, brother dear? Dilated pupils, reddening cheeks, oh give me your hand,” He pulled my arms towards him. “And, quickening pulse. You are missing John. You are feeling human emotions, aren’t you?
I clenched my fists, gulping my words down to my stomach. I could not tell him, how could I?
Sherlock flinched at the voice of Moriarty. "Don't you worry that I'm going to strangle you with my bare hands?" He referred to his unbound limbs.
“Oh, wow!” Moriarty clapped his hands in fake amazement. “There’s the little soldier boy!” He snapped his fingers and motioned for everyone to put their guns down.
(See the end of the chapter for
If I got time I'll write the remaining chapters.
Sherlock Holmes, oh, Sherlock Holmes, what had you done? Now you ruined everything!
John took the bag. Good. Sherlock smiled. “Good job, my doc…
Actually I could not help laughing at how ignorant John had been. He had been dating with an assassin for months already. Unless she hid really really well, one could not have missed the clues that she had a special background. Really, John? You really thought you were dating a innocent little girl? At that thought, I chuckled, but when I remembered that John would probably still be hating me to death for deceiving him for two years, my heart dropped.
I grabbed his coat which still smelt of him.
When you walked into hell and said
You didn't care what people might think.
And search his office. You should find the poison in the top left drawer.
“Ready the canons!” His fellow crewmen repeated.
Greg hastily shook the outstretched hand and stammered: “Do you… have… have a… soul mark, Mr. Holmes?”
The torture stopped suddenly, and Moran was already so weak that he was on the verge of fainting. A man came in and removed his blindfold. The sudden vision of colours confused Moran, and he blinked his eyes.
There’s a knock on his metal cage. “Sherlly my dear, cookoo, wake up! Puppy John is waiting to lick your face!” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Nineteen.
I DON’T NEED TO KNOW THE DETAILS!!!
I thought we'd be together forever,
I was terrified. Would he punch me? Had he overheard our conversation? Had he changed him mind?
John half expected Sherlock to say “You have succeeded, apparently”.
He, was alive.
I was dazzled. What was this special something I felt about John? “You love him, don’t you?” The voice of Mycroft continued to swirl inside my mind.
I sighed. Sherlock was sound asleep on his bed, and he looked so calm and peaceful. The look on his face was babyish and angelic, so different from his usual arrogant and cold face expressions. In these days he often looked upset, I’d never seen him like this. Whenever he got a case, he would be over the moon. But then, with the Moriarty case, I could see that it worried him a lot. He barely smiled, talked or do anything except thinking. Misery knitted his brows together, and unspoken sadness gloomed the house. At that time I did not know what he was planning, and I did not ask, but it pained me to see him down like this.
The bright, mid-day sun shone on the shiny tiles of the rooftop at St. Bart’s Hospital. At a distance, Sherlock could see the silhouette of a man, sitting at the edge.
The music is not familiar to John, but it is beautiful all the same.
He thought I was dead, and so soon he could get over me. Maybe he didn’t even mourn for me. I was swept away from his mind, and replaced by that woman. Once, I filled his life with excitement, and now I was nothing more to him but a puff of smoke.
They were running on the street, chasing down two men, probably under the criminal lord Sherlock was after. The men were carrying a paper bag containing some documents which were vital to the case. Their physique and fighting skills were certainly not bad, but with someone like John Watson as their opponent, they didn’t really stand a chance. John easily kicked one man in the shins and knocked the other into unconsciousness, and took the bag. Feeling proud, he waved the bag in the air, trying to impress Sherlock.
The memories of Greg came up again, disturbing that relaxing moment. Greg and Mycroft were getting closer than ever. Greg even said a happy announcement would be made soon. John drowned in self-pity when he suddenly wondered if Sherlock had a soul mark too.
Upon hearing those words, I was shocked. Yeah, well, I was
What power does Sherlock have on his mind and his body, that makes John crave for him so much? What power does Sherlock have, that makes John determined enough to stop self harming? What power does Sherlock have, that keeps John from falling apart?
to me for saving your life?”
It all started with a stupid curse.
The two was doing fine these few days, but still feeling guilty, John provided a lot more cuddles and kisses and touches and sweet words and so on, spoiling Sherlock with bliss whenever he could.
As John had lived with Sherlock for a month already, it became clear Sherlock was not what others thought. He wasn’t a bad man. And he certainly would not kill people. But he was really a mystery. He liked to wander in his own mind palace, shutting everyone, including John, out. John thought there was more under that mask, just that Sherlock wouldn’t let it show. John tried to get that mask off. He gave compliments, which was genuine of course, which made Sherlock smile. But every time he became ice-cold again. Like he did not have emotions.
IT IS
A familiar smell.
Can you pop out once without being all insulting and asshole-like
John broke out laughing. “Technically, Sherlock, we’re not married yet.”
That meant…
Moriarty laughed. "If you kill me, you'll never find your little puppy. He suffered injuries that requires immediate medical attention, or he'll die. And, you care far too much about him that you'll never run away, or fight, unless you know that your puppy dear is somewhere safe."
“You dare!” John’s eyes shot with hot white fury, and he produced a gun from his pocket. It was a tiny revolver, aimed straight at Moriarty’s forehand. Dozens of armed men raised their guns and pointed them at John. But John did not faze. He would not waste his only chance to save Sherlock.
Moran was furious. He would never yield to these evil monsters. He must protect his master.
“I know what you are thinking about, I know that frowning face,” She said quietly, on my bed, “Remember? No negative thoughts tonight, you promised! Now, come here, let’s… have some fun?”
John looked offended. “What? I am being serious! Sherlock can’t get hurt. I… I need to get Sherlock to… hate me. He must leave me, even if that means I can never see him again. He would probably hate me a lot, but I can’t afford to break his heart. He… can’t bear that sort of thing. This relationship between us, has to end before the
Always made you so sad.
Made his dreadful last fall.
. Before I become a monster.”
They stood in silent for a few seconds when a round of gunshots rang in John’s ears.
“So, you woke. I’ve been waiting here for a long long time.”
That scene, Lestrade thought to himself, was even scarier than the homicide case. He tried to ask Sherlock what happened, only to receive a heart-stopping deadly gaze which was desperate and confused. Hands trembling, Lestrade asked John to let him in.
is coming to save him.
“One more miracle, Sherlock, for me, don’t be dead. Would you do this just for me? Just stop it, stop this.” I almost cried. But in fact I didn’t. I didn’t want him to see my all sad and lonely, because I know, I know he would be unhappy down there if I was not happy. I forced a smile.
I’m not a psychopath. I’m a high functioning sociopath. DO YOUR RESEARCH –SH
But it would also be ridiculous to say that Sherlock has not helped him in many ways possible. John still cries, but now he has a shoulder to cry on; John still cuts, but now he has someone to make sure he bandages it properly afterwards; John still breaks down at night, but now he receives a single red rose on his nightstand every morning; the dreams still haunts him, but now violin music from the living room slowly calms him down.
than a friend. Someone to confide in, someone to comfort him, someone to support his exhausted mind.
That was so Sherlock, his usual naughtiness. How I missed him! I missed him messing around in the house, I missed his look when he blew something up, I missed his arrogant little smirk after he pranked me, I missed everything about him.
This is probably the shortest chapter existing in this world, but I just like how it ends here. I promise, next chapter will be longer. MORE EXCITING too XD
“Forget it. All your men would have been dead before they could see where the sniper was.” Sherlock put on his coat and was about to leave. “Quick, there’s not a moment to lose. Each second we idle is a torture to John. Move away, Mycroft.” He motioned to his brother, who was blocking the door.
Almost finished, don't worry. Their hardship will be over very soon. A few more chapters to the great finale: a happy ending, of course
“Alright, stop! Maybe, maybe I do. But he’ll never love me back. Why bother?”
Three months later, Greg had his eighteenth birthday. That day he complained of having wrist pain. At midnight, he got his mark.
“Oh my god, oh dear. Is it you? Is it you Sherlock? All… All these years where have you been? Oh, Sherlock! You have no idea how hard I’ve been searching for you. Oh no…” John was sobbing. He lifted his hand and stroked Sherlock’s cheek softly. “Sherl… I missed you so much.”
“It hurts!” I said, messaging my elbow, “Why are you doing this?”
The next day we went for a walk in the park, and dined out at a French restaurant just round the corner. It was one of those diners recommended to me by Sherlock, and I recalled the first time I ate there, with Sherlock. We even got mistaken as a couple by the shop-owner. It was quite late at night and we were out catching a criminal, running through the lanes and roads of London. We got hungry and decided to stop by and eat something first. It was quite a romantic dinner, as I remembered. There was a flickering candle between us, and we sat, facing each other.
But with his knitted brow,
(John)
Something in my conscious told me that lying to John was not the right thing to do. I was there when he visited my grave. The speech he gave, the things he said, it was a teensy bit touching. Well I didn’t know where those words touched because I did not have a heart, but still, I noticed that he was grieving. He was grieving because I was dead, at least in his thoughts.
Moriarty popped out. "Sorry to interrupt this blissful moment, but, he's unconscious, he cannot answer you." He said with a wicked smile. "However, seeing that you're so eager, I'll wake him up." He gestured his fellow men to pour a basket of icy cold water onto John's head. Slowly opening his eyes, pupils enlarged with fear, John regained consciousness. He caught sight of Sherlock and immediately straightened up. His eyes were wide open with terror, and he violently moved his arms, leaving the chains rattling. He was obviously attempting to say something, but the gag in his mouth prevented so.
I was very disappointed. What had she known that she had not told me? Who was she? Behind the sweet face, what kind of hideous liar hid? I thought with a shiver. Who had I been dating and kissing all these months?
John was beaten by the pirates and thrown into the small, dirty prison cell.
We ran along the London streets,
weak. So Mycroft stop idling with your stupid umbrella and GET US OUT.”
Okay, soon, soon they'll get out. And a happy ending I've promised!
I felt a little bit sorry for John that all this had been a lie. His “girlfriend” was never in love with him. Every bit of his life was planned, like the settings from a movie.
“Starving.”
“Well,” Sherlock decided, “Looks like our prisoner still thinks that he’s the commander here. Sailors, let’s teach him some manners, should we?” The fellow pirates cheered and chanted in unison.
She responded with a laugh. “Oh, nothing. Just messing around in your pool of shaving cream?”
John’s heart felt heavy. “But there must be something we can do, Mycroft! We cannot just stand here and do nothing! Sherlock is out there, and he is possibly dying. Promise me, Mycroft,” John took his arm firmly. “Fight with me. Find Moriarty. Save Sherlock.”
