He couldn't breathe, and flinched as the head hit the back of his throat and his gag reflex flared briefly before he managed to control himself; he brought one hand up to the wrinkled, drawn-up skin of Julien's balls, holding his breath as the boy whimpered and trembled underneath him. Saliva pooled uncomfortably in the back of his throat, so he swallowed.
"So, Inspector," Sherlock says brightly, placing a mug of black tea in front of him and settling on the settee beside John. Closer than normal, he notes with a few smug butterflies. "To what do we owe the pleasure?"
Sherlock snorted, but he said nothing. He seemed completely shocked by what had happened, almost entirely unresponsive. Lizzie looked genuinely concerned as she stared adoringly up at him, but John noticed she didn't look particularly surprised. He wondered how often Sherlock was badly wrong, and whether he always reacted like this.
John frowned. "But you let me look at
John flinches. In the cacophony as they show her out and begin to move St. Claire to an interrogation room, Sherlock touches him on the shoulder and gently shows him his wristwatch. "John," he rumbles amusedly. "Don't you have clinic duty?"
"John Watson, Lord Chamberlain's Men," the youth completed.
John chuckled. "I knew an apprentice hairdresser at university," he explained, but Sherlock wasn't really listening. "Apparently that's the first thing you learn when you're training. He was camp as a row of tents, of course, but a great bloke - he mentioned that head massage was great for getting laid, so I asked him to teach me. You think
the playwright if they would play together. "Oh, well," he said. "Perhaps next time. I'd love to watch the two of you rehearse, though, we could still meet up with the three of us."
"So now she owns the house," John finished, just to show he was on the same page. "We got into a bit of trouble over that, too. Last time Will ever took a commission. That's quite a big favour, though," he prompted, raising an eyebrow and receiving a raised eyebrow in return. "What did you do for her?"
He looked up at the Doctor's sharp cough and note of warning, automatically withdrawing his hand. The Timelord was watching him with a heavy frown over his eyes. "Keep away from the shadows," he said in the same terse voice so unlike the boyish roll he'd heard so much of previously.
He leant forwards for a chaste kiss, which the younger man's thin lips expanded into something a little more intimate, if not heated.
The detective smiled, suddenly bright and brilliant.
Ordinary circumstances would have seen him smirking at the bewildered look on Donovan's face. John always seemed to get annoyed at people's beliefs that Sherlock had no emotions or empathy, but Sherlock had worked rather hard to make them believe that in the first place; it wasn't his fault that John made his emotions a lot more obvious.
We stare at each other until the chef creates a diversion by setting the tower of onion-slices he's created on fire.
John steps back, bewildered at Sherlock's vehemence. "Did you… I don't know. There's got to be some reason. They can't just arrest anybody. Call him and ask him."
The ellipses are weighted, as though I should know exactly what's supposed to come after them. I assume she means
"I'm sure you did, my Lord. But – forgive me – it would have been rather easy to miss, if perhaps the box you said you kept it in had been shaken somehow and the letter had shifted so it wasn't on the top?"
The redhead chuckled unconcernedly as they made their way – Bill's arm still around John's shoulders – to the lunch line. "I'm sure she wasn't as offended as she made out. She still likes me."
someone, to want a conventional relationship, and it scared me that I'd accepted without even thinking that I wanted it with you." Staring out of the window, Sherlock snorted out a slightly derisive laugh. "I was completely smitten with you, John, I didn't think of anything else for days. In the end I didn't go because it unsettled me, and I didn't know how to slot the way I felt about you into the rest of my life. There were things I wanted to do, and I couldn't do them if I had you. And I thought it was so likely that you wouldn't go, because you looked so shocked when I left you. But… after that I sought out people I could talk to the way I wanted to talk to you."
"We were," Sherlock assured him. "We just got sidetracked on our way here."
Sherlock smiled wider, leaning towards her slightly. "Lucky me," he said, lowering his voice further. "What
"We don't," Ben interrupted, making a regretful face at John. "I asked him. He says he doesn't want Orsino and Olivia to see each other until the end, because the whole point of Viola being there is that Olivia has refused to let Orsino near her."
And with a last flap of his long-fingered hands, Sherlock stalked back to the settee and threw himself down on it. John stared at him bewilderedly until the detective nodded down at the script still clutched in his hand; reluctantly, John looked down at it and gave Ophelia's final speech.
. It ought not to surprise John that this Sherlock, who shuddered and made little moans at each stroke of John's fingers on his chest, was hot to the touch, pliable and so human that John couldn't help himself, pushing Sherlock's shirt higher until the younger man grew impatient and yanked it over his head.
John doesn't let the frown drop. "Okay, but Sherlock… most people don't move this fast. So it's not socially unusual or anything. You don't have to feel like you're expected to do this right now."
Emilia nodded so violently John worried she would hurt herself. "I din't want to go there but Lizzie said we 'ad to," she murmured. "She made me go real close to the door when that boy went in. She said I 'ad to hear what they was sayin', but I couldn't hear much, on'y the man sayin' it should be ready tomorrow an' it took long 'cause he wanted somethin' special."
Nothing like that ever happened between Jim and I. I felt sorry for him, and then we just sort of… but it was
it that Sophie hadn't crossed his mind at all from the moment he had seen Sherlock? He had been so caught up in his unprecedented appreciation of his very masculine form and his fragile, reluctantly-expressive face. He'd felt as though he
"Are you staring at me on purpose?" John had asked at one point.
And nobody ever inherits anyone else's possessions after they – did you even
"I wonder how long Sherlock will wait before he admits to himself that you're not coming," he said casually as John stood up to go to bed. "Will he sit there on the steps of the Museum, or will he just lean against something so that people don't notice he's been stood up?"
"That's not quite what I said," John protested, unable to stop the smile from spreading across his face, "but thanks, Will."
John picks up the manila file again, opening it and spreading its contents out across the table in front of them. "Right," he says matter-of-factly. "What do we know, then?"
Sherlock shrugged. It was only Chemistry and Plant Biology he would be missing, and he knew all the coursework anyway. This swimming pool incident sounded much more interesting. Sherlock looked at the picture: the boy was immaculately dressed in the formal uniform that Islington High did not insist on but provided for its representatives, not a hair out of place. He didn't look like the kind of boy that would keep his shoes somewhere apart from his clothes. He wanted to go and see, to go and have a look around the swimming pool and the changing room, and the sooner he could go the better. He couldn't afford to wait for the weekend, or the pool staff would have re-opened it and cleaned everything away. "Suit yourself," he said, pushing his chair away from the table. Julien's piercing green eyes followed him out of the room.
had caught him by just as much surprise as it had John. "Sherlock -" John began, feeling as though he ought to reassure his friend somehow, say
it when people assumed he knew what was going on. "Oh." Bill sniggered, and a memory of Sally's wild curls and bright eyes bouncing in his direction proved the final tap of the puzzle piece into place. "Oh! Right. Um… well, yeah, okay, I'll do it. I mean, all I'll do is photocopy my own notes, that's all she wants, isn't it?"
Molly insisted. John didn't move, still ignoring the youth in favour of staring in betrayed fury at his friend.
After, when they collapsed onto the duvet covered in a thin sheen of sweat and lube and come, Sherlock's body curled into Julien's before he had time to think about the move. He flinched when he realised what he had done and tried to cover the movement by rolling over him and snagging a tissue from the box beside the bed to clean himself off slightly.
John took Sherlock's hand and rested his own against the palm, beginning the first steps of the dance and the first lines of his song together, watching their respective fairies take partners and copy them in the dance. Sherlock danced with the same effortless grace as he did everything else, for all the world as if he had been performing the sequence for years. John found himself grinning, allowing the dance to speed up and become more cheerful, more of a celebration than he ever allowed himself with Tobias for fear of the other boy tripping. Sherlock laughed along with him, lifting the mood of the dance until they were spinning each other almost out of control, bumping bodily into Ben and his fairy partner and improvising a spin with all four of them, finishing with one of each of their hands on the younger actor's shoulders by the final line of the song.
Sherlock didn't think of John, because every time the other blond popped into his head his chest tightened until he couldn't breathe.
as immature as he was acting,
The train ride back to London is awful and awkward and quiet.
For the first eighteen months or so of our co-existence his things stood out in rather sharp contrast to mine; in amidst the reams of old case-notes and treatises to the identification of perfumes and shoe-makers from footprints was the occasional shelf of tidy medical journals, an unassuming photograph of five men in army slacks nestled between the skull and the messy pile of unopened mail.
The detective jerks upright with a gasp, grabbing at John's arm and squeezing until he begins to lose circulation. "What was that for?" he asks peevishly.
He whimpered at the realisation, his body relaxing, surrendering to John's command.
The detective gave him such a withering look John marvelled for a moment that his eyes didn't shrivel in their sockets. "We could have got
When he recovered enough to breathe again he slumped down the wall beside Sherlock, who had folded his legs out from underneath him to sit with his back against the wall, panting and delicately wiping the corners of his mouth. John snorted; it seemed so odd, seeing someone so composed handle something so helplessly undignified.
made more mistakes than you have. You'll be splendid, just like always - and don't forget he'll be comparing you to Tobias. You could say all of your lines backwards and you'd still look good."
You don't believe this nonsense, Professor, do you?"
John sighs again, but this time the emotion is acceptance. All right. Nothing and no-none's feelings will ever come between Sherlock and a case. Fine, good. He knew that already. "And what are you going to do about
Sherlock wrapped an arm around John's waist and tugged until their hips bumped together; John smiled up at him and wondered once again at how the two of them would look to the audience. Having the chance to show them a relationship between two men was an intoxicating thought: if he hadn't already wanted to strip Sherlock bare right there on the stage that idea would have brought him there. Society's perception of same-sex relationships made no sense to him, and he knew it made no sense to Will either. The two of them had had more than one late-night conversation - often naked with only bedsheets between them - about how the Greeks had seen relationships like theirs as superior even to those between men and women, and how surely society would come around again one day. Being able to kiss Sherlock, on stage, dressed as a man, was a huge step forwards, even if he was pretending to be a woman pretending to be a man.
Sherlock shrugged. "They're intimidated that I can guess their secrets. Teenagers always have something to hide."
He knows Sherlock means to his bedroom, or
John woke up grumpy.
There, my lord."
"So," he said briskly, handing Sherlock his mug and sliding into a chair beside him. "What particular spells were you having trouble with?"
Once the police had thrown him bodily from the building, Sherlock caught the bus back to Cuxton and slid inconspicuously into his seat beside Julien in the Human Biology classroom just as the bell for start of class went off.
The alien watched him for a moment. "There were four Judoon down there. They'll all be dead."
The half-Vulcan xenobiologist was generally disliked by the rest of the crew, and it wasn't difficult to understand why; Sherlock had a rather abrupt manner and didn't much care whom he upset in his command. There was a rumour going around that he had only been promoted to FO because he knew something about their supervising Admiral, in that way that he had of knowing your darkest secrets and 'accidentally' spilling them in front of your Commanding Officer.
"John." He busies himself with mugs and teabags as he realises Sherlock has followed him into the kitchen and is now leaning against the doorframe. "If you

, but I thought it just didn't leave as much of an impact on you as it did on me."
He stared at the hand on his thigh until John shifted it uncomfortably, at which point Sherlock reached out and removed it. "That's not helping," he said quietly, turning to look out the window so that John wouldn't see the tiny pink flush he could feel creeping up his neck. He could feel John looking at him from the other side of the taxi and see the amused little smile in his mind's eye.
"Yes, you did," Sherlock told him. "Come on, now, we've got to go." He looked over at Charlotte while he helped John to his feet. "Someone else will be in in about five minutes to continue the interview," he said, trying to smile at her. "It shouldn't be too much longer now. I'm sorry that we had to do this to you."
Sherlock dipped his head to lick and suck at the man's lips. "Joe," he whispered, rocking his hips forward again. Grieg grunted, shifting his own body to meet the thrusts. His fingers dug desperately into the fabric of the older man's shirt as he pulled them compulsively closer to each other, needing more friction, more contact, just
"Good," Jim replied, the attention that John had earned from him evaporating. "So," he said instead, clapping his hands together awkwardly. "You're Sherlock Holmes. Molly's told me all about you."
Sherlock did roll his eyes this time. "When you're ready, Doctor," he said idly. "They
Sherlock chuckled. "Of course, John," he replied with a quick press of his lips to John's once more. "I believe Angelo would be delighted to host us again."
John's hands tightened without warning and he yanked Sherlock down the bed, his entire body sliding across the covers until their groins met, hard and slightly painful, but Sherlock could feel John's erection hot and hard and throbbing in the cleft of his arse, and John circled his hips hard against him and groaned. He had lost his grip on the headboard when John pulled him flush against his cock, so he grabbed two handfuls of the pillow instead, letting out a shout. John set up a fast, relentless pace almost immediately, not
Well, bugger that. Today John cheerfully dons his most obnoxious fairisle jumper and bounces down the stairs two at a time, humming
Sherlock frowned. "Come with you where?"
"Sorry, Mrs Hudson," he shouted over the television. "I didn't mean to scare you – I was just wondering if you could turn that down!"
comfortable," he reassured him, and then he leaned that last bit forwards and kissed him.
him to do something about it? Could they do that without ruining the relationship that they would have to maintain for the rest of their five-year mission?
The cabbie coughed, a deep, dangerous, wet cough that made Sherlock shudder and jolted him sharply back into the moment. It had taken him so long and he'd had to be so certain of John before he could think about telling
He couldn't resist them, and from the way Sherlock smiled when he opened the packet, he guessed that the younger student knew it. "How did you know they were my favourite?"
"Barely," the man snorted. "She attended a weekly drawing class with a few other ladies. That was the only time she left the house without her husband, but he took her out fairly often. They would have dinner in town, or attend functions related to his work."
she'd called him, arranged a meeting beforehand? She had approached him and they had talked briefly, and then he had taken control, reasserted his dominance over her, perhaps to remind her that he was in control, and there had been the tiniest hint of a five o'clock shadow on John's jaw –
Sherlock fiddled with the biro. "Both," he said airily, turning to Gibbon before they got snapped at. "But I might pass on the French for now."
A surprised look met his eyes when he looked up. "Are you offering to make it?" his flatmate asked.
He's quite pushy, isn't he?"
The detective tipped his head to one side curiously. "Not as Raymond Slessinger," he said quietly, taking back the letter and tucking it swiftly back into his coat pocket. "But it can't be a coincidence. And if that man is who I think he is…" he shook his head shortly.
"When the night arrived, I broke in through the window that Mary and I had agreed - I thought nothing of it being open, there was nothing to suggest anything was amiss. In the sitting room I cut down the curtains and the bell-rope without even looking at the rest of the room, frayed the ends to look as though they had been torn. And then I crossed the room to find Mary and I saw…" he stopped to take a shuddering breath in, his dark eyes sliding closed. "I saw Lord Eustace," he finished, swallowing hard. "I'll never forget it - his eyes staring up at me."
Sherlock heard the faculty manager sigh. "All right. All right, I'm doing it. Just get Marchbanks and Professor Sainsbury out of there."
A moment passed while the Doctor continued to stare at him, his green eyes unbelievably sad. "All right," he said finally, tugging his hand out of Sherlock's. "Mr Holmes – can I call you Sherlock?"
John only laughed. "I couldn't help it," he confessed, leaning up again for a softer, sweeter kiss. "You looked so
are clearly a man of action, it wouldn't become you to play someone so frozen in cowardice and indecision." He frowned at another alleyway. "It suited Burbage to no end, though," he admitted. "Deplorable though his own character may be, the man is a passable actor."
"I thought something might be wrong when my Lady went to Sussex without me," the young woman admitted, sinking into a chair opposite Sherlock. John looked around for a third chair before settling himself standing behind Sherlock's, one hand on the high back of the chair to avoid touching the detective in ways that he might forget about and get carried away. "She never goes - never
"My condolences," Mycroft says finally.

he was uncomfortable talking about Molly with Sherlock, something that - unbelievably - the other man seemed not to have guessed yet?
He gave a hollow laugh. "I want to go home," he told him. "I'm tired and I want to go home. And I know you think a lot of yourself,
"Yes, it's me," the woman says, and her clear, Yorkshire lilt rings bells in John's mind for reasons he can't quite place. "You sound surprised. Has no-one whose life you ruined ever come back for revenge?"
"What will you do this afternoon?" John asked, mostly to change the subject.
Sherlock had started, asked John to repeat the question, and then replied nonchalantly, "I didn't realise I had been, I'm sorry." He'd tried to stop but it hadn't worked, and John had eventually given it up as simply being something interesting for Sherlock to look at while he thought.
There was a noise behind him, a rush of wind, a crackling of gravel. John whirled around, expecting to see Sherlock frowning at him, preparing to shout and rage at this invasion of privacy. Instead, John's jaw dropped.
Even after Jim was gone, Bill stared dreamily at the door. "Do

John watches as he scampers around the room, tossing desk drawers around and lifting paintings. Lestrade steps closer to him. "You all right?" he asks, awfully casual. John grins. "Sorry. You just look a bit... down."
The lovers made their customary clamour at the opposite stage door, and John slunk back from the stage and out his own door for the painting of their own eyelids. He had to admit that the young actors had always grasped the horror that he found in the mistaken love-spells, though he usually found their Demetrius portrayed it clearer than their Lysander: tonight, though, he heard the helpless cry of
As he started to leave Grieg's hand shot out and grabbed his wrist. "Please don't, Sherlock. Don't just go, I don't want this to…" Sherlock bit his lip and tried to look like he was trying not to cry; Grieg squeezed his hand. "Would you come here?" he asked softly.

Ben snorted as though amused at the picture, but glanced over at his mistress, now asleep draped all over an ageing man with a donkey's head, and sobered quickly. John smiled grimly.
The shadow, Sherlock noticed absently, was no longer even pretending to be an extension of Sherlock's own form, and was instead puddled at his feet, lapping up his ankles, tendrils of darkness running up the legs of his trousers and stark against the purple fabric of his shirt, centered around his heart. He clutched at his chest, gasping, staring at the Doctor and seeing on the square face with its impressive chin a similar expression of shock to the one he could feel on his own.
The doctor seemed to be fighting himself, as though there was something he wanted very much

once more, clutching handfuls of pillow so tightly he worried about ripping it. John's harsh exhales sped up incrementally, developing into tiny noises that were almost moans but not quite, and Sherlock had never been able to imagine John making noises during sex without them being hugely unrealistic but this
You see, Sherlock has had extensive self-training and eons of practise at not sleeping. John, not so much. So the still-dapper-and-enthusiastic consultant is pacing like a man possessed in the sitting room of 221B when he first notices it.
Sherlock frowned. "Is it supposed to make that noise when it lands? It sounds unhealthy."
They walked in this manner - Sherlock's arm draped casually over John's shoulders, a warm presence against the nape of his neck - back to the room's desk before the detective dropped the contact with a chuckle. "I quite like aspects of that play," he said playfully, perching himself on the edge of the desk. "That scene in particular. I like the power that Shakespeare gives Rosalind, and the way that she chooses to use it to woo Orlando and set the tone for their entire relationship."
For a moment they stared at each other, Sherlock's eyebrow raised in challenge, the Doctor frowning as though trying to decide whether he could trust Sherlock. Then there was an abrupt humming noise from somewhere above the console, and the lever that the Doctor had just nonchalantly flipped upwards slid

as his whole body surrendered to the inferno of white fire that consumed it.
"Maybe he just didn't want to give you detention on the first day," John suggested. "Besides, he likes you playing his word-games with him."
It felt strange, but he supposed it wasn't unpleasant. He'd heard that this kind of kissing was more about sentiment anyway, and since the two of them were skipping that portion of the program, he went right ahead and touched his tongue to the other boy's lips.
"My family is from Paris, originally, sir, but I have just moved from the Seychelles." He sat down as Gibbon's attention was transferred elsewhere, rolling his eyes.
Sherlock chuckled and waved an unconcerned hand. "I don't think you'd have any trouble with truthfulness," he said. "And a bit of practice with the physicality and the costume would take care of that problem."
Sherlock's face falls even further. "Okay. I understand, John."
John frowned. "I only stepped in at the end," he protested. "You were the one who tracked the man down."
He didn't know - and probably wouldn't have cared – that on the other side of London a boy called John Watson was thinking the exact same thing.
"Okay," the doctor said brightly, rolling out a few cricks in his neck. "Where are we going?"
"I'd give it up if I were you," John told the young man when he was jogging comfortably beside him. He couldn't help the ridiculous grin that was spreading over his face; he hadn't felt this alive with the thrill of a chase for

too many," he agrees. "But there won't be any more. I'm giving up." He smiles brightly to show Sherlock he doesn't mind. "I guess I'm stuck with you for the rest of my life."
Will slowly sat down on the stool someone had placed behind him, buried in his scripts. "That must have been it," he agreed. "Perhaps if the Duke greets him -
John frowned at him, still reeling over the fact that his computer program could distinguish the mud from Islington from that of Bloomsbury. "So what happened to him?" he asked.
"Yeah," he says finally, clearing his throat and letting a single tear slip out of his left eye. "Yes, it is." He shakes his head suddenly, letting out a bitter, helpless laugh. "God, and you're right," he continues, looking at the ceiling, his hand twisting under mine. "I have no right to call you an idiot, Sherlock, because I've been just as bad. I
And then it was over, far sooner than John wanted it to be, and Sherlock was drawing away from him, gasping for breath, wincing as John's hand caught in a tangle in his hair. The detective looked completely taken aback; clearly the explosion of relief and
"Your relationship with Shakespeare sounds immensely profitable for the both of you," Sherlock remarked, smirking. "He gets the security of a fine actor in his company, and you are offered lead roles in fantastic plays before anyone else."
" he cried instead as it took him, clutching the other man's waist with his legs and heaving ragged breaths into his lungs, feeling his heart beat wildly as though it were no longer a part of him.
He devotes his time instead to thinking, to devising plan after plan of how one might go about seducing a consulting detective until he hits upon one likely to work. John's style of thinking is different to Sherlock's; it's slow and ruminative, more sort of plodding and methodical, the tortoise rather than the hare. And while slow and steady doesn't always win this race, John always gets there in the end.
"How do you feel about the violin?"
Sherlock took a deep breath and adopted the persona he'd planned. "Yeah, I think so. I just… wanted company. If you're not too busy."
He'd been surprised to see the young Slytherin on his first day in Auror training. He hadn't known him very well at Hogwarts, but he had kept very carefully to himself. John had occasionally heard the teachers complaining about how someone so apparently unconcerned about class could get such good grades, and he'd automatically assumed that the boy would go into a more academic, solitary career. But because John was three years older than most of the rest of the yeargroup, and Sherlock didn't seem to have taken any of his school-friends into training with him, they had been pushed together fairly frequently when they needed partners for practical work. John had been surprised at how easy the dark-haired teen had been to talk to once he made the attempt, and in the six months they had been training together he'd come to rather like his dry, intelligent sense of humour and the idle observations he made about the people around him.

John's anger flares up again at the way the name sobers his flatmate back into this thoughtful state, and he tosses his arms up in the air. "What was with you, anyway?" he accuses. "You actually
Again, Sherlock smiled a tight, sad smile.
"Did you have any ideas about the case, then?" John asked, shaking the crumbs off his fingers and beaming at him. Sherlock delicately picked up the second piece of toast before John could eat it, despite the fact that it was smothered with ginger marmalade, which John didn't usually eat himself unless he was trying to convince Sherlock to eat with him.

Lestrade looks at John, his face resigned. "So did they kill him? Maybe he got cold feet, tried to pull out?"
"Hey," the man warned, though Sherlock could hear the smile in his voice. "I'll have you know that on some planets, the word
got a problem."
Then Sherlock spots the rifle range. "Oh, John, look!" he cries, suddenly sounding like an excited child. The doctor chuckles at the speed with which the detective has made the switch from condescending to carried away, but when he sees what it is that's got him so worked up his face falls.
friendly, not the scary normal-person thing you do when you're trying to manipulate people."
"Most likely, sir," Sherlock answered honestly. They hadn't taught him anything last year, so he was hesitant to believe that they could raise their game in the final year. "Titration, aqueous systems and organic chemistry this year, isn't it, sir?"
"I said I'm
When he'd first been surprised by the boy falling out of the window he had looked at him with a natural sort of superiority. Not because of his blatantly lower economic status, but because he had climbed through the window of a swimming-pool changing room to avoid being seen by the friend he had followed there for somewhat dubious reasons. And then John had not been embarrassed at being caught sneaking around, as Sherlock had expected, but had beamed and offered a hand to shake like he wanted to be Sherlock's friend.
The boy in the doorway cleared his throat, looking bored. Sherlock looked away abruptly. "Right," the detective said briskly, turning away and folding his arms into his coat in a practiced move. "Let's go. Moregate isn't that far from here."

Quite suddenly, the detective stood up, his chair scraping obnoxiously across the floor. John winced. "Thank you for your time, Miss Devine," Sherlock said abruptly, waving the letters at her with a brief and glaringly false smile. "These are incredibly helpful. I will ensure that someone keeps you informed with our progress in this investigation."

Sherlock looks from his brother to his flatmate to the door. "Fine," he sighs finally, trudging back to the settee and throwing his body down in a way that eloquently expresses how much he'd like
," he cried, grabbing Ben as he slipped through the stage door, releasing John and Sherlock in favour of kissing the boy's forehead reverently. "The three of you are a show on your own. Can I keep you?"
This took longer than I expected, but I discovered Green Wing, which I can't quite discover why I'm so enchanted by but which has made me cry with laughter and also just cry.
Sherlock blinked. "How do you know all of this?"
the detective said, apparently puzzled.
"Yeah," he says after a moment. "Yeah, that's what friends do. Tea, is it?"
"Don't worry," John told him, already reaching for the bottle of Sherlock's shampoo. "Once we've done your hair, we can let some of the water out and then we'll be able to move. It's not going anywhere, Sherlock, not with you sitting in front of it." Sherlock laughed and let it go, closing his eyes as John tipped shampoo onto his head.
John took an eager step towards his friend.
I had known he was serious about this woman.
in Julien that he simultaneously resented and did not want to lose.
Sherlock rolls over and digs in his bedside table; recovering, he holds out a little plastic bottle in his pale fingers. John blinks.
Sherlock replied.
Released from Sherlock's stare, John allowed himself to turn to where Ben was standing with the rest of his entourage, arms folded, looking sulky. Sherlock's fairies, too, had retreated to the other side of the stage as though fearful of the argument between their king and queen. Titania's monologue about the boy that was the centre of their argument served as a tiny reprieve from the fury of their argument, which John took advantage of, stepping back a little to watch Sherlock's gestures and listen to the rolling cadence of his voice. Infuriatingly, the detective was actually directing his speech at Ben rather than John, moving from pinning him with the entire focus of his attention to pretending he didn't exist in the space of a few lines. Helpless anger bubbled in John's stomach, paired with a distant sort of admiration that he could feel like this when he knew everything was just pretend.
The butler rearranged the jewellery box with a frustrated mutter of
This time he took the head into his mouth, surrounding him in a hot, wet cocoon; Sherlock gasped, his hands shooting behind him to hold his weight as his hips jerked. Julien's hands settled on his hip-bones, pressing gently to hold him back as he slid his mouth further down his cock. Sherlock closed his eyes to focus on the sensation; it was almost
Curiosity got the better of him and he ran his fingers through the somewhat disgusting mess on his chest and tentatively touched it to his lips. It still tasted like John. His eyes drifted down to his erection. He couldn't help but wonder what they would taste like
He led the detective on stage backwards, both their hands clasped together: to his surprise, Sherlock leaned forwards and pressed their lips briefly together before they reached centre stage.
He brought his head up to see Sherlock's face, worried that he'd ruined it for him, that he'd be embarrassed or disappointed, but the pure-blood's elegant face curved into a smug smile. "That's... more than fine. Next time."
The detective waved a dismissive hand. "Not the whole case, John, of course not," he said irritably. "But anyone with any influence could find out that most of the Constabulary call me when confronted with a difficult case. Maybe that's why Lady Carfax posed as Lady Brackenstall after her disappearance. To try and gauge how intelligent I am, maybe how far I'd go for the case. Hopefully our insistence that we didn't have to tell Lestrade if she was trying to protect someone helped in that regard. And now Crocker, though I doubt that's his real name. I almost think I've seen him somewhere before, but there was no point in coming here except to introduce himself to me and me to him, maybe to let me know that he's a player in whatever game this is."
They had turned into a corridor that was entirely empty and ventured through a door conspicuously marked
Julien raised his hands in surrender. "As you wish." He reached for the decanter of Cognac on the edge of his desk, tilting it towards Doctor Watson and receiving a predicted taut shake of the head before pouring himself two fingers and swirling them around the crystal tumbler. "What is, then, your business with me,
. But the last thing he wants is to force one
"I'm fine. It's not anything to do with the play," he said, allowing John to tip his head forwards to fix the wig at the nape of his neck.
"Okay then," John replied, stepping back and sharing a slightly apprehensive look with the Captain. T'Penya stepped forward and placed her fingers on Sherlock's melding points, closing her eyes in concentration.
After a while I realised that this was probably my last chance to do something just the two of us, so I sprang from the sofa feigning cheerfulness and pulled down a stack of books that were half his and half mine from on top of a nearby lamp-table.
missing, Mister Holmes," he said urgently. "And she didn't go willingly. I needed to make sure you were looking for her, to make sure you were treating it as a kidnapping and not assuming she'd run off with a lover."

that he'd been thinking recently that he wouldn't mind at all if he did get called to serve with the military after becoming a doctor. Sherlock made an expression as though he didn't particularly care, but John noticed that he continued to watch his face intently for signs of approval. Signs, of course, which John was more than happy to give. "That's
" he denied. "
The detective casts a glance back at him. "Vauxhall arches. We need help."
They settled into an easy rhythm; once John was able to explain the reasoning behind the Incolumus Charm on his own Sherlock started testing his knowledge of names and dates and the theory behind the other areas of defensive magic in the exam. The Slytherin colour-coded his notes with a few taps of his long wand and created strings of ticker-tape-like timelines of dates and charms until John's head was spinning but he could answer every question that Sherlock fired at him, sometimes literally, flicking luminescent dates out of the end of his wand or laughing as smoky incantations dissipated in John's face. Eventually the boy sat back in his chair and bit into another Chocolate Cauldron. "Good," he said through a mouthful of mint and chocolate. "Take a break. We'll come back to it later and see how much of it actually went into your long-term memory."
John's eyes had followed his body when they'd moved around and something Julien had said had drifted back to him:
"So," Julien began idly when the biology teacher had dismissed them and they had returned to his room, placing his chin flirtatiously on his hand like a high-end prostitute and looking up at Sherlock. "Tell me about your outing."
John looked down at it. "Is this
It would take him a moment to come down, regulate his breathing until the immediate danger of passing out had lessened, and then he would blink and look around and most likely jump wildly in response to seeing John –
illegal, you didn't even – you weren't
before it was tampered down into polite curiosity. "Are you… I mean… have you done this before? You seem a bit… nervous?"
The computer in front of Sherlock began to beep triumphantly; instantly, the detective was distracted from the thoughtful stare he'd been giving John and instead turned to examine the machine's findings.
Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Not John Watson, are you?" He looked up in surprise. "I think Miss Bailey has a bit of a crush on you," she explained. "She mentioned your name the other day like you were the science department's darling."
"The killer was a woman," Lestrade explained, flicking the file in his hand open and looking at the papers inside it. "We interviewed his neighbours when we first got here and they said they were quite loud, and they could definitely hear a woman's voice. They also gave us the name of the bar he usually goes to, Sally's there now talking to the bartender."
, you definitely wouldn't be the one I'd call, awake or not. Look, there's been another murder. Sally thinks it's the same killer as the one we had at the beginning of the week, but they're a bit different. Thought you'd like to come and have a look."
He chuckled. "I wasn't
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
before coming up with that timeframe gave him away, though. It felt as though he had known the lanky actor for far longer.
Bill's lips were curled back into an exaggerated snarl, but John could see that beyond the expression he looked vaguely amused. "
Jim coughed delicately. "So you two both take Statistics with McAuliffe, then?" he asked.
John hummed agreement, hoisting himself onto the desk beside Sherlock. "My favourite part of that scene is probably the fact that Celia is on-stage for the entire conversation between Orlando and Ganymede and doesn't have a single line," he commented. "I remember thinking it was a mistake the first time I read over the script submission, but Will assured me it was intentional."
John gaped at him. Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Oh, come on, it's not a difficult chain of reasoning. Otherwise it'd be entirely out of line to follow a
By the time we leave the restaurant, my head is buzzing in a vaguely less-than-pleasant manner and I have the distinct feeling that John's gripping my arm not out of a display of the affection that his friends now expect us to show, but purely for physical support so he doesn't fall over.
The lanky alien stared at him. "Pardon?"
"Look at Jim," Bill noticed suddenly. "The
John snorted. "At first I thought he was trying to come out to me, you know. By the time I realised he had no idea it was already hilarious and I wanted to follow it through. Plus, the food was pretty good. It's not like I have anything
John laughed, his hand resuming its stroking motions through the curls at the top of Sherlock's head, before growing thoughtful. "Would you let me wash your hair one day? Give you a scalp massage while shampooing and rinsing your hair?"

personal relationships and yet here he was, kissing a stranger he'd met barely half an hour ago and somehow it wasn't an empty kiss but something heavy with meaning, even if John wasn't sure what that meaning was.
John raised an eyebrow as though he didn't understand the question.
"Isn't that what friends do?" He gives the bow a flick and fiddles out the first bar of Puccini's
William Shakespeare is not just a playwright, he's an
John tried to gasp in surprise, obviously having forgotten that this was coming, but Sherlock tightened his fingers incrementally and he stopped. He wasn't holding John's neck tightly enough to actually cut off his air supply, but it was enough that it couldn't be comfortable, and John struggled instinctively, shifting his weight onto his legs in order to lift his hands to clutch at Sherlock's fingers.
"How on God's earth did you end up there?" John asked him once the scene was over and Sherlock had followed him offstage.
"He was in the paper the other day, didn't you see?" John mused. "I didn't read the article, I just saw his face. Some math scholarship or something. Not surprising, remember how clever he was?"
John blinks. "Are you
"Well,
he paused for a moment, frozen with one hand lifted, then dropped it with a sigh and a shake of his head.
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow. "Who did?" he asked.
He stood up, but John grabbed his sleeve and tugged him back down. Apparently unused to being manhandled like this, Sherlock Holmes sat back down abruptly, looking at John with wide, surprised eyes. John's mouth began drying out again in a most disturbing manner. "Wait," he said belatedly. "I'm interested now. Do you do this often? Find crimes in the paper that don't quite match up and then… investigate them? Talk to the police?"
"So," the older man says lightly. "What's he done this time?"
His friend looked awkward. "Yes," he said. Angelo ducked his head into the alcove and placed a candle in a red-stained glass lantern on the table between them, gave Sherlock the thumbs up, and left again. Sherlock cleared his throat. "Thank you, Angelo," he muttered through clenched teeth.
"Julien de Richelieu."
Julien made a choked noise, his mouth opening desperately under Sherlock's warning hand. "I – Sherlock –
"Unhand me," Peters insisted, quite suddenly going from limp to fluid under John's hands. He redoubled his efforts, bringing a knee into the small of the other man's back; Peters was deceptively strong, his thin arms struggling in John's grip. It suddenly became less of a mystery why the Queen had hired this man to get rid of her problems. John took a step back and used his weight to his advantage, trapping him against the wall and pulling his arm until it hurt.
"I don't have that long," Sherlock finished for him. "They're evacuating the building. We should be able to get a few people - Marchbanks, the secretary, seemed intelligent - to check everything over if we get rid of the swarm in the forest, before they reopen the building. And if we can't get rid of them, they won't reopen the building, and then it doesn't matter
The lights, too, were weak, but they held without flickering. The Doctor waved his screwdriver around the room as though it could detect the Vashta Nerada, then stepped into the room, apparently satisfied. Sherlock followed, aware of Marchbanks and Hannah stepping in after him. Hannah coughed lightly as the Doctor swept a sleeve over the desk of controls in front of the window, stirring dust into the air.
Another
, is the practice of having the same actor play more than one part. It's not certain whether Shakespeare ever did this, but it is speculated that Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania were intended to be doubled. Many modern companies do this to exaggerate the gender war that can be seen in the forest.
"Starting to," the playwright said happily. "I think it's going to be a big hit, romantically.
The detective snorts out a long, loud breath and flops back onto the pillows. "Okay," he says finally. "But I want to see you, John. If I'm naked the very least you can do is adopt the same state."
"Exactly."
"Nice to meet you," Sherlock answered instead of providing his own name. John smiled thinly. "So, um… what do you do? Other than drink on weeknights, that is."
"How do you mean? Didn't we already agree that it was this... Holy Peters person?"
Grey eyes turn on him, Sherlock's caterpillar eyebrows contracted above them. "It's not fair," he says softly. "It should be you. Your footprint trail is far more impressive than mine."
. She had spoken to this Jim about Sherlock and promised to introduce them at some point. The young man had probably followed her into the lab knowing exactly who was in there and hoping for just this to happen.
Sherlock stares at him. "But I… I want…"

John copied the expression as Shakespeare's smile became smugly mysterious. "Yesterday, I went to the Admiral's Men's performance of

a career."
"And I take it being beaten up and forced to exercise for two weeks hasn't squashed your ridiculous desire to join the Army?" he said.
Sherlock almost grins. "I am trying. But they've just arrested a completely innocent man who shouldn't have even been a
Either way, it kept the detective quiet for the next few streets. John grew bored with the silence rather quickly, instead starting to whistle the song of sexual prosperity from
"She's conscious," John concluded. "Just sedated. She'll need to be observed by a physician for a few days, we don't know how long they kept her under for. But her pulse is consistent, she'll wake properly when the opium wears off."
"Then you get called to Afghanistan," Sherlock continues, his voice softening, losing its excited quality as he looks up at John again. "There's sacrifice, and pain. You see things, lose things, that you never wanted to. There are horrible things." The line this time goes right through the footprints, and John understands: this is another chapter of life. This is where he grew up, finally. "But you're a doctor. You're strong, and brave, and selfless. People die, but some people don't because you save them. John, you've done such amazing things. How many people out there are alive because
"I can assure you with all confidence that that isn't the conclusion I'll reach," Sherlock deflects.
They walked in silence for a moment while John contemplated the dead end that line of conversation had led him into. The detective snorted. "There's a whole lot more
She smiled at him. "Right. I'll see you around, John."
Sherlock frowned. "It tells us part of the why," he agreed, "but it doesn't exactly narrow down the
Mrs St. Claire blinks at him. "Yes, I rang them the night he didn't come home. After I'd rung the company and the hotel he was staying at."
Quietly – if he made too much noise the now-irate policeman out front would hear him and sprint back to find him and probably arrest him. Not that they'd be able to charge him, but the school would get Mycroft involved if he had to be collected from Scotland Yard again – he fished the bent nail-file he'd been using as a lock-pick for almost a year out of his jacket pocket and started on the lock.
By eight o'clock the next morning, John finds himself on the outskirts of London, in a café, trying not to look enormously possessive as a buxom young woman throws herself on his flatmate.
Sherlock froze. John also seemed to realise all of a sudden what he had said and flushed scarlet. "It will be fine, thank you, John," he replied quietly. This time there wasn't even a ridiculously flimsy excuse for John to stay and 'give him a hand', and he just knew he wasn't ready to have the conversation that would lead to that situation
The friction of his head against damp pants quickly turned from pleasurable to painful and Sherlock whimpered, trying to edge away from the touch. John smiled softly and shifted his hand down further, kneading and massaging Sherlock's balls, sending throbs of pleasure up the length of his cock. "Too much?" he murmured, looking up sympathetically.
"No, Sherlock, stop with your existential crap." Sherlock shuts up pretty quickly. "We're going for a walk. Because it's nice, and we're young, and we're
The policeman looked irritated. "I don't know where they are," he said briskly. "They weren't at the scene."
experienced the level of commanding sensuality that Sherlock was pouring into the kiss, like he needed to drink John in through every pore in his body to survive. Sherlock's tongue flicked at his lips, so he parted them; immediately, Sherlock's strong fingers were cupping his jaw as his tongue swept through John's mouth like there was something hidden in it that he desperately needed to find.
John sighed as he came out of the kitchen, crouching beside Sherlock until his knees cracked. Sherlock looked around and smiled at him, taking the cup of tea when it was offered to him. "Are those new witness statements?" the doctor asked, sitting back on his heels and taking an innocent sip of his tea. Sherlock grinned at him.
Molly nodded. "Go," he insisted, wrapping both arms around the little girl.
The jeweller looked relieved. "There was another piece in the package that will interest you," he admitted, reaching below the counter once more. "I would have reported it as soon as I recognised it, but I wasn't sure who to report it to."
smelled nice, Sherlock remembered; John had offered it to him, but Sherlock had forgotten about it. He preferred baths to showers if he had the choice, but normally washing was a thing that happened between one event and the other and there wasn't
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
, John, and there's nothing I can do with the information that we have. I don't understand what this person thinks they're doing! It's no use to them sitting under their pillow!"
Sherlock looks up at him sharply, a frown slapping itself onto his angular face. He tries not to look angry, or jealous, or disappointed, or any of the things he feels. "Well, I… I didn't know what to do to make her stop, so I told her I was already in a relationship with you."
The two women led them out of the library and down what felt like a million flights of stairs into a crowded hallway. Sherlock recognised it instantly as a university; young people with exaggerated spectacles and faintly ugly cardigans were hurrying through the halls in different directions, clutching multiple electronic tablets and the odd old-fashioned laptop and chatting furiously to each other. Sherlock smirked as he heard snatches of essays and deadlines and assessments that hadn't been studied for.
The detective drew in a slow breath and left the reluctant pause so long John would have worried that any other actor had forgotten the line.
"An outside eye," Sherlock interrupted. "A second opinion is very useful to me."
Sherlock raised a cool eyebrow.
Sherlock swallows, carefully not looking at him. "John, I… I just don't want… I
"I'm fine," I reply shortly. For a moment he looks like he's about to say something, but then he bites his tongue and keeps silent.
"You have to understand why you're here," Lestrade said lowly. "You've had sexual encounters with all three of these men, and from what you've just said alone at least one of them treated you badly. You have to admit you had the motive to kill all three of them."
Sherlock smiled at him, tucking his hands into his coat pockets contentedly. "Well, that was easier than I expected," he admitted wryly. The other man just quirked a smile back.
And yet, Sherlock defined an unhealthily large portion of Julien's life. He had never found anyone quite like Sherlock, no matter how far he had looked; he had given up now, after the resounding proof that the Englishman did not return the sentiment, settled for manipulating look-alikes like Leslie into his house and his bed. At secondary school and university he had become essential somehow; it had felt nice to know that Sherlock would come to him to report the ups and downs of his sexual escapades, to know that even as the tally in his worn lab-book – itself a gift from Julien – approached 150, there was only one whom Sherlock had taken into his confidence, treated as a friend as well as a convenient lover.
When they pull up outside number 10, Downing Street, John can't help but stand protectively closer to Sherlock than usual, reassuring him with his presence. The detective reaches down and squeezes his hand.
Sherlock snorted once more, and John hurriedly looked around at his audience and spotted a pair of crossed stage swords behind the bar; he gave the barman a meaningful look until the man took one down and handed it to him.
In a flash, Sherlock was out of the bed, the antique Samurai sword from the display stand beside the bed in his hand and pointed unwaveringly at the young man with the radio alarm clock at the end of the bed. "Get out, Mycroft."
John nodded. "Good," he said shortly. "So what's our plan once we find Peters? Even Constables can't just barge in and search someone's house."
thinking about it and that
For a moment he just looks at me. Then he laughs. "What would you do without me?" he asks, reaching into his pocket and producing my phone.
They moved into the only available space in the kitchen to dance, John crowding into Sherlock's personal space, gyrating his hips in time to the too-fast beat. Sherlock didn't dance like this. He froze for the barest of moments before adapting something in between mimicking John's movements and those that he had seen other people make at clubs in the past, his back to the doctor's front.
It seemed to last forever, until John was sure he would pass out, but soon enough he had collapsed, panting desperately into Sherlock's shoulder, feeling the taller boy's slim chest rub against him as they breathed together. After a moment, he coughed and awkwardly climbed off Sherlock's lap and spread himself over the bench beside him.
"Thank you. If you could leave a point of contact with us, we'll be in touch at some point tomorrow." John waits for the showing off, the string of deductions, but Mrs St. Claire does not request them, and so Sherlock, with a slight grudging air, does not deliver. John pretends not to be even a little bit disappointed.
being trapped against the bar by John. "It's a deal," he said. "I'd probably introduce myself about now," he added as they pushed away from the kitchen counter.
It hadn't occurred to him until now that Sherlock would still be dressed as Cesario at this point, would still for all intents and purposes look like a man.
"Perhaps, but that is not what I meant," Julien said, his voice still sparkling with barely-contained mirth. Sherlock blinked.
The jeweller didn't look as surprised as John would have expected; he nodded with a slight bow in their direction. "Of course, sir," he said in a soft voice. "If you could describe the particular pieces you are referring to?"
a different killer's handiwork. "What do you think, John?" he asked, looking back at the doctor. He had plenty of ideas himself, of course, but it was always helpful to get John's opinion first, and he was slightly hopeful for a repeat of the last time he had asked it, when John had completely surprised all of them with his analysis.
There were the fingernails on the dip of his back again, and he hadn't expected that to feel nice, but it did; and suddenly Julien's mouth was open and his tongue was inside it and this couldn't be hygienic, it really
Finally, I snatch up my phone and reply to John's text.
The two of them were still on the bed, still tangled up in each other's naked forms, skin now slicked with the particular sheen of cooling sweat. John watched as they kissed languidly, hands roaming with reverential fondness.
Sherlock was on his back on the four-poster, stark naked, pale skin flushed green. And kneeling over him, just as naked, hands roving hungrily over the bare skin in front of him, was John himself.
She giggled. "No – they wouldn't understand that you're too sweet to look at them in their underwear," she remarked, her hand trailing down his arm. John squeezed it when it linked with his, trapping her fingers between his own. "I can just imagine the Cuxton lot screaming."
I want to find every person who's ever pulled your happiness out from underneath you and hex them into a pulp."
Sherlock's hand clenched into a fist suddenly around John's hair, pulling until John was forced to lift his head and shape it into a grin. The detective huffed out a breath that might have been a laugh. "We're not done yet," he growled.
The newcomer, however, looked delighted. "Do you? Wonderful! Good to know people still remember the classics. Childhood hero?"
"And you arrested her?" Sherlock prompted.
John redoubles his effort on the placid smile. "Don't let the door hit you on the way out," he advises cheerfully. "Lovely to see you, as always."
He whimpered, his knees trembling warningly. "Bed," he insisted once they broke apart for air. "I need you
John doesn't move. "Yeah," he says quietly. "It's like that."
Sherlock hummed absently. "He's right, they'll have more luck than we would. They must have some particular way of contacting him to assign work."
had that delightful little half-smile on his face that said he knew the reasoning behind this one. "If the killer had tied him up and killed him, why bother untying him? And the victim's wrists show no signs of having been bound – no ligature marks or depilation."
to save this, whatever it is, before it's too late. He's calmed down now, at least. He probably needs sleep and I'm tired too, even though I ended up sleeping last night, but I won't be able to calm down until I know he's not leaving forever. "No, I should... I'll be fine. Thank you, Mrs Hudson," I tell her, leaning in to press a kiss to her cheek.
"God, please tell me your keys are accessible," John groaned against his lips.

he dismissed.
John laughed. "She has a point," he replied. "One of us saw into the other's mind. There was no way that
Sherlock grinned. "But not nice enough to swallow."
he chastised, gesturing furiously towards John.
"Yes," John insisted, though he joined in the tiny chuckle. "I know Sherlock doesn't come across as particularly personable a lot of the time, but that's no reason to wind him up like that."
Sherlock Holmes."
John heaved an inward sigh as Tobias took three stuttering runs at his final line and shied away from John's touch as they danced together, tripping over the hem of his train as they did so. This afternoon's performance had been their most dismal yet. John had been distracted by Tobias' distraction, the boy clearly wishing he could be anywhere but on a stage with John.
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow. "You think so?"
Sherlock dismissed the rolled-up navy-blue briefs with a wrinkle of his nose –
, you're clever."
Sherlock has spent so much of his life being called 'freak' and 'weirdo' because of the things people see him do that are a little out of the ordinary, and so the obsession of his and John's fans surprise him: particularly the sheer number of traits and strange habits that they attribute to him without prompt. It's strange to think that these people assume he is even

"Would you like some?"
"He's dead," the detective says quietly.
The Doctor reached out for her arm. "I'm sorry," he told her. Sherlock couldn't bring himself to be too upset for the blond – she hadn't struck him as the most pleasant of people – but he did feel sorry for Hannah, who had obviously worked in fairly close proximity to her for quite some time, not to mention the abrupt and frankly terrifying manner of her death.

"Sherlock -" he gasped, and was answered by his own name in kind, the detective's head dropping into the crook of John's shoulder, his open mouth wet against his collarbone as they fell together, shuddering and clutching at each other as warmth bloomed between them.
Sherlock stared as though he didn't believe him. "
He launches himself off the bed, chuckling to himself at Sherlock's undignified little squeak as the mattress bounces. "Don't touch it, though, John," the detective instructs idly. "It'll burn your skin."
Sherlock didn't roll his eyes. "I'm still here," he said quietly. "You said you'd encountered the Vashta Nerada before. How did you get rid of them then?"
, no less – it didn't really matter how ridiculous he looked. Sherlock had only ever seen one woman come in real life, and he wouldn't be caught mimicking
someone with a deep, lazy baritone rumble of a voice groaned through the floorboards. "
They smiled fondly at each other for a moment, John's heart still learning how to slow down after the morning's panic and subsequent intense relief. Then Sherlock glanced hesitantly back at the corner of the wall that hid them from the stage. "I really ought to go back," he said, his fingers tightening on John's arm as though he could think of nothing less appealing. "Would you like to join us? I thought after a little more thought of this scene we would try something else, perhaps something with room for a third player."
He was rewarded with a small, reluctant smile.
. I'll give you this forest to survive as long as
Sherlock snorted.
Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:

in the hazy moments before they fall asleep.
"I'm sorry," he said quickly, still not looking up. "Just forget it, please. I can… I'll stop, I promise."
A hand clutches clumsily at his cock through his pants, scrambling for purchase; John winces at the feeling of fingernails through the cotton and reaches down to grasp the hand and draw it away. Sherlock sits up, struggling onto his elbows with John's hand now flat on his lower belly, frowning down at him.
John was in the kitchen when Sherlock emerged from his bedroom, studiously cubing a chicken breast. He smiled at Sherlock when he leant past him to fill a glass from the tap. Sherlock saw his eyes flicker subtly from his face – the flush of orgasm most likely still fading from his cheeks – to his trousers, a noticeably different cut to the ones he had been wearing mere minutes ago when John had left him. A tiny smile made itself evident on his face, but he didn't comment; most likely because his own face was similarly flushed and his jeans bore evidence of being hastily rebuttoned. Sherlock's shame at his loss of control was mollified slightly, seeing the reflection of it in his flatmate.

Sherlock smiled seductively, reaching for his mug of tea and letting his fingers play suggestively with the handle before picking it up. "The witness was on the other side of the bar," he replied, keeping up the act. He wanted to know
you were intelligent," the detective said with obvious relish. John chuckled.
This time a thin, smoky trail of something trickled out of the end of his wand and hovered between the two trainees as though uncertain of what to do. Sherlock watched it forlornly for a moment before reaching out to it. At the touch of his hand it evaporated.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, but John could see his chest rising and falling more rapidly as though he was struggling to stay calm.
Some little BAMF part of John puts its foot down and screams

"What in God's name was that?" John asked him once the heavy wooden door had swung closed behind him.
Sherlock feel the same? Well, he certainly doesn't feel the opposite, and that's good enough for now. "I don't know," he admits.
John snorted. "It won't work," he predicted. "Sherlock doesn't get distracted."
Like this, it only takes me five minutes before I've dissected everything it's possible to gain from Hutchinson's notes, and my eyelids feel heavy, my stomach full and content, so I sigh and slide down the headboard until I'm lying down beside John. He fell asleep facing me, and I can feel the tiny breeze of his toothpaste-scented breath stirring against my pores. I wonder if John would let me think beside him while he sleeps more often.
You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?"

He let it continue for a moment, wondering whether he should reciprocate but so caught up in the
Ben took one hesitant step towards Sherlock as though to comfort him, and without thinking, John shot an arm out to hold him back, yanking the young actor possessively back to his side. The tiniest of surprised noises escaped his mouth, drawing attention to them, so John clamped his other hand on the boy's shoulder, holding him in place, aware that every ounce of his body language was now challenging Sherlock and running with it. His own excitement amplified his heartbeat in his ears.
"Brilliant," Molly proclaimed. John grinned. "From the top, then, Sherlock?"
John blinked. "I suppose not," he said, sounding surprised. "I was imagining her to be like you." He glanced from Sherlock's face to his erection and back again. "I'd still start here. If I had someone tied up I'd want to make them
that he was performing in currently, and John elaborated on what the detective couldn't figure out for himself about his rivalry with Richard Burbage - for the rest of the laborious journey to Westminster.
John replied, confused,
John wasn't sure that the thin servant had the authority to do that, and judging by Sherlock's tiny smile, the detective wasn't either. Lestrade, though, set a little heavier into his defensive stance, as though to bodily prevent Sherlock from looking at anything confidential. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, but moved straight on to rattling the top drawer of the desk without further comment.
Angelo's deep laugh rang through the inn once more. "That, Sherlock certainly can," he chuckled. "I don't know how, but he can."
"Scary shop?" John repeated gently.
Sherlock lifted the dropper and held it, poised over a Petrie dish filled with his latest experiment. Molly Hooper, the pathologist from the mortuary downstairs, had just sent him a text confirming his theories on his latest case; the man had been beaten
Doctor Watson shrugged. "I don't know why he wants it," he said. "I only know that he wants it, and that I want to give it to him."
John grins again. "Wherever you like."
," he said bitterly.
John looked at Lestrade. "I'll…" he made a helpless gesture in Sherlock's direction.
Now I'm starting to feel stupid, the way he's staring at me in thorough confusion. "Sherlock, pink isn't…" Then his face clears and we realise at the same time. This is one of those things again, isn't it? Like the solar system, completely irrelevant data that ordinary people can't block out. "Oh, of course. They probably covered the rainbow in the same lesson as the solar system. Pink isn't in the rainbow, and there's an order – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet."
Carefully, he shut the door behind him and flinched as Grieg switched on the lights to reveal a quaint sitting-room, the sofa to which Grieg flopped onto and gestured Sherlock towards the matching armchair. He said nothing.
"You don't think he was her lover, do you," John ventured once they were back on the road. "Her eyes when she talked to you, she was practically

Lestrade rang early the next morning, startling Sherlock out of sleep. "Sherlock Holmes," he answered it, unable to keep the tiny hint of bleariness out of his voice as he tried to blink himself awake.
thing that made you happy that hasn't ended so badly it ruined the memory?"
Sherlock had tried to insist that John take responsibility of the fireplace once upon a time, assuming that with his army experience the task would be simple for him. The smoke alarms were still going off hours later and Sherlock had taken over from then on. Now he simply shot the doctor a wry smile as he leapt up the stairs, stripping off his jacket before the damp bled through to his shirt.
"It's too dangerous," John insisted immediately. "Whatever's in there, it's already killed one person. If you go into Sherlock's mind you'll be a target."
John shared a look with the constable as he rushed out the door and the two of them hurried to flank Sherlock and peer over his shoulder. He had crouched in front of the pond and was examining the ground before it. It was quickly obvious what he was looking at; someone had walked all around the pond, leaving clear, heeled bootprints in the damp earth. Sherlock stood, smiling triumphantly.
reporter named Kitty Riley even printed what I said to Alice St. Claire a few days ago.
"Shh," John says softly, bending to run his lips over Sherlock's cheekbone. "Just relax. I've got you, Sherlock, it's okay, just relax and let go."
he began, smirking at his own wit.
The memory that he had when they first bumped and dragged him into the temporary medical shelter floated back into his head. The child having some kind of seizure in the swimming pool, the grey-green eyes in an angular face framed by dark curls watching him, silently pleading him not to leave.

. John smiles.
"I've been a sailor for many years, Master Holmes," he began, twisting his cap between his knees. "I was on the voyage that took Mary - Lady Brackenstall, though her name was Fraser back then - to London to be married. We didn't mean it to happen. I think she was afraid of marrying someone she'd never met, and so far away from her own home, and she turned to me for comfort. It was a long voyage to fall in love over."
John watched as Peters' satisfied smile grew, abandoning the pretence of contrition. He could feel his own pulse through every inch of his body, feel his muscles tensing and relaxing with the need to
Sherlock smiled, a hint of smugness creeping into the expression. John tried not to roll his eyes. "A member of Her Majesty's Government approached us this morning. The woman's name is Lady Frances Carfax, and she's been missing for a sevennight."
The butler coughed delicately, evidently embarrassed by the subject. "I do not believe that he visited her at all," he said quietly. "Their marriage was one of convenience, not passion. I am sure that she was grateful for it - Lord Brackenstall was not a gentle man."
Sherlock nodded, processing the information. It felt a little like a gift that he had to turn over in his fingers a little before he could dismiss it. John noticed the expression and laughed. "One day, Sherlock, you'll know everything about me. And I'll know everything about you. One day, there won't be any part of either of us left unexplored."
"I know," his friend dismissed. "I know the army was something you needed to do that was nothing to do with me, and Anne wasn't anything to do with you. When I think about us back then - it was great, but I don't know where either of us would be now if we'd stayed together. I'm just happy that you've found someone now that you look at the way you used to look at me, who looks at you the way I used to."

There's a pause, and then she sighs heavily. "Tell me what happened, Sherlock," she suggests, sitting down beside me again and holding out the phone for me to read.
Sherlock stretches indolently over the back of the sofa. "Not yet. I'm sure something will turn up."

Sophia looked as though she would hit him for a moment, and then relaxed slowly. "I think I can respect that," she said quietly. "I know you, John. They must have been really special for this to happen." Sherlock's face, flushed with nerves and arousal, swam in front of John's eyes and he smiled at it and nodded. "If you decide that you're
- of days spent re-running the same two short scenes in different manners of relating to the other man. He had a flash of understanding about Will's concerns: John was happy when he was with Sherlock, but he had no real idea what the other side of that could look like. What if the playwright was right, and his new friend grew bored with him and left? Surely John, plain and military John, couldn't keep him entertained forever. "I think that's the best way to do it," he said reasonably. "Maybe find two or three different ways that we like and show them to Will, see what he thinks. And what works with what Molly thinks, perhaps."
he wasn't sure it was at all advisable.
John wondered with a tiny smile what Sherlock would do if he did see fit to interrupt; he was certain the detective didn't expect him to. He shifted his bottom more comfortably against the desk and watched the man instead. He looked to be in the middle of his thirties, dark hair mussed by the removal of the cap, lips red from the nervous biting he was still doing as he bent to sit in the chair with the slightest wince as though from aching muscles.
"John," the detective interrupted, and his voice was urgent. He turned his curly head to look at him, his grey-green eyes wild, mouth still open in surprise. "John, I believe I've made a horrible miscalculation."
The speaker crackled and the Doctor cut out, overlaid with an announcer's
"All right," he conceded, sliding two long, thin fingers innocently under John's waistband. "Perhaps both our mouths will have to find other things to do."
out there."
. John chuckles to himself.
Mycroft stared him down. "That is not your concern," he maintained. Sherlock let out a great groan of impatience and wheeled away from him.
Sherlock whirled back to him, bending his torso as though showing off how much taller he was than John.
"Sherlock and I had a bit of a... well... things sort of went a bit pear-shaped," John confesses. "I think we're okay now. It's not really something I'd like to talk about here, you know?"
Sherlock finished, gesturing to each item of clothing as it was mentioned and then standing back with arms folded.
be more help," he said scathingly, turning to the rhinoceros. "What do you want?" he asked.
to come in my pants this time," John whispered, leaning in so that the cabbie wouldn't overhear them. "I want you naked. I want your skin on my skin, your cock on my cock."
John blinked.
Jim nodded, rubbing his hands together awkwardly. "Hey," he replied, and then promptly proceeded to knock a dish from the table and allow it to clatter noisily to the floor. "Oh! Sorry," he said, with the air of the habitually clumsy. John narrowed his eyes; he had remembered Jim as possessing an enviable sort of natural grace. When Jim replaced the dish on the bench, John thought he caught a glimpse of a business-card-shaped piece of paper. His dislike of this new, pathetic Jim increased tenfold: was Jim trying to

John jumped a mile in the air and bumped his hip on the photocopier; Sally's voice was suddenly right behind him, low and sultry. He turned around, panicking slightly. "Sally, what are you doing? You're very close."

chosen this. His hands were everywhere, pawing at John's chest impatiently despite the fact that John's hands were hooked back into his coat pulling him closer. John felt as though he could never be close enough, never be pressed tightly enough against the other man, never kiss him deeply enough. He wanted to drown in Sherlock, in the fruity smell of his lush hair and the taste of their meal and their conversation on his lips.
Carl Powers' clothes were indeed still in the cubbyhole where he had doubtless left them; Sherlock smirked at the ineptitude of the police. Why were they monitoring the building if they weren't going to mount
Whatever rambling excuse his brain was making up without him, it gave up when Sherlock stopped abruptly, yanking on John's coat again, throwing his arms up wildly and yelling loud enough to wake the dead, let alone the sleeping criminal whose attention they are trying so hard to avoid. "
with this skill?"
Sherlock tried again. "I… I didn't mean those things I said to you. I was just… I didn't know what to do, I was scared, I thought you'd… well, it's what always happens in situations like this, isn't it, the student gets their heart broken? And I'd just had all that stuff with Julien and I… I just didn't want to get hurt."
Once he had caught his breath, John stood up and looked around.
"Thank you." They sit down again, clustered around the glass coffee table. "So. How much do you know about your husband's dilemma?"
dare try and bully me! One shout, and I'll have the police over here,
Sherlock recovered, his voice ringing, irate.
"Tonight," Sherlock answered before John had even finished speaking. His impossible eyes were glowing as they scanned John's face carefully, but there was something hesitant behind them, as though he was afraid John would laugh. "This. Us. Just doing something with a friend and being content." John could feel his heartbeat pushing at the walls of his throat; he tried to swallow, but he couldn't. Sherlock was frowning, and his eyes were darting from John's eyes to his lips and back again, and as he took a hesitant, loaded step forward John couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't
The next morning, he purposefully leaves his clothes downstairs.
"Do you… are you allowed into town in the weekends at Cuxton?" John ventured timidly after a few minutes of listening to the gradual slowing of their breaths and his own frantic heartbeat.
He blinked. "Really? I never got the impression that she liked me. What were you talking about that she brought me up?"
he beseeched, stepping closer and forcing the detective to sidestep him.
he said finally.
The assembled players looked at each other. "We thought you were getting him," John spoke for them, feeling his stomach drop unpleasantly.
The boy looked up at him and sighed, dropping his hands from his hair. John automatically took up the wig-fastening duties. "Are you all right?" he asked, leaving one hand on his co-star's shoulder as some kind of support. Tobias leaned into it, his eyes sliding closed.
Not sleeping was a problem that Sherlock had fairly often, though, and so John did not comment when he woke up and found Sherlock still pacing the dormitory in his pyjamas and blue silk dressing-gown but merely patted him on the back in a conciliatory manner on his way to the bathroom. By the time he emerged in his Quidditch reds, their other dormmates having left for breakfast, Sherlock had climbed back into bed and pulled the hangings shut around him.
"Sorry," John apologised, grinning. "I won't ask for an explanation again. I was just surprised. It's magic, you know."
Lestrade left an odd little pause before the word
"John," Sherlock drawls eventually. "You're staring."
John stared at him, still unnervingly close, trying to work out how someone could have no sisters and yet not know whether their sister was dead. Sherlock's smile widened for the briefest of moments before vanishing. John wondered how the detective would react if he kissed him again. What was his next line?
"Or he could have wanted to show his mental domination of her rather than his physical domination," John interjected, looking up from the wastepaper bin. Sherlock blinked at him, aware that the other police officers in the room were staring at him too. The doctor coughed slightly awkwardly. "He could have ordered her to keep her hands there rather than just tied them there - rely on her mental submission to him rather than forcing her down. Has the same end effect, but gives the dominant partner a lot more control."
Lestrade frowned, looking slightly bewildered. "Jagged or torn," he answered promptly. "Distinctive enough for the innkeep to mention specifically, at any rate."
Sherlock didn't have an adequate response to that. It was completely true, and he knew it. "You could have had this case solved

of John's body better than the Keeper knew it himself. There was a tiny thought in the back of his head that one day he might get to touch it as himself, without the use of magic, and he wanted to know exactly where and how to touch to get the best reaction.
," the policeman replied, still sounding amusedly surprised. "John routinely complains about you being up at all hours of the morning. I just assumed you didn't sleep."
The detective raised an eyebrow impudently, like he was about to question what authority John had to boss him about, but then he grinned and did as he said, lifting his own shirt off his shoulders as he did so.
I frown, standing up to greet them. "Did I say

Sherlock stopped dead and blinked at him. "I did," he answered, as though he didn't fully understand the question.
Sherlock's eyebrows shot up of their own accord. "Time travel," he repeated incredulously. The Doctor looked seriously back at him. "Right," he accepted. "So you know everything in history that's going to happen and has happened and is happening. Somehow you know who I am and you're trying to figure out whereabouts in my personal timeline I am right now?"
To those of you who have been following me since Infamia and are wondering what happened to the Lord Chamberlain's Men AU I was planning back then, I'm still doing that. Still pretty much in exactly the same place I was last time, although I'm now tossing up between Twelfth Night and Cymbeline, which is my favourite Shakespeare ever but is later than I'd planned historically. Anyway now that this is finished I'll get right onto that.
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow; Eliza was Tom's partner, and while Sherlock had heard a lot about her during the last case that had brought him to the Ball and Chain he'd never actually met her. He'd gathered from what Tom had said that when they incorporated elements of BDSM into their relationship she usually took the submissive role. Could she have concealed the message from Tom for her own reasons?
"Is that what?"
"No," John presses. "Before that. About the eating and sleeping. If it was really bothering you that much, you should have said something."
By the time Lestrade called again late the next morning Sherlock was thoroughly frustrated with the whole affair. He had not even been able to think about alternate ways to find their killer because John had been
of how they might have interacted that night."
John's second-in-command cleared her throat from behind. "Lestrade's hailing us," she told him, nerves making her stutter slightly. "What's going on? Sherlock was on that landing party, wasn't he?"
John shook his head. "If I'm going out, I might as well go all the way into London – my aunt lives near Covent Garden and she always says I should visit more."
Amy smiled bitterly. "At first I just wanted her to see that it had to be possible for people to dominate her without being

Will shook off the two actors hesitantly holding onto his arms and stamped his foot dramatically. He lifted a finger with great showmanship to point it accusingly at Molly. "
"Mr Holmes," she reiterates. "I have already told you there is nothing more I can tell you."
"Back at the house," Billy said.
He realised he should warn the other boy, give him a chance to back off even though he was sure Julien wouldn't. This was all about the experiment, after all. "I'm…
The pool was so crowded that John, Jim and Bill had to squeeze themselves onto the end of a bench packed to bursting with the other people from Islington High who had elected to come along. Jim was indeed sitting half on John's lap and looking distinctly disgruntled about it; John wasn't terribly stoked either. The Irish kid's sit-bones were digging into his thigh. Bill sent them an amused look before shrugging slightly closer to them to stop his bottom from sliding off the bench.
Sherlock rocked his hips against John's, once, feeling the hot swell of the doctor's erection against his balls, a coy smile firmly in place on his lips. "I'd like that," he replied, bending his head to lick and nuzzle the warm hollow underneath John's ear. "I think we'd better go now," he added. "The barman's giving us nasty looks."

Sherlock chuckled wildly and shoved a hand over John's mouth, whispering a
," he sighed, trying to remove the pressure of the moment
Alone, John staggered back to the bench and sat down again. His own clothing was still awry; he tugged it self-consciously back into order, suddenly feeling slightly sick. Sherlock had taken with him the content thrum of John's orgasm, and now all that was left was the icky feeling of sweat and shock that he –
He wanted to cover himself in the sensation of John's skin the way one might luxuriously spread themselves over a sheepskin rug or silk sheets, but he had a feeling John might object to being spread out and rubbed up against like an over-friendly cat. He smiled into their kiss in utter contentment.
"Sorry, John. Can I have a go?"
Sherlock flapped a hand dismissively. "I can't help but notice things. I don't intend to offend people."
The sallow-faced man opened his mouth in protest, but Lestrade held up a placating hand. "He's with me," he said, sounding thoroughly resigned to the fact. "This is Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, and his friend John Watson."
John sits down beside the detective on the settee and tries tucking his legs up under him in an imitation of Sherlock's 'thinking pose'. It's not particularly comfortable, so he desists and instead resigns himself to the sort of sub-standard thinking that apparently comes from sitting in any other position. This, he reasons to himself, is why he'll never be Sherlock.
Loving John had snuck up on Sherlock quite suddenly. The Sorting Hat's decision to place him in Gryffindor five years ago had been as much a surprise to him as it had to everyone else; the Holmeses were an ancient pureblood line, tied in closely with the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, and though there had been a few 'aberrations' – his mother's words – in the family the grand majority of them had been in Slytherin. Mycroft had been placed there without a second thought, and while Sherlock had worried every now and again about the role of many Slytherins in the famed Battle of Hogwarts, he had come out of it perfectly intact. Sherlock had always assumed that he would follow the same path, and he'd never imagined anything else.
The Doctor coughed. "We were in a library. They hatched from the pages of the books in the library. I told them to look me up in their books before they made me any angrier than they already had, and they retreated."
He breathes deeply, then leans forward on tip-toe until he can see the blush rise on Sherlock's cheek, see the rapid fluttering of the pulse-point on his neck galloping in time with John's own.
His new friend set aside the crusty end of his roll and leaned forward on his elbows nonchalantly. "I am offering to take you back up to your room and – how is it said here? –
It's in this mindset that he takes the tray of eggs on toast and the mug of English Breakfast in hand and kicks open the door to the consulting detective's bedroom. His lack of experience relating to this area of the house leads him to knock over a trivet with the swing of the door and spill something viscous and smoking all over the carpet.
. "And you? I didn't know you well at Hogwarts, but I was surprised to see you at the beginning of the year."
. I didn't stay up all night to see some – oh, Holy God – is it really you?"
That smile lingers in John's mind as Sherlock dashes off to change out of the blue plumber's overalls he'd been wearing. It's quite possibly the most beautiful thing he's ever seen, that tiny sparkle of something genuine. He just managed to surprise the detective, and he knows that he would do almost anything to get a reaction like that again. Sherlock reacts to puzzles, to surprises. He likes the unknown. So John's going to give it to him.
Sherlock chuckled. "It was," he agreed, reaching down to take John's hand where it lay between them. "It will get uncomfortable in a minute, though." He ran a hand through their semen on his belly to illustrate, but John grabbed his fingers and sucked them into his mouth, licking the sticky fluid away from them.
" I ask the waitress. She nods quickly and bustles away.
"I'm certain," John said, flipping his hand to catch Sherlock's fingers in his palm.
Eyes narrowed at the two of us, Lord Trelawney-Hope leaves the room and comes back a moment later with the box, pulling a key on a gold chain out from under his shirt.
Will had used to showcase their skill for the script he had just been given, though: Orsino and Viola barely acknowledged each other the entire time. "And I really hope he is."
he suggested, seeming to realise the double meaning of his words as soon as they left his mouth and slumping in regret for bringing up the topic again. Will let out a bark of laughter from the front of the stage.

"This is ridiculous," he muttered after a moment. "You're far too short to play the man of the two of us in any kind of dance."
With that, the detective grabs his coat and rushes out the door. "You won't," John says uselessly to the dead space he leaves behind, suddenly feeling the gaping emptiness of the flat. "That's the idea."

Sherlock shook his head slowly. "I don't think either of them had the strength to kill Lord Brackenstall with a blow to the head. It wouldn't surprise me if she was in on the plot, but there was a man here as well. A fairly imposing one - at least six foot three."

Sherlock gives him one of those rare, indulgent smiles, the ones he's never seen him give anyone else. They walk on in silence until they reach the ridge over which the crime-scene can still be seen; John stares down at it, watching Hutchinson direct people around wearing white body-suits and looking like sperm in some kind of television advert.

feel awful about what had happened. John shared a downcast glance with him; as much as he didn't want to upset Will, especially not now, it wasn't going to be easy putting all of this out of his mind to pretend to be Duke of an island whose only worry was being in love with someone who didn't love him back.
Shortly after midnight he was knocking on Joseph Grieg's door.
study partner."
The broad-shouldered man sobered with a tight smile. "Of course. Constable - if you would all like a seat…" he gestured to the chairs around the desks that formed a circle, with a space in the centre where a model might stand. He let Lestrade sit in the closest one, but when Sally Donovan went to sit beside him, the blond cut in front of her to pull it out for her as though she were a well-born lady. "Miss Donovan," he said politely.
"Um. I wondered if you'd come look at a crime scene in Hampstead."
Impulsively, he dropped to one knee in front of the detective-turned-fairy queen and stroked the backs of his fingers down one smooth cheek. Sherlock stiffened, clearly not expecting the move, and then covered the move with a sleepy sort of stirring motion. John drew a deep breath and picked up the violet flowers from the stump, making crushing motions with one of them.
They must have set some sort of on-foot record for getting across inner London; as soon as the shabby once-black overhead of the undertaker's came into view Sherlock stopped them abruptly, holding one hand out to halt Billy in his tracks. "Billy," he said, bending slightly to look him in the eyes. "Where did you tell Lizzie to meet you once she'd tailed Peters?"
"Of course," the sallow man agreed. "I hope you have more luck with his other clients."
Charlotte's face as Lestrade took her away was a mess with angry tears, confusion, indignation, and just a tiny hint of smugness. Sherlock frowned.
Bill slapped the lid on his ham sandwich and stuffed an alarming amount of it into his mouth. "I'm Bill," he managed around the protrusions of sprouts and grated carrot. Jim grimaced. John laughed.
He'd be lying on his bed late at night – there were times when he couldn't wait, of course there were, after a case in which John had been particularly helpful or military, but mostly through biting his lip and pulling his coat tighter around himself he could avoid rousing John's suspicions as to what he was doing when he raced home and locked himself in the bathroom – feeling his heartbeat echo in his belly, picking up and tripping over memories of John emerging from the shower to hand him a cup of tea, of John leaning over his shoulder and humming in the morning. And once he allowed himself, just the memory of that fond face and scratchy voice would have him half-hard in moments.
Then Emilia sniffled a little and wriggled a little closer to him, and Molly looked down at her with a tiny smile creeping across his face. "I'll stay here and look after Emilia," he offered quietly. "You can't drag her all the way back down to the undertaker's. She can stay here until we're set to start tonight, and you two will be back by then, won't you?"

Mr Grieg. Just this once, we never have to do it again."
me," Sherlock retorted, all the snap leaving his voice on the gust of a giggle as John turned his fingers into claws and lightly scraped the stubs of his fingernails over the spot he'd been tickling, making Sherlock's hips jerk forwards against his own. The fingernails moved over the swell of his hip and down, to rake red lines into the looser flesh of his buttock. Sherlock's hips jerked involuntarily again, accompanied by a breathy laugh.
Sherlock snorted in an attempt at derision. "I wasn't thinking of going," he lied smoothly. "Can you imagine me as someone's
John gaped at him for a moment. "Um, both, actually," he admitted finally. "Ireland for a year, then home for a bit, and then we were camped in Brest after 1590." Holmes nodded briskly, as though this was what he had expected. "Sorry, how did you know that?"
"Probably, given your father's status. Your name's written on your books, though."
The detective smiled sheepishly. "I was so afraid you wouldn't want me to," he admitted shyly. "I didn't want you to leave."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow; the maid flushed as though reconsidering the sense of her statement. John hadn't thought of it as a silly thing to say - a young widow was expected to fend for herself, but depending on how young she was when she had been married, often had not developed an understanding of how to do so. Lady Carfax had struck him as a composed and capable woman, but how long had it taken her to learn to project that image? "I'll just fetch you the letters, sir," she said uncomfortably, pushing herself back from the table and leaving the room.
" he responded harshly, bending his torso towards John for a moment before withdrawing, as though they were both ignorant of how close to each other they had become. "
was the door left open?
The rest of the crew, when assigned to a landing party led by Sherlock Holmes, let out a special kind of collective groan that made John smile.
Mycroft smiled thinly. "
Sherlock Holmes arched the brow above one hollow eye. "Or that your wife recently
He wondered whether he should attempt to leave the basement; he'd certainly feel a little more secure closer to the Doctor and the TARDIS, upon which apparently he could get rid of his parasitic shadow. And yet there would be so many people between here and the manager's office in the rush to evacuate the building, and he could not risk bumping shadows with any of them, given how Kirsty had gained her own shadow by stepping into the one cast by the tree. If the Vashta Nerada got
"Have you got the first act of the script yet, Sherlock?" Ben asked enthusiastically as John walked away to find the costume assistant. "I thought you might… like to rehearse with me one day?"
"You know they're only playing that because
"That doesn't mean I don't want it desperately," Sherlock reminded him, grinning. John just laughed in response, patting him on the arm in a consolatory manner and starting towards the door. "Why didn't you say something earlier?" Sherlock asked when they had their coats on, slipping his hand comfortably into John's as he pulled the door closed behind him.
It was some consolation to John that Constable Lestrade seemed not to have a clue what was going on either; he caught John's eye and widened his eyes, asking for an explanation. John shrugged.
The younger man bit his lower lip, briefly reminding John why he'd fallen for him in the first place – he was vulnerable, adorable, friendly,
, something terribly masochistic inside of him insisted. He could feel John smile against his cheek, his body still shifting, his hips undulating in tiny thrusts against Sherlock's.
John exclaimed, turning to face his friend in shock. Sherlock hastily wiped the smile from his face.
Julien lifted an amused eyebrow; Sherlock quickly knocked the expression off his face by grabbing his arm and yanking him upright before tackling him and pushing him onto the bed.
Unexpectedly, both torch and lights all of a sudden relit, flickering once before shining as though nothing had happened. Sherlock blinked up at the overhead lights. "Oh," he said absently. "The lights are back on. Maybe it was just a -"
Sherlock stepped towards him this time, that tiny bit closer to the bed. John groaned at the feeling of Sherlock's skin against his cock through the cotton of his pants and reached automatically to get rid of the offending fabric; his hands met Sherlock's long-fingered ones at his waistband where they had apparently had the same idea, so he left them to it and started on the excessively Slytherin undergarments opposite him.
The detective turned his reassuring smile on her; John raised an eyebrow. Perhaps Sherlock had only directed it at him to practise it. "Miss Devine, my name is Sherlock Holmes, and this is my colleague John Watson. We're here investigating the disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax."
true." His voice turns hard and too-loud, and John flinches. "I don't want you like this
he affirmed. "
Lestrade still frowned, but after a moment he rolled his eyes and relented, shrugging. "You've got a far better chance of getting the truth out of her that way than I do," he admitted reluctantly.
The detective shrugs, taking another mouthful of tea before answering. "Rhubarb leaves."
John retorted, a little sharper than he had intended. After all, though, Cesario was just a boy; a Duke ought not to be schooled in the matter of love by someone who hadn't lived for long enough to understand what he was talking about.
Holmes smirked a little. "You carry yourself like a military man, but you mentioned not having run in years, so your service must have been a while ago. You're favouring your left shoulder as you carry this," he shrugged, bumping their unconscious quarry between them, "so you were invalided out, and the fact that you were walking home through this part of town says you're living on an army pension with no expectations of any other income. People who've been recently invalided home generally spend a little more on rent, with the expectation of having more money in the future. You've accepted that this is it." John realised that his mouth was open and closed it sharply. Holmes didn't miss the movement and smirked again. "And, of course, I've seen your name on playbills every time I've been in London in the last seven years. Allowing time for you to adjust and get back into the theatre, that's eight or nine years since active duty."
Sherlock chuckled, and replied without thinking.
that there had been a bullet lodged inside it somewhere and now there wasn't. He supposed that was a good thing. Or it would have been, if it didn't hurt so much.
John couldn't hold back his smile. "It's fantastic," he said, and pressed their lips together once more. Stamford's quiet, mocking applause was undercut by the sound of Kemp's ringing delivery of
My flatmate and I have just got ourselves a shared tumblr account: mr-csi.tumblr.com. By 'shared', I mean I've used his name, but if he ever actually posts anything I may die of fright. I'll post updates on there, anyway - or possibly explanations for the lack of updates, in any case.
"Are you sure?" Sherlock asked when he finally pulled away. John cupped his cheek with one hand, slightly startled at the serious look in his grey-green eyes. "John, can you promise me?"
"Did you just come here to insult us, then?" John asked irritably, trying to push past him but failing. The man was remarkably solid, for all that his pale skin and black coat made him look like some kind of spectre.
Sherlock looked down, feeling bile rise in his throat. "Yes, Mother. He's downstairs having breakfast."
When the petite, olive-skinned teacher clicked her high-heels to the front of the room and called for silence, she caught Sherlock's eye and nodded in approval. Having got what he needed from the lesson, as her next sentence about evolution proved, Sherlock lapsed back into thoughts of John.
"We've only just met, and we're going to go and look at a flat?"
Sherlock didn't look impressed. "It's fine, I haven't broken anything," he said, somewhat lessening the impact of the statement by wincing on his next step. John chuckled. "I'm certain Lizzie will be back at the house by now, hopefully by the time we get there Billy and our dear Constable Lestrade will be there as well."
it, so he steps forward. "I can show you, Sherlock. Just relax and let me."
John felt his face fall a little. "They could be unrelated," he tried. Sherlock snorted. "What, you don't believe in coincidence?"
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
"Mister Holmes!" the shout comes from behind them, and Sherlock flinches slightly as he sees Trelawney-Hope approach them, arranging his face into an almost painful-looking smile.
That ritual of courtship he could understand, as men occasionally had to play that part. If a woman had given him something - praise, promises, gifts - it was expected that he would give them back, if he wished to court her
Sherlock rolled his eyes, already climbing out of bed and shedding the pants he had slept in. "Well, Lestrade, it is… seven o'clock in the morning," he replied reasonably, glancing at his alarm clock and trying not to sound surprised at the time. Had he
"What?" John asked in surprise, completely left behind by the leap of logic that had apparently just occurred in his friend's mind. "Why? What's going on?"
him, Sherlock's heart is beating this fast because of him. "Okay," he agrees. How could he not? "If you're sure."
The Doctor actually reached across the table and touched his hand. "I'm sorry," he said sincerely. He turned to the waitress and smiled apologetically. "Entschuldigung sie, ich bin traurig," he told her. Sherlock, too, offered her a cursory apology. She made a sound that distinctly sounded like
Sherlock nodded with the barest suggestion of a smile. "Good," he pronounced.
"Excuse me?"
Just as Sherlock began to think he couldn't stand it, it faded abruptly, leaving him trembling on his bed, his hands clutching his stomach – a stomach that felt
John wasn't; he'd never spoken to anyone before that he
Another line scratches into the sand with bitter vehemence. Sherlock's face is emotionless, intent on its task. John wants to reach out and comfort him; he knew Sherlock's childhood was bad, but he never wanted to ask. "Mycroft grudgingly lent me money to rent a flat, because he knew Mother would be upset if I died on the street. The flat was awful. It smelt of urine and the other people in the building were people I never wanted to be like. But it was hard to live in a place like that and not be corrupted a little bit; I started shooting cocaine and chain-smoking." Sherlock savagely stabs out another line in the sand. "From there it's boring. Drugs, depression, hopelessness."
"Lady Margaret Brackenstall," Lestrade breathed slowly while John tipped her head back to open her windpipe. "For some reason I was sure it would be Lady Carfax."
; he couldn't reveal so much of himself with a stranger watching. Not to mention he wasn't sure he could keep his hands off John once the barrier had been lowered, not even for long enough to close the case. The balance between his desire to
," he gasped in the minute gap between their lips as they parted to crash together again like waves breaking against rocks. Sherlock tasted of sweetened coffee and a tiny, homely hint of toast; their tongues slid together in the same frantic, thrusting rhythm as their hips.
After the group was out of earshot, John looked at Bill and sighed.
out of school like this. I can put your mind at rest, though – if you're looking for the small boy in the purple shirt, he's seducing an acquaintance of mine, not looking for trophies from a murder scene or whatever you thought he might be doing here. And said acquaintance doesn't have the brains to be a murder accomplice."
Sherlock eyed him, still completely emotionless. "You're surprisingly calm for someone who's seen the things you've just seen," he commented. "Most people would be slightly unnerved to find out that their best friend thinks about performing sexual acts with them."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, looking unconvinced. "Perhaps," he admitted slowly.
He tries not to look for Sherlock's reaction to this statement so as to appear nonchalant, but even so he registers that the detective is staring at him. Then Sherlock smiles.
"Right, curtain call," Will said suddenly, releasing Sherlock. "You three have to go on last. Send the lovers first, then the mechanicals, and then you three. Everyone stay on stage and we'll do one all together last."
. That would ruin everything.
Julien smirked. "Perhaps then we will have to wait until after Biology."
He makes a mental promise to stop procrastinating. Tomorrow – well, as soon as they get out of whatever's happening here and have a little bit of sleep to freshen things up a bit – he's going to seduce Sherlock. On the double.
, the Doctor had called it. It was a lot more cluttered than he had expected, with protrusions and shapes extending strangely for no apparent purpose. Perhaps he didn't know enough about the way it would work. The Doctor leaned against a console, almost missing and stumbling slightly. "It's bigger on the inside," he said, as though people were routinely surprised by this. Sherlock supposed they must be.
"Well?" Trelawney-Hope asks eagerly. "Where do you think it is?"
Sherlock backed off, his face clearing, and took a seat in front of the desk instead, resting his chin idly on one hand. "And how is Her Majesty these days?" he asked casually.
John begged him.
Sherlock made an irritated noise. "I know, and I can't work like that," he said.
: is obviously based upon Doyle's story from
The smaller woman shrugged and shook her head to indicate that she hadn't heard; Lestrade looked around until he caught sight of the remote on the arm of the settee. He picked it up and reached for the volume button; he thought he might have heard a quick shout of
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "There is a Justice of the Peace on his way," he lied commandingly. "Until he arrives, this coffin remains inside the house."
"That must be frustrating," John said, trying to suppress a smile and failing.
Matt snorted, stabbing violently at his rice. "Lucky you," he muttered. Bradley threw a bit of roll at him.
The playwright's smile did not falter. "I know," he said simply. "I wrote it."
John smiled back and accepted the proffered handshake genially; his attempt to introduce himself in return was cut off by Sherlock. "This is John Watson, formerly of Her Majesty's militia, more recently a lead player in the Lord Chamberlain's Men," he said, sounding almost proud. "John helped me catch that jewel thief a few days ago and will be assisting me here as well."
The sofa behind me depresses as she sits down and her hand rubs my back through my shirt. "Oh, Sherlock," she says softly.
John shifted in his seat until he was facing his flatmate, his heartbeat loud in his ears. "
, he still can, because Sherlock would still rather be with him than the blonde and beautiful woman who threw herself at him ten minutes ago. "Sex really
The alien's green eyes narrowed. "Do dinosaurs count?"
"It's okay." John feels guilty all over again – how can he predict what this would feel like to someone like Sherlock, who has completely cut off that part of his mind and body to the extent that masturbation is a 'necessary evil'?
John stared at him. Sherlock realised how the sentence had sounded after a moment of his gaze. "No, I mean - what he might have done that annoyed her, how she might have picked him out as someone that she wanted to murder. Seeing someone act the way he might have could help."
"I think if you put yourself out there as a submissive, you're going to invite a lot of jerks and losers to subject you to sexual abuse under the name of BDSM," Sherlock retorted. "It's very possible that she'd just never been with anyone who took care of her the way they should have.
There was a part of him that was concerned that Sherlock was only being so affectionate to distract them from the disaster of the morning at Peters' house; that this wasn't the way a rational Sherlock would behave, that this playful aspect of the detective was just as much acting as his time on the stage. But he really had no way of telling, this aspect of their relationship was so new.
that was steadily rising to a shout. "Ignore them," John told him.
Sherlock's proximity doesn't really help, especially since he's what John wants to think about. The fact that the detective is
would it be him? What else have you got? Surely there's more than just a few gardening tools.
it can't be conquered overnight." He released him to arm's length with a sheepish smile. "I'm still fighting mine too. But what I felt last night, that's stronger than my jealousy, and I know it's stronger than yours, so I know we'll get over it. I always thought emotions were inadvisable because they're irrational and they're never certain, but the way I feel about you is one of the most rational and certain things I've ever encountered. I needed to think about that away from you for a moment, so I -"
John tried to pull himself together. "No, it's ok," he insisted, knowing that he didn't sound like he meant it.
John watched as his friend straightened his shoulders and shook out his sleeves with a sharp blowing-out of his cheeks: John recognised the ritual as a muted version of what the other man did to prepare himself for the stage. Then he sighed. "Come on, John," Sherlock barked quickly, pushing open the door with an extravagant movement and striding boldly in.
the building, the entire effort would be futile.
Sherlock sighed. "I know," he said, sparing John a small smile. "This is why I never joined a company."
It was true; Grieg had a smooth tenor voice that rose and fell in nice ways. He told stories off the top of his head from Greek and Roman mythology and legend and history that Sherlock deleted straight after he heard but enjoyed listening to anyway. The blond smiled. "Thank you," he said.
John was the last person to arrive at the Globe; he winced at the frown on Will's face as they closed the stage door quietly behind them. "Sorry, Will," he said quickly. "Sherlock and I were rehearsing together and then we got called back to the crime scene we were at yesterday, another woman's disappeared and I just lost track of time."
I wasn't bluffing when I told him I knew what he was doing. I just didn't think, after three weeks of little subtle things, that he would move quite so fast. John usually likes talking things out; I thought I would at least have some warning before he tried full-on physical affection.
any 'like-minded students' Jim might get on with; he'd thought that everybody fit in
The detective smiled bitterly. "Mycroft," he said. "England's influence across the world has grown tenfold under Elizabeth's reign, but everything she does she does because Mycroft advises her to. And she's old now, her…
Before John could respond, could ask for more information - surely Sherlock couldn't be referring to what they had just done? - the detective had launched himself out of bed, smacking his knee painfully into John's shin as he did so, and landed catlike on all fours on the floor. "We need to leave, now."

When they went their separate ways after Cambridge Julien had attempted to shrug the English genius away, to pursue life and pleasure without him. And then he had called, and they had met for lunches or afternoon trysts at the Estate or the occasional extended trip to France. Sherlock had refused to leave his life but not committed to being in it, and each time Julien reminded himself that he was impartial and found another temporary, boring lover, Sherlock would contact him and he would run to him like the now-detective's booty-call.
There lies your way, due west."
Unfortunately, McAuliffe chose that moment to look around and caught them like that, Bill geared up for another round of convincing and John waving him off. "Murray! If you cannot leave Mr Watson and his talented associate to their work, I will be forced to remove you from the classroom."
John grinned back at the barman, seeing the boy grin out of the corner of his eye. Ben had come to the Lord Chamberlain's Men after Will Shakespeare had found him at the back of a pub, performing something that the company had devised themselves, in which he was playing a lascivious scullery-maid named Molly. The nickname had been with him ever since. John didn't think that the boy minded; it was a reminder of his talent, after all. "Cheers," he replied, lifting the beer in a sort of grateful salute. "Haven't seen Will, have you?"
"Orange, I was getting there. The third victim was found on the beach," he taps the photo. The woman, blonde and ragdoll-thin, has been mercilessly arranged into a ghastly yellow dress almost the exact shade as the sand underneath her. John grimaces. "The first victim was not only stabbed to death but pretty much disembowelled – there was blood everywhere. The second victim's throat had been cut. The third victim was strangled."
Sherlock reached out a hand and slid it onto John's thigh, feeling the warmth of his skin through his trousers. The doctor shifted slightly, letting his legs fall open, and so Sherlock took the invitation and let his hand stroke slowly up the inseam of John's trousers. The move was intended to tease John, but it kindled a slow burn in the pit of his own stomach as well. He hadn't actually felt John's cock in his hand even through his clothes in the course of their roleplays.
Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
Sherlock smiled amiably and reached into his coat pocket for the butler's drawings. "They would have been among other jewels," he said as he unfolded them. "Dropped off by a child, apparently."
or no."
The man had dark curls tumbling around enviable cheekbones. Under the close and intent scrutiny, his warm blue eyes remained steady and his cupid's-bow lips parted into an ever-so-slightly cheeky smile.
"So, Mr Holmes?" Dimmock interjects rudely. "You said you'd found St. Claire."
get nervous speaking to you, too, Master Shakespeare," Ben piped up.
he cried, jumping up once more and pulling Ben into a tight embrace, waiting until the boy hesitantly returned it before forcibly pulling him away and setting him back on his feet.
For a moment, John hesitated. Then he nodded sharply.
The woman sits down, and John can see that she's wearing a large-brimmed hat and dark glasses so that Milverton – and by extension, John and Sherlock through the curtain – can't see her face well enough to identify her. John's heart pushes an extra dose of adrenaline through him just in case, while Sherlock, whose thoughts are obviously running along the same lines, quickens the puffs of his breath against John's neck.
. "Cup of tea?" he suggests finally. Sherlock lowers the violin.
Finally, he drew breath for the opening speech and looked at the boy sitting across from him in a lilac toga, and was so shocked his breath fled again and he had to redraw it.
Sherlock's eyes flashed in excitement. "Murder most foul," he pronounced, before sweeping his black coat from the rack by the door and putting it on so that it billowed out behind him. John rolled his eyes fondly at the inkeep, who gave a rolling chuckle.
As blameful as the executioner?"
To John's relief, the door at the other end of the office opened and Sally let go of him. A tall, curvy brunette peered around the door at them, took in John's embarrassed and dishevelled state and Sally's smug look and grinned. "Sorry, was I interrupting?" she said wryly.
John hummed enthusiastic agreement as they started up the stairs. "You get the fire, I'll get the tea," he negotiated.
Lestrade's always had a sense for how much their landlady does for them, but this –
- I didn't realise until I was typing it out that it's also used in this context in the 2009 Holmes film with Robert Downey Jr.
"Terry!" Bill snapped back in the same tone of voice. A few people at the back of the room tittered.
A glance at Sherlock told him not to say anything; the detective was nodding and smiling at the jeweller as though he agreed entirely. "Well," he said, his voice slightly too high-pitched and genial. "I can see to it that Her Majesty knows the ring is here, and that you are rewarded for holding it safely."
and am starting to feel it a little bit. I think I might even be enjoying myself; the food is incredible, although that might have something to do with the fact that besides the bit of toast John forced down my throat this morning I haven't eaten since the last time he tried to force me, which was at least two days ago.
John can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is the last thing he was expecting. He can't quite help himself stuttering like Molly under pressure and opening and closing his mouth a few times like a demented Koi-carp, fighting the sensation of falling that one gets at the end of a bad dream, wondering when he'll wake up from this one. "What?" After a few seconds of his flatmate watching him in evident amusement, his brain kicks back online with the gasp of the drowning and he belatedly remembers his manners. "I mean, um… congratulations, Sherlock."
, we'd know."
The detective bites his bottom lip minutely, so John takes it as a good sign and presses on. "If it's… if you don't want this
The detective nods again. "Sorry," he says after a pause. John shrugs again. "And I'm sorry I can never remember their names. There have just been too many of them."
a mess. And he wanted to go home.
Hannah shrugged. "I wouldn't sir, if I hadn't seen them… they
And something a little more under siege, he reminded himself, checking the horizon once more. The sky was calm and largely blue, the grass dry but not
"Carfax didn't want to speak to him," John pointed out. "The only thing anyone ever overheard was her telling him to leave her alone. She wouldn't have been telling him intimate details about her acquaintances."
The younger boy shrugged self-deprecatingly. "I have a highly organised mind," he said matter-of-factly. "I've trained myself to encode things in a specific way and I delete irrelevant information."
. Having said that, Sally working for/with Lestrade would not be usual or accepted.
John followed the Constable to the chair and peered down at it; there was indeed a small splatter of brown the colour of dried blood marring the fabric of the seat. Lestrade sighed. "Very well. I ought to question her again."
The thin man's pale lips pursed. "She held her own against him. If he had had his way she would have spent most of her time in this room."
It's interesting to see how John's behaviour has changed around these people. We walked into the restaurant and the redhead – Bill, he introduced himself as – ran up and slapped him on the back. Immediately, his shoulders rolled back, he locked his knees straight to stand up taller and he smiled differently. "Bill," he greeted heartily. "This is my… Sherlock."
Sherlock was still watching him like he'd been nominated for an Oscar. "That's… I mean… that's… admirable," he said, after an extraordinarily long pause wherein John wondered if he were struggling for any positive word at all to describe it.
The two men bite cheerfully at the pink fluffiness as they wander through the rows of stalls. John stocks up on vegetables; Sherlock gets distracted by a pair of handmade wooden earrings shaped into intricate honeybees. John, after a moment's argument, buys them for Mrs Hudson, along with a pair of ladybug-shaped ones for Sherlock to give to Molly by way of apology.
He conducted a quick scan of the room just in case she had left something obvious, a cellphone or a handbag or a wallet, but he wasn't surprised to come up with nothing. They waited while the forensics team conducted a few tests, but Sherlock pulled John out of the room at the first sneer from Anderson, commanding Donovan to call him when they finished. He didn't think they would find anything, and he didn't want to sit around and
It runs on a perverted loop through his head like a scratched record.
"What
The doctor's face froze uncomfortably. "Oh - did you want to go over the murder with me? I just assumed you'd want to do that as soon as we got home."
Julien de Richelieu's eyebrow trembled slightly. "That's correct," he said, his lips curving upwards slightly. "You notice a lot, Sherlock. I heard you were different, but everyone refused to elaborate. You seem to have frightened off the entire school with this talent of yours."
Molly raised an eyebrow at the selfish indulgence.
Lestrade humoured him with the hint of a laugh. "It's only routine at this point," he said reassuringly. "You understand our concern when a missing persons investigation leads us to an undertaker's."
"When I finally got him to back off I… I yelled at him. Everything I never meant to say just came out, everything about how much I hate the way he tries to

He's a bit surprised when Milverton brings his new friend back to the desk and a woman's figure blocks the criminal's face from view. He'd sort of assumed this was some sort of thug's business transaction, but it looks as if it's a transaction of the more vile and intimate kind.

"Whoever said chivalry is dead," Sophia remarked, grinning at John as he followed her off the bus and through the crowds towards the swimming pool, her swimming bag over his shoulder.
"I know they're not," John replied, slightly taken aback by the detective's reaction to the statement. "I just meant -"
He grinned in response. "Probably not. I was on my way home from the pub, might have got a bit carried away. I haven't run like that in years."
So a lot of the beginning of this is my take on John's POV of a scene from the show. I know it frustrates me a bit when people take dialogue straight from the source material (and I've paraphrased bits of it, which will frustrate some people even more) so I thought I'd just warn you beforehand. Thought of other ways to do this scene but they didn't work quite the same way.
"You'd bloody better have something of worth,
But Will wasn't here now, and John couldn't stop looking. Even the thickest and most oblivious person in London couldn't deny that Sherlock was physically attractive, but it wasn't only the creamy curve of his neck or the way his trousers cupped his buttocks that drew John's eyes. There was something indefinably

The aforementioned DI looks from Sherlock to John, both of whom give him their brightest smiles. Lestrade gets the creeping feeling they're both holding knives behind their backs. "Uh, just black, thanks," he stutters confusedly. Sherlock nods sharply and ventures back into the kitchen, the picture of domesticity.
"But you cannot be sure," Sherlock dismissed. He waited for the confirming shrug before standing, pushing the straight-backed chair noisily back from the table. "Thank you for your time, Mr Miracle, you have been… most helpful."
Sherlock smiled grimly. "Doubt it," he rejoined. "But at least it's the last one."
The detective didn't pull away, but his body sagged in disappointment. He curled his fingers slowly around John's until he was almost holding his hand.
Kirsty snorted. "Bob Jones and John Smith?" The Doctor shrugged sheepishly, giving Sherlock a quick shake of his head that made his hair flop into his green eyes and out again. "I don't care who you are or why you're using fake names if you can help us stop these murders. I've never seen anything like them."
that had been rife in the months following.
John grinned, shrugging. "I hardly did anything on this one," he says offhandedly, and wanders off to his bedroom.
"Who else could that be?" the detective agreed, but he sounded surprised. "You're sure?" he asked Billy.
amazing.
"I guess so," John replied, answering both Sherlock's and Billy's question at once. He looked down at the boy. "Thanks, again," he said brightly, and hurried off down the alley to catch up with the actor.
John couldn't help but grin back; a little crime-fighting would definitely break up the day's monotony. "As long as I'm back in time for

A shout escaped John's lips; the pressure had forced the air from his stomach right out of his mouth and the surprise of discovering that both of them were suddenly, achingly hard had given voice to the air in a far-too-loud
John felt himself bristle. "Why not?" he asked, trying not to sound indignant. He knew he

behaved this way before."
John shrugged. "No," he said helplessly. "I didn't know much about him, really. He was fine, and then one day he wasn't, and he wouldn't talk to me about it. Then the next day he was gone."
The kid rubbed his bicep gingerly. "Jim," he introduced. "And yeah, I did kind of get that for myself."
John snorted. "You called a few people in the hope that
Then we both collapse into giggles.
John's expecting the sigh of irritation this time. "Do you understand how serious this is, my Lady?" he asks.
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
A moment later, he was back to staring in the girl's direction with the worst kind of wistful look on his freckly face. John wasn't kidding about wanting to be shot before such a look ever graced his own features. Bill sighed. "I don't know why she hates me so much," he said dramatically.
on the lone armchair, leaving John to look around in vain for another place to sit before perching on the edge of one arm, carefully avoiding his friend's long-fingered hand. "A portion of Lady Brackenstall's jewellery has been recovered," he pronounced, taking the packet from an inside pocket of his coat. "I am simply handing it in to the appropriate authority."
glances. "What, Carl?" John replied politely, turning around to face the bigger boys. It was odd, he mused, how some people looked as though they were born to be bullies.
"A little harder," he suggested, squirming as John complied. "Ah! Yes – faster, Vince, please, I need – oh,
Sherlock smiled haltingly, and Joe smiled back, his blue eyes warm. "I… I just want to know, Sherlock," he said after a moment. "What
The office door opened and closed through the speaker twice; Sherlock frowned at the second time when Marchbanks' voice announced his arrival. "Is there anything we can do, sir?"
They kissed lazily, but the mischief Sherlock had been displaying the entire afternoon was still evident in the flicks of his tongue and the wandering of his hands; John couldn't help but be delightfully surprised by this side of his new lover. "What's got into you?" he panted when they broke apart for breath.
"Sherlock…"
"Would you go so far as to say that the two were confidants?" The Constable asked.
"Is there a cloth around somewhere?" the lanky alien asked briskly. "So we can clear the dust off the window? This will be a lot easier if we can see them. And they can see us," he added as an afterthought. Sherlock bent and fished out a folded and itself ridiculously dusty towel from under a desk much like the ones they had had in his primary school. The rubber cap on the end of one of the legs was even missing, he noticed as he bent. The desk swayed slightly with the disturbed air as he swept the towel out from underneath it.
on video in the holidays, we should put it on before the girls grab the room and start watching that new Meg Ryan film."
Everyone stared at Will and the stagehand, leaving a few precious minutes' silence. The playwright sighed. "So we'll have to find someone else," he said.
, men he'd like to sit down and have day-long conversations with, rather than people he thought of for their looks and sensuality alone, and so he'd dismissed the idea, decided once and for all that while he was completely open to the idea of bisexuality he was himself entirely straight.
A few more deep breaths later, the detective nods. "I think so. But I can't… I couldn't… John, you make me feel so much, I can't cope, I can't do it." His head hits his hands again. "John, I'm so sorry. I'm just not… I can't, I can't do it."
John grinned. "Follow your spirit," he continued, "and upon this charge -"
John crossed his arms, his eyes still blazing with finality and determination. "I mean I won't role-play with you anymore. This is ridiculous, and it's gone on for long enough."
listen to me." His eyes flickered over to Sherlock; he took it as a cue to turn the lights back on, keeping them at the intensity that they had been at when he switched them off.
She has indeed shorn several inches off her sleek hair; what had been a long bob when she had come to see them at Baker Street now hugs the curve of her jaw and makes the angular structure of her face seem more pronounced and severe. At Sherlock's scrutiny, however, she smiles, the sharp ridge of her cheekbones flushing pink. "Yes, thank you."
Sherlock pouted even as his eyes started to water from the stinging pain in the back of his hands. "Or what?" he asked pettily.
After a moment's deliberation, John placed one hand on Sherlock's shoulder as if in comfort, pulling the younger man closer.
Trusting Sherlock to know his own body, John nodded. His friend dropped one hand to fondle his dog's ears. "Spock gave him to me when I was six," he explained, smiling fondly at the animal. "A living thing that I could show my emotions to, so that I didn't have to show them to the other children. I thought I could calm myself down with him. It worked for a while."

He flicked his coat closed across his chest and hummed thoughtfully. "If we walk quickly we might just have time to run these scripts when we get there," he commented, one hand patting his top pocket. "I believe there's only one scene that we are in together, but all the same."
The Duke took a backseat in the scene for a while so John stood by and watched Cesario get more and more confused, with the addition of the largely unfamiliar actor playing Antonio and accusing Sherlock of offences he had not committed.

look after Donovan. "All right," the burly man said. "Let's get going. I'll see you next week, guys."
He chuckles. "No, probably not – not if I have any say in the matter."
"He wanted to suggest someone he's worked with before to play his twin brother," John's friend replied easily. John began to change into his toga in an attempt to not look too interested, but was met with a wry smile for his efforts. "And he had a few suggestions for further development of
He knows he should probably apologise. He's not sure where he went wrong in his deductions, what he failed to see, but there must have been something and it was almost certainly his fault. Even if Sherlock turns out not to be prepared to give him a chance in a romantic way, he refuses to acknowledge that this might have destroyed their
Neither of them is in a particularly good mood by the time they get inside. John just wants to get to his room, slam the door so hard something shatters and scream as loud as he can to relieve some of the tension bubbling under his skin. And then maybe sit down somewhere away from Sherlock and think about where to go from here.
The former Slytherin grinned and lifted his own mug to return the gesture. "Have a Cauldron," he suggested, nudging the box towards John.
John took a moment to watch him arrange himself on the little bed - too small really for two grown men, but it was bigger than John's so it would have to do - long limbs spread to the four corners, milky chest extending into trousers that were looking more uncomfortably tight with each drawn breath. Sherlock watched John watch him, one eyebrow cocked in amusement at the unavoidable trajectory of his eyes down the slope of his stomach. He reached one hand down to the fastenings on his dark trousers, sliding it playfully against the growing bulge there as he went, his grey-green eyes never leaving John's.
His teeth were alarmingly white – John would have assumed he was American if he didn't speak with a strong Northern accent. "Yeah, sorry," he replied, kicking his bag away from the seat's footroom. "First posting?"
"Here," he says briskly. "I made breakfast – don't look at me like that, Sherlock, you need to eat." He dumps the tray on Sherlock's legs. "You're going to eat your toast and drink your tea, then you're having a shower and getting dressed. Then we're going out."
"What? No, I'm not that stupid." Bill shook his head as though John was being ridiculous. John snorted.
It wasn't quite
Which wasn't at all an impossibility. John would be the first to admit that the sound of Sherlock getting off is enough to make him freeze where he stands, his toes curling in his shoes – and since they began their relationship, John has come home to that sound more times than he can count because Sherlock will freely admit that John walking in on him has always been his biggest fantasy.
"I notice things," Sherlock said, as though it were nothing. "Like, for example, the badge poking out of your top pocket. The corner is scuffed, which in itself is suggestive: you get it out a lot, which means you need to prove yourself to civilians. The line of policework which lends itself most to that is homicide investigation. But the scuffed corner makes the inside visible, and from there the conclusion is obvious. You're still wearing the wedding ring, but the mark is visible from where it usually sits on your finger, which means you've been playing with it a lot more than usual – the fact that you have a mark at all indicates that you don't play with it normally, so you've been thinking about your marriage. Your posture tells me you've been sleeping somewhere temporary, probably a sofa, and the residue of mashed banana you don't realise you have in your hair suggests the sofa of a young first-time mother. Sister was just a guess, but really there weren't too many people it could have been."
he instructed him, as though he could move with John's hands on him.
that you added to those scenes. Both of you," he added, casting Ben a glance. "
The curtains flew open; Sherlock yelped, sitting up quickly, his wand flying across the room as he struggled to cover his erection. John let out a surprised shout, his mouth falling open for a moment before he seemed to recover himself and turned around abruptly. "

The DI shrugs. "No problem. Spare bedroom's always yours if you need it, mate."

, to want to do it again and again and again for as long a period as possible. He slid his hands tantalisingly slowly down the flat expanse of Sherlock's belly to the hook-and-eye fastenings on his trousers and bent his head to take a dusky nipple between his teeth.
She sighed, her eyes rising to the viewing window again before lowering to her cuffed hands. "I didn't do it to hurt her," she said, her voice small and pathetic. "I knew that it would, but that wasn't why I did it." Her hands twisted around each other as she stared at them. Then she took a deep breath and looked up at Lestrade. "Is that enough of a statement for you?" she asked. "I don't think I have anything else to say. I know murder was the wrong way to go about things and I didn't chose this road until I was halfway down it, but if it makes Charlotte realise how much she's worth - if it makes her think twice before she goes for someone like that again - then I don't regret it."
