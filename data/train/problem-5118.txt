“Rebound?” Dean mutters.
The paper went back on the desk, the pen flicked in and out of the inkwell. Eileen wrote quickly and held up the paper once again.
But what a superficial scan might miss, a ‘voluntary confession’ might deliver. Of course Uriel was not allowed to torture confessions out of people ordinarily. But right now there was no-one around to stop him. Jonah and Zach were quite content with letting the sheriff do his job, it seemed, since Sam was technically in sin for interfering with a tracker and his quarry  - even though he really hadn’t known who the woman getting tossed around was and had only stepped forward out of professional reflex. And they had absolutely no interest in knowing what kind of method, legal or otherwise, Uriel was using to extract a confession. Once he had the confession, the angel would be quietly absolved of the means.
Dean licks his lips. “...It was rough. The spell.”
“It won’t be in our lifetime, I imagine,” Luke admits, though he doesn’t seem to care, he’s staring off to the west again, or maybe into the future. “But we can sow the seed. And one day…”
“Which tells us zilch. No, wait, it tells us these hillbillies were even more backwards than we were when the Apocalypse rolled around. Christ-“
“Yeah.”
“We’ve been tracking you since Denver. Remember Denver?”
“After this, I don’t think the host will attack us.”
“So they say.”
”Right.” Dean took a deep breath and picked up the penknife again. It wasn’t ideal for this kind of surgery, but the knife he would have preferred to use had been in his get-away pack, presumably in the garrison storage now, and he didn’t have anything else to hand except for the angel blade gleaming silver and gold at him under the lamplight, giving him the heeby jeebies.
“Don’t agree to anything he says.
As the sun reaches the noontime mark above their heads, shedding a little light into the gloom of the forest, Dean marches, fully armed and armored, up to the entrance of the tower. Overhead the slate grey stone looms, rising above the treeline like it's about to rear forth and devour it. The door used to be fortified, but the left panel has fallen off its lower hinges, leaving a gap with darkness beyond. Above the entrance, under a shroud of dusty ivy, the words NO ENTRY are etched onto the lintel.
“What does this mean for Rob?” Dean asks, before biting his lip.
“The Machine is the manifestation of my Father, His presence here on earth, living among you,” Cas answered levelly after a moment’s reflection. “He knows us as well as the day He made us, He has judged that we are a match. He knows of your transgressions and your past and your current beliefs, and He has still made the decision to bring us together and bless this union with His intent. There is a reason for this. Maybe I truly am here for your redemption.”
Yeah, Dean can hear that. An accent like that hasn’t wandered over from New England in quite awhile. Was there a bad breeze blowing this morning?
“...Brother? Are you…?”
Yet it was Castiel who started the fight.
“How the hell - that’s smooth!” Castiel gasps.
“Hey!” shouts Dean to get the ball rolling.
Dean tries to imagine this guy - a guy who can fly - locked ten years in a tower for no particular reason other than paranoia on the part of one parent and indifference on the part of the other. And here Dean thought king John could be a bit high handed and hard assed at times… Not that it was an excuse or anything, but…
“What-”
Once, the monster that cornered him was a demon, a familiar one. Not Crowley. When Crowley features in his dreams, it’s wearing a sombrero and sipping on a fruity cocktail while trying to tell Dean how to groom hellhounds. No, this demon is familiar, though not one Dean has ever faced. It wears his features, his freckles, his assuredness, his flannel shirt, his smirk beneath its all black eyes.
Castiel looked back at him, eyebrows arching up. Was he surprised at Dean’s forthrightness? Dean was sort of surprised too, really. It was as if his gut was saying, yeah, don’t bother lying. And really, what was the point? Both he and Cas knew the score. If he had to choose to pointlessly dick around with the truth like a snake-oil salesman who didn’t have a hope in hell of rooking this particular customer, or just putting it out on the table, Dean was going to go with the latter.
“You say the weirdest stuff at times. Look, dude, some would say it’s destiny. A fair maiden saving my life, vanishing before I can thank her, then fate leading me to find her again after a year of searching-  it’s a grand tale, it’s poetry, it’s fated love, all that.”
“I’m calling him Bravo and you can eat your heart out, Dean.”
“No, no, we’re better off together-”
The grin widens, shows teeth. It’s not threatening, it’s appreciative, almost encouraging. Like he’s downright proud of Dean for making such a lovely threat in the circumstances. Something deep in Dean’s gut goes cold, hard, uncomfortably sharp. With a curt gesture he pushes back his hood so it won’t impair his range of vision. He’ll negotiate while he can, but he has a feeling this ain’t gonna end in a handshake and a mutual parting of ways.
Cas crossed his arms and glowered. “Are you saying he’s disobeying the Machine?”
But that’s evolution. That’s survival. It’s what the world is nowadays. The virus apocalypse, the fall of civilisation a hundred years ago and every hard winter since have hammered humanity and their best friend into a singular mold, and what’s come out, hard and hardy and pitiless, is just the model that is the best survivor, all extraneous matters pruned out.
From his tone and the way Elliot and Max are looking meekly at him from the other side of the table - formerly the dining room’s, now an operating one - they already gave him a quick review and he’s having a hard time believing them.
“One way to find out!” Henrietta declared, picking it up and fishing out some bullets and powder charges from her bandoleer. She ignored her brother’s legitimate objections to firing a gun built by a drunkard.
“We’re- it’s- you’re not seriously-...really?!”
Dean waves in that direction. “Sign in the book, or if you ain’t at ease with letters, make your mark. Then have a talk with the recruiter, he’ll sign off with the commander of the watch and get you situated in a regiment. We won’t be moving out all that soon. I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Beast Alastair is dead along with his top officer. I think we can expect a few months of peace before we-”
“I know! He’ll kill us if he finds us!” said Panic with the naked terror Dean had expected ages ago finally flashing a fin.
“The borders will be rebuilt. All of them. The angels are going back to Heaven where they belong, and they’ll stay there. They’ll be protectors of the Spheres again, guardians of the natural order, but they will no longer be able to interfere with humanity.”
“We’re tougher than you think,” Cas grumbles behind him. “Even between the ears.”
“Cool. What’s our strategy?”
“Tomorrow, Cole.” Dean’s already looking past the pain in the ass, tallying his people, seeking from them the connection and the quiet obedience he’s been getting from them without pomp or ceremony since that fight near the ice river. “Promise. Since you’re begging for it.”
“Put me down on the ground, and get these things out of my back,” Cas said in a ‘what did you think?’ kind of way.
Cas returns the embrace in silence for a few seconds. “She’ll be pushing. And she won’t be the only one if I can’t quash them adequately from the start. If we don’t feel as if I’m mastering them… then my body won’t respond and I won’t be fertile.”
“Pay attention. No passing out just yet. Just because you’re getting the standard package, doesn’t mean I don’t do good work.”
He was about to add more, but Castiel spun on him and gave him a look in which he deliberately let slip some of his anxiety and frustration. Dean’s eyes narrowed, either in warning or in appraisal.
But that wasn’t his job. He just had to get Sam and the others here safely and then keep an eye around St Louis. He’s been hard at it since they arrived, unable to relax with the countryside potentially full of Crowleys and other assholes.
“I- I’m so sorry, Dean,” he finally said. “I never imagined you’d be so worried, I’m sorry I caused you any anxiety.”
That explains part of the mystery, and snaps Dean out of his stupor. “You attacked your bro?! You turned your brother into a fucking
, while the angel had saved them both.
The lid hits the counter with a loud rattle. Cas’s shoulders have tensed and he’s staring straight ahead.
It’s nightfall by the time they make it back to the bunker. Home. It still feels like home, even though it’s now shot through with a tang of suspicion, lies and residual anger, and naturally Dean is not there. So, pretty much on par with his other home up in Heaven, then, Castiel reflects morosely.
“This is for me.”
“Here! You find a spot, you tell me!”
of the table leg’s leaves growing and sprouting. But as the divine power slowly tapers off and flickers like a candle about to gutter, other noises intrude. There’s a lot of shouting outside. “Hold the line!” someone yells. Another voice Castiel can barely make out is calling Dean’s name frantically. It sounds like the humans are rallying and are trying to push the demons and dead armies back.
The fight is some three hundred feet away, at the very edge of the lake. A possessed human has just fallen to the ground, rolling in agony as the salt eats into his belly, burning the demon riding him. There are at least four more bodies on the mud and sand, gutted by the demon-killing knife still stuck in the ribs of one of them.
”I would have to check with Naomi."
“Why on earth would you go there?”
“We worship Religion in New Eden. I mean we worship God naturally, but we deify Religion itself at the same time, that and the Hierarchy. Religion is what brought us out of the dark ages decades ago, and yes, the preachers are right, I’ll give them that. Secularism and pluralism are luxuries of the past -”
“Exhausted, but I ain’t gonna get no sleep until we get this sorted,” said Dean with a caricature of a smile.
“Sh.”
Pah-Ne-Me's rifle shakes and sinks to the snow.
Divine sight picks out the advance of the spreading miasma rising from the cellars of a dozen boarded up houses surrounding the castle. It is oily black at its densest, a plague of pure corruption, but ahead of that noxious pool runs transparent veils of airborne poison, reacting with any liquid it finds to burn human skin, eyes and lungs. The clouds slither and pool along the ground, surging up when they hit an obstacle to kill here or there indiscriminately, leaving the survivors reeling back in horror, fleeing in incomprehension. Anyone knocked over in the stampede screams, seizes up, claws blindly at the empty sky, further spreading panic.
“My brother sounds like an overconfident ass-”
“It’s locked!” Cas seems over the moon.
A twitch of a smile moves Dean’s lips, an expression as hopeful as the dawn. “Yeah, just you.”
“Yeah, He didn’t. Right? Which was why that ambitious toad, Metatron, was hoping that having Mike’s meatsuit to hand the day our brother wanted it would be worth a whack of power. I managed to scrap Metatron before he could spill the beans. Unfortunately, once Michael actually started actively looking for his vessel, one of his agents followed Metatron’s trail all the way to P342. Naomi and all them were starting to look into your little dead-end Paradise. Not very efficiently, but they had to be getting close to figuring things out. So what does the Machine do, hm?”
Castiel shakes his head.
“What…?”
- So that was the verdict: the Joker, the railroad, the resistance, they all thought the angels might break him after all, or use him against the cause, so they were enforcing the role he’d accepted the day he’d become a linchpin.
Castiel ignored the blasphemy. “He only said it because he cares about you and Dean. It was a promise of retaliation if you were harmed. Since I am not going to harm either of you, the threat is moot.” Most of Castiel’s focus was on Dean’s expression, he couldn’t make out all the shifts and currents there, the reflection was small.
Needless to say, this past month had blown that hard-won peace and stability to kingdom come. His John Winchester side came dangerously close to boiling up a few times, especially when
“If the Joker’s the one who took Sam, and he’s the one who’s gonna explain the big picture, why are you here?” Seemed risky to have a head of the resistance and the head of the railroad in one place, even if that place was the last place an angel would think to look.
“Oh. Maybe Uriel’s hobbling is psychological... What would you have done if Sam had been booby trapped?”
from interfering. You will be right on his doorstep. He-”
Eventually they got food and fluids down him, and Henrietta asked him about the gun he’d made.
“Hey, the wine was fancy. The one Michael left behind.”
“But he’s telling us to.” Dean grabbed the note and stared. “And also... sorry, but how did she die? Annael?”
“Cas-...” Sam turned around in the doorway to the parlor and to his room beyond. “Humans are complicated. Don’t-...” He did not seem to know how to finish that, whether it was an admonition or a ‘don’t worry about it’. He turned abruptly and left. Dean had walked straight up the stairs without a word and without turning back.
“What the
It was Charlie who got hurled through the plate glass window when it turned out the trackers were closer on their trail than initially thought, and she’d run into Uriel while getting her charges out of immediate danger.
Their bodies are still pressed together from the waist down, but Dean isn’t entirely there anymore; eyes not meeting his, hands now on Castiel’s shoulders as if he’s going to shove the angel away.
Balthazar’s gaze settled idly on the city around them. “That ‘no dying’ may be a bit of an obstacle. Dean’s bean is still trapped, right? Sooner or later, someone’s going to ask to see this extraordinary human and touch his mind-“
A scared omega shuts down, a scared beta lashes out.
“And what about Cas?”
Dean’s jaw tightened. Then he said, “No.”
“Look, I know I said a lot of horse shit about my mysterious destined person this past year, but I was mainly joking about that, trying to get a rise out of you. For real, that was never going to happen on the spin of a ha’penny anyway. Cas, if my savior does show up tomorrow and she - or he - can actually prove they’re the one, what do you think will happen?”
“You’re the one who’s corrupted, Michael,” Cas bit back (one of the judges gave him an extra point for that, but immediately took it away again for the lack of ‘you jackbooted shit!’ or anything truly scathing in the follow through.) “You’ve destroyed this world. We won’t let you destroy ours.”
Bobby was kin, all up in the Winchester code same as the rest of them, gruff and reserved. Dean had never seen a look so raw, open and fierce on the man’s face.
“I do?” Dean’s eyes slid shut. “It’s just that thing with the thing. I can do that another day.”
Cas looks at him like he’s the new Messiah. “Well reasoned, Dean. I actually hadn’t thought of it in quite that light before.”
Castiel gasped. Balthazar let go of Dean’s shoulder, and the shimmering thing - Balthazar’s wing, presumably - dipped and vanished.
His gaze flinches from Dean to Castiel, to Dean again, then something in his frame relaxes. The next emotion arrives on schedule; not reproach or disapproval, as Castiel feared, not outright joy either. A muted concern.
“We were down here for a year when we were all banished-”
In which Dean demonstrates what a great communicator he is, and Cas shows he can be a great listener too.
“It’s okay - it’s okay, they’re thick -” Castiel quickly wipes away the lasagna from his pants with the salad tongs. His thighs are getting a bit hot, but he’ll live. The raccoon, though…
. They tried to kill your brother!”
“Yes. Sam said this could be an alternate universe where the full heavenly contingent still exists, as well as alternative versions of ourselves.” Cas went back to staring long and hard at his counterpart.
The racoon had taken exception to this.
In that mausoleum hush, Dean said: “Yeah, you’re all that alright, but I got a bone with teeth in it.”
“You!” It was fortunate Michael picked up the thread of the conversation as Castiel had no idea where to begin. “You dare- where the devil have you been?! The whole castle has been searching for you! It has been pandemonium! And you burst in here like- like-”
“Hey now!”
“He might get distracted by all the pretty critters on the way over,” Dean said slowly. “Sure we should hold back on our cribbage? He might not make it on time.”
it! If only I’d noticed last night! But he sent down that he felt ill - Christ! - and I didn’t want to bother him so I didn’t check if he was in his room - bed not even
“Don’t let her close enough to slip a hex in your pockets, is all I’m sayin’.”
Castiel heard the “Or else” loud and clear anyway.
It’s hard and a little awkward; their noses bump and Castiel’s upper lip is caught sharply against his teeth. He blinks rapidly at Dean’s right ear in his direct line of sight, a very confused thought about pizzas going through his multidimensional mind before it’s swept away by an influx of sensation… and an aching, unparalleled love for the man close to him, touching him, the light of his soul as warm as the sun where their lips meet.
“Like there’s any other kind.”
“Shit, our life is weird, man.”
“No, it’s above board... Yeah, real sorry, Cas, but I gotta tell you, this, uh, spell she’s working on, it’s going to take awhile. Four months, maybe more.”
“Yes,” Cas said shortly. “I would not have complied otherwise.”
“Barely a scuffle then.” Dean pats the back of the hand that’s still fisted on the mantelpiece. “Don’t worry, Cas, this is normal, your body is changing-”
“A- what?”
“I, yes, I need to go back to the breaker, it’s near the turbine.” Not exactly in the same direction, but Cas is looking at the dispersing troup of betas in his omega way: head lowered, gaze only flickering up quickly to features and down again. He’s… not intimidated exactly, but the way he moves and holds himself now smells a little of retrenchment, of caution, and no wonder.
The dude looks, if anything, even more depressed. “...My memory… is fuzzy after so many years. I no longer remember my name. You may call me Oddity.”
“Novak, step on it, I just sent Merrick up to ring the last bell.”
“Dean?”
“We can’t leave.” Sam’s face, tired and worn, tightened. “Dean... it’s complicated. But... but we can’t go outside. Not yet.”
“Sure, but he was also the only person left who could kill the boss, and first in line to take over if he did, so…” Crowley's shrug made the outcome sound predictable to him, though Dean imagined it had probably taken Rafael by surprise. Dean felt a pang of longing for his and Cas’s home dimension where most of their holy forces were decimated and every one of their archangels were comfortably dead or in a cage.
“Yes. No. I don’t know.”  The dark deep voice brushes around the walls, steady and blunt. “In part it was to spare him my mother’s imagination, I suppose. But… I was angry. And the king was already dead.”
Once more that singular pause of an angel reorienting his thoughts towards the ability to speak.
A year ago, a beta brute would have growled, “John ordered me to bring ya, no thanks needed.” John did order him to take Cas here, but today’s Dean would have done it anyway.
Shut up-) - it didn’t look broken, but somehow these tablets had been removed, which meant somewhere there was- was an empty space for them. But there didn’t seem to be anything missing, and this wasn’t actually a piece of clockwork, it was-
“Dean.”
“Antonia Covarrubias… cantrip de los condenados… Yes, that might make sense of it if this is
Dean silently put down the small plate and cup at the edge of Sam’s desk and walked away.
...Dean would not go to Heaven, not with the sigils in his mind, he was lost if he did not remove them. But even if he did... he would not have a soulmate who could join him there forever.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you’re sure it’s not- not gratitude or-....”
“No, the guy who just walked away. He was heading towards us, then Singer turned him back. Big fella, white shirt, brown coat, cloth cap.” Tom’s eyes were glittering black and suspicious, nailed to a tall figure disappearing into the crowd. An easy-to-spot tall figure.
“That was actually what I was angling for from the beginning. Doofus.”
But Cas merely shrugs. “I don’t think we need one, no. Your bed is bigger than the bunk I had in the omega barracks, and that was large enough. In fact on cold nights we’d even share, so I think you and I will be fine.”
The whisper, broken and scared, fell from his lips.
Benny moves a piece. “Checkmate.”
“What do you mean?”
“Yeah. As soon as he heard Crowley, he was off like a shot. He didn’t seem to be that good a liar, I don’t think he expected to be questioned, but still, you’d think he would have tried to brazen it out rather than tackle a room full of betas, one with a shotgun on him. Why did he think the gig was up as soon as we mentioned Crowley?”
“I can try.” Dean’s voice was a rumble Castiel could feel where their chests connected. At some point during Dean's description of a history that was theirs and yet entirely unknown to Castiel, he’d pulled the latter up against him and was holding him close. “I’m not very good at it. Using my words, I mean. Tried once or twice.”
And she’s up on the far end of the long table heading straight towards Castiel!
There was a flap behind them.
"...Fine. Just don’t let me hear you say it."
They’ll be seeing those two forces of nature again soon, he’s sure. It goes without saying that both ladies have their own rooms assigned and ever ready for them back at the bunker. But after both battles and babysitting, they deserve some free time. And Dean has another set of strong steady hands to help with Rob now.
wrong!”
“They wouldn’t be, would they. Not in your world. I see it now. You don’t want us to be better. You want us to be
“Awesome,” Dean muttered in his ‘unimpressed’ voice- and gasped as he was jerked backwards.
Nobody was particularly surprised when Castiel visited the chapel rather than join them in their revelry. They think it’s hilarious how he eschews the traditional soldier’s entertainments with a puzzled air to go and do something boring instead. Castiel pays no heed to the snickers and the over-the-top eye rolls directed at his back.
That was the problem. Of the advocate or the interrogator, who would get here first? And which interrogator would it be? Uriel, for his part, would need one who’d have the balls, so to speak, to risk the politically dangerous task of digging around an advocate’s brain - Sam’s mouth twisted as he remembered Jonah virtually fleeing the scene earlier rather than get dragged into this. Besides, Uriel had to suspect that Sam was trained to hide some of his thoughts from scans. He was John Winchester’s son, after all. Sam was as different from his father as chalk was to cheese (whatever Dean had to sarcastically say on the matter), but that was one thing he’d let his John teach him. If the interrogator didn’t dig dare to deep enough, didn’t dare to break past his resistance, didn’t find anything to sustain Uriel’s accusations, they’d have to let Sam go, and then where would the poor sheriff of P342 be? All alone with no-one to torture...
“All clear, I’m coming in, don’t smite me.”
Yeah.
“...No, don’t think so. It’s not like I sent him a celebratory email or anything.”
“I told you, I don’t fear infection,” Cas groused, trying somewhat unsuccessfully to remove his shirt. He’d gotten the duster off, more by wriggling out of it than removing it.
“Who?”
“Blow me down, I actually made it.” Dean came through the door and leaned against it like he was expecting a phalanx of soldiers to burst through behind him. He didn’t look directly at Castiel, just thrust out his hand. “Here, for you.”
“I should hope so! I mean, no offence to your brother-”
Dean jumps, and has to catch the notebook as it slides off his lap. “Huh? Me?!”
“One of the rogues, before I-... caught him. He hid this from us, you understand, we didn’t know. He, they, he and the human he was with, they had a child. A nephilim.”
“He’s with me,” says a gravelly voice over his shoulder, kindly supplying the words Dean was fishing for.
Dean almost trips over himself as he backpedals- his back hits the wall and he’s still trying to move away, hands up like he’s pushing back. “I can’t- I can’t- I can’t do this, Cas- I’m going insane!”
“Interesting guy, right?”
“No.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“They’ll be as joyless and dense as you are then,
Cas, looking critically at their cabin again, bites his lip. “A larger bed will take up a lot of space, though. If we keep this one, I could make myself a small desk and put it over there.”
There was not a hole big enough for Alfie to hide in right now, from the look on his face. He was making a good attempt to disappear into his dark frock coat and high collared shirt like a turtle
“Kid,” Dean tells a red-faced and whinging Robbie, “I hope that when you’re old enough to understand words…. you’ll be old enough to understand your old man’s bullshit. Feel free to call me on it anytime.”
“I just had two days of rest,” Dean objected. He only got back from the bunker about an hour ago, giving him just enough time to go make up the next round of bottles and start a laundry.
“Huh?” Sam seems startled. “That doesn’t sound that bad.”
“Let me take point,” Dean cautions. “She can’t hit me with her voodoo.”
- and close by, pushed into a corner, stands Cas, looking alarmed.
“I do wonder one thing… do you remember conceiving? I presume not, since you believe some bike person was involved.”
“I know who he is better than you do, vampire,” said Cas in an odd, flat, dangerous voice. “He’s the man who started the apocalypse. The gun he is looking for is the Colt, his Colt, the one that allowed Azazel to move forward with his plans and trigger the war before we were ready. One of the most powerful weapons in existence, a weight that could tip almost any scale, and are you saying that you
“You sound tired too.” This question is more pointed.
“Yeah, hope you didn’t mean for us to sleep out in the street. I think there’s a decree against that,” Dean drawled.
“Yeah, need some more wood.”
Castiel got up and shook his hands clean of dirt. “I think she would approve of you,” he said apropos of nothing. “She liked humans. But we need to go quickly now. We could have trackers on our trail.”
“It might not be her.” Sam’s playing devil’s advocate even though he’s the one who picked up the lead and dug up the dirt. “After all, none of them actually died.”
“It’s weird, right?” Dean says - he’s gagged the ragged thing strapped to his torture table so that the screams don’t interrupt his monologue. This isn’t a masterpiece, not one of those he makes to impress Alastair, it’s just a job some demon mook handed him. Dean is getting a lot of overtime, covering for Hell’s finest who are off fighting. For some reason, the infernal army doesn't want Dean on the front line. Sure, he’s not actually a demon yet; still only a damned soul, so very, very damned. But he can already fight better than a lotta demons down here, as he’s shown on numerous  occasions (Alastair loves to egg him on.) No matter. The sound of fury is getting closer, flashes of pure bright light regularly shatter a darkness that’d seen nothing more than molten red or wet crimson since creation began, and in Dean’s estimate, this little torture room deep in the Pit is gonna
quite peaceful until your arrival.”
“That’s convenient.” But also true. It’s not like they posted the circumstances of Drew’s demise on the trees all around camp for the magpies to read. Even other packs John warned about this probably only got informed ‘some foreign beta up to no good approached one of our omegas, put up a fight, got shot.’ Nobody but those involved would know the blow-by-blow.
When Dean steps out the door on that first day with a promise he’ll be back soon, he’s so high on happiness that he expects all his friends to be outside the door ready to yell Congratulations! He’s astonished that they’re not. He’s still getting over the surprise - and he’s never getting over the warm fuzzy amazement of
“Prayin’ for our prince’s safe return. Say they’re all the ones he fed last winter when even the crows were dropping dead out of the sky. St Bibiana turned them out of the chapel so they’re gathering here. The gate officer wants to know what we should do with them. Lord Robert told me he’d clip my ears if I asked him anything not related to the prince vanishing, so, um, shall we… chase them away…?”
He opened his eyes.
Castiel’s no hero. What he is, as far as his peers are concerned, is a headache.
That inner pressure was peaking, a warning crackle of lightning ran up Dean’s spine - no no no not yet - they only had tonight - never wanted this to end- never wanted to lose Cas deep inside him like that-
There was a bitten off sound of pain, and Cas’s hands balled into fists. The bullet hadn’t moved a single hair’s breadth.
Dean was inspecting the lentils for stones. Then he washed some vegetables, cut some carrots up and dumped them in the pot of water starting to simmer on the stove. Some day old bread in the pantry was popped into the oven to make rusks. Dean moved easily, confidently around the kitchen. He obviously liked to cook, he was at ease here.
Castiel nods happily and returns to his radio, where he gets cornered by Charlie asking all sorts of questions sotto voce. The cheerful curious whispers contrast with the silence that has set over the father-and-son table.
In which Dean learns how very lucky he is, really.
“Yes,” said Castiel tersely, reaching out for Communion. “Show me what you need.”
“Don’t take any risks.”
“Just curious.”
Cas was looking away from the Machine, across the meadow where the deer had lifted its head and was staring over its shoulder.
“I’m sure. I remember how you used to run from the house and hide in the barn not that long ago.” Luke’s gaze drops to Ginny, trying to scratch at her bandage like she’s pursuing a flea.
“I see you had a successful hunt.” Castiel nods towards the other side of the stompin’ ground. Dean, being deputy, has a cabin right on the edge of the grounds, as does Victor on the other side. It’s a good place to live in order to keep a pulse on their pack, since the grounds is where shit like serious fights can go down, but the downside is that one side of it is the tanner’s yard. Garth and two other omegas, Matt and Elanore, are busy skinning, cutting and hanging the moose in the meathouse sunk three quarters underground to keep cool. The smell floating this way is not pleasant, but Dean’s used to it; hell, his nose pats him on the back with a ‘good job’ every time he catches a whiff.
Dean tore his gaze away from the empty space where a dame who had really been begging for a bullet had been a second before, and ran a few steps to catch up. He gave his husband’s profile a side glance. “Hope you’re sure about that.”
But since Cas isn’t in the country for awhile, maybe Sam can stick around (Dean’s okay doing both their shares of baby duty now that he’s here). Since one of them is caring for Rob and the other distracting Cas most of the time, the brothers haven’t had the time to hang out for what feels like forever. Yeah, Dean hopes Sam can stay. He misses the big moose...
So be it.
“To Mike? Nah. He don’t.”
Next weekend's chapter will come out on Sunday, or possibly skip a week as I'm away for awhile.
“It’s complicated, but I suppose you could say that he unhooked us from time for awhile.”
Cas, flat on his back against the blanket, briefly struggles against the way Dean’s holding him down - not by the wrists, don’t want to bruise, but one hand is curled around the back of Cas’s neck, catching him by the nape, a forearm rests across his chest and Dean’s body weight is spread out at the mathematically exact points that’ll stop legs from squirming free and giving leverage. Dean’s an old hand at this. He looks down at what he’s caught himself, and oh, it’s a glorious sight. Cas is all mussed up and heated and flushed, chest heaving beneath Dean’s hold, mouth cracked open, eyeteeth showing, blue eyes harder than diamonds without an ounce of retrenchment. Glaring up at him.
“But hon, if you let them run over you roughshod, they won’t listen to what you have to say later on when it’s something that matters.”
There was an unarticulated noise from Sam as his brother trailed after him, an unasked query about the uninvited guest they were leaving stranded in the bedroom. Dean ignored him, ignored the angel, and made his way downstairs. He detoured by Sam’s room. Dean could have used his own chamberpot, but the thought of whippin’ it out in front of those blue eyes would scar even someone who’d whacked off the heads of over a dozen Levis. He managed his morning business, then turned and clomped out of the room before the Machine even cleaned up behind him (unlike regular damage and mop-ups, chamberpots were cleaned immediately for reasons of sanity. San... San-something, some angel had told him once in a particularly fastidious tone of voice, but the word slipped his mind. Dean normally did as much as he could with his own two hands out of stubborn human pride, but having dealt with latrine digging out in the Wilds, he let that small convenience abide).
“Say, Cas, what’s a storm like?”
“Yessir.”
”...What, you expected me to still go to the meetings n’all? Get runners out of dodge? ‘Here, this way, don’t mind
They were at Donna’s today for another routine that revolved around her, the annual cleaning of her kitchen and bakery. Castiel, radiating confusion, managed not to point out that the Machine rewrote the place spotless every other day or so, and thus this annual ritual of giving the place a thorough spring cleaning by humans ‘to get it right’ was useless.
A distracted “Come in” answers Dean’s rap on the door; a cheerful, peppy rat-a-tat-tat, because Dean’s in a good mood again after dropping quickly back by his cabin to see if Cas wanted anything (and for a quick kiss and grope.)
...maybe he is getting the hang of it. At this stage. Of course, according to the book, there’s like a hundred of these fucking stages before they even begin to talk. Also, the book fails to mention the Mark of Cain, which means it is
Castiel was silent.
His angel was gone.
Jo went hmf, but handed him the glass of water and then told him to stop standing in the doorway like an idiot. Since she called Dean an idiot all the time, Castiel decided this was actually a positive development.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Colt sighed, rubbing the back of his neck, making the grizzled short hairs go scritch-scritch beneath callused fingers. “I’d give what’s left of my soul to never see that piece again. But I’m the one that created it. I ain’t happy havin’ it waltzing around creation, bringing more death about...”
“Heading south towards Harrisonville, last we heard, but we think she left the, uh, that big road the humans have, and might be taking the back roads.”
Another rocket peppered the sunlit sky ten blocks away, white and blue still. Fuck fuck fuck, Bobby, c’mon! Dean felt at his pockets, he still had a few blue rockets - ‘linchpin on the run’ was what those meant. Once spotted, a bunch of other operators, the small time ones safely in their locked homes right now, had started the very safe and decree-approved task of lighting rockets as distraction and to echo the message. The signals worked better at night, though, thank you mister ‘I decided to stop the sun’ for making things just a bit harder.
“No. I don’t think so. It’s faint because it’s old. I also smell ash.” Molecules danced through the air, carried by the breeze.
Michael opened his mouth-
Those words couldn't be more wrong...
“There’s only one thing it can’t kill, really.”
“What?”
They both look at the house contemplatively, they look at each other, then Dean crooks a smile. “Hey, I’d love the company, and you’ll see, the place I have in mind is real sweet. There’s a brook, and lotsa trees. It’s on private grounds, a free range orchard and dairy farm that belongs to a friend of mine. He’s gaga over all the critters so she’ll never get trapped.”
With a flourish of the stylus Eileen drew his attention to the next clump of text. Castiel’s eyes flitted over the words and then the paragraphs.
...Dean had taken baths back in Paradise 342, because of course the fact that the Machine kept every one of its human charges clean did not signify in the slightest. The last time that’d happened when Castiel had been around, about a week before the angel had been shot, Dean and Sam had hauled in the tin tub from the shed into the kitchen. They had boiled water on the stove, Dean had started to undo his buttons with a brusque gesture, given Castiel a pointed stare, that eventually transcended into a order to get the hell out of there.
Jo looked set to ask another question when the miracle occurred, as was mostly expected. Miracles had been a quasi daily occurrence since 1836.
Ginny goes right up to him again and snuffs him as if wondering who this new guy is and why he’s making her boss hesitate and look back rather than forward. Cas looks down with only a faint hint of discomfort and then nods to the dog’s master and departs while Dean hoofs it in the opposite direction.
Dean and Castiel splutter to a halt and turn.
I tweaked the triggers to the Apocalypse a little, though less than I’d initially planned to. This is where it’s a AU, not a what-if fic, though there are still similarities to SPN.
“No, you need one of these.” Panic fastidiously put down the ceramic bowl and fished something out from the side pocket of the Bandits duffel.
He registered that the pair of numbskulls were staring at something over his left shoulder just as a hand clapped him there and a gravelly voice said: “Dean.”
Balthazar yawned again (of course) then glanced around. The garrison was a humdrum square building dead center of Paradise 342. A central area of writing desks, chairs and tables for the peons like him, and three offices up a short flight of stairs for the big cheeses. Not a single decoration or plant or anything. It was an angel’s nest, all right, and at four on a Thursday afternoon of the paradisaical New Millennium, it had to be the most boring place on earth.
“You’re taking
Castiel didn’t know which was more depressing. The initial argument, the fact that Dean knew he’d gotten to him, or the obvious worry behind Sam’s words that implied he thought Castiel would
“Right.” Of course not. Still, that even a few angels could-
Thunk!
It’s long and deep to start with, a reacquaintance. Then it shifts, Dean’s hands move slowly dropping from Castiel’s face to his shoulders, then his waist, taking their time, fingers trailing meaningfully on the way, before slipping beneath his belt, feeling out for skin. Then they dart up like predators striking, to slip off his coat in one quick movement. It crumples to the floor, unheeded. Dean is already rucking up the back of Castiel’s shirt, searching for more contact.
“Bela,” Dean said warningly.
“Shh. You sure are noisy. Then again, who am I to talk, look who I work for...” Balthazar poked absently at his ear. Blood was trickling from it too. Dean was the only one in the lot who wasn’t injured, though he felt like he’d picked up a sunburn on his face.
“I live an hour away,” Michael says tartly, “I wish you’d given me a heads up.”
“Do we need to move?”
“Side effect of the process. Plus protects that person’s identity. You know how we operate, boy.”
In short, people couldn’t handle it. Plain and simple. Paradise, right? Should be great, in theory. Yet other than a few people who were already Loafers before it became a lifestyle choice, every human on the planet had had to work for everything before the big A, and it just seemed hardwired. Having one’s desires poof into existence was great for awhile, but then people started acting strange. Houses would end up full of useless things. People would start stress testing what they could imagine, what they could pray for, as if involuntarily seeking a way to break the system. Some would start strange competitions to best decorate overstuffed homes. Or would lie in bed all day conjuring food and water and bedpans and such and live like roaches in a nest of filth. Or would burn their homes to the ground and run away to live in an empty barn, and gibber when the Machine rebuilt their dwellings a day later... Not everyone was affected, or to the same degree, but even so, Paradise came dangerously close to tipping over the edge for awhile, and nobody could figure out why.
“Cas. What do you want to do?”
Dean woke with a start, heart hammering.
Sam’s eyes go slowly wide and horrified as they fix on Dean.
“Brother!” Castiel gasped, glancing horrified at Eileen, who still smiled politely, head tilted to one side as if she had a feeling they were discussing her and was vaguely wondering what they were saying
“But we need to have a sit down. You, him and Lafitte.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Castiel, he did not want us to know about his past. Didn’t you figure that out?” Sam finally said.
Dean knew, to the bottom of his being, that if they had had the long life together that they were meant to have, then every new and fascinating thing he’d find out about Cas would make its way into his heart and soul, and vice versa. Up to and including the spectacular fights they would still have, since they were both as stubborn and ornery as a couple of tom cats, soulmate stuff notwithstanding. But even those arguments would have gotten them closer once the dust settled, he was sure.
A weaker man would have buried himself in denial. A wiser man would have analyzed the situation carefully until he understood all the angles. A cautious man would have said nothing, kept his head down and done as he was told.
“Why?”
“Good- thing- the mine- is only-...two-days-away-” the last is shot out in a gasp. “Th-thanks- for- w-walk-...ing with-”
“He’s allergic to bugs.”
Wait. Was that something there? Hanging in mid air? It was at some distance, but now that he looked, his eye caught something. Like there was the tiniest of pinpricks in mid-air, but something so bright on the other side that even that tiny hole let through a faint shimmering glow. It was a hundred yards away give or take, yet somehow, some instinct suggested it was much, much further away. The way a star was far away. Even though it was right there in the meadow.
A “Great morning, innit?” rang out behind Dean, clear as a bell, sending shock shooting up his spine like a spike.
“Oh...my...god...Oh my god! Oh my
...maybe that’s why Cas is working in the Rancher area today, yesterday as well, even though he’d been slated to work in the Hunter compound for a few more weeks. Might be that’s for the best with Dean heading out of the camp for awhile. Cas must have done the smart thing, reported the incident to Cesar or Jesse Cuevas, his alphas, so they could take steps.
Castiel abruptly stops the car in the middle of the road.
“It is a cambion.”
“It’s a nice day.”
The peaceful sun-dappled forest gave way to a meadow. Halfway across, something changed. The grass was less verdant, the trees on the far edge were scraggy and full of dead twigs and branches, broken birds nests, windswept debris.
Dean’s breath leaves him in an embarrassing sort of whoosh. He hopes to god he’s not as red in the face as he feels.
Dean drew an arrow to that, leading to the note ‘1st amendment, bitch!’ in the margin, at which point Rowena’s elegant looped script took over at the top of the calendar with ‘Children! We need this for important dates!’ and the war tapered off for awhile, before picking up again in the ranks of post-it notes on the fridge.
“Just the winter sniffles.” Charlie is looking at Cas curiously, eyes twinkling in the beta-trader way of one who loves to make new friends. And she’s the opposite of snooty when it comes to the Hierarchy and bends. “You a buddy of Dean’s? Pleased to meet you!”
“Think, dude. Time is of the essence, Crowley has to do that spell soon.” Panic was contemplating hard, the whirring of the unused engine beneath his dirty long hair was going to set the latter on fire. “Our forces are in position, remember? They expect him to hobble the big kahuna today, any minute now.”
“Not now,” Castiel said firmly in response to whatever question had crossed the Ether. “You can debrief us all tomorrow. Sam and Dean are tired. I will not have them further harassed today, after all they’ve been through.”
“Suspicious? No,” Dean says airily. “Makes sense to me. You know what you do to prophets and psychics and guys like that. Having an angel around- it’d be like building a house of cards with Godzilla camping outside the door. Right?”
“I am not a chaplain.”
“Good. I’m so sorry about this, Mr Winchester.”
That hit close to the bone, though from the off-hand way he’d tossed that out, Dean did not know it. Did not know that this had almost been what the angels had opted for originally, until the God Machine, the Will made manifest of their Father, had insisted it should not be. But they hadn’t seen how Paradise on Earth
The question Dean brings back from St Louis is like a toothache. A sharp jab of pain to start with, startling in its unexpectedness, but you ignore it hard and it almost seems to go away for a time, or maybe you just get used to it and blindly hope that it won’t get worse while it slowly eats away at your core.
John started out as a hunter years ago, so he’s always kept hunter dogs rather than guard ones, and Mira’s been the family’s dog since she was a pup and Dean hit double digits. She knows him and doesn’t make a fuss when he looks over her brood of nine; only two days old, eyes still closed, features half-formed, belly buttons raw around twisted twig-like umbilicals, they look like large dormice, but that’ll change. They’re going to be a sturdy lot… except for one. An all-white bitch with a funny cream spot on her pink nose and ridiculously floppy paws that she can’t seem to coordinate to save her life. She’s noticeably smaller and skinnier than the others. She paws with those ludicrous overgrown mittens at the end of her legs, but her brothers and sisters pay her no heed and she can’t squirm in to the teat. Her movements slow, lethargic, but they still continue as if she’s not going to let the cold hand of death discourage her, no how no way.
“Don’t tell me.”
Telling Benny is a no-brainer, but Dean somehow managed to forget Andrea in all this, even though she lives in the same house.
“It makes it unkillable by anyone not armed with the Mark and the First Blade.”
“Thank you.”
There’s no describing Hell. You can’t. You say, ‘it’s terrible’, and that’s just a word that’s been applied to other things like car accidents and wars and badly burned pop-tarts.
“Strong words,” says someone off to his right.
Right?
Two brief battles later, the last of the suits clatters to the ground in a sound of tin cans shied by a coconut. They are all empty, just guards animated by magic. Dean contemptuously turns his back on piles of dented metal and faces the central shaft’s void for lack of any other focus.
He looks up to find Sam staring at him in a worried way.
Benny’s a beta hunter who strayed into Winchester’s camp almost eight years ago now. Unlike alphas and omegas, betas can stray for a long time. A pack may need all the hands it can get, but not if those hands might disrupt the fragile balance of a small community... and if there’s one word you can use to describe betas, ‘peaceful-like’ ain’t it. There’s quite a bit of shuffling around among betas. If they can’t fit into one pack - or if the pack don’t want them to kick up a fuss - they leave and try the next. Eventually they find their place, most of them do. They find
“It’s fine,” Castiel insists, but Dean stops dead in his tracks, turns and glares until Castiel has put pressure on the cut on his wrist and they’re fifty feet away from the rest of the troops behind a small copse.
Nothing strange at all, but today that reasoning he’s never really questioned before lies in his mind like a key in the palm of his hand, and he’s staring at it, wondering what door it’s made to unlock.
A sharp look melds into uncertainty. “For… for what I said. I didn’t mean it.”
… on the surface. Deep inside, the oddest thing, he feels a slow grinding emotion build, like anger and resentment towards this great Savior… who is himself! It’s nonsensical, but it’s gotten to the point Castiel dreams about it at night: the old Castiel - clothed in white robes and lights, Grace like a halo shining around his head, wings thrown out, divine being and all - alights in front of Dean and takes him away. Away where, why, for what purpose, Castiel has no idea, his dream imagination gets fuzzy on that point, but he’s left standing there in the dirt of mortality, futily shouting after the figure flying away with Dean in his arms, “Dean! It was me! I saved your life - you should be going away with me!”
“Benny, spread out! Look for more!” Dean barks as he slides from his saddle and draws his sword. Benny and the Hunters immediately disperse.
WARNING: EXTREMELY ABLEIST LANGUAGE AND CONCEPTS up ahead, which is inevitable if you want to write anything even remotely period-accurate. The treatment of the people with disabilities, particularly from birth, was dreadful back then. Take it as a testimony to our progress so far, even if we've got a lot left to do to achieve a truly inclusive society.
“In my old pack, we didn’t smoke meat.”
She’d turned her back now to the guard, the eavesdropper and everybody else that might come by, blindly rearranging silverware on the sideboard as if to get their alignment exactly right. “Is Lord Robert handling the questioners?”
“Uh…” It seems Swan Prince has some kind of message he’s trying to impart, yet something in Dean’s attitude is throwing him off. “Prince Dean, you may not know this but… shortly after you arrived in this region, I came upon you being celebrated in one of the nearby villages. I returned night after night to watch you in secret as you made your way in and around this forest.”
The brothers stare at each other. Then they stare at him.
“Wow, dick move, dog,” Dean mutters.
“...I need your help.”
That earned him a faint and unruffled smile. Uriel was looking forward to breaking him.
“Bobby!” Dean yells in horror.
“You have a
Ginny is as dumb as a bag of hammers, truth be told, and took twice as much effort to train from day one, but Dean applied himself, and once Ginny learns something, that thing is
The two old omegas turn and wait for Dean to catch up at a jog. He’s going to walk them to their common destination because these two old cusses are very good friends of his, not because he thinks they need a beta to escort them. The idea never occurred to him before.
“So much for the patience of angels. Fine. In 1835, I got very drunk, and-“
Up ahead, the thin figure - could be a woman or a young man, hair long and ragged like a beast’s - froze at the sight of them. And then started making that sound, the scream of a jaguar scenting blood.
“Really?” Lucifer finally deigns to address him.
“Oh. Uh, good. I’m not at the bunker, but Sam should be there.”
Castiel looked at him, not knowing what more Dean wanted to hear.
Colt reached idly into his jacket’s hidden holster. The Colt’s hilt felt cold. “Where is this little toe-rag?”
“Then the sun rose, and the cursed swan took over my mind again. I never saw her die. By the time I returned to myself the next night, she had disappeared, the body disposed of, her murderer gone. The sorcerer came back a year later as if nothing had happened. When I threw accusations at him, he showed not a hint of remorse. He simply told me to stop trying to get help if I didn’t want more people to get hurt, and to accept my situation. You see how dangerous he is?”
Cas gave him a searching look. “You don’t seem to believe this is possible.”
But that’s not the thing that has Dean paralyzed, sword stuck at an angle pointing sideways like a numpty.
Castiel whips his head around and blinks in dismay at the van’s radio clock. “Oh, I’m sorry! You came- it’s so late, you probably wanted to go home for your own dinner soon!”
Dean wondered why he was dressed like that: a city slicker suit, cravat and all, under a caballero duster. Weird mix. Like an scrivener who’d picked up a herder’s outerwear by mistake. Was that what the poor sap, Novak, had been wearing when the angel chased him out of his meatsuit? That... was ten kinds of creepy. Dean didn’t ask, though. Other than that frank discussion their first morning, he and Cas had not really brought up any loaded topics. Dean didn’t like this feeling he was skirting a whole bunch of difficult subjects, he was a naturally combative get-to-grips kind of guy, but this whole situation just felt too... new, too strange.
“Yeah. She died because all her life she wanted to be a mom. The Machine said, hey, guess what, you’re not one of the lucky few chosen to have children, and there’s no appeal. Tough! And then my mom-.... my mom who had already had Dean and who was-... You’re right, I never knew Karen, and Dean was too young to remember her, but I know her through Bobby and Ellen and others, and she would have made a great mom. And instead, who gets in the family way for a second time, when hardly anyone has more than one kid anymore? Her best friend, Mary Campbell, a Hunter on active duty who probably didn’t even want a second child at all. How does that make sense to you…? Bobby tells me mom tried to help. She got Karen to watch Dean for her, she hoped Karen would- would get to be our second mom. Instead, Karen brought Dean back one day, gave my eight-month old pregnant mom a hug, and went home, and you know what happened next.”
“... What?”
“Right,” Dean snorts, watching his fingers trail deliciously along the lines of Castiel’s open collar. “Just when, between all the death and disaster and- and getting conned by bloody Gadreel into kicking you out, would I have worked that into the conversation? Huh?”
The lone surviving demon gulps.
“Oh. Oh, I see. I’m sorry, there’s not much I can do about that at present.”
“Uh, Jonah a couple years ago, after he got here. Also Afiel, the guy who was here before Zach - he told my dad to quit it. Long time now, before I was born.”
“You… you can’t do that,” Dean finally said, aghast.
“Dean!” Sam croaks, eyes wide, grabbing his brother’s shoulder and shaking.
“You go take a nap,” Charlie says pugnaciously, even as she gets slowly to her feet. “I know you’re tough, Winchester, but having your baby scream in the middle of the night is stressful for a daddy, so don’t pretend you weren’t tottering out of here when Sam shooed you away on Sunday.”
“Yeah, he can wait a hell of a long time for that,” Dean said, and went towards the trapdoor to instigate the rest of the afternoon’s fun and games.
“Dousing. Shh.”
That earned him a frown of incomprehension that then cleared. “You mean they’re not railroad operators.”
Yet it was Castiel who started the fight.
“Yeah, should have know that wasn’t Cas’s choice of ornaments.” Dean, grinning widely, examined the music hall poster that had been pinned to the wall. From the confused way Cas was looking at it, and from Balthazar’s quirky smile, Dean was ready to bet that poster had been up a few days already, and Cas had failed to notice.
Dean’s scowl deepens, but for answer, he takes the large blanket-wrapped bird from under his arm and thrusts it in his brother’s direction. “Here, fix it.”
“Yes alpha.”
“That is why you need to find it now. Before it gets that strong.”
Fortunately Tom wasn’t one of those who thought an advocate was little better than a collaborator. He merely nodded in understanding. “I see, plausible-”
“I’ll find him, tell him to go home as quickly as he can. If that’s alright with you? Would you prefer to be with Bobby and Ellen?” Cas asked him as if Dean was the guy who needed to be cosseted right now.
“You gonna live, Red?”
Dean perks up even more.
“Dean asked me to pass along his orders, actually.”
“So if you’re not a demon, you should be all behind their efforts.”
could be used when talking about Castiel was if one added “not at all, really,” or “strewth, quite the reverse,” immediately afterwards. Dull, dutiful and devoid of humor, prince consort Castiel could accidentally kill romance just by glancing in its direction.
Dean glanced up. There was a fluffy cloud overhead. He glared at it suspiciously.
“Okay.” Dean, kneeling at Castiel’s side, sounded like a human who was going to be very dubious about anything anyone was going to tell him in the next few minutes. “I have to tell you the truth, Cas, part of me never really bought the whole ‘God is a Machine’ deal. You know? Not for real. And now I gotta believe God is a Machine who is a dude named Chuck?” It was phrased as a question, but even to the semi-stunned angel, it sounded more like a whole lot of doubt. This doubt started where Thomas the Apostle had left off and just kept on going.
Dean stopped talking and actually measured the severe look and the hard words.
Dean sat himself down on the edge of the bed and looked around. This wasn’t a perfect copy of his room. Not only was he missing a window, he was missing that whole section, as the walls here angled differently. Which meant that Cas hadn’t created the couch near the window either, there wasn’t really any space for it.
… That was unnecessary. The Host did not need to implicitly make Sam and Dean’s safety the warranty on his behavior. But by the time his feet touch down on earth again, the anger boiling deep in Castiel’s being has cooled to resignation. He has much to make up for these past few years. Like two sides of a coin, his redemption in the eyes of his family and keeping his friends safe both depend on his obedience, so obey he will.
Kansas City will be his first stop. It’s early morning still, odds are good that she slept there last night, most likely in a discreet motel near the highway. If not, then from the way the car is burning, it has been fueled recently, and he’s noted the licence plate. Stations in these parts all have surveillance cameras and Castiel has a badge, courtesy of the Winchesters and a Kinko’s. He should be able to backtrack her that way. Find out how she paid for gas, or under what name she booked a room for herself and her daughter.
With a bare motion of his eyes, Sam directs Dean’s attention to the slice of moon that has just appeared in the twilight sky. “No, that’s why he changed back. I’m sorry, your highness, the curse is still set on you, I could feel it operate the transformation. My efforts had no effect.”
But then again, the interrogator could be deft enough to find evidence in Sam’s mind to compromise Dean and Bobby and the others. Sam couldn’t risk calling in an interrogator any more than Uriel could. So they were going to do this dance until Sam caved or until outside circumstances intervened.
A huge puff of oily black smoke ballooned out from the fire and then the whole thing exploded, sending Panic falling over backwards into the dirt.
“If there even is a cambion around.” What would be the point of creating the next great leader of Lucifer’s armies when Lucifer is off the board, his generals dead, his armies beaten back and under the control of an overblown salesman?
“Do you remember what you refer to as my rampage? When I stole all the souls from purgatory?”
“You... did you do this? Is it safe for you to- to-“
“Here in Paradise? I should be so lucky.” Bobby snorted. “Your brother came over this morning.”
“Just get out, Michael, and we’ll let the diplomats sort it out on the back end. We’ll avoid court visits from now on and you will never address me or my family in private ever again. The door is that way.”
“Relax. That’s my brother. He must have wanted a word with me. Bobby let him understand it was not a good time. Sam’s not a part of the station.” And because he just hated the look he got from out-of-town operators when he said that - the look that suggested Sam’s avoidance of underground railroad activity was due to lack of loyalty or lack of courage, when Sam lacked neither by any means and Dean was prouder of him than he could ever say, he added: “He’s an advocate. He’s gotta stay out of all this.”
“Right.” Dean doesn't know how Cas can dismiss that with a ‘just a list’, he’d never have thought of that.
“Bobby, you sure?” Dean muttered. Then he shook his head and said loudly, “Nothing against you particularly, Balthazar, I appreciate your help the other day, but it’s one hell of a political statement, right? Cas is one thing, but you... “
Dean brought the ax down with a vicious whack, splitting the log in half.
“We need to hurry,” Pudding blurted out. “C’mon, get his blood!”
“Wait-” Cas shakes off exhaustion and staggers to his feet as Dean moves away, catching his sleeve anxiously. “You’re not leaving right now, are you?”
Someone near the portcullis outside calls out incoherently, sharp and shrill before cutting off in an ugly choking gurgle.
Cas stored the two snoozing humans back behind their rampart of boxes, out of harm’s way.
Damn, Dean’s got it bad...
Cas paused in the act of once more pushing himself up onto his elbows. “But if somebody needs to not sleep in a bed-“
“It takes a great amount of power to conceive a Cambion,” Castiel reminds her. “Azazel was involved last time, but he’s dead. Nobody has heard of any of the other princes for millennia. Crowley doesn’t have this amount of power. Who else could be involved?”
“Say what now?” Dean said, staring at Rufus. They all were.
There’s no reason to, of course.
This, tending the Winchester’s designated plot and helping out the neighbors with their own, was going to become something of a daily habit. One more little piece of make-do work that would stop Dean going out of his mind, and also put something tasty on the table for the two of the house’s inhabitants that did like to eat.
Dean blinked and looked up abruptly. “What? No- where did you get that from?”
Dean stared. “You did not-” he started to say and discovered his voice was now a tenth the volume and also helium squeaky (Castiel was not normally a petty entity, but he was having a bad day.)
“You got more to say to this dude?”
“Then they’ll kill me.”
With a huff, Dean scooped up the bedding he’d dropped and packed it away in the large cedar chest. The machine would rewrite it clean in a few days. Which was good; washing sheets was a day-long arduous task that even the most desperately bored human would dodge if they could. Dean took out his other set of sheets the Machine had cleaned days ago, and spread them out on the bed.
Dean switches from ‘Thunderstruck’ to ‘Who Do You Love’. The toothbrush makes it even more metal.
“He... unhooked us...”
It’s been four days, and at times it feels like it’s been weeks, and other times the sheer switchback his life just took hits him like a laundry paddle upside the head.
“Right. Uh...” Dean scratched his head. “Cas, you play checkers?”
Going through the Hunter compound gates would be a waste of time, Dean runs straight through the western part, dodging through the stables to save a few seconds, and then shows Cas where you can squeeze through a gap in their fence (it’s the fence between compounds, Dean doesn’t even know why they have it half the time since they don’t expect an attack from the Makers or the Ranchers, it’s not well-maintained but it’s, well, it’s there, a symbol or some such.)
“Yes.”
