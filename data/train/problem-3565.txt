Unfortunately, the homemade antenna wasn’t remotely subtle; it was three feet long, about as wide, and wouldn’t come close to fitting in Dean’s pack. He probably could have gotten away with making up something that would have satisfied Sam’s questions (bringing Charlie into that web of lies was out of the question; her “poker face” had bought many a round of bad whiskey for the other card players at Last Call before she’d moved on to darts), but the radio handlers would definitely have demanded better explanations if he’d suddenly stopped running and started waving a contraption of wires and pipes around over his head.
Major Novak looked as though she was wishing for a weapon in her hand. "I did, yes. And he was killed, just as Castiel was. You are on very thin ice right now."
“What the hell is this, anyway? Now you’re not even going to stick around to gloat? Make fun of the poor stupid human? C’mon!”
“Yeah, I could see that.” Dean laughed, a little shyly, glancing up at him from under thick lashes. Again, Castiel fought to remind himself that
“Yeah, I’ll pass,” Dean said, recapping the container and setting it aside for later, when it was time to change the bandages. Castiel turned back toward the work he’d been doing before Dean arrived, mudding and taping the seams in the drywall to make it a smooth surface. It looked as though he was fairly focused on the job, and had Dean had his own task to accomplish, the silence between them might have been a comfortable one. Since Dean was, instead, basically left to stew in his own anxiety, there was no stopping himself when his mouth decided to open of its own accord.
“Just those couple of little places, though, right?” Dean said. He wanted to be irritated that the electrical work—the part he’d been most looking forward to seeing—was being done in his absence, but he brushed it aside for now. “Cas said it wasn’t a major repair job. There’s nothing else we missed? No reason I should be worrying?”
“Stupid things don’t get tired,” Dean growled. “We could try sitting here and picking ‘em off at a distance, but ammunition will be a problem. They’d have to get closer before we could shoot accurately, and they’d be too close.” He was pale and tense, sawing the reins between his hands as he watched over his shoulder.
Listening as hard as he could, he waited until he thought both sets of footsteps were coming from the rear of the bunker, as far from the door as they were likely to get. He quickly but carefully crept to the doorway of the room, holding his breath anxiously. There was no time to consider taking anything with him, but he’d almost certainly die quickly if he was forced to leave here empty-handed. Casting his eyes around the room desperately, he almost cried in relief when he saw the revolver he’d left sitting on top of the squat cabinet. It was even loaded, and it would be far better than nothing, at least until he could find somewhere else to hide.
Dean frowned. “‘Kay, fine, whatever, but then turn down the music. It’s loud enough I can hear it on my end, and it’s not much better if the Runners are the ones being distracted.”
Sam had always gotten offended when Dean dipped his spoon into the Nutella jar, like it was the height of savagery.
“Yeah, I can just see you in one of those big, goofy white suits with the mesh face thing,” Dean said with a smirk. “Probably selling jars of honey at some farmers’ market on the weekends, chatting up all the grannies who come by to pinch your cheeks.”
Castiel stopped walking, turning to face Dean fully. “Well,” he said, “I’ve been working in the archives here for years, mostly doing cataloguing and digitization. The one and only time I willingly take on a project that involves an outside research project…” He looked Dean up and down, smile spreading slowly. “Fate or no Fate, I’m definitely feeling a bit compelled.”
“I’ve got a heavy lug wrench in my trunk,” Dean offered. Castiel arched an eyebrow at him, and damned if those tamped-down butterflies didn’t come swarming right back, now with friends. “I’m serious,” he said. “I’m going to be tearing that out, anyway, so what do I care if you want to punch a hole in it now?”
“Nah, I’m not hungry. Just curious.” Castiel gave him a look that said he was behaving strangely again, but he didn’t ask for clarification before going back to work demolishing the wall around the plumbing. The noise was rather incredible, echoing around the tiny room and making the entire upper floor vibrate every now and again, and Dean left him to it, more than occupied in the bedroom across the hall, where he was theoretically engaged in ripping up more carpet.
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean tilted his glass into his mouth, downing the last of his drink. “I hear you. Almost done, though. So close, I can almost taste it.”
“Dean,” Castiel cut in, looking up at him in exasperation. “I was recording.” He unfolded his long legs from their pretzeled position, kneeling up so that he could tap at the screen of the tablet facing him, pausing the recording.
Hopefully with enough subtlety to be overlooked, Castiel elbowed Dean in the side. “How about ‘The Wheels on the Bus’?” he said, smiling in slight challenge. Dean ducked his head and strummed a couple of chords, and they began.
Dean’s eyes lit with a sudden recollection. “Oh, hey, thought you might want to know—your horse finally stopped right inside the camp gates. Guess she felt like she was back in her pen or something, and she calmed right down. Hope you weren’t getting too attached, because I think I heard Jody talking baby-talk to her when I went by to pick up your bag.”
“Right. But first things first, we need to track down the initial signal. Now, I know I don’t actually have a directional antenna, let alone a portable one. Hmmm.” She pushed onto her knees and crawled to a large trunk in the corner. When she lifted the lid, Dean was surprised the thing didn’t erupt in a shower of bolts and random pieces of metal, as packed as it was. “I might be able to knock together something that will do the trick, but I’ll need some more coax cable, around fifty ohm?”
“It’s the same principle,” Sam said calmly. He turned to watch the horses some more, practically making heart eyes at them. Any one of them would probably be capable of biting his hand clean off his wrist, but he looked like he was already considering putting their manes into little braids. “I saw a bunch of saddles and things in the barn. They were obviously used to being ridden.”
RECOMMENDATION: While the recovery of Project Lambs Blood test subject files is an achievement that may lead to great gains in our current war, it is imperative that Lt. Gen. Benton be found, either living or proved otherwise. Whether or not his actions were intentionally damaging, he should be considered unreliable and potentially treasonous. For the sake of national security, locating and securing Benton should be considered a priority.
Castiel shrugged impassively, wiggling his fingers in the slow current. “It does. But, then, there’s always the possibility that all of this could be real, except that I’m alone out here, imagining you and Sam are accompanying me.” Dean tried to argue, but Castiel wouldn’t let him interrupt. “I’ve been talking to you for months, you realize. It’s ridiculous to think that the man whose picture I’ve held, whose clothes I’ve been wearing, and whose bed I’ve been sleeping in—that that very man would somehow show up out of nowhere, just as I was losing hope in everything.”
“Mister Singer informed me of the incident in the field already.” Naomi turned aside, heading back into her office and seating herself behind a desk towering with papers. Dean followed her in, pushing his luck and hoping it wouldn’t backfire. The major’s expression could have been carved of marble for all he could read into it. “An odd encounter, but we deal with oddness every day. From what I heard, your experience hardly could be considered proof of anything, much less of a circumstance that would justify risking lives to explore.”
“What are we going to do?” One of the things about Sam that Dean had always appreciated was that, confronted with logic and reasoning, he was always willing to admit he was wrong and move on, rather than argue on out of pride. Dean didn’t miss that “you” had become “we” without even a moment of hesitation.
“Well, I think it might also have had something to do with their adorable little alarm clock,” Dean said, tilting his head toward the flap. Outside, they could hear the high-pitched voice of a little girl loudly demanding more bacon. “She really doesn’t have an off button, does she?”
Waving a hand and shaking his head at Castiel in an attempt to forestall any hysterical reactions to Benny’s unfortunately phrased question, Dean sorted through his words carefully. Any attempt to try to explain the whole dream mess to a third party was just way too much to consider at the moment. “He’s just going through something right now. It’s sort of bad timing, though.”
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know. Grandpa used to sing that one, I think. I forgot until I saw it on the list of songs you made.”
Naomi reached for the doorknob; the smell of smoke filled Castiel’s lungs when she pulled the door open and surveyed the scene. Up and down the block, people were panicking, plainly ignoring the mandate to stay indoors, as they rushed to throw things into cars and escape. To where, he had no idea, and he wasn’t convinced planning was playing much of a part in this madness. Children were shrieking, horns were blaring from the direction of the highway, and the dogs were going fucking insane.
Castiel’s wry look spoke volumes. He turned to rummage through his bag for a shirt and a pair of jeans. “Feels warm already,” he said over his shoulder. “At least it shouldn’t be too hot, going this early. It’ll be buggy, though.”
“I’m afraid I forgot my leather biting strap, so you’ll just have to squeeze my arm if it’s too bad.” Castiel adjusted the temperature to something less frigid and started rinsing away the blood and the drywall dust covering Dean’s skin. It stung like a bitch, and even if Dean had wanted to appear stoic and manly, he couldn’t help the way the fingers of his other hand convulsed around Castiel’s forearm. Luckily, Castiel didn’t seem to mind too much.
He wondered whether John Lennon was a poor choice for his current state of mind. He balanced on one foot, and the pose felt like an echo of the struggle for balance in his brain. A slip, an unexpected sound to startle the nerves, and down he might fall—down, down, into a bottomless abyss.
“Oh, wow, this could be nice,” Gabriel said when he was standing in the front room, gazing around speculatively. “The walls need to be replastered and painted something other than baby-shit green, and that chair rail is a crime against good taste. Is that even real wood? Of course, the carpet would probably have been better used for rolling up and hiding a body than laying on a floor, even when it was new. But otherwise, yeah, nice.”
Castiel was lying face-down on his mattress, the same position into which he’d flopped the moment he’d returned to the dormitory, when his door opened. “I’ve been paroled,” Dean’s cheerful baritone voice announced. “Don’t tell anybody, or they’ll pull me back. Managed to multitask a couple of projects into one, so I could finish before sunset for a change. Hey, what’s wrong?” He finally took in Castiel’s defeated slump, and he made his way to the bed, kicking off his sneakers as he walked.
Dean thought, locking eyes with Castiel. He hadn’t the foggiest idea how to handle this, and he was still racking his brain for one when Eileen burst into laughter. “You guys,” she said, giggling. “Sam, I can’t believe you still thought that was true.”
going to do—there’s a big leap between deciding that the guy is alive and concluding that he’s living in
Thirsty. He was thirstier than he’d ever been in his entire life, with the heat inside him drying the inside of his mouth until it felt rougher than sandpaper. He was burning up, his skin too tight and sore; moments (or maybe hours) later, he was shivering so badly that his teeth chattered. The water in the stream had soaked the legs of his jeans, and the cold, wet material was torture as he shook and trembled.
Now, if Dean had wanted to be truly honest, this would have been a good time to mention that he was at least moderately acquainted with small power tools. Dad had kept a tiny workshop in the garage when Dean and Sam were boys, and, okay, there might not have been a whole lot of major home repairing going on, but he’d built a handful of birdhouses, some simple shelves, and even a passable chair. Cutting a short, straight line under close supervision was nothing.
“Fair,” Castiel had agreed good-naturedly. “I haven’t been back home to Kansas in more than a decade, though. Maybe I can’t resist helping you because I’m desperately homesick? Your own voice is bringing back all sorts of pleasant memories for me.”
An hour later, wiping rancid blood and gore from the blade of his machete with the hem of the tattered dress that one of them had been wearing, Dean made a face at his brother. “Had to go and jinx us, didn’t you? With your ‘if we can keep this pace’ bullshit. Practically begging for something to go wrong.”
Abruptly, Sam had stepped backward, releasing Dean from his hold. "You've lost your mind," he had said. "Overheating, or…or exhaustion, or maybe PTSD finally kicking in, but I think you need to just sit down for a minute. I'll go get the doctor, and—"
“That might be a different situation, but so would having the equipment they had at Hopkins or Argonne or MIT. All equally useless to us now. I don’t know if you were aware of this, but it makes a whole lot more sense after this conversation. All the largest outbreaks at the very beginning were centered around military bases. It spread quickly, and they weren’t the only hotbeds, but they remain the worst areas even now. There could be a certified letter confessing the cause, the process, and the fix for the outbreak sitting on Doctor Benton’s desk, but trying to get anything out of Fort Leavenworth would be a nightmare.”
“As opposed to about an hour in the choppers,” Castiel reminded him. They’d been going round and round about this ever since the final travel arrangements had been settled, leading to the revelation that, despite being some sort of real-life action hero, Dean was absolutely petrified of flying.
the guy was saying. It was apparently a melancholy day for him; his voice was rougher, as though he hadn’t slept.
“Don’t be ridiculous. That was part of my thesis defense.” Dean elbowed him in the side, and he chuckled. “But I actually got distracted. The biggest point I could make is that I’m the only one here, other than Naomi, who’s actually been in Benton’s office before. I can get us in there without getting lost, and I know where his files are likely to be. Face it, you need me.”
Dean fidgeted, tapping at the cabinet with his fingers. “Haven’t decided. What do you think I should do?” He’d played out both scenarios in his head, trying to guess Sam’s reactions to either discussion, and neither sounded particularly pleasant. At least Minsky’s was usually loud enough to drown out the worst of any shouting.
Just at that moment, Castiel came back through the door, reading from the paperwork on his clipboard as he walked. “So it looks like we’ve actually got a pretty full work schedule over the next month, but we can probably put together a skeleton crew of workers to handle it. Most of the work won’t really be heavy lifting, depending on how much of the wall we need to replace, so a handful of people should be able to manage it. Gabe was moved to tears over the breaker box weirdness, so I think that wound up working in your favor, as far as booking speed.” He bent over the counter, scribbling more on the page without so much as glancing up.
“Well, we’ve been a little too busy working on this place to hit a whole lot of movies or white tablecloth restaurants.” Clearing the empty bottles to the recycling bin gave Dean an excuse to turn away so that he didn’t have to worry what his face was revealing. His brain was working overtime, considering. He definitely didn’t want to let the amount of time he spent with Cas suffer, just because the house was finished.
At first, Claire seemed to be the only person unbothered by either heat or bugs. She was covering twice as much distance as the rest of them, dashing from side to side of the trail to investigate various flowers or interesting rocks. Dean felt exhausted just watching her; he sent up a silent prayer that if and when he and Castiel ever decided to have pups of their own, they’d be a little less intense, at least some of the time. Maybe he needed to step up his running routine, just in case, because nobody else in the group appeared to be struggling as much as he was.
Blinking, and not really having any response to offer, Dean headed downstairs. The image of Castiel propping his head tiredly on a bent arm along the edge of the tub, with his flexed muscles straining the sleeve of his tee shirt just a bit, was definitely something he needed to clear from his mind before he returned, or squatting to hack at the drywall wasn’t even going to be an option for him.
Dean shook his head, smirking without humor, and Sam ran his palm over his face. They both knew that the main entrance to that bunker, like all the other shelters, would be almost impossible to force their way through. It was heavy, fortified, and there was almost no chance that the guy inside wouldn’t have thrown the triple set of deadbolts that backed up the combination lock system.
a living guy, but he’s in Guam or something,” Charlie said, tilting her head thoughtfully. “But I think I can at least help with ruling that out. Now, you said you tried to communicate back on his frequency?”
“As I was saying. He’s not good enough for you. Then again, pickings have gotten quite slim as of late. Tom Hiddleston is probably off the market for good, along with most of London.” She’d chuckled, her bluff falling apart at his look of incredulity. “Oh, just be happy, Castiel. I think, or I hope, we’ve all earned a little of that.”
“Yes, a clowder. A group of cats is called a clowder, though that’s hardly the point,” Castiel said, rolling his eyes. Dean thought it rather was at least
Dean had no idea how much time had elapsed since the most amazing moment of his entire life had shattered into the absolute worst. Had it been an hour? A week? Time in the Empty passed strangely, as Castiel had described from his own experience, and Dean’s mind was still reeling, struggling and failing to process how the events leading to his current situation could have gone so wrong. It hadn’t mattered how many potential pitfalls, fatal counterstrikes, and apocalyptic consequences that he, Sam, and the rest of the gang had considered from every angle and tried their best to anticipate before taking action; the unimaginable, when it came, had struck completely out of the blue, stunning them all. There was simply no way Dean could have seen it coming.
Without hesitation, Castiel pushed himself upright and strode toward the sound, falling into an identical march of his own. Naomi, reaching for the doorknob, paused in place as her eyes fell on him. To her credit, she didn’t even seem surprised. “Castiel,” she said; only the slightest shake in her voice over the last syllable betrayed any uncertainty.
“All the same,” Sam went on, “a dog would have been a lot cheaper than a house, if you were looking for company. Ow!” There were sudden noises indicating a brief scuffle, to the sound of Sam protesting mildly and with laughter.
The sun was below the hills to the west, though it wasn’t quite fully dark, as he walked. Once, maybe, a settlement this size would have been full of noise: the sound of car engines, the hum of air conditioners and other small machinery, dozens of conversations forming a patchwork buzz of living. There was sound around Dean now, but it was different. The low hum of the wind turbines was hardly noticeable anymore, part of the regular soundtrack of camp. There were soft clucks and bleating coming from the makeshift barnyard on the north side—far enough from the perimeter to deter predators, but distant enough from the main living areas to avoid complaints about the smell. A group of young people sat in the middle of the quad, several of them tapping rhythmic patterns on the benches with sticks as the rest bobbed their heads and danced. Dean nodded and waved when a few called out a greeting as he passed.
“Maybe this time it’ll be drugs,” Dean joked, trying to angle himself around Castiel so he could get his own glimpse. “I thought you were joking about you guys finding weird things hidden in houses.”
No, either Dean would have to insist on going back to the other person’s place, which he’d always found sort of awkward, or else find a cheap motel, which sounded even more depressing when he considered it. He immediately disregarded any notions of backseat or bathroom quickies, options he hadn’t explored since his early twenties and hadn’t really enjoyed even then.
Maintaining the authoritative voice as best he could manage, despite his urge to just go lift the poor guy in his arms and carry him out of this god-damned place, Dean went on. “Okay, so here’s the thing. You think I’m just a figment of your imagination, or maybe that I’m one of Lucifer’s fun little party tricks. But I’m not, and it is important that you come to terms with that, right now. Do you hear me?”
Sam was quiet for a moment. “That would be really good for you,” he finally said. “I’d like to see you have that. When’s the last time you even went out to any kind of party, let alone hosted one?” That was a rhetorical question, not a real one; Dean’s lack of an immediate comeback only confirmed the sad reality of it all.
“It’s fine, Cas,” Dean said, pulling away more roughly than he really meant to. He couldn’t handle the gentleness, not now. Not when he was struggling to build back up the protective walls that he should never have let crumble in the first place. Those blue eyes, wide with surprise and hurt, hovered at the edge of Dean’s line of sight, but he couldn’t even bring himself to meet them.
Mostly, though, it was measure, mark, cut, and tack, over and over. For the larger sheets, a couple of other builders had helped them lift and hold the drywall in position while Castiel used a screw gun to fix them in place. The majority of the labor involved more manageable pieces, though, and so Dean and Castiel had settled into a groove that worked for them. Dean cut the drywall sheets to the correct shapes and held them up while Castiel manned the gun, and then while Castiel marked and made cutouts for any outlets or switches, Dean moved on to start on the next sheet.
“So we can just…” With his hands, Dean gestured vaguely from the bones toward the window, trying to indicate the swift disposal of the whole mess. Castiel looked confused and a little horrified, so apparently the pantomime was less than successful. “Get rid of it?” he clarified, and Castiel’s face relaxed.
She bent slightly, from where she stood behind her desk, and yanked a drawer open. From inside, she pulled a notebook, which she slammed onto the table. Snapping open the front cover, she rammed her finger down onto the photo attached to the first page, one of a smiling young man. "My brother," she spat. "He was only twenty-three, and the last thing I said to him before the screaming started was a question about when he was going to grow up and face life. Not a day has passed since then that I haven't regretted that." She turned page after page, each covered with photos that Dean realized had probably all been printed from her pre-Crisis cell phone, now useless. There were family photos, birthdays, graduations. The corners of the pages were extremely worn.
Castiel, who had been engaged in sucking at the bite mark he’d made and turning it into what would probably be a huge mouth-shaped bruise, pulled back to give Dean a look of withering scorn. “Are you seriously accusing me of being too subtle about that? When we traded our worst sex stories—which, by the way and in case you were unaware, is a pretty damn intimate thing to share with a ‘friend’—I told you mine was with a man named Uriel.”
“It’s a dream,” Dean said. “Because you’re in the Empty. But I swear,” he added when he saw Castiel’s eyes narrow in consternation, “I’m going to make it right. I’m going to get you out of here, and I’m going to make up for this, and for everything else, starting just as soon as we get back. I’ll make it up to you somehow, if you can just wake up. Please, Cas. I need you.”
into it just to get it to stop itching—they all came together to have him flushing hot and cold, slightly dizzy with it. “Why don’t you just go take a look at the treetops or whatever, and I’ll see you when you get back.” Part of his brain was mortified by the sudden realization that Jimmy and Amelia were bearing witness to his tirade; a glance to the side showed that they were both wearing looks of extreme discomfort. He closed his eyes and tried to calm his racing pulse.
“I suppose,” she sighed. “But in the meantime, I’m going cross-eyed from staring at the screen. Hell, my eyes are so blurry right now that I almost couldn’t see the massive hickey on your neck, there, Professor.” She pointedly bit into another piece of chocolate as she levelled a flat look at him.
“See you guys soon,” Jody whispered, squeezing Dean’s shoulder as they headed for the stairwell door. Dean lifted a hand to wave, praying she was right.
“Yee-ouch,” Dean said, chuckling sympathetically. He tried not to freak out prematurely that the first story Castiel had offered had involved dating a woman. He was bisexual himself, for fuck’s sake; he knew better. “I mean, there’s lying and then there’s lying. That one’s pretty far past choosing not to be strictly accurate about your weight or whatever on your driver’s license, or even your Grindr profile.”
Castiel scoffed, turning his head to look away. “Please don’t tell me I shouldn’t feel guilt over this. I’ve replayed that night so many times in my head, wishing I could have done it differently.”
“Not everyone needs a dog,” Dean heard Eileen voicing out loud, since her hands were apparently more occupied with swatting at Sam than signing. “To Dog or Not To Dog” was a long-standing debate between the couple, and while neither of them was yielding ground yet, Dean would place money on Sam’s puppy-dog eyes eventually winning out. “Tell Dean if he’s bored, he can come help out at the senior center.”
“You’re probably right. Accelerated or not, the guy’s transcript definitely read ‘procrastinating,’ not ‘enthusiastic.’” Charlie bent over her work, and the two of them were quiet for a few moments. Dean wondered if she was dropping the subject, like he should. Then she broke the silence with a satisfied huff, switching tools. “But you want to find out for sure whether there’s somebody out there who really needs help, right?” she said over her shoulder, not looking at his face and therefore missing anything incriminating that might have been showing. “Obviously, or else you wouldn’t have come to my Fortress of Solitude. You’d have waited to spill it all over dinner or something, so I wouldn’t enlist you as my handmaiden. I know the way you work, Winchester.”
Dean sighed and shifted his upper body as well as he could so he could face her more directly. “You didn’t shove a spider into my tent,” he said. “There are bugs in the woods. Not like you needed to tell me so. If anything, I’m the dumba—uh, dumb
“Don’t spoil the ending,” Castiel said. It could have been a joke, but there wasn’t much humor in his eyes. Dean wouldn’t have expected there to be, not after recounting the worst night of his life like that. Joking about painful things might serve as a time-honored coping mechanism, but it was never actually funny. “Obviously, I didn’t die. And I didn’t turn, either, which I only realized was strange a few days after that. Remember, we were all still operating under the assumption that it was terrorists, or drugged-up gang fights.”
Nothing about this made any logical sense. But, then, Dean was getting pretty used to a world that made no sense, he supposed.
Dean remembered the African Dream Root fiasco—how the first time they’d used it to enter a dream, they’d basically had to beat the dreamer to death in order to escape. That route definitely wasn’t going to be an option this time. The second time he’d dreamwalked, with Charlie in her Djinn dream, Dean had needed to do some pretty heavy convincing in order to wake her up, and she had been aware that none of it was real before he’d started.
Sounding apologetic, Sam sighed. “You’re right. I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable. Nothing has changed for me, and I promise I won’t look at you any differently. I’m just happy for you. And I really want to meet this guy! What’s his name?”
“I’m sure that’s all true, and I hope that he does. Pets are a wonderful addition to most households. You might even consider it, once your home is more habitable.” Dean made a face, but Castiel still wasn’t looking. “But what I meant was that we spent the whole night talking with Sam, chatting openly with barely any preparation work on our joined backstory, and yet he didn’t seem at all suspicious that we aren’t actually a couple. He works with couples almost every day, happy and in crisis and in every state in between, but with us sitting in front of him, he couldn’t see any clues at all that we were anything but a devoted pair of men in a committed relationship.”
“Give it to me anyway,” Castiel growled, practically throwing himself onto the nearest stool. “Whiskey, straight. And I’m more concerned with quantity than quality, so don’t worry about which bottle.”
The soldier beside Naomi held up his arm, fist clenched, then took a hesitant step forward, holstering his handgun to pull the rifle strapped to his back around to his chest. Gripping it with one hand, he extended it gingerly and used the barrel to poke at the figure lying on the floor. The body flopped to the side, lifeless. It had been a doctor, or at least someone who wore scrubs, but the pattern of dried blood around the chest of its shirt, heavy directional splatters, said that it had been something else entirely before a bullet had been put through its head. Visible in the light of the soldier’s flashlight, a large chunk of bone was missing from the front of the corpse’s skull.
“Or,” Castiel said, flinching a little when both brothers quickly sharp gazes on him, “we just keep going, but at a slower pace. The horses can trot faster than a human can run, and definitely faster than a zombie can shuffle. They’ll follow, but they won’t catch up.”
“Will somebody please tell me what’s going on?” Gabriel nearly begged, and Sam looked mutinous as he crossed the room to stand by the other man in solidarity.
“Listen to me,” Dean said, gasping a little, as he regained his footing. He didn’t touch Castiel again, but he came close once more, stooping a little to put his eyes on a level with Castiel’s. He spoke with urgency, using his posture and his tone to compel Castiel to focus only on him, not on any of the madness and destruction that lay around them. “This never happened, not like this. This is a dream, powered by your grace. You are dreaming, Castiel.”
As he spoke, Castiel’s eyes moved in an arc across the ceiling, as though he could see through walls and ceilings and assess every part of the structure from where he was standing. Dean, on the other hand, was scanning Castiel, and his stomach was doing a slow roll inside of him. He hadn’t really put together, until that very moment, that there was a very real shot clock ticking here, and he needed to get it together while he still had the luxury of this dedicated time with Castiel.
Without warning, one of his legs started to buckle, and he barely managed to keep from falling forward onto his face. “Whoa,” he grunted. Claire’s grip shifted, causing her to slip precariously to the side, and she squeaked in surprise. “I gotcha, sweetie,” Dean said, attempting futilely to correct their balance. It wasn’t happening, though, and all he could do was control her slide to the ground.
The first available service slot was only a couple of days later, but it felt like a lifetime. Dean, pacing nervously as he waited, checked his watch for what must have been the twentieth time since arriving back at the house that evening. (
Dean rolled out of the bed, shivering slightly before he got his robe snugly wrapped around his shoulders. The robe was certainly seeing more use than usual, since he and Castiel had been housebound, isolating themselves and waiting out the nasty virus. First the library had closed, sending Castiel home; then the garage had cut hours and gone to servicing emergency cases only. The bar had been closed next, cut to takeout orders only, by government order, and finally both Bobby and Ellen had told Dean to just stay home completely. They’d reassured him that his job would still be there when he came back, that he was family, and family took care of each other, so he wasn’t
Castiel wasn’t in the kitchen, but he had been through there, as evidenced by the half-drunk pot of coffee and the washed cereal bowl in the sink drainer. He wasn’t in the living room, either, or in the second bedroom-turned-office. Dean was beginning to feel baffled when he noticed that the basement door was slightly ajar. Opening it the rest of the way, he heard Castiel’s low voice: “...and then the third little pig said, ‘Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.’”
“I might have been exploring already,” Dean slowly confessed. “Not, like, search and rescue, but…tuning in, listening.”
Dean hummed a little as he played. “Did it help?” he asked. “Did you need whatever it was that you managed to get from my doodles and dumb-ass ramblings?”
Castiel winced a little, thinking of missed dinners and lost weekends Dean had tolerated so graciously. Even the flower beds Dean had dug up for him, intending that Castiel be able to enjoy working in them all year, had turned out to be more Dean’s project than his own. His stomach twisted guiltily; he’d have to make it up to Dean in a big way.
Unsure what had prompted the criticism, Dean blinked. “He seems to do pretty well,” he said, feeling a bit defensive on Sam’s behalf. “I mean, he doesn’t keep stats of how many relationships succeed or fail under his watch, or if he does, he doesn’t share them with me, but he’s managed to get a pretty healthy practice going. At the rate he’s going, he might even be able to convince Eileen to get him that dog he wants by Christmas.”
It was the soft flare of Castiel’s nostrils that tipped Dean off, and then he quickly realized that the pronounced dilation eclipsing the sparkling blue of those eyes was more than could be accounted for by the evening darkness. “But the baseboards,” he said in feigned protest. Hell, if Castiel could play around, then Dean could give right back.
“Oh, man. That’s terrible.” Dean was getting distracted from where he’d been steering the conversation again, but he couldn’t help enjoying the way Castiel’s cheeks were turning pink.
“Is the bed really what’s got your focus right now? I’m not doing my job very well,” Castiel said, right before pulling his cock out of Dean so that he could flip him onto his back. Dean barely had a moment to note that the mattress hadn’t so much as bounced, and then his breath was being driven from his lungs as Castiel shoved back inside, lifting Dean’s hips to rest on the front of his thighs.
“Asshole,” Dean said, smiling in spite of the fact that his heart rate still hadn’t recovered. Castiel’s head was thrown back, and the line of his exposed throat drew Dean’s eyes like a siren song. He wanted to press his lips to the hollow above his collar bone, trace his tongue over his Adam’s apple, and nuzzle at the warmth under his jaw. His fantasies were so vivid that Dean didn’t even realize he was staring, or that Castiel had finished laughing and was staring back.
“But like I say, it wasn’t like I was just sitting back and listening to you play, like it was just entertainment. Cas, you were putting everything into that music, like you felt every word you were singing and you wanted me to feel it, too. And, uh, I did.” Looking a little unsure at how his admission would be taken, Dean bit his lip, watching Castiel cautiously.
“If you get eaten by the attic, I promise to have a closed-casket for whatever parts of you I can salvage,” Dean called upward, leaning against the doorframe to watch. “Not that it’s not a nice view, I mean.”
At the base of the staircase, a large set of double doors was closed, a rough two-by-four shoved through the handles keeping them secured. “Oh, shit, that’s not good,” one soldier muttered, and nobody bothered to hush him.
time would be the last and that he could finally just take a breath and take stock and try to figure out how to make the best of things, it turned out that, no, it still wasn’t going to be enough.
“Nope, his.” Charlie winked, waving her screwdriver. “Cross-referenced for easy reading. His college transcripts, included in his Officer Candidate School records and evaluations. Master’s Degree in engineering, which he got through an accelerated program in five years. Decent grades, but mostly because he had a bunch of arts classes to help with his overall GPA. And his volunteer work was almost all music—playing songs and singing to sick kids in the hospital, that kind of thing.”
“I am listening to you. Are you listening to yourself?” Sam argued back now, and the way he was visibly restraining himself, as though Dean was something fragile that needed to be handled delicately just pissed him off even more. “First you deliberately disobeyed orders from the major and put yourself in danger by tampering with your equipment. Then you somehow came to the bizarre conclusion that there’s a dude out there riding out the apocalypse by hosting a
The shout tore itself from Castiel’s lungs, and he flung himself backward and away from Dean without any clear thought beyond an absolute need to flee. At last, his brain had finally filled in the missing memories of what was coming next, and he trembled with dread. “No! I won’t! Not again!”
Dean knew his way around fine print. He was a goddamned professor, after all, and Dean Winchester, Ph.D., didn’t need any hand-holding to read a contract.
Glancing around at the piles of wood, Castiel narrowed his eyes. “The nailer doesn’t require two hands,” he said. “I also have some boxes of loose finish nails that can be hammered manually. If we work together, we’d only need half the time to finish the work before the painters start showing up tomorrow morning.”
“Now is really not the time,” snapped Castiel in an angry voice. Dean lifted his head again, eyebrows raised and ready to defend himself for feeling just the tiniest bit upset at this new development, but his words died in his mouth when he saw Castiel wasn’t even looking at him. The irritated rebuke had been addressed to a nearby tree.
“Dean,” Castiel said, jogging alongside him. “It’s been too long since I’ve been able to get out and run.” His cheeks were slightly pink, and he seemed to be actually enjoying himself, judging by the sparkle in his eyes. He also seemed to be barely breaking a sweat.
“…but we’d have to convince the major of what you’re saying, and also talk her down when she finds out you disobeyed her in the first place,” Sam finished.
“But you haven’t done anything to provoke that sort of torture,” Balthazar said. It wasn’t a question; outside of mass kitten extermination, he couldn’t fathom anything that would warrant it.
Cas. I might want to take time to think before we go rushing off into making hasty decisions, but that doesn’t mean I’m nervous.”
“Jesus,” Victor muttered. “We’re supposed to make it through that?” Dean wanted to tell him to shut up, but he wasn’t wrong. Around the sides of the clinic, dozens of zombies were shuffling, and the swarm seemed to thicken substantially as it disappeared from view around the building. A few cars and vans were scattered between where they stood and the door to the clinic, but the further they’d have to go, the more likely it was that somebody would be spotted.
A sudden widening of Dean’s eyes was the only hint Castiel got. He looked down at his body just in time to feel a rough jerk from somewhere within and then watch himself follow the rest of the forest as it disappeared into the haze.
“Yeah, no. I bought this place,” Dean admitted miserably. “In my defense, it was a really low asking price.”
“I know. It’s all part of the Winchester package,” she said. “Rarely boring, even when you might wish otherwise. Now, I managed to do a pretty good patch-up job on you while you were out, and I don’t think you’ll be laid up too long, but there are a few things I do need to check now that you’re awake.” Switching into a more clinical gear, Tessa peeled back bandages to examine abrasions, probed at his ribs, and had him turn his head from side to side to make sure his range of movement was typical for him. Dean watched in silence, apparently fascinated.
“So what’s in the boxes? I missed that part of the explanation,” Dean said as they entered the house. He dropped the box on the coffee table and wiggled his fingers to get some blood back into them.
Dean was eyeing him, humor making the corners of his mouth twitch. Apparently, Castiel’s own discomfort was helping distract Dean from his doubts. “Yeah, I think they know that,” he murmured. “Kinda the way this works.”
The work wasn’t difficult at all, from a mental perspective, and Dean found that he could lose himself pretty easily to the rhythm of it. Seeing rooms start looking like rooms once again, instead of labyrinths of lumber studs, was giving him the first real visual signs of progress, and he couldn’t wait until they could start painting.
“It’s just Meg,” Castiel said unconcernedly. “She’s coming to pretend to give me some sleeping pills. Angels don’t need sleep.”
A pink blush suffused Dean’s cheeks as he blinked, and Castiel realized with a start that he must have spoken aloud. Well, it didn’t matter, in all probability. Shame was an irrelevant concept at this point.
“I…didn’t?” Castiel said, confused. “It was an adverb, modifying the verb ‘to be’? They’re homonyms.” His confusion only grew when Sam bent almost double in laughter and Dean slapped a hand over his eyes.
“Maybe, though they could still have been killed,” Naomi said. “Also, many of the files show that patients who got those shots died of ‘unknown neural disorders’ or other brain-related issues. They were spread out over multiple bases, administered when he traveled, or else someone had to have noticed.”
“What do you mean?” Grabbing a second glass, Balthazar filled it with water and nudged it into place beside the first glass in an unspoken hint.
“Thank God,” Jimmy said when he saw them. “Extra sets of hands. Between the four of us, we might just be able to survive camping with a pup.” One of the tent poles, under tension, popped free as he spoke, and Castiel dropped his bag so he could help with wrestling it into submission.
“Damn it,” Sam muttered. That was exactly the way Crowley had described Castiel’s non-reaction to him, right up until the point at which Lucifer discovered Crowley’s presence and put an end to his communication attempts. “You’re sure that there’s nothing at all we can do to help?”
Castiel slid his hand from Dean’s scalp downward to cradle his jaw, bringing his other hand up to mirror it on the opposite side. “You really want me to?” he said in a voice deeper and rougher than Dean had ever heard him use. “You want me to describe to you the things I’ve been imagining doing to you since the very first night we met? How the way you got all flustered made me want to put that blush back in your cheeks just so that I could taste the heat of it on my tongue? How every time I’ve been forced to watch you crawl on your knees as you worked, I wanted nothing more than to get my hands all over that gorgeous ass, to rip away those old jeans and make you scream yourself hoarse? How I haven’t been able to fucking
Dean glanced at Claire once more. She’d settled on the floor next to him, still refusing to move from his side, and she was quietly drawing another picture. “After all that, I think I need a good long while before I can think about pups,” he admitted. “As afraid as I was for myself, I was more scared for her. You gotta know, I’d never have forgiven myself if something had happened.”
“Only a moron conflates all Yiddish music with polka,” Castiel said scathingly. “It’s Klezmer, not—”
“He joined the poker game, so he’ll probably be occupied for a while with that. He’ll cheat, but he’s pretty bad at it, since he can’t keep from smirking when he’s doing it.”
This time, the unexpected memory, rather than pouring over Castiel like a tsunami, snapped into place with a near-audible click. “Oh,” he breathed, and though the fog in his vision was still growing thicker, he could see the bodies disappear from around them, leaving only dirt, rock, and dead leaves.
The weight of the conversation eased after that, and as the afternoon rolled on, Castiel ordered a few pizzas for them to share, using one of the gift cards the office staff had sent them while Dean was hospitalized. “I have to say, it’s been amazing to see how supportive and caring everyone has been during this,” Castiel said after hanging up the phone. “Ellen Harvelle, from the Roadhouse, brought over three different casseroles, and Dean’s boss arranged for a grocery delivery to the house the day Dean was discharged. It’s made things much easier.”
“Dean, are you kidding me? Look at this dining room!” Sam’s eyes were going to pop right out of his head if he didn’t calm down a little, and Dean was trying very hard not to feel affronted by the sheer surprise in his brother’s reactions. After all, it really was warranted, even if he was still pretending it wasn’t.
He choked on a startled laugh. “Like pie?” he said. “Yeah, there might have been…something like that.”
“He was a Newbery judge, you know,” Castiel added snidely, rolling his eyes. “Pompous ass, trotting that out every time he wants to get his way. He can take his Newbery experience and shove it right up his—”
“Or brain fevers from meningitis or encephalitis, once we realized it was spreading,” Dean said. “All those college kids in dorms, sharing bodily fluids, were the problem, right? There was a different theory every day.”
Dean was calling his name again, urgently, and Castiel jerked back to attention. “We can’t stay here,” he said, cutting off Dean’s demands for attention.
For the entire time they’d left him here, according to Meg, he’d been all but catatonic. Actually, now that Dean thought back, she’d said he was “sleeping.” But that didn’t make sense, did it? Castiel had been mojoed up at the time, fully angel even if a bit damaged, and if there was one point that was being repeatedly pounded home through this mess, it was that angels didn’t sleep. Dean wondered whether Castiel had lain there just like this, all night and all day, with eyes wide open and staring, or whether that was just part of this dream. He sincerely hoped it was the latter, because just the thought of Castiel lying motionless and glassy-eyed all that time was disturbing.
Gabriel shook his head. “Nah, I just told you. You caught a break by finding this now instead of next year, or it’d probably be a different story, though.” He was still smiling, but Dean’s nerves had been on edge before he’d arrived, and they were only getting worse.
“Well, then I don’t know what to say. If he’s still alive, then he can’t be her brother. And if he’s her brother, then he must have had one hell of an imagination, along with a scary streak of prophetic ability, to have recorded something like that ahead of time. And he did have the creativity, I know, but the other part…” Charlie shrugged.
The repetitive manual labor was more taxing physically than most of what Dean had been doing. He could work up a decent sweat quickly, crawling around with a utility knife and hacking away at the drywall before hoisting it in his arms. The stuff was fairly lightweight, but the effort added up until his upper back was bitching at him and his shirt was sticking unpleasantly to his chest. After the first day of drywall work, Dean decided he was grateful for the “prison shower” of concrete block in the basement. Maybe it was the opposite of spa luxury, but it meant he didn’t have to choose between crawling into bed with sweat drying on his skin, or else trying to cover an unfinished bathroom with plastic so he could take a shower in what looked like the house in
Sam pressed his lips together at her casual confirmation, then pushed on. “But now that you’ve helped kick off this rescue mission, you could at least let us know whether anything’s actually happening, or whether I need to be ransacking the Men of Letters’ books to figure out a way to at least get Dean back, even if he can’t bring Cas with him.”
Meg lifted an eyebrow, tapping the phone against her opposite palm. “You can chalk it up to how many hours I’ve spent slaving for you that I could actually parse that incoherent nonsense and get the gist of what you meant. You heard me say there was sexual tension in your texts, and that it explained why Castiel is putting you ahead of common sense and company policy, and from that you inferred that it looks like you’re pining and he’s politely ignoring it. Am I right?”
The laughter died abruptly a few minutes later, when they crept south between buildings labeled “VETERINARY.” Zoms didn’t go after animals other than the two-legged variety, everyone knew, but that small consolation hadn’t really mattered; the growling they could hear through the broken windows was definitely not human, and when one soldier cautiously lifted his head and peered inside, he immediately gagged and clapped a hand over his mouth. A muscle in Sam’s jaw jumped as he clenched his teeth. Dean wasn’t the dog-lover Sam was, but even he felt his stomach roll uneasily at the thought of animals starving slowly in cages, waiting for owners who would never come.
Castiel chewed his lip. “That’s true,” he said. Both men looked toward the saw. Neither of them moved a hand toward it. “Go ahead, Dean,” Castiel said. “It’s your house. You know how to do this part.”
“It’s just ridiculous how many times I’ve fallen down this rabbit hole or that one, getting distracted from what I’m supposed to be researching by some other shiny bit of history.” Dean lifted his glass of beer and took a long swallow, letting his tired eyelids droop closed. He sighed in satisfaction as he dropped the glass back to the bar top. “God, it took me half an hour to get my eyes to focus when I turned off the computer tonight.”
Dean’s heart lurched. God, this was hard. If Sam and the rest were right, if this was all just a recording, then he was almost certainly listening to a guy telling his own future—not a huge prophetic leap to make, under the circumstances, but disturbing nonetheless. He wondered if the recordings would just stop, as the man got weaker and weaker until he starved, or if there would be a final recording that captured his grisly death, preserving his last cries and screams. Dean didn’t know which would be worse.
“That sucks.” Dean’s sympathy was genuine, even though he knew how much grief he’d given his own brother over the years with just as little provocation.
. A bright handheld light was coming closer to Castiel’s eye, and he keened, a high-pitched noise that echoed through the woods, and strained against implacable bonds.
you violate a direct order, on the heels of being reprimanded for breaking protocol in the first place! The insubordination you have shown in this matter demands consequences, and I will be speaking with the head of Runners first thing in the morning." Dean wanted to argue, but a subtle jerk of Sam's head had his teeth clamping hard on his tongue.
“Hey, Sam, remember when I convinced you that we could fly if we tied capes around our necks and jumped off something high enough? And you hurt your arm, but I begged you not to tell Mom and Dad what happened, and they ended up having to take you to the hospital for a cast, but you just clamped your mouth shut and refused to say anything at all, so they wound up deciding that you must have done something wrong but that the broken arm would have to be punishment enough?” Dean was still laughing to himself as they banged mud from their sneakers outside the dorm.
“Zephyr knocked over my tower!” piped a tiny voice directly into his ear. Castiel jerked backward in surprise, barely managing to avoid stumbling over a pile of books strewn over the floor. He spun to locate the owner of the voice, but the tiny pink blur was already flitting over his shoulder toward a slightly smaller ball of lavender brilliance.
“C’mon, Bobby, she’s a kid,” Sam argued. “We couldn’t just leave her there alone. She’s got a busted knee.”
“Until recently, I always thought Gabriel behaved this way as some sort of misplaced older brother obligation. You’re the older brother in your family, though, and the dynamic is reversed, so now I’m reexamining my theory,” said Castiel. “Maybe it’s a hair thing? There is a certain similarity, there…”
When Amelia had given them the directions to the campsite, in case the two vehicles got separated on the road, Dean had assumed that “state park” meant that they’d be camping in a fairly populated area, tamed of the rougher edges of nature. Instead, he saw the asphalt road narrow to a single lane, then turn to gravel, and finally begin to disappear under grass overgrowth before Jimmy’s station wagon came into view, parked at the edge of a treeline. A tiny single-track path heading into the deeper woods was just visible beyond it.
Castiel’s breathy laughter quieted, though the smile stayed, as he shook his head. “You don’t even know how much you actually did. I need to confess, Dean. I’m really not exaggerating when I say that I was so close to just giving up; you and your brother truly arrived in the eleventh hour, in all likelihood. I was struggling—no, that’s not right. I had been struggling for months, but I think I had just…stopped. I was drowning.”
“He’s really not bothering me, Doctor,” Castiel said, worried that she might actually make Dean leave. He might be embarrassed beyond belief, but that didn’t mean he wanted to see Dean go.
“It’s October, not Christmas,” Sam retorted. “And I’m not sure this really rises to the level of a heroic act.”
“There’s a secretary’s desk on the other side of that partition, there,” Castiel called. “It has a sliding window to the hall. If it’s clear, we can try going through that.”
Castiel shifted under the sheets, his breath catching in his throat at the pain that came with the movement. From shoulder to knee, his left side felt like one massive bruise, and his back and hips seemed to have been scraped raw, judging by the way they burned against the slide of the fabric. His neck ached like he had a case of terrible whiplash, and his head was beginning to throb. In the middle of his agony, he fought to remember what had happened.
“Hey, give me some credit. I have taste.” He felt like taking his phone back, but that sort of self-sabotage was a step too far, even for him.
Sam pulled off the road into a small stand of trees. Behind them, they could still see the distant shapes of the zombies trailing them. Castiel had no idea how good a zombie’s vision was, but it was probably safer to assume that if he could see, then he could be seen. Sam, checking his pistol, seemed to have concluded the same thing.
“Ropes,” Castiel said, eyelids fluttering and jaw tightening as he fought for control. “Always have plenty on hand. Lots of ways to get creative. Was just imagining you…your legs completely bound to those posts…right at the edge of the mattress…so many things I could do…” Without warning, perhaps as the description of his fantasy wound up being a little too effective, Castiel’s hips suddenly jerked forward erratically, slamming into Dean hard. Dean was caught completely unguarded, and his orgasm didn’t so much creep up on him as violently explode through him.
He caught other exchanges, ranging from what sounded suspiciously like water cooler gossip to those talks that seemed more akin to memo dictation. Other familiar names continued to crop up: some talk of Zachariah, a few far more reverent mentions of Raphael and Michael. One passing angel that Dean strongly suspected of being a Cupid, based on the unsettling amount of bare skin Dean had glimpsed before he’d jumped behind a corner, was speaking in English to a suit-clad companion, though their conversation was no less confusing for not being in Enochian.
“Enough, Mister Winchester,” she said. Despite the formality of the words, Castiel noted that Naomi’s lips were shaking the tiniest bit, revealing that she was actually fighting off a giggle. Nobody who didn’t know her extremely well would have picked up on it, but it was clear as day to him. No matter how much Dean insisted that Naomi would happily see him skinned for a floor covering in her office, Castiel had a sneaking suspicion that she was softening toward Dean.
sorry. This whole trip was my idea, just so we could get to know you better, and instead you wound up in the hospital. You could have—” She cut her thought short, turning her head away.
like we’ve been dating, and letting him keep on believing that I’m not, in fact, depressingly alone and likely to stay that way…that wouldn’t be making things even worse?”
The door to Benton’s office stood slightly open, and Castiel kicked it the rest of the way, scanning the room with gun trained ahead of him. There were no zombies, but…there was nothing else, either. The filing cabinet in the corner had its drawers yanked open, emptied of their contents. The desk was bare to the wood, and the closet held no trace of coat or briefcase. It almost appeared that Benton had moved out entirely.
Sam broke in once more. "Major, we're both very sorry for your loss. What Dean is asking, though, is whether you're confident that Castiel was actually bitten. Is it possible that the zom only got his clothes, or that the teeth didn't break his skin? We've all had some pretty close calls that have had us going over our own skin, inch by inch, just to be sure we only got bruised. Maybe you didn't see what you thought you saw."
Much, much later, when they were both finally lying side-by-side in exhausted repletion, Dean turned his head to the side to brush his mouth against Castiel’s warm shoulder. “I should put this on your Yelp review,” he joked. “A-plus home renovation, house looks amazing, guaranteed best orgasms of your life.”
) all this time, and he knew there was really only one way that was going to happen. Instead of saying that, though, he just huffed and shook his head. “You’re just trying to put it off. It won’t get any less creepy for waiting, dude.”
The stranger threw back his head and laughed, almost loud enough to cover the sound of Castiel, from the rise above them, sobbing Dean’s name as he broke down entirely.
“Oh!” Castiel said, going from embarassed to mortified in a heartbeat. “God, I’m sorry. I’m intruding, making everything about…of course, you have many other things going on in your life outside of this job and your house. Please, just tell me to mind my own business, and I promise I won’t—”
Dean suddenly remembered the small argument Castiel had had with him just the night before, when he’d found Dean drinking alone in the war room. Dean had been deep in his own head, thinking of everything that was likely to go wrong in their fight with Chuck, and getting thoroughly drunk for his probable last night on earth had seemed like a reasonable plan.
Truthfully, Dean was more than a little uncomfortable about an intensive “get to know the in-laws” trip with no possibility of escape in the event that things got weird, but he wasn’t going to let Castiel know how reluctant he felt. No matter how many times Castiel swore that he’d never wanted a primly submissive omega to keep his house and obediently bear him litters of fat pups, Dean couldn’t help thinking that he should at least try to make things easier for the guy when it came to dealing with an extended family that might have had different ideas about what an appropriate partner looked like.
“Christ, I’d have cancelled on me,” Dean said, horrified. “Let your brother spin in the wind if he wants to mess with you that hard. Why do you even still work for a douche like that?”
“Yeah, hah, I will. He actually teased me some, talking about how proud he was that I’d finally broken my streak of nightmare dates. Kind of funny, right? You and me, putting on that act, and it turned out better than most of my real dates lately.” Dean was watching Castiel closely, searching for any subtle reactions, but the way he had turned back to examine the work he was doing made that difficult.
“Dean, I need you to tell me what’s going on, and quickly. I don’t think I can handle much more weirdness,” Castiel said. “If I have family left, and they’re here…I come from a large family, with lots of cousins, and there were others in the military. Please.” His heart was beginning to race, and he had no idea what to make of Dean’s blatant nervousness.
A shot rang out over his head. Distracted, he wasn’t prepared when his horse panicked and reared. The reins slipped from his hands, and he grabbed frantically at the horse’s mane as he slid. The hooves slammed back to the ground, jolting him hard and making his teeth clack painfully, and then Castiel was sliding sideways, holding on for dear life as the horse galloped forward along the pavement.
“Almost done, I promise,” Dean swore, struggling to remind himself that this wasn’t actually happening, that they were in a memory and not actually in Heaven’s torture department. Then again, this was an angel’s dream, and if Dean could be hurt or killed, maybe angels could, too. “Naomi’s not here, but she’ll probably be back. We have to go, right now. Can you walk, or…”
