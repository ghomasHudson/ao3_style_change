Ah, now they were beginning to get somewhere, realised John, standing and moving to the kitchen to put the kettle on to boil, the tricky matter of feelings. He rubbed his hand over his chin, feeling the five o’clock shadow and needing tea more than ever before. Why had he thought this was going to be simple? He wished he had never said anything, wished it had remained a fantasy that would probably have passed after a while anyway. He sighed.
The sleek, black limousine with tinted window glides to a silent stop outside the Roland Kerr College of Further Education. Mrs. Hudson raises an eyebrow at Sherlock who ignores it. The debate over the venue had raged far and wide between Mrs. Hudson, Mummy and Mycroft, all of whom had been astounded by their choice when London offered such a plethora of heart-stoppingly beautiful venues. Mycroft’s main objection was the fact that the College’s library, the location John and Sherlock had insisted on, wasn’t actually registered as a wedding venue. He had sniffed his displeasure at Sherlock, then pushed through the necessary paperwork.
“Do you remember when you insisted on having a garden bed all of your own? You had to be allowed to dig it over, plant it up and tend it all by yourself”.
As Sherlock opened and closed cupboard doors looking for lunch ingredients, he opened one door in particular. John watched as the loose apricots he had bought himself rolled forwards out of their paper bag. One maintained its momentum and rolled forwards, off the shelf and towards a horrified Sherlock who stood back out of its path, visibly shuddering at the offensive fruit. They watched transfixed as the apricot fell down to the counter, bounced once, lifting slightly into the air before falling towards the kitchen table, where it hit against a leg, changed trajectory and with two more small bounces rolled towards the living room, coming to a gentle stop beside John’s chair.
Sherlock was shocked when he finally identified the noise. Couldn’t understand why he hadn’t always known. It was a voice, a man’s voice and it was talking to him, a voice saying it needed him. Its ok, Sherlock thought, I’m coming, just hold on, wait for me.
Inside were a few old chairs covered in tatty fake leather, a few with the foam spilling out. The whole place stank of ancient cigarette smoke and the single fluorescent light flickered as it struggled to light. The walls were panelled in a dark wood and at one end was a hatch with a single desk stood behind it.
Lestrade had called the previous day “Oh I’ve got one for you here alright Sherlock, a triple murder, two parents and a nanny. Their child is missing and we’ve got nothing”. Sherlock had glanced at John. They were all due to visit Harry and Molly in Canterbury and Emilia was bursting in excitement at seeing her Aunties.
“No, the mother tested negative, but as you know, the physical effects of substance abuse can be wide ranging.”
“You want me to fill you?” John growls. Sherlock’s only response is to push back even harder onto John’s cock.
The report listed the top five negatives in a relationship as: constant fighting, miscommunication, household chores, jealousy and keeping secrets and that it was important to strengthen what was going well. Sherlock was by now confident that he had successfully addressed the first three. Jealousy was a little bit of an issue for them, more so for John but when Sherlock recalled the delicious blow job he had recently received from John after flirting with a female suspect in an attempt to elicit information, he decided that maybe it was not all bad.
man down so he was level with John. Holding him up by his buttocks, John began to kiss harder, giving in to the adrenaline still charging through his veins. He squeezed the delectable buttocks and began to run his suddenly hard dick against Sherlock’s groin, grinding and pushing. Sherlock’s hands had been hanging by his sides but now he lifted them to John’s chest and in small movements pulled uselessly at John’s stripy jumper. John was more interested in the fact that Sherlock’s dick was also now rock hard and began undoing the leather belt of his trousers.
“They are” He inhaled sharply “Hairy, John. They are squishy and have a groove that reminds me of Mycroft’s…” he stared into the middle distance, nose and top lip curling. “Bring fruit if you must, but do not expect me to eat any of it”. He moved to his Belstaff hanging up by the door, extracted his wallet and removed £100 “For your shoes” he instructed as he handed John the cash before taking up his place at the kitchen table once more.
Keeping the pistol firmly in the small of Mary’s back, John pushed her out of the taxi onto the empty, wet pavement.
Oblivious to John’s arrival in the room, Sherlock was throwing himself into his playing, head moving with the flow of the bow, eyes closed and whole body tensed and rocking with the music. John stood for a moment and watched the beauty of him, the angles and energy projecting from Sherlock, the peace on his face and agile, electric movements of his fingers on the strings. It was hypnotic and John only stopped staring when Sherlock suddenly put down the bow and opened his eyes.
Both, knowing they were inevitably being watched, maintained their cover. Sherlock approached the counter and made a small purchase of tobacco. In giving him his change, Sherrinford slipped him a note on a cigarette paper, an address, and in the local Darija dialect wished Sherlock goodbye.
“Ah, John, this is..” but John cut him off, glaring at the woman “Nice to meet you. If you will excuse us, I need Sherlock for a moment. Just something I need to show him”. Pulling Sherlock firmly by the hand, John made for the glass exit door.
“Do sit down Major, it has been a very long time since I was saluted and even longer since I returned one.”
“Do calm down John. The Met has come a long way recently in its inclusiveness and as for the Government, most of them went to public school, so this is of little consequence to them”.
John decided to remain loyal to his husband, “only a bit, he soon got over it.” The two glanced over to where their respective husbands were squabbling, Sherlock teasing Mycroft over the size of the wedding cake. Unexpectedly, Sherlock grinned at his brother and put out his hand. Mycroft took it and carefully pulled his little brother into a stiff, awkward hug that lasted just three seconds.
By now the dining table was littered with empty plates, glasses and napkins. The silver candelabras were lit and the evening was drawing in. Glad of a moment to himself in this whirlwind of a day, John looked around at the happy faces of their guests; at the end of the table Sherlock’s mother was having an animated discussion with Mike Stamford while next to her Sherlock’s father was laughing at something Major General Sandra Peake was saying. John was honoured at the woman’s attendance, hadn’t seen her since they had served together in Afghanistan. James Sholto and Mycroft were even having a chat, although God knows neither of them were good at small talk. Mycroft’s right hand was underneath the table, as was Lestrade’s left while he listened to Sherlock. John was in no doubt they were holding hands. Mrs. Hudson was busily discussing her cake recipe with Sally who was gamefully trying not to look bored.
“I’ll text you from the hospital. For God sake, clean up the kitchen” and cradling his arm headed off down the stairs.
“Then when you had finally given in and begged, I would sink all the way down, take in every inch of you, wrap you up in myself and truly have you. I would move slowly at first and then speed up, brining you closer and closer, never taking my eyes off you as you arch up and press into me”.
It was shocking after the dream-like state they had been in. It took John a moment to realise what was going on as he watched Sherlock’s face. He lifted himself up and kissed Sherlock deeply, tongues clashing and teeth catching.
“In fact, I think your beautiful prick should be immortalised in art. It should be photographed, painted and have poetry written about it, Oh,” he was struck with an idea “It should have statues made of it”.
“I have some ideas but need to think about them. I need the phone records – Anderson has it- and the autopsy report. You also need to interview the girlfriend. I estimate they have been together approximately two and a half weeks and she has not been to the flat or been given a key but you should confirm that. Come along John and you can tell me how you knew the victim”.
“Yes, I think I would have. Agreed, maybe not yet, but I couldn’t have carried on the way I have been. I want you Sherlock. There, you want to know what I want and feel and need? I want you. I want you to be mine and no-one else’s, I want to have you by my side and in my bed as my friend, my lover, my ever-after. I want you to be there when I am struggling because you are my reason to keep going, the calm to my storm, the stillness to my panic. I want to be there for you, take care of you when you are beat up, or sleep starved. I want to hold you and comfort you when your brain is in overdrive and you can’t eat or play the violin or even think. I want to be the one you turn to when every single thing else in the universe is driving you mad and you know I will make it better. That’s what I want”.
They arrived ahead of the uniformed support and Lestrade decided they should go around the back of the house and try to make their entrance through the French doors to give them the advantage of surprise. Unfortunately, when they looked through the doors, it was them that were surprised the most.
“Because, that’s what I would like too. Not right away, but, yeah. I’d like to have a baby with you.” John grins and they grin at each other. “As soon as you said it, my head filled with pictures of this curly-headed whirlwind of mischief, playing with Rosie. I could hear her laugh and it just seemed so right.” John gazes at Sherlock, eyes dancing with joy at this imagined child. Then he draws himself up straight, his face filled with determination.
Ginger shrugs, still looking bored. “Met her about a year ago, begging on the streets. She was rubbish at it, so we sort of took her in. Her and that friend of hers.”
“Because I knew he was going to be unbearably smug about it. He was happier when he won the mini-Bake Off than when he won the actual Bake Off.” John grins at Sherlock, soft and fond. He’s shed his jacket and has rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt, and he’s looking just about good enough to eat. Sherlock has to restrain himself from dragging John off somewhere for a shag; there has to be a secret corner around here somewhere, a good snog at least might get some of the antsy energy out of his system.
Sherlock smiles to himself and watches John bake. He’s good at this, a natural, really. He’s photogenic and charming and self-deprecating.
“It never is, though. You want the judges and the audience to like you, makes things easier. So, Sherlock. Where are you from?”
“Any more stories about your nanny, maybe, how she taught you to bake? The judges loved that, and the audience did too.” Emma smiles at him encouragingly. She’s one of these annoying people on whom his death glares seem to have no effect, and his most barbed comments just glide off her like she’s made of teflon.
“I don’t know about that.” John gestures uncertainly between the two of them. “I never really thought this whole just sex thing would work, and I got into it anyway. So. That’s on me.”
“He was a pathetic knife fighter, John, you would have been disappointed,” Sherlock points out, and from his tone John knows that Sherlock is trying to get John to see the funny side of this.
Sherlock shrugs. “I sat my A-Levels when I was sixteen. I had two years to kill before I could apply to RADA. Long story short, yes, the stories are true, I am a genius.”
Then to Star Baker. Everybody tenses. Sherlock can see Irene visibly straighten and tuck her clothing into place. Moriarty is trying not to show that he’s nervous, he’s standing still, but his fingers drum on the pants of his obnoxious chef whites. John is gripping his cane more tightly, but paradoxically he isn’t putting any weight on it at all. Most of the others, sure that they won’t win, look a mixture of bored, hungry and hot.
The hosts are the two owners of the London Baking Emporium, former renowned pastry chefs Martha Hudson and Marie Turner. The judges are three professional bakers.  There’s up-and-coming talent Sebastian Moran, the cool, judgemental pastry chef of the three star London restaurant Le Circ. The second member is the owner of the famous cafe and bakery Just Desserts Gregory Lestrade. The third is the queen of the pop-up pastry shops Sally Donovan. The hosts and judges mingle among the contestants, meeting and greeting everybody. When it’s his turn Sherlock has the impression that they’re all wildly curious about him, so he tries to be as mysterious as possible. He notices they all tip-toe a bit around John, and he wonders about the cane again.
"Sherlock felt John’s stare and turned to meet his eyes. For a long moment, they gazed at each other across the table until Sherlock winked at John. John threw his head back in laughter. Sherlock had probably only winked at him once, the day they had first met in Barts and John was sure Sherlock knew this too."
“It’s a wild boar, Redbeard. Quick, let’s trap it!” They plunged through the hedge, sword aloft, only to discover not a wild boar but Sherlock’s fifteen year old brother Sherrinford – and Annie Baker from the village.
“Greg, stay with us or I’m going to have to let Sherlock kiss you too and none of us want that, although he is very good at it” he murmured into Lestrade’s ear. “Come on Greg!”
John had expected the interior to be as conventional as the entrance and, in some ways, it was; wooden shelves gleamed with silken ties, glass-fronted cabinets displayed everything from braces to cufflinks. However, this was offset by full-size, solid glass mannequins displaying sharply fitted suits. The entire back of the shop was a rainbow of shirts suspended on hangers from steel wires, criss-crossing each other. A glass and chrome spiral staircase led up from one corner of the room.
“Right. Yes. Good. Well” John took a deep breath, squared his shoulders and calmly stated “You see the thing is, I know you aren’t interested in, or rather I should say it’s not your area, but I happen to be very sexually attracted to you and sometimes it can get a bit much and I sort of happened to meet this boke in a pub one night and I found myself, well, doing things with him and er, pretending it was you. Then he turned up dead on the floor of his apartment and I panicked because I never intended for you to find out, and its entirely my problem and I don’t expect you to do anything about it or even..”.
He dipped his head to Sherlock’s left pectoral and licked, then sucked and finally bit hard, leaving a blood red mark right over Sherlock’s heart.
The silent pair head down the path across the lawn and down towards the small orchard and herb garden, revived by Mr Holme’s loving tender care from the remnants of a more ancient garden. Pausing to point at an overgrown patch, fronds of long grass crisp in the frost, Sherlock’s mother turns to her youngest son:
Despite being less than a mile from their flat, John had never visited this grocers shop before. That was a sad reflection of their lifestyle really and he was nearly as much to blame for that as Sherlock. The fantastic arrangement of fruit and vegetables were making John’s mouth water. Really, the display was a work of art in itself. Arranged left to right, the fresh produce was organised by the colours of the rainbow. Tomatoes, red peppers, dark red apples, raspberries and strawberries nestled up against cumquats, sweet potatoes, oranges, persimmon, butternut squash and nectarines. The blueberries and blackberries at the far end glistened beckoningly. John grinned when he spotted the aubergines.
Warily, John stuttered “Go on”. He was not fond of being the subject of Sherlock’s experiments, even those he did actually know about.
Moments later;  breathing hard, sweating, buttocks cramping, he floats back setting inside himself and is met with John’s grinning face. John pulls away, staying close but not touching.
Michael? Michael. Why hadn’t Sherlock thought of him sooner. He sat upright for the first time in two hours.
John was never a fan of Sherlock going off without him as back up, given his consultant detective’s unerring ability to get himself into trouble, but he was a grown man and John
Then came the words, the unexpected kind words. He thought he had misheard the first one, looked down at John in confusion, but the kisses and the soft words kept coming. John was not withdrawing and the gentle kisses felt so nice. It felt like John was kissing his scars better. He scolded himself for such a ridiculous sentimental thought but allowed himself to drift into the relaxation the kisses brought. Dopamine, he identified. Norepinephrine and epinephrine. Straight to his limbic system. Just like cocaine.
“Keep reading it love. Put in some wrong bits, he might wake up just to correct you” John encouraged.
Sherlock is flicking through the book on his lap, examining the photos and maps. He hands the book to his husband  “Was there a police investigation?”
They sipped the coffee and watched the sun descend, swapping stories and reliving childhood memories. Sherlock told him all about his cases, John, Moriarty and his network and Sherrinford told the tale of how he met his wife and persuaded her to marry him.
This is the story of how John and Sherlock became fathers to Emelia, who features in Chapter 22 and my work Blood Rising.
He reached out to the bedside locker and picked up Sherlock’s glasses from where they lay, as always, lenses faced down and automatically turned them over so they were arms down in order save the lenses from being scratched. He knew it didn’t matter now but did it anyway, carefully leaving the glasses in easy reach of the bed. He would have to do something with them later but they felt too personal an item just to throw away.
Sherrinford considered this, “It clears the mind, being dead. Makes you realise what’s important. In all those days I was doing Mycroft’s bidding, having adventures, I never thought I would want this, family, a settled life. Never give up on him.”
Time has been kind to him, John thought, kinder than it has been to me. Twenty two years, a lifetime. Of course, if anyone asked him he would pretend to calculate it, work it out, make a big show of not knowing. In truth he knew how long it was to the month. Practically to the minute.
“John, I wish to request your assistance in a certain matter tomorrow. I have extended my request to my brother but, as yet, he seems unable to respond. As usual, I shall leave him in your capable hands, but whether or not he deems to attend, please understand that I would very much appreciate your own co-operation.  A car shall be sent for 11.30 am. It is a formal matter and a suit would be appropriate attire.”
"Too late mate, I've found it." John's hand had landed into a very wet patch on the rug. He wiped it on his pajamas, not that it helped much.
Sherlock and John have been a couple for five months and, of course, have been raising Rosie together for longer. When Mary left, John had needed all the help he could get in caring for infant Rosie. Sherlock regularly took care of her during the day so John could sleep. His speciality was giving her a bottle and walking the living room with Rosie on his shoulder until she slept. He had even forgiven her for vomiting down the back of his oldest Belstaff.
Sherlock nodded acknowledgement of the name and stooped to admire the boy, estimating he was four and a half months old with his mother’s dark skin but his father’s bright blue eyes. He stroked the child’s cheek gently. He had never imagined there would be another Holmes.
John heard the shot and had just a microsecond to wonder if it he had fired it. Then the glass from the window exploded in on top of him and he hit the ground covering his head from the shards. He lay on the ground waiting for the pain to kick in and saw the blood pooling around his face. It was only when he very cautiously lifted his head that he saw Mary lying next to him.
Brain whirring, John had no response. Was there a possibility Sherlock might want more? How on earth could he broach the subject again? Maybe he should just accept things the way they were and move on. But Michael seemed to think otherwise.
The acerbic insult he had resting on his bottom lip to spit at his brother dries up when he sees the kitchen table. Neatly laid out are; plates, cups and saucers, a selection of jams and marmalades in dainty miniature jars, a basket of various pastries and two servings of poached eggs resting on artisan bread. Mycroft’s jacket is hanging on the back of one of the chairs and his sleeves are rolled up. A strange noise emanates from him as he fills both a cafetiere and tea pot with boiling water.
My thanks as always to Breath4Soul for her brilliant Beta services. Breathy, the fluffy feels at the end are for you.
Sherlock knows from Mummy’s tone that objecting is pointless but his sigh as he heaves himself from his chair is as pointed as the end of Mycroft’s umbrella. Wordlessly carrying the compost bucket and trudging after his mother, Sherlock is transported back to being eight and remembers anew why he loathes coming here.
John considered for a moment. He had a shift at the surgery the next day and had intended to spend the day stocking the fridge and writing his first draft of the case notes for his blog. Nothing too pressing.
“Ok, I’m all done here. Let's go and choose your fabric and some accessories. Got to have the right shirt for a new suit.”
It had taken him a good ten minutes to settle on his usual black, fitted suit trousers, not the very tightest pair but not the oldest ones either. His choice of shirt was then narrowed down to a light blue or a white one. He was aware that the white one had a certain translucency that might appeal to John so decided on that one. What he couldn’t understand was why he was choosing to dress in a way to appeal to John, who had made it quite clear the previous night that he found Sherlock attractive.
Sherlock had practically drooled when John had mentioned that he could wear his dress uniform to get married in. Mary had said it was too over the top; Sherlock had gone into a bit of a trance for a few minutes as he considered the idea before declaring it ‘very acceptable’. John grins as he thinks of one of the treats he has organised for Sherlock for their honeymoon.
Unceremoniously, John dropped his and then Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms and pulled his husband to the sofa, lying him out flat and immediately covering him with his own body. John began the exquisite rubbing again, Sherlock holding him tightly and neither man letting a sound escape. They gazed into each other’s eyes as John pushed and rubbed into Sherlock’s taught belly.
The frustrations of his morning’s fruitless search for evidence coalesced with John’s efforts to be more helpful. Just as Sherlock brought the mallet down a third time with much greater force John raised the melon slightly and Sherlock’s aim was fractionally off. As John howled in pain, fragments of red watermelon and hundreds of seeds exploded everywhere, covering the entire kitchen but most especially John Watson’s face as he clutched his hand and Sherlock learned some of the British Army’s more inventive swear words.
His rise was halted by John’s right hand coming to rest on top of Sherlock’s and holding it there. Sherlock, nervous and hesitant, leaned slowly down and placed the lightest of kisses imaginable on the top of John’s head. John turned his head, pulled Sherlock’s hand a little further down, tuned it over and gently, kissed the palm.
“We should arrive separately and leave together. Is that not the tradition?” Sherlock had questioned. It was the closest thing Sherlock got to romance so John had begrudgingly capitulated.
For all their physical beauty, John had always been far more astounded by what those eyes could actually see. From Sherlock’s sweep of a person followed by breakneck deductions to the infinitesimally small clues they collected at a crime scene, he has experienced their uniqueness a thousand times over. More importantly, though was the way Sherlock truly saw John, the way he had seen John the first time they had met, looking past the comfy exterior to the very heart and identity of the man. Then winked at him.
Sherlock threw himself down on the double bed in the room, as soft as lying on four duvets piled high and lay on his back, hands clasped behind his head. He turned to the right and watched the moving images playing out in their frames on the wall; his first time with John, their first fight when Sherlock had been convinced it was all over, chasing criminals, dancing together, their wedding day – and night. John flicked and smiled his way across the wall.
John had little opportunity to do more than throw his purchase on his bed. As soon as he returned to the flat, Sherlock had dragged him out on a new case. They had spent a large amount of it squashed together in the space between a very real concrete wall and a fake plasterboard wall, recording the unwitting confession of a double murderer.
They stayed like that until it grew dark, exchanging pets and kisses, small words of love and affection and long stretches of just lying quietly together. Finally, John began to doze off and they agreed to retire to bed.
The Mind Palace in this story, and John's Room in particular are the same as I describe in greater detail in my story
Sherlock was acutely aware of John’s pain. When he had returned home after Mary’s death, Sherlock would watch him carefully, silently bringing John a glass of water and paracetamol. If that didn’t help, he offered an efficient shoulder massage that usually helped relieve the tension and swelling in the shoulder. Occasionally, he would suggest that John take a codeine tablet, kept locked in John’s medical box.
Sherlock continued to stare. He was aware that he was staring. He was also aware that his breathing had become faster and a bit shallow. He stared.
Sherlock looked doubtful. “What if he says no? I shall have made a complete fool of myself. Then things will become embarrassingly untenable at home.”
The research report in this story is real, as are the five steps outlined, with a few tweaks. The author of the report is Dr. Teri Orbuch Ph.D. You can read about it here
The touch rouses his sleeping husband, eyes opening to meet John’s, reaching in for a kiss and stretching himself at the same time. John is surprised and a little wary when Sherlock pushes forward and slowly, deliberately, grinds his erection into John’s.
John picks up the small box, kisses it gently and eases it carefully into the pocket. He just has time to pull the dress uniform straight when a beep comes from outside. Sitting at the kerb is a fully renovated 1942 Willys Jeep. Mycroft is sitting in the driver’s seat, sporting a pair of military style sunglasses and raising an eyebrow at John.
“I need you Sherlock. You know how I can get. I need to see you under me, spread out on the bed. Oh my beautiful, I need to see you with your hard dick in your hand, stroking it slowly while you gaze up at me, other hand thrown behind your head. You are such a tease when you’re like that Sherlock, all languid and pliable. I need to be able to lick you, lick you from the back of your ear, down, down past your nipples, down past your cock and lick that glorious arse of yours, fill you with my tongue until you squirm and pant. I need to lie on top of you, holding your hands above your head, still and dazed until I slowly, slowly press my cock into yours and move backwards and forwards, that delicious slide, while I bite and lick your neck, shoulders and collar bone”.
“He is in love John. I could see it all over him when he visited last night, but I have never seen it before then. He never revealed it to me and I am disappointed in myself for not deducing it but more hurt that he didn’t just  tell me.”
“Should one of us carry the other over the threshold?” The only response he gets is being dragged into the hallway as Sherlock rolls his eyes at him before making their way upstairs.
For sixteen days, Sherlock had paced back and forth across the rug of 221b Baker Street, pinning notes, photos, charts and densely drawn mind-maps in a seething mass of data that almost covered the whole wall. When not pacing frenetically, he was lying inert on the sofa for hours, lost in the hallways of his Mind Palace. Intermittently, The Work was disrupted by the symptoms of withdrawal that reduced Sherlock to a sweating, shaking mess hunched in the corner of the room. John did his best to help. The only things he ate were Mrs Hudson’s scones, dutifully delivered every morning with a largely ignored ‘coo-ee’.
A new handshake, another round of congratulations and another drink. More smiling and pretending while stealing glances over shoulders, between gaps in the growing crowd.
John snorts and nearly loses his tea out of his nose. “Thank you for the lovely breakfast, Mycroft, it was a kind thought and thank you for your congratulations.” He looks pointedly at Sherlock who, in turn, completely ignores him.
“Good morning, John.” Sherlock growls, deciding right that second that he would like to wake up this way every single morning for the rest of his life. It was even good enough to bother going to sleep in the first place for.
“Jealous!” Sherlock shouted back “Jealous of what? Of Mycroft being saddled with that inept excuse for a policeman. Or Lestrade getting my emotionally crippled brother?”
Sherlock stretched and shifted his weight. He was relaxed, sleepy and this had been a significant achievement for him, maintaining such a level of emotional discourse after such a magnificent orgasm. He patted John’s strong thigh and muttered “Just remember, I am not a china doll, John. You cannot break me” and fell asleep.
“You are mine. No one else gets to kiss you now. Certainly not some tart in a red ‘fuck –me’ dress, aghhhh” Sherlock was sucking harder now, sweeping his tongue across John’s slit and caressing his tight balls.
“Mark Willis’ new girlfriend. They had only been going out a couple of weeks. She has been found in Queens Park with her dog, head bashed in. She’s still alive but its touch and go. She was found in the bushes by another dog-walker, so we’re not sure how long she’d been lying there. Come on, let’s go and find this ball and then arrest the bastard. This certainly backs up your theory Sherlock”.
“I should very much like for us to do more kissing, and then, I would like you to make me that vegetarian dahl and spiced potato salad you promised me. I haven’t eaten properly in two days, I’m hungry and so are you”.
The rest of the afternoon was spent with Sherlock working at the kitchen table while John prepared dinner. He fed his addiction with a steady drip feed of small individual kisses, leaning back on his stool as John passed back and forth, lips offered up as he blocked John’s path until he got his way. Dinner eaten, Sherlock kept John close, even going so far as helping with the washing up so he could peck at John’s cheek when he couldn’t hold back any longer.
Mycroft met them at the door, handsome in a dark grey morning suit, with a pale yellow rose in his lapel. He shook them both by the hand, still maintaining his usual serious demeanour:
When he got home to Baker Street that evening, Sherlock was sat leaning over his microscope and surrounded by plates and dishes covering every inch of the kitchen table. Each dish held a dead pigeon in differing states of decay. The smell was rancid and pervasive:
“Mrs. Hudson” Sherlock barked “Charlotte’s formula is on the kitchen counter and the sterilised bottles are in the microwave marked ‘Charlotte's, and only Charlotte's’. Please feed her, she sounds hungry.
Sherlock wriggled under the bedclothes, removing his pyjama bottoms, sat up and pulled his t shirt off over his head. In the soft lamp light he looked the very same as he had ten years ago. He laid himself flat, arms and legs slightly spread, covers pushed back. His eyes took on a determined gleam.
Greg smiled “Good”. He didn’t offer to get John a drink, knew better, but did down a large one himself, surveying the crowd. This was the last one of these functions, the largest of them all and it was only right Sherlock was here.
From his position on his hands and knees, examining the deep scuff mark on the toe of the victim’s left shoe, Sherlock only heard the bang of the door as John left. He continued his examination until he became aware of someone staring at him.
“Yesterday, while Emelia was here, one of the other children fell ill. We were very concerned and took the child to their G.P. immediately. I am sorry to have to tell you, that child has now been confirmed as having bacterial meningitis. I am sure you understand the seriousness of this situation.”
“I believe that we are definitely in a relationship of sorts but am unsure of the parameters of its definition. A couple would comply with the norms of social construct but I believe that in standardised patterns of behaviour, that too short a period of time has elapsed for us to define it in such a way”
John slips his hand into Sherlock’s as they stroll towards the playground in the park. Sometimes, Sherlock catches sight of himself from outside. How ordinary they must look to others. How normal; a family at the park on a Sunday afternoon. Not at all like a recovering junkie hovering on the outskirts of raising the child of a suicidal, ex-assassin mother and a father with PTSD and anger management issues.
She sighed slightly, screwing up her nose “Papa would be able to explain to me what on earth that’s supposed to mean” she said to the room in general.
John peeled off the remains of his jacket and stuffed it into the bin liner. “Nah, you’re alright. I’ll get one from M&S or somewhere.”
“Your daughter has the largest adenoids of any child I have ever seen. She has sleep apnoea and every time she lies down and sleeps, they swell and close over. When her blood oxygen levels drops, she automatically wakes screaming. They have to go, and the tonsils, and they have to go now”.
John knew he was being deliberately provocative and that he would have to live with the consequences, but screw it, Sherlock spent his entire existence aggravating all around him, it was good to give him a taste of his own medicine every now and again.
His absolute favourite way for John to call him ‘love’, though was in that deep, urgent tone, whispered into his ear:
He hears a car pull up outside and resists the urge to rush to the window to watch Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson leave. Instead, John makes himself wait until the venue to see him. Only a few moments later he hears the soft hum of the expensive car taking off again. He only has another couple of minutes before his own car arrives. John pins his medal ribbon to his left pectoral, picks up her photo and heads to the living room.
As he got dressed, Sherlock reviewed the results of his latest experiment. He had not intended to expose John to his full nakedness for quite some time, but in designing the experiment he had struggled with how to contrive such a situation and he had decided to seize the opportunity when it had presented itself.
Without warning he lifted his head and looked down at the man he loved so much. He wanted to consume him. Removing his own trousers he pulled Sherlock to the edge of the bed, holding his legs up and using his own pre-come as lubrication, slowly pushed inside him, tight up to the balls. He carefully leaned over Sherlock who gazed up at him and throatily John drawled “Mine”.
They knew that the banker was here tonight, somewhere in the throng. Sherlock wanted to see him and observe his interactions to gauge if his suspicions that Sir Phillip was the head of a money laundering network were correct. Many of the heads of state requiring such services were here tonight, and Sherlock needed to know if Sir Phillip would make contact with any of them.
John laughed “if I understand you correctly, you are saying that we are but you think it’s too soon to tell anyone?” Sherlock beamed.
Over the next three months, John began the process of registering them as foster carers. He took a more regular rota at the clinic to guarantee a stable income but still only worked part time. They talked to Mrs. Hudson, who was delighted by the idea, and painted John’s old room in warm, neutral colours and invested in a new bed, curtains and wardrobe.
Sherlock humphed and turned onto his side, the sofa creaking at his wild movements. He pulled his knees to his chest and dragged his long-suffering dressing gown tightly around himself, unconsciously drawing his arms around in a poor imitation of a hug.
“Mycroft, Yes. You knew? Excellent. How long? Yes, she is. No, with me. I agree. Well, I had thought to… yes that was the plan but there has been a… change. Oh for God’s sake Mycroft!”
“Professor Fitzgerald, I already know the Hoard was then never seen again. What happened after that?”
Moments later, Harry pops her head through the door and gives Mycroft a sharp nod before hurrying to take her seat at the front next to Molly, who gives her a warm smile. The notes of
The crowd rose to their feet, clapping and shouting, whistling and stomping their feet as John and Eva made their way through the tables to the stage. The Mayor presented John with a large, ornate key, representing the freedom of the city of London he had been granted. He went to shake hands with the woman but was startled by a hug before being directed to the podium and its microphone.
He mopes from room to room, unable to find anything remotely interesting and considers calling Lestrade before realising that, at 8.30 on a Friday evening, Lestrade will have called it a day and gone home. Resolve fading, he wilts back onto the sofa and back into the John-filled rooms of his Mind Palace.
John filled the kettle, took down the tea and cups and laid a tray. All the time, he felt Sherlock quivering at his side. Mycroft was carefully examining his polished brogues. John filled the teapot and brought the tray to his side table and was just about to take his considerable courage in his hands and ask what was actually going on, when Mycroft pre-empted him:
John reached up and in front of twenty flashing cameras and a crowd of two thousand people, he brought Sherlock’s lips down to his own and kissed him.
He never took it for granted, never having expected to be someone’s actual 'love'. Every single time Sherlock heard it, he felt the warmth spread from throughout his stomach and chest. He was particularly partial to a tipsy John coming home after a few pints with Lestrade, draping himself around Sherlock’s neck and grinning:
The realisation had come as a shock but the feelings had not been easily dismissed, intensifying until every action, every smile, every held gaze and every unexpected touch of fingers as they passed each other tea made John’s gut clench. For god sakes, he had been practically hard this morning just watching the man play the sodding violin.
John glances at Sherlock, flashing a warning eyebrow “Well, I was just observing that you ate well at lunch. Had roast beef with gravy and all the trimmings followed by apple pie and cream for dessert. Most likely eaten here in the college dining room. You did not eat alone. You were with a student, a young lady, although you are in a relationship. You find her attractive but have no intention of pursuing her. You were actively involved in the ‘Yes’ campaign in 2015 for gay marriage rights. You took part in the celebrations after the referendum was passed. You are in the middle of a three year study but have realised it will take at least five years. You have concerns your funding will not be extended.”
John grunted and returned to his reading. Sherlock returned to his sulking. He really was at a loss as to what to do, which only compounded his frustration. The constant fluttering in his stomach every time John entered a room or, worse again, a crime scene was exhausting. As was the distraction he created. Sherlock had found himself staring at John at the most inopportune moments, captivated by the way the man stood or moved, or the way his nose twitched when he was cross. It was untenable and Sherlock had not the first idea what he was supposed to do about it.
In the gentleness of the dark, Sherlock hears John draw in a sharp breath, only to sigh it out again. The silence settles until John takes another deep breath. This time he asks again. “Would you like to have a child of your own?”
John steps back to watch, glorying in seeing the sleekly muscled skin emerge from the mundane pyjama bottoms and old grey T-shirt. He has two particular favourite parts to this process, firstly the reveal of Sherlock’s broad, smooth shoulders and then the sight of Sherlock’s rounded, soft arse. He growls in appreciation as both are unveiled for him.
Inside the cabbies, Mary tilted her head at John’s small smile “Oh I see, you think I won’t do it. You think that my feelings for you will stop me from shooting you. Really, John, that just goes to show how little you really know me after all”
“Thank you to My- to my brother-in-law, for all his help in organising today. Mycroft you made it very special. Please all stay and enjoy yourselves, but it’s been a long day and Sherlock and I,” he squeezes Sherlock’s hand, “are off home.”
With John keeping watch, the pair followed the garden fence down to the shed. The door was padlocked and it took Sherlock over a minute to pick the lock. Once inside, the shed was pitch black.
Silence lays across the room as everyone contemplates the sacrifices and loss both men have endured since they met.
“I’m sorry? Sherlock Holmes is running errands for someone now? I never thought I’d see the day.” Michael tipped his head and gave Sherlock a once-over. “Alright, you. Upstairs. On the couch.” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, then turned and yelled to his uncle, “We need tea, Jacob, upstairs. It's for Sherlock.”
He finds he has to pull back, sometimes. He makes decisions about what she should wear, or play with, or which stories to read at bedtime. In these moments, Sherlock has to remind himself not to get too close but knows he will always be a part of her life. He had whispered that commitment in a tiny, sleepy ear when she was less than three weeks old. He will always watch over her, keep her safe and do whatever he can to make her happy.
“We need to see Lestrade at some point today, provide our statements for the theft yesterday. I had also planned to do some research into diamonds. I became aware of some rather serious gaps in my knowledge when we were in the bank and I wish to rectify that immediately. Did you have plans?”
“She invited me to come tonight John. I have been at all the presentations but didn’t want to upset you or detract from your big occasions, but I was there. Eva found me in Manchester, said she knew me instantly from your descriptions. From the pictures”.
“Thank you for your time, Professor. I shall be in touch should I need any further information. Come on John.”
As it turned out, he didn’t get the chance. His long day, a big dinner and an undemanding husband meant that John fell asleep on the bed and was awoken the next morning by the sound of Sherlock showering. From the state of their bed, John could tell Sherlock had not joined him.
Just being here, surrounded by John’s things, scent and image was bringing Sherlock calm. He missed his husband, even though he had only been gone for a day. Sherlock lowered his hand to his pyjama bottoms, half-heartedly stroked himself through the cotton as he watched the John in the frames grin at him. Getting harder now, he slipped his hand inside, very slowly stroking himself from base to slit, ending each stroke with a feather light touch of his fingertips on his glans.
There is a gentle rustle of a suit jacket being put on and a deliberately muffled click of the living room door being closed.
John hesitated. He wasn’t sure if this was ok, whether he was crossing a line. It was only talking after all, he decided, and he felt the need to try, to do anything that he could.
Removing his dressing gown to free up his arms and kneeling on a towel at the end of the bath, Sherlock began to systematically massage John’s shoulders, his neck, down the shoulder blades and his biceps, taking great care to keep his movements firm and quick.
Sherlock was in the bathroom when John returned to the flat. Much to John’s surprise the kitchen table had been cleared of all the experiments and even seemed to have been cleaned. Humming to himself, he started putting away the shopping, lining up the ingredients for dinner on the counter next to the cooker. He organised them by order of use, like he used to with his surgical instruments. Intending to make a double batch of everything for freezing, he organised containers on the second counter.
“What are you doing sitting …. I’ve lost by bloody glasses again, do you know where they are? I need them to be able to drive into Brighton to collect my new ones. Come
John was stood in front of Sherlock now and put out his hand in invitation. God, he had missed that voice. Sherlock stood to shake his hand and as he did, his face became fully illuminated and John was able to see the scar that ran down the right hand side of Sherlock’s extraordinary face, from above his eyebrow down to his jaw line, an angry, red mark.
John recovers the second file he had hidden upstairs in their old room. He had buried it deep in the pile of clean bed linen, secure in the knowledge that Sherlock had, and never would, change their sheets. Kettle on, he outlines the Case of the Ballytoohin Hoard with pages littered all over the kitchen table.
“To Mrs. Hudson for her miracle of a wedding cake, thank you. He raises his glass in a toast as Martha blushes at the round of applause.
“It’s only the antibiotics, love. They make the urine red. Mine is the same. I’m so sorry, I should have warned you.”
What he does is step in, his full body pressing into Sherlock as his left hand slowly traces down Sherlock’s stomach, hip and thigh until John reaches his hard dick, and gives it just one long slow slide upwards to appreciate the heat, girth and length of the man. John buries his nose in the back of Sherlock’s neck inhaling his citrusy aftershave and the intoxicating scent of his skin.
“Is this something you have ever wanted?” John asks,his hand gesturing at all the children playing in front of them. “Kids, I mean.”
Sherlock is sat on their bed, staring out of the window, straight-backed, with his hands in his lap. They have never had this conversation. Events overtook them somewhat and there was never a right time. It seems that now is the time, right or not. John sits on the edge of the bed next to Sherlock, close but not touching him and lays his hand, palm up in the space between them. Sherlock looks at it, sighs and takes it. They sit in silence for a moment.
She had explained that she had only been seeing Mark Willis for two weeks and in that time they had been out five times. Jade confirmed that she had not been to the flat, had even declined an invitation to visit the previous week “More interested in her work” she said “Had a lot to get done the next day, wanted to be fresh”. Jade had liked Mark but wasn’t looking for anything serious “I have my career to link about, I’m certainly not looking to settle down”.
“For ending a relationship. If you count us kissing in the shed as the beginning, we lasted precisely 14 hours and 24 minutes”.
The speeding police car came to a skidding halt in the middle of the car park outside the cabbies and Sherlock climbed out before the vehicle had even stopped moving. Billy was stood eight feet back from the office, just out of the line of sight of the window, watching. He put out his arm to stop Sherlock who was running frantically towards him.
“Talk to him” the neurologist had urged “touch him, play music and bring him things he likes to smell. It can all help”.
The car lurched to a stop outside 221 Baker Street and Sherlock rushed to the door. It was already ajar. Silently he crept in, glancing up the stairs to his own flat but heading for Mrs. Hudson’s door. He heard a male voice, Mrs Hudson crying and begging then a man laughing. Sherlock looked around for some sort of weapon, finding an umbrella drying in a stand.
Sherlock surged forwards, crowding up into John, eyes roaming over his chest and shoulders. He slid his hands over John’s hips and down to his exquisitely tailored arse. Squeezing with both hands, he pulled them even more tightly together before placing a single, soft kiss on John’s lips.
His idiotic smiling at vegetables had drawn the attention of the assistant. Her purple hair, green and red tattoo and silver piercings meant she fitted right in. Abruptly, John considered that his inane behaviour may suggest he was
“I have a.. a sense that things may be changing for you very soon. You have been through so much already and I need you to know that I understand. I have faced my own challenges, some not so different from yours. I survived them and so will you, my beautiful boy”.
“Sherlock, I need to empty the compost bucket of all these peelings and bring up some rosemary for the stuffing, will you help me please”.
interested in the food. He had recovered enough cucumbers from people in A and E to know some customers must have very different reasons for visiting the upmarket shop.
Lestrade's rant about TV police shows is one of my own favourites. I love all sorts of detective stories but it really annoys me when characters tell the police they don't want to talk to them or to just to go away and the police do. Then someone else gets murdered!
“Ah Lestrade, I was just about to call you. There has been an intruder at 221 and I need you to apprehend ……. Yes, I did, Billy texted me….. yes of course, but who….. thank you, yes I will be there as soon as I can”.
Sherlock began to move his hand more quickly and John followed suit, matching his movements closely to Sherlock’s rhythm. The keening deepened to a growl and with his head bent so far back that John could see the blood pumping in the veins of his neck Sherlock came, shuddering and pushing himself back onto John. John took this as his cue and began to pump faster into Sherlock, his legs shaking and his arms clutching at Sherlock’s bent leg convulsively until he too, came.
Michael pulled out three different pairs of underwear and spread them across the top of the display’s glass counter. There were cotton boxer briefs, followed by much looser silk boxers. The final option were Hugo Boss small, finely ribbed, cotton briefs. In contrast with the first two options, both available in sensible and practical black or navy, these came in a variety of vibrant colours. John ran his hand over all three choices, enjoying the slip of the silk and the softness of the cotton boxers.
John looked at his daughter. It was the first time they had been alone together since he had walked out this morning and left her on her own. He crossed one leg over the other, resting his ankle on the opposite knee and propping his baby up facing him.
Sherlock spent the two days before their departure learning all he could about the case. He rapidly discovered that there was very little about it online which, apparently, was why John chose it as his case. He turned his attention instead to learning the Irish language.
scared and did the only thing she could to show it, cry. This time, the cries were loud and persistent, coming in waves as only the cries of a new born can, becoming more high-pitched and louder with every moment.
Emelia Holmes-Watson was her father’s daughter. Consequently, she was sufficiently comfortable with showing her feelings, even for a teenager, to lean over and kiss her Papa’s forehead in relief that he was home at last. She also knew enough not to make a fuss over him or launch into an over sentimental speech.
Sherlock was holding onto the edge of the coffee table now, trying to push his dick in and out of John’s pumping hand. He threw his head back with a pleading “John!” and the blond man was behind him, shoving his dick inside Sherlock as far and fast as he could. Sherlock arched into John who gripped him by the hips tightly, digging his fingers in to hold him still as he fucked him hard and fast.
“I didn’t say anything. Pompous arse was just trying to get a rise out of me, but I realised I didn’t know the answer and I hate not knowing so-”
“Yeah, but, don’t you? I mean, you’re a bloke.” John nodded vigorously in approval of Greg’s deduction, ”and
John badly needed to finish what they had started. He took Sherlock by the hand and pulled at him to get out of the bed. They snuck out of the bedroom, leaving the door just a fraction ajar and once in the safety of the living room. John lunged at Sherlock, kissing and stroking any part of him he could lay his hands on.
“Yeah.” John was too busy trying to parse Michael’s last statement. Close for a while, not so much now, but still mat…. Oh! God he was an idiot. Sherlock and Michael had… had they? What about the whole ‘married to my work’ speech? Maybe it was just him? Or maybe John had misunderstood Michael? A glimmer of light appeared in John’s mind. The wasted hours spent lusting after his new flatmate despite his best efforts to push it away, ignore it. What if there was hope? What if …
This gets John’s attention. He pulls his hand away and sits up, legs crossed under the sheets, frowning down at Sherlock.
“God, I’m sooo glad that day is over” she said to neither father in particular “I swear my maths teacher is getting more stupid by the day and lets not even mention the sub we had for French. He gave out 3 detentions in 10 minutes. Oh and Katy wants to know if it’s OK for her to call over with her Dad this evening and Auntie Molly said she is going to email me the pdf of that book she was telling me about”.
Slipping in the door, Mycroft takes his seat at the small piano he has arranged for the venue and scans the room critically. Despite his reservations, he can see why the room suits the occasion so perfectly. He alone understands what happened in this building and what exactly Sherlock means by his statement ‘We arrived here separately and left together’. More to the point the room is deeply masculine, all glowing cherry wood, soft lighting and, of course, books. They have created a dais at the top of the room where the marriage vows will be exchanged, wall to ceiling books forming a backdrop. He checks the minimalist cream and green flower arrangements and settles his hands in his lap, ready for his cue.
Bloody Hell Watson, what is wrong with you? John berated himself as he walked down the busy streets to the clinic. You utter coward. How long are you going to keep avoiding the subject, hmm? Stopping to wait for a pedestrian crossing to turn green, John sighed out loud. He had been coping with his feelings for Sherlock for months now and nothing was getting any better, any easier. He had come to the startling realisation that he fancied Sherlock one Saturday morning as the other man had leaned over his desk tapping at his lap top and moving from one set of papers to another. Sherlock had been dressed in one of his impeccable suits at the time and all John could do was look at his arse. That delectable arse that he now longed to reach out and squeeze.
lies!” but he had already come to accept that he had never really loved Mary, that she had only ever been a suture to keep his broken, oozing heart together when Sherlock jumped and died.
“Over react, over react! How would you like it if I walked in to a, a crime scene and started talking about your penis?”
Doing as he was told, Sherlock was overjoyed when John lay down next to him, wrapping his arm across his chest, pulled the blanket over them and began to gently kiss Sherlock’s hair, fingers and lips.
They laughed over dinner and squabbled over the physics homework, Emelia determined she knew better than either father despite their respective science degrees. John looked at Sherlock pointedly, a nod of his head clearly indicating “That’s your doing, you know”. Sherlock changed into his pyjamas and dressing gown and took up residence on the sofa while the other two cleared up the kitchen, the disagreement easing into gentle banter. Emelia sat and held her Papa’s hand as they snuggled up under the new blanket to watch crap telly until she was packed off to bed by her Dad.
“I didn’t know. I had my suspicions, but I didn’t know. Is this your first time? Please Sherlock, tell me the truth?”
They both cry out and John holds still for a long moment, drawing deep breaths and listening to Sherlock panting. Sherlock grinds back on him eagerly.
John found Sherlock still stretched out on the sofa when he returned home, the room half dark and three cups of cold tea lined up on the coffee table. At least he’s dressed, thought John. The pyjamas would only make this conversation even harder.
“Well, yeah there is that, but more importantly that you are a complete numpty and need to have a proper conversation with Sherlock about all this.”
“Of course, text her there. Ask Greg to bring some tea bags”. After the first week, John had brought mugs and a kettle to the hospital room, because the hospital tea was going to kill him faster than anything else. “Got much homework love?”
“Mother is a heroin addict. She has refused to give up the child for adoption but has agreed to foster care. The baby will most likely be born addicted, John and may have other problems.”
Sherlock gently followed the lines radiating out from the badly healed wound where they knotted and curved and drew the undamaged skin in towards the epicentre of the scar where the bullet had entered.
“What the fuck took you so long to get a packet of paracetamol and some tissues?” asked a bunged-up John from under the duvet, sneezing as he pulled himself up to lean on the headboard.
“Security, John. My being married is not something we wish a considerable number of people to know. A friend of mine suggested this location and it seemed rude to decline. That,” he turned to address Sherlock, “is why you couldn’t know of the event before now. Certain precautions had to be put into place. My apologies. Now, if you don’t mind, I would rather like to get on with the matter at hand. Anthea, shall we?” If he didn’t know better, John would have thought he saw a sight hint of nerves.
John climbed on to the bed and wrapped himself around Sherlock, warming their chilled skin. Sherlock seemed to be happy just to be in John’s arms and was stroking and petting his denser, more muscular body, drifting a gentle hand along John’s back, his torso, thighs and forearms.
“God, I’m sooo glad that day is over” she said to neither father in particular “I swear my maths teacher is getting more stupid by the day and lets not even mention the sub we had for French. He gave out 3 detentions in 10 minutes. Oh and Katy wants to know if it’s OK for her to call over with her Dad this evening and Auntie Clara said she is going to email me the pdf of that book she was telling me about”.
A small knock of the door and Mrs. Hudson peeks around the corner, a cup of tea proceeding her as a peace offering.
“Then when you had finally given in and begged, I would sink all the way down, take in every inch of you, wrap you up in myself and truly have you. I would move slowly at first and then speed up, bringing you closer and closer, never taking my eyes off you as you arch up and press into me”.
John approached the body, already emptying his mind of the information from Lestrade, Anderson and Sherlock, ready to look at the situation from a fresh perspective. He only glanced at the man’s face for a fraction of a second, assessing his hands and clothes first. He frowned slightly at the expensive watch, vaguely remembering having seen one like it before somewhere. He was about to say as much to Sherlock when he returned his gaze to the victim’s face.
Everything had gone to plan. The late June weather had been kind to them and they had been able to hold the ceremony outside in the garden after all, much to Sherlock’s delight. The white chairs had been set up on the patio facing the large windows into the back of the house and a marquee filled the lawn. It was agreed to keep the guest list small, John in particular wanting to ring the changes from his first wedding.
John was trying to bring Lestrade back to consciousness without success. He instructed the officers to call an ambulance and monitored Greg’s pulse and breathing. Sherlock leaned over, and John looked up, worried.
John and Sherlock had wondered the same thing. John had decided it didn’t matter if she was his or not but Sherlock had gone ahead and done a DNA test anyway behind his back. He had presented the results to John in a plain white envelope but the look on Sherlock’s face was one John had never seen before. The simple letter had confirmed Charlotte was most definitely John’s daughter. “I told you it didn’t matter” he had said “It will do one day” Sherlock had responded simply. He had been right.
John gaped. He tried to pull a sentence together in his head but nothing happened, so he just stood and stared at Sherlock in horror. He thought I was being sarcastic, finally filtered through to his conscious mind, he doesn’t think it’s true. Then an idea popped into his head. Oh, Sherlock Holmes was not the only genius in this flat.
forgiveness. Surely it should be the other way around? He was about to say as much when John leaned in again and kissed him.
Back down in the main shop, John pondered the selection of beautiful fabrics laid out. None of them were priced and Michael guided him through the selection process. Once they had settled on a shade of blue, John was brought linen, wool and silk/wool blends of every shade imaginable. He selected a shade just lighter than navy with a hint of dark green in the silk that caught the light as the fabric flexed and moved.They paired it with an ivory shirt and two different ties, one aubergine and the other a rich gold.
“Still sore when it rains, but could be worse. We got away very lightly”. Violet looked pointedly at Martha “Even if we are still dealing with the ramifications”.
Secrets, however, he agreed were terrible. On their wedding day, both had promised each other to not keep any secrets. Of course, everyone present had known they were referring to Reichenbach but no-one mentioned it.
The two exhausted fathers crept carefully past their eight week old daughter sleeping in her Moses basket in their bedroom and slinked into bed. John had been up all the previous night with Emilia and most of the day too as Sherlock had been working. It was Sherlock’s turn to do the night feed and John lay his head on the cool pillow gratefully. His exhausted mind whirred, travelling in six directions all at once. If he could just get four hours sleep straight be might just escape permanent brain damage.
Sherlock never gets the chance to answer his question. Rosie makes a sudden lunge for the bucket, clasping it to her chest with a victorious shout of “Mine!”. The little boy next to her makes a grab to pull it back. Not willing to give up her treasure without a fight, Rosie raises the bucket above her head. At the exact same moment, Sherlock and John rise to their feet, voices raised.
“Me? And Sherlock? Sherlock Holmes? He can barely take care of himself let alone a child. Don’t be daft, Sue, you know the life we lead. Anyway, I’m knocking on a bit, aren’t I?”
“Mycroft, are you ready? Dominic is here to begin proceedings.” A young man followed her into the room and took up his place in front of the window, book in hand. Mycroft stood in front of him, slightly to the right.
Risking another attempt at opening his eyes again, it only confirmed his conclusion from the data that he had already collected. The bed was empty. His body vibrated with need and there was nothing he could do to moderate this addiction, no claims here of being in control of it. Sherlock wrapped himself in a sheet and went in search of a fix.
Sleepily, John struggles to keep his hand moving as Sherlock's bottom gradually stops undulating and their breathing deepens. They fall asleep curled tight into one another, John’s hand holding Sherlock loosely, his own cock nestled into the curve of Sherlock’s arse.
Sherlock was desperately trying to move upwards, towards the surface, to breathe. The more he tried, the thicker the nothingness around him became, morphing from air, to water to treacle. It was exhausting. He was panting, recovering from his last effort when the rumbling noise came again, louder this time, closer. Sherlock listened intently trying to work out what the sound was. He surged up again, determined, and followed the sound.
The victim was lying on the floor, flat on his back on his bedroom carpet, head turned to the right. He was between the bed and the French doors leading to a small balcony, the windows covered in a voile curtain. There was no blood and no evidence of any disturbance in the flat.
That night, an exhausted John was sat in his chair feeding Charlotte her last bottle of the day. Once they had been fully interviewed and John’s SIG had been taken into police custody, Lestrade had dropped them home. The man who had been trying to abduct Charlotte was being questioned and Sherlock was awaiting a call to tell him the man’s identity and how he and Mary had been linked.
They pushed through the swing doors into the high support neonatal unit. There were four incubators, all occupied by tiny babies. Sue brought them to the one closest to the window. There lay a delicate baby girl, dressed in a pink vest and hospital issue pink hat. She was sleeping, her tiny hands starfished above her head, her face turned to the left. The midwife smiled at them and when Sue introduced them as Dr. Watson and Mr Holmes, immediately began to give John the run down on her treatment.
“Sherlock, do you remember what I said to you yesterday? Just before I left, about all the things I want from you? I did mean it, you idiot. Ok, so breaking my thumb was not ideal but it was an accident, I know you didn’t mean to hurt me. The only reason I didn’t want you at the hospital is because I knew what a nightmare it was going to be and let’s be honest, you’re not the best at waiting around are you? Your text arrived while I was being treated. I forgot about it – they have me pumped full of painkillers. I’m sorry, I should have known you were worried. Forgive me?”
That gave him plenty of time for a hot shower, three more mugs of tea, ordering in dinner and reviewing his wardrobe for something suitable to wear tomorrow. In the end, he settled on his dark blue suit; if nothing else that might cheer Sherlock up. He spent the entire time running possibilities through his mind as to who Mycroft might indeed by marrying. He had absolutely no idea where on the sexuality spectrum his brother-in-law sat. If a gun had been put to his head, he would have said gay or, more likely, asexual.
“Peeease, ice-ream?” Sherlock has to concentrate on not smiling. If it was up to him he would give her the ice cream, but John has said she has been getting too many sweet things lately and, after all, she is John’s daughter.
Today, however, he had found himself standing in front of his wardrobe, still damp and with water dripping from his hair onto his naked body, racked with indecision. He was trying to work out what John would like to see him wearing. Then he was trying to understand why that mattered.
“I have occasionally wondered what it might be like to be a parent.” Unflinchingly he continued, “When you and Mary were expecting, I gave it some thought. Of course, at the time I was single so it was irrelevant and even more so in recent years. You and I are hardly about to have a baby are we?”
Inside the car, as it loops around the one way system again, Sherlock is silent. He fixes Mrs. Hudson with a stare. Then a small smile creeps over his face as he leans over and pulls her into a tight hug.
was why he had never attempted this before. His feelings for John have been unwavering for years but he had long ago decided that it was better to love John from afar and keep him in his life than to act on it. It is better to have John’s friendship than to ignite what they have and then stand back and watch it torch them both alive.
"Yes." Sherlock approached the pair, tea in hand for John. "He's asleep. Here, let me take him". John handed over the tiny, warm bundle, aiming the pup's nose for Sherlock's armpit, just the way the dog had settled on him. Instantly, the dog began to sniffle and whimper again.
Once home, John began to cook and Sherlock sat at the kitchen table working on his latest experiment to measure the rates of decay of various fruits. He had begun with apricots.
Andrea pushed open the gilt door closest to them and they made their way into a small but beautiful room. It had a large arched window at the far end, overlooking the palace gardens, light reflecting off the row of silver candelabras lined up along the wooden table that ran the length of the room. The walls were decorated by huge landscapes, framed in gold and the carpet was more of the luxurious claret carpet. In front of the window were lined up eight gold gilt chairs, four on each side with a space between them.
No, it’s all Rosie’s doing. It’s almost as if she has inherited the twin characteristics of stubbornness and determination from somewhere.
“Yes, John I wish to conduct an experiment into how many different ways, and in doing so establish a hierarchy of effectiveness, I can bring you to orgasm”.
“Indeed,” Eoin flashes a grin at John and slaps his hands together in glee, “The Ballytoohin Hoard!”
Shifting Charlotte to hold her in the crook of his left arm, Sherlock looked up at Lestrade, mouth open to speak. He was brought up short by the sight of Lestrade and Mrs Hudson both beaming at him, faces lit up like the Oxford Street Christmas lights.
The violin music floated from the portable speaker on their desk and filled the flat with music. When Sherlock reappeared, his nose creasing at the top in puzzlement, John offered his hand;
He was derailed by John reaching back and pushing off his red pants and dropping them to the floor. Sparks of pleasure and lust coursed through him as John brought their bare cocks together in his hand, just holding, not moving.
Currently he is the youngest professor in the university, although not the youngest ever. He was a child prodigy, entering his undergraduate studies at fifteen and becoming Professor three years ago at the age of 30. He is an active participant in his archaeology studies. His nails indicate that he regularly attends digs. Shoes and hands suggest that despite living in the city, he regularly returns home to the country. Helps with agricultural activities, most recently putting up fencing. Despite his thinness, he has a healthy appetite and -
“Yes, indeed,” acquiesced Jacob Lindon. “If you would excuse me, Michael shall be conducting your fitting today. I have an order to place. Please, take a few moments to consider your fabric choice and he will be with you presently.”
She grinned over the bed at John who was putting together the disparate elements of this stream of consciousness. She had her hand poised over her phone, waiting for a response to give Katy and at the same time was playing with her blonde ponytail, making it swish backwards and forwards as she twisted it.
He ended the call and immediately dialled another. As he spoke he began slowly walking up and down the hallway, adding a small bounce to his step.
“You got most of that from either mine or John’s blog. However, I will concede I hate the heat, as is apparent from the fact that we are honeymooning in Ireland. My handmade shoes are the result of difficulty finding comfortable shoes that fit. How do you know about the teeth?” Sherlock focuses in on the Professor’s green eyes.
You arse, you arse, you arse. John pelted down Baker Street, away from the flat and towards Crawford Street. He turned left and weaving between the other pedestrians, headed for one of his favourite spots, Paddington Street Gardens. Until 1885, it had been used as a churchyard and remained consecrated ground. John had always found it still had a very calming atmosphere and loved to stroll amongst the formal gardens and sit and watch the kids play in the playground.
“You and I are so alike my darling, in so many ways, ways even you cannot see or know. They say the apple never falls far from the tree and you are my apple so much more than your brothers. There are things you don’t know about me Sherlock, things I did and was before I met your father”
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock. Have you any idea just how fucking sexy you are? No seriously, have you even the slightest understanding?”
He always woke from these dreams mournful and the feeling usually stayed with him at the back of his head for the rest of the day. He would tell Sherlock, of course, who would hold him and do his best to reassure John she was safe and loved, wherever she was.
Glacially slowly, John, Mycroft and Greg drifted back to full consciousness. Between them they were able to work out that they were in a small room built of stone with thin windows high up near the ceiling. Surrounding them were large pots of paint and brushes, wood and metal sheets leant up against the walls and a selection of hammers, pliers and other tools scattered around. It was clearly some kind of maintenance store room.
Sherlock turns and picks up his violin and starts to play, feigning disinterest and not wanting to see John leave, all dressed up in his new suit. As soon as John has gone, Sherlock watches him from the window then droops down onto the sofa, head in hands. After a moment he ruffles his curls in frustration and stands back up and searches the flat for a distraction, anything to take the edge off this, this, he searches for the right word before settling on yearning, yes, pointless, self-inflicted yearning.
Kettle on, he headed to his chair, only to stop in his tracks. John stood in front of the mirror over the fireplace.
John left him to it, knowing almost to the minute that it would take at least four hours and twenty five minutes for Sherlock to re-engage with him, possibly five minutes sooner with the lure of either the right sort of dim sum or the even righter sort of blow job.
Eoin shrugs, his red hair hitting off his slim shoulders. Sighing, his crosses his arms and sits back into his chair, taking a moment to think.
“You are my best friend, Redbeard”, the boy whispered, “My best friend. You are the only one that understands me, doesn’t call me names”.
Holding Sherlock up with one thigh, he rapidly undid Sherlock’s flies and yanked his trousers and underwear down, pushing the expensive fabric down to the floor with his other foot. He gripped Sherlock’s hard dick firmly and squeezed, making Sherlock groan. He moved his hand up and down rapidly, working Sherlock until pre come began to leak from his slit. Suddenly he moved away and Sherlock hit the floor in a debauched heap, his weeping dick ostentatiously displayed in his lap. John bent down and whispered “Will you do as you are told?” Sherlock gazed up and nodded vigorously.
“Bit harder, I think” offered John, encouragingly. Sherlock stared at him balefully and raised the mallet once again. He wanted to be sure that the damage pattern caused by the mallet matched the dimensions of the wound exactly. Smack. The mallet rebounded off the watermelon which remained intact.
“Ok.” John is a little flustered by this display of Sherlockian romance. “And what about you? I mean, have you ever, I mean would you like a child, or children, of your own?”
John and Sherlock exchange a puzzled glance. John, however, is always inclined to eat first and ask questions second and, after a brief trip to the bathroom, is soon tucking into his poached eggs with appreciation. Sherlock picks at his but at least drinks the coffee Mycroft puts in front of him.
“Victim is Mark Willis, 37 years old, unmarried but in a relationship, no kids. Works as a Personnel manager for an insurance company. We got the call from his boss this morning, hadn’t been able to get hold of him since Tuesday and not answering his phone, which is apparently very unusual”
Mrs. Hudson sniffs “I was very contained the last time, on account of how you lied to us all and told us you were dead and everything but, if he ever hurts you again, he’ll have me to answer to.”
Sherlock understands that what John is really asking is whether its alright to touch him now. At the beginning of their relationship, Sherlock had often come quickly and then become so over sensitised that he could not bear to touch John with his hands. Patience had sometimes tipped over into frustration and there had been a couple of rows, accusations of selfishness and apologies. They had persevered though and, to both their delight, discovered that while his hands were too sensitive, other places, most especially his mouth, were not. Sherlock has developed a serious fixation with taking John, hard and leaking, into his mouth and keeping him there for as long as possible. John considers this to be a more than acceptable resolution.
“Indeed. I now wish to establish the parameters of a new experiment. I have spent some time designing its methodology”.
Several cups of tea later and both slightly giggly from the sugar high, John decides it is time for him to give Sherlock his wedding present. He clears the rubbish from the kitchen table, showers and dresses and fetches the file.
John put his elbows on the white plastic table top and held his hands in his head. After a few moments, he gathered himself together.
“Sherlock, these are pre-prepared words. I have chosen these words with care. I love you, but then you already know that. I have loved you from the very moment you winked at me in Barts. You have saved me, body and soul, from insane, murderous masterminds, countless criminals and a professional assassin. Most of all, you have saved me from myself, from my most destructive thoughts and impulses over and over again. You have given me my life and, in front of all those we love, I pledge to give you my life from now to the end of the universe. You are my life and in return I give you mine.”
believe that you just did that!” The door of 221 Baker Street slammed shut and the stairs to Flat B creaked as John made his way up.
Mary stared at the screen in front of her, once more displaying the map she had pulled up. She cycled through the information they already had about the men’s last locations, the history of the other bomb attacks and the little useful information she had from the video, especially the stone walls. In a flash of inspiration she pressed the button on the side of the comms unit:
“Sherlock. Sherlock love, look at me.” John’s voice is low and calming, “It’s getting late. Maybe it’s time we called it a day?”
Mary watched proceedings from a camera strapped to Anthea’s shoulder as they scrambled up the steel ladders that led from the river up to the bridge and then up to the glass enclosed walkway. One team began the evacuation of tourists while the others undertook a reconnaissance of the bridge. She could hear the sirens of the police and emergency vehicles approaching by road and a helicopter, presumably circling above.
Eloise pointed to a selection of photos in silver frames lined up along a mahogany sideboard. The pictures showed herself and a taller, blonder young man arm in arm or learning their heads together. Many of the pictures were clearly taken at sporting events, sunshine making them squint into the camera, with Evan in sports kit. Behind the photos were a number of trophies, all engraved with Evan Armitage’s name. Sherlock picked up a number of the photos in turn and examined them.
The room was silent.  Sherlock had curled himself up on the sofa again, and John was sitting at the other end, trying to figure out what to do with the information he'd just been given.  He understood why Lestrade had apparently suggested Sherlock not work on the case any more; the personal connection could be turned on him by whatever solicitors K acquired.  At the same time he knew Sherlock wouldn't quit.  It suddenly occurred to him there might not be a trial at all, if Mycroft got involved.  He remembered he had threatened K if she tried to leave the country and he hadn't been joking.  "Will you let her go to trial?" he asked, breaking the silence.
“Come in very carefully, no big movements, slowly and quietly” Mycroft communicated to the closed door.
That evening Sherlock, once more dressed as a man, made his way carefully to the address he had been given. He meandered throughout the city, going far in one direction only to circle around to another suburb. Eventually he reached his destination and pushed the back door open, not making his presence known. He knew that this was a very dangerous meeting, for both of them, but when his search for the outer extremities of Moriarty’s web had led him to Sousse, he had been compelled to find his brother.
“Yeah. Business, maths, English, history. Nothing hard though, I’ll have it done in about forty five minutes” She pulled the moveable hospital tray meant for patients to eat from, lowered it and started pulling out books. John watched, enjoying the normality of it all and, not for the first time, proud of their bright, motivated daughter. He turned and smiled at Sherlock’s face to share the moment but of course got no response.
He pushed his dick imperceptibly deeper into the man beneath him, taking his time to enjoy every sensation and edging forward carefully. Never taking his eyes off Sherlock’s face he held his hands on the man’s hips, lifting his them higher as he got closer and closer to filling him. John’s fingers were clenching and flexing as he controlled the desire to dig into those hips and hold Sherlock tightly to him. Breathing deeply, he began to move back, increasing his pace steadily but carefully. Sherlock keened and gasped as he pulsed his own hand up and down his swollen dick in time to John’s movements. Speech had escaped both men at least five minutes before and John was deep in concentration, watching all the minute changes in Sherlock’s angular face, wary of signs of pain, distress of sensory overload.
John grunted in response, still trying to formulate words. The two men were then greeted by a long, drawn out whine of pain from what sounded like Mycroft Holmes and there was a pull on John’s left wrist. This time John managed to keep his eyes open long enough to see that his left wrist was indeed handcuffed to Mycroft who was leaning back to back with Greg. John too realised he was leaning back on someone, someone unmoving that he hoped was Sherlock. He grunted out his name but there was no answer.
The cab dropped him off outside a bland house on a housing estate of three hundred identical houses. He checked the knife sitting comfortably in the inside pocket of his coat and knocked on the door. If John was here, they would go in together, he thought as he waited for the door to open, or maybe John would wait around the corner with his Browning safely tucked away, ready to come and find Sherlock if he didn’t emerge from the house by the agreed time.
The third sheet is a printout from TripAdvisor with accommodation matching each of the six locations highlighted on the map, plus pictures and descriptions of each place and their star rating from Bord Fáilte, the Irish Tourist Board.
The next morning, John’s head was fixed to the pillow. He blinked hard as the light filtered in through the curtains and he groaned as he tried to move. A wave of nausea hit him, rapidly followed by The Horrors – he wasn’t sure what he had done, but he knew it wasn’t good. It had been years since John Watson had been this hungover and he was regretting the last three pints and not drinking any water when he got home. He carefully felt his way down the stairs to the bathroom. It was only once he was safely enthroned that he wondered why he had been sleeping upstairs.
“You don’t know? He didn’t tell you? You couldn’t deduce it?” John suspected he was getting to the nub of the problem.
In their living room they dance their own waltz, barely moving now, leaning into each other, holding tightly. As the music comes to an end, John tilts his face up and gently kisses away a tear from Sherlock’s jaw then wipes them from his own face.
“Let’s get those off you,” John rumbled, pulling at the t shirt Sherlock was wearing, “I need to see you, want you laid out for me.”
Sherlock studied Patrick’s face carefully. This man was telling the truth, there was no threat to him here, no family network seeking revenge. Sherlock stepped back, towards the door.
Greg and Katy arrived at 5.45 and had duly brought the tea bags. They all had a cup and while the two cousins chatted animatedly about school, eyeliner and YouTube vlogs, Greg and John went to get something to eat.
Sherlock bent close to the dead man’s suit jacket and sniffed “He had been drinking alcohol when he died but just the one, a mid-range Irish whiskey, probably Jamesons. He spilled the whiskey as he fell” Sherlock crawled on his hands and knees, looking under the bed but then going at speed towards the chest of drawers on the other side of the room. He scrabbled underneath it and retrieved a glass tumbler and sniffed it.
It is late that evening, just before they go to bed that John finally manages to force it out. Over one last cup of tea.
Just beyond the arbour and out of site of the house, the garden opened up into a large plush manicured lawn. On it were a full set of crocket hoops. At the very end of the garden was a small wooden shed.
Eloise Armitage still lived in her family home, an enormous red brick Victorian house in South Hampstead. Once two houses, they had been knocked together to make one and the already large, long gardens at the rear combined. It was obviously someone’s pride and joy. As Sherlock looked through the drawing room French doors he could see a summer house, water fountain, formal herb garden and roses as well as a Japanese garden. A brick path weaved down the length of the garden before disappearing under an ivy covered arbour surrounded by mature trees.
“I haven’t seen Jim since I was 14. He left home when he was 16, after years of doing nothing but cause trouble and pain for our family. Do you know he killed the pet cat when he was six? Just for fun. We all knew there was something not right with him and he terrorised us until he left. We never heard another word from him, just rumours that he was in London”.
Set immediately after the events of TAB, Sherlock gets to work on finding Moriarty, or whoever is using his identity.
John looked Sherlock in the eye and suddenly threw himself into the other man’s arms. “Thank you, thank you” he clung to Sherlock’s shoulder and buried his face in his chest, weeping now. The two men sat on the blood-covered floor and just held each other for a few minutes as John’s weeping peaked and subsided. When he had regained a small amount of composure, John raised his face and looked into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Congratulations, mate. It can be a rocky road being married to a Holmes but it’s well worth it. Now, tell me, how long are you two together and why all the secrecy, you bastard?”
"Joh…… " He bellowed, apparently unaware of his flatmate's arrival in the room but coming up short as John's bare feet appeared on the ground in front of him and his hands were gently prised from his ears.
Sherlock made a note to encourage John in this plan to cook more. He would have to find a way to deter him from this ridiculous fruit buying business though. Maybe blow up a banana and leave John to clear up the mess?
Pulling on his coat, they headed off down the stairs, his mind already re-running the previous locked room murders he had solved, creating an orderly list of possibilities to tick off at the crime scene. It was only in the cab that Sherlock realised he was vaguely disappointed at the disturbance to their afternoon’s plans, had been looking forward to watching John cook, he found it soothing. He had also been looking forward to the resulting food. He liked John’s food.
Coffee’s gone cold, I’ll get another then move on, need to visit the library, meet Babic at two. Maybe time to make a move now, it’s getting busy, too many people around. Getting warm. Wonder what the weather is like in London? Probably raining. I miss London, miss the smell of it. Nowhere smells like home. You’re getting sentimental.
The car was empty, save for the driver, and headed south east, past Wellington’s Arch on the corner of Hyde Park and up Constitution Hill. As it became apparent they were actually turning
Yes, time has been very kind. The exact same unruly curls, now silvery grey but no sign of thinning and worn just as long as always. His frame was a little gaunt, obvious to John despite the immaculately tailored suit. A woman leaned in now to talk to him and as she did Sherlock turned his head to nod, smile up at her and answer her question and John was astonished at the side view of the once so familiar face. The jaw line and astonishing cheekbones were still there and the gentle golden lighting of the function room’s chandeliers erased the lines that surely must be there. You look like a movie, John thought to himself, still beautiful.
That had been three years ago now and hearing John call him ‘love’ remained one of Sherlock’s most treasured and pleasurable things, which was just as well because John said it a lot:
Once more at the college front door, Sherlock moves around to help Mrs. Hudson out of the car and offers his arm, a gentle smile passing between them. Mrs. Hudson is radiant in a pale yellow dress, shoes and matching jacket. She personally feels the matching fascinator was a bit too much but Mrs. Turner had insisted it finished off the outfit.
“Do you think I am happy about it, Martha? She’s vile! The things she has done, least of all to my beautiful boy. Could you lay off ‘The Commander’ bit too when we are alone, we’ve been doing this for far too long. Speaking of which, how is the hip?”
“Afternoon, sleepyhead. We need to get a full length mirror in this flat. This one is no good. Thought i’d try it on. You’re the expert, what d’ya think?”
The waiter is studying law. That man in the coat, his wife is cheating on him, Green hat man is late for work but hates his job so much he is going to stop and…..yes, there we go, order a coffee. God, they are all so boring. How much longer? Depends on Slavzokzy and his contacts.
“Sshhh, you are alright now. I have you, you are safe, little one” me murmured in her ear and held the baby tightly to his chest, gently kissing the top of her head.
“You need you to know I understand Sherlock,” intent sparking in her own bluer eyes, “that whatever you do, whatever the future brings to our door, I am here. That I love you, no matter what. That I understand what it is to make sacrifices for those you love, to give something precious up and what that does to you”.
Greg brought Emilia and Katy home. John wanted a few minutes by himself with Sherlock and Mycroft would have her dropped back to the flat to him. He had decided he really did need to get some sleep, in a bed. Their bed.
Sherlock was indisputably happy. All the people he loved were here with him to celebrate the day he never thought would come. That John had asked him to marry him was still a bit of a shock, his acceptance instantaneous in case John changed his mind. He was profoundly relaxed and full of uncharacteristic bonhomie. Dinner was cleared and the dancing began, Sherlock and John taking centre stage for their first dance. As their waltz came to an end, Sherlock buried his face in John’s shoulder as a tear escaped, finally letting go of the vestiges of pain from the last time they prepared for a wedding waltz. Neither man spoke, they just held tight to each other.
“I hope this doesn’t take too long. I want to be back home with you” Sherlock merely raised an eyebrow.
Here we are at the end of March and the end of the story. Thank you all for reading and your lovely comments. Now onto  the April Sherlock Challenge.
It was John that let go first, breathing hard and pulling back so he could look into Sherlock’s heavy-lidded eyes.
Sherlock places his palms on John’s pectoral muscles, pressing firmly, enjoying the feeling of the nipples in the centre of his palms. This is one of his favourite things to do;  reinforcing John’s strength, the quiet power of his musculature. John’s fingers remain wrapped around his left wrist as they shuffle tight together, thigh to thigh, knee to knee, cock to cock.
“Please John, I have to. She’s mine, my flesh and blood and all I have! You can’t do this to me, you and that, that junkie sociopath you’re so fond of”. Charlotte stirred slightly at Mary’s screeching.
Reaching the last but one step, Sherlock was shaking, the sweat pouring down between his shoulder blades and temples. John stood to one side on the landing, knowing better than to make any offer of assistance. The final step resulted in a grimace of both pain and joy; he was home.
Charlotte started to panic now, tears rolling down her face. She kicked her arms and legs frantically, pushing off the blanket and knocking her cuddly rabbit up to the top of her Moses basket. Where
The group around John was getting larger and noisier until suddenly, the crowd parted like a wave and in front of him was his precious Eva, glorious in her midnight blue lace dress. She came and hugged him tightly, kissing him gently on the cheek and simultaneously taking in the four empty glasses, slightly flushed cheeks and tension behind his eyes. She squeezed his hand lightly and ordered two sparkling waters, effortlessly taking over the hand shaking, collecting of congratulations and skilful deflection of personal questions.
“S’tight.” Sherlock shook himself slightly. John was right in front of him now, understandably puzzled. “That is to say,” he cleared his throat and released a hand from his sheet and waved in John’s general direction, “Your suit. It is quite a tight fit.” Sherlock tried, but failed, not to stare at the point where the suit clung to the top of John's legs. There was a rather poorly disguised significant bulge.
That was exactly the way they spent the rest of the evening. Sherlock made tea and sat at the kitchen table watching John chop and cook, stirring things occasionally and testing the mango chutney for sweetness when asked but mostly listening to John hum as he pottered around the kitchen. Every now and again, John would lean over the table and kiss him or Sherlock would be moved to stand and go to John’s side and brush his lips gently over John’s ear or neck.
“Oh no dear, you’re not going anywhere. Did you really think that now we have you that we are just going to let you go again?”
“Hmmmm?” John is more interested in stroking Sherlock’s left ear. Sherlock catches him by the wrist and steadies John’s hand, placing it on Sherlock’s chest and holding it there with his own.
“Yes John. I wish to conduct an experiment to investigate in greater depth your position within Maslow’s hierarchy of Needs and Wants, focusing on one particular aspect of human behaviour”.
It wasn’t always blank though. Every now and again, Sherlock would see or, rather feel, an image float past him. Sometimes they were things he recognised from his Memory Palace but other times it was something new. Once he had seen Redbeard and rubbed his ears. That had been lovely. Another time he had seen a furled umbrella, which he had not enjoyed so much. Twice he had seen a beautiful girl’s face, but hadn’t recognised her.
“I am quite sure. Have you ever known me to doubt my own mind? Now, Martha, unhand me, we have a wedding to go to.”
”. For a moment he gazed into her blue eyes, red from crying and wondered if maybe he should stay here with her and let Lestrade go to John. Maybe she needed him more. It as a fracturing thought and he felt his mind twist at the idea that there might be something in the universe more important than going to John. He knew instantly that John would want him to protect Charlotte at all costs, above all things, even himself. Sherlock gazed into those eyes and tried to reach a decision, his mind flooded with conflicting thoughts and images all bombarding him at the speed of light.
“We were a couple for just over 3 years” she confirmed “but had known each other for more than 12 years. We were friends at first and I was away working in Italy for a number of years. When I returned, Mark was one of the people who contacted me first and one thing led to another”.
“She’s dead, Sherlock. I was looking her in the eye and they shot her. I thought I had done it” the tears kept coming “I’m covered in her blood”.
In a windowless room in the middle of a non-descript grey building, Anthea would have been unrecognisable to Sherlock or John. Hair pulled back into a severe bun, she was in her Army fatigues, with sand-coloured beret, the badge bearing the distinctive flame-wreathed Excalibur. Sat with her around the table were Mary Watson, Martha Hudson, Molly Hooper and Sargent Sally Donovan. None of the women were speaking and all turned as the door behind them opened. Anthea rose to her feet and saluted as Violet Holmes entered the room.
Sherlock had been particularly intrigued by the statement in the research that ‘conflict is not a relationship’s kryptonite but inevitable and healthy’. Once he had finished Googling what Kryptonite was, he concluded smugly that there was already sufficient conflict in his relationship with John and that John’s most recent offering of ‘you utter bell end, Sherlock, give Greg back his wallet’ was, in fact, a term of affection and proof of their successful communication.
While John himself washed and dressed, Sherlock curled up in his chair and thought. They were going to New Scotland Yard. Would John be intending to tell the people they knew their about the change in their relationship? Wasn’t that what people did? Made announcements? Sherlock’s mind then moved to Mycroft. He certainly didn’t need to know anyway. Although he probably already did. This thought annoyed Sherlock immensely and he was scowling when John reappeared, dressed in jeans and a blue and brown checked shirt.
“My turn?” he growled, lust taking over from the relaxation. He kissed and nipped his way along Sherlock’s jawline and down his neck and over to his right shoulder, then inwards. He moved over to the pale skin of Sherlock’s right shoulder and again kissed his way in until he reached the point where the collar bones met, that sensitive, delicate spot he had so often admired. He took a moment to kiss and lick that spot, groaning slightly until he moved down over the lightly haired chest.
“Yeah, of course.” He glanced around but knew there was nowhere to sit so he perched awkwardly on the side of the bed.
John rubbed his wrist which appeared to be mostly fine and whispered “You were yelling up a storm this time.”
John and Sherlock didn’t really speak about the DVD. It was mostly just “well” and “right” and “that’s that” and they got on with it, sitting in their own awkwardness, determined to proceed forward as normally as possible. One thing they took to heart though was to return to the familiar. To find support in one another and to be a part of the world again in the ways in which they could help.
Though they were sleeping together at night in an intimate closeness, nothing else had occurred. It was simple and peaceful and comforting. They would read in bed next to each other, change in the bathroom, reach for one another once the lights were out, and then chat in hushed tones about their day until sleep pulled them blissfully under. When Rosie would cry out at night through the monitor, they took turns attending to her and occasionally would bring her to bed to sleep between them if she was scared. Their family was solidifying.
John woke yelling from a familiar nightmare; he was drowning, being pulled down by chains. Sherlock and Mary were calling to him, but he couldn’t see them or get to them.
John checked his texts seeing one from Janine telling him a couple hours ago that Rosie was down peacefully and all was well.
Sherlock took care not to move or breath too heavily for fear it that the serenity would come crashing down around him. He didn’t know which concerned him more, that John would wake and this spell would end, or that John would wake and this spell would end and there would also be the ugly truth of having to face what this meant.
Sherlock imperceptibly sighed in relief as his hand sought out John’s unoccupied one to entwine their fingers together.  “Thank you” he whispered.
John and Sherlock retreated from the kiss, but not very far. Sherlock brought a hand up to John’s cheek and stroked it gently with his thumb.
“Yeah, I invited him but I don’t think I told you that.” John tilted his head squinting his eyes a little in the way that he did any time Sherlock made an improbable observation.
Molly held up her hands in plight. “Please don’t. I know. I know what happened. You don’t have to say anything.”
There was no great moment where they declared he was moving into it, it just happened slowly - a t shirt here, a shoe there, a hamper of clean laundry brought in and left in the corner to pull from.
Sherlock thought also of how he felt when John insisted he pursue a deeper relationship with Irene. Annoyed? Sad? He cared very much for Ms. Adler and had gone to great lengths to protect her on several occasions, but again it was different than how he felt about the other important people in his life. She intrigued him, she was his equal in many ways and had managed to befuddle him which was a difficult thing to do. There was a playfulness between them, but he couldn’t think of her the way that John wanted him too. Or, maybe he could and he would have if John wasn’t there.
“You were yelling again.” John said quietly, continuing trailing his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
They sat in silence for moments until John realized that Sherlock had begun to heave small sobs behind him.
Sherlock responded by closing the remaining distance between them, his heart in his throat as he pressed his lips into John’s.
“She’s east of us somewhere, it’s still my birthday there.” He opened Irene’s message and sure enough it wished him a Happy Birthday. He locked his phone again without replying, as was normal, and stood up.
"Fine." Emily had to be the younger daughter. It wasn't like he'd wanted to go in the room of a ten or eleven year old girl anyway; it wouldn't tell him anything.
The woman rolled her eyes. "Well, what else is there to do? Make him sleep outside? Call his old landlord and ask if the attic's empty? Give him a blanket and make him sleep on GERT-I? Lock him in the portacabin?"
Once he had positioned the wheelchair in front of the stand, he smiled up at Susan.  "Hello, Thomas," Susan said.
"It's more than that. He most likely found a lot of it painful and scary. Sometimes it felt good, but it always had menace. Sex is always all of those things. And you're both a different person and a different gender. You know what he's thinking? 'What if this is
"Yes," said Martin, feeling dread even as he did. Carolyn was the type who would ignore the weirdness of the situation and just be upset that whoever was in his body now didn't know how to fly a plane. Before he could dwell on this, John placed a mobile in his hand. Still feeling dread but knowing he couldn't put it off, he dialed Carolyn's number. Instead of ringing, it emitted a shrill noise and told him that the number was no longer in service. He ended the call and rang the number again. The same thing happened. Now even more worried, he wondered who to call instead. Douglas had left his mobile at home and Arthur had a bad habit of not charging his. Could he call Herc? Martin knew Carolyn's landline number, but he had never used it before. Herc might not even be at the house in the first place. He dialed it anyway. This time the mobile rang twice before he heard a sleepy "Hello?" Unfortunately it wasn't anyone he recognized, and certainly wasn't Herc.
The commotion was enough to bring the other pilot, Douglas, out of the plane.  "What's going on?  Can you all not get enough of Frankfurt-Hahn?"
A final confirmation that Mr. Aherne is not neglectful or emotionally absent, like the parents of so many of the victims we meet. Sherlock also wants to see how Moira reacts to a direct mention of her being in the hospital without mentioning why.
He half-hoped Sherlock wouldn't be there when he got back, and half-hoped he would.  Delaying talking to him wouldn't solve anything, but he wasn't sure if he was up for it.  This all vanished in a puff of smoke as he walked in the door and found Sherlock sitting on the sofa.  He had wrapped himself in that blue dressing gown of his, the sides enveloping his body as tightly as possible, and Hamish sat next to him.  When John shut the door, he turned his head and said, "You're home."
The plus of thinking about all this was that it made the train ride fly by, and before he knew it they were at their station and Sherlock was marching off to wherever he was going.  He didn't hail a cab; he just walked down one of the side roads purposefully.  John trailed him at a distance.  This area was not quite suburban or rural but rather something in between.  The size of the houses in the area indicated this was a wealthy district.  He texted Lestrade as he walked, telling him what he could figure out of his surroundings.
"Thank you," John said as he took the paper, folded it, and put it into his pocket.  "You've been a great help."
"Dr. Martin," she corrected him.  "You knew that, though.  Remember all those times you went to the clinic with me after school?  I wondered if you'd be a doctor yourself, since you always seemed so interested in my medical books."
"Because until a few days ago I had no idea who this person was.  I can talk about what happened when we went to her house, but other than that I can't say much.  Even so, if for some reason they want me to testify I will."
“I could always tell them you helped at the clinic with the little ones.  Weren't you my best helper?” Dr. Martin looked pointedly at John.
"Jennifer's father, the one who wants to speak to us, Michael Ogbeide.  He's also an immigrant.  The records said he came here from Sierra Leone as a teenager," he said with satisfaction.
"If no victim talks there aren't going to be any, obviously." John turned in the chair and, with a sinking feeling, spotted that "happy day, I have a case now!" look in Sherlock's eyes. "And no, they're not going to call you. So don't start thinking about it."
"They said it was too sensitive a matter. You know that you can be…abrasive…" He trailed off, unable to continue his line of thought.
"Drop the subject."  He sounded so firm that John knew to push the issue would probably result in disaster.
"No further questions," Lou said.  John suspected they could have gotten far more out of Jennifer, but with twelve other victims testifying it was clearly easier on her if her testimony was short.
Sherlock knows at this point he is going to get involved in the case, even if he has to sneak around.  His brief glee isn't from a case or even from thinking of outsmarting the Yard - it's only about the idea of finding this person and putting them in jail.
"She liked to touch me."  Moira brought Brownie up so he half covered her face.  "Sometimes She just wanted to kiss me.  On the lips, with Her tongue.  Other times She wanted to touch me between my legs.  Sometimes She..." She brought Brownie down and hung her head.  "She'd stick fingers in me.  In my bum or in my, um, vagina.  Or lick me there."
"Of course you can.  If something isn't right there I'd want to know about it.  I'll take you boys in."  The woman led them through the door and towards the door of the ground floor flat.  She selected one of a ring of keys and opened the door.  "Hello?" she called as she stepped through the door.  "It's the landlady, Mrs. Murray."  No one responded, but neither John nor Sherlock seemed surprised by this.  They walked in after her.
Dr. Arthur had the grace to blush as he said:  "No, I'm sorry, that didn't occur to me.  It was hard to tell if he was truly out of sorts or just had poor English skills."  He sounded dismissive, and John figured he could add "prejudiced" to his mental list of traits of Dr. Arthur.
He forced himself to smile, although he didn't find it funny. "Yes, I know you're John Watson. But who am I?"
"French, German, Russian, Latin, and some ancient Greek and modern Czech."  Sherlock made it sound like it was the equivalent of reading a picture book.  "Mycroft is the one with the gift for languages."
Sherlock seemed to pale even more.  "I didn't know how to hug.  I couldn't tell where the arms went.  She said She'd teach me that.  So we'd hug every day.  Sitting down sometimes.  And She kept teaching me how to kiss.  Then one day She said it was hot since it was the summer.  So She asked me if it was okay if She took off Her clothes.  I said yes and She did.  Then She asked me if I was hot and I was.  She said it was okay if I took off my clothes because She was a doctor and I didn't have anything She hadn't seen before.  So I took off everything but my pants."
"And I can show you all my toys. I don't have any bees though, not stuffed ones. I have an insect book though."
"Four steps, then."  John felt his mobile vibrate in his pocket.  Since the kettle had boiled, he went back into the kitchen and pulled it out once he had his back to Sherlock.  It was a text message from Mycroft, of all people.
“I wasn't trying to do anything.  He'd been begging for it before, just like you used to, and he suddenly changed his mind.  I took hold of his arm so he wouldn't try to leave and he pulled away.  I pulled him back and...”  She made a vague gesture with her hand, like it was something that couldn't be helped.  “He heard it snap and he went right off to the clinic.  He knew that place very well.”  That sinister smile remained on her face.  “His mother was always asking if he was behaving himself, just like yours.  Of course he was.  He's a sad little boy but he's usually a good boy.”
Mr. Aherne actually laughed, although it seemed driven by nerves.  "No, they don't.  Dierdre's got the sewing room as her room.  It's tiny but she doesn't mind at all.  She'd rather play where everyone else is anyway.  Moira likes to be by herself at times."
“I suppose you need to know what happened after that,”  Christine said as soon as her brother stopped talking.  “Can – can we do that at another time?  This is enough.  Now, I mean.”  Her body shook along with her voice.
John glanced back at the dock for the first time in days, and found K sitting there with a look of shock.  Every time he'd seen her before, she looked calm and composed, almost smug.  Now she looked like she was finally concerned about being convicted.
"Of course."  He took the tube of wrapping paper and tore off a large section of it.  Despite not having measured it, it still fit the gift.
"Your captain appears to have suffered a head injury or ingested a hallucinogen.  He won't do the walk around and insists he is Sherlock Holmes."
"A bottle of Coke.  I bought them a lot in London because they were harder to find back home."  The crowd laughed.
"I wouldn't make something like that up. Wouldn't be smart enough to come up with it. Do you have a phone I can use to ring my boss? She's going to be mad enough now."
"I never went in there after three in the afternoon.  All the repairs are done after that, and it's my job to supervise those."
"That's what you meant, when you said that people always assume," John said as he sat down again.  "At the time I knew nothing about K, didn't even have an initial, and I still must have called her a he."  He couldn't make himself call her "Dr. Martin," didn't want to give her the respect of the title, and calling her by first name was little better, so he stuck with the initial.
The small bathroom had an equally small mirror perched over the sink.  His head - or at least the head of someone - barely came up to the bottom.  His hair was now a bright flaming red and would be very curly if it wasn't cut short; he now had green/hazel eyes.  And at least an entire face full of freckles.  He looked down and saw he now wore pajamas with airplane patterns on them.  A quick check of the rest of the bathroom revealed nothing helpful, so Sherlock stepped back into the hotel room.
