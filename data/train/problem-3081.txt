,” Dean says involuntarily. Cas’s hands linger for a moment longer—just long enough for Dean to think,
Dean’s still processing that image—an angel of the Lord with his shoes planted on the scummy tile, shoulder dampened from brushing the shower curtain—as he nods automatically.
been hurting lately. Didn’t know that was important enough to get a visit from heaven, but I wouldn’t say no to some angelic Aspercreme—“
Something besides the whiskey burns in Dean’s throat. He puts his hands on the wheel, tapping his fingers against the cheap plastic. He’s not having this conversation. “You’re right, man,” he says. “My back
More of that Ivy league bullshit. And he’d probably laugh himself silly when Dean inevitably pronounced it wrong, too. Fucker.
“I don’t know what you want me to say, man! So maybe I’m a little screwed up. Who isn’t. And my brother’s in
Cas’s touch is light, explorative. Dean watches carefully, but Cas betrays no hint of disgust, no moment of hesitation. He ghosts over the scars like they’re nothing, like they’re just another feature of landscape. His eyes never leave Dean’s face.
him to be. Needs him to take one look at Dean’s fucked up body and even more fucked up mind and regret ever dragging him out of the fucking pit.
“No,” Dean says, shaking his head. His thumbs slide up the back of Cas’s neck, and he leans down to press his lips to Cas’s ear. “Because this time, I wasn’t joking.”
Anger rises in his blood, swift and mean. Dean welcomes it. Savors it. Lets it coat his tongue like lighter fluid. Already he feels better, the ache lessening as it shifts into something harder. Yes,
His eyes are impossibly blue. There’s a slight flush to his cheeks, and his lips are very, very pink.
It takes Dean a few tries to catch his breath. Cas’s body forms a cage above his, and his pupils are blown wide and black against the blue.
He pulls the whiskey out of the paper bag. It’s the cheap kind, the kind in a plastic bottle that smells like paint fumes and tastes even worse. But it gets the job done, after beer stopped cutting it, and it doesn’t break the bank. Construction doesn’t pay much, and he’s got Ben’s college to worry about it. Or he did, before he slipped that life insurance policy into their last billing. He comforts himself that the kid’s gonna be taken care of, no matter what happens.
.” He sighs softly at the last word, eyes a little distant, like that’s the best possible thing he can think of.
Soft pressure on his jaw. Dean lets Cas cradle his face, turning him back to look at him directly. “
Cas takes a moment to respond. Carefully, he brushes a lock of hair from Dean’s forehead, trailing a knuckle down from temple to cheekbone. “Do you know that angels have long been jealous of your kind? It’s
Dean deflates, anger and fear alike draining out of him. Cas may be a clueless sonuvabitch sometimes, and he may be an Lovecraftian horror shoved into the body of an accountant, but god, Dean can never stay mad at him. “Damn it, Cas,” he says softly, “I—”
“Not quite,” says Cas. He holds out the crunchwrap, and Dean, still dumbfounded, accepts it mutely. For another minute, the fact of Castiel is still so improbable—
“I know how you see yourself, Dean. A knife with a broken hilt, built for pain and nothing else. But you’re so much
His dad used to dip, on occasion. Motel bathrooms and late night car rides when he thought the boys were asleep. Dean always thought that was dumb. If you were going to kill yourself, might as well make a show of it. And so he’d light up in the parking lot behind the high school, let girls with doe eyes and boys with bruised knuckles place slender cigarettes between his lips. He might’ve smoked a pack a day if he hadn’t come home one night to find Sam coughing on the back steps, one of Dean’s lighters clutched in his fingers.
,” and continues on southward. He kisses the swath of Dean’s hips, the curve of his stomach, and it’s impossible to be self-conscious under the all-consuming force of Dean’s
. Here, a strip mall and its parking lot drug deal. He burns each one to memory like a brand. Taco Bell. Gas station. Strip mall. Same pattern in every town, like he’s driving on one of those loops. Möbius strips, or whatever. If Sam were here, he’d know exactly what they were called, know the whole boring story behind their origin.
“Okay, Dean,” Sam takes another look at Castiel, then wanders out into the main area. He grabs a couple of books on vampires, trying to find different lore on bites, new vamp types, anything to explain what is happening to Castiel.
Dean sucks in a breath and bites his bottom lip before licking it. “Do you want my mouth?” He offers, his voice thick with lust.
The server comes out with the last course. The steak takes up two-thirds of the plate, and a baked potato with cheese, bacon, and sour cream finishes the meal. “Here we are,” the man says as he places the food in front of the two of them. He reaches under his arm and carefully removes the cork on the red wine. “This bottle is on the house, Mr. Novak. For your continued patronage of our establishment,” the server adds before Castiel can interrupt.
Dean freezes as he lifts his sandwich and lifts a brow. “I’d hate to impose or bother you,” he says, finally taking a bite.
Dean shakes his head with a weak chuckle. “Already picked that one up,” he taps his knuckles on the counter. “I was looking for something a little more… niche,” he smirks. “Maybe, Princess Asuka and the Tentacle Monster?”
Dean takes a step inside the house, looking around briefly before looking back at Castiel. “Well, it looks like you could use
Dean groans as his thrusts start to pick up speed, and he goes as deep as he can. “Fuck, you take my cock so good,” he moans as his hips jerk a bit.
“Are you going to eat now? You must be just as exhausted as me,” Sam looks at Dean, then back to the bed, then back to the table. He walks over. “Maybe we should eat before bed,” Sam pushes the books around, seeing the scratches on the table… he points at them, “Dean… who else was in this room while I was gone?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says, a pleasant smile on his face, like all the other times he’s greeted Dean.
A louder moan vibrates in Dean’s chest as he nearly shudders at the thought of Castiel’s request. His eyes flicker closed as he curls his fingers a bit, trying to figure out the angle again.
Dean grins to himself, watching Castiel interact with the other man. He looks up once he realizes he’s being addressed. “Yeah, thank you,” Dean nods with a polite smile and moves his glass to make it easier for the server to pour. He looks over at Castiel, and his smile widens.
“I’m sorry, Dean, but it didn’t. I hope I didn’t hurt you too badly.” Castiel apologizes, removing the needles and tubes from the other man’s body. “I think I have something else that will work, at least, I hope it will.”
Dean looks down at his watch seeing more time passed than he anticipated, and shakes his head. He finishes tidying up his area and slings his bag over his shoulder. Dean takes a peek in the dayroom and says bye to a couple members of the crew. Dean makes his way towards the lobby, where he hears someone arguing with the receptionist as he rounds the corner.
Dean’s eyes wander around the space and take in the different things about the house, trying to gather as much information about Castiel as he can. His ears perk at the sound of a running shower. Dean’s mouth becomes slightly dry, and he turns the volume up just a few levels to try and take his mind to a more appropriate place.
Castiel shivers in his wet clothes. As he didn’t bother to button up his trench coat, he’s now soaked all the way down to his shirt. Actually, he’s pretty confident his underwear is wet, too. He hangs the coat on a hook by the door and crouches to take off his shoes again as a puddle of melted snow slowly expands around him. He can’t feel his feet. His numb fingers refuse to obey him, and he’s doing an even worse job than early. He curses in Enochian between his chattering teeth.
Dean chuckles, setting the first on a plate, and does as he’s told with a smirk. “Here you go,” he offers.
Castiel gives Dean a look and shakes his head.  He almost told Dean he has scanned the area.  He almost forgot he was angry. He looks back down at his shoes and tries to untie a particularly tight knot made worse by the moisture.
“Dean, you’re the guest at my house. I would cook for you, but you don’t have to stick around for me. As much as I enjoy your company, I know you have to be busy,” Castiel says, leaning forward slightly. He slowly blinks, grinning at Dean.
“I don’t know, Dean. I’m at a loss with all of this. They captured me, but they didn’t hurt me. They didn’t want to kill me, which I found really strange. I know that not all vampires are mindless monsters, but these ones…” Sam’s voice trails off, watching his brother move a book onto the table. He narrows his eyes. “I just think that maybe we’ll have to go stealth. I know the crew runs with a squad of ten and the leader. What I don’t know is who the leader is. I’m not even sure if one of the ten members could be the leader, and they masked their identity,” Sam explains in-depth, gripping up a broom. Sam begins sweeping up the broken glass that is littered all around the motel room. “Seriously, Dean… where did all of this glass come from? All of the bulbs are broken in this room,” Sam stares hard at Dean, demanding some kind of answer.
Castiel growls at the sensation of Dean’s hand on him. He shamelessly bucks into the other man’s hand, biting his lip and trying to push his head further into the pillow. Unintelligible words fall from Castiel’s lips as the fire inside grows alarmingly, his passion reaching a fever pitch. “Dean…” he begs.
“Yes, Cas,” Dean manages, his voice heavy with lust for the man before him. He looks into the man’s eyes, and his own vision is filled with nothing but that hue of blue.
Dean’s eyes grow wide, and he can feel his blood pressure rise, a need to fight back itching in his brain. “You know why I didn’t let you on the cases, Cas? Because I almost
Castiel’s body begins to warm as he gets closer to his release. Pulling harder at the restraints, Castiel roars Dean’s name as he finally comes. His load shooting hot between the two men. His body begins to glow white-hot, and his skin heating up exponentially as the vampire bites and bruises fade away. “Dean! You have to get off of me before I burn you!” Castiel screams his warning and bucks under Dean, trying to throw him off.
Samantha nods. “You’re welcome,” she says, shutting the register and lets out a deep sigh as the man exits the shop. She walks over to the door and locks it. Samantha turns back to the cash register and pops it open. She places the credit card receipts and larger bills into the till and walks to the store’s back. Using her hip, she pushes the door open, laughing as her boss turns to face her, eyes wide.
He swipes at the screen on his phone and opens a new text message. Typing in Samantha’s phone number, he sends off a quick message.
Benny raises a curious eyebrow. “It’s not particularly customary, but there are no rules against it. Every so often we come across something, or someone, we just can’t let go,” Benny shrugs, taking a seat at the table. “It’s not uncommon for it to be our first. First rescue. First failure. First close call. So if it will give you some peace to see him with your own eyes, then I’m gonna have to advise it,” he smiles.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up as he sets the menu to the side, glancing down at the scratches. He swallows hard before clearing his throat, “Those were there when we checked in,” he says cooly before pushing up from the table, grabbing his jacket off the chair. “I can just run up the road to the diner we went to yesterday and grab breakfast,” Dean offers quickly, trying to detour Sam’s attention.
Drinking again, Castiel’s head swims slightly when he looks at the clock. He regrets not eating, but now he’s drunk, and he feels better now than he has all day. Shrugging, Castiel sets the bottle down and pulls off his shirt. Next, he empties his pockets onto his nightstand. He stares at his phone for a moment. Probably not the best of ideas, but he fishes out Dean’s phone number and puts it into his phone.
,” he gasps, his climax rushing around in his belly, looking for a way to push Castiel over the cliff.
As he reaches from the towel, his hand lands on Dean’s. It’s surprisingly warm. He lingers a short moment before taking over the task.
The angel awkwardly walks to the bathroom and closes the door. He leans against it, closes his eyes. The image of Dean’s naked torso flashes in front of his eyes. It’s not like he’s never seen the man naked before, but this time, it felt different. It stirred something in him. Castiel sighs; he can address this later. His clothes are sticking to his skin, and he’s shivering again. He turns on the tap and starts undressing.
“Dean. I don’t think I’m the one you should share this with. I am not worthy. I wasn’t thinking clearly, and I assumed you’ve been with another man. That’s on me, and I’m sorry. You don’t have to go through with this,” Castiel begs, although he can’t help getting hard in his pants as he watches Dean walk away.
Delaying no more, Castiel appears back in the room. Dean is still hanging from the cuffs, covered in drying blood, and his jeans stained from the earlier experiment. Grief cuts through Castiel at his actions and not stopping the first time that Dean called out. Feeling his decisions were righteous and that the power would work, he didn’t see the need to stop. Castiel hopes that Dean can forgive him for his trespasses this night.
Reaching behind him, Castiel grabs the towel hanging on the dishwasher. He pulls it down and bends over the spill, sopping up the liquid. “You didn’t really make that much of a mess, to tell the truth,” Castiel finishes cleaning the beer. He tosses the wet towel in the sink and rises to his feet, taking his place against the counter again. Unable to help smiling at the blushing man, Castiel looks at the sight Dean makes. “So, what would you like for dinner? I’ll cook, but you’ll have to go shopping for the stuff you want. That is if it’s not too much a bother,” Castiel replies.
Castiel takes notice that the wounds are not healing as fast as a typical vampire. Assuming it could be from the fact that his blood is running through Dean, he counts it as a win. He runs the knife down the front of both legs next, watching the blood pour out of those new cuts. Coating his finger with Dean’s blood, Castiel samples it. At the current time, he notes that Dean’s blood is swarming with the vampiric affliction.
Dean continues his work on Castiel’s hole and leans forward, licking a stripe up his inner thigh, groaning softly at the taste. He pulls back, briefly coating his fingers with more lube. He plants small, soft kisses up Castiel’s muscular, smooth thighs and runs the flat of his tongue up the swollen shaft.
“Yeah, it’s still out in my car. I can go grab it,” he says, moving towards the door but stops when he hears Castiel’s words. “Cas?” Dean calls back, trying to make sure he’s okay.
. The word does something to Dean he can’t quite pinpoint, but he likes it. A grin spreads across his lips as he lifts a hand to cup the side of Castiel’s face. His eyes flick down to Castiel’s lips before forcing himself to look back to the blue of his eyes. Dean lets out a soft huff of laughter. “Never really thought of myself as gentle,” he says.
He watches the back of the emergency vehicle slam shut, blinking a few times. Dean hopes to hell the guy makes it through the next few critical hours, and he wasn’t too late. Running his hands through his sweat matted hair, he feels a hand on his shoulder.
Castiel takes a quick moment to admire Dean’s form before quickly averting his eyes higher and holding eye contact with Dean. Something passes between them, something like a jolt of electricity but invisible, and Dean shivers.
“F-fuckk, Cas,” Dean pants, as his eyes widen as he watches Castiel. “I can’t wait to see what you taste like,” he finds a small sill in the corner and lifts his leg on it. He lifts his left index finger to his mouth and sucks on it for a moment before lowering it and circles his hole. “I think I’m gonna…” he moans as he strokes himself faster, thumbing over his slit.
Shaking his head in disbelief, he rubs the back of his neck before looking back to Sam. “We need to find Cas and get the hell out of here, Sam.” He swallows, kneeling down as he takes a closer look at one of the burnt corpses. His brow furrows, “Do you think he did this?”
“When you make me come,” Castiel starts, breathlessly, “I want you to fuck my mouth,” he groans, fucking back onto Dean’s fingers. “Dean,” he keens, chest heaving. “You climb up me and fuck me hard, you understand?” Castiel asks, his voice filled with desperation while his orgasm looms in the near distance. “Oh, fuck,” he moans.
Castiel feels exhausted but has the feeling that this storm has finally passed. Dean’s regular breathing, and slightly unnerving snoring, make him smile. Slowly, making sure not to wake up the Winchester, Castiel gets up. Wrapping the blanket around Dean, he swoops the man up as if he weighs no more than a feather. He takes him upstairs and lays him on the bed, arranging the blanket. Castiel then slips under the comforter and, lying on his back, lets the sound of Dean’s heartbeat lull him into a meditative state.
Castiel smiles around the man’s thrusting cock. Licking at the silky flesh, he lightly skims the hardness with his teeth. Castiel presses on the spot inside of Dean and slaps his other cheek with the flat of his hand, effectively pushing Dean deeper into his mouth. “
Castiel finishes the large bite in his mouth. “I’m sorry, it is rude to talk with my mouth full. I was trying to say that I just need a shower and I’ll be ready shortly. The remote for the television is on the table in the other room. I shouldn’t be more than twenty minutes,” Castiel nods down the hall, then he wanders off. “Thanks again for the burrito, Dean,” Castiel calls out, disappearing into a doorway.
Dean shrugs, reaching for a burrito. He’s not really paying attention and accidentally reaches for the same one as Castiel and blushes as their fingers brush against one another. Dean clears his throat, pulling his hand back quickly, and grabs the second option. “S’not a problem,” he keeps his eyes on his food as he unwraps it and can feel the tips of his ears redden. “Like I said, I have the next three days off, and I’m free,” he licks his lips, finally taking a bite.
“You do not appear to be seriously injured,” Cas decides, still looking down over him. He’s close, close enough that Dean can make out individual threads in the dark tangle of his eyelashes. Dean watches Cas’s throat move as he says, ”So I will repeat my previous question: would you like me to fuck you or not?”
Dean drives until his knuckles are white. Until even the Taco Bells peter out and the streets turn residential, rows upon rows of tidy suburban darkness, almost menacing in their homogeneity.
So yeah. He keeps living, and it’s fine. Pumpkin pie and football and the whole goddamn American dream. Normal life, right? Dean can be normal. He locks away the past 32 years and swallows the key. Keeps his eyes on the road and out of the passenger seat. Bites the prayers off his tongue and stops going to Taco Bell.
“There’s not a cell of your body that’s unfamiliar to me,” Cas says quietly. “When I raised you, I remade you wholly. You know this.”
“Really,” Dean says. He takes a step closer. Another. Castiel doesn’t move from his place on the edge of the bed, although his shoulders tense as he tracks Dean’s path. “Then why don’t you prove it to me,” he says softly, sliding on a smirk as he arrives right in the gap between Cas’s open legs.
Cas’s lips mark a trail down Dean’s throat, his collarbone, his chest. He mouths at Dean’s breast, tongue hot against his nipple, smiling into his skin when his efforts elicit a “
Without breaking his gaze, he slides their hands under his boxers to the mottled skin of his thighs.
When they’re done, Dean slides to the floor, breathing heavily. He hands Cas his boxers and khakis, which he restores wordlessly, his eyes casting vacantly over the motel room. But when they land back on Dean, something snaps into focus.
“You’re here,” Dean says, as much stating the obvious as he is wondering at the small novelty of having an on-demand angel concierge.
After CVS, he pulls into the liquor store down the street and exchanges a crumpled twenty for a half gallon of whiskey. As the man rings it up, Dean studies the label on a can of Skoal.
It works just as he’d expected; Sid’s mouth pulls down in that way people do when they don’t actually care, and he claps Dean on the back with some variation of
“We’re trapped in chains of our own stagnation. Doomed to tread the same tired patterns, over and over until the end of time.
“You know, Cas,” Dean says, voice rough, “there’s easier ways to get in my pants. Buddy, all you had to do was
sick, he wasn’t lying about that part—and throws down a tube of lidocaine for himself. He’d never admit it to Lisa, but the job is hell on his back. He wants to laugh at himself—Dean Winchester, once ruthless hunter, now reduced to construction jobs and drugstore-variety back pain. But he’s not 26 anymore, and for the first time that revelation is more comforting than panic-inducing. His body has an expiration date, and each day it pushes closer.
“If you’re still planning on drinking that entire thing,” Castiel says mildly, “you should at least finish your dinner.”
Dean’s let his brother down so many times; what’s one more added to the pile. He eyes the street lamp, the hood of his car. The airbags that never got replaced. He thinks,
“Look,” he says finally, when he’s drained a few more mouthfuls, “I’m fine. Really.” Cas tilts his head, looking pointedly at the bottle, and Dean sighs.
” His brow furrows with the effort of his concentration, and he wets his lips almost unthinkingly. It takes physical effort not to stare. “Angels,” Cas starts, “we have all this
Dean startles so violently that he pounds on the horn, splashing whiskey down his front and onto the seat. “Jesus,” he says, when the air in his lungs has partially returned. “
certainly hadn’t. He thinks of Sam’s screams after he’d locked him away in the basement. The ugly words he’d hurled before they’d gone their separate ways.
At the apex of Dean’s thighs, Cas pauses. “Do you want this?” he asks again, and this time there can be no other answer than
Shaking his head, Dean takes another bite. The meat is cold by this point, and he’s making a real mess of the car, bits of lettuce and sour cream everywhere, but he’s starting to feel less shaky than before.
Cas doesn’t move, but Dean can hear him swallow. When he pulls away, Cas looks up at him from darkened eyes, and a hot spike of adrenaline thrills in Dean’s blood. He thinks back to that night in the bathtub. Cas’s flushed cheeks; his quick, shallow breaths. Holy Angel of the Lord or not, Dean
—but the humiliation isn’t quite enough to outweigh the convenience. The blade is sharp and small, easily wiped clean with less than a shot of vodka. He knocks back the remainder and etches shallow lines across his upper thighs.
“Prove it,” he says again, and slides a hand under Cas’s shirt. His body is taut and lean in a way that Dean’s hasn’t been in ages, the flat planes of his abdominal muscles shivering under Dean’s palm. “Show me,” he says as he drops to his knees.
without real feelings, ready to go all Dr. Phil on my ass. Unbelievable. So you can take your concern and fuck right out of my life, you hear me?.”
Dean is frozen to his seat. An involuntary surge of fear skitters across his skin—some deep, animal part of his brain telling him
, nonspecifically; if he’d been stuck celibate in Heaven for centuries, stands to reason he’d be a little desperate for any action at all, no matter the source. Because hell knows
In the car, he rubs his hands together and waits for the radiator to crank to life. The Honda was dirt cheap, and it shows, but it gets him where he needs to be. Can’t ask for much more than that, although a working clock would’ve been nice. He slaps the dash a few times until the numbers
Yeah, Dean knows this. Cas had rebuilt him with flawless skin and washboard abs and a brand new lease on life and Dean had ruined all of it in less than a month. He doesn’t need the reminder.
The sink is cool against his forehead. He keeps his thumb pressed to the dull edge of the knife, careful to avoid the initials carved in the base of the hilt, and wonders if the Host can see him now. Dean Winchester: just a year past thirty, flirty, and thriving, sitting shirtless in his boxers on the side of a motel bathtub. Legs spread, but not for the fun reason. Shaking his head, he soaks a washcloth in alcohol and brushes it over the marbled skin of his inner thighs. White cloth comes away red. “Shit,” he swears softly, grabbing another towel.
is what he needs—not anything Castiel could give him. Just fury, righteous and purifying enough to be worthy of the Michael Sword. A match, an oil spill. A sharp pointed tool with blades on both ends.
Castiel’s eyes harden. Outside, the street lamp flickers once, twice, and then plunges into darkness. A shadow crosses the angel’s face that sends shivers across Dean’s neck. He’s suddenly very, very aware that something far more dangerous lurks behind the holy tax accountant façade.
—before he withdraws his hands and returns them to his lap, where they fold a little tighter than before.
“The state of your physical body is immaterial to your status as a vessel,” Castiel continues, as if he hadn’t just appeared out of
Cas’s lips are rough and warm. They crash into each other, teeth and tongue, and Cas is everywhere. “
“Thanks, buddy,” Dean says with a laugh that scrapes his lungs, “but you’ve done enough for the evening. Fly home, take a load off, okay?.” When Cas doesn’t move, Dean makes a shooing motion with his left hand. “I mean it, dude. Heaven’s gotta be missing you, so go on, get outta here.”
Something imperceptible in Cas’s face changes, and he withdraws slightly from his position over Dean. “As you wish,” he says.
“Hey—it’s Dean, right?” Sid says. He’s guzzling a water bottle, forehead shiny with sweat, and when Dean nods in affirmation, it crinkles with his easy smile. “The boys and I are heading to Nibsy’s after we finish up here. You want in?”
Cas’s hands don’t waver as he says, “I am aware that sexual humor is a common deflection method among humans. However, the nuances of sarcasm continue to elude me. Would you like me to fuck you or not?”
. This is your Michael Sword, your “perfect” vessel. A sprinkling of early gray at the temples. Stomach softened from booze. Cross-hatches of red marring the skin. He bites out a laugh, grimy and rueful, and it echoes off the tile.
“Uh,” Dean says. “Buddy, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but a lot of times we ain’t exactly changing for the better.”
, what do you think?” Dean shoots back. He’s given up trying to push himself out. It’s actually surprisingly comfortable in here, cocooned on either side by the smooth, cool wall. The bleeding’s stop on his thighs, too, but he won’t let himself check if Cas erased his scars completely.
Unbelievable. “Fuck you, Cas,”  Dean says, without any real venom. Castiel’s expression doesn’t change, but one of his eyebrows furrows slightly lower than the other.
about him. Like he’s a stupid, broken little child. Like everything that’s happened hasn’t been a direct result of angels choosing to host their dick-swinging contests here on Earth. Like they don’t even care that Sam—
“And for the record,” Cas says, “I wasn’t going to make you talk about your feelings. I know you hate that.” He sounds somewhere between offended and genuinely hurt, just earnest enough that Dean almost laughs, even as something twists inside him. “I was just going to make you eat another one of these.” Cas snaps his fingers and a second crunchwrap appears in Dean’s hands.
The cap unscrews easily. The first mouthful’s always the worst, but it gets easier after that, and the heat is welcome in the freezing car.
” he adds emphatically when Dean scoffs. “Part of it was that we knew our Father always loved you best—that’s undeniable—but mostly, we envied how you
“I see,” Cas says. If the touch bothers him, he doesn’t show it. His skin is cool against Dean’s hands. “You made my words into a sexual innuendo.” His mouth twists slightly. “Another winning example of the humor you humans are famous for, I’m sure.”
He’s heard it said that cutting gives you a sort of clarity. Physical pain to distract from the mental, sharpening the mind like a whetstone. Bullshit. All of that. Cutting himself has never done more than decorate his body in slender white scars. Pity, he thinks, and curls his lips into a half-smile. Cas went through all that trouble to bring him back pretty, and what does Dean do with his shiny new body? Immediately fucks it up again, apparently.
” he spits with as much venom as one can muster while balancing half naked on a pink ceramic bathtub. “What’s it to you, anyway? I thought you were all just waiting for me to die for ‘the greater glory’, or whatever bullshit your buddy Zach was saying.”
He realizes, for the first time, that he’s not the only one keeping so much contained just below the surface.
to give you this?” The callus of his thumb scrapes over Dean’s bottom lip, and Dean shivers, unable to help himself.
Now Dean thinks he understands John a little better. There’s a gritty sort of pride that comes from destroying yourself without an audience.
Cas must see the change in his face, because he adds, “No, you misunderstand me. Remember that when I made you, I made you
than that. There’s suffering in you—more  than I would ever wish—but there’s joy, too. Love and hate, pride and envy, crushing fear and desperate hope.” His lips press to Dean’s temple, his jaw, his throat. “I have held the colors of your soul in my hands and they were
Cas’s fingers still against his skin. The only sounds are the hum of the radiator and the thudding of Dean’s own heart, shivering and bare in his chest.
. Then Cas shifts his hands, runs a careful finger along Dean’s vertebrae, and at once, the ache he’s grown used to vanishes.
He sits on the edge of the bed. Gets up. Stands by the window. Paces and repeats. The hunt won’t start till the morning, but he’s keyed up enough to take on a rugaru bare-handed. His mind won’t settle—it’s turning in circles like a broken record, hooked on a ceaseless refrain of static. He needs to move. He needs to drink. He needs to shove down cheap gas station junk food until he’s sick. He needs to feel—
The man hands him the bottle in a brown paper bag. Dean sets the can back on the shelf and heads out to the car.
Dean blinks. Scrubs a hand over his eyes. Blinks again. But Castiel is still sitting calmly on the passenger side, looking for all the world like the cheap microfiber seat was made just for him.
“Yes,” Cas says simply. “The human body needs protein, fats, and carbohydrates to function. I can see your ribs through your shirt, Dean. You’re not well.”
He’s trying. He’s trying so goddamn hard. “Keep living”—just two small words to encompass the whole vastness of it. The enormity. He can’t process it; he has to process it. The rules of it all, the mechanics of breathing with half a lung. He can’t process it. He makes lists.
In a smooth, graceful motion, Cas places his palms on Dean’s hips and tugs him forward onto the bed, rolling so Dean is pinned flat beneath him.
He passes the streetlamp and parks next to a basketball hoop. Lacrosse sticks and nerf guns litter the driveway, and he steps over each one gingerly, taking care not to crush their plastic shells. The porch light flickers on, Lisa’s silhouette shadowing the door.
He cuts himself with his father’s knife. The implicit metaphor in that action is almost embarrassing enough to give him pause—
His hand drops to his waist, fingers ghosting over the blade. His body knows the exact pressure needed to draw blood.
“I’m referring to your emotional pain, not your physical pain,” Cas says. “But I’d be glad to take care of that too, if you wish.” And before Dean can react, Castiel places his palms flat on Dean’s back, fingers warm through the thin layer of his henley.
Dean wonders if Cas is considering it. Hopes he is. It’s not too late to throw Dean back in the pit, to grip someone else tight and raise them anew. Someone good. Someone who doesn’t doubt, doesn’t run. Someone who keeps their pain neat and clean and doesn’t carve it away into ugly red. Doesn’t binge eat in gas station parking lots or daydrink in cheap motel rooms.
Next stop on his Friday routine: Taco Bell drive-through. He orders a crunchwrap supreme and forces down two bites as he drives, throwing the rest on the passenger seat. He’ll finish it later. Maybe. He can’t remember the last time he was actually hungry.
. Unthinkable power. Yet what do we do with it?” His answering smile is a bitter slash. “Follow petty orders and millennia-old directives. There’s no creativity, no spark, no
Dean takes another pull of whiskey. The crunchwrap sobered him up some, and if Cas is going to keep—keep doing
Dean flips the hammer in his hands, balancing it neatly between his fingers. “Thanks, man, really,” he says. “Lord knows I could use a couple. But not today—gotta run to the pharmacy. Kid at home, flu season. You know how it is.” He looks up with a practiced
Cas’s breathing hitches audibly, fingers closing around Dean’s to help guide them to the zipper. The slacks fall away easily, but he lets the boxers stay a moment longer as he strokes teasingly through the fabric.
Cas waits patiently as Dean eats, hands folded in his lap. He looks the same as ever—trench coat too big for his shoulders, tie just slightly askew. Dean remembers when he’d first met Cas, how unexpected it had been to find that an angel of the Lord could look so—disheveled. Now—though he’d never admit it—it’s grown endearing. Another point of difference between Cas and his ever-impeccable assholes of a family. Dean eyes the mismatched buttons on Cas’s shirt and thinks,
from this angle—all dark lashes and rough lips, stubble on his cheeks. Impulsively, Dean slides a thumb along Cas’s jaw and lets both hands link behind Cas’s neck.
God, what a joke. Normal? After everything? It’s the last thing Dean knows how to do, and it’s the last thing he deserves.
Somewhere around the third hour he starts an inventory of the shapes he passes. Here, a Taco Bell, lit neon and purple. Here, a gas station,
he thinks, and then hastily stops himself for fear of accidentally summoning another heavenly figure into his bathroom.
Finally, he pulls into the empty lot past Lisa’s house, yanks the key out of the ignition, and lets his breathing slow. His sanctuary; where the developers ran out of money and the road sits lonely and unfinished, where the restraint of suburbia gives way to wilderness. Where Dean comes to get fucked up out of his mind.
“No, Cas.” Dean laughs nervously. “It’ll go away…soon enough,” he shrugs and looks back to Castiel. “Sam’s fine, too.” He taps his thumb on the table. “There’s not much going on with the case. We just got in about a day ago. These just seem like your average vamps, Cas. What did you mean you felt something different with them?” Dean says, tilting his head to the side a bit.
Sam chokes on the bite of his salad he put in his mouth while listening to Castiel tell the story. He brings a napkin to his mouth, trying to contain his laughter.
Dean sighs and does as he’s told and assumes his position, climbing up the couch and Castiel. He grips himself at the base and moans softly, looking down at the other man. “Fuck, Cas, I...” he trails off, losing his train of thought in the blue pools of Castiel’s eyes.
“I understand. We have vampires to hunt, too.” Castiel closes the curtain, walking out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him. He snaps his fingers, but Sam doesn’t appear. Castiel snaps again, and nothing happens. He rushes back to the bathroom. “Dean, we have a problem,” his voice laced with real panic.
Castiel grunts, running his hands up to Dean’s bare ass. He grips and pushes Dean to get him to stuff more of himself into his mouth. Castiel knows he can fit a little bit more before he disappoints himself by being unable to take all of Dean’s cock. Someday he’s gonna spear himself on that monster.
Dean shrugs. “He had stopped in before you woke up to talk to us about the vamps nest, and we had a... disagreement,” he explains cooly before taking a drink of beer with a nod.
“It’s okay, Cas, take as much time as you need,” he runs his hand across Castiel’s back, curious about where the angel keeps his wings. He walks to the fireplace, tossing some logs in, and barely dodges the sparks that shoot out. Moving back to the couch, he takes a seat, resting his legs on the table.
Dean watches Sam enter the bathroom and listens intently for the sound of running water. He looks down at the table, eyeing the scratch marks before tracing his index finger over them gently. Biting his lip once he hears Sam turn on the water, Dean takes a deep breath. “Castiel, I swear if you don’t get your ass back here…” He prays quietly to his angel before letting out a frustrated sigh. Getting up from the table, Dean walks to the coffee maker and pours himself a cup.
Castiel climbs into his bed and sits back against the headboard. He knows something he could be doing, or he supposes, someone. Dean would be a very welcome distraction to all of this frustration pent up inside of him. Hell, it’s been since the shower that Castiel has had any release. He drinks from the bottle again, groaning as he thinks back to his lips wrapped around that sinful man. Dean was made for sex, sex with Castiel. He should have told Dean to fuck his mouth. He knows he could have come that way. Just listening to the noises coming from Dean was enough to almost make him spill in his pants.
Castiel is abruptly pulled forward as the door suddenly opens. He stumbles to find himself face to face with Dean. He instinctively hides his genitals with his hands. He can feel his cheek and ears burn red.
“Dean, I can bring you back, but I’m going to also transfuse blood into you as I drain you.” Castiel moves another machine closer and a hospital pole. He walks over to a hidden refrigerator, pulling out bags of blood matching Dean’s blood type. “I’m prepared.”
Dean cups Castiel’s cheek and smiles brightly down at him as another low moan escapes him. He rolls his hips as he continues to ride him. Dean runs a thumb over Castiel’s cheek, wiping away the wetness. He kisses his other cheek tasting the saltiness of Castiel’s tears. “I love you so much,” he says, voice cracking a bit before burying his face in Castiel’s neck, inhaling his intoxicating woody, minty scent.
“Cas, here,” Dean kneels down on the ground, pulling Castiel’s fingers aside. He unknots the shoes quickly. “Lean against the door,” Dean lightly commands of the angel, removing one shoe then the other. From his knees, he looks up at Cas from underneath his lashes. “Is that better, Cas? You really need to get out of those clothes and into a hot shower. Can you manage that, or should I help you too?” Dean teases with a wink.
Castiel looks at the table, then back up to Dean’s eyes, unable to keep his emotions from filling them. “How did you sleep?”
“Hey, no problem, man. I had some extra time on my way in, and I figured you’d guys would be hungry,” he shrugs, leaning against the counter, crossing his arms over his chest. Aaron nods and continues to eat his food in appreciative silence. Dean thinks Aaron’s a cool guy, laid back, and doesn’t mind having a beer with him after a shift.
Trying his best to swallow, Dean curses at himself as he starts to cough and sputter, forgetting to breathe. He swallows what he can and pulls off, still trying to stroke Castiel through his climax. Dean coughs into his shirt sleeve and looks up at Castiel with a sheepish, apologetic smile. “Sorry, porn makes this stuff look easier than it actually is, I guess,” he chuckles.
Sucking in a considerable amount of air, Dean cannot stop his fangs from retracting, and Castiel’s closeness is too much for him to handle. Taking a chance, Dean flicks his tongue along the angel’s lips, trying to distract him. This ploy fails, and it seems that Castiel is beyond any awareness of what is happening to his physical form.
Setting down the bowl, Castiel walks up to Dean, looking him over, and careful not to brush against, well, any of him. “Dean, again, I’m going to apologize, because this will not be pleasant. It will probably be painful for both of us. We have to get you better.”
"Fuck," Castiel mutters, shaking his head to see the room empty. "The car must still be back at the store," he sighs. He reaches into his pocket for his phone, forgetting that it's broken. "Fuck!" He yells, throwing his keys across the garage. Castiel pulls at his hair and stomps back into the house. He pitches his coffee cup into the air, and it smashes in the sink. "Why?! Why did this have to happen?!" Castiel continues to yell, storming down the hallway and tearing off his clothes.
Castiel crosses his arms on his chest. He can feel a dim blue glow in his eyes. His anger bores deep roots in his heart, and he finds himself unfazed by Dean’s sudden declaration.
Castiel moans, watching as the man on the other side of the glass slowly comes apart. “I love to watch, and I could watch you forever, Dean. I’ll show you so many incredible things that I’ve learned. Gods, baby, just like that,” Castiel sighs, his hand on the glass shaking while his other works over his wet tip. Inhaling deep, Castiel presses his forehead to the glass. “Will you come for me, my sweet?”
"Dean?" Castiel calls out. He knows that at some time, he's going to be saved. How long did it take last time? How long was he in that burning building? Anxiety fills his chest, heart speeding up, and he knows he has to get out. Slowly, he drags himself along the floor. He recalls the fire safety he learned in college. After some time, Castiel gets to the door. It's dark outside when it gets open, but he pushes on and finally lands on his porch. Where the fuck was Dean? Where are the trucks? Who the hell is going to put out the fire? The questions circle his brain as he falls asleep outside, on his back, at the entrance to his home.
Dean’s blush intensifies tenfold under Castiel’s compliments. He feels his breath leave his lungs as his eyes widen, and his pulse quickens. All he has to do is lean in a few centimeters and…
…” He moans as he closes his eyes tightly as his breath hitches as he slips a hand under the soft fabric of Castiel’s shirt.
“Yeah yeah..” Dean waves his hand in the air as he makes his way to the hallway towards the kitchen. Grabbing three beers, he finds his way back to the library. “Here we go,” he says as he sets two of the beers on the table. Dean leans back in his seat, propping his feet up on the table. He twists off the cap to his beer and tosses it on the table.
Dean grabs a pen and notepad in his kitchen, writing down the address. “I’m not disagreeing with you, but now you’re directing me to bother him at his house?” He runs a hand over his face. “He… he doesn’t have anyone?” Dean asks, concerned but also wanting to learn more about Castiel.
Dean wasn’t embarrassed or ashamed by the type of porn he watched, but something about the thought of Castiel knowing made him feel a bit bashful. He rolls his eyes at himself as he pulls on some dark, worn jeans with a red and black flannel with a black T-shirt underneath.
Castiel stands up, walking over to Dean. “Are you okay? You seem to be stressed.” Noticing the bruise, Castiel tips his head to the side. “Dean, you seem to be hurt. What’s happened?” The curiosity in Castiel’s voice sounds genuine enough as he looks at the man standing in front of him.
“Sam, now’s not the time,” Dean says sharply, glaring at his brother. He rolls his eyes and exhales. “Look, once we take out this nest and make sure Cas is okay, I’ll answer all your questions. Okay?” He offers, hoping it’ll be enough.
Castiel pats Sam’s shoulder, trying to calm the younger brother down. He’s been with the Winchesters for many years now. He knows how strong a relationship the two brothers have, but he also can’t deny his feelings for Dean. Castiel considers it a bond that rivals that of brotherhood. A stab of pain lashes Castiel, as he thinks about a world without Dean in it. It is unacceptable, and he knows he has to do whatever is in his power to bring Dean back. No matter the cost.
“No, Dean, it was already in the pot when I woke up. I assumed you made it.” Sam narrows his eyes on his brother. “Are you sure you’re doing okay, Dean? I mean, it’s been a while since the vampire thing, but if you’re not ready, I can call Cas and have him help me with this.” The concern in Sam’s voice is apparent, as is the worry in his eyes for his brother. He grips the book beside him, debating if he should approach his brother or not, settling on the second option. He stays seated.
Samantha looks at the man. “Hey! You’re the guy with the tentacle porn! What are you doing here?” She blurts.
He leans up, cranking up the volume before laying back down on the seat, covering his face with his hands as the music assaults his ears. His mind wanders to images of Castiel standing above him, lust-filled blue eyes burning into him. Dean growls inwards as he feels his cock hardening against the denim of his jeans. Sitting up quickly, he sees no one along the long stretch of backroad. Dean curses through his teeth as he aggressively undoes his belt followed by undoing his jeans. He arches his back as he inches them down his hips. Closing his eyes tightly, Dean takes his hard cock into his hands as thoughts of Castiel’s touch come flooding back to him. He begins pumping himself as the song’s beat, and the running engine softly vibrates the car. Dean swallows hard as he begins increasing speed, and his free hand claws at the soft leather underneath him. “Cas…” Dean growls as the name slips over his lips involuntarily.
“Cas, you can, but only if you’ll respect me in the morning,” Dean says with a grin, winking at the angel. His hands shaking in the cuffs are the only sign that he is scared at what is coming next.
“I think it would be safer if I kept my clothes on. My control is hair-thin right now, and I don’t want to rush this,” Castiel offers, grunting as the heat begins to coil in his belly. “If you want to pursue something with me, I will allow it, but we go slow, Dean. Especially if being with me will be your first male experience. I will not sully it,” he growls, bucking up into his grip.
Dean’s eyes widen at Sam’s question. He shrugs nonchalantly as he makes his way over to the coffee pot, pouring himself a cup. “Umm, okay. I guess.” He takes a sip, almost coughing it up as it goes down his throat. Dean looks at the coffee in the cup. “Sam, did you make this coffee?” He swallows as he stares at Sam intently.
“Do you require my assistance, Dean?” Castiel calls after his friend. Walking over to the door, fastening his wayward belt in the process. He stops, waiting for Dean to reply.
Rolling his eyes at his younger brother, Dean shakes his head. “What, a guy can’t help his brother research monsters?” He clears his throat, shutting the book with a sigh. “I’m starving. I was going to grab us some breakfast,” Dean says, standing up from the table.
Sam moves over to the bathroom sink and begins brushing his teeth but is slightly distracted by the other room’s absence of noise.
“Ask away, brother.” Dean shrugs, cocking an eyebrow at his brother as he picks up his glass and swishes the amber liquid around in it. He eyes Sam as he orders the pizza. “Bacon, for the love of God Sam, please tell them bacon.” He closes his eyes as his stomach growls.
“What ya looking for, cowboy?” He asks, his voice shaky. His toes curl in his socks while Dean laps at his cock. “I have some serious doubts you’re new at this,” he grunts.
“You owe me twenty dollars, Winchester,” Benny, his Lieutenant says, as his creole accent grabs Dean’s attention. Dean grins, raising an eyebrow. Benny is quickly becoming someone Dean is learning from, and they got along really well.
Thank you all for the comments, kudos, and bookmarks. We are all finished this time around. Keep an eye out for our Magnum Opus of a story (coming soon) myself and HearMe-Out worked on.
Dean growls as he slaps Sam’s hand away. “Don’t touch him.” He quickly wipes the wetness at his cheeks with the back of his hands. Dean inhales deeply, turning his attention back to Castiel before speaking again to Sam. “Grab the machete and head back to the car,” he says quietly. “I’ll carry him up behind you.”
“Hey, what took so long? You were in there for over an hour! Is Cas still out?” Sam eyes his brother, curious about the smile spread across his face. “I think I found something here. The Men of Letters found that some vampires have venom that can cause hallucinations and increased … appetites… for stuff. How Cas was fighting us, I think he might have been infected, Dean.”
“I think what he’s trying to say is that I touched him with my angel grace and brought him to orgasm,” Castiel interrupts, walking into the room, wearing Dean’s t-shirt and sweatpants. He eyes the brothers as they talk about how Dean had sex with him. “Would that be a correct assumption, Dean?” Castiel turns his gaze to the elder brother, taking a seat at the table. He picks up the extra beer, licking his lips, and takes a deep drink from the bottle. He gently places it back on the table, his eyes locked with Dean’s. Slowly he turns his stare to Sam. “Do you have any more questions about how I pleasured your brother, Sam?”
“I… really, Dean? You mean it?” He walks over to Dean, the scalpel still in his hand. Dean eyes it warily, and Castiel notices, hiding it behind his back. “I have a home with you?”
Dean stands, putting his soup on the table. He places his hands on Castiel’s shoulders, pushing him back down onto the couch. “Oh no, you don’t. I want you to sit here and relax by the fire. You’ve done enough today with all the angel powers and whatnot. I’ll go look for the generator. It’s probably out behind the cabin, you think?” Dean grins, looking from Castiel to the window where the snow is still blowing furiously.
“I released my sexual frustration and bodily liquids, Dean,” Castiel says, deadpan. “I think the rest of what happened was my body trying to get rid of the poison that was causing me to feel the way I was,” Castiel eyes the cuffs, then looks back at Dean. “You were magnificent, by the way.”
Bracing one foot against the end of the couch, Castiel slowly moves into the grip of his fist. “So tight, baby,” he growls, his words slurry with sleep. He bites his lip, then rubs his face in Dean’s lap.
Castiel sighs and runs his fingers through his black, messy hair. He drops his head to the desk, the thud echoing in the small supply office. Inventory is only a few days away, and there is still a lot of work to be done. Who said being a business owner was easy? The door chimes and Castiel looks up into the monitor, watching as a customer enters the store. The clerk, Samantha, greets the man and offers help should the patron need it. Castiel smiles to himself, the joke not lost on him that most of his shop customers are not looking for help buying his products.
Castiel shakes his head, going for the button on Dean’s pants. Castiel’s deft fingers make quick work of that and the zipper. The pants are beginning to harden, and understanding dawns on Castiel at the peril of getting them down without hurting Dean. “Umm, Dean, are you particularly fond of these jeans?”
“Yes… that’s it,” Castiel manages to get out, his head feeling like it’s going to explode, the need to come all-consuming. The moment Dean touches his dick, Castiel feels the buildup, a pressure growing in his body. The fullness inside him and the desperate milking from his lover are precisely what he needs. With a moment of clarity, Castiel cries out, “Forever, Dean. I have loved you forever, and I will always.”
Pulling off, Dean chuckles softly. “Porn and lots of self-exploration,” he says, using his free hand to pump Castiel slowly. “Deep throating is gonna take some work,” he says, dipping down again, wrapping his lips around the throbbing cock.
Castiel reaches back with his other hand, grabbing the dripping washcloth from the bowl. He places the soft cloth against Dean’s cheek, wiping away the blood. The men continue to hold eye contact in this moment. Castiel continues to wipe away the dirt from Dean’s face, then one drop of water drips from his chin, trailing down his chest.
“That’s really kind of you, Cas. How are you feeling? Warmer?” Dean grins a bit, “Sorry about the towel, aren’t angels supposed to have better reflexes?” Dean shrugs, looking down at the towel. “You done with that?” he asks, nodding to the towel around Castiel’s waist. He clicks his tongue, winking.
Castiel looks around his bedroom, surprised by the mess in here, too. “What was I doing last night?” He questions himself and tosses his towel into the hamper. Crossing the space, he stands in front of his dresser and opens the drawer. He pulls out a pair of black cotton boxers and slips them on—next, socks. Castiel picks out a bright blue pair with a shooting star on the side. After, he finds something comfortable to wear, his favorite worn pair of blue jeans, and pulls Dean’s shirt on. Silently, he leaves his room, sneaking down the hall, and peeks in on the guy in his living room.
“It obviously did something to his brain. Maybe it got shaken up while he went through the wall. Wait, can angels get brain damage?” Sam takes the blade from Dean, hefting the bag of weapons up his arm. “Dean, I don’t know what to expect in there. Are you going to be okay if Cas… well, isn’t okay? Or am I going to have to worry about you following in his footsteps and being just as reckless? We are not angels. We do not have the same power or stamina as he does. If they took him down, we need to leave. Vengeance cannot be afforded here.” Sam warns his brother, looking into Dean’s face for signs of understanding.
“Ohhhh god Cas…” Dean moans, his body bucking as his seed suddenly explodes up Castiel’s chest. He begins to ride Castiel, hard. Each thrust met by the other man, both of them groaning and growling out their pleasure. Dean pulls Castiel closer, pinning himself between their muscled stomachs, the friction pulling another orgasm, and making the men sticky. He feverishly kisses Castiel, feeling full of the angel’s cock inside him.
Dean sighs softly to himself as he walks out and down the drive to his car. He grabs the food and coffee, balancing them carefully before shutting the car door. Dean looks around the neighborhood, walking back up to the porch and back in the house, closing the door behind him. He worries his bottom lip in thought, knowing that Castiel needs help but trying to figure out the best way to do that. “They might be a little cold now if you don’t mind that, but I think they reheat pretty well,” he calls out, setting the things on the table Castiel directed him to earlier.
“Cas, you have always been useful. Just because you don’t go out on a job doesn’t mean that you’re not playing a part. Being someone for me to return to. Knowing you’re safe and that you support what we do. That is more useful to me than putting your life on the line for this bullshit,” Dean searches the angel’s face, hoping for some signal that he understands what Dean is trying to say.
Patting Castiel on the side of his arm, Dean smiles. “Yes, Cas. I promise that I’ll take you along again. Hell, you can even ride shotgun. Sam will have to deal with the backseat. Now, finish your soup, I’ll be back in a moment, and hopefully, we’ll have power.” Dean zips his coat up, opening the cabin door quickly, and disappears out into the storm.
Castiel ignores the joke. Now seated on the ground, Cas pulls in his knees to his chest, with his back to the door, and puts his clammy, cold feet on the wet floor. Using the doorknob, he hoists himself back up and lets out a cry. His feet feel like pins and needles. He hurries to the closest kitchen chair and plops down. Rivulets of melted snow flow from his hair to the back of his neck. He shivers.
“Maybe this is all a dream, Dean,” Castiel whispers, making his way up the man’s chest. He bites down on Dean’s nipple, then circles it with his tongue. He pulls back, blows on it slightly, distracting Dean as he reaches down, gripping Dean’s hard cock. Castiel leans close against Dean’s face. “I want you to explode for me, Dean. I want to watch as you come apart.” Castiel licks from the man’s ear and sets his mouth to Dean’s neck, licking and sucking hard. Castiel brands this Winchester as his own, once again. His hand slowly continues working at Dean’s stiff member. Castiel savors the reactions and noises he is rewarded with.
“Was, Dean? Did you change your mind?” Sam inquires, walking over to the table, taking the seat across from Dean, before Dean stood up. He studies his brother a little closer, noticing the stiffness Dean’s trying to hide. Sam stands up, right in front of Dean, and looks down at him. “Dean, you really sure you’re okay? You look really stiff, and…” Sam’s words stop as he sees the bruise on his brother’s neck. He stays silent, then looks into his brother’s eyes.
“I’m still a little hazy, but I think I’ll be okay. I’ll just need some time to rest and recuperate my strength.” Castiel cocks his head to the side. “I’ll be right back.” He stands, leaving the room.
“We could do something more than run if you need to get physical,” Castiel offers and wraps his hand around Dean’s wrist, squeezing gently.
Dean rolls his eyes at his brother. “Jesus, Sam. He’s not a damn science experiment,” he sighs softly. “Not that I noticed physically, but he doesn’t need much time in between to recuperate like we do,” Dean offers.
Looking around the backroom, Castiel drops another massive purple dildo into a box with more of the same. He reaches up and wipes the sweat from his forehead. There are times, like now, when he questions his sanity to do all of the counting by himself, but he reminds himself that his store is booming due to the extra work. Castiel sighs and looks up at the whiteboard with the special orders list. He smiles when he sees Dean’s name. Letting his mind wander, Castiel daydreams about delivering his customer’s items. What does Dean's voice sound like? What kind of personality does he have? Would Dean rebuff Castiel if he asks him on a date? The thoughts start to swirl, and Castiel braces himself against the desk, feeling a little dizzy.
“No deals Dean. We are not playing that game again. What good would it do to bring him back only for him to lose you, for me to lose you!?!” Sam’s voice rises higher with each word until he is practically hysterical. “Cas values you too much for that, Dean. God, he went to hell to bring you back, knowing what you had done. He still wanted you to be here with him. He sees all the good in you that I know is there.” Sam finally starts sobbing, his tears soaking his face and falling to his shirt. “He loved you so much, Dean. Why couldn’t you see it?” The younger brother turns, his eyes reddened from crying.
“You’re so beautiful,” Castiel breathes and reaches out, his fingers catching the band of Dean’s boxers and slowly slips them down his legs. He smiles wide when Dean’s massive cock smacks against his belly. Saliva pools in Castiel’s mouth as he thinks about how he can’t wait to get that fatness down his throat.
Tightening his grip, Castiel rubs his face against the firmness next to him. He rolls his hips, groaning slightly as his post-wake wood presents itself. “Dean,” he moans, lowering his face to get more comfortable.
Dean’s eyes furrow, thinking the girl looks familiar. “Whoa, hey. What’s going on? Everything okay?” His eyes dart between the receptionist and the woman.
The sounds are almost deafening; the closer Dean gets to the bar; the pain in his ears is nothing to the unrelenting need for blood. The smell invades Dean’s mind, willing him to find someone quickly and sate the murderous hunger inside.
Dean lets out a breath trying to bring himself down. He shakes his head, following Castiel towards the host, putting his hands in his pockets.
Sam just nods, looking at the two of them. “Dean, I’m going to need you to articulate your answers better. You can’t leave all the talking to Cas,” he teases. “So, is there a difference in his anatomy because he’s an angel, Dean?”
Dean’s hand on his arm burns like a brand. He can feel his eyes searching his as if hoping for an answer. Unable to bear it anymore, Castiel abruptly gets up and walks to the fireplace. He clenches his fist.
He puts Dean’s foot back down, grabs his tools, walks to the kitchen, and proceeds to wash his hands. Where does this go from here, he wonders.
Dean’s eyes widen, watching Castiel before looking down at the plate in front of him. He follows suit, picking up a piece, and popping it in his mouth. He chews slowly, taking in the different flavors and textures of the food. After a few moments, Dean swallows it down and nods, licking his lips. “That’s pretty good,” he says, picking up his glass and taking a drink.
“Here we are,” the server presents the bottle and sets two glasses on the table. “The first course will be a yellowfin pair of nigiri topped with daikon and drizzled with a wasabi-soy glaze,” the server explains and moves away back into the kitchen.
“Unless I am killed, I will be here until time ends. It means I will see you die. It means I will have to spend an eternity mourning your loss.”
Dean chuckles, looking down at the plate, biting down at his lip. “I’m sure you’ve noticed, but you sure know how to make a guy blush,” blinks a few times before looking up at Castiel.
Dean grins, looking down at Castiel, kissing him deeply. He pulls away with resting his forehead against Castiel’s. “I love you, Cas,” Dean whispers against his angel’s lips with a smile. His grin widens as he feels Castiel’s dick rub against his hole. Reaching over for the bottle on his nightstand, Dean grabs it with a wink at Castiel. He squeezes some on his hand and sticks his hand down between them, slicking up Castiel’s cock. Kissing up his jawline, Dean takes his ear lobe between his teeth. “You want some more?” He whispers into his ear.
As he wanders to the back of the house, he pops the top and drinks deeply from it. Castiel lets out a breath and looks at the clock in the hallway. It’s already seven in the evening, and he can’t help feeling a little pissed off that he wasted most of his day dealing with the fire aftermath. Three fucking weeks to wait and see if he will be able to start on the reconstruction of his store. The insurance agent couldn’t even give him a heads up or a hint about if he had his claim approved. That’s the worst, Castiel assumes. The waiting. What is he going to do with all of this free time?
Castiel looks over to Dean. “Leave the motel and turn left down the road. Sam feels like he’s nearby. I’ll tell you when to turn again.” Castiel says, his voice hollow again as he concentrates.
Dean’s green eyes flicker with an unidentified emotion. “Like what, Cas. Are you okay?” His hands sliding from Castiel’s shoulders and down his arms as he crouches in front of the tired-looking angel. “I know it’s been rough for you lately. You just got everything back, and I cannot imagine how difficult all of this has been, but I want you to know that
“I understand that, Cas, but you’re doing something to me more than trying to cure me,” Dean fires back.
Dean grips the Impala’s steering wheel hard as he pulls out of the motel’s small parking lot. He blinks, seeing Sam standing outside the door in the rearview mirror. Turning onto the road, he can feel his anger and frustration growing. Castiel had to be fucking with him, right? He didn’t imagine their interactions, did he? Granted, he sure as hell didn’t want to talk about them in front of Sam, but it still didn’t calm his frustration. Turning down some backroads, Dean feels his frustration growing, bubbling. He sighs, looking down at his watch, seeing he has been driving around for close to twenty minutes now. Studying the area, Dean pulls over to a small clearing on the side of the road, quickly leaving the car in park. Undoing his seatbelt, he lays across the vehicle’s front seat, using his jacket as a pillow, closing his eyes tightly. He listens to the music playing on the radio, recognizing Van Halen’s - Panama coming through the speakers.
Dropping her to the ground, Dean spins, hearing a noise. Appearing before him is Castiel. Castiel tries hard to hide his surprise and his disappointment. Blood is splattered down the front of Dean’s clothes and all over his face and neck. The discarded woman at his feet. Dean is no longer the same man who has saved countless people and who has saved the world. Trying not to make any sudden moves, Castiel speaks in a low, calm voice. “Dean? It’s me, Castiel.” Castiel narrows his eyes, searching for the old Dean.
This is the first of the two chapters I'm dropping today. This one is so super short, but I think you'll enjoy it. Let me know what you think, should you feel inclined.
“But Cas, Sam has a spell that can cure me. I don’t have to be a vampire forever. Yeah, it sucks for a while, but I’ll do whatever I have to. I can’t be like this forever, Cas, I can’t be. I have too many things that I need to do, and I can’t do it as a MONSTER.” Dean screams his frustration, yanking the shackles again.
"Boss, you have never wanted someone like I saw how you wanted him," Samantha mentions, eyes on the road. "I am rooting for you. I really hope the two of you hit it off. I also hope he's into guys. It's been some time since you've had a date, too," she jabs, a smirk on her lips.
Sighing, Dean stands up, looking down at Castiel. He places his hand on the angel’s shoulder, squeezing lightly. “I’m here if you want to talk, Cas. I’m always here for you,” he smiles at him, the corners of Dean’s eyes tight with stress. Turning away to let the angel screw with his shoes, he goes back to the kitchen to get some food to eat.
Dean coughs, almost spitting out his beer as his eyes widen. He sets his beer on the table, shaking his head and biting his lip. “The best I’ve ever had,” he grins, chuckling lightly. “So yeah... he’s outstanding.” His eyes gloss over momentarily as the memories from the motel room come back to him.
“Is that ALL? Doesn’t seem so bad. Is there anything else I should know about, like mind reading, or angel radio?” Inquires Dean.
Castiel tips his head to the side, the look that says he’s confused, and his brow knots together. “Dean, what are you talking about?” He licks his lips, holding out. He reaches out to Dean’s neck. “Is this causing you to act like this? Where did this come from?” Castiel narrows his eyes at the mark, then lets his eyes wander to meet Dean’s again.
Deepening the kiss and gripping tighter, Castiel is about to remove Dean’s shirt when there is a hard knock on the door. Castiel poofs out of the room, the sound of his feathers echoing softly in the steam-filled bathroom.
“Do you call everyone ’sweetheart’?” Castiel asks, tilting his head slightly. He takes another drink of his beer, looking at Dean with shrewd eyes.
trying to score with this dude, you need to relax,” the kid nods, hitting a few buttons on the register. “That’s thirty-five seventy-eight,” he smiles politely.
He lifts the man's shoulders and sits him up a bit. “Hey. Hey, man. I need you to wake up,” Dean gently pats the man's shoulder. “Come on, can you hear me?!”
“I told you to go away, Cas. Now I can’t be held responsible for what happens next.” Dean growls, lowering his head to Castiel’s neck. “I wonder what angel blood tastes like.” Castiel tips his head as if offering himself up to Dean. Licking the skin, Dean savors the salt and flavor of Castiel. A mix of cedar and a hint of mint. Smiling, Dean opens his mouth and bites into Castiel’s neck, his body stiffening. Castiel wraps his arms around Dean’s shoulders, holding him tighter. Dean practically purrs, drinking deep from the angel.
“Of course not, Cas.” Dean’s brow furrows as he sets his pizza down, grabbing his beer twisting off the cap. “I just said it was amazing. You’re amazing,” he takes a sip. “Didn’t your wings come out?” He asks, trying to run through the details through his memory.
Dean shrugs, furrowing his eyebrows. “I don’t know. It just happens, Sam.” He says almost defensively. “Go find your own angel and find out for yourself.” Dean shoots back at him. He tilts his head to the side, looking past Sam. “Cas broke the lights…” He offers with a shrug, putting his feet back on the table.
“Well, you didn’t fully take advantage of the situation when I begged you to fuck my mouth, dear,” Castiel says, entirely teasing. He looks at Dean, his mind working. “Do you have to work tomorrow?”
“I’m sorry, Sam. I will make my presence known better next time.” Castiel apologizes. “What did you need to see me for?”
“Oh, dear, I can see exactly what it is about you that has Dean in such a tussle. He’s been in a ripe mood since he got here this morning. I don’t know what’s going on, but you should call that man and bolster his spirits a little. It’s not like Dean to be so down in the dumps,” she supplies, lowering her voice slightly.
"Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. Are you going to be okay alone? You were just in a fire, and well, I think you should have someone stay with you for a couple days until you adjust," Samantha says, concerned.
Dean’s eyes glance up, meeting Castiel’s eyes momentarily before yet again averting his gaze. “That could mean a lot of things, Cas.” He shrugs, looking down at what little space there was between him and Castiel now. Dean shifts again before trying to step back, realizing there is no room, and he is stuck between the counter and Castiel. He rubs the back of his neck and sighs. “It could mean you’re nervous about something... or excited,” Dean swallows, “or both.”
Dean takes a drink of beer, a smirk playing at the edge of his lips. “What do you mean? A lot of things happened,” he yawns softly. “You did research. I put off doing research. We talked about the Vamp nest,” Dean shrugs.
Dean watches Castiel and can not fathom why Castiel is seemingly single, let alone have any interest in him. Dean’s jaw falls open involuntarily as his eyes widen, and pupils dilate.
Castiel finds himself reaching for Dean’s arms only too late. He grasps the blanket before it slips off his shoulders. The fire is burning strong in the hearth, yet it can’t compare to the heat of Dean’s body against his. He swears under his breath, not knowing what he wants.
“NO, Sam. I already know what you’re trying to do. I’m a monster!” Dean screams at his brother, turning his back on him.
Dean’s jaw drops, and his eyes widen. “Anybody able to get in there yet?” he asks, trying to keep his voice even.
“Dean,” Castiel whines, rolling his hips and gripping himself firmly. “What I wouldn’t do to use you properly,” Castiel grunts while twisting his wrist. “It’s not my place, though. I’ll take only what you’re willing to give, beautiful,” he moans, watching the scene unfold in the shower.
Dean moans loudly at the surge of power as his eyes open wide, meeting Castiel’s bright blue eyes. “Oh god…” He yells as he grinds harder into Castiel, pumping himself into the angel’s hand with a renewed pressure building. His breathing becomes ragged as he bites down on his lip. The power and Castiel’s words send him quickly over the edge, spilling himself onto Castiel’s stomach and hand. He closes his eyes, licking his lips as he swallows hard.
Dean is awake, his stare pinning Castiel. “What was that at the end, Cas? You don’t play fair.” Dean points out, his voice raw from the earlier exertion, but a slight grin shadowed on his face.
About a half-hour goes by, and Castiel starts to feel incredibly warm. He fans himself as beads of sweat trickle down his neck and disappears into his shirt. “I don’t remember having the heat on,” he muses as he checks the thermostat. Looking at the little box triggers alarm when Castiel notices smoke trailing from under the door. He squints at it and tests the door handle. It’s only slightly warm, so he takes the chance to open it very little, knowing he could cause a backdraft. The first thing he notices is the front register is completely engulfed in flames. The heat is stifling in the small room. He winces and looks for a means of an escape from the front, but the area is quickly filling with more fire. Castiel closes the door and takes some of the costumes, stuffing them under the door. “It’ll be okay. Just stay calm,” Castiel reminds himself, crossing the room to the back door. He unlatches the lock as he dials the emergency number on his phone.
