Iron Man's other gauntlet rested on Steve's knee, squeezing it lightly as if to ground him.  It worked well, and it drew Steve out of the dark thoughts the nightmare left him with.
Steve's eyes were wide, but a small half-smile quirked at his lips.  It wasn't the warm, bright smile from the dream, but Tony could work with this.  It was more than he thought he'd ever get.
"Steve, please.  Sweet pea, I need you to wake up," Tony repeated, his voice cracking.  He raised Steve's head to his and rested his forehead against Steve's.  "Come on, big guy.  Red, white and...  you're a regular patriot, did I ever tell you?  I can't use your dragon name, so you have to respond to... Steve."
She obviously did not become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company by being unobservant, and her cold tone chilled Steve.  He searched for an appropriate response, but couldn't think of one that didn't start with 'I eavesdropped.'  "I'm not having second thoughts on him," Steve said finally.  Except he was, just not, well,
This time Steve did grab his shield from his back, the chair toppling over as he faced the man.  Rhodey also stood, his cane in front of him as if to attack rather than to lean on it.  That was a voice that definitely did not belong in the Tower.
"Not saying you can't," Steve said, forcing his own temper down as he closed the distance between them again.  He took one of Tony's hands and massaged the tension out of it.  "I know you can.  I just want to make sure you're comfortable."
He glanced up to see Steve collecting himself and setting his shoulders back.  Steve moved closer, stealing Rhodey's chair.
He flushed in shame admitting that.  He'd been trying so hard to keep going.  But it just wasn't enough on his own.  He met Iron Man in the library a lot of nights, and the nightmare Tony had stumbled upon was far from the first or the last.  Dealing with Tony, it'd given him something to do that wasn't just pretending to the others that he was alright.  It had certainly helped him get over his heartbreak, though admittedly that was more complicated than he'd originally realized.
"I... Okay?" Steve asked.  Iron Man had never complained about being Tony's employee before, but he supposed Tony might have done something to upset him.  Did that mean he might talk about what was going on finally?
"The power needed to heal my wounds would kill me, and the metal poisoning is what will kill me faster any way," Steve said.  "But I can heal your heart before I go."
Tony bit back a yelp at the hand gripping his ass, giving his best mock glare at Steve who looked like innocence personified.  "Not the right time?" Steve asked just as angelically.  "We could go up stairs and order pizza.  Then we could play some baseball and see how many bases you'll let me steal."
This time Steve had none of the control.  Tony pushed fast and hard, like this was his last chance.  Steve's hands fell to Tony's hips, pulling him closer, tightening before he remembered his strength.  He'd feel guilty for leaving bruises later, but now all he could think about were the chapped lips demanding his attention.
"I am," Peggy said, though her head was cocked to the side.  "I thought you said he wasn't dangerous?"
"Tony..." Steve said, suddenly at a loss for what to do.  He was so angry at this man, but there was more than that going on here.  He just wished he knew what.  "You have to talk to me."
"Tony, are you alright?" Steve asked.  Tony felt a palm brushing over his forehead.  "We can go out another night.  Let's stay in and order pizza, then you can work on the suit a bit more.  You were close, right?"
"He's sentimental," Natasha said, though it didn't sound like she disapproved.  "You didn't let him talk?"
"You're so tense," Steve said as Tony placed the mug on the table, hands still tightly wrapped around the warmth.
"You might as well come down to the workshop then, rather than the lunch meetings," Tony grumbled.  "I talk just as much there and at least
It was an omelet, cooked with onions and cheese just the way he liked it.  He'd had breakfast with the Avengers often enough that they all knew, but he was surprised Tony did.  It made Steve wonder just how much of the Avengers' lives Tony knew about.  Did Iron Man talk to him about everyone, or had Tony had asked about them?
Natasha snorted.  "No shit, Sherlock," she said.  He smiled weakly, and she did a double-take.  "Wait, that was a serious question?  That's a little far in denial even for you, Steve."
"Steve," Tony said, quickly losing patience.  "Do you know him or not?  He is..." Tony stopped, then forced the words out around the lump in his throat.  "He was a dragon.  I was down there with him for weeks and he'd never been to the upper world.  He had a terrible poker face, so I'd know if...  Why are you staring at me like that?  Do I have something on my face?"
Standing abruptly, Stark didn't push his chair back in after leaving it, though Steve did when he followed suit.  "Now, if you're done, I have work to-"
"So, you have some knowledge of the future as well," Kang said, his voice haughty.  "But you must also know that I always win."
and half a million other people have a first impression of me before we've even met.  And first impressions are scientifically proven to be hard to shake.  They won't change their perception of me if I defend myself, so why keep trying something that doesn't work and expect to get better results?  That's a definition of insanity."
Tony swallowed.  "It wasn't your fault," he replied, fidgeting against the pillows at his back.  Break-ups took two people, after all, and Tony had done more than his fair share in their fight.
Tony didn't ask how much she knew of the rest.  She was Steve's confidante, so he might have told her.  Even if Steve hadn't, she was good at reading people and was smart enough to fill in the gaps.
"History gets all sorts of things wrong," Tony said.  "It's written by the people in charge, so it's easy enough to ignore some of the less palatable parts."
.  Iron Man trusted him enough to be vulnerable.  And here he was betraying that trust not even a few days later.
"I'll start getting the jet ready then," Tony said, shaking his head.  "I have to take the armor back to fix it anyway.  I'll-"
"Yes, but your ideas also have great merit," T'Challa said.  "Come, let us put together the press conference you spoke of while they play a little longer."
"I don't think so," Viper said.  "He is more useful to me alive right now.  I need him to ensure your loyalty, Mr. Stark."
"Cap," Sam said, walking in. "I've been looking for - you know, I'm not one to assume or judge, but if that blush means you're looking at porn, Wanda and Vision will be back soon so you might want to take it out of the common areas."
"And why are you here, Rogers?  Why do you care?" Tony turned to Steve again with a calculating look.  "What's in it for you, because I know it's not my charming personality or wit."
He was surprised to see the portal open, with Tony setting up a camera in front of it.  Steve bit down the alarm at seeing it operational, reminding himself that Jane and Tony had worked to make it safe.  The fear didn't quite fade, and his eidetic memory had no problems bringing up images of that Future Tony coughing up blood and going to his death.
was the understatement of the decade.  Tony closed his eyes and focused on not screaming as he bit down on his belt.  And that had probably just been a fracture, Christ.  He could feel Steve's anxiousness, but Tony couldn't find the will to reassure him.  Tony heard his dragon-name feeling, but it felt private, like he was the only one who had heard it.
"Lot of things, Captain.  The important ones right now that he denied was at the scene to know certain things, and that he ran things by the book for that op."  Fury stood, going to stand by one of the paintings on the wall.  It was a modern art piece that Steve suspected Ms. Potts had chosen.  "But that was the problem.  Running it by the book backfired spectacularly."
There was affection and understanding from Steve, along with strong concern and worry.  The suggestion to come back felt like more of a demand, and it had an undercurrent of anger that Tony couldn't discern the cause of while his head hurt this much.
"Ha ha," Clint said, eyes quickly moving over the text.  "Tell her we don't know about the sex, but the bottles are true."
going to come watch me make a fool of myself?" Tony asked, regretting turning Steve down that first time.  At least then it would have been private.
Tony looked towards the door of the temple, knowing that Steve wasn't going to like it.  "Then I'll have to take a gander inside to see if it goes below ground."
Tony snorted.  "Cap's the one you want to go to for morals, sugar pie.  I was just a man with a suit, and I killed out of revenge more than once, and with less danger to me than you had.  If anything, that was self-defense."
That could wait though, when they weren't still smarting.  Steve pulled Tony down on the couch with him, and he went willingly.  Tony tucked himself neatly against Steve's side, head resting on Steve's shoulder in a way that made it difficult to see his eyes.  Still hiding them, Steve supposed.  He couldn't really blame Tony for that.
"He doesn't need to," Tony snapped, then sighed.  The issue had been starting to grate on his nerves, but she didn't deserve the lashing for it.  "Sorry.  That was unfair of me."
"They're all in too deep," Tony said, closing his eyes.  "And look what happened to them.  Rhodey's in a coma, Pepper has to clean up all my messes, and so does Iron Man."
don't want to hear it," he said, resolutely pushing away the hope Steve's words brought up.  He wasn't that much in denial that he would blindly accept Steve's affection if it was merely a response of guilt or pity.  He would probably be dead in a few hours without a fire, but he didn't need faked romance.
"Something wrong, Captain?" Vision asked. "FRIDAY informed me that you were going through punching bags at an accelerated rate. I thought I should inquire if you needed assistance."
She flew straight at the Skrull, going full throttle.  The speed ripped at her stomach, but she ignored it and tackled her to the ground.
Searing pain, quick and through the heart.  Discipline and dedication.  Light blue and dark brown.  A warrior's spirit burning bright as a bon fire on a winter's night.  Golden yellow rose, just blossoming vibrantly, and a deep, running river with water like ice.  Love and pride.
"I thought that was your job.  No more super villains or villainesses allowed," Tony said.  "You've fallen down on your duty to keep me from them."
"They aren't," Tony said, watching the dragon land.  For such large creatures, dragons were some of the most graceful he had ever seen.  Tony wasn't a biologist, but he didn't think he would ever get tired of watching them move.
Tony froze, his shoulders tensing as he stared blankly at the holograms.  "You know your problem, Rogers?  You overstay your welcome.  You should have left with the 40s."
"Fine and dandy, Capsicle.  But I have more important things to deal with so you're going to have to reschedule this chat so I can ignore it at another time," Stark said, not looking at Steve as he walked.
"I'm going to let you go now, so please don't attack," Steve said, keeping his voice gentle.  Kestrel nodded and tensed, but she did as he said.  When she wobbled to the side, he caught her shoulder, but didn't restrain her again.
"Sometimes I like the burn," Stark replied.  It spoke volumes more about Stark's self-abuse than Steve currently wanted to contemplate.
"It's a date," Steve said, his nostrils flaring.  He lowered his head onto Tony's lap, closing his eyes.  "Can we listen to human music?"
Then there was a hand running through his hair and that was nice.  The warmth slipped away while he was distracted though, and Steve might have whined.
Tony sighed, putting his hands into his pockets.  "It's not one of humanity's better emotions, I'll grant you," he said, staring into the fire.  "It makes me miss my best friend."
Which, of course, he didn't, taking a moment to lay the bed back properly and fixing the I.V. so that Tony wouldn't accidentally rip it out by moving around.  Bastard.  But then Steve was kicking off his shoes and hesitantly lying down next to him.  And Tony, now that he had made up his mind, decided the fact that Steve was still on the edge and putting a respectable space between them was unacceptable.
"She's got a head for math," the woman said fondly, her accent noticeable but not thick.  "You were right, Mr. Stark.  She got the best grade on her test in the whole class."
Rubbing at his forehead, Steve sighed.  "Right under our noses the whole time," he muttered.  "We weren't acting very friendly towards him either."
"Sorry, kiddo.  You've just got an old hologram for backup," Tony said, cutting down a large group with his laser.
"Oh, relax, Cap," Jan said, patting his hand knowingly.  "Hank's cool with it if it keeps him in his lab with his bugs instead of needing to make an appearance.  As long as we're not 'making out like we're having sex' - his words - he's fine with it.  He's not even going to see the movie.  And Scott even promised to give me some lessons in lock picking!"
"Happy, he lives here.  He doesn't need a badge."  Iron Man pulled the man away, then gently pushed him towards the elevator.  "You're not head of security yet.  Just do what Mr. Stark asked and don't bother Pepper too much."
That thought sobered him, killing his curiosity.  As much as he'd like to explore, he wasn't an adventurer any more.  And the War was so long...
"Iron Man came to me with a proposition that I assumed was from Mr. Stark.  Doom will not suffer another tyrant to mimic his technology, especially not one from the future.  I agreed to help decode his message as I have previously dabbled in time travel.  After the message was decoded..."  Doom said, his cold eyes falling on Steve.  "I have no love for you, Captain.  But a world overrun by Hydra would make Latveria a very small footnote in German history."
As you can see, my track record with mythical creatures is really not improving.  Really, you should keep all of them away from me.  I get trigger happy.  They survived in the end though?  Well, Viper's is any one's guess.  She's snakey enough she could have slithered out, I suppose.  The Winter Dragon will not be written by me, but know that a metal wing and cryogenic freezing is horrifically scarring for a dragon who is hurt badly by both and the very first thing Tony does once the conditioning is broken is make a wing that wouldn't hurt Bucky.  There is a happy ending there too.  I'm just, ya know, not even considering writing it because this is just too long as it is.  But anyone else is welcome to it.  XD
"I hate it when that happens," Tony said, frowning a moment.  His eyes went blank before a virtual cup of coffee appeared in front of him.
As soon as the momentum of his roll stopped, Tony pushed himself up and looked for the source of the gun shot.  He ran to Steve despite how the pain in his hip screamed at him to not move, grabbing his gun.  He had to protect Steve.
He heard Rhodey's sigh despite the wind.  He stood next to Tony on the rail, looking out at the ocean below as they bumped shoulders.  Tony could lose himself while he tried to figure out why the color bothered him. He wished Rhodey would just leave him alone.  "There's plenty to say.  You just won't say it.  We're worried about you."
"Hey," Iron Man said, his voice much closer.  Steve didn't start as he felt the gauntlet on his face, but it was a near thing.  "You with me?"
Tony agreed.  He was just about to take off when the ground shook harder than before.  Tony was no stranger to earthquakes, but this was by far the worst he'd been through and he shook in the armor.  He fell, automatically grabbing the edge as more rocks began to fall, crushing the rocks on either side.
Tony didn't lower the gun.  The man was well dressed, but definitely second hand clothes if the worn look was anything to go by.  It was the lack of uniform that threw Tony off.  Now that he had a better look, it was definitely the man from the photographs.  "You're supposed to be dead," Tony said, not letting his guard down.  What if this was a delusion?
The fact that Tony even had to ask him showed just how burned and scarred he was, even if Tony didn't realize it.  "Because you're important to one of my best friends," Steve said, considering his words with care.  "Because you've inspired loyalty from a lot of people despite making it hard to like you.  Because I never really thanked you for helping me calm down earlier.  Because I'd like to change those preconceptions I had about you.  And because I've never been one to back down from a challenge.  Iron Man must have told you that much at least."
It was, thankfully, fairly normal for Tony to question Steve about parts of dragon culture or engineering.  Steve didn't suspect a thing.  "There's a cavern to the east, Steve said, and Tony tried to see in the little remaining light as he looked over his shoulder.  "It's not too far from the gate.  A very short flight," Steve said helpfully.  "We don't go there often unless we need a replacement or a new one.  It's cold in that cave."
Steve tightened his grip on his shield and held out a few seconds longer.  Then he stepped aside, but kept his shield ready if Doom should go back on his word.  Doom walked forward, placing the device on Tony's arc reactor.  He saw Rhodey grip the sides of his chair and it got Steve's hackles up as well, seeing someone so close to the reactor.  He hadn't even known it was in Tony's chest before the fight with Kang, but now he wanted to keep anyone from touching it.
He holstered the gun, then looked back at Viper.  Shell-shocked didn't quite cover it, but she looked close.  "You did the right thing," Tony said, very grateful her bad aim had actually hit the target and not him.  "If you hadn't done it, we both would be dead right now."
"And what are those risks, Tony?" Steve asked, his temper finally getting the better of him.  "Why do you get to decide by yourself?"
Jarvis ruffled his hair.  "And not everything's your own fault either, lad.  You're no Atlas, even if you try to put the world on your shoulders every chance you get."
The pleading in Steve's voice nearly broke his resolve. He may not have actually had a heart, but it felt like it was breaking.  "No can do, Cap.  This is a one-way trip and it's the only way they'll have time.  You know it's true."
"You are a hero among your people,"she continued, pausing in front of a dark ledge that she was eye-level with.  She stood up on her hind legs and pulled out a moss lantern, drawing a circle over her arm.  It reminded Tony of how people genuflect in church.
He pulled Tony into a proper hug as the trembling subsided.  "Is this okay?' he asked.  Steve felt more than saw the nod against his shoulder, so he looked at the pieces of the armor strewn across the floor.  He wondered where Iron Man was, leaving his boss in as many pieces as the armor.  Or had Tony sent him on some other mission with a different armor, collapsing after?
"Hear me out," Steve pleaded.  "I'm sorry.  I hadn't realized...  Tony, I loved you when I was a dragon more than anything.  Maybe it's not the same feeling as a human, but you gave me back what I was missing and
But Cap didn't stop his movements.  Leon expected more of a reaction, and he couldn't help the words that tumbled out after that.  "I know that makes... I'm sorry, sir.  I shouldn't have -"
He grabbed Tony's wrists, stopping him from moving, but Tony still didn't look up.  "Stark," he said warningly, watching Tony's shoulders hunch at the name.
"And you fight it honorably in most cases," Thor admonished.  "But now you would be wise to let it go.  You can talk with him later when you are both calmer."
Steve felt his cheeks flush in shame, but he nodded.  He hadn't meant for his mood to affect the team.  "Alright.  Ice cream and mead it is."
It was another hour before they made it to the temple.  It was tiered, rising up into the canopy with gates and stairs leading to the top.  It looked old, crumbling, and rusted, with trees whose roots straddled the lower gates.  Instead of the usual stone, the temple appeared to be metal based, though it was a metal he couldn't quite place.  That alone was an exciting thought.  It was a pity he'd have to high tail it back instead of taking time to study the new metal.
"I'll leave you to it then," Natasha said.  "Give me a call if there's any trouble."  She hung up before he could reply, which was just as well.
The warm metal of the armor dug into Steve's back and the bushes pricked at him.  The hot dog had a fifty/fifty chance of being decent or not, but he barely tasted it.  Maybe Iron Man didn't love him, but Steve could have this.  He closed his eyes, telling the part of him that was screaming that it wasn't enough to shut up.
"Thanks," Steve replied, pushing aside the embarrassment and feeling of weakness that came from any time Steve sought out Iron Man's comfort.  It still raised his hackles sometimes, but Iron Man...
Tony was pathetically grateful Steve didn't finish that sentence.  As it was, he still felt his heart rate spike, which was ridiculous because he wasn't under the building any more.  Not that knowing how stupid it was stopped any of his other panic attacks, but he wasn't going to give in that easily.  "Is that all you wanted to say?" Tony forced out.
"Well?" Tony asked after he'd finished.  He tapped his fingers against the desk, then stilled when he realized it betrayed his anxiousness.
Steve raised his hand to Tony's face, ignoring the sick feeling he got when Tony flinched away and closed his eyes, preparing for a blow.  Steve didn't hit him.  He would never.  He cupped Tony's face in his hand, using his thumb to brush the water away as he took in the dark bags under Tony's eyes.  The weight of all of this was close to destroying him.
He flushed, but looking down was no longer an option.  Kes only liked girls, but Leon had always been more flexible when it came to genders and Cap...  Well, the original Captain America
"Sam and Tony apparently had a hell of a time finding it," Cap said.  "They never quite forgave me for that.  The shield usually finds its way home eventually."
For a long while Steve didn't respond.  Then, when Tony had resolved himself to making a shelter no matter how exhausted he was tonight, Steve spoke quietly.  "It's warmer with you there.  It doesn't feel as cold.  Before, even with the lava baths, it still felt cold.  But it's different when you're there.  When I couldn't find you earlier..."
"When I was younger, I thought the only way to be useful was to be strong," Cap said, startling Leon out of his thoughts.  "You were right.  I became a super soldier because I needed to fight.  But I...  After James was born, I realized something.  You don't
"Thank you..."  Steve peered at the uniform and tried to recall Airforce ranks.  Those were new to him in this century, and he hadn't given the ranks much attention when there was so much else to learn.  "Sergeant," he finished, hoping he remembered correctly.
Peggy lowered her eyelids in an expression that felt like a frown.  She didn't say anything, however, leading him into the building.  He was grateful for the walking stick now, as dragon buildings were huge and probably required a lot of walking.
Steve was privately glad, if only because Iron Man deserved his privacy.  So did Tony Stark, he reminded himself.  He was a private American citizen.
He pat her head in consolation.  He was getting better at telling when Natasha was messing with him, but it was always good to be sure.  "Have you ever made near-death confessions?" Tony asked after several minutes of companionable silence.
It took all of Steve's willpower not to punch the door and dent it.  He breathed in through his nose, then let it out slowly.  He was practically shaking with rage, but he needed a clear head.  What was it Ms. Potts said?  Swallowing his pride.  Tony had done that on purpose, damn him.  A large part of him resented Stark for that, especially since the issue was forced.  Something was obviously wrong.  As much as Steve wanted to, he couldn't just let that go.
Tony flinched as if Steve's words had been a physical blow.  When he opened his eyes this time, they were dry.  They were also dull and lifeless in a way that sent chills down Steve's spine.  Tony had closed himself off in more ways than one.  "You should go help Thor," he said, making to stand.
"It doesn't have to be the hard things," Steve said.  "You can talk about yesterday, or how annoying Tony is."
Mem: I did say there would be cuddles.  The day I resist cuddles will be the day you know I've been taken over by a Skrull.
The news continued to report the inauguration, and Leon felt even more detached from reality.  Reality wasn't something he understood anymore, not when AIs were the only comfort they had while someone who was the head of the same race that had tortured him and Kes for the past two years was elected President.
The next wall showed dragons of all different colors flying to a great opening - a cavern? - with the last dragon flying up to the sun one last time before heading down.
Steve lowered his shield.  He didn't know if this man was telling the truth.  He certainly seemed futuristic enough, and he appeared to believe what he was saying.  He doubted even Tony could make this kind of technology in his life time.  If it were true and the world got destroyed because of him...  he would have to stand down.
Tony rubbed his forehead.  "I... it's alright.  I shouldn't have snapped.  I really don't mind, as long as I can see you coming."  He could brace the walls if he had warning, and that was about as good as he was getting as long as he stayed with telepathic dragons.
Steve's ears suddenly felt very hot.  "You, ah, might want to put the face plate down before you go out," he said a little sheepishly.
They were beautiful.  It was simple line art with multicolored inks that spanned the whole page.  The crystals on the cavern ceiling shone brilliantly in a way that made Tony feel warm just looking at it, with two dragons soaring on the last rays of the crystal's light. One was blue like Steve, the other was a shining silver.
"I won't give up then," Steve said as he raised his chin and made a mental promise.  "All I have to do is wait it out until he trusts me, right?  Mr. Stark is important to Iron Man, and to all of us as well.  I'll do it."
"Okay," Steve said, turning Tony's hand over and kissing his palm.  "Dinner and flowers first.  Then going back to the Tower."
"The repulsors won't work the way they should," Tony grumbled, feeling Steve's fingers dance across his neck.
fly," Steve said, grudging admiration for the metal machine making its way through him.  There was no small amount of wonder for Tony either, the man who'd made it.  "And you don't mind that it's all metal?  Is it magic?"
"Who am I to deny a lady?"  He compiled a mental list.  He may not date as many men, but he remembered enough and he had a knack for faces and names.
Tony could see his tail trembling and pain in the line of his wings.  He tried to stand and Tony put his gun away to rest a hand on Steve's shoulder.  "Shh...  Steve, stay down.  You're okay."
, Tony's mind supplied.  Of course Steve wouldn't want that regret again.  "Even with the fights?" Tony asked.  Because they had been so good, that first month before everything backfired after a bad mission.  But Tony wasn't sure he could handle having all of that if only to have it taken away again.
It was hot, but not too bad under the green.  Tony figured he was sweating more because of carrying Viper than the heat, though thankfully she was much lighter than Pepper.  Not that he'd tell Pepper that.
Steve did not glare at Sam, because that would constitute as sulking and he refused to dignify that with an answer. Given how Sam started to laugh harder, it didn't work as well as Steve had hoped.
"It's not like it's the first time.  I should take this into account the next time I run statistics, that Avengers have higher than usual averages," Tony said, plowing right through Steve's attempt.
"You could have gotten yourself killed," Tony muttered, leaving the dragon behind to retreat past the gate.  He needed to get back to work.  The war waits for no man.
"Good," Tony said, burrowing against Steve again.  "Now go back to sleep and don't leave this time."
"You don't have to do this," Tony forced himself to say, not thinking of the tentacles as he swallowed back the bile.  At least he was in the armor this time.  "Why are you following Hydra?  You have to know what they do in their experiments!  Why go from big game stealing to them?"
Tony batted his hand away, his own hands almost, but not quite, forming fists.  "I made the suit.  It. Failed.  It's the most sophisticated manned armor outside of the Iron Man suit and only then because the idiot never comes around for upgrades often enough.  It still wasn't enough to protect him."
"You don't have to," Steve said cautiously.  The others had been warned of some of Tony's boundaries, and they had all been careful to include him even without Steve's prompting when he came up instead of Iron Man.  The others all seemed to have picked up on Tony's uneasiness, and Steve hadn't needed to say anything beyond what Bruce had originally warned him with: give Tony space when he needed it.
Tony hadn't been able to think of them.  Though whether he'd been fighting the suggestion or whatever mind-clouding drugs they had given him, he didn't know.
Tony smiled, giving her a sloppy salute.  "Don't push yourself too hard to walk on it.  I'll be back in a few days with your new dragon crystal."
"I'm fine," Tony said as they both pushed him away from the temple.  A little bruised and honestly, he'd had better emotional days, but mostly fine.  "I'm okay.  Just like I promised.  Are you-"
"Why?" Steve asked, not sure if he was asking why he had to stay back or why Tony had become Iron Man.
This was a private conversation, Steve realized.  Really private.  His mother, bless her, would have boxed his ears for listening in.  He should stand up or cough, or do something to alert the two men that he was there.
"Alright," Steve said, telling his own body very firmly to calm down.  They'd been taking things rather slow, considering, and it wouldn't be all that bad to wait on that promise a while longer.
"You should be paying attention to your surroundings," Tony said as he looked at the button thoughtfully.  "And my gut says it is.  I've been in enough forgotten temples to know a secret passage when I see it.  I just need to figure out
Tony didn't have a chance to wiggle off before Steve vaulted into the air.  Riding on his front was one of the worst ideas Steve had, because little scales dug into his stomach as he tried to find it again.
"The mural there revealed itself to you.  It showed you our history.  Come.  I will show you a better memory," Wanda said.
Slowly Steve's tail unwound from Tony's waist.  He rubbed his cheek against Tony's before pulling away.  "Stay in contact," Steve said.  "I'll look in when I can, but I need to keep an eye out here in case of attack."
"I have a suspicion based on a lot of circumstantial evidence, some of which the public is not privy to," Fury said.  "It's an educated guess at best, if one I'm banking a lot on.  But Iron Man or Tony Stark knowing that I know?  The trouble that would cause isn't worth the certainty.  And they would find out.  Stark's case has already been too mishandled for more mistakes."
Stark shook it mournfully.  "How do you like that, drinking a man's whiskey without saving the parched man a drop."
"Not the time, honey," Tony said, checking on his cub scout.  Rhodey was hanging in there, but even with support she wasn't going to make it like this.
"And how do I know it's not another dream?" Tony asked, anger slipping into his voice.  "And don't tell me to flip a coin."
"That's one thing that's different," Steve said.  "You didn't have it in the vision. We've already changed it, even if just a little."
"Most stubborn, pig-headed man he's met," Tony muttered, then walked toward the mess of wires and picked up the silver helmet.  Something about him was more closed off now, and Steve wondered if he'd said the wrong thing.  "I need to fix this.  Make it better.  You go to bed, Rogers.  I'll follow in a bit."
Tony laughed.  It was a small, hysterical little thing that sounded a bit too much like a sob, but it was genuine.  The sheer amount of stubborn rolling off Steve brooked no arguments, and Tony was too tired to even try.
Sharon leaned in close to him and Tony just barely remembered not to flinch when her claw came up to his cheek.  He reached out and touched hers, then kissed her claw as well, because a beautiful lady deserved to be flattered.  He was pretty sure she was beautiful for a dragon.  He knew from Pepper not to imply otherwise.
How strange life was.  Tony had had many adventures in his life, but none of them ever quite prepared him for having a picnic with two dragons under the crust of the earth.
"I can use other means to find out," Natasha said casually, and he knew that wasn't a threat of violence.  "I don't want to, but you're driving me and the team crazy, and that will start to affect the team work."
"Ow," Tony said, rubbing his nose.  He glared at the branch that had whacked him because he wasn't paying attention.
"Pull back," Steve ordered, catching his shield and driving it into the chest of the nearest robot.  "Keep an escape route open for me in case things get too hot, but I won't let them have the warehouse."
"Steve," Iron Man said, much closer but still a respectful distance away.  "Talk to me, old man.  What's the bee in your bonnet?"
Any thought of saying something tonight left Steve as Tony entered the kitchen in a suit and tie, looking like death had warmed over.  "You okay?" Steve asked, half-rising from his seat.
He missed JARVIS. Talking with FRIDAY or Vision was a bit bitter-sweet. Vision was both JARVIS and not JARVIS in ways Steve only half-understood but accepted, and FRIDAY was a personality of her own. It wasn't the same anymore, and hearing her less formal speech reminded him of what they'd lost.
," Steve said, curling tightly around him.  He felt Steve's breath in his hair as the dragon rested his head atop Tony's.  Tony felt the emotions rushing through him as Steve spoke, each one leaving him more shaken than the last.  "You're so clever and brilliant.  Half the things I see in your head I could never even begin to understand.  And you're strong.  You never let defeat stop you, always finding a new angle and doing anything to make it right, no matter the cost.  You keep fighting even when you feel like you can't anymore.  And after everything I've seen in your memories, you still care.  You're a good person."
, Tony reminded himself.  His husband had done this plenty of times when they'd been alive, and Tony had never minded it before.  He'd welcomed it, even.
"This time will be different," Leon told her.  He was wearing the braces that Tony and Susan had made for him, and he held the energy shield the two of them and Kestrel collaborated on.
Bright red and navy blue, passion and flame, dancing and music.  The rose that blooms in adversity and the immutable constant of the sea.   Loss.  Fury.
Though if he were being honest, he was a little glad.  Something about the temple gave him the creeps.
"I'm sorry," Tony said again, curling up against the wall of the pit as best he could.  The crystals were hard and cold against his back, but he was shivering less.  "You should..."
Steve immediately missed her presence, because the tension from earlier came back so quickly it was like it had never left.
Natasha hmmed.  "I'd agree.  That at least sounded more like Stane's profile than Stark's, but Iron Man may have had a hand in what happened to Stane.  There was something Stark was hiding that I could have gotten if I had more than a week to crack him.  He kept his cards extremely close to his chest."
"No to my offer or no to the death wish?" Stark asked.  "I'll admit, I'd rather it be the latter, if you don't mind.  I'd miss our nightly escapades."
He looked around the blank walls of the cavern again with a new-found wariness.  He shivered.  He had no explanation for the visions Wanda had shown him.  She could have seen from his memories about the murals in the gate cavern, but he had barely thought of them since he met the dragons personally, despite seeing them nearly every day.  And those visions didn't feel like they had come from Wanda either, though he couldn't have said how he knew that.
He nodded, accepting the terms.  "Then what say you to some breakfast and then heading out to get started?"
Steve just smiled, his eyes gentle and kind with a focus on Tony that made him shiver as he felt Steve's breath against his lips.  "Thank you, Tony."
It still stung, that Steve hadn't stayed around.  Tony didn't know what all this bonding situation was about, but leaving the others to explain to him and not being there... it hurt a lot more than Tony wanted to admit.
That must have been the mistake Fury wanted him to correct, Steve realized.  The one Phil regretted.  "I don't understand.  Why did that turn out to be such a bad thing?"
Tony snorted, not looking up from the game as he kept his shoulders from hunching over.  "Never would have guessed."  Steve certainly had looked tortured the last time he'd seen him.
Tony would have flicked her off, but he was more mature than that.  Not that he didn't love that side of Tony, no matter how much he tried to hide it under disapproval.  Tony usually only acted that badly when someone had struck first, and he did it because he didn't care what they thought of him.  Steve envied that a little, since as Captain America he couldn't do that.  And he may or may not have a thing for Tony's grin when he'd turn around after doing something outrageous, his brown eyes positively gleaming with smugness.  And how expressive Tony would get with his hands and...
You did, didn't you?  No more soap operas for you, Steve," she teased.  "We'll sort you out when I get back.  One thing I do know about Stark is that he's had threesomes before."
"Captain America would never work with a dictator!" Steve said, fighting to keep the smile from over coming his mock outrage.  "But Steve Rogers knows tactics and that you can't always do something by yourself.  What do you think?"
that ate away at your soul until there was nothing left.  And grief didn't get better for sharing it, but being alone in grief was worse.  He had done himself no favors by closing up about it, and for someone who was brave enough to show their grief openly, Steve could only try not to let them down.
Steve breathed out in relief.  At least it wasn't that.  He hesitated, torn between his anger at Tony's words and worry that Tony had been purposefully pushing him away.  He could feel the small tremors in Tony's body, and Steve acted without thinking.  He pulled Tony closer into a tight hug.
"He's over there," Tony pleaded.  "We can't...  We have to bring him with us."  He couldn't leave Steve alone in the cold cave.  The least he could do was bury him properly somewhere warm.
He carefully traced Tony's goatee up his cheek, the intimacy of their position making his stomach drop.  In trouble he might be, but ready for something like this?  Steve remembered all too well the sting of Iron Man's rejection.  And if Iron Man were out of his league, Tony Stark was about as touchable as the stars in the sky.
He looked down at his bloody knuckles.  He'd started out with gymnastics and strength training to avoid the punching bags, but he gravitated towards them eventually.  He knew his hands should hurt, but he couldn't feel the pain.  He couldn't look away from the red staining the white of the wrap.
and Tony felt small and inadequate next to him. Steve was smart and funny and all of the dragons here loved him.  He worked so hard for the city all his life when Tony had spent most of his life doing nothing but searching for a cure to his failing heart.  Steve made him want to be better.
Steve swallowed down bile and focused on breathing.  He coughed, glad nothing came up.  Clutching at his shield, he pushed himself up just in time to meet another blast.  It caught the shield, but still sent him flying.
He could only assume that the sound Iron Man made was a whistle, though it was wildly distorted by the armor.  "It's almost like Nick doesn't trust you not to go anyway," Iron Man said, more humor in his voice than Steve felt.  "So why didn't you call
"Oh, Tony," Pepper said, her gauntleted hand going to her mouth as her eyes looked suspiciously wet.
"Yeah, yeah," Rhodey said, and Steve was almost jealous of the warmth he heard in that voice.  It had been so long since someone had spoken with that sort of fondness towards him.  "Alright.  Get your coffee, then we can head up for that sake you promised me."
"I was scared," Steve admitted, his tail reaching back towards Tony before it stopped and curled around Steve miserably.
"Right here," Steve said with a shrug, holding up his hand with the ring.  "I still love you.  That wasn't affected by the changes."
Natasha nodded and Clint threw him a sloppy salute before they both left Steve to the gym equipment.  He'd always known Iron Man's loyalties would cause a problem.  He just hadn't thought the betrayal would come from his end.
Tony jumped, the knife slipping through his fingers.  Steve wasn't entirely sure how it happened, but suddenly there was blood on the cutting board and Tony was swearing.
Peggy and Sharon were waiting for him when he came out, their necks tangled together and curled up to each other.  Peggy's wings draped protectively over Sharon, and Sharon looked up at Peggy as if the moon itself hung on her shoulders.  Not that the dragons had ever seen the moon.  It wasn't hard to see how much they adored each other, and Sam had told him their bond was one of the strongest in the city.  "You two cozy over there?" he asked.
He'd never seen them dead and defeated before, not even when Tony'd been exhausted and worried about Rhodes.  The fact that Steve had been the one to put that expression there twisted at his stomach and left a knot in his throat that wouldn't dissolve.
"You're a failure," Zemo said.  "But not for much longer.  Soon you will take over as the next Zemo, and Hydra will make sure you will succeed for us."
Whatever was going on, he needed to put Viper from his mind for now and strengthen his mental walls.  He had a promise to keep.  Regardless of if he trusted the dragons or not, keeping her secret wouldn't do any harm.
Then again, Tony could probably do a lot better than a fire.  He cursed mentally, his thoughts too sluggish to hit upon the obvious answer.  "I'll call the suit then and get us out."
He spent the afternoon learning more about dragon culture and not thinking about his failing heart.  Dragons didn't really cook food, so much as slice it and marinate it with spices Tony could only half-recognize.  Which made eating interesting, as Tony had to stick to non-meats.  He'd tried raw fish in Japan (before the War, before everything was complicated and the world wasn't as dark; the relations between countries had been strained, but things had been brighter), but the red meat the dragons favored probably wouldn't sit well.  Peggy promised a better selection tomorrow, since dragons took their guests' comfort seriously.
He looked like a whole slew of other thoughts that Tony needed to push away.  Because feelings for Steve weren't something Tony could entertain anymore.  Anymore?  Where did that-
Tony took a moment to admire the dragon's aerodynamics.  They were elegant creatures in flight, but he had a feeling the brown dragon excelled at it.  And the fact he knew that felt both strange and intrusive.
"Not a monster hydra.  It's a group of humans, top-side.  A very bad group," Tony said.  He shook his head, trying to clear his head.  None of these were good memories.  "They're the ones I'm trying to stop from finding this place."
"I nearly lost you," Steve said finally, his voice a soft whisper in the quiet of the room.  "Except I had already done that.  I'd lost you because I was being stubborn about the wrong things."
He glanced up to see Steve's eyes closed as the other man took a deep breath to calm, whether to calm his anger or to fortify himself for what he was about to say, Tony couldn't tell.
What he needed was some advice, he decided the next day.  He woke up from nightmares early that morning, but instead of going out for a run, he brainstormed.  Unfortunately, he came up with nothing.  JARVIS, as he suspected, was also reluctant to help in this case, though he apologized for the inability.  In lieu of a proper plan, he needed to find someone else to talk to.  He walked into the common rooms later in the day and was a little dismayed to find only Thor and Clint watching television.  He'd been hoping for Natasha or Bruce, since they seemed to know Stark the best.  Still, beggars can't be choosers, and with Iron Man still gone, he had to start somewhere.
That was his handwriting on some of the notes, but he'd never been consulted about a vita-ray machine.  "Nope.  I've never seen any of this before," he said, flipping to the next page.
"Oh," Steve said.  He felt a little taken aback by the admission and his wings fluttered out.  "Is that normal for humans?"
, Capsicle."  Tony said, walking up to him and pushing on Steve's chest.  Steve stood firm, not rocking back as Tony made shooing motions.  "You want to blame me for Romanov and Barton, fine.  Just do it elsewhere.  Vamoose."
"You're going to have to talk to me," Steve said after careful consideration of his words.  He promised himself he'd back off this time though if Tony said.  "Is it Doom?  What does he have over you?"
He started to realize he had no idea where Iron Man was hiding.  He looked around, the garden thankfully not too torn up by their fight.  "Iron Man?" he called out softly.
Tony snorted, but Steve pressed on.  "I mean that," he said, feeling at a loss.  "I'm...  I don't always deal well with the future.  You know that."
Steve wasn't part of the group.  He could be, but he still didn't know what he wanted to say to Tony.  He slipped away to the elevator, going down to the Avengers' common area to change.  He ended up grabbing his sketchbook instead of his gym bag and wound up at the door to Tony's workshop.  He needed to be on the plane to Latveria just in case Doom was lying, but part of him didn't want to leave the Tower now that Tony was awake.  Doom had said Natasha and Clint had been let go, and while he didn't trust Doom that much, he should at least give them some time to contact him so as not to antagonize Doom further if he were telling the truth.
"Recognized the style when someone shared a picture on Facebook.  The S.R. initials also gave it away," Tony muttered, this time the pout unmistakable.  "I had to find out through
"You could help people again," Steve said, knowing his face was flushed from the drink but not caring.  Tony'd never see it in the darkness anyway.  He kept his grip on Tony's arm.
Then there was also the fact that Tony had issues.  Steve had only brushed the surface of them.  Their talk last night had been fun, but light.  Howard hadn't come up and Steve had taken pains to keep it that way, but that was baggage they would eventually have to deal with, regardless of if they were friends or more.
"And that's not why you're not sulking either," Clint said, soft enough that it was likely he meant not to be heard.  Steve heard it anyway and mentally added more strenuous exercises to Clint's training routine.  Captain America was above being petty.  Steve Rogers was not.
It was over far too quickly though, Steve's expression closing off only seconds later.  Tony hadn't known about how Steve and Sharon had just called it quits, or about Steve dating Sharon at all.  He had known about the Winter Soldier baggage, but he'd been impatient.  He'd rushed in like always and ruined things once again.
he'd been lied to.  Awed that this man who had been dismissed by everyone had been saving them all along.  Angry at himself for being one of those people when he should have known better, considering how often he'd been dismissed himself before the serum.
"Internal bleeding was stopped and the blood transfusion was successful.  He just..."  Tony's voice cracked, but he pushed on.  "He's not waking up.  Coma, they said."
"Steve?" Tony said, though he didn't move away.  His eyes were wide in surprise, and Steve thought that he heard Tony's breath hitch.
Pacing had done nothing to help the adrenaline rushing through his veins.   He strode to the elevator, not sure where he was going, but needing to go somewhere.  "JARVIS, where is Tony?" he snapped.
.  He doesn't have my issues.  He can be friendly, he can crack corny jokes, and he can be on a team.  He can save the world and be a good guy.  I don't know if you've noticed, but none of those describe me."
"Have either of you eaten?" Steve asked instead, deciding it was high time he stepped up if he was going to battle those feelings.
It was worse than what Steve had been picturing.  He'd rather Tony had been making weapons again at Doom's insistence.  He couldn't...  Steve swallowed around the lump in his throat.  He couldn't lose Tony now.
The pain in his chest reminded him he didn't have time to wallow in nostalgia.  He allowed himself one last shallow breath as he chided himself for that terrible vice, then he raised his hands, searching for the hidden catches that would trigger the emergency release.  Rhodey had insisted on that one, and Tony hadn't even put up a token protest.  The last thing he needed was the suit to become a coffin.
Steve took a deep breath and winced.  He continued to listen to the chatter, to Iron Man's voice.  It did seem a little flatter than usual, but otherwise it was like their fight had never happened.  That hurt more.
it...  Tony felt something in his chest flutter.  Steve wasn't throwing disapproval his way, but open acceptance.
"I won't look if you don't want me to," Steve said firmly.  "Though I might...  That will take some getting used to for me, but I'll try to remember to ask next time.  I know it's difficult for you."
"I am going to stop you from making it worse before you go out there," Tony said, cutting him off.  "If he were in that much trouble, you would have already gone to him, not break into my workshop with your damned
"Put enough Skrulls where people will listen and create enough fear, and voila! The universe's biggest asshole as president," Tony said.  "We've seen it happen before, minus the green skin.  Does no one read Santayana?"
It was still a shock.  Steve hadn't had a  lot of time to sit and think about it.  All those times in the library, that had been
"Tony?  Tony!  Stay awake," Steve said, gripping Tony's shoulder's painfully.  "What did you mean, stick to the plan?"
" she shouted as light surrounded the Skrull's body.  She fired a repulsor, but it was too late.  Kor'la'vin was gone, and that wasn't the short-range transporter.  Susan hit the side of the train with her fist, closing her eyes when the lights of the HUD started to blur.
"Not that one, no.  That one's for me," Steve said, pulling the covers over them as Tony's lips brushed over his neck.
"Do not think I will forget this," Doom said, his voice hard and cold as his metal suit.  "But his secret is safe for now.  I have come only to honor my agreement.  It is well that he succeeded in his task finally."
"I did not - I'm not short, Winghead!  Just because you are all ridiculously tall does not mean I'm not a respectable height!"
a big deal.  Not a date sort of big deal, but meeting your crush's good friend sort of deal.   He wasn't doing this to get back in Iron Man's good graces of course, but a small part of him was very aware that this could either make his current relationship with Iron Man much better, or much, much worse.  He respected Iron Man's choice, but he also wouldn't be opposed to Iron Man changing his mind if this went well.
"Because it's your armor," Susan said.  "You're the one who should be wearing it, not me.  Iron Man is the Stark family legacy, so I can... I'll wait until we can-"
The airman snapped to a salute as his eyes widened in recognition.  "I-uh, I'm a big fan, sir," he said, then stumbled over his words.  "I mean, if you'll come this way I can take you to Mr. Stark.  He thought you might prefer a ride."
"The Red Skull's notes were very clear on how the dragons reacted to metal," Viper said.  "If you don't charge it, we will tear your dragon apart piece by piece until he dies, and you will follow soon after.  I can bring back the suit, even if you prove too unreasonable."
He slowly shone the light around the cavern after locking down the suit, fascinated by the detail on the wall.  It was a mural of bright colors and fantastical creatures.  Taking care of his bad leg, he limped over to the nearest one, running his hand over the smoothed stone.  "Dragons, huh?  I'll be.  Or should I say, by George?"  It had to be what Hydra was after. He directed the light to the ceiling to check if he could expect company, then bit his lip.  Those were a lot of rocks that he was surprised hadn't fallen on top of him.  "Not getting out that way.  Then let's see what we have here?"
"But I..."  Susan said, telling herself firmly not to cry.  This was an easy mission.  Kes always laughed and called her a crybaby, but Kes wasn't here right now.  And if Susan messed this up, she'd be just like the resistance leader who...
"I shouldn't have let you come down," he heard Tony mutter.  Then, louder and sharper in what made Steve assume he wasn't supposed to hear the first part, he said, "What do you want, Steve?"
Steve grabbed his wrist with his good hand.  It was easy to keep the already wobbly Tony down with him.  "I'm sorry," Steve said.  "That wasn't... I shouldn't have lashed out at you like that."
The drawing probably wasn't one of his better ones.  It was Iron Man with a spotlight on him, waving at the crowd, his body language what Steve generally associated with Iron Man being happy.  He had the feeling that part of the drawing wasn't what Tony was staring at though, but Iron Man's shadow.  Tony Stark, dark and shaded, looked up from the ground at Iron Man in the spotlight, the same dull expression on his face that Steve had seen when he had refused to trust Tony.
"I'm sorry," Tony said, his throat feeling dry.  It didn't seem to matter.  Even as a bonded link he was a disappointment.  Steve had left right after the bonding and...
"Oh, come on, Steve," Jan said before Tony could buckle under Steve's disappointed face.  "It's harmless.  Besides, look at my costume designs!  I'm going to look fabulous."
Steve couldn't quite believe what he was hearing.  "I don't usually take commissions, but isn't that price a little low?"
"This isn't over," Steve said, but he pulled his phone out of his pocket and answered.  He didn't recognize the number.  "Hello?"
"Love is love," Peggy said, curling her tail about Tony's feet comfortingly as she proved he hadn't hidden his thoughts quickly enough.  "Do humans not agree?"
Walking down the hall, he was surprised to find a light on in the library that wasn't far from his room.  He debated if he wanted to talk to anyone in his current state, but curiosity got the better of him.  Besides, he didn't condone waste, even if he was living in a tower that ran off of renewable green energy.  He had to check if someone had forgotten to turn it off.
Finally, they reached the balcony.  There was still a bit of haze and the lights from the city clouded the view, but the stars could be seen easily enough.  He heard Steve suck in a breath beside him.
"He does," Kes said, smiling again.  She looked softer in the garage's harsh lights, her smile gaining a gentle melancholy Susan sometimes saw, but never understood.  "But even if he's my brother, no one gets to hurt you and get away with it, understand?"
It wasn't fair.  Steve blinked back a strange pin-needle feeling in his eyes.  It wasn't Tony's fault.  From the sound of it, Steve himself had probably done something reckless once he found out, if the only times that Steve ended up dead were the ones where he'd been told.  But Tony was blaming himself, not Steve.  Tony was dying because Steve hadn't fought well enough, because the serum hadn't been enough.  It was no different from Bucky, and the familiar feeling of helplessness welled up as he watched this future version of Tony Stark step up where Steve had failed.
He had to shift again at the next picture of Wanda and Natasha. They were both clothed, but he was still pretty sure that wasn't decent and again, he really didn't need to be thinking about his teammates like that. "Why would I post on this site?" Steve asked.
"Can't argue with that," Steve said.  How awkward could it be?  Extremely, no doubt, but as long as he had Ms. Potts and Tony there too, it shouldn't be too bad, right?  It was just an old lady.  He could handle an old lady.
or anything, but Steve was not going to mess-up his first kiss with Tony.  He could always do more research later.  He kept it short and sweet, lingering on Tony's lips only a second longer than he thought he should have.
Instead of hitting him, the man raised his hand and stopped the shield in mid-air.  That wasn't a good sign.  "Who are you?" Steve asked.
"Why are you in the Iron Man suit?" Steve asked faintly, because he was going to have to rethink his opinions of CEOs and fighting now.  He could only vaguely take in the cuts and bruises on her cheek, registering that she had seen some action, Iron Man or not.
Steve pulled off his undershirt as he reached his door, grabbing the uniform and slipping it on.  "Have everyone get out there stat.  I'll join them in the quinjet in five."
The camera went back to Tony, who was leaning against the wall, pale and fragile-looking.  "Kang...  He came from the future to kill Steve.  He thought Steve would destroy the world during the Skrull invasion, but neither the Skrulls nor the Kree stood a chance against his technology.  He'll come to kill Steve, and he will succeed.  He has succeeded."
"Maybe not, but please understand that outside of an actual business meeting, most people do," she said, leveling him with a glare.  "And if you do, you will never get another meeting outside of societal functions that require the presence of both of you, and I will work hard to make sure that doesn't happen often."
"Oh," Steve said, feeling a little foolish.  Then lightheaded, because Tony hadn't actually tried to pull away.  "We could go back to the Tower and-"
"That's... reassuring," Steve said, though he didn't sound very sure.  "But why would a hydra need armor like that?"
She looked alright, no visible bruises or cuts.  Just tired and rumpled, which was probably how they all felt right now.  "I'm actually upgraded to the museum of science and technology," Steve replied, turning the phone to show her the Mark VIII.
Steve had worried quite a lot about Tony coming down.  He had warned both Bruce and Thor to have patience, because Tony was still working on his defensiveness.  There was Tony's own reluctance to consider too.
He was surprised to hear a familiar voice in the hallway, but grateful for the mechanized timbre.  "-let anyone know.  It sucks, but we can't raise the alarm.  Which is why I need you there for the extra protection."
"Cap nap's over, Winghead," the voice said, but now it was different.  A warm gauntlet slid behind his back.
Stark shook the bottle temptingly, holding it out for him.  Steve sighed, grabbing it and throwing it back as he'd seen Stark do numerous times.  His eyes prickled as it burned his throat.  He coughed as he put it down, Stark petting him on the back.  "'s strong," Steve said once his throat had recovered.  "Blazes, Stark.  Ain't you got smoother whiskey?"
The woman ran a hand through her short hair.  "He saved my brother," she said.  "And you guys save the world and the city enough times.  It's the least I could do."
"Man, you don't know the half of it," Rhodey said.  "Thing is, he gets proven right more often than not and is significantly more prone to meeting and trusting the wrong people than anyone I've ever met.  It's caused him to come off as arrogant and self-assured just to protect himself."
He let Pepper and Rhodey fuss, considering his options.  They'd probably let him out of the hospital soon, since Captain 'Ted Striker' apparently could jump out of a plane without hurting an unconscious team mate despite a bad case of PTSD, even if the same couldn't be said for Steve himself.  It said far more about Steve's experiences with jumping out of planes than Tony really cared to think about.
He had to remind himself not to hold his breath.  He couldn't help Tony if he didn't want it.  He couldn't force Tony to trust him.  It was all up to Tony now, and as much as it killed him, this would only work if Tony was trying too.
"He's..." Tony said, freezing.  Then his shoulders slumped.  "He's trying to trace the robots back to their source with some other leads, but he's not having much luck."
"I'm stopped," Tony said, holding his hands up in submission, though he kept the firewall running.  She didn't seem to mind that, not looking up from the screen she was using to monitor the computer's activity.
There was a chair next to Stark that Steve took, sighing inwardly.  "A little less worried about you being in danger now," Steve replied, then looked at the man on the bed.   He had to be important for Tony to come all the way out here.
"Like I said, human error.  That I know loads about," Tony said, staring down into his electronic coffee without drinking it.  "Iron Man was a way to... balance that out.  Correct my mistakes and help people, rather than destroying lives."
"Doom's been surprisingly, if grudgingly, decent to us," Natasha finished, moving the phone back to herself.  "Didn't want to trust his transport though.  We're on the outskirts of Latveria and should be back soon."
"Of course," Tony said, intentionally not thinking of every lecture from Rhodey and Jarvis about being reckless.  He got the feeling Steve knew anyway.
"No," Tony said, finding strength in the anger that coursed through his veins.  "No.  Wanda said there was still hope.  That means... I don't know.  I'm still doing something wrong, but I'll fix it.  I'm not letting that mural tell me my destiny!"
'Call blocked' read the blocky letters on the tablet, Latveria in smaller letters to denote the call's destination.  "I thought Doom was working with us?" Steve asked.
"You do it all the time.  It's just like when you were with Wanda, but I still heard what you said."
Rubbing his forehead, Steve huffed out a soft laugh.  When had either Tony Stark or Iron Man ever made things easy on him?
"Doesn't matter," a third voice said, deep and warm.  Tony was startled to find a third dragon joining them.  This one was brown, with horns, and some kind of bird's crest on his chest.  When had he snuck up?
"You're seeing this because you're Number Nine," Tony continued.  "That's right.  You've failed eight times.  Look around."
"Is that what this is about?" Steve asked, temper getting the better of him.  "Your pride at failing?"
It wasn't much of a kiss.  Tony had definitely done better before, and he was a little ashamed of his technique now.  But he didn't try to gain access or lick his way into Steve's mouth.  Just a gentle brush of his chapped lips against Steve's smooth ones.  It had an intimacy to it that sent shivers down his spine as he pulled away.  It was different from the dream kiss.  It felt...
"I think it's pretty terrific," Steve said, earning him a place as Tony's favorite.  "It lets humans fly."
Kang charged after him, leading with a punch that was choreographed and easy to duck under.  He grabbed Kang's arm as it swung at him, leveraging it on his shoulder and using Kang's weight to toss him over.
"You are, Smithsonian," Stark said, knocking Steve's hand away.  His brown eyes were hard and angry.  "Because I was supposed to be
He hated it when people called his bluff.  This was why he preferred to threaten and stall rather than bluff.  Tony turned to Steve, who for one second dropped the act, long enough to show Tony the
Steve rubbed his forehead and sighed, ignoring how she automatically reached up to fix his hair that he'd mussed.  "It's not a date like that."
when Steve had been half-asleep.  It also felt more stinging like a rejection than Steve cared to think about.
"Steve!" he said, poking the dragon's cheek and swallowing around the giant block in his throat.  "Steve, sweetheart, I need you to wake up.  I need you to open those baby blues for me.  Steve, please!"
"Tony's the one you want to hide that fact from, not me," Cap said.  "He's always had... a difficult relationship with the shield, due to it being made by his father.  For me, the shield was sometimes a part of me, like an extension of myself.  But other times, it was a responsibility.  One I wasn't always strong enough... or
He owed those people, the ones whose only crime was existing.   He needed to be helping them, because what good was a broken body like his if he couldn't use it to make up for the wasted time?
Tony nodded.  "Do whatever you want to do with whoever you want to do it with," he said, thinking back to her words on his ill-fated birthday.  If he'd actually been listening, that birthday might have gone better for all involved.
He leaned over to look for one without fractures when something hard hit him in the back of the head and he fell forward, knocked out cold.
"You'd really rather..." Steve started to say, then stopped.  "I don't like that part of me any more than you do."
Steve listened to the science talk without really taking in the words.  He knew it was important, but it would go over his head without a lot of reading.  Instead he looked over to the unusually quiet Thor who was frowning lightly down at the phone Stark insisted they all have when they moved in.
There was the Tony of Steve's memories, the one he married and raised two children with.  Steve was struck suddenly by how much he
The former came from Clint, the latter from Iron Man.  "Is there something else?" Steve said, worry spiking again.
He was interrupted by his phone, which surprisingly played a normal ring tone.  Steve would have expected something different.  He didn't know what exactly, maybe some modern song or something with a bit more personality?  But not the standard ring tone he heard from half a dozen other phones.
"You won't," Tony said, realizing with a start that he wasn't shivering as much.  That was a bad sign.  "Everyone will be there when you wake up.  Trust me, Cap.  They'll keep looking for you."
Claws gently gripped his shoulders before he could act.  His stomach dropped away as Steve launched himself into the air as rocks started to fall from the ceiling in earnest.  Fear gripped him as pain seared through Steve's shoulder.  Steve was making it worse.  "Stop!  Steve, you can't-"
"That wouldn't help everyone else with the same problem," Steve said, closing his eyes.  "But thanks."
Steve's shoulders rose with a deep breath before he continued.  "What they did...  I'm sorry they used me to - I never really thought of you like that."
"I..." Leo said, and he looked dangerously close to tears.  "I'm not much beyond the shield, so I..."
"Agent Coulson," Rhodey said, his voice strained.  "Don't get me wrong.  I don't like to speak ill of the dead, and he did a lot to protect Tony.  He didn't even tell SHIELD.  But that press conference was a mistake, and we all knew it.  He wouldn't listen to us and only realized after Tony woke up and heard the news.  I've never quite forgiven the man for that."
"I'll keep that in mind," Tony said politely, wondering if he was required to do the cheek greeting he had done with Peggy.
"The plan to get out of this cave," Tony said, because that was obvious, wasn't it?  "Yinsen was bad at following plans too.  He...  I hate caves."
Steve could fill them in himself.  Prisoners of that much importance tended to be moved separately to prevent them from breaking out.  Which meant the twins had found some leverage to keep them together.  Or, more likely, one of them was being threatened to keep the other in line.  He tightened his grip around Tony but kept a straight expression that wouldn't betray his thoughts.  It would only worry Susan more, and there was currently nothing they could do about it.  And the hope that was currently in her eyes was too welcome a sight after what had recently happened.
Steve's tail flicked around Tony's feet and he was surprised by the protective feeling he got from the dragon.  "Not here, they won't."
"Yup.  You've got a package in your room from Mr. Stark.  Updated uniform.  Looks just the same as before but with better protection.  Should be able to withstand alien blasts now."
Steve stopped, his jaw dropping open. He swallowed, feeling a blush spread across his face. "People draw stuff like this about us?" he asked, his voice cracking.
"A year ago," Tony replied.  "They forced it to heal wrong.  We don't have the facilities to fix it here, either."
She held up what looked like a Handy Talkie, a device completely out of place with the rest of her priestess outfit.  It looked smaller than the United Nations' devices, and he narrowed his eyes at it.  He didn't like it when the enemy had better tech than him.
To his surprise (and secret pleasure), Steve came over to him.  He made sure Tony was watching, then leaned down to rub against Tony's cheek with his own, reassuring Tony by letting him feel how okay the dragon was.  He could feel the others' surprise as well, which Steve resolutely ignored.
"Besides, I'm good for it" Tony said, throwing himself on his back as he placed his hand, palm facing outward, over his forehead in a classic swooning position.  It didn't quite hide his smile.  "My love for the villainous Jan is too pure.  My heart will burst and I will waste away until she is returned to her normal heroic self.  Save me, Carol."
Wanda walked up to another section of the wall, her claw running down in a straight line.  Tony hesitated, but put his hand back on her flank.
"You think it," Tony said, cutting off any protest.  "I hear it enough when you and Jarvis or Pepper are whispering about me."
At first the light was small, but he kept up a continuous blast and soon it was nearly blinding.  He could feel the strain it was putting on the reactor, but he didn't dare stop.  He only stopped when the room started to shake and he heard Viper give a startled yell, his own breath heavy, and his heart pounding.  A sharp pain went through his heart, but the heart pump held up, keeping the broken organ still beating.
"It's me," Susan said. "We got you out, you and Leo.  Tony said he followed the clues you left.  It's... It's really me."
Tony lifted off, careful not to put in too much thrust as the ceilings were very low here.  He kept well back from the woman as he landed, saving her from as much of the exhaust fumes as possible.  "Are you alright?"
"No, you shouldn't have," Steve replied, feeling Tony wince.  He kept Tony from pulling away, but made sure his strength was in check so that Tony still had the option if he really wanted to.  It was harder than he'd like to admit, since part of him just wanted to shake the idiot.
"A warrior's exploits in the bedroom make for a grand epic in the songs of Asgard," Thor added over the com.  "It goes well with aged mead."
Pushing herself off the train, Susan flew up to avoid another blast from the canon.  The armor wouldn't take another hit like that, and the blast had shorted out the shields.  But this was
"They're going to be disgustingly cute now, aren't they?" Clint said.  Natasha poked him in the side with her foot as she was lounging with her feet in his lap, not saying anything but apparently getting across her meaning to Clint loud and clear as he laughed.  "Point.  Okay, you two.  Either get a room or come watch the movie with us."
"He's surprisingly decent for a super-villain," Steve agreed.  "What's your ETA for coming back?  Do you need one of us to pick you up?"
Tony knocked against the ground.  The suit took most of the blow, but that didn't mean it was pleasant.  He forced himself to his feet with a groan, grabbing Viper by the arm and dragging her up with a repulsor to her head.
"Hey, Dr. Banner," Iron Man said, helping Natasha clear some of the dirty dishes from the table.  "Mr. Stark wants to know if you've looked over those energy readings he gave you."
"Iron Man, stand down," Steve said, understanding his frustration but the last thing they needed was to have a spat on the battlefield.  Iron Man always got touchy when it came to other people using Stark Tech, and if those robots were anything to go by, he could see why.  But now wasn't the time to lose their heads.  "Thor?"
She took off in the air without further warning, her powerful legs springing her upward and her wings taking care of the lift.  Tony clutched at the spike in front of him as his stomach dropped out.
"I could ask Rhodey or Pepper to come, if you want," Steve said, sensing the tension.  "We only just managed to convince them your injuries weren't dangerous, but if you'd rather one of them be here, they'd come."
Thinking back, Steve realized he hadn't.  Tony had asked if he found the tablet useful, but not about posting online.  He hadn't pushed on that, and Steve had been grateful.  "No, I haven't," Steve answered.
"Tony..." Steve said, gentle reproof in his voice.  "We've done everything we can.  It's up to the kids now."
As the silence wore on though, Steve felt his curiosity get the better of him.  "Is Iron Man around?" he asked hesitantly, not looking at the armor strewn around the ground.  Thinking about that too long unsettled him, even if he knew his friend wasn't actually in the suit and the armor was just bits of machinery.
It was only a minute or so after the video ended before Tony jerked away, standing through sheer force of will and anger despite the fact Steve could see his legs shaking.  Steve scrambled to follow him, half afraid Tony was going to topple over.  Surprisingly enough,
Stark looked up, a split second of confusion on his face before he returned to the brittle smile and tense shoulders from when he walked in.  "What's the matter, Captain?  Repulsed by the idea of sleeping with the staff?"
"You're like a peach?" Susan guessed, knowing his tone, but not the word.  Sometimes he and Cap used such antiquated language that she could barely keep up.
"I'm not sure," Tony said.  He took a step forward, then stumbled as the ground shook.  "Seems like the hydra is even grumpier than you when it wakes up."
"Where did you find all of these?" Steve asked, looking through the images. They were all sorts of different styles and a lot of them were really good. They put his own little drawing to shame, that's for sure.
Steve did not make his run the next morning.  Or his first class training SHIELD agents.  He rushed in the last five minutes of the class with a pounding headache and queasy stomach that only got worse with Deputy Director Hill's glare.  He was very glad to see her covering his class, however.  Surprised, because he'd have thought she would have much better things to do than train newbie agents, but then again, once she was through glaring at Steve, she seemed to really enjoy teaching.  It might be a nice break for her.
"It's a strange word," Steve said.  There was a dragon name-feeling that Tony decided to automatically translate for his own sanity to 'Peggy'.  "Peggy said you mentioned the term earlier, but it's... odd.  Why do you need secrets?"
Wrong.  Tony nearly thrashed out again, but he tried to swallow with his dry mouth and held it to a small twitch.  How hadn't the reactor come back online yet?  His voice was hoarse, either through shouting or babbling to himself.  He couldn't say for sure either way.  The reactor should have turned back on by now.  It should have, but it hadn't.  Something had gone wrong.  Something always went wrong.  Of course it did.  He's Tony Stark, and he's always a problem.  More trouble than he was worth.  No one was coming to-
"There's some good things," Tony replied, thinking back to the evenings with the others, of Pepper's laugh, Rhodey's quiet smile, and Jarvis's arm around his shoulder.  The warm fire, the taste of coffee on a cold winter day and M&Ms that the soldiers would share with them, and the smell of irises in the spring that always reminded him of his mother.  His workshop, one of the few places he actually felt at home, where he could retreat when SI was too busy and chaotically making instruments of war that would only add to the body count.
Pain, sharp and vicious, arched up his back.  He could hear Steve's roar through the HT and had to bite back his own scream.
"Dr. Foster," Tony said, glaring at Rhodey's abandonment.  Rhodey held his free hand up in a gesture of 'not touching this.'  "Welcome to New Yo-"
"No, I... I can work on it now," Tony said, practically falling over himself to get his hands on the uniform.  Steve was asking him for something, something Tony could actually do.  Something that would keep Steve
"Too much for you?" Clint said sympathetically, sitting next to Bruce and putting his feet in the doctor's lap.
"It was easier with everyone's forgiveness and friendship," Wanda replied, shaking her head.  She stood then, heading to the door.  "Just think about it, Steve.  Anger doesn't suit you."
Steve foiled his plans by plucking the tablet out of his fingers and kissing Tony's temple.  "You're late," he repeated, a soft fondness in his voice Tony didn't know what to make of.
Tony looked back at Steve with a ghostly smile that worried him.  "I figure we can eat the cake upstairs with the others."
"Friends," he reminded himself quietly, closing his eyes for a moment to keep the pain at bay.  "Goodnight, Shellhead," he said, his voice only breaking on the last word.  "I'm glad we're friends."
Steve found himself furious again, but this time not at Stark.  He hated the words coming out of Stark's mouth, hated even more the people who caused that outlook on life.  He didn't know what to say to that.  'Sorry' felt too empty and meaningless.  He wanted to reach out, but he didn't know how to comfort Stark after that.
He turned to leave, but Steve grabbed his shoulder, turning him back around.  "We're not done here.  You knew-"
," Steve said, turning to Tony and pulling him against his chest.  He felt momentary resistance before Tony caved against him.  "It was the fault of whoever made those things, not yours.  And we will find them and make sure they are brought to justice."
"Aye, we should.  We were heartened to see you left some of the foes for us this time.  It is wise to share in victory."
Steve's nostrils flared.  "No," he said to Tony's vast relief.  "There are so few humans that come here, so only the elders may eat them."
"Technically no," Tony said around the pin in his mouth.  He pulled it out and stuck it in the fabric, which Steve politely tried his hardest to ignore.  "But change enough things or call it a parody, and they have a lot of wiggle room.  The lawyers said we could kick up a fuss if we wanted, but we probably wouldn't win anything."
Steve sent a brief prayer for that agent's soul to rest well, regardless of their mistakes.  "And Stark?"
"We'll stop the Skrulls, I promise," Cap said, then more gently, "And we'll get that leg of yours fixed up too.  It won't always hurt so much."
"I'm terrible with emotional problems," Tony said, just before Steve turned his non-physical brains to mush by pushing
"Food's been going missing," Jarvis replied.  "Not all of it at once, but a lot.  Enough to have a small feast every day.  The cook's been going crazy because he locks the pantry up tight every night."
find the science behind it eventually.  "They've been more active in the past week than they have been in fifty years of your time.  It worries me that they are so active now."
With that set, Tony started out for the cave, pushing away the guilt he felt for sneaking around while the dragons were fighting.  The underbrush was, as he suspected, much lighter than on the west side.  He was grateful for that, and even though the distance was longer, he made better time than he had coming back the other day.
Steve didn't think.  Not about how close he was to the portal or about how he would destroy the world.  He didn't think about what would happen if he got closer.  But Iron Man's -
"And Steve," Tony interrupted.  "I want him.  I'll fix his memories -"  Steve lunged but went through Tony.  Cap had turned himself insubstantial, and Tony forced the coding on his face to act unsurprised, like he'd done it himself.
He was still smarting from the reposts, and he hadn't really uploaded any new art or checked Tumblr either.  He kept drawing, because it gave his hands something to do while Sam still hadn't reported in and Tony was missing their weekly lunch because he was on another continent for business.  It made focusing harder though, because every line reminded him of how much it'd hurt.
"We didn't know when you'd be up and you whine too much when the food's gone cold," she said, crossing her arms over her ample chest.  "And Fury said you're to take off at least two weeks to get your head on straight.  That stunt you pulled was too risky and he doesn't want to lose the rest of his assets."
"He's got high levels of histamines in his system, and from these readings, I'd say he's been given this drug multiple times.  Frequently, I'd say.  They knew about this reaction."
, Steve thought as the warmth of the armor settled against his side when the movie started and his friends all sat around them, safe and happy.
Tony pulled off one of the gauntlets, then laid a careful hand on Steve's shoulder joint.  "How 'bout now?"
?  No need to throw all the tea bags in the harbor.  Trust me, Fury can't shoot me out of the sky.  He can try, but he wouldn't succeed.  I can get us wherever we need to go."
Tony didn't even look up, but at least he wasn't tensing up more because of company.  Steve took that as a good sign.  "Hey, Cap," Tony said nonchalantly, putting aside the carrots to start on the onions.
"Yeah, well, tell that idiot to give me a call when he's up for it," Tony said, his voice back to normal even if Steve could feel Tony's shoulders shaking under his hands.  "And yell at him for me.  He yells at me for being reckless.  Now it's his turn."
