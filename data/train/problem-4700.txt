- “Every Day You Play” Pablo Neruda.
“I had, uh- just been thinking. That- everything I feel for you is just so big and so much that I feel sometimes like I could burst and light up the universe with it. Or something.” His face heats even more and he tries to duck away. “‘S dumb.”
Soft touch urges him to lift his face and he sees those blue eyes traced with their own tears.
About two weeks after what Dean has taken to referring to in his head as The Incident, his phone rings. He’s sitting on the edge of the bed with a towel around his waist, having just showered off the hunt grime and debating the merits of getting dressed to go scrounge up a decent diner versus just sitting in his boxers eating the last of his road snacks.

In death's other kingdom
Dean scowls. Fuck Sam anyway. Just because he’s tall enough to blow over in a high wind doesn’t mean he gets to judge anyone else’s verticalness. South America points almost accusingly at Sam’s navel. Dean consoles himself for a moment with the idea that the table might be as irritated at the intrusion as he is. It might still be willing to be his friend after all.
Ironic that this ritual of washing, of cleaning Cas of blood and dirt, could leave Dean feeling so tainted. But it feels as if every bit of dirt clouding the water is indictment for not protecting as he should.
And the reality
Dean frowns.
The joy that seems the counterpart of fear,
Time stutters. Slows. Stops.
Dean shoves himself out of his chair, intent on heading for the door, pushing past Sam. He’s done with this, with this whole conversation, and if Sam has poured out all the booze then the next logical thing is to go get more.
BOLD ITALIC CAPITALS: voice of the Shadow
Dean inhales sharply as he hears the words, echoed from that night. A hand on his cock and the other pinning him to the door. How quickly awareness had settled into his bones.
for that, go on flowering, flowery one,
my savage, solitary soul, my name that sends them all running.
Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.
“Then always we shall be.”
“Yup,” Charlie grins perkily. She tilts a smirk up at Sam. “As I was saying, I was giving Dean grief for being all googly-eyed-” Dean interrupts her with a rough scoff, which she contentedly ignores “-over Cas. Just mushy with love from clear across the room.”
---------------
Dean laughs, a mirthless sound.
Dean ducks his gaze down and away, only for Cas to bring it back with a gentle touch to his cheek. There’s nothing but loving warmth in his blue eyes.
- in the morning and, God, this is fucking hard enough already, but all the wasted
Castiel has always understood Dean better than Dean understood himself. Perhaps words aren't needed as Cas leans over and kisses him gently.
Don't leave me, even for an hour, because
Dean keeps his gaze averted, but stops trying to burrow away. There’s no point. Not when there’s nowhere else he can go in the bed and Cas’ hand on his face leaves no doubt that if Dean somehow manages to escape, the angel can and will follow. Dean’s desire to avoid feeling stupid has no power against the stubbornness of an angel who fought Heaven. So he stays put.
“Everything seems to be all right,” the doctor said in a softer tone and startled all three present Winchesters, who were staring in trance at the monitor. Monster, yes. Self-doubt: all the time. Dying and loosing each other: daily routine. But seeing a tiny human being, that would soon be included in their family on a screen left them all completely speechless.
“It would,” Sam said, “if it wasn’t for the guy that lay unconscious in the middle of the street two days ago without any traces of alcohol and drugs. He told the police, an invisible force shoved him back out of nothing and if a car would have come by, he would be dead by now.”
“I will go outside and make it look as if we all left together in a car. They will follow me if I bind a piece of Glynn, preferable her blood to my grace because it will seem as if there was an unprotected Nephilim with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Being not able to drive with a baby in his jacket, the older Winchester threw his key at Sam and got into the back seat, followed by Cas.
"You know that I'm not good for you," was what emerged Dean's vocal cords after some time. "I'm not one to have a family with, to have kids and live the picket-fenced life with. I did too many bad things, there is no way out for me anymore."
“Actually, I am,” de dark-haired man said. “But it’s going to be alright after I told you my story.”
"How- how do you want me to..." he trailed off, turning slightly red again. "I mean, I'm gonna need to bit you and kn- knot you at the same time." Dean's eyes opened wide even if he hadn't meant to.
In time with the younger Winchester catching up with the two others, his brother had turned the warrior mode full on.
“My last boyfriend and I, we were together for seven years until I noticed, that he slept with two other women. First, I was furious, but then I thought, that I should have noticed it. I mean, two other girls at the same time and I was too busy with my job or something. Or maybe I knew and didn’t want to admit it. But it doesn’t matter.” She licked her lips and took another drink.
Zack just grinned winningly and ordered some guys from behind him who brought a black briefcase as if they were in a James Bond movie.
It was a little bit awkward, as it was evident that Cas hadn't done that often, and neither of them with men, but the hunter soon realised that he never wanted to stop. The angel's lips were still wonderfully warm and Dean really needed to get closer. When he opened his mouth and angled his face a little bit, the other gasped.
At least Cas allowed him to be fully aware of his visual and audible sense but seeing the people he loved fighting and not being able to help was probably even worse than sleeping away the whole party.
It felt humiliating and probably the others would make fun of him for ages.
“Practice?” Cas voice sounded muffled out of the car. “What do you need practice for?”
Sorry for the delay, stupid real life all the time... :D
“I want to have children, and I’m searching for a father.”
This was how the younger Winchester ended up heading to the previously unconscious guy’s place and Cas and Dean for the flat of the girl, that found him. Her name was Kate Mitchell, and it rang a few bells in the hunter’s head but he didn’t know why.
There was no way, the omega would be able to defeat them, so he decided to use his special move. Acting, not thinking. At least he dropped a remote-controlled bomb in the stack of cupboards and the pile to his right before he emerged from his hiding.
This is a little epilogue approx. six years after the story from Mary's point of view.
They shared an amused smile, and Dean asked himself for what felt like the hundredth time this evening, why, oh why he couldn’t be attracted to this woman. It would solve both their problems. It would be so easy, but easy didn’t fit in Deans life apparently.
As the pain seemed to have quieted down a bit the angel answered.
“Sure,” Cas smiled and followed a brabbling Dean and a laughing Mia to the room, where Jo, Mary, and William stayed.
“I like it, and I haven’t even been in there,” he greeted his big brother and rose to a stand. Jo’s eyes went a little bit wider at the sight of the huge man but she still shook his hand immediately.
This moment the hunter located the girl, sitting alone at the bar and smoothly slit into the barstool next to hers. She had her hair open this time and it was falling down her back in soft dark waves. If it wasn’t like it was, Dean could have enjoyed it, could have found a beautiful companion for the night in her, but her hair colour was reminding him and all in all he knew exactly what he actually wanted.
"You have to stop saying please, or I don't know how to control my inner alpha anymore," he growled, and Dean felt himself slick even more.
Sam opened the book next to the bed, sporting a full on bitchface.
"Damn, Cas," Dean moaned in the alpha's mouth without thinking about it. This erected a chuckle from Cas which died down when he looked into Dean's eyes.
“It’s all right, her water broke while you were flirting at the bookshelves,” the younger Winchester uttered with the smuggest smile he could master at that moment. Dean’s eyes went wide, even if he didn’t want them to.
“To Mia she says, she is happy that she was born, and she wants to meet her one day, but she is just not ready for that.” His eyes turned unbelievable sad at that, and Dean finally closed the space between them and an initiated a three-people-hug with Mia half between them.
“I didn’t change-“
Dean was suddenly struck by how good Cas smelled. It was a combination of rainstorm and lavender and he absolutely loved it. There was the evil word again. “Are you okay?” Cas almost whispered in his ear and the brush of hot air sent shivers down Dean’s spine.
“What about Cas?” the older Winchester asked and stuffed an almost cooked pasta in his mouth just to annoy the other. Sam seemed to swallow visibly.
He didn’t know what it was, maybe these words, the absurdity of the situation or the face the other made, Dean just couldn’t keep it in anymore. He felt how whole-heartedly laughter bubbled up his chest, in a way he hadn’t felt since he was a kid.
Thinking back at his life until now there had probably only been one thing that he ever did right and that was building a life with Jo. And even that had been done in a way, that kept Dean awake at night because he thought about how she could have a better life and would presumably leave him one day as well.
“September 18th,” the younger Winchester answered after a look at the car’s dashboard. From the corner of his eye, Dean could watch realization draw over Cas face and then the brightest smile, the hunter had ever seen, settled there.
Hya my fellow Destiel fans.
“Hi,” Dean said and cleared his throat. Get it together, man, he’s probably married. Of course, he had spent the rest of the evening yesterday with thinking of reasons to not flirt with his hot neighbor, but he seemed to forget every one of them.
While Dean held the squealing infant, the younger Winchester instructed Cas how to mix a bottle of baby milk while he packed away the bath tube. There was a sudden pang of guilt shooting through the older hunter, because he was sure that his brother had always wanted children on his own and every time he came close to that dream, Dean interfered and broke everything apart.
“Wait, what now?” Dean asked now a little bit louder, realizing in the same moment what this meant. He was going to be a dad. “Are… Are you okay? I mean, uh, okay, I’m coming!”
“Yes, I’m very, very glad.” At that, they leaned their foreheads together and stayed like this until the faint crying of a baby started to creep into their audible senses.
So this was kind of the introduction to the story :D
Of course, that was the moment, the annoying little brother chose to burst into the room. He frowned but didn’t comment on Dean’s fast movement of withdrawing his hand and turning back around to the stove.
“How old is she,” he asked and Castiel looked back up into his eyes. Those blue eyes.
They had found mysterious deaths in a small town in Michigan called Greenville. With no other hunter available in this area at that time, the Winchesters jumped in the Impala and rode of. Well, they probably didn’t jump, and Dean’s frown could probably be seen till Canada, but he liked to change the colour of the events a little, when he wrote them down in their Men-of-Letters/Hunters-diary.
Dean nodded a little, slowly getting a bad feeling in his stomach. He had wanted to get out of the gang business because he had found something to stay alive and well for and now he was being dragged in one of those dangerous situations again.
First adjusting her brothers vomit green tie, then turning to face the mass of students and parents in front of her she took a moment to reply.
“What about outside?” the younger Winchester asked as soon as the pregnant woman was only panting slightly and didn’t look as if she was dying for a second. Sweat was glistening on her forehead and she had her eyes closed.
"You didn't?" It was visible that it took a lot of effort for the alpha to lift his head and look into his mates eyes. Damn, they really were mates. Dean shook his head and tried something else: Can you hear this?
She was still crying and the older hunter had such a big frown on his face, that it almost hurt, but after they got the tiny onesie, that said “don’t drink and drive” with a bottle of milk on the front and the warm brown overall on her small frame, she seemed to start quieting down.
“What angels?” the tax accountant in front of him asked the same moment, kind of looking dumbfounded.
“You are cold,” Cas suddenly stated from inside the diner and for a second the hunter got a glimpse of him sitting there, watching TV. Dean couldn’t repress the small smile at that.
thought about him. When had he become such a sap? What was with ‘the other was better off without him’? Every fibre inside of him yearned for the alpha.
“When do you finally understand,” Dean growled pushing himself away from the shelve he had leaned on. Cas looked at him dumbstruck as if he hadn’t expected for the other to throw such a fit when he wanted to be useful.
How many days can Dean Winchester live without Castiel before he goes and searches for him? Or rather limps.
Dean was snapped out of his thoughts by his brother clapping on his shoulder, probably because he had mentioned him in some way.
His mother cleared her throat. When Dean looked up so hastily, he was afraid to have strained something in his neck, she had an expectant look on her face.
Dean kept pacing in the living room long after Sam had left and after they had put the babies to sleep. Jo had gone to bed half an hour after them, still being exhausted from the birth in addition to the hourly crying in the night.
Cas looked over his shoulder again and then suddenly smiled up at Dean. “Alright, but I have a conference on Monday. Tuesday would be better for me, I have a lunch break at 1 p.m.”
"Bedroom," he whispered against the other's lips, and since Cas didn't know where exactly that was, he took his hand and pulled him there while steadying himself on various furniture. When he saw his bed, he had nearly made before, he felt the nervousness rise again, but only until he heard his alpha gulp behind him. Right,
“Well, Dean, I haven’t heard you ramble like this since you were a teen and wanted me to know that you liked John Travolta more than Olivia Newton-John, so it must be serious.” Dean could clearly hear him grin through his voice. “why don’t you just do what you always do?”
Fire.
as difficult as stopping the end of the world sometimes.
Italics : specific, important thoughts
Castiel makes a noise then, an inarticulate yet eloquent moan of disbelief, and he darts forward, closing the distance between them, using his grip on the back of Dean's neck to pull them together.
He breathes and his chest aches. A hollow thump next to his heart like something has been carved away, like he could reach up and put his fingers right into the bleeding cavity and pull out every shattered bit-

“Fuck, Cas, I love you so damn much,” he whispers, not bothering to try to hide the emotional rasp in his voice.
How does Love speak?
"Cas..." he tries. Tries to speak, tries to explain. Just...tries. But he can't. He can't explain what's inside him. Not when he hasnt been able to touch the depth of it for almost 30 years.
“Don’t.”

In this moment, it seems impossible that he should finally get to have this air, this space, with nothing coming to punish him for the arrogance of hope.
Dean clears his throat, blushing violently.
“I missed you so much these past two weeks,” he whispers as his fingers encircle and begin to stroke slowly. “I wanted so badly to share with you what I was learning.”
.” Cas’ voice is sharp and stern and Dean sits up a little straighter. “This is important and I’m not inclined to wait on it. In addition, there is something we need to discuss in person. Now, tell me where you are.”
“So how are you, Dean? Other than the obvious,” Cas says, swiftly changing the subject. Dean doesn’t blame him.
Dean’s eyes are closed again, but he’s smiling so big around his words that they’re hard to get out.
“It’s good to hear yours, too. It always is,” Cas says slowly, finally.
Amal pulls the receipt off the register while Dean bags the last few items himself, intent on never making eye contact with another human being again in his life.
“Good. Um, you should probably get some sleep,” Cas says.
“Please talk to me. Cas. You can draw this out, but what’s the point? Because you’re ashamed, you’re embarrassed? Who cares? How many times have you seen me make a fool of myself, huh? Every damn day, almost. Dude, I’m fine.
There’s a small smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. Dean can’t look away. He’s struck again by the magnitude of the situation.
“That’s more than okay,” Dean says, breaking their intense eye contact to look down at their hands.
He really, really does.
It’s Dean’s turn to speak anyway, because he really needs to clear this up. He tightens his grip around Cas’s hand and draws his breath. This part won’t be as easy as holding hands, but it’s more important.
Huh. That’s… That’s actually a good point. He
“It’s not your fault,” Cas says.
to work this out. There’s nothing here that’s beyond fixing. Not even close. We just have to—we need to talk.”
“Yeah, yeah, shove it,” Dean says, forcing a frown to match his harsh words and suppress the smile in his voice. Doesn’t really work. “What’s your problem today, anyway?”
“Nothing’s going on. I just don’t want you to waste your time on something that’ll never—that might not ever happen.”
Cas’ position is that Dean needs to value himself more and take better care of himself. Dean doesn’t have a position, because Cas is right. Kind of. The problem is that Cas doesn’t know how much progress Dean has actually made in this area. Dean knows it doesn’t seem like it from the outside, since he’s been so depressed without Cas, but he knows himself. He knows he’s different after everything Cas said.
What does he—? What does he even say?
No, he doesn’t.
“But we talked for a while. I told him some—I mean I told him
Still beautiful.
: seeing Cas with his own eyes. Holding his gaze as he talks about feelings. It’s nothing he’s done before—well, okay, he has a bit, but it’s nothing he’s ever done so deliberately, and with an honest desire to communicate as much as he can.
Dean loves this. This is exactly what he’s been waiting for. But because Dean is the way he is, he can’t move on from what they were talking about earlier. His mouth just opens and says words.
“Cas,” Dean says. “Cas.”
“Yeah, but what if I know I have a way back? Not a potion. But you know, some not-stupid idea that I haven’t found yet?”
that?
“You kept count. Of course. Obviously.”
It’s the absolute last thing Dean would expect someone to single out, so he can’t help but laugh, surprised and a bit too loud.
Deep breath.
“It is,” Cas agrees.
“Yes, sorry. Um,” Cas answers immediately, “thank you. But you don’t have to promise anything, or try to convince me that you’re trying. I have faith in you, Dean.”
“And before you get all freaked out, you should know I’m looking forward to talking about this. Might be hard to believe, but I’m serious. Can’t wait. And it’s not just that I’m desperate to hear your voice again. I just want to understand, you know? I wanna know what’s been going on with you. Because I care about you, you know?”
“Dean? Are you still there?”
Dean opens his eyes to see Cas looking at him in a way that says their first kiss will definitely happen soon. Dean might not be able to think ahead, but Cas looks like he certainly can. His eyes have started wandering, taking Dean in, no longer focused on their conversation. From his hair to his lips and his shoulders and down to his chest, Dean feels like Cas is taking inventory. He’s mapping Dean out. Dean should feel exposed, but instead he feels… Held. Cared for. It’s like Cas is cradling Dean in his hands, holding him up to the light to examine him, humming in approval at every facet of him.
“Fine.”
“Bobby and Charlie, mostly.”
“What?”
“I think I’d definitely go to the beach,” Dean says as he pours dish soap onto a brush.
“Okay, well. Well that’s good,” Dean manages to say.
“No reason.”
He can’t
The guy in line in front of Dean, who’d been browsing the magazines, turns his head to see who Dean is talking to. He doesn’t find anyone because Dean is technically talking to a voice in his head.
“Estimate, buddy,” Dean says, and he cannot get the smile off his face. It will not budge; he’s beaming like he’s won the lottery.
“There is no problem.”
“Uh,” Dean says, trying to figure out what he can say that would work for both the person in front of him

Plopping back down at the table and getting to know its coastline curves and angles a little better sounds rather appealing. Especially if he has Johnnie, Jim, or Jack along for company.

He swallows against a prickle of emotion. From the very first moment he had met Castiel, he had known there was something there between them. He hadn’t understood what it was at the time, but it had quickly grown so compelling, so all-encompassing…
And the response

Two souls can find the balance of these elements in each other and nothing else matters, not doubt or fear or pain.
"Not all gardens are literal, Dean," Castiel whispers. "You grow love in the hearts of those with whom you share your life." He leans forward and presses a kiss to Dean's forehead. It feels like a benediction. "Your love is a garden in bloom. I'd call that the best soil there is."
He twists the band around his ring finger and utterly misses the look that passes between Sam and Charlie, an entire conversation that occurs in silent flicks of gazes, emphatic nods, and Charlie quickly trotting away.

See? Small scale, easily managed.
He tries (and fails) to not think about what he said and how he said it and how everything suddenly seemed to make so much more sense. Especially since he hadn’t been able to apply that newfound sense before it had all gone to shit.
And loved the sorrows of your changing face
That reality settling deep inside him almost as though it could meld with his bones is what finally spurs him forward.
No kidding.
Breathing. In and out. In and out.
Dean shudders, a ripple that runs the length of his entire body and blocks his throat. Cas’ fingers knead at the back of his head and he’s still fucking whispering in Dean’s ear.
His name on Castiel's lips is an oath. Like a prayer. Like a man asking for a benediction he does not hope to receive and Dean realizes Cas is trembling. But as his hands move, finally releasing Dean's hands, only to reach up and cup one hand over the back of Dean's neck, fingers sliding into his hair, the other hand sliding over his cheek, Dean realizes that his own hands are shaking as well.
Sam jerks back. Stumbles. A purple shadow blooms fast on his jawline.
"That was my understanding as well, but for me it was Charlie. Do you-" Cas frowns as though the idea of thinking ill of his brand new brother-in-law and his husband’s best friend sits poorly with him. "Do you think that they might have been playing a trick on us?"
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw
In my headcanon, a prayer connection has an answering hum to it. Sort of a sense of an open phone line. The human soul connects a conduit to the metaphysical. There is no knowledge if the angel on the other end is actually listening or if they will respond (times when Dean and Sam prayed to Cas in the show and were annoyed that he didn’t respond, they would have known the prayer connected, but not known if Cas was paying attention).

Dean wastes no time in crossing the room to his husband and pulling him into a hug. He might not have known what Sam was up to, but he isn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth, not when the horse is a moment alone with Castiel.
My most enthusiastic and fervent thanks to my betas PhantomDingo, daalex, and Alulah. This story would not have been anywhere near what it is without your help.
There it is. Right to the top of the list.
Cas shakes his head, the motion strange with their hands basically holding his face.
Dean stares. An ugly, hot wash of tension begins crawling up his spine.
Knowledge of what he had wanted had crashed over him so suddenly that night, but then nothing had come of it and then it had been weeks. Now, it’s all being offered again, plus more, and not only does it all seem too good to be true, apprehension shivers through him in sharp flashes.
I don’t know if it was a continuity error that Dean no longer had the handprint scar in later seasons or deliberate choice but, for my purposes here, he still has it.
Prison.
There is a swelling tide under this moment. He can feel it. It'll change everything, if he has the courage to let it, if he can trust that the waves will save and not drown him.
“I never dared to dream you might feel the same.”
If he had fallen asleep with the bottle in his hands and woken without it, there’s only one real answer. Given how their last argument had gone, it’s not hard to believe that Sam would have been stupid enough to stage some sort of bullshit intervention. Dean does kinda hope he’s wrong, but only for Sam’s sake.

Dean does his wondering about omens and warnings and if he had missed something important, though he still doesn’t regret his single-minded focus on getting himself and Cas out of their pants.
A smile curves Castiel’s lips, a smirk that holds little of mirth and everything of a hot anticipation that makes Dean’s stomach clench. The angel steps behind him, hands cupping over Dean’s hipbones, calluses striking sparks that Dean is afraid might send him up in flames. Castiel’s fingers splay just at the tops of his thighs.
Dean scoffs. “If none of this has worked so far, what makes you think I’m gonna let you play verbal ‘I’m not touching you’ until I cave?”

Dean blinks.

Dean sighs and deliberately pulls his attention from the pair of them, finding his gaze automatically drawn back across the room until it falls on a particular dark-haired head.
and Dean can’t bear another moment of it.
and it frets and sounds like Sam, so it’s a strange jolt when Sam’s voice in his head is suddenly in the room.
As Dean’s hackles rise, Sam holds his hands up like he can talk his way out of this, like

“That’s not the comfort you seem to think it is,” Dean grumbles just as Sam ambles over and claps Dean on the shoulder with the hand not holding a champagne flute.

It’s the life. It is what it is.
Cas whispers.
"I dunno. Growing things? Making things? All I do is kill, man." He still hasn't managed to meet his angel's eyes, but the tender touch of Castiel's fingers on his cheek lifts his face.
Falls the Shadow
"You think so?"
The contact is brief and tentative. At the last moment, Dean second guesses himself. What if Cas doesn't like kissing? If he does,
Cas inhales deeply and melts against him, his arms going around Dean's shoulders, clinging to him as though Dean is his only safe harbor. Dean holds him just as tightly, emotion almost choking him and filling his heart to bursting.
Dean closes his eyes and entwines their fingers. If his heart and love is a garden, so be it. But he knows that he's not the soil. It's the love they've grown between them.
He has to be. When not just your job but your life depends on being able to shoot and run and fight just that little bit faster and better than the monsters, you gotta be tough. You gotta be ready to roll after sleeping sitting up in a car, your only caffeine in the form of cold and stale coffee pilfered from some mini-mart yesterday.
Had Castiel breathed life back into him like this?
Cas is chatting with Pamela now, soft smiles on both their faces, and Dean's heart clenches. It’s a relief to see. They both mean so much to him and there had been a time he thought they’d never be able to get along. Not that he blamed Pamela in the least. Losing eyes would be a hard thing to get over.
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
This began as a much simpler notion, but it didn’t take much time before it blew up into an epic narrative with an exploration of grief and how it affects the heart. Dean had a story to tell here and I had no choice but to let him tell it.
It doesn’t take long to find Sam. He’s at one of the library tables with laptop, books, and notes strewn across the wooden surface. But the tense set of his shoulders and the dark anticipation in his eyes says that he isn’t working. Not really.
The next morning, Sam is visibly surprised to see Dean alone, but Dean just mutters that Cas had had to go in the middle of the night (not a lie) and that he had no idea why (very much a lie).

He feels the brush of Castiel’s lips against his shoulder again.

"No, Dean. Say it all. Use your words. Call me what you know you should."
Cas lifts one shoulder in a shrug and shakes his head.
Charlie just grins. “Don’t even pretend, Dean. I saw you making eyes at your man over there.”
He weeps.

"It's about damn time, Sammy. Now, what the hell is going on?"

Between the conception
“I told you that night that I wanted to be supportive. Even before I knew precisely what this kink entailed. Your needs are important to me, Dean.” His tie is tugged free with a whisper of cloth and tossed atop the coat, followed by his suit jacket. “Imagine my… delight when I discovered that they aligned with my own interests.”
“I believe the phrase is ‘penny for your thoughts’?” he says against Dean’s skin, casting his knowing gaze up through his lashes. “But not only do I not have a penny, I also suspect I know what you’re thinking.”
Sam pulls an exaggerated thinking face.
That ever-present knowledge of what exactly lurks behind that vault door of
Cas reached up to brush away the glitter of tears from Dean's lashes, his own blue eyes bright.
*****Content warning on this chapter.*****
“There is no need to be.” Another kiss against his skin. “Nothing will happen without your consent, but I would very much like to explore this with you. Dean, do you trust me to give you what you need?”
Days pass.
At the hour when we are
For a few moments, he is confused. He’s certain that he fell asleep with his fingers curled protectively around the glass. But now, with the bottle nowhere to be seen…
Dean swings into the library, accusations climbing his throat, one hand raised to point a damning finger at his brother, but Sam cuts him off before he can even speak. As if he’s been waiting for the sight of Dean as his opening, Sam raises his chin, jaw brightly bruised, a picture of defiance.
," Cas whispers again, emphatic even as his tears fall. Dean wonders if they are as hot as his own. "How can I prove to you that you are enough to me?"

He can hear Cas' footsteps approach and he braces himself.

It doesn’t make him soft. It makes him human. He figures that if the universe is going to shit all over him and his life (and yeah, he can’t quite convince himself that someone like him deserves to be able to settle down with someone he loves and who loves him, but Cas is an adamant weirdo who insists he loves Dean just like he is)... Then he’s going to take what he can get whenever and wherever he can.
“Well, whatever do you mean, Sammy?”

for you to smell the sea that we loved together
He leans down, lifting one hand out of his pocket to cup over the back of Dean’s head, fingers combing into the short hair. His warm breath and warmer words wash against Dean’s ear and Dean lets out a noise that is caught between a moan and a whine, a pitiful croon of need. He clenches his hands on the towel covering his lap, thin terrycloth bunching between his fingers.

But he doesn’t burst. He holds together, his heart full, and he watches as Cas takes his hand and lifts it to his lips, his kiss brushing away the lingering trace of the wiped away tear.
He brushes another kiss against Dean’s lips, but draws back with an inquisitively raised eyebrow when Dean laughs into the caress.
https://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/loves-language-by-ella-wheeler-wilcox
Dean is NOT complaining.
“It’s the last minute, Dean. I know this, you know this.” He squeezes his eyes shut, misery etched in the lines of his face. “By waiting, I ruined-”
Full stop.
Which is part of the draw of the whiskey. With the help of Johnnie, Jim, and Jack, he can take that pile, shove it behind the door in his mind labelled
I want for your ears to go on hearing the wind,
“No, I mean—I mean I hadn’t thought about it
bullshit, for sure. How could it not be Dean’s fault? Dean is the reason Cas sacrificed himself. It’s not just that Cas died to save Dean’s life, but what made it possible in the first place. Cas would never have had that opportunity to save Dean if he hadn’t… had those feelings. For Dean. Whatever they are.
“Sure,” Dean says uselessly.
“I will literally wait as long as you need. You’re it, Cas. You’re just—you’re—you’re the love of my life, man.”
“Hey! Cas!” Dean replies, sitting up straight. He drops what he’s doing and sits back in his chair a little.
, exactly, isn’t quite as clear.
There’s a pause that’s long enough that Dean worries he’s lost Cas again already.
“Shit, I have no idea, Cas. They didn’t have their entire identity spelled out on their name tag, just their pronouns. Geez,” Dean says, feeling defensive.
“And I never thought I could have it, either,” Dean continues, and it feels like the words are being pulled out of him before he can consider them. “I didn’t even think you could have feelings like that.”
Close enough. Maybe someday he could finally be close enough. It feels possible. And for the first time since Cas died, Dean is hopeful.
“I might not always know how to say things, but I know what I need to say.”
. Right.
“Hey Cas. You’ll be happy to know you’ve inspired me to make my bedroom habitable for human life again,” Dean says.
“What are”—don’t say it, Dean, don’t say it— “what are you wearing? On the beach.”
“Not nearly as well as I’d like,” Cas dismisses before quickly moving back to the topic that’s been turning Dean inside out. “I do know you’re uncomfortable with your physical beauty.”
“Cas, please. We can talk about this. Please talk to me. Come on, man. I’m begging you, here. Don’t do this. Not now, not after—I just—I thought we were—I mean, haven’t you been—”
that,” Dean says. “It’s not about that. I think I’d just be uncomfortable knowing that people are looking at me that way.”
Dean’s brain shorts out at that one. He, uh. Yeah. Well. Okay.
“I adore the everloving shit out of you too, Dean,” Cas says with laughter in his voice. And on his face, too, because Dean can see that now. He doesn’t have to try to imagine the expressions to fit the voice. He has the whole picture.
He told Cas he loved him. Then Cas kept watching him, eyes all angelic and reverent or whatever. Obviously Dean had no idea how to move forward from there, so he jumped up from the bed and said “I - I’m gonna grab a beer, you want one? Let’s - come on, we’ll hang out in the kitchen” and practically ran from the room without waiting for an answer.
“Oh, I do. And I will.”
“That we might be the only two people in a hundred miles who like Spam?” Amal says, scanning Dean’s last item. They tell Dean his total and start bagging while Dean tries not to look incompetent with the card reader. “At least I’m in good company.”
good for him, actually! Now Dean can’t even think about his breathing because he’s too busy feeling his pulse pounding through him. He’s trying not to vividly imagine Cas in shorts that tight, and he’s failing miserably.
…?” Dean asks. He’ll ask direct questions, if he has to.
“Cas. Please. Just…” Dean sighs, setting down his sandwich. He’s still hungry, but he shouldn’t have his mouth full for this. “Can you just believe me when I tell you that there’s nothing on Earth I could do and not still need you? There’s no other path where I don’t need you. It doesn’t exist, okay? It doesn’t matter what I’m doing or where I am, I’m always gonna need you. For me. Not for your help, or because I owe you anything. But because I want you around. Everyone has their priorities, right? Well, you’re my priority, so get used to it.”
“Uh, all of them? No... Have you been praying a lot?”
“Well, I can and I do,” Cas says somewhat irritatedly.
Cas lowers his gaze even further, but he nods.
“I can’t be sure, but it’s starting to seem that way.”
“What kind of swimsuit do you have?”
Cas looks embarrassed, pleased,
He then spends the second half of the drive smiling dopily at the thought of calling Cas his boyfriend.
Cas’ fond little smile is all the warning Dean gets before he’s being kissed with more reverence than he’s ever felt in his life.
“I can’t stand you sometimes, Cas. I hate these stupid choices you make; you’re always finding a way to get the hell out of my life and I’m sick of it. Fuck you.”
“I look forward to testing it out,” Cas murmurs against Dean’s jaw right below his ear.
“Have a good night,” Amal says, winking again before hoisting the register drawer more securely in their arms and turning to leave.
handling the surface-level reading of this conversation. He cannot delve into trying to interpret anything beyond that or he’ll devolve into uselessness.
Dean takes a minute before he goes on. He knew that as soon as he went to open his mouth, it’d suddenly be difficult to talk again. For all it had felt like he’d been bursting at the seams with his feelings before, it had just been a feeling. His reality is more complicated. He’ll get into it once he starts, but he has to start. He has to start, knowing that where he’s going is a place he can never come back from.
Dean rolls his eyes (affectionately). He wishes Cas could see it. He’d love to know what Cas’ face is doing now, too.
Cas doesn’t elaborate. Dean supposes he doesn’t really need to.
“Is this - are you serious right now?” Dean asks.
“Goddammit Cas, don’t you dare disappear on me now. Cas? Cas! I know you can hear me. You think you can just keep on listening and never talk to me again? What’s the plan here, Cas? I really want to know,” Dean says, getting angrier with every word.
“I, uh, I mean I
“Savor it,” Cas repeats, mulling it over.
“I’ve never wanted someone like I want you. Not even close. When you’re not around, I need you back. When you’re right in front of me, I want you closer. It’s like - It’s like I want you inside me - metaphorically, literally, whole nine yards,” Dean says.
“Yeah, I thought, I could…” Dean started but was directly interrupted by the angel. He had an unusually urgent look on his face as if he wanted to make the other agree with him on something, at the best very fast.
“I will tell you,” Cas said after a while, probably staring at the birds singing in the treetops. “But it’s a longer story and we probably shouldn’t leave your family alone for so long.” Okay, the party inside was nothing Dean had thought about in the last couple of minutes but he only felt a slight sting of guiltiness.
Dean just had to smile. Castiel. Castiel had this mischievous look on his face as if he knew what Dean had been thinking. And Dean didn’t mind at all.
Dean’s hands, first shyly staying on Cas face wandered to his neck and tug at the others gorgeous hair. The sound the shorter man made at that was almost pornographic and Dean tried to remember why he came here but failed.
“With us probably meeting mom tomorrow evening, I just wanted for us to be... on the same page.” Damnit, why was this so stupidly hard? “Just, you know, what are we gonna tell her regarding... us. And Sky.”
“Michigan, I think,” Sam answered, putting his hand through his way-too-long hair. “But I remember her saying, that she was heading towards Ohio. Something about werewolves at Lake Erie.”
His brother seemed to want to say something, but the older Winchester already turned around and headed off. He hoped the others knew which life was to protect over all of theirs, even if they wouldn’t protect their own.
It was too late now, as Dean walked over to the door, took a deep breath and opened it.
It's me again!
Her emotion flickered very obviously across her face and Dean tried to catch every single one. First, her face fell in pure shock, then she gathered herself. After that, there was a tiny hint of anger and frustration and then she showed her nervous smile again.
On their way to the daycare, Cas told Dean about annoying students and even more annoying teachers and how one of his kids had thought, that world war two had happened only ten years ago.
"Just some- some guy asked for something dad apparently has stolen from them. Wouldn't tell me what it was but it seemed to be pretty important." Dean swallowed a sip of his tea. Buah, he'd never liked that stuff. Maybe he could convince his brother, that Bourbon would be better for his healing process.
After a few seconds of bathing in the peace and happiness, having been with Cas caused in him, Dean decided to call Benny and ask him to get him. The beta reacted quickly and only half an hour later, Dean was unlocking the trunk of his baby with Benny watching the busy street nearby.
"Nothing, it's just-" To hell with it. "I met this guy, Castiel, but I call him Cas for short, he says we're 'True Mates' or something like that, because he could smell me through my scent blockers and he smells like heaven, but that can't be because, ya know, I'm- I'm not a mating type of person, true or not and I just thought, since you know everything about everything, ya know..."
In fact, Dean had told her about his crush on his neighbor a week after he had repaired his car. He really didn’t want to hurt her feelings and therefore made sure, that she knew, what his mind was occupied with. She also had admitted, that it probably hadn’t been the best idea to marry, because of the probability to actually find romantic love, but he talked her out of it. Despite everything, he was very glad to be married to her.
"Dean." The younger Winchester sounded as if he knew what was about to come.
Dean heard Cas chuckle and looked up again. Damn, if it weren’t for those blue eyes, Dean thought. But he would have fallen in love anyway.
The next time Dean woke up, it was to an outright divine scent and more pain in his leg than his head. He took a deep breath and regretted it a little regarding the pain the movement caused in his back, but also cherished it because the scent calmed him down.
"Oh god, I'm so sorry," Cas repeated seemingly at a loss, fumbling around with his hands and trying not to touch Dean. "This has never happened to me before not with any of the two other omegas I have been with." At the mention of other omegas, his alpha could have had sexual interactions with, something inside of Dean wanted to whine again, but he suppressed it.
All right then, he thought and got himself ready for a fight. If Crowley dug himself into the dirt, there had to be a Winchester to dig him out again. It had always been like that and would probably stay this way forever.
"I think he's the one who killed my family by causing that car crash," Cas dropped like a bomb, his expression changing in one of distaste. "You know, the one that brought me back here." Dean could see Sam nod out of the corner of his eye, but could only stare himself.
“Zachariah has a brain tumour.”
"You know you should quit," Sam said, and Dean rolled his eyes because he had known this was about to come. "Having found your true mate and all, you could finally settle down into the life we were never allowed to have as kids."
"No, I wasn't," Dean tried to find an excuse but couldn't so he decided to drag a hand over his face, what resulted in some pain in his back. "I was just savin' Crowley's ass, ya know. The angels wanted to prove a point or something."
“Their combined energies seem to be very strong,” Sam observed the obvious. “Do you think they have some kind of… aid?”
He realized, that no matter what, they would love the hell out of the little girl if she wanted it or not. She was already part of the family and every person on this table would probably hold their hand in the flames for her if not worse.
He opened his eyes and lifted his head, just to see Cas sitting cross-legged in the chair, Sam had apparently vacated, reading a book. He looked up as he heard Dean move and his eyes went comically wide.
“I’m Castiel Novak.” He pointed in the direction of his house with his bags. “I live there.”
Dean had abandoned his cheeseburger completely. Back then it had been a really logical step to marry Jo, mostly because of the practicability of it but also because he didn’t want to be alone anymore. The ring on his finger meant that he belonged to somebody and he bet his kids would like to have an almost normally functioning family. Of course, he had stuffed his ring in his pocket while repairing the car and didn’t put it back on. Strangely he didn’t want to do it now, in front of Cas.
“Book of Enoch,” Sam said, and Cas seemed to want to add something, but he then refrained from it.
While he said this, Cas had moved his head out of the hug and his face was now very close to Deans. Concentrate Winchester; he needs you now. “Sam thinks so and he is the smart one,“ he answered while trying not to look at certain chapped lips.
After that, it took six months.
“That’s me,” a slim guy in his twenties said and stood up. The girl next to him, as Dean noticed rose her eyebrows and tried to hide a grin. In her case the older Winchester wouldn’t have believed his eyes either. The FBI, the facility they probably were the most sceptic towards, finally paid them attention and then because somebody of them claimed to have seen a creature, that was not even typical alien. She had nice blue eyes, though. For a crazy person.
Everything in himself screamed at him and went wonderfully quiet at the same time. Alpha. Mate. Home. Submit.
That didn’t mean, that Dean liked it of course. It was a chilly night in the end of October, barely above freezing temperature and Dean didn’t really take a warmer jacket than the usual leather.
“I’m sorry I told Sam.” There was a silence after this, Cas fidgeting with the hem of his way too fancy shirt but not breaking eye contact with Dean. “It’s okay,” he said after a while looking over at his daughter.
Sam is told about the baby and Team Free Will protects mother and child at night.
I have to admit, that this will be the last chapter of this work but... *drumroll*
Then he noticed the other's panicked expression. And the fear that ebbed like waves through their bond. Since Dean had tried to keep the communication between them at a minimum for this evening, he hadn't noticed anything unusual before, and he really wanted to slap himself in the face.
"If you don't believe me..." he stared, but Crowley stopped him with a movement of his hands.
Cas went first, leaving Dean and Skylar to be in the middle and Sam behind them. There was a flash of light, like before when the older Winchester had been outside and it lit up hundreds of demons standing still on the field in front of the bunker.
Opening the door and coming to the bed the older Winchester bounced Mia on his hip and then leaned her down to his son’s eye level. “Okay Mia, you know Jo already and I told you she was carrying two babies, right?” he explained to her, and she looked at him with a serious expression as if she was actually considering what he said.
"This is the last station. Ya should be gettin' out here, boy," the driver said, and Dean suddenly noticed, that it was dark and they were alone in the bus.  And that he was shaking.
With a sob, Dean got to his knees, grinned shortly at his brother who was covering up Glynn’s body and scooted over towards a bloody and completely wet angel.
His mate was in pain. Because of him. That was the first thing his brain caught until he remembered that he was pushing Cas away because he wanted to protect him from even greater pain. How could he explain to this young girl that not everybody was getting a happy ever after in life? How should he explain to her that destiny only existed in stories?
They sat down, ordered and Cas started to fiddle with his fingers. At that sight, Dean felt his heart sink and all he wanted at this moment was to comfort the other man. But he also wanted to hear the story so he sat back and waited, trying not to pressure Cas.
So, they just sat there, eating in silence and avoiding each other’s eyes. When Cas lunch break was over, Dean drove him back to the high school and found his own way back to work. Through all of the rest of the day, the mechanic's mind stayed with their conversation in the diner and the words he didn’t say.
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
? Now, when I've been so in love with you that I can't think straight for
He hums contentedly.
“Please do!”
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
Dean lifts his hands and spreads them with as guileless a grin as he can manage.
But Cas...
Sam gives him a broad grin and a thumbs up and leaves, letting the door close behind him.
“Yeah. Yeah, I do.”
He flops down on the bed and tries to sleep, but sleep doesn’t come. He can’t stop wondering if there’s some kind of law against calling an angel… that.
-italics- : memory, whether natural or fabricated
And knows, and names, and greets its godlike guest--
Dean braces himself for teasing from Sam, but his brother just looks at him with a soft smile.
Pushing himself back from the table with an apologetic pat to Iceland, Dean snips, “I don’t recall needing your permission or approval on how I live my life, Samuel." He does his best to look down his nose at Sam, the effect ruined somewhat by the reality that, even seated, Sam is taller and that Dean has to blink blearily to focus on him.
His fist rears back, goaded and pained beyond endurance, decades of fighting instinct overcoming even his drunken state, and his knuckles find Sam’s jaw.

The sound of stupid Yeti feet clomping after him has Dean cursing under his breath and debating simply running for the safety of his room. He’s not at all sure he wouldn’t simply end up eating concrete or taking a header into the wall if he tried it, though, so he focuses on navigating the hallway turns and trying to remember if he has another bottle or two in his room.

“I almost didn’t say anything.” His voice hitches, as though he cannot get the words out, and he heaves a deep breath, scrubbing a hand over his face and through his hair, ruffling it even more. “I would have kept this a secret for the rest of our lives, Dean. But I couldn’t- I couldn’t stand not…”

"Maybe." Dean murmurs, running his hands up Cas' arms to rest on his shoulders. "But I don't think even they would prank either of us today. I think... I think they were giving both of us a little time alone."
“Oh, yes. I find great pleasure in you giving over control to me, allowing me to take care of your desires and needs, and watching you obey when directed to do something.”
He’d been vulnerable before, with Castiel, but it had always been in the heat of the moment, in bright flares of pleasure that prompted him to bare his throat and give over in every line of his body. Can he make that choice deliberately? Can he simply decide to give himself over?

There’s a bit of discrepancy in that when Cas escapes the Empty in season 13, he supposedly was the first to ever get out at that point, but he’s brought back to life by Chuck after being exploded at Stull Cemetery. I’m choosing to reconcile that with the Shadow still being asleep at that point and so it didn’t notice Cas being yoinked.
When Dean is praying to Cas here, he is getting no connection. A dial tone.
"I mean, not that I'm not flattered, but this is- this is kind of out of nowhere and you're leaving tomorrow..." Dean swallows hard and his heart does not clench at the words, it absolutely does not. "I'm just wondering... why now?"

“Oh, hush,” Dean says softly, smiling, voice husked with emotion and he thinks Cas can tell what he’s thinking. Which doesn’t wig him out nearly as much as it used to. There’s something kinda nice in the idea that Cas might know all the things Dean wants so much to say all the time but can never quite find the words.
The corner of Cas’ mouth ticks up into the sweetest smile, the scrunch fading from his face, and Dean’s heart thumps. Fuck, he loves him so much. So fucking much he thinks he can’t hold it, that he must burst with the force of it and light the universe with the magnitude of all he feels for the being in his arms.
He works carefully, watching as clear water eases away blood and grime, and definitely not watching those blue eyes trained on his face.
," Cas whispers, staring at him, and he sounds as though he wants to protest Dean’s insult to his motivations. But, Dean shakes his head.
Charlie grins.
Dean lets out his own sigh, settling on his back on the bed and looks down at his angel. There is a warm bubble in his chest that simultaneously feels as though it will choke him and like it will replace all the air he could ever need. It really is better than anything else he can think of. Not that he would ever tell his Impala. He wouldn’t want to hurt her feelings. But maybe Baby would understand.
The back corner of the graveyard stretches away from him, a dark lawn of grass spotted with tottering headstones.
Dean shakes his head, breath caught in his throat somewhere between a sob and a disbelieving laugh. “If anyone ruined anything, it was both of us.” His fingers stroke along the curve of Cas’ jaw. He can’t seem to drop his hands, the feeling of stubble under his palms and Cas’ hands over his seeming like anchors for his sanity. “But who says anything’s got to be ruined?”
He’s aware that he sounds a bit breathless, but that’s appropriate, isn’t it? Cas doesn’t seem to notice, anyway.
And it boils down to that, Dean realizes. Because while he understands that Cas is reluctant because he’s afraid, Dean is also hurt. It’s irrational, but he wants Cas’ love for him to be stronger than that fear. He aches for Cas every moment of every day and every night. He’s barely functioning because he feels like his entire existence is on pause - he hadn’t expected to be in this prolonged state of limbo. He’d been ready for Cas. But it turns out he’d been ready for a different Cas, one he’d thought up in his head - because the real Cas, the Cas he loves, is too afraid to face him and Dean has no idea how long that’ll last. He has no idea when or even if Cas will come to him. Every moment that passes could be the moment before Cas finally talks to him. It’s agony. It’s wonderful.
“Hi, Cas,” Dean says.
“Should you be calling me that anymore?” Cas asks, bringing the banter to a halt.
“I don’t know, um. Which, uh, which store are you at?” Cas replies.
There’s a sharp intake of breath beside him, followed by an equally sharp pang of joy inside of Dean at eliciting it. It morphs into feeling like a case of the butterflies ramped up to eleven. He wants more of that.
“What the

Dean keeps an eye out for the discount furniture store; he knows it’s somewhere on this street.
“You might not be risking your life much anymore, but you don’t seem to be living for yourself, either,” Cas is saying now as Dean sits down with his plate.
, comes his imagination to fill in the blank.
Wait. What?
Dean waits a long time for a response.
“Obviously it’d be better if you were here. And I’m working on it, man, I swear. I work on it all the time,” Dean knows he’s babbling but he can’t stop. “I haven’t found anything yet, but I know it’s possible. I’m gonna get you out of there.”
Dean is euphoric. There’s no other word for it. He is intensely aware that this is the first time they’ve ever touched while officially in a romantic relationship. They haven’t talked about being a couple, but if Dean is certain about anything, he’s certain that’s what they are. No question that they’re together now. Together. Holding hands. It’s not even a kiss; it’s not the crack of sexual tension breaking. But it’s profound. It’s a sliding together of feelings. Dean’s love held open for Cas’s love to sink into.
“Shut the fuck up, Cas,” Dean interrupts, but there’s no heat to it. He clicks around on his laptop, absent-mindedly checking his email, giving himself something to do with his hands and gaze. “I don’t wanna hear any bullshit about what else in my life could be more important than this, because it’s bullshit. This isn’t up for debate.”
“Hello,” the cashier greets him, in a completely normal way that doesn’t hint towards having heard Dean talk to himself yet. Things could be worse.
“Yeah, she’s great. She was here with Kaia last week, actually…”
think that. And I meant what I said before.”
Dean doesn’t want to, he really, really doesn’t want to, but he’s starting to get pissed off.
Dean is crazy—he knows he’s crazy, but Cas’ voice dropped just the smallest bit, didn’t it? That shouldn’t be possible. Dean is going insane right now.
“The grocery store, dude. Same as last time. Why?”
“But Dean, you’re not fighting anyone; there’s no looming threat. You could do anything you want, now. You don’t need me for that. And you don’t owe me anything.”
“That witch just made it so I could hear you, huh?” Dean realizes aloud. “You were listening all along and then suddenly I could hear you talk back. That must have scared the shit out of you, huh? How many times did you hear me—”
“Are you sure? I really don’t want to make you uncomfortable,” Cas says, but Dean shakes his head. Cas has it all wrong.
“And?”
“Yeah, you were insane for that. Wait, that was after the library.”
“Y - yeah?” Dean says, his voice cracking. He clears his throat.
“Huge understatement, actually. I don’t even - I - I can’t - “ Dean takes a breath and starts over. Decides to start simple. “I don’t want to live without you.”
“In hindsight it feels like I should have realized. But I can’t sense how strongly you feel about other people. I can only use your actions to compare,” Cas asks. He breaks their eye contact to look back down at their joined hands, stroking his thumb back and forth over the first knuckle of Dean’s index finger. “And you’re always so - you get so angry. With me in particular, I mean. Compared to everyone else.”
When he’s done putting away his clothes, Dean turns off the light and slips out into the hallway to find Sam.
Cas is silent. Dean is silent. The floor is cold.
that as soon as he’s ready to actually say all that, it’s going to be much more difficult to find the words. Of course the words are only available before he’s ready to use them.
conversation, which may or may not even be something floor-worthy.
“Yeah, actually. Damn, it’s 3 AM. How long have we been talking?”
“Of course,” Cas says.
“Is it even possible to feel more anticipation than we already do?” Cas asks. He’s got one eyebrow raised skeptically and Dean loves him so fucking much.
Dean smiles.
There. That was it.
Doesn’t matter. He can’t think of a single thing to say, and it’s starting to really piss him off. He’d joked before about sweeping Cas off his feet, but goddammit, part of him had really wanted to try! He still really, really wants to try.
“Cas…” Dean starts, but he doesn’t actually know where he wants to end up.
“I think I understand what you mean about the bed vs. the couch. Here on the bed, there’s a lot of space for me to just push you over and pin you down... It’s really, really distracting.”
THE END
“You used to think it was creepy, the way I looked at you,” Cas says. Dean can’t place his tone of voice, but he’s definitely not angry.
“I do not care. Like, at all.”
Dean’s room is a mess. It’s a disaster.
Cas’ voice really does it for him.
“I’m pretty simple when it comes to stew, especially this one. Just beef, potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, beef broth, a bit of tomato paste, worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper… Garlic, rosemary, bay leaf.”
“I hadn’t really thought about it, Dean.”
Cas gives a long-suffering sigh. Dean wishes he could see the accompanying eye roll.
“I already looked for him, in the Empty! And I pulled him out. It was a whole thing! I think the ball’s in his court now.”
“Thank you?” Cas asks.
“Getting in line to check out now, so I’ll have to let you go in a minute. ”
“I have no idea, dude,” Dean says. He cranes his neck to check the other registers, but he doesn’t see Amal anywhere. “Doesn’t look like it.”
“You think you’d like that? Let go of control, let people think what they want?” Cas asks. “Because there are lots of things I’d love to see you wear, if you’d be interested. If you could be comfortable.”
“Cas?” Dean says, trying and failing to conceal the alarm in his voice.
“No, I didn’t know if you were. So I didn’t. Just talking to you was enough.”
Dean rests his forehead on the steering wheel and tries to breathe without breaking into sobs. He takes a deep breath in and out. Tips his head side to side, because part of him has to keep moving. This desperate feeling in his chest is like a motor that’s always wound up, and he’s gonna start punching things if he tries to keep still. But it’s not enough. His hands come up to grip the steering wheel on either side of his face, and he squeezes hard enough to hurt his fingers. It’s not enough. He reaches his thumbs out to dig into the sides of his head, just above his brow. It’s not enough.
“Moving on is a good idea,” Cas says. “I don’t think a potion would work unless you wanted a one-way trip. You’d have to take the risk that the dose for the return trip actually makes it with you. I don’t have any confidence that it’s possible to bring something like that along.”
“Are you okay, Dean?”
“Dean.”
“I’m just glad this is happening, I guess.”
Dean legit wants to cry at the implication that he’d only seek Cas out if he needed something from him. His resolve to have this conversation strengthens, because that’s messed up. He messed up with Cas, over and over. Time and again he’s failed to let Cas know how much he’s valued. How can he even begin to fix that?
Talking to Cas throughout his daily life had been one of the most calming, intrinsically good experiences he’s ever had. He misses it.
“You’re in a good mood,” Cas remarks. A bit sullenly? Is Dean hearing that right?
“Honestly man, I’m still kinda confused about all this. If you could feel how much I needed you...” Dean doesn’t even know how to finish that question, or what he’s even asking.
“Right,” Dean says. “But you felt all that - that longing, or whatever. Years of it. All the times I - all the times you weren’t around. And all the times you were around but I - I wanted more. And you figured what? That I just felt that way about everyone?”
Dean prays silently then for a hole to open under his feet and swallow him.
“Like I said, I never expected to have any of these moments at all. I’m - I definitely feel unprepared for this conversation.”
Dean does pat the bed then; he can’t help it. He won’t pretend he doesn’t want this.
“Cas. Hey,” Dean says, in a more serious tone than he’s used so far.
What was it? What is the thing that Cas wants more than anything else in the world? Something that’s somehow related to Cas telling Dean he loves him?
“No, no catch. I think we’d know by now. I was just curious how it happened,” Cas says.
“There really is nothing, Dean!”
Dean knows what gives, but at the same time? He doesn’t really. Cas is obviously reluctant to talk to Dean after what he’d said to trigger his deal with the Empty. He’d said all that under the assumption that he’d never have to face a response. Dean understands. He would definitely feel the same if he were in that position. But Cas? Cas is the bravest, purest, and most sincere person that Dean has ever met. How could someone like that be afraid to talk to someone like Dean?
Cas. Asking if they’d be
“I don’t wanna hide from you anymore, Cas,” Dean says. “I can’t promise I’ll ever be any good at telling you how I feel, but I swear I’ll try. And I can show you, too.”
“I can’t believe this is happening,” Dean says.
It used to be that Dean would have a thought like “wow Cas is so cute”, and wave it away, embarrassed for himself even in his own mind. Even last week, he might have done that. But now? Now Dean feels turned inside out. It doesn’t feel like he’s exposed, though. He feels… cozy.
think, he says. Cas is one of those people. A person who looks at Dean, and sees—
Dean goes insane over that, he truly does, but it’s also too funny not to laugh. Cas’ words are sexy as hell, but he looks and sounds adorably grumpy. It’s ridiculously attractive and also just ridiculous.
