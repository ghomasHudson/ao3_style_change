“It's alright. There are many of us and few enough clients that I can go for weeks without one. Besides, there are safeguards. Clients can't technically make us do anything we're uncomfortable with.” There were even guards to ensure this rule.
“I suppose it started similar to your story. Not with the districts, of course. But I never met my mother, at least not that I remember. I was very young when she died.”
“No! But maybe you could... I don't know.” Cas sighed, then muttered: “Maybe I should have asked the High Enchantress for an incantation against her.”
Mary must have seen him unwrap them, because she came over with a shy smile on her face. “You mentioned that you liked Slaughterhouse-Five and Sam said you've probably never had occasion to read any of his other novels. So I thought...” She trailed off, biting her lower lip.
“That sounds good. I've never had waffles.” Castiel had eaten a variety of food in his time as a human, but most of it had been scraps of whatever he could find, whatever the shelter he had been at or the Gas 'n Sip had offered. Some of it had been warm and nourishing, and he had been grateful for all of it, but it hadn't exactly been something he had chosen.
Ezekiel shrugged. It looked almost comical, this great warrior confined to the small frame of a child. “It's not exactly a task that will bring glory, but it is necessary.”
Dean stepped closer, but waited for Cas to initiate the kiss. He wasn't disappointed. When they stepped apart, Dean realised this was the first time they had kissed in front of other people, even if no one was paying particular attention to them. It made his heart soar for some reason.
“Probably because they were afraid you'd have them punished for insolence.” How Dean managed to sound both bashful and mischievous at the same time, Castiel didn't understand.
Libraries? Plural? Gods, the palace must have been even bigger and fancier than Dean had imagined from what little he had seen of it so far.
The sex scene is pretty well announced I would say, starts after they kiss in the motel and lasts 'til the end of the chapter – just in case you wanna skip it. :)
For a moment, Castiel was afraid he would see Dean sitting close to someone, maybe in their lap, but he didn't spot him at all. He frowned, then turned towards one of the employees who was sipping on her wine alone, reclined on a chaiselongue next to a magic light. Castiel wondered briefly if the lights were enough, if the people here were warm enough. He hadn't actually come here to plan out their placement as he had with the courtyard, had never actually stepped foot here for the preparation of any previous festival. He wondered if the employees knew and resented him for it.
“There were some deaths. Looked like animal attacks, but there also seemed to be an organ or two missing,” Dean explained around another mouthful of bacon.
“What's wrong with my old clothes?” Dean grumbled, pulling Castiel from his musing. He turned in the chair, in which he had taken position at Dean's reading table. It wasn't the first time Dean made this argument, if it could even be called that, and Castiel had a feeling that it wouldn't be the last time.
Castiel glanced back at his papers and sighed. He had wished for a distraction, but this was certainly not what he had envisioned. Still, he knew that when Hester got like this, she would stop at nothing until she had her will, even if she had to cause a scene in front of the whole court. Resigning himself to his fate, Castiel straightened his robe and followed his sister.
Sam flushed because yeah, that was what most of the others called her. And both she and Sam were very much okay with that, if he was being honest. But since when was he honest with his brother? “Shut up,” he muttered, but couldn't quite keep a smile off his face.
“Your highness,” Hester called back, frowning as she stepped into the room. The High Enchantress MacLeod was nowhere to be seen.
Slowly, Cas' hand wandered from Dean's knee to his back, and he allowed Cas to shuffle closer until his head was against Dean's belly. He put his own hand on the back of Cas' head without really meaning to, played with his hair.
It was the middle of the night, and Dean hated waking up to nothing but darkness when it reminded him so much of his time under Michael. Whenever it hadn't been blood and fire, it had been darkness, swallowing him, drowning him. But at least right now, Cas was there, warm and solid against him, a reminder that he wasn't alone, that he hadn't drowned, that he was back. That he was okay.
“But isn't it... I can't imagine it. Having to go along with whatever client comes along, no matter what they're like.” He said 'client' like it was a dirty word.
Ezekiel looked like he wanted to say more, but then he straightened and turned, opening the doorway to Heaven. They had discussed this on angel radio, though not in great detail. It had been more of a 'Hey I want to do this, see you in a couple hours' kind of thing.
“No, but...” Cas frowned. “I'm surprised. The only nickname I ever got is, well...” He glanced down into the courtyard, probably at where Gabriel was currently enjoying himself with his posse. “I like 'Cas'.” He made air quotes around his own nickname. Because of course he did.
“I know. We can be dirty together.” Cas sounded satisfied, even though Dean could feel his erection against his hip.
He was exhausted. The festival was always difficult to plan, but this year the bakery they bought from when the kitchens couldn't handle all that they needed had changed their menu, taking a couple of things off of it that were absolutely crucial to the festival, being the favourite foods of some of the guests.
“Good.” Dean leaned against Castiel's side. “I hear it can be kinda weird for kids when their parent starts dating someone. But maybe that's more a thing when the parents are divorced or one of them died or something.” He frowned. “Not sure how kids usually react when two of their parents start dating.”
And then Castiel stopped coming. After a week, Dean was starting to get worried, wondering if something had happened. The others kept telling him that nobles were capricious, changing their opinions and their preferences every five minutes. After two weeks, on the night of the spring festival, they had managed to convince Dean that Castiel wasn't coming back. That he had gotten what he wanted and had now moved on to greener pastures. Maybe he had married a nice noble, or was busy fucking a kitchen employee.
Dean stared down at where Castiel's hand was resting on his exposed skin, the sleeves of his robe still bunched up at his elbows. Then he looked back to his toe, really seeing it for the first time in several minutes. He really was picking it apart. Dean stilled his hands.
Sam couldn't help but notice how much in her element she seemed. Usually, she was a bit shy and insecure, but now, she even laughed with Dean as he purposely got flour onto Cas' face, who scrunched up his nose something fierce. Up until a while ago, Maggie had been extremely nervous around Cas, always dropping things and barely getting a word out. Like many others, she had probably been scared of him, and considering her personality, it probably hadn't helped that Cas could be very blunt and downright sarcastic at times. It was understandable, too, after what had happened in her world. And really, Sam thought that any reasonable person would be scared of angels, especially if they knew what powers they had.
“It's exhausting, trying to be perfect all the time.” Dean thought about his childhood for a moment, then realized he had been staring off into empty space. Prince Castiel was looking at him curiously. Dean picked at his toe harder. “I'm sure I cannot even imagine how big the expectations are for a Prince.”
“Weren't you like, two?” Dean said, doing the mental maths quickly, based on when he knew the Princess had died.
“That's one word for it,” Dean muttered, earning some chuckles from the others. He had known that not everyone in Cas' family might agree with his visits to the Harem, but he hadn't thought it to be quite that bad. Most people nowadays were relaxed about this sort of thing, but Good Heavens, that man was clearly not.
“Cassie! I'd say it's nice of you to come by, but we both know you're not here for me.” Gabriel smirked. “Can't find Dean? Hey, can anyone go and-”
“So you've met Dean,” Castiel said carefully, holding back a wince as her face fell. “I haven't been able to get him a proper attire yet, but with any luck I will hear back from the tailor and shoe maker soon-”
“Actually, I thought we could watch the fireworks together.” Cas looked shy again, looking up at him through his eyelashes.
“Are those hearts?” There were a lot of shapes, but somehow, this one stood out to Dean. He hadn't thought it would be possible to make something with both sharp angles and curvatures with the same enchantment.
Dean had half-expected some commentary from the sidelines, but when he looked at the others, he found that even Claire's eyes were shiny, if not wet yet.
“Your highness!” the person said, growing even paler, throwing an anxious look around, possibly for a place to set down the pies.
“You should go and make sure that they don't come here,” Eileen told him. “Someone will probably want to come look for us soon, but they'll listen to their Chief.”
Back in their room, Dean used his phone to look up details on the case – yeah, he was already thinking of it as a case. “Police reported claw marks on the vics, and that they were all missing the same organ, but it still doesn't say which one,” he told Cas, who had sat down on the edge of their bed. “It's right around the corner, in a suburb a little to the north.”
Dean looked at him for a long moment, finding nothing but honesty and nerves on his face. “Of course. What do you want to talk about?”
Dean beamed at him, sliding their fingers together. “It's different though, right? I mean, Gabriel's not anyone's companion.”
Instead, he went for his bag, which had been left by the bed. After rummaging in it for a bit, Dean pulled out the wall hanging. It didn't really fit in here, he realized, looking far too plain between all this splendour, and he almost put it back. But then he decided to go for it anyway. He didn't exactly fit in here, either, but he'd be damned if he let that limit him.
“Of course I'm thinking werewolf. I mean, what kinda animal gets into a family home, kills everyone, then rips the same organ out of all four of its victims?” Dean put down his phone.
It was another week before Castiel made it to the Harem again, a small smile tugging at his lips at the prospect of seeing Dean again. When he spotted Dean in one of the alcoves, though, Castiel's mood immediately dropped.
“And how old are you?” Castiel frowned. “Either you are much older than you look, or you have no right calling your brother a baby.”
It was so nice and warm in Cas' arms that Dean was out before he could be self-conscious about the loud moan he had let out when coming.
Then it was fully gone, and he blinked a few times before looking down again, feeling light.-headed. The cut on his throat hurt, he realized, touching it to find blood on his fingertips. His mind was blank and yet a whirlwind, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to sing and dance or fall to his knees and cry.
“It's afternoon, Gabriel,” the person behind him said. Dean hadn't paid any attention to them when they'd entered, thinking they may be a visiting royal from another land or a noble person, but if they were addressing the Prince without his title, they must be a lot closer to him than Dean thought.
Castiel gritted his teeth. “There may not even be anything to think through. I'm not sure... I haven't even spoken to him about it yet. He may decline.”
Castiel ran after him, fearing he had gotten hurt or that something displeased him, but he was just gaping at the tiled interior of the room.
“Yeah, yeah. Work this, work that. Now sit down and relax, will you?” Prince Gabriel grinned and dragged them over to the alcove where Dean and several 'waiting ladies' as they were officially called, sat. Prince Gabriel shoved the person onto the cushions at one end, then squished himself between Sara and Ava. “Miss me?” he asked them suggestively.
Castiel was also worried about Jack. Castiel and Dean had been dating (though that term seemed woefully inadequate) ever since Castiel had been brought back from the Empty, which had been shortly after Jack's birth. But they hadn't made their relationship public, not even telling Sam, so Jack wasn't used to seeing them as a couple. He wondered if he would ever get used to it, then wondered if they would ever even tell anyone. Castiel would have loved to hold Dean's hand in public, would have shouted his love for him from the rooftops if he was allowed, but Dean didn't want that and Castiel respected his wishes. Perhaps Dean would never want to make it public, and Castiel would have to live with that, though he wondered how they would explain to people that they were retiring and, possibly, moving somewhere together. But Castiel could be content, he told himself, even if he had to tamper down his feelings for Dean in front of their family forever.
Good question. Cas had still been with Dean after he had brought him something to eat, and maybe he had stayed there a little longer, but he wouldn't have spent the night in his room, right? Dean wouldn't have let him stay to watch him again. But maybe Dean hadn't been tired after sleeping so long, and they had stayed up and talked. Or Dean may have fallen asleep before he could berate Cas for wanting to 'watch over him'.
“I've been called a lot of things, but sweet is rarely one of them.” Dean grinned. “So, dinner and a walk afterwards? Wait, is dinner a family affair or something?”
“You will come with me, and we'll have you examined by the High Enchantress. We'll get you looked at by all physicians in the kingdom, if need be!” She stomped out, leaving the door open behind her.
“I would prefer for you not to die. And if your arteries clog up in a few years... I might not be able to help you anymore.” Cas was still looking down at the plate, but his mind seemed to be far away.
Out of the corner of an eye, he saw Cas turning his head, but then he was jumped by the two wolves again and concentrated back on the battle. Dean also had to focus back on the wolf in front of him, who was grinning, his stance wide open, as if he wasn't scared of anything Dean might throw at him.
“Wait. You want to sleep with me?” Castiel was confused. Why someone as good looking as Dean would want to sleep with him when he probably could have anybody was beyond him.
Castiel sighed. MacLeod worked mostly in exchange for information, which to her seemed to be equivalent to gossip. “His name is Dean,” he said, knowing he would get through this faster if he complied. He frowned, realizing he had never asked Dean's last name. “He was born in the Marrigold district and has a brother in the Academy of the Golden Sun.” He didn't believe any of this was a secret. Nevertheless, he felt slightly guilty for speaking so openly about what Dean had told him in private.
After one and a half weeks, though, the others had mostly grown tired of bugging him and had turned to other, even juicier gossip. Dean encouraged it, not really caring about any scandals, but glad that he wasn't the centre of attention anymore.
“I'm an angel, Dean, and it's only natural that they would harbour some reservations against my species given the occurrences in their world.”
“Maybe.” Castiel smiled. “Or maybe I'm right and you're far sweeter than you give yourself credit for.”
He played around with the lights for an amount of time that he would never admit to anyone, then turned them all off and went back to the bedroom part. There was a small study next to the bathroom, even though there was also a reading table in the bedroom, which seemed superfluous, but whatever.
“Complicated,” Cas said grimly, but his grip on Dean's hand tightened, a small but reassuring gesture.
“Cas, come on,” he whispered, sounding needy to his own ears, but Cas just smiled again and gave him what he wanted.
Dean nodded. Why would he? He was just an employee, and they didn't even rank that high in the palace. Some would probably consider them the lowest, even.
“Okay, breathe.” Dean looked him straight in the eyes. “It's fine, alright? I'm not a kid, you don't gotta organize food for me, I can get my own. Well, at least I can get a servant to bring me some, which... how awesome is that? Anyway, I was thinking maybe you could show me around a little after dinner if you're not too tired, so I'll know how to get to the front yard and stuff.”
Dean only used it when he wasn't sure of his way, or to double-check that his sense of orientation was correct. Though he also used it to keep a wide berth around Hester's rooms. Not that he even knew if she would be in there at this time of day.
“Heaven, if we can. I mean, I don't see why they shouldn't take these folks in. It's not like there's all that many angels left in this world, anyway.”
“Ugh. Can you believe this guy? He's sooo formal. Everything has to be exactly the correct way. So boring.” Prince Gabriel reached for the bottle of wine that was standing in the middle of the table and Sara got up to fetch him a glass. She also put one in front of Prince Castiel.
The day before, it had already been dark when they had made it to the court yard, only magic lights illuminating the place. But this morning, the sun was peeking out over the rim of the building opposite him, its weak rays painting soft edges and pastel colours in front of his eyes.
“Again, I apologize. I would understand if you are... displeased.” Cas said it carefully, as if voicing his fears might conjure them into being.
So. Uh. I don't really have anything to say in my defense on why this is so late, except that life, depression and writer's block got in the way. Anyway. Hope you still enjoy it.
But Castiel endured it, as he had endured the endless tirade of 'Heavens bless you, how are things at the palace?' and 'Oh my, it is still rather chilly, do you think we will get a cold summer?'. Castiel was neither a fan of open questions, nor a meteorologist, but he had suffered through, and had said things like 'My dear baroness, I do believe we have found something of interest for your vase collection' and 'Oh my, how your child has grown, I barely recognized them'. He had also had to talk about the weather, as if they hadn't all been standing outside, perfectly aware of the cloudless sky (courtesy of the Head Enchantress) and the cool air that was warmed by the myriad of both regular and magical fires carefully placed throughout the courtyard.
Castiel waved him off, not turning around because he didn't trust himself not to fall if he looked over his shoulder instead of the path in front of him. Maybe the thirst was what caused the light-headedness, or maybe it was just the drastic change from angel to human, but he stumbled more than once on the short way to the Impala.
“That's not... what-” The person frowned at the Prince again. “I have no idea what you're saying. Anyway. I should leave now.”
“We don't have to worry about your little toys anymore,” the wolf growled, and licked his lips, getting ready to attack again.
Dean nodded slowly. “Okay,” he said, sounding a little choked up, and Castiel leaned over to kiss his cheek.
Shaking his head, Dean gestured for Cas to get up. “And you wanna snag the cookies and eggnog before the kid wakes up, so he'll think... you know you'll just be feeding this idea of his, right?”
Soooo, the sex scene in this got more emotional than intended lmao. (insert 'escalated quickly' meme here) (Seriously, though, I don't know what happened, I guess I was in a particular mood)
Dean didn't know if he meant Sam and him, or just him specifically, and he didn't dare to ask. He turned away, still grappling with this new information. In the end, he went to join the others by the tree to see if he could help them, and he and Cas didn't talk about it again that day.
“Cas,” he whispered when they broke apart, their faces still close, still able to feel each other's breath on their lips.
“Well, I was thinking about getting with a few of these lovelies.” Gabriel touched the cheek of one of the women. “If you don't need Dean, I was planning on taking him too. The more, the merrier.” Gabriel's grin faltered at the look on Castiel's face. “What's up, Cassie? Someone piss in your dinner?”
And then Prince Castiel returned, standing in the middle of the room like a deer in the torch light.
“I'm sorry,” Castiel wheezed, wiping his eyes. “It's just... no one has ever said that to me. Hah!” His body was still constricting with laughter, though he managed to keep it silent. “I have been told many things, been praised by countless people, but that was never in anyone's repertoire.”
Castiel nodded. “That's good, then. But don't you.” He frowned. “Apologies, I mean no disrespect, but why do you work here?”
Mary and Bobby arrived in the afternoon, clearly having come straight from their last hunt if their exhausted features and stiff backs were any indication. They came to greet Dean and Castiel, who were still in the kitchen, Mary's eyes shining in amusement at her son baking, or maybe at the fact that they were both covered in flour at this point. Dean joked about someone in their family needing to learn how to cook and bake and Mary snorted, but didn't argue.
Tonight, he felt tears spring to his eyes as Cas kept caressing him, kissing his hips, his leg, the inside of his thigh.
“I've been thinking about it for years,” Cas admitted, squeezing Dean's shoulder, “so it is, in fact, well thought out.”
Castiel woke up warm, though the skin on his face was cool. He smelled the ashes of a fire that must have been burning mere hours ago, a familiar smell in this season, but there was also a faint trace of musk and roses, and an overlying layer of a very unfamiliar scent that told him that he wasn't in his own chambers. Opening his eyes, he found that the world was plunged in darkness. The sun probably wasn't up yet. He felt the linen of the bed he was on. Silken sheets, smelling of that same unfamiliar musk. Then, slowly, he remembered.
“Was this all made for giants?” Dean asked as they ascended a set of stairs. A long, exhausting set of stairs.
“The what?” Dean stared at him. Who was getting crowned? Had something happened to the king? No, it must be a coronation in a different kingdom. But why did they need to prepare anything, then?
“What's going on?” Sam asked in confusion, and Cas repeated what they knew, signing for Eileen with one hand tightly wrapped around his angel blade.
“M-hm,” he made, already dozing off. The last he knew was that Cas pressed a kiss to the side of his face.
“We can eat later and I'm sure your work can wait a couple minutes, too. You said you don't have any meetings today.” Dean had already moved on the bed, sitting behind Cas' back now, kneading his shoulders.
“It would mean that you get your own rooms next to mine. And that you would be expected to go to official functions with me. And-”
They didn't tell anyone about their plans for retirement or Cas giving up his grace right away, and no one seemed to have picked up on that thing between them yet, either, even if Dean's mom kept looking at them with a curious glint in her eyes. But Sam seemed to get more and more worried about Dean spending so much time in his room, and Dean was afraid he would try to get him out of his shell sometime soon, probably with a hunt. So before his brother could come up with anything interesting, Dean announced that him and Cas would drive over to the next big town to do some Christmas shopping, and asked everyone who needed something to put it down on a list. Cas added that they should write down their names next to the items so they could make sure to give it to the right person. Later, he told Dean that it might help him remember the people's names if he saw them written down.
“I would never do something against your will.” Castiel felt a little guilty, considering what they were currently doing. “You don't need to be afraid of me.”
“We're talking about you, Dean. When I first met you, you were barely able to see your own worth. I had hoped that had changed over the years, but obviously you need to be reminded every now and then.”
“Yeah, I'm... Hey, listen.” Dean might not have a great track record with talking about his feelings, but the last time he had really done it, it had gotten him a relationship with a freaking angel. So why not try and be a little more open again. “There's something I've been... meaning to... You know, I...” Okay, just because he had decided to try didn't mean he actually knew how to do it.
But before Sam could leave, Dean asked: “Wait, what about food? I haven't eaten in, like, half a year.”
Dean snorted. Maybe Star Trek night hadn't been the best idea, after all. “Okay, Spock. So long as you live long and prosper.”
Dean had gone hunting with his father numerous times. He had been in bar fights against guys twice his size since he was about twelve. Around here, he had slacked off a bit, but there were enough wine crates to carry and he liked to fool around with the guard dogs (and sometimes with the guards), so he kept at least a little bit in shape.
“Nope.” Dean rubbed his stomach. “I kinda overdid it with the pie, to be honest. But I could eat again now.”
“I haven't had that much – well I suppose I drank some when I thought you were... I was so jealous of the Lady Margaret. Heavens.”
“Yes, Michael will be crowned king in the near future. As I said, officially our father has abdicated and retired to a secluded location. I imagine that in one or two years, we will release a statement pronouncing him dead.”
Surprisingly, Gabriel and Eileen signed to each other pretty much the whole time without speaking aloud, and Dean was lost to their conversation from the start. “Damn, I need to learn more ASL.”
He had read a lot about parent-child relationships before, and also after, Jack's birth, and several sources had pointed out that children generally didn't like if their parents started dating someone new. And event though Dean had been close with the Bobby of this world, this was a different version, from a world where Sam and Dean never existed, one who didn't have much history with the brothers except what had happened in the last few months.
There was something scary about all this, about the prospect of his life changing so drastically. Not that he didn't want that, hell, he had wanted it for a while, but now that it was becoming more tangible, it was actually within reach, Dean found himself afraid of the implications. He didn't know how to live a normal life, without monsters, or... or with garden parties or whatever. He had tried that with Lisa, all those years back, and how had that ended? Well, it had ended with Sam coming back, but even before that, Dean hadn't been able to keep his hunter instincts at bay, to stow the paranoia whenever a floor tile creaked. Not completely.
After locking the door behind them, Dean let himself fall onto the bed face first, then tested the mattress with his hand. Not exactly memory foam, but not bad for a cheap motel, either. It seemed pretty clean, too. Before Cas could even ask him what he was doing, though, Dean got back up and declared that he needed a shower, then fled into the bathroom.
“Do you wish for me to set your table, your highness?” they asked, for the first time sounding insecure.
Cas joined them again, Claire's present back in his hands, and he smiled as he unwrapped it, revealing a box with two figurines in them. One of them was holding a knife that looked suspiciously like an angel blade, dressed in jeans and a denim jacket. The other one was wearing a beige trench coat.
“I can only assume. I haven't been invited yet and haven't asked if those tea parties include mad magicians and heads being chopped off.” There was a twinkle of humour in the baker's eyes, and Dean laughed.
“Hey, I'm not judging.” Gabriel looked to Ezekiel, who raised an eyebrow, then shrugged. “You wanna fall in love with a frog, be my guest.”
“Thank you, sweetie. I think with everything that's happened lately and with all the hunts, no one had really been thinking about Christmas yet, even if it's just a few days away. Maybe after all this time of fighting, we can give these people a proper Christmas.”
“What's wrong with my old clothes?” Dean grumbled, pulling Castiel from his musing. He turned in the chair, in which he had taken position at Dean's reading table. It wasn't the first time Dean made this argument, if it could even be called that, and Castiel had a feeling that it wouldn't be the last time.
“Yeah. Yes, of course.” Dean still had a far off look on his face, but he let Castiel kiss him and even smiled afterwards.
Cas sighed, but rolled over, and they got some wet towels from the bathroom. When they got back, Cas just sat at the edge of the bed, looking defeated. Dean wrapped his arms around him from behind, leaving a kiss on his neck.
So after Dean tried to be snarly about it not being worth the cost if he had just one mixtape, he agreed that they may as well listen to it, so soon
“I take it you haven't been in the palace for long... your highness.” The baker's voice was calm and relaxed, but the slight hesitation betrayed how careful they still were.
“Undoubtedly.” Prince Castiel looked at him for a long moment. “Can I ask you for something... indecent?”
“Cas, if you still feel that way tomorrow... Ask me again, okay? It's fine if you don't, but... if you really mean this...” He didn't dare end that sentence.
Castiel used his own foot to scope out the location of Dean's feet. “As far as I can tell, all of your extremities are where they should be,” he informed him. Dean snorted. “And yes, I do get horny sometimes, though rarely.”
“Well, everyone except me, apparently. I mean, I knew there was something going on, but...” He put all of Cas' clothes onto a chair. “Didn't know they were at that stage yet. Guess I was kinda distracted.”
Dean hadn't been too pleased with how detached that sounded at the time, but now he was wondering what Cas would think about it without his grace. As a human, would he still be so nonchalant about a finger in his ass?
“We'll get him a neck pillow,” Dean mumbled as he pressed his face against Castiel's chest, and promptly fell asleep again.
“Here.” Dean held a glass of Champagne out, waiting until Cas had wormed his hand out from under the blanket he was wrapped in to take it.
He took a sip, seeing Cas do the same while Donna moved on to pull Sam and Eileen into a bear hug. They spent some more time hugging people and saying Happy New Year to everyone before they were alone again.
“Are you here for another massage?” Dean sat down on his bed, hoping that Castiel would join him. He wasn't disappointed, though the prince left a bit of distance between them.
“You need new clothes,” Castiel reminded him absent-mindedly, scribbling a few notes for his meeting with the Lady Moseley in less than an hour. Even though the lady did not come from a house of nobles, she had revealed a great talent for the art of trade, and had even managed to replace the previous president of the merchant guild not long ago. Some (mostly nobles) begrudged her low-born origins, but she exuded an aura of authority that most of them lacked. Besides, with more commoners entering the guild and even taking key positions, it had only been a matter of time before one of them took the highest office in their ranks. Castiel was secretly pleased with this development, though he had an inkling that Lady Moseley did not return his sympathies. After all, he was a prince, and therefore essentially one of those who had done their utmost to bar her from the successes she had worked so hard to achieve.
With a snap, Castiel was dressed again, the trench coat rustling around his thighs. He could have dressed normally, as humans did, but the sound might have woken Dean again.
“I do think some of the things in there are anatomically implausible,” Cas said later, while they were lying in bed. “But others seemed rather intriguing. Perhaps we could try them sometime.”
Dean sighed, reclining further back into the cushions. He didn't usually mind working in the Royal Harem, but on some days, when there was nothing but idle chit chat to entertain them, it was dreadfully boring.
When Cas' cock pushed into him, Dean reached out, grabbing his arm, his shoulder, whatever he could reach. He needed Cas closer, as if that was even possible with them joined like this, but Cas didn't protest, just let himself be reeled in as he slowly sank into him, careful, tender,
Castiel glared at her. “I did not choose Dean purely to enrage my family, if that is what you're asking.”
Dean turned off the water and dried his hands on a towel next to the sink, then walked in the direction the voice was coming from. As he rounded the corner, he spotted another person, who could only be described as burly. They had their back to Dean as they called again: “Lily?”
Cas reached out with his hand again, and Dean leaned down enough so he could cup his cheek with it. “You are,” Cas said, and Dean had to look down, had to concentrate on his thrusts so he didn't let his emotions flow over, so his eyes wouldn't fill up with tears from the love of his life telling him he was perfect.
Cas raised an eyebrow. “No, Dean, the king was not travelling for the last ten years. Well, I suppose we didn't spin that story at first. We managed to conceal that he was missing for quite some time. But eventually...” Cas moved his head to the side, his spine cracking. “We tried finding him for several years. It wasn't too long ago that I went on the last excursion to search for him. Of course officially, we were making our rounds through the kingdom to ensure the well-being of our people. Which really wasn't such a bad thing to do. We encountered quite a few troubled villages and were able to alleviate most of their concerns. But we never found the king.” He smiled sadly. “And now we have decided to move forward, hence the coronation.”
, Cas.” Dean suddenly remembered that they weren't alone in the bunker, far from it, and while the walls were thick, people might still hear them. So he pressed his lips together, trying to stifle his noises to a minimum.
“I'm an angel, not a cleaning service,” Cas rumbled, in that deep, throaty voice of his. “Better get used to me not using my powers anymore.”
“Thanks, Data. Almost seven months ago. So, yeah. Do you have like a book with their photos and all the names, or do they have name tags or...?” Dean raised his eyebrows, looking at Sam.
“Are you hungry, too? It's probably been just as long since you've had any food,” Dean said, weighing his keys in his hands.
Eventually, Castiel stepped closer to their table, barely glancing at the others before he addressed Dean. “I would like to...” He seemed to grasp for the right words. “Request your services again.”
Most of the hunters seemed ecstatic about being able to properly celebrate Christmas again, but a few of them were grumpy. Dean heard one of them mutter about Christmas being a religious thing, and what had religion ever gotten them? A war, that's what. Sam must have heard it, too, because he started arguing that Christmas didn't have to be about religion, it was more a celebration of love. It was only then that Dean noticed that no one had wanted any angels as decoration, and the ones he had bought for the tree were still lying untouched in their package.
Dean glared at him. “What high praise.” His heart was still beating a mile a minute, but that didn't stop him from being a little shit.
“Yeah. My baby brother.” Dean smiled, thinking about how Sam had long since outgrown him. If anyone asked, he was annoyed about it. But mostly, he was proud of the kid.
Though Sam was still worried every time Jack walked out the door. Then again, he was worried about everyone who went out on hunts.
“But you do get horny?” Dean's grip tightened on Castiel's robe. “Shit, I'm just constantly putting my foot in my mouth today, huh? Forget I said anything.”
When Mary moved on to grab a present of her own, Dean found Cas just looking at him with a soft smile.
“That's the plan, isn't it?” Cas' hand returned from Dean's shoulder to his head, stroking through his hair again.
They huffed again, trying to free their arm from Gabriel's grip. Then they eventually relented, though they was still glaring daggers at the Prince. “Fine,” they eventually spat. “I'll stay. But only for a few minutes, I really need to see to the preparations for the spring festi-”
“Is she that expensive?” Dean didn't think that Cas would miss a few gold coins, given that he was willingly paying for Sam.
Castiel shrugged. “I liked it. With how weak Heaven was, I could... almost taste it. And it made me feel connected to Jack, eating the same food.”
Prince Castiel was staring at his brother. “That was... was that...” He tilted his head to the side, then shuddered. “You know what, I don't even want to know.” He took the glass of wine and downed most of it.
“Please. One Winchester is worth more than a hundred Crowleys. The reason I didn't come to you is... Well, I wanted to. But then I saw you living a normal life, with...”
Cas actually did ask Claire if she had read the fanfiction when they had a moment alone, and according to what he told Dean later, she had just rolled her eyes and made sounds of disgust as she'd told him that a friend had told her about the story, and that she had closed her eyes while printing and boxing it. Apparently, she had really just meant it as a tease, and maybe even as a nudge to get them in the right direction. Mostly as a way to embarrass them, though.
“Shit,” he cursed, getting up so fast that it jostled Dean, and reaching for the time piece on the night stand. Two past nine. “Heavens damn it.”
of presents with his name on them, neatly stacked together, and he could feel a rush of emotions threatening to bubble a little too close to the surface.
“Lea' me alone,” Dean mumbled, still not fully awake, to the point where he didn't even bother to move his head off Cas' shoulder, just turned it a little to look up at Sam.
“What do you mean?” He liked Dean. He was honest and his whole face lit up sometimes when he laughed. He was also very pretty.
“What are you looking at?” Dean asked with pretend gruffness. “Shouldn't you get to your own presents?”
“Heyyy, Happy New Year!” Donna had come to them, and she tackled them both into a hug. Dean wasn't sure if the way her cheeks were glowing was from the cold or the alcohol, but he supposed it didn't matter. That thought reminded him of the champagne glass in his hand, though.
“Yeah, no, that's fine,” Dean said, in a daze. It wasn't like he would tell anyone, or like he had anyone to tell, except Bobby or Sam in his letters. But still. Damn.
“Officially,” Dean repeated, heart beating fast. He didn't even know why it mattered to him who reigned the kingdom, but change was rarely something good in his experience. “And unofficially?”
“The one from the apocalypse world. Ours died years ago.” Castiel remembered Ezekiel well, the elegant way he had fought, his bravery and unwavering loyalty to Heaven. Once upon a time, he had tried to be like him, a true believer and renowned soldier. Of course, he had only partly succeeded, the doubt still seeded deeply in him despite his superiors' best efforts.
They did talk about anything and everything. Dean told him all about the employees in the Harem, who was fancying whom, all the gossip he had heard. He didn't think that Castiel was particularly interested, but he smiled at Dean as he talked, his eyes fixed on his face, sometimes darting down to his lips.
“No. I wasn't drunk yesterday and I'm not today. Oh, Dean. If you don't want me, I understand, but please don't think this is some kind of fleeting fancy, or drunken rambling, because it's not. I have thought long and hard about this-” He frowned at the grin on Dean's face. “No, that's not meant as a euphemism for my penis, stop having such thoughts.”
“Told you I wanted a piece of your ass,” he told him with a grin, then bent over the side of the bed to search through his bag, eventually coming back up with a bottle of lube in his hand.
Of course, they had had sex that one time, but Castiel didn't think much about it. He didn't desire her and she seemed happy to play around with whoever most took her fancy on any given day, so he wasn't worried that this might complicate their relationship.
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean was still smiling, and tried to hide it by kissing Cas' face, working his way down to his throat. “If I'm so worthy, then can I have my reward now?”
“Do you ever have sex?” Dean asked, then seemed to think better of it. “Uh, you don't have to answer that. I'm sorry. My Prince.”
“Castiel,” Dean moaned, reaching for him. Castiel intertwined their hands, smiling down at him as he started to take him apart slowly.
“Of course. I didn't mean to keep you.” Dean bowed slightly, not getting very far with one knee hugged to his chest.
Dean let out a long sigh, then stretched and slowly sat up. “Ask me wha'?” he asked, blinking lazily. He was so beautiful that it made Castiel's heart ache.
Castiel wondered if said visitor had an appointment, or if she knew they would come by through magical means.
“Aye, my boy. That is how the Great Goddess intended it.” Rowena sauntered off down the hallway, and Charlie followed her with a shrug.
“Touché. But no. He's like that with pretty much everyone, save very few people. But you.” Gabriel waggled a finger in his face. “You make him laugh. And smile. And he lets you touch him and kiss him. In front of other people, to boot! You have no idea what that means for him, do you? He's managed to cultivate this tough guy reputation-”
“I'm not asking you to marry me right now, Dean,” Castiel assured him, and Dean instantly looked a bit calmer. “But I wish to share more of my life with you than just these few nights and whatever stories we can tell each other. I want you to be an integral part of my days.”
He felt a little guilty. Maybe Dean actually wanted to go with Gabriel. Though he was smiling at Castiel again.
Prince Castiel let out a muffled groan against the pillow when Dean pressed into a particularly hard place near his shoulder blade.
“Go ahead.” Castiel was curious what Dean wanted that would make him shift in his seat like that. Was this about money? But Dean must have figured out by now that Castiel would buy him anything he wanted.
“Sure, sure.” Meg put a finger over his lips to silence him. “Forgiven and forgotten. Under one condition.”
Dean stared at the door for a couple seconds after it fell closed. Apparently he was a 'your highness' now. Cas had forgotten to mention that little detail.
Dean blinked at the person standing in front of him, hand on their hip. They had a child in their arms, which wasn't even looking at Dean, too distracted by the leaves on a tree rustling in a fresh breeze.
“Of course.” Castiel frowned. “This is your home now, Dean. You can invite anyone you wish. And I would love to meet Sam sometime.”
Dean moaned when Cas twisted his wrist, and he clamped a hand over his mouth to stifle it, bucked his hips to take Cas deeper, wanting, needing,
Cas hummed and stepped even closer to Dean, so their bodies where mere inches apart. His thumb was trailing over Dean's cheek. “Why were you so eager for me to look at your behind?”
Huh. However the fuck that worked, he thought, shaking his head at all the strange magic that was apparently totally normal around his place. And why where there so many lights for just one single room? It filled him with a buzz and his skin prickled, as if the air around him was charged with energy. Not that it hurt or anything, but he had taken a while to get used to all the magic lights at the Harem, and he was sure it would take some adjusting here, too. He pulled the second string.
“Oh? Oh my. What's this, Cassie. Could it be that you like him? Could it possibly be that you have taken t-”
After a few beats of silence, Castiel said softly: “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to turn this into an interrogation.”
Dean took a sip of his coke. “Yeah, it was kinda silly. We should get you a better one, a Stetson or something. And some cowboy boots.”
Castiel touched his cheek gently. “Dean. I'm not sure how much Sam's tuition and living expenses are, but if you can pay them with your wages here, I'm sure I'll be able to afford it tenfold. That sounds like a brag. It's not supposed to be a brag, but, you know, I am a prince.” He shrugged.
“This it?” Dean asked, and Castiel realized they had just been standing in front of the door for several seconds.
When Castiel arrived at the Harem the next evening, the front room was once again mostly empty. As at the spring festival, most employees had set up in the yard, except this time without much need for fires. A few were lit, as the nights could still get cool, though this evening they seemed to be used mostly for lighting purposes.
Dean turned away, probably to hide his red-rimmed eyes, and Castiel squeezed his hand, letting his grace speed up the recovery of the slight swelling.
When Castiel awoke the next morning to the blaring sound of his time piece, it took him a moment to realize that he was not in his own room, and that the warmth on his back was Dean. He reached for the time piece and turned it off, but jostled Dean in the process, who just grunted and grabbed him tighter.
“You need to go. That's cool. Uh, just one last thing.” Dean looked up from the heap of bottles he had pulled out of a cabinet. “Am I supposed to, like, stay in these rooms? Or can I go outside?”
“Sarcastic, huh?” Dean asked before he bit into the mushroom-free slice that was dripping with sauce as well as fat from the salami. That might be interesting. He happened to know another guy who was pretty old, sarcastic and good at healing people. But about twenty minutes into the episode, with his pizza mostly gone, Dean found himself disappointed. “He's sarcastic, alright. Or more, like, cynic. He hates people.”
“You will address me as your princess, as is proper,” she said icily, and he bowed again, doing so. “Now what are you doing here, I've never seen y-” She stared at his arm, or more precisely, his bracelet. “Who are you?”
The Prince squirmed a little, turning towards the wall hanging again. “It would be rather rude to deny you what you want.”
to tell the world that he, Dean Winchester, was in love with, and being loved by, Castiel, badass angel of the Lord.
Cas smiled and Dean realized that he wasn't even looking at the fireworks, his eyes trained on Dean. “Very beautiful.”
It wasn't quite like that, at least not literally, though Jack beamed at him and came over as soon as Dean entered the room. Cas had gone a bit earlier, and Dean had felt bad as soon as he had left the room. This was how they usually did it, leaving the room at different times so people would maybe, hopefully not connect the dots. But it kinda sucked, and Cas deserved better than to be Dean's dirty secret, not to mention that Dean
Dean was silent for a bit, thinking about the implications. If Cas was human, then he would need to eat and sleep and shower and all that stuff. But even more than that, he might want to live more like a human, more like regular humans did, that was.
“Cas says you've been teaching these guys from apocalypse world how to hunt,” Dean explained as he continued to rummage in the fridge, eventually pulling out some eggs, butter, toast and jelly. “Guess I should've figured you wouldn't teach them how to stay properly fed. What is all this stuff, anyway?” He gestured inside the fridge before closing its door with his foot.
“Bet they'd also listen to their Mrs. Chief,” Dean teased her, but she just grinned, waggling her eyebrows at him. Meanwhile, Sam got flustered, but ultimately he agreed to go and keep the hunters in check. (And probably also to keep Rowena where she was. They didn't need a continuation of what had happened with Gabriel and Rowena in the same room last time.)
“Seriously? You think I don't know what's under the mat in your trunk?” Dean raised an eyebrow, growing more and more annoyed at Cas' reluctance to take down the wolf. “It's just a werewolf, Cas, it's basically a trip to the park.”
“I- yeah. But...” Dean hadn't meant that they should retire right away, that they should leave the life behind this very moment. But apparently, that was what Cas had understood, and really? There wasn't actually any reason not to retire now. Why wait? But still. “We can do one more hunt, one last hunt. Right? Besides, we said we'd help people when they needed it. And right now, there are people who need our help.”
“Maybe I'm being unfair to our father, but I think my mother did most of the work in the palace.” Castiel frowned. “No, that sounds wrong. Of course the staff did most of the work, but my mother oversaw it all. And after she died... our father expected us to take over from her.”
Dean's eyes became wide. The he suddenly started laughing. “Sorry, sorry... Yeah, there's definitely a sexual connotation to that. Oh man.” He held his side, the laughter subsiding. “Uh. Sorry.”
“Well, I hope it doesn't turn my skin into gold. I still need that. Can I maybe get something, uh... less all the rage?”
“Nothing more traditional than this. Uh, my Prince.” Dean blushed again. “But... it's not that. We could live in the city from what I would make outside. But I don't want us to just survive.”
“We know you killed your own counterpart in our world. This has caused some displeasure within our ranks, but I for one am grateful for it. No offence, Castiel, but your other version was a fanatic. He would no doubt have tried to stop us from leaving.”
Dean felt his expression soften and he pulled Cas to his feet by his hands. “You old sap. Okay, we'll get up early and empty the plate so Jack will think Santa was there. But I bet Jack is still awake and waiting, anyway, so if we go now, he'll see that it was us.”
“Sue me,” Dean grumbled automatically, stuffing his mouth with bacon. “If it's bacon that kills me, I win.”
“Me? I've never taunted anyone in my life. Can you believe this man.” Prince Gabriel turned to Sara. “What a cruel heart a man must have to accuse his own brother like that.”
In the end, Dean managed to convince Cas to come with him. A quick look into the library confirmed that Jack was indeed still up, so they retired to Dean's room and locked the door behind them. Which was when Dean got nervous.
This chapter includes a (kind of) coming-out and reactions to that, both from other people and the one coming out. I drew from my own experiences with coming out for that and while one may argue that Dean's reaction would be completely different from mine, I project too much onto him to change this lmao.
“Shut up. I know.” Dean threw another look at the walls that he could hardly see, covered as they were. “What is all this for?”
“They don't think they have to hide from hunters anymore, yeah. The guys we swatted? Pretty sure they were trying to lure us in.”
. God. Dean didn't deserve him, didn't deserve any of this, and he felt his tear ducts acting up again when Cas pressed gentle kisses to his throat.
“Yes. I realize he looks young, and I sincerely hope it's genetic and not some sort of magic.” Castiel shrugged. “Don't tell him I said that.”
Castiel's heart ached in sympathy. Of course. Dean had been ripped from the only people he had known in the palace, and after leaving the city and his old life behind only a few months ago. Especially after his encounter with Hester, it was no wonder that he was yearning for some friendly faces.
Dean stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. Instead of pushing him away, though, he turned his head, capturing his lips with his own, and for several beautiful seconds Castiel lost himself in the kiss.
It barely took a minute before the Prince's chest was rising and falling in a barely perceptible, but steady beat. Dean waited a few minutes, giving the oil time to work its way into his skin, then he pulled a blanket over the sleeping Prince.
Meg was one of the rare acquaintances he could speak plainly to, despite her not being a part of his family. But she was a commoner, though her family had come into money, and they had found that they both enjoyed talking straight with each other. Meg could be a little crude and she asked indecent and suggestive questions, and yet he was closer to her than to most of his siblings, or so it felt to him. He wasn't sure how much he mattered to her, but he would have liked her to consider him a friend.
There had been a time, all those years ago, when Dean had wanted to stay up and wait for Santa to come. That must have been the Christmas before his fourth birthday or something. The last Christmas they had had as a family.
“Wow, rude. Not only can I hear you perfectly, but your lovely lady friend cannot. You should really think your communication strategies through a little more.”
Prince Gabriel looked between the two in surprise. “Oh, well. I can't really give you a recommendation on what to do with him. Though I hear he gives excellent massages.”
“I would tell you that I was born ready,” Cas commented as Dean pulled out his fingers and slicked up his cock, “but technically, I was never born.”
The person – Cassie? - sighed. “We didn't agree on anything, Gabriel. You told me that you knew a way to relax and I was foolish enough to follow you, but now that I know what you had in mind-”
“Well, I can detect no meddling, magical or otherwise.” She took another sip from her cup. “Unless you count the unusually high amount of caffeine in his system for such an early Sunday morning, but that is hardly my metier.”
Dean felt a surge of regret, which annoyed him. He shouldn't feel that way just because some stupid Prince had spent the night in his bed without touching him, and had bolted in the early hours of the morning. Or maybe the late hours of the night. Who knew.
He was almost sure – almost – that he was of the Royal Family, what with the crest on the pin on his chest. Cas had once explained to him that all the princes and princesses wore it, but this guy seemed a bit too old to be the king's child. He looked more like a bureaucrat, though with the temper of a drunken sailor.
She cocked an eyebrow, seeming entirely calm. “Am I happy that you kissed the possessed body of my dead father?” she asked coolly.
A person who Dean recognized as a butler by his uniform came in. “You called, your highness.” He bowed.
Cas smiled softly and looked down at the bed where Dean's and his own hand were almost touching. “Sam actually took the first shift. But eventually, I was able to convince him that it was more practical to give the task to someone who doesn't need to sleep.”
Dean didn't think Castiel was like that. It had taken him long enough to fuck Dean, and he didn't seem to care much about sex. But perhaps he had found someone else to talk to, someone more fitting than a sex worker. Someone nicer. Someone suitable for a prince...
“Are you shocked?” He had only ever told Meg, and she had looked at him as if he had grown another arm. He figured anyone would be disgusted by a weirdo like him.
“Cool. You want me to ring when you can get it back?” Dean gestured vaguely towards the bell, still entranced by the food.
“Vampires, too,” Dean heard himself say. “And other monsters. He made them strong and immune to all sorts of stuff, his own personal army of- Fuck, Cas, I remember now. The experiments, the... He didn't let me see everything, but every now and then he would... I...”
But Mary had either not heard Sam, or ignored him, because she went over to the tree without further comment.
He couldn't see it, but he was pretty sure Cas was rolling his eyes. “He wears cowboy boots to work, Dean.”
“I'm glad you think so. Though I'm afraid I'll have to be horrible and leave you to it – my next meeting is half-way across the city.” He got up, collecting his notes.
Cas leaned up to kiss him then, taking his hand away to press it into the mattress. There was a brief moment of panic in Dean's chest, but when Cas' lips met his, it melted, turned into something different, something hot and heady, going straight to his dick.
A few hours later, when everyone had had the chance to contribute to the list, Cas and Dean took off. Since it was his car, Cas insisted on driving, and for once Dean found he didn't mind. To his surprise, Cas had a tape deck and an adapter in the car, and when Dean asked what tapes he even had to listen to, he said, as if it were the most normal thing in the world: “The one you gave me, of course.”
Now it was almost midnight, the big finale of the festival inching closer, and Castiel had finally managed to extricate himself from the crowd and the awkward conversations about petunias and the latest robe fashion. He checked on a few people before leaving, seeing the Crown Prince engaged in discussion with a minor noble and her son and Hester tending to her children, in a corner as far away from her husband as possible. Then he stuck his head into the kitchens, getting confirmation that yes, my Prince, everything is according to schedule, no we are not out of flour, yes there are still raisins, before he finally made his way to the Harem.
That made Dean blush so hard it probably went all the way down to his toes, and he needed a moment to pull himself together before he could answer. “Oh, uh. Okay. Sure. Yeah. We can do that.”
They didn't have sex that night, but they drank a lot of wine and made out, Cas pressing kisses like apologies into Dean's skin, mumbling about how sorry he was and about how Dean deserved so much better.
“I suppose you know why we're here,” Hester said, seating herself with a back so straight that it was too stiff to look graceful.
But not as much as Cas jumped. His eyes flew open and his hands almost dropped Dean's, but then he gripped it tighter instead. “Dean,” he said, breathlessly, and a swirl of emotions passed over his face: Surprise, wonder, pain, relief, happiness.
“Dean, there's no need to be nervous.” Silence. “Except if you've made some kind of deal with a malicious entity or otherwise endangered yourself or another member of our family. That would make me furious and you would have every right to be nervous.”
Dean hadn't seen Prince Castiel for two weeks, might have almost forgotten him if the others didn't constantly pester him with questions. Somehow, they couldn't believe that they hadn't fucked, thinking that Castiel must have either bribed or threatened him not to talk about it.
Thomas' eyes lit up and he thanked him about a dozen times. Judging from the way he glanced over at one of the other hunters sheepishly, Dean was pretty sure their intuition had been right.
Carefully, Castiel extricated himself from the blanket that he didn't remember getting and sat up. His eyes were slowly adjusting to the dark, vague shapes forming in front of him. Despite the early hour, there was stray light peaking through the drawn curtains, undoubtedly the magic lights lining the walkway outside. After a while, Castiel could make out enough to see Dean, wrapped in his own blanket, half-sitting and half-lying on the couch closest to the fire place.
“Right. So. I'm kinda hungry, is there a chance there's some food around I could snag?” Dean scratched the back of his neck.
This time, Cas was there again, holding him tightly as Dean snapped awake from his latest nightmare, shaking. He clung to Cas, buried his face in his neck, let him rub his back.
The High Enchantress' expression didn't change, but her eyes were sparkling and she leaned forward a little. “Oh my. Tell me all about it.”
Dean made a face when he remembered the books. God, he hoped Claire hadn't read them. Especially the sex scenes. Jesus, please let her not have read the sex scenes. (And not just because the writing had been awful.)
“Two slices aren't that much.” Castiel still wasn't sure what he should think of Dean going straight to the kitchens instead of simply asking a servant for pie, but he had smiled so beautifully when tasting it that Castiel hadn't inquired further.
Cas kept standing by the table. “We- I wasn't sure how much you remembered. You never talked about it.”
Slowly, Castiel made his way to the door, slipping out into the dimly illuminated corridor. The lights were always on, but one of the hunters from apocalypse world had recently found out how to put them on a lower setting during the night, when most of the denizens of the bunker were asleep. In fact, it seemed like the hunters kept finding new things around the bunker weekly. Where Castiel had expected them to be glad they were alive, and to try to live as normal as possible, most of them seemed to have difficulties fitting into this world, which meant they had mostly stayed here. And they were restless, as if escaping from the constant struggle of their world wasn't just a relief but also a loss of purpose.
A small smile appeared on Castiel's face at how grumpy Dean sounded, as if the thought of Castiel clothed was disappointing. Slipping out of everything but his underwear, Castiel said: “Jack is asleep in the War Room. I'm afraid his neck will be stiff tomorrow, though maybe he won't be affected, considering who he is.”
Dean thought it over for a moment, then figured that if Castiel wanted to mock him, he wouldn't need his life story for that. “I was born in the Marigold district.” Not one of the noble parts of town, but still respectable. “But after m- we moved to the Oxwell district when I was five.” Even the Prince must know that that was a step down. “It was my father's decision – not that he had much of a choice, I guess – but he wasn't happy about it. He expected us to do better. But he also...” Dean pressed his lips into a thin line. “He used up most of our money. Tried to take Sammy out of school.” He gritted his teeth, trying not to think of how he had dropped out of school himself, so he could earn some additional coin. “He thought he was better than everyone around him, and he wanted us to be better, too. But he didn't do anything to help us. Didn't so much as lift a damn finger in the house.”
“Cool.” Dean turned the knob and sighed in relief when the cool water started streaming over his hand. He glanced at the person still standing in front of the doors, looking stricken. “Dude, it's fine. Just don't drop any of the pies, okay?” He was both glad and mildly frustrated when they left through the doors, taking the pies with them.
“But it's a Christian holiday,” Dean argued, leaning back on his hands. Jack was listening to them intently.
If Hester was surprised, she didn't show it. They all knew what the High Enchantress was like, but sometimes it still unnerved Castiel.
After a slight hesitation and a deep breath, Dean cut into his throat, a shallow wound but nevertheless enough to draw out his grace. For a horrible moment, Castiel was reminded of Metatron, of the forceful way he had removed his grace, and he concentrated on the few stars that were visible in the night sky, reminding himself that this was Dean, his friend, his love, Dean who would never hurt him. (Unless he was a demon, but Castiel elected not to count that time.)
“So. Dean-o. You're uncharacteristically quiet today.” Even though they hadn't slept with each other, that didn't mean they hadn't interacted. Usually in the form of Gabriel annoying Dean until he broke the polite facade he so carefully put up in front of his employers and their guests.
Cas nodded slowly. “That's true,” he said thoughtfully, glancing at Dean. “This might actually be beneficial for both sides.”
The room was still mostly silent, though the whispers grew a little bolder, the giggles a little louder. Castiel was staring at Dean and Dean stared back, feeling his own nerves acting up.
What if this was just an elaborate prank? But no, Cas wasn't like that, Dean was sure. What if he changed his mind, though, what if he didn't come and Dean would sit here at noon, waiting and looking stupid?
“In fact,” Castiel continued, already grabbing his robe, “you have to get up too, so I can ask you again.”
“Hey.” Dean decided to face the music, get it out of the way. He tried to sound jovial, but probably failed miserably. “So I met your sister this morning.”
Dean wasn't so sure about that. In fact, he believed he hardly deserved Cas at all, let alone to be treated kindly by his family. But Cas looked at him like he had hung the moon and the stars, and Dean decided to indulge himself, just for once, in the feeling of being wanted for more than his body.
“Dean,” Cas called him, and he realized he had just sat there without doing anything for several seconds. So he got back to work, wriggling his finger further into Cas. “You're distracted.”
“Sister!” Castiel stepped up next to her chair. “If you so much as think such a word in his presence, you will regret it.”
Sam scoffed, but promised to see what he could find in the kitchen. Then he left, and Cas seemed like he wanted to follow him right out of the door.
Cas drew something else out of the box, a couple sheets of paper neatly folded to fit under the figurines. A letter? Dean didn't know why Claire would need to write one, especially such a long one, considering she could always call or text him.
Jack was still in the War Room, but he was slumped over on the table, the cookies and milk untouched before him. When Castiel came closer, he realized Jack was asleep, and he felt a rush of affection run through him. The boy had never had the possibility to really be a child, but he had kept the enthusiasm and joy of a toddler, despite everything he had seen, at least if Sam's and Mary's descriptions of little children were anything to go by.
Dean blinked at him. “Because... well, I wouldn't dare try to liken the great warriors of the Heavens. My Prince.”
In turn, Castiel told him more about his childhood, about his favourite places to hide, which seemed to be mainly libraries, though he also mentioned a few other spots. About the way the front yard and the gardens had changed over the years, sometimes because of a new head gardener, sometimes because of the 'fickleness of humans' as he called it. He seemed to mean that his siblings sometimes changed their tastes.
After a moment, the baker answered: “Benny Lafitte. Also 'he'. It's nice to meet you, your highness.”
He felt Cas' chuckle more than he heard it. “Yeah. It's rather high on the list, considering that if Heaven does shut down, all the billions upon billions of souls will fall to Earth, and who knows what havoc they might wreak. But... I am tired of trying to fix everything. It might be partly my fault that the number of angels is so diminished, but as I said, there's not much I can do and it's not like my help would be wanted, anyway.”
He also kept clear of the throne room, remembering Cas saying that it was usually busy during week days. Dean had no desire to run into the crown prince – soon to be king, he reminded himself. Not that it would make much of a difference according to Cas, since Prince Michael had long since been running the kingdom anyway.
“Oh? Oho? Is it official then?” Gabriel waggled his eyebrows at them, grinning. “Now I understand why you're ready to take the fall.”
They made out like that for a while, then got out of their clothes slowly, taking their time. Cas kept kissing Dean's body softly, like it was something to be cherished, like having Dean this way was precious, not just a quick way to get off. Sometimes – often – Dean couldn't handle that, couldn't wrap his head around being treasured this way. Being loved.
Cas seemed to like that, if the way he took them both into his hand and stroked them roughly was any indication. They had never really been alone before when doing it, Sam and Jack usually just a door or a wall away, so they had always been hushed. But this time, it didn't matter if anyone heard them. Dean couldn't have cared less if some random guy next door knew what they were doing. Hell, the receptionist already freaking knew, or at least suspected. So whatever. He would be as loud as he wanted.
“So, this could be a good thing. You clearly make him happy.” Gabriel gave him a serious look that made Dean squirm. “I'd like it to stay that way.”
Cas chuckled as he reached for him, putting a hand on Dean's cheek. “No. It was a rather weak prayer and might not even have reached Heaven. But even if it did, it was directed at me specifically, so no other angel would hear it.”
“Indeed. If it has come even to my ears, I am sure the whole palace knows.” Michael waited a beat, then added: “I never took you for a man who debauches in such pleasures.”
Prince Castiel pressed his lips in a thin line. “Do you... do you actually give massages, or was that one of my brothers euphemisms?”
Shit. A few of the other employees giggled, but Dean snapped his jaw shut. Prince Castiel turned to him, for the first time sparing him more than a glance. Dean's eyes were fixed on the table top.
While they kissed, Cas started stroking them even harder, and Dean felt the urge the move his hips in rhythm, but managed to stop himself. “Cas, fuck, stop,” he pressed out, and Cas' hand stilled, then fell away from their cocks.
“Another one? Really?” They had already watched a few since Dean's return, because Cas had insisted that it was the seasonally appropriate thing to do.
“What about what you want?” Dean placed his hand over Cas' on his stomach. “You'll get tired of me if you see me every night.”
“Or we could make the best of you still having them. No? No. Okay.” Dean got up with a sigh to fetch a towel.
“This will do,” Michael said eventually, the highest praise that Castiel had ever heard of him. “Make sure to circulate it accordingly.”
Dean sighed, grumbling under his breath, no actual words but definitely a statement. Then he shifted, draping his whole body over Cas, who huffed beneath him. “Go ahead and try,” Dean mumbled.
But now, after everything, things seemed to be good between the two, though Castiel wondered how Dean would react if he found out about Bobby and Mary. Even Castiel had noticed eventually that there was something between them, something romantic or sexual of nature, possibly both, and he was worried that Dean might reject it, might close himself off to his mother again.
“Oh? My mistake.” There was a trace of laughter in Cas' voice as he carded a hand through Dean's hair. Shit, that felt nice. “I suppose then I must get up alone to celebrate Christmas with everyone else.”
Instead of answering right away, Dean took a few seconds to check his own body. No pain, as far as he could tell. “Michael?” he heard himself ask.
“You're more tense than I thought.” Dean bit his bottom lip. He really needed to be more careful with what he said to a literal Prince. This wasn't Gabriel, who seemed to take life as a cosmic joke. Dean wasn't sure what to make of Prince Castiel yet, but he was definitely more serious than his brother.
“He's fine. There was a moment... After he stabbed you, well, Michael, and it looked like you were... For a second, we weren't sure if you would make it.” Cas turned to him with those puppy eyes that Dean both loved and hated, just because they always made him feel mushy inside. “He was devastated. He has never killed someone deliberately before, and if you had died along with Michael, I'm not sure...”
“I know. And I'm not suggesting we dispose of it.” Castiel had hinted to such, especially with regard to Dean's older clothes from his time in the city, but the puzzled and slightly horrified look on Dean's face had made him drop the notion quickly. “But the new robes will help you fit in with the other denizens of the palace. Besides, if you're to accompany me to an official function, you can hardly show up wearing that.” The thought made Castiel shiver. The scandal that would cause was possibly worse than Dean's origins already warranted. In any case, it would make the gossip far worse than it had to be.
“I...” Dean's own voice was shaking, and he buried his face in Cas' neck, trying to will those images away, trying to believe Cas that it wasn't his fault, that it was all Michael, but he had been Michael, or Michael had been in him, and it had been his hands that had...
“Uh.” Dean bowed. “Your highness?” It was a question, because he had no idea who she was or what her status was. Her clothes seemed fancy, though.
“So what do you think?” Dean asked, making Cas tilt his head in that cute way of his. “Your first taste of alcohol as a human, right?”
“Uuuuh, something edible? I'd really like something warm, but it's cool if the kitchen's closed or whatever. Is the kitchen ever closed? Anyway, a snack would be amazing, too, if you know what I mean,” he blabbered, feeling more inadequate by the second.
“What?” Cas sounded confused. “Oh, but I- I know you don't see me that way. I'm just another client.”
“Yeah, well, that's quite some truth bomb you dropped there.” Dean didn't know what kind of answer he was waiting for, but it didn't come. “So, uh... I guess there was no other way? Except to kill y- that other version of you.”
“He did this. Michael. Not you. He was using you at the time, but he would have done this regardless of his vessel. It has nothing to do with you,” Cas told him with a hard voice, obviously trying to keep down his own anger.
Dean snorted out a laugh, wiping away a last tear. “Okay, Rambo. How about you don't beat up my little brother?”
Dean grabbed the bag from him, silencing him with a glare. Then he made sure to push the bottle of lube to the very bottom of the bag, under what he now saw were carefully wrapped Christmas presents. “We'll get this to the car first,” he muttered.
They ended up ordering pizza for dinner and by the time it arrived, the soap had ended and they changed the channel until they came across what looked like a medical drama. Dean thought he had seen at least one of the characters before, but he couldn't quite place him until Cas said that it was called 'House M.D.'. Apparently, he had watched some episodes of it before and had liked it well enough, despite the 'exuberantly dramatic' plot structure that 'always leads to the main cast saving a life at the very last second, and when the patient had already gone through so many cardiac arrests and strokes that they should have permanent brain (and other organs) damage, yet somehow they always turn out completely fine'.
“Are you sure you're alright?” Cas frowned as he stepped into the room, letting the door fall shut behind him.
Not a single muscle betrayed any emotion on the butler's face as they bowed again. “I'll see what I can do, your highness. Are there any specifications to your diet I should convey to the kitchens?”
She pulled her arm away with a force that belied her slim frame, then stalked out of the room without so much as looking at him. Castiel sighed.
After staring at the bell for a few moments, he rung it, then waited. And waited. After about a minute, there was a knock on the door.
“Yeah, kinda like that.” Dean smiled. “I mean, Sam's already training these apocalypse world guys for the job, so once they've learned from him, what do they need us for, except some angel or demon or djinn trivia now and then.”
Noticing Dean's fixation on the screen, Cas turned in his seat to figure out what was keeping his interest, but the news lady had already moved on to another topic, the singer or whatever they were.
“It's alright, Dean.” Once again, Castiel wasn't even sure what he was referring to – something that had happened, or the fact that he was crying? Dean always cared a great deal about seeming strong to other people, and though Castiel thought that they had come a long way with each other in that regard, he could imagine that Dean still felt ashamed about his tears. “Shhh. Tell me what's wrong.”
“Yeah?” Dean leaned over him again while Cas wrapped his legs around his waist. Their kiss was wet, tongues crashing, and Dean almost regretted having to pull back a little to be able to thrust into Cas. “How about you blaspheme without his name. Dirty talk, remember?”
Dean squeezed his hand. “Cas, I know you don't really mean what you say and that you're gonna regret it in the morning and uh, slightly off topic, but we really need to get this stuff off us before it dries.”
“Bummer.” Dean wondered why he even cared, considering he wasn't even big on gossip. Maybe the other employees had influenced him more than he had thought. Then again, a Royal Secret like that just seemed a lot more worthy of his attention than who bedded whom. “Let's talk about something different, then.”
“I know. But there's still work to do.” Dean grumbled, but complied, drifting off to sleep easily in his new bed, with his prince wrapped around him.
“He does have his charm. In a very weird, and often very gross kind of way,” Castiel agreed, staring off into space. Then he shook his head and smiled at Dean. “I'm glad you're not mad.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “If that's all it takes to make you think that, your standards are really low.”
Before Dean could reply anything, another person came through the rift. And then another, and another. It didn't seem to want to stop.
Castiel tilted his head. “Is there... a sexual connotation to 'holding someone' that I'm unaware of?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “You want me to pay for your ass? What, like rent? Alimony? Help me out here, pal.”
Sam nodded thoughtfully. “You're probably right. Still, I'm gonna tell the others to be careful. We've been getting used to these things being reckless, but we should be prepared to deal with them even if they're not leaving obvious traces. You know, don't expect a weaker opponent just because they're being stealthy.”
Castiel had frozen. “Lunch. I forget to get you lunch. I'm so sorry, Dean, I forgot to inform the kitchens, or I guess I thought you'd already had lunch, I don't know, really, it seems I didn't think about it at a-”
Dean didn't know what to say to that, so he just sat down on the bed that was the centre of the room.
Dean was a bit disappointed. “I see. Should I... I can call someone else who would please you more.”
Dean thought that Gabriel was exaggerating. After all, Cas was often wide-eyed, an open, honest look was pretty much his trademark. Then Dean thought back to the first time they had met each other, and started wondering.
“I've no doubt.” Castiel's eyes roamed his body for a moment before he turned away, seeming embarrassed.
When Cas came by around noon, Dean was stretched out on his bed, a book open beside him. He was just flipping through it, unable to concentrate enough to take in the words, and he got up when Cas entered.
“Only when people deserve it. Which is most of the time. Anyway.” Castiel took a deep breath. “Will you be my companion, Dean? Please, please say yes.”
Dean was sure he was going to die of embarrassment if he so much as glanced at those pages again, but he couldn't deny Cas when he looked at him with such an innocent, hopeful expression.
“Apologies, we're not here to discuss my sister's marriage. Perhaps she did, at one point, love her spouse.” He frowned. “Anyway, as I grew up, I realized that whatever I did, however much I worked and succeeded, it was never going to be enough. Certainly not for our father. But also not for my siblings. I think they were all so used to giving their all that... Well. Maybe I also just didn't register with them very much. They were all older than me and they all seemed to think that I was someone else's problem.”
“I was thinking of a warning system. Some sort of heads up if she gets close. Alas, I fear the High Enchantress would expect quite the fee for that sort of thing, if it is even possible.”
The Prince only sipped on his wine, though, still standing between the bed and the couch. Dean wasn't sure what the protocol was, if he should offer a seat or if that would be an affront. After all, who was he to offer anything when the Prince and his family owned this whole place? Then again, they also owned the wine he had offered.
“We live to serve,” Dean said sarcastically. “So what, you're just gonna waltz out of here and into – where exactly?”
This time, the tailor snorted, though they threw a guilty glance at Castiel afterwards. Castiel smiled to let them know that no offence was taken, and he shook his head at Dean's antics.
“Get to know him!” she screamed. “Why would I want to get to know this- this commoner! Castiel, I know you have too soft a heart despite your pretences, but this is going too far. What are the people going to think?”
“Fuck,” he cursed, struggling to get up, “what the hell? Why doesn't the silver work on you, bastard?”
“I believe it's starting.” Cas pointed to the sky, and Dean saw a first rocket go up, then burst into a vibrant red. More rockets followed, and some glowing things that painted shapes into the dark, probably controlled by magic.
For a moment, Castiel just stood there, watching Jack and wondering if he should pocket the cookies and leave. That would have been the most prudent choice, allowing for less chances of Jack waking up and discovering him. But Jack was only wearing a t-shirt and the bunker was always a little on the cool side, so Castiel eventually slipped out of his trench coat and carefully placed it over Jack's shoulders. That would reveal that Castiel had been there, but he could always argue that the milk and cookies had still been there when he had stepped into the room. That wasn't even a lie, and even if it was an omission, Castiel considered it a white lie, one of those harmless not-quite-truths that humans told to spare each others' feelings.
“Cas, you must have figured out by now that I'd rather have you. I only tell you every time you're here.” Dean petted his hair. “Besides, I doubt she wants me anymore.”
“I've been wondering... can I visit the Harem?” When Dean saw Castiel's surprised face, he quickly added: “Not to like, use their services or anything. But I kinda... they're my friends, you know. At least some of them.”
“No,” Dean told Sam when he opened his mouth. “Fuck you.” Then he strode out of the room, his grip on the box tight.
“What, no minutes?” Dean joked, and felt warmth rise in him when a humorous glint appeared in Cas' eyes.
“Dude, we're gonna pick up a shit ton of stuff. And probably a tree, too,” Dean told him, glancing at the people who were talking vividly about their plans for Christmas. Their first Christmas without Michael. “And I am not getting needles all over Baby. Or scratches on her roof.”
After slight hesitation, Castiel held out his glass. “Thank you,” he muttered as the red liquid flowed, and he got a smile in return. It looked genuine.
Some twenty minutes later, during which they only talked occasionally, otherwise just humming and singing along to the music, Cas added: “I could drive us back tonight and you could sleep in the car, you know.”
It wasn't the first kiss they had shared since his return, but all the others had been short and sweet, more pecks than making out, and Dean was once again floored by how good it felt, how perfect the angle was with their almost non-existent height difference, how amazing Cas' stubble felt against his own, how well his big, strong hand fit on Dean's cheek.
“Then we have half the age difference that you two have. Does that mean I get to consider you a baby, too?” Castiel asked with a straight face.
A smile tugged on Cas' lips and he ducked his head, looking like a shy school boy. Gods, Dean wanted to kiss him.
The Prince was even more handsome with his robe pulled down to his waist. Dean had seen that he was broad-shouldered, but he hadn't expected quite this much muscle. Heavens. If the Prince didn't want to have sex with him, Dean might actually be a bit disappointed.
Dean bit his lip. He hadn't told Sam that he was working in the Harem yet, and he wasn't really planning on doing so. Though if he kept working there, it was probably inevitable that Sam would find out.
After he had inspected everything twice, he opened the window, only to find himself looking out over the front yard, the fountain in the middle of it sparkling in the early afternoon sun. A fucking fountain in front of his window. And a view of the city, too, except he barely knew the district he was looking at. It must be the Sunswept district, or maybe the Bloodoar's Keep. Possibly both.
Now that wasn't exactly helpful in calming Dean down. His heart still worked extra every time Cas said that, and Dean could feel his face heat up.
They moved until they were almost head to chest, and Dean reached out only to ghost his fingers over Castiel's side.
“You are disturbing the employees and making them uncomfortable. I do believe there is a clause in all of their contracts that they do not need to endure such a thing. So I do, in fact, have the right and the responsibility to call the guards to-”
For a moment, his heart stopped in his chest, then he turned to Meg guiltily. “I am so sorry, I know we had a meeting at nine and I-”
“Sorry, I kinda held Lily up,” Dean said, and the person turned to him, revealing a face framed by a well-trimmed beard. As they moved, he also saw a patch of dough spread out on a worktop behind them.
Everyone could see that they were twins. Dean didn't know them very well, but he had seen them work, and it was almost inspiring how good they were. Of course he hadn't seen them have sex, but the way they smiled and behaved around the guests was benign, as if they really enjoyed every second of it.
Dean blinked at him sleepily, beautiful even with his hair in disarray and a blanket bunched around him. “Okay. See you?” It was still more a mumble than anything, but Castiel smiled.
“Well, I'm not sure this is part of your job. Also indecent might be the wrong word. Rather... invading?” That sounded awful, and Dean raised an eyebrow. Castiel sighed. While he had liked that Dean hadn't initiated any unwarranted physical contact last time, Castiel had found himself wondering the last two weeks. “Can I hold you?”
Dean couldn't help the snort that escaped him. “Dude, no. First off, you're not my brother. And second, two years is nothing.”
“Well, you are only just back, while I have had time to watch their interactions for months.” They made themselves comfortable on the bed while Dean fired up the laptop. “To be honest, I don't understand why it took them so long to get to this point. They appeared to like each other already when Eileen first came here.”
Eileen came up beside Sam, though, signing to him without speaking, and he signed back, but looked distracted. Meanwhile, Dean looked around the room, spotting a few curious faces and a few whispered conversations. There were also one or two hunters who looked at him with a scowl, but whether that was them hating gay people (not that he was gay, but they wouldn't know) or them hating angels and humans who made out with them, he wasn't sure.
“Yes.” Castiel produced a small vial and his angel blade. He saw Ezekiel twitch at the sight of the weapon, but he stayed in the background, waiting. “I'm surprised that you're still in Heaven. Are you the new leader now?”
Cas seemed content to fuck him like that for hours, but at some point the pressure was too much for Dean, the urge for release more than physical. Dean barely had to say anything, just keened a “Cas, please” and the love of his life knew exactly what to do, wrapped a hand around Dean and stroked tightly until he came, moaning. It wasn't long after that Cas came, and Dean suspected it wasn't coincidence, maybe helped along by his grace to make sure they were in synch, but Dean barely cared as he held Cas so close it was almost suffocating.
“Really?” he asked, once again looking entirely serious. “Because I haven't seen any money exchanged for this purchase.”
But Dean only shook his head. He didn't want to think about Michael, definitely didn't want to talk about him now. “Can you clean us up with your mojo?” he asked instead.
Castiel studied the wall hanging again. “I suppose I didn't really think about what you do in your free time.”
“Ah, you talked to Uriel. He loved that expression.” Gabriel shook his head. “Anyway, let's not argue about semantics. I think Castiel might die from thirst otherwise.”
When Cas had fucked him before, Dean had revelled in how strong he was, how easily he could manhandle him. It had been a fucking turn on, even if he would never admit that out loud. But right now, that same display of strength made Dean's stomach churn and he had trouble putting on a smile. It must have shown, because Cas frowned down at him.
“Yeah, well. Good try.” Dean wanted to shake his head, but also didn't want to move it from where it lay on Cas' chest. So in the end, he raised a hand and patted Cas' cheek, a little clumsily. “So if I hadn't tried to settle down, if I had kept hunting. You would have come to me?”
Everyone bowed, falling silent, except for a few giggles and whispers. Ava smirked at Dean, wiggling her eyebrows, and Dean glared at her.
– a large group of people amassed around the tree, making it nearly impossible to get to it. Dean waited a little, rocking back and forth on his heels, until there was a clearing he could inject himself into in search for his own presents.
But what if Dean would never feel comfortable with this again? What if Cas wanted to do it and Dean would have to shoot him down all the time? What if... Dean was starting to feel a little unsteady on his feet, and was glad when Cas put a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
“You don't want to come from my hand,” he stated, and Dean thought he could hear reproach in his voice. Or maybe he was imagining it.
“My Prince,” he mumbled, getting up, and the others made space for him to get out of the alcove. Dean reached to take Castiel's arm, then thought better of it. “Shall we go to my room, my Prince?” He was talking to the ground, head bowed.
There was some murmuring in the room, some of the Harem employees whispering to each other, probably concerning that person. Dean had never seen them before, but then again he only knew whoever visited the Harem.
When Dean felt strong enough to stand up, he put on some pants, but nothing else. He had originally planned to go out in nothing but a towel, but for some reason that suddenly seemed inappropriate, like he would be too naked, too vulnerable. Which was stupid, considering he wanted to get naked.
“Nothing as crass as that.” Gabriel made a face. “But I'd rather you be honest up front: Do you like my brother?”
“With Lisa.” Dean closed his eyes. Remembering Lisa and Ben had been painful for a long time, especially after he had asked Cas to erase their memories. But now, he found that he could think of them fondly. He was grateful for the time with them, even if it hadn't lasted.
“Yeah, for his job, or... or for the kick of it. But he treats everyone like shit. That's not...” Dean huffed and rubbed at his eyes. For some reason, getting comfortable like this had made him sleepy. Or maybe almost being killed by werewolves and finding out the last evil overlord they had done away with had left behind some presents was getting to him.
“Of course he didn't expect me to do the work at that age. But the older ones... I do believe our father gave them a lot more responsibility than they would usually have been expected to shoulder at that age. Especially Michael, as the eldest. Though Hester... I think as the eldest daughter, she wanted to make sure that our line continues. At least that would explain why she married so young and so foolishly.”
Cas thought about it for a moment, and Dean's mood fell immediately. Why wouldn't he want to come along? Was he getting tired of being in bed with him? Actually, that might be true, considering he didn't sleep, so he would just be lying there, awake, not able to move or do anything, really.
“I suspected you might need more than 'your four hours' every now and then,” Cas said, making air quotes.
Cas looked at him thoughtfully before realization dawned on his face. “Ah, I see. You do not wish to let any of the surrounding people deduce that we engage in sexual inter-”
It took Dean a while to fall back asleep, but when he did, Cas' hand was still gently rubbing his back.
Still, seeing the scowl on Dean's face as he tried hard not to move, Castiel decided to indulge him once more. “There is nothing wrong with your clothes, Dean, but they are hardly fitting for the palace.”
When Castiel crept back into Dean's room, locking the door behind him, he heard the sheets rustle once again.
Castiel was so lost in thought that he almost ran into Dean when he stopped in the doorway. Glancing over his shoulder, Castiel saw Claire, leaning against the table with a smirk on her face, apparently waiting for them.
“Oh.” He seemed genuinely surprised, which annoyed Dean for some reason. “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- Are you supporting your family?”
“Alright. You're gonna have to keep coming by then so I can keep telling you that.” Dean sounded smug.
“I know. There's precedence for kings, even.” There was a far-away look on Michael's face, but he shook out of it quickly. “If that is all...”
She stepped closer, putting the child down so she could yank his arm, inspect the bracelet. Dean held back a yelp as she almost dislocated his shoulder. After a moment, she was apparently satisfied that the bracelet was real, and stepped back, her eyes cold.
Castiel looked up in surprise, realizing that for all intents and purposes, they had been arguing, and that apparently Dean thought it more serious than Castiel had.
“No. I've never been attracted to a single person in my life.” Castiel bit back the defeated sigh that almost slipped out of him.
“What, Claire gave you a Destiel fanfiction?” Sam asked, laughing when Dean glared at him. Eileen rolled her eyes, punching his shoulder so he would look back at her, signing something Dean didn't understand.
“Yes.” Cas laughed darkly. “Though honestly, for being immortal, all angels seem to do lately is dying. I mean, I've died before. Several times. It isn't exactly a new concept for me.”
There was a long pause in which Dean covered his eyes with his hand. He didn't really want to see Cas' reaction.
After looking between Dean and Sam uncertainly a few times, Maggie went back to doing the last dishes, then quickly left the kitchen. Bobby also excused himself when he had finished his breakfast, so by the time Dean settled down to eat, with Cas sitting down beside him, there were only Sam and their mom left with them. Mary smiled at Dean as he spread some jelly on his toast.
“So you knew about... but, uh, what about my feelings? I mean. It could have been one-sided.” When Castiel gave Dean a look, he shrugged. “What? It could have been.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, okay. I get it. I should have gotten over myself and professed my undying love to you a long time ago.”
“Thank you.” Cas did something with the blanket so the hand was mostly wrapped up again while still holding the glass steady and Dean sat down next to him on the hood of the Impala. It was still a little warm, but getting cooler every minute it stood there on the gravel path. Well, if it got too cold, they could always resettle inside the car.
Cas must have seen his look, because he gestured him over, so Dean took a seat on the floor beside him. “Sam is right, you know,” he started, back to concentrating on the lights, “Christmas doesn't need to have something to do with... God, or angels, or anything like that.”
“Your-” Dean knew about Royal Companions, of course. They were the unmarried partners of members of the Royal Family. “That's like... a boyfriend of a prince, right?”
Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Dean knew that he was already working himself ragged, was already getting too little sleep, and the last thing he needed was his brother pushing for answers they didn't have, but Dean needed something. Anything.
It wasn't that he didn't understand where Cas was coming from with the clothes and the shoes, and even he had to admit that what everyone in the palace wore was far more elegant than anything Dean had ever owned. But even just the few pieces in his wardrobe that Cas had apparently ordered to bridge the time until he got tailored clothing made his stomach clench when he thought about wearing it. It didn't suit him. He was a simple man, and he neither needed nor wanted all that frippery that people around here called fashion.
“Because I like how honest you are. Please don't call me smoking hot in front of other people, but in private...” Castiel laughed again.
Castiel regarded him thoughtfully, then said slowly: “Well, I haven't met him yet, so I can't really give an informed opinion about that. But whatever his suitability regarding the palace, I highly doubt that he's better suited to be here-” He gestured at the rooms about them - “than you.”
At some point, Cas reached out his hand, but couldn't quite reach him. Knowing what he wanted, Dean leaned down to kiss him, slowing down the movement of his fingers.
“Dean. You need to let go so I can get up,” Castiel told him, but Dean just grumbled something unintelligible.
“I don't know about this show, Cas,” Dean said, eating his pizza while lying on his side on the bed, with Cas glued to his back. “The doc ain't even sexy. I mean, not ugly, but kinda old and... ya know.”
Everything was bigger than it needed to be, the ceilings even higher than in the Harem. And why were there so many paintings and wall hangings and vases and shit?
“Dean.” Castiel closed the door behind him and quickly made his way to the bed, wrapped Dean in his arms as the first tears started to fall. “Shh, it's okay.” That was a weak thing to say when he couldn't be sure, when he barely even knew what was going on, but he felt like he needed to say something, anything.
“Would you like something to drink?” Dean asked, not knowing what else to say. The he hastily added: “My Prince.” He bowed quickly.
“Sure, I'll-” Before Dean could so much as move, Cas had entered his room and came out again with two crystal glasses and a bottle.
“Oh, princess, not everything in life is logical.” The High Enchantress seemed sympathetic for a moment, but then her usual slightly amused expression returned. “So, I shall scan him for any spells or curses, and rid him of them if applicable?” She wrote something down in a small notebook.
It must be the kitchens, Dean thought, and remembering the amazing dishes he had been served so far plus the smell of the pies still filling his nose, he could barely keep from drooling. The person with the pies came out, put down more pies, went back in, and Dean made a decision. It was the hardest thing to simply walk by the pies without tasting them, but he wasn't a thief, so as much as it pained him, he was determined to ask permission first. Stepping through the doors, Dean was hit with hot, humid air, smelling of a variety of foods, though the pies' scent was currently the strongest. This was such a crass difference to the cool spring air outside that Dean felt like he had walked into a brick wall, and he could feel himself starting to sweat. Then the person with the pies came back for the doors, almost walking into him, blinking at him in surprise, then annoyance. They paled, though, when their eyes fell onto his wrist.
Dean didn't want to wake up. Or more specifically, he didn't want Cas to get up, which would probably happen once he realised that Dean was awake. Infuriatingly, though, trying to cling to sleep with teeth and nails had pretty much the opposite effect, and soon Cas was stirring under him.
Dean was beaming again. “Okay, but I gotta tell you, after that lunch my expectations for dinner are kinda through the roof.”
Dean hadn't really thought about the pronouns he had used. “Here? Mostly. Few enough women or nonbinary people visit us, and so far even fewer have chosen me.”
“Do you have another?” he asked after finishing the bottle, and Dean raised his eyebrows, but wordlessly fished another bottle out of the car.
Cas only gave him a few seconds like that before he shuffled off him, though he immediately pulled Dean against himself as he hit the mattress so both of them were on their side, Dean's face to Cas's chest.
He shouldn't have used Dean's bed to begin with, though. He was probably going to wake up stiff and annoyed at the arrogant Prince who had taken his bed. He was also, Castiel realized, going to hate it if Castiel actually stayed. Not that he had the intention to. Quickly, Castiel got up, arranging his robe into something that resembled decency, and hastened out of the room.
“We can do that.” This time, their kisses were calmer, sweeter, though they still made Dean's heart beat faster. They ended up lying on the bed, Dean on top, rubbing against the hard lines of Cas' body. “Did you happen to wake up horny today?”
“Here. You should drink something, you probably haven't had any water since-” Cas bit off his own words and helped Dean take a few sips, then put the bottle back down.
The hand on his knee was travelling higher, up his thigh, when Gabriel appeared next to their table.
Cas sighed. “I can't. At least I don't know any way to... There might be something I can do, but it wouldn't help much in the long run. Besides, Heaven is not my top priority right now.”
Castiel froze, almost tearing the papers. He took a deep breath. “I suppose everyone has heard of it by now.” He wondered if Zachariah had told on him, and what exactly it was he had said to Michael.
“Cas,” Dean croaked out, hiding his face in Cas' neck even though they couldn't see each other in the dark, anyway. “Who the fuck cares about that? You don't have to fight, you don't have to be useful to us or some shit, you just... I don't want you to rush into this only to regret it afterwards.”
“Uncle, please. What are you even saying.” Cas seemed scandalized. “This is an age old occupation, you could show some respect to-”
“Smells good in here,” someone suddenly said behind Sam, and he jumped a little, whirling around to find Charlie grinning at him, with Rowena trailing behind her. “Do we have to help if we wanna eat, or...?”
Prince Gabriel put a hand over his heart in mock shock. “But Cassie. If I can't even call my own beloved brother by a nickname, then what has this world come to?”
“Dean. You need to let go so I can get up,” Castiel told him, but Dean just grumbled something unintelligible.
They lay like that for a while until Dean started to drift of, one of Cas' hands in his hair and the other one on his hip.
Castiel sighed. “Not many secrets to steal, I'm afraid, unless you're interested in the prices for roast beef throughout the kingdom.”
“Dean.” He pulled him into a kiss, then kept beaming at him. “Everything is prepared, are you ready to go?”
When Castiel awoke the next morning to the blaring sound of his time piece, it took him a moment to realize that he was not in his own room, and that the warmth on his back was Dean. He reached for the time piece and turned it off, but jostled Dean in the process, who just grunted and grabbed him tighter.
Dean's heart had been beating fast ever since he had brought up the topic, but oddly enough, it took this moment to calm down. This was known territory for him. Sex. Cas. Sex with Cas – okay, maybe that was still kind of novel, considering.
“We can let them out through the garage,” Cas said, signing. “Then the apocalypse world hunters won't ever have to see them.”
Dean was smiling again. “Now why would I do that? But, uh, what about your family? What are they gonna say?”
Right. He hadn't had lunch yet. Looking around in the room, he didn't see any way to get or make food, no lever that might magically produce something edible, so eventually he stepped out into the corridor.
Me? Actually finishing something?? It's apparently more likely than you think, even though it did take me longer than I'd hoped. :)
Dean seemed to spend most of the day in the kitchen, helping the others cook and bake. Almost all the hunters would be back for Christmas, so there would dozens of people, plus those who Cas had dubbed 'Christmas guests'. So they had guests over for Christmas now. Life was weird.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence, Cassie. Now, just so we're clear, you know this isn't actually necessary now that we got a bunch of new angels here, yeah?” Gabriel was frowning, his eyes – all of them – intent and his wings stiff, as if he were worried.
“Okay, but what do we know?” Dean asked, crossing his arms in front of his chest, leaning back against the kitchen counter. “I get that we got no clue how many there are in total, but how many do you know of? How many have you guys seen or... or killed yet? Just gimme something here.”
“I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner,” Castiel managed to say before Dean kissed him, throwing his arms around him. He wanted to sing and dance, to press his face into Dean's hair and never let go of him. Instead, he asked: “Did you have a good day?”
It's in the second half of the chapter, when they get to Dean's room, if anyone wants to skip it. :)
The last part sounded bitter, and Dean couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy despite Cas' assurances that he was more important. “We'll find a way, Cas,” he said quietly. “We always do.”
“Yeah, no. It's just you were gonna, like...” Dean's face burned with embarrassment. Doing it was one thing, but talking about it... “You were gonna... gonna top.”
Dean wasn't sure why Cas was angry, but he had definitely been furious and it made his stomach drop. He was just doing his job, flirting with this noble whose name he didn't even know and whose smirk reminded him a bit too much of Gabriel. Their hand on his knee wasn't exactly a wanted touch, though he wasn't repulsed by them either, but he wished it were Cas touching him instead.
“If it makes you uncomfortable, it makes no sense to do it. Given your latest... experiences, it is no surprise that you are reluctant to give up control or have something inserted into you.”
“No. No, it's fine. It's not like anything's gonna happen, we're safe, and – and you deserve to rest. It's my fault you're running low on grace anyway.”
“Yes.” The Prince seemed hesitant for a moment, then started walking towards the yard. Dean followed him.
Castiel pressed his lips into a thin line, but nodded. “There is precedence, you know. For a prince to settle beneath his station.” He had actually expected to have to cite these precedences, to convince his brother that this wasn't a complete disgrace to the crown.
“Of course. We will always come for you, Dean,” Cas said, his voice muffled by the fabric of Dean's shirt in front of his mouth.
“He wasn't me, not really. Oh, it was my grace, and even the same vessel, and I'm sure I could have become like him, if... He was... broken, Dean, beyond repair.” Cas was speaking softly, and thankfully so low that only Dean could hear him. “I'm guessing their version of Naomi might have had something to do with it, or perhaps it was Michael himself. We will never know. In any case, he broke. Probably because he had no one to fight for, no one to be strong for. Because you never existed in his world.”
Dean had thought about coming out before, knew he would have to do it before settling down with Cas. After all, how would he explain to Sammy that he wanted to buy a house with Cas and live together with him forever, have Eileen and him over for lunch on Sundays, guest rooms always ready for Claire and Jack and whoever would drop by? Sure, being the professional liar that he was, he might have come up with something, some bullshit to tell Sam that kept up his 'totally heterosexual, nothing to see here' image. But again, that wasn't fair, and it also wasn't what he wanted.
“I would have come sooner, but...” Cas grimaced. As he stepped closer, Dean saw the bags under his eyes for the first time. “There was simply too much to do.”
Cas fared a bit better against them, courtesy of his own superhuman strength, even if he wasn't as powerful as he used to be back in the day. He fought off two of the wolves, while the third one advanced on Dean again, who had used his time in the broken crates to get his silver knife out of his boot.
