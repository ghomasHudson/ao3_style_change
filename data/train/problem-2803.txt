Castiel nodded and gestured towards the table. “Thank you for agreeing to come,” he said. “Please, have a seat.”
Castiel looked at her, surprised. Even with as little attention as he paid to local gossip, he knew who Richard Roman was. The man had moved to Havenport the previous autumn, purchasing the old Debensham estate on the cliff overlooking the town, harbor, and sea. The nature of his wealth and his business was still a mystery, provoking more interest than might otherwise have arisen. “Why would he wish to speak to me?”
He was very authoritative for a guest, but Castiel found that oddly comforting. He nodded, got out the linens and then proceeded to wash up and change out of his ruined clothes. “Do you need a change of clothes? Yours have also seen better days.”
“Temporarily, yes. I am thinking even more seriously that I want to remodel the kitchen. But not until the weather turns warmer. It will be a significant amount of work and a significant inconvenience while the work is being done, but when it is complete I will have the kitchen I’ve always wanted. The kitchen in the condo in Chicago was a nicely equipped kitchen, I suppose, but it was so… cold.”
“You okay there?” Dean’s voice was closer than Cas remembered, soft, quiet, gently capturing his attention without demanding it. It helped to ground him in the here and now.
He wanted to say other things, to branch out from the topics of their business connection, but every time he started to, he lost his courage. Surely Dean wouldn’t be interested. Theirs was a professional relationship, after all. Dean was there to do work that Castiel desperately needed done on this house. He wasn’t there to be a friend, even if he was friendly. There was a distinct difference.
Castiel hugged him back, holding him close. The giddiness he felt was foreign. He hadn’t felt anything like this since, since Alfie. He bent his head, resting his forehead in the crook between Dean’s neck and his shoulder. Inhaling, he could smell the uniquely spice and leather scent of the man, the salt tang of the ocean fading into the distance.
“Ha.” He set his case down under the hall table, then came over to bend down and press a kiss to his daughter’s head. “She been asleep long?”
“Mm,” Cas grunted, and sipped at his own mug. He leaned back against the cabinet, more relaxed than Dean had seen him yet. It gave him a particular pleasure, because he didn’t think that happened very often. So maybe Cas did actually like him? Might be open to friendship, at least? That was certainly worth pursuing. Dean had friends in Caroline, of course, but most of the people his age were settling down, starting families. It cut into their availability to just hang out with friends. He was always welcome, he knew that, but… yeah. Sometimes he felt a little lonely.
The door to his office was hanging crooked on the hinges. Beyond, his precious books lay here and there, scattered on the floor, on the desk, on his chair. The spines of some were broken, the pages of others ripped and torn.
“You know, I think this is the farthest east I’ve ever been?” Dean comments as they make their way towards the Shurley estate, in rural Virginia.
“Does that mean you won’t be going there anymore?” Jess asked, her brow wrinkling with concern. “I mean, it’s great if you finish, but it seems like you like going out there.”
Castiel watched Dean spread out a notebook on the table, reviewing his notes with his pen stuck between his teeth. He’d gotten into some dirty places; cobwebs adorned his short hair, and the shoulders of his burgundy flannel shirt were covered in a fine layer of dust and other detritus. He’d stopped to wash his hands, so they at least were clean.
“Yeah, I agree, that’s awesome. Thanks.” Dean flashed him a smile. “Shouldn’t be too much longer. Just let things finish cooking. You want to pour some of that wine and we can go watch football or something in the other room? Unless you’re in the mood for another viewing of Frozen. Don’t know about you, but I’ve seen it so many times that I can recite it from memory even if it’s not playing.”
Maybe not so much, but he couldn’t say that. Even if he was aware that Bela liked her even less than he did. “Yes, we are. It sounds like her new position is something that will suit her well, though.” He hoped she didn’t ask any questions. Dean didn’t have a clue what Naomi was actually planning to do now. Maybe she was just going to watch Netflix all day and knit.
There was a suspicious glint in Bobby’s eyes, and a twitch at the corner of his mouth. “Sure, son. I mean, needs a bit of work on the exhaust system before she’s ready to go, but that won’t take long. Just need to get ‘er up on the lifts and pull the bad pipes and replace ‘em.”
“There you are.” Cas’ mom, Becky, comes over to Cas and Dean as they reach the bottom of the staircase. “Oh, don’t you both just look amazing?” She pats Cas on the cheek, then tugs him down to kiss him. Dean smirks, but that smirk goes away when she turns to him and repeats the action. Her lips are cool on his cheek.
“I’ve been worried about finding Naomi’s replacement. Replacement’s probably the wrong word. Successor. There are some internal candidates, as you know. I’m not sure any of them are really the best choice. But we’re at a bar, playing trivia. Not at work. So, you know. Trying not to bring that up right now. Leave work at work.”
Highly unlikely, even for Michael, but he was well aware that was one urban legend that Michael didn’t feel needed to be corrected.
“Told you she was important to us,” Dean reminded him. “So yeah. Named after our two moms. Big shoes to fill, hm, Peanut? But don’t you worry about that. You are who you are, and that’s more than enough.” He bounced her against his shoulder, patting her back and brushing a kiss against her head.
He snorted indelicately. Yes, that would be quite an entertainment for anyone who happened to be watching. Still, he was uneasy. He hoped this wasn’t a portent of the night to come. He wouldn’t be happy if he had another night like the one before, filled with strange sounds, strange lights, and the hints of unexplained movement.
He quickly forgot about the sculpture, however, when Roman brought out a particularly well-preserved volume of Greek poetry. He donned his own protective gloves. “May I?” he asked.
“Well, you know coming here doesn’t count as ‘going out for a drink’. It counts as checking in with the people who care about you.”
He nodded. “Okay.” The two of them headed off, Adler briefly brushing his hand across her elbow as though to guide her.
Castiel jumped, his attention ripped away from the magnificent work of art hanging on the wall of the antechamber. Naomi Haversham, wedding planner extraordinaire, looked at him with a narrowed gaze, the toes of her black pumps tapping against the marble floor.
It was the blond from his first trip to Caroline, the one Cas had seen with Dean and the baby. The baby that was in the carrier she held with one hand.
Cas blushes adorably, the blush that starts at the back of his neck and spreads up to turn his ears pink. “Yes, well… we wanted to avoid the awkwardness, with the roommates situation and all, if for some reason it didn’t work out.”
The fondness in Dean’s voice made Cas’ chest feel warm. Of all his characters, in many ways Alek was closest to himself. For Dean to claim him as his favorite character? He didn’t quite know what to do with that. It probably meant nothing. Alek was, after all, a fictional character. Feelings didn’t necessarily translate from fiction to reality.
Cas looked at him with a narrowed gaze. “Do you already have such a relationship with someone at Sandover, Mr. Winchester? If so, you should have disclosed it in your application forms.”
Cas got into his car, smiling to himself when he got behind the wheel. He was still pleased with the Continental—not least because of the good-natured insults Dean cast her way whenever he saw her. He waved at Dean’s neighbor. He hadn’t yet spoken to the man, but he’d seen him enough times that his face was now familiar and unthreatening.
Given that it was the new moon, it should have been too dark to see anything—but there had been a slight green-tinged glow coming from the northeast, in the direction of the rocky section of coastline. That too made him uneasy. It had started some two months ago. When he’d asked his colleague, Dr. Engelbret, about the phenomenon, he’d suggested that the bioluminescent mosses inside the sea caverns had perhaps become excited and with atmospheric conditions, were visible from a greater distance than customary. That sounded unlikely to Castiel, but Dr. Engelbret was the expert in natural history, so he’d convinced himself to defer to his judgment.
“You’re here!” Dean barely managed to lift his arms up and away from his body before Charlie wrapped him up in a big hug.
His second identity he kept strictly private. Even Gabriel didn’t know about Steven Emmanuel. The Emmanuel works were imaginative, fantastic, a world he could escape into that was nothing like this world. He’d written them for himself, and after completing the third novel it occurred to him that they might actually be good enough for publication. Now, at book six, they were solidly successful, earning far more than dry, scholarly works ever would.
“Prefer being the operative word. If you really like spinach and strawberry pie, well, I don’t know if we can continue this friendship. I’d be sad to lose you, but some things just can’t be forgiven.”
Cas looks at Dean, considering. “You should be okay without a shower, though if you would feel better there is certainly time for it.”
Okay, Winchester, pull it together. He cleared his throat, sat up straighter. “There’s a chair over there, if you want to discuss the position,” he said, trying to inject icy civility into his tone. “My desk is not a seat.”
Castiel sat in his turret room, ostensibly working on his latest novel, but in reality staring blankly out the window. Feelings of vague dissatisfaction gnawed at him, making his stomach turn over and his chest feel tight.
“Yes, I’d like to see if I can make any headway on my office.” He stopped then as a thought occurred to him. “Unless it would be wiser to remain here, to discourage the thieves.”
Harvelle’s Roadhouse was nothing spectacular from the outside, Cas had thought as Dean pulled into a gravel parking lot and stopped the truck. The building was boxy and had few windows, simply a row of high, narrow panes of glass under the eaves. The exterior was a mix of metal and concrete, and there were neon signs for various brands of beer blinking on and off. He thought they would be much more prominent at night, rather than in the bright light of mid afternoon.
“Oh shit, it got late,” Dean suddenly exclaimed, looking at his watch. “I really should be heading back to my place.”
Gabriel reached out to pat his knee, then stood up. “I think there are still some brownies. You want one?”
He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. Something about Winchester shouted ‘danger’. Castiel didn’t want to examine the whys behind that too closely. Yet despite the danger, he was also intriguing. God help him, but Castiel was tempted. He didn’t usually indulge temptations. The price was often too high. But maybe just this once.
“Both. Well, separate plots, mostly likely, though there are certain flowers which serve as natural deterrents to wildlife nibbling on vegetable seedlings. I should likely start with a small plot, learn what I need to. I’ve never grown my own produce before. It’s probably too late to special order particular seeds or plants, but I can get things that are common to the area, and learn what I need to know. Apparently there are quite a few things to learn. Things like soil density, the nutrient balance, how much to water things… and different plants have different ideal treatment, though many can do quite well even under less than ideal circumstances.”
“Yeah, we talked about it about half a year ago, Dean, when we were at Bobby’s. Enoch River is, was, one of those communities that was destroyed. Never really made any of the news cycles because it was a relatively small rural community.”
Cas feels a spike of panic. If anyone is going to see through their deception, it’s most likely going to be Gabriel. There’s a reason that ‘it takes one to know one’ is a saying.
“I’m going to talk Cas into going to the Roadhouse with me,” he abruptly voiced something he’d been toying with for some time. “I’d like him to realize that the people around here, at least a big chunk of them, are good people and would like to get to know him. He could use a bigger support system than Gabriel.”
Staying longer would only make it harder to leave. His head started to ache. He rubbed at his temples, his desires fighting with his logic.
He crossed his arms over his chest. “No. Seriously, Red, I mean it. No.” He could feel his shoulders tensing up and climbing up towards his ears, and heat spreading everywhere. He’d be mortified, absolutely mortified.
“Is there anything I can do?” He scanned over the collection of books. Vonnegut, as Dean had mentioned. And the entire collected works — six of them — of one Steven Emmanuel. Cas hesitated, then pulled out the first one. This was his first published work of fiction, and as such still could make his heart race. The paperback looked well used, the corners worn and dog-eared. The covers and spine were creased, and some of the pages were soiled.
Cas scowled even more fiercely, but… well. “Why do you have to be responsible when I don’t want you to be?”
Cas swallowed. He wasn’t really going to do this, was he? But he had to. “I, uh. Well. Um. No. It’s not important.”
Dean blushed. “Well, yeah, you know. Okay. So… you do any exploring around Caroline?” Definitely time for a topic change. Thankfully Cas went along with it, and listened while Dean gave him the whole tour guide routine on the way to the Roadhouse. Cas’ house was southeast of Caroline; the Roadhouse was straight south. Dean could have gotten to the Roadhouse without driving through the city, but he opted to take the route that ran down Main. He pointed out the three bars and two churches, the diner where Gabriel had purchased the donuts, the park with the river running along its southern edge, the grocery and hardware stores. “The library is back that way a block, between Sam’s place and the building where his office is.” He turned south, drove another five blocks. “And here we are. Harvelle’s Roadhouse.”
Castiel was as good with numbers as he was with words. It was people that he didn’t understand, people who were able to take advantage of his nature. People who were able to inflict the kind of damage he was having problems recovering from.
“One does what one must. I’ll be fine, Dean.” He made a mental note to ask about that falling off of ladders later on. That didn’t sound good.
Circled around the slab were six robed and hooded people, four at the cardinal points, one slowly walking a circle outside the others, the sixth painting symbols on Dean’s naked chest. Dean twisted his torso with every stroke of the pen, hissing around the gag. From what he’d read in the journal, the paint was a mixture of blood and a weak acid – but clearly the acid was still strong enough to burn.
Three more nights. They still had three more nights here. Three more nights of sharing a bed with Dean.
Castiel tipped his head to the side thoughtfully. “I have read through some of the book. It is not at all what I was expecting.”
“Thank you. It isn’t large, but it suits my needs.” He took Dean’s outer coat and hung it on a hook beside the door. “I hope you like cod. As you might imagine, seafood is plentiful here in Havenport.”
He toasted some English muffins, melted some Cheddar cheese on them and made microwave scrambled eggs. They were… well, not as good as stovetop scrambled eggs, maybe, but far better than Dean would have expected.
He waited until nine o’clock the next morning before he texted Cas to see if he was up. He was, so Dean headed over — after changing into his best pair of jeans and a flannel so new it still bore traces of the folds from the packaging. Part of him wanted to run, but this was too important.
Dean shifts, seeming nervous for some reason. “Just go with it, okay?” he murmurs. He lifts his hand then, laying it gently against Cas’ cheek. His fingertips are slightly rough, yet infinitely tender. He brushes his thumb lightly against the corner of Cas’ mouth, and Cas shivers.
Charlie and Dorothy returned, then, sliding into the booth with them. “Almost time for the next round of trivia, bitches! You ready to take back the crown?”
Gabriel parked the rental car in an open spot on Main Street, and Castiel pulled out a book from the inner pocket of his tan trench coat. He might watch the people, but having a book for a cover meant he could quickly glance down again, and people were more likely to leave him alone if it appeared that he was buried in a book.
Dean Winchester, Interim Chief of Security, allowed himself the luxury of being distracted by the commotion in the courtyard, knowing that his staff wouldn’t let it disrupt their assignments. Damn Rufus for passing this off on him. He hadn’t even gotten injured on the job. He’d gotten salmonella from a damned potato salad at a fucking community picnic, and gotten sicker than a dog, hospitalized for a week and still too weak and disoriented to be trusted with the security for the biggest event in Dean’s lifetime. Hell, this was probably the biggest event in ten lifetimes.
“I do hope so, yes. Thank you.” Cas nodded, then reluctantly turned and strode across the courtyard back to the designers’ staging area and his world of wire supports, greenery, fancy vases, and green floral tape.
Castiel had purchased a fish on his way home from the Museum – a small cod – and had started to prepare some root vegetables to serve alongside the fish. He wasn’t particularly good at cooking, but necessity (and Mrs. Crombie) had taught him a handful of simple meals so that he could occasionally dine at home. He’d purchased some bread, as well, and he still had some butter in the crock. That along with a bottle of wine ought to do for his meal with Dean.
Gabriel prodded and poked at Castiel until he agreed to go to the town’s central business district with him. Castiel didn’t promise to get out of the car at all, but he could at least take a visual survey of Caroline and start to familiarize himself with the local economy.
“I’ll have to spend more time working with it. My first translations are rudimentary, not rigorous. There are symbols that I did not understand, which could change the meaning.”
For all the good it did. Charlie still showed up almost right away. “Oh my God, Dean — are you okay?” Charlie leaned into Dean’s office at Sandover, her eyes wide with concern. “You look awful.”
Dean took the three steps up to the porch in a single stride, and rapped sharply on the door. He knew for a fact the doorbell was iffy at best.
“So you gave him the old heave-ho. I’m sorry, man. That’s rough.” Dean really is sympathetic. Whether or not he actually likes Danny doesn’t matter. Cas dealing with heartbreak is what’s important. He can keep the little glow of vindication to himself until enough time has passed that it won’t sting the same way.
“If I had a date for New Year’s Eve, I wouldn’t be considering your invitation. A slumber party would not be where I hoped the evening would end.”
Cas stepped inside and settled on the guest chair, keeping to the edge rather than fully relaxing. “I was going through your paperwork and saw that you’ve listed the local Stay-Inn as your address. Do you have more permanent housing arranged?”
After the meal, Castiel cleaned up before fetching the book and sitting down with it near the oil lamp. He started to read through the book, reading half a page here and there while Dean took notes, trying to get the gist of the contents.
Worst case, Dean wouldn’t listen to him and would have Castiel arrested, and would inform Lord Michael of the incident. If Michael saw him, paid any attention to him at all, it would be over. He wouldn’t just be imprisoned. He would pay with his life for the crime of trespassing in Michael’s home without permission.
“They’re great, just wonderful. Jess was saying she’d like to have you and Dean over sometime, maybe play some board game or something. It’d be great to have a fourth. Some games are just better with four people, and Mariel is a little young to keep up so far.”
“They’re gonna be just simple freestanding bookshelves. Pretty hard to screw them up past redemption,” Dean sweetened the pot.
“Not even Gabriel,” Cas confirmed. “What no one knew, they wouldn’t be able to try to take from me.” He released a shuddering breath, made a quarter turn so that he was partially facing Dean. “It was hard enough for my family to accept my writing about dry ancient texts. I can only imagine what Michael and Luc would think of speculative fiction, especially… especially with the direction this series is going.”
“The usual. I wouldn’t know what ‘the usual’ is. Not for a private investigator. How did you come by your profession?”
“No, it’s not okay, I spilled on you. I’m so sorry. Sometimes I do things like that when, when, well. When I’m a bit nervous. I shouldn’t be nervous, it’s just that you’re so pretty, I mean handsome, because usually men don’t like to be called pretty though I don’t understand what’s wrong with it, and this is something else I do when I’m embarrassed, I babble, and I will just shut up now.”
Here in the main business district of the town, there was a certain charm to the buildings. Most of them had brick facades, though some had clapboard siding painted in fresh colors with a vaguely Victorian feel. Awnings shaded the display windows, some plain, some striped. Some of the storefronts even maintained planters with bursts of colorful flowers – petunias, trailing potato vines, ivy, impatiens, begonias. The most elaborate planters were in front of a store called Mildred’s Moments – multiple planters of varied heights and widths, planted with a harmonious blend of foliage plants and cheerful white and yellow flowers with splashes of pink and orange and deep purple. He approached without real intention, smiling to see fat bees lazily drifting from one bloom to the next.
“Yeah, okay.” Gabriel licked and sucked at the pink lollipop for a little while, considering, bouncing his knee, tapping his fingers against his thigh. “Do you remember coming here, when we were kids?”
The movie ended shortly before midnight. “It’s almost time!” Charlie exclaimed. “Here.” She handed out noisemakers. “Any kissing for good luck in the New Year is up to you, but I’m expecting one from each of you. Just on the cheek, and I assure you it’s completely platonic. So no policy violations here.”
“It’s a pleasure, gentlemen. As I mentioned, I’ve been Mrs. Albright’s lawyer for a few years now, and she designated me to be the executor of her estate, until it’s been fully distributed to her beneficiaries.” He opened his briefcase and brought out some papers. “It’s been established that the four of you are her sole remaining blood relatives. And your children, of course.” He nodded towards Michael before sitting down across from him. He waited as Luc and Gabriel sat on the other sides of the table, sparing a quick glance to Castiel, who chose to remain on the edge of the room.
Such an irony that anyone thought he was great at characterization, when he was so bad at interacting with real people. His fictional people, however, always did what he wanted them to, or if not, at least they let him know what was really going on in their heads. They didn’t make him believe something while plotting something entirely different. They didn’t pretend to care for him. They didn’t pretend to love him, while what they really loved was a pathway to the Novak fortune.
“I wish… I wish I’d had the opportunity to know her better,” he said. “I suspect my life might have been vastly different had that been permitted.”
That name sounded vaguely familiar, though he couldn’t place it right at the moment. “I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the art history lesson, but you need to get back to your work. I’ll escort you.” He made a gesture back towards the courtyard entrance and waited for Cas to precede him.
As he watched Walker shifted, displaced air shimmering with heat and that peculiar magic that their kind had never fully defined, but all innately understood. Where one moment there had been a dark-skinned human of middle years and middle height, now there was a long snake-form dragon, red scales tipped with black, four legs tipped with long sharp talons. Most Walkers were not flying dragons, and Gordon was no exception. He had no wings, but Castiel wasn’t foolish enough to believe that made him less of a threat.
“Hi, Dean,” the girl said with a bright, friendly smile. She nudged her companion in the arm, seeming almost giddy. “I’m Charlie, and this is Castiel. He thinks you’re cute.”
Dean leads him to the garden path and up the hill until they reach an overlook with a view of the golf course.
Cas laughed. “Deal. You do look as though you are perhaps overdue for a shower and shave, however. It’s an appealing look on you.” He leg his hand slide down over Dean’s breastbone. His skin tingled everywhere Cas touched, even through the thin fabric of the worn AC/DC tee.
“Yes. The kitchen.” Cas looked around the space. “I believe that my brother mentioned I enjoy cooking. I’ve coveted some of the kitchens I’ve seen on television shows and in magazines. I realize those are showplace kitchens and not realistic for the general populace, and yet I believe there is substantial room for improvement in this space even if it doesn’t approach those models.”
“I think we’re about done with the game,” Dean said. “You go sit on the couch with her while we get cleaned up, yeah?”
“Yeah? I didn’t know he was back in town.” Dean took a sip of his drink, casting a quick glance at Cas. “How’s he doing?”
“We need to figure out where all of this is going to happen. I’m going to do a bit of… shall we say, intelligence gathering.”
“Nothing more we can do to prepare tonight, though.” She flopped down onto the apartment’s couch. “We should go out. Have a drink or three. Relax a little before Operation Recovery goes into full swing.”
That didn’t seem like a good idea, and yet Dean seemed genuinely interested. Highly reluctant, Cas pulled a small notebook and pen out of the inner pocket of his coat, flipped to a blank page, and started drawing a handful of very early symbols.
Castiel heard a thump against the side of the house. He looked out the window, saw a ladder and Dean climbing it. From this angle he could see that the man’s legs were slightly bowed. His jeans fit him quite well.
“Is it?” He glanced towards his window. Judging by the angle of the sunlight, it was indeed afternoon. Well. Losing track of time like that wasn’t uncommon for him. There were days when he was squinting for a long time before he realized the entire day had passed and it was growing dark outside once more.
He shook his head quickly. “Sorry,” he said. “I… sorry. That’s just…” He took a deep breath. “My apologies. That comment simply struck a little close to home for me. It brought back some difficult memories.”
“I have sandwiches prepared for lunch,” he said. “Roast beef and cheddar on sourdough bread. There are onions and lettuce and various condiments for you to apply as you prefer.”
“Well. One day done,” Dean breaks the silence, kicking his shoes off and flexing his toes into the rag rug, then bouncing on the balls of his feet to stretch his calf muscles. “Your grandma kicks ass.”
He’s glad that Dean can’t see his expression, but he has the sinking sensation that Gabriel can, and also knows him well enough to read it correctly. There’s a little flicker in Gabe’s expression that worries him. He isn’t sure if it’s better to ignore him, or try and head him off at the pass somehow by talking to him alone.
Cas exhaled on a long breath, then shook his head. “No, I’m good.” He stood up, tugged his shirt down into place and retrieved his trench coat. “Thank you for this evening, Dean. I enjoyed myself.”
“If you’re making it from scratch it is. And you’re calling it pasta with marinara sauce, not just spaghetti.”
Cas was looking a little pale, but he hadn’t disappeared to lock himself in the turret room, so Dean counted that a win. “You ready?” He pulled the keys to his truck out of his pocket and tossed them, catching them again with a jingle.
It might be nothing. There were people who had legitimate reason to be here. But one didn’t get to advance in the security field by assuming anything unexpected was legitimate. Assume the worst.
To be perfectly honest he wasn’t so sure how he felt about it himself, though that had more to do with the individuals involved than the interspecies nature of their relationship. Lord Michael was an arrogant prick, and Bela Talbot was a scheming social climber out for herself.
Though if he’d come with Danny as originally planned? He would have expected to share a room with him. He just wasn’t thinking.
The man shifted and aimed his foot at Cas’ face. Cas rolled to the side, but his heel still jammed into his shoulder, sparking more pain. He was only remotely aware of it at the moment, the adrenaline rush dimming everything else to nothing more than a vague awareness that it was going to hurt like hell a little later.
He’d last been here, what, last fall? Had it really been that long? Mrs. Albright had a leaking sink, bad enough that there was water all over her kitchen floor. She couldn’t close her eyes and pretend that wasn’t a problem, so she’d called him over. After he’d replaced the elbow joint and checked the other pipes she’d given him a cup of strong black coffee and a couple chocolate chip cookies, store-bought now instead of the homemade ones he remembered from before she’d stopped baking, but it was still the hospitable thing to do, and he’d spent a good extra twenty minutes chatting her up and giving her the best of the Dean Winchester charm.
Cas looked at him then, studying him, evaluating. Dean threw him back a challenging look, not wanting any pity. But pity wasn’t what he saw in Cas’ blue eyes… just some sort of consideration, and curiosity. He didn’t ask any of the questions Dean expected. Instead he set down the tools he’d been working with and wiped his hands on his jeans, nodded once in acknowledgment.
“I own a small chain of sweet shops in the greater Chicago area, and I’ve been looking at expanding into other markets. And Castiel writes books.”
“I’m glad you did,” Dean said, reaching across the table to touch Cas’ hand, lightly, briefly. “It means a lot.” He wanted to close his hand over the other man’s, twine his fingers and squeeze, not just brush his fingertips across Cas’ knuckles, but that was too much. He knew that.
“I don’t spend every moment in here.” Cas looked up in time to catch Dean’s skeptical glance. “All right. Most moments. But not all. I like it here. This room is a large part of why I wanted to stay here. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted from a writing space. It’s isolated from the rest of the house so that it feels like I’m going away to work. And the views are amazing.”
When the stench of the spilled blood hit him, though, his intentions all went for naught. He sat up, turned to the side and emptied his stomach, the beer tasting much more foul on the return trip.
“No. No, Dean, stay. I… yes. Well.” He picked at the edge of the tape that sealed the box closed, loosening it as he gathered his courage. “I... if this is what I believe it to be, I want you to have one of them.”
Dean’s eyes widen when he returns. “Dude. You’re wearing actual pajamas. You never wear actual pajamas. You wear boxers and t-shirts with clever environmentalist sayings on them that you love but refuse to wear in public.”
“Cas.” He reached out, managed to catch Cas’ shirt in his fingers but couldn’t get a good grip. They fell away as the other man eased back and stood again.
Winchester chuckled. “It’s afternoon, in any event. I will leave it to you to determine whether or not it’s good.” He came forward and seated himself without invitation in the chair opposite Castiel. “I know it’s late, but have you taken your lunch yet? I thought I could treat you, and you can tell me what you’ve found so far.”
“It’s not too personal. I mean, sure it’s personal, but you’re allowed.” Dean blew out his breath, then shrugged one shoulder. “It wasn’t any one thing. Just… lack of a spark? If I imagined my life five years from now, I didn’t automatically picture Aaron without making an effort to do so.”
Over dinner Dean couldn’t help but notice Cas watching him more than usual, with that little furrow between his brows that meant he was trying to figure something out.
Dean met Cas for dinner after work on Friday at Cas’ place. They had a standing dinner night twice a month. At first they’d tried rotating whose place it was at, but gradually it ended up being at Cas’ more often than not. Cas actually had a house, unlike Dean and Charlie. Charlie couldn’t make it tonight; she had weekend plans with Dorothy, a weekend trip out of town that she’d been looking forward to forever.
Dean broke out laughing. “Okay then. Bet you’d never be able to make that shot if you were actually trying to.” He shifted boxes until he managed to retrieve his knife. “Much easier to just cut them open than try and dig the tape off with your fingernails. Especially when you don’t have much in the way of fingernails to begin with.”
Gabe nodded. “Castiel has a fairly small apartment back in Chicago, right in the middle of the city. Place like this suits him better. It seems at least habitable, from what I can tell, though it clearly needs a lot of work. I’m not a contractor, though. I own candy stores.”
Castiel swallowed hard, shook his head. “But you had no reason to, really. No reason to trust me enough to share your suspicions with me, no reason to believe I wouldn’t tell him anything you had told me in hopes of winning more favor with him and obtaining the donation he has dangled.”
Dean follows Cas through the halls of the immense house, aiming towards the sound of people talking and laughing. Sometimes he hears the racing footsteps of children playing tag. Sometimes he even catches a quick glimpse of movement.
“Are you mad?” Castiel exclaimed. “You cannot possibly believe in magic.  It is the stuff of fairytales and the beliefs of uneducated people. We know better now than we did in the dark ages. There is no such thing as magic. There is science, and there is art. But legends are just that… legends, with phenomena that can be explained through logic and science.”
“I just can’t get over the way Cas looked at me when I spilled my deep, dark secret.” Dean rubbed at the back of his neck, then stared up at the ceiling. “It was… I don’t even know what it was. Shock. Dismay. Pretty clear I destroyed our friendship with that one, and damn. I could live with wanting him but still being friends. Just being around the guy… Fuck.”
The elevator doors opened onto the sales floor. Dean looked around, curious. He was going to be spending a lot of time here, after all. “This is the floor,” Zach said. “Elevator bank in the middle, rest rooms too. There’s a small kitchenette down that way, with a coffee machine and vending machine. The main break room is on the third floor. My office is the one in the corner there.” He pointed. “You’re over this way.” There were offices and conference rooms all along the windows. Dean’s, it turned out, was right next to the small conference room in another corner. They must be on the same side of the building as the room they’d met in this morning, because there was the same river view.
“Five… four… three…. Two… One! Happy New Year!” Charlie exclaimed, bouncing up and down, blowing her little horn and rattling the noisemaker.
“Do you always call her Grandmother?” Dean asks, curious. “Never anything like Gram, or Gammy, or Nana? Even Grandma?”
“Okay, showtime,” Dean murmurs as they get up to the floral arch delineating the entrance to the ceremony site, where rows and rows of white folding wooden chairs are arranged facing the wedding arch on the far end. He reaches out to take Cas’ hand, twining their fingers together.
Just as they were finishing their lunch and preparing to leave there was a disturbance at the entrance to the Rusty Anchor. A group of young men, employed at the docks by their clothing and the smell of the ocean that clung to them, came inside and made their way to a booth nearby.
“Sitting rooms. Are there really three? Does that include living rooms and parlors? What even is the difference between them?”
He wants that. He wants someone who’s all of that for him, with him. The problem? The problem is that the only person who could possibly fit the bill is sitting next to him, oblivious to everything that Dean is feeling. Cas loves him, Dean knows he does. Just not the way that Dean wants to be loved.
“Yeah, you’d better be sorry,” she snapped. “You break anything you’re gone. You think you’ve seen difficult clients before, you’re mistaken. This is a whole different level of difficult client. If a dragon is unhappy, he might eat you.”
It didn’t take long before he discovered that the book was a personal journal, written by someone who seemed to have lived in eastern Europe some centuries ago. Fascinated, he let himself become absorbed in the words of the unknown author.
“Yes. But we were talking last night, and he will soon be returning to Chicago to help pack my belongings and have them shipped out here. I don’t actually have that many possessions that I want to keep. Mostly personal items. My apartment came with the furniture, so that doesn’t belong to me.”
“Perhaps another time, then. You’re always welcome. I can tell you more about the woman your aunt was.”
This was his own fault, opening the door to more personal topics. He shrugged one shoulder. “When I was at university, I took a course in languages, discovered I had an aptitude for it. And then I discovered the library at Oxford.” He’d been a shy, introverted American boy in a prestigious British school. The loneliness and homesickness never went away, until he discovered he could lose himself with the books.
“Yes… yes, I know. Dean and Sam have mentioned you. I… I am pleased to meet you, Sheriff. I am Castiel Novak.”
Castiel took the piece of paper the lawyer handed to him, and quickly reviewed it. There wasn’t the huge fortune that Michael and Luc had perhaps hoped for, which to his mind was a relief. It was still comfortable, and would be enough to provide for him for many years even if he had no other source of income. Perhaps the rest of his life, depending on what it cost to address the myriad issues that even he could see needed to be tended to with the house.
Jess was out mowing the front yard when he got there—now that the weather had aggressively welcomed spring, the grass was aggressively growing, too. She waved but finished the last strip of grass before turning off the motor. “Hey Dean,” she greeted him.
“Closed,” Cas informed him, eyes obediently shut. Dean took him by the hand, lacing their fingers together. Cas could feel the rapid flutter of Dean’s pulse against his own fingers. He didn’t quite understand why Dean should be nervous about this. Cas had watched the progression of the kitchen every step of the way, and delighted in the transformation.
He rolled over and sat up again, getting to his feet, knowing his face was flushed with mortification. “I’m sorry,” he apologized.
That evening, there was a soft, tentative knock on his door. That was weird. He lived in an apartment building with security. Granted it was rudimentary security compared to the palace, but still, it was security. He wasn’t expecting any visitors. Maybe it was just one of the kids in the complex, running around selling raffle tickets for some sport or another. Maybe girl scout cookies. He didn’t think it was the right time of year for girl scout cookies. Maybe chocolate bars? Those could come around any time of year. Ridiculously overpriced chocolate bars that weren’t even that good, but still, chocolate.
That goes a long way with the extended family as well. Some of the others might not approve, but they know better than to be vocal about it. No one wants to incur Grandmother’s wrath. She’s had almost a hundred years to master the art of politely freezing people out, and isn’t afraid to use it on family when they deserve it.
“You’re right, it’s not all that’s in the sauce. There is also basil, and oregano. A hint of beef broth that I made myself.”
“If I was smart I wouldn’t have bought all this stuff,” Gabriel complained. Castiel knew he didn’t mean it. He’d driven out to the general store and bought plenty of cleaning supplies — rags, cleansers for different surfaces, detergent, sponges, mops, dusters. Rubber gloves and face masks, just in case. And an extra-large box of heavy-duty trash bags.
He shrugged out of his coat and hung it on one of the hooks beside the door and waited to do the same for Dean.
He’d seen how wonderful the large windows overlooking the garden were, with the transom windows above the ones that opened to catch the breeze and let the fragrance of the flowers and grasses inside. He’d felt his heart swell the first time he stepped onto his new patio, imagining the table and chairs he’d add, the grill as well, perhaps a water feature nearby so that he could listen to the sound of falling water. He’d helped to muscle the new appliances in place, handing Dean his tools as he installed them.
He was so lost in the work that he didn’t hear the knock on the door, or even notice it opening wider, so he was startled when someone spoke, far too close.
Cas stared blankly at the stacked boxes for a moment, feeling overwhelmed. He reminded himself they were just boxes. He could do this. Steeling himself, he came forward to look at the first one. They weren’t labeled with anything other than the shipping labels. “I don’t see anything to distinguish one from another,” he whined, immediately embarrassed that such a noise had come out of his throat.
Castiel took it, feeling the weight and tooth of the paper. Cotton rag, he thought, and a high weight. He didn’t intend to open it quite yet. He would save that for a private time, when he didn’t know what impact it would have on him. “Thank you.”
“What?” Sam sounded, understandably, confused. “I thought you were going minimalist this year. Frozen turkey roast, pre-made pie, potatoes from a box.”
“Holy shit.” When Cas pulled his whole super-serious routine, it was just that. Super serious. There was no way he was going to crack and reveal anything he shouldn’t. “Okay… so what does that mean?”
“I was just noticing the picture on your bookcase. That’s a beautiful car.” She moved to the side and picked it up, using the tip of one perfectly manicured nail to tap at the photo of himself, Sam, and Baby. Bobby had taken it, the summer before Sam left for Stanford. It was one of Dean’s favorite photos. The lighting had been perfect, showing off Baby to her best advantage, and he and Sam looked happy.
Instead, Dean turned off the TV while the end credits were playing. “Want anything more before we call it and I take you home? Something to munch on or drink?”
After forever, and all too soon, Dean gently backs away, looking into Cas’ eyes. His pupils are wide and dark, his breathing uneven as well. Cas could almost convince himself that Dean is as affected as he is himself.
At first nothing happened, though Castiel thought he might be feeling some sort of a pressure at the base of his chest. Then again, it might be nothing more than his excitement.
Cas backed up into the shadowy space behind a potted wisteria, giving himself time to assess the situation.
The car door opened, and Gabriel dropped a white waxed bag onto his lap -- an overly stuffed bag. “I thought you were just getting us one thing apiece.”
Cas braced himself for tension that never came. That was surprising. “I felt that it was time, I suppose. I am still intending to visit the grocer, and then I will be ready to head back home. I had a conversation with Mildred.” He gestured back towards that store. “It seems that she remembers my previous visits to Caroline, though I was a child at the time.”
“Oh man, Cas, that’s not cool, dude. Not when your friend is a carpenter. Not cool. Tell you what. I can whip up something quick --  and don’t even start to say it. Bookshelves are easy as pie, man. Actually a lot easier than pie, because pie is hard.”
“They’re not really people. They’re aliens disguised as people who are vulnerable to sugar. It’s how you can identify them.”
That sounded so simple, but after years with Bartholomew, Cas was only just beginning to not react every time with surprise.
He’d barely looked around when the back door opened and another man – had to be Castiel – walked in. Dean couldn’t quite hold back the half smile of appreciation. Dude was hot. Dark hair that it looked like he’d tried to tame, but still stuck up here and there. Tall, fit. He and Gabe had very little in common as far as looks. And then the guy looked up and met his gaze, and holy hell, his eyes were
“Cas is in the market for a working car. He’s been relying on delivery, so it’s about time. Got anything promising?”
Cas turned his lemonade glass in his hands, remarkably fascinated by watching the bits of lemonade pulp swirl around. He glanced up at Dean through his lashes, then back down to the lemonade, and caught his lower lip between his teeth.
“Not like you’re planning on parading around the house in your jammies, are you?” Dean points out. His eyes are sparkling with amusement.
“Yes. Great Aunt Hester has a great deal of items to sort through. It will be a lengthy task to tackle it all. But this house is larger than I need for one person, so I am starting with the few rooms I actually need.”
“Copies of public records and notices are available at the library,” Sarah said politely. “You can look there.”
“It’s not an issue. I don’t want to keep you longer than you need to be. You’re putting in long days.”
He didn’t know how long he stood there before his muscles unlocked enough to allow movement and his mind retreated from the white haze of anger and sorrow. He was barely aware of the many discussions with police, museum security staff, and his colleagues. He repeated the same information over and over again. No, he didn’t know what happened. No, he had no idea who could have done such a thing. No, he didn’t know yet if anything was missing. Certainly it was nothing obvious at first glance, and everything was such a mess that he wouldn’t know for certain until he’d cleaned up – and perhaps not even then. He didn’t have an inventory written down of every book or paper that had been present at his office.
There was no way in hell that Dean was going to do that to him. He cared far too much about the guy for that. The whole friends with benefits thing could work, sometimes. But not with Cas. Cas was too emotionally fragile for that.
Castiel blinked owlishly, his thoughts racing as fast as his heartbeat. This was unexpected. Great Aunt Hester had left her estate to him? Why?
“Aye aye, sir.” He whipped out a casual little salute along with a grin, and headed back out to get the tools he’d need, humming tunelessly to himself.
that hit him was almost unbearable. Cas’ lips were so pink, and that sweater still looked so soft, so touchable.
After a certain amount of introductory material, the lawyer got to the meat of the terms of Great Aunt Hester’s will.
That was always guaranteed to get someone off to a good start. Dean grinned to himself as he noticed Sarah deliberately slowing her pace.
Castiel nodded. “The young man who was murdered. Of course I recall that. Murder is rare in Havenport. People have been talking about it quite a bit. It seems he was new to the area.”
“Because I’ve had personal experience with the results of bad relationships at the workplace. Not myself, but Amelia. My sister-in-law.”
He could see it. Still wasn’t the approach he’d take, but he could see it. More importantly, he could see why Cas was so passionate about it.
Dean’s apartment was small and a bit untidy, but not dirty. There was a difference between untidiness and uncleanliness. Besides, a spotless home was uncomfortable. Cas should know; he’d grown up in one, and then moved to another equally sterile and superficially perfect environment. The couch was upholstered in cinnamon brown upholstery, a flat screen TV took up substantial space across from it. Shelves beside the TV held a collection of DVDs and old-fashioned albums. A turntable to play the albums was near the television, along with a cassette deck.
“Ready to head out?” Dean asked, pulling out his wallet and tucking payment under the edge of his plate.
Bringing up this topic may have been a mistake. On the other hand, if he’s going to get a long weekend of pretending to be dating Castiel Shurley, Dean wants to get the full experience. He just doesn’t need Cas to realize he
He heard the occasional nailing and sawing and vacuum cleaner, along with various thumps and bumps — even the occasional curse — over the sound of the speakers playing classic rock at a volume loud enough to disguise most of the sounds. He could pull out the noise-cancelling headphones, but he found he actually liked those sounds, reminding him that Dean was there.
Great Aunt Hester had been a neat person, but she’d been elderly, and likely just didn’t have the stamina or the eyesight to clean properly any longer.
Cas doesn't outwardly react, though inwardly he feels unsettled and somehow lesser, which annoys him. They shouldn't have that kind of power over him. Appearances are sometimes important, yes, but they shouldn't matter so much for a family gathering. It's not like they showed up in torn jeans and stained tees. He's wearing a pair of khakis and a blue button-down shirt, and Dean is wearing his nicest pair of jeans, the black ones that fit him so beautifully, along with a forest green Henley that brings out the beautiful shade of his eyes.
“Hi, Charlie. I’m Dean, nice to meet you too.” He chose a chair beside her, on the window side of the table. He never liked having his back to the door if he could help it.
“Mm. I’m aware.” Cas chuckles. “Go to sleep, Dean. We have a busy day of hobnobbing at the Country Club ahead of us.”
Fuck, fuck. A small, rational part of his brain recognized that it had been a slash that barely connected, or else he’d already be dead, sliced clean in half.
He shifted, winced as his chest pulled. It didn’t hurt, exactly. More like he thought it should hurt, but there were drugs keeping the pain away. He opened his eyes, blinked twice while a face came down closer to him.
“Don’t envy you that. It’s a challenge at the best of times. You decide you want to hire someone to help with the cleaning let me know. I’ve got a few contacts, everything from a professional service to some local people who’d be willing to pick up some odd jobs for a bit of extra cash.”
Dean can tell that Cas wants to jump at the idea, but is fighting it. The guy hates to ask for help on anything, hates to accept help even when it’s freely offered.
He’d briefly considered not using that account at all, but realized that would make them wonder how he was paying his expenses, which might in turn lead them to Steven Emmanuel, and that? That he wanted very much to avoid.
Cas’ smile faded into thoughtfulness. How was he to answer that question? How could he choose a favorite? They were like his children, and you couldn't choose a favorite child. Or rather, you shouldn’t. People could and did.
“Don’t pull out your logic hat, bro. I’m sticking to my guns on this one. I’ll grab something for you, too.”
Cas is watching his father for his reaction, so he sees the slight widening of his blue eyes, followed by a pleased smile. “Dean?” Chuck says.
“It might,” Castiel agreed. “But honestly? I would rather fail at recovering the painting than have Walker succeed at destroying it.”
He’d ask his questions then, about what this Enoch River had to do with the painting the cute florist was so interested in.
“I am rather fond of watermelon myself. Thank you. Set it on the table? I’ll get a knife later to cut it up.
“No, not really. I’m making marinara sauce now. It needs to simmer on low for an hour or so. I thought I’d make some pasta while that’s happening.”
Dean and Cas are seated at a table on the edge of the pavilion while Cas’ grandmother presides over the luncheon in the center of the room, with Anna and her fiancé in the places of honor by her side. Anna is quite lovely, Dean thinks, though she seems weirdly fragile. Cas’ aunt Naomi is at her side, leaning over now and then to whisper something to her. Right afterwards, Anna always does something to correct her posture, fix her hair, rearrange her skirt, adjust the placement of her utensils at her place setting.
“You’re thinking,” Cas observed. Something about that look made him ache. The atmosphere was breathless, as though something were building just out of sight.
Dean nodded, rather proud of himself for not rolling his eyes, and stepped out of the command center.
Cas is a big-shot architect now, and has to wear suits to work whenever he’s meeting with important clients. When he doesn’t have to wear suits he still has to wear nice, business casual attire. Cas has plenty of wardrobe choices for the trip. Dean kind of hopes he brings that one designer tee, the blue one that fits him really well and brings out the color of his eyes.
“We are not here to discuss the remodel right now, though,” Cas said, squaring his shoulders, meeting Dean’s gaze across the table. “We are here to discuss last night.”
"Actually you do, Dean-o," Gabriel winked, then dug out two fresh drinks and passed one to his friend.
"You aren't going to murder me are you?" Castiel asked when Garth started walking down the stairs into the library basement, which earned a laugh from his new friend.
"Most likely, criminals often enjoy revisiting the scene of the crime, they take pleasure in seeing their work," Cas nodded. "Did you recognize his voice?"
“Sounded like he had it comin’,” Dean said, Jen eagerly agreed with him. “No one tells Joanna Beth what to do.”
“I just meant,” Dean scrubbed at a wet spot that didn’t exist on the plate, “you know what I meant," with a stern expression focused on his task.
“Oh!” Castiel said, pleasantly surprised. “i actually like that one!” He exclaimed with a smile, snatching it out of his brothers hands.
“Come on bro,” Gabriel exclaimed, putting the joint to his lips and inhaling deeply. “You guys aren’t fooling anyone.”
"Right," John nodded before the server arrived and deposited a plate of spaghetti and meatballs in front of him.
The two hurried back to the house, and Charlie opened the door just in time for them to come busting in, collapsing as soon as they reached safety. “Where’s Ruby?” Sam exclaimed. Dean and Cas panted heavily as they caught their breath. A blanket was placed over them as they remained on the floor, pants now getting wet from the snow melting off their boots and legs.
Once Castiel heard the door click shut behind Zachariah he muttered, “We’re not your kids,” before turning back to his book, staring at it for a while, too distracted to focus.
Castiel huffed out a laugh and peered into the mirror thoughtfully, “A doctor's coat and a stethoscope would suit me.”
Castiel had to hurry to the dining hall across campus if he wanted to meet Charlie for lunch on time. When he arrived to the dining hall Charlie was reading the flyers tacked to a bulletin board in the lobby.
The two hurried downstairs and found the group huddled around the kitchen table, the journal laying open in front of them.
“Relax, there’s no one down here but us,” Dean said into his ear, shivers ran throughout Castiel’s body as Dean’s hands moved down from his abdomen to his thighs, rubbing up and down as he gently nipped on Cas’ ear.
“Sh,” Dean covered his lips with his finger as he saw Charlie start to comment on the noise. Benny froze where he was on the ladder and looked to his friends for some indicator. Dean and Charlie began backing their way towards the path, keeping an eye on the clearing and Benny. After a minute or so of silence, Benny began his journey again down the ladder when his foot slipped and he cried out, falling a few feet until he managed to get a grip on the ladder again. Suddenly, a large, dark figure emerged from the woods on the other side of the clearing and bellowed the screeching noise they had just heard. Benny, still on the ladder, started to scramble back up it, but after seeing the movement, the creature lunged forward towards the tower. “Run,” Dean said to Charlie, who sprinted down the path, looking over her shoulder every so often to see if her friends were following. Dean started running back towards the ladder when the creature reached Benny. It was nearly as tall as he was high off the ground, and it’s jaws snapped loudly against the metal as he attempted to kick it away.
The two made their way downstairs and were greeted by the sound of cartoons playing on the television. Sam was on the couch, wrapped in a knitted blanket, and perked up at the sound of footsteps.
But maybe Charlie was right, as much as he didn’t want to think about not having Dean, it would make sense to talk about it, just as a precaution.
Dean Winchester had never been on a plane and terrified was an understatement. John had driven the family anywhere they needed to go in his beloved Impala. At the airport after a brief panic attack, Gabriel bought three tequila shots each- in part to get his and Castiel’s vacation started, but also to calm Dean’s nerves. After Dean slammed back the shots and took one of the pills Castiel offered, he boarded the plane with glazed over eyes, and fell asleep on Gabriel’s shoulder the second they settled in.
“How’s classes?” Dean adjusted the strap on his backpack as they started out the door behind the herd of other students eager to exit the lecture hall.
“Now that’s a game!” Ash agreed, extending his hand that was gripped around a beer and pointed his finger at Gabe.
Castiel turned to face Dean, his face twisted trying to decode this uncomfortable encounter. When he looked at Dean he noticed his face was red and he was shifting in his seat, clearly uncomfortable.
Castiel stared at Dean with a tilted head, concerned by the way Dean suddenly shut down when he mentioned Dr. Alastair. He wanted to push and find out why Dean did not want him to meet with his adviser. Not wanting to disturb the class, Castiel decided to keep quiet for now and talk to Dean after class.
“She’s right, we gotta go. Let’s run through the plan once more,” Dean said Castiel and Ruby, who agreed it couldn’t hurt.
As she and John prepared to leave for the Singer-Harvelle’s party she hovered in the living room doorway, “Dean, will you help me with the food?”
“Good!” She exclaimed before picking up where he left off with the eggs. “Because Jack is right, you’re practically his whole world. If you don’t have a serious talk about your relationship then you need to let him go because it’s fucking hard on him, Dean. You don’t see him when you’re away. All he does is talk about how he wants to make you proud,” she added milk to the eggs before pouring them into the sole frying pan.
Castiel sat next to his brother on his bed and they took turns passing the bag to each other. “So you have fun?” Gabriel asked, licking salt off his fingers.
“Yeah, and Thanksgiving. He's had enough bonding with my grandpa to last the rest of the year,” he said with a smirk and a small huff of a laugh.
"What are we doing tonight?" Jo asked, changing the subject, sick of listening to the guys talk about sex.
“It’s fucking lame!” Dean laughed, pushing himself off the ground. Jo laughed out loud when she got a better look at the van that had Gabe in stitches. It had a polar bear with a warrior woman riding it and another bear to the left.
“The RA put name tags on all the doors,” she said, rolling her eyes as if it were obvious. It was, but Dean wasn’t the most observant person in the world. “Really?” She asked, pointing to the poster Gabe hung up a few minutes ago. Gabriel opened the mini fridge he just stocked and pulled out three beers, passing them to his friends, still warm.
Castiel was more stressed than he had expected. All throughout high school he was a stellar student, but now in college even his AP courses seemed like child's play. Just about every one of his classes had papers due before Thanksgiving, and then final papers due only a couple weeks after that when the semester ended on top of exams. All semester he kept up with his studies, and was even ahead in a couple classes until all the deadlines came crashing down. Most of his spare time was spent in the library beside Garth or Charlie writing and writing and writing. On top of that he was sexually frustrated, he was checking Dean out every second he could. And he knew Dean was teasing him too.Gabriel kept leaving them alone as if he knew Castiel had the hots for his roommate and was pulling some cruel prank. Hell Castiel didn't even think Dean was into guys. He just couldn't do it anyone. Castiel needed a break.
“Dean,” John warned, “college is the start of your professional career. You better not be dragging the Winchester name through the mud. I worked hard to get where I am, and I expect the same effort from you.”
“Yes I know, darling,” Balthazar purred, his lips attaching to his glass, ember liquid sliding into his mouth.
Her expression dropped, clearly not being used to getting turned down. "What? You've got a girlfriend back home?"
“Where’s your room?” Dean asked, chugging his beer before continuing to unpack clothes and stuffing them in the dresser.
“We should do late night!” Dean exclaimed, excited at the thought of a grilled cheese and a milkshake.
Gabe disappeared after his friends paid the cover fee to enter the frat house. This came to no surprise to Dean; he was most likely going to find the keg. A girl standing near the door called Jo’s name and waved her over, leaving Dean and Castiel standing by the door.
"Jesus, Cas, it wasn't because of you. That weekend was just the tip of the iceberg. We would have broken up sooner or later."
"Gabe we'll split a Hawaiian, and you two get whatever you want," Jo said, tapping her foot impatiently on the tile floor as she motioned to Dean and Cas. She just wanted to get the decisions over with so they could eat already.
“We’ll be back soon,” Dean said, pulling gloves over his hands. “Everyone stay here. Don’t go anywhere,” he ordered rather seriously.
“You do everything he says, do you ever think for yourself? It’s always Dean this and Dean says that! When are you going to learn that just because he’s your whole world, it doesn’t mean you’re his!” Jack shouted before grabbing a random knitted hat and storming out the door.
“Nice to see you too bro,” Gabriel said sarcastically, since Castiel was apparently only greeting his partner.
“Right,” Sam said unconvinced, but dropped the subject when the tall blonde tenth grader Jessica Moore arrived. Dean had teased Sammy about his crush on Jess for years, but Sam insisted it wasn’t a crush to the point he tried to tackle Dean the last time he brought it up. Dean decided to leave him alone, not because he was scared of Sam, but because Jess was a nice girl and he secretly hoped Sammy would nut up and ask her out.
Castiel leaned forward and pointed to the picture of himself in a tuxedo sandwiched between a girl in a scarlet red gown, and another teenage boy in a white tux. He looked at the boutonniere and said, “It may be time to throw out the flowers.”
“No matter how many times you tell him, he’ll keep doing it. You’re too polite, Cassie,” Gabriel said from his bed, casually flipping through a magazine.
“You heard me! I’ve been trying to get you two chuckle-heads together since October!” He threw his hands in the air, off of the steering wheel.
“Yeah, ditto.” They remained in a pregnant pause, Castiel leaning against the fridge until Dean said, “Charlie says you guys haven’t been in school.”
“Uh, yeah. It’s not like we just stopped being friends with him because you two had to fight over my sister.”
“Dean!” Castiel said almost hushed, Dean’s arms wrapping around him, pulling him close so Castiel’s back was flush against Dean.
Castiel placed his backpack gently down on his desk when he returned to his room and emptied out his heavy textbooks before adding the empty mason jar he hid in his underwear drawer. After his very first encounter with his roommate Castiel was informed he would not tolerate any devious behavior, including smoking, so Cas felt the need to hide his stash where his roommate would not find (or smell) it. Castiel donned his backpack once again and locked the door behind him, unsure when his roommate would return, and knowing he certainly would not be back anytime soon.
Sam continued to looks disgusted, staring at his pizza as if it was covered in mold, “Thanks Jo, now I can’t get that image out of my head,” he murmured, pushing the plate away from him.
"Cas?" Dean asked, hoping Castiel would agree to meat lovers, because Dean would prefer to eat Gabe's Hawaiian over pepper and onion, it at least had meat on it.
The figure behind him barricaded the front door as Sam exclaimed, “Dad!” rushing to his father’s side. John Winchester wrapped his arms around Sam and exhaled loudly in Sam’s hair. “Where’s your brother?”
“Come on!” Dean exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air, incredibly annoyed that Sam bothered him until he got out of bed, then just took off. He turned around and Cas was running a hand through his messy hair.
The two boys sat in silence for a while, neither really sure of what to say next. Their silence was interrupted by Gabriel entering the room. He stopped and looked at the two on Dean's bed briefly, then sat down at his desk and started rifling through his stack of papers.
“Stay back, Dean!” Benny called, seeing Dean running towards him. “Help the others!” Dean stopped in his tracks and saw a flash of red before Benny was no longer on the ladder, but in the arms of the creature. Benny was thrashing wildly, the creature began to back off, it saw Dean and opened its mouth to loud out a shriek, then ran on it’s long two legs back where it had come from. “Benny!” Dean screamed, attempting to follow the two, but once it ran off into the forest Dean was unable to see where it went. His mind shifted to Charlie and sprinted as fast as he could down the path, the weight of the fire axe slowing him down. As he re-entered the woods he skidded in the snow, calling out his friend's name. When he reached a split in the path he slowed down, Charlie was sitting on a rock, shivering, appearing to have been waiting.
"Seems a little fancy for a couple of college kids," John observed after taking in the outside of the building.
“Uh, personal space, Cas,” Dean coughed uncomfortably, nodding to his roommate and raising his eyebrows as if to say
“I wouldn’t say we’re friends, we’ve smoked a couple times together that’s all. Actually, Dean, I think you met him at Hope's party. Remember Andy?”
“That would ruin the surprise, wouldn’t it?” Cas said as he began to tug at Dean’s pants and pressing desperate kisses to anywhere on Dean’s body that his lips could find. Dean brought his hand to palm Castiel through his boxer briefs, causing Cas’ hips to buck up into his hand. “Take those off,” Cas whined as Dean quickly pulled down his own boxers.
“You really think he’d come to the house for a weekend with his favorite brother?” Michael asked, then when Gabriel didn't answer he asked, “You're that desperate huh?”
“Wouldn’t you if you had barely any parental supervision and a condo on the beach to yourself?” Dean said, trying not to sound jealous.
When Dean was snapped back to reality he glanced at his clock on his desk and jumped off the bed, "Shit, I've gotta get ready for work." Dean grabbed his towel off the back of his desk chair and snatched his shampoo and bar of soap from the closet.
"I'm actually going to get started on it now. I will see you tonight," Castiel said as they exited the dining hall and went their separate ways, waving at each other.
In the couple weeks following his conversation with Charlie, Castiel could not get what she said out of his mind.
“What’s wrong? Sad your boyfriend’s gone?” Same quipped after noticing Dean had just passed a channel with a women’s swimwear ad without pausing to check out the models as he usually did.
Dean laughed, “I’m just teasing, Cas,” he approached Cas and leaned in close to him, his breath heavy on his ear, “So what did you get that goes in there?”
Bobby sighed before instructing everyone to go have a seat. “Now, my family’s been livin’ on this mountain for generations. There’s something,” he paused, “evil that lives here. We don’t know much other than it eats people.”
Castiel nervously sipped on his beer and locked eyes with the man when he settled on a spot and leaned against the wooden railing. The joint made its way back to Castiel, and he happily accepted it, turning his attention away from the man.
"Dean. I'm sorry I didn't have time to introduce you two. When he's hungry he's on a mission," Cas chuckled before turning his head back again, this time Dean was long gone.
he thought before pushing through the crowd to them. Dean inched away form Castiel as much as he could (which was not much) when he saw Gabe approaching them.
“Oh my God!” Dean exclaimed, he was sick of hearing about this room that Gabriel was dead set on claiming.
Castiel knocked on Dean and Gabriel’s door shortly before lunch started. Dean answered the door and let him in, avoiding his gaze.
Yup, Castiel was definitely one of those Earthy-crunchy-hippies, Dean thought, as if the sandals the guy was wearing didn’t already give that away.
A knock on his door caused him to shoot out of his chair and answer the door in record time. Castiel stood before him in his trench coat, his hand still raised to the door.
Castiel was quiet for a moment before he resumed going through Bobby's bookshelf, hoping to find a map of the mountain or the abandoned mines that were rumored to be on the other side of the mountain. Dean stared at the back of Cas' head, not saying anything until someone downstairs shouted their names. "We found something!"
“Tall, skinny, head like a horse’s skull,” Charlie said emotionlessly, staring directly into the fire.
Dean dug into his pocket until he produced a lighter and flicked it on just below the door’s lever, hoping this would help it open. After a minute and it cooled down enough for Dean to touch the lever, it budged slightly but wouldn’t open past an inch, something inside likely jamming it shut. “Gimme the poker,” Dean said, extending his arm out to Benny, who placed the fireplace poker in Dean’s hand. Dean shoved the pointed end in the inch gap and used all his might to pry it open. Thankfully, the door opened, slamming into the wall and startling Charlie. Since she was startled, she stood up and began helping Dean search the room as Benny managed to finally get some noise in the radio; static, but it was a start.
Everyone was armed with a drink and a backup one, knowing they likely would have to open it sooner than later. Jack, who didn’t like alcohol, had a couple sodas that Charlie brought as mixers. “Alright, bitches, let’s get drunk!” Charlie announced and pulled the first card. The game began, but only lasted a couple rounds before someone brought up Jo and Ash. Benny got up from the circle and stormed off, slamming the bathroom door behind him. Dean snorted, and called “Good riddance, nobody wanted you here anyway,” after him.
They made it to the outskirts of campus, and saw a flock of people walking in the opposite direction, on their way out. “Shit,” Cas mumbled as they approached Dean’s building, he was patting his pockets.
he thought before he took off up the stairs to his bedroom. As he was picking dirty laundry off the floor Mary appeared in the doorway, amused by how suddenly motivated her oldest was to clean his room. She had never seen him that motivated to clean anything, not even the impala.
"What's with the attitude man?" Gabe asked before he hoisted himself up onto the small space of counter top that was clear of bottles and cups.
“Well thanks for fitting me into your busy schedule,” Crowley said sarcastically, gently swirling his glass, his dark eyes boring into Castiel.
Dean, still under his blanket grumbled with frustration and sat up slightly to fluff his pillow a little more aggressively than he anticipated.
Dean shouted something to Castiel, but over Adam talking, the music and nearby conversations, Castiel missed what he said. He figured it wasn't too important because a moment later Dean was going towards the direction of the kitchen, he didn’t wait for Cas to respond.
When Gabriel returned in the morning there was no sock on the door, but he was pleased to see Dean and Castiel had apparently fallen asleep in Dean’s bed, both still somewhat clad in their costumes- only from the waist down. He shut the door a little louder than normal on purpose, waking his brother out of his light sleep.
Jo was picked up by Ash the day before; Ash was pretty resistant to return to the Harvelle-Singer household when he went to get her, he tried to convince her to let him spend a night at the dorm; he said he needed a break from their parents. Jo just shot her step brother a glare and crossed her arms, then next minute they were in his car on their way home.
Castiel wasn’t surprised, Richard Roman was the student body president, the best quarterback Lawrence High had ever seen, and picking on Cas was one of his favorite past times. “How do you know?”
"Castiel will be living it up in paradise while the rest of us are slumming it in Kansas," Dean chuckled, squeezing him slightly.
Hi everyone sorry for the wait for the update, I've been sick and haven't had the motivation to write. Hopefully I will have more time this week. Thanks for reading!
Castiel downed his drink and shrugged, “Then I’ll go get us a couple,” he sauntered back towards the keg through the crowded living space, leaving his friends behind looking confused.
Dean’s mother Mary just left his dorm with tears in her eyes, telling him how proud she is of him. Dean ushered her out of his dorm, claiming he had work soon, but in reality he just didn’t want to see her cry again. She cried for the second time today as they loaded up the car with his belongings this morning. Dean hugged his mother and she rubbed his back, squeezing him just a little tighter before she let go and he kissed her cheek. She said a tearful goodbye before turning away to head back to her car.
“Yeah, Dean it’s really not your fault. It was stupid to think you guys could really handle it on your own. We need to stay here until help arrives, or at least until the sun comes up,” Charlie said, worry written all over her face.
“Yes, I don’t think he will be awake anytime soon,” Castiel placed the ham in the sandwiches and held one out to his brother. “I haven’t seen Michael,” he said before taking a bite.
Jen took a drag from the cigarette between her lips and said, “Yeah, figures,” she rolled her eyes, “the cute ones are always assholes.”
“So this is our las’ night before you go home,” Dean said, his hands wrapping around Cas’s hips, lacing his fingers around his back when they finally closed the door to Dean’s bedroom, leaving them alone.
"Bring your homework or a book because it can be pretty boring, I like to get some reading in," she patted a copy of Lord of the Rings on the desk.
At the kitchen table Castiel grinned over his plate of half-eaten apple pie. Dean laughed before coughing, choking on the crumbly crust. Mary smiled to herself as she wrapped up the rest of the uneaten pie, it had been a long time since she had seen Dean this happy. Dean sipped on a glass of water to wash down the pie lodged in his throat.
Castiel suddenly jumped out of his seat, and exclaimed, “Let’s dance, shall we?” to his roommate. He took a long sip from his straw, only leaving behind ice in the glass. "Doesn't this song make you want to dance?"
Dean gasped as he felt Castiel bottom out inside him, dropping his head. The younger boy paused for a moment, letting Dean adjust to the size before he began to slowly pull out, then push back in. “Cas,” Dean moaned, finally getting to feel Castiel inside him, after all these months of wanting and wondering, he finally had the real thing.
"Yeah, you know how girls are." Castiel absolutely did not know what he meant, and Dean was fully aware of his best friend’s continuous lack of girlfriends, but he didn’t want to get into it.
After the two left, Ash took a long sip of his soda before he said, “I didn’t want to say anything in front of them, but I got us these,” Ash pulled out his wallet and slid a card across the table to Dean.
“Gabe, let’s go sign up for the tournament,” Dean said after chugging the rest of his beer, partly to get away from Michael and also wanting a distraction from wishing Cas was there.
Not even a minute after Gabriel exited his room Dean’s lips were on Castiel’s, kissing him feverishly. Castiel pulled away briefly, hating breaking the kiss but needing to say, “Maybe we should lock the door this time.”
When Dean exited the bathroom he heard how awful the music playing was and decided to check out the old  jukebox just a few feet away from the restrooms. They had to have some Led Zeppelin or at least ACDC. While he browsed through the album's he saw a blue and red reflection out of the corner of his eye, but ignored it and continued to browse. Dean settled on a song and began to make his way outside to meet his friends.
Charlie wrapped the scarf she found around Ruby’s neck to add an extra layer of protection from the storm before saluting her. Dean picked up the blow torch that Charlie found out in the wood shed, and Castiel placed a bottle of lighter fluid in his largest pocket. Ruby was armed with a fireplace poker, and Cas tucked a butcher knife into his belt loop, just in case.
“Now,” Castiel said, hating to pull away from Dean for even a second, but desperate to get their clothes off. He led him upstairs and once the door was closed behind them, Dean dropped his duffle bag and found himself immediately pressed up against the closed door, feeling the soft, damp towel hanging on the door against his back. Castiel pushed his body against Dean’s so they were flush, feeling that Dean was nearly as hard as he was. It had been a long time since they were alone like this, all summer their date typically consisted of time in public, or rushing to have sex before Zachariah got home from work. Dean pushed forward so he was no longer leaning against the door, and quickly removed Castiel’s shirt before backing him into the bed, the two falling onto it with Dean straddling Cas.
Sam trudged upstairs with his signature bitch face, annoyed that Dean hadn't come back to finish their game. He found Dean in the upstairs hallway, fumbling around in the linen closet. Sam leaned against the wall with his arms crossed and a sour puss face. “I thought you said you'd be right back.”
"See you!" Cas shouted after him, then Dean broke their eye contact and hurried off towards the dining hall.
By the time the three finished lunch and went back to their rooms Gabriel was back and laying on his bed messing with his camera. “Cassie was disappointed you weren’t here.”
Gabriel groaned loudly as he made his way to the door and opened it to reveal Chuck standing with his arms crossed over his chest.
“Yeah I got that from the talk with Gabe. But um,” Dean cleared his throat, “I meant, are you like together?”
Dean snapped out of his trace of watching Cas and turned his attention to his treat. “You have a little,” Cas motioned to just under his lips when Dean finished his fried dough and had sugar on his chin. Dean licked around his lips, attempting to clean it off but was missing. “Here, I’ll get it,” Castiel cupped Dean’s chin and gently wiped the sugar off of his lower lip, his finger running along his lip, making Dean look up at him with lust in his eyes and a small groan when Cas pulled away.
Dean approached the door to the apartment and knocked loudly, shifting impatiently as he waited for the door to be answered. It was swung open by a disheveled guy, his shirt inside out as if he just threw it on in a hurry, “What's the damage?” He asked in a British accent, huffing like he was out of breath.
Dean and Cas pulled apart, Dean’s cheeks were flushed, his lips plump from the kiss. Castiel licked his, his blue eyes making contact with Dean’s, as if to ask him if he was sure. “Cas, I-”
“No way, we’re waiting for my dad and Bobby to get back here before we leave. Who knows if it’ll come back,” Dean said sternly.
Back at the cabin, as the first light of dawn appeared, Jack jumped up and hurried to pull on a jacket. Castiel stood up and asked, “Where do you think you’re going?”
After waiting a few minutes so as not to raise suspicion, Jo and Charlie re-entered the party and went in search of Dean and Castiel. When they found the two, they were once again dancing closer than necessary, by now most of the bottle was gone and they didn’t care to separate when Jo and Charlie came over.
Castiel reached around the back of Dean’s head and grabbed him by the hair on his nape, dragging him in for more.
Castiel shook his head no and said, “Unless you want to eat a peanut butter sandwich at 10, then no.”
"That's Lily," Benny said, nodding to the girl who was twirling a strand of her hair around her finger and looking at Cas with doe eyes. "She likes your friend."
“I had lunch with Benny and Jo. Is he in his room?” Dean paused, and decided not to take off his jacket, but instead leave again once Gabe nodded his head and confirmed that his brother went back to his room.
“You still owe me a drink,” Dean teased, pushing his lips closer so they ever so slightly brushed just below Castiel’s ear.
“Dude, she’s not my type. We’re friends, I uh,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck and licked his lips nervously, “kind of had a hunch the person who keyed my car was one of those football assholes, so I might have flirted with Lisa to get information,” Dean spoke lower as he reached the end of his sentence, his voice trailing off, clearly ashamed that he had lead Lisa on to get information.
Jess and Kevin decided to watch before they made the commitment to play, but Sam joined in after Ash explained the rules, wanting to show his brother he’s grown up and can handle it.
When he reached his dorm Castiel closed the door to his room and leaned against it, attempting to steady his breathing with closed eyes.
Castiel nodded, “I’ve always thought the piano was a beautiful instrument, one of my brothers used to play- I was always jealous. I’m looking forward to learning myself.”
“It’s okay,” Dean instantly scooted lower on the bed and settled on his knees in between Castiel’s legs, grabbing him around the base of his cock before taking him into his mouth, looking up at Cas just in time to see his eyes flutter shut and his mouth open with a low moan.
The two stood up and made their way back inside. "I need to tell my friends I'm leaving," Castiel said, going up on his toes to ensure Tony heard him.
“Yeah, I mean he’s a huge dork and all, but,” Dean grabbed the open bag of chips sitting on his roommates desk. “He’s cool, cracks me up,” he said as he crammed his mouth with potato chips.
“Mary isn’t going to be pleased,” he observed as the shower upstairs turned on, Sam likely washing the sand out of places it should never be.
“So, Castiel, what do you think so far? Of the school I mean,” Jo asked, trying to get off the topic of pizza, knowing Dean could spend hours talking about food.
“Happens all the time,” Castiel said. The two started walking in the direction of the elevator. “I didn't know we lived in the same floor.”
“Yes I've seen it around,” Castiel chuckled, thinking about how Gabriel points it out every time they see it. “You can't miss it.”
“What?” Ruby pointed ahead but all they could see was an old wooden bridge that had missing planks, they had come to the edge of a cliff.
“Dean,” she said again, causing him to turn and look at her, “if there's any,” she paused, “funny business-”
Castiel laughed quietly, “Cat’s outta the bag,” before he pulled Dean in for a kiss. He cupped his hand under Dean’s chin and hummed happily into the kiss, making Dean moan from the sensation on his lips, opening them just enough so Cas could easily slide his tongue into his mouth. The hands around Cas’s back slipped lower, caressing his ass and pulling him in closer. When they pulled away for air Dean took the opportunity to explore Cas’s neck, his lips sloppily kissed down his chin, over his Adam’s apple and made their way to Castiel’s ear, sucking on the lobe. Castiel closed his eyes and gasped at the sensation, Dean giving his ear a curious nip before Cas’s hands gripped tighter into Dean’s shirt that he wanted off now.
"No, just a desk, chair and some scattered papers," Sam said, pulling away from the window, satisfied that Anna was not in the lodge.
Dean chuckled, Castiel shook his head with disbelief as the two got up from their usual spot in front of the fountain at the center of the mall. Dean didn’t used to understand why Cas liked that spot so much, everyone who entered the mall could see you from that position, but he supposed that was also why Cas liked it so much- he loved people watching. In fact, over the years of their friendship it was slowly becoming Dean’s favorite spot as well. Cas would perch himself on the edge of the fountain and cross his legs for balance. He used to sit poised and quiet, observing those who walked by as he slowly chewed on a pretzel with spicy mustard from his favorite kiosk. Now, when Castiel sits at the fountain, he usually is laughing so hard his body is threatening to toss him backwards into the fountain, his pretzel often landing in the water with a sad stare. Dean always bought him a new pretzel, it was the least he could do, after all he was the cause of the fits of laughter. Today, Castiel had eaten his entire pretzel before they even sat down- the girl at the counter was new and burned Dean’s pretzel three times. Their food was comped by the manager, not that they cared. Castiel didn’t have a care in the world, his eyes pricked with tears when the cashier burned the second pretzel, but when she informed Dean she burned the third pretzel, Deans eyes bulged out of his head like a cartoon character and Castiel was wheezing.
Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on who you ask) almost every club in Miami changed their policy to 18+ for the couple weeks that spring break fell on. Most college students were under 21, and these clubs knew there was a massive market for 18-20 year olds dying to let loose. Dean still had the fake ID Ash made him, but since Castiel didn’t have one, the four had to go to an 18+ club. Michael and Gabe said he was lucky for this, but Castiel just rolled his eyes and allowed himself to be dragged out- or eagerly followed Dean out the door after a few shots.
Back at the house, Ruby and Sam had ventured into another room, leaving Castiel and Jack in the main living space ignoring what the other two were likely up to. The cousins were silent as Castiel began picking up the discarded mugs his friends had left behind. He busied himself with the dishes, needing any distraction he could take. Jack stared out the window, he reminded Castiel of the family dog watching out the window for any movement in the yard. The image nearly comforted Cas, but he was snapped back to reality when his soapy hands dropped a mug in the sink and it cracked. He cringed and inspected the damage, then breathed a sigh of relief when he realized it was only a chip because the mug was one that looked special, with World’s Best Mom painted in child-like handwriting, realizing it had probably been gifted to Ellen from Jo or Ash when they were young. He dried it with caution and tenderly placed it back in the cabinet where the other mugs were kept. By the time he finished the dishes he decided to sit down with his cousin, who was still staring out the window. Castiel sat so he could easily see outside if he wanted to and asked, “See anything?”
The three finished off the rest of the beer in the fridge and left Dean’s bottle of rum alone, knowing the fraternity always had a fully stocked house. They decided after they finished the beers that they were sufficiently buzzed enough to head to the party a couple blocks off campus. It was late August, and Dean was feeling warm from the booze so he left behind his signature leather jacket.
Dean wasn't surprised to find the house completely quiet when he unlocked the door, his parents both at work. He kicked off his boots next to the giant clown sized sneakers that could only belong to Sam before he trotted up the stairs to his room. Dean dropped his duffel bags and laundry basket on the floor before falling face first into his bed, exhausted after another semester.
“Mom’s gone you don’t need to keep up the innocent act,” Dean said with a wink when the elevator dinged and the doors opened. As they exited the girls waiting for the elevator smiled at Sam and gave a flirtatious wave. Sam just threw a small smile back at the girls before the door shut. Dean whistled and turned his head to nod at the metal door before smacking Sam in the chest, “Already have college girls checkin’ you out.”
They approached the dorm and went upstairs so Ash could put his things down before gathering Gabe and Cas for dinner. Gabe was sitting at his desk, fiddling with his camera when the three walked in.
"Come on, Cas," Dean groaned, rubbing his face. Castiel laughed, as did Sam, which received a glare from the oldest Winchester sibling.
Castiel sighed as he sunk into the couch, the cordless phone pressed between his ear and shoulder, "I do, I miss you very much."
“It’s okay, it was a great day. I’m glad I kept the ticket, it reminds me of her. She wasn’t so sure it would be appropriate for Gabriel and I, but she laughed so hard. I had never seen her laugh like that before.”
On their walk back to campus Castiel started humming a tune, which Dean recognized instantly and began singing along to. Castiel draped his arm around Dean not only to help hold himself up, but to get closer to his friend as he hummed and Dean sang drunkenly.
"I thought you'd never ask," Castiel said before pushing forward, grabbing Dean by the front of his shirt and pulling their mouths together.
"Dean, I know you're allergic to feelings or whatever," Castiel said, "but we've known each other since we were kids. You can tell me."
Gabriel grabbed his pencil and tossed it at Dean, hitting him in the back of the head. “Don’t hang out with him too much, you’ll corrupt him.”
After kissing for a few more minutes, Dean couldn’t take it anymore, he needed more contact. He needed Cas. He pulled away and sat up to pull open the drawer on his nightstand, silently praying that there would be lubricant. He shut the drawer, disappointed and rubbed the back of his neck, “Any chance you brought lube?” He asked quietly.
Dean took the stairs up to his room, the elevator line was wrapping around to the front door. He took his time because there were many students trying to lug all their belongings up to their rooms, avoiding the elevator just like Dean. When he finally reached the sixth floor and made his way back to his room Gabriel was there and hanging up a poster of a scantily clad woman leaning over a classic car.
“Dean!” Jack exclaimed with a smile so exuberant, Dean knew the kid must have missed him while he was away at school. Dean pulled Jack into a hug first, patting him on the back with a “Hey, kid,” that he knew Jack would detest.
“Yeah, I- I saw you on his couch in your underwear, and you looked,” Dean trailed off, his mind wandering back to the memory of Castiel nearly nude.
Gabriel had finished complaining about losing “Beginner’s luck,” and noticed his brother was completely silent, staring at Dean bent over. Gabe wasn't even sure his brother was breathing because he was that still, that focused on Dean. He turned away quickly, feeling like he was invading Castiel's space, despite Castiel visibly checking out his best friend right in front of him.
“Dean, you don’t need to defend my honor now tha-” Castiel was about to say now that we’re together, but stopped himself just in time, unsure if Dean wanted Benny and Andy to know.
Dean paused a moment, debating, before he moved his lips against Castiel’s skin, “As much as I want to- and I
“Yes that is fine,” Castiel said before following Dean up the stairs to the second floor. “I appreciate you and your family letting me stay here so last minute.”
As the three climbed the metal ladder to the top, a shriek came from beyond the trees, so loud Charlie nearly missed a step and gripped onto the ladder so tight her face was pressed against the ice cold metal. “What the fuck was that?”
“No, he’s in class. We can get lunch though,” Dean said before rummaging around in a drawer for socks.
Without the sound of his alarm clock, Castiel woke slowly, his mind lagging and still attempting to process whether his dream was real or not. He finally opened his eyes as the sun began to warm his exposed arms and as visions of Ruby’s smiling face faded he rubbed his face back into the pillow; not wanting to come back to the reality without her.
"There's gotta be somewhere on the mountain that gets service, it can't all be a dead zone, right?" Benny suggested.
“We need to call the police to look for Anna and Ruby,” Bobby said, despite knowing that it was probably too late for a positive resolution for the two teens. “You kids get back to your cars and call the police the second you get bars,” he said to no one in particular.
“Why are you so obsessed with this room?” Charlie asked, she had heard Gabe mention room 210 on a couple of occasions.
Castiel sighed and picked up the dessert menu off the table, “It’s required. I can understand why, it’s important to understand how humans develop but I’m just not interested in learning about children and adolescents.” He placed it back on the table, not interested.
- plans could go horribly wrong. Each student was assigned a random number that decided the order of room selection, and the larger the number, the later they would be able to choose their room. The guys figured their chances of getting a suite together was greater since there were more of them, and thus more likely for someone to get a low number and reserve a room with enough space for all of them.
Dean smirked and grabbed the list again, "I think we have time for both." Castiel looked at him with an expression that could best be described as confused and fearful. "Relax," Dean soothed, placing his hands around Castiel's hips, "coffee first," he placed a soft kiss on his cheek and pulled away to see Cas staring at him with a small smile on his face. "Unless you'd rather shower first?"
“Do you?” Benny asked as if he was challenging Dean. Dean bent down and pulled up his pant leg to reveal the handle of a knife sticking out of his sock.
Dean sighed, mentally noting it took him longer to bring up Dean's ex-girlfriend than he anticipated. "Do we have to do this?"
It had been two months since Gabriel first introduced his brother to Dean, and in those two months Dean and Castiel were consistently eye-fucking each other every chance they got, regardless who they were with. Gabriel had had enough of the not-so-secret glances and affectionate touches; Dean and Castiel clearly didn’t care that they made everyone else uncomfortable around the sexual tension. It was time something was done about their obvious feelings about each other, but Gabriel knew they were both so stubborn it would never happen without a little push. However, there was no way he could accomplish this on his own.
Gabe looked between his brother with his messy hair and small red marks on his neck, and Dean who looked like a deer in the headlights, his pants unbuttoned. “What’s uh, goin’ on here?” Gabe asked wearily, wagging his fingers between the two younger guys.
When Dean returned Benny's pizzas were done and waiting to be eaten, "Thanks," Benny said as Dean handed him the two pies. "When you're out come by to Hope's, her brother is in town for the weekend, it's gonna be wild," he waved to Dean before hurrying out of the store to get the pizzas back while they're still hot.
“He hasn’t, but you two seem really close. Like the way Jess and I are. And the way he talks about, he really likes you. You’re important to him.”
“Hey, you might have a chance at that prize,” Dean said to Castiel, leaning in to his ear while obviously looking up and down Cas's body to check out his firefighter costume that consisted of pants with suspenders over a tight white tank top.
“I’m sorry, I should get ready, I probably need a shower,” Cas said as he sat up, his chest flushed and sticky.
“Oh, I am so in!” Dean exclaimed, ready to have some adult-ish fun after spending the past two months with his teenage brother, only occasionally hanging out with Jo and Ash when Ellen wasn’t working those two to the bone.
"Maybe," Charlie said, flipping through it more, the pages whirring. "November 11, 1914- it's back. By God I was sure we took care of it. November 23, I saw it for the first time today! I was fetching water at the stream and it was across the bank. It stood nearly twice my height, with antlers and an odor like death. I ran back without water and I could hear it shrieking behind me."
“Wait ‘til you try my pizza, you’ll never eat that crap again,” Dean broke his gaze and his eyes darted to his hands, wiping them together excitedly.
Dean pulled his friend into a hug and squeezed gently, their heads resting against each other, Cas couldn’t help but inhale some of Dean’s scent, his nostrils filling with the smell of old leather from his jacket. “I’m so sorry Cas,” Dean said, his voice cracking. “I hope you’ll forgive me, but I understand if you don’t,” he said, pulling away from their embrace.
“You were injured because of my actions,” he pulled the paper towel away, satisfied that the wound was no longer bleeding. “Perhaps I overreacted when I saw blood,” he discarded the paper towel and washed his hands.
Castiel laughed as Gabriel’s expression hardened and he continued to glare at not just his roommate, but also at the youngest Winchester. “I thought he was supposed to be the nice one,” Gabe said.
He only felt Dean’s mouth for a brief second because Dean pulled off just enough to ask, “You want me to fuck you?”
“I- I uh,” Castiel nervously looked away from his brother and suddenly became focused on the apple in his hand.
“Guess we will have to do this without her,” Dean shrugged before Gabe cackled loudly and the two took off. “Man, this is a tradition or something,” he said a few minutes later as he admired his handful of name tags they had ripped from people's doors.
“He, this thing, gone!” Dean said, huffing as Castiel gently guided him to in front of the fireplace.
Dean dropped his backpack next to his feet and settled into a desk in his architecture design class. When professor Jody Mills walked in Dean sat up a little straighter, knowing she would tell his father if he’s slacking off in class. She smiled at Dean before saying hello to a couple girls walking in the door. Despite knowing professor Mills for almost his entire life, Dean felt fairly anxious being in her class, knowing he needed to work harder than other students to earn her respect as an academic.
By the time Dean's last exam finished, he already had his car packed and ready to go and he was homeward bound for the next month. He was incredibly happy to be going home and spending time with his family, especially Sammy. The five days off for Thanksgiving was not enough time for the brothers, and Dean couldn't help but feel guilty seeing Sam's kicked puppy face when he drove back to his dorm for the last couple weeks of the semester. But now he had a month of time to hang with his brother- if Sam wasn't too embarrassed to be caught spending time with his brother. Dean was looking forward to using his extra time to help out Bobby at the garage and earn some money that didn't have the stench of pizza grease all over it. He felt content just thinking about sitting at the kitchen table, telling his mom about Cas while she baked fresh bread and pie.
The boys were greeted after they kicked off their shoes and walked into the main living space where they could hear music playing and their friends were chatting. At a quick first glance, Dean got a scan of the room to assess who was there- everyone seemed to be accounted for. “I think you and Benny should talk,” Charlie immediately said, jumping up and grabbing Dean’s arm, the cup in her hand sloshing around a sweet-smelling drink.
“No worries,” Dean flicked his hand in the air, getting sticky from the wine. “Why don’t you get these shorts off me?” He asked with a smirk playing on his lips. Castiel gazed at him with lust filled eyes and followed Dean, who was almost inside. “Bring the bottle!” Dean shouted from the bedroom as Castiel entered the condo. He obliged and retrieved the open bottle from the kitchen before heading towards the bedroom.
"Sam said the lift broke down. What the hell is going on?" She pressed her hands into her face and exhaled loudly.
Castiel nodded eagerly before following Dean out the back door onto a small porch. “Thank you, Dean.” He sat down on a step and ran his hands through his messy black hair, Dean couldn’t help but notice he made his hair look even more messy. Castiel’s hair was naturally messy and uncontrollable so he tended to just let it be and not fuss over fixing it. Castiel pulled the other joint he had rolled out of his pocket and brought it to his lips while he dug around his pockets for his lighter.
“Mom's at work, can you make pancakes?” Sam asked his brother, turning around to face the older boys.
“What? No!” Castiel got closer and upon further inspection he realized that it did in fact have the word scratched into the drivers side. “Dean, I-” Castiel started speaking but found he was speechless, he really had no idea what to say.
,” Jo rolled her eyes, “Anyway, he was madly in love with her. After almost three years of flirting and chasing after her, she finally agreed to go on a date with him and they were inseparable since. Cutest couple in the yearbook, homecoming, prom king and queen, all that crap,” Jo said with a sour face. “Well right after graduation at a party he caught her in bed with his friend from soccer Victor. Apparently her and Victor had been sleeping together almost the whole time Dean and her were together,” she shook her head, “It really killed Dean, he hasn’t been the same since.”
Castiel nodded eagerly and Dean took one hand off the steering wheel to hold Cas' hand while he drove them to the nearest drive through.
“See ya,” Gabriel said, still not looking up, his mouth now full of chocolate, too high to care about anything other than candy and swim suit models.
“I’ll meet you guys there,” Gabriel said as he closed the door behind them. “Told Cassie I’d show him around. Save us seats.”
Dean plopped into a seat in his history class next to Castiel, who already had his notebook opened to a fresh page and his textbook dutifully waiting beside it. "Hey Cas, get your appointment squared away?"
"I'm very sorry, I should have been paying attention," Castiel said, noticing his coffee all over his hand and on Garth's jacket.
Sam appeared at Dean’s side, barreling into him and burying his face in his older brother’s chest. Dean just wrapped an arm around his baby brother, squeezing him. He made eye contact with Charlie, whose eyes were red and puffy, she sniffled as she slowly made her way over to Dean, where he wrapped his other arm around her. John appeared and stood by silently, allowing his sons and Charlie to hold each other for a moment before placing a hand on Dean’s shoulder, a warmth radiating from him that Dean had never felt before. “The head ranger will give us a ride to the Impala, let's go home.”
“Thank you,” Castiel mumbled, resisting the urge to bury his face into Dean’s leather jacket, warm from the older boy’s body heat.
“If my biggest flaw is being too polite, then I’m alright with that,” he said as he shrugged off his trench coat and backpack, placing them over the back of Dean’s desk chair. “Dean, are you feeling ready for our exam?”
“Dean, you left your toothbrush on the sink,” Castiel said, nearing the bedroom before stopping just before Michael. Michael moved out of his way so Cas could enter the room and pass the toothbrush off to Dean as if it were a baton in a relay race.
“Sorry, it’s been a while since I-” Castiel said, trailing off at the end of his sentence, feeling a sense of embarrassment that he hadn’t been intimate with another person in so long.
They found Benny out on the deck, as Hope said. "Hey! Good to see ya friends!" Benny exclaimed, jumping up from his plastic seat to clap his hand on their shoulders.
Dean sighed but stood up and pulled on his boxers as Cas retrieved a tissue to wipe his chest off before pulling a towel from his basket of clean laundry to wrap around his waist. “So I won’t see you at dinner tonight, then?”
As the number of kids grew every year, they would always ask if they could spend their nights in the guest house, but Bobby and Ellen refused, claiming it was too dangerous at night for them to go there alone. It was true that the trek to the guest house was dangerous, not being immediately next to the main building, so whoever stayed there would need to walk nearly half a mile in the dark, and in combination with frequent snow and possible wild animals, the walk was a liability. But they also knew as they grew older, the kids were likely getting up to no good, sneaking alcohol or cigarettes, and the Singers would rather they do it where they can keep an eye on the kids. The kids always grumbled about it for a few minutes, usually because they wanted to stay up late unsupervised, but they really couldn’t complain because the Singer’s main cabin was spacious enough for all the kids, and they were rarely reprimanded for being too loud in the wee morning hours. In the morning Bobby would always tell the kids they kept him up all night with their racket, but they knew he was only giving them a hard time because he would always say this as he flipped their pancakes.
“Yeah, outside on the patio against the railing. Your brothers will be gone a while,” Dean began kissing up Castiel’s neck.
“I had a sip of my aunts wine once, and I enjoyed the taste of that. But no I am not a big drinker. I have yet to find something I enjoy.”
. He settled in at the diner, barely touching the cup of coffee and chocolate chip muffin he ordered as he thought about Cas at the psychiatrists office. When Castiel joined him just under an hour later Dean pushed the muffin towards him, and as Cas ate he shyly asked if they could stop at the local pharmacy. Dean gave him an empathetic smile and said, "Whatever you need, Cas."
Castiel smirked with an “Okay,” as Dean threw the car into reverse and pulled out of the driveway. “Where are we going?” He asked, the car driving away from Dean’s neighborhood, the streetlights becoming more and more sparse.
"Hey, I'm going to stay here, can you make sure Cassie gets home safe?" Gabriel asked when he found Dean, glancing back at Hope who gave him a smile from what must have been her bedroom door.
"I promise we are going to spend time together, you only live what, an hour away, tops? We're going to spend plenty of time together," Dean leaned over to place a soft kiss on Castiel's lips.
There was something a little off about Cas’ tone, hollow and slightly distant. That revelation earlier about Cas’ life before he moved to Caroline was clearly huge, and also just the tip of the iceberg. There was so much that Dean didn’t know about his friend.
Sam looked up at that. “If you’re going to need help with the repairs, my brother runs a handyman service. He can do just about anything, and has contacts for anything he doesn’t do himself. He’s done everything from hanging pictures to major remodels. Plus he lives right here in Caroline, rather than having to go farther out.”
Dean slides his arm around Cas and pulls him close. “It’s working great, though. I never thought he’d actually be interested, you know? So when we finally said something, just boom. Away we went. He’s amazing.” He leans over and presses a soft kiss to Cas’ temple. Touching his lips to Cas’ skin sends a zing of heat through him. His face feels unaccountably hot. He holds tighter to Cas, feeling momentarily unsteady.
What if she’d done something similar with him? He cringed at the very thought. Zach and sex didn’t belong in the same sentence. Eww. Just eww.
Dean parsed through that. “So you’d like to remodel,” he concluded. “Gotta be honest, if you want to do much more than replace the appliances you’ll probably need to either expand into an adjacent room, or blow out this back wall and make an addition. And if we kept the footprint your appliance choices would be seriously limited. They make them a lot bigger than they did when this house was built.”
“Show me where they are and I’ll take care of it. Clean up first, before you fall over asleep right on your floor.”
“What about this? If I recall correctly, pine is easy to work with and inexpensive. At some point in the future I would indeed like to have built in bookshelves in the room, and based on what I am seeing here, I would definitely order them from you. With that in mind, it doesn’t make sense to do anything more than the functional minimum for the interim period.”
“Hey,” he returned the greeting, pretending to go in for a hug before wrinkling his nose. “Ew. You’re all gross and sweaty.”
He couldn’t help but be aware that those resources were too far away, though. Gabriel agreed, which was why he’d agreed to the plan to alert Michael’s security.
“Almost no one does that. Cabinets are mounted to the walls. You don’t just pick them up and shift them six inches over. There’s an argument to putting flooring on the entire floor, before putting in the cabinets. But usually the monetary savings are worth it, unless you’re really not worried about the money. At all.”
“Hey,” he said, smiling warmly, but keeping his voice quiet. He raised his hand in a friendly half wave rather than extending it to shake, guessing that physical contact would also make him less comfortable. “I’m Dean, and you must be Castiel.” He pronounced the name carefully, hoping like hell he’d gotten it right.
He catches his breath, feeling a rush of heat start low in his chest and spread up to warm him all over when Dean flips back the blankets on the other side of the bed. The mattress dips down when he settles in and rearranges the pillows, yawning dramatically.
Luc and the newcomer moved to the dining room. Michael nodded crisply, not bothering to stand up from his seat at the head of the table. “Mr. Winchester. So good of you to join us. Please, have a seat and we can get started. You’ve just met Luc. I’m Michael, this is Gabriel, and Castiel is half hiding. Pay no mind to him, he’s always been odd.”
“Yeah, I heard. No method to the madness. So, guess we just have to dig in, huh? Do you want to open everything first, make sure there’s nothing you’d be uncomfortable with me handling?”
“No, not at all. Your directions were clear.” He stepped inside after wiping his shoes on the mat just outside the door. “Gotta say, this house isn’t what I was expecting.”
“Sounds like him.” He watched as Mariel shifted, then let out a tremendous burp. He chuckled. “She sure makes a lot of noise for such a little peanut.”
“Thinking about it.” She nudged him in the side with her elbow. “He’s a cool dude. And you have a huge crush on him.”
Cas swallowed again, then ripped the tape off of the box. An image of the ‘rip the bandage off’ metaphor hit him, and he chuckled, all the while aware that it was an entirely inappropriate reaction.
expecting. Maybe something a little more… brick. And in the city.” He looked around, taking in details of the cozy front room. “I like it.”
“I’m sorry you’re getting dragged into this world, Cas,” Dean said, lightly bumping their shoulders together as they watched the fire burning down.
Cas stared at the ceiling of his bedroom, flat on his mattress. He’d mostly calmed down after the movie and then the ride home, but his skin still felt extra sensitive, and there was a vague sick feeling high in his stomach.
Dean decided to test his theory a little further. “Maybe we could order pizza after, and watch a movie. Or play a little poker. Do you play poker?”
“No, we did what we could. No one will be able to trace what is left back to us. Other than perhaps those who sent the creature there in the first place.”
Monday morning, Castiel carefully packed the book back into his satchel before heading back to his office at the museum. He was lost in thought as he travelled the short distance between his home and the museum. He’d walked this path hundreds if not thousands of times before; he’d often made it back and forth without consciously recalling a single step or turn.
“Parts of them. There wasn’t anything even remotely magical about them. They were histories, books of poetry. Ordinary classics, first editions, rare books. Beautiful, but not occult in nature.”
Gradually he and Cas developed more of a friendship, though there were still times that Cas was skittish, if Dean crossed some boundary that he didn’t entirely understand. Worse, or maybe better? the boundary seemed to be shifting.
“It’s watching mud dry, Cas, what’s fascinating about it? Unless the fascination comes in watching the way certain biceps ripple and bulge when performing physical labor. Oh, or how about the bonus footage of plumber’s crack?”
“They already have two children. So yes. They’re quite pleasant, though, so I enjoy working with them. Are you packed for the trip yet?” Cas changed the topic abruptly. He often did that. Sometimes gave Dean conversational whiplash, though he was mostly used to it by now.
“That’s certainly something worth celebrating. How do you like your burger done, Cas? I know exactly how Dean prefers his, so not even going to ask.”
Dean followed along the corridor towards the bathrooms. When he was nearly there he caught a hint of movement in the general area of the antechamber where Michael waited with his entourage before making any of his formal public addresses. Those were always held in the nearby courtyard. Dean eased back against the wall, taking a moment to assess the environment.
If all went according to plan, Castiel would not be anywhere near here by then. Still… perhaps. Was it wise to keep a sliver of hope that there was any kind of possibility of seeing Dean again? It seemed unlikely.
“Cases like these are difficult because they are always the word of one person against another. However… she isn’t without any corroborating evidence.”
“Ah ah,” she said, shaking her finger at him. “I’ll hear none of that. Go. You work too much. You’re still a young man. You should be out socializing.”
“Well.” Cas seemed rather nonplussed by that. “Thank you? I haven’t been called ‘awesome’ before. It’s quite flattering.”
Cas reflexively wrapped his arms around her, holding her against his chest. The painful swelling emotions soothed and softened as her warmth and baby powder scent took hold. She made a little snuffling sound and looked up at him, blinking twice with her big blue eyes, studying him for a long moment. Then she apparently decided she was okay with this, and brought her fist up to her mouth as she relaxed against him.
Dean leans towards Cas. “Is your aunt seriously trying to teach Anna manners right now? As if she doesn’t already have flawless ones?”
Dean looked up sharply. Had there been something more than simple acknowledgement in that tone? Maybe a hint of flirtation, a suggestion of things that he had no business thinking while he was on duty?
Would he perhaps have met Dean, before he met Bartholomew? He caught his breath at that thought as a brilliant flash of possibilities exploded behind his eyes. Childhood memories he’d never experienced. Playing by the creek with Dean, barefoot, mud up to their knees, chasing frogs and laughing when they hopped away, when one or the other of them fell and was coated in the mud, head to toe. Perhaps even having the fortitude to insist on going to college wherever Dean was, building a relationship with him rather than Bart.
“Okay, close your eyes,” Dean said when they got to the hallway leading to the kitchen, before the turn that took them into the room.
Castiel felt his face grow warm. If Mr. Winchester was mentally addressing him by his first name, did that mean he felt they could become friends? “Cas is… acceptable,” he said, feeling awkward.
The streets were relatively quiet tonight, likely because of the chill. The temperatures were certainly warmer than the dead of winter. Havenport could be dreary during January and February, but soon there would be spring flowers, and the last of the snow would disappear. Castiel spent most of his time indoors, given the delicate nature of the books he was usually working with, but when he indulged in reading less valuable books for pleasure, he liked to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine and the sound of the sea.
“I certainly hope so.” Cas was equal parts nervous and excited. On paper the new kitchen and the rest of the addition would be amazing.
“This is written in ancient Enochian.” Castiel looked up at his visitor, gaze narrowed. “Where did you obtain a book written in ancient Enochian?”
“Hey, Cas!” Dean called out a short time later, after he heard the rumble of the truck pulling away again. “They’re gone.”
Cas was focused on breathing properly. He still felt all tingly, and dizzy with how fast his world view had shifted. He rather thought that if he moved too fast he might just fall entirely. At least they probably thought it was because of his aversion to dealing with new people, so he was safe enough that way.
Cas nodded. He lifted his gaze, meeting Dean’s. “I like you, Dean. When we met at the bar, if the timing hadn’t been terrible, I would have liked to have pursued something with you. I perhaps would have withheld my true nature for some time, had circumstances not forced my hand. It is not the easiest thing to tell another, particularly not someone that I find very attractive.”
Dean turned towards Charlie, making his expression as openly pleading as possible. “Red! Burgers. And
“I fear this young man was entirely mistaken. What I have translated so far is pure nonsense. Folderol. If you paid money for it, you were taken for a fool.”
Cas was still waiting, though, and Dean knew he wasn’t going to be able to wriggle out of this one. So. Wishing these were
He couldn’t help but think about what Cas would say. Cas, with his strong opinions about sexual harassment in the workplace, and the ethical violations involved.
Cas was shaking his head. “It is far more than ‘just a piece of art’. If we had hours I might be able to begin to explain, but we do not. A gross over-simplification is that it is symbolically the single most important cultural artifact of the Novak Wing, but there is more that that. Please. Just… just alert your people to be on the lookout for him. It would be impossible to miss him in draconic form, but as a human, with all of these other people here, it would not be so difficult for him to make his way inside.”
“Yes. Is there more in there? He knows I prefer chocolates to lollipops, especially those monstrosities.” The one Dean held had to be the size of a dinner plate.
“Sure. Honestly, though, I should probably take a week or two to catch up on some of my other projects before we get started.”
In his experience very few humans would fail to notice if his fingers suddenly lengthened and hardened into sharp talons, or if his pupils turned to slits and the irises began to glow. Preventing that from happening took mental discipline, and was exhausting.
A pained expression crossed his face. “Dean.” His tone was frustrated. “There is no time,” he hissed. “Even as we speak, he could be here. Walker could have any number of objectives, but it is our belief that he is planning to strike at the heart of Novak Hoard.”
The electrical work wasn’t quite done, but Benny had another commitment the next day, so Dean pulled up to the Albright — scratch that, the
He did love this movie, but he’d seen it so many times he could replay the entire film scene by scene in his head. His thoughts wandered back to Cas.
“Nope. Not yet.” She snuggled deep, her arms inside his winter coat, before releasing him and taking one of the bags from him. “Okay. Now we’re done. Did you get everything on your list?” She set the bag down on her kitchen counter and opened it. “Beer. Yum, some holiday brews? I knew you had it in you!”
“Not yet, no. Not going to lie, this all happened fast. I figured I’d look around this weekend, try and find an apartment nearby.”
Dean grinned at him. Quintessential Cas, going on about small things. The thing was he was genuinely interested in it. In everything. “So what kind of meatballs?”
“Screw you, Sam. How’s Eileen? And Mildred?” And he was off. Dean wasn’t entirely sure if he’d really deflected Sam successfully or if Sam just allowed it, but frankly? He didn’t care.
A year ago he’d never have dreamed he’d be in this place. Wizard Technology had been Charlie’s idea. Apparently she’d been dreaming of it for years, having her own technology consulting firm. After both Dean and Cas quit Sandover, she pitched the idea to them. She was brilliant with the tech, but she knew there were other skills needed that she frankly lacked and had no interest in developing.
“I asked around a bit, didn’t find anything alarming. I’m okay with it.” He smiled then. “Congratulations, Cassie. You’re about to turn this place into somewhere actually habitable.”
Dean typically stayed a little later than his crew, going up to knock on Cas’ turret room door and let him know everyone was gone. Cas usually left the door open slightly.
Castiel arched a brow, then casually shifted in his chair to follow her direction. “What am I not staring at?”
“Make sure to fill out those forms by the end of the week, and bring them to me in Human Resources,” Cas said, wrapping up. “My office is on the sixth floor. You can also send them interoffice mail if you prefer. Your department admin will fill you in on the requirements for your business line.”
Everything was taking too long. Dean was in danger, Castiel knew it deep in his bones. His every instinct screamed at him to rush to him, but going unprepared would be worse than useless. He had to find and prepare the components for the spells he might use, had to check them again to make sure he’d read them correctly. He debated transcribing them into a less valuable book, but decided it wasn’t worth the time or the risk of copying something over incorrectly in his haste. Better to risk the book itself.
“Okay, there’s a whole truck full of wrong with that statement, but bottom line? That doesn’t make it your fault. You’re the victim here, not a … not a damned co-criminal, if there is such a thing. Sounds to me like asshole Bart was a master manipulator who saw an opening and took it.”
“Dude,” Dean breathes. “Shit, Cas, I’m sorry.” He is, too. Cas has been seeing Danny for, what, seven months now? That’s a long time. Not that Danny is some awesomely great prize, or anything. The guy isn’t anywhere near good enough for Cas. This stunt is some prime evidence right there. Still, Dean isn’t about to rub salt in the wounds by saying Danny’s a jerk anyhow and he’s better off without him.
He came back with the popcorn poured into a large red plastic bowl and handed Cas a beer. “What’d you choose?”
“Never said that, I would never have said that. You know me better than that. Besides, donuts are half off after noon!”
“I like him too,” Sam says. “He’s a good guy. But skittish when it comes to relationships. Sort of like someone else I know.”
Castiel hesitated, looked at the carriage driver, then back to the street. He considered passing on the ride back to the museum and walking. It was only two miles or so, definitely a reasonable walking distance.
Those words could apply as easily to Castiel’s father as to Mr. Richard Roman. Charles Novak absolutely believed that wealth justified whatever he wanted, whether that be sending his second son overseas to school to get him away from ‘associating with unsuitable social inferiors’, or… or…
Dean thought that if they got to a point where they needed another sales guy, he’d give Billie a call.
“It’s a sweet house. She deserves to be treated better. With a little TLC she’ll go back to being the gorgeous lady she was in her heyday.”
Castiel nodded. The simple fact of the matter was that he didn’t trust himself when it came to whether or not others were trustworthy. Not since… well. Not since
“Are we getting cranberries?” Emma asked. “When we were talking about Thanksgiving dinners in kindy-garden, lots of people said they have cranberries. Turkey and cranberries. Claire said she likes turkey legs.”
“Yes, I brought the food with me. And fine. I’ll get everything set up in the front parlor, since the dining room is a mess.”
Dean grinned at him, slightly manic. “I have faith in you. Besides… you’re what we’ve got.” He darted in for another quick kiss, then slipped away to dress again.
Cas, of course, wasn’t expecting it, so rather than neatly catching it, he belatedly reached out, causing it to bounce off of his knuckles and into the middle of the pile of boxes, naturally finding an opening in the center of the stacks and sliding down between them.
“Very well, then,” Michael finally said. “But don’t call me in a couple hours complaining that all of the sheets are moth-eaten and everything smells funny.”
Castiel’s chest suddenly felt tight. The feeling and words threatened to bring old wounds of his own to the surface, but this wasn’t the time. This was Dean’s story, not his. “And you suspect Mr. Roman was somehow involved?”
beautiful. There are a great many beautiful things here in this courtyard, in this palace. You will have to be more specific.”
Dean’s shoulders tensed before he forced them to relax again. “Yeah. Kind of figured that out. Especially after talking with my brother. Sam.”
Gabriel shot him a quick look at that, flushing faintly. He was perhaps the only person who really understood just how significant that phrasing was, when Castiel no longer trusted even himself.
Cas’ gaze moved over Dean, lingering, as though he were silently cataloging everything he could see. He spent longest on his chest, studying the way that Dean moved, the thickness of the bandaging under his shirt. “You seem to be doing well.”
Oh man, oh man. That sort of attitude wasn’t going to get anyone very far in Caroline, Kansas, Dean thought. Sarah’s posture straightened.
He wondered how long he would have to wait until it would be warm enough to start working on those projects. There was undoubtedly something he could begin immediately, clearing away some of the brush, deciding where he wanted to plant things, reviewing articles and gardening catalogs.
Dean grinned at her. She sounded like an incredibly interesting person. He hoped they’d be friends. He was new in town; he needed to build a social circle here.
Cas stopped just inside the doorway, taking a moment to look around, and then slowly wandered about. He lightly ran his fingers over a table Dean was working on for Jody, and a headboard he was hoping to sell despite not having a buyer ready-made. “That one was made from a reclaimed church door,” he told Cas, breathing in. The sawdust and wood scents calmed him. “Sometimes I find some cool architectural pieces at salvage sales and auctions. If they’re interesting and affordable I’ll buy them and turn them into something else.”
Perhaps it also explained the strange lights to the north, in the direction of the sea caverns. He wanted to run this theory past Dean, see what he thought. Castiel checked his pocket-watch. 5:30; approaching dinner time. Surely Dean would return soon.
“Yeah?” Dean smiled back. That smile… there wasn’t much there, barely a tilt of one corner of his mouth, but Dean knew it was rare, and therefore valuable. He determined then and there that he would make it his mission to coax that little smile out of hiding more often, tempt it to come out to play, maybe make a regular appearance. Cas was already handsome. With that smile he was amazing.
He drove completely through the town before turning around and doubling back to a parking spot on a side street near Sam Winchester’s office building. Taking a deep breath, he got out of the car and straightened, inhaling the warm sweet spring air. This was nothing like the big cities he was accustomed to, Chicago or even Topeka. The air was fresh and scented with lilacs rather than car exhaust, the light was clear when it wasn’t filtered through a faint layer of pollution. If he listened intently he could hear the susurrus of the nearby river.
“Hey babe,” Jess said, coming in and going up on her toes to press a quick kiss to her husband’s lips. “How’d the meeting go?”
Dean, however… Dean fascinated him. He didn’t think he was imagining a connection between the two of them, the seeds of a friendship. At least he hoped he wasn’t imagining it. Dean might be this warm and inviting with anyone as a tool of his profession. That was certainly grounds to be cautious and not to get invested. Besides, Dean did not live in Havenport. When his case was finished, he would be leaving again.
Interesting. Whatever was going on, Castiel would wager it meant a great deal to the other man. Either he was extremely dedicated to his career, or this was somehow more personal.
“Looks like she’s most of the way there already.” Dean held out his arms to accept his tiny niece, loving the baby-powder-and-milk scent of her, and the way her sweet warm roundness just settled right against him. She blinked at him twice with her big eyes, and made a little grasping motion with her fingers. He put his pinky into her palm, and grinned when she clutched it tightly. “Yeah, Peanut, I’m right here. Uncle Dean’s got you. Now how about you take a nice little nap so that you’ll be all rested up and noisy when your Daddy gets home?”
Castiel didn’t like the idea, but he nodded. “Yes. I can do those things. I just prefer not to. You’ll be there too, though, won’t you? I know you need to get back to Chicago as well.”
Castiel suppressed a sigh. “The man we met at the bar, yes. You recall he works security for the palace. He would be in a position to watch for Walker. If he knew it was important.”
“No,” he managed to choke out the word, hoping against hope that he sounded properly enchanted to meet them. His heart was pounding so hard and fast that he was having problems hearing himself think, and his face felt hot.
“Anyhow, yeah, I’d definitely have time in my calendar to work on that place. So what’s for lunch?” He turned his brightest smile on his sister-in-law. “Hopefully not just rabbit food.”
He turned then, at the uncertainty in his boyfriend’s tone. Dean was scratching the back of his neck, a gesture he commonly employed when he was nervous about something. Shy uncertainty was an appealing look on him, but the fact that Dean thought there was any room for doubt about Cas’ reaction? That wasn’t so appealing.
