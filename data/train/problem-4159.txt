Dean and Castiel played a round of pool until their beers and the basket of fries arrived. They then decided to take a break for a bit but they never made it back to pool. Dean was not generally such a big talker but it seemed to come easy with Castiel and Castiel had no problems opening up to Dean. Dean was not certain if Castiel was just an open man who could talk about things easily or if he was having the same effect with Dean. He did not strike Dean as the open type, but he couldn’t be for sure.
[greeneyedhunter] What are you wearing?
"Today is August 11th, 1997. I am here with Dean Winchester age 17." Dr. Mills spoke into the recorder. "Dean? Can you tell me what happened in the woods that night?"
They stayed together for a while before Castiel finally pulled out and dropped down onto the bed beside his husband. Dean’s ass remained in the air. He didn’t have enough energy or strength left in his to move.
Then the scent hit him hard. It was apple pie. It was a candle, not the real thing but that didn’t make any difference. It smelt good enough to make his mouth water and his lips twitch with hunger. He could really go for some apple pie right now.
[greeneyedhunter] You think a judge would let that win?
“You don’t have to leave,” Dean said as he shuffled on his feet. “I can go. It really isn’t that important.”
"He is gone Dean." Cas reached out and gripped Dean's hand in his own. "I am so sorry."
“Like a pro wrestler!” Dean yells. “Like we’re a tag team. You tag me.”
Dean.
You haven’t even seen a picture of me.
“I do not appreciate you taking my father’s name in vein like that,” Castiel growled into Dean’s ear before leaning in and biting at his neck. If Dean had not already come, that would have been the trigger that would have set him off.
“Seriously man,” Dean grew frustrated. “Why do you keep doing that?”
Castiel wasn’t sure if he could answer the question. He did not want to lose his best friend because he had feelings for him. He had been in love with Dean since first grade and if he could not have admitted it throughout all the years the had spent together, how could he admit it now. Now would be nothing more than painful. But Dean had asked, and Dean deserved the truth.
“Hey,” Dean greeted Castiel as he stepped out of his baby. “Glad you made it.”
“I don’t know,” Dean admitted. “I just got home from a night out, got the urge to call you and see how you were doing.”
“How am I not surprised,” Cas laughs. He loves seeing how excited Dean gets over presents.
I made it home okay.
“Okay Cas,” Dean turned to his best friend who looked like a deer in headlights. “What should we do first? Bar or gambling.”
“Well, I am home alone and asleep in bed,” Castiel sighs. “How do you think I am doing?”
[greeneyedhunter] Sounds exciting to me.
Why? I am not committed to bed. I can get up.
Castiel put out his hand, allowing him to climb in. Once he was settled in bed, he placed the fairy on the pillow by his head.
“I know you will,” Castiel assured her. “But to be safe, if you see Michael, walk the other way.”
“Dean,” Castiel turned his body into Dean, their eyes never losing contact with one another. “Do you think I should get back together with her?”
I’m sorry Jimmy.
“There is nothing to be sorry for,” Castiel informed her, causing her to snap her head up in surprise and Dean’s as well. “You felt like your family was being attacked and you acted in the only way you felt you could. Your dad and I both understand this.”
Saturday, September 23
Bobby Singer and Ellen Singer had known his parents since before he was born. They were his second family. When he was a child, if he was not at his house, he was at the Singer’s. However, recently he had to start thinking of them a little differently, since his little brother Adam was now dating Jo, Bobby and Ellen’s youngest child. But since family doesn’t end with blood, that is exactly what they were going to remain to him.
“I would like that,” Castiel’s smile beamed from ear to ear and once again Dean’s heart began to race and his stomach began to turn.
"You told me to come back to you." Dean tried to explain but it didn't even make sense to him at the moment. "What the hell does that even mean?"
“Dean,” Cas began to interrupt, but Dean shook his head.
Dean and Castiel made small talk over dinner and had a few more beers. Ben joined in occasionally but most of the time he just sat quietly. At ten, Ben’s favorite show came on and so they moved into the living room for a while to watch it. Castiel tried to be as interested as he could but Dean could tell that it was not really his thing. Dean liked the show but since he was not much of a show watcher, he could understand how Castiel could be uninterested.
“Here? Now?”
That doesn’t make any sense.
I could use one sick day. Not like Bobby will fire me.
“They were blowing each other in the woods,” Balthazar laughed. No one in the group laughed with him.
Dean doesn’t cry this time. Instead, they both lie there, listening to the other breathing. The silence between them saying more than words could. But the silence didn’t last. Castiel could hear the creaks but his mind couldn’t seem to place where any of the sound was coming from, his only concern being Dean. So, when his bedroom door slammed open and the light flicked on, he barely had time to react.
I just have been having a weird night man.
“Okay,” Dean agreed before leaning forward and lightly capturing Castiel’s lips with his own.
“You wouldn't dare,” Balthazar cried.
What do I do?
You would be accurate with your guess.
Dean …
“I am what?” Dean finally managed to ask.
“Fuck,” Dean whispered under his breath.
“That was so much fun,” Castiel says with sarcasm dripping from his voice.
“I am not sure,” Castiel answered quietly. “I will see what I can do.”
Dean hesitated slightly but pushed through it. He brought his hands up and hooked his fingers into the waistband and pulled. Cas lifted his hips to make it easier. Once Cas’ boxers were off and thrown onto the floor, Dean stood up from the bed. He removed his own boxers, tossing them aside and then climbed back onto the bed between Cas’ legs.
“Yep,” Dean responded, not even bothering to look her direction.
Deep took a deep breath. He has reading into this all wrong. It could not be Castiel. It was not Castiel. Dean just needed to get himself together.
“I see calves that are strong from long hours of standing on your feet,” Castiel kept praising Dean. “Legs that I wouldn’t be able to escape if they were wrapped around my body and holding me into you.”
“Oh, Dean.” Cas stood up and made his way over to Dean. He wrapped his arms around Dean's waist and when Dean relaxed, Cas pulled him in. “I didn't know. I am so sorry. I will go tell them that you are my boyfriend.”
“But you will,” Castiel leaned in and whispered the words into Dean’s ear.
“I would never ask you to promise that to me,” Cas moved closer to Dean and reached forward, finding Dean’s hand and lacing their fingers together. “But do you think you can try and make me one promise?”
He could have used the palace entry, but with guards and Michael's loyal men watching his every move, sneaking out was the safest and the only way to truly leave the palace grounds. He had become quite good at sneaking in and out. Though, it made him wonder, was it skill on his part or lack of skill on his staffs part? He would have to pay more attention to that in the future. But right now, that was all Michael's problem.
[angelofthursday] I have three brothers and two sisters.
“De..”  Castiel started again but was cut off when Dean leaned forward and captured Castiel’s mouth with his own. Castiel stayed frozen for a minute, his mind trying to catch up with what was happening, but as Dean continued to kiss him, he relaxed, kissing Dean back slowly.
“That is what it says.”
“Your best friend,” Dean said the words aloud, not really directed at Cas.
“He said that you guys being together was against God.”
“I am glad you like it,” Cas said.
“Why did you break up with her?” Dean asked. “You loved her.”
Dean pulled his phone out of his pocket to a text message from Castiel. It was slightly childish how excited he got over the text message. It was like when you made a friend in school and all you wanted to do was hang out with your friend, doing whatever it was that friends were supposed to do. It had been a long time since he really spent time with the friends he did have. They were all married and living their lives, just like he had been. His best friend was the one he missed the most, but Charlie was away exploring the world, doing what they both had dreamed of doing. He may not be doing it with her but he is damn glad she got out of this town.
Considering the thought had already arrived, Dean decided to get some use out of it. He grabbed the soap and rubbed it between his hands, getting a good lather. He them leaned himself against the wall and reached town, taking his now hard cock into his hands. He stroked long and slow, letting the image of Cas dance around in his head. Cas rubbing at the muscles in his shoulders, down his back and then finally rubbing his ass.
Pulling his truck into his normal parking spot, Dean kicked the engine off and climbed out. Sam liked to laugh at him for getting a truck that is so high off the ground. Dean is not a short man by any means but his truck was so high that he had to climb out of it. Ben thinks his dad is trying to fill some manly code. Sam on the other hand tells him that he is trying to fill a void that is Lisa. Even though Lisa died three years ago, Dean was not completely over it. How do you get over the only person you ever truly loved?
Castiel cannot stop the laugh that erupts from inside of him. He has never heard anything like this before in his entire life. Fanfiction or not, this was priceless.
[angelofthursday] Maybe. I don’t know.
“Yes, it was,” Cas agreed, nodding into Dean. “It really was.”
“Mmhmm,” Cas mumbles, on the verge of falling asleep.
[Cas] But I think one way will hurt less.
Once in the room, he locked the door behind him. From then on out, he was safe. But he was going to have to find a new place for his fairy to hide when he would be out of the room. When it was a non-resting day, he sometimes spent his time, from when he woke up until he went to bed, out of his room for the entire day. Anna would keep an eye on it from time to time but she had work she had to do and wasn’t always around to keep track of his things.
Dean hated his birthday. It was just another reminder of all the things in life he had missed out on. What were they even celebrating? But he made a big deal out of Sam’s birthday every year, because he’s his baby brother, so Sam in turn did the same for him. He told Dean that they were not hunting for the weekend of his birthday, instead, they were headed to Vegas for gambling, drinks and girls. All three of those were Dean’s favorite things. So, as much as he hated his birthday, he could admit that he was looking forward to the trip.
Dean’s hand moved down from Castiel’s thigh and settles between then. A small moan escapes Castiel’s lips as it brushes against his penis, the only thing separating Dean’s and himself being a thin piece of fabric. He’d imagined touching Dean and having Dean touching him many times, but now that it was happening, his brain couldn’t function.
[greeneyedhunter] It’s about time man.
Was he though?
[greeneyedhunter] Awe. You like me.
Tuesday, September 26th 2006
Things between Cas and Dean had been awkward since Dean's return home. They still talked and to the outside eye, things would seem normal between them. But Dean knew better and noticed more than someone else would. He noticed how Cas did not invade his space, never standing closer than he needed to unless he was helping Dean with something he was still unable to fully do on his own. Cas acted oblivious to the changes but Dean knew. He never should have told Cas about the dream he had when he was in the coma.
“I uh,” there was a pause on the other end and Dean nearly laughed upon figuring it out.
[angelofthursday] The sun part is accurate though. I get a lot of sun.
“My cob is not golden yellow,” Dean protests.
“Enough,” Castiel muttered to himself. He was trying to escape his life for a few hours, not dwell on all that it currently was. Today was about fun and some semblance of adventure.
[555-4033 | You] Awe. Don't be that way.
Castiel pushed his cock against Dean’s thigh in response and Dean whined. He fucking whined. He was falling apart in Castiel’s arms and he didn’t even care. Everything about this was how it was supposed to be.
As if reading Dean’s mind, Cas worked to turn them, pushing Dean against the wall, before dropping to his knees in front of Dean. He looked up at Dean, eyes lust blown, the blacks parts almost so big you could no longer see the amazing blue they generally were. Fuck. He was so beautiful.
Castiel hesitated as he lifted the top of his laptop and settled onto his bed. He was supposed to talk with Dean tonight. They talked every night, eight o’clock on the dot. Castiel had never been late for one of these chats. He looked forward to them all day. It was wrong, he knew this. Dean was his best friend. They had been best friends since the first day of High School. Castiel had just moved to town and Dean said it was a breath of fresh air to see someone he hadn’t seen every day since he started Kindergarten. It was a small town. Castiel was grateful. But that was not what made talking to Dean wrong. Dean was in love with him. No, not him. Jimmy. Dean was in love with Jimmy, the guy Castiel had made up in order to talk freely with Dean.
See you tomorrow, Jimmy.
“Yeah,” Castiel chimes in with a laugh of his own. “Gotta get you signed up for that Tinder.”
[angelofthursday] Okay. Ask away.
[angelofthursday] In a strict friend way. He does not bat for my team. Which is a shame.
Castiel worked his hand along his hips, down his thighs, over his calves and back up between his legs, stopping before he touched Dean’s already leaking cock. Castiel was nice, but lessons could not be learned but simply giving someone what they wanted. They had to earn that. Dean had to earn it.
“You gonna be able to read this last card?” Castiel asks.
“What the fuck?” Dean asked angrily into the shower, unsure of who or what was behind him.
“Suit yourself.” The lady shrugged. “Lucky for you this one is broken. Won't be able to fly away from you if it wanted to.”
“I am glad you asked,” Castiel was smiling from ear to ear but Dean knew him better than that. He was bouncing around on the balls of his feet and fidgeting with his fingers. Cas was scared if Dean had ever seen it before.
[angelofthursday] Then ask about me. Know me. My books are not me.
So why are you still talking to me?
[greeneyedhunter] Should have just told her you were gay.
"I remember," Cas followed suit and dropped to his knees in front of Dean. "Now please, wake up."
“I am such a good boy,” Dean choked out.
Dean looked himself over in the mirror for what had to be the tenth time today. He had spent the day in his room trying to recover from a rather traumatizing night out he had just had. While at a local bar, one he had frequented many times over the years, he had struck out with multiple women and even a couple of men. He used to be able to walk into a bar and within minutes find someone to take home if that was his reason for being there. But this time, no one seemed interested in him. A couple of women even laughed him off, one going as far as calling him an old man. He was thirty-five years old. He was not old.
Could be.
Why didn’t you?
Dean was suddenly turning, coming face to face with a very naked and a very wet Cas. He was even more incredible than Dean had ever imagined. His body was tan and muscular. He was a God. Correction, he was an angel.
Dean had waited over an hour and there was still no response from Castiel. He tried to tell himself over and over again that this was a mistake. He had not been talking to Cas, it was just a coincidence that Angel had logged out right after Dean had assumed it was him. Cas had been his best friend for twenty years. He would not lie to him or play with his heart that way. It had to be someone else that he knew. Anyone but Cas.
It was Cas.
“I am awake now,” Castiel lets him know. “So, what is it that you needed?”
"What is happening?" Another voice? Dean did not recognize this voice but he could tell that it was a woman before he actually saw her.
Another eruption of laughter but Castiel isn’t laughing yet.
“A Lincoln Continental Mark V,” Dean whispered to himself. Who was this guy?
“I feel I have made you angry.” Cas was now standing beside him.
[angelofthursday] I do not mind in the slightest. I was starting to feel the same way.
Dean looked around the couch and spotted one of his notebooks lying on the side table. He grabbed it and flipped it open, keeping a straight face the entire time.
“You don’t have a soul,” Dean spoke again, at no one in particular. He was just stating a fact. Castiel did not have a soul. And he was his best friend. He was not Dean’s soul mate. Was he?
Dean made his way across the apartment, Cas right behind him. Dean knew that running away was not the best thing for him but he needed to get some air; He needed to clear his head and he could not do that with Cas staring him down.
“You want to go somewhere quieter and talk,” Bella pushed in against his side and whispered into his ear. Dean’s body stiffened up and but he brushed it off as being nervous.
“We need some sort of countdown,” Castiel suggests. “Let’s be like ‘Be Your Angelical Best.’ Yeah, that makes me feel…”
“Follow me,” Castiel instructed.
[angelofthursday] When I was sixteen, I started dating this girl in high school. She was this crazy gothic chick who thought my nerdy glasses were cute.
Castiel made his way back into his room, checking behind himself to make sure he was not being followed. It didn’t happen often, but with the suspicion that Michael was showing earlier, he had to be careful. Michael was no against sending someone to spy on him or even sending people into his room for searches. There had never been anything said about these searches, but there had been plenty of times that he had returned to his room and things were not exactly where he had left them.
He found a nice spot by a stream. There were logs placed nearby. Someone had obviously set this up at one point. Seemed like a good enough place to try and think.
[Dean] Well, that is what I am here for dude. What’s up?
“So, she hit someone?” Dean asked Castiel to break the silence. His husband had barely spoken to him since they had arrived.
[angelofthursday] I assure you, hunter. I am no child.
“If I choose to,” Castiel answered. “But I am not the one with a lesson to learn this evening.”
Castiel moved back down the bed and kissed the top of Dean’s foot, before moving to the other. Inch by inch, Castiel kissed his way up to Dean’s body, trying not to leave a single spot without attention. With each kiss, Castiel would whisper beautiful, or perfect. Dean would argue but the sincerity in Castiel’s voice was hard to fight.
“Really,” Castiel agreed with a nod. “However, we need to maybe take some time to think of other ways for you to handle situations like this when they arise, and they will arise quite a bit in your life, unfortunately.”
[Dean] And who would this or these parties be?
[greeneyedhunter] What are those two ways?
Cas is a great guy who made a mistake.
[greeneyedhunter] I was kidding.
Dean? What are you doing?
His world? This was his world. He was going to be sick.
“Fuck,” he screamed, throwing his phone across the room.
[Cas] Other parties in my situation.
“Like my dick huh?”
But you aren’t in love with him?
“You of all people should know that dead doesn’t mean forever,” Tessa stood over the edge of Dean’s bed, smiling down at him. “It was like a horrible vacation.”
Dean was about to argue but stopped when Castiel stepped up behind him, his fully clothed chest pressing into Dean’s back. He slowly wrapped his hand around the front of Dean’s body and set his hand on Dean’s chest. Dean sucked in a breath at the contact.
With that, Castiel pulled all of the way out of Dean and slammed back into him. His pace went from agonizingly slow to a speed and forcefulness that would have thrown Dean from the bed if he wasn’t holding on. And he was cumming. Dean’s entire body tightened up as he came hard without even having to reach down and stroke it out of his cock. All he needed was Castiel and knowing that he had given him exactly what he wanted. Dean had come undone. He was sure he was screaming but everything was a blur and his heart was pounding so hard he felt it was going to break through his rib cage.
“No. Dean wait.” Castiel stepped out and grabbed Dean’s arm, turning him around. “Will you please come in?”
Dean reaches back and spins the wheel.
“That doesn’t sound like a lot of fun,” Dean laughs nervously. “You should be home in bed, not alone and having lots of fun.”
“I love them,” Cas admitted. He was tempted to open them now but they were not done. There would be time to demolish them later. He was certain they would taste incredible after sex with Dean. “Okay, what is next?”
Nope. But you will.
“Pretty much,” she laughed back, though she wished she was somewhere else completely. There was a time that she wanted to help Dean move on but then she grew to like him and now she wished it was anyone but him.
Dean had not really given it that much thought, but yeah, he was totally in love.
“Curl up in your favorite reading corner and prepare for the awkward,” Castiel laughs, leaning in toward the camera with his own upbeat smile and persona. “Our twisted crew has created a game for us today that involves us reading fanfiction about ourselves. Out loud. For all the internet to see.”
You know I love you.
“Don’t say it,” Dean finishes for him. “Yeah, yeah. Just saying. It’s not yellow.”
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked, shifting in his seat, willing his semi to go away.
If you do not answer me, I am coming over.
“What?” Dean pulled back when asking the question.
“It’s not what I think?” Meg yelled. “How the fuck is my boyfriend curled up in bed with another guy, not what I think? I trusted you. How could you cheat on me?”
“I was going to go into town,” Castiel admitted.
“Well,” Sam stopped to think about it for a moment, “he can leave any time he wants I suppose.”
Hey, you want to come over and watch a movie or something tonight?
“Good,” Cas turned to face Dean, his face also holding a fake smile. Dean’s heart sunk into his stomach. “I could use a beer as well.”
Dean looked at the text on his phone from Castiel and frowned. He had been avoiding him since what had taken place over the weekend. He knew that it was not Castiel’s fault that any of this happened, but he did not know what to say to him or how to deal with any of this. If there was one thing that Dean was good at, it was hiding from his feelings.
Michael, his father Charles’ younger brother, was acting King until Castiel was deemed fit to take the throne. Part of Castiel wished that he could simply let Michael rule the Kingdom, but he knew that was not in his Kingdom's best interest. Since his parents’ early demise and Michael being placed in charge, the Kingdom has suffered.
[angelofthursday] And who says we can’t be friends that share their dirty thoughts with one another?
"It will be safer if I keep you hidden when I am not in the room." He informed him.
"You are in your house," his mother answered, reaching out to touch his forehead with her hand. "Are you feeling okay Dean?"
“Why the face?” Dean asks, getting on his knees and coming to sit right in front of Cas.
Good.
“Lovely,” Dean mumbles, which is barely audible to the camera but Castiel can hear it loud and clear. But that does not stop him from continuing his part of the script.
“Fine,” Dean pulled back. “I won't touch you. I promise.”
“Something I need?” Dean tried to look in the box but Castiel kept it turned away just right.
“Breakfast Cas,” Dean laughs. “Pretend these last few minutes didn’t happen so we can do this right.”
_____
Castiel continued to kiss down, bringing his lips over Dean’s boxers and kissing against his penis. Dean’s penis jerked at the wetness that Castiel’s mouth left behind and he grabbed at the door, looking for anything to hold onto so that he did not lose his footing when his knees gave out.
I was kind of thinking about right now.
“I need you to be naked,” Castiel informed him.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs. “I am sure that is exactly what her neighbor was doing.”
Dean didn’t pay attention to his phone for the rest of the day. He focused on work and getting home. He was ready for this weekend to take place. Work was never too much for him to handle but he would be lying if he did not admit that by Friday night, he was generally pretty drained.
“I’m just,” Castiel says with a gulp, “I’m not gagging. I’m just fearing.”
“There are four things,” Dean tells him. “One gift that we believe is the other’s favorite snack. One gift that we believe is the other’s favorite color. One gift that made us think of the other person. And finally, one gift that we can do together.”
[greeneyedhunter] You wanna talk dirty with me Cas?
No, that is not what I meant.
Cas did not make Dean wait any longer. He pulled away from Dean and sucked the tip of Dean’s cock into his mouth. Dean rewarded him with a guttural groan, trying hard to not lose it right then and there. He was not going to be that guy but god, Cas was amazing.
“What is this for?” Castiel asked.
“Ugh,” Castiel groans. “The struggle continues. Thanks for liking and commenting on the video.”
You love Cas too.
“I can do this Cas,” Dean promised. “Don’t worry.”
"That is good,” Grace smiled, checking Dean IVs. “The stubborn ones fight the hardest. If anyone can make miracles happen, my money is on the stubborn ones.”
“I think you already know,” Cas finally brought his eyes to meet with Dean’s. They looked as if Cas was about to cry and even though Dean was angry, that was not something he ever wanted. He never wanted to be a reason that his best friend cried.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Castiel informed him. He stood up from where he was sitting and made his way over to Dean and allowed Dean to take him into his arms. “I know that you are stressed out with work.”
“I thought I had a few leads,” Castiel was very business-like in answering his question, something that he was still working on. “None of them showed any real promise. I will keep looking though. I will never stop looking.”
“What is?” Dean found himself asking a few minutes later. Had it been a few minutes? He had no idea how much time had actually passed since he was laid onto the bed.
“I doubt it,” Dean pulled the beer up to his mouth and took a long deep swig. “But who knows. He knew the bar and where it was. So he has very likely been in here before.”
“I what?” Dean asked, very confused by Castiel’s statement. “What does that even mean?”
“Honey Bear Latte?” Dean asked, grabbing one of the coffee cups in front of him and handing it to Cas.
[angelofthursday] I am from California.
[555-4033 | You] Okay. When do we leave?
“We need ice cream,” Dean comments.
It got quiet again, but not because Dean did not know what to say. This time, it was because he had so much to say but he did not understand it enough to put it into words. How long had he been in love with Cas? Why did no one tell him about this sooner? Maybe they could have avoided this entire situation. Though part of Dean felt that they would still be here, in the same situation. Telling Dean something didn’t change much; he had to experience things to believe in them.
“Thank you for the ride,” Castiel smiled over at Dean. “I am not even sure how they talked me into going to a party.”
By the time they made it back to the campsite,  everyone was gathered around the fire, drinking and laughing. Dean felt better about all of this. He knew that Castiel's reasons for not telling people was valid and it was not meant to hurt him.
: You are not scary at all. I just … I knew if you knew where I lived, you would want to meet and I was not ready for that.
“Dean,” Castiel called out as he banged on Dean’s apartment door.
[Cas] Yes. I am okay. And I am not in danger or anything.
I was thinking that tomorrow we should meet.
Before he could really think about what he was doing, Dean was standing up and making his way over to Balthazar. His hands were clenched into fists at his side but he was working now to control himself. Even if all Dean wanted to do was hit the smug Brit in the face.
“Yeah?” Castiel asks into the phone, unable to hide both the annoyance and tiredness in his voice.
“Someone is too excited to get to the sex under the tree,” Cas laughs but grabs the final present for Dean.
Whether or not you love and want to be with me.
Or maybe I won’t.
But he was wrong. The fruit was only the first. He continued through the rest, only taking small bites. But to him, they were probably giant. Castiel had probably brought the thing enough food to feed a dozen fairies.
“Oh Gosh,” Castiel moans, his hand losing rhythm the closer he gets to orgasm.
“Let’s talk about that,” Dean finishes off, ending their opening monologue.
I am definitely going to enjoy it while I can.
“I lost a bet, though I had intended to lose it the entire time,” he gave a little more detail behind his reasoning.
“Why didn’t you?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrow at Cas.
“I hate you so much,” Dean huffed through his teeth at Sam as he made his way into the bathroom and slammed the door behind him.
[angelofthursday] My name is Castiel Novak and I live in San Francisco, California.
“Goodnight,” Castiel whispered.
Castiel continued moving his hands up, over Dean’s ass until they reached his lower back. He then slipped his fingers into the back of Dean’s boxers and slowly pulled them down, passed his knees and to his ankles. Dean stepped out of them before Castiel grabbed them and tossed them in the direction of the rest of his clothes.
“Whatever,” Meg sighed, but she leaned in and gave him a quick kiss that in her own way showed him that she would forgive him for the interruption. “See you tomorrow. Sorry about your dog or whatever.”
[angelofthursday] Maybe someday.
Castiel picks up his other card.
“Can I what?” Castiel asked, confused about what was going on. Why wasn’t Dean angry with him?
“Sammy,” Dean yelled, pushing his brother’s shoulder, though not hard enough to move the Moose. “What the fuck do you think you’re …”
_ _ _ _ _ _
[angelofthursday] Definitely.
This causes an uproar of laughter.
Once they were both naked, Dean grabbed Cas and led him over to the bed, slightly pushing him. Cas took the hint and crawled onto the bed, lying on his back in the middle. Dean was fairly certain his angel had never done this before, at least not with a man. Technically, he hadn't ever been with a man either. But unlike in his coma induced dream, Dean was not afraid to move forward.
[angelofthursday] I apologize for being rude.
[greeneyedhunter] Guess you better make it worth my drive.
Saturday, September 30th, 2006
“Can I tell them?”
"I called grandma and grandpa," Ben told Dean as he came to.
Cas made the motion of his head exploding, along with a noise that was supposed to represent the motion, but was slightly off. It was cute though. It was Cas.
"I will keep you safe," Castiel promised, though even he was not sure of the truth in his words.
[greeneyedhunter] You can’t do that. You don’t have my number.
Oh, and Dean?
[greeneyedhunter] Is Cas short for anything?
Dean paced back and forth across Cas’ living room. His mind was going a million miles an hour and as much as he wanted to run out the front door, he couldn’t. Sure, Cas had lied to him, his best friend, flat out lied to him, but it was still Cas. No matter how badly he had messed up, Cas was his best friend, his family and Dean knew that he had never meant to hurt him, even with the stupid choices that he made.
“Dean,” Cas looked down at his plate.
[Cas] I don’t know.
“Our fans do apparently,” Castiel answers.
[angelofthursday] I am a writer.
“Then over here we have Kevin Tran, nerd extreme.” Kevin got up and shook Dean’s hand. He was a tiny Asian guy who looked no older than his son Ben but obviously he was old enough to be at this party. At least Dean hoped that he was old enough to be at this party. He had a beard which was convincing. Or, at least what appeared to be a good attempt at a beard.
[angelofthursday] You have a dirty mind, Dean.
“Yeah,” Dean looked over his best friend, who no longer looked like just his best friend. “We do.”
“Right,” Dean laughed.
But Dean?
“Cas” Dean cried out again and Cas leaned forward, his hot breath against the pelvic area above his penis. His mouth was so close, yet so far away.
"You always used to tell me I needed to learn personal space." Cas answered. "Now you are angry that I am respecting your wishes?"
“Your son?” She seemed to get less angry with him but more disgusted, like it was a horrible thing that he had a child. That is why he never shared that part of his life with people he barely knew. Though now it was helpful. Her reaction to him having a son was enough to make him not feel bad about what he was doing to her.
Once again they both hiccup, this time in unison. This causes a roar of laughter to fill the studio. Castiel shakes his head at them as he removes his glasses. Maybe if he can’t see, none of this will be real.
Dean leaned in again, only slower this time. He took his time, tasting Cas' lips against his own. Passion instead of desperation. Want instead of need. Everything he wanted in life was pinned against the door beneath him, kissing him back.
“Then you better get ready for the worst damn blow job of your life.” Dean laughed.
“Homemade or kraft?” Dean asked out of habit.
“Dean?” Castiel pushed open the front screen and gave Dean a confused look. “What are you doing here?”
If Dean was a teenager, he would definitely have gone off at this point. But he had enough strength to will himself to remain calm. It was not going to last long but it was strong enough to last him for a few minutes at least. He was not ready for this to be over, for Castiel to stop touching him.
“Wrong again,” came Castiel’s retort.
Castiel wanted to love the rain. He wanted to love the way the water sounded as it tapped against the roof or against the window. He wanted to love the way the grass smelt or even the soil from beneath. He even wanted to love the tapping sound of the tree beside his window or the way it would occasionally scrap at the glass when the wind would pick up. But he could not get any joy out of these sounds. Instead, they put him on alert and kept his eyes open for Dean. He did not always show up with the rain, but the odds were always in favor of his arrival.
[angelofthursday] Online it seems to be an ancient number.
“That is what it said,” Castiel confirms, looking at the card one more time. “Got popped.”
“Okay,” Castiel clears his throat. “This is quite a stack.”
“Sam, Jessica and Bella are all in my religion class and their grades were not where I had expected them to be, so I made a deal,” Castiel laughed while telling his story, though it was more of a nervous laugh than an amused laugh. “They were not failing by any means but they were not doing as well as I knew they could do. So I asked them what I needed to do in order to get them to step up their game and Sam suggested a party. After that it was all that I heard. When they all ended the term with As, I had to follow through.”
“Oh yeah,” Castiel laughed, leaning his head back against the wall. “When you came down my throat …”
[angelofthursday] Couldn’t pretend I was straight anymore.
“Come here.”
"I am sorry that you have lost this life, Dean." This was Cas' only response but Dean could tell that he wanted to say more.
[angelofthursday] I will make sure to ask questions of my own.
“Well, I will,” Cas leaned in and gave Dean a chaste kiss, “if you don’t take off your pants and lie down.”
Dean smiled up at Castiel, almost happy that Castiel could understand what was going on in Dean’s mind. Dean wondered if Castiel was as nervous as he was about this whole situation. He didn't appear to be nervous, but that did not mean he wasn’t.
“Okay,” Castiel sits up straight in his chair as he begins to speak again. “Charlie, can you please tell us about our first fictional work?”
“Answer me,” Castiel’s grip tightened, not enough to hurt but just enough to get Dean’s full attention. “Are you worth what I am about to do to you?”
I actually think that I might be going camping this weekend.
“It’s started,” Castiel begins to speak again between hiccups. “The hiccups have - *hiccup* - started.”
“Do you have protection?” She pulled away and whispered into his ear, pulling him back into reality. What was he doing? This is not why he came here. He did not come to this party to sleep with some college girl he barely knew in the front seat of his pickup. His son rode in his pickup.
“Understood.”
As soon as he entered his bedroom, Dean locked the door behind him. A door was not going to stop Cas from entering but the angel had learned that importance of a bedroom and that it was polite to knock at all times. Dean hoped that he took that to heart. He knew that Cas had come to him when he was sleeping many times in order to rid him of nightmares. But he hadn’t had a nightmare in a while. Had Cas still entered his room without his knowledge? Dean hoped that was not the case because Cas didn’t need to see what was about to happen.
[555-0920 | Castiel] Dean. We can't do that.
Dean continued to talk with Cas for the next couple of weeks. It was almost stupid; working to get to know someone you had known your entire life. It was a struggle at times to try and find new things to talk about. But Dean felt it was necessary. He was not ready to see Cas face-to-face just yet but he was almost not willing to lose him now. Though, he was still certain that it was not how Sam said it was. Sure, Dean’s feelings towards Castiel were far beyond that of just being friends with someone … but being in love? Dean had never looked at another guy in a non-platonic sort of way. So right now, he was just trying to figure out the way he could, or does, love Castiel.
Castiel doesn’t listen and reaches out, taking Dean by the wrist. Dean quickly brushes him off and steps away from him. Castiel wants to be hurt but he knows better than to hold anything against Dean right now.
Dean felt his heart jump into his throat. It had been three years since he had kissed someone and it was his wife. He was not sure that he could do this. He had, had plenty of time to prepare for a moment like this but he was never really sure he was ready for it to happen yet. He wanted to kiss her, he really did but could he?
“You gotta reciprocate better than that,” Dean says. “I’m dying.”
[angelofthursday] Maybe someday.
You may open up to the whole “gay” thing. (2/2)
This did not stop Dean. It only encouraged him to move forward. He repeated the motions of his mouth but decided to go a bit further. Dean reached out with his hand and lightly palmed Cas’ balls.
“Really?” Dean and Claire once again spoke at the same time.
[angelofthursday] It’s a long story.
“Oh,” Castiel whispered before looking around and sitting down. “I didn’t mean to cause a scene.”
Bella told Dean all about school. She is a law student like Sam but wants to do more to help the environment. Dean could respect that she was not in it for the money but if he were going to pay over a hundred grand to get a degree in school, it would be for a job that was going to pay him enough money to pay that back and then some. Sure, helping people and the world was nice, but money was nice too.
“Fine,” Castiel laughed for real this time. “I am currently coming over and you better have beer and hopefully a pizza on the way.”
“Now what do you see?”
“Honestly,” Dean relaxed, stepping toward Cas and clasping their hands together. “I am beyond terrified, but I want this. I am still beyond mad, which is probably not what you want to hear. But that does not stop me from loving you and wanting to move passed all this. I am not gay. But I am not straight.”
“Okay,” Castiel says as the cartoon fades and you are back in the studio watching the boys yet again. “The past couple of weeks the Angelical crew has been getting paid to find fanfiction about us. Now, it is time for us to read it.”
Strange name but I can dig it.
Dean watched until Castiel was completely inside his home before driving off. Part of him wanted to head to his mothers to pick up Ben. Though he would never admit it, he hated when Ben was not home with him. But he knew Ben was excited to be staying with his grandparents, so he left him be. He decided that maybe it was time to call it a night.
“Reading fanfiction on the internet is as 2000 and late as saying 2000 and late.” Both Dean and Castiel stop to laugh at the joke. “So, we gamified it.”
Cas began to slowly work Dean’s cock in and out of his mouth, stopping at the tip and pushing his tongue again the slit. Dean’s body began to shake and Cas took this as encouragement, taking Dean’s cock until it was pushed against the back of his throat. He than began to pick up speed, fucking Dean’s cock with his mouth in a way that no one had ever done. And then Dean was coming. He meant to warn him but it hit him so fast he did not have time to react. Cas was ready though, holding Dean deep into his mouth and taking all of it. He was taking fucking all of it. Fuck!
“Your friend seems nice,” Ben told his dad as he got into bed. “He is a little weird but still, he seems nice.”
[greeneyedhunter] That may actually be true.
"Dean." Cas stepped forward and began to reach out to him but stopped. "I don't understand. You aren't making any sense."
“I think Dean has some broken ribs,” Sam informed Cas.
“I am glad you did.”
“I wanted you to smile,” Castiel all but whispered.
“Hey Dean,” Jess smiled over at Dean, wrapping her arms around Sam. Dean liked Jess, she was sweet and really cared about Sam. Even now in his drunken state, Dean could see the love that she had for him radiating off of her. He used to get that look from Lisa and hoped that people noticed him giving it back. He was so happy his brother got to have that kind of love.
[greeneyedhunter] Prison?
“Good Angelical Morning,” Castiel says into the camera, but there is none of the usual excitement that he puts on for the viewers.
“Yes,” Castiel smiled. “You are.”
Good evening, Cas.
Castiel laughed and smiled at Ellen when she brought them another beer. He drank half of it, his hands sort of fidgeting and Dean began to feel bad. He had made Castiel uncomfortable. That was not his intentions at all.
“Sexy,” Cas deadpans.
But Dean didn’t say anything. Castiel had messed up, this was proof of it. Dean didn’t know how to tell him that he was not interested.
He was still not completely sure about Castiel. They seemed like completely different people, yet they got along so well. They had little things in common but took interest in the things the other one liked, eager to experience things that were not their own lives. Maybe that is what they needed. Dean needed a friend to get him out of his slump. He was always at home or at work, now he could get out of that. Castiel needed Dean because he was new and he did not really know many people. They could make a decent friendship if they really gave it a shot.
“Dean,” Castiel finally turned around to face his best friend. It was at that moment he realized they both had tears in their eyes. Why was Dean crying? Was it because he just realized that he was going to lose his best friend?
Now was the real problem. Did he not show up tomorrow and lose a small part of Dean or did he show up, admit to him the truth, and potentially lose all of Dean?
“She is a pleasant one,” Castiel laughed. “Isn't she?”
As soon as he was finished, Dean headed home. He kicked off his boots, grabbed his one beer out of the fridge and settled onto the couch. There was not really a lot on but that did not stop him from picking up the remote and flipping through the channels. People used to get so mad at him. He was not really a person to sit and watch a whole show. He watched five minutes of one show and then two minutes of another. Nothing ever really caught his attention long enough for him to stick with it. In fact, the only time he ever sat through an entire show or movie was when he was watching it with someone else. Even then, he didn’t quite pay full attention.
Off in the distance, Dean could see something that resembled a house but as he got closer to it, he realized that it was a barn. There were no animals to signify that a barn should be here or a house for its owner to live, it was just a barn. It takes him forever to figure out how to get the door open, pushing and pulling with all of his strength and yet it does not budge.
“I can live with staying,” Ruby, who had been silent through this whole ordeal, agreed.
It took longer than he had hoped for. Castiel knew that it was the nerves keeping him awake. He counted sheep and took great notice of his breathing. But nothing was working. He was about to give up and try something else, like reading, when the fairy reached out and placed his hand on Castiel’s forehead. Suddenly, the world was dark.
That isn’t fair.
“Uh, Cas,” Dean spoke, a slight stutter in his voice.
It did not take long for Dean to adjust to the new situation and sensations. He wanted Castiel and he was not going to let the mysteries of kissing a man stand in his way, not this time. He was not going to run away from these feelings. They were the most real thing that he had felt in a very long time.
“You don’t look like a loser to me,” Dean flirted at her. He was rusty in his flirting skills but he did not feel like he was doing too badly. She was laughing and flirting back, giving him the batted eye lashes and shy hair twirls. Yet somehow, he was still not enjoying himself. “Way too pretty to be a loser.”
[angelofthursday] I take it you enjoyed the Harry Potter Series.
Dean turned on his coffee pot as soon as he got home. He knew his work load and had decided to not go to sleep. He was not really that tired and knew that he could make it through at least half of the day. So, he was going to work half day and then cut out early. Dean never missed work or went home early, so he figured that this one time would not hurt. Other guys at the shop seemed to call out all the time. It was Dean’s turn.
“The internet is a powerful thing,” Dean admitted.
“Well, I prefer homemade,” Cas shook his head. “But since I knew you were coming over, I opted for Kraft.”
Cas teased lightly at Dean’s balls, running his fingers over them softly, exploring Dean. He then worked them into the palm of his hand, kneading them ever so gently. It was almost too gentle for Dean’s liking and if it was anyone other than Cas, he would be vocal about it. But he was already on the verge of an orgasm and damn if Cas’ fingers didn’t feel like heaven against his skin.
This isn’t funny Bitch!
Dean walked over to the keg, grabbed himself a red solo cup and filled it to the brim. If he was going to be here, he was going to be drunk. Maybe if he put more alcohol in his system than he did the last time, he would be able to let go and have a better time. Lack of alcohol could really ruin a good time when you are surrounded by drunk people. Live by the rule: If you can’t beat them, join them. That is exactly what he was going to do.
But there were never any monsters in the closet. When the monster in their lives finally came, it was Dean. Monster in the next bed. Poor Sam had been afraid of the wrong thing for so long he never expected it when the real evil showed its face.
“I made a list of the types of gifts we should get each other,” Dean said. “I thought it would be fun to have a kind of theme.”
“Or we all leave,” Meg joined in as well. “And you will walk your ass home. Got it?”
Leaning down, Dean kissed at Cas' stomach, rolling his tongue occasionally over the skin. The sounds Cas made at this action made Dean so hard he hurt. He wanted to take his time with Cas, make it perfect. But considering how excited he was and how inexperienced Cas was, neither of them was bound to last long.
You and Sam both suck.
[555-0920 | Castiel] Maybe.
“Like how you love me?”
[angelofthursday] I am sorry for your loss as well.
[greeneyedhunter] So, where were we?
“Pants,” Cas instructed with authority. “Now.”
“No,” Dean sighs. “Don’t do that.”
[greeneyedhunter] Couldn’t pretend to happy in your marriage?
“We didn’t actually do it though,” Dean fought. “We are supposed to actually do it.”
“I know you do,” Cas leaned over and kissed him. “But it won’t be … uh … necessary.”
[angelofthursday] I have had time to become okay with it.
“What does that mean?” Castiel questioned.
“Well,” Dean laughed, moving his arm and sliding it slightly behind her. “Sammy has a way of making people do things. Guess it is a good thing he is becoming a lawyer.”
“So,” Cas nearly fumbles over his words, “you like it?”
[greeneyedhunter] Don’t really get out much.
Dean smiled down at the man in his bed and then climbed in himself and reached over to turn off the light. They laid in silence, only their arms touching.
“I feel like my right nipple is gonna spout fire,” Castiel says as he rubs his chest. “My left nipple is fine. Right nipple … fire.”
“Such a what?” Castiel asked, as he took a few pushes and pulls to fully bottom out inside of Dean. “I couldn’t hear you.”
Come on Angel. I can’t find you just knowing what town you are in. So, even if I am some psycho killer, knowing your town doesn’t give anything away. I don’t even know your name for fuck's sake.
Castiel growled and Dean knew that he had succeeded. Castiel would not be able to resist Dean any longer, knowing that he had gotten from him just what he had set out to receive.
“No,” Castiel told Dean before turning back to Meg. “I will call you later okay. I promise.”
“I will be right back,” Castiel began to slide out of the booth. “Bathroom break.”
“No,” Dean shook his head, reaching up and rubbing the back of his neck with his hand. “I don’t need time. I want us to try this.”
“Yes, cause a cup full of sugar is so much better.”
“Why not?” Castiel asked. “You love me. I love you. Sex is fun, or so I hear. Why shouldn’t we?”
_ _ _ _ _ _
“Hey,” Dean stepped forward and pulled Castiel into a hug. It was tighter than Dean had originally intended it to be but neither of them tried to stop it once it had started. “Relax okay. We are just getting a drink. We have gotten many drinks.”
“Yeah,” Castiel confirms. “He said that. So, in exchange for naming your child after me, and mailing these…”
“Meeting a friend,” Dean pulled a seat up at the bar while he waited for Castiel to arrive. Castiel was not supposed to be here for another twenty minutes or so, so he had some time to kill. He was always the one to arrive early, it was the one thing that he prided himself in.
Dean was running out of rituals and spells. He was getting closer to the end of his month and he feared his death. He had died before but that didn’t mean that every time he died he was going to come back. What if this was the one that stuck? What if in a week’s time he was going to be dead and Sam was going to be all alone?
“Then be a good boy and get onto your knees,” Castiel instructed further. “You can hold yourself up on your arms too if you like or lay against the pillow, but I want that ass in the air, understand.”
What are you looking for on here?
And then he was moving again, Cas pulling him up and off his feet before pushing him back against the wall of the shower. Dean wrapped his arms and legs around his angel, his cock now firmly held between their bodies. If only there was some friction, Dean would be cumming between the both of them, but there was nothing, just Cas pressed against him.
Dean sighed as Baby roared to life and pulled her out onto the road. He made sure to be extra careful with her. With his emotions running high, the last thing that he needed to do was be reckless with his car. Two good things ruined in one day would be more than Dean could handle.
[greeneyedhunter] I lost my father a few years ago. I know moving on doesn’t really make it easier.
[angelofthursday] Movies are actually the one thing that drag me out of my house.
The panic of what he had done only increased by the time Castiel crawled back in through his bedroom window, the fairy safely tucked into his pocket. Where was he even supposed to keep this thing? If he were to keep it where he kept the rest of his marketplace findings, it would surely die. With every moment that passed, this was seeming to be the worst decision he ever made. No wonder he hasn't been deemed fit for his crown yet.
Dean took a few deep breaths and put a smile on his face, though he could feel just how fake it was. Hopefully, Cas would not notice how fake Dean was forcing himself to be.
“This first piece of fanfic,” Charlie’s voice can be heard from behind the camera, “is from the author ‘lovemuppet’ and it’s called ‘100% Corn Fed.’ Sounds wholesome and country to me.”
Where in Kansas?
Castiel left Dean in the middle of the room and stepped into their walk-in closet on the other side of the room. After a minute, he came back out holding a medium-sized box in his hands.
Are you ready now?
"So, I go to sleep and you talk to me?" Castiel wasn't sure how that was going to help them.
I don’t want to accidentally open the door.
[angelofthursday] Why do you need to apologize?
Dean was not sad that he and Lisa got pregnant when they were only fifteen. He loved Lisa and Ben more than anything in the world. So, when they turned eighteen and Dean ask Lisa to marry him, it was not out of necessity, it was out of love. He still loved her to this day, even though she was no longer with them. Maybe that is why he could not seem to bring himself to date. The one person in this world that he was meant to be with had died and that was it for him. Now his world was focusing on Ben and making sure that he grew up into a man that Lisa would be proud of. So far, Dean was not doing that bad of a job, though his grades could be better.
It was perfect. This entire night was perfect.
I'm sorry for this chapter.
I have to go.
“I apologize.” He responded, taking a slight step back from Dean but not enough to make a difference.
“You can-” Dean begins but stops to swallow. “I’m gonna try to do this. Okay, You know what time it is?”
“She is in class.”
“I know we have a lot to work on,” Dean confirmed. “Trust is a hard thing but I know that I can trust you, but forgetting is hard also. I am working through what happened but I am no longer mad at you. I love you too damn much to be mad at you. But, I can’t promise you forever.”
“Yeah, I think so too,” Dean smiled, flicking off the light. “Night buddy,”
“Maybe.” Cas nodded as he crawled himself onto Dean’s lap, wrapping his arms around his neck. “Would be funny to have Meg make him walk home.”
“Dean,” Castiel was panicked, his heart racing as the machines started to go crazy. “Dean?”
“You are so beautiful,” Castiel whispered.
Dean stumbled backwards, fear rising in his stomach. He thought that what had happened had caught up with Castiel and he couldn’t handle it. He was going to leave.
Normally, he would never venture to the places in the back. Those were the ones filled with dark magic and possible danger. If he were to be hurt and not return to his palace, his Kingdom would be lost forever to the hands of Michael. He could not allow that to happen. But today, his curiosity got the best of him.
“You can’t be sad,” Dean tells him, grabbing Cas’s chin and forcing him to look at him. “You still have one more gift.”
[angelofthursday] As a matter of fact, I have.
[greeneyedhunter] That is the most thrilling thing that has ever happened to me.
“Cas,” Sam yelled as soon as they entered the hotel room. “Dean needs your help.”
“For the rest of your forever,” Castiel whispered in his ear.
Dean was not ready to leave Cas yet but it was getting late and he needed to work in the morning. He tried to come up with a good exit strategy but it came and went and soon, it was three in the morning and they were sitting in baby, talking about everything they could come up with. They talked about memories from their childhood and their young adult lives. This soon turned into conversations about love and what all of this meant for them. Dean was not sure what to think, he just hoped that Castiel had some idea.
Cas wondered so much about Dean as he looked over his fragile body. He looked physically better. The bruises had faded and the cuts were almost completely gone. It was the things on the inside that held all of the damage. Typical Dean, keeping all of the pain on the inside.
There was a moment of silence while they both looked Dean over in the mirror. It was uncomfortable at first but soon, it becomes something a little more intense. Castiel was not simply looking him over, he was taking him in, devouring him with his eyes. Dean could feel his cheeks grow flush from the attention.
“I am okay.” Castiel smiled up Dean with a genuine smile. “We still talk and I am glad that she is finally able to be happy. She will always be that wild and crazy love story I got to have once upon a time. Like something out of a movie or book.”
I am not unattractive. I am just not what you would be expecting.
“Yes,” Dean answered with a nod.
[greeneyedhunter] Nope.
“Dean,” Castiel growled at his husband. “Words are no excuse for violence.”
It was good. Finished a paper for class. Now just relaxing with a glass of wine.
But that didn’t help.
“And do what in the Volcano?”
“Are you always this rude?” The man looked Dean dead in the eyes, almost causing him to stumble back but he caught himself just in time.
“But we didn’t actually do what needed to be done,” Dean argued. “You can’t leave. I can’t die.”
“Many steps ahead of you, man,” Dean informed him. “See you when you get here.”
Castiel laughed at Dean’s words.
Dean had spent the week texting Castiel here and there. He had been busy with work and Castiel was teaching two classes this summer, which kept him busy with grading papers and doing whatever else it was that teachers did. Dean tried not to ask too much in the way of school. Not that Dean was a stupid person, he was not a school person.
"I'm sorry Sam," Dean whispered into the empty room.
“You are so beautiful,” Cas breathed, his fingers finally hitting between Dean’s legs and grazing lightly over his balls.
“No, I just,” Dean felt like shit admitting this but he had to be honest. “I was so angry that you didn’t show up and now I feel like a complete ass about the whole thing.”
Yeah?
[angelofthursday] No. We divorced only a year after getting married.
Dean nodded and Castiel stepped back, giving Dean room to remove his clothes. First, he took off his jeans, tossing them to where his shirt was laying. He hesitated when he got to his boxers, stopping to look at Castiel who was eyeing him intently.
[greeneyedhunter] So, do you use your real name for your books?
“That hurt a little bit,” Dean says as he rubs where he had hit on his chest.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean tried not to yell at his best friend, who was now standing too close for comfort. “You need to knock or something. Make some noise.”
“Okay, next one,” Dean interrupted Cas reading the back of the book.
“If we can’t make this work,” Cas motioned between the two of them, “promise me that we won’t ever stop being friends. You have been my best friend for nearly all my life. Losing that seems like it would be worse than …” Dean took a deep breath. He understood. Losing Cas completely would be worse than, “Death,” they spoke the word together.
“Okay,” Dean sat himself back on his legs.
[greeneyedhunter] Are you in prison or something?
“You couldn’t tell me to my face?”
Soon the kissing became more passionate and hard. Castiel was kissing Dean back with intensity, working on pulling Dean’s AC/DC shirt off of his body. Dean lifted his arms to help, only disconnecting their lips long enough to get the shirt up over his head. They did not have to stop kissing for Dean to remove Castiel’s dark blue button up shirt. It took longer, but that only made Dean more excited once he got it off and tossed to the ground.
“Hey boys,” Ellen called out over the bar to the both of them, grabbing their attention. “The bar closed five minutes ago. As much as I would love for you guys to keep on chatting here, you can’t. So get out.”
[greeneyedhunter] Unless you want me to go away.
“Eggs,” a woman to Castiel's left yelled, pulling him from his thoughts.
[angelofthursday] I would prefer you to just disappear and not get mean with me.
“You are going,” Sam informed him and Dean grumbled. Ever since they were younger they had been making each other do things they didn’t want to do. It was sort of an unwritten law among them. When one of the finalized it, unless they had a life or death excuse, they had to do it.
“Yes,” Dean laughs. He leans in and presses a soft and short kiss to Cas’ mouth. “Sleep now before you turn into Mr. Hyde.”
[555-0920 | Castiel] Would you do something for me?
“I am interested in your fairy.” Castiel finally finished his sentence.
"You are all I have left Cas." Dean stepped closer, pushing Cas until his back was against the wall. "We are all we have left. Please, just be with me. I need you."
“Yes, that it is,” Castiel agreed.
But what?
[angelofthursday] No. I use a pen name.
“Serious?” Dean asks when he sees the gift, a gingerbread house kit. “I haven’t done one of these since I was a kid.”
Castiel took the cup from Dean, looking it over. This was his drink order. Why was Dean ordering him a drink? Did he mention something as Jimmy and Dean decided to give it to him since Jimmy hadn’t arrived?
[angelofthursday] One night with me and you’ll never want another penis again.
Moving his hands to Castiel’s back, he pulled his body in and began to kiss down Cas’ neck. He tasted warm, if that could even be considered a taste. His skin radiating heat against Dean’s lips as Dean kissed from Castiel’s neck to his chest. Dean was slightly taken aback by the chest hair, not because it bothered him but because it was new, something he never imagined he would be pressing his lips against.
[angelofthursday] I do not tend to join in often.
[angelofthursday] Really?
[angelofthursday] At times.
[angelofthursday] These days, think about what I am writing.
“Wow good?”
[angelofthursday] Of course you are.
“That is okay,” Dean nodded. “Tomorrow you teach me the internet. Then I can just email you what I want to say.”
[greeneyedhunter] Okay. That is crazy.
[angelofthursday] Really?
“I agree,” Castiel informed his husband. “But violence is never the answer.”
[angelofthursday] People have sued for all sorts of crazy things and won.
“Good,” She moved closer to him and smiled up at him from her red solo cup. Dean could tell by the look in her eyes that she had been drinking quite a bit. He was not sure what to think about that really. You never knew what to expect of college girls. This could end up well or it could end up incredibly bad.
He has really been in love with me for that long?
“No,” Cas shook his head. “I did it because I couldn’t figure out how to make you smile. Though, I think I wouldn’t have cared so much if I didn’t love you.”
Can’t tonight man, have a date.
“Be here for me,” Castiel cries again.
_____
Dean wanted to answer him but he couldn't. Talking could ruin all of this and he wasn't ready for this moment to be over, so he pretended to be asleep. They could discuss things tomorrow. No consequences tonight. That's all he wanted.
_____
Dean shook his head at Castiel but walked passed him and into the front walkway of Castiel’s house. It was dark inside, even though Castiel had turned on a light. There was not much around him, almost as if Castiel had not even moved in yet. It was possible that he did not get much stuff in the divorce, though by the way he described Meg, she really was not the type to want or have stuff. Maybe they just never had stuff.
Once the introductions were completed, Dean went back to cooking up the steaks. He then went into the house to grab the potato salad and green beans. Dean loved to cook and would usually make whatever was being eaten at a BBQ. However, this was unplanned and he had no time to prep, so it was store bought everything for the evening. Castiel did not seem to mind.
After the show was over, Dean excused himself to get Ben off to bed. Dean did not really need to get Ben off to bed but he felt like he needed to since he had company. Ben was generally very capable of putting himself to bed.
“I promise to return soon.” Castiel grabbed his satchel and threw it over his shoulder. “Is there anything you would like for me to pick up from the market for you?”
[greeneyedhunter] That is not even the craziest part.
Castiel got dressed as soon as he realized Dean was gone. He was not going to let Dean feel like any of this was his fault and he was certain his best friend was already blaming himself. Dean had too many things in his life he blamed himself for, Castiel’s failed relationship was not going to be one of them.
“Yeah, yeah,” Castiel laughed, leaning in and kissing Dean quick and gentle. “You are still pretty smooth.”
“Multiple times this month I have been called.” Castiel informed him. “It’s strong too. Sometimes I can push your voice away to focus on whatever I am doing. But lately, when you call me, the pull is too strong and I suddenly wind up here, in front of a very angry you. Are you angry with me?”
I don’t think that I would even call you bi-sexual.
It was salty and a little over powering. Definitely not something that would go down in the books of things Dean enjoyed having in his mouth. But it was not as bad as he had imagined. It was possible that at some point, he would be able to get Cas come in his mouth. But now was not that time.
“Good work,” Dean breathed out to Cas, working to not make eye contact. “Guess we can head home. Or I can head home and you can head back to heaven.”
[greeneyedhunter] Okay. Um, I guess, how was your day?
Castiel stumbled against Dean, he seemed reluctant at first but then excitedly followed wherever it was that he was being lead. Castiel soon was right along with Dean, his hands moving up Dean’s sides as Dean held the back of Castiel’s neck, pushing his tongue into the eager waiting mouth of Castiel. A voice in Dean’s head told him he needed to stop, that this was not right but he pushed past his insecurities.
[angelofthursday] I suppose I can do that.
"Cas," Dean leaned in, wrapping his arm around Cas. "Will you stay with me tonight?"
[greeneyedhunter] Okay. But remember. You swore you would tell me someday
“I do?”
“Cas,” Dean breathed out again as he reached down and gripped Cas’ hair into his hands.
Can I maybe see your penis?
Once Dean believed that he had worked Castiel up enough, he reached in through the hole in the front of his boxers and pulled his cock out. Dean was not one to guess the length of a cock just by looking at it but he would say that it was at least six, maybe six and a half inches, about the same size as his own. That made him a little more comfortable, it was a size he knew how to deal with, from his own personal times with himself.
[angelofthursday] That is the second. You are a fan. You know who I am.
It’s okay. As I said, it’s better now.
“Yeah?”
_____
[angelofthursday] No, I am not in prison. I have never even gotten a parking ticket.
“No,” Castiel admitted, trying not to make eye contact with Ruby who was staring him down. He could feel her eyes burning a hole into the side of his head but he did not care. “I think I am headed home though, so you two have a good night.”
“Hey,” Bella greeted Dean as he approached her. He was still not sure if this was a good idea or not, but since he got stood up by his friend, what else was he to do? He could have gone home but he was not going to bail on his brother like that again. Plus, there was no beer at his house.
If you leave it in the living room, I can come pick it up while you are at work.
“Fuck,” Dean sunk down the wall when Cas pulled off of his cock, leaving them face to face. Cas leaned in and kissed him passionately, all teeth and tongue and ragged breathes. “That was.”
“You’re evil,” Dean laughed.
“I did what I needed to do,” she answered calmly. “You can break the spell.”
Is putting him through hell making you feel better?
“You introduced me as your best friend.”
[greeneyedhunter] Got a crush on your best friend Cas?
What do we need to talk about?
“This is about me and you,” Dean tells Castiel.
“Dean?”
“Tell me how you want to use my tie,” Castiel urges him on.
“Hello,” the voice on the other end of the phone spoke. His voice was deep, deeper than Dean had remembered it being only a few days ago. “Dean?”
“And don’t you forget it,” Dean chuckled.
They sat in silence for a few minutes before their beers arrived. Neither of them knew what to say and as much as Dean hated the awkward feeling, he was not sure how to get passed it. So, he decided to go with small talk.
Dean hesitated, unsure if what he thought he should do was really something he could do. He was not sure if he was ready to put Castiel into his mouth. He wanted to make him happy but he just did not know how to do this. He was going to fail.
Dean pulled himself up to a standing position and leaned into Castiel, pressing his lips firmly against the slightly shaking teacher. Castiel moaned against Dean’s lips as Dean continued to stroke at his penis, which was now held between their bare stomachs. Dean knew that Castiel was getting close and that caused him to kiss him harder, pushing his tongue wildly into the mouth of Castiel.
Dean finished up what he was working on and then made his way into the break room to get cleaned up. He hated making customers wait but he also liked to be slightly clean when interacting with the public. Dirty and greasy was expected of a mechanic but still, he liked to look like he was not just some dirty man who worked on cars. Even if that was all he really was.
“I can’t do this,” Castiel says, grabbing his chest and then stretching his arms out. “Every breath out is like time travel - *hiccup* - into a stupid, stupid place.”
“I must be returning to heaven,” Castiel said with a saddened tone. “They are calling for me.”
Castiel followed the silent command for a minute before he pushed his head forward and slipped the tip of Dean’s penis into his mouth. Dean’s entire body stiffened against the car, except for his hips which jumped forward towards Castiel. Dean knew he was not going to last long.
[greeneyedhunter] That explains your username.
“Oh,” Cas said in that small voice that Dean hated. “Okay.”
“Fuck,” he murmured to himself again. This time the word came out empty. He was no longer angry, he was just scared.
Dean hated all of this. He hated not seeing his best friend. He hated having feelings that he did not understand and couldn’t control. He hated all of this. The only thing he didn’t hate was Cas.
"Cas," Dean spoke after a while of waiting. If Cas was still awake, it would seem like Dean had just woken up. But Cas didn't answer. Instead, Dean was met with quiet snores. "I love you too Cas. I love you too."
[angelofthursday] This is very true.
Dean picks up his next card, clearing his throat for the millionth time.
“You will not be able to afford it,” she laughed, heading back up the steps of her cart.
“What did you do to me?” Dean asked Rowena angrily on the phone. “I have put off killing you but I will do it if I have to.”
“I am a teacher here,” He answered, almost not wanting to admit it. Teachers were not really supposed to party with their students but here he was. Dean had to look him over a little closer. He did not look like the cool teacher who comes to parties or sleeps with his female students, though Dean knew to never really judge a book by its cover. People had a way of surprising you.
“What can I do?” Dean asks.
Castiel looked over his friend, though he was so much more than that. He did not know how to say what Dean was. He was the human that made him question his existence as an angel. He is the human that made him question God, his father that he had followed blindly for all of his eternity. He was the human that he had clipped his wings for. Was that the definition of just being a friend?
“No,” Dean finally pulls away and pushes Castiel back. “We’re not in the tribe yet, but we were boys, and they were like, ‘Listen, we’re gonna give you guys these hats and we’re gonan give you these peppers and you’re gonna eat them and you’re gonna put these hats on, and after that, you’ll be men.”
[angelofthursday] No … but he is British.
“Favorite snacks,” Dean announces.
"Okay," Cas nodded. "Okay Dean."
"See," she spoke with a smile in her voice, one that he could see when she finally came into view and made her way to the other side of the bed. "I told you that miracles happen."
“There is someone out there who requires your assistance.”
“I was trying to be nice,” Castiel spoke with a monotone voice.
“Dean,” Cas reached up and began to unbutton his pants. “I am going to touch your cock and you are going to promise to stop me if it becomes too much. Understand?”
“YEAH,” Dean continues yelling as he stands up and jumps around. “We don’t need no ice cream.”
Dean looked over at Bella sitting across the way. Once she noticed she was being looked at, she smiled up at him. She really was a stunning woman, even though she had to be at the least twenty-one and at the most twenty-three. Dean was not against younger women, he just had a kid and girls who were younger did not seem to appreciate that fact about him. Though, he was not asking the girl to be Ben’s new mom, he was just supposed to talk to her.
“Then I guess you better stand in front of that mirror.”
“I need to find out what happened.” Dean took them slightly off-topic. “Whether this crazy theory is right or not. I need to find out what happened to my brother Cas.”
Castiel didn’t say anything. He stepped back from Dean, never breaking eye contact and slowly began to remove his clothes, until he was standing in front of Dean, completely naked. Dean was sure that he would have a heart attack, except he was young and completely healthy, well, maybe not completely healthy.
So the fingers continued, slowly working their way in and out of him, driving him almost to the edge but it wasn’t enough. Dean was leaking all over the sheet beneath him and knew that if he looked down it would be nothing more than a puddle. It was too much, he needed to cum, he had to, his body was screaming for it.
“Hey Bella,” Dean smiled at her. He was not really sure how to start a conversation with a girl. Lisa and he had basically been together their entire lives, he never had to work at it before.
[angelofthursday] Yes, Dean?
Please don’t.
Obviously not.
“Okay,” Cas kept a smile on his face but it did not shine as bright as it had moments ago.
[greeneyedhunter] Then let’s continue having it.
Dean slams his fist against his chest in a very ape-like manner and Castiel cannot help but admire the man who is sitting beside him about to do this horribly stupid act. At least they are doing this together. They are always doing this together and somehow, that makes it a little easier. He still doesn’t want to do it, but having Dean by his side always helps.
“But,” Dean takes over, noticing Castiel getting off track. “You can use water to help get it down if you’re having trouble getting it down. You can do that. It is part of the rules. If you need water to help you get it down, you can do that as opposed to throwing it back up or something.”
“I uh,” Dean’s smile faded and his face became more serious. “I didn’t think you were going to show.”
Dean set his phone down and idly began to clean up his desk. He needed to keep himself busy or else he was going to start over thinking all of this. Maybe he should log back in and see if she was back online. They could work all of this out. Maybe it was an accident that she had logged out and she was just waiting for him.
More than anything.
“Dean,” his mom stopped him before he pulled out of the driveway. “Promise me that you will try to have fun.”
You know that girl I have been talking to online for almost a year? Angel.
He set the cup down, deciding that drinking coffee was not the best option at this time. He needed to keep his mouth clear.
Once he was done eating, Castiel knew that it was time. The nerves in his stomach were turning and he felt that he may be sick. He knew, almost for certain, that he was not going to be murdered, but the whole thing still seemed a little strange to him. Was the fairy going to enter his mind? How much of what was inside of Castiel’s head could he see? Probably all of it, considering he had already proved that the had the ability to read his thoughts. But what about the things that were buried deeper? Could he see it all?
“Oh man,” Dean pulled back from the car with a smile. “I am going to have to teach you. I live for cars. If you can’t tell by my car and by my job.”
Castiel and Dean laughed together. It was a feeling that Dean had not had in a while. He had laughed but they had all been faked to play a part. Tonight was not a complete waste if the one thing that he got from it was a laugh and from a suited teacher no less.
Dean logged back into the computer but it showed Cas as being offline. They needed to get away from the internet thing anyways. It was time. Charlie was right, as she usually was. He would never tell her that though; she would never let him forget it.
_ _ _ _ _ _
“But you know that isn’t true either.” Dean reminded him.
“It’s okay, Dean,” Castiel interrupted him. He didn’t want Dean to have to explain any of this to him. Castiel was a big boy. He knew that Dean did not want this from him but got lost in the moment. He was happy to have the moment they shared but knew it was a fluke in their way of life. “You don’t have to explain, I understand.”
"I dreamt," Dean finally spoke to Cas. "It felt so real. I'm still having trouble believing that it wasn't."
“Wouldn’t be what?” Castiel asked after Dean didn’t complete his sentence and the silence grew thick between them.
Probably not.
"I don't…" Cas began but his words trailed off.
“I didn’t want you to see how hard I was,” Dean admitted.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice yelled out over the yard of the fraternity house. It was littered with little red cups and college student’s laughing and having a good time. College seemed to be the only place where people could get away with things like that. Fraternities had their own laws in the world of college. If the cops were called, something seriously bad was going down. Maybe they figured that good college students couldn’t get into too much trouble. They were wrong but turning the other cheek was a thing with cops around here.
"I know that in your dream you loved me," Cas continued to speak anyway. "But you didn't love me before. Maybe one day you will truly love me like you think you did. And if that day comes, I will be here. If that day never comes, I will still be here. Because I love you Dean. From the very first moment I saw your soul, I knew you would be the reason I would fall. The greatest reason of all. I love you Dean Winchester. I have always loved you and I will always love you."
[angelofthursday] Don’t push it, Dean.
I am on my way.
[angelofthursday] You are trying to look me up, aren’t you?
[angelofthursday] And I will.
“I am fine, Sammy.” Dean nearly growled but kept his voice under control. “He isn’t my personal doctor.”
[angelofthursday] Well, not me personally.
Dean took a seat on the couch next to Bella and Kevin. They were all talking about classes that they were taking this summer to fill some credit requirements. Dean would have thought they would want to go home for the summer, but school was obviously a full time gig these days. Dean was not the biggest fan of school, so college had always been out of the question. He tried to keep up the best that he could but mainly he felt like the person who wore bright colors to a funeral.
[555-0920 | Castiel] Yes
[greeneyedhunter] Now, on to my next questions.
The fairy looked up at him and nodded before sitting himself down. It was at that moment that Castiel realized what he had just done. He had bought a fairy. What was he supposed to do with an injured fairy?
“Talk to me,” Dean sat back in his chair, his voice demanding, though he had not really meant for it to be. But something was up and this needed to end. “What is going on?”
“And go,” Charlie calls again.
See you soon.
“Well, a little of me got in there as well.”
“I know.”
[greeneyedhunter] She demanded that I be the one who fix it.
He was walking in the middle of nowhere, nothing but grassland and trees. It was quiet, not even a bug to buzz in his ears. The sun was hanging hot overhead and there was not a cloud to be seen.
[greeneyedhunter] All things in life are a risk.
“Cas,” Dean breathed out heavily, unable to control himself. “I can’t.”
Dean spent the next few hours talking about the world his brain had conjured up when he was in his coma. He had to take many breaks giving his voice time to rest when it became overly raspy and broken. He didn't leave out any detail, including the parts that involved Castiel. He knew it would be risky but Dean felt like he had lost his entire life twice and holding things in didn't feel right anymore. What was the point in lying when he could lose his life again at any moment.
Dean had worked it out with his boss to get off on Friday and not come back until Tuesday. He figured an extra day off with Cas wouldn't hurt.
“Just got off work,” Castiel informed him. “Was thinking I could come chill or something.”
“Twitter is always serious,” Dean agrees.
[greeneyedhunter] Because I feel I may start hitting on you.
Whatever.
I wish you were here.
“I knew you would like it as soon as I saw the pictures,” Sam laughed, tossing his duffle onto one of the beds. “Are you ready to get this party started?”
“I’m sorry,” he helped her off of him and got out of his truck quickly. He all but ran to the other side and opened the door for her. “I don’t mean to do this but I just remembered something I had to do for my son.”
The thought jumped into his mind without warning. Maybe it was a therapist he needed and not a massage.
Dean frowned at Castiel’s message. Not because Cas had said something wrong, it was more that Dean really did not want to go to this party and now he had a reason to go.
“Yeah right,” Dean confirms. “Okay, your turn.”
A giant one.
“She was missing the embarrassing trench coat and backward tie,” Dean joined in on the laughter but there was something else in his voice that Castiel couldn’t place.
Taking a deep breath, Dean let out a sigh. It no longer hurt to breathe or move. He was sure if he looked into a mirror, even the minor cuts and scrapes would be gone from his body as well.
Again, Dean wanted to fight but he didn’t. He was too excited and he trusted Castiel in whatever it was that he was getting ready to do. As much as he hated to jump the gun, he could already feel his cock filling out between his legs.
“Castiel James Novak,” Dean smiles down at him. “Will you marry me?”
To Dean’s amazement, the teacher was dressed down for their drinking extravaganza. He had lost his suit and tie for a pair of dark blue jeans, a red t-shirt and a pair of black and white converse. Dean was happy to see him this way. He looked a little more normal and a little less stuffy professor. There was hope for a friendship yet. Not that Dean goes around judging people based on the clothes they wore.
“No,” Balthazar puffed himself up, trying to intimidate Dean. “Maybe there is a reason he didn't tell anyone about you. Maybe he was looking for a way out. And when he finally gets out, I'll be waiting.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said in his normal, raspy, sex filled voice.
"I know that it is hard for you to talk about," she continued when it became clear that he was not going to talk to her, yet again. "But I think, no, I believe that if you can allow yourself to talk about it, you'll feel better."
Dean was a work-a-holic and Ben was more interested in playing with his friends or playing his video games than want to spend time with his boring dad. When Dean found out that Lisa was pregnant, even though they were only fifteen, he thought that the only good thing was that he was going to be close in age to his son. They would be able to relate to one another. He was wrong. No one on this earth made Dean feel as old as Ben did.
No. You don’t.
[greeneyedhunter] Whoa. Slow down there. I didn’t say I didn’t want to talk to you.
“Come again?”
“I never do.”
“I am so glad that you made it,” Sam pulled Dean under his arm and squeezed him. “I have a surprise for you.”
[greeneyedhunter] My name is Dean Winchester and I live in Lawrence, Kansas.
“Then how come every time I do a spell to summon my soul mate, you appear?” Dean questioned.
He made his way through his room, taking off his clothes as he went. He changed himself into his night clothes and made his way to the washroom to groom himself before bed. If there was one thing that Castiel prided himself on, it was cleanliness.
“Together?” Dean was confused.
He has not been in love with me for 20 years.
Shouldn’t you wait to do that until you get here?
[angelofthursday] Jealous?
“I am not crazy either,” Castiel informed Dean. “I know that I sounded like a rambling mad man in there, but I believe what I said. As crazy as I am aware that it sounded.”
Castiel looked up from Dean and gave a smile to Grace, Dean’s main nurse. She was not really the main nurse, she just seemed to always be the one who was here whenever Castiel was around. Dean had been here for three months, working to get better. Castiel wanted to be by his side but he used his time to search over the earth for answers. Being an ex-angel did not give him an advantage. He was still empty handed and Dean was still dying.
[greeneyedhunter] I want to own my own shop one day.
"Dean," Nurse Moseley poked her head into his room. "I need to speak to you for a moment."
“Always your good boy,” Dean repeated without having to be told.
“I get that,” Dean was pleased with himself that he had made an impression. Maybe it was not going to be as hard as he imagined to make friends with Castiel.
“Dean,” Sam threw his arms up in the air when he saw his brother. Dean wondered when these parties actually started. He was given a time to show up twice and each time people were already drunk when he arrived. Unless college students these days were constantly drunk, he was arriving way too late. “I really did not think you were going to come. You kind of bailed early last time.”
“I love it,” Dean corrected him as he handed Castiel his next gift.
“I love you too, Dean.”
“I’m going to cum,” Dean warned Castiel, unsure of how much he was willing to handle. Castiel continued to suck and lick at Dean’s cock until he could no longer hold it back. His body was on fire and he could no longer hold it in.
“This morning stuff is horrible,” Ben grumbled as he entered the bathroom. “They should have summer school at night or at least not have it start until noon.”
Jimmy?
“Do not move unless I tell you to move,” Castiel commanded. “Or else I will stop and go directly to bed, do you understand?”
“Yes, what?”
"Where are we?" Dean asked. He raised his hand to stop Cas from getting any closer but he didn't seem to heed the warning.
[Cas] I just know, that either option is not going to end well for me?
[angelofthursday] Neither can I.
“I'm not just going to scream your name without incentive,” Cas laughed. “So, down on your knees.”
Ruby blushed and put her hand on his lap. For some reason he moved it away, but quickly apologized to her. It was not his intention. She did not seem mad, since he apologized right away. He knew this was going to take some getting used to.
[angelofthursday] Four.
“Punch yourself in the chest,” Castiel suggests. “Punch yourself in the face.”
“I am sure he would rather you call him than not call him,” Sam informed Dean. And as much as he was right, he still wasn’t going to do it.
“We can use the internet,” Dean said a little too excitedly. “I’ve been wanting to use it since we got here.”
“Right,” Castiel agrees, picking up his next card.
Dean fought the thoughts in his mind and allowed himself to focus only on Bella. There was a hot girl on his lap kissing him, she deserved his full attention. Soon Dean was for sure kissing her back and she moaned into his mouth when she felt him finally join her.
“This place is horrible,” Dean laughed as they entered their motel room. “I love it.”
“I’ve got you,” Dean promised, shifting to get closer. It was then that Dean slipped his penis between his hand as well, holding them together as he continued with the slow strokes. “I’ve always got you.”
“That is perfectly alright Mr. Shurley,” Castiel responded.
[angelofthursday] And why would you need to apologize for that, Dean?
Um … yeah. We can still watch a movie.
“And this is Castiel Novak,” Dean turned his head to see a man sitting in the corner. He looked older than everyone else and definitely did not look like he fit into this scene, which Dean could relate to. He was wearing nice black slacks that fit neatly with his polished black shoes. A dark blue shirt that you could almost confuse for black, tucked into them. A tie tied loosely around his neck. Dean assumed there was a black jacket to go with the outfit, he just wasn’t wearing it at the time. Not really the type of person Dean spent that much time with, though strangely, he wanted to.
“Dean,” Castiel leaned against the car with him. “I told you that it was okay. It happens. You do not have to apologize to me anymore. And please call me Cas, only my mother calls me Castiel.”
“Okay,” Dean nods with a nervous laugh.
[angelofthursday] Not legal? Bastard?
As Cas’ breathes became harder, Dean moved his mouth to the middle of his chest and slowly began to kiss down, occasionally letting his tongue push out and run over Cas’ skin until his mouth was kissing right above his boxers.
_ _ _ _ _ _
“Me too,” Kevin also agreed.
[555-0920 | Castiel] Yes. I already asked Balthazar. He said that it would be fine.
[greeneyedhunter] I don’t know. I have never been to prison. I don’t know how it works in the joint.
I was scared.
“When?”
[angelofthursday] Does age really matter?
“I suppose,” Castiel agreed. Dean could feel the bed shift as he spoke and soon Castiel was leaning over him, his mouth right at Dean’s ear, the hotness of his breath causing goosebumps to scatter across Dean’s arm. “Though, I would love to see if I could get you to cum, with nothing more than my voice. But I will save that for next time.”
“You already make me feel good,” Cas assured him.
“Oh my gosh,” Castiel moans, rubbing his stomach. “Oh lord.”
“Maybe now you won’t put your icy toes on me at night,” Dean laughed.
The kisses were slow and soft, as they explored each other’s mouths. They continued on like this for a while, until Dean’s hand slid down Castiel’s side and gripped at his hip. Castiel couldn’t hold back anymore. He leaned into Dean, kissing him hard. Dean kissed back with just as much fire, his tongue darting out and pushing at Castiel’s lips until he opened his mouth and allowed Dean inside. It became messy and frantic and exactly how Castiel had imagined it would be with them, only better.
Dean?
[Cas] I hope so.
"Okay," she finally allowed defeat to claim the day as she turned off the recorder. "We will try again another day. Just know, that when you are ready to talk about what happened, I am here."
“Oh gosh,” Castiel cries, leaning against the desk. “Oh gosh, guys.”
[555-0920 | Castiel] Can you get off early on Friday and be able to leave by 2?
“Dean,” Castiel began, reaching out to put his other hand on top of Deans, sandwiching it in. “You are not…”
“Wiping away,” Castiel continues, “every orifice that's gonna leak with pain and there's gonna be blood coming out of my ears. I don’t know what's going to happen.”
"I am sure that I do not know what you are talking about, Dean." Cas cocked his head to the side. Dean could picture every time Cas had done that simple gesture. It was many more times than Dean had known Cas in this life.
“Yeah,” Dean laughed, pulling his keys from the ignition, a habit he had formed when parking for more than a few minutes. “I was kind of curious about that one as well.”
“I see a smooth chest,” Castiel began to speak again as he ran his fingers slowly over Dean’s chest. “One that is groomed to look that way but would also look amazing if you let it grow out into something more. And I see a well-fed man, who isn’t fat but has just enough excess body weight to grab on to if need be.”
I mean, like State or even town. I am not trying to get your address or anything.
Dean threw his hands up over his eyes to block out the light. It was so bright that it made his eyes feel like they were burning out of his head. Light was supposed to be good but this light felt like it was boiling his insides and ripping him to shreds. There was nothing good about this feeling. He hated the light.
“I…” Balthazar went to answer but Dean began talking over him, shutting him up.
You hate camping.
[greeneyedhunter]
“Take them off,” Dean instructed Castiel, no longer questioning the moment.
[angelofthursday] Please, don’t be angry with me.
[angelofthursday] Questions? As in multiple?
Dean wondered what his family would feel about all of this. Had things been different in life, would they have freaked out if he one day brought a boy home instead of a girl? If he found out what happened to Sam and proved to them that it was not his fault, would they welcome him and his boyfriend into their lives? Dean had not really spoken with his parents much. They stopped visiting when he wasn’t showing any progress and from the way they looked at him, he was sure they did not even want to participate in those visits. He hoped they would take him back. He really missed his mom.
“I didn't mean it as a way to hurt you,” Cas hung his head. “It's just … none of them know I am gay.”
“Well aren’t you demanding today,” She threw back at him.
“What did she want?” Dean asked, knowing that it was really   none of his business but he was trying to take all the attention off him showing up drunk.
Dean rubbed at Cas’ erection for a few minutes through his pants but he could sense that Castiel was getting antsy, ready for Dean to touch him for real. Dean was happy to give him what he wanted. He moved his hands to the zipper of Cas’ jeans and slowly pulled it down, he then worked to undo the button. His heart was racing. He was excited and scared all at the same time. He wanted this but truthfully, this was his first time. He felt young and inexperienced, unsure if he was going to do anything right or if he was just going to be a disappointment.
Dean laughed at their banter. It was good to be back to the way things were, even though they were different in so many ways … good ways. Maybe? Dean still was not sure. He knew that he wanted this, he did, but it was still new to him. Cas being something other than just his best friend was new to him. Dating a guy was definitely new to him. Being in love … yeah, how that happened, Dean still could not figure it out. Oh … and the whole penis thing. That was a ball park he never thought he would visit. No pun intended … never mind, pun completely intended.
“Dean Winchester,” Castiel raised his voice just slightly. “Stand in front of that mirror or I will go home and I will tell Meg I was wrong and want to be with her.”
The drive from the creek back into town was a long one. He took every back road that he could think of, because even though he wanted to go home, he was not ready to be there yet. So, he was going to drive around, cool his jets for a while and get himself to relax. He also wanted to make sure that he avoided the cops, he was fairly certain that if he were to get pulled over, it would be a night in jail for him.
“Already moaning for me?” Castiel asked amused. “Maybe I won’t even touch you for this lesson.”
[greeneyedhunter] Was she at least attractive? I have always found crazy chicks to be hot.
“I do not,” Castiel confirmed.
Castiel reached down and grabbed the next gift handing it off to Dean. Before Castiel even had a chance to blink, Dean had the wrapping paper pulled off and tossed aside. Under the wrapping paper was another box. Dean sighed but quickly pulled open the box to reveal a flannel shirt, closest to the color of Castiel’s eyes that he could find.
“I was just going to say that, I love you too,” Dean answered. “I always have.”
“Oh really?” Dean asked with an eyebrow wiggle.
Back amongst the trees was a large cart, with carved out windows covered with thick wood. It looked like a cell within their dungeon. The wood was falling apart around it and a sad looking horse stood solemn at the front.
“Cause, I do need ice cream,” Dean admits.
[angelofthursday] See, women are crazy. Lol.
The rest of the car ride continued on with their normal banter. While they took things seriously in their household, and currently had a serious matter on their hands, normally, things were light-hearted and fun. They tried to do their best with their daughter and when they originally agreed to adopt a child, they talked a lot about the traits they would like her to learn from them, what they felt was important. Dean felt that having a sense of humor and being able to let go and be silly was something people lacked and the world needed a little more of. Castiel agreed, adding in his desire to show her how to make learning fun and not just something boring you did in school. They spent a lot of family time going to museums, taking classes together, and watching documentaries, allowing her to discover what it truly was she loved. Both of those things were strong in their daughter now and even with this small hiccup, he knew that Claire was going to do great things with her life.

He told himself how stupid he was for going in the first place. This led him to thinking about Bella and really trying to figure out what went wrong. He found her attractive and interesting, what more could he ask for in a girl? It had been long enough for him to start dating again, in fact, he had recently been thinking about getting back out there. He knew that Lisa would want him to move on and love someone again.
[greeneyedhunter] And that is bad?
"I quite enjoy reading," Castiel finally looked up at Michael and met him with challenging eyes. "My father enjoyed reading as well. Must be one of the qualities I received from him."
“True,” Dean agreed. “I really like that Meg chick.”
“Cas,” Dean interrupted but Castiel held up is hand to stop him.
“That sounds much better,” Dean agreed.
[angelofthursday] Not to say that I am not open to the possibility of it.
“Oil density?” Dean questions with a tilt to the head.
[angelofthursday] Why?
“I'll come with you,” Cas was right behind him.
“Oh, right.” Dean felt the swell of disappointment rise in his chest. “Thanks again.”
"Good."
______
“What happened to it?”
Same here.
“This is Ruby,” Sam gave Dean a wink as he pointed over at Ruby, a blond with attitude literally flowing off her. She was the blond cheerleader type, pretty but bad ass and could probably take you in a fight if you pushed her into a corner, Dean liked her.
[greeneyedhunter] Are you famous, Cas?
“Nice,” Dean laughed to himself, reaching over to grab the beer that was being handed to him. If he was going to party, he may as well do it right.
Castiel reaches over the desk and grabs one of the plastic gloves that were laid out for them before they began filming. He places it over his right hand, not putting one on his left hand.
Do you love me?
“Are you enjoying the party?” Bella asked.
Dean looked at his husband. Where the hell had he been during this conversation? Normally, he was Mr. Talkative, and let’s work this out. But since he had found out what was going on, he had sat silent, not helping Dean out in the slightest.
“Today after lunch on the playground,” Principal Shurley started to answer. “She pushed a boy off of the play structure. While he is okay, his parents did need to come and take him to the doctor, just to have him looked at.”
“Dude.” Dean was shocked by how oblivious Cas was. “He has been hitting on you all night. I'm pretty sure he intended to hook up with you this weekend.”
"Where am I?" Dean demanded an answer more than simply asking a question.
“Why would a mechanic work out of a diner?” The man asked, not even looking at Dean but making another pass at the establishment.
Cas was facing away from him, appearing to be making something on the stove, but Dean could not see what it was. Dean could go for some food. His dinner definitely did not compare to the kinds of food that Cas made. Cas was more about home cooked meals and healthy eating. He had never approved of Dean’s eating habits but he also never complained about eating tv dinners with him when they were having a movie night at Dean’s house. Yeah, Cas was his best friend. He had not been talking to Cas online.
We are moving forward. You lied. I forgive you. We don’t need to bring it up again.
“Oh,” Dean’s shoulders slumped and he took a drink of his water. He wasn't sure what to say to him really. When Castiel had talked about her, he talked about how much he had loved her and how she took him on so many adventures most people don’t get to take. But then again, he wanted to be in one place and not move around so much and she simply could not give him that. “So, do you think you are going to be getting back together?”
Castiel pulled himself back and reached down between them, slipping his fingers into the waistband of Dean’s boxers that he was wearing and working to pull them down his body. Dean mimicked his actions, removing his own boxers and tossing them out of the bed and somewhere off onto the floor. Castiel did the same. This couldn’t be happening.
[greeneyedhunter] Why?
_ _ _ _ _ _
“Oh.”
"You," Cas stood up straight, seeming to work through what Dean was asking him. "You went somewhere and were kind of mumbling about light."
Dean chuckled to himself. Best friends aren’t supposed to keep secrets, right? Maybe he was wrong. He didn’t know. He was sure there were times in his life when he had lied to Castiel but it was never intended to be for mean purposes. He knew that Cas did not intend to hurt him in his lie, but that did not mean it didn’t happen. But that was supposed to be behind them now and if he kept dwelling on it, then he was lying to Castiel when he said he had forgiven him and they could move on from it.
With that, the fairy, seeming to trust him a little more, stepped out of the cage and into Castiel's hand.
“Shit,” Dean sighed, pushing himself away from the table. “Sorry, I need to go lie down.”
“Twelve gold,” Castiel called out. It was all that he had on him but even at that, it was a substantial amount of gold.
Castiel reaches down and pulls up the first card. He gives Dean a quick look before turning back to the card, his face pointing in the direction of the camera. Another deep breath and he begins to read.
“Okay,” Castiel says. “Something we can do together.”
_ _ _ _ _ _
Can I … um …
“Yes,” Dean and Claire both said excitedly at the same time.
Another long pause. Dean could feel the tears building behind his eyes but he could not let himself cry. He did not cry.
Then it all clicked. Dean had ordered Castiel’s drink order because he knew that it was him who was going to show up; if he’d decided to show up. Dean had known that it was him. But how? Was it from the texts that Castiel sent him last night about his dilemma? Had he known for longer? Why wasn’t he angrier that Castiel was sitting in front of him and not Jimmy?
Thank you Dean.
“Of course you were the reason I was going,” Dean blurted out, throwing his hands in the air in defeat. Castiel should have known that Dean would not just willingly go to another frat party. “But you weren’t there and it sucked and that girl kissed me. God I let her kiss me and why didn’t you come?”
[angelofthursday] Would you like me to leave you be so that you can unwind?
“Because you what?”
[Dean] How is you being hurt okay?
[Dean] What does that mean?
Are you saying you are not attractive? I don’t care what you look like. If I cared, I would have pushed harder for a picture.
“Okay,” Castiel nodded his head and went into the other room.
[greeneyedhunter] You couldn’t what?
He had wanted to sleep with Castiel for years now. But this was not how he wanted to do it. He wanted to tell Castiel how he felt or never tell him at all and just avoid the situation altogether. Now his entire existence revolved around sleeping with his best friend who he was secretly in love with.
“Well thanks for that,” Dean interrupts.
Dean gripped the counter and then turned to see Ben standing in the doorway of their kitchen. He was talking to Dean but Dean could not make out his words. Ben wasn't his son. Ben was Lisa's son. Dean had chosen hunting and left them behind. He couldn't keep them safe in his world.
[greeneyedhunter] I am so sorry to hear that.
[angelofthursday] Oh.
"Cas?" Dean began to question but then everything went dark.
[angelofthursday] She had completely moved herself in while I was out of town.
“Please, Dean.” Castiel’s tone dropped from authoritative to something so small that Dean could not really place the emotion behind it. “I can not keep up this fight if you die.”
Dean continued to struggle against the weight that was crushing against him. His body was heavy and he was having no luck but he was eventually able to open his eyes.
[greeneyedhunter] Dude.
How was your day?
“Now?”
That doesn’t mean I was in love with him.
[angelofthursday] You do not need to come up with an excuse. If you would like to stop talking now, just say it and move on.
[greeneyedhunter] I am not angry. I just want to know more about who you are.
“Yeah,” Dean confirms. “Denny’s is always open.”
“But you aren’t crazy.”
You are straight … but …
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
Because you are here.
Well I just get luckier and luckier.
Good.
“Here, I’ll make it easier for you,” Dean said as he stood up and began to pull his chair to Castiel’s side of the table. “Castiel Novak?”
Sorry once again this took so long. I am a horrible person, I know. But hopefully this helps a little.
“I have sleep ambitions,” Ben laughed, walking out of the bathroom to continue getting ready for his day. Dean and Ben both had pretty independent mornings. Dean made sure that Ben was awake to get ready for school and then that was it. Dean got ready for work, grabbed coffee on the way and Ben got ready for school and got himself off to the bus for summer school, ensuring he would probably be a bartender. Now that Ben was twelve, he was better equipped to take care of himself.
“Well,” Cas spoke again, a slight laugh in his voice. “If you insist, Dean.”
“This is not okay,” Meg’s voice dropped. “Best friends don’t just sleep with each other. You know this isn’t right.”
They sat so far away that it was easy for them to not talk but today was going to be different. It was going to be the same amount of uncomfortable company, only this time there was going to be undesired dialogue to go with it. If anything, Castiel could not wait to be king so that he could send Michael away and never have to speak with him again. If only the time were now.
Before giving Dean any more time to whine, Castiel picks up his next card.
“Fine,” Dean gave in. “Standing here.”
No way? So am I.
“I wanted to talk about what happened at school today.”
_ _ _ _ _ _
Dean swallowed but brought himself to his feet and made his way up the stairs, Castiel right behind him. He stopped when he got to the top, not quite sure what his plan was. Once Castiel reached the top of the stairs, he pointed toward Dean’s bedroom. Dean hesitated for a moment but walked into his room and waited for Castiel to join him.
Michael opened his mouth to say something but closed it just as fast. He knew better than to speak ill of the late King Charles. Though he had many followers, Michael was well aware of the love that the kingdom had for his brother, as well as nearly every person who remained within the walls of the palace.
"I have to go eat supper," Castiel informed the fairy. He was still trying to work through this situation. Maybe some time away from it would clear his head. "I will bring you back some food."
“When I asked Claire why she pushed the boy off the play structure,” Principal Shurley paused again as if trying to search for the right words to give them. “She said that she heard him tell another child that his parents said that … that gay men were disgusting in the eyes of the … the lord.”
Castiel could obviously sense Dean’s nervousness and pulled away, keeping their arms locked on each other but allowing for him to have a chance to speak. Dean leaned forward, trying connect his lips with Cas’ once again, but Cas turned his head. If Dean could not see the longing and the desire in Cas’ eyes, he would have been hurt or offended by this action.
"Don't bullshit me, Cas." Dean stopped his pacing in order to look at Cas, who would not make eye contact with him. "Look at me."
Okay. Let me put it this way. You love Cas. You don’t love PENIS. But maybe, one day, once you get through the loving Cas part (1/2)
"What the hell did you mean?" Dean asked as he pushed his way into the house.
[angelofthursday] I just. I have talked to a lot of guys who find out I am gay and then they disappear or get mean.
“Mine.”
“Well, yeah,” Dean laughed, which only made Castiel want to cry worse than before. “I agree with all of that. I enjoyed this, like wow. And I also do not want this to ruin our friendship because you being my best friend is the only thing in life that matters. But that is not what I was going to say.”
This is when their theme song and opening video would now be played, but that would not be added in until after the episode was shot.
And why is that?
Dean read the message with a smile, soon realizing it was Sam. That did not take away his smile. He loved hearing from his little brother. Sam was also a busy person, so most of the time, text was the only way he heard from his brother for weeks.
“I thought you were dead,” Dean interrupted.
“I am so sorry Dean,” Castiel finally let the tears free and they slowly slipped from his eyes. Dean could feel his own forming but he fought to hold them in.
“Hey,” the all responded in unison.
“Okay.” That was all Dean could ask for.
It’s pretty simple.
[angelofthursday] What if I really like you and then, I can’t have you?
[greeneyedhunter] Talking to you is exactly how I would like to unwind.
Yeah. Pretty much. I thought you knew.
“I suppose I am ready then.” Castiel finally caved in. He could do this.
“Well, it’s true,” Castiel replied to his husband, turning slightly and giving Dean a playful smile.
Once Meg is gone, they remain silent. Dean follows Castiel into his room and Castiel finds Dean and towel and a pair of dry clothes to change into. Once Dean is changed, Castiel turns off the light and they crawl into Castiel’s bed. Castiel waits for the signal from Dean and wraps his arms around his best friend, holding him tight. Even though Castiel knows that Dean is no longer getting abused from his father, he never questions why Dean shows up, or why he needs this. Castiel doesn’t care though. Nothing in him ever wants Dean to stop showing up at his door and ending up in his bed. In a twisted way, Castiel always seems to need these moments just as much as Dean does.
