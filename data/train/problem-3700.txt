When she was offered the epidural at about 5 hours in, she declined which was about the craziest thing my hand and I had ever heard. She said she wanted to experience labor and shit. Cas was wheeled in on a wheelchair when she started pushing. By then he had been out of surgery for 9 hours.
I think I just have to come to terms with the fact that Cas is a mystery that I’ll have to take my time solving until he tells me more about himself.
I thought that I had hurt him for a bit, but I hadn't. In the 4 years I’d known him, I had never seen him cry.
Yesterday, I was talking to Jody about how Bela had relapsed again, and she told me that Bela was going to have to have a turning point on her own. And that I should focus on being her friend, instead of her savior.
Yes, that happened... and I’ll never let him live that one down. We’ve been meaning to try it again but just haven’t gotten the chance yet.
When my mother found out she was pregnant with me, it was right before her 17th birthday. When she told Michael, he told her that he would deny that the baby was his if she told anyone and that she would ruin his chances of being a town leader.
She had a lot of… odd cravings like one time I walked in the kitchen from work and she was eating pickles with ice cream and I walked right back out of the house. Pickles and ice cream don't even remotely go together. I ended up hanging out in a coffee shop till Cas gave the all-clear.
It was devastating because we had all been so excited to meet her. I had obviously never had a sibling before and the idea of one meant hope, especially after my dad had died. And now that hope was gone.
I thought that Meg’s story was better than the one I heard, but that it still wasn't scary. The windows were broken and I did see scratches on the wall, but that could have been manmade.
Towards the middle, before this dinner party scene happened, Cousin Itt came on the stage and did the Rock on symbol with his hands and that’s when I knew that that was my freaking Sammy. I was so proud that I ended up grabbing Benny and Cas by the shoulders and shaking them.
So, Lydia and Stiles Stilinski were a popular family in Lawrence in the 1800s. Stiles was a doctor, and Lydia was a teacher, but they harbored a dark secret. Legend has it they used to lure people to their houses and murder them for their blood. They did this for decades until they went missing. Police found them in their home.
Guess it might have been the sex haze because before I knew it, I was telling him that I could be his model.
When you were 16, I showed you how to tie a tie for your first date with Castiel. I like that kid. He’s funny.
It was getting to the point that at lunchtime I felt guilty for eating. I felt as though everyone at school was watching every single bite I took.
The number I saw shouldn't have affected me as much as it did. I had gained all the weight back that I had lost before being the D-bag entered my life, but also 13 pounds more. And really, my body didn't look so different at first. Until I started checking more.
So, Dad, Sammy, and I spent the next three days at the hospital learning all things type 1 diabetes-related. Some of it is pretty intense stuff.
Charlie, Cas, and I were supposed to go to the lake today but Cas bailed. Which is something he hasn't done before. He has a hard time telling Charlie no.
That time, it happened after we visited mom’s grave last May. It marked a year she had been gone and three months since my recent sip up. After we got home, I remember closing myself in my room and just feeling numb.
He called the school while I was in the hospital, and now most if not all of my teachers know about it. Basically, if I’m running high or low I get a pass to get out of class to go deal with it. My teachers let me eat black licorice in class whenever I need to.
But, anyway, I think everyone has been having fun during this trip. We still have a month before we all start packing up for the next stage of our lives, and I’m already starting to miss them.
Found out later that Cas had also gotten accepted to the University of Wichita which would be a two-hour drive from K-state and he was nervous to tell me. I mean, I would rather him go to K-state with me but, if he really wants to go to Wichita then he should.
That same day, I gave Kevin, Benny, and Charlie a crash course on diabetes over lunch. Charlie and Benny asked a question or two, but I don’t think they knew what to ask. Kevin though, came prepared and had some good questions that some I didn't know the answers to.
I’ll be 28 in exactly a month from now. It’s only two years till I turn 30 or the “dirty 30” as Cas likes to call it. I think he’s more excited than I am. He wants to go all out, but I’d rather do something small. He makes jokes like he doesn’t turn 30 six months after me.
Three weeks later, I got a call from a phone number from Lebanon, Kansas for a job interview. I almost fucked up the second zoom interview because I overslept. They ended up having technical difficulties so they had to push back the interview by half an hour which gave me just enough time.
She called in the middle of the night 5 months later and asked us if she could stay at our place. I was skeptical about having her in the house living with us, but Cas wasn’t. She ended up moving into our living room that night. Daisy fell in love with Kaia the moment she walked into the house and slept with her on the couch every night.
My favorite class is Intro to Engineering, because of the professor. We call our teacher Professor Death because he played the song “O’ Death” by Jen Titus when he walked in. He’s a little intimidating. Think I’ve only seen him smile once since the class started.
When she gave me a hug, all I could feel were her bony arms and all I could smell was cigarette smoke.
Dean licked his lips and felt a tight but warm sensation at the bottom of his belly. Cas had always had that effect on him. He called it the pull. He hadn't understood it too much when they were younger but now it was the only thing he understood.
We talked about random stuff. Apparently half of the peas in the nerd pod, Sarah, is now dating this guy named Gadreel. Benny talked about that guy before, Coach was going to cut him from the wrestling team this year because he kept missing practice, but his mom Naomi threatened to stop funding the reconstruction of the gym.
Seeing my mom that first day in the hospital. The thought that she might never wake up. It made me think about the time when I let her walk away when I was 16. And also that I’d never get to talk to her again, that she’d never get to even meet you. All the thoughts were suffocating.
Lastly, I love that you know all the things that I’ve gone through, and don't see me as that little scared kid.
Anyway, I went to school and I thought since it was my birthday and all that it would be good for me, but instead, my blood sugar was out of whack till around lunch, which was pretty fucking frustrating. Was low during first period, then I drank a capri sun, but then went high, so I gave myself some units, but then I went low again. Nurse Mildred was ready to call Dad, but I ended up eating an orange and it was steady after that.
You were a little sweaty and looked a little green and you didn't eat much oatmeal at first but Dad kind of forced you to because you already had your insulin. You got most of it down... till you started puking. Which obviously wasn't good. So he called your endocrinologist, Rafael, and he said to give you some juice and to not skip out on the insulin. The juice stayed down enough to kick up your levels a little bit so that put us both at ease.
During the visit, we played a game of flip UNO. I talked to her about my new job and the pranks I recently pulled on Sam. She talked about wanting to be the highest bidder for this gold pocket watch that had belonged to Lydia and Stiles Stilinski. Said she that their gruesome story had always been interesting to her.
This monitor tells me my blood sugar every 5 minutes and sends the results to my phone. It’s able to show trends on this device. It's been interesting seeing what times I go lower and what times I go higher. It attaches to my arm, my stomach, leg if I wanted it to, and it's the size of a bandaid.
Whoops, this is very late. I'm a procrastinator and it's just who I will always be. Happy Birthday Dean Winchester. 42 has never looked so good
Though our stories and struggles were different, Bela and I understood each other on a level that nobody else could. In both our cases, this whole thing had started because we wanted to lose a few pounds, but it turned into an obsession that left us with trying to find a new normal.
Never would have thought that I would be married to the person I dated in high school. I think I first had the idea of Cas being it, was after a huge fight we had in senior year of college. It was a few months after the engagement actually. We even agreed to just take a break from each other. It only lasted for a day and a half till we were back together again.
Sam and Dad both came. During these appointments, Dr. Walker would check my weight, urine, blood, and blood pressure to see any signs that I was going back to my bulimic ways which I knew he wouldn't find. He also listened to my heart for any signs of my heart arrhythmia. That had been pretty mild and has since gotten better.
Pamela and I just make jokes about the tone-deaf kid. She even got me a pair of earbuds so that helps.
Anyway, I never thought I would say this, but I actually missed nurse Mildred over the summer. You tend to get pretty close when you see someone multiple times in a week. I went to go drop off my new supply bag and she called me her favorite patient. She even complimented the new bag. This new one had unicorns on it.
Anyway, tomorrow’s just going to be a chill day. Benny’s finally going to make that Jambalaya he made in Myrtle Beach. Been trying to convince him for days. I guess it’s been nice to get away and hang out with Benny. We’ve worked out a couple of times since I’ve been here and it’s like old times. We leave in a few days and I’m gonna miss that big lug.
Dr. Walker started asking me some questions and he seemed kind of concerned about my weight loss too. I again told him that I was on track.
I think since then Bela has stopped taking them which I was happy about. We try to call each other at least a few times a month and get together every so often. She now lives about an hour and a half away from me, close to K-state University.
For our bachelor parties, we both went on separate weekend road trips to do different things and obviously party. Cas went to Colorado with Meg, Charlie, and Kevin. When Cas was talking about going hiking and painting, Meg was gagging in the background. When Cas called me one night, he, Kevin, and Charlie were so drunk I could barely understand what they were saying. It was awesome. Thank God Meg was there to liven things up or it would have been boring as hell. I got a ton of pictures of Kevin and Cas hiking so he got to still do what he wanted. He also got to paint while on this mountain too.
When I got back to the car you were drumming and singing along to ‘Thunderstruck’. The first thing I did was kiss you. You tasted like maple syrup. I just felt so much pride that you were my boyfriend. That you were mine and I was yours.
Dean had always thought Cas was beautiful when he slept. He found the light snores comforting. Sometimes, like now, he’d sleep with his mouth open and it would make Dean absolutely giddy. He had even drawn Cas that way multiple times. The way he curled in on himself was different from how Dean slept, all spread out. Cas had once said Dean had looked like a starfish.
We’re doing self-portraits and I’ll be the first one to admit that mine looks like shit. I only had the lines sort of done for mine. I looked over at Castiel's drawing, and I just stared at it. Castiel had already started putting in some shading. He was definitely way too good for this art class.
Dad had built it for Sammy and me when we were younger. We call it the bunker and it’s about 10 years old now. Sometimes I would just lay there quietly but other times I’d play music. Sometimes I would even do homework. To some, it might be a hazard in certain spots where the nails stick out, but Sammy and I didn’t care.
We’re supposed to go out on a date this Friday after my wrestling meet, but I’m not sure yet where I want to take her. Maybe we can just cook at her place. Unlike most of my family: I can cook. I think it would be better than going to a movie or something, and besides, her parents being gone is the perfect time to- you know what.
She asked me how it was going and I kind of panicked and said “welcome to God of music… music store.“
After the mirror maze, Cas finally convinced me to go on the Ferris wheel before we left. I usually don't go on it because of this little thing about it being 200 feet off the ground, but he had been really looking forward to it so I thought, why not.
At the end of May, when we were planning our classes, seniors get to choose if they don't want a class during lunch period or a last class. Everyone except Dorothy and Kevin has a longer lunch since their schedules are full. So that means we all get an hour for lunch. I think we’re just going to take turns carpooling each other during lunch.
The first week I had it, I chose the back of my arm. This was great and all but I had my CGM on my stomach so they were on different sides of my body. It made sleeping uncomfortable because any side I chose to sleep on, I had a device on it. That first time, Sam stuck googly eyes on it while I was taking a nap. I didn't even notice until Cas told me while he was visiting me at work. It was a good prank but I got him back. Ended up putting itchy powder in his underwear and saved some clown pictures for next time.
After telling me to get my shit together, he asked me when the last time I backed away from a situation whenever it got too difficult. And I guess he was right. And this thing with Cas shouldn’t have been this weird.
Had this dream about Sam and me, but we were older, and I was getting to the good part where we were face to face with this vampire, THENNNNN my alarm woke me up for work. I had never straight-up called off for work before, but I was so tired that I had to do it. I called Ash and we ended up switching shifts. And I have to take another of his shifts in January, I agreed with no questions asked. It was a small price to pay for sleep. I ended up drinking a little bit of juice so I’d have time for some sleep. Then I drank water, went to the bathroom, and fell back asleep.
All their stares made me feel smaller than I already felt. Being in the hospital gown only made things worse. I felt exposed under those white lights. Like there was nothing left to hide.
Kinda sucks because Benny and I were supposed to go with some wrestling buddies to the movies to see Star Wars the Last Jedi.
Tonight, Dad was on the floor with Journey and he was trying to get Journey to scoot for this toy by putting it further away from him. Each time Journey got frustrated, Dad kept moving the toy closer and closer until he all but put the toy in Journey's hand. I think he hates hearing her cry.
We even traded Cas’ truck for a used four-door car. There was no way in hell I was ever going to give up Baby. Getting the car seats hooked in the car was a bitch though.
I’ve had multiple talks with Jody about it, but it’s so much easier telling yourself that it wasn't your fault, than actually believing it.
Dean had been devastated when he had woken up from giving his first donation to find Sam’s bed empty.
But anyway, I looked up a picture of the Stilinski's later that night. They didn't really look like they performed lobotomies… but I guess nobody looks like that.
I'm going to miss Charlie talking about fantasy worlds and video games, Kevin and the study sessions, and the funny things he says, Benny and his outrageous stories.
The conversation was a little less tense after the food came. I told him some recent stuff that had happened to me. We talked about random things, school, and life in general. He got married to that Layla girl that he was supposed to be married to when he was dating my mom. They never had any kids. Layla didn't want any and I’m guessing Michael hadn't pushed.
Tonight, I looked at everyone around me and all I can think is how thankful I am. Tomorrow I get to introduce my mom’s famous chocolate chip cookies to my daughter and I almost can’t believe it.
Now, Castiel visits me when he’s done with his work at Tessa’s at least 3 times a week. We mostly just talk about our day while I organize the music section or work the register.
I was actually making my 3rd loaf of sourdough bread when I finally decided that I wanted to meet him and at least hear what he had to say. I wanted to do it not for Michael, not because you told me that I should, but because I wanted to.
And that’s why Benny’s my best friend. He doesn't take any of my bullshit. Also, he’s the only one who likes black licorice like me so there's that too.
Wouldn't recommend it though. Glucagon and having the flu have a tendency to make you feel pretty shitty afterward.
Sound ended up waking Sam. I somehow told him to get my phone to see my numbers and they were still at 155. Then I knew something wasn't right. I thought, okay, there’s no way that I’m feeling this shitty at 155. Then Sam checked my blood sugar manually and we found out that my levels were at a 258.
Wrestling has kind of made it complicated. I had to get this sticky spray stuff for it and these… like sticker things for the extra stick. It took some trial and error and online searching, but I finally figured out how to keep it on for the full week. I gotta take off the transmitter before each practice and match too because if I break it, I’m shit out of luck until the next one comes in and I’d rather not do that.
Not to sound like a dick, but it's been a nice little break from everything with Cas’ mom. She’s doing a little better. She’s up on her feet again in a treatment facility and is doing great so far. Nick is long gone. Has been since the week after she was admitted into the hospital. I think that had more to do with the fact that Cas told him if he ever stepped anywhere near his mom, he’d be the one in that hospital bed next time.
After the room was back to white and everything else was gone, I took Anna’s stuffed mouse and dug a hole in the backyard. When I got ready to put the mouse in the ground, I found that I couldn't do it. I ended up breaking down. Everything came crashing down and I couldn't hold back my feelings anymore. My mom found me an hour later outside shivering despite the coat I had on and crying and clinging to that stuffed mouse.
The flight was only a couple of hours long but we both fell asleep. I hadn't gotten great sleep and Cas didn't either. When we got to Florida at around 10 that night, we got the rental car, got some fast food which we ate on the drive over to the place. It took us about an hour to get to it. Once we got our keys, we brought our bags in, looked around a little bit, then went upstairs, got undressed, got under the covers, and then proceeded to pass out from exhaustion.
We hadn't been married for long but I didn’t think I ever really wanted kids. You opened your puffy eyes when I started talking to you and at the moment I didn't know I could love anyone as much as I loved your Mom.
Anyway, Tessa is also stopping by tomorrow night with her fiance. We like him alright, he doesn’t talk much. He’s a taxi driver and basically has a map of the whole town in his head which is kind of cool.
Yesterday, after he asked what AC/DC stood for, was the last straw. After work, I ended up gathering up some classics from my collection and driving over to Cas’ place. When he answered the door, I handed him the stack and told him that it didn't matter the order he listened to them in, but the first one had to be AC/DC. Specifically, the song ‘Thunderstruck’, and he had to finish off with Kansas, specifically the song ‘Carry On Wayward Son’. And I also told him that he had to listen to Ramble On not once, or twice, but three times.
Hellloooo. It's been legit 5 years since I started this. I thought that maybe since we were all in Quarantine, I would finish this story.
Speaking of Cas, he has begun to expand his cooking skills. He can now make cookies. It’s not a huge step from bread but I’m proud of him nonetheless. Now our freezer is packed with bread and cookies. He bakes cookies when he’s happy and bread when he’s stressed or bored. We finally decided to start donating to some homeless shelters. Sometimes he’ll also put them at the art shows that he puts together. He says they're the perfect conversation starters... ?
When I tried it on Cas, I ended up using too much teeth. He ended up talking to me through most of it.
I’ve already gotten asked out by three different girls and a guy to the Prom that's at the end of April.
Oh wow, chapter 19! holy cow. 10 more weeks until the final chapter. I'm so excited that this has almost 2K hits!!!
Yes, even though we’ve known each other for almost 11 years now, I’m always learning something new about him...
Since the beginning, my wrestling team knew about it, and it just kind of spread from there. If anyone asked why I would always go to the nurse’s office, I usually just told them the truth.
They also had taken away my snack stash which I wasn't too happy about. Another new rule was that I wasn’t allowed to be in the bathroom for more than… I think it was 10 minutes… nope, it was 8 min.
This semester I took philosophy since I forgot about class registration. It’s hard to listen to my philosophy class debate about whether or not Cain should have been punished for murder when he was never told it was wrong. I contributed as much as I could only because I have no intention of repeating the class again next semester but all I want to do is sleep in that class.
He then told me that he wouldn't accept it back and the amount wouldn't ever be enough, but that he had been saving up a little each year.
Holy shit. 11 more weeks of this story! Where the hell did the time go!? And I know it's far away but I've got a surprise for you guys in chapter 28. Hint: It's freaking beautiful.
I think Dad felt strongly about me having one. I don't have to worry about getting as low as I did during the flu. Or high either. Sends an alert out.
Hannah doesn't use a skateboard, she's on skates which is pretty damn cool. She does like these cool flips and shit.
Sam wants to go see something called Truckhedge on the way back home. It’s been on both of our lists for a while now but we never drive this far out. Should be interesting. Cas was interested because of all the sculptures and he “admired the artist’s form of self-expression and how he has made his unique creations accessible to anyone”.
To solve that problem, I completely stopped eating for a day, only drinking apple juice and water to keep my energy up. The juice part was pretty difficult since Mom was a dentist and she didn’t keep sugary drinks around the house too often so I had to buy the juice from school during lunch.
But, despite the breakup, things have been going okay. Won the majority of our matches against Beacon Hills high school. Preppy losers didn't know what hit them. Dad and Sammy came for that meet. Actually he’s come to all my meets since my diagnosis. Can’t tell if he’s actually interested, or he’s checking up on me. Either way, it’s been kind of cool.
Early in the morning of Saturday, May 13th, Cas had had some really bad stomach pains. We thought it would just go away at first but then he started puking and he couldn't even stand up. At around 10 am, Kaia and I took him to the emergency room and it turned out that he had appendicitis and had to have his appendix removed.
We picked names this year and I got Bobby. I got him a new hat that he probably won't wear until his other two hats are in pieces. I got Sam a bag of whole coffee beans and a new coffee maker since I broke his last one when I dropped it down the stairs while helping him move to his apartment. I also got him a subscription to hunt a killer which is an online game where everybody’s put into groups and they are sent different pieces of clues. They all have to collaborate on the clues that they got and who they think the killer was. Might as well use that big brain of his for something other than studying. I got the old man beef jerky and this beer I got from Louisiana when I visited Benny last summer. Haven't tried it yet but Benny swore by it. I got the golden age beer from Family Business Beer. I’m sure Dad’ll like it. He ain’t picky.
But anyway, I actually decided to take a pump break a little bit before this trip. Been going rogue for the last 2 weeks now. Alicia and Max told me they do it every summer. At first, I thought they were bat shit crazy. I asked my endocrinologist about it and he actually said that some of his other patients have had “great success” with breaks. Supposedly it gives your body time to heal from all the site changes. So better insulin absorption.
When I was done, things were quiet between us. She said it was a lot to think about. I was about to tell her that I was the same person that I was yesterday and the eating disorder hadn’t changed that, when I got an urgent call from Sammy telling me that he and Dad were picking me up. Dr. Walker called and said that I needed to go to the emergency room for some more tests and that they were waiting for me. I told Cassie and that I’d keep her posted.
YES, our room is painted orange. BUT only one wall and it’s not as bright as Cas’ room back in Lawrence.
He cradled the back of Cas’ head and wrapped his other hand around him. Cas’ hands made their way to Dean’s ass. He let his tongue slip into his lover’s mouth. They let themselves get lost in the rhythmic movements of their bodies made together.
They said I was in mild DKA and was put on IV’s and was there till 10 o'clock the next morning. Sam got a pass to spend the day home and he and I got caught up on a few episodes of Game of Thrones. Charlie recommended that one. We’re only in the second season. Dad tried to do both his work and watch at the same time. Ended up doing more watching than working and put his computer away.
Then I got an idea. After I excused myself, I went into the bathroom and waited in a stall for a moment to make sure I was alone. No matter how much I thought about throwing up, it didn’t happen automatically like in the Oreo incident.
Dean lazily ran his finger over Cas’ first scar on his side where they had taken the first piece of him 3 years prior. Cas’ first donation was one of his kidneys. Which it was something that he could live without and didn't have any lasting effects from. He was the same person and the surgery hadn't changed that.
He was actually talking about a haunted themed party. He said that he and his old homeschool group had been planning it and now he knew for sure it was happening. He called it the Haunted Prom. The more he talked about it, the more I actually got excited about it. It sounded way more fun than the actual prom.
A couple of days ago, there was this moment while Sammy and I were sitting up in the bunker. Sam was reading the Diabetes for Dummies book and I was playing with the necklace Sam had gotten for me and it suddenly hit me that I had to live with this thing forever. More so, that I had to deal with this forever. The nurses could have told me that as much as they wanted but I don’t think I understood the gravity of it.
Sam and Jo shook me awake today because there was about two feet of snow on the ground. On a normal snow day, I'd just roll out of bed and follow Sammy, but now I can't just do that.
We stood by my door for a little while just staring at each other. And then, I’m not sure who did what first, but we just started kissing. Then, one thing led to the next, and then before I knew it, we were together in bed naked. And it felt almost like old times again, but I knew after, it would still be the same. After, we laid next to each other for a long while but didn’t talk.
I have nothing against Lisa, Lydia, Aaron, or Carmen, but I told them I was going with Cas. Lisa wished us both luck. Aaron and Carmen asked if Cassie was coming back from Missouri, which I said no, and corrected them on which Cas I was talking about. Lydia told me to hit her up if Cas bailed.
I get tired of checking my blood sugar, checking my feet, the injections, feeling crappy after a high or low, having to keep eating to get my blood sugar where I want it. I miss when days were easy. All I want is a day off.
When we got to the top I just sat for a little bit to catch my breath. Cas said he had to take a piss before the sunrise came in more. When he came back, he ended up tripping and falling. When I went over to him with some bandaids, he reached into his pocket and pulled out this box. I thought it was black at first, but my eyes had to adjust a bit, I realized it was green.
After confessing that I thought I had ruined things with Cas, he got this really serious look on his face. He told me that I better get it together because he liked Cas being in the group. This was kind of surprising to me because it had taken a bit for Benny to even warm up to Cas. I hadn’t known their relationship went beyond school lunch. Turns out Cas had helped him with one of his history papers and they’ve hung out a few times.
When I was about three years old, my mom met this guy named Gabriel, who is the only one I will ever call Dad. He worked as a comic illustrator. They ended up getting married when I was 5, and we moved to Pontiac, Illinois, into this green house with dark blue shutters. Mom said my dad wanted to paint it, but she liked it so much that he couldn't do it.
I’m sure my wrestling coach would love that. I haven't gained all the weight I had lost before diagnosis.
Even though Nick is a colossal douchebag, I really hope for his sake, he listens. I know when Cas is joking, and that wasn't one of those times.
I’ve always liked how you just take everything that’s happened to you and you just deal with it. You’ve dealt with your eating disorder, you deal with the fact that Mom is gone, and you deal with your diabetes.
My mom was pretty mad and mentioned the extra apples and sandwiches that she had been packing in my lunches for school and how “the refrigerator had been dwindling living with two boys.”
He pulled at the waistband of Cas’ underwear slowly and watched as his body shook with a shutter. Dean admired the splash of red that started on his face but had begun to spread down his neck, over his chest, and to his nipples. Dean wanted it to go further.
When he dropped me off at home, I could tell that things were still weird between us so I asked him to go to a pizza place with me the following Sunday.
We got there at 10:30 am. Tessa dropped us off while she parked. On the way to Eve's room, he squeezed my hand so tightly that my hand began to hurt. His mom had so many wires around her. A breathing tube, heart monitor, IVs.
TRIGGER WARNING: DEPICTION OF PAST Eating Disorder. If this is a trigger for you, then scroll to the endnote and I will give you a short summary about what happened. Also below you’ll find some resources if you or anyone you know may be struggling with an eating disorder. Or if you would like to learn about different types and how to help someone who struggles with one. It's not just a female problem, males also have it and it may look different in different people. This is NOT meant to glorify eating disorders AT ALL.
He got so animated like I hadn't seen him before and it was nice to see him let his guard down. He doesn’t do that often.
And five months later, here we are. When Cas’ mom ended up in the hospital, we didn't think we’d be able to go for a moment, but everything worked out.
It was funny, while we were at this club, this couple asked if we wanted to have a foursome. Castiel politely declined, which to be honest, I didn't expect. Since you know he’s all about “experiences” and all. If you would've asked me in high school, I would have agreed without a second thought, but now, I don't want to share Cas. Thought Cas was going to say the same thing, but he said they weren't his type...
Charlie decided she’s taking a gap year and is now coordinating Larping conventions. She plans to apply to a computer company soon. Charlie’s like the little sister I never had. I’ll miss trivia night with her. I’m going to try to make it for a trivia night sometime in the near future, so that will be fun.
To top it off, this morning I dropped half a case of test strips and I picked up a lot of them but I think I'm going to be finding them for weeks.
I just texted her back saying that I didn't know yet but I was hanging out with the boyfriend and she texted back with a smiley face and to have fun… it was weird.
He leaned in and I'm pretty sure I did too. Before I knew it, our lips were touching and I was kissing Cas.
I’d go back to the music store during this break but Chuck closed the store down for the time being saying something about visiting his sister Amara.
I also have this routine for mealtimes that make things a bit easier. They're good habits, don't worry. For breakfast, I eat eggs or toast, sometimes cereal. Cereal makes me spike later, so I don't eat it often. At lunch, I have some type of sandwich or leftovers. I also have snacks throughout the day like fruit or crackers depending on where I am. If I’m steady and not hungry, sometimes I don't have a snack. For dinner, I guess it just has to do with portions. It isn't always fool-proof, but it's a good routine. Sometimes I’ll just wing it depending on what my blood sugar is or if I just feel like winging it. Carb counting has also been a big thing. If I know I’m going to have something that's high carb, I’ll sometimes reduce the number of carbs for that day or just pre-bolus 50% before I eat then 50% after.
If I had known what I know now, I would have said hi to Cas on the first day I met him and I wouldn't have danced around my feelings for him.
Kaia stayed to recover and nursed Journey about a month after but has since then returned to her traveling. We have an open adoption with her because we wanted her to stay in Journey’s life as much as possible. She visits every other month and she always manages to bring Cas and me a couple of souvenirs each from the last place she’s traveled to. Soon our house is going to be overrun by snow globes and key chains.
I remember when I met him for the first time at the hospital when I was four. I thought he was so small. It’s funny because we have a picture of me holding Sammy at the hospital, and dad had to help hold half of him because my arms were too little. Although... Sam was definitely a bigger baby than I had been. He also came two weeks late.
The second night I was pump-free, Cas and I were doing this thing with this ice cube thing in his room and it was nice not to have my pump or my CGM on me. I ended up going low right in the middle of its so that sucked. We just laughed about it and I had to drink some juice. The kisses just ended up being sweeter.
Cas wants to wear a blue suit for the wedding. I think I want to wear a traditional suit. I’m not opposed to other colors, it’s just I look damn good in a black suit.
I've learned a lot of tips from them. Now I'm not wasting insulin when I change the pod. I just pull it out with a syringe and use it for the next one.
When I said something about it, he just kind of shrugged it off and said when he wasn't working or skateboarding, he was doing art.
Right after my 8th birthday in July, Mom and he told me they were going to have a baby. Not too long after, we found out that it was going to be a girl and they were going to name her Anna. Life was going really well. I had a Dad, a Mom, and a sister on the way, we had a nice house, I loved my school, and I had even just started learning how to skateboard.
And happy spooky season! Castiel will hit it off with an origin story. Also unintentionally his logo looks like a giant pumpkin.
I told him no, and that there were a ton of things that were confusing, but that Cas wasn't one of them.
When we got there it was starting to get dark and everything was lit with lights everywhere. The smell of popcorn and cotton candy were amazing.
She only ate a little bit of her breakfast this morning, but at least it wasn't all one color. She even stole a bite of Sam’s pancakes. Sure she did it just to annoy him.
When I was released from the inpatient program, I found out that my parents had made a lot of changes at home. I was surprised when I found out that they had decided to take the locks off my room and the bathroom doors and replace them with nonlocking ones. Which was a pain ‘cause you know, locks are a wonderful thing...
Well, to begin, you have to know that my parents grew up in a religious cult in Ford City, Nebraska. I shouldn’t say that because it really isn't a cult but the more I hear about it, the more bizarre it sounds. They were just a really strict small town. My mom once told me that the women weren't allowed to wear pants or makeup and that everyone was expected to go to church. If a member didn't, the whole town would know about it and avoid them until they went to church again.
Turns out, Cas now wants four kids instead of one. He hated being the only child when he was growing up, and liked watching how “Sam and I interacted with each other.”
Last night was something else. I’ll admit that it wasn't the first time I thought of Cas that way. I think I started having these conflicting thoughts at the beginning of the summer. Specifically when we were chilling and listening to music on his bed that one night. I couldn't explain why it was that night.
I think we collectively just need a moment of silence for this unfortunate choice that she has made.
My family was weird around me during that time. I would find Sammy always looking at me, and my dad never talked to me like he used to. He was always quiet when he was around me. Or my mom would always be on the other side of the bathroom door if I took too long.
Don’t know if I’ve ever done a birthday letter. We do pretty much the same thing every year...nothing, but this year was a little different I guess.
Well, it took maybe a day and a half for me to absolutely fall in love with her. She chewed through two pairs of my house shoes when she was younger. Never chewed on any of Cas’ damn shoes…
They're pretty nice. When they told me they were sisters, I thought they were lying cuz they don't look alike at all. I guess I can't talk since Sam and I don't look like siblings either.
Well, it did the job because when I checked again like half an hour later, I was at 96 and going up. I knew that I would need to do a correction because of what I had just eaten. So, I set my pump to give myself enough in preparation for the rise later. It didn't even occur to me that I should've changed my pump or that my pump was acting up. I was only asleep for less than two hours when Dad came in and woke me up because I was high.
Once, Cas and I were fooling around in my bed because Garth always went to work at noon, but this time he ended up trading with someone else or something so he was in turn home a lot earlier than expected. It was the only time I was glad that I was on the top bunk. Cas hid under the covers for an hour till Garth got hungry. Cas’ hands kept wandering to certain places so he wasn't the only one who was sweating while Garth decided to chit-chat.
Anyway, I've been back to school for a couple of weeks now. Coming back the first day was a bitch. It would have been smart to go to sleep at a reasonable time, but I didn’t do that.
I'm training myself to start liking black coffee. Cas thinks black coffee is gross, but I don't think he gets a say considering most of his “coffee” is milk and sugar. It’s an assault on coffee drinkers everywhere; can’t even watch him make the stuff anymore.
I think this year is going to be better since I know more about my type 1. Not saying I’m a pro or anything but I'm definitely better than I was last year.
I’m sure he’ll win her over with his southern charm. If not, I may have to go down there myself to knock some sense into him.
It’s been fucking awesome. We get to blast any music we want and Mr. Chuck doesn’t care If I need to eat.
Even though I will never understand or agree with his past choices, someday, I want to have that moment where I open my front door and he’s on the other side.
For a while, Dad had his eyes on moving out of Kansas, but I think he realized that this house was a way to still be close to Mom and all the memories. She was the one who put up all the pictures in the house. She picked the house out and painted the outside banana yellow. Dad would always call it snot yellow when he thought she wasn't listening, but I think he’s grown to like it.
And all that was annoying on its own, but I think the worst thing they did was take away the scale in my bathroom. That annoyed the shit out of me more than anything else they had done. Before, I was checking my weight around three times a day. Once in the morning, once when I got home from school and at least once after dinner. By that point, it had become a habit. I guess the feeling of not having one could be compared to not having a clock in the room when you’re at school and taking a timed test... but more stressful.
When my Mom didn't come home on one Tuesday night, I got a little worried. Her cell would ring a little then go straight to voicemail meaning she was choosing to ignore the messages.
After that, we went to my house, made out in the car for a little while before we went inside. One thing led to another, and then we ended up inside and in the shower, which I was pretty down for. I’ll try anything once. Nothing too fancy, just hand and blowjobs. It was pretty successful. Harder than it is on tv by the way.
It was like eating chalk. Dad didn’t believe me until he tried one. Sam didn't think it was that bad. I don't think changing brands or flavors will do much.
Charlie had this little fling with this fairy chick and Benny and I got to put our battleship skills to the test.
I don’t think for a while I believed that I had a problem. Even though everyone was telling me that it was a problem, I saw it as a normal routine. I thought that since my body didn't look sick, that I wasn't sick. Which was dangerous and had led to a lot of relapses in the beginning.
In February, I made the mistake of reading Cas’ text before a presentation. Big mistake. It was some crude joke about him being a pizza man and it involved pepperoni in places that pepperoni probably shouldn't go…
I got pretty lucky that night in the back of Cas’ truck if you know what I mean. Turns out my new favorite song is Rock and Roll Fantasy.
I even learned a little bit about D and D. Sam even said he’s going to try to teach me some more this summer so that should be fun... All I know is that he’s going to be sorry for teaching me because even though it’s not a competitive game, I’m totally gonna smoke him.
I’m supposed to go with Kevin next week to help him pick out his Halloween costume too. Don’t know when I became the Halloween costume Guru, but he and Charlie always go head to head to see who has a better costume. He’s going to dress up like the little mermaid and I think he just might win this year.
The first thing we got was food at around 11 since Benny kept complaining that he was hungry. Which I didn't understand since he ate a breakfast sandwich before we got on the bus and 4 of my snacks. I don't usually let him eat any of my snacks ever but I just wanted him to shut up.
Now that I’m older, a part of me wonders if I had said something sooner, you wouldn't have been in such a mess. I know if I ever told you this, you’d just say it was all your fault or something.
When we got there, it was explained that I had sugar in my urine. They did a few tests with my blood and then they told me that my blood sugar was at 504 and that I had type 1 diabetes.
“You and I both know that that’s not true.” Cas was quiet after that. He felt as Cas squeezed his shoulder and he immediately regretted lashing out like that. “Dean, just please come lie with me. My last donation is
Dean sat up straighter to rolled his shoulders, but it didn't do much for all the knots in his back and neck. He supposed leaning over a desk for a few hours would do that to a person. When Cas and he had moved into the apartment 5 years ago, Cas had insisted on getting a stool instead of a chair to help their posture. Dean was usually pretty good about sitting up straight until he started drawing and losing himself in his art.
I didn't remember much, but I remember shaking so badly that I had a difficult time dialing 911. Just thinking about that day brings chills down my spine.
When you turned 3, you cried on your birthday because you didn't want to get older. It took your mom and me a while to calm you down.
I'm back! happy new year! I had to change a few things around this chapter but I like it. It delves into an old memory that Dean had of his mom that was originally supposed to be in the second chapter.
Benny’s comment gnawed on me so much that I decided to invite them over and tell the three of them. They were shocked. Charlie said she felt dumb for not noticing anything at which I told her that it was because I was good at hiding it. Kevin asked about my recovery. Benny apologized, and the three of them told me that they'd always be there for me.
He had to mix this powder stuff with this liquid stuff before putting it in the syringe. We didn't really know how you would react to it.
After everyone left, Dad and Sammy gave me a few presents. I told them that they didn't have to, but they just shushed me. I got Diabetes for Dummies from Dad, and we all laughed about it like we wouldn’t all be using it in the next following weeks. Sammy’s gift hadn't come yet, so he showed me a picture of this amulet that had this figure with horns on it and a medical tag that said type 1 diabetes on it. He said just in case I was around people who didn't know about my condition. I gave him a hug and messed up his hair for good measure.
A few days after that, we got hit with a 4. Like 10 stores and also my house got some damage. Actually my room got the most damage because a tree fell on it. We were all gone that Tuesday when it happened. Came home with a tree in my room and the biggest hole between mine and Sam’s room. There was glass everywhere.
His fingers hurt from how tight his lover is holding them but he wouldn’t trade the feeling for anything.
Cas also has this weird stuffed animal mouse thing on his bed. I asked him why he still slept with a stuffed animal, he said he was holding it for a friend, and turned up the music. It was kind of weird. I know Cas has friends outside of the group that he sometimes hangs out with but it was just a weird thing to say if he wasn’t joking.
I have decided to do wrestling again this year. I wasn't going to at first, but I thought since this is my senior year and all, I’d give it another go. Also, Benny finally got to me. We have our first practice next week and I’m pretty excited.
Dad had to use the Impala that day, so Cas came to pick me up in his truck yesterday at around 7 pm. When I opened his car door, he handed me a can of diet Coke that said share a coke with Dean. A CAN OF DIET COKE.
When I was 13, I found my piggy bank shattered in my room. I had been saving up all my birthday money for a new skateboard so I was devastated. Nick or Mom never brought it up, but I knew they had done it. After that, I started hiding my money in these old pairs of tall rain boots at the back of my closet. I ended up saving enough to buy the black and orange angel wing skateboard that I have now.
“Fuck you. We’re only 23. Let’s not forget you’re five months older than I am!” He said with an eye roll. “Are you almost finished?” Cas asked as he placed his feet on the ground.
When we started walking back, Cas made me carry him on my back a lot of the way. His excuse was because of the pain in his knee. That jerk, his knee was completely fine.
I also love the fact that even though you say you don't read, the amount of books in your room has always told a different story.
I ended up eating almost the whole pack pretty fucking fast. Afterward, I felt alright at first and I felt full for the first time that day.
This time, though, he said he brought tape for my feet, conveniently not giving me any reason to say no.
I just sat there for a minute feeling like… guilty. It reminded me of my days when I would binge anything that I could get my hands on. Back then it was even weirder food combinations. I knew it obviously wasn’t the same situation but I felt the same.
Just as quickly as it started, I was already moving back because I HAD JUST KISSED CAS. My friend Cas. My really good friend Cas. My really good friend Cas who was a boy.
Benny, Cas, and I ended up leaving early since we had to catch a flight to Florida. Sam just had to put a banner that said JUST MARRIED on Baby. Thank God, he didn't use paint.
Now, I wake up a half-hour earlier, check my blood sugar, get dressed, check my feet for any sores, take my long and rapid-acting insulin about 15 min before I eat, tease Sam over breakfast, check my numbers again to make sure I’m in range and then go to school. I also have to show Dad my readings before I can drive Baby and do a supply checklist each time I leave the house.
I’ve known Benny since the second grade when he got the flu and puked on my shoes and feet (I didn't wear sandals for a long time after that) there was no way I would ever date him. I mean there's also the fact that he’s my best friend. If he were the last person on earth, I still wouldn't crush on him. I’m sure that would be breaking some cosmic rule or some shit.
After that, we ended up watching Die Hard AKA the ultimate Christmas movie and I don't care what anyone else says.
I told him that it was the last thing that I had wanted to do and then I just started spilling everything that I had been thinking the last few days. From the fact that I had had feelings for him for a little while now, but didn't know what to do with them since I had never had feelings for another guy before; to the fact that I was an idiot for pulling away while I was kissing him on the Ferris wheel. I told him I didn't reject him on the Ferris wheel and that if he didn't like me any more than that was fine even though that was furthest from the truth.
My first class everyday is Algebra. Benny’s in my class and that’s pretty fun. We don't have assigned seats so it’s even better.
The next 6 hours were fine. You just slept on and off. You drank some water and ate a little bit of chicken noodle soup to satisfy dad.
They never found out who did it, but they found writing on the wall in blood that said “For my daughter -S.C.”
Thanks to Hearofcathedrals (Ao3) for reading all the diabetic scenes over and making suggestions and corrections!
We went to this pizza place; one of the best pizzas I've ever had. It had the perfect combination of pepperoni and cheese on it. Don't even get me started on the crust…
He doesn't talk about his family really at all. It’s weird that all three of his parents aren't in the picture.
I have now lost faith in Bobby and Ellen. They could have at least gotten her a 1975 Volkswagen GTI. I mean it’s no Baby, with her 327 four-barrel, 275 horsepower… but it would've been better than the bug. I’m sure Bobby had tons of classics in his garage yard to steer her in the right direction, but alas...
She's 2 years old now but we’ve had her for a year. Cas was the one who got her from the shelter. Surprised to come home from work one day to find a dog greeting me. Cas and I actually got into a big fight about the dog. By that time, we had been married for a little bit but we hadn't talked about having any animals. Neither of us had ever had one growing up so I just assumed he didn’t want any.
Benny was an absolute pro. He said he and Andrea had been kayaking a few other times. Sam and Kevin, on the other hand, definitely needed some practice.
After that we just took a long nap and just lied around for the rest of the day playing games, eating, and swimming. It was relaxing.
She absolutely loves Daisy. It was funny because Daisy was always protective of Kaia when she was pregnant. Is still protective of the both of them. She actually made Journey laugh for the first time when she was around 4 months. Cas and I had been trying for weeks and all Daisy had to do was run around the living room after this burst of energy.
Even though I had been on this roller coaster of a ride with all the emotions I had felt, you were my one constant.
He still nerds out about theater stuff; wants me to take him to the Wizard of Oz showing at my school. I think he’s going to join the theater club again like he did in elementary school next year.
Cas got a little red on the second day while he was wearing sunscreen. I offered to get him sunscreen with a higher SPF but he said he would be fine. Cas ended up getting a sunburn on the third day. He was in a lot of pain the first night so I picked him up some aloe and better sunscreen. His skin started peeling yesterday. Hate to say it, but it was pretty awesome; reminded me of peeling off dried up glue. Under the peeling was a suntan through.
We also went jet skiing well most of us at least. Kevin and charlie didn't since they had heard horror stories. Benny and Dorothy rode on one and Cas and I took turns on another. I was legit scared for my life when Cas started to drive. Thought we were going to flip over at least 5 times. At least we got to see some dolphins during that whole thing.
The only remotely interesting thing that happened that day was we got a new student, Castiel Novak in English. We actually don't really get a ton of new people. He wore a trench coat, and that was... kind of cool I guess.
I think it's been there for a long time now. Looking back, I think it started around the time of your eating disorder.
Got a Happy Birthday text from Cassie. I said thanks and thought it was going to be it, but then she asked me about my plans for the day. Was pretty surprised by her text actually. We haven't spoken since last summer. I guess she had found one of my old CDs and wanted to send it back, but I told her to keep it.
Since we’ve been here, we’ve done a lot. First, we went to the art museum. I thought it was boring, but Cas loved it and seeing him get all excited was amusing. But the time we Truckhedge on our way from that college weekend visit was still better.
I just got back from the Lake at Bobby and Ellen’s house with Jo, Sam, and Cas. Ellen even made us some sandwiches. The water was still pretty cold, but once you got in, it was okay.
Mom just laughed and told my Dad it was a sign to stop eating them, and told me to go scrub my teeth.
I swear if the color could actually drain from your face, all of mine would have been seeping into my shirt.
Michael, my birth father who was 17 at the time, was the son of one of the higher up leaders. My mother, Eve, was 16. Her parents had moved there when she was 10. Michael and my mom started seeing each other in secret. At the time, Michael was going to be married to this lady named Layla when he turned 18.
It hasn't always been easy because we're both stubborn sons of a bitches but we’ve gotten through it. When we do get in big fights, we found out early on that we need time away from each other. Not like going to a hotel away from each other, just being in separate rooms for a while. I got sent to the couch because of something stupid I said and I woke up in the morning to find Cas wedged between me and the couch. We decided that no matter how mad we were at one another, we would always go to bed and wake up next to each other.
Tessa went to the hotel to sleep for a little bit around 1 pm since she was going to take the night shift. Things got a little crazy when this guy with sunglasses came cruising in at around 7 o'clock that night.
I sat there while he got his pencils sharpened, then finally I said fuck it. I took the robe off and told him that I wanted him to draw me like one of his french boys.
Meeting Bela made the hospital bearable, but as much as I hated the hospital, being at home was worse. At least at the hospital, I had a few people who were going through the same things as me. No offense to Sammy, Mom, or Dad but no matter how much they'd try, they'd never fully understand what I was going through.
Cas and his dad still hang out from time to time. Layla and he are supposed to be visiting us in February. They’ve gotten closer over the years but Cas definitely holds back parts of himself which is understandable but at least he tries. I’m just glad they even have a relationship.
A couple of weeks went by and people started to notice that the Stilinskis were missing. When they went to search for them, they found a gruesome scene at the house. The scratches and damage were inhuman. The rest of the house was wrecked and one of the windows had been completely shattered like whatever had come out of it had been huge.
Yes, that’s right, Cas has learned how to make bread. One day at the beginning of December, he said he was going to do it after seeing something on Instagram about it. And he wanted to do it without my help. I thought he was absolutely crazy. The guy who hadn't spent more than probably 3 days in the kitchen wanted to make something as difficult as bread. It took a lot of failed attempts but he actually is really good at it now.
No, but we really didn't sleep for at least the first year. When you got to be around 5 months old, your Mom wanted to try sleep training with you. It may or may not have been partly my fault that it took us a while to get you to sleep. I was a sucker when you started crying. It took months, but after that, you slept like a charm.
I think the sadness got better once you started recovery but then it was, like, full-fledged when Mom died. Dad was putting too much energy into work to notice how you had trouble getting out of bed every morning before school for about a month. On the weekends you wouldn't even come out of your room. Or you’d go to the bunker for hours.
I said again that I wasn't binging and purging, and added that- how could I if there was an hour bathroom hold after we ate?
We did a bunch of shit to get ready for the baby. Both of our families either came to help or sent stuff. Tessa helped us paint and put the room together. Dad and Sam helped me build the crib. Don’t think I’ve heard Sam curse as much in his whole entire life. Balthazar knitted the baby an elephant and Cas’ mom gave us a list of things she remembers using and things she didn’t use which helped. Kaia didn’t want to find out the gender but we painted the room this cucumber green color.
Sometimes I’d tell them a little bit about it, but mostly I just kind of gave them a nod or shrug. After that, I went back to work.
Well, I’m gonna go take a nap. Last night threw my whole day off. Cas wanted to hang out today but I think I’m just gonna sleep.
It took 8 hours. I slept most of the drive because I knew that running with no sleep would be pretty bad for my blood sugar so Tessa and Cas drove for most of the ride. I woke up a few times and overheard them telling stories about his mom I hadn't heard before. Like the time his mom picked up a hitchhiker... Jesus.
I went to help mainly because I was going to walk past him anyway, and I’m not that much of a douchebag.
She told me that it took 32 hours in total to birth me. She ended up pushed for a while before she had to have an emergency C-section.
During breakfast, Sam kept talking about some field trip he and his history class were taking to the wax museum. Bela was telling him about her experience. I couldn't really focus on the full conversation because I was too busy wondering when his hair had become so long… it’s down to his shoulders now.
It was an interesting experience getting to be around Kaia every day. She loved heavy metal music but also instrumental. She loved to cook… but she didn't cook well at all. She made this… dish that had a can of split pea soup, a can of tomato soup, and a can of beef broth. And that all was gross… but okay… but then she added two soup cans of milk and some wine… well she didn't have wine so she added apple juice… I still have nightmares about that dish. Thank god Cas offered to take us to a restaurant instead.
Wrestling has been going pretty well lately. I have to check my sugars more during tournaments and practices. I check my blood sugar an hour before my match, then 15 minutes before, then afterward. I also carry around a lot of snacks and juice packets.
By that time, I had also started making these crazy rules for myself. Like I couldn’t eat after 10 pm or before 7 am. Like I could only eat bread on Saturdays, unless it was pancakes. That, I could eat any day. I had to also read the labels on food items, and I could only eat pie if I had done some sort of exercise that day. Lastly, I would never puke up pie.
When I closed myself in the bathroom and looked in that mirror, all I saw was this little kid. The 11-year-old kid who was clueless about his mom’s problem. The 13-year-old kid who knew something was wrong with his mom but didn’t tell anyone. The 15-year-old kid who was shaking so bad the morning he found his mom choking on the floor, that it took him three tries to dial three simple numbers.
I think we would have been better off if the other team didn't freeze Kevin a couple of times. I called Castiel a traitor, and he just gave me a grin and a shrug.
He brought up how I had been eating more than usual and how fast I had eaten at Tessa’s a few weeks back. He also said I looked really tired. Which, I admit I have been a little tired lately, but it’s because of the wrestling season. Not what he was thinking.
Found out that he was also in my art class. Guess I should have invited him to sit with me, but I was pretty tired. It was a few days later, I was walking to art class when I heard someone banging on their locker.
Oh yeah, I forgot to put this in the last letter but Cas and I went to our first college party in November.
I still prick my finger to get the most accurate reading, but it's nice not having to do it as much.
We also celebrated his 18th birthday. He got teary eyes when we started singing Happy Birthday. He just brushed it off and said it was allergies. I had an idea why but everyone else just laughed. Later, he told me that his birthdays had just become a strong reminder of how the only one in his family that cared about his birthday had been his aunt Tessa. Now he was happy that he had five others that cared too.
The airplane ride was… don't even get me started. Gripped Cas’ hand almost the whole ride. I personally wanted a drink or something to take the edge off, but I also didn't feel like doing any sort of exercise at the airport when my blood sugar started rising because of said alcohol.
He glanced at his watch. 9 o'clock. Cas was usually up by around 7. The pain medication that he sometimes took, when it got too painful, always made him so sleepy.
Every day, I live with this constant struggle of who I am now and who I once was. When my dad began to question me, I felt like the old me again. I felt like Dad no longer trusted me.
Cas’ mom has been free from drugs for one year now and has regained most of her mobility. She ended up having multiple relapses after the coma which was expected. As someone who went through recovery myself, I know that it’s not a straight line. She’s been going to her meetings and has a sponsor. She has not come to visit us since we’ve gotten the house but she did visit us at the apartment. Despite all that’s happened between Cas and her, their relationship is really good. They FaceTime at least every other weekend. She looks better than she did too. Cas look’s a lot like her. After her last relapse a year ago, she shaved her head bald. It’s since grown into a messy bob thing. She also met someone new.
The place was a mess. Cas and I helped clean it up afterward. I was pretty pissed at the whole thing actually but I kept my cool pretty well.
She walked into the music store close to closing time. That was enough to stun me, but then it got worse. Turns out she was picking up her daughters Alex and Claire.
But things were going pretty good until it started raining at the end of the day. We just went into this mall and got ice cream and some souvenirs. Sam wanted a shirt so I got him that and I got my dad a pen. Exciting stuff I know.
I went to Dallas, Texas with Benny, Max, Garth, and Sam to a strip club and then a bar because why the hell not? I drank just enough to feel buzzed and loose and it was nice. After Eye of the Tiger came on, this guy named Lee called me up to sing because he said I “can't just keep lip syncing Eye of the Tiger when no one was watching.” He picked the song “Good Ol’ Boys” and I ended up inviting him to the wedding right then and there. The best part was that he actually came. Surprised the hell out of me and even got us a pack of beer.
Bobby got Sam and me this pretty cool Supernatural creature book. Don’t really read a lot, but it’s got some interesting creatures in it. Like the wendigo. It’s like this human that has been cursed because they’ve eaten human flesh.
I also ordered a burger for me and got his dad a shake before I came over to his house. His whole family knows me so I just walked in. He does the same whenever he comes over to my house. Anyway, I found him finishing up his workout in his backyard.
It was Christmas 2011, and I was 10. Also, the year I almost burnt the house down, making said cookies.
That meant I had to be reintroduced to Oreos… ham and turkey sandwiches… pasta, chips, and salsa… God, the list was endless. Once you’ve thrown something up like that, it's hard to enjoy that food ever again if your intention isn't to eat a ton of it then puke it up. Today, I can eat most of those foods just fine.
When we got home, I changed my sensor on my CGM, ate something, did a correction, then I went to bed again.
It's a little different from my continuous glucose monitor but still kind of the same mechanics when inserted. Another difference is that I change the pod more often than once a week. This one is like every few days. I have more steps too like filling the pod with insulin which I obviously don't have to do anything with my CGM.
The pain meds they gave me did a few weird things to my blood sugar. I had to program my insulin pump to give me less insulin because I kept going low.
Cas knows about Cassie, but I only told him that we broke up because of type 1, which was a half-truth. I’m not sure when I’ll tell Cas the full truth. Guess I’m just waiting for the right moment. The last time didn't end so well and I don't want us to end, you know?
Just to let you know, you have never made me feel like our relationship should be a dirty little secret like Dick had. I have also never felt used or like I was using you.
Can’t wait to go back in the fall. The whole table ended up having a debate when Cas and Tessa got pineapple on their pizza.
This car is a part of the family. My parents got her right before my mom found out she was pregnant with me. It’s crazy to think that someone sold her in the first place. She’s a great ass car.
For Cassie and my first date, we went to a park and just walked around and talked. It was actually nice. She’s not like my past girlfriends.
The other day, Sam told me that I was awesome because I was doing the work of an organ. I laughed and told him to shut up only to stop the ache in my throat. I was justifiably in a weird mood, and Sam saying that gave me this little extra boost I didn't know I needed.
He refused to eat anything after I got him out of the shower and dressed. When I finally got him tucked into bed and bandaged up again, he was still sniffling.
Funniest thing, the damn restaurant’s music box was broken and only played the song ‘Heat of the Moment’, which annoyed the crap out of Sam.
We’ve been out of college for a little while now. We actually went to our 10-year high school reunion in January. Cas and I both didn’t want to go but somehow Charlie and Benny and Kevin convinced us to. It was pretty boring at first and we ended up getting each other off in the supply closet. When we got to the party we bumped into Cassie. We talked for a while Cas was catching up with some other people. She’s a news reporter on tv. It made sense since in high school she was really into writing.
So after seeing Bela in that hospital bed, I gave Benny my scale and told him that he had to get rid of it, no questions asked. That was actually plan B. With Plan A, I ended up taking the batteries out and throwing it away, but then I ended up taking it out of the trash later to use it one more time. That’s when I knew that I couldn't have it near me.
The weight was for obvious reasons, but the urine test was to show if I was dehydrated and the blood test was for checking on any imbalances. Like electrolyte imbalances. When I was binging and purging I'd lose electrolytes like sodium and potassium which you kind of need to live. And when those electrolytes are imbalanced, well, you can get nasty things like seizures, cardiac arrest, and numbness. The blood is also checked because sometimes people with Bulimia had anemia or bleeding in their esophagus.
I took myself out for pie to celebrate, and Cas joined me, though, he didn't know that I was celebrating.
Forgot to unhook the transmitter part of my CGM, but it ended up being fine. Though, the adhesive is starting to come off. It’s day 8 out of 10 so I might just change it completely.
I can never forget the moment Dad told me the news. I didn’t really think much about the fact that Sam and Dad were standing in the place my mom should have been.
During the class, he started looking up some Greek bread/desserts, and he found this thing called Baklava. Only, no matter how many times he tried to make it, he just couldn't get it right. He got super frustrated. It was kinda funny watching him get so mad. So, to cheer him up, I jokingly said, “I should just take you to Greece to learn.” I thought it was a pretty funny joke, till I looked over and saw this smile creep up on his face.
It’s been four years now, and this guilt that I feel, has gotten… better… is that even the right word? It has gotten better but sometimes it just hits me out of nowhere.
Wow 1k hits! Thank you to everyone who has stuck around! And thank you to everyone who has COMMENTED. It truly makes my day!
Anyway, I drive a 1967 Impala. I’m hoping Dad will pass it on to me someday. We all call her Baby. She’s a big part of the family.
Cas read me this hilarious comic called The Trickster. Said his late step-dad, Gabriel wrote it and told me a little about him. He seemed like a really great guy. I could tell that Gabriel really had meant a lot to Cas by the way he was talking about him.
Cas asked me a couple of weeks before. We were out in the bunker just chilling and playing music. It was right after school and it was a little chilly but we had gotten banned from being in my room together. I was finishing up some math homework and Cas was lying down looking up at the sky.
It was the only time I raised my voice, but I told her that she didn’t need to handle anything. That at the end of the day she wasn’t the one who had deal with this, I was.
When I handed the mouse to him, he smiled. Although it was weak, for the first time that day, he smiled.
We ended up just watching a couple of episodes of Game of Thrones while we waited. Decided to keep that from Sam because he’d be pissed that we had watched it without him.
It wasn’t that I felt behind, I was able to work through a lot of school work at the hospital, but I had missed a lot of days being in the hospital.
So, Cas and I are in Greece. Yup Greece. I should be asleep, but I’m not because I’m like a bat... always sleeping in the day time. Get it?
There was this one day I came home from school and decided to eat chips and salsa and I wasn’t gonna throw up because I was just gonna start the fasting process over again but I just started feeling weird. And even though I didn’t want to, I threw up anyway.
(Ao3). Each of them just enhanced this story in different ways and I couldn't have asked for a better team. Also thank you to
When he put the ring on my finger, he let out a sigh of relief. He said he was nervous that he had gotten the wrong size since it was tungsten and he couldn't get it resized.
They didn't tear the house down, but they did take out the bodies and cleaned up the blood. Nobody wanted to buy it until 20 something Ruby Johnson did in 1875. All good until they found her body too, ice cold. Now people say that all the victims that Lydia and Stiles killed roam the house because they're stuck somehow. Some say they've gone vengeful.
He also never wakes up for his alarm. It goes like this: his alarm wakes me up and I wake Garth up. Usually by means of throwing a pillow at him. I’ve gotten so used to it that I can do it while I’m half asleep.
I’ve gotten to know Pamela and Ash since I’ve started working there. I thought Ash was just a stoner (which he definitely is), but he said he used to go to MIT until he got caught hacking their computer system. Pamela is pretty badass. I’m pretty sure she's my age but already has four tattoos. I don’t know who Jesse is, but they’re one lucky son of a bitch.
My plan was to look at architecture, but it was so boring I thought about walking out in the middle of class twice. So, I decided to go to a mechanical engineering class instead after hearing this girl talk about building a robot. Never wanted to build a robot before, but she made it sound awesome. I think that’s what I want to major in now.
We have random things in the house that some of Cas’ art clients have given him. Someone gave him this doll from hell that’s creepy as shit and I turn it around every time I see it. I hate it but Cas thinks it’s cute. I keep telling him that scary dolls aren't cute but he won't listen. If we’re found murdered one day, It was for sure the doll. No doubt about it.
When Dick left, I felt so lonely again. He kept my mind off of everything that had happened. He may have used me, but I used him too.
So, back in November, Sam told me that they were going to be doing the Addams Family sometime in January.
Benny and I have been friends for a long time, I realized quickly that he had no filter. Charlie pretty much told him that she’d rip him a new one if he ever said that again and Kevin told him to shut up. I sort of laughed at the situation, but it kind of hurt.
In January, when I was 15, one morning before school, I found my Mom choking on her own vomit in the living room.
At first, the trip didn’t go as planned. When we got there, Sammy immediately wanted to go swimming. Wearing my swimsuit made me feel uncomfortable. The mosquitoes also ate me alive too. When it came to dinner, it was the easiest task. I think I took a liking to cooking because it gave me back some of the control I had lost. Mom and Sammy ended up helping me with dinner that night. We made foil dinners over the campfire. Even Dad pitched in, by dropping one of the foil dinners on the ground... When it became time to eat, we had the best conversation about Sammy’s next play, Shrek. Guess the best part of that camping trip was that nobody said anything about how slow I ate.
We agreed to keep it lowkey at school. Not that we're trying to keep it a secret, it’s just that we're not trying to be gross. Cassie and I didn't really do much at school either when we were dating. Cas and I hold hands sometimes or kiss when we meet at school.
I could remember it being the day before New Years; that morning, I had slept in until 2 pm. My Dad made a joke that I was going through a growth spurt. It was a little after Sammy and I started playing catch with snowballs, that I began to feel drained. I went to go throw a snowball to Sammy, and everything was fine until he threw the snowball back at me and I started seeing black spots. Then, it was like my arms suddenly stopped working and the icy substance hit me right in the face. Suddenly, I was on my knees and Sam was next to me. I couldn't talk or hear anything.
Wrestling season is officially over. We came in second place during the tournament. The group, Dad, and Sam came to watch my match. Almost lost against this guy named Derek Hale. I won because I’m good, but also, he used up all his energy in the beginning and had nothing left at the end.
While we were all waiting for the smell of fresh-baked cookies, we got the smell of something burning and the sound of the fire alarm. That day I learned a very valuable life lesson about the differences between wax and parchment paper.
What else… oh yeah we got a dog. Her name’s Daisy. She's a German Shepard and she's the best dog ever. Yes, Dean Winchester just said that and he actually meant it.
While we were there, we’d do our homework or just talk about stupid shit. The other day we had an argument about whether or not you should bite or lick your icecream.
When my friends asked why I couldn't hang out with them from time to time, I’d tell them I had a lot of homework or that I was spending time with my family. The last one wasn't a complete lie. My family and I did start camping more often, but not every weekend like I made it seem. I actually had group therapy that I was attending after school.
I still do, just not 4 days a week like he thinks. Benny is doing about 2 days a week now that we're done with wrestling.
Dean and his dad fight with each other and now his dad wants to take him to go get a check-up because he thinks Dean's eating disorder is back.
He sat in the seat behind me. He said hi to Cassie and me on the way to his desk, but that was pretty much it.
I think I was a little too enthusiastic when I said I was a huge fan of Tessa’s diner, but he didn't seem to notice.
When you were 11, you and Sammy thought jumping on a bean bag would be a great idea because your favorite wrestler did it… till it exploded all over the living room. Little pieces of Styrofoam were everywhere for weeks. Mom didn't let you guys watch wrestling for months after that.
From that year on, we started making those same cookies. I guess in a way it’s brought us all closer.
But, lying there with Cas was nice. We hang out a lot, but we just don't get a lot of time with just the two of us alone.
Uncle Bobby came over with Aunt Ellen and Cousin Jo for Christmas breakfast. Bobby's best friend Rufus even came. Dad made a bet with Mom that if she lost the game Werewolf before him, she would have to make chocolate chip cookies. I’m not sure why Mom took the bet in the first place, we all know Dad always found a way to cheat.
When He does finally comes, he saw stars. He saw shades of purples and blues and pinks all at once behind his lids. The pressure that was in his belly is now shooting through his cock. He loses all sense of everything. The only thing he understood was that everything that was his, would always belong to Cas. Cas is his, and he is Cas’ and nothing would ever change that. At this moment he has no doubts that their souls are intertwined and were always meant to be. Nothing can ever tear them apart, not even death.
The photo album contained pictures of Michael and her. In one picture, he was in a suit and she was in a yellow dress. As I said before, I had only seen a few pictures of him and it had been hard to tell his features fully, but now I realized that I actually looked a lot like him. The biggest knot formed in my throat till it felt like I couldn't breathe and I excused myself.
While we ate, we played music and just visited. I was trying to explain to Jo why Die Hard was the greatest Christmas movie ever. Bobby told stories about all the pranks Dad and he would do to each other in the Army. I took notes. Sammy’s due for another prank soon. Gotta keep them on our toes. And I couldn’t hear all that Sam and Ellen were talking about, but I definitely heard Sam say something about Celion Dion.
Yesterday the group and I walked on the boardwalk and saw some fireworks. Cas and I also rode on the Ferris wheel.
He asked me how I had been feeling in general. I told him that I had been feeling okay but had been feeling a little tired since the wrestling season had started. Dad supplied that I had also been drinking a lot at dinner time on top of going to the bathroom a lot lately.
I just came back from your favorite pie place. I’m sure you remember me or your mom telling you the story of when you tried your first piece of pie when you were 2.
During my recovery, I guess the turning point for me was the camping trip about a couple of months after I had ended up in the hospital. Part of recovery was also reconnecting with my family too. In those three years, not only had I isolated myself from food, but I had also isolated myself from my family too. I hadn’t had an honest relationship with them since the whole thing started.
What else….oh, I know a lot of people at school, but I wouldn’t consider myself popular. I hang out mainly with my three best friends: Benny, Charlie, and Kevin. I live with my brother, Sam, and my dad, John, in Kansas; my dad’s a project manager for a power plant and my Mom was a dentist.
Dr. Walker, my pediatrician, said I was lucky that I was able to be treated early. Some people went years without anyone knowing, eventually causing more severe heart, kidney, and blood pressure problems.
Benny is in the process of finally opening up his own restaurant. He’s still in the early stages of building it and it’s going to be named Heart and Soul when it opens a year and a half from now. He and Andrea eloped after their twins were born. They ended up having another kid 11 months after. Andrea was pissed when she found out. She made him go stay at his brother’s for a few days.
Meg went with the surprisingly sentimental speech about the time during a field trip he did homeschooling and she and Cas both got lost at World of Fun and they spent most of the day together until they were back with their group again. Then in true Meg fashion, she ended with, “if you hurt him I’ll kill you.”
I was sitting outside for lunch when I saw Castiel on his skateboard. I yelled his name and he completely wiped out. Ended up getting a nasty scrape on his knee. Felt kind of bad. Good thing I had some first aid stuff in my backpack. Even gave him two packs of Jelly Beans for good measure.
After a few attempts, we got the locker open. I think the last number might have been wrong. I peeped a pretty cool looking skateboard in his locker that was orange underneath and had some cool black angel wing on it. We walked to art together and ended up sitting next to each other too. To be honest I took art because I thought it would be easy.
Two weeks after I turned 11, I came home from skateboarding with a friend to find my Mom and Nick on the couch with this white stuff on the table. My mom’s excuse was that life had been hard for her and that the drugs had helped. Which, I didn't quite understand. Life had been hard for me too and I wasn't doing drugs.
It took a while but by the 3rd time around, I wasn't clutching the crossbar as much. We just talked about random things. Cas talked about some new items that Tessa was adding to the menu. I talked about the next songs he had to listen to.
We were both surprised when we saw her with a new short bob. From the time I had known her, her hair hadn't been shorter than the middle of her back.
Anyway, I ended up winning the first game of UNO but she won the second game. When I was about to leave, I asked her if she was going to be okay. She just rolled her eyes and said scouts honor.
I mean we’ve become really good friends since January, but I’ve never thought of Cas that way before.
Anyway, he was living with his grandparents temporarily working on their farm. He was 17. We met at the general store. He gave me one of these grins, complimented my skateboard, and asked me where the best place for cupcakes was and we just hit it off from there.
the way his legs tighten around his waist so tight that Dean knows his ribs are going to be sore for a couple of days.
Cas kind of got the short end of the stick, but it’s his own damn fault. He told me at the beginning of December that he wanted these winter boots so I was like “hell yeah I’ll get you those boots”. But last week, he was wearing the same boots that he told me to get him. He just said he forgot he told me.
Sometimes I would attempt to skip out on lunch or the snacks I was supposed to be eating, but my friends would always hold me accountable.
I was a pretty tough kid, but this went on for a couple of months. And when the 7th graders and a few of the 8th started whispering the nickname behind my back, something just snapped.
The rain started pouring even more when we stepped outside. So pretty much when we all got on the bus we were still soaking wet. I put on the shirt that said Kansas on it so I was a little dryer. I was sleepy on the way back but I stayed up to talk to Cas. I got to take a peek at a project he was doing for art class.
For my birthday Cas gave me something pretty awesome. He invited me over before lunch and said he had a surprise for me. I knew that he was a kinky little shit when he pulled out the blindfold and made me lay on his bed since his aunt was out of town.
I wanted to tell him to take his money and that while I was glad that I had gotten closure, I didn't need anything from him.
Dad found an old picture of the first time she made it for all of us. I was 7, and that summer my freckles… I don't know... came in? Not sure if you say it like that but I could remember that I cried because I tried to wash them off but I couldn't get them off. I didn't understand that they were permanent. For the rest of the summer, I would make sure they were still there every morning. Mom would call them angel kisses and that made me feel better.
All I gotta say is that at least it wasn't geometry. Almost failed the end of the year test last year.
Michael didn't look like I thought he would. For so long, I had imagined him as this guy who was very tall, always wearing a suit and business-like. This Michael was the same height as me and had on a t-shirt with a plaid button up on over that and dark jeans that had a hole in them.
I told her if anyone ever asked about the burger, to make sure she included that the original Dean has type 1. I’d pay some big bucks to see their shocked faces.
And last but not least Kevin… I kid you not he just listened to podcasts. Not even Charlie was into it. She ended up putting in her own headphones. I mouthed ‘what the fuck’ to both Cas and Benny. They were both trying and failing to contain their laughter.
I had realized that I had been hungry for a really long time. And for once, I wasn’t just talking about food. I had been hungry for my family. I had been hungry for those late-night talks with Sammy, for my Mom’s warm hugs, for Dad’s crazy stories. I got closer to my family in that one night than I had in over three years.
Then he said that we should think about breaking up and that’s where I had to stop him because what the actual fuck?
Yes, Cas needs all the hugs in this chapter. It was one of my favorite chapters to write. Cas is so vulnerable here and I wanted to make it realistic.
We ended up getting in a big fight about how we were dealing with Mom’s death. I accused him of not caring and he accused me of losing myself. Which, he was right about.
I got a text from Bela last week while I was at work saying that she had landed herself in the hospital again. This time it was due to anemia caused by her anorexia. She had been experiencing shortness of breath when her parents brought her in.
The second day we were here, I got a bleeder after I changed my CGM. Pretty rare for me. The insertion went perfectly. Didn't have any creases either and everything was fine until Cas noticed blood on the back of my sleeve and around the sensor. I wiped off the blood, but the damage was already done to my shirt. Had to change it which kinda sucked.
I moved into Sam’s room. I told him if he needed to take care of business, then he better do it somewhere else.
Charlie and Benny both said that when they got the flu it drained them. I expected a few days but it took a week for me to start feeling better and another week after that to feel like myself again.
Bobby, Ellen, and Jo came for graduation too. Even my grandparents Samuel and Deana stopped by. They never came around much so it was a surprise. Samuel gave me 100 dollars so I can't complain.
The first day back to school was an adjustment. It’s like I left school on Friday, and came back a whole new person. I felt like all these people were looking at me and knew that I was different. I asked Dad if I could skip, but he flat out said no. I think he was starting to get stir crazy from being out of work for that long.
Cas said I did it a lot and ended up being mad at me the whole night. I told him that I would try my best to not flirt anymore… even though I didn't know I was flirting in the first place.
And there have been times where I have lied in the past about my eating disorder, but tonight wasn't one of those times.
A single bullet between their eyes. Apparently it looked like veins were coming out of the bullet hole. Their skin was also grey. The police said they had never seen bullets do so much damage like the ones they pulled out of their skulls.
One tradition of my dad and I was to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. He’d always eat the crusts off my sandwich, and we’d play trivia or Sorry! together.
I’m sitting here clutching this little green velvet box that feels so right in my hand. Without a doubt, I can say that you're it for me, Dean. I feel wanted when I’m with you. I feel it so deep in my bones that it hurts sometimes because I don’t think I will ever love someone more than I love you.
Benny likes Culver’s so much that the staff knows his usual order by heart. Hell, even I could recite it in my dreams. It’s a double mushroom and swiss butter burger with the bun extra toasted, mushrooms on the side, fries, and a Pepsi with light ice.
Since I had started this… thing, I had noticed some very bad side effects. My skin was always clammy and pale after I would vomit. I would sometimes feel light-headed right after as well. I had also started to notice that some days, my energy would be completely depleted and on those days, it was hard getting out of bed. Sometimes I would also have sharp stomach pains too, but they’d go away fairly quickly so I didn’t think they were too severe.
I’ve been eating like crazy. Weirdly, a lot of oranges. Sam’s kind of pissed because he likes them and usually my dad and I don't touch them. Lately though, I can’t get enough of them. I don't know if this is related but I’m also always thirsty too and I’ve been peeing a whole bunch. I told Sam about the symptoms and he told me, “Well, don’t drink so much water, stupid.”
He told me later that he got tungsten specifically because it reminded him of my stubbornness. When he’s just as stubborn...
Jo kept blasting the song Watermelon Sugar on the way there. I think it’s by Harry Styles or something. I regret that right now, she’s the only passenger that gets to pick the music. Long story short, I dropped her phone, and now the screen is darker on one side and we can't fix it.
When my aunt brought up that she wanted me to come live with her, in Kansas, I was hesitant at first. I had been in Illinois since I was 5. Everything was here. My dad, Anna, and my Mom. So, Tessa let me finish off my 10th-grade year and the summer following.
Sam, Charlie, Cas, Kevin, and I are actually in New Orleans. Have been for the last five days. Benny invited us a couple weeks ago and nobody had anything better to do, so we all crammed into the Impala and drove there. We’re at Benny’s brother’s house and it’s about 9 o'clock here.
As the night went by we sort of forgot about the cat incident, especially on the Ferris wheel, when we were really close. I ended up having itchy skin and eyes for the rest of the night on the boardwalk.
I shot up so quickly I got dizzy. Then I mirrored his grin and I told him I loved him too. Then we kissed until his stomach growled again and we went inside and ate grilled cheese together.
Once when I tried to hold his hand one really hot day at the park, he pulled his hand back like he had touched acid.
Both Cas and Kaia came home the next day. They were both pretty uncomfortable for the first few days after so I had to do a ton of stuff.
He tossed the pillow back on the bed.“Just adding the finishing touches.” He smudged in an area above Cas’ eye with his finger. “It shouldn't be much longer. I couldn't sleep, so I decided to finish what I’d started.”
At lunch, he was kind of quiet, but Benny was able to get him to say he lived with his aunt Tessa, and she owned a diner which he helped with.
You just ran out to get some take out. I told you to surprise me, but I know you’re going to get that one diner you’ve been eyeing for the last couple of days.
When our teacher came back, she was pissed. Like the kind of pissed we hadn't seen before. She was silent the first 10 minutes of class so we were quiet too. She gave this whole speech about how we were the worst class she had had in the 20 something years of her teaching and blah blah blah. I mean it’s not like we didn’t finish the busy work she gave us... Well I finished it at least. Dad says I have to keep my grades up. I didn't ask “or what” Because I don't think I want to know the “or else” part. Well she gave us this 5 page worksheet. And that doesn't sound bad, but every page had a back and a front.
Anyway, Sam and I ended up meeting up with Bela at this breakfast place between our two towns at around 10 this morning.
Cas got this job as a guide for this museum of Art. It was perfect because he got to talk about art and history, which were his two favorite subjects.
Anyway… I’m not really sure how to start this, but my name is obviously Dean Winchester. I am an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach and I’ve never killed anyone.
I was pretty close to saying fuck it, scraping the whole idea, and leaving. Then Cas had to wake up. Looked a little freaked out when he saw me, which I would be too if some creep were staring at me while I slept.
We were laying in my bed and just talked after that. About prom, graduation, jobs. And I just wanted to tell him that I loved him, but then didn’t. I guess the last time I was about to tell a person I loved them, they broke up with me. Cas doesn't know about my past, but he knows I have type 1, and he hasn't backed out yet. And it’s been almost two years since I did anything eating disorder related. Well, there was that scale thing… but I don't consider that a relapse.
It took him a little while of silence before he actually started talking about his mom. His voice got really quiet and he didn't look at me the whole time. He also did something I hadn't seen in a while, he like turned in on himself. It’s hard to explain.
I can't believe I started these letters 11 years ago when I was 16 all because of a school assignment from Mr. Ketch. I found out that he quit teaching a few years ago to publish his book called The Men of Letters. Not gonna lie, the book sounds kind of badass.
He took the opportunity to pad his fingers over Cas chest and watched him squirm. He decides he wants to keep making Cas squirm. His fingers tickled over his ribs admiring the soft skin and Cas lets out a soft laugh like Dean knew he would. He had known and loved this body since they were 17. Dean smiled before his hands ghosted over his lover’s strong thighs, kneading them firmly. He took Cas’ moans as a good thing.
This thing that fell into my lap... is insane and it’s going to take some getting used to, but I'm going to make diabetes my bitch.
Sorry I didn't update last week I got Covid while at work... It's a mild case. I think I'm done with it, I just sometimes get tired now. BUT I'M OKAY. Anyway! Enjoy this chapter!
Not sure what car Sam's going to drive in a couple years since my dad only has his truck and now I have the Impala. He sure as hell isn't driving Baby.
On Christmas break. I gotta say, it’s been nice not having a hole in between mine and Sam’s room. We’re going tomorrow to get paint and then it’ll finally be all done.
That summer was when I met Richard Roman. Dick for short. Which was kind of fitting now that I think about it…
I mean the guy hates black licorice and he didn't even laugh when I lip-synched the whole “Eye of the Tiger” to him, but those are small flaws I am willing to overlook.
She said that Sam had gotten sick at school and she had to pick him up early and asked me if I was okay. I was so ashamed that I lied to her face and told her that I thought I had the flu just like Sam. She felt my forehead and told me to go lie down.
Cas’ knuckles were pretty bruised up. I bandaged his hand up when traded places with Tessa, he didn’t even show any signs that he was in pain.
Right now, the whole house is passed out, and I should be asleep too but I had to wrap some presents before tomorrow morning. I never really got the idea of wrapping gifts. People would be just as surprised if you handed them the gift unwrapped. Sam says it’s the principle of it all, but he can shove those principles up his ass. That’s why when I ran out of gift wrap, I wrapped his gifts in toilet paper. I figured since he was a college student, he’d love that shit. Dad’s gonna be so pissed. Hopefully, with everyone opening gifts and all, he won’t notice much.
When I think about having Sam and Dean as my kids, my blood sugar starts to rise and my head starts to hurt. The other day, Sam and I fought over the last of a box of cereal. It doesn’t matter that I’m 21 and am going to be a senior in college this fall or he’s 17 and entering college, we still fight like when we were kids. My parents put up with a lot of shit over the years.
The hardest one to find was the store with the letter Q in it. We just took a picture next to Quiznos. That's a store, right?
Since we came to Bobby’s, I noticed that something’s been bothering Cas, so last night I took him out to dinner. This time it was this little Italian place that he found. We got the food to go and ate outside. While we were eating, Cas let me in on what had been bothering him.
Your mom liked pie more than I did. The bakery was out of her favorite pie, so your Mom decided to make an apple pie by herself. When it came out, I’ll admit it looked… special.
She ended up saying that she couldn't handle the fact that I have an eating disorder on top of diabetes. I wanted to correct her and to emphasize that I had had (past tense) an eating disorder, but there was something about the way she said handle that had caught me off guard and had made me kind of angry.
I got an apology from dad, by the way. I could tell the whole time he was checking my face for any signs of puking. Things like puffy eyes and face or any popped blood vessels in the eyes. I’m not sure he knows that I know what he’s doing. He’s been doing it since my eating disorder diagnosis.
Cas let out a sigh as he got out of bed and made the short distance to where Dean was. He wrapped his arms around Dean from behind and put his chin in the crook of his neck. “This is- just wow. I love it, it’s beautiful, Dean. I really think this could be your best work yet.”
Since my last letter, I finished my Junior year. I got some decent grades. Almost ended up failing my chemistry unit test, but I came out on top.
Michael ended up inviting a lot more people than we were expecting. Some Benny and I recognized from our school, others we didn't. I saw this as an opportunity to play some pool. Got 60 bucks that night.
Mom didn’t usually keep too sugary or too salty foods in the house for Sammy and me, but that didn’t mean she had broken Dad out of his food habits. Oreos, Famous Amos, Chips Ahoy… well, really any kind of cookies, but Oreos were his favorite.
After that, we ended up sharing a pretzel. Cas had actually gotten a hotdog but he didn't like it too much so I gave him some of my soft pretzel. Which, that ended up fucking with my pre-bolus estimations and I had to get a second pretzel to make up for it.
Most people in college don’t say anything if they see my pod, but a few of them have asked about it. I usually just tell them that I have type 1, but sometimes I like to have some fun. One day while I was walking to class, this girl warned me that I had something weird on the back of my arm. I played the hell out of it and pretended to be shocked and started to freak out about it. She got a little panicky when I mentioned that she should call 911.
When she came home on Thursday, there was something different about her, though I couldn’t place why.
I think we learned that not everyone grieved the same way. Just because Sam seemed unaffected to me, didn't mean he wasn't.
Sam told me I should write a letter to you. Said something about you opening this up when you’re older.
I guess one of the things I miss about her the most was when she’d sing “Hey Jude” to me and Sammy at night and around the house. I also miss the rice and tomato soup she cooked for me when I was sick (Sammy was never a huge fan of it). She couldn’t cook a ton of things so it was from the can, but it always tasted better than usual. Dad doesn’t make it as good as she does, but at least he tries.
That idea took me a while to start believing and I still struggle with not feeling like a failure sometimes. A lot of days since then have been me starting my day off by telling myself that “I can’t do this”, and it would end with me telling myself that “I can do this”.
On to Sam. The little brother graduated from Law school which means a free lawyer for me if I have a run-in with the law. HE STILL has to go through graduate school.
He wasn't lying when he said they were his favorite because he’s had one at least twice a week since joining us for lunch.
Cas took off his windbreaker to reveal that he was wearing the Assbutt shirt that I had gotten him. Couldn’t resist taking a picture. He had never worn it in public before so it made it that much better.
My first thought when I brought it inside was that it was justified because I had bought the scale with my own money and that now that I was 17, I could make my own decisions. And then I told myself that I would return it, but I never did. I instead decided to see if it worked by putting some batteries in it. When it turned on, it was then an excuse to try it out.
And I know I’m not one to talk with everything that swirls around in my head, but I see how Cas shuts down around his birthday or the mention of his parents and maybe this might be good for him.
The other day I almost called her to tell her some stupid thing that happened at the wrestling meet, but then I remembered that we weren’t together anymore. Guess I should have remembered how hard it was to quit something cold turkey like that. Especially when it was a big part of your life like that.
We were kind of surprised that she was still going to travel but then we gave her our numbers but we didn't see her until she was 7 months pregnant.
I’m sitting here writing with sore fingers, but it's not from what you think and I’ll get to that later.
Yeah… Lydia and I dated for about a month once. She’s hot, but she’s a little crazy. She was always talking about her future kids even though we were still in high school. This is why even if I wasn’t with Cas, I still wouldn't take her up on her offer.
Today, I can finally say that after 11 years, I don’t have that struggle anymore. I feel complete. Sometimes, I wish I could tell all the versions of me that it was going to be okay.
After the shower, everything that I had been feeling that day, all the anger, the pain, was just gone and I felt empty.
When Nick walked in and said that, I lost it. I don't remember all I did or feeling any pain in my hand after.
We ended up going to this escape room. We picked the evil doctor one. Basically this doctor’s intention is to cut you up into little pieces so he can use you as parts for himself if you don't get out in time. We ended up winning with two minutes left on the clock. Thanks to Benny’s quick thinking that the patient’s number was the code to open the key.
