, why is your violin case open?" John asked, keeping down the screech of pain he wanted to let out as he jammed his toes against the leather case and nearly fell face-first onto the coffee table.
John wasn't sure when the laughing had turned into hiccupped sobs, but they had. Something in his chest had loosened, brought upon by the feel of the silk beneath him and the distinct scent of Sherlock and the way Sherlock had turned him about so he could rest better.
"Perhaps you're right," John said, voice sounding far off as he realized that his care for Sherlock must extend far deeper than even
John's grin matched Sherlock's growing one as he tumbled back into bed, laughing when he got pinned to the mattress by Sherlock and his eager mouth.
"It's easier for you to patch up my hands than my face, and less chance of me being hospitalized," Sherlock said, providing a sensible answer that only made John more embarrassed (he should've watched what he
John hummed, looping his arms around his shoulders and soaking up all of the affection, content in a simple way.
John really didn't. Sherlock's hair tickled the side of his face in this position, keeping his scent close, and he was just about half passed out.
Sherlock's harsher or more tactless moments was something John was also used to dealing with now. He'd learned all he could do was smooth things over as best he could with the injured party before scampering off after Sherlock because there was usually no
John drained his cup of shitty police workroom coffee, crumpled it up, and lobbed it to the wastebasket across the conference room by the boards they'd set up.
The more he thought about, the more he realized that yes, Sherlock probably had. It was most likely the reason why the man had taken him on as his flatmate to begin with, and why he'd been pulled into crime-solving with nary a second thought. Sherlock had known normal was boring for John too and had given John a bit of purpose and thrill through crime-solving.
But the fire he'd swallowed had cleared his throat and heightened the ache in his chest, filling his (belatedly realized; he'd only had breakfast and skipped lunch because he was so busy) just about empty stomach with a warmth that emboldened him.
and so he tugged the sheets off of his legs with a swoop that seemed too loud in his quiet room. He could just make out the outline of his bare legs through the orange-yellow light of the streetlamps filtering through his curtains, and a second later the chill crept up his skin and made him shiver. This would keep John awake for now as he muddled his way through the puzzle before him.
"You don't sound like her," Sherlock remarked without looking up from his microscope. He was surrounded by open containers, and his laptop was perched precariously atop a stack of books to his left. He was dressed in the purple shirt John knew he favored, with the sleeves rolled up to reveal long, pale forearms.
What he didn't consider was the fact that their hands were still linked, and that he was much stronger than a caught off guard Sherlock. John shifted automatically, twisting so he half-landed on his back with Sherlock partly on top of him, chests colliding and forcing out twin whumps of air as their legs entangled.
. Granted, it was for different reasons (Sherlock was the god and he the mortal after all), but the shared sentiment (Sherlock would
"Slow down Sherlock," John laughed, his voice not as raspy as it once had been. He felt notably better; not
"At times. But not in the way people think it does," he responded, noting that Sherlock's finger wasn't cold at all. It seemed, just like John thought, the man only
It was then that John tossed aside the lens of objectivity and took the care of Sherlock Holmes into his own hands.
As such, when John woke entangled in the finest sheets he'd ever had the pleasure to sleep in to the smell of something burning in the kitchen, he moved. Didn't even think twice about it; acting was better in some situations than pausing to think.
A tad sulky, but John heard him set down the knick-knack he'd been toying with in favor of clearing a little more space for their breakfast, even though John was satisfied with the amount he'd cleared already.
For some reason, these words stood out to John Watson as he laid awake in his new flat, the ambient sounds of London fading as the words swirled around in his mind like water. He hadn't had the time to think upon them before, but now that all was quiet and
John sniffed, pressing his head into the hand just enough that he felt silly for chasing the comfort. The hand stayed though, connecting with Sherlock's voice as the intense emotion subsided in his chest.
of all things," John hissed, hand tightening in Sherlock's hair as he began to drag his mouth down his throat, replacing the hand he'd deftly moved down to his collar.
A few more hastily covered up laughs. Sally's mouth twitched, and John forged on before she could say anything else.
"I am renowned for my genius, but my erratic nature would've long been the death of me if it weren't for you."
There were so many things John could say in reply. How could he explain the thrill and exhilaration Sherlock constantly made him feel, the sheer joy of running free through the streets with his blood zinging and lungs screaming in the name of crime-fighting? He couldn't ever put into terms how grateful he was that Sherlock hadn't seen another hollow soldier only partly home from the war, the rest of him filled in with PTSD. Sherlock had seen the opposite in him; a soldier removed from the fight and missing the ability to do his part. There was no way he could explain how much Sherlock fascinated him, aggravated him, moved him to see the world in a dizzying array of lenses he hadn't thought possible.
"I'm fine. It's you I'm concerned about," he admitted uncharacteristically, his other hand moving to ghost across his face.
Judging by the faint crinkling of Sherlock's brow, the necessities John had gone through so much trouble to get didn't rank very high on
At that moment, wearing Sherlock's coat, John could feel his heart crack just the slightest. Sherlock would
to sustain him, contrary to what Sherlock came up with as "justifiable reasoning" and he'd be damned if he let that sort of diet slide.
Sherlock blinked before tipping his head back and barking out a laugh that John could feel from where his hands held his side and through the pale hand that still clasped his face.
Sherlock's arm was a welcome weight across his chest that he followed with his eyes up to his torso, where a book rested. John couldn't help but smile when he pictured the scenario: a restless Sherlock, unwilling to leave him, had picked up a book to read and fallen asleep in the process.
When it did hit him, he felt like a complete idiot, standing on a street corner a few blocks from 221B Baker Street with his broken umbrella dangling in his hand and a probably slack-jawed expression on his face.
It wasn't the screechy, shrill playing John knew Sherlock did on purpose to express frustration, or to simply be annoying. This wasn't Sherlock swinging his bow back and forth like a child with a wooden sword, horsehair swishing through the air like a whip. This was soft and sad and almost... morbid, but that could have just been John's thought process of monsters and ice coloring his perception.
"I don't know if I'd rather the medics fuss over me or have you continue to do so," Sherlock mused as John sat down in front of him hard enough to jar his tailbone. "On one hand, they won't call me a bastard unless I kick up a big fuss, but on the other, none of them will be shirtless like you."
"How will I be able to use utensils like this?" he mused, eyebrows furrowing momentarily as he tried, and partially succeeded, in picking up a pair of tweezers.
It was just like Sherlock somehow, to show a bit of restraint and then test a limit John hadn't even spoken with him about yet by playing tonight very softly. He didn't think he'd seen him do it with others, but John had noticed that at times, some of his words seemed to get through to the man. It was a contradiction to his seemingly heartless character, but only if one assumed that Sherlock was a cruel monster and incapable of human notions.
John thought, dazed by the relaxed mouth and fluffy curls. He was softened forcefully by exhaustion, but John couldn't bring himself to care for the reasons why as his hand moved of its own accord.
that the man relished in. John couldn't be blamed; Sherlock left people blindsided at best and nursing vicious wounds made by his words at worst. He had the uncanny ability to draw strong emotions out of people, all as he kept such a tight restraint on his own.
"Get over here," Sherlock said after taking a moment to take him in, ascertaining for himself that John was well.
"Hmm," Sherlock hummed, ignoring his sarcasm. A strange expression crossed his face as if he was close to a deduction but was missing something important, "It's just that you look extremely disoriented."
"This task you've taken on hurts you John, but you keep caring for me. Why? I don't deserve it. I don't deserve any of it."
at me like that. Just because you're the physician doesn't mean you always know what's good for you."
Tonight was one of those instances of verbal battles edging towards the line of too far. It was late;
"I'm fine," he managed to mumble as he heard Sherlock fly out of bed and fumble for the light. "Sherlock-"
bone-just like the rest of them? They made his job so much harder, and more than once John had to refrain himself from snapping at someone when they said something tactless along those lines.
John shut them without another word. Trust was something he'd developed a long time ago with Sherlock, and this request was downright mild compared to some of the wackier ones he'd been asked.
"It's not so bad. You shouldn't take out your anger on the poor thing," John murmured, stroking the wool. It smelled like Sherlock and was less itchy than it looked.
He drew out the word "really", his voice faint and quiet with fatigue. John didn't think he'd felt this slow sort of tired since the day he'd returned to London, when he'd been so out of it that he'd fallen asleep on the floor of his shitty flat before he could even make it to his equally shitty bed. There was tired, and then there was
that one day Sherlock would go too far and get himself hurt, or worse, killed. The man was reckless to a fault; a wildfire that John could barely keep contained on the best of days.
"Now you're just getting ahead of yourself," he muttered to himself, turning his face into the pillow so the coolness would will the heat from his face.
Sherlock gazed at him for a long moment, and John wondered if he could see what lay dangerously close beneath the calm surface he projected. Sherlock was adept at peeling away his layers, and perhaps-
He continued to mutter as he spotted a pair of socks and threw them at Sherlock, nailing him firmly across one haughty cheekbone and drawing an indignant sound.
"I know. But really, I'm fine. It wasn't too far to fall, and I didn't hit my head. I must've just rolled over in my sleep."
But wasn't that what this was? John's thoughts were like silt through a sieve as he languished on the couch and simply existed, but even while sick he knew that Sherlock being here was more than kindness and that Sherlock knew too. This was love; care reciprocated on a level that John hadn't known he'd needed until now.
There was a keen loss in John's chest as he heard Sherlock retreat, but strangely, a frail bit of hope too. The words had been well-meant, and it didn't seem as if Sherlock was running, or completely oblivious to the feelings he held towards him. He'd been blind to advances made towards him before by random people out in public, but not completely so. Every now and then he picked up on it, and at this point, John believed all the tenderness he held in his heart was beginning to blast out in an undeniable signal.
"Since when do you know how to do that?" he asked, watching as John dragged the violin case (open, just about always open and left on the floor nowadays) over so he could put the bow inside.
," he said, drawing out the, quite frankly, ridiculous term. Mycroft was a powerful man with more connections than Sherlock had superpowered neurons, but they were brothers at the end of the day, and it showed at times like this.
Sherlock grumbled but turned them around so John was on his back before kissing him with an intensity that he happily returned.
A pale face came into his view, brow creased and tossing dark shadows over eye sockets. His vision was all wonky, but John would know Sherlock's face anywhere, anytime.
"I'll take that into consideration," Sherlock said, eyes flashing peculiarly before he launched into more mundane conversation.
"Very eloquent. You definitely need another day of rest," Sherlock said, already analyzing him in a way that John knew meant he was calculating just how much herbal tea and paracetamol he'd need.
"I know, you foolish man," Sherlock said, his words close to being murmured into his throat. His face was so
Eyes then turned to look his way, but John expected that. There was a reason he'd thrown it that way instead of dumping it into the wastebasket by his side.
to lessen the bony figure. No wonder he always wore that coat of his. It gave him the shield of illusion, filling in what flesh should've. "Shoes with no
John was not a fan of the developing situation. He was currently on hour 29 of no sleep and he'd developed an annoying headache no amount of caffeine could rectify; the sludge they served up at the station certainly wasn't helping. He was exhausted, in desperate need of a shower, and
A crack of lightning briefly illuminated Sherlock's upturned face, and John was shocked to see no reproach or annoyance in his gaze.
The fire was smaller than when he'd left, sputtering weakly. That didn't surprise him, as judging by the sounds coming from the kitchen, Sherlock had little time for pesky domestic things like tending to the fire. Not only that, but one of the windows was open, letting in a healthy amount of wind and rain.
little. But you make yourself appear smaller than you are," Sherlock mused, blinking long and slow as if trying to snatch a bit of sleep before he refocused on him. "In reality, you might be just as calculating as me. It's in a different way, one driven by some unknown force instead of the scientific pursuits I chase, but nonetheless remarkable."

"Well, it was still very dull. A sleeping John is a not-talking John, and to top it all off, you kept wanting to roll off of wherever I put you. The bed, the
Sherlock scrabbled at the mattress; eyes still shut. His brow crinkled as he realized John wasn't there before they flew open, the book toppling into his lap with a small thud as he sat up.
Sherlock's blood covering his palms. Some of it was his too, trickling from his bruised and battered knuckles.
and John knew he fell into the latter category that could only get him burned. Sherlock was married to his work after all, and it was a hopeless endeavor.
"Sleep matters little to me. I'm not tired at all," Sherlock proclaimed, and he indeed looked quite energetic considering the time of night.
Hands, shaking him awake. John didn't have the energy to bat them away or to formulate the words to say he wanted to go back to sleep, so he cracked his eyes open and squinted up.
They weren't as prominent as they were that dreadful morning. Sherlock wasn't a wraith anymore; his bones were reduced to nothing but the vague impressions they were supposed to be in the places that John had been most concerned for.
"You'll always take care of me, won't you?" he asked, words a whisper against his ear, throat jumping as he swallowed.
John's face softened. Sherlock had been remarkable steadfast throughout his illness, never voicing any complaints, but he could see the signs of sleeplessness and strain under his eyes.
There was a pause of indeterminable length. It couldn't have been long, as John was still awake when Sherlock spoke.
John didn't mind. He was just happy that Sherlock was trying and hadn't given up on something he could've so easily dismissed as useless human emotions.
Either way, he only moaned when John threaded their fingers together and pinned Sherlock's hands above his shoulders, and when they pulled apart in tandem to gasp for breath, it appeared he understood.
Like a snake shedding his skin. Or, like a man shedding a façade. John didn't dwell on it, as he much preferred the dust to the sands that had drifted through.
when he'd handed him back the cane he no longer needed and said he'd missed it all. The man had spoken like it was the truth, confident in the words he'd spoken like he was confident in everything else he said, and the gleam in his icy eyes had caught John off guard. He knew now that Sherlock was right (was usually
to being pressed into the crook of his neck, but not quite. "But you don't have to fret about this. This isn't me rejecting you, John."
It seemed inconceivable to catch some illness during the summer, but as a physician, John knew it was possible. Germs didn't care for the seasons, even if they preferred certain ones over others for spreading.
. Yes, he tried to curb the man's more capricious habits and particularly sharp retorts, but at the end of the day, John felt he could get used to the skull on the mantle Sherlock fancied chatting with at times and the way the man folded himself into chairs on his haunches like a child.
Sherlock hadn't meant it in the way his now tired and sluggish brain had seized onto it, but he couldn't bring himself to break the paper-thin illusion that he
Only then did John realize that something warm coated his cheek and trickled down the side of his neck to stain his collar. An accompanying razor sting high on the side of his cheekbone confirmed the presence of a cut, but it registered as a mere nuisance of pain compared to the fierce ache in his hands.
"It smells foul in here. Like a coffee graveyard," Sherlock said after he'd been bandaged up, nose wrinkling after he sniffed the air delicately.
"Did you drink on purpose to get me like this?" John asked, letting his hands roam, not frantically, but thoroughly, not wanting to miss a single bit of Sherlock's form beneath his fingers. Firm, but fragile all at once, this person he'd poured so much care and heart into to keep intact when the world battered him.
he was different, in a class separate from all others, and the man reveled in his genius and ability to be quick and sharp and cold and come off as- as a
The usual place, a hole in the wall diner with atrocious retro tile walls and fabulous cardiac arrest inducing waffles, was about the furthest one could get from the police station. It also wasn't
"...my partner is a doctor for Christ's sake! Best one in the city, so don't worry about me doing anything stupid with the bandage…"
"I care about you quite a bit too," John said, rubbing his thumbs over the high flush that stained Sherlock's cheeks, "But you already know that. Which means that it's up to me to give the bacon another chance."
John intercepted his hand before he could get there, feeling the tense energy sear straight through his palm and dance up his arm as he twisted, pushing Sherlock's arm up away from the skillet and taking a subsequent step towards him.
John trailed off once he spotted the smirk on Sherlock's face that blossomed into a rare, outright grin; the kind that crinkled the edges of his eyes and brought some warmth to his face.
"Yes," he drawled, catching her off guard (what answer had she been expecting?) as well as a few others with his flat, no-nonsense tone, "If I have to get another shitty cup of coffee to stay awake in this stuffy room because I have to be stuck
"At least settle yourself in before you pass out," Sherlock chastised as outside, lightning cracked. The sound was muted though and didn't worry John. "
He made an incomprehensible sound, shutting his eyes and pressing his face against Sherlock's shoulder blade in an attempt to ignore the pounding of his head. Sherlock's breathing was slow and even with deep sleep; much more even than the nasal wheeze he was currently emanating.
"My endurance is quite decent, thank you very much. You're just too embarrassed to admit you were slowed when your scarf blew up in your face."
! I can control absolutely everything about myself, even my addiction to a degree, except when it comes to you, John Watson," he said, eyes cutting to him in a gaze filled with both passion and petulance. "It is
They were sitting in the station, tucked away in the breakroom to keep Sherlock from spewing vitriol at the meaner officers that would no doubt poke fun at his moment of physical weakness. The pervasive smell of coffee and tea was expected considering the place, but still surprisingly strong considering no one had a pot brewing. Lestrade had supplied a first aid kit, which supplemented the supplies John made a point to carry (his bag contained more than his laptop, a fact that seemed to shock people about as much as people forgot he was a doctor) enough that Sherlock didn't need a hospital.
"Right here," John replied, bouncing on the balls of his feet. His stomach was hollow with hunger and his head still a bit stuffed up, but for the first time in a few days, he was upright on his own.
At least John was sure that he could rely on Sherlock to have a tidy enough appearance when he had to go out. Sure, his hair would always be messy, and his coat always left open to flap in the wind no matter how cold, but he managed to look presentable. Sherlock even
The hand smoothed his hair down once before moving to the side of his face, a thumb swiping away the tears following gravity's eternal pull down the bridge of his nose.

John swallowed once, then twice when the first didn't suffice in moving the bird that had once been in his stomach and was now lodged in his throat (and when had it ever gotten past his chest?).
for the first time since he'd arrived back in London, like someone human instead of the automaton he'd slipped into being. When they'd chased that cab, John had just taken off after him into the night, uncaring of the fact that he had no idea where Sherlock was leading him, or that leaping buildings was generally unsafe, and that it was monumentally stupid to
For a moment, all John could do was gaze into the impenetrable darkness of the room with a useless deer in the headlights gaze(had he really fallen?) before a hot flush of mortification flooded him; so hot that he could feel his face burn with it.
His thought slipped out of his grasp, slippery and unraveling faster than a spool of thread. Sleep hovered on the edge of his mind, eager to descend and swallow him whole.
(It had nothing to do with making sure he was alright, or with wanting to go back to 221B to share the cozy space if not by his side, then in the same vicinity. Not at
"You're always mindful of those," Sherlock said, sitting cross-legged before reaching to clasp his hands. "Close your eyes for me?"
John debated turning off the light before deciding to leave it. Sherlock would wake when he got out of bed, as he always did, and he wouldn't want to go back to sleep when he figured out that he was back on the mend.
He looked up in time to see a pensive look on Sherlock's face slowly morph into a giant smirk that, for some strange reason, brought color to John's cheeks.
was the one to press Sherlock up against the wall and pin him there, simply breathing for a moment and taking in Sherlock's form in the dark.
He conveniently forgot to do anything about the open window. Any damage to the flat was conveniently repaired on the dime of Mycroft despite Sherlock's adamant refusals of his brother "meddling in his affairs", and Mrs. Hudson chose her battles wisely with Sherlock. Experiments got them a tongue lashing, but the window would only earn a mild admonishment.
"Dammit," he mumbled more audibly through a dry mouth, trying to focus more on Sherlock's warmth instead of the aches that tormented him, but to no avail. He couldn't ignore the fact that he'd woken in a shivering cold sweat in the wee hours of the morning.
"Sorry," he said automatically, letting himself be sat up with the loose-limbed ease of a sleep heavy mind.
He found Sherlock hissing and cursing at a skillet that must've just caught flame, as the smoke alarm hadn't gone off yet. John took a second to assess the contents (bacon; grease fire) before reaching into the cabinet and pulling out the salt they had.
Sleep came easily with Sherlock there, but right on the edge of it, John caught his voice. Same tone, same softness, but he could swear he heard different words that he seized with a tight grip to remember later when he woke up.
"Perhaps," John said, unsure of what else to say and settling on the vague word to buy his sleepy mind a bit of time. "Care to join me?"
"Interested in keeping your pretty boy features intact?" John asked absentmindedly as he turned Sherlock's hands this way and that. None of the cuts were deep enough to require stitches; some had even already stopped bleeding, which was good. He had the materials necessary except for a sufficient amount of pain medicine, and he didn't want to subject Sherlock to all of that.
John growled at his blasé reply and straightened up with a retort ready on his tongue that died as soon as he caught sight of Sherlock.
The soldier instincts he'd sharpened in Afghanistan had not gone completely to waste when he returned to home soil. He'd just found a different application for them in the work that he did with Sherlock, but also in the man himself. Sherlock, for all his cleverness and grace, had trouble with the most innocuous things. Remembering that something was on the stove, for example, whilst he got caught up in some discovery, was a common occurrence.
He took the opportunity that putting away the milk gave him to grin like a fool into the fridge. John Watson, a storm? Why, the comparison would've been more apt for Sherlock, the force of nature that he was. In fact, it's probably when he liked them so much.
"I highly doubt that," Sherlock replied stiffly, fingers combing through his scalp, "Are you dizzy? I don't see where you could've hit your head, but perhaps you hit something else. I'll have to pull out the heating pad then. Where are you sore? Are you-"
want to touch it) as he stood with his arms crossed, one foot tapping as rainwater dripped off him to pool on the floor.
"I meant it to be," Sherlock said distractedly, attention already sucked back in by whatever he'd scraped onto a microscope slide tonight, "I like storms. It's why I opened the window."
He cut himself off with a hissed wince when the light came on, squeezing his sensitive eyes shut against the sudden change. The throb in his head worsened as sparks danced across the backs of his eyelids, and he heard Sherlock murmur an apology, his hands settling across his bare back as he knelt beside him.
a genius after all), but his tone was distracted as his brow furrowed, "John…what are you doing on the
But Sherlock did pull back, a bit of anger in his eyes that turned into something intense as his fingers lightly touched his jaw, so different from the passion he'd showed a moment earlier.
"It's more comfortable," Sherlock said stiffly. John could easily envision him standing at the foot of the bed with crossed arms and an arched brow easily. "Better for my skin too…John?"
could get done. In his opinion, it said a lot about the officers if they were the ones instigating things with Sherlock.
Eating was hard with Sherlock, but not impossible. John had a vast capacity for patience to go along with his various methods of feeding his capricious flatmate, and the wherewithal to not be discouraged when Sherlock wanted to be obstinate. As long as he was around, he was sure that Sherlock would be quite alright.
Sherlock remained quiet, but John could tell the man was studying him from the way his pale eyes flicked this way and that. It seemed he made up his mind about something though, as he outstretched a nimble finger to skim across one of the dark circles beneath John's eyes.
The smell of alcohol alerted John that something was wrong before he saw Sherlock slumped beneath one of the windows morosely playing his violin with a vodka bottle by his side.
"You've started bleeding again," Sherlock murmured, fingers brushing up against the gauze that had been hastily taped to the cut on his cheek. They came back stained red.
, and seemed to thrive off of making people, i.e. police, feel as stupid and inadequate as possible.
John's eyes drifted there as well, noting the space (just big enough for both of them to put plates) cleared away, and the tea set that he just knew Sherlock had made sure held the proper substances in the respective cream and sugar containers before he'd laid it out.
John hid his smile as Sherlock came up to stand behind him and drape himself over his shoulders. Typical Sherlock; holding off on breaching some boundaries to test them first and leaping over others with nary a second glance to what he was breaching. But the point was largely moot as between them, there were very few boundaries.
So mundane in fact that by the time John realized Sherlock was doing this for a purpose, he was fully back in his right head and in London, all heavy thoughts of Afghanistan banished. His legs ached from being pulled up for so long, but he wasn't sweating and shivering, and the sight of the now relit candle didn't throw him back to the desert.
The fingers John had been absently drumming against his thigh stilled. His thoughts were rapid now, no longer slow and silver tainted by the ghostly quality Sherlock's words had stuck around with. They were tumbling like chips of ice in glass now, shattering in their solidified forms.
The package deal, all or nothing sort of thinking he'd used to tie Sherlock and himself together slipped by unnoticed amid all his other thoughts.
, that seemed to tug people towards him before they invariably scuttled away as if burned by his harsh tongue and uncaring demeanor.
He trailed off, lips pinched tight at his fumbled words, but John already knew. He'd grown good at reading Sherlock and seeing past the cultured and capricious airs he hid parts of himself behind.
he shouldn't retaliate but did so anyway. Sherlock just couldn't help himself. It was both his greatest strength and strongest character flaw; the double-edged sword he wielded with a heavy hand and heart: his inability to let things lie.
The bottle was right there, and in an uncharacteristic motion that he knew he would regret in the morning, John picked it up and guzzled down the fire for liquid courage.
he was since many people told him so (usually before they realized how much of an utter berk he was), and besides, it wasn't something you said to your flatmate unless they asked you if they looked good in an outfit they'd been agonizing over. Just because John wasn't blind and could see that Sherlock was handsome didn't mean he had to voice it like everyone else and stroke his ego.
"I think you might be the first person to have seen me for what I am in the end. A man. Just a man," he said, fingers curling in the short hairs on the base of John's neck. Vulnerability hung in the air, as physical as the dried tear tracks on John's face.
John let him cling with the expectation that he'd continue speaking, but they instead lapsed into an odd silence. On the living room floor, with late afternoon sun gracing his face, Sherlock simply stared, mouth opening once before shutting with a soft click. His hand came up to touch his face, but aborted the movement, fingers clenching in a fist that he let fall between them.
"I'll fret if I want to," John rasped for the sake of being contrary, but his hands reached out to settle gently across the broad, but bony stretches of Sherlock's shoulders. Tentative, but eager when Sherlock didn't shrug them off.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock asked after a long minute in which John tried not to shiver or look too closely at Sherlock himself, lest he think about things he didn't want to think about at the moment.
"You should really get some sleep John. You make even less sense than you normally do when tired," he said, and this time, John could see the faint light of amusement in his eyes. It made them look less like ice and more open, like the windows to the soul people believed eyes could be.
"I know," Sherlock said, resting his face in his now free hands as John shut the case. "It's why I'm still alive."
However, instead of leaving the kitchen and letting John gathered what remained of his heart in the stoic silence he would try to muster as he'd expected, Sherlock inhaled deeply and stayed.
John couldn't say he loved Sherlock; not so soon and not like this, but for the first time, he left himself express a bit of that love through more than just making sure Sherlock had more than one meal and a cup of tea a day and shielding him from the meaner gossip that dogged him.
looked up from his microscope. There were dark circles beneath his eyes, which John already knew of (he hadn't slept the whole weekend; he was sure of that), and an odd green stain from something he'd probably been messing around with earlier stained his cheek.
managed to slip from John's mind through those first few heated minutes when he'd been scrambling to pull Sherlock free from the boxes.
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise before briskly shaking out his coat and doing the one thing John never expected him to do with it.
John knew that trying to find the purpose in Sherlock's actions was hopeless at times; the fickle man always grew annoyed when he had to explain himself. But he had to admit, he was curious as to whether Sherlock had taken him in out of curiosity, like some sort of science experiment, or out of something far more human.
"You never cease to amaze me, John," Sherlock said in a low tone of amusement (or was that embarrassment? He couldn't distinguish between anything anymore) before drawing his hand back.
saying it. Except when he said it, he'd be referencing his almost obsessive need for all the thrill and adrenaline he could gain from life as opposed to some agonizingly bland, cookie-cutter existence. Oh, he liked to try and pass off as normal, as one of the countless others with normal lives, but the longer he spent in the company of Sherlock Holmes, the more John came to realize he was lying quite fiercely to himself by trying.
mind much. There was something to the eccentricities and volatility of Sherlock Holmes that reminded John of his time serving in Afghanistan. It had been gritty and painful (getting shot was never a very pleasant experience), but John had also felt energized and
"Looks like we'll be out of here soon," John said, letting his hands move away from Sherlock's side for the first time. The blood flowed sluggishly now, but his hands still felt strangely empty with loss.
! Everything about you indicates that you appreciate romantic gestures," Sherlock snapped, flinging a wild arm out to encompass the set table and pathetically smoldering skillet, "I've never bothered with such romantic cues before, but even
Sherlock gave him the look that he reserved for those that had said something particular inept or remarkably tone-deaf. John absently noted that he looked nice with his robe open over his bare chest, even more so when a bit of it slipped off his shoulders as he leaned back from him.
John was familiar with the concept of adrenaline and had mastered prioritizing things in the way they had to be tackled most effectively when in the field. First Sherlock, then him, both because of logical reasoning and to satiate the intense emotional
would empathize with my bloody scarf," Sherlock said, but there was no heat in his words. If anything, his odd expression reflected in his tone of voice. "Come. Lestrade will no doubt wonder why we are meeting him at a bakery."
"Don't," he said quietly, suddenly getting the sense that the distance between them had closed in a way he hadn't anticipated when doing this, "It might still be hot."
John sat back against the couch and wondered why, despite the answers he now had, they didn't seem to be enough to satisfy the last question he had in his mind.
, what with the way he carried on. John had never seen such a complete lack of care for the fundamentals of survival, and it set off every alarm medical schooling had instilled in him when he came to the realization that Sherlock only did the bare minimum to keep his body going, and anything beyond that was for "regular people."
soft, "You're not in Afghanistan. You're here, with me, in 221B Baker Street. It smells like laundry detergent in here. You did the washing up earlier."
John couldn't help his snort at the firm, indignant response. The alcohol had deepened Sherlock's voice, if that was even possible, but also loosened his tongue in a way that brought more emotion to his tone than he dared show while sober. His inflections were harder and more liberal, and his voice rose and fell with the notes he'd now taken to plucking from his violin.
It soared above the table, drawing people's attention and halting the escalating argument between Sally and Sherlock. There was a bit of a spin on it that made it just graze the edge as it landed in the wastebasket with a quiet thump and the acknowledgment of a now much more awake and quiet room.
Drowsiness tugged him back under about halfway down the hall, but the good sort that promised a clearer head when he woke up. John only partially registered the cool sheets beneath his skin and the press of a pillow against his cheek. He noticed the loss of Sherlock's heat more, but not for long.
feel surprised when the tall man sat down gingerly beside him on the side of the couch closest to the window.
For some reason, the thought amused him so much that he began to chuckle, fingers still drifting through the soft silk he couldn't see.
"I am a bit peckish," Sherlock said slowly, testing the words out before tilting his head in a way that sent his dark curls tumbling into his eyes. "How do you feel about breakfast at our usual place?"
"You're no monster to me, Sherlock," he said finally, and when he said the man's name, he saw him twitch slightly, "You're just...you're just
A crumpled sheet on the sofa marked where Sherlock had probably sat for a bit before working, and John's laptop was sitting on the side table. To his annoyance, it was unlocked despite the fact that he'd changed his password. An empty mug by it had a chip in the rim that, while he couldn't be completely sure, John was convinced had also happened while he was gone.
It wouldn't surprise John if he was. He held his breath, the sudden tidal sweep of emotion long gone and replaced by a new, fitful anticipation that tumbled around in his chest. What was Sherlock considering?
Nobody said anything to them from the bullpen as they left; both chastised by what had occurred in the conference room and also too busy to bother addressing them. The vile and cruel words had dried up for the night thanks to John's intervention. John smiled in satisfaction, which only grew when Sherlock linked their arms together in the elevator.
Sherlock hardly ever paused. He was either moving or wasn't; either flitting about a corpse like a crow or completely stock still as his brain worked furiously. Something about a "mind palace" was involved in those still moments, which was something John didn't completely understand yet but figured made sense considering the sheer brilliance of the man's mind.
A memory of sitting on the couch talking with Sherlock came to John, and he nodded as he realized that he'd been asked this once before.
"Sherlock?" he asked warily, dropping the groceries he'd run out to get. He'd only been gone about an hour-much of that time spent in the produce section picking the fruits and vegetables that Sherlock wouldn't take immediate offense to-and Sherlock had been fine when he'd left. Had something happened while he was gone?
John tore his eyes away from the bottle and looked at Sherlock, who was still close and morose, blue eyes saddened and mouth pulled downward in a manner that tugged on that ache in John's chest he carried around these days. It was so hard to keep from being too tactile with Sherlock; to keep his touches from lingering and his fingers from reaching out to offer comfort that wouldn't be accepted.
Sherlock's reply of "Preposterous," was instant, clipped with a sudden irritation similar to that he developed when people were being particularly dense.
(Is that I love you so much that I can't keep it all inside, but I must if I want to preserve the friendship we have, this strange give and take and push and pull we live by. I hate seeing you hurt but I love putting you back together; I hate seeing you hurt by others but can't help but feel proud when I protect you just long enough for you to regain your balance. I hate and I love, and I
John huffed out a weak laugh as his feet brushed the wall when they turned the corner into the living room. Strong Sherlock may have become, but coordination when carrying someone was still something to be developed. Perhaps John would have to switch things up and let
, John Watson, managed to throw the great Sherlock Holmes for a loop. But then, he'd be caught off guard too if he saw his normal, average shmuck of a flatmate curled up on the couch like a child and probably looking like some shell-shocked soldier dredged up from the deepest depths of a sandy hell.
John flushed, crossing his arms over his bare chest. His fingers smeared blood on his arms, but that was minuscule in comparison to the intent look in Sherlock's luminous eyes.
John cringed at the thought of being laid so low by a mere candle, but the scent of sandalwood pulled him out of feeling shameful for too long as Sherlock perched beside him on the bed.
"It was the final puzzle piece," Sherlock explained, "I'd been fumbling with all the other pieces I had, unsure if the picture emerging from the jigsaw was right, or maybe too blind to it because it featured emotions and required using my heart. But that word…only people that care hold on to the trivial knowledge I spout, and when you said it reminded me of all the other times you listened to me, and then trusted me. So on and so forth, until the puzzle was complete."
"You're not fine. Don't lie to me," Sherlock said, gently getting him turned onto his side before shuffling so that he blocked the light, something that John could only discern by instinct and the way the vague concept of light and shadow he could make out with his closed eyes changed.
He didn't think Sherlock knew he'd heard him. Pet names were something that John bequeathed to Sherlock and he generally accepted with a neutral hum. They weren't something John got besides a mumbled "darling" during a round of sex or waking from a good sleep. He didn't mind; he knew that such casual affections were hard for Sherlock, and perhaps not in his repertoire at all.
The sands receded as Sherlock began to stride down the street. Time returned to what it was before, and John was left to follow him in his wake. He watched as marble dust blew in the wind, fine enough to blend in with the paper sky above them.
John wasn't a man of intricately linked words like Sherlock. But he knew how to speak up for Sherlock and make it count, and believed his quiet companionship counted more than keeping up with Sherlock's verbiage did.
He slipped out from beneath Sherlock's arm and stretched while facing him, waiting patiently for the tell-tale…
"No, you're not," John said, and his firmness was accentuated by the hand he extended to grip Sherlock's chin and keep him there. Now or never, and John knew it would be now.
to look decent, which John was grateful for. He drew the line at ironing Sherlock's fancy dress shirts; Lord knew he could barely iron the few he owned that needed it.
John leaned back and crossed his arms, nodding at Lestrade when he gave him an impressed look. Sherlock was back on track, motions fluid and dynamic as he spoke to the now largely attentive and compliant room.
The lie didn't last long when he thought of icy eyes and silk shirts and a single pale finger dragging down his cheek.
It was an odd thought, as John was perfectly capable of defending himself and everyone knew it. One did not become a doctor and promptly head off to the battlefield without having a backbone, but perhaps he'd let his appearance grow too soft. Too many cozy jumpers and perhaps one too many biscuits might've lulled people into complacency and underestimating him.
"But only with you. Interesting, that," Sherlock said, voice far off as if he was somewhere in his mind palace.
John snorted, the words tempering the comforting feeling of being huddled up into Sherlock's side. It was so typical of him to wrap an insult and compliment all in one.
Lestrade was part of the growing members of the catnapping group, no doubt giving Sally a false sense of security that she could do what she wanted. She snuck more and more jibes in at Sherlock, who stood at the board, detracting talk of the case further and further of the important points just to be petty for pettiness' sake.
"You cheeky bastard," John managed to say above the ringing in his ears. He couldn't tell if that was from a knock he'd take to the head whole fighting the perp, or if it was tied to the bird thrashing around inside him. "Don't
None of the people touched him, but they were gradually buffeting him backward, like a paper airplane carried away by air currents beyond its control. John began to fight against the drift, but it was useless.
He hadn't expected the thoughtfulness at all from him. John was fascinated and attracted and confused by Sherlock at times and was proud to say that he understood him much better than most did. This meant he'd never deluded himself into believing Sherlock was something he wasn't, save for the few times he'd entertained fantastical thoughts of there being something more between them.
The words were said as their lips met, closing the scant few centimeters between them and a much larger gulf in John's chest. It was said in the way Sherlock pressed his fingers against John's pulse point, seeking out the rapid thump beneath his almost feverish skin. It was said in the way John's fingers uncurled from the bottle's neck and moved to tangle through Sherlock's hair, so soft and smooth beneath his touch. It was said in the way John sighed and shuddered into the kiss, and Sherlock held him gently, but firmly, and didn't say a word when they parted for a gasp of air.
Sherlock's gaze grew confused, but he remained pliant as John brushed a few errant strands of hair out of his eyes before skimming down his face. His hand landed on his shoulder, fingers burning with the whisper of touch he'd stolen from Sherlock's cheek, palm absorbing the bony shoulder that radiated a sturdy heat.
"Maybe I'll let it scar just to spite you," John said before he could think of any other way to regain control over himself and his winged feelings trying to take flight.
of the information you do is that I persuaded Sherlock to adjourn a meeting like this instead of simply informing Lestrade. I know how peeved you lot get when Sherlock swoops in and out. The only reason this meeting even exists is because of me."
"I've never cared about anyone quite so much in my life," he intoned solemnly, and John smiled, uncaring of the fact that he probably looked as if his head was still in the clouds.
"Er-yes, no, and what are you texting him for? We lost him," John said, torn between sounding annoyed for bringing the chase to an end with his untimely tumble over a bridge, and confused by Sherlock's extended contact. At the worst, his ribs might bruise, and John had sustained far worse injuries.
Sherlock said nothing, and John looked up to see an odd expression on his face. At first glance, it could've been mistaken for a typical pensive Sherlock-esque look, but there was something different to it John couldn't place.
"Your vocabulary is still the same, but you've somehow only grown complimentary in your drunk state," he mused, loosening the bow hair in the manner he'd seen Sherlock do. A tense bow
"You are," John chuckled, shaking his head. He couldn't verbalize any of what he felt for Sherlock; the birds and the blood and everything else, but he could say some things without giving it all away. "Better a bastard worth knowing than a worthless friend."
"In…London. Yes, London," John said, eyes darting this way and that as he took in the now familiar, if shadowy layout of his bedroom (when had he'd sat down on his bed?) and the person crouched a couple of feet from him, "Only a London flat would be this drafty in May."
"Am I such a miserable person to hold feelings of friendship for that you can't even voice them as you do with everyone else?"
"Shut up," John said mildly, averting his eyes to focus on wrapping Sherlock's hands. He could hear the teasing tone in his voice, which settled his nerves about the slip-up. Sherlock clearly hadn't read anything in it and was playing it off for his sake.
"You're not the only one that notices things," John said, voice soft as he pressed his cheek harder into the sofa.
The fabric was heavy and warm, with a distinct scent that John could place if he was blindfolded and standing in the middle of a stadium. Sherlock's scent stuck to everything; a strange mixture of spicy cologne and the underlying sharp, but surprisingly bearable scent of the chemicals Sherlock so enjoyed toying with. John
Sherlock said this at the end of the meeting as everyone was dismissed back to the bullpen, invigorated with new insight thanks to the consulting detective. They lingered for reasons unknown to John until Sherlock slumped down to sit by his side on the floor, displaying a rare show of exhaustion. The hours had snuck up on him as it had on John.
"Doctors always make the worst sort of patients," Sherlock sighed, taking the cup from him before planting a kiss on his brow that John felt like a brand through his hypersensitive skin. "Even worse than me, and that's saying something."
The bridge wasn't the highest in London, but John didn't want to go through the trouble of getting wet in the rank looking water and scaling the concrete embankment. If anything, the burglar they'd been chasing shoving him over the edge with a remarkably well-placed body check was more annoying than fearful for John.
finest whine at a man trying to help like a bunch of toddlers, I'll throw the next one at someone's face."
The ice of his thoughts melted into something more like cool water, no longer so cutting and needy for attention. John knew (despite some of his darker thoughts at times) that he wasn't a monster, and therefore neither was Sherlock.
In the morning after John's deep thought session, he unsurprisingly didn't remember much of his original thoughts to begin with. Bits and pieces lingered, intercepted by a faint memory of mournful violin music drifting through the wall. A hazy dream of marble statues coming to life, carved in the form of ancient gods caught him off guard in the very early moments of his wakefulness, but then something very heavy and expensive-sounding shattered in the kitchen and drew his attention. John slipped out of bed, managing to get a robe tossed on before exiting to deal with whatever situation his temperamental flatmate had started now, and in the moment that it took for him to get up and move, the dream slipped away like dust.
Simplified thinking maybe, but at this late hour and John's natural limit on his thinking capabilities, he thought it was the best he could do.
He sought Sherlock out instinctively. It was only natural, given that what remained of his blood was drying on his hands and that this was all once again his fault. John wanted to give Sherlock a piece of his mind for leading them into yet another hare-brained scenario.
"If I bleed out from this little poke, I'd die in shame from an undiagnosed and incredibly unlikely case of hemophilia," Sherlock quipped, content to watch John squirm under the weight of his still intense gaze.
John laughed shakily before opening them. Across from him, the lamplight turned Sherlock into a hazy vision, bringing out all the tousled bits of his hair and clothes and the nervousness that hunched his shoulders.
John had seen the microwavable meal abandoned on the counter and noticed that most of the beakers and vials that had once been left carelessly out on the kitchen table had either been stoppered or clearly labeled. He'd had a word with Sherlock last week after the man had used the creamer jar to store some questionable purple liquid, and he'd poured said liquid into his tea when he'd been too sleepy to notice it (he'd nearly had a heart attack when Sherlock had yelled for him to put the cup down). It had taken the man some time to come around, but when John had stumbled out earlier to sit on the couch, coated in a cold sweat and reeling from the nightmare, he'd noticed the change. He'd also noticed the food and the distinct lack of Sherlock doing any sort of nightly activities.
Granted, the more extreme situations regarding the lack of eating occurred when Sherlock was especially high energy and putting his all into the task at hand, whether it be some scientific discovery or a tough case, but that didn't mean John could fall lax in his vigilance. A grown man needed more than tea and
That was what the floating feeling was in his chest. Happiness, so weightless that it gave John the courage to glide across the kitchen and grasp Sherlock's flushed face with his calloused hands.
"Interesting," Sherlock murmured, eyes flicking away from the top of his head to meet his own as his hand fell away, "For someone of your intellect, your deductions were rather well made. Simple and childish, but accurate nonetheless."
Footsteps shuffled around to the other side of the bed, the side he was facing before a hand reached out and carefully rested on top of his head.
Sherlock's indignation was so audible in the dark that it made John laugh harder, buying him a little more time awake.
"Most likely considering the dangers I do so enjoy chasing. But if it's not absolutely necessary, I'd rather have you treat me," Sherlock said before giving him a rare smile.
of a person, and yet here you are. Listening to me ramble on about something that hurts you so," he continued, and his eyes turned plaintive as his voice pitched upward, not in volume, but emotion.
"Am I your mule now?" Sherlock asked, already getting out of bed, and John shrugged, kissing his cheek when he did as he asked.
Something flashed across Sherlock's face, and his finger was drawn away as his face set in an expression John had come to associate with the disdain he showed to the police. John found that he didn't like it when that look was directed at him and flinched ever so slightly.
Sherlock was close enough that John could count his eyelashes and see the shine in his curls. John held his breath and bit his tongue, clenching his hands to keep from reaching out to
The statement was said as if Sherlock was discussing some hard-textbook fact; words clipped and to the point.
"I apologize for that. I just wanted to check in on you, as the power's gone out," Sherlock said. John's eyes had adjusted enough for him to see the man picking at a loose thread on his robe, "I…did not realize that I may have created an accidental trigger."
of me!" Sherlock yelled, berating himself as he scrambled to find shoes, yanking a brush through his unruly curls.
They were getting the hang of it; this give and take of love. Sherlock may have been in John's care in the beginning, but in the end, it would feel as if they'd been like this all along: in the care of each other.
Time seemed to still around them. The faceless people moved in slow motion, leaving only them and the sand moving in what constituted as normal pace. John thought it was a silly question for him to ask, but Sherlock seemed startled by his ready answer, thin cracks spiderwebbing across his fine, flat face.
Besides, John secretly thought that Sherlock might've cared for him just a bit from the start, at least as a friend. He just hadn't known it yet.
"Not even in your precious science?" John blustered, trying to hide the fact that Sherlock's words made his already jackhammering heart skip a beat.
"Come now John, it'd be an entirely plausible hypothesis for an average person to toy with if it weren't for the fact that you don't
John thought, face flaming as Sherlock tugged him towards his taller frame, effectively acting as a windbreak. He was hardly acting better than a schoolgirl with a puppy love crush, but he couldn't help it. Moments like this with Sherlock were few and far between.
Still, he didn't enjoy having his feet dangling in midair or the change that had fallen out of his pocket and was now somewhere below. John's trivial attitude towards the whole thing might've been concerning for a normal person, but John didn't lead anywhere near a normal life these days.
He thought that maybe he'd imagined the whole thing, but in the now strong noon light, he could see the book that Sherlock had been reading sitting on the coffee table. There was also a pillow from his room beneath his head that he knew he hadn't brought out with him when he'd woken from his nightmare. He knew Mrs. Hudson couldn't have done it because she would've inevitably woken him with her fussy nature.
"Bastard!" Sherlock grinned, tugging him up with such a delighted look that John couldn't help but follow.
why Sherlock wasn't so monstrous to him? Most of the police force seemed to be utterly contemptuous of him, especially Anderson and Donovan, who'd even tried to warn him off from Sherlock. Seeing the tense way the police and Sherlock interacted had been not just awkward, but also unsettling in a way John hadn't been able to pinpoint until now.
However, staying objective when it came to Sherlock Holmes was harder than he anticipated, and soon became impossible when he realized the true gravity of the situation.
"I do many things on purpose," Sherlock said huskily, pale eyes steady and open in a way that made John extend his touch up to his flushed cheeks. "This, however, was a leap of faith. I think I only have faith in you, John."
(He didn't think about Sherlock dying. The thought was unthinkable, like trying to imagine the moon falling out of the sky or the sun ceasing to burn. In this one instance, John didn't consider Sherlock to be mortal, because thinking of his mortality made his chest ache in a strange way.)
"But my observations are hardly ever wrong. You should take care of this soon," Sherlock said, thumb moving to skim just above the cut on his face, grazing the soft skin under his eye long darkened by their erratic schedules and leftover nightmares of war.
John couldn't help but smile at Sherlock's never-ending feud against his older brother. The two were annoying with the levels they took it too, but Sherlock needed someone that he could go toe to toe with in between all the insane savants and criminal masterminds they dealt with.
It took another two weeks, another chase through London for a killer (who had been a surprisingly sprightly old man) and running to the nearest shop for milk in a sudden late-night downpour for John to finally figure out why the last question had bothered him so.
worked. John didn't think he'd imagined the brief flits of confusion he'd see on the man's face at times when speaking with people, or the blank expression he defaulted to when people grew snappish with him. His mind was an analytical one, and John, while the man's nature had caught him off guard and stung him a bit in the beginning (it's been barely a week, wasn't he still
John waited, gazing back steadily with a small smile. Sometimes, silence was necessary for Sherlock to think and come to his uncanny conclusions.
Sherlock Holmes looked just as he acted; grandiose and unearthly, like an untouchable god of ice and stone sent to dwell amongst mortals as some sort of divine punishment. Sometimes when John looked at him, he could imagine the man as one of those old marble statues of ancient days long past. With his cherubic curls, nimble fingers, and pale skin, it wasn't too far off the mark.
Sherlock's voice drifted through his shut door; baritone just audible as the rain subsided momentarily in its lashing against his window.
He was aware that his more than normal efforts to care for Sherlock's health were starting to be noticed. Sherlock was ever observant, and John didn't hide his efforts much unless he was trying to trick Sherlock into eating or sleeping. His care naturally extended to medical patch-ups thanks to their line of work; sometimes, it was more practical for John to do it instead of going to a hospital, not to mention the fact that he appeared to be the only medical professional Sherlock didn't immediately dislike upon sight for trying to help him. But full trust?
Sherlock only made a face back before hauling him upward with an impressive show of strength, dragging him back from the drop. The gray sky and rusted beams of the bridge whirled for a moment, and then John was back on his feet, with the closest to
