“Just a little left round the eyes. You can barely notice it.” She told him. “Kohl can be hard to get off.”
“You good with getting him out?” Dean asked Sam, and Sam had flashed a confused look to Dean, before shrugging and leading Crowley out, slowed by each door-frame’s individual devil trap, but quickly figuring out a method of disentangling him each time. This was, very firmly, not a place that welcomed demons.
"DEAN!" Sam called out, and his brother motioned as best as he could as he stabbed the demon for him to continue the chant.
Dean started taking note of all the furniture he thought would work well, snagging the throw he’d been eyeing up and throwing it over his arm too. That settee, that laz-e-boy. That coffee table would do well, and hell, get a TV while they’re here, the sign said it was in working order.
"It's our whole life." Dean stood up, bottle in hand, and leant against the wall. "At least we're good at it."
If he could, he would kiss him right now. Not heated, not desperate, but soft and with a smile. But he couldn’t.
Panic was setting in now as Dean pushed down harder each time on Castiel's chest. He didn't think of ribs, or bruising, or anything apart from getting his heart moving again. He could stay in a coma as long as he wanted, so long as he didn't just let go.
Sam clenched his jaw, watching his brother as he rummaged, weighing up the pros and cons. He saw the danger, all the risks of calling the angel for help, but what he also saw was his big brother rummaging desperately in the trunk of their car, desperately looking for hope.
"Something like that." Dean swung it round and took aim at a small figurine at the top of a shelving unit. He pulled and released the trigger and, amazingly, it hit precisely where Dean had been aiming. The old angel statuette that had been placed above his crib as a baby was now reduced to shards of china, and Dean smiled at the success.
"You can try, but they don't know anything." Sam said. "Ask for... what's his name... Timmy? Tommy?"
She knew how to spot if a house was empty. She could see within a few minutes if the family was in, she could tell which houses had gone on holiday and which had stayed. Despite her Father's dislike of the way she chose to spend her teenage years, it sure was coming in handy right now. Street smarts; far more useful than anything ever found in a book.
Dean cleared his throat, glancing down at himself and feeling a flush of embarrassment; sporting a semi at his Mother’s cemetery wasn’t exactly a classy act. He opted to lean forwards against the car, elbows supporting his weight; it looked casual, and would give him some coverage.
“For real?” She asked, and he nodded. “Phew, okay, that one worried me. I would just appreciate it if you guys didn’t murder me, is all I’m saying.”
It was late, and they’d been at this for the best part of 3 days now. Okay, sure, they’d been dicking around a lot too, but Dean was reasonably confident that they were done setting up the bunkers old alert system with Charlie’s new computer programme. Sure, he might be biased because he is just
A damn fine way to spend an evening, Dean surmised. It was artistic, poignant, yadda yadda; people drank alone in bars. The best type of people.
“Charlie.” He muttered, dropping the clothes and quickly shutting the bedroom door. Charlie would be able to help. He opened his phone and quickly found her name, pressing the video call button and waited anxiously for her to pick up. It was a reasonable time of day, she wouldn’t be asleep. But maybe she would be working, or busy - she can’t just be available because Cas is having a
“Thank you.” Cas said, walking on, not paying Sam much heed. Right now it was a matter of putting one foot in front of the other until he saw Dean again. He hadn’t expected this to be so nerve racking, the simple act of meeting Dean with clear intention and purpose. Perhaps he should have accepted his kiss last week, surely the following of base instinct and bodily, human needs would have been easier than this.
, just this once, if he could only have this once then he had to make this good, so good, give Cas everything he needed, make him feel like he could fly.
“Charlie Bradbury, I’m here to help.” Not immediately being shot, she lowered her arms, standing as tall as she could, which was basically nothing. “Or I need help. Both apply.”
He carefully moved Cas, as if forgetting that he wasn't actually simply asleep, and stepped out of the car. Sam got out too, and leant on the roof of the car, looking over to his brother. "So, Crowley knows."
"Make me." She winked. He bent down to kiss her, and for several minutes their lips moved in unison, hot breath and sweat steaming up the car. His hands continued roaming across her body, and hers explored his, soon finding her way back down to his crotch again. Despite not finding any improvement in the previous situation, she worked at it, sliding her hand inside the rough denim and palming what she found down there.
"T-shirt, sweatpants." He smiled at the grey shirt that Cas had just pulled out, noticing the embroidery. He stood up and walked over, beginning to sift through, curious as to what they'd bought. "Same as you wore last night."
“He was either gonna take down the Leviathan’s or die trying, probably both. He was pretty much done.” Sam sighed and shook his head. “And then you came back.”
"The common cold can't be caught from cold temperatures." He replied, pulling at the blades of grass with the pads of his fingers.
Sam offered to recompense her for the travel, but she reassured him that one of the perks of being a psychic was being a dab-hand at scratch cards.
Writing can be so weird... you think you're writing a nice scene about their Mom, and then all of a sudden they're talking about BDSM? Guys, it's a cemetery.
“No.” Cas gripped his hair, pulling Dean’s head to look up at him again, and Dean’s teeth bared in the movement. “Too much was asked of you. You don’t have to hold that on your shoulders.”
“What’s wrong?” He heard behind him, and he span around, seeing Cas in the doorway. He was slightly out of breath, hair dripping, and his shirt was half buttoned up. Dean swallowed, trying not to look at how the water shined on his neck, his chest. His eyes were wide as he took in the room, which then squinted into a frown. “This doesn’t look like an emergency.”
Sam hadn't looked away from Dean, who was currently warring with himself. One part of him was desperate to leave, to find a bar, to get drunk and lose himself in a woman and forget the wide eyed, puppy dog look that Cas was currently wearing. The other was warming to Cas, wanting to comfort, to close the distance between them...
She saw him land in the field, in the mud, on his hands and knees. She saw the angel sob, saw the tears fall, saw the hurt in the angel and the confusion at the horrendous harshness and intensity of this brand new experience.
Sam sighed, exasperated. “You aren’t going to let this go. You’re gonna kill us, or we’re gonna kill you.”
"Whatever." Dean stood, stumbling towards the tap and, turning it on, drank straight from the faucet. Once he was done he sloppily wiped his mouth and looked back at his brother. "So, why are we here? We got a case?"
The frown deepened. "You consider pasta to be easy to make?" Castiel had witnessed a lot of minor events over years, and whilst he had been stationed in Italy for a few centuries, he had, on occasion, seen the production of the food product. It had looked far from simple.
Sam nodded, accepting the responsibility in Dean's words. He had wanted Cas back just as much as Dean had. They heard the water tank change pitch as it adjusted itself, swiftly followed by a sloppy stumble from the other room, presumably Cas stepping backwards in surprise from the sudden temperature change. They both listened for a few seconds, making sure he was alright, before being satisfied he hadn't fallen in the tub.
He had the strange urge to walk over, take the book out of his hands and straddle his lap. To settle in, press himself close, to feel Cas against him. He gripped hard onto the doorframe, anchoring himself here.
Dean awkwardly patted her on the back, unused to embraces, before pulling away, surprised to see tears in the psychic's eyes.
Merely hours after Castiel first jumped in, her body was hers once again. She was vacated and left panting in the mud, a wealth of new knowledge crammed into her head. And answers to that which she had been searching for.
"Cas, what are you doing?" Dean pleaded. Suddenly, his face changed again, overwhelming terror in his eyes. "What, what is it?" The hunter cried.
"I'm sorry." He sighed, leaning forwards and taking Cas's right hand, looking at it. Experimentally he leaned further forwards and tugged on the limb, bringing the palm to meet the flesh of his shoulder. It was awkward, the other man's body unresponsive to him, but he held it there, using his free hand to clamp it down, curling the fingers around the flesh. For a second he felt a flash of familiarity, of déjà vu, of a memory he could never quite remember, and frankly, he didn't want to.
They walked in, and Dean went straight to the chest of drawers pushed against the wall. While he carefully checked all of the items there, Cas went to the bedside cabinets, looking at them. A photo stood in a frame on one, and Cas picked it up, looking at it. It was Bill West and the younger wife, standing in front of the house and smiling. But Cas saw more. At the very edges of the photo, past the paper, was a slight crease, a bump, a hint of something beneath. He flipped it over and, after fiddling with an annoying rotating clasp, flicked the back of the frame off.
"Oh, I put him on mute." She clarified. "His voice was grating, wouldn't you say?" She chuckled, before getting back on topic. "Where's your brother? I mean... I only need the one, but it would be nice to have a full set."
“He got a drink spilled down him, he was grouchy.” Dean bluffed, and Sam scoffed, clearly not buying it.
Dean knew what it was like to lose that respect from someone. He’d lost it, so many years ago, when he was 16. He’d seen the look on his Dad’s face when he’d come back to the motel early, that John didn’t look him in the eyes for months, how he never looked at him the same till the day he died.
"Why do you care? You hate the guy." She shrugged, looking at the hunter. She paused when she saw his face, though, and broke into a wide, triumphant smile. "Oh! You're beginning to get the warm fuzzies all over again! Mozeltov!"
"We may leave now." Castiel told him, sweeping out of the door. Dean closed it behind them, and walked after the angel towards the car.
"Floating on up back to heaven not an option, then?" Dean muttered. Sam and Castiel both looked up, surprised by his choice to finally speak.
"I dunno. Try me." She looked at him with all seriousness. "Then he body jumps me, and I get to see my Dad getting killed. I get the memory pumped through me. I get the back story, context, the guy's bloody mental state while he does it, and you know what?" She took a drink, finishing it, and gesturing for another. "I still want him dead."
The more he walked, the worse it got. What had just been seething, burning rage, turned physical. He felt like he couldn't breathe, air not getting into his lungs fast enough, yet his lungs felt full to burst as air scraped down his throat. He felt too hot and too cold, he felt confined in the white wash walls of the hospital, crammed in by everything, and he felt miniscule, like an ant ready to be crushed by a boot.
“I think there’s very little you could do tonight that I wouldn’t be on board with.” Cas answered, and Dean practically gulped. Well, shit.
Her dreams plagued her from the instant she closed her eyes. She saw it, she saw the Enochian sigil, wet and red. She saw the actions she needed to take, and she saw herself. She saw the part of herself that was missing, and she knew where it was.
Dean didn't need telling twice, merely nodding to his brother and brushing past the Doctor, who, frankly, looked relieved to be rid of him.
Instead Cas had turned back to himself, blue eye meeting blue in the mirror, shining perhaps a little too bright.
He took one last look at the angel and, after reaching up to his own face and palming his hand over his mouth, he left the room, ready to greet his friend.
You’d think the one thing he couldn’t fuck up would be an offer for a hook up, but he had pretty effectively proven himself wrong there. Repeatedly and consistently. It had taken him long enough to figure out that yes, he was buying what Cas was selling, but also long enough for him to put up so many roadblocks in his own way that he would need a fucking bulldozer to get through. And Baby was no bulldozer.
Tonight was the chance to try, to see what it would be like, to take a chance. Cas’s stomach fluttered, and he placed his palm across it to soothe the tremors. It wasn’t quite something he’d experienced before, and he took a deep breath in around it, feeling his hand be pushed out and followed it back in. His breath was a little shaky and he frowned as he processed it, trying again. He hoped it wasn’t gastrointestinal distress.
to get myself ready to fight, to not be a liability to you both in battle, on a hunt. I was once an angel, but even without my grace I am perfectly capable.”
"And they don't get paper cuts either." He told him. He shook his head slightly, pleading. "Come on, Cas; just tell me."
It was all rolling around in Dean’s head while he was just trying to get some fucking shut eye. It was their legacy. Their grandfather, not the douchebag they’d met but the one who abandoned their Dad, had been part of some agency or something, the Men of Letters. Dean and Sam vaguely remembered the name, some old hunting legend they’d heard over the years but never put much stock in, something long since destroyed, defunct or lost, one way or another. Except Cas said all the members were killed in the late 50s, including their Grandfather. That’s why he never returned home.
, Cas realised, absolutely enrapturing, eye catching. He watched as Dean hugged Charlie easily, and felt that flare of undeserved jealousy rise. He wanted to look away but he couldn’t, eyes locked on Dean. He knew that Charlie had seen, had seen her frown at him whilst they hugged, but he couldn’t help himself.
"Hey." The response was cautious, but Cas didn't look up, pulling the items out, endeavouring to find something to wear. "The tattoo looks good." Sam said, leaning to check it out. It looked identical to his and Dean's, and all of the traps they'd left in places over the years. "Should work fine."
"Good thinking. "Dean approved, glancing round, though found himself freezing when he found himself alone. Ducking down, he peered into the car window. No Cas there either.
"I'm sorry, Dean." The angel told him sadly. "I..." The words weren't coming easily. "I wish I hadn't done what I did."
Sam put down the tin of chicken-noodle soup that he was holding. "You specifically said that the film wasn't part of the story."
Dean swallowed hard as he heard the scratching of hands against the phone, and audible breathing getting closer. He tried to speak, but it caught as it came out.
“I’ve seen you in here a couple times lately,” She said, and he tried to remember if he saw her when he was here with Charlie. “You new in town?”
He leaned forwards, pressing a kiss to Cas’s lips, stepping in to his space and pressing palms to his waist. He felt Cas smile against him, answering hands warm around him, slipped under his jacket. The tip of Cas’s nose was cold against him, a little damp pressed into his cheek, and it was so damn human. “It’s cold out here, huh?”
He settled back, weight against his ankles and finally looked at the body in the bed. Somehow, the tears had dried up, leaving tacky track marks across his face that Dean could feel as he moved. He could see the damp patch from them on Castiel's shoulder.
Dean huffed, crossing the room and walking towards the front door. It was dark outside, the light from the cabin filtering through the cold February evening with nothing more to help it than the moonlight and stars above. As an afterthought, Dean grabbed his jacket, shrugged it on, and kicked the door closed behind him. He knew the cabin was going to start getting to him. With a grand total of three rooms, there wasn't many options when he inevitably wanted to get away from everyone.
.” She said. Both boys looked up as Cas walked in the room, curious, and they both shushed him, holding a hand up to indicate him to be still. “
He paused when he saw a familiar name. Bobby. God, Dean missed him. He'd always been a constant presence in their lives, a second Dad while they were growing up, and even more so when John died.
But it was important to Sammy, so Dean came along, standing close enough to be involved, but mainly left Sam to it. Dean looked back to the car where Cas stood waiting, watching them. Dean had offered that Cas join them, but he seemed to pick up on the halfheartedness of the offer, recognising it was just for the Winchesters.
"Sure you don't want to mix that with anything?" He asked her, eyebrow raised, but she shook her head.
She smiled at him, putting her hands on her hips, and Sam took a proper look at her. She was petite, slim, though covered up with some green scrubs, and she had a big smile with twinkling brown eyes. Her dark hair was scooped up into a sloppy bun, and a few dark hairs straggled down.
"I know you're angry, and you have every right to be!" Sam yelled. "But you need to deal with it, and you need to stop acting like you don't care! You're not just angry, Dean; you're really, really hurt!"
"You're just sand in an hourglass, Cas." She told him. "You can try and stop it from falling, but sooner or later, there's not going to be anything left."
He brushed the hair from the back of his neck where it had already began to tickle lower than it used to, and pulled it up, tugging firmly in frustration. He recognised a word for what he was feeling was
Sorry about the slower updates recently! Life and work is picking up a little, and I'm hitting a touch of writers block. Thank you for all the comments and kudos, they bring me a lot of joy.
"Uh..." Sam hesitated, looking up. "Another time. We kinda have things going on right now." He brushed it off. "So, vamp nest?"
"Hey, it's okay." Dean said, turning his attention to Cas, who exhaled in frustration. "Frank's sent us on wild goose chases before. I'll bet this is no different."
Dean's expression froze as his brother left the room, the practised poker face instantly on his face. He was not going to finish off.
Dean looked round briefly, but trusted Dean's judgement that they were unwatched as they approached the door. Dean tried the handle, testing its weight, and slipped from his pocket a small piece of folded leather and flipped it open. Cas looked in fascination at the small tools inside it, the thin metal contraptions.
He wondered if Cas would like jewellery. Probably, after his little rant about gender and clothing upstairs. Shit, maybe he’d need to buy Cas earrings.
Sam had been gone for a while. He knew he wasn't far; Sam hadn't left him to travel any distance further than the car since they'd been there. At one point Dean leaned back in his chair and craned his neck to look out of the window in the hallway, and saw his brother talking to a nurse, or something. Even from this distance Dean could tell she was pretty.
"His card is in the journal, he runs a taxidermy shop." Sam shrugged. "I asked him if he knew any legit faith healers."
Sam frowned in disbelief at her. She was holding his friend hostage, and she was singing. Pushing down the urge to scoff in anger, he simply shook his head and gripped his gun tighter, before taking a deep breath and rounding the corner.
“Oh no, I totally did.” Sam said, laughing at a memory. “There was a theme night at the student bar, can’t remember what it was but I went in a dress and Jess went in a suit. It was great.”
“Can’t I?” She asked. “I’ve been keeping my eye out for you two. I’ve worked with other hunters over the years, I hear a lot of stories about the great Winchesters.”
They finally reached his door, thank fuck, because as much as Cas seemed to like the noises he was pulling out of Dean, there was no way he was gonna let him make him loud enough to alert Sam. For the first time in his life he had a room of his own and he was gonna fucking use it. He shoved the door back, hearing it slam against the wall and got Cas far enough in to kick it shut behind them again, and suddenly Cas was back on him, pressed against him, kissing him with every line of his body right up against Dean, crowding him, and it was so fucking good. Dean scrambled to find the buttons of Cas’s shirt, opening enough of them to pull it over Cas’s head, and Cas forced Dean’s shirt off his shoulders while Dean reached for Cas’s belt, pulling it free and dropping it to the floor with a thud. They both kicked off their shoes with the combined agreement that the objective right now was for them to both be naked as fast as possible, and Dean pushed against Cas, forcing him backwards towards the bed.
He glanced up to see Dean staring at him, picking him apart with his eyes. The scrutiny was intense, and Cas met his gaze, looked back into those green eyes, bright and beautiful. They were flecked with gold, and the pupil was dilated in the dim light of the cabin, lit only by the fireplace. Cas wondered if this is what Dean had felt like all those times Castiel had stared at him with curiosity, trying to understand the man in front of him, feeling so utterly peeled back, so seen. An object of fascination. Dean didn’t often stare so long at Cas, didn’t let his gaze linger like this, but something in the context allowed it. Cas liked it.
"Thought you were going to bed?" Sam lay back down on the floor, moving his hands to his temples. Dean's body felt so bored of being stationary that he almost considered joining him.
He might not have been Sam's angel, he might not have had the profound bond that his brother had with the guy, but he still loved him. They were still friends.
"Curious." Cas commented, and Dean raised an eyebrow. "I am expected to apologise for something that is out of my control? Something that directly affects myself, not you?"
Dean shifted in his seat, the words striking home as true as if she’d slapped him across the face with an itemised list of everyone he couldn’t save.
Dean slammed the door, and within a few seconds, the car drove off, leaving Dean alone in the street, breathing heavily, rage and alcohol fuelling down his veins.
"In my sleep." Dean grunted, spinning the blade in his hand and stabbing it straight into the gut of an elderly nurse with a large saw in her hand. He slashed up, feeling her go limp under him before throwing her to the floor, the light flashing out of her eyes. Balthazar began to smite, but with so many demons at once, and all prepared to fight, he found himself swamped; the preferred method of palm-to-forehead-burn-out too slow when only one, or possibly two can be done at a time. Dean fell back, staying close to Castiel, while Sam stepped forward, attacking any that made it past Balthazar, while Dean took the rest.
"Oh, no. I'm giving you a chance to say goodbye. You see, I'm not as cruel as Cassie; I'm not just leaving you to wonder what happened to him. You get your goodbye. Whether it's loving or not is up to you." He heard a static woosh, and a thump, and her voice distant in the background. "Say goodbye to lover boy."
"Where are they?" Dean asked, and the man ushered them into the living room, in front of a large bookshelf.
It was at this time that Balthazar ran from heaven, faking his own death in battle. Commandeering a mansion in the heart of the English countryside, he lived with Penny and his daughter, teaching Livvie about her heritage, about the powers that she held.
“You wanna be able to settle down?” Sam says, leaning forward. “I mean, I know you wanted to with Lisa, you did-”
"That was touching, Cassie." Livvie smirked as she whipped the phone from Castiel's hand with her regained angelic powers. "Really. Looks like the tin-man finally found his heart."
He hesitated at the window, his hand resting on the door handle. For all of his anxiety to go to him, to be at Cas's side, he found he couldn't move.
He sighed, brushing the grass a little. “We’ve grown up a lot in the last few years, since Dad’s been gone. A lot’s happened. But…. Dean’s changing, I can see it.” He glanced back around, and could see Dean and Cas huddled close to one another. “He’s found someone, someone really important. Someone who’s good for him. And I think they could last, if , you know, both of them survive.” He chuckled, half joking, but sobered up when he realised just how much Mom would hate that joke.
But he stopped. He raised his head to the ceiling and sighed, a long exhale of a breath that he hadn't realised he had been holding. He knew that the pulse wasn't Cas's, and he knew that the warmth was residual. He loosened his grip, instead letting his fingers form a loose curl around the wrist. He reached over, snatching the half drunk bottle he had left on the nightstand. Because, what else was there to do?
Dean turned to him, giving him a stony look. He looked round, behind him, to where the comatose man lay in the bed, unresponsive to all that was happening. He lit the match. "What do you think?"
"Doesn't matter." She said. She stuck her fingers into the jar of oil and started to smear the grease across her skin, shivering as the cool air hit the damp.
“That’s what I figured, especially when that officer clearly covered for you. Dead giveaway.” She sighed. “You come to work for me, your records get wiped, properly. You get a salary, dental, occupational health. You get accountability.”
“You think?” Dean laughed, glancing over to him. Cas was smiling too, eyes bright in the darkness, and Dean had to tear himself away to look at the road.
He’d stalled. “I was thinking we could go out for dinner.” He said, watching as Cas relaxed at his words. “Just you and me.”
Dean glanced to Cas, who was watching Dean's movements with the spoon carefully, studying how he moved the ingredients in the pot. Dean smiled, giving the spoon back. "Don't get your panties in a twist, Sammy." Dean mocked, patting Cas on the back, immediately stopping when he caught his friends wince. "Damn, I'm sorry." He said, hand hovering a few inches away.
"Go." Sam told him, and Balthazar left, kicking through the pile of corpses at his feet. The coast was certainly clear; the hallway was void of demons, the only signs of life that of the fish in the aquarium. He had expected some stragglers, and considered the possibility that the demons had heard them talking, were waiting for them at the doors, at the supply cupboard.
He felt Cas shake his head. “You’re allowed to find this hard.” He said softly, and Dean tightened his grip around Cas. He shouldn’t, Cas shouldn’t know how much of a struggle this was.
"At least he's talking to you now." Sam pointed out. He patted the angel awkwardly on the shoulder. "He'll get better."
? It wasn't true, and they both knew it. Family didn't equal safety. "You're family. And that's more important."
"As good-a-time as any." He replied, beginning to feed the mattress through the window. They were a floor above ground level, and while the boys had made bigger jumps before, they couldn't risk it with a comatose body in tow. Sam shoved it, hesitating for a fraction of a second. No demons appeared. The coast was still clear.
Dean took another turn in the road. Cas clambered into the backseat, brushing against Dean as little as he could, though Dean still shied away to the car door as much as possible. He didn’t look at him, and he figured if he looked, he wouldn’t see any kindness there anyway. He didn’t deserve it.
Dean continued to pore over his book, glancing up occasionally to look at Cas. Each time his gaze stayed a little longer, shifting away guiltily each time until he snapped.
The car ride was awkward, and Dean still didn’t look at him, past a cursory glance over his outfit. He’d put on the stereo (Dean said it was Led Zepplin) and asked Cas about training today, asking questions about the moves, about yoga, about weapons training. He ran some hypothetical scenarios past him, making Cas talk him through what he’d do, what moves he’s use, where he’d use force and where he’d give.
“No, we just talked to the neighbours.” Sam said. “Family wasn’t in when we knocked, EMF spiked but didn’t see anything.”
Grabbing a handful of leaves he hoisted himself up, hooking his foot into the trellis below. It held. He lifted his other hand a little higher, pulling himself up, and began to climb.
, he’d said, and it was still here now. Dean didn’t think he was worthy of love, that anything Cas could say now would be under the influence of hormones and chemistry… he wasn’t ready to hear it now.
Cas hesitated for a few seconds, thinking before he spoke. It was dangerous, either way… but what in their life wasn’t? “There are many demons gunning for this throne. When we were working together his seat was strong but not secured, and I imagine it’s shakier now. But I believe what he says about other contenders. The protection would be a benefit, and we need all the assistance we can get in fighting Leviathan.”
He could take Cas out to that fancy restaurant in town. It looked nice in there, and Cas deserved nice. They could enjoy the finer things in life, could place fabric napkins over their laps and drink out of wine glasses. They could do that.
Cas looked to Dean, confusion present in his features. "There are... eight more films?" He asked, and Dean nodded.
His hand lingered in Cas's hair for a minute, teasing the strands there for a few seconds, and exhaled. Dean had tried his best to make Cas look like he was only sleeping, that he would wake up any second, but even that looked wrong. Cas never used to sleep, Cas would barely blink. Dean took a deep breath in, trailed his fingers down the man's cheek, and checked his pulse again. Still there, still beating.
the water pressure was great in this bunker) but it was now absolutely necessary. He ran the water over his face, scrubbing with his hands and using some of the face wash he’d bought in a nesting whim. He saw his hands come away gray, which he supposed was a good thing, but when he glanced out into the fogged mirror he could still see it all around his eyes and streaked down his face. “Fuck.” He muttered, reaching for the body soap.
, soot and smut deeply ingrained. Dean reached up, using his sleeve to clear off the top layer of dust and cobweb.
To start with he had simply sat on the bed, relatively content with his thoughts. He thought about Dean, about whether that brief moment of elation earlier had meant anything. He thought about his impending humanity, and whether he'd enjoy it or not. He thought briefly whether there were any more of those magazines around.
“I chose some more inconspicuous items, but yes, I did choose what I found eye catching.” He picked up a knitted cardigan in a variety of obnoxious colours and Dean barely smothered a grimace.
Balthazar smited two more in front of him, managing to gain some headway and stepping forwards, though one pushed around him, a little girl who reminded Dean a little too much of Lilith. He groaned and dispatched of her, barely flinching in his latin.
Can hummed in thought. “I’ve trusted you with my life, so many times, Dean. But I’m not sure if I can trust you to not change your mind again.”
It was quiet in the bunker when they got back, Sam safely tucked away in his room like he’d promised. Dean let out a sigh of relief; while it was good to know Sam was on board with this, he didn’t need his brotherly support right now.
"Castiel, so good to see you again." She smirked, looking him up and down. "You look different. You done something to your hair?" She grinned as Cas advanced, blade drawn undaunted by the rapidly approaching figure.
“You’ve already met her an astounding amount of times since her death,” Cas pointed out, and Dean shot a smile at him. “In this life it stands to reason you might again.”
“Hell was always going to let you go, it was everyone’s grand design, though of course I didn’t know that.”
She sighed, shaking her head. "I don't know the answer, honey; it's one tough cocoon to break out of."
“Who, you?” Cas said wryly, effort made into the gentle sarcasm, and Dean grinned. Cas was trying, every day. He kept seeing it, the way his walls were coming down, leaning into this human world a little bit at a time. He was really trying. But Dean saw the smile fall, and Cas looked back up at him. “I know that you can’t trust me, Dean; I don’t blame you.”
They took their meagre things to the room and set themselves down. Dean checked the clock, wondering if it was time to go to the bar yet, caring little either way.
Ten minutes later, Cas had reluctantly put on some clothes. He'd chosen the soft green jumper, wincing at the feel of it on his skin, though determined not to scratch it. If he scratched it, he might scar it, distorting the image, making the entire ordeal pointless.
Here appeared to be… yup, underwhelming, which is pretty much what he expected. There weren’t any road cameras here, a bonus, but it was decrepit, grey and lifeless, even for winter. Dean couldn’t see anything except a door to what looked like the sewers and… oh.
Dean leaned out of the car window, peering at the parlour. As he opened the door and stepped out he squinted at the displays in the shop window, pulling a face at the sight of the different types of piercings, specifically those with stretched earlobes. He grimaced at the sight of the holes in the flesh, thinking about how easy it would be to hook a finger through them, a claw, tear the skin. It would be as irresistible as a target.
Castiel looked to Gabriel, then back to Anna. Their eyes fixed, and while he didn't say anything, couldn't get the words out, she knew. The look of love there. They had been family and soldiers together for years before they betrayed each other in turn; now was not the time for grudges.
They found out Cas still worked exceptionally well with the angel blade; it took him a couple of tries to get the hang of it as a human, just like with the gun, but soon he was throwing the blade square in the bullseye every time. They tried in low light, they tried with Cas closing his eyes, they tried different angles. He was great… until they made him dizzy first. They span him a good twenty times, Sam bowing out before Dean, shoved the sword in his hand and told him to hit it.
Dean gripped the railing tight, holding himself from reaching out to Cas. And then he realised, so slowly and all in a rush… he really didn’t want to hold himself back any more. He peeled his fingers off of the wooden beam and moved, pushed against muscles that were telling him to run and forced his hand forward, placing it over Cas’s own. His hand was warm, and Dean could feel the bones of his knuckles under his fingertips. Maybe if he tried he would find his pulse under there, sure and true and proving that this was Cas, alive and his.
"Dad wouldn't let himself get close to people, either." Sam told him. "Dad would rather push me away than talk to me, and you are doing the exact same thing!" He pushed a little harder with his arm against Dean's throat, slightly choking him. "Don't you dare do that to Cas."
“It’s warmer now.” Cas’s voice was low, rumbling against him. The long press of their bodies against each other was downright inappropriate for a cemetery.
Cas looked confused, but stepped to the right when Dean flapped his arm, motioning for him to move. His workspace now illuminated, Dean quickly got the door open and ushered the both of them inside, trying to be both casual and quick, lest any curious neighbours notice.
Dean stood up, brushing himself down and walking to the stairs. "On second thoughts, I think I'll go to bed."
While Sam took in the possibilities of the room, Dean could only look at the inhabitant, at Cas, at the expanse of skin stretched out in front of him, pale in the dim light. Dean didn’t know the name of the move, just taking in the sight of Cas, legs and hips flat to the floor and chest pushed up from his palms, almost at a right angle, his head tipped back. “Hello.” Cas gruffed out, holding the pose for a few seconds more before releasing it, turning to look at them both. Sam waved casually as he walked the room, completely unaffected, while Dean stared, just for a second, at Cas, and what his body could do.
“Well, have at it.” He said, fishing in his wallet for his new favourite toy, the credit card Charlie had set up for them with no limits and no question marks. He held it out to Cas, who took it with some trepidation. “You remember how to use this?”
He blinked his eyes open a little more, carefully, as he took in the light in the room. Slowly does it.
She broke into number twelve, a house that was practically a mansion after the motels. Parking the car around the back so as not to arouse suspicion from any nosy neighbours, she let herself in quietly, using the same technique as she did to get into the car. Shutting off the alarm quickly, she headed straight for the fridge, plucking a beer and a chocolate bar out and slumping down into a sofa. It was plush and soft, and she almost felt like going to sleep right then and there - it was far comfier than what she had been sleeping on for months.
Shimmying off her boot, she looked at the small piece of jewellery. It wasn't much to look at; she couldn't see anything more there than a simple piece of silver. But that was it. That was what she had been looking for.
"Yeah, 'course." Sam agreed. Better to do it now, as soon as possible, rather than later, mid case, putting them all in danger.
"Help me out here, Sammie." Dean called over, grunting under the weight. Not that she was particularly heavy, in fact she was very petite, but her whole weight was resting onto him, and Dean was stumbling backwards.
"Why, Dean?" Castiel almost shrugged, his shoulders twitching pathetically under Dean's ferocity. "Will you hate me any less?"
He decided that this probably wasn't all there was to the computer, though couldn't even begin to work out how to find out what else it did.
Sighing, he took a sip, ignoring as the hot liquid burnt his tongue a little, instead relishing in the warmth. He'd had enough pain in his life to not balk at a little hot coffee.
Fair point. Still too many barriers. Dean reluctantly let go of him and Cas clambered down, pulling his pants and underwear off in one smooth motion, and suddenly he was right there, in front of Dean, fully naked. Dean sat up on his elbows, letting himself look, and he wondered if this was gonna be the point where he freaked. All that skin, the full sight of Cas, his dick standing proud. Dean had done that to him.
He briefly wondered if he preferred how it was before, being a devoted angel of the lord, whose only fate in his existence was to follow orders. Nothing was difficult, everything was clear cut and simple; now there was choice and heartache. Now he had free will, and that was difficult.
The hunter walked out of the front door, leaving the confused old man behind. Cas hesitated, and turned to him.
“For me!” Crowley pointed out, his voice rising into a shout. “I was the one jilted at the alter! And on the run after you missed your shot at Lucifer!
A wave of pain and humiliation raged through him and suddenly he was moving, his hand striking out, hitting the spell bowl from the trolley. It flew wide, crashing into the wall with a loud
Cas visibly relaxed somewhat, taking a step back, looking at her up and down, eyes narrowing at her words. "You are right. I do sense something different about you."
"Okay." He sighed, gesturing for Cas to dump the rest on the chair for some poor member of staff to clear later. "What you wanna do is
He remembered drinking, a lot. Vodka and whiskey and beer and who knows what else he threw down his gullet. Pushing through the haze he remembered having some company, someone blonde and attractive. He smiled at the memory, knowing she had been hot, but paused when her face swam into his memory.
There was a break in the crowd, a crack through the swarm for just a second, the tiniest second, and Dean saw him, shining eerily pale in the lights, hair dark, skin shining with sweat with his hands on the waist of the guy, pulled close. He was moving with him, dancing so easily, grinding, and he was gone.
Cas’s eyes narrowed as he took in the story, and Dean caught the way his hand gripped the mug tighter.
Dean shook his head. "No, it's... yeah, it's a bit weird, but," He frowned, trying to explain. "It's like holding on to them. If you've still got a piece of them, they're not completely gone."
Cas paused, hand on the door handle. “If you can’t handle Charlie attacking you in your sleep then we’re all in trouble.” He glanced up at Dean over the car, nodding at him. They would be
He looked back at the rings, his eyes stopping at silver glinting at him. There was one, way at the back, a band of beaten silver, or steel, maybe, rugged and textured, but looked like it would be good to run your fingertips over. Set in the middle was a large square stone, sea blue and shiny, glinting in the light. It was the same colour as Cas’s eyes, almost.
He psyched himself up, taking in a breath as he served himself. “How you feeling about yesterday, anyhow?” He asked, and Cas looked up, surprised.
He spent much of the film glancing back at Dean, taking more pleasure in watching his friend watch the film than watching it himself. In one of the many times that he found himself staring, as the light from the screen danced across Dean's face, he came to another realisation about the film. In the same way that the film was reminiscent of certain aspects of their lives, so were the characters. He could have found similarities from all of the characters back to his friend sitting next to him, but he found himself drawn to the fair haired captain, the cocky arrogance and steadfast confidence, the implicit trust his family had in him.
“Yeah….” Blonde hair, small tits and way too old for him, but not a bad time. He smiled at the memory. “I was, uh, 17? Said it was time I became a man.”
Because yeah, he regretted it. He regretted asking, regretted taking a shot at it. It was stupid, and probably only happened because it had been so long since he’d got some tail. A really fucking long time, for him. And being trapped down there with the same three faces, one of whom was his brother? He was bound to start
"But that's nothing compared to the first ice cream." He spoke aloud, voice echoing in the quiet room. There was no reply, except the slow creep of sunlight. It had started on his earlobe, soft hairs glistening in the light.
Sam chuckled; Charlie had recommended censoring their texts in case Leviathan’s were using tech to search for key-words.
Sam looked round, checking out the windows, but found they were all closed. "Dean, did you get air conditioner in here, or something?"
"infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et sectra diaolica," he yelled out, making sure it could reach as many demons as possible, remembering how Sam and he got out of a similar situation a few years ago. "Ergo draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica adj-"
"No, every time I say it you're being a pain in the ass." Dean yelled. "Don't think you can see inside my head, Sam. You stay out of it."
Dean didn't let himself admit it, but he wanted it too. He'd tried so hard with Ben and Lisa. He fit there, he really did. Making breakfast, real, proper breakfast for people, barbeques out on the back lawn, carpool and bedtime. He had done it all so well. It had disturbed him, at first, how well he fit into it. But there had always been an itch, that itch to get away, to hunt, to find something to kill. There was always going to be something evil, something wrong out there and he probably had it in his power to stop it. How could he rest at night knowing that others were dying in his place?
Cas opened his mouth to speak, but at that second Dean’s phone began to ring insistently in his pocket. He fished it out, glancing at the screen, before it was snatched by Cas. Dean scrabbled for it back, but Cas protested: “You’re driving.”
"Seriously, Cas?" Dean asked, strolling over to the closest trashcan, ripping the bundles for good measure before chucking them in. "Causing a scene in a goddamn Christian Bookstore?"
“Why are you…” He trailed off, regretting it instantly, but apparently he couldn’t help himself. “What’s up with your hand?”
Sam got there first, faster than Dean, shoved aside as his massive frame took up the entire doorway. Cas was thrashing in the bed, limbs twisted and tangled, his head turned to the side as far as it would go, tendons pulled so far they jut out in his neck. They had only just made it into the room when Cas's eyes snapped open and he was upright, hands clawing at the covers, the metal of the chain tying two fingers together, clearly lost, confused, absolutely freaking terrified. Dean stepped forwards, trying to keep the fear from his face but probably failing, recognising suddenly what was happening. Cas had had a nightmare. A really bad one.
"It healed up a while ago. The handprint. I think it was after the whole apocalypse showdown." He stroked the flesh, tracing where he remembered the edges being. "Man, I hated that thing. Made for real awkward conversations when I was with the ladies. But, I dunno... now I kinda miss it." He looked up and forced a smile at the man, who didn't offer a response. When he'd had it, it'd felt like a brand, singling him out, a great big "over here" marker. Or even worse, like he'd been claimed. Like it was Cas's tramp-stamp plastered on his shoulder. But now that it was gone, he understood it; it wasn't a claim, it was a promise. It was a sign that someone cared for Dean the way he'd been caring for Sam his whole damn life.
He got back up to the room, finding Dean still asleep. He'd shifted slightly; one leg had fallen off the bed, and his body had slumped to the left. If he slept too long like that, he'd wake up with a sore neck. But Sam wasn't gonna wake him – his brother needed to sleep off the day, to get some small measure of peace.
Dean's mind started to drift back to Cas. For the millionth time, he went through their resources, their guns, their hunting equipment, their friends, their connections, their powers.
The words stung, but Dean didn’t look apologetic. Cas couldn’t blame him. They never started out on even footing, and Cas had this nugget of information for years, Dean’s greatest shame, and never shared it, but always had it as ammunition against him. Cas wanted to reach over, to take Dean’s hand on the table, like he knew people to do on dates, but right now Dean’s guard had flown up, all from a conversation about musical instruments.
“I’m not a child, Dean. I’m not a “baby in a trenchcoat” anymore; I have trained, and I still have millennia of experience and knowledge that you don’t have.”
Cas shook his head, staring Dean down. “I know what I want tonight, and I’m fairly certain it isn’t for you to be a
It took arguably too long for Castiel to notice that almost all of these states of arousal very directly related to Dean.
“No, I want you to work for me. I want you to help train new recruits, show them how it’s done. I want you to teach us how to tackle the big threats, and I want you to bring people in who you trust.” She settled back again. “And then, one day, I want you to have the option to retire.”
The vision of Dean had receded, their brief connection broken, but he knew that it was still there. He span around, trying in vain to catch another glimpse, but all he saw was the white, bleached, ghostly emptiness of the small fragment of the universe they were in. He turned quickly back to Anna, pulse racing.
"Can't a girl change her mind?" She cocked her head, letting a few strands of hair fall coyly across her face as she leaned forward onto the bar a bit, exposing just enough cleavage to persuade the boy.
"To see you, silly." She smiled, and threw her arms round his waist, hugging him tight. Castiel was unsure of how to react, and merely moved his arms up and out of her way until she had finished embracing him. "How are you?"
words that he knew he had no hope of hearing but may be able to read none the less. He turned, pushing his way back through the crowd to what he hoped was the bar, to Dean…
Dean had been right last night, he needed to train up, and train up well, before he could hunt. In this state he would be overpowered in a fight easily if it came down to unarmed combat. Sam had generously laid some of the blame at being comatose for days, but that wasn’t it. He just wasn’t the angel Castiel any more. He was Castiel the human, in a borrowed body that could never be returned.
Sam and Dean both stepped forwards, towards the crowd of Doctors, Nurses, and patients trying to get in the room. Keeping them away from the bed was bullet point one.
"Morning, Cassie." Livvie called from behind him, and he turned quickly, scrambling to his feet. The sadness that had previously been so present on his face was gone, only to be replaced with heavenly rage.
As far as propositions go, it’s really not the best. Not the hottest. It’s no ‘last night on earth’ or anything. Rambling on about how awful it is being human and saying you want to have sex because it feels good is just… Well, it’s a fair point, and Dean’s used it to justify himself more than once.
"Yeah, alright." He raised his eyebrows. "She did it. Not far away, a house in the next town over. She gave me an address."
"You remember how he is." Sam reminded him, standing in the door way, having changed his top. "He can barely work out which way up a badge goes."
"Yeah, we did! It's what we do. We help." Dean downed his beer, and Mandy reluctantly handed him another. "We've helped him tons of times. And he still keeps coming."
Dean laughed, and Cas watched Dean carefully, waiting for any flash of the words landing on Dean, the laundry list of his failings and betrayals. But they didn’t, or at least he didn’t show it. “You ain’t touching Cas.” He told him firmly, lifting the crossbow up.
He'd been looking after Sam for as long as he could remember. Pulling the sheet back on to him was nothing short of normal, exactly the same treatment he'd been giving him all his life. Perhaps Sam didn't always see Dean taking care of him like this; making sure he was comfortable while he slept, making sure he got the last bowl of cereal. Sure, he was tough on him sometimes; they fought, they bickered, he played bad cop. But he was always looking out for Sam. He never stopped.
"Maybe he can't?" Sam suggested. "His mojo is draining, and he's already used some being at your damn beck and call."
Something that might have been a whimper came out of his throat, his chest, and he flinched when Cas clasped his hands on Dean’s biceps. Warm, hot actually, hot hands, radiating through his robe.
“Ah, fuck, don’t read too much into it.” Dean shook it off, taking a step back and letting go of Cas to awkwardly wipe a hand across the back of his neck. “Life we’re in, shit we’ve been through, wires get crossed, don’t they?”
“Whaddya say we ditch Sam and book a room, save ourselves a couple hours driving?” Dean suggested, and Cas hummed in thought, breaking away to glance over Dean’s shoulder to Sam, still at the grave.
"No. You find out that he's got a finite amount of mojo and you call him over? You make him use it unnecessarily?"
He splashed cold water on his face, looking at his reflection in the mirror. A tiny part of him wondered if it had changed at all since Cas had last seen it, if the brow was more furrowed, if the lips tilted down at the edges, if his eyes had lost some of the shine.
"No, I mean," She sat back down, sighing. "You're my Dad's best friend. You're practically my uncle." She looked up at him. "I was meant to go to you for help if I needed it. You were the one I could trust."
The door opened easily, no one around to see since they’d moved along the people who used here. Sometimes Cas would bring them sandwiches and tea, would sit and talk with them for a while, and Dean had worried to start with that it might go bad, but he always came back happy. And Dean started buying extra food for them, so Cas could start a damn soup kitchen if he wanted.
The bar was much more peaceably named than the last for Dean's liking; 'Tony's'. A nice, non descript name, nothing to remind him of anything. Tony, average Joe, the local watering hole for the masses. Plenty of room to lose himself in a crowd for an evening.
"That's great, Sammy. Did she say anything else? Did you talk about the weather?" Dean rattled impatiently.
Cas reached out, index finger extended, ready to touch Dean's forehead and transport them to where they needed to be, but stopped an inch from his skin. Dean winced in anticipation, but this quickly turned to confusion as he looked at Cas's fingers hovering before his face.
"Why would Bill West have kept a lock of his wife's hair?" Castiel wondered aloud. "I have noticed that humans find corpse's grotesque, yet he keeps a part of one..."
His brain then clicked together, and, after grabbing some supplies and locking the boot, he walked inside and straight up to the bar. A dark haired woman was tending, looking disinterested, though visibly perked up when she saw Dean.
He had felt so many human sensations since he had fallen. But nothing, not the itch of the tattoo, not the papercut, not the feeling of cold dew soaking into denim or the sharp goosebumps from cold air on wet skin… not the terror of waking up from a nightmare, or the ache of trying to keep his eyes open when he was desperate for sleep. Not the annoyance, the frustration, the joy and the sadness that came with being human, nothing compared to this, nothing so human as this, as his love for Dean. It overflowed, overwhelmed, and he’s never felt more human.
Dean scowled at Sam, shutting the door behind him in protest, belatedly realising he had probably just made the matter worse. He sighed, dropping his chin to his chest, before turning around, almost jamming the doorknob into his back in surprise.
Cas watched as Dean walked the distance, kicking at the slight snow that had fallen overnight. He was bulky with all the layers on, claiming more mass than he possessed, a shorter neck from how high the shoulders of four separate shirts climbed. Cas thought back to last night, how he slept in only one thin tee-shirt, the muscles of his arms thick but unassuming, more honest than the layers Dean wore right now. Sam was larger, without a doubt, in height and muscle, jutting and imposing and leaving no doubt as to the fact that he could overpower you in a second. He had no doubt that he was very attractive to some. But Dean, his thinner tone, his softer physique...
"We could make a barricade out of that lot." Dean suggested as he took down another. He felt himself taking another step back towards the bed, noticing that the gap between him and the back wall was getting a little too small for comfort.
. They shone from his face, a beacon. Cas couldn’t see Dean’s soul, not any more, and he knew now that he had taken it for granted while he could. It was etched deep into his memory from the first time he saw Dean, his butchered, bruised, torn soul, terrified and with one defence of enacting cruelty on other souls. He saw Dean, the real, true Dean. He’d known what to expect, had known that they were too late to save him before the first seal broke, but he had expected to feel pity, or more likely revulsion. Instead he felt sadness, overwhelming, and the intense urge to fight, to protect this being in front of him, to fight to save him and make him whole. The atrocity that was done to him somehow outweighed the atrocities he was enacting, and Cas had roared in despair when he saw him. This tarnished, agonisingly beautiful soul.
Castiel's face was pale, paler than it used to be. Days of comatose-bed-rest would do that to a guy. It lacked the warm flush of life. But something seemed lacking. Or rather, didn't.
“He was pretty pissed at you for not believing in him. Could be that?” He said, and Dean felt a flash of guilt run through him. “He really did save my skin back there, I coulda been dead without him.”
They’d gotten to know Mary in so many different ways over the years, though never really this one, the one who was a mom, who made soup and breast fed and had parenting books and waited for John to come home from work. But she wasn’t here, in the ground.
“I don’t care.” Cas replied firmly, cutting off Dean’s stumbling words. He couldn’t even say it. “My reputation is destroyed already. I have lost my place in heaven, there is no respect for me there. There is far worse already said about me than what Crowley can spread.”
"...You would've been rejected." Sam finished. "The lovely bartender Mandy was complaining about a drunk who was there last night, who apparently couldn't make up his mind on whether he wanted to hit on her, or to just sit there and complain about his friend."
"I don't think so." Sam said. "It looked like there might have been a haunting, but I looked into it yesterday. Just a publicity stunt."
“Being a doormat isn’t helping either. If you fall into a pattern like that you’ll never get anywhere. You were a warrior of God, I’ve seen you put him in his place. That’s the Cas he knows. He can handle being disagreed with. As for your “judgement”? ” Sam pointed at him with his bottle. “Yeah, you’ve tripped up a few times, who hasn’t? I got hooked on Demon blood, I thought I was doing the right thing. Just next time you’ve got a big idea to do something potentially stupid… talk to us first.”
"This vessel. It's imperfect, in fact, an abomination." Castiel sighed. "I need to get my previous form back."
Cas stilled, his hands stuttering on the mans waist, but the crowd didn’t stop with him. It continued moving, pressing against him, pushing him to move and he felt off balance, unsteady on his feet, ready to topple at any second.
They looked at each other with blank looks of confusion; no one recognised that voice. Okay then. Dean walked forwards, aiming his gun at head height before reaching for the outer door and unlocking it, pushing it open.
He couldn’t help himself, he turned around at Dean’s next words, turning to look at Dean as he stood there apologetic in his doorway. So, so beautiful, and so, so loved, even if he could never tell him. Could never tell him how desperately he loved him, how much he would do for him, would give for him, and how truly eternally he
“You’re welcome.” Charlie said, blowing into her own mug. “I was just telling them how we set up the tracker, and showed how to access on your phones.”
Cas inhaled sharply, and swallowed. Dean could see his eyes shining in the moonlight. “Everything I did, I thought I was doing what was best. For everyone… and for you, Dean.”
“I mean the last few years have been okay but since he’s been back, since he turned human? God, Dean, it’s excruciating.” He took another long sip of his smoothie.
He sat on one of the rocks at the water line, looking out at the water so the others couldn't see his face. He didn't want them to see him like this.
“We miss you, Mom.” Sam was saying, and Dean looked back at Sam, still towering over the grave. It was true, every day. There never was a day they didn’t. It was just a part of them. Sam wouldn’t remember a day he didn’t.
The floor was cold, but he couldn't feel it. The high sheen should have sent chills through his clothes, but all he could feel was the bright scorch his body was bathed in. It was bright, too bright, blindingly bright, searing the cold room white hot while it burnt.
Charlie hugged Sam, who absolutely swamped her by over a foot in height. Cas checked Dean, as he felt a flare of worry that Dean might be sad to see his new friend go, but he was still smiling, and right now was looking straight back at Cas. He seemed happy, pleased, though Cas couldn’t work out why.
"Yeah, you're right." Dean agreed, standing up and walking back to his chair, picking up the blanket. "You're sure you're feeling better now?"
"Give me a minute." He called back. He expected Sam to go back into the car, but he didn't. Instead he approached him, standing at his side. Dean looked at him. "Why aren't you mad?"
Dean watched for a few seconds, weighing up the pro's and con's of simply driving the car, or asking the angel what was wrong.
He stopped abruptly, suddenly aware of the fact that he wasn't alone. Looking up, he saw a tall woman looking down at him, red hair falling across her shoulders. She smiled, and reached down to him, offering a hand.
“Dean?” He heard behind him, and he lost focus on the body instantly. Cas had walked in… no…. this was Castiel. He was
Earlier it had been easier, somewhat. When it was an unfamiliar face looking at them, talking to them, it was easier. She may have spoken like Cas and been Cas inside, but she hadn't been the stark reality that he now was. Now, he was as he had ever been. He was once again the angel he had always known, the angel that had been Dean's friend. Except he wasn't.
Sam could have told him that it was okay, and that he supported him. But the boys were never that good at talking, preferring to keep secrets that burnt up until they couldn't stay down any longer.
“Oh.” Cas felt relief wash through him, looking at his own. Cas perfectly understood French, hadn’t had any problems reading it, and he smiled. He began to talk Dean through the menu, watching his face light up at the mention of steak, and Cas smiled at the excitement he saw there. By the time the waitress came back, Dean had settled on the Steak Au Poivre, and Cas ordered Coq Au Vin. Dean had smirked at Cas’s order, and it reassured Cas they were back on a level playing field again.
Sam kinda got a little stilted then, and drifted onto other things. Dean looked back over to Cas, who was still at the car, leaning on it, letting his head rest back against the roof and looking up at the trees above him. Maybe he’d fallen asleep, but it was unlikely. He was probably just enjoying the moment, the warm early spring sunlight on his face despite the chill.
He hung up the phone, smiling at Charlie. “Cas and Sam are gonna be back tomorrow.” He grinned. “Cleared up the ghost, no problems.”
Cas looked closer, actually looked at the details this time, and saw around Dean’s bright, beautiful green eyes a slight shadow, creasing the corners, tinging the lids purple, some dark definition below the bottom lashes. It was make-up.
He didn’t know what to expect from tonight. He didn’t know what Dean wanted, what Dean expected, what he should anticipate from Dean. He knew Dean enjoyed sex, but he wasn’t sure if Dean would want this tonight, or, truth be told, ever. He supposed what he wanted most from tonight was
“It’s a dangerous job, Dean, but it will not get done if I do not get started.” He saw Dean swallow, and his eyes were wide, frozen light, what was the phrase, a doe in headlights? He leaned in closer, his mouth close to Dean’s ear and as he spoke his voice was low. “I am strong, Dean;
“Since Dad died Dean’s gotten a bit better with it over the years, he really has. We found a lot of family, and we both learned a lot from them. But, like I said, this years been really tough, and he fell back on what he knew when it was just me and him. And he didn’t feel like he had anything to live for.”
But right now he was gonna stay here for just a few seconds more, bask in this happy glow, this safe moment that they’d both worked so hard for.
"Oh, but I think it does." Livvie smiled, sitting down on a chair and crossing her legs, the epitome of relaxation. "Because it means they're coming for you. And he's not going to give up easily." She smiled smugly.
He thought over what Sam was talking about earlier, about letting someone else in. He did want that for Sam, he really did. He knew Sam would be a good husband, a great dad, even a decent lawyer. When he first ran away, despite how terrified he was of his father's anger, he was relieved. Sammy might finally get that perfect normal life he'd always dreamt of.
He tugged Cas out from the back seat, always gently, and slung him over his shoulder again. Sam watched him, watched as his brother set his jaw and began the short walk up to the front porch. Dean seemed... okay? After days of panicking and worrying and being a wreck, the showdown at the hospital seemed to have pushed him past some of it. Perhaps the adrenalin rush from the fight had kicked his brain back into gear, or getting out of the sterile hospital had cleared the cobwebs. Either way, as Dean padded up the steps, carrying the smaller man with ease, he seemed a bit more like the elder brother that Sam had always looked up to.
He barely covered his moan as his orgasm caught him by surprise, a punch in the gut and his hand still working, not having the presence of mind to stop.
"It's fine." Cas replied, tensing in anticipation of the pressure of Dean's hands. He twitched slightly at the first light touch, gone after a split second, but back again just as quickly, the hint of nail at the edge of the tape holding the bandage on. The removal was slightly painful, the tug of skin as it resisted separation from the tape, the scrape of nail, but after a few second he began to relax into it, the sensation changing from an unpleasant tugging to a soothing tickle, the scrape itching and satisfying all at once. It was, however, short lived, almost as soon as Cas had gotten used to it, Dean grasped the end and tugged hard, pulling off the entire strip in one go.
He saw Cas's eyes looking down at his finger, worry clouding his features. Cas's eyes were crossed slightly, trying to see.
With conviction he pulled forth old fantasies from his memory: Sarah Michelle Gellar in a bikini; those twins back in 2007; Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica in that little blue dress; Miss Miller who tried so hard to teach Dean long division when he was fifteen. Gritting his teeth to stop a groan as he worked himself, one hand holding on to the shower hose, another on himself. The water roared above him, beating on his shoulders, running down his back.
“Why did you ring the alarm?” He asked, his posture relaxing, though still looked incredibly annoyed at Dean.
“Man, I hope she’s safe out there.” Dean sighed, watching as the car turned a corner and was gone, out of sight.
Cas felt movement from Dean, and looked over to him. Dean was holding out a thin foil packet, pushing it into Cas’s hand. “
Enough. He left the bathroom, glancing down at his outfit once more, feeling secure in knowing this one aspect of himself would be correct. He grabbed the scarf from the back of the chair, knowing in the early February evening he would need it, seeing as goosebumps were something he now had to deal with. The bedroom door remained ajar as he hadn’t yet formed the human habit of the perpetual need for privacy, and there was nothing in that room that needed to be hidden. He walked to the library, and Sam looked up from a desk, giving Cas a soft smile and a nod at the outfit.
They ended up back in bed, regretfully mindful of Sam’s text’s to both of them, though Dean had  offered a blow job in the kitchen just to spite him, one which almost physically pained Castiel to turn down.They dragged themselves back to Dean’s room, and Dean had knelt at the foot of the bed and taken Cas in his mouth for the second time. It was slower going, several orgasms already under their belts in the last twenty four hours had taking the edge off of urgency but hadn’t hampered on this need for closeness which had erupted in both of them. Dean had taken his time, gotten used to the shape of Cas, eager and exploring while Cas petted his hair, his shoulders, the line of himself in Dean’s cheek. It was addictive, having Dean like this, being allowed this, and while he’d only known it a short time he knew it might kill him to have it taken away.
"Is that an invitation." She asked softly, turning in her chair to look at him, tilting her head coyly and looking at his neck. She gnashed her teeth.
And yet, this isn’t new. He realises, right then, that he’s felt this for a long time, long before he fell.
With instructions to text if they thought of anything else they wanted, Dean left before Sam and Cas had even finished their eggs. He figured coped with that pretty well, to be honest, and Sam hadn’t clocked anything off, which was generally a good sign - that kid’s radar was generally pretty on point.
So he filled up his flask and he returned. Sam didn't say anything, not even when he took the first sip. Now wasn't the time to readdress Dean's problem.
Dean flinched, glancing down at his brother. "Shut it, goldilocks." He grumbled, watching as his brother chuckled and turned the corner.
Charlie asked, and Sam set the phone up on speaker on the kitchen counter and went to dig around the fridge.
His head snapped around to look at Sam, who was standing a few metres away, concern etched across his face.
Writing an in-canon fic from over half the show can be really strange sometimes, especially when writing about Mary. We know for a fact Mary was a terrible cook, but S7 Dean didn't know that.
He barely had any time to process, let alone give him any form of response. Sam had blundered in, he had been
“Yup.” Dean pulled out their own, and they swapped, all of them taking a swig, holding the silver without burning. And she pulled out her own travel bottle of Borax; Dean and Sam traded impressed glances at that one.
Satisfied that Castiel knew nothing of his daughter, Livvie was returned to her previous state of being ignored. Life moved on, but now she was aware – she kept an eye out for Castiel and the humans he was so fond of: The Winchesters. They seemed to have flitted in and out of the spotlight – the amount of times they had died whilst in police custody was somewhat baffling, but they still seemed to be alive and kicking. She tried to ask her Father about them, but this only served to revert him back to his disciplinarian self, telling her she must not interact with them, ever.
He looked at the bed and could see smears of dark makeup on the pillow case, swearing again. He stripped the bed, checking that the pillow underneath was clean, and held it in a bundle to his chest. He headed to the utilities room, chucking it in the machine to clean them, before heading to the kitchen. He still felt unsettled, and he took a deep breath before strolling in, grinning as he saw three people inside.
Dean had already stopped watching Balthazar, dropping to his knees, ignoring the blood on the floor as it soaked his jeans. He took Cas's shoulder and shook it, lightly at first, but then rougher.
“I’m fine,” Cas said simply as he glanced around him. “Dean’s gone, but I imagine he is still working through his hangover.”
In the end, he chose to proceed as Dean had instructed him to: he took a shower. By the time he stepped out once again into the cool air the blood had recirculated under the water of the shower, though Cas suspected this problem would only resurface.
Sam knew about them, they all knew it. Dean had said he’d talked to Sam about it, that the conversation had went well. He would have been nervous to mention anything, but Dean had already made it clear… “As was the sex.”
“Nah.” Dean shrugged, looking over at his little brother kneeling in front of the grave. “But, if it makes him happy.”
“Dean, why are we here?” He whispered loud enough to be heard over the thrum of the bar, now louder up close, and Dean smiled, finally meeting his eyes. They were kind, those eyes, and happy. It was how he looked when he fixed his tie, when he taught him to shave, when he took him to the brothel. This was Dean helping him, this was Dean helping his friend.
He nodded, lifting his hand to wipe across his eyes, sore and dry. A mild headache played across his brain, the light from the TV too bright in the room, too bright for his eyes, but he didn't complain. Forcing his eyes open, he heaved himself from the sofa, finding the tiredness in his limbs uncomfortable. He wondered if he would feel like this every night.
They’d hit up the grocery store in a minute. The thrift shop was open, it had weird opening hours and they hadn’t manage to catch it yet. Thrifting tended to be a good shout for easy clothes top-ups and boosting Dean’s cassette collection, and they hadn’t yet accidentally bought a haunted item. Yet. This one was pretty big, spread across three floors, and they headed straight for the second floor, men’s clothing and bric-a-brac.
"Oh really?" She laughed. "I've been in your head, Cassie; I've seen what you think. And I think you're jealous. I think you wish it was you." When Cas didn't react she continued. "You hear Dean bragging about his latest slut and you can't bear it. You vanish somewhere and Dean thinks you don't want to listen because you disapprove, or you're a prude. But it's not that. You're a little green eyed monster."
"Yellow eyes was a demon, who's big bad mission plan was to turn my brother into the spawn of Satan."
“I met this kid, a good kid. He was a shifter. Was I meant to kill him?” She asked, and was met with silence. “Killing people, monsters, whatever, based on their species doesn’t seem right to me.”
“You’ve seen him shoot, Dean.” Sam cut in again, whacking the back of his seat. “And he’s good with the blade-”
with Cas. That he knew John would hate this and he was gonna do it anyway. He didn’t recognise himself, and that actually felt like a good thing. He had snippets of what he wanted to say, fragments here and there, but the thought of going in with the conscious decision to kiss him filled him with fear. And what was he even looking for, what was he even wanting out of this? He’d said before
He'd been sitting at the computer for several moments, trying to understand the machine. It was somewhat baffling, and he prodded at buttons experimentally, confused as to how Sam seemed to navigate it so easily.
Balthazar climbed the stairs with ease, not encountering one demon in the entire journey. None of them had dared dream it would go this smoothly. Of course, the hardest was yet to come, Balthazar knew this, they all did. He knew there would be an ambush waiting for him.
"Don't give me that Switzerland crap." He retorted. "You honestly think he would be better as a human."
Cas, who had been watching the proceedings as a bystander found himself looking more closely now. For the first time since he had been back, he saw Dean smile, saw the corners of his mouth lift and move the flesh of his cheeks up to crinkle at the eyes. He saw this, but he knew it wasn't right, it wasn't real. It wasn't the true smile, the smile he'd seen on occasion, the smiles that he had been the cause of. This was a smile for show, a smile as part of the facade, and it was not real.
The angel did not reply immediately. Is Sam did not know him, he wouldn't have thought he reacted, but he knew better: he noticed the slight furrow of the brow, he saw the pursing of the lips and the eyes flicking down. He didn't know how to convey emotion, but he certainly felt it.
It took Dean an hour and two coffees to get him alert, spending the time reading the newspaper that Sam had picked up on his run. Garth was right, there were no hunts going, but apparently the economy was still in the crapper. No surprise there. Eventually he looked over to Cas, who had turned his attention back to reading, leaning forward so that he wasn't putting pressure on the tattoo, which was risen, and no doubt itching like all hell. Dean could see the bone structure of his spine from this position, softly jutting under the skin, the faint hint of his ribs.
"Think spring's coming." He told the man, peering out. He looked back at Cas, his listless face, and noticed with a small smile that the sunlight from the window was just shy of reaching his face, but would, in time.
They had been driving for about ten minutes. Sam had been examining the crossbow for almost the entire time, trying to glean some hidden meaning in it whilst he planned strategies.
“Dean. As you spotted earlier, I’m not really in the mood to be hit on right now. So if you’re looking to blow off some steam you might find some luck at that table down there-” She gestured to a table down the way, where a bunch of forty something women were drinking, laughing, and Dean raised an eyebrow in consideration. “But you’re wasting your time here.”
"Ah..." Dean sighed, wiping his eyes and turning back to the road, shaking his head, a smile still dancing on his face. "Let's get you back to Sammy."
The Leviathan's grin widened, and suddenly it snapped, jaw splitting wide, teeth flashing, huge black gaping hole ready to devour Dean down whole. Cas strained, unable to reach his weapons as he watched helpless as-
"By yourself?" Sam asked, stepping aside so that Garth could get in, and the man looked around with interest. "Not bad, Garth."
"Don't be such a girl, Sammy." He snapped. "I asked him to wake up, he woke up. Can't we leave it at that?"
As he looked into Cas's eyes, he couldn't quite bring himself to step back, step away from his friend. He could feel the soft tickle of his breath against his face. He should be moving back, brushing it off with some macho joke, get a beer, shoot some pool, watch some porn and jerk off in the shower. This wasn't what he did. He didn't do this.
Cas’s eyes darkened, and Dean felt a shiver run down his spine. “But the noises you’re making are too addictive.” He said stepping back in and reaching his hand back down, and Dean gulped as it curved around him again, still over the fabric but warm, delicious, the pressure causing him to thrust his hips forward involuntarily, chasing the friction. “Last time we did this I didn’t get to
Cas was beginning to shake, his thighs tensing, his hands on Dean grasping, gripping hair, bordering on frantic, and as if led by instinct, by some greed for this connection, some self-destructive urge, he let go of the trembling thigh and grabbed Cas’s hand, weaving their fingers together and Cas gasped, choking out “Dean, I-”, stuttering as his hips jerked and he was coming hot and fast into Dean’s mouth. Dean tried to swallow, but rushed by his own orgasm he groaned, his fist pumping fast, aiming dimly between Cas’s feet, and he felt come overflow from his lips, messy and unprofessional but so visceral and real. Without thinking he swallowed what he could, chasing the rest with his tongue.
He looked away again, back to the water. He couldn’t look at him while he said this. “I wanted to say… I’m sorry. That night, at the bar… in the alley. I didn’t do right by you.”
“Honestly, Sam? That year…. I wanted that so damn badly. And I would take it again in a heartbeat if I knew I could keep it.”
“That was too much.” Cas surmised, and Dean looked up at him, sighing again as he put the menu down on the table.
"Yeah, but a motel usually has a bar near." He sighed as Sam just continued, up and down, up and down. "We need a hunt."
"Actually, it's not easy to say anything." Cas corrected feebly. Dean looked round at the girl, seeing her pale and forlorn. Something twinged inside of him, and he reached down on the floor for a water bottle that he knew was there.
"Guess you've never had one before." Dean contemplated. He realised how strange it must have seemed, to someone who was unused to it. Falling into unconsciousness only to think you were awake. Being completely safe but thinking that you were not, that something was after you, reliving worst memories. It sucked that he'd started with a nightmare, and not a dream.
And so, the life that John was meant to have was gone, and the life they, apparently, should have been inherited, had been lost. And now some bunker was sitting abandoned and dusty in Kansas with their names on it.
"Atta, boy." She giggled, and he growled again, indignant at her patronising tone. He kissed further down, reaching her collar bone and licked along it, causing her to giggle again. Going further, he began to dip into cleavage, into the sainted area that men seemed to be so fascinated by.
Sam scoffed, looking up at Cas, who narrowed his eyes as he looked between the two brothers. "He's right; I am having difficulty following this discussion."
As he got his breath back, hands clawing at the sheets, he looked up, seeing Dean still asleep on the recliner in front of him. He hadn't woken up. His leg was sticking out from under the sheet, golden tanned and lightly haired. The sunlight from the window was just reaching his toes. Cas sighed, getting out of bed. He wasn't going back to bed, to sleep now. The clock ticked over half eight.
"I'm not!" Dean yelled, stepping close to his brother and yelling into his face. "I'm not done with him!"
"Whatever." Sam chuckled, slinging the bag over his shoulder. "See you later. Have fun!" He called, walking away. Dean watched, sulking slightly, a small pout on his face as Cas approached him.
"I'm sure you would." She replied knowingly. Dean turned away, looking out the window, ignoring what was happening, which was, admittedly, not a lot.
“Yup.” Dean answered quickly, yanking the door open and stepping in. “We’re hitting the shops first, Cas is making
Dean grabbed the pack, shuffling it fast and dealing between the two of them, slamming the pack back down and pointing to Cas and the hand dealt to him. “Right, lets go over this again.”
Only one way to answer that question. “Peachy.” He told her, smiling despite the purely audio nature of a phone call. There was no way to explain everything they’d been through in the years since they’d met. “What about you, still in the force?”
"I, uh..." He breathed, looking at his friend, leaning forward, letting his weight fall on his right hand on the bed. "I believe so."
He could feel the rough graze of stubble under his fingertips, and he tilted his head, stroking it softly. Did it seem darker than usual? The angel had always sported a five o'clock shadow, and maybe he was imagining it, but he could've sworn it was worse. His fingers played along the grate of it, stroking up and down his cheek, enjoying the texture. Without thinking, his fingers travelled along, back down from his ear, and landed at the man's lips. His fingers didn't stop, mapping the texture, first the soft line where skin met lip, and then just further in, scraping the chap of his lips. He remembered the feel of them against his, warm, but unresponsive, different, but utterly right.
“We’re running out of hiding spaces.” Dean grumbled. “And we don’t even have…” He trailed off, looking at Cas, remembering times when Cas would be able to zap them away to safety, or blast demons away with ease. Cas met his eyes, and knew he was thinking the same thing.
“I know. I’m not going anywhere.” Cas told him, stroking a soft palm down between Dean’s shoulderblades, and he all but melted in.
Cas rolled his eyes, a mannerism he had picked up from the hunter. He didn't see the point of the gesture, nor understood it, but felt it to be appropriate at that moment.
It turned out that a simple hormone pill that Penny took prevented them from spawning. For a long time this worked. Then one time, after she had drunk too much at some social event or other, she vomited, expelling the pill from her system. This one time had been enough. A month later Penny told Balthazar she was pregnant.
His powers weren't unlimited any more, he couldn't just use them as freely as he did before if he wanted them to last. He could still be one of the more powerful beings in all the cosmos... if he didn't use his powers.
"I believe it's customary to say good night?" He asked half heartedly, already looking forward to the bed.
And then it struck him. A name that hadn't occurred to him, though surely it would be an obvious choice. A perhaps useless contact, verging on dangerous, but ultimately their last chance.
“A cop, met her once about five or so years back.” Dean told him. That coffee looked good, should he go for one too? He’d not had one too long ago.
Both were standing at the very edge of the water, craning their necks to see if they could spot anything, anything at all, some form of disturbance in the water. Both were so engrossed that when the girl next to them started yelling, they were, needless to say, very startled.
"All angels are voyeurs, Dean." He reminded him, and the frown dropped, sadness replacing it. The eye contact was dropped.
And he gave her something. The night that Castiel found Balthazar, the night that she had been locked in the basement, he gave her a necklace. It was silver, shining, and in the curved shape of 'M', the Enochian symbol for love. It had been her mother's, he had told her.
Dean shone the light aside, following the upper level along, spotting a table and chairs that had been abandoned. An old cup of coffee had long since run dry, the tide mark showing the years. It sat next to a half played game of chess, and this weren’t no dime store set. “This was just left,” Dean said, flicking an old white cigarette butt in a silver ashtray. “What the hell happened here?”
"Huh." Dean huffed, looking it up and down. It had been several years since he'd done that, not since he was 17 when he'd snuck into a girl's room in the dead of night.
"I know all about it, I've been told." She said simply, referring to her special skills. "Would've been nice to hear from you, though."
"Humans build doors to keep people out, yet readily sell contraptions enabling others to can break in." Cas frowned. "It seems... counterproductive."
He remembered sitting down at the table, Charlie taking his chin in her hand and carefully running the lipstick across his mouth. He’d laughed, and she’d laughed, telling him off for moving. He’d been happy, spending time with his friend, the thrill of
One day, maybe, Dean would be ready for the truth. And Cas could be patient. One day Dean Winchester would know he was loved.
There was very little life in the room so far. He had started with one small pot and some seeds he had found in storage, dutifully watering it every day, but the pot stayed stubbornly barren. So he’d found the gardening books, not in the library, but in a small room nearby, and had read them cover to cover hear in this room. To start with he had sat on the floor, but it soon grew uncomfortable, the hard tiled floor digging into his sit bones, and he had dragged an armchair from the library the long length to the conservatory, taking no small amount of time. He had learned about pollination, about fungi, about rewilding forests, about companion planting, about allotments, about flower arranging, about composting. As he read, he experimented. He’d emptied all of the dead soil from the pots, taking innumerable long walks from one end of the bunker to the other and dumping it safely outside. He had driven to the Garden Centre, buying 50 litres of compost, a basket full of seeds, and a decrepit plant in the reduced section, flowers pale brown and crispy, dropping when touched. Sam and Dean had helped heft this all to the conservatory, Dean grumbling the whole way about getting him a wheelbarrow if this was going to be a regular thing. Sam lapped Dean twice.
All of this would work, for a while, until Cas started coughing again, or whimpering in pain, or Dean caught a glimpse of her in the mirror. Then he would remember all over again, everything. His anger would resurface, he'd grip the steering wheel tightly, literally white knuckling it, and blink back the red hot dampness that annoyingly appeared in his eyes. And each time this happened, he'd push down harder on the accelerator, to get there faster. To get that angel out of that body.
"Cas-" He choked out, unsure what to say. His fingers twitched, reaching closer, trying to close the distance.
"Yeah, Daddy didn't trust me with it." She smiled without humour. "He was planning on giving it back, but I guess other things got in the way..." She took a step back
They rode in silence for a while, listening, or not listening, to the stereo blasting out 80’s rock. The songs passed, and the scenery changed to trees instead of buildings again, back out into the sticks. But Dean, he had to say something. He needed to make this clear, that it was just once, and should be forgotten about. It needed to be said.
The poor guy was clearly low on options. But if that’s what Cas wanted, if Cas wanted to get his rocks off with a guy,
“What?” Dean looked at him then, eyes making contact, and he saw the hurt, the flicker of regret in Cas’s eyes. Oh, god, the regret. A surge of panic rose in Dean’s chest. “What do you mean?”
Cas didn't say what was wrong. Dean wouldn't understand, probably due to the fact that he hadn't told him what the problem was. He could easily take him there in an instant, probably... but he remembered his dying grace, and knew that this simple act would sap away at a chunk of it.
Cas rolled his eyes. He had fought in wars for aeons, had torn humans apart long before anyone but the creator had any notion of the Winchester bloodline. Cas tested a smile, mirroring the cockiness he felt in Dean’s demeanor, and was rewarded with a flash of teeth.
Reaching the motel they found that Dean had already sorted the room. He certainly hadn't gone out of his way to accommodate Cas in this, had instead chosen the usual two-bed rooms, though, Sam noticed, it did have a semi-comfortable looking recliner in the room, if Cas didn't mind staying on something that probably had never been washed.
before he came out of that lake. He fell the second he placed a hand on Dean in hell. No, he fell the instant he saw him, and instead of feeling revulsion he had grieved. He loved from then, he’d fallen then, and only now was he catching up.
“Got it!” Sam yelled, lifting the journal high, old, brown leather. The lights flickered again, and the air punched out of Sam’s lungs as he was dragged backwards, the ghost of Grandma clawing at him, gripping him from behind.
"I'm taking my time, kitten." She laughed. "We have to wait on lover boy and chuckle-head, now, don't we?"
He sighed and laced his shoes, ready to go for a run. He would let Dean sleep for a few hours before he woke him up, not that there was anything really to get up for. Just the usual – evading Leviathans whilst trying to figure out how to kill them.
“We were screwing around last night.” Dean said simply, wiping at his eye self consciously. “Like you never slapped on back at Stanford.”
Castiel carefully approached them both and, after a brief hesitation, placed a fingertip on each of the brothers' foreheads. It lingered for a fragment of a second longer than usual, the warm pressure against their brows, almost infinitesimal, just enough time for Dean to scowl at the delay. With no more warning than that they found themselves back in civilisation on a main road, on the edge of a driveway of another motel.
“Dean…” Cas spoke, and Dean could hear it distantly, but it was far away. Just Dean, too small and clamped in, held tight and suddenly cold. His body sucked in a huge gulp of air but there wasn’t enough. “Are you okay?”
Livvie straightened up, furrowing her brow, taken aback. "Do you expect me to be looking forward to this? It's necessary, but it's not exactly how I'd like to be spending my Friday afternoon."
"Right here." The man said, pointing at a spot on the floor, directly in front of the bookshelf. It was half filled with books, others scattered around on the floor, pushed to the wall.
So he walked, hands shoved deep in his pockets, curled into fists in the tight fabric. Occasionally kicking litter that got in his way, he didn't pay much attention to his surroundings, instead choosing to keep his eyes on the floor, his chin pretty much on his chest. Anyone that saw him knew that he was not in the mood to be messed with.
So. It's been 7 and a half years since I've updated this. I'm not sure if this is going to get anyone's attention, but I hope maybe a few people will read it. It's been a long time since I've written anything, but Season15 has just gotten me back in the zone.
So he made himself useful while they were out. Dean had already wiped down a counter in the kitchen, but if Dean wanted to cook there later it didn’t seem fair that he would have to clean up first. He found his way back to the closet from earlier, pulling out everything that seemed helpful, which was most of it. Cas hadn’t really
, the acknowledgement of what Cas had said last night. So he kept it simple, made Cas follow, and let instinct take over. Sure he gave him some pointers, what’s a friend for? Should he have told him about drugs? Drugs were a thing in this scene, he knew; more than once they’d checked out a case and learned quickly it was club-drugs. Cas should know about that.
Livvie's hand was out, a smug smile on her face as she made eye contact with Dean. She knew she had won.
Locating the small silver charm, dulled by the years since Bobby had given it to them after Sam had been possessed. Shaking off the memory, he slammed the trunk, twisting the chain along his fingers, swinging the weighted end as he walked back up the steps and into the cabin. Waving it to Sam as he walked past, he closed the door behind him, and trudged up the stairs leading to the bedroom.
"Oh, that doesn't sound too good." She cooed. "Is it the whole Dean thing? Because I could give your sweetheart a little encouragement if you wanted."
It smelt dusty, old stale air but dry, following his nose as he brushed through a spiderweb. He reached for one of the flashlights they’d grabbed from the kit that shifted from trunk to trunk, turning it on to light the passage. Thankfully no graffiti, no bottles, no needles, it was a different world in here. There was another door only a few meters down and Dean walked slowly towards it, not trusting a damn thing. He took the handle, carefully, and opened that too, pushing it forwards into…
“Well then, I suppose there’s no point in driving at all,” Cas shrugged. “Walking everywhere would be far better for the environment.”
And Cas had said. He hadn’t even asked, had he? He’d just said exactly what he’d wanted, in no uncertain terms. He hadn’t asked Dean what he wanted, he’d just laid his own soul, or whatever, bare, and let Dean take from it what he would. And instead Dean had dragged him through no’s and yeses and mixed signals. Dean had spent the last few weeks trying to process without looking directly at it, and had left Cas with zero courtesies along the way. Fuck, he was such a bad friend.
He didn't even look up when someone sat down next to him. Sure, it was an odd choice, there were four other stools to choose from, two of which weren't right next to him. That was bad bathroom etiquette. But he didn't bother looking up.
“Oh,” Sam frowned, sitting down at the table and Dean grimaced away. The physical closeness suddenly put this in the realms of chick flick moments and that felt instantly uncomfortable. Like this held weight, like this conversation was gonna be important. “Are you asking for permission?”
Dean took another sip. "Yeah, I do, and it's dumb." He shrugged, looking back out the window and seeing Garth sitting in the car, tapping out some form of rhythm on the steering wheel. "Don't worry about me. Go kill some vampires, and come back alive. That's all I need."
His instinct was to shove the dish away, fling it against the wall and shatter it, destroy the summoning. But he knew it was too late. An angel was on its way and no amount of domestic vandalism would halt that.
They smiled, the softness in her tone coming through and reassuring them a little, though not a lot. “We’re still kicking, just about.” Dean told her.
Cas didn’t know if their input or the the amount of time spent in the last hour meditating was more helpful, but now he was dressed, freshly showered, and ready to go on this date. His first ever date. He stood in front of the mirror for a minute longer, and finally allowed himself to think about what he’d been smothering down all afternoon.
She smiled patronisingly. "Don't be so hard on yourself. It's been a long, hard day. Your boyfriend's getting the boot from heaven and you've got to put up with his sorry arse being around." She shrugged. "Until I kill him, of course."
Cas charged, ready to slice for the neck, decapitation. He reached for the bottle of cleaning fluid in his pocket, going for the splash'n'slash, as Dean had once named it, but once again found his journey obstructed. Within a second he was pulled back, held tight by a second Leviathan that he cursed himself for not being able to notice.
He snapped the box shut and pulled out a drawer from him locker, shoving it deep at the back, wedging it in place with a book. It could stay there as long as he wanted it to. The future was vague and unknown, but right now he knew what he wanted. He pushed the drawer shut and left the room, walking the short length to Cas’s room and rapping his knuckles on the door, pushing the door open. Cas looked up from the shirt that was in his arms, white with colourful embroidery webbed across it, which Dean couldn’t figure out if it was garish or sweet.
“I doubt the job will conform to those hours.” Cas mused, and Dean felt the urge to jibe at him rise, to start the back and forth they were so well practised in. Instead, he let the rebuttal slide, smiling at him.
“I would like to.” He announced, holding the duffel against his chest. “Thank you for the coffee, Charlie.” He said as he left the room.
Livvie was watching horrified from a distance. She had never meant for this. She had never meant to hurt Dean.
“Yeah. Except, he might get hit by a bus tomorrow when he’s out on a beer run, so better keep him in the bunker. It’s safe here.” She looked around. “Except, he might be sitting somewhere minding his own business, and a book shelf might-”
"It's like this hunter I knew, Tamara. One of the best, once she got into it. She hunted with her husband, but he died."
"Nothing's gonna happen tonight, I can see that much." Was the reply. "And you really need a decent night's sleep."
"Thought angels didn't have a sex drive." Dean commented. "Aren't you lot all smooth down there, like ken dolls."
He could feel the alcohol still warm in his chest, lingering, in his ribs with each breath… his breath stuttered like his words.
"But we don't have a choice. Channel your boredom into Cas, or something." Sam shrugged, keeping an eye on Dean, who looked away with a scoff. "Unless this is about something else."
It was a few hours later that Cas was disturbed. He’d taken to the conservatory, cool sunlight streaming through the now cleaned windows. Out of the window he could see the hill side fall below, the rocky outlook, and farmland as far as the eye can see. It was peaceful, and for a while he’d stood and watched the cattle grazing a mile away.
"I must know nothing!" Dean stubbornly contradicted. "You didn't just leave when you left! You left way before that; you left when you went to Crowley. You left when you lied to us and when you spied on us! Elvis has left the building!"
"I don't care about your apologies, Cas," She fumed, carding her fingers through her hair in frustration, but stopping when she got tangled. "You couldn't have brushed? Seriously?"
Dean was quiet, and Cas stopped studying his hands to look at him again. He was beautiful, jaw set and firm, and Cas ached to run a fingertip along it. This was hard for Dean, he knew. That was why the last few weeks had been so frustrating, to know that Dean was processing, was working through things and was in pain, and Cas couldn’t figure out how to help. Had only responded by becoming angry himself, turning that frustration outwards. They could be a trainwreck waiting to happen, couldn’t they?
He’d gone years not kissing Cas, and he was gonna catch up. They were gonna be fucking unbearable to be around if things went his way. And Cas didn’t seem to have any complaints, he was giving as good as he was getting. When he stroked his thumb along Dean’s groin Dean shuddered, their lips breaking apart, and then Cas cupped,
Sam pushed the covers from the bed, grabbing the mattress and taking it to the window, glancing outside.
This wasn’t what he wanted, what he needed, he suddenly knew. This stranger in front of him, so kind and pleasing, was a stranger. The thought of leaving with him, exploring his body and finding release together was repulsive, despite the still simmering arousal in his body.
Sam sighed. "Yeah, I get it." He walked over to the other side of the bed, reaching down and giving the man's shoulder a squeeze. "Hang in there, Cas."
"I know you've ignored us in the past. Or brushed us off. You didn't want to help out. You've called it quits, I get it. Wish I could do the same." Dean paused; probably wasn't great to be passive aggressive during this.
Cas could hear thumping, a distant thrum which he could almost feel. “Dean, I’m struggling to follow.”
, Dean sat as far away as possible from Cas. He wasn't even on the sofa tonight, instead at the table with Sam's laptop, his younger brother instead with Cas. And Dean focused,
She sat up, slowly, and moved back so she was resting against the headboard. "Of course. You don't recognise me." She said slowly, deliberately. Each word was measured and calculated, weighed up before she said it. It reminded him of someone, and something uneasily stirred in his chest.
"Aw, you're going for the old fashioned approach?" Zedkiel smiled. "Probably for the best if you want the forgiveness to be true." She sighed, looking at the motel room in which Dean was sitting. "Human's can be so ungrateful."
The tone was light, but Dean could hear a hint of nervousness in the words, that he was genuinely asking. “Not so many dates,” He told him. “Usually just a hook up. Or the chick has no idea who I actually am.” He sighed, looking at the inky darkness, seeing the glint of moonlight across the water. “This? One of the good ones.”
She swallowed down the lump in her throat. "Everyone seems to be paying for your mistakes, don't they?" She whispered. "People are dying because of you."
The days were slow. He used to notice time but was separate from it, could conceptualise its passing in ways to make them blink past in a flash, or slow for long enough to pace a battle. Now each second ticked along independent of his will, sometimes in a flash but usually at a plod. Somehow he liked it. It made him feel small and inconsequential, and despite everything… it was comforting. He held less weight than he used to. He could only do what he could do, such as feed the bees, compost their waste, and love Dean.
Garth, much to Dean's relief, dropped the matter, brushing the dust from his hands onto his jeans. "Well, if you're sure." He smiled. "Do you want us to grab anything on the way back? Milk? Some paint?" He glanced around the room again. "You know, my cousin's an interior decorator, I bet he could give you guys a great deal on the place."
filled with joy and hope and expectation. He had felt what was undeniably the most real, most sharpest pang of joy he had ever experienced in the entirety of his existence… he had felt Dean,
Cas had fallen asleep in the back seat, head lolling against the window, his breath fogging up the cold glass gently as he slept. Dean could see his reflection with each street light they passed, the orange glow lighting his features in the window flashed in his periphery. Cas was getting better at staying up late, but 3am in a moving vehicle was apparently pushing his limits.
“We just met her,” He reminded Dean, and he saw Charlie pout, just slightly. “She may be human but we don’t know why she’s here.”
It was only half 9 at that point, and Dean, feigning soberness, managed to buy two six packs down the street. He got his keys out, almost driving, weighing up the amount he'd drunk and the sway of his limbs, before putting them away and heading towards a park he'd seen earlier; chances are he woulda been fine, he'd driven baby in worse states, but there was little point in smashing up a usable car. He spent the remainder of the night there, drinking and being a general public nuisance.
"He usually wears a tux." Dean joked. Cas looked vaguely uncomfortable and looked down at his suit, before Dean cleared his throat, gesturing at a photo on the shelf of Bill and a younger woman. "Is that your daughter?"
Dean nodded, trying to think of all the well-founded worries. But… shit, maybe he was going soft in his old age. It smelt like freedom… and fuck, was that tempting.
Gingerly, he crawled up the wall, making his way up very carefully. He almost fell again, but held on tight, eventually scrambling onto the balcony. He could see through the window. He could see Sam against the wall, and he could see Livvie. He had a clear shot. He lifted the crossbow, aiming...
And there it was. A human being. He needed to be one, to know he could be one in this fate he’d landed in, and he needed to know Dean believed in him, that Dean believed he could exist in this world, that he was capable. Because this world, this world with Dean, meant hunting. And if he didn’t hunt, if he
Cas turned out to be pleasantly surprised by how simple the meal actually was, and allowed himself a small ounce of pride at the look of pleasure on Dean's face when he first bit into it. He was under no illusions that Sam had done the lion's share of the work, but somehow that didn't matter. He had partially contributed to that smile.
Dean woke not long after. Sam decided to wake him this time; his nightmare seemed worse than the day before. Again he called out Cas's name as he woke. However, today he almost punched Sam in the jaw for his efforts.
Castiel stiffened as he processed the information. Livvie watched as his jaw clenched, as his hands fisted at his sides.
Cas nodded, agreeing to Dean's terms, stepping to the next rail, picking up a grey top with a wide neck, a deep slit in the centre with an embroidered hem. He picked it up, holding it in front of him in the mirror. He didn't notice Dean's expression.
“There’s a lot of dangerous monsters out there.” Dean said, and she held up hands in defence, before pointing at her cheek.
Cas nodded, remembering. He hoped this wouldn't happen every night, but, he considered, this part wasn't so bad. Dean's comfort, his quiet presence, the warm pressure of Dean's hand. This, he didn't mind so much.
He could hear Cas hum in thought for a second, the room was so quiet, in spite of their breathing, Sam rattling around downstairs, and the owl outside. "Probably the tablets that Moses brought down from Mount Sinai, though the New International Version is an excellent translation."
Dean threw his head back and laughed, and Cas knew the calculated risk was worth it. Sam groaned, dropping his head down on the table. “Great, that’s great guys.” His words came out muffled from behind his arms. Dean was still grinning as he moved food around the pan, and he nudged Cas with his elbow affectionately. Maybe Dean didn’t want anything more in front of Sam, but joking? This went down well. “I think I heard enough last night.”
"Cas?" Dean asked, and the angel moved round so the hunter could see him. He paid no heed to his bloodied hands as he took hold of his friend.
"Seriously?" He uttered in disbelief. "Of all the times to call, Chuck... we have been through a boatload of crap in the last two years, and now you decide to call?"
Turning off the taps he went to the shower, turning the water on and stepping in. Despite Sam's jibe, he didn't quite have the stomach for a cold shower right now, and sighed when the hot water hit him, water beating against his skin, hot and welcoming, and Dean found himself melting into it, the final chill in his bones from outside retreating under the pressure of his fingertips across his chest, rubbing the skin against the bone underneath, could feel the slight notch of an old cracked rib. And, almost reluctantly, as the water beat down on his skin and his fingertips rubbed across his chest, he moved his hand down to that which had been waiting for his attention for the last ten minutes, or for the last week.
The heat wasn't everywhere. It was somewhere. Dean glanced down at his fingers, seeing the lit match still in his hands, burnt down to where his fingers held on to it tightly.
"Libera nos, Domine. Ut Acclesiam tuam," Dean recited, nearly at the end. He could see the demons struggling now, their eyes turning black and their movements becoming more desperate. Fortunately, desperate meant careless, making them far easier to finish off. Balthazar slammed the head of a pensioner against the door frame before burning him out.
Dean couldn't help his eyebrows rising in surprise as Cas walked out of the bathroom. Towel hanging low on his hips and dropping just above his knees, he cursed his idiocy. He was going to give Cas some clothes to wear, but he didn't think of giving him a people-sized towel. Water dripped from his hair and onto his shoulders, and Dean tried not to follow it with his eyes as it travelled down his chest. Cas was clearly cold, judging from the goosebumps on his arms and the way his nipples had sharpened...
"Yeah, I'm Dean. I'm right here." He tried. He attempted to remember if he'd ever met her before, but he was coming up with nothing.
“I think I understand.” Cas said, and he could see Dean breathe a sigh of relief, tension around the shoulders easing. “But… are we…”
There were rings there too, a range of bands in different metals, some with stones, some without. He grimaced at some of them, some gothic ones that looked like dragons curved around your finger, or with pentagrams. Hell, maybe that would be good in a fight against a demon.
- don’t swear though - if they get that you know it’s weird to be asking they usually trust the process.”
Dean's pupils were blown wide in the dark, a sight that was very attractive on the man. Cas frowned at the thought, remembering basic human biology; a human's pupils dilate when aroused, similar as to how they dilate in dark lights. His own probably looked the same. There was nothing to it.
"Well," Dean nodded, and clapped a hand to Cas's shoulder, the most intimacy he could muster. "I'm glad you're okay."
Cas’s body was getting tougher though. He and Sam had sorted out a routine, training different sets of muscles each day, ending each day physically exhausted but stronger for it. Sometimes he would see Dean looking at him, watching his muscles, tracking Cas’s improvement, and judging from the look on Dean’s face Cas would assume he approved. Good. The sooner he could get out and hunt, defend himself from monsters, the better.
"She was at the bar?" Sam asked, accusation in his voice, knowing that more had happened that Dean wasn't letting on. Sam knew his brother well. "What did you do, Dean?"
