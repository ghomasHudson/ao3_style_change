“Yeah, but I’ve seen pictures where he’s orange too ma’am,” replied the weaselly one.
They got situated just fine, with a little shifting and shimmying to get cozy, and there they were finally in a proper bed. John let out an almost obscene groan as he settled and relaxed into the softness of the pillows, it felt like it had been ages since he’d seen a bed. Sherlock rolled towards him and, as was his usual move, started winding around John, wrapping him up in arms and legs and spooning into him with a small kiss to the nape of his neck.
“Come on then,” John goaded, clinging harder still as Sherlock gave a full body buck and froze in the emotional torrent.
Before they left John asked her where he could get a haircut and buy some food. If the Aerie was anything like an army base there had to be a barber and commissary of some kind. She sent him with Angus to find it while she returned to her flat. Angus led John right to what he was looking for.
The area around the warehouse has been cordoned off with crime-scene tape and a couple of technicians in blue overalls are combing the nearby shrubberies. Large, portable flood lights have been lit to combat the encroaching winter darkness.
"We´re not-" John starts, and grabs hold of the doorframe and pulls himself up. "I need to ask you some questions about the 28th of October last year."
“Hmm,” Moriarty leans back in his chair again, “the thing is, this,” Moriarty gestures with his gun between them. “It would be fine, if it was just about us. But you don’t stand in the way of merely an individual, you stand in the way of an entire organization, the full extent of which- even you with all your cleverness, will never be able to realize. Either you must be brought to rank or be pushed aside.”
Lestrade wipes a hand across his eyes and flips through the paperwork until he comes finds the latest summary. “None of the family members fit the description of “nurse” or “marine.” They’ve excluded all of the immediate family, even if they are, mostly each other’s witnesses-“
Next to him John sleeps on, oblivious to Sherlock’s trepidation.
“So, we will call you as soon as we know something,” John promises.
The bath makes Sam drowsy, and he tucks his hands under his pillow after just one story. John crams the duvet tightly around his tiny frame and sits on the edge of the bed, carding his fingers through Sam’s curls, listening to the sound of his breath petering out to an even sleep. Toby tucks himself next to the child, head on his paws.
The line goes dead, and high above him John sees Sherlock spread both his arms and then, almost casually, allows himself to fall forward.
I´d love to hear your thoughts.
John emits a huff of a laugh, he can’t help it. As if anybody could ever tell Sherlock to do anything.
“I….was arrested on  suspicion of Fenway's murder,” John says slowly.
“I insist that we be permitted to be present to be sure there is no-“
The barking gets louder and louder.
“I was taken from the Yard by two people posing as police constables, the woman who brought you here and another man. I haven’t seen him yet.”
“She was obviously distraught,” Anderson reasons, his grin growing by the second. “Look, the receipt proves that she’s the one who paid for them.”  He shows them the receipt in a plastic evidence bag.  Sherlock snatches it out of his hands and peers at it. John can read Ann Lewis’ name scribbled on the bottom of the receipt.
Sam says, studying his collecting with obvious enthusiasm.
“John. The salute, John.”
“No, I’m coming up.”
It is somehow worse for Joseph Braithsworth. The business stocks plummet as shareholders hurry to wash their hands of any connections to Braithsworth. None of the employees show up for work that day, or the days following. His wife and daughter flee to France as soon as they are able, refusing to answer any of the calls from the slew of lawyers hot on their tails. Mrs. Braithsworth only gets through the day with heavy medication, both in prescription and liquid form, while the daughter dyes her hair black and cuts it short. Armed with a pair of heavy rimmed glasses and a fake I.D she boards the train to Berlin. She calls her stepbrother, but he refuses to answer the phone. In fact, he´s not answered it since his recent television debut. It’s perhaps better this way, she thinks. Now they are both free of him and can move on.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course." John slides into his seat by the table "You know me."
“I am navigating the narrow and slippery path of patient confidentiality,” she starts, so low that John actually has press himself closer to Sherlock’s side to hear her.
Wordlessly, Sally flickers through her papers, and then pulls out a paper, handing it to Lestrade.
“You might as well jump right to it,” Sherlock’s voice hums in his ear, “he’s here to play a game, no reason to go easy on him.”
“What’s your name, constable?”
Sherlock takes the seventeen steps up to 221B, two at a time, and completely ignores Mrs. Hudson’s worried “Is everything all right, dear? Where is John?” as he passes. He can’t be bothered to alleviate Mrs. Hudson’s worries. (She’ll just demand that he do what he intends to do, and there’s no time to deal with unnecessary details of explaining them to her.)
“Sure,” Lestrade says. There’s a tension behind the words that John can’t identify and would rather not think about.
Along with the usual warnings found in the tags, I feel it necessary to include an additional warning for tooth-rooting fluff and sweetness. (However, if you take this chapter to your dentist, you are on your own.)
“Right,” Sherlock replies. “Give me your phone.”
Hestia waits while he packs, her fingers never leaving her Blackberry.
“My former husband was an Alpha,” Mrs. Hudson says. John can’t hide his surprise fast enough to stop it from reaching his face. He’s only heard passing mention of the former Mr. Hudson, that Sherlock helped ensure he was convicted and executed in Florida.
“Certainly,” Lestrade promises and prays that Sally will arrive soon so that he can order her to fetch the beverages.
The defense attorney puts on her best smile, but there is real venom behind it. She snaps her document case with a loud snap.
“She obviously recognized the killer and ran."
“Nothing,” John replies, hiding his smile in his fist as he turns to watch the street pass by. He places a hand on Sherlock’s knee, not to still the movement, but simply because he can.
His scent, nicotine, asphalt, stale London dust, grime, and sweat, the sharp sting of chemicals- formaldehyde, the sharp, wet wool from his ridiculous coat, the scratchy fabric of his scarf against his chin. Perfect.
He drags his body upwards and with each passing step his senses are assaulting him with information on Sherlock. The heady scent of his Alpha, the lingering smell of London after a rainstorm, of the winter smog curling through dark streets and acrid taste of the Thames and formaldehyde. Sherlock, of course, will already have deduced that it is John who is arriving simply be the tread of his shoes. The movement in the flat upstairs has stopped and the sound of his heartbeat is suddenly in synch with the beat from the person upstairs.
John signs,
“You saw the room,” Annabell Lewis says softly.  “I’m surprised we even managed to get the door open with all that tape.”
“The Game is on again, John!” Then he winks and scurries off to his room.
“As for Doctor Fenway’s reasons to include Mr. Reese into this particular academic publication, you would best ask Mr. Reese,” John answers evenly. He scrubs his hands over his face and releases an explosive sigh. “Mr. Reese thought that….” But he doesn’t get to finish before Anderson suddenly slams his hands into the table and exclaims gleefully.
Neither of his secretaries is present and the three interns are nowhere to be seen either. The office is dark.
During all this time Sherlock has not been able to figure out how to categorize and appropriately deal with these unnecessary feelings for John.
“That’s a very….unusual way for a woman to commit suicide,” John murmurs. He’s only seen similar set up in prison cells where there were no available hooks in the ceilings. He wonders why Lestrade didn’t think it odd when he looked into the case? John would have seen it immediately.
If Mary is offended by the question she hides it with another broad smile, “I met Mrs. Hudson during her convalesce, you see, I’m an I’m a nurse at The Princess Grace Hospital up at Nottingham Place. I had just moved to London and was still looking for a place to stay and we got talking and…”
Sherlock’s thumb stops. There’s a picture of himself and Sam, Sam upon his shoulders, his hands in Sherlock’s hair as they watch the otters. The next one is also of them together, Sam’s hand firmly in his as they walk along the enclosure of the lemurs, as they pause at the railing to watch the meerkats. There are almost twenty pictures, most of them capturing them from behind, though there’s a glimpse of the corner of his smile, of the amazement in Sam’s eyes.
“This isn’t about Isidora Nash’s murder,” Sherlock says, “it’s about catching the man responsible for the murder of husband.”
“Or,” Glen Reese adds quickly, probably sensing his hesitation “some place else, if that makes you more comfortable. I’ve read that some Omegas feel uncomfortable in the homes of other Alphas.”
“Call me on my cell if there’s anything important,” Lestrade mumbles in an effort to make it appear that he is still in control of what happens in his own office. Yu Kosaki bows again, and then hurries out.
His head is throbbing and his palms are sleek with sweat, no matter how many times he tries to wipe them on his pants. He can´t remember ever feeling this uncomfortable, this aroused. His face and ears are crimson. His stomach is tying and untying itself in knots. For years he´d wondered why his lab-partner´s cleavage did not arouse him and now he´s so hard it´s painful and embarrassing.
Sherlock frowns as the unbidden image of Dregs appearing in front of him, tall and sneering, and his muscular arms folded over his ridiculous t-shirt. “It means that little Doctor Watson here is the live in houseboy, a servant, of Sherlock Holmes.”  Dregs leers at John and even in his memory Sherlock feels an overwhelming desire to protect and to claim him.
John wakes to a rush of data overwhelming his senses and sending his mind awhirl. The smell of the bed sheets, sweet and tart with the slight hint of sex and sweat. The sharp bite of cold air against his cheek, the sound of the traffic on the street, telling him it is mid morning. The inexplicable silence of an empty flat.
John is always careful to avoid touching Sherlock more than necessary or to intrude upon his personal space. Not that Sherlock is as generous with his own regard for John´s personal space. He even steals his laptop and cellphones and shows no remorse in reading John´s text messages or emails.
John opens his eyes, and rubs sleep and grit away with the back of his hands. He blinks the world into clarity and crawls out of the car. It’s almost dark outside; the kind of deep, dark, blue you get in the Highlands. He stretches, every joint aching as they pop into place.
“Are you telling me you can’t kill that website?”
The room is silent for a heartbeat. Edward seems to recover some of his earlier confidence. His lips are curled in a mockery of a smile and there’s an angry shade of red creeping along his neck. Sally notices the sudden change in demeanour. Sally’s posture suddenly tense, mirroring Edward’s.
Lestrade opens the door, and after a moment of internal debate, Sherlock follows, hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched almost to his ears. The crowd follows them down the corridor, other doors opening as they pass, curious onlookers peering at the odd procession. Detective Inspector Lestrade’s quick, determined strides, Sherlock’s shuffled gait, John following them, hands in his pocket and the hairs on the back of his neck prickling.
“That’d he’d wait here for you to return?”Lestrade says, struggling to make sense of Sherlock’s logic.
“Good morning,” Moriarty says brightly, “tea?”
Sherlock’s features comes alight in a way it only does when John is asking Sherlock to demonstrate how he, (and he alone), figured it all out while the so-called professionals were floundering about.
He clasps his hands at the small of his back. If Marlow doesn’t grant them the search warrant, Lestrade isn’t sure what they will do. He knows they’ve got diddly squat and that they have exhausted all the other avenues. He tries to shake away the mental image of Sherlock standing, calmly, in front of the white board. A murder group, conspiracy, triple murder. A case gift-wrapped for Sherlock Holmes and yet the detective seemed so… docile in the face of their lack of progress. Usually he´d be marching around Lestrade´s office, chastising their idiocy.
“You don’t have to-”
“I wish I could be of more help, detective inspector,” Mrs. Hudson places a plate of biscuits on the table and nudges them towards him. “But I can’t tell you anything new.”
John always seems to have an abundance of female associates he tries to court. Not unsurprising.  John is a man in is prime, with a steady and (should he chose to abandon his life as a crime solving blogger) respectable occupation. There’s previous spouses, children, or any strings to anybody or any place. Sherlock can readily recognize other attractive qualities in John. He’s steadfast and loyal, he’s brave and does not fear confrontation, even a possibly explosive one. That he is still unattached, Sherlock realizes, is something of an anomaly.
“It’s the original crime scene,” Molly says, “it’s been almost ten years, but maybe it’s worth checking out? Get a feel for the scene? That’s something you do, right? Honestly, I could do with an excuse to get out of this lab.” There’s a nervous chuckle attached to the end of her sentence as if Molly’s unsure of how welcomed her presence would be.
“I’m preparing turkey for dinner, and a fruitcake for dessert. Mycroft and Mrs. Kettle is coming and so must you.”
John groggily wipes sleep from his eyes, fumbles for his mobile while Sam tries to remove the duvet from his feet. He swipes the phone awake and with a stifled groan realizes that it’s barely past five a.m.
John feels a sudden hammering in his chest and jerks to look at her and sees the unease reflected in her sharp, grey eyes.
All accolades goes to my beta CowMow for this quick update, my beta is an absolute brick (which I have been told is a genuine British expression).
What would happen then?
“That’s good,” John says, not only glad to cleared for the suspicion of murder.
John moves to the door and presses his ear to the narrow slit between the door and the floor. They are still talking and he’s not able to disguising any words, but he can hear the angry crescendo and then the sound of something crashing to the floor, probably a chair.
It’s two weeks until he’ll be sifting sand between his toes and watching the constellation of freckles appear on Molly’s naked back. It’s seven months until the anniversary and he has to figure out how to keep Simon Whitewell and John Watson safe.
Well, Molly’s part he understands. Sherlock would have needed somebody he trusted to mock up an autopsy report and to procure a fake weight for the coffin. And Lestrade, allright, somebody had needed to write the police report and the following inquest. Sherlock had also needed somebody to collect his reports and arrest the participants of Moriarty’s game.
“Any words on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson?”
And then. “Wonderful. We'll take the case.” Sherlock declares and vaults himself out of his chair. He vanishes into his room and emerges two seconds later. "Come along, John!"
Let me go! I need to get back to-
“Yeah,” the other woman says, tossing her brown hair over her shoulder, “so, who do we have to thank for takin’ care of Nash?”
Sometimes, Sally  couldn't help but feel that she and Lestrade had been working on two very different angles. She believed that this was a random act of killing and that Glen Reese had been at the wrong place at the wrong time.
After Sam is settled, John finds Sherlock lounging in the living room, draped over the sofa, a few buttons at the collar unbuttoned, giving John a delicious view of the long expanse of his throat. John swallows. It’s an enjoyable sight, but he thinks that now, with Sam settled in for sleep, the apartment calm and sheltered from the storm, if only temporary, now’s the time to take the first few steps into the minefield.
“And did this argument escalate to a physical confrontation?”
The news anchor gives his summary of the year in a monotonous drum, perhaps in an attempt to make the audience too bored to pay attention to the statistics. The violent crime rate is up, the unemployment rate is still climbing, the rivulets of the banking scandal are still felt in the fiscal sections and public trust in the police and civil servants are at a record low.
The rest of the morning rolls slowly by. John finishes reading the newspaper and his cup of tea. He makes himself a new cup of tea, he watches an old episode of Top Gear and QI, because there is always an old episode of Top Gear or QI on the telly, he makes sure that his mobile is fully charged and that the volume is on.
“Yes?” she says in a slightly hesitant tone.
“Yeah, yeah, sorry”  John says, “what about the fingerprints?”
“Bloody hell, I thought there…” John combs a hand through his hair, struggling to cling to his last shreds of restraint, “you were there, in the office- you killed him?”
The response comes a predictable 5.6 minutes later.
“To you, maybe."
John stands, dabbing his forehead with the sleeve of his shirt. He detests this feeling of helplessness. He’s a doctor, he’s a soldier, for god’s sake, he should be able to do something more.
Neurotransmitters gone wrong, a temporary chemical defect of dopamine, oxytocin and vasopressin.
Does Sherlock know that John knows that he is in love with him? And if Sherlock knows that John knows he is in love with him, how can he possibly maintain silence on the matter?
John knows the past three years are etched in the line of his skin, the slight graying of his hair at his temple and nine pounds he’s never managed to regain. But Sherlock looks unchanged, as if the past three years didn’t happen to him. Maybe a bit paler, his hair is longer, falling into his eyes. He’s dressed in the same great cloak, collar turned up. His hair is the same cleverly styled mess of curls and his eyes piercing as he regards John. Nothing in Sherlock’s gaze has changed either and John thinks how unfair it is. How Sherlock can look at him and give him that secret smile as if they’ve just returned from solving a case down at the Met and Sherlock has beaten him back home.
"I think there´s more to me than this," he says into his dinner.
John has sent a couple of texts to DI Lestrade asking if he can talk to him. He feels more comfortable giving his statement to DI Lestrade and not DI Dregs, because there is a niggling part of his mind that tells him that he doesn’t want to be in a small interrogation room with the latter.
He clears his throat.
However, it does not explain why he is beset with the memories of unraveling John, the feeling of his skin against his. He lifts his hand, lets the tip of his fingers carefully shape the curve of John’s jaw, along his cheek until they brush against the soft strands of his hair. He feels the pace of his own heart quicken.
“But Fenway diagnosed her with depression and anxiety,” Molly says, “and, the room was locked. From the inside. Both keys found under all a magazine. The police had to break the door down to get inside.”
Sherlock lifts a shoulder carelessly and slinks over to the row of filing cabinets, turning his back and his attention away from the rest of the forensic team. John watches him tip his head back and study the small display of pictures and diplomas that cover the wall above the cabinets.  John has read them hundreds of times, honorary doctorates and prestigious awards, the entire scholarly career of Doctor Fenway.  He’s suddenly acutely aware of how long and slender Sherlock’s neck is and the way his Adam’s apple slowly rises and falls, and he has to force his gaze away to stop himself from going over and doing something completely and utterly insane, like licking that pale expanse of skin.
“You’re losing your touch if that’s what you’re taking stabs at Sherlock. Irene is still home and Molly has had a lull in patients during the seasonal change, you’re lucky I’m not walking around with more than just this on me.” She laughed tugging her collar further down to proudly reveal a rather impressive line of marks, much loved indeed. John had nearly forgotten that she had both Irene and Molly in her bed.
“You were summoned here as well?” rumbled a voice nearby, pulling John from his thoughts to see Sherlock plopping himself down on the bench next to him. The man was in completely different, clean, attire but he looked rather ruffled, hair fluffed as though he’d been blown dry by a leaf blower with some attempt to tame the curls. John suppressed a small snort of laughter as his eyes landed on the sulky face under the fluff of hair.
John quickly straightened up the bed, tossing the bondage items out of sight for the time being. He threw on a pair of pajama pants and grabbed Sherlock’s blue dressing gown off the hook. John picked up the bottle of water he had set aside on the side table just in case Sherlock had needed it afterwards, and stepped out into the hall where the other door to the toilet was. He tested the handle and found that Sherlock hadn’t locked it. He rapped on it lightly as he opened it.
“Of course, he’s your brother! Don’t tell me you don’t exchange gifts with your family on Christmas I won’t believe it.”
“Who else would be keeping them alive?” Sherlock replied with his own question
“Sir, your clothes.” A voice interrupted his thoughts; one of Mycroft’s people was standing at his side, a bag of clothes held towards him.
“That was its original function ages ago. The news was called out there back in the dark ages, I can guarantee singing was included as well.” Sherlock said.
“I haven’t left the flat,” Sherlock grunted as he bent back unselfconsciously, fingers knitted together far above his head.
The boy finally arrived in a rush, buzzing with a nervous energy, and John wondered if he’d been told about the hatchling at all other than, ‘you have been picked’. He wore a white robe that looked rather slung on, silver threaded collar askew, drawstrings undone, he was panting as he approached them, followed by a man who looked about in his early thirties and also nervous.
“Any time after 10am,” Sherlock replied.
“No.” Sherlock snapped. “Accidentally set fire to the butchery about a year ago, and there was a time long before that with Henry’s predecessor,” Sherlock mumbled sulkily.
A mouth formed again on Sherlock’s top facing towards Mycroft. “Sod off, Mycroft,” it said grumpily. A finger of a tentacle shot out from Mycroft’s sleeve and viciously stabbed into Sherlock’s mass.
John looked to Lestrade when he heard the Master huff out a sigh, “You might as well go after him, god knows maybe you can keep him from running around and getting himself killed,” Lestrade said tiredly.
The boy led them out across the landing field, towards the training grounds, through the now familiar halls of the school to the library. John wondered what on earth Lestrade could need them for there, but kept quiet as they entered the warm building and passed Jessamy and Garet with their dragons at the front desk. The pair watched with matching worried frowns as Sherlock and John nearly jogged past after the boy, heading for one of the study rooms nearby.
“You would like to do more, wouldn’t you?” Sherlock asked quietly as they snuggled one evening. It took John a moment to realize what ‘more’ meant.
“I-- I hid it… In Hyperion’s pit,” He pointed in Hyperion’s direction. “Threw it in one of the flower pots for now.”
“Go get Hyperion already,” Sherlock commanded at John from his high perch atop Bellamy’s head.
“Where are you? We need you to tell us where you are first.” He asked the panicked woman gently.
“Oh, I saw him come up here while we were settling that hatchling, don’t know where he went after that though. He’s kind of flighty like that,” Mike said, in regards to Sherlock’s whereabouts.
“Yes, Master Stapleton,” Lestrade said, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose. “I remember.”
John continued to stew in those sorts of thoughts, swirling them together with horrible ideas of what Jim might do to Sherlock and just letting those fuel the rising urge to rescue and protect him. A voice came across the headset, “I have a location.” and in that moment John looked out the window into the darkness and wanted to leap and come crashing down on top of Jim, death from the fall be damned. But of course that would help no one so John stayed put, fingers clenching into fists over and over against his knees as he looked down into the pitch black countryside. Of course this would happen during a new moon, no white pale light illuminated the ground below, only the red and yellow little lights from cars and street lamps. John wished he had whatever night vision the pilot was using.
"Took you long enough. What was that about? Did he want your number?" Mike teases with an arched brow as he liberates the drinks from John´s hands.
*I require access to the records of Glen and Adrian Reese as well. SH*
“Sherlock?” John inquires gently and Sherlock looks up.  His gaze catches John’s and John imagines, if only for a second, that there’s a hint of sadness in his eyes.  Then again, John has been known to imagine quite a number of things recently.
He smiles disarmingly at John and finally lets go of John´s shirt. He shrugs lackadaisically, but the movement is stiff and sharp, as if it is with great reluctance he let John free.
“There’s something sticky around his mouth, and he’s had some facial hairs pulled. I’m going to take a swab for sampling, but I’d guess he was gagged with tape or something,” Molly says and Lestrade clears his throat a couple of times before he finds his voice.
Is he trying to tell Lestrade that he anticipated these murders? Or is this is a subtle way of telling him that he is, in fact, behind it all?
“Well,” Moriarty says, “with John’s help, you’ve surely figured it out. If not, I’m going to be disappointed.”
“Why?” comes the instant and lofty response and then John hears the sound of the front door slamming shut.
“No, we’re not lost, stupid.”
He´s not like any Alphas John has ever meet before. Then again, Sherlock isn´t like anyone John has ever met before. The thing is, John quickly realizes, is that Sherlock is interesting. He´s charming. (And handsome). He´ll happily steamrolls over social conventions and established norms. He´s funny.
The initial investigation had discovered that several police officers were involved in bribes, leaking information, stealing property during raids, fabricating evidence, illegal phone hacking, surveillance and relations with organized crimes.  Internal Affairs had soon enforced severe changes while they conducted their investigation.  Officers had been demoted, suspended or reassigned to different counties. (Though why Anderson had been moved to the tiny village of Low Row in Yorkshire was anybody’s guess.) Even Lestrade was suspended for a week while the inquest went over his records with a fine toothcomb. Thankfully, he was soon back behind his desk, acting like nothing had happened.
John signs,
Christ, how it all made sense now.
The door closes behind him and Sherlock finds himself in a sleek, modern corridor decorated with a few framed aquarelles of flowers. He shrugs out of his coat and hangs it next to one of John’s. He lets his fingers brush over the green duffle coat he’d first seen Sam in. It looks tiny, next to his Belstaff.
John wraps his fingers around the cup, lets the heat from it seep into his stiff fingers and tries very hard not to think about how yesterday it was Mrs. Gillespie who served him his morning tea. He wonders what sort of story was cooked up to explain his absence.
“Thank you,” John answers, and then turns to Mrs. Hudson who is barely able to contain her curiosity behind proper British manners.
“Well,” he snaps, “is it him?”
Cheers to all of you who support me and stick with this story.
There’s two figures on the top of St. Barts. It’s impossible not to recognize Sherlock’s great coat, flapping in the wind as Sherlock balances precariously on the edge, circling the other man as if he’s the prey.
They spend a comfortable half an hour together working through the puzzle, until John disappears and comes back with a skeletal anatomy model that makes Sam abandon the smart tablet in favour of insisting John tell him name of all the bones in the body. John struggles through most of them, as his sign language course hadn't included instructions for the Latin names of all the bones in the human hand.
He could all too easily imagine that a threat against him would make Sherlock-
“Good,” he rises, signalling the end of this conversation. Burrell does the same, shuffling his feet as he gathers his coat.
“You’ve got to be joking,” John tries one of his regular, careless grins, but it quickly loses its shape. He huffs a frustrated laugh and spreads his hands helplessly. “Fine, fine.”
John’s last coherent thought is, I’m not going to be late for tea.
Sherlock flexes his hands, feeling small specks of glass digging into the rough skin of his palm.
“ And she said they had to force the door open?”
Sam signs with his free hand and points at the ridiculously large fir tree standing in the living room. The star at the top is touching the ceiling. It’s decorated with lights, tinsel and Christmas ornaments in different shapes and colours. Candy canes. Stars. Gilded pinecones and woodland creatures. It’s the most wonderful thing John has ever seen.
“Couldn’t Mrs. Hudson do it?”
“He’s always buying the child toys,” Mrs. Kettle chides good naturally as she places a steaming cup and a plate of chicken and rice in front of him. For the first time, John realizes that he’s absolutely famished.
John wets his lips and balls his hands into fists, digging his nails into his palms until it hurts.
“You broke your arm when you fell and it´s in a cast. I´ll turn the lights off,” a voice says, and in the fuzzy recesses of his mind he recognizes it, annoyingly, as belonging to Mycroft.
“What!” He hisses. “Do you mean?”
John wants to tell Sherlock that it’s alright, “That it’s fine, I’m fine.” It’s not really true though and John knows that Sherlock is a genius and he’ll deduce that John is lying, like he deduces hundreds of big and small things about John every day.
Sherlock ignores the bard.
He turns with a grim sigh and sees Sherlock standing there, biting down on his fist. His shoulders are shaking.
, Sam says promptly.
The glue on the tape was from a mass-produced tape that you could buy in almost any store in London. The pole had been made from English oak, the most common tree species in the United Kingdom. The last surveillance footage shows Glen Reese embarking the train in Bristol, heading to London. He had not been seen since. Despite widespread media coverage, no witnesses came forth. The rest of Glen Reese’s body was never recovered.
“I’m sorry you had to see that,” he said from behind his hand before he sat forward and started the jeep.
“Sorry, don’t know why I did that,” he apologized, Sherlock didn’t reply just continuing on with his meal.
“But, John,” Sherlock started trying to think of a way to get his life mate to not be distant with him. Sherlock reached out an appendage, devolved down in detail from a hand, to touch John’s clothed arm.
Another yawn interrupted any response John had to that and Sherlock’s face reappeared in front of him with an arched eyebrow. “Sorry, love, just it's been such a long night,” John felt that slight blush rising again, here Sherlock was being all lovey and John was nodding off. The eyebrow went down though and Sherlock’s face softened again into a small smile.
John heard Sherlock’s door to the bathroom slide and the shower turn on. John sighed, turning and putting his head against the bathroom door. “Fine, but we do need to actually talk sometime.” The sound of the shower running was his only reply.
“I like it Sherlock, it’s all very nice,” John reassured him again accepting the food. Inside was a steaming serving of roast beef with accompanying yorkshire pudding, gravy, peas, and carrots, it smelled heavenly and the container warmed his hands through his gloves.
All of it was intense, as slow and calm as it all was, just the heavy push and pull of their hips building the orgasm up and sluggishly taking it away from John like waves rising and falling on the beach, until Sherlock took control and decided to finish. He drew one of his arms away, tracing long webbed fingers over John’s shoulder and the gnarled scar there. With a particularly sinful smirk he drew away and licked his fingers. John could only watch, out of his mind on the steady, heady pleasure, mesmerized as Sherlock’s tongue traced the webbing between his first two fingers with a teasing glint in his eye.
“Are you certain you don’t need to go to a hospital?” one of the paramedics asked as Sherlock carefully slid out with his cargo of John held above him.
“You’ve got a couple years still,” John replied, sitting nearby on the worn in sofa.
“Sherlock, what the hell are you doing here?” John asked, hearing Hyperion snort awake behind him accompanied by a sudden burst of curiosity along the bond.
“A white Nordic?” John said, watching the huge dragon glide circles around the Aerie a crate of packages tucked up against its belly.
“Well hello, you’re the one who scratched up my flatmate, huh?” John looked down at the pale belly presented and the big eyes staring up at him as she held her tail in her balled-up posture.
“Panama is halfway across the world from here,” John pointed out.
The therapist set about helping him right away, and didn’t seem at all perturbed by the dragon occasionally nudging at her back now and then as John grunted in pain. She removed the sling and started him with some basic stretches, laying him down on the mat and helping him get his shoulder moving and trying to regain his range of motion. Through the whole session John felt concerned pangs coming across the bond, and he could see Hyperion’s head hovering out of the corner of his eye.
“That didn’t feel very long,” John commented as Sherlock shucked out of his clothes, John mirroring him as he talked, trying to ignore the fact that he was once again naked next to Sherlock. “Are you sure it’s already morning?” The aquarium being completely underground with no windows did throw off John’s sense of time the first couple days he had worked there, he was willing to admit.
“We’ll do that,” John said for him.
“Where is he?” John called back eye’s still staring at the ground below, he couldn’t look away now, he felt like if he did he’d be sick, because the ground rushing by made his head spin.
“Fine we were still human… God I’m just glad it’s all over, never want to set foot in water ever again.” John said, watching as the dazed agents helped each other up and began regaining their bearings, looking for their missing equipment.
“What? I’m the head of maintenance and supply, keep the place clean, well stocked, and fed,” his voice squeaked a bit as he made his case to his fellow Masters. John snorted lightly, trying not to laugh at his superiors.
“Its festive, you know, fresh snow and all, couldn’t have been a more Christmassy evening,” John said giving Sherlock a playful nudge.
“Jesus, Sherlock, Sally’s going to have your hide if you keep trying shit like this,” one said in a slightly nasal voice.
. And maybe that was why Sherlock was hurrying them along, the winds were getting chillier and the temperature was dropping further the later it got, maybe he’d managed to expertly read Hyperion’s body language and deduce that he needed to find more suitably heated cover soon. If that was the case John silently thanked Sherlock for it.
Bellamy reached for him, her movements in slow motion as she put a taloned paw around John, allowing him plenty of warning about what she was doing, and she gently picked him up and placed him in the saddle. John’s heart gave a leap in his chest, and not a good one, when he realized Sherlock had scooted back and John was well and truly in the saddle proper this time. Sherlock set about clipping John in, attaching cables to John’s belt and then his own.
“Well… Those wounds will handicap him, Greg,” she finally said “They are healing, but they’re both deep and are going to scar pretty badly.”
“I’m okay, sir,” she replied, getting up and dusting off what appeared to be a uniform. All the children were wearing them, loose sand-colored pants with lots of pockets and blue shirts with the Aerie’s logo on the back.They all had bookbags with them. The ones who had moved away looked at the ground guiltily.
“John, could you get him down on his side again? I would like to look at his hip first.” Molly asked politely, looking up at Hyperion.
John had humorously surmised that Sherlock had gotten his own equally intense stare from watching the dragons do it, which only served to befuddle Sherlock at the time by responding, ‘this is my face’. The dragon’s judgmental gaze sent a shiver up John’s spine for very different reasons than Sherlock’s. The dragon’s triggered a small adrenaline shiver from being the prime focus of a dangerous predator that in ancient times could have easily treated him as prey. Sherlock’s made John want to climb the other rider like a tree.
“Well, humans need company from each other too, I don’t mind being around to talk with, get you out of that big head of yours,” John said. “Like you’ve told me multiple times, we’re sort of stuck together,” Much as he didn’t want to, he pulled back, Sherlock clung on for a second more before finally letting John go. Sherlock didn’t meet his eyes right away, looking like he’d overdone it on the hug, he’d been out of his shell for a little too long and needed to put that protective mask back on. “So, you think this kidnapper, bomber, person is going to come back?” he asked in an attempt to spare Sherlock the embarrassment and break the atmosphere of vulnerability.
“We’re going to need to walk,” He said looking at the wing over the gash. Flight wasn’t an option. That injury would probably need to be patched before the wing would even begin to be usable again.
“The case, you could have left it in the alley for Dimmock,” John prompted, nodding to the slimy mess across from Sherlock.
“Sorry there’s so much steak in today’s food,” Sally apologized, opening her box, which contained the same thing as his only with maybe a little more of the veg on the side and a slice of some kind of red berry cheesecake. “There’s usually a bit more variety through the day, but the kitchen had some extra dragon meat yesterday, so it’s a meat day today.” John stopped eating the moment she mentioned dragons in relation to food, looking up at her with concern plain on his face.
“For the love of god don’t do anything to get the Aerie blown up,” Lestrade replied.
“So where’s this Carl kid then? Maybe we could ask him?” John asked.
“He didn’t help much when we were flying here,” John murmured.
“Anyway. Our division of the Aerie covers five halls, the numeral is just the hall number, this is the second hall of the five, ten pits on each hall, the rooms come in pairs, A and B. For example, Hyperion here is in 2-21a, your flatmate, that’d be Sherlock, has 2-21b,” Lestrade glanced through the aforementioned door, “and it looks like he’s out at the moment.” He sighed with the same air as someone who has had to go find a hiding child far too many times.
“It would be good for your shoulder,” Sherlock had reasoned, and John was sure that it would, his therapist had mentioned it before as an option to help him regain some flexibility and range of motion, but the ever growing part of his brain that had supplied images of Sherlock on his knees sucking him didn’t need more fuel for those sorts of fantasies. And so he declined for the time being. That didn’t stop Sherlock from practicing in the middle of their sitting room, however.
“Let me stop you right there,” John interrupted. “I wasn’t forced to be with you at the aquarium. If I had wanted to I could have completely avoided you and stayed in other areas of the building. Hell, I probably could have turned into a fish in one of the other tanks, too. I chose to stay near you. I enjoy being with you, and if all the spectacular snogging and shagging we’ve been doing hasn’t helped reinforce that in that thick skull of yours I’m not sure what will.”
“Hm?”
“Er, erm, w-what if we fall?” John stuttered, lurching up a bit onto his knees, following the man.
“And that roundabout of houses Mycroft kidnapped me to?”
The pair continued on the trek to the training grounds, traversing the landing field where the day appeared to be going by slowly with not much traffic at the time they crossed. There were more people out on the training grounds when they got there. John spotted a group of fledgelings grouped together with their dragons practicing hopping maneuvers; not quite ready to fly but strong enough to flutter a bit. They were building even more strength into their limbs by carrying their first saddles and the weight of their young riders. Elsewhere in the near vicinity of the massive gateway that lead out of the Aerie were other larger dragons exercising with their riders.
John turned the lights in the crate completely off and felt his way back to his blankets. He managed to slip out of his shoes and slid between the blankets, pressing himself up against his dragon’s warm neck. The faint glow of the landing field’s lights seeped around the corner of the doorway and through the line of windows, so he was not in the complete pitch black. John lay there for a moment just breathing steadily, finally, completely relaxing after the stressful day. As he relaxed, he noticed the gentle waves from Hyperion’s mind pushing happy feelings at him. The feeling of being home for the first time in months and months, the joy of smelling the England air again and letting that cool humidity fill his nostrils. That was accompanied by one of the strangest feelings he had yet to get from Hyperion’s mind, the feeling of the dampness aiding in the shedding of his scales, a light skin crawling sensation skittering across John’s neck and back.
“This is yours?” John said dumbly, watching the long neck bow to nose at Sherlock’s outstretched palm.
John had trouble focusing on any one thing as he took in the sight. In the area beyond sat aquarium tanks, large ones, all emitting their calm blue light, all occupied and surrounded by scaffolding. In front of him on the ground, lay a pile of discarded black clothes and weapons. Near that on the floor lay a weakly twitching large silver fish, its mouth and gills flexing as it suffocated. Ascending one tank’s black metal scaffolding was one of Jim’s brutes, another large silver fish slung over his shoulder, John watched as he simply tossed the fish into the water. Jim herself was sitting near the base of one of the biggest tanks, Sebbie seated across from her, slowly peeling the scarf away from her bloodied face followed by her coat and shirt till she sat half nude before Jim.
“Hey!” John protested the manhandling just as Sherlock let out an aborted “Bell!”
“But Hyperion can’t fly…”
“I was only telling him the truth.” Sherlock looked down at John with a raised eyebrow. “Surely you would agree that telling him what he did wrong would be better than letting the children go with gaps in their education?”
“Oh, right.”
“Does he have nightmares often?”
“What goes around comes around, hm?” He tucks the list away without even looking at it.
"Well, yes" John concedes "it seems….sensible."
A little after eleven a message ticks in on his phone.
Christ, if they had known about Sam, would they still have been able to keep mums about it? What about Sherlock- would he have aborted his mission and returned to London?
Edward lifts his chin and gives Lestrade a glare that could curdle milk. For a moment, Lestrade thinks that maybe, just maybe, Edward’s facade is going to give. A slight twitch of a brow, a nervous glance at his lawyer, at the door, or anything. The whole room holds its breath. Ms. Alton, sensing the tension, but uncertain of the cause poises to interview on behalf of her client, but then-
An inaccurate description of his sentiments, he needs to hear him, breathe in his scent, trace every digit of Sherlock’s long and slender hands, needs to feel his pulse under his own.
“Good. Dismissed.”
He walks over to the door and knocks on it, five times in quick succession. The door opens and Jane Hill saunters in with a grin and a gun pointed at John.
“Mister….no, my apologies. Doctor Watson. John Watson.”
They decide there’s nothing more to be gleaned from the flat, so they leave, locking the door behind them and walk straight a tall, large frame blocking the corridor.
"No way," her friend argues, a short woman with a head full of red corkscrews. “After he’s finally got enough signatures to force the House to discuss reforms, to discuss the return of capital punishment, he’s not going to give up. I bet he's just biding his time."
John grimaces,
Mycroft turns to John, dark eyes measuring.
“I was surprised that you’d come alone.”
John twists carefully out of the bathroom as two paramedics rush in and fall to their knees next to Glen Reese and he knows that the Omega is in safe their hands.
John finds himself suddenly practicing the confession. He did the same thing before he asked Ann Marge Sandridge out on their first date. Her reaction was easy to predict: she´d blush and stutter her favorable assessment of John and agree to go out with him. And that’s  exactly what happened.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ms. Finkle looks like she’s bitten into something vile but is far too polite to spit it out.
Jane Hill moves across the room to stand next to John, undoubtedly to use him as a human shield. He feels her erratic breathing against his cheek; a pearl of sweat is trickling down her forehead.
He combs his finger through his damp hair and closes his eyes for a second, and then with a deep, steadying breath, moves over to Glen Reese.
John ducks his head to hide the faint blush creeping along the back of his neck.
Back in 221B, they collect an enthusiastic Toby from Mrs. Hudson. The dog bounds around their feet, his tail wagging up a storm with an expression of one who thinks they’ve been gone for ages. Sam wriggles free of John’s hand and Toby greets him by licking his fingers, making the child squeal in joy.
London, John thinks, but he knows what Mycroft is really saying: he’s going to see Sherlock today.
There’s blood on the pavement.
It’s a gentle kiss, for all of about two heart beats before Sherlock nudges John backwards, walking him  into the living room, kissing and nipping at his lips, his hands curling over John’s shoulders. John falls easily into the rhythm, kissing back daringly, pressing his mouth fiercely against Sherlock’s and grabbing hold of the lapels of his jacket.
"Did he like it?" John wonders "being a soldier?"
"I know I can always count on you to be cautious and sensible." The "unlike your sister" goes unsaid, but John hears it in the tone Lydia´s voice. He recognizes it easily enough from hearing it so often in his dads´.
Together they pull Glen Reese onto his side, and this time water and bile trickle freely from his mouth. Without any medical equipment, John can’t do more than guide his patient through the tremors, making sure his thrashing limbs doesn’t hit anything.
Lestrade schools his features before his surprise becomes visible. They still haven’t been able to crack the system on Fenway’s hard drive. Why does Sherlock want him to bluff?
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, you think Glen Reese gave Finkle the hard drive?” Lestrade is unable to hide the skepticism in his voice. “When would he have had the time to do that? We have a tight timeline for his activities from the day Fenway was murdered to-”
Millions lost their savings. Business went bankrupt, unemployment skyrocketed, and forced enclosures on houses and property put immense pressure on the Council Housing program and welfare payment, which the councils tried to ease with increased taxes. By the end of summer, the rates for violent crimes and offenses were the highest in the post-war era. In the wake of the corruption scandal last year, the public trust in the police was at an all time low and they felt helpless to tackle the increasing violence.
“I can’t stress how serious this is,” John hisses.
And because he’s lost the ability of rational thought and coherent sentence structure, John says the only thing that comes to him.
“Not much,” John admits. “If the victims, I mean Nash and Braithsworth, were chosen because they were important….because it was important they were punished, then somebody had to /know/ that Isidora’s death wasn’t a suicide.”
“Would you get some new pajamas, this one is soaked through.”
“Should we try the side roads,” John suggests, shouldering past three men sharing a drink from a brown paper bag, “maybe there will be less of a crowd?”
John's blinking blood out of his eyes, it's obscuring his vision. He pulls out a tissue paper from his pockets and dabs his forehead, pressing it against the wound.  He feels the slow, steady, rhythm of his pulse against his fingers as the cut throbs in pain.
Despite her speed, the woman doesn’t make it. The doors slide shut right in front of her. The woman slams into the doors and it feels like the whole carriage shakes.
Sally Donovan pulls out a set of photographs, pictures of the victims at the primary school, still alive and smiling at the camera. They hadn’t wanted to give them any reason to leave the interview in a huff.
So, if you do not like fluff, this might not be the chapter for you. There, is, however, the occasional angst and subtle hints....
He signs quite vehemently, pointing an accusatory finger at the stroller.
John presses his lips together into a thin line. If this was his medicine, why had Jane Hill said that Cobb had it- what had been in the bottle he took? .
Another part of him simply wants to forget he ever met him. Glen Reese ran away from the sound of the gunshot, but John would have run straight towards it. He seems the stereotype Omega, everything John ran away from and it makes his skin crawl to know that he is in London, just a few blocks away.
All too soon he’s standing under the dark red awning of Speedy’s, staring at the black door, and nothing has changed. Like it’s just been three hours where he’s nicked down to the pub for a pint with an old friend and he’s going to return to the flat where Sherlock will be peering into a microscope and not have noticed that John’s been gone. They’ll bicker over the state of the kitchen and end up ordering take-out that Sherlock won’t eat. The flat will be warm and the rain will be slanting against the window and maybe, just maybe, Sherlock will play the violin until John falls asleep.
"I´m not- I´m not ashamed." John says through gritted teeth. "But I won´t let this dictate how I am going to live my life."
Lestrade’s words are drowned in the sound of a door opening and closing again. A frustrated growl. Something being kicked across the floor.
By time officers arrived at the office, the envelope had been tossed in the bin and the money had already been sorted into the rest of their cash reserve, leaving the evidence they could have found utterly useless.
Jane Hill pushes a lock of hair away from her eyes, “shut it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John goes instantly rigid.
John gives him a slightly suspicious look and shrugs. “It’s on this floor, past the living room, first door to your left.” There’s a faint tint of blush in Glen Reese’s cheeks as he makes another round of excuses, a few seconds later John can hear his heavy and clumsy footsteps dragging him across the living room.
“No. I assume Moriarty attained a copy of it somewhere and kept it for his convenience.”
“Another fake police officer?” John asks with the faintest tint of bitterness in a voice. Lestrade hides his grimace behind the rim of his teacup.
John awakes to the sensation of an unexpected presence in his room. He lies completely still, allows himself a couple of heartbeats before he opens his eyes and finds Sam’s tiny shape standing in the doorway. His dark, Sherlockian curls from a wild halo around his head. When he sees that John is awake, he hurdles himself across the room and onto the bed. He grabs hold of John’s pyjama-clad arm and tugs while his right hand, middle finger extended, swipes from his waist to his face.
John nods along with Fenway´s words, and accepts the book and studies the tittle: An Omega´s Guide by Alexander Lee Finkle. He flips idly through the booklet. He hates how his body throbs in sudden burst of arousal when he sees the graphic depiction of an Omega´s reproductive organs and the Alpha Knot. It seems that even medical diagrams turns him on. He suddenly realizes that if faced with the prospect, if a man, an Alpha, propositions him, he would probably quite happily let him spread his legs and-
“I don't know. Didn't Jane Hill tell you anything while I was unconscious? She seemed very eager to tell me why I'm here.”
Sam Milligan gives him an odd, little half-smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
John crosses his arms and tries discreetly to wipe his sweaty palms on his jacket. Don´t let him see how frightened you really are, he thinks. Don´t let him sense that you want him. He knows his heart thundering against his ribcage and his Omega pheromones is betraying his emotions.
“Is that why I was woozy when I woke up?”
“What was it?” Sherlock asks and John is one terrified heartbeat away from tackling Allen Farren to the ground to keep him quiet.
He tries to imagine how it would have been if Sherlock had stayed.
Molly shoulders hunch forward, her breath hitching, “Mrs. Hudson thinks he wasn’t coping all that well.”
“Bloody hell…” Sherlock groans and points a sharp finger at a small smudge on the door. “Blood. There.” Sherlock points at a seemingly innocent dark stain just above the peephole.  “You will test it and confirm that it belongs to the victim.”
Sherlock snarls and grabs Simon Whitewell by his chin, lifting him up with one arm until he's pressing him against the wall again, squeezing the breath out of him. His Adam's apple bobs erratically against Sherlock's hand, but the only thing Sherlock can hear is the pounding of the blood rushing in his ear as he stares into the feeble, useless face of Simon Whitewell who is clamoring for his life. It takes only a little over 40 pounds of pressure to crush the trachea and the tender arteries.  He suddenly feels capable of doing it, squeezing and crushing until he falls limp to the floor.
“We’re glad to see you at home, doctor,” Mrs. Kettle says.
Sam seems content with this confirmation and returns his attention to his bowl of berries only glancing up to point at things, moving his hands through sometimes complicated signs and preening under John’s confirmation when he got them right. His vocabulary is expanding daily, and John thinks that he’s not too far away from stringing them together to more than three-word sentences.
“Tell. Me. Who. Hired. You?”
kind of incentive.”
“Fine,” she echoes, with a real smile this time.
Is this what Blithely, Reese and the rest of the support group had planned? Public outcry, the demonisation of Alphas? But to what end? And how can they benefit from this potential chaos? Or is chaos their ultimate goal? The only individual Sherlock can think of who would enjoy chaos for the sake of chaos, is Moriarty. He could hardly have managed to manipulate these individuals to commit mass murder with such a meagre reward. He must have promised them something else, but what?
“What the hell-” she cries, frantically wiping at the stain, smearing it over the tan fabric of her coat.
John forces a smile and jams his hands under his armpits. He doesn’t want to disappoint Mrs. Hudson, but he’s certain that if not for Sherlock’s, he would never have gone back to live in 221 B. The few moments he spent sorting through Sherlock’s things a couple of weeks ago had been difficult enough, he knows he could never have managed to live there.
"Well, I…." John has given this some thought as well, and he´s not sure how he feels about the answer. "I´m pretty sure I could, if it was to defend somebody, or myself."
Hestia is standing in the waiting room, her fingers still on her phone, her gaze locked on the television. The blank look in her eyes is studied and perfect.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says, his attention somewhere else, “they were here when I came and it doesn’t look like they intend to leave. It matters not, one of them is about to be proven guilty of murder and it’s convenient to have him close for an easy arrest. The machine?”
Jane Hill laughs, and it’s shaky, insincere, “you don’t think my face will raise  all the flags on the first CCTV camera I cross. I’ve been told to remain here until instructed further.”
He struggles to his feet and pushes his way through the throng of people.
There are thousands of nurses in London, not even included those who have retired or been discharged. In addition, “nurse” is such a broad definition. There are Agency Nurses, Critical Care Nurse, Forensic Nurse, Legal Nursing, Midwife, Paediatric Nurse, Psychiatric Nurse. It makes the number of potential suspects staggering. If only Lee Finkle had given them some information to help eliminate potential subjects. Young, old? Retired? Still in school? Was this nurse a man or a woman? Foreigner? What about his or her accent?
“Sit down. When Cobb gets back, he’ll take Glen Reese and dump him somewhere he’ll be found.”
Suddenly Sherlock is there, yanking the constable’s arm back with such brutal strength, John can hear the bones break. Sherlock´s face is ashen and his eyes are hard and flinty. His hand squeezes against the broken wrist, hard, and the constable yowls in pain.
“True,” his face curls to a mockery of a smile, “it’s all about layers, isn’t it?”
Edward presses his lips to a thin line and uncrosses his legs, gripping the armrests tightly as he forces his words through a thigh smile. “Make no mistake, we do not, in any way, shape, or form support violence of any kind. Our cause is a peaceful one.”
I´m trying my hand on the tense on this story, I´m not if past or present tense is best for a background story, so I may go back an alter it again. I am also still trying to figure out the formate on Ao3, and I hope it isn´t too much hassle to read.
“No, ma’am.”
It´s almost seven years until he really thinks about the Alphas and Omegas again, when the famous "Alpha Murderer" case is plastered all over the newspaper and televisions.
“Have you ever been in Doctor Fenway's office?"
Without another word, Sherlock makes his way down the corridor to room 315 and pushes open the door. There are six beds in the room, all behind pale, blue curtains that afford the patients the illusion of privacy. Bed three is at the far end of the room, by the window.
John rose and followed him a little later after listening to the clatter of pots and pans and the clunk clunk clunk of food being diced. For a moment he just stood in the doorway and watched as Sherlock stood at the stove and cooked. His instinct was to help somehow and his hand went to the kettle to make tea. Sherlock silently shifted over to let John have access to the hob and they stood next to each other while they prepared their things. Sherlock was making something that involved sausage, peppers, garlic, and a jar of marinara sauce with a pot of pasta boiling. Something simple to toss together, then. He placed the lid on the pan he was using, set it to simmer, and walked away, John caught himself missing Sherlock’s presence, the warm shoulder nearby had felt nice as he stood and watched the kettle.
Sherlock’s brain seemed to catch up with what John was about to do and those large hands came up to grip John’s hips as John reached back for that cock, raising up on his knees and slowly sinking onto it with a long sigh. Sherlock let out an equally pleased sounding groan at the same time, hands squeezing into John’s hips until he was fully seated in Sherlock’s lap.
John’s mouth formed again, “not going anywhere soon, apologies,” John replied, the bulk of him shifting to bump Sherlock.
As always I love getting comments and kudos, please leave some if you liked the fic. Thank you for reading and giving this one a try. :)
“What now?” Sherlock asked catching John’s look and instantly knowing John was about to ask something for his blog.
“Oh? Oh, that’s good, good to know.” John stumbled over his words in the wake of his embarrassment.
“Fuck off, Sherlock, usually variants upon that,” he confessed, standing from his chair and taking his empty mug with him into the kitchen.
“Kind of hard not to, do you intentionally have your riding outfits tailored a size too small?” John asked with a smile.
“No it wasn’t, you had to text me to find you and--”
“Dr Watson, this is your rider speaking. Sig is a good girl and we’ll try to make your take off as smooth as possible. I’ve heard about your problem and would suggest you just sit with your dragon and try to remain calm, take deep breaths, and relax for a nice flight home to London.” The soothing voice came over the radio perfectly clear, and John followed the instructions, taking the receiver with him when he found out the cord would stretch that far. John leaned back against Hyperion’s neck, the bloom of the bond acting as a balm on his already frayed nerves.
“Speaking of baths, I’m sure Dr. Hooper’s gonna want to get him one soon,” she said after a short period of silence.
There, the end for this story. I will be writing more for this verse, I intend to write a sequel fic for Lestrade and Mycroft's relationship, it may be a while in making it cause life getting in the way.
John took a deep breath and let it out as he looked up at the tall detective, police lights still flashing away behind him. “You have a fear of flying,” Sherlock stated, baritone not sounding surprised at all, even though his eyes showed a small level of confusion.
“Yes, let’s,” Sherlock said, returning the loving rub as he proceeded towards the stairs with John right behind.
“But you voluntarily sling yourself at it.” John looked at the blankets he’d been given, nice soft things, one knitted with an orange fish scale pattern the other powder blue.
John thought,
John had nearly given up on actually finding out what Sherlock was doing. He knew there wasn’t anywhere else to go beyond this one room, the spiral stairs could only take them to the roof of the tower where the various bits of radar and weather equipment sat. But up the stairs Sherlock went. He popped open the door at the top and gestured for John to step through ahead of him.
Eventually Lestrade did get in the driver’s seat and start the car. “I’m going to take you two home now,” he said. “Don’t think we’re done talking about this Sherlock,” he added looking in the rear view mirror back at the Mollisian pair in the back. He was almost certain Sherlock would be getting a visit from Mycroft in the near future, and Lestrade was sure he’d hear about it when it happened as was so often the case when the brothers clashed.
John thought, tail propelling him towards the window. He swore he saw a human shape beyond it, but by the time he’d gotten good and close it was gone.
John took the moment to get up, still a little sluggish but able to get up and move. He’d probably have a hard time maintaining a proper detailed human likeness for the day, but he’d manage. He formed up as much as he could a scarlet humanoid shape and hugged Sherlock, whose mind instantly rang with a questioning feeling of ‘what have I done for this?’ Even as he wrapped around John as well returning the hug and enjoying the physical contact with his mate as he always did.
Sherlock seemed to notice the gears grinding much slower in John’s head, and with a put-upon sigh, made a sweeping motion over the case. “What is missing here?” He asked imperiously. John looked over the table covered in rapidly congealing slime, eggshell, and clothing.
John woke at least a dozen more times during the flight by a small shake here or a light judder there. Each time a larger one rattled the crate, a kind crewmember would come over the radio, tell him what had caused it, and not to worry. Hours and hours passed like that, drifting off to Hyperion’s light breathing, only to be awakened by the smallest of shakes to their compartment. At one point John got up and, shuffling with his back to the windows this time, grabbed a sealed sandwich and water and settled back down.
Jim screamed as the book was damaged and fell away from John’s back as though she was in pain. He spun on her expecting her to surge back up, only to find that she was staying down, crumpled on the floor shrieking and holding her head. He looked from her to the book, to the knife, and over to Sherlock who was still lying across a downed Sebbie, tail twitching ineffectively as he tried to wriggle back towards the water. In the momentary pause John’s brain made the connection.
Tom gave John a smaller piece to throw one-handed. Getting to feed Hyperion himself made John feel an odd surge of pride. It wasn’t like he had gone out and slaughtered and butchered the meat himself; if anything, Tom was doing the lion’s share of the feeding, but throwing the first couple of vitamin-riddled steaks to his dragon made his heart swell. Hyperion, even injured, was extremely good at catching his ‘prey’ out of the air and missed nothing from his stationary position on his mattress. The happiness he got from just being able to eat was definitely infectious.
“Sherlock-” John’s mental voice was cut off by Sherlock separating from him completely and sulkily squidging through the door. He manifested a mouth and called “Sherlock, love, stop.” John slipped out of bed as well, following his still orange-tinted mate.
John’s brain thought in a mild panic while his feet stopped carrying him forward.
“Not on a large scale, thankfully, no. Several years ago a 15 year old nestling didn’t get picked for an egg and rather than wait another year, left the program all together. His 13 year old girlfriend, however, got picked on her first application and in a fit of anger he barged into her dragon’s new pit a few days after her hatching ceremony. She was found dead with the signs of a strong, fast, blow to the head and the imprints of fingers on her neck in the sand. He was found dead not far away torn to pieces by the adult dragons in the neighboring pits as well as the hatchling. He’d tried to bond with her dragon even as the hatchling was still shrieking over the brutal severing of its initial bond. And he received hell in the form of two large female dragons coming over the walls and tearing him literally limb from limb. A larger scale version of that would be horrific,” Sherlock told him, his face darkened as a halo of light shone around his hair.
The bond held strong as Sally drove slowly down the hall. The Aerie was as busy as it always seemed, a dragon being led out of its pit, a couple of feeders going by with their carts, others driving little golf carts or using bikes bound for farther distances across the Aerie, or simply walking. They quickly passed the public baths in the middle of the hall; John had used these a few times during the bonding process, since any farther than that would strain the bond. The midway point crossed, the rest of the pits along the hall passed quickly and they exited through a smaller set of gates at the other end. A short hallway connected to a whole new part of the Aerie John had never seen. A stretch of seemingly normal London road crossed in front of them; if the ground had been paved and the high walls had not been visible beyond the rooftops, he would have thought they’d left the Aerie entirely. But on either side rose flats, multistory buildings that looked like they’d be right at home lining any street outside the Aerie. A few people walked on the sidewalks like normal city folk would do; it looked as though John had been dropped into a quiet street. Some of the houses sported personal touches: flower boxes along windows, different colored doors, small things that added to the mundanity of the street. Sally turned and slowly drove up the road to the right and parked in front of an average-looking place with a black door sporting the letters ‘221b’. The ground floor was white with black fencing outside the first floor windows. The drapes were shut up as if no one lived there.
“What the hell is this?” Sally asked holding the jar gingerly away from her face.
John looked at the detective still slumped against him in his lap and sighed. Anything to get Sherlock to a safer location. John carefully maneuvered Sherlock up to leaning against the counter and got him onto his shoulders in a fireman’s lift, not even close to dignified for the poor unconscious Sherlock but the easiest way for John to carry the long-limbed lanky man back through the aquarium.
“Er, no actually, I just met him last night and I haven’t seen him eat anything.” John admitted, Sherlock hadn’t stopped moving really it seemed since he woke up that morning, if he’d even slept at all behind that closed bedroom door. That gave John an idea. “I could take him dinner if you’ve got anything left.”
A honey colored appendage reached out to John and John met it with a scarlet one of his own. The feelings that met him were much better than before. The embarrassment was squashed down to the back of his mind and replaced by a very apologetic mood. Sherlock wanted to wrap up John and make him happy which John replied to with his own mental push.
John didn’t feel like talking at the moment; the distress still radiating strongly along the bond made a hot clenching feeling form at the top of his stomach. John gripped the handle of his cane harder and dug a fist into the bottom of his ribcage where the heartsick feeling sat.
The sun being completely set by no means stopped the Aerie in its tracks. While the dragons’ hallways were kept fairly dark for the sake of the residents whose pits were attached to them, the rest of the complex was lit similarly to regular streets. Wall-mounted lights made to look like lanterns cast the halls in yellowy white. John passed a few workers still out and about who carried torches dutifully aimed at the ground. While the halls were like streets the smaller corridors seemed more like alleyways, more dim and shadowed, and in the moments when John was alone and all was quiet a small shiver ran up his spine and made him walk a little faster.
They both worked together to get the hatchling out of the room, pushing the gurney out into the main barn again and towards an open stall, John following close behind the whole time. The huge stall was mostly padded, no sand at all, a small water fountain but otherwise the majority of the room the high walls created were soft. It all dwarfed the little hatchling, but it was warm and apparently it would be the stage for someone’s bonding. Mike darted off and returned with a sealed box of food for the hatchling, which he left outside for the time being, Molly prepared some water and towels for cleaning up the mess that would follow, even from what promised to be a weak feed. John watched all of the quick prep work from the doorway of the stall, Molly and Mike both lifted the hatchling from the gurney and placed it on the padded section of the stall facing the door.
“John Watson is grounded for an indeterminate amount of time and in need of an instructor to rapidly catch him up on our ways. Who better than the grounded rider he shares his living arrangements with?” Mycroft reasoned out for them, all five redirecting their gazes over to John, before coming back to the bored face of the rider in question. John saw a spark in his eyes, though. Sherlock’s face said disinterest, but his eyes were flicking from Mycroft to John.
“Er, Dr  Hooper--”
John felt a hysterical panic begin to rise as the thought occurred to him. He tried to bend and twist his spine further to see the tail better, maybe see what it attached to. He bent his spine almost into a perfect C shape only to see the tail connected to a fish body.
“Good morning, you,” John mumbled quietly. Hyperion calmly pushed a soft swell of happiness across the bond that warmed John to his core and made him feel amazing. Being allowed to sleep so long and not be interrupted by blaring emergencies or shouting higher-ups at ungodly hours of the morning was such a new occurrence, after years of the military beating into him the instinct to be up and running at the drop of a hat. To be able to wake up, calmly eat, and just enjoy a calm morning, even go back to sleep for a while if he chose, that was a luxury in the extreme after frontlines and battlefield hospitals.
The next day Sherlock broke the silence.
John followed him down the hall, amused by Sherlock’s small pang of self-consciousness over the state of the flat. Assuming he’d had time for the ‘proper wooing’ bit of his plan Sherlock probably would have had the flat cleaned up, but John didn’t really care about the mess. If anything he prefered to see it, because it was Sherlock. John knew Sherlock had his oddities, veering between absolute chaos and ridiculously neat when the mood struck. No point in trying to hide it now.
John felt Sherlock rotating him slightly in his grip presenting the paramedic with the bit of skin that bore the small cuts. The nice people took their time dressing the wounds properly, Sherlock holding John a little tighter as the sting of an antiseptic ricocheted around John’s mind like a shot. They applied the strips of Mollisian bandage tape to John’s skin with a modest minimum of contact, which John wished he could thank them for.
He was nowhere near as graceful as Bellamy, who was out in the deeper end. In the water she looked like a fish, her scales taking on even more of a shine, especially when she broke the surface and the sun caught water drops dripping off. And John found Sherlock once her head surfaced. The mad rider was hanging onto her horns while she swam, turning in lazy circles now on the surface. John watched him let go and she picked him up again, rolling onto her back and placing him on her belly.
“You seem oddly fixed on him, John,”
They passed through into the nesting and hatching grounds, past workers tending to eggs and securing doorways. Compared to the rest of the Aerie it was oddly quiet. John had never come into this area before though he’d seen down the halls from a distance; there was simply no reason to explore there and there hadn’t yet been a hatching ceremony to attend. Sherlock turned into one of the doors along the long hallway and was abruptly stopped when the smaller access door did not give way under his palm. John finally caught up to him as he started knocking. No one answered.
“Its a serial killer and they’ve made a big mistake this time!” Sherlock was off and heading down the stairs, John trying to follow as fast as he could on his bad leg.
John watched them go, slightly befuddled by Mrs Hudson’s reaction. Hyperion was laughing on his end of the bond, whether due to the situation at hand or the prior tickling John couldn’t tell, but the dragon’s laughter vibrating on the bond made John chuckle too. He was pulled back to the flat by Sherlock curling onto the sofa with a loud sigh, arms moving to protectively cover his belly and ribs.
“She’s the veterinarian for our division, Molly Hooper, sweet woman, honest. Hyperion’s just as bad as a child about check-ups, has been since he was a fledgeling.” He moved over by John in front of Hyperion’s head. “Now. We’re gonna get his head tucked back in, and you’re going to stay out here with him for the night. Get that bond settled in a bit more.” Lestrade bent and made the motion to lift under Hyperion’s chin.
“Where have you been?” Sally asked equally cool with added touch of the disdain she always seemed to have reserved just for Sherlock. “Been groping a corpse again?”
Tom eyed him with an arched brow. “You know, there’s another bit of rumor going around says you’re afraid of flying,” he said. John could feel his face heating, how had they found that out?!
“I’m not!” John didn’t know what else to say, sputtering off into silence as he tried to come up with some way to respond even though he knew Sherlock was goading him on. And so they wandered on down the hall, John could nearly hear Sherlock’s smug smile, looking down at John through the corner of his eye. At least he seemed to enjoy getting John riled up; and John did like seeing him smile, even though that smile was a somewhat smarmy-arse one.
“Oh? what do most people say?” John asked, watching a brief flash of what looked like happiness cross Sherlock’s face in the form of a tiny tug upwards in the corner of his mouth, a small but genuine smirk.
John hadn’t seen the front gates of the Aerie yet and they were an intimidating sight, Giant bronze dragons, like the lions at Trafalgar square, sat on both sides of a wide multi-lane road leading through a huge stretch of grassy landscape that appeared to surround the Aerie walls for as far as the eye could see in both directions. A bowed curve of columns stretched outwards from either side of the gate itself. They reminded John of the front of the county hall building down by the Thames. The gate itself was a massive wrought-iron construction, black bars and filigrees towering high. Like the wooden doors in the dragon hall, multiple smaller gates stood open at the bottom, with guards at their sides checking cars and allowing them passage into or out of the Aerie.
Even though there was some mild confusion coming across the bond from Hyperion, they did start the trek across the Aerie all the way back to Hyperion’s pit.
Sherlock held on with his legs and stayed where he was; John on the other hand hadn’t anticipated the roll and flopped off into the thankfully soft grass. That landing wasn’t as pleasant, soft grass aside, the ground was still solid ground and he was only too thankful that he didn’t land on his bad shoulder. Bellamy’s head turned to look at him and John could almost see her glare at Sherlock, apparently having John land on his back in a field hadn’t been her intention.
“Well yes, not all of them, but most of them.” John corrected.
“You’re talking to them,” Sherlock’s voice didn’t really carry a question with it, he just plopped the laptop back in John’s hands and went back to his chair and his cooled tea.
“I know,” Sherlock said quietly, too late for her to even remotely hear him as he trudged over to the sofa and flopped down on it staring up at the ceiling. “Next time I’ll just leave the thing to die in a back alley somewhere.” Sherlock mumbled up at the white plaster.
“Here!” He sat up. The server appeared, edging around Hyperion’s head where it was still curled, eyes fractionally opened. He set the lunchbox in his arms down on the edge of the mat.
The moment they broke the surface, John looked over at Sherlock’s wet head and burst out laughing. “Good God! I think that may have been the absolute strangest shag I have ever had!” He hugged Sherlock to him, even as Sherlock slung the used condom towards the concrete. Sherlock started chuckling too, their combined sounds echoing around the bare piping in the room; he pushed them back over to the edge, still chortling away. They flopped out of the water, laying side by side with their calves still floating.
He let his thoughts wander for a while, focusing on nothing but the loud thrumming of the rotor above him and the rare staticky voices over the protective headset he wore. John looked around to the other people in black sitting around him quiet and still. A tiny scared part of his mind supplied that they probably didn’t care one whit about Sherlock, not like John did. The only reason they were going was because Mycroft apparently had an even more ridiculous sway of power than John had thought. They weren’t going because they wanted Sherlock back, they were just doing a job. If Sherlock weren’t Mycroft’s brother, John would almost bet Sherlock was a secondary mission on the way to capturing the kingpin Jim.
“That’s no problem.” Lestrade ducked back under and away from Hyperion, calling over one of the crew still hovering nearby. “He’s popped a couple stitches, go tell Miss Hooper she’s going to need the equipment to repair it,” he ordered before coming back to John. “We had better get him moving again, He broke a stitch on his hind leg, but he should be fine to walk the distance to his pit. Just talk him home like you were doing before,” he told him, reaching up and stroking Hyperion’s cheek, smiling confidently up into the golden eye looking tiredly at them.
“On my way now,” he replied, piling his plate alongside the others waiting to be washed and striding through the doors with as much confidence as his limp would allow. He took the path he remembered best to get from the cafeteria to the airfield, the one Sally had taken his first day there. John still had to pause and glance at directional signs, but following the flows of Aerie traffic and the massive open-air halls brought him to the right place.
, brother of mine,” replied Sherlock from his place behind his chair, his voice colored with venomous loathing.
“Whoever this killer is has been here for years possibly, just biding their time, waiting, this will be fun. If anything it gets us out of those tedious classes, I wonder if they’ll strike again soon,” And off Sherlock went, starting for the door.
John thought as he turned to look at the room. A pair of mismatched chairs sat on either side of a fireplace, one empty, the other covered in a box of newspapers, a union jack pillow balanced precariously on top. The place is probably quite lovely and homey underneath it all, John told himself.
She snarled again, but did back up before she crushed him. “Just stay here. I’ll bring him to you.” She hissed at him but backed away like he ordered.
“Got a bit stuck in your head huh?” John asked softly, bringing a hand up to Sherlock’s face, seeing the slight panic in those blue eyes as they locked onto John’s. "I can help with that,” John said huskily into Sherlock’s ear.
Hyperion’s head lifted immediately the moment John opened the door, a torrent of happiness and relief flooding across the bond. He stayed put and John came to him, crawling onto the mat to rest against Hyperion’s warm arm.
“We just got home!” John protested freeing his face only to have a pair of gloves also thrust at him, “Weren’t you not a moment ago saying something about the weather?”
They had been sitting on the sofa one night with Sherlock’s head in John’s lap when John had spoken up.
“If you would like to swim with your dragons there are changing rooms and lockers just this way.” The woman indicated a unisex bathroom door in the wall behind her. John was about to decline, not having bought a pair of swimwear since his arrival, when Sherlock interrupted him by grabbing his arm and dragging him towards the door.
A couple of strange miracles happened in the blink of an eye. The first came in the form of a large flying fish. Sherlock, like a giant dark torpedo, came sailing out of the water right at Sebbie. His fishy bulk rammed right into her back and sent her lurching forward. The second came in the fact that the knife she’d been brandishing at John missed his belly and instead sliced into the cover of the book before dropping harmlessly to the floor.
“She’s not German, she was trying to write the name Rachel. I’m going to need you to find out who that is, friends, family.” Sherlock said springing up. “She’s an Aerie worker, not from London though, she traveled here within the last few hours overnight. There’s a piece of a train ticket in her pocket, but not enough to tell where she’s from; judging by the damp under her collar and the dry umbrella in her other pocket she came through rain on the way here, which, going by the weather forecasts, means she’s from Cardiff. Cardiff is the only place that has gotten significant heavy rain with high winds meaning she was unable to use her umbrella and turned her coat collar up to the wind.”
John looked back at Lestrade, eyebrow raised in question.
Lunch was nowhere near as busy as breakfast had been but even still the cafeteria was inhabited by a good number of people. Many were children, all in groups being chaperoned by adults. John noticed that each division of the Aerie had different colored uniforms for their nestlings: Henry’s wore bright red and burgundy and Stapleton’s had a light cream and navy blue, while Soo Lin’s wore a sunny orange and brown and Sholto’s were in shades of military green. Lestrade’s bright blue and tan caught John’s eye immediately and a hand shot out of the group waving at him within moments of entering: Mary. Jim was with them and looked up in the direction she was waving. John saw his eyes widen before he gave a nervous wave and then reached to put a hand on Mary’s shoulder to shepherd her along with the rest of the group.
John chokes on the memory of Sherlock standing on the rooftop, his arm stretched out towards him.
John moves stiffly to stand behind Sherlock, keeping more space between himself and the detective than he normally would.
The apartment is in a dreadful state. It reeks of stale air, old food, sweat, and piss. There are cartons of take-away food, pizza boxes and empty cans of food lining the walls in the corridor along with several plastic bags of garbage. How long has it been since this guy stepped outside?
John leaves money for the beer on the table and nods again to Glen Reese, before he slowly makes his way through the throng of people who have filled up the pub. There is a pleasant and calm buzz in the crowd and the sounds and smells pull John back to reality. He’ll go back to 221B Baker Street, maybe text Lestrade for a case if Sherlock still hasn’t moved from the sofa. He’ll take a shower, go to bed, and wake up tomorrow and return to being John Watson, former army doctor and current assistant to the world’s only consulting detective.
John nods along in agreement, letting the cold draught cool his flushed nerves.
They’ve cordoned off the area, but a head on a stake is bound to draw a crowd, even at seven o’clock in the morning. News vans are setting up their barricades and somewhere a blitz goes off. Christ, in a few minutes this is going to be all over the Internet.
,” he adds and continues before Sherlock can protest, “that John would be ecstatic to see you alive and now you’re confused as to why he’s not?”
The autumn before John Watson turns seventeen, most of Great Britain´s attention is tuned on a string of extremely violent murders. There seems to be no apparent connection between the victims: a homeless man, a woman in her mid- sixties who worked for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the latest, a teenage boy found in a pool house. In fact, the only thing the three victims had in common was in the vicious, some newspapers even said savage, way they had been killed. The police are sparse with their comments and announcements on the possible suspect, and this, naturally, made speculations and rumors flourish. Soon the consensus of popular opinion is that the murderer had to be an Alpha, because nobody else had the strength to kill with such brutality.
“More?” John asked with a laugh.
“Two sugars,” Sherlock called from the sitting room, making John look sharply in that direction.
She had long black hair that draped over the shoulders of a expensive-looking suit and the moment he met her eyes he could see a dark glint in them. She could very well be his executioner and her eyes alone told him so. “Well aren’t you a specimen,” she said, a Irish accent strongly coloring her voice. She leaned down a little towards him, hands in her pockets, appraising him as though he were meat at the butcher's counter.
John just smiled .“Alright,” he said, going back to his laptop screen where a list sat open.
“A few, most of the efforts are out with wild colonies. Rangers monitor the colonies, but there’s only so much protection you can give feral dragons, so with some species we have Aerie programs. It gets a bit complicated really--”
“Mmm, not so pretty now,” Sebbie replied, leaning into Jim’s hand, but her eyes were looking to her reflection in the aquarium glass next to her.
“John, can we look at Hyperion?” she asked quietly, as if she was speaking to a sick person just waking up in hospital.
“Well, its more part of the hatching ceremony than anything,” Lestrade said, sitting down next to John on the mat. “The eggs in a clutch all hatch roughly around the same time; some take hours and hours to hatch while others pip and come out right away. Either way the young riders picked for that clutch get gussied up in their special robes and then have to sit and wait near the eggs until they hatch. Once the hatchlings are out, the rider gets a plate of fresh, raw meat--well depends on the breed, sometimes it’s fish. Once had a clutch, years ago when I was a nestling, that ate whale. They had to have it specially flown in and everything. If I remember right that was the only time in recent history we had a Nordic lay a clutch here. The rider hadn’t realized her dragon was gravid till the eggs showed up on the field. Shocked the whole Aerie. No one except the rider and crew had seen Nordic eggs before. Tiny eggs for such big dragons. Her rider, after the initial embarrassment passed, was proud as a peacock over her girl’s first little clutch. Her whole crew doted over them and cared for them as if they were their own children.” Lestrade’s face took on a fond look at the memory.
“Might have to show me around some more if we’re worrying about safe drinking glasses,” John snickered, taking a long drink of cool water and copying Sherlock’s contentment.
“Oh, thanks,” John deadpanned.
“Sherlock, I don’t want to hit you, I want you to explain why on earth you want me to.” John was wide-eyed at the sudden whirl of frustration Sherlock had become. “It’s what Victor would have done, is that it? Is that why you refuse to actually say his name out loud? He actually did beat you for being a little obnoxious?” John was suddenly up and facing Sherlock, who backed away a step or two before holding his ground.
Sherlock leaned towards him even as John pulled away again, as though he were magnetically pulled towards John’s skin. But John just shuffled on, going about picking up the clothes he’d scattered around the kitchen earlier. Sherlock followed, not really doing anything, just wandering after John around the kitchen, down the hall, and into their bedroom where John tossed the clothes into the hamper for cleaning.
“No, why do you ask?” He asked in reply, sounding not at all like he meant it even as he dropped back to close the distance between them.
They did come to a stop in front of 221b though, much to John’s relief. He glanced over at Anthea, eyeing her from long stocking-clad legs to wavy hair. Nothing about her screamed ‘dangerous’, but John knew never to make that kind of assumption. “You’re not going to kill me are you?” he asked a touch dryly. That made her chuckle and look over at him with a raised eyebrow
“And I never said he wouldn’t. Don’t forget I blame you for the fact that he’s in such a sorry state to begin with. Hyperion should have never left this Aerie-” A loud clacking from behind them cut short the brewing row before it could really take off.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, the smile diminishing quickly.
“It’s not even a matter that is remotely close to being considered,” a soft voice said from Stapleton’s left. A younger looking woman of Asian descent with long dark hair tied back from her face spoke, “Master Soo Lin Yao, I head the public transit branch,” she said with a smile. “This is my First, Andy Galbraith.” She indicated the pale, curly-headed man next to her.
“Well, not really all the time,” the boy said, swallowing a mouthful of sandwich, “just funny things set Mr Moriarty off and make him go all quiet and twitchy like that. Doesn’t usually happen in the middle of the day like this though. But yeah, then he goes away for a few days, we get another teacher for a while and he comes back and tries again, longest he went without a spell was three weeks, back at the beginning of the year.”
As he came closer Hyperion drew upwards, raising his head up as far away as he could get it while remaining seated on the sand. John saw a massive patch of bandaging taped over Hyperion’s shoulder and hip, over where the two largest wounds John remembered seeing on him had been. Hyperion continued to let out a low rattling hiss as he looked down his muzzle at John.
Sally had known Sherlock for so long that she knew many of the stranger stories involving her least favorite subordinate. The last time the pair had been in contact with John present she’d asked him if he’d heard about the time Sherlock had kissed a body in the morgue, which had honestly shocked John for all of maybe a second before he remembered that he’d seen Sherlock actually put his nose on a complete stranger’s shoulder during a client meeting just to really get a scent of their cologne. Sherlock had turned a faint shade of pink, casting a glance to John before he rebutted that accusation of kissing with the excuse that he had been inspecting the victim’s face for injection site marks.
“Carl Powers, thirteen, old enough for a dragon and he got picked. Then four days before the hatching ceremony he was found face down in the sand right next to the egg that would have been his, stone cold dead,” Sherlock said, still gazing at the shoe, his eyes glazed over as though he were staring past the thing into the memory it encapsulated. “There were no signs of foul play, no blood, no nothing, people assumed he’d fallen asleep sitting with his egg and accidentally fallen over in the night, suffocated in the sand. But there was one thing that was off, his shoe, one of his shoes was missing, and it didn’t make sense. I tried to get the Masters, the police, to look into it harder but like I said who would listen to a nine year-old babbling about a missing shoe?” He looked up at John finally, face looking a little younger for a moment.
“Well I like you too you know that,” John replied struggling to sit up again and barely managing to remain upright once he got there, body nearly continuing in the path it was on and toppling over. He looked at Sherlock who in turn looked back, the pair of them facing each other on the bench.
Even with their extremely limited ability to express emotions John could only describe Sherlock as ecstatic. Once he’d finally slowed down and came back to John, Sherlock began rapidly flicking code at him drifting and then turning around almost like he was pacing next to John. John quickly lost track of what exactly Sherlock was trying to tell him though, and he jerked forward to nudge Sherlock in the side, interrupting his ‘pacing’.
John thought.
“What? Why?” John asked, looking up at Sherlock.
“Why do you need me?!” John called after him, following Sherlock as his coat swished around the corner down the stairs.
“Sherlock, what was that about?” Lestrade asked after a moment in which Sherlock continued to stare at the phone with a face John could only describe as a mix of confusion and interest.
“I wasn’t his mate.” Sherlock spoke quietly, while John wandered into the kitchen for scissors. He froze at the statement.
Mycroft looked down at John, seeming to have heard John’s thought. “Of course,” he said, his tone sharp before returning to his composed self. “He gets into so much trouble, he worries Mummy to--”
“It would be nice” John said interrupting Sherlock’s explanation. “That is, if Hyperion would like it. I haven’t got a clue on that front if I’m honest, decorating a pit.” John admitted.
“Told you to sip it,” he said between chuckles, taking Sherlock’s cup and pouring a little more for him. Sherlock acted like the coughing had never happened, with an air of  “meant to do that” as he took the cup back and took a tiny sip of it.
“John, Dr John Watson, I’ve been, er, helping Sherlock,” John introduced himself to her, fumbling for words as he tried to not mention the aquarium while talking about how they’d met.
She was cut off by Mike re-entering. “It’s a feral release, no riders, Cardiff gave us the go ahead to select one and keep them updated on the situation.”
Thank you so much to both Nautilicious and DulcimerGecko for betaing this chapter for me.
If Sherlock ever felt John startle awake again in the morning he never said anything, just hugged him closer, just as John did when he felt Sherlock startle. The first few days after that at 221B came with a slight adjustment period and that was one of them, becoming used to the fact that waking up in the morning and seeing the sun did not mean that they were about to die. They each had their own unique nightmares about the whole ordeal but they comforted each other when the nightmares woke them.
“Oh?” Sherlock voice changed completely from unsure to curious in an instant. John looked up at Sherlock, who sounded like he already knew what John had seen just with that one word. He saw Sherlock’s mouth curling at the corners and his eyebrows were definitely up. “And what did you see, John Watson?” He was absolutely being a tease, John could hear it in the way his smile came through in his voice.
“A little,” Sherlock mumbled.
“I’m fine.” Sherlock protested, taking the bottle anyway.
His eyes popped open instantly as what felt like a dagger stabbed right into the middle of his old shoulder wound, a knife point digging into the bullet hole again with a force that made John gasp and writhe away. It was Jim’s hand, her sharp black nails. She was gripping into John’s shoulder and digging the tip of her thumbnail in as hard as she could, the other four clawing into the back of his shoulder along with it.
“No, all’s right with the world,” John replied, typing a firm ‘no’ response to the latter message about the post, the last thing John wanted to turn up was a booby trap in the Aerie, forget about it getting to their doorstep, he was worried about the potential poor dragon, or rider, or field worker, or delivery person who might encounter it first.
Mycroft physically turned to look at the seething mass that was John, all tentacles and a mouth trying to stretch himself upwards and become an intimidating shape to the literally larger Mollisian. They seemed to stare each other down for a long while, as though they were having a silent conversation. Sherlock settled down out of his own irritated shape behind them, though he didn’t try to return to his chair.
“I have been reliably told I have no heart, John; best not fool yourself thinking otherwise,” he murmured, opening a cabinet and putting the experiment away.
They sat together for a while, not saying anything, Sherlock holding onto John like a large teddy bear.
Sebbie threw Sherlock to the ground to intercept John, arm darting out to grab the back of his neck and attempt to wrestle him to the ground. John was done, he’d had it with the pair of them and nothing was keeping him from Jim and that book. He countered with an elbow to her exposed gut, hoping that it would wind her like a normal human, and not only managed to make her crumple a bit, but staggered Sebbie to the point that a good shove sent her backwards into the blue water of the tank.
“Can we go home?” John finally asked, mental voice shaky at best as he simply pressed his mind as close to Sherlock’s as he could in lieu of being able to physically touch him back.
The rough voiced one pulled out a smartphone and started fiddling with it while the weaselly one pulled a large toolbox from under the workbench. While they were distracted John tried to move again. He managed to grasp the feeling of control again, tentatively but at least enough to feel like he had command of his own mass again. He rippled his skin, nothing too severe to raise his captor’s suspicions, a scared pulse of tiny spines shivered across his surface.
Sherlock continued to squirm happily underneath him as John relived the arousing memory in his mind. For Sherlock the memory was nearly as good as just bringing the toy itself out. John began to rock against Sherlock, providing as much friction as possible, further stimulating his mate’s already sensitive skin.
“Why not? They’re appropriate attire, you just saw other riders, workers, and nestlings in the same thing.” Sherlock said from the stall next to him, their voices echoing against the stone walls.
John caught a brief beat of happiness across the bond, stronger than normal due to proximity as they passed Hyperion’s pit again and John didn’t know what to really make of it and didn’t have time to ponder what would be causing the small surge of joy to bleed across the bond as they strode onward.
“Oh!” Mrs Hudson’s face lit up at that, all smiles as she forwent the usual handshake and went right for a light hug. John glanced at Sherlock over her shoulder and Sherlock simply shrugged the silent ‘she does that’ plain on his face. “Sherlock’s found himself a colleague, has he? Well come in, come in.”
“There is nothing wrong with me,” Sherlock insisted.
“I got here all by myself didn’t I?” And that settled it. John gave Hyperion a farewell nose rub, as did Mary, and they parted ways at the door.
, John’s mind drawled before the warm blanketing haze came back and he leaned into Sherlock. It was sloppy but warm and soft, and Sherlock seemed to be really putting everything he had into the kiss, lips barely separating from John’s only to relocate and suck at his lower lip, kissing that lip then shifting up and giving John’s upper lip the same treatment, holding John’s head in place the entire time.
“Maybe I just liked staying close by?” Sherlock looked up from putting his pants on at that. Apparently John had struck a chord with that statement, Sherlock cocked his head a little and stared at John.
John had him by the wrist first, then got to feel just how strong those lanky arms were as Sherlock swiftly twisted his arm to grab back and pulled John from his chair. John used the weight of his fall to drag Sherlock to the floor with him. His shoulder stung as Sherlock landed on him and began the short scuffle of grappling to get John to let go.
“The killer, who else? Now hurry up and send it” Sherlock said, setting the items aside as well before stripping off the gloves hurrying back towards his room.
I am so sorry that it took so long for this update, life got really crazy and hectic suddenly. I am working on the next chapter, I'm sorry I'm a bit of a slow writer sometimes. ^_^' I've just started back to college so that might have a bit of an impact on my writing, but I swear no matter how long it takes I will finish this fic.
“Dragons can be vengeful creatures without the presence of a bond grounding them.” Sherlock added before moving out of the light, leaving John to blink at the full sunlight painting a stripe across their armchairs.
“Good?” John nearly purred, kissing the corner of Sherlock’s barely parted lips. The dry skin shifted easily over the hardened core of his cock, foreskin pulling back with every slow thrust. Just the feel of it made John harden as well, a warmth rapidly building low in his gut that made him begin to gently thrust into nothing.
John got up and followed Sherlock’s wobbly path as he wandered around towards the front of the stingray tank. Sherlock’s fingers dipped into the water as he gripped onto the edge of the tank. John was thankful that he was slightly more sober than Sherlock in that moment as Sherlock suddenly jerked his hand away from the water in a wild flail, giggling at the ray’s fin that had brushed up against his fingers and come out of the water to flap over the edge a bit.
John nodded, now that Lestrade mentioned it he felt a pronounced ache in his good shoulder as well.
“How can you tell?” John said, looking at the generic paper bags, devoid of logos.
They were suddenly descending; all John could see were the lights of a city’s urban sprawl cut by sections of inky blackness until a turn revealed an industrial looking area below. Docks, with large warehouses and docked tankers, it became more apparent that the darkness beyond was water. They were somewhere on the coast, if they’d continued south, maybe Brighton.
“Commander Donovan told me to deliver this bag with your lunch, Dr Watson,” She said, after a momentary silence.
“Well I’m stuck here too, and I’d rather not spend the rest of my life inside an aquarium, so yeah the two of us together are going to figure this out.”
Sherlock didn’t appear to notice or care about Jim’s strange behavior, simply gave John a glance that said ‘I told you so’ and resumed his path back towards the back of the room. “Come along, John,” Sherlock murmured quietly as he passed him.
“I’m fine Sherlock,” he replied, as Sherlock slinked out of the tub.
“Prick me, I will bleed,” Sherlock said remaining quiet, his breath on John’s hair.
“Yes sir, I was a field medic Captain with the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers,” John replied, spine straightening at Sholto’s tone.
“You are more observant than I give you credit for,” Sherlock replied, making John smile a little at the sort of compliment.
“Hmm, how about this?” he asked, bringing his hands into play. He gently ran his fingers along the edges of John’s gill covers, teasing the edges, rubbing them delicately, smoothing his hands down John’s neck before doing it all again.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, looking a bit like a fish as he tried to form a comeback of his own and failed. He paused, seeming to collect himself again, then said, “Previous data led me to assume you took it. You are an outlier...”
“If you knew the morning I just had you would understand why I’m going to politely decline that offer.” John nodded at the chair, taking a step back when the other man decided to get up.
“Oh yes, just a wonderful experience,” John replied sarcastically, wrapping his towel around himself for some amount of modesty as he followed Sherlock down the stairs.
“You’re probably eager to get back home.”
John halts in the doorway, his grip on the box tightening.
“I think John here, should join my friend downstairs and bring some breakfast to your kind landlady.”
“I requested tea, detective inspector, not coffee,” ms. Alton scoffs and Lestrade finds himself shrinking a little on his chair. He needs to retake control of the room, so he spends a moment arranging the papers just so, making a show of shuffling a couple towards Sally Donovan and giving her a conspirator smile, even as he hears Sherlock’s annoyed huff.
“Can she tell us anything?”
“The day of my sister’s funeral I made a vow that I’d spent my  life and my fortune exposing the Alphas that think they can hide away in our society and blame their heinous crimes on some biological necessity. There’s a list on my webpage, with their names, addresses and an account of their crimes. You can go to my page and read the stories and then tell me what Britain’s biggest problem is? Is it economical decline, our skyrocketing unemployment rate, or is the Alphas responsible for hundreds of children who are going to bed, terrified because their fathers or uncles or brothers may open their doors and hurt them?”
“It’s a good thing we’re not Bonded,” John says. Sherlock looks at him, as if suddenly stung. His mind skips back along their exchange, wondering if he’s erred and how he needs to correct his mistake.
Sherlock asks, thinking that nobody else in the entire world would be allowed to give Mycroft a nickname, even their mother had to struggle all the way through to the last consonant.
Great, John thinks. He schools his features, the more she talks, the more she reveals.
But Sherlock just continues on, ripping John apart.  “Caring,” Sherlock spits out as if it’s a great insult, and John thinks dizzily, that to Sherlock it really is, “is not an advantage.”
“Should have known he’d interfere,” Sherlock turns to the nearest CCTV camera with a scoff. Percival Butterfield politely ignores this and instead turns to John.
“If I’ve not done this before, it might take a couple of tries to cut the skin because it’s an awkward angle to cut from.  My body, my elbow would block the spray of blood and thus leave the blood splatter marks we see.”
John cannot bother to unpack anything but his teacup, his laptop and his gun. The latter he keeps in a drawer by his bedside table.
“Are you hurt, boy?”
“Mr. Reese… ” John tries, attempting to sound reasonable, but suspecting that he is missing it by about a mile.  He thinks about Glen Reese’s Alpha, the man who had once towered over him in an alley outside the Student Union Pub and forced him to his knees. The man who would most certainly have raped him if Sam Milligan had not come to his rescue. Glen Reese is far better off without him.
John knows Mrs. Hudson well enough to recognize when she’s fishing for information.
The rain shows gives no sign of relenting and the time it takes John to run from Mycroft’s car, and across the road to Baker Street, is enough to leave him thoroughly soaked. He’s brushing the water off his jacket when he hears movement from Mrs. Hudson’s apartment. John pauses, cocks his head, suddenly suspicious. Mrs. Hudson is supposed to be on vacation, has the news of Sherlock’s return made her rush back to London, just like John did. He takes a step towards the door and picks up the sound of light steps against the floorboards. Defiantly not Mrs. Hudson.
“Oh, what a darling little lamb,” she exclaims, clasping her hands together.
“I think I might know what that is about,” John says and moves across the kitchen and pulls the newspaper out from its hiding place. All the while he feels Sherlock’s eyes on him, but the detective doesn’t say anything, doesn’t deduce John’s reasons for hiding the newspaper. He shoves it into Sherlock’s hand and then retreat to Sam’s side, hides his expression in his son’s curls as he places a brief kiss on the top of his head.
"No need to play coy," Andrew chides and taps the side of his nose as if he is about to part with a great secret. "I saw you staring at Ann Marge Sandridge all through Home-economics."
Lestrade looks puzzled, and Sherlock rolls his eyes.
“The attending physician was worried about head trauma when you weren’t able to tell him who our current prime minister is,” John remarks with a smile that crinkles the skin around his eyes pleasantly. Sherlock scowls, hiding his worry that he can’t even remember being admitted. What else has he forgotten? “You were, however, able to diagnose your own fracture and tell the doctor of his affair with one of the nurses in paediatrics.”
“Give me your phone.” Sherlock snaps his fingers. Why is Lestrade so slow, doesn't he know how important John is?
“Fine,” he grumbles, his nose flinching against the assault of the rancid odours of hospital food.
All victims of this mad game that they thought Moriarty was playing with them.
“Don’t be absurd, John, this isn’t a suicide,” Sherlock scoffs.  Before John can ask any other questions Sherlock strides off again, this time stopping outside a green door.  A little ceramic heart hangs on a nail in the middle.
“I have no idea what this is about,” Edward says, his eyes darting from the package to his lawyer. Her lips have grown very thin and very white.
Glen Reese tries to twist free, but John's grip remains firm.
“Interesting,” Sherlock says in a tone of voice that John has concluded he uses just to make people ask “What?”
When he opens the door, however, he doesn’t catch more than a glimpse of the picture torn off the wall. He cannot take his eyes off the hangman’s noose suspended from a hook in the middle of his office. The chair under it.
“Fine,” he grumbled, settling into the sand. “I technically stole her. Happy now?” He frowned up at her. She pushed Sherlock with her nose hard enough to topple him over.
John’s mind drifted to something less tangible. If only there were a case. A proper one, something that got Sherlock out and running around and grabbed his attention. For a brief second John secretly wished that the bomber from months ago would pop up again, there’d never been a conclusion to that mystery, only a postponement with the rescue of a victim.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock made the first move, John felt him reach out tentatively and touch his upper arm, just smoothing his palm up and down slowly. John mirrored him carefully reaching out and stroking his back. They gradually came together again, Sherlock wrapping John up in his arms like he was holding a large teddy bear, and burying his nose in his hair, just breathing John in. John had his arms wrapped around Sherlock’s chest and was just stroking up and down the length of his spine, feeling the slight ridges of scar tissue mapped across it. Sherlock was still shaking very slightly, a light tremor now and then that would increase just to the point of detection before he felt Sherlock clench and cut it off again. They lay there quiet and trying to relax for a little while, the darkness outside 221b only getting darker as the night progressed, with the whitish lights of street lamps providing only a faint glow into the room beyond the lamp.
Sally just climbed up into Melinda’s saddle, neither acknowledging the not even remotely sincere apology nor the spectacle of a rather large dragon shuffling about to pester the human between her shoulders. Melinda uncurled herself from her resting position and stood, stretching her wings which bore black patterning like a giant ink brush had roughly painted it on. She lazily approached Bellamy, stopping with Sally right next to Sherlock.
Bellamy’s wings flapped harder and she propelled herself into a graceful loop-de-loop that should have made John wish for it all to end, but the joyful adrenaline in his system thanks to Hyperion made him giddy and he let out a whoop instead.
They were talking. That was the best word John had for it, they were communicating as much as a dragon could verbally. John had seen others do it a handful of times so far in his time at the Aerie, had even read about it in his classes, but it was honestly something else entirely to actually hear and watch Hyperion do it.
“She was telling the girls at the table this morning, said ‘that new rider, he was bathing with his dragon and flashed me!’ the rest of the ladies got a real laugh out of it.” Tom affected a higher voice for the steward’s, laughing.
“Doesn’t feel so nice when I do it to you does it?” John asked coldly. Sherlock didn’t vocalize a reply and John let off a physical sigh, a light ripple of upset points going across his skin. He was tired of this; it seemed to happen far too often, Sherlock gets in trouble, John tries to explain why and get it through Sherlock’s thick skin that what he did was not good, they make up and the cycle begins again.
“I don’t keep anything particularly pungent anyway, many dragon species have sensitive olfactory systems, Ridgeback breeds among them,” Sherlock replied, sitting up with a pair of small pruning shears in hand.
She ushered the both of them inside to the small foyer. Sherlock made an attempt at going up the stairs, but she stopped him with a hand on his coat sleeve and a gentle word about how he looked skinny as a rail. With that she managed to loop them into having a bite to eat in her parlor. John sat and munched happily on the biscuits and nibbles and tea she provided while Sherlock kept glancing at the door after the first bit of offered food.
“Oh.” John looked down at the worn stone beneath his feet. That must have been awful for Jim; even with a partially solidified bond with Hyperion it had felt bad to be separated from him. To break that bond completely… a small tremor ran up John’s spine at the thought of it. The new revelation made a swell of pity form, clenching just below his heart for the poor man, the words “ex-rider” sounding painfully in his head.
“Yes,” came a deep rumbling answer, voice sounding just short of wrecked, hitching slightly when John gently tugged at his balls again.
“You’ve touched the most intimate parts of me,” John said simply, and right away he felt and mentally heard something like a gasp.
Hyperion inspected each container as it entered, sitting near the open doors and scenting the new additions, making sure there weren’t any ‘smelly things’ among them. It was one of the most active days he’d seen from Hyperion since they’d arrived at the Aerie. The dragon was up and hobbling around, going from sitting to following either Sherlock or the kids.
John huffed. “Dinner?” he asked, echoing Sherlock’s suggestion moments before, actually pushing away from the wall in an attempt to get them finally going in the proper direction for said meal. The sky at the edges of the canvas covering Bellamy’s pit had turned orange with the oncoming sunset.
Out in front, the van had been moved and, without the urgency of the hatchling clouding things, John noticed a couple other huge barns with even bigger open doors to either side of the large grassy area out front. A few dragons lay out in the grass, large balls of color with a few more people tending to each of them. There were halls sized for dragons branching out of the veterinary complex, but Mike showed John the main one that sat straight across the field from the barn they’d left. From there it was actually pretty easy because that massive hall led right to the main airfield and was not a very long walk away at all. Beyond that John just asked which hall was his and could find his way from there.
“Sorry,” John mumbled, unclasping one of his fists from his leg, his knuckles aching from being gripped so intensely, and bringing it to cover his face.
“You could have been stuck like that for three weeks and have absolutely zero clue how you got that way when you turned back,” Sherlock finished, glaring at John before he pulled on his trousers and toed on a pair of comfortable-looking trainers.
Sherlock’s eyebrows went up when he saw John return to him with the very different looking bags. “You bought dinner?” he commented, eyes going to the bags before shooting up to John’s grinning face.
“You don’t want to leave him do you?” A snort and nod indicated a yes, even without the almost overwhelming feeling of loss and wanting pushed into his head.
John signed at him, putting extra pauses between each letter trying to convey the idea to the frenetic fish before him.
Sherlock shifted behind him with a small hum, squeezing John slightly, like a cat stretching after a nap. John couldn’t help the a quiet laughter that escaped him as he felt Sherlock unconsciously grind his hips into John’s rear, a very stiff morning erection pushing into the curve of his lower back.
“Well hello there,” Murmured a gravely voice that sounded like it was right behind him, John didn’t have time to turn before something solid connected with the side of his head and his face slammed against the box he was crouched behind. And the world very suddenly went dark.
A shadow passed over them pulling John’s eyes even higher, away from the horrific flash of nightmare only to look up at another one. Silently above them soared Shaw, Moran’s terrifying dragon, his black form blotting out the sun as he flew by. In the time since John had first met Shaw he had tried to come to terms with the fact that he meant no harm, that he was a dragon just like any other at the Aerie, but the ingrained sense of fear and the animalistic gut reaction to duck and cover at the sight of the dragon shaped void in the sky was hard to break, and even in that moment, even though Shaw had only really just passed over them and continued on his way flying his own path, John still felt adrenaline kick in an looked for an escape route where none existed.
“Now come on, you know the drill better than me, clothes off,” John said, grabbing onto the bottom of Sherlock’s shirt and pulling it up over his head. He heard a deep chuckle come from under the fabric and once his head was freed Sherlock leaned forward and planted a kiss right on John’s nose.
John thought, ripping his eyes off the handsome sight and going back to Hyperion who was floating with his wings stretched on the surface, nestlings and workers already swimming around him and climbing on him to clean him.
Hyperion groaned with nearly every breath, large chest visibly heaving. John limped out across the sand to where Hyperion’s head lay, golden eyes wide and mouth open, huffing sand. He was trembling.
, John thought,
Thank you so much HiddenLacuna for betaing this chapter for me.
When his scarlet skin had been split Sherlock had instantly devolved from his human form and thrown himself upon John. John’s mind was shrieking in agony both at the injury and the horrifyingly violent contact the slasher had imparted on him by grabbing him before the knife came down. Sherlock kept John’s viscera from seeping out by plastering himself to him, literally using his own skin, paled with fear, as a bandage until help came.
“You’ll see soon enough,” she said enigmatically. The response didn’t do much to ease John’s nerves and the car turned a corner, entering the towering halls of the Aerie.
“I’d rather not be reminded.” Sherlock didn’t sound remotely happy.
Sherlock was already heading down the street towards the dragon hall at a brisk pace, coat billowing dramatically behind him. John rushed to catch up, Hyperion prodding at him, curious about what had John excited. They were quiet as they turned into the hall connecting the corridors, giving John the time to try to convey to Hyperion that Sherlock, the rider of the dragon across the hall, had something exciting going on and had invited John to join him. Hyperion pushed a combination of happiness that John was up and seemed happy and healthy, twisted with a slight worry over what Sherlock wanted to involve John in.
Sherlock slid backwards deciding to pursue more erogenous regions of John’s body. He pushed his knees between John’s, who parted his legs so Sherlock could kneel between them, and buried his face in the base of John’s cock,mouthing at the spot between balls and shaft. John’s breath left him at the sudden feeling of lips and tongue, oh yes that definitely felt good.
They sat for a moment like that, John just absorbing the comfortable warmth that only came from direct contact with Hyperion while the dragon himself continued to press contentment and praise across the bond. The only thing that pulled him away from the peaceful moment was the landing of one bright colored dragon nearby.
“This is how we can talk to you, make sure you are alright down here, and it works both ways. just pick up this little receiver and you can talk to one of us up top too.” He pulled a receiver on a long cable out of a little recessed spot on the wall and clicked the button on its side to show him how it worked.
“Mycroft. Holmes,” the man corrected in clipped tones. “Sherlock Holmes was my younger sibling.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked at Hyperion.
“Don’t give me that look, he was the one not holding on,” Sherlock said, shuffling forward to occupy John’s vacated seat.
“Yes, for Bellamy, and because you are as grounded as an overturned tortoise currently with Hyperion and I am still grounded with you she is not getting enough exercise that flying regularly would afford her,” Sherlock groused taking his long coat and concealing his riding gear beneath it.
Sherlock moved over and bent to give Mrs Hudson a hug and light peck on the cheek, “We’ll just be upstairs,” he said, going back to John and moving him towards the door and the stairs beyond.
“God! Fine, but Lestrade’s going to have my ass when he finds out you’re down here.”
John felt a small guilty twinge in his ribs, he didn’t really want Sherlock to go and part of him blamed himself for Sherlock’s sudden urge to get out of the flat even though it was cold and drizzly outside.
“Thank you, Master Stapleton,” John said in acceptance of the apology, even though he didn’t mind. They had been about to talk more about just exactly what Hyperion had been doing before John had found him and Victor, he would have liked to hear more before Mycroft interrupted.
“A mind palace, a way to organize thoughts and memories into a room in the mind.”
“Well, Greg did say he wanted the police in on this.” John said, even as Sherlock recovered himself and the surprise melted from his face.
In John’s reading he had found that during breeding, bonds could become heightened. In much more vulgar terms, the dragon’s rider would want to fuck as much as their dragon wanted to in the heat of the moment. Which was one of many reasons for why breedings were scheduled, regulated, and planned.
“Well, you started young, didn’t you?” John said looking over Sherlock, he hadn’t quite pictured him that small when he imagined Sherlock’s intellect making him rattle off deductions and say the rude things that got him in trouble. John’s mental image of that first serious case almost instantly skewed and rather than a tall, skinny, young adult with Bellamy at his side he began picturing a boy with a riot of black fluff for hair, no dragon, and a massive brain, who was rather isolated because nearly everyone around him disliked him.
“Practice with what?” John nearly stopped in the hallway at that, his mind could easily conjure up what Sherlock meant by that and it didn’t like the thought.
Sherlock removed a bottle of something brown from another cabinet and took a sniff of it, his face scrunching in a sour expression, before shrugging and replacing it. “Please tell me that’s not something rotten,” John pleaded, eyebrows bunching together as Sherlock continued going through his things and unearthed another jar of something that looked fuzzy and grey.
An idea popped into John’s head; he started to back away from Hyperion’s nose, carrot on a string to this particularly stubborn and hurt donkey. It worked: John eventually got far enough away from him that Hyperion’s only option was to break contact or take steps forward. The first step made Hyperion push his weight onto his injured shoulder and he quickly limped closer to John to take the weight away again. John continued to back away from the crate murmuring praises to his dragon as he limped along. Lestrade and his crew stayed nearby, guiding John towards the proper hallway. Lestrade sent Sally ahead to open the doors to Hyperion’s ‘pit’. They had almost reached the hall when Hyperion took a break, leaning against the corner abruptly, grunting loudly down into John’s face, eye’s pleading for the brief stop.
“Just get it over with, John, I’m tired of waiting. I’ve actually got things I’d like to do today.”
“One moment, here, come here,” John said, thinking back to the first time Sherlock had fucked him and how good this position had felt for him. He laid down next to Sherlock, condom clad cock still standing hard and thick in the air, and grabbed Sherlock, getting him into position above him. “There, now you control the speed,” John explained as Sherlock gazed down at him, the moment it took to reposition bringing back some of the sharpness to his eyes.
“Yeah, my leg.” He grimaced, reached down to massage the spot where it ached the most, knowing that there was nothing there but feeling it all the same.
John’s skin prickled for a moment in confused upset. He honestly hadn’t thought what he had been trying to tell Sherlock was so enraging that Sherlock would actively flush John from his skin. But as he watched Sherlock on the sofa become more and more yellow John could only surmise that it was anger at him that was fueling the change.
“You don’t look like me. Well, you are a tuna fish, but you’re not a
John sighed, resting his forehead against the glass for a moment. He didn’t hear the shower running. John looked over at the bed, black rope still on the headboard, discarded lube and condom, and the black blindfold.
Hyperion’s end of the bond stirred with curiosity, wondering about the thing that had John so confused and yet still somewhat excited. John tried to project to him an image of Bellamy and Sherlock, each receiving their own recognition of ‘Victor’s mate’ and an almost affectionate feeling, ‘Her.’
“He is my flatmate now, he asked me to help him with something. I’m not yet on duty and I’ve been led to believe I won’t for some time; was I not meant to leave?” John moved slowly into a kind of parade rest power stance, rising to the intimidation. A flicker of a smirk crossed the man’s face.
“Once, yes. I’ve been using nicotine patches for the last year or two. It’s a little hard to stick a patch to a fish though.” He sighed at that. “Ever since this hell started I’ve been wanting a smoke, but Mycroft will not give me anything including the patches, and technically it’s illegal to smoke indoors, one of those law things.” Sherlock sneered, scowling at the unicornfish still floating next to him, the fish choosing that moment to go darting away.
“No,” John said, leaning into him as they walked, linking their arms together in order to get just a little closer, “I don’t think so.”
Thank you Nautilicious for being my beta on this silly fic. :)
“Only you now,” John’s mind supplied with a chuckle, feeling Sherlock’s mind prickle slightly at the open thoughts mentioning previous conquests during such an intimate moment. “Have had you on all three of those planets too, my dear,” John added pressing down on Sherlock and giving him a tight hug. Sherlock’s mind bloomed with joy at that.
John’s eye caught on the dust motes floating where Sherlock had been standing for a moment. His mind caught on that mental image and hung it there before him in the dust as though he were still sitting there watching bodies hit the brush and dirt. Everything went very quiet, their relatively calm banter stopped. In the back of his mind John could feel Hyperion’s worry like a call of
He learned that she and a couple of other nestlings lived with a keeper by the name of Mrs Turner, who sounded a bit like Mrs Hudson. Mrs Turner’s dragon was apparently a short, fat, swampy green piebald dragon with one light blue eye and a white blotch that looked like a bunny if you squinted hard at it, it liked to sleep on Mary’s feet at night ‘cause her feet got cold and the other children’s didn’t. John had actually wondered where the nestlings all lived, considering nearly every time he’d seen them they were being herded along in a large group like little blue-clad sheep.
They rounded yet another corner and came to a halt in a large hexagon-shaped area. Each of the six walls were covered with the facades of tall houses, as opulent as though they’d been plucked out of high-end neighborhoods around London and plopped down there. There was a roundabout and a massive pillar in the middle with a white dragon statue atop it. They stopped before a simple yet elegant house with pale bricks, white pillars, and a stark black door. It had no overflowing flower boxes or lush green lawn like its neighbors, just a wrought iron fence with a small gate, sterile in comparison to the houses around it.
John thought that it suddenly felt very much like he was dying; the pain was everywhere all at once and it left him gasping into the rough metal grating of the steps. He was reaching for his phone to dial 999 when another stabbing spasm rocked him and the phone slipped from his fingers, clattering away.
, dreamy like a crushing schoolboy.
John’s legs still felt about the consistency of jelly as Master Lestrade led him away. The continued exposure to the cool night air helped clear his head some after the stressful ordeal of the flight, but it would still take some time before he would feel like he wasn’t about to collapse. He looked back at the open crate where Hyperion was still curled and dozing. John didn’t want to be separated from him again; if anything, in that moment he wanted to plaster himself to his dragon and never let go. Lestrade seemed to notice his hesitancy and once they were out of the clutter of people, moving things about like ants dismantling a newfound biscuit, he turned with him to watch as they began coaxing Hyperion out of the container. The dragon groaned lazily but obeyed as Aerie staff helped him uncurl himself a bit, letting him stick his long neck out and get some cool fresh air to bring him around. John got a dimmed projection of happiness from him as he took in fresh London air; John had almost forgotten this was Hyperion’s home as well where Hyperion had been born and raised. The Aerie was more his home than it was John’s; it may be in London, but the Aerie itself was alien territory for John.
“John, my John,” whispered a soft baritone.
“You’re just looking for an excuse to get her out of her pit,” John chuckled, taking his mind off of the bond.
She did eventually leave, but not until after the tannoy warned that the Aquarium would soon be closing. In the meantime John quickly darted away and up to where Sherlock was drifting, nudging him and trying to get his attention to look over at the window. If Sherlock got the message John didn’t know it as he continued to drift until the time to change came.
“Ma’am we don’t usually keep em,” the rough voiced man said, sweeping the torch torturously over John again. If John could have formed up a mouth at all he would have begged for him to turn the damn bright light off.
John finally stepped in to save Sherlock from himself. “Sally, he has to look at that shoe closer, the person who called in the bomb threat specifically asked for him to solve it,” he said calmly, immediately breaking through a little of the tension between the trio just by talking.
“Okay?” John repeated back to Hyperion, reaching up and touching the closest bit of him he could reach, the rear leg that carried the most severe of his injuries.
“Of course,” he replied shifting on his feet in front of her, “I can go out into the Aerie now, right?” He felt ready to leave the constricting ward.
“What does it matter?!” He seemed to realize he’d raised in volume and suddenly quieted again.“What does that matter, why would they talk about it? They don’t experience it, they never form one, they might talk about it and you never know because they are a tiny percentage of the population. Do you go around talking about obscure details from your medical textbooks?”
John thought sadly, watching the gentleness of a creature he had never seen in any circumstance beyond being used in war or as pack beasts. He secured the body, Hyperion watching intently the whole time.
“Okay, Dr. Watson, we’ve leveled off. Everything is going to be fine and smooth from here on out, just relax. If you want to talk at any time you know where to find us,” the voice on the other end told him calmly. John rolled onto his back, still panting and shivering after the panic; it was going to be a long flight.
