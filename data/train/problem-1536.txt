John cautiously lift up the duvet to see if he can see Sherlock's crotch, but the light's not good. He tentatively reaches a hand under for a quick feel. Sherlock grumbles in his sleep and John pulls his hand back swiftly.
Love is a funny emotion, Sherlock. And not that easy to spot, even for someone, like myself, who has been in my profession for decades... and even a master or deduction like yourself. It's because people are too good at fooling themselves when it comes to love. I can't tell you the number of clients I've had who had thoroughly convinced themselves... and me... that they were very much in love with their partner, only to find out they weren't. Or, others who were so in denial that they couldn't see how deeply they were in love with someone.
Sherlock quickly turns it off and then lies down next to John, looking at his face with interest and concern.
For the record, John, arguments don't just conveniently arise in the comfort of one's own home. They are liable to happen whenever and wherever they please. Come on Rosie, you and I are going to the biscuit aisle. I think we both deserve it.
Okay, don't get yourself too worked up over Rosie. She seems plenty well-adjusted. The adults of the household on the other hand...
John adds a hand to Sherlock's erection, squeezing and stroking lightly. John's other hand roams Sherlock's thighs, stomach, and chest. Sherlock leans back against the shower door, accepting John's touches.
Sherlock disappear with Rosie. John stands in the middle of the aisle and looks up at the ceiling and groans in exasperation. His fellow shoppers give him the stink eye. He grabs the pink My Little Pony potty and tosses it in the trolley.
Sherlock concentrates on his work, his eyes ping-ponging between John's groin and his face, attempting to measure John's reaction and adjusting accordingly.
But when he spies mustached John sitting at the table, Sherlock’s confidence falters, his shoulders sag, his smile falls, and he grows nervous about the reunion.
Stationed outside all twenty possible venues at the ready to take pictures of every single patron picking up tickets over a five day period? Yes, yes I did.
When you pout like this, it only makes me want to shag you silly, Sherlock Holmes. Now move over. That's an order.
John glances at Sherlock, who is still lost in thought. He returns to face Mrs. Hudson with an uneasy smile.
I see nothing wrong with the apparent imbalance in your relationship, then. Brains and empathy. Head and heart.
John rummages through a rack of trousers, picking up a pair and inspecting it uncertainly. A SALESCLERK (20's, mod haircut) approaches.
Yes, well, if you try hard enough you may recall these two. One a dapple-gray, the other a bay. They were constantly together.
John picks up the smaller dildo, observes it closely as he flips it on and off, then replaces it carefully. He types into the laptop, conducting research on it with a serious expression on his face.
I was forced to tell my friend 'I love you' so that she would say it back to me. At the time, my sister Eurus --
I don't want to lose him, Audrey. I've lost so much already in my life. I can't afford to lose him by making the mistake of telling him how I feel.
Sherlock leans down to kiss John, but John has moved away, circling to Sherlock's back. Sherlock hangs his head in frustration.
Sherlock kisses both of John's ass cheeks and then moves to kissing along John's cleft. John gives out little appreciative moans. Sherlock finally reaches John's hole and gives it a lick.
She pulls out a manila envelope from a file and opens it. She spread several large photos on the table. The three gather around.
But, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought goldfish were your type? There was Anthea, and then your other assistant, I forget his name. Lady Smallwood probably came the closest to your IQ level--
It does! Can't go about cheating myself out of two months or giving myself two additional months by mistake. This requires precision, Molly!
I was so sure he was in love with me already. All the evidence was there. Apparently, I was very wrong. So stupid of me!
Sherlock returns to kissing John, who eagerly reciprocates. All of a sudden, Sherlock breaks off the kiss, and his mouth is firmly back on John's cock without missing a beat. Within the very next beat, Sherlock's forefinger has slipped inside John's anus. John gasps at the new sensation, which is not as unpleasant as he expected. Sherlock works the finger in a little deeper, causing John to moan. Sherlock moans back.
As I was saying before being rudely interrupted, I paused all research in that area because it didn't seem immediately relevant to my life. Until today.
John licked his lip nervously. "And if anyone starts feeling the slightest bit... overwhelmed," he said, "We'll stop."
Mycroft studied the doctor dubiously for a moment, but then simply left with a nod. Sherlock, finally resigned to stay seated, rubbed his head and blinked, disoriented. John stood over him once again, his expression deadly serious.
Sherlock's cheeks pinked as he briefly looked down at his trusty black suit and his new cranberry button-up.
I remember being utterly knackered and you telling me about a case. I think I fell asleep partway through.
The perfect position for eye contact... touching... talking... being able to see what's going on. All so important, isn't it, Sherlock?
Well then, I need to tend to some things down in my lab and Lestrade sent me information on a promising new case, but I'll come back up for Mrs. Hudson's visit... I'm sure she'll bring biscuits.
Okay, okay. I've obviously struck a nerve. I'll go see if Mrs. H is available. You don't seem to be in the right frame of mind for contending with a small child.
Rosie darling, you've had your fill of biscuits. But maybe you are hungry? John, may I take her to the kitchen for something healthy?
Sherlock frets about what to write. He starts to write WONDERFUL and then backspaces it. Then tries writing OK but shakes his head and deletes it. He settles on: LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
John, if you really don't want me to know that you use my bed when I'm gone, then you ought to remember to turn off the baby monitor when you leave.
John plops down in his armchair, glaring at Sherlock. Sherlock, busily texting, ignores his surroundings. Mrs. Hudson watches John and Sherlock with growing concern.
John stopped short again and turned back around. He wished Sherlock didn't look quite so attractive with the breeze blowing his curls just so.
I'm... surprised. I mean, every time I see the two of you together, you seem like a snuggly couple. Very happy to be in each other's presence.
Sherlock looks beseechingly at John who now has other things on his mind. Lying back, John watches Sherlock through heavy-lidded eyes and with a randy smirk on his face. John's hand drifts down to lazily stroke his own cock.
You insisted on sleeping on the sofa, I tried to make you comfy with a blanket and a pillow, and you kissed me and said "Thank you Sherl".
But John realizes something is wrong. He looks at Sherlock's penis in alarm, as Sherlock slowly loses his erection.
Three, keep half an eye on John Watson who might behave erratically in his current despondent state.
Sherlock sighs impatiently and rustles through the side table drawer until he finds it, and squeezes some lube on the gloved hand.
You're right, John, there's no way I could have known that, although I always suspected it. Thank you for the confirmation, however.
I’m happy to get this out in time for the holidays. Happy Holidays, everyone. I hope to have the next chapter for you February 2021.
On Wednesday, Sherlock offered to pick up Rosie from the nursery and bring her to the library, which is where John met them after getting off work. He arrived and discovered that Sherlock had found another single father of a toddler to flirt with. John was all courtesy and pleasant smiles while in the library, but as soon as they stepped out on the pavement with Rosie strapped in the stroller, he became surly and pouty, refusing to speak or even look at Sherlock. Sherlock took it as a very good sign—perhaps there was merit to Irene's hypothesis that Sherlock flirting with others would help John come to his senses. But alas, John's sour mood did not last. Within ten minutes, John had shaken himself out of his funk and was conversing with Sherlock as if nothing had happened.
Sherlock Holmes, I will make you come tonight, if it is the last thing I ever do. I don't care how long it takes. Now, your job is to stay in the moment and not let your heart rate race away again. Do you understand me?
Sherlock. Look. You are a recovering intravenous drug user who has spent more than enough time in seedy drug dens. And I... well, I have had a million relationships, as you so kindly pointed out. I am afraid it is quite necessary.
Irene (clothed) strides in and regards them with a smirk and a glint in her eye. She takes a seat facing the sofa.
John begins stroking his prick with more conviction while he gingerly spreads Sherlock open internally with his two fingers. Sherlock's breath comes a little faster.
Sherlock wipes away a tear. John looks pretty choked up as well. There are a few moments of John quietly holding Sherlock.
John, you are so hard right now. I do believe you are enjoying this... I best move us onto the sofa before you nut.
He stops himself, realizing what he's about to say isn't strictly true anymore. The clerk waits patiently.
Rosie is eating breakfast while John hustles to get the rest of the things in order for school and work.
Sherlock breathes erratically and clutches at his chest. John finally turns and notices. He rushes over to him.
Mrs. Hudson! I'm afraid you are mistaken. It's John that's in love with me. Not the other way around.
Sherlock bustles about the room turning on the monitor, grabbing the Union Jack pillow and a throw blanket. John starts to snore.
You know, it would be handy if I had a drawer in your dresser for some of my things... pajamas and the like.
Only because you keep dodging the questions. So here's a very simple, very direct one: have you texted Irene Adler, at all, while you and I have been in our current relationship?
Rosie rolls out of downward-facing dog and giggles. Sherlock smiles at her, but is soon distracted by John doing yet more stretching that showcase his backside nicely. Sherlock sighs with longing.
Sherlock ensures that the dildo maintains contact with John's prostate. He continues lightly stroking John's erection and leans over to lick some pre-cum from John's tip. John's cock twitches against Sherlock's mouth.
I am aware of your schedule, John. What I am trying to comprehend is what exactly you are doing in here at the moment.
Sherlock exits through the kitchen. John rests his elbows on the coffee table, apprehension on his face, as he watches Sherlock leave. John repacks, buttons, and zips his trousers and leans back on the sofa with a heavy sigh. His gaze falls on the violin left on the coffee table. He stands and picks up the violin gingerly. He walks it over to the case lying below the window sill. He pauses to stare out the window for a moment.
I won't be available to play nursemaid to you Sherlock. I have work and a daughter to tend to, you know.
Yes Sherlock, really. It was a lot of work trying to keep you two from destroying yourselves and anyone else -- and still there was a body count! Magnussen, Mary... And suddenly Eurus threw a spanner in the works, and I didn't know what would happen to any of us, anymore.
Sherlock obliges, picking up the pace of his strokes: from tip to base, and back up. John moans loudly.
He, in fact, had already lined up a sitter, choosing his favorite from the list John had accumulated (with Sherlock's careful vetting) over the past year of the Watsons living at 221B Baker Street. Lupita was a strict-but-caring-grandmotherly-type who was serious about her job and didn't engage in any unnecessary chatter with the parents and guardians of her charges. Sherlock respected a person who didn't let frivolous chit-chat distract them from their work.
Sherlock's hand reaches around and lightly caresses John's bum over his trousers. There's fire in his eyes.
Mary and John stand before Sherlock and Mycroft on the tarmac by a small plane. Some security officers and vehicles standby. Sherlock is about to board the plane, on what can only be considered a suicide mission.
I'll, erm, just go collect my pajamas from your bedroom. There's a book in there I've been meaning to retrieve, too.
Sherlock bends his knees to make room. John sits down heavily on the sofa, leaning his head against the wall.
Someday it would be nice for you to have a little brother or sister... I don't know exactly how that would happen, but it is nice to have a sibling. Even my sister. Even the Eurus, Mycroft, Sherlock trio.
John looked up at Sherlock who now stood, forlorn, just a few feet away. John was buoyed by a sudden upwelling of courage.
NO CUZ LAST TIME YOU COMPLETED IT IN 5 MINS. THE STAFF DIDN'T APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTIONS FOR "IMPROVING" IT EITHER.
"Fine. Ah! Here's our drinks. Thank you, dear." Sherlock simpered to the waiter while John bristled at his side. Sherlock took a quick swig out of his glass and stood up, adjusting his outfit.
He begins lathering up John's hair. John closes his eyes with the pleasure that only comes with someone else washing your hair for you.
Ack! Love, Mrs. Hudson! Can you imagine? Me... in love? What on earth am I supposed to do about it now?
Oh yes, Scotland Yard already has a suspect: a first year uni student, international student, from Cambodia. But they haven't been able to pin anything on her yet. That's where I come in. She's clever this one. She does this trick where she changes her shoes at the crime scene... well, half a block from the crime scene. Cheap Chinatown shower slippers. A different pair every time. It makes it impossible to follow her footsteps as she flees--
Rosie continues to pull Mycroft to the sand pit. Mycroft sits down carefully, not wanting to get even his running clothes sandy. John joins Sherlock's side to watch Mycroft and Rosie begin building their castle.
Yes! I knew it! See, I told ya? That wasn't just some random snogging in the park I witnessed the other day.
John looks up from his book and glares at Sherlock. Sherlock smirks impishly from behind his book and continues reading.
Sherlock stalks out of the room and John lies back on the bed, massaging his erection as he waits. It doesn't take long; Sherlock returns in a flash with the bag, searching it for exam gloves. He finds one and dons it, and promptly climbs back on the bed.
Sherlock makes a move to bust past Audrey into the house, but Lestrade restrains him by placing a firm hand on his shoulder.
- Sherlock carries a cardboard box around the kitchen. Mrs. Hudson points out all the laboratory equipment that he needs to add to the box. He adds things reluctantly.
"It's okay then? It'll work?" John asked anxiously, fussing with his shirt, and glancing down at himself.
Audrey furrows her brow with concern and waits patiently for John to elaborate. They continue their walking before he finally does.
Sherlock hurries down the steps and across the pathway, texting furiously. John follows, but stops at the bottom of the steps to squeeze some lotion out on his hands. He sniffs it again and rubs it into his hands. Sherlock turns to John.
I hated myself. I was so tired. Hopeless, really. Utterly hopeless. Despairing. Especially about us, you and me. I didn't dare hope - that hope had died.
"What? That was the deal! We take turns. I need to keep my eye on the bar now, which isn't possible when I'm on the dance floor and—"
John's mouth falls open, gobsmacked. Sherlock grunts in annoyance and goes to an antique wardrobe and pulls open the doors. Irene and John, not wishing to be near each other, stalk to opposite corners of the room and watch Sherlock intently. Sherlock begins picking up sex toys and equipment, sniffing them each individually. John is clearly uncomfortable by all this.
It is indeed raining. Rosie is happily stomping in mud puddles on the dirt path. John stands nearby holding an umbrella over his head. Sherlock stands under a tree trying not to get wet. John shoots him a "I told you so" look.
We've been friends for over a decade now. Been through quite a lot during that time. That'll affect things.
John is relieved these two are acting civilly towards each other. Rosie climbs off John's lap and onto Sherlock's lap.
Oh, but you are! A single father, recently widowed with a dramatic backstory... a war veteran even... who is also an amiable, good-looking doctor who can pay the tuition on time? Come now, John.
Right, that. Me kissing you, not so casually and not exactly consensually... very bad form on my part... that may have mucked things up beyond repair already. I'm afraid there's no going back to the way things were, now. The kiss is out there...
Certain actions, specific gestures... tell-tale facial expressions... I know when someone is in love with me. It's not that hard to tell --
Okay, then. Are you sure you two want to pursue this relationship considering your history together?
John carefully pulls down his pajamas a bit to free his erection. He reaches for the lube on the side table, and squeezes some out on his hand.
NOTE: This case is based on the original Arthur Conan Doyle story "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot".
Ohh, our little visit to Ms. Adler's... Yes, now it's all perfectly clear. You were inspired by her collection.
Sherlock and Lestrade stand on the porch and ring the bell. Sherlock impatiently rings it a second time and Lestrade rolls his eyes.
"Easy! Easy, Sherlock. Back down you go," John said, having to restrain his friend a bit more this time around. John looked over his shoulder at Mycroft.
Sherlock complies, trying to steady his breath, recovering. John leans over him and peppers his face and neck with small kisses.
Sherlock felt himself deeply affected by John's words and was glad for the support of the solid table behind him. Perhaps undressing John would help distract him from the strong emotions Sherlock didn't know what to do with. He tugged the shirt cleanly out from John's jeans. Meanwhile John began working on Sherlock's top buttons. Sherlock slipped a hand up under John's shirt and caressed his belly, reveling in the softness and warmth of John's skin. His fingertips raked through a patch of hair that began at John's naval and continued south; Sherlock hummed in appreciation. John, whom Sherlock had long ago deduced was a man aroused by visual beauty, had unbuttoned Sherlock's tight burgundy shirt, and was openly admiring his bare chest.
Sherlock strides down the path. He spies Molly and Nazir on a park bench, possibly the same park bench where he and John had their initial relationship discussion.
John, alarmed, hesitates but then puts his hand on Sherlock's arm to keep him from placing the next toy back in the bag.
Oh, you know, certain small things to make John's decision to move back to central London a little easier... a transit fare hike for only the outer boroughs... ensuring Rosie got into that school... and, oh yes, didn't he get a bit of a promotion around that time period that required some late evening hours, too? Hmm? How handy to have a flatmate to help with child care.
"We need that booth over there," Sherlock told John, pointing to one in the corner, "So we can watch both the dance floor and the bar. Claim it before anyone else does. I'm going to take a quick tour around the room to get the lay of the land."
No, that's NOT what that kiss was for. That kiss was some sort of test. What, or who, you were testing... I'm not quite sure.
But it's getting harder and harder to believe that the two of you aren't an item. Really, your body language alone --
They do when they don't want an electronic paper trail. Her body was found bleeding out on an ottoman rug. But something's off. When Nazir and I checked under the rug for clues, there wasn't a second stain on the floor.
Yes, I'm either a "complete machine" or "a bit overly-sensitive" as people are fond to point out to me. Frankly, I think it makes me a better detective. But, let me be clear, I'm under no illusion that we have the exact same level of sexual attraction to each other.
Sherlock yanks open the drawer and quickly dons a glove. He lubricates it and positioned himself behind John again. With his right hand once again grasping John's cock, Sherlock slips his left gloved hand down John's red pants and positions his fingers at John's arsehole. Sherlock moans deeply as he inserts one finger all the way in.
John sets Rosie in her booster seat and gives her some blueberries to tide her over while he makes the waffle batter.
of those are better than how I respond to you flirting with other people," John grumbled, gesturing to his current dejected self. Sherlock couldn't help but feel bad for the man.
"Why not?" John exclaimed, "You'll either end up going home with multiple dates, or get thrown out for being a perv, that's why!"
It's hardly necessary, Dr. Herscher. Mycroft already knows everything. And my life is routinely splashed across the newspapers as well as John's blog.
Imbalance in the relationship... yes, I may be able to relate to that. I suspect it's that Lestrade can't keep up with you on an intellectual level.
In the middle of the dance floor, Sherlock has deduced that Mary is pregnant. The Watsons are understandably flabbergasted and panicking.
Look, the cashier just tossed them in the bag and said "you'll be needing these". I would have inquired more but I sensed I had outworn my welcome at the sex shop. And I would have done my own research, but after the afternoon with the little SVT episode...
Slowly and carefully, that is. And I'm not sure I'll be able to take the whole thing... I don't have a lot of experience in this area.
Rosie sits in her booster seat banging with a spoon and picking up pieces of dry cereal with her other hand. John is cooking at the stove.
"Which would you prefer, dear?" Sherlock turned and questioned John. John's eyebrows shot up in warning but Sherlock gave him a "remember we are undercover" look and John rolled his eyes.
John enters the bathroom. Sherlock lies in bed, eyes opened, listening to every noise from the bathroom and hoping John doesn't sneak out the other door.
Sherlock snatches the pajama bottoms out of John's hands and tosses them in the corner as well. He grasps John's wrists and pulls him closer.
God bless Mrs H for renting you the basement for your experiments, 'cause Rosie toddling around teething on decomposing toes and spilling cyanide all over the place wasn't going to happen.
Holmes, don't tell me these things. I don't want to hear about you breaking into people's accounts... I'll feel compelled to report you.
Always! Although I've seen him pick up Rosie from school a couple of times in his pajamas... it's either one extreme of the other. I bet he's never worn a pair of jeans in his life.
It is a bit of a tough week for the fellas at 221B Baker Street, as they contend with their deepening feelings for each other.
John gets Sherlock situated under the duvet. He stands over him, observing his sleepy form for a moment. It is probably for the best that Sherlock can't see the very soft look on John's face. John heads to the bathroom to wash up. Sherlock yawns again, sighs, and settles into sleep.
In the dim light, John peers at his satisfied face in the mirror. He sighs with contentment. Not wishing to make noise, he opens the door to Sherlock's bedroom slowly.
"Well, they'll just have to do. As for footwear, something a little fancier than loafers would work... have any dark boots?" Sherlock asked as John grew anxious again. He knew for a fact John did not. Sherlock didn't want to cause John too much worry, but better the man fret now
Sherlock resumes stroking John's penis in his red pants, matching that perfectly with the in-and-out movement of his gloved fingers, pulling halfway out and plunging back in over and over. John can't help letting some moans escape in the process, knowing his backside is going to pay for this tomorrow. His pleasure builds quickly.
"I'm done here," Sherlock announced over the loud music, “We'll get our coats and I'll text the club owner in the cab. Let's go."
"That one I found in the back of the closet of the upstairs bedroom," Sherlock disclosed as he took blocks out of the crate for Rosie, "On a high shelf, carefully wrapped in several layers of tissue paper."
Rosie takes the book and begins paging through it. Sherlock turns to gather up a fresh nappy and wipes. He spies the red pants still sitting on John's dresser and grimaces.
You might not remember the details of the day... I sometimes put more significance on events than the average person --
John walks in to find Sherlock deep in thought in his chair with his feet propped up on the laundry basket. John signs, not wanting to disturb Sherlock, but he needs to fold the laundry. He gently tugs the basket out from under Sherlock's feet.
Oh, I see. You come to me because I happen to be an expert on unrequited love. That's actually quite cruel, even for you, Sherlock.
Sherlock approaches John, gently takes the bag from him, and walks over and puts it high up on the bookshelf where short people can't reach.
Sherlock is sprawled out on the sofa, on his phone. He can hear John descending the stairs and looks up expectantly. John enters the sitting room and walks over to the sofa.
Are you always this discreet with your clients, Irene? It's a wonder you haven't been sued into oblivion already!
John, we can't both be in denial about potential heart problems, that's hardly fair to Rosie, and furthermore--
Sherlock waits for John's breathing to settle and for John's eyes to close with contentment and exhaustion. Then, only then, does he lift his head from John's torso, and slowly remove his two fingers from John's bum. With expertise, he carefully removes and disposes of the glove. He grabs the container of wipes John has bought for them and cleans his hands.
They both face forward on the bench during the following conversation (with little or no eye contact), sipping tea, with their lunches unopened on their laps.
John sighs and wanders off to join Rosie playing in the sand. Mycroft and Sherlock stand side by side and observe John and Rosie.
Three hours, you say? Must be lunch time then. I'm a bit peckish. You rest. Rosie and I will fix it. She's already helping herself to the fruit bowl.
John continues to stroke Sherlock's hair soothingly despite Sherlock looking more and more agitated.
She has been lurking in the back of your mind for weeks, ever since we took her case. Let's get this out in the open, John. I do not want Irene, do you understand?
Let's start with your childhood... genius diagnosis, I don't doubt that... but this "high-functioning sociopath" stuff is bupkes.
John does so, and Sherlock kneels on the bed directly behind him. Sherlock notes that the lubricant is already waiting on the bedside table for him. Sherlock generously lubes up his right hand and plunges it down John's red pants, wrapping his fingers around John's hard prick. John responds with a gasp but does not let words escape. Sherlock strokes and strokes, setting a steady pace up and down John's cock. Sherlock presses himself against John's arse. His left hand snakes down the back of John's pants caressing said arse, massaging it, grabbing it. His thumb runs up and down John's cleft and circles and presses against John's hole.
Rosie takes Mrs. Hudson's hand as they walk towards the door. Mrs. Hudson looks over her shoulder at John and Sherlock in their respective chairs, staring at each other uncomfortably.
They might not have crossed Sherlock's mind either. I hope you don't mind me saying, but he's a quirky guy. Perhaps this non-arousal doesn't seem odd or out of the ordinary for him... until something like a serious relationship brings it to light.
Sherlock stares anxiously at his phone while John takes a moment to respond. His reply: NO PROMISES. BABIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE
Molly Hooper strips off her mask, gown, and gloves and washes her hands thoroughly, humming pleasantly to herself. The door swings open and Sherlock walks in.
With one final hip thrust, John ejaculates all over Sherlock's lips and hand. It spills onto his own belly and the sheets. Sherlock turns off the vibrator but otherwise holds his position while John pants and comes down from his orgasm.
One year, Sherlock. A year to figure out that you've been in love with John Watson since your first meeting here in this very lab. I know. I was there. I never stood a chance, did I?
Cocaine, specifically. And most of the victims are not habitual cocaine users, and none of them know each other. The only common denominator between them all is... me.
John helps Sherlock shuck off his shirt. John walks over to drop it in the laundry bin and pulls open one of the dresser drawers. He selects a dusky purple t-shirt. Sherlock watches John closely over his shoulder.
It means someone moved the body, or the rug, or both. And I want to know why. What else was the attaché hiding?
"Rosie finally, finally went down for her nap," he announced as he rubbed his face with parental exhaustion, "But not without a fight. That's toddlers for ya."
And I'd like ten minutes strung together of relative peace and quiet, but that's impossible around here!
No, no, no. Granted, I've spent many nights on this sofa and know it's serviceable... but you... you, my friend, are a man who craves routine... and creature comforts. This will never do.
Brace one of your hands on the headboard, John. I want you to have one hand free to play with yourself.
We'll plan to delve into that another day, shall we? Now... as clever as you are, you know very well that expressing and dealing with your feelings is challenging for you; therefore, you are drawn to those who are naturally compassionate and empathetic.
Inspector Lestrade smiles uncertainly in the vestibule. Audrey and the teacher glare at him. Rosie and Dorian are in the background playing in the classroom.
"Why don't you and Rosie come by next weekend rather than a whole month from now? Perhaps we could decide together where to display the ashtray."
Sherlock grins knowingly and returns to looking into the microscope. Molly and Nazir shoot awkward glances at each other. John watches them, as confused as ever.
John, every time I see Sherlock looking at you, he looks like he either wants to shag you or be shagged by you as soon as humanly possible.
Sherlock, you need to give it some time... some time to fall in love or figure out if you’re already in love, perhaps. The relationship is not very old, after all. Maybe only a month or so...
Of course, John, of course. Nonetheless, if you are open to the idea, I would like to lend you a hand.
"Flat is fine, luv," John replied. The waiter nodded and headed to the bar with their order. Sherlock hoped John hadn't seen the color in his cheeks when John had used the endearment "luv" on him. The man was only play-acting after all, Sherlock reminded himself.
Sherlock closes his eyes briefly as if those words have stung him. He wishes he can take back all the times he complained of things being "boring."
He woke with a start in an airplane seat. The first thing his eyes focused on was John, standing over him with a look of concern. Mycroft and Mary were not far off, with similar anxious expressions on their faces.
The emotional component... the romantic aspects of it, you could say. Perhaps causing me a bit of anxiety and prompting me to run off.
Lotion bottles litter the table top. Samples have been tested and analyzed: some still give off smoke and fumes. Sherlock looks into a microscope. John, arms folded, stands nearby watching him.
John, before we begin, you must know a few things. It is very hard for me to get an erection, even harder for me to maintain it, and extremely difficult for me to reach orgasm.
John pushes Rosie in the stroller to the front door while trying to shield himself from the rain. They enter the building and John folds up the stroller.
John rests his head on Sherlock's chest, with one ear listening to Sherlock's heartbeat. He glides a hand across Sherlock's torso, caressing him with his thumb.
You look bloody amazing like that, Sherlock... wanking off with streams of water running all down you.
Lestrade stuffs half a scone in his mouth and follows up with a gulp of coffee. He gives Mycroft a simpering grin.
It's either a very clumsy or very overwrought way of going about framing someone... why only attack a third of your clients? Unless that third is rather well-heeled or otherwise targets of blackmail?
John blushes. Sherlock looks away, realizing a bit too late that he may have overdone it with both the "amiable" and "good-looking" qualifiers.
John can only nod. Sherlock does it again a few more times with equally favorable responses from his partner. He pulls his cock almost all the way out and plunges back in deeply and fully.
John bends over Sherlock with a smile and kisses him heartily, licking the inside of Sherlock's mouth with an insistent tongue.
John stops outside the door, pulls out the scratch paper from his pocket, and confirms that he has the correct address. As he is about to enter the shop, he spots some handbills and flyers in the window. He taps on one for the London Symphony Orchestra. He takes a pen out of his coat pocket and scribbles down some notes. He pockets the pen and paper and enters the shop.
Rosie is asleep on the sofa with the bear and bee close by. Sherlock silently and carefully places some chair backs towards the sofa so there’s no chance that Rosie will roll off. Satisfied with his safety measures, he turns to look for John. John isn’t there, so Sherlock noiselessly makes his way to the kitchen.
Sherlock enters and closes the door behind him. John smiles and pulls him under the water stream and plants a big kiss on his lips. Sherlock runs his hands over John's wet skin.
Sherlock holds John tighter and is too flattered to speak. After a moment, though, a dark look of self-doubt crosses John's face.
"Yes, but... I still want to try," Sherlock replied, trying to keep the pleading out of his voice. John stood up from the booth and smiled fondly down at Sherlock.
I think I've made my intentions for tonight abundantly clear... dropping not so subtle hints all day long, John.
Sounds like it has to do with either astronomy or the Hollywood film industry. Neither are my strong suits, I'm afraid.
But it would be helpful if someone in the British government with international connections knew about it so that he could ensure that these contaminated cosmetic products are taken off the shelves before they poison thousands of unsuspecting people.
Then Sherlock makes short work of undressing John. He finishes by taking off John's reading glasses and giving John a kiss.
If YOU ever felt jealousy you kept it under wraps... okay, so maybe there was the occasional snarky comment to my girlfriend's face... or you showing up in the middle of my dates now and then, although half of those were case work and the rest I simply chalked up to some weird kind of fomo.
Yes, I'll make it simple for everyone. I'll stop my sessions with you. No need to bother John with any of this. He started working with you first, after all.
than just Sherlock's eyes. The bloke began monopolizing Sherlock as they danced, grinding up on him and touching him excessively. Sherlock really wasn't enjoying it; however, he used the situation to his advantage by positioning their dancing bodies so that he could observe the bar without being seen, although it also unfortunately blocked his view of the booth where John sat. When Sherlock could catch the occasional glimpse of John, it only made Sherlock's heart pang unpleasantly:
Well, I'm no walk in the park either, Audrey. With PTSD and anger management issues, I've taken my frustrations out on him a handful of times, quite painfully I'm afraid. I'm not proud of it, but they've happened.
John is getting wet under the shower head. Sherlock peeks over and around the shower door to spy on him.
"Your plane took off, and within minutes it was turning around again and landing. Mary, Mycroft, and I boarded and you were gibbering on about some cold case involving a Victorian ghost woman killing off horrible husbands..."
Did it ever occur to you, dear, that I might be getting too old to be bringing your tea upstairs every day?
It was a bloody disaster the last time it happened, don't you remember? When you faked your death, the two of you were a complete wreck. Then you returned to London only to find him with Mary... and when you and John were thus reunited but NOT permitted to be in the same paddock anymore... Lord, that was somehow even worse!
I've known you for ten years. I know when you're sad, John Watson. I may not be good at expressing my own emotions but I can certainly recognize them in others with reasonable accuracy.
Oh, I heard something about that, about the dead attaché. Didn't know about any stolen memos. Like real, paper memos?
"I couldn't take it with me," John started, then stopped abruptly. Perhaps that would be enough of an explanation for the supposedly brilliant detective.
"I was nearly destroyed the first time you died," John said, his voice low, "What would become of me the second time, Sherlock?"
"It should probably be yours, since you're the smoker," John stated, offering it up to him. Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock presses more into John and strokes John's cock with both hands. He grinds his own erection against John even harder.
If you must, John. Let me at least switch on the baby monitor for you... and get you some sort of blanket.
John stands, places Rosie on his hip, and moves all the dishes (except for Sherlock's) to the sink. Sherlock scrolls through his phone while finishing his breakfast.
A buzzer rings, a door opens, and Mycroft and Sherlock enter quietly. Eurus, behind thick blue-tinted glass, sits motionless on her bed. Sherlock and Mycroft approach the glass. Sherlock gently puts down his violin case.
John shrugs. Sherlock narrows his eyes and slowly walks around the room in full detective mode. John watches him nervously. Sherlock picks up the shopping bag off the floor.
Sherlock turns and looks quizzically at John, but John is already hurrying out of the room. Sherlock and Irene share a look.
Is it time to schedule another date night, Sherlock? Hmm? Spend some quality time together? I believe it's your turn to pick the venue.
Audrey is helping Dorian get their jacket on. Rosie and her TEACHER stand in the vestibule watching.
Sherlock taps away on his computer, deeply involved in a case. Over the baby monitor (which was accidentally left on), Rosie begins crying. Sherlock pauses his typing and listens, in case he is needed. But he soon hears John talking too, so he ignores the noise and gets back to work.
John cuts off. His brow furrows as he stares at Sherlock's wrist, indeed feeling Sherlock's elevated pulse. John cautiously peaks up at Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock looks frankly scared to death (in the best possible way). John's gaze settles on Sherlock's lips.
Both men get quiet for a moment. John looks away and sits on the opposite end of the bed, his back to Sherlock.
Sherlock was rendered speechless: his head reeled with far too much emotion and far too many narcotics.
After the short kiss, John smiles and takes the towel out of Sherlock's hand. Sherlock tries to grab at John's wrist, frantically and repeatedly. His antics amuse John.
Ah, yes. That Charity Shop smell. I recommend spraying them all over with vodka and letting them air dry. Acts as a deodorizer.
John grabs the door jam behind him to brace himself and to keep his hands off Sherlock. Sherlock resumes his onslaught of kisses, being merciless with his tongue. He pulls John roughly to him by his waistband and has his hands down John's pants in a flash.
John is asleep in his chair. He wakes up with a start and checks his watch. He gets up laboriously and walks to the kitchen archway.
That much blood, it should have soaked through the carpet and stained the wood floor underneath... quick, hand me my phone.
John puts his mouth around Sherlock's cock again. Sherlock cries out in response. John eagerly continues.
Sherlock catapults down the steps two at a time. Mrs. Hudson opens the floor to her flat and Sherlock busts past her.
With a free hand, Sherlock reaches over for the container of lube, drizzling it onto John's erection. Sherlock begins working his hand up and down John's shaft all while maintaining the shallow thrusts in John's anus with the dildo.
Mild angst. Apparently, people have a lot to say on the subject of love... it's a long chapter. Smutless.
I believed I was in love with her when I planned to propose to her. But you popped back into my life and I wasn't so sure anymore. Then there was a wedding and a baby on the way, and suddenly she was a deadly assassin who had just shot you, and I didn't know what to think or feel.
Sherlock huffs out a breath and straightens his suit jacket. He smiles at Mrs. Hudson and picks up a biscuit to dunk into his tea.
He returns to his position with his right hand firmly planted near Sherlock's left elbow. John's left hand reaches down to gently stroke Sherlock's erection. Sherlock sighs in contentment.
They all start down the sidewalk together. John is flanked by Sherlock pushing Rosie on one side, Audrey pushing Dorian on the other. John smiles pleasantly at them, alternating between Audrey and Sherlock. Audrey and Sherlock, however, look slightly embarrassed.
It is the same when two very independent people embark on a relationship. It isn't healthy for one person to orbit around the other, as if one is the center of the other's world. Nor is it common that the two orbits sync up perfectly, moving in tandem. Instead two mature souls that have learned to live independently... who have created their own unique orbits... now must find a way to live together sharing a common space, common interests, and yes, eventually a common love. They still maintain their own identity, but they are, as you said earlier, "intrinsically linked."
For starters, we'll need to decide if this little interaction we just had was a one-time thing, or something we'd like to continue in the future.
Sherlock gingerly climbs into bed. John turns off the lights and gets in on the right side of the bed, pulling the duvet over both of them. He settles in, lying on his back.
Do you mean to tell me that at the exact moment I finally held you in my arms, you were deciding there was no hope for us?
And you underplay it! You believe you and Rosie are marooned on this sad little island, when in actuality you have people all around looking out for the two of you: Mrs. Hudson, myself, Audrey, even Mycroft in his own inscrutable way. Why don't you try letting people into your family, John? It's not that hard.
John shudders and cries out, squeezing around Sherlock's cock as he orgasms. John's climax triggers Sherlock's as well. He wraps his arms around John's torso as he empties himself into John.
Yes, but this isn't casework. This is different. Like you're contemplating life's biggest mysteries or something.
John let's out a surprised and grateful laugh. Sherlock is pleased with his decision: this small joke, this final gift of laughter between John and himself before they never see each other again.
This is a whole chapter of “porn with feeling” with some flashbacks to when Sherlock talked John into moving back in to 221B Baker Street. So, I’ll put a SMUT ALERT on the whole chapter.
Or maybe not. Ms. Adler certainly took care of your virgin situation for you. But I know, Sherlock, that you still retain certain... "hang-ups" when it comes to sex.
The problem is that I AM too much. Much too much. Too demanding. Too convoluted. I am constantly scaring off my paramours. Even Lady Smallwood, despite all her complexities.
Rosie squeals and runs into the sitting room. She spies Sherlock in his chair, squeals again, and begins climbing all over him. John peeks into the sitting room to see what's going on.
Now, if I'm keeping track, I owe you an orgasm. And if you permit me, I'd like to ride you, just like this, until you come and come and come, Sherlock.
Mmm, you are. You've avoided tasting your own semen, perhaps you also dislike the idea of tasting another man's as well.
Sherlock, obviously surprised by this, sits up and takes notice. He texts back eagerly: ANYTIME IS FINE I'M HERE ALL DAY
When Rosie gets a little bigger, the sitting room can be reconfigured and a section made into a sleeping area. In fact, it appears it is being used for such purposes right now.
At long last, the tedious stakeout paid off when Sherlock spied a short, dark-haired customer sneak behind the bar and plant a playful kiss on the cheek of the behatted bartender. The bartender immediately shot an apprehensive
John sits at his desk and checks his mobile. There's a text from Sherlock. It reads: COLLECTING ROSIE AT REGULAR TIME -SH
John rolls his eyes knowing Sherlock has probably already solved the case and is just toying with him.
Sherlock knows he can't intrude on this sweet couple and their newly-found love. He turns around and moves away quickly.
John licks his lips nervously and reaches for the lubricant. He squeezes some out on his hands. He kneels at Sherlock's waist and inhales deeply in preparation. Sherlock observes him closely the entire time. John delicately wraps his left hand around Sherlock's penis.
John marks a trail of ridiculously sexy kisses from Sherlock's navel up to his neck. Sherlock is utterly flustered. If John has noticed Sherlock's use of the word "love", he certainly isn't letting it show.
Just listen to the whole story, please Sherlock. Now, when Lucky and Thistle were put in the same paddock, they would settle down and be fine. I say "fine", but those two horses would still nip at each other, their ears flattened back... they annoyed one another to no end. But being near each other was infinitely preferable to the alternative. Frankly, it was better for everyone that they were together. Far less noisy, certainly.
"You stay here," Sherlock said. But when John looked at him anxiously as Sherlock began to walk away, he added, "I'll be right back." He returned with flannels for both of them to clean themselves up. The men silently adjusted themselves and their clothing, although Sherlock didn't bother to button up his shirt: there seemed no reason for modesty after the experience they'd just shared together. They sat side by side on the sofa, sated and worn out. John reached over and rested a hand on Sherlock's forearm. It occurred to him that John had insisted on near-constant physical contact with Sherlock ever since they’d started kissing in the dance club booth—as if now
Still, it seems it is time we gave up our habit of you bringing me my tea. I will miss it dearly. The tea and the company. You keeping tabs on me.
John walks out the door while Sherlock, Nazir, and Molly fall to discussing how to conduct their experiment on the arm. Molly catches sight of John leaving, and gets a worried look on her face. Molly nudges Sherlock.
His stroking increases in frequency and pressure, his hand closing over the tip of his cock and sliding roughly down to the base over and over. John's body begins to shudder; he moans quietly, rhythmically, with the intensity of it all. All too soon, John's orgasm comes fast and hard.
John approaches the reception desk with a smile. VIVIENNE (a decade older than John, female, any ethnicity) gives him a terse smile back.
John carefully placed the ashtray back into the box. Then he gazed down at his hands in his lap. He sniffed hard to stifle the rising wave of emotion. Sherlock continued to build towers for Rosie.
Sherlock comes, loud and long. John doesn't let go of Sherlock until he's spilled the last drop. Even after, John lays his head on Sherlock's chest, reluctant to leave his side. Sherlock slumps against the shower wall, completely spent. John washes his hands carefully and proceeds to soap up his own body.
He froze. He turned and found Sherlock standing close behind him. John thought he spotted Mrs. Hudson gently shutting the door to 221 Baker Street in the background. Sherlock took a moment to gather himself together before speaking.
And if you do a good job with your dinner, we'll go find a biscuit at my place. Your father won't mind.
So hot. So slick. So tight. Your long sexy legs wrapped around me.... I couldn't hold myself back... God! Brilliant.
Please inform your father that it is high time for a potty chair. This is getting ridiculous. Not to mention stinky.
finally having Sherlock, John never wanted to let him go—and Sherlock feared he might melt into a puddle at this realization.
Rosie gave out a cry of joy upon spotting a crate of building blocks that Sherlock had stowed under the table for her. Sherlock bent down to help her retrieve it. John returned his focus to the cardboard box where something shiny immediately caught his attention. He carefully pulled out a crystal ashtray. It made his breath catch. Sherlock glanced over.
I don't wish it to happen with Gregory. I am trying very hard to be, as they say, "low maintenance."
Er... yes, trying to find trousers... erm, ones that are tighter than I normally wear. Tighter than these I have on, anyway.
John carefully inserts a finger in Sherlock's anus. Sherlock moans deliciously. With concentration, John slowly moves the finger in and out, eliciting more delighted sounds from Sherlock.
You think you'd remember something like that... rather memorable and out of the ordinary for one of your clients, is it not?
John wakes up with a start. Sherlock is still wrapped around him and sleeping heavily. John tries to peer under the covers a bit, but isn't happy with what he sees.
Eurus goes to retrieve her violin. Sherlock and Eurus begin their duet and Mycroft quietly sits down to listen.
Sherlock rushes off. Mrs. Hudson looks around and starts picking up papers and wrappers off the floor.
John, in a suit, sits at a table by himself. He looks around worriedly. He pulls out his phone and texts.
John can't fight it. Sherlock matches his stroking to John's cock thrusting into his hand, building up more and more. John can't take it anymore. He bites off his cries, moaning loudly through his teeth as he comes, wetting Sherlock's hand and his pants with his cum, squeezing deliciously against Sherlock's fingers in his bum, and making Sherlock moan in appreciation.
It boils down to this: I find you proper fit, as the saying goes. You find me less so. End of story.
"It was the day you were being banished to Eastern Europe after shooting Magnussen," John began, "Do you remember?"
Warden Harper, could you ensure that all recording devices are turned off in this waiting room while we are occupying it?
So Audrey, I am incredibly grateful for you taking in Rosie this evening after I was regrettably detained...
It was true, Sherlock admitted to himself: there was amble evidence of this phenomenon, stretching back over the course of John’s and Sherlock’s decade-long acquaintance. For one, John had nearly blown a gasket over the Adler case (obsessively counting Irene’s text alerts and everything), and
He receives another text from Nazir, reading: FYI HOLMES HAS CALLED ME JOHN 5 TIMES TODAY. A RECORD. THINK HE FANCIES YOU, MATE.
But not every day, mind you! We'll call it my semi-retirement. Let's have you come twice a week. Pick two days, Sherlock. Let's have a proper schedule.
Audrey and Dorian walk away down the sidewalk. Rosie starts to fuss out of boredom. Sherlock digs in the diaper bag.
"Look. Whatever you wear will be fine, John. We'll go Saturday night at 9pm before the crowds arrive," Sherlock explained quickly and calmly, "I'll arrange a babysitter for Rosie and everything."
I'm sure your purpose will reveal itself eventually, John. Bumbling into the key to the solution, isn't that your forte?
Have an erection? Yes. Well, half of one now. I was trying to take care of it before you interrupted, thank you very much.
He didn't mean it as a flirtation—it was the truth after all, and he merely meant to help his friend feel better about himself—nonetheless, John got a little red in the face. Sherlock found it utterly captivating, and he really,
Sherlock, relaxing on the bed, hums in agreement. John picks up the large dildo that they didn't use and inspects it.
Sherlock winces and closes his eyes, in preparation of the inevitable. John stops pacing, realizing something is wrong, but doesn't know what.
I don't know exactly why he hasn't said it back to you yet, Sherlock. I know it must be disheartening. What was his reaction when you told him you loved him?
It's admirable how you've tried to tackle all your addictions at once... I know it hasn't been easy, Sherlock.
Of course you're not. I know you'll need to discover it on your own. All I can do is nudge you in the right direction from time to time.
Sherlock watches the front door of the Medical Center intently. Nazir eats lunch, leftovers out of a plastic container.
If you prefer that I find live subjects, I'm sure Bill Wiggins can rustle up some volunteers for us.
Just the art fencing one... and the one with the carpet stain... and the one with the fairy lights spelling out a death threat...
John ups the ante by grinding his arse into Sherlock's groin. Sherlock nearly swoons. Using his hand as guidance, Sherlock reinserts his cock into John's hole. They both gasp at the pleasurable sensation this new position provides.
I wouldn't peg you as one to fall for the ol' Iceman persona hook, line, and sinker. I am capable of being hurt, you know.
John rises up on his toes, places one hand on Sherlock's shoulder to steady himself, and tentatively, gently kisses him.
Sherlock, carrying Rosie, rushes after Angeline and Mica. John wanders over to Audrey. Audrey has a questioning grin on her face.
Like I said, Sherlock. It's a lot. There's probably a thousand other things I've not thought of, as well. Each one of them warrants a discussion... although usually not all at once. Relationships tend to evolve over time, you know.
He spies Sherlock sprawled out on the sofa, tapping away on his phone. John settles into the adjacent chair.
I liked you experimenting on me, too... and as much as I liked it, you gave ME the surprise of my life by letting me experiment on you, Sherlock. Twice even. To have you ask for it twice in one day... Lord, so greedy, Sherlock. So delightfully greedy.
I'm totally kidding Mr. Holmes. I know, I know. How unprofessional of me. But I'm old and don't care anymore.
John steps right up to Sherlock and glares angrily into his face, while making a grab for Sherlock's wrist.
John's hips snap up. John's cock thrusts into Sherlock's hand and mouth. Sherlock has to focus to keep the proper positioning of the vibrator on John's prostate as John writhes beneath him.
it was significantly better, and Sherlock had just commenced an experiment that involved flicking an inquisitive tongue into John's mouth when John let out a wanton moan. Sherlock desperately wanted to find out what else he could do to evoke more wonderful noises from John. He also wondered what it might feel like to touch John's skin under his shirt, and tugged lightly on John's tucked-in top.
The Watsons said their goodbyes and descended the steps. Outside of 221 Baker Street, John buckled Rosie securely in the stroller and adjusted the diaper bag strap across his chest. They made it about five steps up the pavement before John heard a voice behind him.
John strokes Sherlock's rock-hard penis more firmly while massaging his prostate more intensely. Sherlock buries his head into his forearms in preparation.
"Sherlock, I apologize. I am really, really, sorry. I don't know how it happened." John looked absolutely scared to death.
Are you thinking Madame Imelda brewed a concoction to kill her clients? But why would she kill herself then?
The middle child often has to carry the emotional weight in the family... You're a good brother, you know that, Sherlock.
Sherlock sits in his armchair scrolling through his phone. Rosie can be heard upstairs singing a rain-related nursery rhyme at the top of her lungs.
John fidgeted in his chair. Sherlock regarded him with an assessing but patient expression even as he continued stacking blocks. Those ice-blue eyes gave the distinct impression that they would wait all day long for John to elaborate.
John, whether reading Sherlock's body language or deciding it was time to reciprocate, reached over and began to undo Sherlock's trousers. Sherlock reluctantly let go of John’s arse to give him more access, but maintained a firm hold on John's erection. Due to Sherlock's stance and the customary tightness of his trousers, there wasn't a lot of room to work with, but John solved the conundrum by pulling Sherlock's entire package over the top of his pants. Sherlock sighed at the freedom of movement, but the sigh turned into a gasp of surprise when John began playing with his cock in earnest. Sherlock grasped the edge of the table with his free hand and let out a reedy cry.
Pardon me, Doctor Watson, but you are being a bit inconsistent with your diagnosis. A minute ago, I no longer needed monitoring but now my supposed heart condition precludes me from travel.
Sure. Meet us downstairs. It'll take us a while to get our raincoats on. And don't forget your umbrella.
Some arts event? An evening lecture series? John, it will take me all of ten minutes to scroll through the London events calendar to find it.
John plops her in her booster seat, wipes off biscuit crumbs, and sets down her breakfast. He hurries back to the counter to continue packing up.
As I am right-handed, I will need it for the... delicate work... so I will put my left hand at the base... firmly?
John sits cross-legged on the bed with his reading glasses, typing on his laptop. Next to him is a towel laid out with a row of sex toys carefully lined up by size: small butt plug, larger plug, small vibrating dildo, large dildo.
Nope. So, she can take on any walk-ins. She has to be here, clinic regulations require a peds specialist to staff the clinic hours. But you, my friend, are superfluous.
"Your nail polish is lovely!" Sherlock cooed at her. Flirting with women wasn't strictly necessary he knew, but he felt it would be good to exercise his flirting skills whenever the opportunity arose. The woman smiled coyly and said thank you. John rubbed his forehead and muttered "Jesus" under his breath.
I abandoned you for two years, of course you would find someone new to spend your time with, but I had no idea how much it would affect me, seeing you with her.
Anyway, nice surprise seeing you home... we aren't often home alone in the middle of the day together, you know? Could be fun...
She sets down the files. She looks up at the ceiling in thought for a moment. She takes out her phone and dials. Someone picks up at the other end.
John lifts his head to look down at him. Sherlock continues to gently stroke John internally, while working steadily on John's cock with his mouth. There's no way John is calling it off now. The pleasure he is receiving on both fronts is too great. John can't remember the last time sex felt this intense. He can feel his orgasm building quickly.
Before John knows it, Sherlock is on his hands and knees straddling John. With a wicked little smile on his face, Sherlock begins kissing John passionately, gently exploring John's mouth with his tongue. John, at first in shock, takes a moment to respond. Soon he closes his eyes and hungrily returns Sherlock's kisses, touching tongues lightly, then more forcefully. They have never kissed so intensely, and they are both savoring every moment of it. John's hands fly to Sherlock's waist, skimming over his round bum. Sherlock slips a hand up John's shirt to explore his chest and torso, which evokes a hearty moan from John.
I brought you a veggie lasagna. I had it in the freezer.  All this cheese might not be good for someone with a heart condition though...
When he doesn't get a response, he walks over to open the door to the landing and calls down the steps.
Oh, yes, I heard some of that, too. You must count your blessings, Sherlock. To have a man that virile, and at his age, too! Believe me, dear, I can relate. My husband was the same way... ten years older than me and well into his sixties still wanting it three, four times a week. This one time --
Sherlock extinguishes the light and snuggles up to John. Sherlock nuzzles against the back of John's neck, giving little kisses.
Sherlock reaches for the lubricant and squeezes some on John's hand. Then Sherlock possessively slides his hands across John's hips and stomach. John grasps his own cock and begins stroking it from base to tip.
Sherlock seeks out advice on his love life yet again. He finds himself looking inwards and discovering that his sentiments for John stretch back farther than he realized.
He settles back into his chair and takes up his book again. Sherlock tunes up and begins playing his violin.
Starting up a relationship like this changes a friendship. Irrevocably. There's a very good chance it will muck it up completely.
John squeezes his eyes shut, mortified. Sherlock pauses and stands a mere foot away from John, facing him.
But the truth of the matter is that I left you, and you chose her. I had to accept that. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to endure. My only condolence was that you and Mary allowed me to be in your life to some degree. You let me be involved.
John enters in pajamas, looking like he's just woken up. He doesn't find Sherlock in the kitchen so he peeks his head in the sitting room.
But did you really need to be such a drama queen about it and give yourself a heart condition over it?
Sherlock responds with a long, deep, satisfying kiss. Sherlock repositions himself to lie on his side next to John, propping himself up on an elbow so he can get a good view.
John smiles at them and walks towards Sherlock. Sherlock doesn't look happy getting rained on. John beckons for Sherlock to come join him under his umbrella. Sherlock does so. John brushes raindrops off of Sherlock's coat and hair.
Sherlock nods. John slowly inserts a finger. Sherlock releases a breath with pleasure. John begins probing while continuing to stroke Sherlock's cock. In this position, his eyes are close to Sherlock's face, and he can plainly see the ecstasy in Sherlock's expression.
John, Mrs. Hudson, and Rosie are decorating the Christmas tree. Holiday tunes play in the background. Sherlock sits in his chair, bouncing a leg idly as he watches the scene.
Sherlock curls his body and reaches up to give John a deep kiss. It catches John by surprise, but in the best possible way. When the kiss is over, Sherlock's head flops back on the pillow and John continues to plow into him. John doesn't have the concentration for experimenting anymore: desire and instinct have taken over and his thrusts come more quickly now.
John idly plays with Sherlock's hair while they are both lost in thought. John's eyes suddenly fill with emotion. He exhales an erratic breath.
John looks away self-consciously. It registers that she didn't merely say "go spend time with your daughter"... she said "family".
A cosmetics firm as a cover for a cocaine processing plant, sounds pretty handy, don't you think? An unexpected raid causing them to dump their illicit product INTO their benign products...
John starts down the hall towards the kitchen, but stops. He turns around slowly and approaches Sherlock's bedroom door. He opens it cautiously, and peeks in. Sherlock is not there, of course, but the bed looks very inviting. John stands at the door for a moment, looking wistful.
John walks out of the bathroom, naked. (They red pants are now in desperate need of a wash.) He contemplates putting on some pajamas, but decides he'll sleep naked tonight. He gets in under the covers carefully, as to not wake Sherlock. It doesn't work.
Glad to hear it. She's very good. She was my mentor, in fact. I daresay she's brilliant, in a no-nonsense sort of way.
You are having second thoughts about where our sex life is taking us... It was never my intention to push you into anything you don't want to do. We're moving too fast, is that it?
But, in the end, somehow you and John found your way back to living together at Baker Street with only minimal interference from me--
And so, when Irene texted, I knew that if at least one of us were happy... if at least one of us could find love... then it would all be okay.
John grasps Sherlock's sleeve to stop him, to make Sherlock face him. He searches Sherlock's face for a response.
Sherlock's wraps his fingers around the base of John's shaft and delicately licks the bell-end. John moans in response and Sherlock's full mouth is on John's prick in the next moment, giving him a slow but hearty suck. John grabs onto the sofa cushions to brace himself. Sherlock switches gears, methodically and persistently working John's erection over with his tongue. His fingertips massage John's bollocks through the fabric of his pants. John closes his eyes and lies his head back against the wall with pleasure. Sherlock rests a hand on John's thigh and John places his hand on top of Sherlock's. John's other hand softly caresses Sherlock's head and hair. Sherlock's head bobs up and down as he licks and sucks at John's penis, intently -- gently but without mercy. Sherlock's eyes cast up at John's face, gauging John's facial expressions and responses.
"Why am I..." he raged, before squeezing his eyes and mouth shut tightly to bring himself back under control. Sherlock watched the transformation of his friend's facial expressions through bleary eyes. When John's eyes opened again, they were filled with sorrow.
John nods, remembering. He casts his eyes around the kitchen in thought, not quite able to meet Sherlock's eyes.
-Mrs. Hudson sits in John's chair with Rosie on her lap. She reads Rosie a picture book. Sherlock and John cuddle a little on the couch as Mrs. Hudson reads.
All right, but it must be a right, stout English castle like Lindisfarne or Bodiam... no "princess castles" like Neuschwanstein, this time. It's simply out of the question. Understood?
We figured it was a double homicide at first, but we've only found one weapon, so it must be a murder-suicide.
The world had beaten me down. Mary's death. My infidelity to her. I was completely failing my daughter. You were trying your best to destroy yourself. I nearly helped you succeed in that by beating the shite out of you in Culverton's morgue.
He considers for a moment what to do. He then carefully untangles himself from Sherlock's embrace without waking him, and quietly enters the bathroom.
So soft and cozy... but what's going on underneath those jumpers, that's what's always intrigued me, John. I've always wanted to see.
I want you in my room even on my bad days, John. Especially my bad days! That's when I need you there the most. Why don't you just sleep in my room every night, good and bad, so I don't have to keep begging you day after day like a pathetic fool. It is so tiresome.
Sherlock and Rosie begin to look under the sofa. John, amused by their antics, returns to cooking in the kitchen.
"Well, you were high as a kite at the time," John pointed out, "So there may be large swaths of the day you may have missed."
And every time you shake it my way, I want to strip off your trousers and do soft and naughty things to you for hours and hours, Sherlock.
John begins to thrust rhythmically into Sherlock, slowly at first. He braces himself on strong arms. Sherlock wraps one hand around John's bicep, and the other reaches up to softly cup the back of John's head. Sherlock bends his knees and hooks his long legs behind John's strong thighs possessively.
Mrs Hudson isn't answering for some godforsaken reason... John apparently is in surgery and can't be reached... you said Lestrade is on his way?
Here we are. This is where my clients spend the majority of their time when they are on the premises. But I also spend quite a bit of time here as well, and I haven't been mysteriously exposed to cocaine.
Sherlock closed his eyes and his own memory kicked in. He recalled a trip to his mind palace: a very interesting one involving John and himself, and an incident at a waterfall in 1894. The Reichenbach Falls. Moriarty. A struggle. An unexpected rescue.
Sherlock lies on the sofa, reading on his computer. John walk in the room with a laundry basket. Sherlock looks up at him.
John smiles at him again before disappearing into the kitchen. Sherlock watches as they collect their things and prepare to leave. John and Rosie appear in the archway again.
Now shut up, you. No more talking. You must keep your focus. Where was I? Oh yes, onto the sofa now... so much to do on the sofa.
Number one: you kindly inquired and I should at least dignify it with a response. Number two: After utterly destroying the trust of every member of my family by keeping the existence of Eurus a secret for decades, it is time for me to extend an olive branch and make amends. And if I must accomplish that by divulging personal information about myself from time to time, so be it.
Now that was interesting, Sherlock thought. He tapped a finger to his lip. The cogs in his mind began to whirl.
John leaves the flat. Sherlock gently puts down Rosie. He collapses into his chair with a huge dramatic sigh. Rosie, in attempts to copy him, laboriously climbs onto John's chair, plops herself down dramatically, and mimics his sigh. Sherlock looks over at her with an amused smile.
I've been watching you tend to me for the last twenty minutes with what I can only imagine is an extremely painful hard-on, Sherlock.
John is speechless at this. He walks over and sinks into his chair. They both look at each other with a mixture of shyness, affection, and nervousness.
Sherlock shudders and curls as he comes hard, squirting his and John's chest repeatedly. John watches with amazement and satisfaction. Sherlock begins to whimper.
You're supposing she's an herbalist, but no. Herbs weren't one of the healing services she provides... I mean, provided.
Mrs. Hudson admires her handiwork at tidying up the sitting room. She sets a teddy bear for Rosie on John’s chair. Sherlock enters looking clean and dapper in a suit. Mrs. Hudson clasps her hands in approval. Sherlock notices the teddy bear. He ducks out of the room again and returns with a plush bee toy. He sets it on the chair next to the teddy bear. Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock gaze at the inviting chair with the toys. Mrs. Hudson pats Sherlock’s arm affectionately.
Sherlock reaches up to give him one more luscious kiss, and John returns to business. His thrusts are deep, strong, and fast as he approaches orgasm. He grunts on every exhale. Sherlock moans and holds on with a steel grip.
have to both flirt and watch for suspects in equal measure, but it was a balancing act Sherlock was sure he could manage. It was time to get to work.
there had been the whole debacle over Sherlock's fake engagement to Janine. Even when Sherlock was on the receiving
Sherlock continues to hold John tightly to himself as both men pant out and recover. Finally, Sherlock rises gingerly.
John gets up and walks over to stand before Sherlock. He gives Sherlock a quick peck on the lips and then gives him a long hug. Sherlock takes a moment to relax into John's hug before hugging him back.
Mycroft opens his briefcase and takes out a large red bag of Maltesers. This gets her attention. She places herself directly across from Mycroft; he holds up the bag to her.
"Yes, yes. You both look very nice," Lupita said with an annoyed bobble of her head, "Have a good time. Say goodbye to daddy, Rosie." She was obviously
Mycroft sighs and walks over to the hatch once again. Before placing the small packet inside, he pops two more Maltesers in his mouth. Sherlock shakes his head in mild disappointment at Mycroft. Eurus retrieves the smaller packet and adds it to her stash under her mattress.
Sherlock presses up against John as he continues to wash and then condition John's hair. Sherlock's erection begins to poke into John's belly. John holds onto Sherlock's hips and sways against him as his own erection grows harder, too.
I'd very much like to try these out on you John. Experiment. Perhaps write up a detailed report after.
John pulls Sherlock up so that he is sitting next to him on the sofa. John places a hand on the side of Sherlock's face and kisses his mouth amorously, exploring it tenderly with his tongue. After a moment, Sherlock breaks off the kiss and closes his eyes as he leans his head against John's head. He needs to catch his breath.
Let yourself be in love, Sherlock. Enjoy it. Go on some dates. Have a good time together. And for God's sake stop fretting about it.
Greg Lestrade and Mycroft Holmes sit across from each other at a table, sipping hot beverages (coffee for Lestrade and tea for Mycroft) and having scones. Greg is somewhat distracted by a television in the corner playing sports highlights.
Sherlock nods in understanding. John rubs a hand across Sherlock's chest and rests it above Sherlock's heart, checking for an irregular heartbeat. Sherlock can't help smiling at John looking out for his health.
The room was too hot, the music was too loud, the dancers had become uncoordinated with alcohol and who knew what else, and Sherlock Holmes was not having the best of times. However, occasional glances over at the booth showed John having an even worse go of it: frowning moodily into his drink and generally looking very cross with the world. The surprising thing was, there seemed to be a segment of the gay population who found middle-aged malcontents irresistibly attractive, because on three separate occasions club-goers had approached John's booth to chat him up. John eventually shooed them off, although there was one burly fellow in leather who seemed particularly keen on getting John's attention, and Sherlock had resisted the urge to pull himself out of the dancing crowd to come to John's rescue.
"I'll have to go through it when Rosie and I come next month," said John, "Although, I believe some of those items really belong here at Baker Street."
And I regret losing you as a client. You've made great strides with your addiction and recovery over the years. I've watched you grow as a person, tackling your emotional issues. I'm very proud of you Sherlock.
He breaks off, totally distracted by the glimpse of the red pants on the dresser. He shakes his head to refocus on the diaper-changing task at hand.
Sherlock sets a steady pace, mouthing and licking John's prick while gently probing John's interior with his finger. John marvels at how the anal fingering enhances the pleasure of the blowjob to an incredible degree. And the fact that Sherlock is the one providing all this pleasure makes John's heart race.
John tosses laundry into the washing machine. He holds up his newly purchased jeans and gives them a sniff.
Sherlock opens the drawer and pulls out a packet of biscuits with a flourish. He fixes John with a look of feigned annoyance. John scoffs, but with smiling eyes.
"This coming from the man who stood up in front of God and everyone at my wedding and vowed to look after me and my family for the rest of his life," John chuckled.
Mrs. Hudson approaches the building and is alarmed by the presence of an ambulance parked haphazardly on the pavement.
The signs of three... Increased appetite, change of taste perception, you got sick this morning... Mary, I think you should do a pregnancy test.
John remains silent, watching Sherlock. Sherlock picks up a different toy, examines it, and strokes it a bit seductively. His frown disappears.
Sherlock opens the door carefully and stands in the doorway with a smug smile on his face. He spies John's red underpants on the dresser and his face falls in confusion and dismay. He closes the door carefully, but then opens it up again, wanting to confirm what he's seen. The red pants are, indeed, still on the dresser, unworn. Sherlock frowns again and closes the door with more force this time.
This chapter ends on a frustrating note. John, I'm not sure your plan is emotionally healthy for anyone; although, you are getting a lot of cardio.
Sherlock looks up at John in surprise. It takes all his willpower not to blurt out "You! I'd get my best friend back, you ninny." Sherlock decides on a more subtle route.
I got a glimpse of the front the other night... but I'm awfully curious about what's going on back here.
John turned his head and studied Sherlock's face with wide eyes. Sherlock unconsciously held his breath.
John sits at his desk looking up something on a mobile phone. He writes down an address on a piece of scratch paper and draws a little map. When done, he places both the phone and paper in the middle of the desk. He stands up, extracts another phone from his own pocket -his own mobile- and places it securely in the desk drawer. John grabs the paper and mystery mobile off the desk and head out the door.
Sherlock reads on his phone in his chair. He hears the stairs creak as John descends from the upstairs bedroom. Sherlock looks up as John enters the room.
To start, my friend Molly recommends giving the relationship a year to allow me time to suss out my feelings about things, to determine if love is among those feelings.
John paces the bedroom, trying to listen to what's going on upstairs. He finally turns the baby monitor on and sits on the edge of the bed in contemplation.
John is wearing his newly-purchased trousers. He moves a load of laundry from the washer to the dryer. Sherlock happens to walk in the kitchen as John is bending over. Sherlock has to grasp onto the table to recover from the shock of seeing John's arse in tight trousers.
Sherlock returns the smile and tosses the tissues onto the floor. (So much for cleanliness.) He lies down next to John, propping himself up on his elbow to look at John's face.
Scratch that, you are both equally bad... sneaking cigarettes left and right... and neither of you have ever been able to say no to a piece of cake.
Yes. But that doesn't answer the question I originally posed to you: Would YOU like to spend the night in my room tonight, John?
Poke fun at you? Never. Molly is a dear friend of mine and I would very much like to see her set up with someone "nice", as she herself would say. Someone who can appreciate all that is wonderful and good about her. Someone stable... not a sociopath, basically.
It's just some silly sex toys. We don't ever have to use them. I'll get rid of them if you want me to.
John again waits for Sherlock to grow accustomed to the sensation and the fullness. He once again resumes stroking Sherlock's cock.
Sherlock sits down at the table as casually as he can. John places a mug in front of him. Sherlock begins doctoring his tea while John returns to the counter to fill his own mug.
SH: HE SEEMS SLIGHTLY MORE MIFFED WHEN WITNESSING ME FLIRTING WITH MEN RATHER THAN WOMEN, WITH AN AGE RANGE OF 30-55 CAUSING THE MOST IRRITATION
But there can be arguing, lots of back and forth and things to iron out at the beginning of any relationship.
John stands in the bedroom facing the bed, sternly, like a soldier. The light from the bathroom pools on his face. Sherlock enters through the bedroom door only wearing black underpants. He pauses momentarily, struck by how fantastic John looks. He closes the door quietly and walks directly up to John, pressing his bare chest against John's back. Sherlock kisses and licks John's neck and shoulder greedily. Sherlock wraps one arm around John's torso holding him in place, while the other hand reaches into John's pants fondling John's hardness. John tries to remain stock still, but he closes his eyes with pleasure and his breath rate increases.
