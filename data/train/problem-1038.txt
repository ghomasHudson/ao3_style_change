“Remember Timothy,” Mycroft intoned as he pulled a prescription bottle and a small vial of clear liquid out of a hidden pocket in his suit jacket, “full disclosure.”
“Correct. So what happens when a young girl who presented as an Omega as the result of an violent assault finally runs into the perpetrator?”
“Lisa,” Sherlock stammered, “she - how is she? Do you know?”
True to his word, Mycroft must have dismissed the team sent to look for Sherlock, as the safehouse was deserted save for a skeleton crew of guards manning the perimeter. Considering the ease in which John has slipped past them to rescue Sherlock, he had no doubt as to why they were not on the British government’s ‘A Team.’

“Lestrade called last night, said the court date for Lysander, or ah - whatever his name actually is, is set for three months from now. Sherlock and I will be there. I expect they’ll want Lisa to testify, have they called you?”
John was starting to drift, wrestling between the depthless rift of wakefulness and sleep, when his mobile rang. It was a blocked number, and as he lifted the mobile to his ear, he felt that same sense of dread just as he had when Chesney called before. Call it an Omega sense, hell, it could even be some kind of strange new psychic ability, but he already

CHAPTER 6
John smiled, dipping down to run his tongue against the sinfully crafted flesh along Sherlock’s neck. He blew softly afterwards, watching as Sherlock shivered and rolled his eyes upwards.
So what does does Mycroft want? He tells Sherlock:
DAY 2 - Sunday December 22, 2013
Lisa-Shay Palmer allegedly dies and is dumped in the Thames
Eyes wide and lost, Sherlock unclamped his teeth from John’s neck, and groaned.
Both men fell silent, and John felt the air between them thicken in anticipation.
Sherlock interrupted, his voice hoarse with arousal, but still somehow firm in that oh-so-clinical way that John realized he’d grown to love.
"Men came for me. They must have drugged me, because my knife was gone. I never got it back. It's still at the house." She whispered, shaking and hoarse with the effort. "I woke up in a car, and they took me to Lysander's house, but I managed to get out after three weeks. There were other kids waiting there. People like us. They were supposed to be shipped the day after I got out."
Sherlock and John visit Angelo’s
” She finally turned to them, silent tears streaking down her face and glinting with a solemn brilliance in the low light of the wall-lamp near the mechanical bed. She was almost as pale as Harlan, but for the angry flush of pain and stoic acceptance.
I was involved with someone once, when I was in University. His name was Victor, and he introduced me to sex and cocaine - SH
John stifled a curse and slowed his breathing, making sure Sherlock knew he posed no threat.
As the story progress he does seem to realize that maybe it is not as cataclysmic as he thought
“Leave it, please, just…leave it.”
When his mobile rang ten minutes later, Mycroft’s voice was grim.
Lysander, assuming that's a false name, is remaining frustratingly elusive to any inquiry. The homeless don't know him by 'Lysander', and I haven't managed to find any leads to an actual identity. I've contacted the usual Soviet sites, but nothing has proven fruitful."
Sherlock only snarled in response, never slowing his pacing, angling his nose in the air every once in awhile as if sniffing for intruders. John wracked his brain for something, anything, that he might have heard of that could help his friend. He vaguely remembered reading an article by Dr Shibuya about “denning” behaviour in Alphas, an extreme reaction brought on when an Alpha perceived their Omega to be in danger. It typically presented as a regression to territorial behaviour focussed solely on getting the Omega to a defensible area and then safeguarding them by any means necessary.
Sherlock is injured at approximately 12:22pm, John subsequently returns to 221B

“I dunno. Sherlock called in some sort of favour from the British Government to find him. Lysander Evan’s real name is Dr Sean E. Sylvan, an American bloke that worked at the Bellefette centre. Lisa knew the bastard for five years and never suspected a thing. Who the
Sherlock’s panic throbbing and scrabbling in a cold knot behind his breastbone. It took John a good long moment to recover, and with a controlled breath in through his nose and out through his mouth, he ruthlessly stamped the feeling down. Now was the time for action and cold, unemotional, ruthlessness.
The small crowd in the foyer remained silent, though a few had started in shock when John almost fell to his knees.
“Sherlock? I need you to listen to me. I took a heat blocker and I’m not entirely sure how much time I have left before it wears off.  I texted Mycroft, there will be team here in less than 20 minutes, if you don’t want us to end up on the NAOD registry
As if on cue, John felt a rush of warmth in the seat of his pants, and was thankful that, this time, he knew he needn’t worry. With trembling fingers, he managed to turn and face Sherlock, whose flushed face watched with an expression of such open fascination and desire that any insecurity was blown away in its entirety. John clumsily began to work on his flies, his fingers shaking with arousal.
It didn’t really matter though, it seemed they’d arrived at their destination, and John would feel relieved but for the pounding of his heart and the throbbing in his groin. He fidgeted in his seat, his pants feeling uncomfortably damp and heavy.
“Wha -
“Are they sup-suppressants?” He wouldn’t put it past Mycroft to somehow find a way to secure government quality suppressants without having John register in the database. That would probably be the only way he’d ever dare accept mystery drugs from Mycroft Holmes.
As a bonus feature for this analysis, we have decided to include some excerpts from the original notes we wrote before attempting to adopt this fic…. It is interesting to see the differences between what we considered and what we ended up writing!
DAY 7 - Friday December 27, 2013
Sherlock was always in love with John, he is celibate, John assumes Sherlock is asexual, and has no interest in sex at all:
, you’re no good to me if you can’t think clearly and follow instructions. Do you think you can do that for me?” John glanced around the dimly lit room and located a half-full glass of what appeared to be water on the table on the opposite side of the bed. He reached across the duvet, practically face planting into the mattress before righting himself, and sniffed the tumbler suspiciously before downing the tepid liquid as fast as he could. It did little to ease his dry mouth, and even less to combat his rising blood pressure.
The answer is no. I am not, nor did I ever identify as asexual. Celibate would have been a more apt description. -  SH
John grunted as Andrew brought him down, hard, on the wooden floor. Another shot from John’s gun flew wide of its mark, and John had no idea where that one landed because Andrew was soon sat astride his hips, knife flashing, eyes shining with murderous intent.
He realized Sherlock had spent the better part of a day drugged and locked in a room regularly used to hold captured Omegas. The combined miasma of years of misery and terror would have been profoundly distressing for an experienced Alpha, but for an un-bonded Alpha in the midst of his first rut, it was probably devastating. Not to mention the hints of John’s own scent he must have caught every once in a while, since they had somehow ended up in such close physical proximity to each other after Sherlock’s abduction.
did Andrew get Sherlock? Did you see where he took him? Was there a van? I need more details if we have any hope of getting him back.”
he love him?
This whole scene can be read a few different ways:
If Sherlock had been here, John knew he would do something clever, possibly involving disguises and subterfuge, but Sherlock was locked-up inside, in God knows what state and John did not have the time nor the luxury of being clever. The only thing he really had working for him was the element of surprise and he was betting Sherlock’s life on the fact that these men, whoever they were, would never expect a physically unimpressive but really,
“And what about Dr Sylvan? What will happen to him?” It took a moment for John to even think of this question. He found he was horribly distracted and still visualizing the things he would do to that awful cunt Andrew when he found him.
“I don’t think so, I think Andrew got him with the same shite the trafficking ring used to knock out Omegas. When he went down, Andrew pulled out a gun, not sure what kind. I couldn’t stop him, I
wash. We were just dropping Sherlock off at your flat when he got a text saying Lysander was arrested early this morning.”
John huffed and barely managed not to roll his eyes - trust the one man John could never get to shut the hell up to suddenly pull a Marcel Marceau.
“Y - yes...alright, but, I don’t understand.”
“Good Lord, really? Try not to strain yourself,” Sherlock deadpanned, his voice still husky with sleep.
Sherlock wanted from John.

“That,” John swallowed dryly, “is absolutely
“Well, hard to say. We were mates you know. I’d never really considered being with another man, always fancied the birds if you know what I mean, but, the heart wants what the heart wants...then, the body always seems to follow. Sure, it was a little odd at first, we’d always only dated women, see…but you really can’t go against nature.”
"You asked about Lysander. I told you that he..." She sighed in frustration. "He has resources that far outweigh our own. He can afford to pay thousands of pounds to recruits if they volunteer in his trafficking, and I can only assume that he was paying Terry all along. By my guess, I'd say Terry befriended me to find information on the Omega hot-spots, then tried to kill me for the sake of keeping the trafficking alive when I became too big of a 'problem.' London is already sparse in Omega's without my business in saving the few they can take and sell. He always needed money, and if there are no Omegas to sell, he wouldn't get any pay-off. Goodbye, Lisa."
Sherlock and John return home to 221B, fall asleep as the sun rises
No answer, or at least, none John had heard. The footsteps moved away, out of earshot, and while both men continued to talk, it became far too muffled by plaster and stone to be understood. John continued to move along the wall in a crouch, stopping just before the corner towards the front of the house. The front door opened with a slam, and John tensed when he heard the march of angry footsteps heading in his direction.
In his fevered dreams Sherlock was there, lean, hard, beautiful, but far, far away from him. Sherlock was there with Lisa, and Chesney, and John remained alone. Alone, because Sherlock didn’t want this, never wanted it, he told him he never wanted this, and would never want it. Sherlock found all of this beneath him, tedious, and now he would think John was
Well, there was no use delaying the inevitable.
“Murder.” Sherlock declared with suitable, morbid aplomb.
Sherlock didn’t respond, only shifted away from John until he was more on his back, gazing at him with questioning but openly fond eyes.
“Take off your clothes.” Sherlock rumbled, only a hair’s breadth away from John’s once again sensitive ears. “I want to see you.” His baritone eased its way into John’s brain, whiskey dark and just as sweet.
The response made him think for a moment as the car veered off the main road and onto a smaller side-street. Sherlock’s text was more than a little bit ambiguous, and he pondered whether he should ask for clarification when his mobile suddenly buzzes with text after text after text.
Then, as he sprinted to the door, he smiled for the first time in hours.
Is she gaslighting them? SH and JW have never talked to a bonded pair. She keeps playing up to John exactly what he fears the most, being owned. What on earth is she trying to accomplish? She wants Sherlock’s homeless network to expand her own, she gets that by offering him the puzzle of Lysander. Then she wants John to be afraid to bond with Sherlock.
John and Sherlock didn’t speak again until they were back inside the house and, by tacit agreement, neither of them mentioned the elephant in the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John, it’s Chesney,”
“I’m actually calling from her room now, she’s getting stronger and stronger, has almost been awake the whole day now.”

be enough.
John swallowed, actively sweating and trembling now, and reached down into his denims for the pills and for a moment he considered the vial in his other pocket, but Mycroft had said it should only be taken in emergencies. So, the pills it was then.
“I will call you back.” Mycroft’s uncharacteristic lack of politeness when terminating the call was a testament to how worried he really was about his brother. Just then, a vicious abdominal cramp had John almost falling to his knees on the hard, tiled floor. He became suddenly aware that he was still in heat and after all that had happened he somehow still had an erection, and wasn’t that just the icing on the
This was all just…just so…
to tell me!”
It sort of made sense when he laid it all out like that. John could understand what it was like to love someone so desperately, so completely, that he’d put his own life on this line. He was staring that kind of love in the face right now, as it so happened. However, Sherlock was still missing an incredibly important piece of the story, the crux. If she did, in fact, kill Rexfield, what was her
John’s first steps out of the sedan were wobbly and weak, like a newborn foal, and he wasn’t sure if it was the heat or the medications that were mostly to blame. But Timothy was there, solid as a rock, gripping John under the arm and escorting him to the front door, wherein several large men stepped outside to grab John’s things, and several more led him to a secured room deep within the house.
John leant back on the posh seats, his head swimming with thoughts coalescing and dissolving in waves of memories and what-could-have-beens – or what-should-have-beens, rather. Sherlock and John should have been best friends till the end, not - not this, whatever this was. They should have continued on as they were meant to, the two of them together, not as slaves to a biological imperative willing to mate them off to whomever’s most compatible. Is that really what they’d become, just…compatible? He couldn’t believe it, he wouldn’t.
brand of domesticity, both men shared a guarded look. They’d told Chesney to call them today with any updates, good or bad, and knowing what they knew now, they dreaded the worst.
“When he got the text, Lisa and I got out of the car. We were just standing on the pavement in front of that cafe and Andrew came out of nowhere -
“John!” Sherlock was shaking when he crawled over to John, the gun in his hand still warm.
“I have a feeling you’re going to tell me,” John said dryly, licking some much needed moisture on his lips.
“Mycroft had gone beyond the call of duty to volunteer a personal home that would be routinely visited by a keeper for the duration of John's stay.”
Somehow this will evolve into John demanding that Sherlock mount him and Sherlock will realize that it is ok to be sexual and just let go and that John will always keep him right. This loving (yet frenzied and filthy) sex will complete Sherlock’s character arc. This will presumably involve more than 33cc of semen.
BronzedViolets: I definitely agree with SuperBlue! Finishing someone else's work was terrifying, especially when it was such a well known and loved story. The best part was writing it with her. Together we were brave enough to face this challenge. Along the way the story made us laugh and it made us cry...  SuperBlue - it was a privilege to work with you, your guidance has helped me improve my writing and you are an awesome friend. <3
“Harlan was my best friend, you know.”
. He found it hard to believe that Mycroft, even with the whole of the British government at his disposal, could have knowingly brought John to a safe house so close to Lysander’s base of operations. At this point though, he would take all of the luck he could get.
“And what is that?” John motioned towards the bottles, setting his chin forward in an unconscious defense mechanism.

John wondered if he would ever see her again.
Soft hands soothed his brow with damp towels and gentle hands removed his clothes, replacing them with gauzy and cool silk things that whispered comfort and taunted with sensation at the same time. Somehow, he ended up on a bed, but still the throbbing inside persisted, growing in momentum till he must have cried out.

John started at the noise, wondering where
John smiled at that, knowing he could always count on Sherlock to be snarky, no matter what the situation.
We hope this resonates with you, and that you all realize this was crafted with love and reverence to the original material. We did the best we could, and I happen to think that was pretty darn good! If you don't like the ending, or feel that it didn't fit with the tone of the original story, then c'est la vie.
"You sound like someone I once knew." He smiled, eyes seeming to dim in remembrance.
“Mm.”
“I - I wonder sometimes if it was worth it? All of it. If
On the downside, it put John’s face directly on the path of the morning light; on the other hand this minor inconvenience was more than made up for by waking up with Sherlock’s warm body draped along his back and a more than firm cock snugged up against his cleft. With a grumble of satisfaction John gave his bum a cheeky wiggle before rolling over to give Sherlock a good morning nuzzle under his chin.
just to make it go away. Then, every time the faceless people would return and manhandle him onto his back and force more pills down his throat – at this point, sometimes John made it easy, and sometimes he made it very difficult indeed.

The pleasure-pain of the breach, when it happened, was so overwhelmingly

Lisa didn’t come to the funeral. She either didn’t want to come, or couldn’t get released from hospital in time. John reckoned the latter.
“The cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis suggests that there have been geologically rapid shifts in the relative positions of the modern-day geographic locations of the poles and the axis of rotation of the Earth, creating calamities such as floods and tectonic events.”

“So what are you going to do now, if you don’t mind me asking? I have it on good authority that everyone involved in the trafficking ring has been caught.”
John eyed them warily, every instinct in his body screaming at him to refuse, to run back to Sherlock, to, to…he inhaled and swiped a trembling hand across his clammy forehead.
John swallowed spasmodically against the abrupt declaration. He couldn’t say he was surprised, because he had one of his own.
A rescue, a thwarted revenge, and a resolution.
Sherlock paused in his pacing, wild-eyed, as if he only just remembered John was in the room.
That leaves Pentonville, Wormwood Scrubs, Wandsworth, Thameside, and Belmarsh.
John locked eyes with Sherlock, who was no doubt deducing exactly what Chesney just said by the look on his face alone. Sherlock’s expression was grave, fragile, especially since they both knew what it was like to be willing to give their lives for the one they loved most in the world.
It kind of makes sense that Lisa is the villain as it is pretty late in the story to introduce the main bad guy…
John called upon his courage, as was more than accustomed to doing when trying to have a serious conversation with Sherlock Holmes.
But Timothy continued.
Sherlock and John return home to 221B
“I don’t understand.” John said, suddenly on high alert at the completely different countenance of the big-hearted Alpha he met just a few days ago.
“And what if I don't want to? Have you ever wondered why ten percent of people have the Omegaverse gene but only a few ever present?”
“No.”
“I know what’s scaring you about this. Lisa was the same way. “You’re afraid that when it happens, you’ll be perceived as his sexual doormat etc,(…) that’s not what it’s like.”
Mycroft sat across from him, striking a silent but stoic figure on the sumptuous leather seats, and appeared completely entranced by the glow of his massive smartphone.
“Oh God, he wasn’t in heat was he?” John burst out, a rising stab of hot jealousy pulsing within him to battle uncomfortably with the icy terror in the pit of his stomach. It was ridiculous, he knew, to feel this way but...but he couldn’t
“You know we don’t have a King.” A woman’s voice, gruff and raspy, sounded to John’s left.
4:11am John leaves for the safe house
The instant Sherlock’s saliva met the released hormones, John felt a catalytic reaction racing through his body, like a star going supernova. He was incandescent with pleasure, both his and Sherlock’s. He was fucking and being fucked, owner and owned. Every cell in his body trembled and aligned itself with Sherlock’s as though he was his new magnetic north - and
Lisa explains it as:
“But not really. Judas mourned his deception. I can assure you I won’t be hanging myself in a tree.”
argue, there isn’t time.”
“No,” he laughed outright, a kindly chuckle that filled the small space between them, “but that’s kinda my point. You probably came across at least a dozen Alphas in rut, maybe more, who knows, pardon my saying but you are a bit old to be triggering just now. Didn’t you ever wonder why?”
“Now you’re asking the right questions, John. Why would she indeed? Did she ever tell you about the circumstances of how she was triggered?” Sherlock paused and fixed him with a heated gaze, one that smouldered with frightening intelligence and almost...anticipation.
. I suppose it’s just...look, I’m not in the mood for jokes.” He stared at the young woman, she was conventionally pretty, but nothing compared to his mate.
The smile she gave him rivalled even his own, and that scant second of vulnerability dissolved into her usual hard-as-nails persona.
“All of your clothes.” Sherlock’s voice was dangerous, his eyes wild.
What he had first likened to pieces of themselves crumbling away to be lost forever, was instead more like the work of a great sculptor taking chisel to marble. With the excess carved away, it left the essence of them behind, the subtle art of their relationship was no longer hidden behind extraneous stone.
He left the unfortunate man slumped alongside the blood-spattered wall of the cottage, unconscious, and probably in real danger of choking on his own blood from his broken nose. John found he didn’t much care.
“The NAOD is online, all the sordid details are there for everyone to see if they are interested enough.” Then he continued on in his pacing, tearing across the room and looking immensely pleased with himself.
But is that what is really happening? Think of carving a statue out of marble, you take a chisel and a hammer to it and big chunks fall off, but you are actually just releasing the essence of it i.e., the statue of David was always there, it was just hidden in a block of marble
We hope you liked this chappie!
John settled himself in for a long wait, unsure of what Sherlock was doing and whether or not he’d be inclined to respond. He thought about the micro-heats, Sherlock’s misery and how all this was enough to do any sane person’s head in, let alone someone exceptional like Sherlock Holmes.
“Yes,” he growled, moving a step towards him, and then apparently thought the better of it and spun back to face the door. He appeared loathe to leave the room undefended, and John didn’t think this was something he could convince Sherlock to let go.
“It’s not a sodding

It was only the work of a moment. As soon as he spied a figure turning the corner, John lunged forward and grabbed the unknown man by his dirty jumper. With his left hand still clenched full of earth, John stuffed the man’s surprised and gaping mouth full of dirt and grass before he even had a chance to think about screaming. Then, with a quick change in momentum, he swung him around in a vicious arc, making sure his face collided full force into the limestone wall. The resulting crunch of bone on stone was visceral, and satisfying. Most of all, it was

But John was never to know what other colourful words the raging man had in store for him, because in that instant, the side of his head exploded, showering John with bits of bone, glossy brain matter, and blood.
“We’re under orders not to leave you unprotected until your heat is in remission,” Waverly replied, surprisingly earnest. John promised himself he’d put in a good word for this man when next he saw Mycroft.
John wasted no time. He left the dead man and sprinted towards the other end of the house, bile and anger rising in his throat. If that

It was then that he noticed the baseball cap and the blonde ponytail.

cake.
i) Is Lisa really Harlan’s Lisa? - From all the emphasis that they have made regarding an alpha being able to smell their bond-mate, if Lisa had really been alive for the (two?) weeks before Harlan was caught he would have certainly been able to smell her. This is especially true if she is hanging around the center. In the least Harlan would have been able to smell her on John’s coat during one of the visits. Would taking massive doses of suppressants help? But everyone has a smell?? If Alphas can “smell the ingredients in the food” I am sure Harlan could smell her laundry detergent, Chesney car, her shampoo etc.
“Oh, don’t be like that. I’m just trying to have a bit of conversation now,  since we’ve got all this extra time.” Andrew continued, rolling his neck and shoulders. He leant down towards Sherlock, wiping the knife clean on his Belstaff.

spoil the man.
“So why did she kill him then? Assuming she killed him at all. They’ve been working on taking apart this Omega ring for years. Why suddenly risk it all by murdering one of the recruiters?”
“Sure.” John snapped, though honestly he hardly cared what bloody bells rang when in what bloody tenor - whatever, that meant. He was sure by this time tomorrow he’d hardly be able to remember his name, let alone have enough mental acuity to phone Sherlock.
The room reeked of Omega, of fear and desperation, sex and blood. Sherlock had folded himself into a far corner, huddled against a wall stained with damp, while Andrew sauntered blithely in long arrogant motions across the floor. He looked smug, murderous, and almost like he knew he’d won already. He twirled a blood stained knife in his large hands, flinging fresh droplets of ichor to the ground in mad little swirls of blackness. John renewed his grip on the gun, not even daring to think of whose blood that was.
“On your knees,” Sherlock commanded, his voice rough and breathy - gravel and smoke.
right now!”
Noted –SH
“How do you…”
“Lisa?” He gaped, not caring one whit how he must have looked, staring at some girl in street during broad daylight.
They sat there for countless minutes, alone and desperate for each other, John placing a hand behind Sherlock’s neck and squeezing, just the right amount of pressure to calm the other man.
“What would you say if we took a little time to practice? I need to test the difference between your lubrication before heat and during heat. I hypothesize that your heat induced secretions contain more glucose and even variances of prostatic acid phosphatase that act as - “

that it brought John to tears. His hands scraped and flexed against the floor, unsure as to whether he should push back into the stretch, or pull away from the intensity.
“We have reps who pose as sellers on the streets. They con the Omegas, then let us know so that we can come and escort them to underground safe-houses where they're given shelter and suppressants until we can get them to register with the NAOD.” - that does not sound like what Harlan said.
Muffled noises sounded from the mobile. “Her left side.”
“What do you mean?”
“Alright,” John began, his tone cold and forceful, “I don’t have time to fuck around. I need another syringe, 5ml or 3ml if you have it. If it’s necessary, I will call Mycroft Holmes back
“I…yes. I love you more than anything John.”
Andrew laughed to himself and flung Sherlock’s head away towards the wall, letting him fall limp against the crumbling plaster, sliding with a grimace back to the floor.
He couldn’t help the wide smile that spread across his face. “I think that’s an amazing idea.”
“Lysander.” He confirmed, prologuing an electric stand-off between the three of them with John in the middle.
Act 3, (the Climax) will involve with John biting Sherlock hard on the back of the neck to stop Sherlock from doing something (not sure what), Sherlock will be stunned, possibly John will suffer from premature ejaculation and also more importantly realize he owns Sherlock.

enough. The sense of incompleteness was shattering, and all John could do was sob and push back into his lover, unable to speak but hoping Sherlock would understand.

It didn’t take long for John to use a small alcohol wipe, also provided by the anonymous suited man, to disinfect the top of the vial and plunge the needle through the rubber top, drawing up 2ml of clear liquid. He already knew what the recommended dosage was, but what he didn't know was how much benzodiazepine was still in his system. He decided he didn’t much care and unceremoniously plunged the needle into the top of his thigh, depressing it quickly until all the liquid was gone. He grunted as he massaged the injection site, knowing the vastus lateralis was the easiest and best location for self-administered intramuscular injections. Now, all he needed was time, fifteen minutes or so - maybe a bit longer.
Sherlock batted his hand away, the moment of vulnerability and terror evaporating, erased as if it had never been there. Sherlock caught John’s arms in a vice-like grip and fierce but low growl rattled in the back of his throat.
of a church’s bell tolling in the background, mournful and solemn.
There was nothing, nothing that could make any of this better. Sherlock and John remained silent.
“Not as of yet Dr Watson. We are pursuing all possible avenues of investigation at this time. We did locate the girl you knew as Stevie.  She was able to positively identify  Dr Sylvan as the man she knew as Lysander Evans. We are working with her now to try and identify the locations of the safe-houses that Andrew might have known about through Terry.” This new information was delivered in a neutral, almost flat, tone. It was almost as if Mycroft’s ubiquitous PA was bored.
Sherlock shuffled through the doorway and into the darkened room, looking down at John’s impromptu nest, his face a mixture of tension and obvious bewilderment. It was only a few seconds before he cleared his throat, the movement drawing John’s eyes to the soft, dewy skin below his jawline and at the back of his neck.
His intention was never to exacerbate Sherlock’s fear of what the Alpha gene would mean for his mind and body’s separation. Parts of Sherlock’s persona were already breaking off and being swept down the rolling rivers of self-control, and John knew that it had the potential to devastate Sherlock’s already-fragile center of gravity. He never wanted that.
and I thought he took you. He can’t John.
It was a simple thing, but just arrogant and disrespectful enough to set a fire alight in John’s blood, and he ground his teeth, pondering what was keeping him from shooting this arsehole directly in the chest.
They regarded each other over the tabletop for a long moment, two men, Alpha and Omega, and suddenly John’s throat was thick with the weight of the inevitable momentum of the last month.
He’d truly lost
“Now, imagine if Lisa had committed the murder? Even if she was given a reduced sentence by claiming self-defence, which is unlikely as Rexfield was beaten to a bloody pulp, do you really think Harlan would be capable of watching her rot in jail?”
. Don’t let up the pressure until the paramedics say you can. It’s going to hurt her, it might even bring her out of unconsciousness, but she will thank you later.” John moved his ear away from the mobile, fighting a sudden wave of dizziness that threatened to overcome him. He covered the receiver with his hand, addressing the one agent remaining in his room. “I need some flumazenil, I know you have it, and if you don’t, get it right the
John slapped his hand hard against his face. He had no idea how much of the sedatives were still in his system, or if he was even in a fit state to be giving life-saving medical advice over a bloody mobile. It was Chesney’s  distressed breathing, huffing through the line in fits and sobs, that finally made up his mind.
It was Chesney. John quickly brought the mobile to his ear, stomach lurching with a strong wave of dread.
“Excellent idea, Mr Holmes.”
Based on the length of John’s trips we can conclude Harlan was most likely being held on remand at either Pentonville or Wormwood Scrubs.
No, he couldn’t  think that way. Sherlock was not his, he did not belong to John, and he couldn’t give in to this biological jealousy and possessiveness. Sherlock was his
A pause, then an almost silent rush of air. “Not really. Late last night Harlan fell into a coma. They don’t expect he’ll recover. They moved him from Pentonville to the hospital this morning.”
which clearly states that “Alphas and Omegas make up a meagre 10% of the world's entire population.”
There, message sent.
“No.”
It wasn’t so much that Sherlock said yes, he didn’t have to, he felt Sherlock’s cock swell against his thigh, as if the thought of breeding John excited him. John felt his own entrance contract and pulse thickly with sympathy, even though he was days away from heat.
of Polar Hypothesis (Adopted).
The effect was instantaneous, he felt the tension drain out of Sherlock like water from a broken cup. John’s mouth flew open in  surprise as Sherlock slowly slumped to the floor. John somehow ended up on the ground, legs akimbo, with Sherlock’s head almost in his lap, his breath punching out of him with a profound sigh of relief.
The plot thickens.
John chose to ignore it as his mobile vibrated once more.
Obviously neither of those things advance this plot LOL
go against nature, but still, he was intrigued. “What do you mean?”
with someone. A real, soul deep compatibility, or matching pheromones, or whatever. My point is, unless you meet that kindred spirit first, an Alpha in rut could get a leg over you and nothing would happen. Jacob and I, we already had that connection, that resonance. So when it happened, it was a bit of a shock to our systems of course but...the love was already there, it just needed to mature a bit. Course, it hasn’t always been easy, but there’s no relationship on Earth that ever is.” Another knowing grin, and John is suddenly quite aware that Mycroft Holmes had definitely chosen this particular chauffeur on purpose, that meddling twat.
It was worse when he awoke with clarity, because then he could remember, when the sensuous throbbing in his backside pounded with a fervor and ferocity that had him again on his hands and needs, viciously arching his back and begging,
He only realized he was still holding his mobile when the light from the screen blinked off, and he was left alone and emotionally wrecked in the darkened room once more. John quickly shook himself out of his fugue, fervently stabbing in Mycroft’s number on the tiny screen, probably with more force than necessary.
Conversely, the remaining 37.5% of the Omegaverse population would be between 0 and 29 years old and thus may not have presented yet. This gives us an additional 320,200 latent Omegaverse individuals living in London at any given time. (See “2011 Census: Usual resident population by five-year age group and sex, local authorities in the United Kingdom;” the next full census is not until 2021 so this is the best data we can get.)
superblue: Personally, I will probably never do this again! THE PRESSURE!!! LOL. But it was a challenge, and a good one at that. Trying to get into the mindset of original characters (not Sherlock and John) I did not know very well (i.e. motivations, dreams, fears, etc), was incredibly difficult. I thank Bronzedviolets with all my heart because she was my personal cheerleader and infinitely patient with me and my intermittent writer's block. Plus she is a great friend and this project brought us together, so...in the end I can't help but feel this experience was 100% worth it.

“Sherlock, we need to figure out what we’re going to do before the blocker wears off, but I can’t think clearly with you stalking around like that. Whatever it is you’re doing to try and gear down is clearly not working so, umm, lets see if we can distract you. ” He kept his voice as gentle and neutral as possible, drying his hands on a sunny gingham hand-towel he found hanging by the sink.
ii) There are a number of inconsistencies in what Lisa says she is doing versus what Harlan said they were doing versus what they were actually doing:
Again, we are only following in the footsteps of greatness, be kind!
Three little dots popped up in the mobile window, indicating Sherlock had read the text and was typing a response. It gave him little comfort. John furtively glanced at Mycroft, who was still engrossed in his ploy for world domination via mobile, then at the driver, who was managing to navigate London’s roundabouts just fine despite his self-proclaimed vision problems.
“Fine, yeah. I’m good.  Just wondering where exactly we’re going is all.”
Sherlock carefully removed his YSL lace-ups and socks, never once looking away from John’s eyes. He deliberately undid his buttons slowly, sliding his arms free to let the shirt flutter to the ground at his feet before moving his hand to the front of trousers. He was so hard that it was a struggle to pull the zip down over the bulge. John revelled in a brief moment of giddiness before Sherlock’s scent struck his nostrils once more in a wave of musk that had his heart skittering in his chest.
“I learned from the best.” He smiled, stepping forward.
Sherlock tilted his entire frame, leaning forwards in an unconscious manoeuvre that deepened the kiss for one sweet instant before pulling away with a groan, eyes screwed shut and biting at his own lip in wild desperation. The primal scent of an Alpha in full-rut rolled off him in waves so unbelievably heady that John couldn’t help but groan in tandem, cock hardening in his trousers.
was worth it.” Her breath became uneven, tears flowing freely, droplets falling unheeded down onto Harlan’s limp, bloodless hand. “I just want him to know that…I - I did love him, I did. And...he will always be,” her voice hitched, “my friend. The only one, I think, on this Earth who’d sacrifice himself for the likes of someone like me.”
-> is Terry really Lysander and Lisa /“Lisa” was working for him and she wants to take over the business so she a) takes over Sherlock’s network, b) kills Lysander, C) takes his place because no one knew who he was any way, d) separates John and /Sherlock and then kills Sherlock? e) kills a grieving John, takes over the world etc. etc.
“Form a biological bond with him, or leave him be. You'll ruin it otherwise.”
Sherlock couldn’t see how forcefully John typed his next message, but he wouldn’t put it past Mycroft to notice the agitated stabbing the innocent mobile received on behalf of John’s wounded pride.
John was unsurprised, and with an amused, long-suffering sigh, he squared his shoulders and followed Sherlock down the hall and out of that cursed house.
Sherlock’s pupils exploded, obliterating everything but a thin sliver of iris. He took a long shuddering breath before he answered. John felt him sway in his arms, and a burst of fervent affection swirled through his chest.
“It’s nothin’, I gotta go, I think Leesy needs some help. I’ll phone back when I can.”
“Sherlock was abducted from in front of Baker Street. I have already injected myself with flumazenil and plan to use the megestrol as soon as my mind clears. Now, please, communicate with me normally. I don’t need your particular brand of - of cryptic
. His dignity, his humanity, and now, perhaps even Sherlock. He couldn’t help but think back to his last visit to the detention centre, when Harlan had asked him how he thought
“Yes, I know, everything all right?”
“I...don’t know. I suppose not. Omegaverse is, well, we were all taught in school, even medical school, that it was an evolutionary throwback. Just some...alternate species slowly making their way to extinction.” John ran the pad of his thumb across the vee of his trousers and realized he was painfully hard. He needed out, ne needed relief, and he needed it sooner rather than later. He could deal with the genetics lessons later.
. Sherlock, the man who held reason above all, never would give in to his primal side, and had been so ashamed in the very few instances he had.
“Are - are you saying Omegas and Alphas are like bloody ducks?”
of this damned car. He wanted to get out and find Sherlock. He wanted to find him, he wanted to smell him and taste him, he wanted to bite him, he wanted Sherlock to bend him over and –
John reached for Sherlock’s hand, suddenly needing his comfort and stability. John was a strong man, stronger than most - hell he’d been through Afghanistan and back, even been shot - but that all seemed to dull in comparison to the heartbreaking tableau of two young people, one injured, the other recently departed, both unable to accept their lives, their fate, and who had been tortured through it all.
“John, in the spirit of full disclosure, I think they already have. I am experiencing a very powerful urge to bend you over the back of Mycroft’s £3,000 armchair and just take you.”
I said Lisa’s been shot and Sherlock’s been taken!” Chesney’s voice was too loud, staticky, and reverberating painfully into John’s ear.
B) Their whole relationship flips, so they want each other sexually but they hate each other?
I think Sherlock was likely demi-sexual or homosexual and celibate
How would that even work? She was on the registry? Did the police or anyone follow-up, wouldn’t Lestrade have noticed she was alive?  Wouldn’t the police want to question her because she kind of incited someone to commit murder? Also if Lestrade reported her dead / missing you think he would check with the Registry? This makes 0 sense.

He regarded the bottle for a long moment, read the dosage instructions, and decided to take the plunge. He know this would be difficult, hell…he knew this would be awful, but he couldn’t avoid it now. At least he could make it easier on himself, and then get back to his Alph – Sherlock as soon as possible. He quickly gulped down three strangely sweet pills, one more pill than recommended, but he certainly didn’t give a shite right now. John dry swallowed the pills with a grimace.
But, Sherlock was right, as always. Although John had no doubt that he would never be officially connected to the death of Mr Russell and company, there was no use in tempting fate by leaving potentially damning evidence laying about.

"I met Terry in 2009. He was one of our better workers, and I just...trusted him too much too fast. He seemed passionate. Ready to help. He was an alpha, so I assumed he understood the pain of...look, I thought he was a friend, but he was never one of mine. I'm sorry, John. Truly. He came for me, and you were collateral.”
“Are you quite well?” Mycroft’s voice was somehow loud in the closed space, though John realized he was speaking at the same level he always did, softly but with great self-importance. Mycroft managed to layer that simple question with enough meaning that John felt both guilty and annoyed at the same time, though he was not entirely sure why.
A) that John and Sherlock flip, so John would be uninterested in sex and Sherlock would be chasing men for meaningless flings. (I think I read that AU); or,
“So.” John began, clearing his throat a tad awkwardly. “You, um. Kissed me.”

“Come again?” John fixed him with a stare, feeling his patience wearing thin, a note of anger clinging to the edges of his voice.

As if on cue, the vehicle rolled to a smooth stop and Mycroft raised a hand to tap on the glass partition. The driver allowed the barrier to roll down completely before he angled his head towards Mycroft.
GRAPHIC 2:
Sherlock smiled, just a bit. “Not for a second. When we got involved he all but guaranteed we’d help her go after Lysander by implying that the traffickers would be coming after you next. He knew that as a newly presented Alpha I would never be able to let that go.”
That is just weird, why get a driver that can’t see? My bet it that the driver is a bonded omega, that will be acting as the “keeper”.
“Sorry what? Sorry - I, say that again.”
“Lisa should be done in a second. She’s bitching somebody out at this moment in time. You know how it is when you own your own business.” What business? How can you run a business when you a pretending to be dead?

With the spires of the Petham church providing  an impressively gothic backdrop, John crossed over the property line to lean against the rough limestone of the cottage. The daisies were exactly as he remembered them from the drive to the safehouse, and as he crouched closer, he could make-out the corner of a cobblestone garden complete with bird feeders. He was about halfway around the house, circling towards the front, when he stopped with a pained gasp, gripping his shirt over his heart in a poor mimicry of the squeezing pain roiling in his chest. He could
Although Harlan had confessed to the murder of Rexfield Barcroft, his reasoning behind the murder had put a kink in the entire investigation, so his trial date was indeterminate at this point. He would undoubtedly go to prison, but the murder sentence could be diluted if his allegations regarding Lisa Palmer, Rexfield Barcroft and the phantom Lysander Evans were proven to hold any credibility in court.
For illustrative purposes, this is what a five mile radius looks like:
If this was a super high security deal they would have bodyguards which he is not or minimize people who know where they are going. In that case Mycroft would have just driven them himself. This can serve two functions in the narrative i.e.,
Sherlock stood and positioned himself between John and the door, pacing back and forth, nostrils flaring and chest heaving. His eyes rolled from side to side, putting in mind a spooked horse. It was practically inhuman, and as John lifted himself up, he made extra care to move slowly.
“Please, I just – I just can’t – “

Lisa shrugged, the shoulders bunching up on her oversized coat. “Nah, got things to do you know? Tell him I said hello...and, well, thank you, to the both of you.”
JW esp. thinks that “the new normal” will be cataclysmic and ruin their friendship but maybe it just moves the guideposts.
“They released me a month ago. I’m feeling alright, more or less. Does that satisfy all the questions you couldn’t quite ask?” She smiled at him, like old times, like the last four months didn’t even exist, and popped a bit of gum between her teeth.
He never really said goodbye, just thanked her with all the feeling and warmth of an automaton before slumping gracelessly to the floor.
“Our friendship.” John said, utterly devoid of humour. “It means…everything to me. More than I can quantify. Taking it to that step would be risking everything, and I can’t—do that. Not with him. I could tolerate it, but he couldn’t

“According to the current Omegaverse literature, an Alpha can smell an Omega from five miles away, fifty miles if the Omega is in heat. Harlan is being held on remand at Her Majesty’s Prison Pentonville. When Lisa came to call on us, she entered into the five mile range and considering he was coming out of an unresolved rut, there is no way that he couldn’t smell her. Also, he didn’t mention her ‘miraculous resurrection’ when you saw him next, ergo he already knew she was alive.”
“No?”
What will happen to Harlan? It is tied to the truth about Lisa but past that I have no idea…
“And the other bottle?” John was more than wary, wondering if the vial contained something even stronger that sedatives.
He was gripped by a sense of furious desperation - it
CHAPTER 3

John interrupted his protest by gripping Sherlock gently by the lapels and slowly pulling his mouth down to meet his. He would give him as long as he needed to come to terms with this, to realize it was what
“Revenge?” It wasn’t the wrong answer, it just wasn’t the
His nerve endings were firing on all cylinders now, invigorating his mind and inciting that all-consuming haze of kill or be killed he so loved in the Army, and so dearly missed in London. He waited a long moment, crouched once more, barely sparing a glance to the unconscious thug lying face-down on the damp ground. The winter day had turned dusky, and the small streetlamps dotting the pastoral lane barely lit the road, let alone the houses. One more thing in his favour.
Chesney snuffled into the phone, perhaps wiping his face or covering up a sneeze, “yeah, I’m meeting with the barrister on Monday.”
“There has to be a
"Hah. No." He replied, a sickly smile stretching over his gaunt bones as he mindlessly tapped the metal of the wheel. "Lisa loved me, but she was never prepared to do anything for me. I always knew that. But I...she was still mine, even if she didn't want to be. I never felt compelled to 'own' her until we activated the gene, and then it was impossible to just be friends like we used to be. She hated being a possession, but she couldn't fight it either. Because of that, she deviated between selfless love and selfish independence. She died without ever finding a balance between the two."
“Well for one, no one is looking for Rexfield’s murderer.”

But, there was really no need to worry.
“Yes, Mr Holmes,” Timothy replied, putting the car in neutral and sounding just as common and non-threatening as he did before.
John wasn’t even out of breath when the he arrived at the church grounds. He willed himself to stay calm, and stay in the shadows. The stout chestnut trees lining the worn dirt paths gave him a bit of hazy cover as he kept close to the ground, circling the tiny graveyard behind the church proper. If memory served him correctly, and it almost always did, he knew what to look for based on Stevie’s rough description - a small house with a back garden, flowers, and bird feeders. As he moved farther away and down the southernmost laneway, he was quickly rewarded with the sight of a moderately sized, though rather unremarkable, stone cottage.
was what was meant to happen.
. Mr ‘stop talking you lower the IQ of the whole room’ liked children.”
With a primal growl, Sherlock surged forward, clamping his jaws down on the base of John’s neck hard enough to command his complete and full attention. A shock of electric pleasure raced up John’s spine, so intense that for a second he feared he would black out. The sharp jut of Sherlock’s canines was brutal, just a few more pounds per square inch of pressure and the newly matured Omega exocrine gland would rupture, cementing a permanent bond between them.
“Sherlock, I’m alright. It’s over. Lysander’s in jail, and Terry is really,
John sighed from deep in his cramping belly, more cryptic nonsense, as per usual. “Can’t say that I have.”
The Omega trafficking ring will have to be broken up, although I wonder if Sherlock swallowed his pride and just asked Mycroft to take care of it during the private conversation he had as John was leaving?
Andrew must have sensed his decision, because he crouched forward suddenly, knife still in hand and leapt towards John’s legs in a lunge meant to bring John crashing to the ground. At the unexpected movement, John fired a shot, the bullet going much too far to the left and embedding itself in the wall in a spray of plaster dust.
While John did love to be Sherlock’s sounding board on all things mysterious, he only shrugged, waiting for him to continue.
Only a few of the agents managed to look surprised, but one brave fellow immediately made a beeline straight towards an open area to John’s left, disappearing behind a half-wall that lead into what must be the kitchen.

“The Mister and I used to watch Planet Earth on the BBC with the little ones, years ago you know, and we learnt it’s not unusual in nature for certain hatchlings, like ducks for example, to imprint on what is immediately available. It could be a mother duck, a pair of wellingtons, or a well used Tesco bag. ” Timothy grinned at that, like it was some personal joke, provoking memories better kept to himself.

The solution came to him almost fully formed, and it was so obvious he could have kicked himself. To solve a primal problem he needed a primal solution.
“I’m sorry, he must be – my God I can’t even imagine what you’re going through. My Jacob was always there for me, when we were both triggered. Rugby mates you know, thick as thieves until it happened. I don’t know what I’d do should I lose him.”
now. Splitting up had been a disastrous decision and John was finally able to understand why Sherlock was so hell bent on the two of them remaining together. All their separation had done was get one kidnapped and almost killed, while the other stewed in an agonizing hell of his own making.
“HMP Pentonville is 3.6 miles from Baker Street.”

“Right, right...j-just fold whatever you’re going to use and put it over the wound, make it as thick as you can, then press down -
“Crouch down.” John used a more forceful tone this time, exerting firmer pressure on his neck to emphasize his point. Sherlock turned his head to shoot him a look that was half mutinous, half panicked before begrudgingly acquiescing. He slowly lowered himself to an uneasy crouch, John still plastered against his warm back. The change of position meant that, despite their height difference, Sherlock’s nape was almost at John’s chin level. Without stopping the gentle movement of fingers through curls, John carefully folded the collar of the coat down. Taking a deep breath and hoping he was not about to make a catastrophic mistake, John bent forwards, biting down firmly right on the scruff of Sherlock’s neck.
John silenced his mate with a good natured whack to the arm before rolling to prop himself up on one arm.

“Yes, I just took the suppressant- should be about an hour before it takes effect,” John leant against the doorjamb, suddenly dizzy, probably from the amount of drugs roiling around in his veins. Some of the other agents looked alarmed, but he pushed them away with a strong hand. “I’m fine, God, you’d think I was the King of England!”

“Then shut up Sherlock. Shut up and kiss me again, turn me round, mount me, bite me, bond with me...forget everything we’ve been through in the last few weeks, and know that I want all of this just as much as you do.” John’s warmed palms slid around Sherlock’s chest, lowering incrementally until they skimmed against the full rise of his buttocks. Finally, he gave them each a good, hard,

“Are you able to walk? Mycroft’s house is just down the street.”
John detected a bit of hope in his voice, could almost picture the raggedy young man sat at her side, smile small but genuine.
The driver commented, rubbing his hands together quickly as he huffed air into them. "Wish the sun would come up. I'm too old to drive in the dark. Eyes have gone bad."
“Sher - Sherlock I’m fine, Christ.” John sat up with a groan, wincing as he placed a gentle hand to his swollen lips, his fingertips came back glistening red. Sherlock only doubled his efforts, finally leaning and placing his nose to the crook of John’s neck, breathing and licking at salty skin.

Down the hallway, past his open door, he heard strong voices, commands, and knew Mycroft’s men were assembling. Another wave of panic slammed through him and John snatched at the mobile.
John never was too keen on playing devil’s advocate, but with Sherlock it was a necessary evil.

Sherlock eyed John speculatively, but didn’t say a word.
When he finally heard the telltale ring of his mobile, he’d scrabbled to answer, heart leaping like a wild thing in his throat.
John!” Now, the real pacing began. Sherlock spun and stalked across the kitchen, the leather soles of his shoes thumping on the floor like a heartbeat. “If Rexfield hurt her somehow, and Harlan killed him, the end result would be the same - Harlan would go to jail and likely get a more lenient sentence considering someone assaulted his bonded mate. Why ‘fake’ her death? And poorly at that, it’s not like she’s been keeping a low profile.” He paused once, levelling John with a steady glare as he turned his shoulder towards him.
We are both so pleased at the reaction to this fic being adopted. Honestly, we weren't even sure if this would be considered polite or plagiarizing someone else's material. Please keep in mind that we would never pass of the original work as our own, we have the utmost respect for the original author.
“Ok, just don’t move her. It’ll be alright. Is she conscious?” John could hear the faint sound of footsteps through the thick wood of the door, apparently it hadn’t taken long for his frantic battering to be noticed. John was momentarily appeased, at least Mycroft’s lackeys were attentive.
” John drooled, tongue thick and fuzzy, the mealy dredges of drug induced sleep still clutching at his consciousness. He could barely even hold his mobile steady, let alone parse the deathly importance of what was just said.
He took the bottles, pills rattling inside as he stuffed them both in his trouser pockets.
“You were thinking you should clean the guns. There is a heavy duty Brownells box on the bureau. I don’t doubt that it’s a Communal Armoury Kit.”
He must have, he remembered, vaguely, a man, a tall man gently pushing him away and offering him words of comfort while John sobbed and prostrated himself on the floor, naked somehow and on his hands and knees with his glistening and oozing backside angled obscenely in the cool air, hands and nails pulling tufts of that hateful carpeting from its stitching against the floor...the soft floor, exhilarating and coarse, and he rubbed his face against it, wishing it was beard burn from his Alpha, until he was cautiously, bodily lifted and forced to drink blissfully cool water with a few more sweet pills, and situated back on that wretched bed.
Harlan died peacefully 15 days later, with Lisa weeping silently at his side.
The grip on his mobile tightened instantly, becoming painful, fierce, and unforgiving. He breathed in, then out, and then launched it across the small space, watching with grim satisfaction as it clattered in a rattle of plastic against moulded vinyl, exploding in several pieces as the battery was forcefully expelled from the casing.

of something hitting the ground hard told John all he needed to know. He didn’t give the man any time to recoup, but reared back and savagely kicked the door open with a brutal blow right under the doorknob. It flew open with a crash of fractured wood and another sickening thud as it slammed into the supine body lying crumpled and bleeding profusely on the cold, stone floor.

The funeral was a surprisingly crowded affair. Lisa and Harlan’s work on the streets had made an impression. John caught the scent of at least a dozen Omegas, and recognized a number of NSY officers as well as even a doctor or two from Barts.
Sherlock beamed at John like he’d made his own fantastic deduction, instead of just continuing Sherlock’s own line of logic. “That is the most likely scenario. According to her medical records, not available on the NAOD obviously, on August 20th, 2008 she was accompanied to the hospital by Harlan and treated for a blow to the back of the head and sexual assault. As she was unable to provide a description of her attacker, no charges were ever brought forward. Exactly two weeks later she presented as an Omega. Her parents kicked her out and she and Harlan were left to fend for themselves.”

He inhaled a bit, huffing the next breath out and running a hand down his face before starting again. “I know you love to show off, so put everything together. Let’s start with why Lisa faked her own death, shall we? You told me, and I quote,  ‘a
Still trying to desperately claw his way clear of the benzodiazepine fog, John moved quickly out of his room and down the hallway. He remembered, vaguely, the layout of the house and was gratified to see it was exceedingly simple floor plan after all. In the foyer, a group of young men and women, all in suits, gathered nervously and swung their heads round as John barreled into their space.
In a manner of speaking, yes – SH
Before John could even respond, the call cut off with a sharp, almost malicious,
John managed to raise his head slightly, peering at the man through tear stung eyes, frustration colouring his voice. “You – you knew him, your mate, before? You were friends when…it all happened?” John raised his head higher, his expression full of confusion and possibly, hope.
Lestrade requests their presence at Harlan’s interrogation the next day.
Taking another deep breath, while also praying Mycroft was as good as Sherlock seemed to think he was at keeping things out of the courts, John waited for the heavy footfalls to turn round the corner before he sprang into action.
“ - really think this is for the best?” Pounding footsteps neared the window, and John made himself as small and unnoticeable as possible, clenching the loamy ground unconsciously in his left hand. Try as he might, he could only catch snippets of a no doubt heated conversation, “...your Alpha...Terry was a...made up his own damn mind to get mixed up with the likes of Lysander and you
Sherlock snorted. “Tedious.”
if it meant keeping me safe…”
Promises the author made about what would happen, in summary, in her notes, in the comments, and in the tags, fulfillment of the title, questions left hanging….
Reality cut through the haze, clear and knife-edged, leaving him acutely aware of his nakedness and altogether unsure of how long he’d been lost to the drugs and heat. John almost dropped the mobile, his hands diaphoretic and weak, making it difficult to hold on to anything. He cursed the decision to take the sodding benzodiazepines from Mycroft. Now that he finally could comprehend what the hell he’d just heard - he felt like he’d been doused in ice water, each muscle and nerve tensed with a rush of adrenaline strong enough to momentarily override the burning need of his heat.
"Your mate Lisa?"
“Have you told her about Harlan?”
“Megestrol acetate.”
=> John sees this as Terry is working for Lysander and we assume that Terry is talking about the deception with Harlan
John couldn’t believe it. Though he had his own issues with Lisa knowingly endangering her own mate and seemingly not caring one whit that he was imprisoned, he was hard pressed to believe that somehow
“I’ve been thinking -”
The bell-tone was a sad little thing, an odd rendition of Ding Dong Bell that managed to be more disturbing than anything else. John gripped his gun in both hands and moved to the side of the door, listening intently.
“Good on you love, good on you,” John replied with a short laugh he couldn’t quite contain. He never thought he’d actually feel the need to praise Sherlock purely on the volume of his ejaculate, but, this was his life now.
“Do you know how long I waited for my Terry to come home before I realized something was wrong? Three hours.
P.s. Is it just me or every time you read that do you want to take a measuring cup and see how much liquid that actually is?
Mycroft was true to his word, and John’s phone immediately buzzed with incoming email.
“Jesus Christ - who took Sherlock?” John sat up, grimacing against the spinning in his head and swung his legs round, settling them lightly on the frayed carpeting. He had to alert someone - one of those fuzzy faced government watchdogs - only he wasn’t exactly sure how.
“So, you’re saying you think Lisa killed Rexfield?” John blurted out, his tone bordering on incredulous.
Sherlock and John at home in 221B
There was a brief clatter and the line went dead. John blinked into the darkness, against the unwelcome but continuing buzz in his brain, and at that same moment a suited man burst through the open doorway with a syringe and a small vial. John knew it would be best if the flumazenil was administered intravenously, but he neither had the time nor an actual intravenous line. Instead, he eyed the syringe and decided an intramuscular injection was the best way to go.
“John - I’m not sure why I came back here,” Sherlock turned away, closing his eyes against the small room before him and the frank reminder of their situation. “I…I was not thinking clearly. I need to leave before - ”
Also I swear “Lysander Evans” is an Anagram or something. It is just such an odd name…
“I know he felt he lost his way, the way we used to be. I know he felt we would never be able to bridge the gap between who we became and who we thought we’d be when we finally had our own lives.”
This works out to a population that is 99%+ human and less than 0.0000187% Omegaverse.
“I have some news.” It was Anthea on the line, her voice as deep and crisp as ripe apples.

In a sudden fury, he ripped the offending bed apart, kicking  the duvet across the room and dragged the mattress over into the corner furthest from the door. He ransacked the linen closet opposite the toilet, ignoring the strange looks from patrolling agents, and grabbed every blanket and pillow he could manage. He piled the blankets, sheets, and pillows around the edges of the mattress to make a nest. He’d read about this once before, a long time ago, this type of...animalistic behaviour. It sickened him, the loss of control, not only of his body but of his life, and he fought back tears as he curled up with his back to the wall, a ball of abject misery.
John asked to be shown to the bathroom right away, he tottered stiff legged through the doorway, which was mildly embarassing since he was sporting a rampant erection and didn’t have any means to hide it or save what was left of his dignity. Not to mention that for some reason he felt an inexplicable urge to move his bowels, but instead, he passed a small glob of blood-tinged mucous. This was new and frankly bizarre, but it wasn’t exactly uncomfortable, it just felt...wet, warm, and viscous. Through the drugs and growing fizzing in his brain he realized with grim acceptance that his vaginal channel must have lengthened by now, exposing his cervix and completely blocking off his rectum from his descending colon. Wonderful. His heat had really, truly, begun.
“I said this is
They wrestled for a brief moment, the silence in the room punctuated by their grunts of pain and Sherlock’s ragged breathing. John gripped Andrew’s knife hand, clenching his teeth with the effort, all the while struggling to avoid blow after blow from the incredibly strong man above him. John had lost his grip on the gun in the fray, and it lay abandoned on the floor next to both men, momentarily forgotten in the hand-to-hand grappling. It wasn’t long before John was overcome by Andrew’s larger mass, and the man put his boxing skills to use, heaping terrific amounts of abuse to John face.
He heard a clatter as footsteps approach, and when they stopped at the threshold, they shuffled back and forth a few times, indecisive.
It was more than a relief when Sherlock replied, though it seemed like an age had gone by in the meantime.
a force to be reckoned with.
“When?” Mycroft snapped over the mobile, and to his credit, John recognized the barest hint of a tremor in the normally controlled voice. Mycroft must have been profoundly alarmed - as he should be.

He eyed the two men up quickly, narrowing his gaze but continuing to focus on the frightened young man on the other end of line. “Can you hear me Chesney?”
John cleared his throat and shifted his legs, crossing one ankle over another, denims scraping along his skin as he did so.
The first email was a short background on Andrew: full name Andrew Russell, 33 years old, Glaswegian, no children, presented as an Omega at the age of 22, and bonded the same day to Terry Fanning. He’d worked full-time as an orderly at the Bellefette centre since 2006.

to be fucking kidding me.” It was the bloody six bells of Petham.
.’ So, why?”
“Well that also rules out Terry too, she said she trusted him. So who does that leave? Oh…
Sherlock managed to look rather gratified with John’s concurrence. He stopped his pacing, his breathing regular but his dark curls falling limply to his forehead with the exertion.
John cleared his throat, clenching his left hand, at war with his own destroyed sense of normalcy. He floundered, wanting to break the tension and the dreadful silence, but unwilling to be the first to succumb.
, have mercy and
John made a noncommittal noise and began pacing the room, waiting for the inevitable. Agent Waverly left with little fanfare, and in any other circumstance John would be smarting from the indignity of the situation. Yet, all he could think of was Sherlock.
Pausing only to send a quick text to Mycroft, John forced himself to his feet, feeling  the uselessness and impotent anger slough away, leaving only John Watson, and his terrible purpose.
The driver can explain what being a bonded omega is really about.
“A - Alright, now the first thing I need you to do is take a good deep breath and
"I told you. I value what we have more than I value my comfort. I can endure anything if I know he'll be better for it in the end." John explained, feeling something sort of fracture inside of him at the actual formation of the words he had so long suppressed.
You assume that because I didn't regularly pursue sexual gratification, I am asexual? Really John, as a doctor I would expect more from you – SH
A few more minutes was probably all they had before the strain of the situation broke him. John reminded himself that despite Chesney’s bravery he was still only 18 years old. Diving into the water to save a friend was far cry from watching your cousin bleed-out from a gut wound.
So when his mobile rang, shattering their rather
John blamed his lack of patience and increasing discomposure to the heat in the car and the worsening pains low in his belly. He shifted in the seat, crooking a finger in his collar to pull the woolly jumper away from his neck. He felt a bead of sweat slide away from his hairline and lose itself in the ribbed cotton of his vest. John shivered, the sensation calling attention to how overly sensitive he’d become in just the last twenty minutes or so. Across the car, in the low-light, Mycroft looked up and raised a questioning brow.
Sherlock knelt behind him reverently, and with one big hand clasping his ribs and the other over the jut of his collarbone, hauled John back onto the cradle of his pelvis - almost absentmindedly rubbing his rigid cock over the slick cleft with a pained exhale.
“Sadly no,” the hands offering the medications never wavered, “the current studies of suppressants on those newly changed are suspect at best, and neither myself nor my brother would like to see you…damaged. The pills are merely sedatives, benzodiazepines if you must know. They will not regulate or curb your heat, but they will calm you and make the heat more bearable. I’m afraid this is the only way I can help you, for now.”
Next morning Lisa and Chesney visit 221 B
John closed his eyes and calculated. Then, in one fluid movement, he stepped in front of the door and fired three shots point blank into the wood, splinters and paint chips exploding in small outward bursts.

Pole shift hypotheses are not the same as geomagnetic reversal,* the periodic reversal of the Earth's magnetic field (effectively switching the north and south magnetic poles).
, the call to action came.
John inhaled and peeled off the ruined pants with a wet squelch, tossing them aside. Finally, he stood front of his friend, boldly naked save for his army tags and scars. His cock felt as hard as it had ever been, and lubricant made its way down his thighs in an oily thick slide. He was exposed in every way possible, but unashamed and unafraid.
John realized with a sickening lurch what had happened. Sherlock knelt beside him, bloodied and pale, trembling just a bit as he dropped the gun back to the wooden floor. He didn’t spare the dead man even a cursory glance, but immediately began running panicked hands up and down John’s body, seeking wounds or signs of harm.
. He was a field surgeon, a general practitioner, and a bloody Army Captain - he wasn’t a gender specialist or psychiatrist. His schooling on the Omegaverse was forever ago, and he had barely paid attention anyway. That semester at University saw the World Cup, Sophie Chambers, and way too many nights getting pissed at the local. He was lucky he remembered anything, to be completely honest.
“Sherlock? You need to scent me fully so that they know I am yours.”
Sherlock continued, unaware of John’s ruminations. “Now the missing piece in all of this. Why did Lisa kill Rexfield?”
“Yeah, that all makes a sick sort of sense.” John wasn’t sure who to feel worse for: Lisa who’d been abused and then betrayed by her own body, or Harlan, irrevocably bonded to someone who could take no joy in the union. He couldn’t imagine how terrible it would’ve been for them both. Lisa and Harlan had been a team, and deeper than that, potential bondmates. When Rexfield impelled their change with violence, he’d robbed Lisa and Harlan of the chance to offer themselves freely to each other out of love. Instead, their bodies had become battlegrounds, every cell urging them to bond, but knowing that due to the circumstances they would only hurt each other - and hurt each other they did, over and over again, never able to forgive each other or themselves.
Mycroft layered one hand over the other, leaning towards John. “Well, in the purely scientific sense, it describes a shift in the geographic poles of the Earth, those on the axis of rotation. It was first posited by Brasseur de Bourbourg in reference to ancient Mesoamerican cataclysmic myths, and then, much more recently by an engineer in 1948. They speculate that these shifts, if they exist, take millennia to complete. However there are some doomsday theories that suggest these polar changes, should they happen rapidly, could tear the entire Earth apart. Then again, it could only be a theory, and the Earth might stay exactly the same.”
John could almost laugh at himself, almost. At this point it certainly wasn’t
John watched the outskirts of London streak by, the echoes of lights shining through the windows. After a long moment, he shifted his focus and stared back at his own reflection, noting the small beads of sweat already appearing on his forehead. That, along with the dull, achy waves of muscle cramps low in his abdomen, made him realize how quickly his heat was coming on. He idly wondered how long he’d have before he would truly give in to this biological urge and lose himself completely in the process.
