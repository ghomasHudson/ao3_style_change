Cas scoffs at him, sweeping his hair back, the roots are starting to show, matching the already dark sides, a style of mohawk that Dean was certain no one else on earth could pull off.  He needs a touchup.  Dean tells him as much.
, and Jim calls Laura “blue roses.”  He adores Pamela’s work, and she seems to know what he’ll want before he does, because when she sketches it up, it’s more perfect than what Dean’s mind could have ever dreamed up, and is just the right shade of blue.
With Castiel, he just mutters a quick “Thanks”, as he opens the car door and slides into the Impala. He doesn’t shut the door after himself.
Dean doesn’t pretend to know anything about paradise, pearly gates and the whole shebang, but if he had to go out on a limb, he figures it’d come pretty close to this. Wide, open countryside as far as the eye can see. Cool weather, a few foam-white clouds rolling over the mountains in the horizon and softening the harsher rays of sunlight, joined by the occasional fresh breeze. And crowning it all off, a tea-tinted lake where healthy bass leave delicate ripples on the otherwise calm surface. No matter how it ends for him, he’ll always have this.
Dean freezes. “Well, I was doing it for everyone here. But yeah I guess you’re the one who might end up using it the most,” he ends with a shrug.
Apparently reassured that Dean isn’t going to keel over, Cas lets go of him gently. A pair of denim inches apart, they’re sitting close enough anyway that either one could keep the other from falling.
“Thanks, Cas,” he says, then looks away for a second. He’s not sure what to make of Cas’ patient stare. “You know,” he continues, “for helping me out and everything. And uh, all is forgiven with you almost killing me with that damn floor. Just so you know.”
Dean’s tempted to make a joke about Cas being some Gas-n-Sip big shot, but the aching familiarity of his story stops him.
Dean barks out a laugh as he pushes himself up. He’s starting to get a sense of Cas’s offbeat humour.
“Well I suppose that if you look at it from a providential perspective-” A look of realization, followed by an annoyed tick at the corner of his mouth, dawns on Cas’s face. “You’re messing with me.”
“Dean, you might screw it up. Hell, Cas might screw up too, you know.” He gave Dean a small smile. “But then you’ll work it out. You always do. You forgive him and he forgives you and you get past it. That’s just how it goes,” he finished softly.
His mind couldn’t wrap itself around a future without a reason for all of them to spend a majority of their days, and their nights, together, crammed between glossy leather seats and blaring Zeppelin classics. Crappy diner food, late night research, temporary home sweet homes. It was all Dean knew.
“Can’t go a few hours without me?” Dean whispered into Castiel’s neck, hot breath tingling against his skin.
They barely talk as they make their way around the shelves. Dean doesn’t explain why he needs enough first-aid supplies to refurnish a small infirmary and Castiel doesn’t ask. Instead, he satisfies himself with making a few comments about whatever item he’s busy getting for Dean. This one he chose because he’s used it personally when a bee had stung him just outside. That one, a customer has praised, and said it’d made him feel more energized. And Dean just listens. He lets Castiel’s words course through him, lap at his edges and pool gently in empty spaces. It’s easy to do. His voice is the only one to resonate inside, and his presence the only one to be observed.
slide Cas’s hands up himself. Hand on hand action. Not exactly the most scandalous thing. He doubts even the most disgruntled Puritan would raise an eyebrow. He’s only trying to teach a man how to fish, for god’s sake. Why is he overthinking this so damn much?
Jack’s name was spoken more than any others; they wondered where they’d like to take him, what they wanted to show him. No clear consensus emerged from their avid discussion, as they all remained stubborn about their initial ideas. Sam was adamant that a natural history museum was the obvious destination; the issue with skipping childhood was that he’d also skipped on years of formal education.
“Hey, wait,” Dean goes to Castiel and, following his impulses which he hardly ever does when it comes to this kinda stuff, he grabs Castiel by the front of his coat and kisses him.  It’s brief, but when he pulls back, a wide, radiant smile splits across Castiel’s face, like the sunrise breaking across the dark horizon.
Dean clamps his mouth shut, letting Cas runs his hands gently through his hair, and Dean feels the emotions running up his throat, choking him, and he knows what’s coming and he knows he can’t stop it, even though he does not want to do this in front of Cas.
?!” Dean and Charlie exclaim together, drawing stares from the people around them, and Sam flaps his hands, trying to get them to be quiet.
They turned the corner, checking every nook and cranny for Croats, and there it was, the second biggest showdown of the century.  Sam and Lucifer, standing at the either end of a street.  Cas couldn’t hear what they were saying, but he knew Lucifer enough to know.
Cas breaks the news to his family about them being back together over thanksgiving, and comes over to Dean’s apartment that night, looking royally pissed off and like he was ready to throw a punch or two.  It was just Sam, Dean, Charlie, and Eileen at the apartment, Pamela having gone to meet her latest boyfriend’s friends, Benny and Andrea taking a sleepy Celeste home to Queens.  They had been watching
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas saw Dean, clearly coming to have another moment before he left.  He was predictable that way, he could never wait long for what he wanted.  Cas couldn’t help but smile and throw him a wink, which always drove him crazy, maybe he could finally convince Dean to join in on his group mind ritual, especially if Dean was in a more…open mood.
Dean expects Lee to stand up, put distance between them, give him the judgmental eyes that he’s become accustomed to.  But Lee doesn’t, he looks at Dean with nothing but acceptance.
There was the first kiss, the one he had put everything into, with wild abandon, when Cas had shown up at his house after his first day in Heaven.  He was supposed to be using his words, supposed to tell Cas what his final words had meant to him, how he felt the exact same way, had always felt the same way, but instead, his brain had disconnected, and he was pitching forward into Cas’ willing arms, pressing their lips together in a way that Dean had never thought would happen for him.  Is it normal to feel like someone lit a firecracker in your gut when you kiss someone?  Because that was how this kiss felt.
“So sorry to bore you,” Dean punches Cas’ bare shoulder, trying to ignore the blush creeping up his neck.
They walk, hand in hand, to the station, and Dean likes the feel of Castiel’s hand in his own, they fit well together, and even though Dean spent the majority of his life hating these kind of scenes in movies, he really doesn’t mind walking through the evening streets of New York holding hands with a really ethereally hot guy.
Dean swaggers over to the bar, getting the fanciest whiskey he can and hides out in a corner, watching Sam as he clearly impressed, making the fancy-schmancy lawyers laugh and chatter.  Dean steals a mini quiche from a passing penguin-looking waiter and tries to massage the feeling back into his hand.  That four hour thigh piece he had done today had cramped up his hand like a bitch, he’s dog fucking tired, and he knew it would take ten million years to get back to their apartment because the G was down for “construction” which had been going on for, like, six months longer than expected.  Man, fuck this fancy art gallery opening being in Hell’s Kitchen, it was gonna be so annoying to get back to Brooklyn.
Dean turns in early, and actually sleeps well for the first time in what feels like months.  But, despite his good sleep, Jo’s words still echo in the back of his head, and even burying it in the sand can’t drown them out forever.
instead of a worker, but it wasn’t like he was alone.  He, Benny, Pamela, and Charlie, they really all owned it together, which he had told them more than once, it was just his name on the papers.  And hell, they were popular.  The place was successful, they each drew different types of clients with their distinct styles; Charlie with her nerdy realistic tattoos, bright and colorful and fun, Pamela with her affinity for floral pieces so lifelike that they looked real, and Benny with script so delicate that people from around the world came to see him for it.  And then Dean, with his line work and his tiny details, the shop was always busy, and there were times that they had to stop taking walk ins at all.  Dean was lucky to have his life, really beyond lucky, and he loved his shop so much he could hardly stand it sometimes.
“What are the odds someone goes to the ER before dawn?” Cas is leaning on him now, holding a Mike’s Hard Lemonade which, though Dean often scoffs at these for being a bitch drink, they are a damn good bitch drink.
Castiel laughs and Dean should not have missed that sound but he does because he’s an absolute freak.
Before Dean can say anything else, they heard a convoy, Dean’s convoy, pull into the yard.  Dean, past Dean that is, left first, Cas following.  The knot in his chest loosened when he saw Dean get out of his Jeep, opening a beer and swigging it.  Yager was infected.  He saw it from a mile away.  Dean, his Dean, reached for his gun, and past Dean, ran towards him, shouting a warning to Yager, but he was already dead, a bullet planted firmly in his skull.
Thinking about something positive didn’t help, his only positive memories reminded him of Cas too.  Why the fuck did everything remind him of Cas?  Why couldn’t he just let Cas go?
“Castiel Novak,” the guy offers his hand, which Dean takes, knowing that his outstretched hand will fully display the tattoos on his arms and hands, which will probably scare Mr. Rich Art Dealer off.  Castiel gives a good handshake.  Firm, not too long.  He had always been taught that a person’s handshake, and Castiel gave a good one.
Looking around, he sees no one.  The Leviathan, Cas, gone.  Nothing but him, a broken angel trap, and a still smoking Leviathan to keep him company.
But even this time got old when Dean was gone for days.  Cas hated that he missed him, especially since this new Dean had come into the picture.  When he would leave like this, Cas would tell himself that he would find a new place to stay at camp, an empty cabin, maybe with Chuck or one of the other survivors.  He would talk himself up about it, start putting things in a bag, then taking them out, then putting them back in again.
Dean gets them all drinks from the pretty bartender, a whiskey for himself, a whiskey sour for Charlie, and a beer for Sam,  predictably, Charlie is chatting up a pretty girl in a
Cas gives him another one of those soft smiles, it looks the way a down pillow feels, and Dean wants to sink into it, but his dinner plans weren’t over yet, and he had sworn to himself that he would not, under any circumstances, jump Cas’ bones until they were well and truly done with dinner.
Dean goes down on him like the champ he is. He knows he’s good at giving head.  He knows he’s really good at giving head, especially since Cas, who had proclaimed loudly at Dean’s twenty-second birthday party that he could never get off with just a blowjob was coming in Dean’s mouth in less than three minutes.  Dean swallows, which had shocked Cas the first time he had blown him.
“Fuck,” Dean sighs, laying back on the couch, after pulling up his pants in an extremely dignified way, thank you very much.
“Then why the fuck do we live together, Dean” Cas burst out, unable to contain the anger, “Why do we live together and listen to your records and watch movies and sing in the car, and protect each other on runs and teach each other how to shoot and fuck with the lights on?  Why do we do all that together if you don’t like labels?  And you love to try and label me, which is pretty weird since you don’t like labels.”
Most nights, Dean would get too drunk.  About half of those nights he would wander out into the woods, Cas following, keeping his distance, making sure Dean couldn’t hear him.  He would stumble into the same clearing every time, fall to his knees, and scream to the sky.  He would scream yes to Michael until his voice gave out and he passed out on the ground.  And every time Cas would pick him up and carry him back to the house.  He would set him in their bed and pick up a book or some sewing or something.  He never came to bed when Dean was drunk, those words that Dean had said all those months ago ringing in his head.
“Lucky guess,” her smile and little look to Sam was telling, and Cas couldn’t keep a smile off his face either, Dean’s happiness, his spirit was infectious.  It had been so so long since Cas had seen Dean happy like this, it made his chest feel kinda tight for some reason, probably a human thing that he didn’t quite understand yet.
Sam drags himself out of bed at around nine, lured to the kitchen by the smell of sautéing onions and carrots on the stove, and Dean immediately puts a spatula in his hand and orders him to not let the veggies burn.
Dean huffs a little at that, it’s pretty sappy but also really…wise?  For his seventeen-year-old brother to be giving him advice like this.
Dean laughed one of his half-laughs.  The worst of all this is that Dean didn’t laugh like he used to.  He used to laugh this wonderful, full-throated laugh that would make the whole room vibrate.  Cas said this once, and Dean’s ears had turned red and he said that he must say that about everyone’s laugh, angel’s hearing or something like that.
So Dean does. Gently, he presses down his thumb on Cas’s skin and smooths his hold upwards on the wood until it looks like how he’d hold it himself. “There,” he says, satisfied.
Cas had tacitly agreed to stick around and neither Bobby, Sam nor him had asked ‘How long?’ Which was fine by Dean, since not knowing when they would part ways made him believe they might not after all. Great coping mechanism, right?
His eyes falls to where Claire taps her foot repeatedly. She’s looking down at him as if waiting to be formally dismissed.
A week in, even the smaller kids begin pitching in where they can, pulling out weeds and making two-way trips around camp getting people the stuff they need, one brick or one log at a time.
He laces his fingers together, and makes his thumbs rub at the joints. The sensation is welcome, but the distraction it offers is momentary. In a few seconds, his mind careens back to Claire’s finger twirling in her hair. The finger expands and tans, as the light lock of hair being played with caramelizes into a rich brown color. Cas pushes the annoying stray back behind his ear. His blue eyes widen and he leans towards-
Dean turned his head to face him, showing an exaggerated grimace pulling at his lips. “Yeah, sure. Like we don’t know how deals made by Winchesters usually turn out.”
He hears Cas shuffle while he shakes his leg, attempting to get rid of the knot in his knee. He bends down to grab the guitar neck.
Cas looks down at the hand on his shoulder then back up to Dean again. “There’s nothing I can change now. Nothing that will bring her back to her family again, at least. But here, I’ve found other ways to redeem myself. And new things,” without pausing, he lifts his arm to rest his hand on Dean’s, still rubbing soothing circles into his skin, “new
He stands motionless as he stares incredulously at the man swim idly towards them, looking peaceful enough to be taking a relaxing afternoon dip.
Jokes and beers were shared lazing down on the sand. True to his word, Sam drank two. Dean had one or two more. And Cas had one too, Dean having handed him one in an unspoken offering.
Dean shoots up from the pew. He eyes the golden sliver of light escaping from the door, barely left ajar by Cas. He turns back to him. “That was different. I always knew it was gonna be temporary."
When they reached Dean, they looked brighter and lighter than they had in months. In years. Dean couldn’t hide the matching emotion on his face.
In sync, they take a sweeping look at their surroundings, and what’s to become a home for their rescuees, many of whom Dean can now call friends. Charlie, the bubbly red-head. Jo and Ellen, the former, eager to prove herself and the latter, eager to protect the first. Kaia and Claire, the teenage do-it all duo, as Dean likes to call them. And Garth, officially rechristened as the “bear hug guy” by Dean, Sam and Bobby, the main targets of his overt affection.
He claps his hands once, clearing the air for good. “Alright, now that that’s done, let’s go. No need to shake on it and all that. Better hurry or Sam is gonna chew off my head when we get back. And by chew off, I mean nag at me ‘til I regret it to the core of my soul."
A soft guitar thrum emanates, joining the sound of the crackling fire and the other rustles of the night.
They laugh and drink and talk, Pamela tells them a story about when she accidentally met Sid Vicious wandering around Brooklyn after getting lost after a show in Detroit.  Charlie ends up reenacting an entire Pokemon episode from memory for Celeste, which both Dean and Celeste find extremely amusing, and Sam tells them all about this new client they were getting, some rich guy name Crowley, who flirts with everyone the second he comes in the door.
They laugh at the echo of their words, bouncing between now and Purgatory all those months ago, when he had thought he had lost Cas…again.
They lie together for a while after that, Cas traces the lies of the veins in his arms, then the constellations of the freckles on his stomach, and Dean drifts to sleep with Cas curled up next to him, his arm around Cas, Cas’ arms around his waist.
The benefit to this is that he doesn’t have time to worry about the big Thing, so everything just sort of slides right back to normal, which is fine by Dean.  The less conflict in his life the better.
He’s standing with one hand on his hip, the other shielding his eyes from the midday sun as he watches Dean walk up to him.
“It’s goddam cold is what it is,” Dean replies, his hands gesturing accusingly towards the ground. “That’s what bedrolls are for, you dumbass,” he adds, but there’s no heat to it.
If Cas is startled, he doesn’t let it show, and instead regards Dean like he’s waiting for him to get on with it.
If possible, the stranger’s half-confused squint intensifies. “I’m not sure I understand,” he says in a gruff voice.
“I’m fine, Cas,” he brushes away with a wave of his hand. “Tell me, you got some wings hidden under that trench coat?”
Sam snaps him right out of it. “All right, time for me to get some shut-eye.” He pushes himself off the bark and stretches his overgrown arms above his head with a yawn. “You good with the first watch, Dean?”
“What about you. What’re you doing in the middle of nowhere?” Dean’s hands gesture vaguely at their surroundings. “Looking for a hot piece of land to hoist up your new house of the Lord?”
Sam lets himself be pushed away by his brother, while Dean shouts a “We’ll be right back!” over his shoulder.
Cas doesn’t insist and they march in silence for a few minutes. They’re trailing behind the others but not by much. Dean gazes down below, where a colony of footsteps and hoof prints mark the soil.
They carried their weapons bag, now filled with towels and sunscreen, down to a quiet stretch of the beach. After a short battle against strong gusts of wind, Dean laid down three towels on the fine, white sand. He wasted no time in stripping down to a pair of basic black swim shorts while Sam did the same.
After the unexpected success of their expedition to Apocalypse World, which had not only brought back their mother, but Charlie and Bobby as well, something had set aflame in Dean. He yearned for a break; something he’d never deemed possible before. Some kind of vacation. Him, Sam and Cas, laying on a beach, sipping cold beers and watching the sun take its lazy dive into the sea. With Jack on their side and Lucifer marooned in another universe, the world had never had a better chance of keeping afloat on its own. At least for a while.
“You planning to sleep here?” he asks Cas, the corner of his eye watching him shimmy closer to the grass.
Sam pushes his hair back impatiently and sighs deeply. “Dean, he came up to us, unarmed and undressed. He looked about ready to cry when you gave him my coat. Sure, we don’t know him. But he looks pretty harmless to me.”
“Because I didn’t want my decision to influence yours in any way. I wanted the choice to be your own, so I waited. But now I see that that might take longer than I had suspected.”
“Take care of yourself, Dean,” Cas says with another smile, this one softer. He squeezes Dean’s shoulder once and lets his hand slide off back to his side. “I might not be here to help the next time you come.”
She’s only the first person ever to beat Bobby at holding his liquor. Pretty impressive, really. You had to be there. By the time she was downing her fifteenth shot of moonshine, five guys were already passed out on the floor. Bobby included.” He smirks before he adds sneakily, “Oh, and Dean too.”
Cas looks up at the low sound of Dean’s voice. There’s something different in his gaze, something sorrowful, that Dean can’t get a hold of, leading him to turn his attention back to the instrument below.
Dean tenses instinctively at the incredible closeness of it all, Cas’s nose suddenly pressed next to his, the tingling sensation caused by his light stubble, the warm lips caressing his. Involuntarily, he emits a soft sound, non-interpretable even to himself. He buries the hand not enclosed in Cas’s into the layer between Cas’s waist and the folds of his shirt. Together, they sway back towards the wall until Cas’s back collides softly with it.
, being lulled to sleep by the chants of southern wildlife held an undeniable rural appeal. Dean loved it, so naturally, Castiel had made it so.
here. There was no reason to use his powers here, in this farm. This little morsel of heaven was safe — it was theirs.
They’re still on the road when night begins to fall. Wanting to make up for lost time, they’d decided to push on for a bit longer, even if travelling at sundown made them all feel a little uneasy.
He cuts off Dean as he opens his mouth again to argue. “And not all preachers act like Nick.” His breath hitches. “Some of them are good. For some of them, it’s not about the number of followers or how far they can push them before they break,” he finishes earnestly.
Dean rubs at his eyes with the back of his hand, drawing out a yawn at the same time. The light coming from outside has dimmed,  basking the walls inside in an orangey-gold aura.
At second glance, it doesn’t look much better. Heaps of stony rubble, remnants of structured defences, and lonely bricks that catch at Dean’s feet, getting a curse out of him before he catches his balance again. His eyes linger on stray cigarettes littered here and there, probably by some guys who thought they’d save a few bucks skipping the town supply store and heading here instead.
He heard Dean exhale a small huff of laughter. “You know, you could always turn them down or something. Your kingdom, your rules.”
Castiel slides up effortlessly in his saddle, making the soft curve of his back disappear. “What would you like to know?”
kingdom,” Castiel corrected. “And it’s fine, I don’t mind them.” He paused, then added, “I was mostly missing you.”
But Cas doesn’t take the obvious cheap shot at Dean, something he appreciates. “Sounds like it was quite the night.”
While some of the tension had drained away by the time they reached the car, Dean was still unable to completely let go of the knot in the pit of his stomach. Even as he sped away from that godforsaken town, with his crashed-out brother dozing off in the backseat, his grip stayed taut on the wheel.
“I can help you carry this to your car if you’d like?” he offers, nodding towards the bag, looking large, but not necessarily requiring a two-person effort.
Dean huffs out at what he’s about to do, rubbing his palms together before he immobilises them, holding them pressed together from wrist to fingertips.
Trudging behind his brother, Dean rubs at the back of his neck. “Yeah, sorry, Cas. Just needed to sort something out.”
Darkness hit them as they emerged outside, the absence of any nearby streetlight blatant. They did a rapid sweep of their shadowy surroundings and of themselves, blindly checking for any further injuries. Although Sam tried control the pained expression on his face, Dean’s eyes were drawn to the sticky substance oozing from a gash below Sam’s knee. Placing an arm around Sam’s waist, they began their journey back to the motel, where the Impala was obediently awaiting their return. What had seemed like a short stroll back when they’d walked around town had now transformed into a grinding trek back to safety. One they eventually completed, but at the expense of Dean’s back and his nerves, having to turn his head around every thirty seconds to assure himself that no murderous vampire was lurking behind them.
When he set himself straight again, he rubbed at the edge of his nose and smoothed a hand over his light stubble.
Dean considers it for a moment before he’s reminded of what had meant to follow the chant. A few minutes late and they would have walked into a house of corpses. A charged shudder runs through him.
“My job makes it so I don’t really stay in the same location for too long,” Cas says, taking a quick look back at the store they just came from. “I oversee the well-functioning of Gas-n-Sips around the country and evaluate them. I’ve only been here for a week, but I don’t expect to stay at this one for more than a month.”
As he’s about to tell him to just spit out, Sam finally fesses up. “It’s just...” he casts his eyes downwards before looking up hopefully at Dean, “maybe we could stay here for a bit? I mean, Bobby’s kinda right, we’re not done watching out for them yet. Just look around us, they don’t even have roofs over their head!”
Dean is going to build the best fucking settlement he can, no matter how long it takes, and here’s to hoping it takes a long fucking time.
But these past few weeks... They’d trudged through swamps, endured mosquito bites, snakebites and a close call with the jaws of a gator, and gone nights without a fire because of the goddam humidity. All that on a few hours’ worth of sleep and disgusting tinned fruits.
Cas had easily blended in with the rest of their merry little band. People liked that helping out was a second nature to him, it made him approachable. They’d come to him about injuries, to ask if this herb or that berry was edible, and once Dean thought he’d passively overhead someone wonder if Cas would listen to their confession. As far as Dean could tell, Cas genuinely wanted to lend a hand.
At his other side, Bobby uncrosses his arms and places them on his hips. “That’d be the smart move.”
“Look,” Dean starts as coolly as he can, “you know what was Dad’s second most important rule: never lay your cot twice on the same ground.”
Like some kind of psychic, or like the little brother who grew up beside him, Sam says with a grin, “Finders keepers?”
Dean knows this deadly blend of puppy-eyes and passionate plea. He’s seen it a thousand times, both as a witness and the receiving end. It’s the one that means Sam has something close to his heart and doesn’t want to let go. It tells him Sam’s gotten more attached to their runaway group than he should have.
The past few weeks had been a sludge covered nightmare. Ever since leaving the barn, they’d ridden relentlessly, only stopping at nightfall to set up camp and setting off at the first light. Every mile they put between that place and themselves made them breathe out a sigh of relief, but their rhythm was a punishing one bound to give out eventually.
Turning around, Dean’s unruffled to find a rugged-looking Bobby, his worn flat cap a spot-on reflection of the man himself. Life on the road had never suited him. He’d always been more comfortable in his cabin up north, helping the bounty hunters and outlaws he could tolerate, and where he was able to lie in a real bed at night instead of a thin bedroll. A bedroll which would drive him towards an early lumbago-related death, he liked to remind them daily.
The first days start off slow; chopping trees, gathering building supplies and food from the closest town, Horseshoe Hollow, about an hour’s ride away from camp. In the beginning, maybe a third of the camp really gets into it, the rest too content to finally be catching a break to switch back to busy mode. It takes them three days to start feeling guilty (or maybe catch the not so-subtle death glares from those toiling away) and roll up their sleeves.
“Wanna tell Cas we’re going?” Sam asked, his head nodding towards the shore, where a lone, shirtless angel stood motionless, facing the sea.
Dean swallows. There’s some truth to it but everything stills feel raw. Turning his attention away from Sam, he studies Cas standing a dozen meters away, listening intently to whatever Bobby is saying and nodding his head politely every few words or so. He looks harmless to Dean too. Especially in Sam’s oversized vest.
He waves his free hand at Cas. “Pshh, it was nothing. No biggie, honestly. Barely took me any time. So no need to thank me, really.”
Sam watched Dean’s reaction closely, probably making sure his words didn’t fall on deaf ears. And they didn’t, not completely.
Unaware of Dean’s train of thought, Castiel smoothly gets back to his task. After less than five minutes, he types a few numbers into the machine in front of him and looks up to Dean. He must be about an inch shorter than him, Dean muses.
For a moment, Dean feels at peace. The buzz in him has quieted. The urge to look over his shoulder is more or less gone. He doesn’t truly think that Castiel understands that Dean’s long nights mean carnage, monsters and grave digging.  But it doesn’t matter to him right now.  He feels grounded.
When Cas finally speaks up, it drowns out all other sounds. The floor doesn’t creak anymore. The muffled commotion from outside dies off. Dean can only perceive Cas’s voice. “There was a little girl, a girl from my congregation, who was inside the church when it collapsed due to the fire.” He takes in a breath. “But there was so much smoke- she might have already been gone by then.”
To be honest, Dean would have been content listening to Cas name birds and other creatures all night long. Once night truly fell, he’d continue pointing out stars and constellations to Cas, an endeavour started during their last night watch, and insist that every good cowboy knew how to use them for guidance, relaying what his dad had taught him decades ago to the best of his memory. But Dean knew they had to return to camp eventually, before their absence became a source of worry.
“We both seem to be migratory birds. That’s why I thought it’d be good to give you a way for you to contact me. I... I printed it on your receipt.” He then adds quickly, “If you ever need my help again.” He pauses. He looks like he’s considering something. “If you want to. I won’t mind.”
If you’d asked him a week ago if building a church for a community who’d almost gulped down lethal ale to find ‘the greater truth’ or whatever bullshit Nick had fed them, his answer would have been some vehement variant of “hell no”. If you barely make it out of a whirlpool, you don’t jump back into it the next day. That was just pure common sense.
Their epic battle had drawn in the attention of a few bystanders on the beach. A tall silver-haired woman had her hands suspended in mid-air, an uncapped bottle of sunscreen in one of them. A father and his little girl, or so Dean assumed, had both stopped adding more sand to a mound most likely hiding a pair of adult-sized feet.
Cas’s gaze lifted up from where Dean’s fingers were loosely circled around his arm to meet his eyes.
Turning his back to Cas, Dean paces to the unhung cross. There are delicate flowers etched on each end, with their interlaced roots, or maybe vines, meeting in the middle to form a diamond-shaped blossom. No engraving is needed to disclose the author behind the piece.
Thankfully, Cas senses Dean’s awkwardness and lets it slide, gracefully moving on to an easier topic of discussion, such as the beautiful sunset occurring outside or the fact that they’re running low on lamp oil.
Once the stranger reaches the bank, Sam bends forward and stretches out a hand to help him up on the ridge. The man reaches for it in a strong grip and swiftly climbs up to stand on solid ground with them.
He turns to Cas with his brows creased, hoping this is simply another instance of him being weird. But his mouth is set in a hard line and he’s keeping quiet.
He knew how he sounded. Sam too apparently, since he seemed to be hesitating about what to say next. He dropped the bag down back on the sand and took a look around the beach before facing Dean again.
“I know,” she groans, rolling her eyes for good measure while shoving a roguish blonde curl behind her ear. “That’s not all I meant anyway.”
Dean stops him with a hand. “Just sit down. I’ll be right back,” he tells him. “Man probably don’t even know what a bedroll looks like,” he mutters as he turns away, loud enough for Cas to hear.
But it hadn’t been recently. No boot or horse tracks in his immediate sight, and none that had led up to here.
They finished off their meal unhurriedly, their bodies and mind grateful for this rare moment of respite in their lives. Dean chatted amiably with their waitress as he paid the bill, while Sam leisurely browsed through some brochures on display by the entrance.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. What the hell is he thinking? Inside a church of all places. Not that he cares but still. They built it for Cas, not for Dean to have a hideout to daydream about him.
Like Dean, his head seems elsewhere and there’s no effort made from his side to start a conversation. He’s perched by the shore, where his long trench coat is making him seem taller than he is. The ruse isn’t enough to fool Dean, whose past few days have been spent observing him, inwardly jotting down his features, his ticks, his patterns of speech. Dean would call it creepy except he felt he’d gotten way past that.
“Trust me, I know,” Dean says, tossing his head back and lifting his eyes upward until the stars comes into view.
He shook his head. “It’s just, I come here, finally goddam ready to tell you that I want you to stay with us.” His head shook again. “No, with
Pretty soon, the darkness becomes too thick a layer for them to see where they’re stepping, and Bobby calls it a day. They set up camp, prop up the tents and start a few fires, and it’s not long before a light-hearted chatter starts floating above slowly-heating pots. It’s become an effortless routine for them.
Dean sighs and throws him a hopeless look. “Alright, wait here, preacher. I’ll fix you a cot from the horses.”
Cas went on. “It’s almost physically impossible for me to forget anything. And yet, I’m so afraid that I’ll forget any of this.”
Any reservation he’d had about Cas had vanished when he’d watched him hoist a kid up on his shoulders and whinny like a horse while he carried her across.
“I am.” He pauses. “Or I used to be. Is a preacher still a preacher without a church?” he muses aloud, avoiding their eyes.
“Judging by your earlier disgust, I’m guessing this isn’t for you?” he says, his eyes flicking up to Dean with a knowing gleam.
For a few more minutes, they continued to play around like that, until eventually, they tired out and tread their way through the sandy shore back to Dean. As they passed the little girl crouching over her growing mountain of sand, she stood up and clapped excitedly. They both smiled fondly at her, although Cas added a courteous little bow in recognition.
Dean’s grin drops when he notices Cas’s blank expression. His dad should have also taught him how to keep his mouth shut sometimes.
What followed the waitress’ short but menacing speech was a jumble of sharp fangs, deafening gunshots and a sharp cry of pain coming from Sam. Snapping his head at the sound, Dean spotted his brother in an attempt to tear his leg from a pair of fangs attached to a gore-covered vampire. Although not one to usually run away from a fight, Dean made the rapid decision to tug Sam free and get the hell out of here. With a sharp kick to the vampire’s jaw and a strong grip around Sam’s arm, Dean successfully wrangled him out of the fang’s hold to make a run for the exit, his limping brother in tow struggling to keep up with the pace.
Cas absently patted his bare chest with his towel. His eyes looked almost translucent in the sunlight. Dean felt he was closer than ever to grasping their intentions.
And yet, the simple corner store seems awake, its white lights shining outwards and its glass doors unlocked. Inside, Dean is unsurprised to see he’s the only customer there. Other than the Impala, the only car outside had been an old Lincoln, parked on the employee spot.
“Hey, we’re here to cool off,” Dean said, raising his palms in defense with a shrug. “It’s not like we’re on a job or something.”
“Look, I don’t know Cas,” Dean continues, “He seems like a nice guy. Maybe a bit weird, but nice. But we can’t go and trust every stranger we meet.”
Cas stops a few inches from Dean, lines of faint consternation pressed above his brows. “I know you have faith in the people around you. In your brother and Bobby. So why don’t you have that same faith in yourself?”
Stepping out the front door, Castiel was immediately hit by a comfortable wave of heat. Just humid and warm enough to be coincidentally reminiscent of a Kansas summer night.
Fortunately, discussions of corpses and vampiric suspicions hadn’t been enough to destroy their appetite. As they rarely were. Remembering the diner they’d passed on their way into town, Dean made a strong case to replenish themselves there, and despite Sam’s initial objection at eating another greasy meal, they’d shortly ended up sitting in a booth by the back. While discussing their next move, Dean had happily scarfed down his bacon cheeseburger and fries, whereas Sam had stuck to the classic Caesar salad. Without any clear lead in sight, they were left with little choice but to go investigate the bodies themselves, hoping that they would reveal some hidden detail they’d missed.
Dean and Castiel watch the cars pass by, their drivers yawning at the wheel, while they head for the Impala. They keep their pace slow, dragging their feet and displacing dust. Neither of them have somewhere to be immediately. Castiel is already where he needs to be, and Dean knows that Sam was well enough to give him a call and complain about him being gone.
Thank youuu for reading through this fic!! Here's hoping you enjoyed it (and that Destiel becomes canon in S15! :p ) You're more than welcome to leave a kudos/comment! <3
Cas twists away from Dean to fish something out of his trench’s long pockets. When he turns back to Dean again, he presents the can in his hands like a gold digger showing off his findings.
As if his spine is suddenly unclenched, Dean slumps forward and clasps his hands between his knees. For the first time since stepping inside the church, he notices the trapped heat, the way his shirt sticks to his back, the stale air he breathes in.
As he’s about to ask Cas what he’s talking about, he’s hit with a glimpse of understanding. “Hey man, it’s okay. Trust me, we all suck the first time,” he tells Cas with a shrug. “But the more you fish, the better you’ll get. Plus, it’s not like we’re close to starvation. We can survive a few more days without fish. For some ungodly reason, we still have like twenty freakin’ cans of peaches left. So, uh, no need to feel bad and apologize and all that.”
Before Dean or Sam had any time to come up with a Plan B, they’d become aware of another presence in the building. More than one, judging by the barely audible scuffle of approaching footsteps. Underequipped and unprepared for a fight they hadn’t expected, the small pack of vampires which had sneaked into the room easily overtook them. Among the group, the brothers easily recognized the young waitress Dean had chatted up less than an hour ago. Smirking, she explained pleasantly that hunters were not welcome here. This town was theirs. On the other hand, tourists were tolerated, and even lured here by the Americana quality of the classic motel by the side of the road, or the unremarkable but endearing rock landmark. Usually, once they’d outlived their dual purpose of distraction and food, they were disposed of swiftly and efficiently, before anyone caught a whiff of something unusual. Unfortunately, someone had clearly messed up this time, or the waitress would not have heard two fake FBI agents discussing vampire activities in her diner. Dean would have felt bad for the poor sucker who’d botched his job if Sam and him weren’t currently so occupied with being surrounded by a horde of aggravated vampires.
gotta know if you feel like you’re just getting dragged along for the ride or if you actually want this.”
They were reaching the end of the rope and they could all feel it. Even Sam’s non-stop optimism was beginning to falter under all they’d been through.
Castiel hums slowly in agreement. Products begin to be picked up one after the other by meticulous hands and scanned efficiently under a faint red light. They are then placed with a rustle into a brown canvas bang.  The process is only slowed when Castiel plucks a green and chunky-looking kind of drink.
“Yeah, but there isn’t hot chocolate out here.  Now come on,” Sam waits expectantly for Dean by the door, and Dean takes a quick glance at Cas before heading inside the blessedly warm bar, trying not to think about what would have happened if they hadn’t come outside.
His back hits the wall and Cas is pressed up against him, reaching for the bottle that Dean is holding over his head.  He reflects, at a later date, that neither of them really realized what was happening until it was too late.
They slot themselves together, finding the perfect way to both be comfortable.  Cas’s breath is warm on his neck, but Dean is damn tired, and he already feels his eyes getting heavy.
On the drive back across town, Dean takes some time to reflect.  Realistically, he and Cas couldn’t keep this up.  Dean would meet a girl, Cas would meet…someone, and they would each get married, settle down.  Dean would have kids, Cas wouldn’t.  Dean would have a picket fence and a house in a suburb, Cas wouldn’t.  They couldn’t keep up with the agreement, which was created in a time when they were young and stupid.  They were adults now, real grownups with real jobs, they couldn’t be sneaking around their friends and family and pretending like this didn’t mean anything.  Plus, Dean was straight.  He had only ever been into women and that was that.
Dean had started doing things his own way, sometimes without Cas.  It stung when he would get up in the morning and Chuck would tell him that he was already gone for the day.  Or days, sometimes it really felt like weeks.  At the beginning of these trips, Cas would savor the time alone.  Cas would smoke for a while, read, listen to his favorite records and enjoy being in his own head, instead of trying to pick apart the thoughts of someone else’s.  He had never had any idea of what it was like to be alone.  Angels weren’t ever alone, and it’s not like they had ever had ample space for some good old fashioned me-time.  He was picking up all kinds of new hobbies when Dean was gone.  A sweet old woman named Breanettia taught him how to knit, and he was working on his very first hat (maybe his ears wouldn’t be so damn cold this winter), One of the older men, Sampson, was teaching him how to cook.  Not only did the alone time give him some space to look at himself, but he felt like he was becoming himself.  Even if everything around them was terrible and the threat of attack from Croats, demons, the military, or even Lucifer himself loomed over them, Cas felt like a person.
Sam looks up from his book, sprawled out and looking like he was at least ten feet tall.  Dean was still sorta pissed he didn’t get the tall genes.  It’s not fair.
Dean has to fight back a laugh at that, because Cas is just so goddamn perfect he’s afraid of touching him with ink staining his fingers, and he leans in and kisses him, slowly, gently, in a way that he hasn’t allowed himself to since part of his heart got taken to San Diego without him attached.  Cas responds, and it’s one of those kisses that doesn’t need to lead to anything else.  It just is.  Simple, soft, brief, replacing the burning fire with something less easily definable.
“My apologies,” comes a familiar voice, and Dean practically breaks his neck to turn and see Castiel, looking damn fine in a long coat and beat up jeans, a t shirt visible through the open buttons of his coat.  Dean swears the very sight of him takes all the air out of his lungs.
He could hear the ache in his voice.  Cas wanted nothing more than to reach out and let Dean know that he was alright, he could hear him, he would wake up.
He remembers more than anything else, he remembers the last night, the night that he person he had…the person he had been with had stiffed him for the one hundred and fifty hard earned dollars he was owed.  Without that money, he hadn’t been able to afford the fifty dollar rent at the hostel where he had stayed the last few nights, and the shelters were full, overcrowded with the unfortunate in the bitterly cold Chicago air.  So Dean, barely sixteen and chilled to the bone, his feet aching from cold as the damp streets soaked through his shoes, riddled with holes now, with only a backpack and two granola bars he had stolen from a gas station the week before, walked around the city, trying his best to find a semi dry place to catch a couple of hours of sleep.
Cas walks over to the mirror, and he stares at the stencil for what feels like ten minutes, before he turns to Dean and looks at him, really looks at him.
“I do, all possible meanings intended,” Dean reaches for Cas, bridging the too-many inches of space between them, “Come here, I need it.”
Cas had gone looking for Dean one morning, after Risa had come banging on their door, saying they had a lead on the Colt and needed to go as soon as possible.  He found him coming out of Jane’s cabin, tousle-haired and with an almost sheepish look on his face.  Cas drew up short when he saw Dean, and the look on Dean’s face was only more pronounced when he pulled away from Jane and looked up at him.
“I do my best,” Cas bites his lip as he says that, and Dean suddenly wants to ditch this movie, but he’s making a serious effort to take things slow here, no matter how hard Cas is making that for him.
“Well said Sam,” Charlie smacks her hand on the table, ruffling the white cloth covering the plasticy wood.
Dean is not a fan of the way, anytime Castiel is closer to him than about five feet, Dean’s heart feels the need to go absolutely nuts.   He wants to run again, like he always does when he feels anything in the region of his heart, but Castiel’s eyes are on him and his mouth moves without permission, not allowing him to back away, frozen in place with Castiel inches from him on the damp sidewalk.
Dean pressed his chest into Cas’ back.  His heat radiated through both of their shirts, soaking Cas like a warm summer day.
“You would’ve regretted it if you disfigured me, I would’ve brought it up fifteen times a day for the rest of your life,
Their entrees arrive and, as usual, Cas is right, the steak is amazing.  It’s so good, in fact, that Dean strikes up a conversation with the resident chef, Samandriel over it when he practically passes out over the bearnaise sauce on his filet mignon.
Cas is itching to be the big spoon as soon as they hit the pillows, and Dean lets him, even though Dean’s taller and he’s always been of the opinion that the taller person should be the big spoon.  But it’s nice, Cas curled around him, Dean being able to hold his hands and arch so that his back is pressed flush with Cas’ chest, and he can feel Cas’ nose in his hair.
“Having a good time?” he’s jerked out of his thoughts by Anna, who is tall and willowy and red-haired, beautiful by any and every standard.  She’s dressed in white which is in contrast to the glass of blood red wine she’s holding.
“Listen, we really need to be more focused on finding sanitary products.  We’re almost out again and it’s only been a week.”
“Can I tell you something?” Dean says, fidgeting with the edge of the cream-colored couch cushion he has his back pressed against.
Dean expects Cas’ eyes to read pity, or anger, or shame, anything negative, because how could he be so stupid as to think that Cas would actually want to date someone like him?  What he does not expect is for Cas to smile this smile, the one he saw the morning after Dean had spent the night, and Dean’s chest suddenly feels all warm and bubbly.
That gets a chuckle out of Dean, and Lee’s eyes brighten at the sound, like he’s trying to impress him, when Dean should be doing the impressing, since he’s the one staying in Lee’s house.
Their kiss goodnight is still too brief and too clipped, and Dean watches Cas get on the elevator, still feeling half guilty, half defiant about this whole thing.
Cas sees him eyeing the place as they walk toward the restaurant, Cas and Dean a little behind the group, under the pretense of not hearing Charlie complain about everything for a few seconds.
They spend the rest of the evening chatting with Ellen, being graced by Charlie every so often as she travels between her nerd friends and them, begging free drinks out of Ellen with false promises that she would pay her friends’ tab at the end of the night.  Ellen was too smart to believe it, but never strict with Charlie like she was with the rest of them.  Charlie had always been able to get away with anything, probably because she was so goddamn smart and nice, damn her.
“It was great having you,” Dean says as they stand in the freezing air outside, the door safely between them and the prying, gossipy eyes of Sam and Charlie.
Dean’s heart jumps all the way to his throat and he has to fight the urge to tackle her to the ground.  She can tell that in his face as he scrambles towards her.  She dodges him again, when the hell did she get so fast?  She holds the phone away from Dean as far as she can, and Dean leans over her, fingers outstretched and grabbing at the air, desperate to grab the little device where Cas’ unread words waited for him.
Hello!  I have worked way too hard this week and so here's another ~saucy~ chapter of the love of my life for you guys!  I really really hope you enjoy, every comment, hit, and kudos really make me so happy, thank y'all so much!! :)
“Well I am just that smart, and expert if you will,” he laughs as Cas rolls his eyes, he had forgotten how easy it could be with him, especially when he wasn’t standing in his own way,
Ugh, listening to his emotions sucks, this was all a lot easier when he could pretend to be an ostrich and stick his head in the sand every time something got uncomfortable.
The driveway isn’t too long, isn’t too short, perfectly wide enough for the Impala, leading him to a bright little clearing facing a clear glass lake.  There’s a detached garage nestled in between the tall trees, and a small house positioned with a perfect view of the water.  It’s such a pretty place, and something tells Dean to get out of the car.  He follows his impulses, turning off the car and leaving the keys in the ignition, no one’s going to boost it in Heaven, after all.
Well nothing was different, they were doing the same thing they’d been doing for years.  It did not make Dean feel good that other people were picking up on the energy change though.
“Well, coming in late and now leaving early?  This is going on your permanent record.  Don’t make us write you up.”
“Do you ever get tired of each other?” Charlie asks, and Dean does his best to hide the blush that immediately heats his ears.
“Well hello to you too, Sam,” Charlie sets the bottles down on the coffee table and launches her shoes into the corner.
It was a peace that lasts several weeks, Dean hangs out with the gang when he can, but spends most of his time with her, soaking up the fact that their relationship is actually in a good place for once, trying not to take a second of it for granted.  Of course, they’re both stubborn, type A personalities, and that means their loud opinions couldn’t be ignored for long.
“Look Dean, you’ve gone after it plenty of times after I was laid up, and you’re going to go after it with or without me.  And I prefer to keep an eye on you.”
“Come on now,” Benny says, leaning back in his chair so only the back two legs were on the ground, “Don’t exaggerate.”
As they pick up their coats, turning in their stupid paper tickets to the guy at coat check, Dean sees Castiel talking to some old guy in a tuxedo that looked like it was from 1945.  He meets his eyes, like water meeting a tree line, and it takes a little more willpower than Dean would like to tear his eyes away and head out into the chilly fall night.
“Wowee, that was a hell of a goodbye,” Charlie teases as Dean opens the door, “Let me guess, reading poetry to each other.”
“Because you’re the problem here.  The common denominator of all my goddamn problems.  Your money, your family, your stupid huge fucking apartment on Park, the neighbors you have that judge me when they see me, everything is the problem.”
Cas isn’t doing anything special, not really. That’s the thing. He just belongs. And Dean likes that, as simple as it sounds. He goes along with the plan, even when the plan is to partner up with Dean on a fishing adventure when he has no idea how to tie a hook to a line himself.
Hearing a familiar trudge come up behind him, Dean’s free hand flies above his head to readjust the rounded brim of his hat before he hoists himself up again.
“On the ground?” Dean scoffs in disbelief as he straightens up. “You trying to catch death or something?”
The strangers’ eyes squint as his head cocks slightly to the side. “I’m sorry. Perhaps English isn’t your native tongue?”
Now, the Cas sitting in the back of the Impala was a sharp contrast with the sleepy angel Dean had witnessed a week before. Although his chin rested on his forearms occupying the empty space of the front seat between the two brothers’ shoulders, his back was leaned towards the front windshield and his eyes fixed on the fluid landscape of nemophila flowers lapping at the edges of the sea-side road. His hair danced wildly with salty winds swishing in from the open windows.
Cas lets go of his grip on the door to step away from the car and lets Dean give it a satisfying slam. Dean gives Cas one last look through the side window, one which hopefully doesn’t reveal too much of what he’s feeling right now. Gratitude, contentment or whatever it is. Cas returns the stare with a tranquil smile.
Sam looks down at him, the corners of his mouth lifted in a hopeful smile. “I guess we got lucky for once.”
The belief alone had cascaded and transformed into innumerable new possibilities, and Dean spent hours at night imagining and planning for them in anticipation. Certain daydreams were modest and mundane. He saw them putting their books and weapons down, driving down to Las Vegas for a week-end of strip and fun. He’d done it a few times before, but only with Sam. Maybe this time, they could bring their angel along and teach him a thing or two about poker. He reckoned they’d be unstoppable once they’d convinced Cas that ethically-questionable dealings could transform casinos into a substantially more enjoyable, and profitable, experience.
Castiel forms a remarkably dissimilar picture with his buttoned up, white dress shirt, its sleeves affectionately rolled up, revealing a pair of tan forearms and strong hands. Over it, a blue vest which bears his employee tag, both appearing to be in perfect condition. And despite fine lines adorning his face, at the corner of his lips and eyes, his expression says awake.
Shaking his head disapprovingly, Dean turns to Claire and props his arms lazily on the bench behind him.
Tonight, the fires feel a little warmer and the tents a little more welcoming after their prolonged journey. Spirits are up thanks to the fish being cooked on improvised skewers; one of the good things that had come out that river.
“It’s not about what I want.” Dean snaps back. He regrets it instantly and tries to continue more coolly. “It’s about... it’s about me spending my whole life drifting from town to town. It’s about me not knowing any other way to live.”
As Dean looks into the clear blue of Cas’s eyes, all he wonders is what will happen when Cas leaves. How can he feel the loss already when the warm denim beneath his fingers is a solid reminder of his presence?
“She came very often to visit. After a while, I realized why- she loved lighting the candles. We had dozens inside. It saved me quite a lot of time. To reward her good work, I started giving her a few cents every time she came by. Of course I felt responsible for what happened. I still do.” Dean’s heart drops at the crack in his voice. “I would have felt responsible even if I hadn’t been encouraging her to visit. The church... the church was my home, but I would have rebuilt it. My parish would have helped me rebuild it. She was the one I wanted to do right by.”
For a moment, Dean wonders at his vision’s advanced ability to zero-in on Cas no matter the situation nor the crowd.
Dean leaned his cheek into Cas’s palm, then lifted his hand to take a hold of Cas’s before bringing his palm to his lips. “Yeah, I know. Deep inside me, there’s a part of me that knows it. But I think I needed to hear it.” He pressed a gentle kiss onto Cas’s skin. “Thank you.”
Sam nods to himself. “Okay, we can do that.” He pauses and asks, “You think you could give us a hand?”
The flash of hesitation in Sam’s eyes comes as a surprise blow to him. He gets the hollow feeling they might not saddle up and ride towards the distant sunset just yet.
It takes them two whole weeks to reach the vestiges of the forgotten Civil War fort Bobby had told them about. At first sight, its decrepit state, from patchy masonry to rotting timber structures, both fighting a losing battle with wild weeds and weirdly-textured moss, raises several questions. How much combat has this thing withstood? And how is any part of it still standing?
Dean swallowed. He steeled himself up for what he was about to say. “But it’s Cas, man. He’s our best friend. He’s family. Maybe... maybe even more than that.” His breath caught in his throat. “If I screw this up...
He releases the breath he’s been holding. Within his palm is the small rock, now warm to his touch, which he squeezes one last time before letting it drop in a light
Cas comes closer to him and lays a warm hand on his arm. Water is still dripping from his hair, pearling at the tips and landing softly on his cheeks before rolling down. “You did a good thing saving these people. I’m sure they must all be very thankful for your actions.” His hand slides off as he turns to Sam. “And yours too, Sam.”
Something warm and happy bloomed inside Castiel; no matter how many times he heard Dean call him ‘angel’, or ‘my angel’, or ‘sweetheart’, the words never ceased to fill him with delight.
A newfound silence settles between them. Dean keeps his eyes cast downwards, where his worn-out boots reveal their tears in the firelight. It probably wouldn’t hurt to invest in some new ones next time they cross civilization. Make Sam get some too. And Cas. He can’t tell whether the leather on his feet was once black, or if it’s always been this tawny shade of maroon.
Remembering why they’re out here in the first place, Dean rolls his shoulders back and slaps his hands exaggeratedly on his worn-out jeans.
Dean licks at his lips. He’s liking this docile Cas way more than he should. But hey, he doesn’t get to have fun every day, so might as well enjoy it when he can.
Breathing harshly, Dean looks down at the fabric of his shirt clenched between Cas’s fist. Another hand is hot below his shoulder, keeping him solidly balanced while he finishes catching his breath. There’s sweat pearling at his brows and behind his ears. Getting old sucks.
“I think he likes being outdoors.” He looked at Sam and continued. “And as Sam said, he doesn’t know anything of the world around him. He’s never seen the million-year-old cliffs of the Grand Canyon. Of course, he won’t get the chance to observe its birth from the carving of the rushing waters, as I had the chance to, but I think he may still find it beautiful.” He paused. “But we could go to Disney as well if if that’s where you’d like to go,” he added more slowly, his eyes setting on Dean.
“— I know, Cas.” Dean drew out a sigh, frustration etched in the tautness of his shoulders. “I know, okay? He’ll come when it’s time for him to come. And it’s not like I don’t want him to take his time down there. He — he deserves to enjoy it. No one knows that better than I do. But knowing that doesn’t make it easier to...”
He barely makes it a few meters away before he turns back to them. “Hey, Dean, you should bring Lucy with you. To make the night a little shorter,” he calls out.
So the church is... well it’s Dean’s meagre attempt to say thank you without having his lips do the work. Even though neither of them will get a lot of use out of it- they both have big plans after all, don’t they- Dean hopes Cas will like the gesture.
Rubbing a hand over his stubble, he takes a roaming glance around, eyes unfocused yet searching, until he catches sight of Cas, whose own gaze is fixed unperturbedly on Dean.
Cas takes a step towards Dean, almost unconsciously.  His brain has almost turned off, all he can see is Dean, he isn’t even thinking about what he’s saying.
When the credits roll, they don’t get up immediately, instead lounging in their seats as everyone else leaves, Cas kissing some of the leftover popcorn butter off the side of Dean’s mouth, tongue running over his lip ring.
“It’s not so much me,” he lets the words fall out of his mouth, uninhibited here as they were so often on Earth, “It’s more Sam.  I still worry, even though I know he’ll get here eventually.”
“Why can’t I stay here?” Dean argues, not wanting to be taken anywhere away from windows or doors.  Like where lights were red and there was a bed where very bad things could happen.
Sam turns a little red when he sees Cas, and Dean knows he’s going to get a lecture about “boundaries” and “being too loud” when Cas, Charlie, and Eileen leave.
“You aren’t crazy,” Pamela says, an edge of tiredness to her voice, “it’s normal to go on dates with people.”
“You’ve been acting weird about Cas for months, and I thought that maybe, just maybe, you had finally gotten off your ass and done something about how you feel about him.  And then I hear that you got into a fight and you aren’t even talking?  What the fuck Dean?  Like you can ruin your own life I guess, I think it’s stupid but whatever, but what about me?  Like now Cas won’t even be a part of my life.  And that sucks!  He hasn’t even met Jess yet!”
“That’s true,” Charlie says, setting up her station and running the usual disinfecting routine.  Dean knew she had an appointment at 10 this morning, or he would’ve definitely gotten a text along the lines of
Dean wakes up gasping again, and this time, he remembers the dream, and it takes him until pale, minty light is creeping through his windows to fall asleep again, the screaming, keening cries of the monster still echoing in his ears.
“This was different though, like this is his actual career and I didn’t want to, you know, ruin it.”
They stay up too late watching random episodes that Cas picks, occasionally pausing so he can write something down, send an email, or otherwise panic about some tiny detail of the gallery that Dean has to talk him down from.  He really believed that it would be a success, Charlie had been telling every single person in her “Be Gay, Do Crimes” Facebook group that it was happening, they had all banded together to do some serious poster designing, and had put it up in the shop, at Sam’s office, at all their favorite bars.  They were going to make it a success if it killed them, and Cas was so fucking talented and good at these things that Dean wasn’t sure he needed their help, though he was always glad to give it.
As Cas crawls his way up to kiss Dean, he leans into it, more than ready to proceed with the rest of the night, but Cas isn’t done yet.
Dean’s face split into a radiant smile, the kind of smile that made Cas feel like he was standing in the sun on a spring day.
Their aside over, they make their way back to Cas and Bobby. Dean can feel eyes on their back, their group probably wondering about the hold-up and the water-emerging, pantless stranger talking to Bobby.
Castiel shook his head imperceptibly, not wishing to disturb Dean’s position. “It’s okay. I’m putting the blame on
Dean sighs painfully, cringing at his own words before they even come out. “You know we can’t, Sam. That’s not how we do things.”
In this still clearing, merely occupied by a rider, his loyal horse and wiry threads of dry grass, Dean feels like he can finally breathe freely again.
Cas lowered his eyes, frowning slightly, as he appeared to be forming his own opinion on the matter. His beach attire was a definite departure from his usual sober suit and tie. With surprisingly little coaxing, Dean had convinced him to grab a unique pair of pink and white swim trunks from one of the many swimsuits on display in the oversized store and had ushered him into a fitting room by placing a guiding hand on his shoulder blade. The image of Cas in boxers adorned with a shameless pattern of kissing flamingos, each pair creating the vague shape of an anatomically incorrect heart, had been too good to pass up.
“Yeah I just…I haven’t talked to anyone about it.  Only been here for a month or so,” he takes a breath, steadying himself, and then plunges on, “Dad kicked me out.  Found me with this guy.  We travel a lot so I’m used to getting around when I need to.  Hitchhiked my way up here, stole some money from my dad so I had a little to get by one.  Shoulda picked anywhere but Chicago, it’s so fucking cold here.  I was staying in this shelter and they kicked me out because I was too old or something.  So I got desperate, cold, don’t have the winter gear for this place.  And I met this guy outside of a bar and he said he knew a way I could earn money.  And I took him up on it.”
Dean called a meeting with them all that evening, and Cas walked into the armory, seeing past Dean in the corner was like seeing a ghost, but he settled at his usual spot at the head of the table, putting his boots up on the worn wood as his Dean paced up and down, the Colt sitting in the middle of the table.
“Well, so nice to finally meet you, Dean.  Come find me if you want to start having an actual good time.”
His brain can’t connect what’s happening, because he knows that voice, even in the darkness, he would always know that voice.
“Of course,” Cas has this big goofy grin on his face and Dean doesn’t ever want to let him go.  He does not know how Cas has stuck around this long, or why he hasn’t managed to scare him off yet, but sitting there on the wooden floor of his and Sam’s apartment, he tries just to revel in the gratefulness that he hasn’t chased him away yet.
It’s hard for Dean, especially at first, to talk about Chicago with anyone.  He had told Sam first, well, besides Lee of course, right after John had died, he had told him about nearly starving, about doing what he needed to just to survive.  Sam, the incredible soul that he was, had never judged Dean for it, even though Dean judged everything about it for himself.  He had hated that part of himself for so damn long, for going to bed with people for money, for selling a part of himself that he never thought would be necessary, but when John had thrown him out he had been left with few options, barely old enough to get a job without parent’s permission.
“I definitely don’t but you do, and I was saving asking about hot girls for a second since that’s the type we’re both into.”
It’s a testament to the power of Dean and Cas’ friendship that Charlie doesn’t bat an eye at this, doesn’t ask any questions, simply nods and goes back to her book, asking if Dean is going to make dinner.
He doesn’t hear from Cas all day besides a text to their group chat letting them all know he’d be in New Haven for the rest of the weekend.  It sorta relieves an unknown pressure.  Not that he doesn’t want to see Cas, he always wanted to hang out with Cas, but him ditching Dean at the bar still sorta rubbed him the wrong way, and he didn’t want to spend his weekend pretending not to be pissy about it to keep the peace.
They continue the process as Dean fixes Cas’ tie, makes him a to-go cup of coffee, picks up his fallen keys, and gets his coat from the coat closet.  Cas looks decidedly less frantic as Dean hands him the coffee and helps him into his coat, breathing more regular and eyes less terrified than before.
A few days after the art gallery opening, Sam gets called in for another interview.  He’s so nervous that Dean thinks he’s going to tear his hair out as he stands in the shop, looking in the mirrors and smoothing it down, trying to straighten his tie and making it even more crooked than usual.  Benny and Pamela, the mom and dad of the place, converge on him, Pamela uses a comb she whips out of her bag to smooth his hair, and Benny fixes his tie.  Sam’s talking a mile a minute, almost too fast to understand,
“Yeah but, I’ve never had a Christmas like this, with a real tree in a real home or whatever.  And I’m glad that I’m, uh, here with you.”
“What happened to you?” Charlie inquires, eyes wide as she stares at Dean.  He doesn’t say anything as he marches to the freezer to get an icepack.  She follows his path and stands directly in front of him, not moving.
“Balthazar,” v-neck man leans over and places kisses on Dean’s cheeks, and he feels himself turning red because, even though Cas had told him, once upon a time, that Balthazar had spent a lot of time in Europe, but it doesn’t help calm Dean down.  Why is Cas leaving him on his own in this?  Why is he just over there making eyes at some dude when Dean is drowning meeting his family for the first time?  What the fuck is he doing here?
The second the words leave his lips, Dean suddenly feels thirty pounds lighter.  He’s never said those words aloud, only mouthed them to himself in the mirror.  He thought everyone was making it up when they said that coming out felt like a lifted weight, but it actually, really does.
Cas glares down at the screen and then, before any of them can make a move to stop him, he slides his thumb to accept the call.
They break apart when the clock chimes, signalling the beginning of Christmas Day, and Dean gives him a radiant smile, one that warms Cas up from toes to fingertips.
“Six years Dean.  Six years.  That’s how long we’ve been together.  And I want that to continue, I want a future with you, I want kids with you, I want to marry you.  But I do not want any of those things if he’s a part of your life.”
He was in the Impala, looking for Croats with Dean.  They were parked, waiting to ambush any group that passed, when Cas felt his eyes getting heavy.  His body felt like lead and he couldn’t move properly.
“Hey Sam, are you part vacuum cleaner?” Charlie asks as he gets his second plate, right as she’s sitting down with her own.
He takes a breath, and sinks into the memories that he had tried, for the better part of ten years, to forget.
Dean scoffs and rolls his eyes, scrolling through Instagram again, only putting it away when he notices that Cas is leaning on his elbow, staring at him.
“Can’t do this?” Dean sinks down to Cas’ level on the couch and Benny sits on Cas’ other side, “Of course you can, man.  This is what y’all have been waiting for.  You’re gonna do so great, Cas.  Just breathe.  I’ll be right in the front.”
Dean’s eyes snap to Bobby, who’s looking at him a little too knowingly.  Had he always been so obvious?  Probably so.
Dean wakes up to his alarm and the smell of eggs and bacon coming from the kitchen.  He sniffs the air like a hungry dog and pads out to the living room to find Sam fully dressed and ready for school, with Cas at the stove, making omelets with green onions and enough cheese to keep a dairy in business for the next decade, which were Dean’s favorites.
Cas turns on Dean’s favorite sitcom, one that Cas himself hates and derides as being infantile, but they laugh along to it anyway, staying up far later than they should, especially since Dean has work in the morning and it’s not the type of job you want to slack at anyway.  He never asks Cas to leave, they’ve shared a bed way more often than Dean’s shared a bed with anyone else, so falling asleep next to him was easy.  Cas’s light breathing, the way his head was thrown back on the pillow, the canned laughter from the TV in Dean’s room, Dean’s arm snaked around Cas’ chest, it was the perfect way to end a shitty evening.
“You’re mouthy, more teeth than I expected,” Dean manages, still needing to sass Cas despite the fact that Cas has the power in the situation.  And, of course, Cas stops the friction immediately.
“I was thinking on my ribs, left side,” he’s studying Dean the way he used to, his eyes looking right through him like he used to, Dean’s going crazy.
The garage he parks the Impala in is close to his and Sam’s apartment, which is a blessing, since Cas is getting handsy again the second they hit the sidewalk, and it takes all of Dean’s willpower not to drag him into an alley in the middle of the day.
Dean nods, trying his best to look like all of this was cool and fine which it definitely wasn’t and Cas turning away is definitely making it worse, so Dean, reacting on impulse, catches Cas’ arm, his hand touching the warm, tanned skin.
perfect.  And I just get a little, you know, suspicious.  I’ve never had a first date that good, there wasn’t even any awkward silence.”
“Well first and foremost I don’t want to pressure you into anything.  That’s my number one thing, I wouldn’t want you to ever be uncomfor-”
Cas rolls his eyes and get to work with the eggs, letting Dean sort out the bacon, which is just fine by him, since he’s a bacon snob and everything has to be just right, especially with this breakfast.
As they’re waiting in line for their extra large pepperoni, because you can’t go wrong with the classics, Dean looks at Sam.  Not at all the little kid he had put to bed so many nights, and not the gangly teenager he had taught to drive a car, not even the floppy and awkward college grad who went into law school with more naivete than Dean had had in his whole life.  Sam, with his hair slicked back and his well-fitting suit that hid the littering of tattoos on his arms, looked like an actual law school graduate, like the kinda guy you would want sitting next to you when you did something wrong.  Damn, he was so proud of Sam, so fucking proud of the man he had grown into.
Dean had told him once about a dream that he had had, after hell, where he had been running from demons, Allistair, driving through winding roads in his car, and he kept seeing fireworks in the sky, seeing Sam, seeing Cas.  Cas asked if it was a nightmare, and Dean couldn’t really answer him, couldn’t really explain what kind of dream it was.  That was what Cas wanted: the good and the in between.
“Another time,” he whispers, standing taller as they approach the front door.  It opens before they can get to him, and Dean is suddenly whisked inside by Gabriel, who he recognizes from the photos that Cas had showed him.  He’s shorter than either Dean or Cas and has this glint in his eye that tells Dean he’s going to be an easy target to get made fun of the whole night.
Their dates can be as simple as a five minute lunch break when Dean comes up for air at the shop, Cas rubbing his tried, cramped, ink-stained hands, to as romantic as meeting at the empty gallery that Cas still has a key to, dancing to folk songs in the softly lit open area, holding onto each other with a gentleness that Dean has never known.
“It probably means they’ll be in touch,” Dean grins a little as Sam rolls his eyes, leg still bouncing incessantly, heel of his polished shoe clacking loudly on the linoleum floor.
“What?  No,” Dean’s eyes start darting around the room, no one knows about this, apart from the strangers that he spent the darkest hours of the night with.  Money was a bitch, and those that are desperate for it will do anything to get it, dignity be damned.
Cas counts the scales on the snake wrapping around his right ankle, up towards his knee, and kisses his mother’s signature on his left foot.  He even manages to suppress a noise of surprise at the full Adam West Batman figure Charlie did on his left leg, looking just as dorky and badass as he had always dreamed.
Cas had just broken up with Hannah, the only girl that had kept his attention for longer than a night.  He was sad, fucked up really, and had broached the subject in a slurred voice.  Running a hand through his neon yellow hair, which was dirty, unkept, still a little sweaty from the shitty club they had been in that night.  Charlie and Benny had long gone home, Ellen was watching Sam that night, he and Cas had Cas’ shitty dorm to themselves and were sprawled on the floor, unable to do anything, limbs heavy with the alcohol and the weed and the weight of the night.
Cas smiles, turns away, and Dean’s brain is screaming to call him back, to say that’s not what he wanted to tell him, but Dean’s gotten very very good at hiding that part of himself away, what’s a few more decades?
Nothing, just that same weird noise.  Dean pulled his pistol from its holster on his hip and looked at Cas.  Cas nodded.  Dean opened the door to Bobby’s room and out came fully infected with Croatoan Bobby, wheelchair and all.  Neither of them realized what was happening for several seconds.  Bobby was rabid, the virus had completely taken over, Bobby was rabid, unrecognizable.  Bobby came towards Cas and all Cas could do was back up into the front hallway.  What the hell was he supposed to do?  Shoot Bobby?
reason, but I was having these dreams about it.  About like being caught in the middle of it, and I would see you in the dreams and you were so much better than me, higher up on the totem pole, and I, well, sorta convinced myself that I wasn’t good enough for you.  And I never really explained that, because, you know, when I showed up at your door, I didn’t think that that was something to really say, especially since we hadn’t seen each other in so long and I know it doesn’t make any sense and that we’re trying to move past it and everything but I wanted to tell you how fucking stupid I am so we can maybe move past it and look at that stupid goddamn painting and laugh and…yeah.”
“Yeah, I didn’t think so.  So maybe just accept that sometimes things are good and this nice, cool guy likes you and just ignore the rampant division of classes that we all have to live our lives in most of the time?”
Dean draws up short.  The offhand way Cas mentions it is something that only someone with experience does, the type of person that’s lived with the problem for years, decades, so that’s nonchalant, something that just is.
Dean thinks about lying, sometimes he remembers too many details and has to white lie and pretend that he doesn’t, it freaks some people out.  He decides against it, it is Cas that he’s talking to, after all.
“Oh, so you won’t be wearing the lingerie bunny corset costume I got you?” Pamela smirks, and all three of them start laughing.
“Wow, Dean Winchester.  One-night stand king.  Looks to me like this guy might get another round with you.”
“I know, and I’m grateful for all of you.  This has just been very stressful and I’m ready for it to be over so I can stop worrying about whether anyone will show up.”
Dean half smiles.  He decides to tell the truth, well, tell the truth in a way that won’t make the rest of the date awkward, they way that people do when their lives are going to shit and they say they’re just fine.
They fall asleep easily, mirroring each other’s breath, and Dean swears that it’s some of the best sleep he’s had in years.
Dean holds out his hand, which Cas takes without hesitation.  It’s weird Dean is still getting used to this, he’s still getting used to the idea that this is something that he’s allowed, that it’s okay to hold Cas’ hand when he wants to.  That hold Cas’ hand, touching Cas this way isn’t going to make him explode or spontaneously combust.
“He does like to go all out,” Cas sighs as Dean parks the car, careful to stay about ten feet away from the classic Aston Martin in front of him.
“Something funny?” Dean couldn’t not sass Cas, it’s something that, if he stopped doing, assume that he’d been kidnapped and that his lack of sass was a cry for help okay?  But it was hard to sass someone when they had you in the palm of their hand.  Literally.
