Sam’s lips try and form a smile, but he knows they fall remarkably short. “I don’t know. Time in these places… It moves differently. It might be hours. It might be days.”
Still, there should be enough left to save Dean Winchester one last time. There has to be.
It doesn’t take him long to find Amy, the girl putting up missing posters on any available surface. On a hunch, he invites her and a friend out to eat. It turns out to be a good call. The friend, Rachel, says people have been talking about how the disappearances might be connected to a local legend: a girl who was killed on Centennial Highway decades ago and now haunts the place.
Dean could swear Sam looks nervous at that. More than ever, he’s convinced that he’s out of the loop on something. So he does what he always does when he feels off balance: he doubles down on anger. “Yeah, you know what? I’m not about to give up looking for Dad.”
“C’mon, man.” Dean’s tone is airy and teasing, in the specific way that Sam knows masks real concern. “Of the two of us,
“Ellen, you can’t possibly think that
As soon as the first beams of morning sunlight stream through Baby’s windows, he gets back on the road. He’d already researched hospitals in the area, and the only one within a thirty-mile radius of Jericho is his first stop.
Castiel doesn’t fight against Dean’s gentle guidance as he leads them through the dining room to the living room. Dean takes a seat on the couch, but he doesn’t offer a seat to Castiel. Taking the unspoken instruction, Castiel remains standing. He shifts his weight from side to side, but this time, Dean does nothing to alleviate his discomfort. This is where he’ll start peeling back the layers of Castiel Novak.
It takes a supreme effort not to take hold of Ruby and shake her. Castiel manages it, just barely. “Do you know how to get to him?” he grits out.
Cas groans into Dean’s ear, low and throaty, before biting at Dean’s jaw. He’s a dervish, and Dean couldn’t stop him if he tried. Cas’ hands tug at Dean’s shirt, pulling it over his head in a series of quick, almost brutal movements. It falls to the floor, forgotten, and then Cas’ hands are on his skin. They slide from his waist, up to his stomach, and then to his chest. He thumbs over Dean’s nipples, smiling against his throat at Dean’s sharp gasp.
Max nods. “Missouri and I have been talking on the phone. She helped me a lot with… coming to terms with things. I told her there was going to be a battle, and she agreed to help.”
“For fuck’s sake, Dad, we’re your
The woman smirks at them with the resignation of someone who got precisely the reaction they expected. “Yeah. Exactly.”

“Do you—”
Dean’s brain, having been offline for several seconds, suddenly returns and kicks into overdrive. While he might not have answers to his questions, he can use this coincidence for everything that it’s worth. He raises his hand, suddenly enthusiastic, and feels a stab of vindictive pleasure at the sudden fearful glint in Castiel’s eyes. It gets better when he raises his voice to call across the room.
“Right.” Bobby sips at his beer. “Sacrifices. I guess you’d know something about that.”
The fluttery warmth turns white-hot. “Were you planning on staying here?” Dean asks, indicating the uncomfortable plastic chairs with a jerk of his head.
“I want…” Castiel keens. “Oh God, I want to feel your hand on my throat. I want you to fuck my face until I cry. I want you to spank my ass red, I want…”
, don’t do this.”
“Well, I’ve got to say, you’re fresh out of luck, bitch. I don’t want any part of you, and I never will.”
“I wouldn’t know. Never really thought about kids before,” Jess says, ignoring the small twinge in her chest that the lie causes her.
Castiel debates not serving Bobby, but eventually he slides a bottle of beer across the bar towards him. He does make sure that it’s the cheapest brand they sell. Bobby’s frown tells him that his pettiness hasn’t gone unnoticed, but he doesn’t say anything about it.
Dean freezes.
The confrontation with Uriel and Nichols burned away more than his apathy. It also washed away the cobwebs in the corners of his mind, finally allowing him to see matters clearly. He’s been an idiot in the past weeks, too wrapped up in his own pain and hurt to see the truth.
Thank you so much for your interest and kind words. Now I just have to hope that I live up to them. Enjoy and, as always, wash your hands you filthy animals.
He needs to get out of here. He needs to get Cas and get the hell out of here before one or both of them gets hurt beyond the point of no return. Now the only problem becomes finding Cas.
of you cool it.”
“Okay,” Ellen says easily. “But while you’re here, help me with this, would you?”
some time. Better get him really fucking drunk first though.”
In an attempt to concentrate on anything else, Dean’s eyes flick to the corner. He pauses as he catches sight of Cas’ bag, still obviously full, propped up neatly against the wall. When he looks at the coffee table, all of Cas’ books are still spread out across the surface. His heart stops for a second before resuming its normal rhythms. Cas wouldn’t have left those things behind, which means he’s not gone. Cas is still somewhere in the resort.
hadn’t gotten all my other clothes filthy.” Ava’s tone is sharp, though her eyes are anything but as she looks fondly at Jo. “How many times a day do you need to spar? And be honest.”
Cas stands. He looks stiff and unnatural; his face a marble mask. He stares over Dean’s shoulder, to a place Dean can never hope to follow. “I think this is it,” Cas finally says, swallowing in the way that precludes vomiting.
“I love you so much, Cas.”
“Well, that’s alright,” Dad said, drawling out the words a little. Dean blinked in disbelief. “I’m proud of you for getting it from Elkins. I know it wasn’t easy to track down.” A kind smile lit up Dad’s face. “This friend of yours, where’d you say he’s taking it?”
“Five-thirty,” Dean says, pretty sure he’s interpreting the question correctly.
Also, we start earning our rating this chapter, as you're about to see...
“Hello, Sam,” Castiel croaks.
Cas reaches for the lube, only to have his hand slapped away by Dean. That eyebrow rises again, a gesture which never fails to heat Dean’s blood. “You watch,” is all Dean offers by way of explanation, before he rises up on his knees. He tips the lube into one hand, slicking his fingers.
A smile twitches at Cas’ mouth. “Hello, Dean.”
It was almost like she and Sam were back at Stanford, albeit with guns instead of study groups.
Max blinks at Cas in confusion. A large bruise stretches over one side of his face, his left eye almost swollen shut. The other eye is reddened with the tears streaming down both his cheeks. “What—” Max stammers. “What do you— why are you here?”
“Dean, what the hell are you doing? Dean,
After another minute of contented silence, Sam says, “So if you’re working at the garage full-time, that won’t leave much time to pick up hunts.”
she can do.
“His address is local,” Cas says, already halfway to the door. “Let’s go.”
“I wasn’t doing anything,” Dean says, offended and more than a little confused.
Castiel realizes he’s still holding a gun and an open flask of holy water. As there seems to be no obvious threat at the moment, he tucks them both away, as furtively as he can in full view of three other people. “I, um,” he tries, cursing himself for not preparing a cover story in advance. “I was just passing by, and I saw someone climb in through the window. I—”
Castiel feels a crushing, paralyzing pain in his chest, and the force of it knocks him to his knees. Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Dean and Ruby collapse as well.
Castiel perches on the edge of the office chair, adjusting its height slightly upwards to keep from having to fold his legs at an awkward angle. As Jess takes a seat in the armchair, Castiel looks around, noticing posters of constellations, building sets of space shuttles and even a large telescope next to one of the windows. “You’re interested in space exploration,” he says, smiling at Max in what he hopes is a reassuring way.
Dean scoffs lightly. “I’m not a narc.”

“Hold on,” Dean says, overwhelmed in the face of the hostess’ unrelenting smile and cheerfulness. “I think there’s been a mistake. I just need to ask a few questions--”

, his sluggish mind realizes), before the man grunts and the weapon skitters across the floor.
Castiel nods, but Dean doesn’t seem to notice. “I can’t believe you didn’t…” He runs the hand which isn’t still wrapped up in Castiel’s coat over his face. “You idiot,” he finally breathes. “A couple of dumbasses. You’ve had me, Cas. All along, you’ve had me.”
That doesn’t mean he’s going to stay that way.

“Make sure that he doesn’t do anything to hurt himself,” Jess tells Sam. Dean doesn’t miss the smile she directs his way. He sure as hell doesn’t miss how her fingers ghost over Sam’s shoulder before he leaves the room.
“You still got the note?” Ellen asks, an edge of anxiety to her voice.
He’ll never erase the horror of that one night, the blood and gore and death, but when he thinks of
Jess gives up trying to improve anyone’s mood after that. Cas is a lost cause anyway. He hasn’t spoken since he hung up the phone with Ash, who promised to keep an eye out for sightings of the Continental, or for reports of strange bank robberies.
“You’ve got a chance to do better too, you know,” he tells Ruby, and her head snaps back to face him. She clearly wasn’t expecting him to say anything else. “Rowena’s pretty formidable, but she’s fair. If you play by her rules, she’ll treat you well.”
Luke Nichols is in his building. Luke Nichols, who attempted to assault him in a bathroom, who views his entire designation as second-class citizens. Luke Nichols wants to take over the company that Castiel’s put his heart and soul into. And he’s in the building, in the office of someone who Castiel should be able to trust.
Brady’s eyes flick from black to their normal, slightly washed-out blue. “Remind me, hunter.” He spits out the word like a foul bit of half-digested food. “Who are you, and why am I answering your questions?”
“No, I’ll be fine,” Castiel says, pushing his knuckles into his temples. Hannah is too sophisticated to scoff, but they still give the impression of doing so. Castiel looks up, a wry expression on his face. “If I eat anything now, I’ll just throw it up. I’ll get something to eat when I go home. Promise.”
Speaking of Bobby, he’s gone from his chair on the porch.
here that relates to Azazel.”
Cas claims it’s because Dean is so exhausted from working at the garage, but Dean knows better: he can finally sleep because he has a place to call his own, and someone he loves to share it with. The apartment may not look like much to an outsider — just a one-bedroom walkup in Lincoln that often smells like the fried rice being dished up at the Chinese place downstairs — but it’s home.
The woman makes a sound that Castiel thinks is meant to be a laugh, but there’s absolutely no joy in it. “Fuck. I’d kill for something like that.” She strips off her gloves, holding up her fingers and wiggling them. “If I touch someone, their heart stops.”
“Are you coming or what? It’s freaking rank down here!”
“Alright,” Jess says. “Dean, we’ll go with you to check out the coordinates, as long as you agree to come along to Nebraska after. You should stick around at least until we can figure out how this is all connected, and what we should be doing next.” She slants her eyes at Sam, who’s staring determinedly at the table. “I know Sam wants you to, even if he’s too proud to say so.”
It takes everything Dean’s got not to flinch at that. “I’m not taking Cas,” he says coolly, meeting Jess’ eyes to let her know he means it. “And before you ask, no, I don’t wanna talk about it.”
There’s no mistaking what they’re doing. Falling asleep on the couch, sure, no one can really control where their body lands once gravity and slumber take over, but dancing? Dancing is inherently romantic, hands clasped together, faces turned towards each other, bodies moving to the same rhythm. Dean feels his pulse in his fingertips where they press gently against Cas. Cas slowly turns and just like that, they’re dancing.
It takes a long moment for his pupils to contract. During that time, Dean whines unhappily. He tries to raise his hand to block the light, but his arm is ridiculously heavy, like there are weights attached to his wrists.
His vision. Meg. The warehouse. The trap.
It begins when Dean is pathetically trying to impress his crush.
There’s so much that he wants to do--his mouth waters with the need to wrap around Cas’ cock and take him down all the way to the root just to hear the sweet little sounds that he knows Cas would make. He wants to spread Cas’ thighs apart and lick him open, not stop until Cas is dripping and trembling and loose enough that he can just slide right in--But those are things to be done amongst lovers, not...whatever the hell they are.
He clamps his mouth shut to stop himself from saying anything that would make him look like an even bigger idiot, but Cas doesn’t seem inclined to make fun of him. Actually, Cas looks like he wants to kiss Dean, and Dean kind of wishes he would.
Castiel reads and re-reads the message, wondering what his next move should be. If there’s anything he’s learned about Dean, it’s that it won’t do any good to push him to talk when he isn’t ready to. That’s something Castiel can relate to. He has plenty of trauma to spare, but he’s never felt the need to share it with anyone outside the Harvelle family. At least not until a few days ago, as he watched the sun set by a small pond in Colorado.
is speaking, and he listens.
Exhaustion and grief pull at him in equal measure, urging him to rest, to close his eyes for just a minute. But he can’t sleep now. He needs to plan, consider next steps...
Sam flinches as if struck, and a fault line opens in Jess’ chest.
Jess sits beside Sam in the annex’s small kitchen, watching him try to force food down his throat. Sam nibbles at his Cheerios, which are getting soggier and soggier with every passing second. He’s full of nervous, jittery energy, jiggling his leg up and down and drumming on the table with his fingers. He hasn’t sat still all morning, and Jess knows that his inability to do anything must be driving him insane.
Two of them are the couple that lives here. Castiel recognizes them from the pictures in his case file. The man is tall and in his early twenties, with dark brown hair, wearing a faded gray t-shirt and pajama pants. The woman is a statuesque blonde, long hair curling past her shoulders and onto a Smurfs t-shirt that exposes a toned midriff. Castiel’s eyes slide to the third occupant of the room, whose own gaze snags briefly on the woman’s striking physique before he turns to glower at Castiel. This second man is in his mid-twenties, at a guess, dark blond and dressed not unlike Castiel himself: in a canvas jacket, sturdy jeans and Army surplus boots.
There’s a difficult moment where Dean has to unlock the cabin door while supporting Cas, but he gets both him and Cas into the cabin without hurting anyone. After the trek to the cabin, putting Cas to bed is child’s play. He groans slightly as Dean arranges him against the pillows, but he doesn’t wake.
Something has been bothering Castiel about that fight, and he thinks he knows what it is now. Dean
Sam’s a fucking idiot.
Jess pointed out to him last night that, with Stanford ready to take them back and the Roadhouse on the cusp of reopening, they’ve run out of reasons to put off their goodbyes. She’s right, of course, but that doesn’t make this any easier. Because going back to Stanford means leaving Dean behind again, and breaking that particular news… well, it won’t be easy.
Dean comes face to face with a sweaty, satisfied A.D.A., who’s examining his gun and the target with a little too much interest. “I’m done,” Castiel says, flicking his eyes back to Dean’s face.
“Yeah, Cas?”
She flicks her fingers, and Castiel hears the sick, hollow sound of a head striking metal. Behind him, Sam’s body slumps.
“Hey,” Jess says, gently taking the mug and spoon from Ava's slack hands. She quickly fills up the mug the rest of the way and stirs in some more sugar, then offers the mug to Ava. Ava takes it but doesn’t make any attempt to drink it.
Black spots dance across his vision, and there’s a shrill ringing in his ears. He doesn’t know who moves first, whether it’s Cas or whether it’s him, but it doesn’t matter. All that matters are Cas’ hands on his face, Cas’ elbows knocking into his side, and then Cas’ mouth on his.
“Well, you’re after the wrong guy,” Jess says, half-hoping that speaking the words will make them true. “Sam doesn’t have any powers.”
He forces his thoughts off that unproductive subject, and back onto Jess’ story about the Colt. Ellen looks doubtful, and judging by their expressions, Dean, Sam and Pamela aren’t convinced either.  But there’s something about what Jess told them that has set a wheel turning in the back of Castiel’s head — an almost-forgotten memory clicking back into place.
Before he leaves, Dean looks around the stacks. If there’s any secret to be told, they keep it remarkably well.
Jess’ question draws Dean’s eyes to the rearview mirror. Jess is by herself in Baby’s back seat, eyes hard and fixed on the back of Sam’s head. Sam’s posture stiffens. “What do you mean?” he asks, his tone a painfully fake attempt at casual.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean says, clearly not buying it. He takes Sam’s elbow and yanks him into the narrow hallway, just out of sight of Castiel and Jess. “Look, I don’t know who your new buddy is, and I’m not going to stick around to find out. We need to look for Dad. I mean, for all we know, he’s got a bead on the thing that killed Mom.”
“Just don’t tell Sam, alright?” Dean says, shifting on the couch. He pokes and prods Castiel until he’s happy with how he’s positioned. Castiel lifts his arm so that Dean can snuggle up to him and lay his head in his lap. His fingers card through Dean’s hair, and Dean hums happily. “At least not till I’m enrolled. Then he can gush all he wants to.”
“Okay.” Jess nods thoughtfully. “That makes sense to me. And Blackwater Ridge can’t be more than an hour or two out of our way, right, Cas?”
awake, I was thinking we’d get the day off to a good start.”
The nun nods her acknowledgement. “Fine. Fetch it, and follow me.”
“Yes, but you also need to be alive to make that happen,” Hannah cautions. She lays a gentle hand on Novak’s arm. “You’re more important than any case.”
Sam’s mouth twists in a frown which has the potential to become bitchy. “I don’t know how merry we are, but sure. Why not?”
“I’m so sorry,” he says, using Dean’s voice.
Dean’s already won, and they both know it, but Cas is nothing if not a stubborn dick, so he narrows his eyes and says, “Anything else?”
Max shuts his eyes tighter, hands clenched into fists at his sides. He stops shaking his head and then, with a clear effort, opens his eyes. Castiel’s breath hitches at the devastation he sees there. “Please leave,” Max says, more loudly than he’s spoken since his father entered the house.
“Annex kitchen.”
“Guess they missed me,” Cas says quietly, his head lolling back against the seat, eyes glazed with exhaustion.
“You’re the one who’s not wanted,” Dean says, thanking whatever fucked-up force is in charge of the universe that his voice doesn’t shake. “Get out.”
However, the lapse is momentary. Castiel’s serene smile returns, plastered over his face with gritty determination. “I couldn’t tell you what potential partners think of me or my job,” he answers. “I could say that any partner who would be off-put by my job isn’t my ideal match.”
Sam’s corresponding grunt to the taunt over his hair sounds a little less worried and a little more irritated, which is what Dean was aiming for. “Yeah, you’re hilarious. Call me when you get there, all right?”
“You complete, fucking—” he says, but he never has a chance to complete the insult.
“You haven’t been my friend for a long time, have you?” Sam says, outwardly calm, but with a low undercurrent of anger that Jess has only heard a handful of times (mostly in conversations about Sam’s father).
The words are vicious and meant to hurt. Jess and Cas round the corner into the kitchen at the same time, taking in the scene. Alice is by the door, sobbing, both hands help up in front of her — to stop Max or shield herself, or perhaps both. She’s wearing a thick winter coat, having clearly just returned to the house.
“You want to train Sam and the others to kill demons?” Dean asks, incredulous, but Pamela nods. She opens her mouth to say something else, but Sam beats her to the punch.
Dean’s mouth opens, perhaps catching on another fruitless plea (it’s too late, but it was always too late, it was too late for Castiel ever since the moment he first wrapped Dean in his grace and pulled him from Hell), but he’s stopped by a hissing, gurgling, bubbling sound. It’s the sound of nothingness, where there should be something. It’s the sound of a hole opening in the universe.
“I thought we’d gotten past the part where you hated me,” Dean says. His hand lands on Castiel’s knee and slides up his thigh. His thumb flirts with the seam of Castiel's jeans. "Antiques. Seriously. Why would you wanna torture me like that?"
try to negotiate with her. I’ll be alright.”
Though Mary’s mouth never moves, Castiel hears the words clearly in his head.
“We’re on a tight schedule here, you know,” Cas says, pretending to be annoyed, but his gaze seems stuck on where Dean’s fingers are slowly working away at his buttons.
he needs a drink.
“I want…” Castiel groans as his forehead drops to Dean’s shoulder. “Please, sir, I need…”
Dean, who was possibly planning on doing exactly that, feels attacked. “I’m there to do a fucking job, don’t be stupid, Sam,” he grumbles. “But you know, I’ve got to fit in while I’m investigating. Who’s to say what happens?”
“Get the fuck out of the van.” Castiel spits the command out through gritted teeth. Despite his warning to Jess, his finger rests on the trigger guard. Somehow, he can’t bear to bring himself to shoot someone who’s not actively threatening him. It doesn’t mean that he’s going to relax around Andy, however.
“Hello, Clarence.”
Dean squirms uncomfortably. It’s starting to look like they’re all going to need a good deal of brain bleach after this — especially Sam. Before he can get too antsy, he feels Cas’ hand settle at the small of his back, steadying him.
“I’m good,” Dean protests. “Shit, I’m… I’m
“This is your escape,” Amara explains as Cas gingerly takes the sphere from her. “When you’re ready to leave, crush it, and you, and anyone else in direct contact with you, will be transported back here. It only works once, so be sure you’re ready. There are no second chances, Castiel. Not in this.”
He pulls on Dad’s old leather jacket to shield himself from the cool morning breeze, his mood picking up as he remembers the diner downtown, and the sign behind the counter that advertised a pancake special. But he should’ve known he doesn’t get to have good things, because as soon as he steps out of Dad’s room, he clocks a sheriff’s department cruiser. Standing next to it are deputies Stick and Asshat, talking to the guy from reception.
Castiel smiles. Much like kissing Dean, hearing those words will never grow old to him. He’ll revel in them, roll in the simple syllables, allow them to sink into him, with the simple truth that Jack tells him, that Charlie tells him, that Kelly tells him, that even Bobby and Ellen and Jo tell him.
“Yeah, me too,” Sam admits, grinning, and Dean snorts so hard, he almost coughs up his latest sip of beer. Sam claps him on the back again, this time to help him breathe.
So here they are, in a psychic’s goddamn waiting room, bumping elbows on a couch that’s much too small for two grown men. After five minutes of staring at the wall, Dean gives up and starts reading through back issues of
Dean doesn’t know how much closer he can press to Cas. They’re already spine to spine, with the wings of Cas’ shoulders pushing gently against his. If he twists in a certain way, he can feel the knobs of Cas’ spine against his back. Then Cas shifts, and suddenly, Dean understands what Gael was talking about.
The soppy heart-eyes that Sam’s sending her way don’t have any bearing on his decision at all.
Dean gets into the car at the same time Castiel does, which means he gets a front row seat to Castiel sliding behind Baby’s wheel like he belongs there. Dean wants to reach out and slap him. In fact, he curls his hand into a fist before he reconsiders. The car is now moving, which means that Cas has the potential to wreck it. So Dean sits and seethes and plots his revenge.
Sam glares at Ellen. Not even the sound of the door opening and closing and Rufus’ shout of “Is someone gonna help me with the hell spawn stuck in my trunk or not?” shakes his concentration.
Sam closes his eyes, forcing calm. No matter how urgent their current situation might be, it also has to be extremely confusing for Ava, and she’s owed some answers. “I’ll explain later, Ava,” he says, trying to make it sound reassuring. “Really. I promise I will. It’s… kind of an insane story though. Honestly, someone having visions about my death isn’t even in the top five weirdest things that have happened to me this month.”
, he thinks, closing his eyes.
“Where does it need to go?” he asks, even as he scoops it up.
“Why’re you helping us?”
“Dean,” Cas groans, head falling forward to rest against Dean's shoulder. His hips buck into Dean’s body as he chases his own orgasm. “Oh, Dean.” Greedy hands clutch Dean closer, and Cas breathes his name into his ear like a benediction. “Oh fuck, Dean. You're so perfect. So beautiful, and you're
“No, really, it’s true!” Agnes says, looking distinctly annoyed at having her story doubted. “Everett drew me a picture of the monster just the other day. He said his grandpa saw it for real in the woods one time, and he’s always talking about it.” She turns to Dean and lowers her voice, conspiratorial, “I’m in love with Everett. That’s why we give each other pictures and stuff.”
Castiel waits until the cuff loosens before he speaks. “It didn’t come up in the conversation,” he answers drily.
“I understand, but you need to rest.” The nurse’s voice brooks no disagreement. “I promise you, your father is fine. He’s just next door, and when I last looked in on him, he was just starting his lunch.”
Dean pricks up his ears, trying to hear Sam’s response, but he doesn’t catch more than an indistinct mumble before Castiel hangs up the phone and turns to him. “If everything goes as planned, they’ll get here just after dark.”
“I’ve considered going back to school sometimes, but I’m mostly making this up as I go. What about you?”
“I don’t know anything more than that,” Dean says quickly. “But maybe I should. We’re about to walk into something together, and we don’t know what’s waiting for us once we get there. Guess I wanted to know what your endgame is.”
Cas’ fingers interlock with his, and Dean groans in relief as their skin comes together in a heated slide. His legs rise to hook around Castiel’s waist, which brings their cocks together. Pleasure sparks along his body, and Dean groans in delight. His legs tighten around Castiel’s hips, keeping him steady as he thrusts against him.
“Agent Harrison, I’m trying to concentrate,” Pierce says, his voice tight.
“Dean.”
Bobby huffs, like he knows he’s not getting the whole story, but he doesn’t bother to call Dean out on it. “Well, your man was right. Pituitary gland means kitsune; they’re the only thing around that will go for just that. Wraiths get the whole shebang.” He finally finds what he’s looking for. “Kitsune are solitary hunters and mostly nocturnal. Check around old abandoned bridges and tunnels; looks like that’s where they prefer to do the majority of their hunting.”
On the plate in front of her is a beautiful specimen of sea bass, grilled to perfection and served whole, garnished with nothing but olive oil, oregano and a slice of lemon. The taverna that produced this bit of culinary perfection huddles against the bottom of a cliff face on the other side of a small, sleepy byroad.
He’s being dragged along the ground, his head and shoulders bumping against every rock, branch, and toadstool in the path. When his vision clears, he can spy a blurry figure, at least seven feet tall, walking before him. Its skin is a sickly grey that looks more like something found in the deep ocean than in a forest. Claws dig into his calf and shin, and a steady trickle of blood winds its way down from his calf to his thigh and then further.
Two seconds later, frantic, heavy breathing echoes through the truck’s interior. “Sam! God, please pick up. Zach is here. He claims the police let him go, but he’s acting so strange and I… fuck, I’m scared.” A pause, and a rustle of fabric. Then, more quietly, “I thought the whole doppelganger idea was crazy, but—”
Of course, because Castiel’s life is an epic farce, Ash and Jo are waiting for him in the living room. Jo sprawls across the couch, and her mean little grin tells Castiel that she was waiting to corner him whenever he slunk back to civilization. Ash, meanwhile, in true Ash fashion, lies on the ground with his feet propped up against the back of the couch. He’s staring at the ceiling, seeing whatever Ash things are up there, but he moves quickly enough when Castiel digs a toe into his ribs.
Jess nods. Her mouth goes dry as she thinks back to Sam’s visions: her, burning on the ceiling; Sam, left alone… She’s tried not to think about how close she came, how she and Sam almost had their one bad night.
A mean-spirited part of Dean considers not bringing anything back for Cas. He discards the notion quickly. Quite apart from being a dick move that will leave Castiel in a pissy mood for the rest of the morning, it will probably look suspicious if he loads up his own container without bothering to bring back anything for his significant other.
“And this Jess we’re looking for, she’s… your girlfriend?”
“Dean.” Cas stands up. He twists his fingers together before he realizes what he’s doing, and then places them flat against his thighs. He takes a deep breath. Before Dean can stop him, Cas opens his mouth.
“For what it’s worth,” Jess says, stepping forward, a lopsided smile on her face, “I’d like you to stay too.”
“My dad, John Winchester,” Dean says, and Elkins’ eyes and gun swivel towards him. “He had your number in his journal. We used it to track your address.”
Jess watches him go.
“Things like… regrets,” she says, with obvious reluctance.
“Tough words for someone who’s been nursing a crush for weeks. Tell you what: you can ride my ass about
Andy grimaces at Sam. “Fought with her fiancé again,” he mouths.

Teasing words about Cas’ failure to immediately identify the flower are at the tip of Dean’s tongue, but he bites them back. Instead he just pockets his phone. “I’ll send them to Sam while we’re out today. We’ve got to run across a pocket of wifi sometime today.”
Jessica crosses her arms and raises an unimpressed eyebrow at Dean. “An undercover cop,” she says flatly. “This guy came in here armed with holy water and reciting a Catholic exorcism.” She studies first Sam, then Dean, taking in their closed-off, guilty faces. “You guys
He spends eight hours on duty with Castiel, splitting the time evenly between Castiel’s office and his home. After Jo shows up to relieve him at midnight, he drives back to his apartment, where he crashes on his bed for six hours, before he wakes up and drags himself to the precinct. There he goes over every piece of information about Dick Roman, Edgar, Sucrocorp, and LV-1THN. He talks to doctors, chemists, and everyone in between, searching for a lead.
“Beg pardon?”
“Listen, Sammy, I’m beat,” he says. “I’ll tell you all about it some other time, alright?”
“I’m sorry,” the man says. The knife gleams in his hand. “But Dean doesn’t belong to you. He never did.”
his eyes plead and order in turns.
Dean rushes past Castiel and sinks to his knees on the tile floor. The bizarre, awful figure sitting in a pool of red is no longer Alfie — it’s Sam. Sam, black-eyed and grinning, his front spattered with viscera.
Castiel bends back down into Baby’s interior to glare at him. “The day I use the words ‘romance’ and ‘Dean Winchester’ in the same sentence, you have my permission to shoot me.”
Maybe following this path was a way out after all. Maybe someone new is waiting for him here. Maybe, if he just gives voice to his hope, he’ll make it come true.
“If it weren’t for the people you’re working for, then none of that would have been necessary. They created a monster, and that monster created me. I can’t work for them. I won’t.”
Dean falls onto the hotel bed, too exhausted to do anything more other than roll to the center of the mattress. His boots are scuffing the bedspread, but since the linens are of dubious cleanliness, he doesn’t feel that guilty.
Probably Dean should lie, but faced with the dual assault of Sam’s puppy-dog eyes and his own lingering bitterness, the story of Elkins, the Colt, Azazel and Dad spills out. He omits a few details (he’s still not sure what the fuck happened with him and Cas, and like hell he’ll offer that part up for Sam’s perusal), but he tells Sam enough. Sam’s face darkens as Dean recounts waking up in the hospital only to find that Dad had left.
“Walking the perimeter to make sure the black-eyed fuckers are well and truly gone,” John says, shrugging. “He’ll probably be back in a couple minutes. Wanna come in while we wait?” He jerks his chin at the cabin door, but Castiel doesn’t move.
Doesn’t mean he has to be happy about what amounts to an essentially wasted day.
“He left,” is all Dean says to Sam and Eileen.
Castiel doesn’t bother to examine the swift joy coursing through him at the sound of Dean’s voice. That doesn’t matter. What matters is that Dean is alive, even if Castiel does find him pinned to a wall. Other than looking a little breathless, Dean isn’t outwardly hurt.
No matter what else happens, he did what he set out to do. Cas is still alive. And that’s worth something. It's worth
“Sam, stop!” Jess’ voice is too close to his ear, and Sam understands who's holding him. All the fight goes out of him and he sags. A small
Sam isn’t exactly sure when he started to raise his voice, but by the end, he’s shouting. Dean doesn’t seem put out though. He just nods, lips pursed and eyes fixed on the road ahead. “It’s not,” he says quietly.
At the order, thinly veiled as a question, Castiel’s spine straightens. “Of course,” he answers. Despite his quick answer, he’s cautious as he leads Dean out of the foyer and down the hallway. “Please. Come this way.”
“We can do this,” Jess tells him quietly. “We’ll save him.”
His phone buzzes again, bringing his attention back to the matter at hand.
, he tries to say,
back. I’m not leaving him with that demon bitch a
Cas’ voice cuts through his anger like a blade.
idea what I—”
Dean reaches out. In one quick movement, he takes both of Castiel’s wrists in one  hand. Castiel gasps as the tiny bones of his wrists press against each other. It’s not quite hard enough to hurt, but the threat is present. Castiel’s gasp is tiny and punched out of his lungs, like it was everything that little inhalation could do to escape. Dean wonders what it would take to make Castiel lose his iron-clad control and make him
Dean’s jaw clenches. “Yeah, I’m not doing that.”
The last thing Dean hears, before Meg ends the call, is Cas’ voice breaking on a yell of pain.
“Sex? Or sex with someone that you work with?”
Castiel never gets an answer to his question. Someone asks, “Who are you?” and Castiel hurries to crawl out of the van.
Castiel focuses inward, feels the precious few remaining tendrils of grace swirling inside himself. “Not… all the way. But almost. A matter of days, I think.”
“You do,” Jess says, and judging by the woman’s guilty flinch, she’s read the tell correctly. “That’s okay. We’ve got people on our side who are just like you. They can do things like control other people’s minds, or see things before they happen.”
“The son of a bitch who killed your family was still out there,” Dean finishes.
John sneers at her. “I don’t have to stand here and listen to a kid and the fucking queer who corrupted my son.”
“Come in,” he says, struggling upright.
“Yeah well, try thirty-two years and then come back and see me,” Dean mutters, with enough warning behind the words to scare Castiel off trying to retort.
“Yeah,” Dean answers. Certainty settles into his bones, the sense of
Grumbling under his breath, Castiel deposits him in the Continental's passenger seat, hands still cuffed behind his back.
Cas’ hips roll into Dean’s body as Dean bucks into Cas. They set a rhythm older than time, one that needs no words or thought to maintain. Within short order, Dean’s shirt finds its way onto the floor, and then they’re sliding together, skin to skin.
“Yeah. Something like… bad reception on a TV. Edges getting fuzzy, music cutting out.” Dean shivers. “Something long and black, like a… a rip or a tear.”
“Dean, turn up here,” Sam reminds him, his own voice tight with anxiety. “Cas?” he calls, looking in the backseat as though he’ll find Cas hiding in the floorboards. “Dean, I don’t know — holy shit!”
“Good to see you,” Bobby says, which is as good as a hug. “You don’t call near as much as you should.”
He moves like a machine through meetings and business trips. He’s never been quite so efficient, but that’s because there’s no room in his life for anything other than work. He thought his life was empty before, but he’d had dreams, things he’d wanted to accomplish. Now, all those dreams are shattered at his feet, and the medication takes away his desire to dream for more.
But worse still that Castiel Harvelle looks damn good in a suit.
The autopsy photos show that all three victims died of a stab wound. The blade entered into the brain through the soft spot just behind the ear. The coroner noted that the brain trauma was ‘massive,’ but failed to state exactly what that entailed.
He leads the way to a medium-sized shed behind the Harvelles’ house. The floor and ceiling have been painted with devil’s traps, and in the middle of the room sits a young woman in her late twenties or early thirties, hands tied to the arms of a chair. She’s glaring at them out of coal-black eyes, her long brown hair matted with blood.
Castiel takes a deep, long-suffering breath, like Dean’s company being inflicted on him is the worst tragedy in the history of the universe. “Remember that thing I mentioned? Where we have an actual lead on the demon case?”
A pause follows. “Sam?”
“Scott, dude,” Andy says. “Just shake his hand. You said you can control it, right?”
Castiel tucks the gun away in the waistband of his jeans, but pulls a small flask out of one of the pockets. “Don’t come any closer,” he warns, as soon as he’s got the door open, and pours a bit of the flask’s contents onto the back of his hand. When there’s no reaction, he passes the flask outside.
The scent of coffee in the mornings when he would start a fresh pot before Dean and Sam awoke.
“Yeah.” The line crackles with a heavy exhale. “I miss you, lady. I’ll go through the library, see if I can find anything solid on that Colt thing.”
“Fuck,” Sam mutters, and Jess’ head whips around.
Dean tries to put on a good face for Jack, but the look he gets from Cas sends a bolt of foreboding through his body. It settles, hard and mean, in the pit of his belly. Something’s not right. He can taste it in the air. Cas sits up and looks around the room like he’s never seen it before.
By the end, Meg is seething. “I’ll fucking kill him,” she swears, forgetting to be gentle as her fingers clamp down on the meat of Castiel’s arm. He yelps and squirms away from her, slapping at her thigh in remonstrance. “Sorry,” she mutters, sounding anything but.
“All right. All right.” With that, Castiel slinks back to the bedroom, leaving Dean alone to curse his own stupidity.
“Hey, Andy.” Sam rushes to Andy's side, pulling away his hands to look at the ruin of Andy’s gut. His chest tightens when he sees the result of his actions. “Oh, Andy. No.”
Dean clutches the phone so tightly that the cheap plastic creaks under his fingers. “What do you want?”
Dean’s head whips over to the side. Cas’ voice is weak, drifting on the breeze, but when he squints, he can almost make out the shape of him against the dark wall of the mausoleum. “Cas? You hanging in there?”
Dean doesn’t bother looking at either side of him to confirm that Cas and Bobby are still with him. He has to trust that they are. His goal has narrowed down to a single point: to find Azazel and kill him. It’s the only way they’re going to make it out of this.
Their voices call after him, mocking and gleeful. Castiel doesn’t doubt for a second that they know exactly where he is. He’s not exactly stealthy in his retreat. There’s no guile or cunning left in him, only the mindless need to put as much distance between them and him.
Though Castiel doesn’t mind his job at the university, he misses his former workplace at the public library. At the public library, there were no rare texts to catalogue, and their budget was whatever came after shoestring, to the point where Castiel repaired many of the books with his own supplies, but he had more interaction with the patrons. Children with sticky fingers and sauce smeared at the corners of their mouths would come to him and demand a book, giving him no more information than the very vague ‘I think it had a red cover’ and ‘Maybe there was a lion?’. Somehow, Castiel would find a way to fulfill their requests. Seeing the delight spread over their faces when he performed the impossible and got them their requested book was the highlight of his day.
Dean rubs at the three-day stubble on his cheek with the palm of his hand, trying to hide his reaction. When it feels safe to uncover his face and look at Bobby, the old man’s expression is dangerously close to pity.
Time slows, unspooling in a series of uncountable moments. Cas’ eyes widen in horror. His hand reaches for the gun Jess knows is tucked at his back. Ansem pushes past Andy and runs down the front steps, away from the house. Her own hands close around her weapon with cold, irresistible finality. Andy’s eyes dart frantically between them, then to Ansem’s quickly retreating figure.
Castiel sits up straighter. The lazy, pizza-and-beer-induced stupor he’d fallen into vanishes, to be replaced with keen interest. “Really?” he asks. He tries not to sound too eager, knowing that showing too much enthusiasm is a surefire way to frighten Dean off of almost any idea.
“Sorry about the crack on your car,” Dean offers. Novak’s eyes dart to him but he doesn’t lose the moue of displeasure. “But just saying, it could use some maintenance. It’s a pretty crappy excuse for a Continental.”
The interview with Robert Shaw is among the more excruciating periods of time Sam has spent, and that’s saying something. He grew up with a teenaged Dean.
He makes his way through the house, one hand poised in his jacket pocket. He’s not expecting there to be anyone in the house; he knows for a fact that Jo and Charlie cleared out about an hour ago, but it’s when you never expect something to happen that something, inevitably, happens.
Though Cas must have heard the door open, he doesn’t react. He walks out in a plank and holds the position for a full sixty seconds (Dean counts). The pudge on Dean’s lower belly, carefully cultivated through a diet of burgers and pies, quivers in a mixture of jealousy and fear. After holding his plank, Cas walks his palms and feet back until he’s bent in half once more. Another full minute passes while Cas holds that position without wavering. After the minute expires, he releases his breath in a slow exhalation and straightens. He rolls his shoulders, one after the other, and finally looks at Dean.
Cas’ eyelashes flutter on his cheek before his eyes open. The sharp blue is dulled, but Dean catches the spark of recognition in their depths. A tiny croak comes out of his mouth before he asks, “Dean?”

Jess’ hands stop tugging at him, though she remains close. In the darkness just outside the annex, her eyes are huge and shining. Dean drags the phone away from his ear and puts it on speaker so that Jess can hear. He tries not to notice the violent trembling in his hands.
“Shit.” Aggie stretches the single syllable into at least five and finishes with a whistle through her teeth. “You don’t do things by halves, do you?”
Then the larger realization comes, which is, if he was naked, that means that he has a body to be unclothed.
stomach, he suddenly realizes, telling him it needs food.
Cas’ eyes are sharp with interest. He looks like a bloodhound catching the scent, and Dean finally realizes: Cas wasn’t lying when he said that hunting was in his blood, perhaps as much as it is Dean’s.
bring my son into this.”
“Son of a bitch!”
The thought catches at the back of his mind, like an annoying little burr, or like the earworm of the Kansas song, and once it’s there, he can’t get it out.
Her fingers dance over Dean’s face and down his throat. A strangled cry of fear catches in Castiel’s chest at the sight of those cruel hands so close to Dean’s vulnerable points. His mother and father’s bodies flash through his mind, the ruin of soft flesh after Meg had finished.
. Would you stop hovering and let me get on with my life?”
He’s confident, at least, that Dean won’t send him away this time. But there will be an adjustment period, a time to grieve for what he’s losing, and it will come sooner rather than later. After all, Castiel just spent several hours sleeping, for the second time in as many days.
These thoughts rattle through his mind before they reach out and take root. No matter how he tries to banish them, they still burrow in further, until they drown out everything else in his head. Sam blinks, trying to clear his mind, but he still hears the insidious voices:
“I look forward to it,” Cas says, with considerably more dignity. Damn him.
Castiel thinks back to the morning and Dean munching on the stupid candy. “Well,” he says, searching his brain for an appropriate response. “That was some quick thinking.”
“You’re welcome,” Castiel says, and holds out his hand. John eyes it suspiciously, but takes it, and Castiel pulls him up none too gently. John winces when his weight hits his injured leg, but declines any further assistance, limping outside and to the Impala’s passenger seat under his own steam.
“No,” Castiel whispers as he watches Dean’s face go slack.
She picks up her plate and slams it into the sink. The noise clatters around the apartment and a thin crack spiderwebs out from the plate’s center. Jess can't bring herself to care.
somebody else in the building, Castiel?”
“Psychic, remember?” Ava says, tapping the side of her head.
Cas looks at him from across the room. The corners of his eyes crinkle in a smile, and Dean’s heart flip-flops in response.
Cas wanted quick and dirty, so he’ll get quick and dirty.
Dean has the uncomfortable feeling that if he gets into a verbal argument with this man, then he’s going to lose. Badly.
“I know!” His voice comes out as a roar, and Sam has to make a concentrated effort to bring his voice down. “I know, I know.”
Dean blinks. Castiel. He knows Castiel.
“Fuck,” he says. “That’s Ansem.”
Dean shakes off the lingering disquiet from Cas’ departure and makes his way to the two remaining couples. It takes effort to push himself into his small-talk, upper-middle class mode, but he masters an easy, guileless smile as he introduces himself as Michael Highfill.
Morning comes early at the annex, with the sun peeking through the blinds in the room that Jess is sharing with Sam. She rolls over onto her side and squints at the window. Beside her, Sam lies on his back, snoring softly.
The demon piloting Cas’ body stands in the center of the floor, clad in nothing but the scrub pants. Lines of red wind down Cas’ chest and stomach to drip onto the floor. It’s enough blood loss to have a normal person unconscious, but the demon doesn’t even falter. Dean’s heart catches in his chest. It’s so much blood...even if they do manage to pull the spell off and close the gates, how is Cas going to survive?
She’s earnest and polite when she approaches him. At first Dean thinks that she’s just going to ask him for directions. She falls into step beside him, offering a small smile as she comments, “Not a bad night out.”
“I love you,” Cas whispers, as though it’s the only thing that matters.
“Wait,” Castiel almost yells, then breathes a sigh of relief when the phone call isn’t immediately ended. He rubs at his temples. “Look, I know what this looks like, but I promise, I’m not a crazy stalker, or anything like that. It’s just, one of your contractors and I, we had a disagreement and now he’s not answering his phone or my texts, and I really… I need to talk to him,” Castiel whispers, horrifying himself into silence at the realization that he’s spilling out his troubles for a perfect stranger. “I
Before he can ask, Castiel picks up the thread of the conversation. “Anyway, you see now why Sam and Jess couldn’t stay in Stanford. I’m taking them with me to a safe house in Nebraska while we figure out next steps. My friend Ash is there too, and he’s gathered some information that might be helpful in learning more about Azazel’s plan.”
“Good to know that my subconscious has your sense of humor down.” Dean glares at Cas. “Why the fuck are you here, anyway? It’s a dick move, even for my brain.”
“Oh, fuck.” Dean’s hands flutter around Castiel's shoulders, like he’s not certain where he should put them. He settles for cupping the curve of Castiel’s skull, with a touch as light as a whisper. “Fuck, Cas,” he breathes, arching his back as Castiel plucks at his belt buckle.
“Those are your provisions?” Castiel asks, sounding genuinely appalled.
Touch returns to his cheeks and this time, it stays. He blinks again, and the haze in front of his eyes clears, and he can finally see that face, familiar and beloved.
,” he continues, glaring defiantly in Dean’s direction.
Dean puts his concerns about Shane aside and focuses on his primary objective: getting information. He pitches his voice a little lower, forcing everyone else to lean in close to him. The look he throws over his shoulder is not entirely for show: Ciara seems to have a nasty habit of showing up where she’s least expected, and he doesn’t want to be interrupted by her cheery offers of help. “I’ve got to tell you, Steven and I almost cancelled our reservations here. He finally managed to talk me into it, and nothing’s happened, but I’ve got to ask… With those deaths that happened earlier in the season… Did any of you see anything weird?”
Though that’s certainly not her intent, Zoe’s question strikes right at the heart of him. Dean’s brain flips through several possible answers
“Are you okay? Do you need help?”
Freedom.
Jess hums in muted surprise. “Really?” she asks. “Even after… this is finished, you want to keep hunting?”
“Sure you don’t, princess,” Bobby says, cutting himself a particularly big bite of steak. “Must’ve been hallucinating that one time you brought me a casserole when I was laid up with a broken leg.”
A humorless scoff sounds over the line. “He’s lying. I know Elkins pretty well. He comes from old money. Used to be a stockbroker until vamps killed his son. The place where you’re at, that’s his old vacation home. He doesn’t need to sell his stuff to get money. And I guarantee you, if he’s got a weapon like that, he’ll never give it up.”
“I’m not mad,” he assures Charlie. “And I meant it. It’s just a one-time thing. It was stupid as fuck of me,” he sighs, running his fingers through his hair. “I just...Well hell.” He laughs. “You’ve seen him.”
. I yell about Destiel, and Misha, and sometimes nothing at all.
“No, it’s fine.” Dean scrubs at the back of his neck. “Sam gets kind of boring on the phone you know? But if he has someone to impress then he’ll bring out the really heavy conversation guns.”
“Oh, don’t be so sure. I’ve known some that would sell their souls if it meant that they could make partner and get a corner office.” Sam pauses for a moment. In the background, Dean hears the quiet whirs of an office waking up. “So why is Castiel Novak the hot topic of conversation?”
The door opens, and both Castiel and Jess instinctively rise, squaring their stance in preparation for an attack.
“Would be to enlist the services of a Dominant.” With a single, brutal sentence, Pamela spears any remaining hope.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Give me a break. Monsters don’t get
It’s then that he blinks and looks around. He and Jess are the only ones standing on an empty street.
she says. She blinks and her eyes are glassy. “I just think we need a break.”
knows
“So, are you ready to tell me what’s on your mind?” Pamela asks. Her eyes never waver from where they’re fixed on his face. Castiel is the one to look away. He’d known that he was going to have to talk about this eventually, but he’d harbored the naive hope that it wasn’t going to be any time soon. “This is the first yearly checkup where Hannah hasn’t had to drag you kicking and screaming into the exam room.”
“Hey,” Dean finally says, patting Castiel’s stomach to get his attention. “What’s going on? I can
“Castiel. Castiel.” Dean raps sharply on Cas’ forehead with the tips of his fingers and gets nothing more than a scrunched up face of displeasure. He repeats the action. This time Castiel’s eyes open in poisonous slits as a disgruntled growl issues from his chest. “Listen, I want to stay here tonight, all right? You’re still floating, and I’m worried that you could drop in the morning. If you’re not comfortable with that, let me know, but I really think it would be a good idea if I stayed.”
is a hope that she holds in her heart until she rounds the corner and something crashes into the back of her skull.
The elevator arrives at the push of a button, and Dean steps in. Thankfully, it’s empty which means Dean’s ride up to the twenty-fifth floor is one of peace and silence. He doesn’t think he could stand the torture of small talk.
If Uriel had taken a knife and stabbed him in the back, Castiel couldn’t have been more surprised. He gapes for a moment at the man who he once regarded as a trusted colleague.
“It’s working,” Jess says, grinning wide and beautiful and clearly pleased with herself.
Cas makes a sound so ragged that it’s almost a growl, and, fucking finally, pushes inside with one finger, then two. Dean is still so loose and wet from Cas’ tongue, it doesn’t feel like enough, and he makes sure to point that out.
, when could they finally
Bobby is standing under the tin-roofed overhang that shields the entrance to the bar, looking just the same as always — surly and gruff, under a ball cap that’s held together mostly by hope and grit.
“We don’t get what we want,” Dean says harshly. “No hunter does. You think my dad got what he wanted?”
“Sam, I’m fine, and I’m perfectly capable of defending myself,” Jess snaps.
Castiel whimpers as Dean’s gentle fingers in his hair turn into a fist. He uses his grip to crush their lips together. Someone’s tooth splits skin, and Castiel tastes copper, but that’s a minor concern. Of far more import are Dean’s eyes, sparkling in the dim lighting of the Roadhouse.
Cas’ expression is frozen in marble as he steers the Continental through an outlying neighborhood of Guthrie. To an outsider, he would seem perfectly calm, but Jess is starting to learn this about him: the more stoic his demeanor, the more he’s freaking the fuck out.
A voice, deep and rough, reaches Sam as if from underwater. He blinks to awareness and realizes he’s lying on his side on the ground, curled up in a fetal position. Cas is kneeling over him, eyes narrowed in concern.
Dean slides out of his hiding spot, barely daring to breathe. If he’s careful then he can dart among the corpses and make it to the door. He takes one step, then another, and releases a slow breath, allowing himself a moment of relief. Caught in the open, he doesn’t realize his mistake until he sees the cold, sadistic smile spread across Naomi’s face.
The annex kitchen is deserted, which isn’t unexpected. Ellen’s stopped letting other hunters stay overnight, forgoing the extra income to ensure the safety of Andy, Sam and any other "special children" they might bring back here. Right before the trip to Guthrie, Jess floated the idea of paying Ellen for letting them stay at the annex, but Ellen just grimaced and waved her off, declaring the subject closed.
“You think you could actually get away with that--”
Dean swallows, hard. “I
Castiel clenches his jaw. “How do I know you’re telling the truth?” he says, to gain time. “For all I know, you’re the Shadow, wearing Ruby’s face.”
“What? Why?” Jess asks, light and pleasant with just a hint of confusion, though Castiel has a feeling she’s homed in on the source of Max’s distress already.
“Yes. She always used to ask if she could help clean his weapons, and he finally became so annoyed that he said he’d let her do it ‘when pigs fly.’ I don’t think Mr. Abbott’s pig ever quite recovered after she tried to put those wings on it.”
“Well, maybe if you knew how to do your job, I wouldn’t have to tell you how to do it,” Rufus counters, chopping at the remaining bits of onion with unwarranted savagery.
“Believe me, it wasn’t
Naomi’s face turns hard and brittle. “Fine. Do you want to know what it took your precious Dean Winchester to forsake you? A six-figure check and an internship for his younger brother. In the end, that’s what you were worth to him.”
Thunder rolls through the barn, shaking through the wood down to the dirt floor. Dean’s head jerks upright as he scans the barn. “Cas?” he calls, hardly daring to hope. “Castiel?”
But more than anything else, there is
“All right, so I guess you’re ready to go home?” He turns to pack up, but he’s stopped by Castiel stepping forward.
Something twists inside Sam at the thought, but he pushes it down and forces his breathing to steady. “It’s okay, Jack.” He tries to hitch on a reassuring smile, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Maybe later.
Jess. Jess, who believes in him. Who’s saved his life on more than one occasion.
“Cas, we don’t have to,” Dean says, brushing his thumb over the delicate skin underneath Cas’ eye. “None of your plans involved hunting on the weekends.”
By now, there’s no way that Cas doesn’t know Dean’s there, but he never acknowledges him. He stares at the patch of floor between his bare feet as though it holds the answers to the universe. Dean steps forward, not wanting to disturb Cas, but also not wanting to leave him alone.
