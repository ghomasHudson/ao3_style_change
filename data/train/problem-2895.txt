If today proved anything to him, it's that he's already way too invested. He's never been more terrified than by Jack's disappearance. That's not okay. That's not how you're supposed to feel about your neighbor's kid, or even your friend's kid. He can't be more. Dean can't have all that just to fuck it up. He can't be a disappointment to someone he loves again. Not to Cas. Not when it could hurt Jack too. They both deserve better. Better than Dean.
Pamela looks a little disappointed, even if she tries to hide it, and explains to him that it might take time. He feels like so much time has passed already, yet it still feels like it all happened yesterday. Maybe it always will.
"Oh. Oh. Yeah. That makes sense." Castiel looks like he needs to sit down. His eyes keep going to the bubbly water before he catches himself and brings them right back up. He's obviously flustered and...
Dean stirs at the sound of his neighbor's dog barking. He groans a little, his right hand sliding under his shirt to scratch at his stomach as the other one caress his hair in a soothing move. If he doesn’t open his eyes, he can nearly believe it’s someone else’s hand caressing him like this.
“Go on then. And you better not touch my beer. I may be older and fatter than you, but I can still kick your ass.”
“Are you really gonna take pictures every time I take a nap with my son?” the hunter grumbles, wincing at the sensation of Jimmy drooling on his collarbone as he sleeps.
"Look, Dean, I've found a stick!!" Jack announces excitedly, nearly hitting Dean in the face with it when Dean squat down to greet the three years old boy.
Dean looks up in surprise. The man is searching his gaze, but Dean's eyes are wet with tears that he doesn't want him to see, so he fixes his stare back to his own lap and shakes his head minutely. The man takes a long sigh. Dean can hear the noise his beard makes as he scratches it.
“We’re not sure yet,” Castiel says, squinting at his child like his powers would suddenly be written right onto his forehead. “I’m not looking forward to him learning to smite things, to be honest.”
"Mister Singer, I must thank you. I understand that your generosity has changed this young man's life for the better, and I am grateful to you for it."
"Maybe. I -," Cas wipes his mouth in frustration, "When Jack ran away in July, it was...Nick had called. It was during my yoga class, Jack picked up the house phone."
It's probably an understatement. Naomi looks like she's worried just sitting here is giving her some kind of disease. He'd bet his Baby that she's not gonna touch her coffee. He still puts a cupful in front of her, before sitting on the other side of the table.
Dean feels like he's gonna throw up. He's not sure if Castiel grabbing his hand makes it worse or not. The touch is strangely soothing, as is being able to squeeze someone's hand to pass his nerves. On the other hand, he's holding hands with a dude. Huh. Weird. They talked about PDA and all that on the way here, both deciding to keep it to a minimum, while still trying to do the basic new couple things: hand holding, a hand on the back, and minimal personal space (that last one seems to be usual for Cas anyway).
“He’s barely adjusting. How do you want him to live a normal life when you keep-” his foster mom is saying, audibly upset.
They don't like the same things, and while Dean could hold a conversation with Cas and his family, offer some nodding and semi-pertinent questions, he won't be able to fool them for long. Certainly not long enough for them to have any kind of relationship. Cas is bound to realize that they just don't have anything in common.
"Could you…," Dean bites his bottom lip, frowning at the pair of jeans he can't quite fold right, "I'd prefer it if you didn't have some kind of orgy here...if that's okay with you."
It still feels weird to say that to a dude, even more so because it's a lie. Cas looks like crap. He looks like the contrary of Dean actually. His scruff and hair look longer, and his cheeks are a little more hollowed. Dean hates the way that makes his stomach turn in worry, so he diverts his eyes.
Dean's arms come around his shoulders, squeeze until he's as close as he possibly can be, until Castiel feels like he can breathe again. There are lies but no regrets. He loves this Dean as much as he loves old Dean. They are one and the same in all the ways that matter.
Thankfully that seems to catch Jack's attention as the kid starts observing and poking at Dean's work.
"I've kept you a seat right beside me," Naomi says, pulling a chair for him to sit, right next to the head of the table.
"I'm sure," he says tenderly, squeezing Cas' hand in his and slipping his other arm behind him until he can hug him to his side. "This is good too."
Cas looks at him with envy, because he feels like he doesn’t want to be there for what will follow either. Bobby is looking murderous and the atmosphere is very tense.
He feels ridiculous saying stuff like that. He's so out of his comfort zone right now, how did he even end up in this situation? He's not good with kids, never was. Hell, he's pretty sure he's never had a full conversation with a child before he met Jack, not since he was one himself.
"Actually, Naomi, duck sounds like a delicious idea," Dean says, voluntarily ignoring her question. To be honest, he’s never even eaten duck before, but it's poultry so it probably tastes like chicken. You can't go wrong with chicken, right? His stomach certainly likes the idea, gurgling so loudly that he has to hide it behind a cough.
After that, Charlie comes every day after school. They do their homeworks and play board games until just before dinner. She tries to convince the FBI agents that Jo “is cool” and can come too, but they already look disapproving of her presence, so she doesn’t push it.
Jo is crying with laughter, holding the phone pointed in their direction. She runs away very fast as soon as Dean finally manages to get up. Dean takes to step as if to follow, but stops and looks down at himself. His white and blue plaid shirt is completely soaked through and dripping on the ground. He looks like a drenched puppy with his hair flattened like this.
Dean feels like he should say something. Maybe apologize for overreacting, or thanking him for the massage, or berating him some more for leaving his kid alone like that. He's not sure, so he doesn't say anything.
Ricky was his last shot. It was a long one, he really does owe that bastard some serious money. Guess he can kiss the job interview at two goodbye. It was for some kind of assistant job. It sounded easy enough, buying coffee and picking dry cleaning and stuff. But it was still a long shot anyway. Dean's only real job experience is being a bagger boy when he was seventeen and it lasted about two months before his dad decided to move them further east.
“What was that all about?” Jo immediately asks, pointing at the jocks’ table and looking ready to bust out laughing in mockery. God, this family was the worst.
It’s the first time he's been back at school since everyone learnt about Carver Edlund’s cult, and the fact that Castiel grew up in it. Even though it’s been months now since everyone discovered the truth, Cas’ doubts anyone forgot about it.
"Yeah," Hannah confesses, blowing out a breath. "She takes after my mother in more than one aspect."
"If you expect that idjit to have ever opened a book, you'd have better luck expecting a fish to speak Spanish" Bobby interrupts from the kitchen's doorway.
A loud shriek resonates in the room, but it isn’t the baby in front of him that is crying. It seems to be coming from the other side of the room and Dean’s soul rushes to it. The sound is coming from the other side of the wall, but there is no breach to pass through. Dean's soul tries to break the wall, bump into it again and again as Jimmy continues to cry on the other side, but he can’t get through. The Wave comes poking at him in askance. Dean’s soul bumps into the wall again, trying to show him, but the Wave tilts slightly to the side in incomprehension.
"About that," Castiel says, looking uncomfortable and suddenly finding the dashboard very fascinating. "Would you be willing to grant me your services again in a couple of weeks?"
Dean aches too much to see him to know that it would hurt too much to watch him go away again. He can’t get Cas back just to lose him again. He’s done losing people he loves and God knows that, after Sam, Castiel has been the one he loved the most. Cared about the most, in whichever way he allowed himself to.
After ten days that go pretty much the same, with Cas leaving in the morning and coming back straight to his room at night, Dean realizes that maybe giving him space is not the way. He tried it. He really did. It isn’t working.
“What can I say, I’m a charmer,” Dean declares cockily when the kid grabs both his cheeks to look at him upside down. Cas seems ill-at-ease, wriggling on his chair. “What about this Bartholomew asshole? Did you catch him?”
Dean looks like he’s blushing a little. “Come on, Cas, I thought what we did a few minutes ago was proof enough.”
“Dude, everyone on the whole damn planet would literally kill to be able to read that,” she explains like it’s obvious.
The man's touch seems to change as it slides along his legs, less pressing and more brushing, sometimes palping. It's a little weird and makes Dean squirm.
"When we were kids, my brothers would spend hours running around and rough-housing, but not Cas. He could sit under a tree for hours reading, or lie on the ground and just look at the sky," she says. She starts to laugh to herself as she seems to remember something. "He got lost in those very woods one summer. Everyone has been in the water, jet skiing and such, and suddenly we turned around and he wasn't there anymore. They had to bring a search party and everything. There were helicopters circling the woods. It took hours to find him. I had never seen my mother so upset before. Or again, really," Hannah reflects. "You know what he said when he was asked why he ran away?"
He sends a look toward Sam and Naomi. They nod and start reading the incantation. It’s the same text, but Sam is reading in latin while Naomi reads it in enochian.
Dean's heart is suddenly in his throat. He can't help but look around, a little frantic to notice that more than one other pair of eyes are admiring Cas too. Dean can't help but tense up. It's not so much jealousy...Okay, not
“Fuck!” Dean exclaims, getting up. “You, look after him for a minute. Anything happens to him and I’ll find you and kick your ass, you hear me?” he threatens a skinny guy who nods, looking terrified. Dean runs back into the house.
His balls are against Cas' ass, tight heat massaging him from the inside and Dean is sure for a second that he's going to come right this instant.
His Father may have had a strict view of the world and quite a God complex (to say the least), but Lucifer was the one in charge of enforcing the rules. He was the one that took Anna away. He was the one you were sent to if you ever doubted his Father’s word or disobeyed. He was the one most of Jimmy’s stories were about.
The sheets are a little rough against the tender skin of his cock, the pressure not quite enough. Dean raises up a little more on his knees so he can slide one of his hands under his own hips to stroke himself. He moans loudly around his mouthful at the warm squeeze of skin on skin. It's so good that he suddenly can't breathe anymore and has to lean back, releasing Cas' cock.
“You goddamn idjits!” The gruff voice makes him jump, waking him up. Cas immediately throws up on the backseat’s floor.
While the call of the pie is strong, his heart still hasn't calmed down from his earlier panic at having lost Jack. He's not sure it will until he has seen that the kid is alright with his own two eyes.
“Sam thinks we can use the bunker’s detection system, he just doesn’t know how to make it work yet.”
, he remembers, but oh how he wishes he could see it, see what Castiel looks like in all his glory, his true form. Instead when he reaches for him, it’s only in an immaterial way. He can feel how powerful, how pure Cas true essence really is.
The other man seems surprised by Dean's answer. He lowers his gun, the light finally leaving Dean's face so that he can blink against the dark spot in his vision until he gets his first look at the man standing a few feet away. He's about sixty with a beard and a round belly, a baseball cap on his head and a trucker vest over plaid. He's observing Dean from head to toes with a frown, like he doesn't know what to make of him. His shotgun is pointed at the ground, but the two dogs are still growling so Dean keeps his hands in the air.
Castiel’s new apartment was as obsolete as Dean expected it to be. It was just a small room where they could barely fit the huge sofa Dean made him buy, a small kitchenette, a barely decent bathroom, and a bedroom with a surprisingly big wardrobe that Castiel didn’t even have enough clothes to fill since he was still wearing the Winchester's hand me downs.
“Blananaba,” the kid exclaims, smashing his little hands on the keyboard while Dean is distracted, touching his lip to check if it’s bleeding.
Cas passes over the details of his own story after that. He goes straight to a couple years later, when he had just bought this house and became Castiel, to the day Kelly rang his doorbell with a toddler and a blackeye. Again, Castiel opened his home to her, and his heart to his nephew. Nick was a manipulative bastard though and Kelly went back after a couple months. She came back a few more times after that. Cas never had the heart to send her away, even though he could never really convince her to stay either.
By the time Jack is asleep, Dean is about ready to go to sleep too. He goes to his bedroom to get changed (he's still wearing that damn tutu) and stops on the threshold, mouth hanging open and wondering if he's already asleep and dreaming.
The man comes back and throws a towel on Dean's lap. "What kind of idjit stays outside in this weather?"
"And brush your teeth while you're at it!" Dean calls. A clashing noise a few seconds later makes him realise what he just said and he rushes to the bathroom. "Not at the same time!!"
Father never expected them to give him children, they weren’t allowed, but they were the ones that brought teenage girls to Heaven. The Archangels kept them with them until the girls were devoted to Father, until all they could think about was to give him perfect children. The Archangels were also the ones that took their imperfect children away. Their simple presence inspired terror.
Dean Winchester also seems much more agreeable than the other boys called “jock” in his group. Cas had noticed before how he never acts mean, and seems easy going with everyone. Castiel even witnesses him correcting his friends’ impolite or abusive behavior toward other students on more than one occasion. He never acts as rude as them. He also acts respectfully toward their teachers, which doesn’t seem to be usual for teenagers. Castiel is always baffled by the way other students act toward adults. It’s so different to how he was taught to treat his elders as a child.
Struggling to get out of the Impala without dropping the pile of food, Cas nods toward the backseat as Dean comes around to help.
“That was very rude!” Cas accuses, trying to take the ball back from Dean’s hand who just throws it away.
For months he’s been bathing in communal showers with other men or washing himself in the bathroom of the gas station that he used as his home. Since he’s been human, he only took two warm showers like this, without having to worry about keeping an eye on his bag or avoiding leery looks.
“Nothing, Sammy. Don’t worry. Go back to sleep, I’ll explain tomorrow.” Dean’s voice is affectionate, but still sounds like an order.
The sun isn't up yet, but Cas lying in bed in those pink lace panties is the first thing Dean thinks about when he wakes up the next morning. His hand is on Cas' lower back, the other man still cuddled to his side and Dean can't help but push the cover down until he can see those damn panties. Cas shivers at the cold air hitting his skin, nestling more against the warm body beside him. Dean turns a little, hugging him tighter and passing a hand through Cas' hair.
Cas groans at the surname. He’s not sure he remembers everything, but that damn chant is still going on in some part of his brain.
"I don't agree with the type of massage Miss Beckett wants though," Castiel adds with a small pout. He shrugs it off quickly. "I wish I could have been a better help to you. Although I do understand why you got vexed."
As if he can hear the thought, the Wave enveloppes him again, pushing around him when Dean’s soul tries to get away. Dean is sucked into a breach, unable to hold back to the nothingness.
"Someone is feeling ambitious," Cas teases as he goes to sit down above the covers, his back against the head of the bed.
"All the time! But that's not what that's about," Jody teases, "The guy looks like a pompous ass and you know how patient Bobby is with those."
A few days later as he goes through his morning routine (after a blissfully childfree night), Dean doesn’t recognize the bunker. There are toys on every surface AND on the floor. There’s a highchair and bottles in the kitchen, freaking baby food in the beer rack of the fridge.
"Wouldn't you like to know!" someone says as he joins them. He's a smaller man with light brown hair just that side of too long and a smirk that looks like it's a permanent feature on his thin lips.
“No, but seriously, what the fuck, Sam?” Dean asks, pacing the length of their motel room back and forth.
Cas can’t help but be hurt by the reminder of Winchester’s animosity toward him. He’s again reminded that everything that has happened to their relationship these past three days has only been one sided.
"Only four years but-," Dean looks down at his plate. He's not ashamed of his past, he's just not sure if sharing it with this crowd is a good idea. It's Castiel's hand squeezing his thigh that convinces him. Those people have opened their house and family to him, the least he could do is share some of his history too. "My mom died when he was still a baby, and I had to care for him."
The line of the coffee shop shortens again, the barista asking her order to the goody-two-shoes in front of him. Dean looks regretfully at the display of sandwiches. He searches his pockets and only comes up with three dollars. Of course, the cheapest piece of food cost four dollars. Dean sighs. Guess just a coffee will have to do today.
Dean's head snaps in the direction of the voice, finding another man sitting at the same table as him. He's wearing a full on chain mail, brown hair tousled by the metal helmet that is now sitting on the table next to him. His scruff is just long enough to be called a beard, highlighting a strong jaw and high cheekbones. He looks rugged and handsome and his eyes are right on Cas.
"What the fuck am I doing?" Dean despairs to himself, letting his head drop back on the ground a little too brusquely. He hits it a few more times for good measure, wondering if that might put his thoughts in order.
The other dog, Rufus, is an old grump that would rather sulk outside and pee on everything than come anywhere near Dean. Daisy is the opposite. As soon as she realized that he'd passed from 'intruder: must maim' to 'friend', she'd started begging him to be cuddled and petted. Bobby thinks Dean shouldn't give her any of those because she's a guard dog, not a pet. But how is he supposed to resist those big brown eyes? It took about four seconds of Daisy whining in front of the door on the second night before Dean discreetly let her inside. Since Bobby had specifically forbidden it, Dean had hushed her out back outside at dawn before Bobby woke up, but as soon as the old man opened the door, she ran straight back to the couch to cuddle right back to Dean. Bobby ribbed him a new one about spoiling her and him being one guard dog down at night because of it. The old man was the one to give up a few hours later though, when Dean looked about as miserable as Daisy sounded as she cried from outside. She hasn't left Dean's side since then, cuddling to him on the couch and watching him work all day. Dean has never been a dog person, but she's good company, even if she tends to wake him in the middle of the night by licking his damn feet.
"No listen, Cas, you-" In his haste to reassure Cas, Dean reflexively starts to get up. A cold breeze on his lower stomach suddenly reminds him of his state of undress. Eyes going wide in realization, he immediately let himself fall right back into the water. His feet skid under the water, making him fall on his ass and go under. He emerges back a second later, spitting out some water, arms flailing as he grabs the edge of the tub to stabilize himself. Once he's finally sitting straight again and has found his breath, he looks up, sheepish. Castiel is gaping at him, eyes round. "Is there any chance that you didn't see that?"
He's still scowling at the box when his doorbell rings. Dean jumps to his feet, relieved that he has an excuse to delay this Ikea hell.
"I-Yeah-I-Actually, do you think we could possibly cut our lunch short? I am indeed feeling quite unwell."
“I’ll take bath duty tonight,” Dean defends. They both know Cas could use Grace to clean Jimmy off, but Dean is still trying to make amends after the scolding he took from an angry angel daddy when Dean jokingly tried to show Jimmy how to clean out a gun and the baby swallowed a salt bullet whole. That was not a fun time. For anyone. “It looks nice, though, right?” the hunter tries to divert the attention.
Once again, he hasn't seen him coming and he jumps at the sound of his voice. At least this time, the guy doesn’t invite himself inside his house. Dean has just spent the afternoon mowing and tending to his front lawn. Now the sun is setting on the horizon. He's stiff and sunburnt and not in the mood to entertain his crazy neighbor.
He has Sam, and he is hunting. That has been enough for the last sixteen months and it will have to be enough until the day some monster finally ganks him. Dean isn’t risking anything else,
"Now stop trying to bullshit me and answer me honestly," the man continues, his tone somehow gentler, "if I throw you out right now, do you have anywhere to go?"
“Come on, let’s get bonded and get our son back,” Dean invites, impatient to get on with it. “Which is a sentence that I never thought I would say, by the way,” he jokes, blushing a little as Cas lays next to him and takes his hand.
The sun is already long gone when Cas looks at the time and realizes dinner will be in half an hour. He snuggles a little deeper against Dean for a second, moaning about having to move and go take a shower.
Dean shoves the last three raspberries in his mouth (they’re really really good) as he turns back to the other man.
Jimmy seems intrigued by the new object, walking on all four to him before grabbing his pants to get up. Cas crutches down to show him the lamp and the baby immediately grabs it, hugging it to his chest with a squeal. It seems like Cas isn’t the only fan of bees in the family.
“I didn’t realize this would be a problem for you. I heard about some of your affairs with people you didn’t know beforehand. I’m pretty sure some of them were virgins too,” Cas explains.
The trail is easy enough, not as steep as Dean was expecting. Only the toddlers stayed with one of the nannies, the four oldest coming with them for the day. They run all around for the first mile, then start dragging their feet and complaining, so Dean tries to distract them by inventing games to play on the way.
He's not sure what it means until one day Bobby comes back with a car in tow and asks him to help him with the repairs. So far, all Dean did was cleaning and house repair stuff, he's never touched any cars outside of his Baby, because that's Bobby's work.
“Ba!” Jimmy declares, trying to get up again by holding onto Dean’s arm, a look of determination scrunching his cute little face.
"Wait, wait, wait," Dean says uncontrollably. His heart is suddenly beating in a panic, all his muscles coiled with the need to get away, even though they wanted nothing more than to get closer mere seconds ago. Cas kneels and backs up to leave him some space as Dean sits up against the headboard. "I-I don't think I'm ready for...For that," Dean stutters, surprised at the violence of his own reaction. The reassuring hand Cas puts on one of his knees makes him want to curl up more, but he forces his legs to stay straight on the bed.
The taste of Cas is more and more heady in his mouth, Cas' voice more hoarse and the hand in his hair starting to pull a little more. Dean can feel his partner is close and it's making his own balls draw up in anticipation, his own hips bucking more widely.
In the last few days I've been working on a prequel about Castiel's (and Jack's) past and it's now complete. It's about 22k and will be posted after the end of this fic. I hope it'll answer some of your questions and that you're intrigued enough to want to read about how Jimmy became Castiel^^
He's not sure how he ends up sitting on the front step or how long he stays there. He didn't even notice the dog cuddling against him or the cold seeping through his pores. All he can think about is how much he misses Castiel. It feels like there is a hole inside of him that only Cas' presence can fill. It makes him wonder if he'll feel like that for the rest of his life. He's already spent so much more time without Cas that he ever did with him. They've only known each other for a handful of days, after all.
It's unavoidable, has always been really. All Dean can do is hold his chin high, and look straight at them as he waits for the hits to come.
"A car isn't meant to do all that!" Dean says, gesturing at the car all around them. There are so many lights that he feels like he's in a cockpit.
"My mysterious husband," Dean says, rolling his eyes despite the caress he drapes along Cas' cheeks.
“What? No! It’s not like that,” Dean protests, sending a glare of annoyance to his brother before he turns back to the counter. He starts peeling potatoes, perhaps a little too aggressively.
"Cas," he whines. He doesn't have more words in himself right now, frustration and desire blocking them in his throat. He gasps when a hand suddenly squeezes his dick, his hips ramming forward into the touch so violently that water slouches over the edge of the tub and falls in a loud splash on the ground around them. "Cas," he repeats. He feels lost between the need to rub back against Cas' cock or forward into his hand.
Dean thinks about it for a second. "I honestly don't think I would have. I'd have endured your mother for half a stale sandwich at that point."
Dean closes the lid over that damn trash so hard that he can see Charlie startle. He takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself, but his heart is still pounding.
Despite trying to be careful, Cas startles awake when Dean slips under the covers. The other man raises his head, blinking and grimacing against the light. He groans when he notices Dean watching him from under the covers.
It feels weirdly domestic as they spend a few minutes brushing up before spitting into the sink. Dean finishes first and hover nervously a step behind Cas, feigning interest in the collection of products on the shelf nearby. He raises an eyebrow at a particular bottle.
Castiel should feel relieved that they’re both locked up. He isn’t. He doesn't feel safer, can’t even believe it’s truly over until one day Miss Barnes, Jody and agent Henrikson talk with him for a whole afternoon.
“It’s okay. I can do it,” Cas reassures, like he always does. It’s automatic by now. He doesn’t think she believes him, but he still feels better with the lie than the silence. The truth is not conceivable.
He does it as fast as he can, still not sure if that baby is actually a monster that could bite his hand off. He didn’t when Dean carried him from the Impala to the room, at arm's length just in case, but you never know. The baby doesn’t seem to care about the sock, babbling as he grabs his foot again and tries to shove it in his mouth instead. He ends up falling on his back. He rolls to the side and gets up on all fours, making a few steps toward the edge.
People should know that his mother isn’t a monster, that he and his twin brother were just normal kids. The circumstances they grew up in were strange, but
is even doing. He's sweating and still panicking a little, yet every fiber of his being is telling him that it's the right thing to do.
“Yeah, I know why you’re saying that you little scoundrel, but well played, go on up, you can have another patty,” Bobby teases, pushing the plate of burgers toward Sam who grin and shake a fist in victory. “He’s the smartest of the lot, this one,” Bobby says proudly.
Sam releases Cas who looks a little red from having been smothered against the giant moose that is Dean’s brother. Dean still isn’t used to seeing his friend looking so naked. Well, not naked-naked. But Cas without his trenchcoat, wearing only jeans and a hoodie is basically Cas being naked. He looks so much smaller like this, frailer than even the last time Dean saw him at the Gas n Sip and that makes him frown.
Castiel wonders what will happen to Inias now that he’s out of Heaven. He’s only two years older than him, and doesn’t have a Jody in his life. He realizes Inias is eighteen, so he may go to jail.
He's just spent twelve years working under a guy that would give his 'opinion' on every single choice Dean would make. Zachariah Adler was a controlling freak that got off on bossing people around. Dean once lost a big client to one of his colleagues because Zach didn't think someone who would buy a shirt that ugly could be trusted with such an important client. He had to give up….Nope. No. He's not thinking about it. His Vittsjö table is waiting for him...or whatever it's called.
"No offense, but I'm more worried about the dogs," he says, sending a worried look to one of the dogs who seems even closer than a minute ago, teeth still barred.
He misses his condo. And his cleaning lady. They were both paid by Sandover Bridge & Iron though, so his little 'identity crisis' ended up not only costing him his job, but also rendered him homeless. And car-less. And pretty much everything-less.
“But how?” Sam asks, making Castiel realize that he was mumbling to himself as he searched through the book. He looks up to see the three angels and Sam right here in the room with him.
“Don’t test me, son,” Bobby warns. “You’ll get that stubborn ass of yours back into that god damn team until you get that scholarship.”
He looks around the little entry and messy living room. It's configured just as his house, yet doesn't look anything like it. There's a green couch in the middle of the living room with two mismatched armchairs and a coffee table looking like it's been painted by Jack (hazardly and with too many colors). A few piles of books that look like they are on the verge of tipping over, as well as toys, are scattered everywhere. An arched wall leads to a kitchen full of cabinets as blue as the outside walls of the house. A beaded curtain is hanging from the door Castiel disappeared through.
“Oh come on, my car,” Dean moans in despair. A second later he yelps briefly in pain, making Cas glance up in alarm. Dean is rubbing the back of his head with a pained grimace, sending a reproaching look in Bobby’s direction.
“You don’t have enough space for all of us out here, and I ain’t sleeping on your crappy couch. You just watch over him. I’ve seen my share of that at the Roadhouse, he’ll be fine,” Bobby dismissed, already getting his car keys out of his pocket.
“I...actually have no idea how to decorate anything to be honest," Cas admits with a grimace. “I think Sam’s been working on a list of things I need. He told me I need an...Ekea?”
They sip at wines for a while and have pompous talks about vintage and grape harvest and such. Dean can't really see the difference between this wine or any others, but he nods along and lets the alcohol warm his stomach. He bids his time until he sees the opportunity to kidnap Castiel, and they end up making out between two rows of wine barrels.
In about two hours, he’s discovered that he had a son, just to lose him almost immediately. He had gotten Castiel back and now...now he’s probably lost him again. The simple idea that he could have lost Sam too...He can’t calm down, can’t bury it. Not this time. Not right now.
“I didn’t ask. Was it impolite not to do so?” Cas worries. “I should probably know so I can inform myself on the rules of the game beforehand. Maybe learn a few key points of the game's history to be able to hold a conversation on the subject.” Cas reflects out loud.
It releases some of the tension in the room. Even Rariel nods in what looks like acceptance, probably realizing that they won’t change their minds. He may be against the idea, but Castiel knows he’s loyal to him. He’s just always been cautious, and tends to be the voice of reason.
Dean stops dead in his tracks when he enters the kitchen. Sam is standing in the middle of the room, back to Dean and his arms engulfing someone. All Dean can see of the other person is a dark tuft of hair picking out over Sam’s shoulder, but he would recognize that mop anywhere.
Cas opens his mouth like he wants to answer before he shakes his head instead. "Nevermind. It doesn't concern you."
Dean startles, realizing that Jack isn't next to him anymore. Castiel is walking around the room, one arm dangling from a shirt as he seems to be looking around and trying to put it on at the same time.
“If anyone could ever kick you back to sanity, it was her,” Dean breathes in a whisper, more to himself than to Cas. His eyes get huge when he realizes what he said. “Oh shit, sorry, that was-”
“Yeah, pretty exciting,” Dean says dryly, moving his head so he can keep reading his laptop’s screen over the kid’s head. The baby suddenly throws himself backward, headbutting the hunter in the chin, making him wince in pain.
Of course, Dean would love to be pampered with warm clothes and gifts, but he's also a stubborn bastard and he won't go back on his 'no dressing up' rule. It starts with a pair of gloves, and then Cas will be trying to buy him a nice suit so he fits in, and brings him to a hairdresser for a much proper haircut or something. Okay, maybe not a haircut, Dean thinks, eyeing Cas' perpetual bed hair. Still, he can't become complacent. He's not a kept man and doesn't need a sugar daddy. He has clothes. Not many, but enough. Fuck anyone that says it's not enough.
They stay like this for a moment before the Wave suddenly starts to move with urgency again, pulling on Dean until he slides into a new breach.
okay,” Castiel says firmly, staring hard at the other boy. “I can’t account for other people’s acts, but it was no way to treat you. I used you in ways that were unacceptable, for my own reasons, and you deserved better.”
"Yeah, I did. Lucifer had quite a ridiculous fall and ended up spitting snow," he says with a cheeky smile.
Dean hurries to take it from his hands. He turns around for two seconds to put it away and Jack is already starting to climb on the half-built structure.
It’s the most terrifying feeling, it’s nothing and everything, nil and infinity at the same time. If he had lungs he would be panting, but he has no lungs no legs no heart. The silence is encompassing without the constant beating of his heart in the background.
This makes him realize that there are about a dozen other people in that garden, most of them women in tight clothes. Damn, he would have loved to see how bendy the blonde in the front was. Or the brunette on the right. Yeah, they would have looked better than his
Castiel can feel his own smile starting to crumble, but forces it right back up. He passes the pad of his thumb over Dean's lips until they start to turn up at the corner.
"Don't push it," Dean says. He presses his mouth against Cas' smirk. It's chaste and short, yet leaves them both a little breathless anyway.
Dean grunts when Cas sits on the side of the bed to take off his shoes. It makes the mattress move and brush against his swollen stomach. Why is he still wearing pants anyway? He slides a hand under himself to undo the buttons on his jeans and groans in relief when the pressure on his stomach is finally released. He starts squirming to try and shimmy out of his pants altogether.
Castiel still manages to gather piles and piles of files that he prints until his printer runs out of ink. He ends up on the ground, probably looking like a madman surrounded by papers covered in multi colored markers. He hasn’t slept in more than thirty hours when he finally notices a line of numbers that don't add up. He passes a hand through his hair that is already sticking up every which way as it starts to make sense.
Cas is woken up a moment later by someone grabbing his shoulders and shaking him. He opens his eyes to an orange blur.
. They're only controlling your life because you're letting them, Cas. If they loved you enough to give up on all this before, then they'll love you enough to let you be happy on your own terms," Dean explains. "So yeah, maybe they're not the assholes I thought they were, but you don't owe them shit for doing the decent thing and sticking by you."
Thankfully, Charlie and Jo choose this moment to appear, because Dean is looking at him like the fact that he was alien would actually explain everything about Castiel. Cas already had this debate with Charlie. He won’t try to argue that he’s not actually from outer space for a whole hour, not again.
Dean is three seconds away from going to watch an episode with Jack right now if that means he'll stop making this sad puppy face. This kid has him so whipped it's not even funny.
Jack is shoving waffle's bits in his mouth while he hums a song and makes his toy dinosaur dance to it. He looks a little pale, dark circles surrounding his eyes.
Dean shrugs, feigning being very concentrated in showing one of the portraits on the wall to the kid who does look fascinated by it.
“No!” Charlie screams, jumping off the bed and putting herself in front of the desk, arms spread like Cas already has the matches in his hand. Castiel looks at her like she’s mad and her shoulders drop like she may be disappointed that he’s
To be honest, Dean isn’t even sure he still has a phone. He probably ditched it when he left the bunker that night more than sixteen months ago. Dean still can’t quite believe that he already knew that he was carrying Dean’s child at time and said nothing. He’s still furious about that, hasn’t even had time to fully process it yet. He’s never felt more betrayed than by the fact that Castiel would hide something so important from him.
The other man is lying on his stomach, one knee bent to the side. His arms are hugging the pillow under his face, mouth slightly opened and letting out a soft snore.
"What?" Castiel can't help but bark. "But y-your work thing?" he tries, sweating. The round panic eyes are back. Dean sends him his best shit eating grin. They both know he now either has to invite this stranger to lunch or reveal the lie to his mother. The guy is trapped and may as well continue to play along.
It gives Castiel hope that maybe there is a future for him in this typical life, surrounded by friends.
Cas closes his eyes, chest tight as Sam shakes his head with an air of defeat. They’ve been trying the spell again and again for nearly forty minutes now, frustration and desperation growing at each failure. They can’t track Tamiel. Which means they can’t find Jimmy either.
Dean moans in frustration and lets himself fall back to his side of the bed, dramatically pushing Cas' face away with one hand. Cas chuckles, lightly biting the fingers on his face until Dean takes them away.
When he starts to move, it's barely an inch at a time, careful and unhurried. Impatient, Castiel is trying to urge him on. His hands are on Dean's ass, trying to push and make him move faster. Dean resists, tutting the other man when he grunts his frustration and staying in control of the pace.
"Yeah. Good thing you're still the best person I've ever met," Dean breathes when Cas sucks on his earlobe.
Cas inhales sharply when he hears Dean say ‘our son’. It makes his heart beat unnecessary fast in his chest.
Still, would it have been like this for them if their mother hadn't died in that fire? If John hadn't stopped talking to the whole Campbell family? Dean knows he has a few cousins, and as far as he knows, his grandparents are still alive. It's too late now, but was there ever a chance for them to be as close as Castiel's family seem to be?
Dean only shrugs in answer, trying to dry his hair. He can barely lift his arms and it's useless anyway. What good is dry hair when everything else is soaked? He drops the towel on the table and opens the zipper of his coat. He struggles to do it because there is no sensation left in his fingers, the skin numb and yet burning at the same time. The dog jumps forward with a bark when he slides a hand to his inside pocket, making Dean startle so violently he nearly falls off his chair.
Dean can't help but feel like a fraud. No matter their flaws, the Novak family has welcomed him into their ranks. Hannah's words keep turning inside his head. Castiel is a gentle soul. Surely he deserves better than this whole masquerade. He deserves to meet someone real. He deserves to introduce his real boyfriend to his family and live all those first times with him. Dean shouldn't be here and spoiling it all with a lie. They're opening their arms (barely, but still) to him, who knows if they will do the same to Castiel's next partner? Who's to say that their bad experience with Dean won't impact their behavior toward Cas' future
Despite his friends’ help, the other students all fall silent or whisper when they see him, looking at him with various degrees of trepidation, pity and horror.
“You know,” Cas reflects. “‘Dada’ is the name of a nihilistic artistic movement of the early 20th century founded on principles of irrationality, incongruity and irreverence toward accepted aesthetic criteria,” Cas explains. “Are you...Dean, are you
She wasn’t much older than he was now when she had him and Jimmy. She didn’t choose to have them, not in a way that matters, but she was there to wipe their tears and tuck them in like any other mom.
Cas was obviously innocently resting on his stomach before sleeping-Dean decided to slide all over him and hug him to his chest like a freaking teddy bear. Dean can't even blame Cas for their actual situation.
Castiel watches Dean masturbate without Dean's knowledge. Dean is wearing a tee-shirt and his underwear, and masturbate with his hand under it. Castiel does not touch himself while watching and immediately feels immensely guilty.  It does not alleviate the non-con side of it at all, but it's not done in a 'pervy' way, more in a 'oh my god I can't bring myself to stop watching this'. This scene is written from Dean's side, we don't have Castiel POV during the act. This consent issue will be dealt with in another chapter.
Cas takes a second to try and calm himself before following him inside. He had no idea this would be so stressful. It’s just sex. He’s informed himself on how to do it properly. He even experimented with some things on himself. He feels he has enough knowledge to be able to do it properly. It shouldn’t be different to passing any other test he’s prepared for.
"Believe me, monsters hate cherry. As soon as they'll smell it on you, they'll run away," Dean insists.
When he enters, Dean is gulping down water straight from a bottle in front of the fridge and Castiel can feel his heart picking up speed as he looks at the jock’s Adam apple bob rhythmically. He has a very long neck. It’s both naturally tanned and freckled, which is rare and strangely attractive. Dean catches him looking and sends him a coy smile, moisturizing his lips with his tongue in a move that Castiel can’t help but stare at. The jock grabs another bottle, and extends it to him.
Cas rolls his eyes. "To my knowledge, I don't have any unusual sexual inclination. Although, I've never had much chance to explore that," Cas admits. "I was hoping we'd get to do that together."
They both stay silent for a minute. Dean may have hated it at first, but now he's not eager to quit the warm seat of the Tesla to go sleep on the cold backseat of the Impala. His baby will always be number one in his heart and he still thinks this car is ridiculous, but it's the middle of November already and he's not looking forward to freezing his ass off. Especially after a night spent mingling with High Society. Just thinking of the contrast is giving him whiplash.
The guy is wearing a black three piece suit over a white shirt. An honest to god gold pocket watch is hanging from his vest's pocket. His sickly white skin and hollowed cheeks are a sharp contrast to the dark skin and plump lips of the woman hanging at his arms. She's wearing a bright red lipstick and a black leather low cut dress that shows off her plump physique in a way that Dean definitely appreciates. He must look a little too long, because Castiel pulls slightly on his hand to bring him back to earth.
“You never want to talk about it, Castiel. You always dance around the subject, but never talk directly about it.
“You think you could find him with that old thing?” Dean says, pointing to the bunker old security system. He pushes down the hope that flares, not daring to believe yet.
"But-" Claire starts to protest, trying to grab back her stick, but Dean is keeping it out of her reach.
"Well, you're sexy and I'm surprised," Dean ponders gently. He raises the sheet in invitation, "Come in."
He doesn’t get any sweets, he’s just shoved in the back of a car with his head on Charlie’s knees. He’s okay with that.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m coming, Sammy, give me a sec!” Dean protests. The little boy rolls his eyes but drops Dean’s arm and goes back to the living room. “Keep me a spot on the couch!” Dean yells after him.
Sam indicates the corridor that leads to the bedrooms with a shrug and Dean starts into that direction.
Naomi, Lucifer and the rest of Cas' family and friends are gonna be a challenge as well. There are many challenges to come. It doesn't matter though, he'll do what he has to do to earn his place with Cas, to be good enough for him. They still barely know each other, but he can feel it, he
Dean's eyes are stuck onto the file in Cas' hands, miles going a mile a minute and heart beating so hard it's all he can hear in his ears. Cas hands him the papers slowly, like he's not sure if he should or if Dean wants it.
“Yeah I know,” Dean answers absentmindedly, sighing. He huffs when the kid puts a knee on his stomach, deciding to walk on him now. He holds him by the hip as he crawls and jumps up a little. Dean doesn’t remember caring for Sam when he was this young, having been so young himself, but he’s surprised that his instincts are still there as he secures the kid’s position, letting him raise up almost to his feet before he immediately falls back. “I’m not sure you’re ready for walking yet, buddy.”
"Your master is a weird dude," he says to the dog. Daisy inclines her head in a way that reminds him a little too much of Castiel, so Dean pushes the rest of his meal away and goes to bed.
"I'll give you a hundred dollars if you pretend to be my boyfriend." comes a hoarse voice, way too close to his ear.
Okay, maybe he answered that a little too fast. And a little too loud. Judging by Sam’s raised eyebrow, the younger man is not convinced.
“Sam should be ready for the spell now, we should go,” he announces. He hesitates a second before offering his hand to Cas. The angel hesitates just as long before taking it as he stands up. “Don’t go all asshole again, okay? If you need to hug it out, or cry it out or whatever, you tell me and we take five,” Dean proposes, blushing a little because he didn’t mean to add the ‘we’ part. Cas nods anyway, seeming relieved and grateful.
“I shouldn’t have trusted you,” he murmurs, finally turning to Dean. The hunter is crouched next to his brother, a hand on his shoulder to stabilize him as Sam grabs onto him, taking huge gulps of air. “Two weeks,” Cas gasps, eyes lost on the wall a few feet above their heads. “It took only two weeks knowing you for him to be taken away from me.”
"Sammy searched for me?" he asks, voice strangled. He turns to the next page and it's the same picture from what looks like another website, and then another one.
“I can’t wait to see that pad of yours. Wait, you’re not going to decorate it with Crosses and other Jesus’ crap, right?”
Jody and Bobby have a blast when he tells them about his worries. They laugh so much that Jody has to run to the toilets to pee, and Bobby has a coughing fit.
"Oh come on. How hard can it be? You're rich, objectively good looking. Do you have weird kinks or something?"
Check out the end notes for the WARNINGS. This chapter contains dubcon and forced exhibitionnism, as well as voyeurism.
Cas is back to using his massage parlor after a few days, but the rest of the house will need a few weeks of work before it's inhabitable again. They need to change the kitchen and remake the living room, as well as fix the electricity on the whole ground floor.
Cas moans in pain. Dean looks at him just in time to see a canine bites into the cut, making it bleed again.
“Not always, but sometimes I think I should,” Cas reflects, “Charlie does it too, but she’s always scared to push too hard. Jo doesn’t give a fuck.”
The bartender slides the compress of ice under his head. Dean had closed his eyes, already falling asleep when a hand on his backside startles him. He tries to raise up, but the move is too sudden and he ends up barfing on the ground instead.
Dean doesn't waste any time obeying him, swinging them to the side until Cas is under him, legs wrapped around his hips. Dean guides his dick and
“I was wrong. And I’m an idiot," Dean assures, searching until he finally meets the other man’s gaze. Cas’s pupils are slightly dilated and his cheeks are pink, hair in disarray from the way he’d massaged the back of his head. He’s never looked more beautiful. This time, Dean can’t help it, he raises one of his hands to run it through the other man’s hair.
To Dean's surprise, he turns around and starts walking. The dogs instantly relax and go running upfront. Dean watches them go, dazed.
"Dean," Castiel calls again, one of his legs wrapping around Dean's hips until he can pull him closer between his spread legs. This time, Dean lets him, pressing his hips in the gap between Cas' thighs.
"I doubt you even make it off of that stool after everything you've had, cher," Benny sighs, shaking his head.
"The day I met Castiel, I had about forty cents to my name. I was living in my car and buying pants felt like a luxury I couldn't afford."
He squeezes his hand a little harder, moves it a little faster in rhythm with the thrusts of Dean into his mouth. He can feel the head of Dean’s cock bumping against the back of his throat every few thrusts and with a little surge of grace he erases the slight discomfort it brings. The hunter must feel it somehow, because he pushes deeper with a broken cry. He rests there for a few moments, looking down in amazement at Cas, his cock buried in the angel’s throat.
Despite himself, Cas has grown fond of the man, he’ll admit it. To Dean though, Castiel Novak is still the asshole boss making harassing demands that he doesn’t see the point of.
an attractive eater, Castiel isn’t even sure how he made a piece that big fit into his mouth in the first place. Or
Dean only realizes he's not breathing anymore when a hand touches his cheek makes him gasp in surprise. Jack is kneeling next to him. His little hands grab Dean's cheeks and squeeze them until Dean's mouth pucker up. The kid looks him right in the eyes, eyebrows furrowed as he inspects Dean. Then he leans forward until his forehead is pressed against Dean's, little arms wrapping around the adult's neck. The kid stays there, blowing sweet smelling air on Dean's cheek as he calmly breathes in and out. Dean pats the back of his head and closes his eyes, listening to the kid's breath, concentrating on the feeling of it against his cheek until his heart starts to calm down.
"Such a good boy, Dean. You're so good at this, you feel so good," Cas is babbling nonsense, head thrown back and hand caressing Dean's hair.
“I know you do, Jody,” he affirms and it sounds like a pardon. Maybe it is, God knows she only ever tries to help him. From the moment Jody found him surrounded by dead bodies, put a useless hand on his eyes and her jacket on his shoulders, all she ever did was try to protect him, to help him. “You always do,” he admits, trying to smile. He’s not sure he succeeds, but she seems touched anyway.
Dean extends a hand in invitation and Cas takes it as he slides onto Dean's lap. They exchange a kiss, so languorous that Dean's heart starts to beat faster again, but for a very good reason this time. His hard on, that had started to flag when he freaked out, is starting to come back with enthusiasm.
jealousy, it's the knowledge that Cas may very well choose one of these people ogling him today, that Dean may turn around at some point, just to see Cas go inside, hand in hand with one of those hot wenches or knights. It's not the jealousy that surprises him, but the hurt that idea makes him feel. The way his eyes and nose are burning just thinking about it.
The vampires have obviously been gone for a long time, and they go back home with their metaphorical tail between their legs.
going to try to fight her for the manuscript. “Damn, that was the perfect opportunity to make my Gandalf impression!” she despairs with a teasing smile.
Suddenly, there is beer and a barbecue with giant turkey legs starting to roast. Even the kid castle that Dean has built as a gift for Jack has been invaded, a clan of people dressed as Vikings sitting on the ground inside, squeezed together and clinking their beer glasses like they've just found the coolest bar around. It looks more like some kind of medieval festival than a kid's birthday party, but Jack doesn't seem to mind. He looks at everything and everyone in awe, before he announces that he needs to put on a costume too.
Dean follows the sound to the neighbor's lawn where a man has appeared and is stomping toward them. Dean raises an eyebrow. The guy has the worst bed hair that Dean has ever seen, along with an unruly scruff over his cheeks, but most importantly, he's only wearing a dark blue bathrobe. Well, Dean hopes he's not
He seems satisfied when he finds none, taking a step back. Cas can’t help but shiver when the fresh air takes over the space where Dean’s body was just pressed against him. He can’t seem to make his fists release the grip they have on the front of Dean’s shirt.
Jody puts herself between them, stepping in front of Dean and putting her fingers on his chin until he stops glaring at Bobby and looks at her. "Do you want to talk about it?" she asks gently.
"I wonder this every single day," Castiel sighs, miming despair despite the amused smile at the corner of his lips.
The muscle stretches easily as they continue to kiss, Castiel's hips following the rhythm of Dean's fingers, sliding up and down on his lap. When Dean adds a third finger, Cas pushes his mouth away with a whimper, taking big gulps of breath, hips trembling. Dean's mouth latches onto his throat instead, at the line just under the scruff of his beard, nibbling to stop himself from biting into the flesh.
“Okay, Cas, I have good news and bad news. Good news is, I found a very cute way to ask you to marry me. Bad news is, our son ate the ring.”
They arrive at the resort just as the sun is setting down...which isn't that late in November. Everyone gets inside, but Dean holds Cas back. The view is beautiful and they're going home tomorrow morning, Dean wants to enjoy it a little longer.
Dean bites his lips, eyes dropping to his plate to try and hide the surge of emotion the thought brings him. They should be, should they? Sam and him should be inseparable. They would be if Dean hadn't screwed up and chased his brother away.
He jumps when Pamela touches his arm, and looks at her with round eyes. She draws Castiel’s hand back from his head. When he looks down there’s a tuft of hair in his hand.
Cas licks his lips, his eyes grazing Dean’s collar as he nods. It feels like a lie Dean can’t refuse.
a coward, Charlie. But I won't take that kind of risk. Not with Cas, and certainly not with Jack." When he stops talking, he's out of breath, nearly panting.
The kid doesn't answer. He's frowning in concentration as he struggles not to overthrow the huge glass he's holding. He manages pretty well until he arrives near Dean and gets a little too excited over his success, pushing the glass toward Dean a little too enthusiastically. A big splash of lemonade ends up half over Dean's lap, half over the floor.
He doesn’t like Meg. He doesn’t hate her because Castiel doesn’t really have it in himself to hate anyone. But he really, really doesn’t like Meg. He’s not even sure why she’s still having lunch with them, when they formally voted to not allow her to sit at their lunch table anymore, at his demand. But she keeps appearing everywhere they go, and sitting down with them. It’s very irritating.
They stare at each other for what feels like a long moment until Jody intervenes, "Oh Golly, look at that, I think you were right Dean, this car isn't in infraction after all!" The look Dean gives her clearly states that he's not buying her bullshit. Bobby must have told her about Castiel, probably told her about his car too. This has all the signs of a set up. "Nevermind. I should go. I have law to enforce and all that," Jody says, starting to walk away backward as she looks from Cas to him. She gives Dean some kind of head sign toward the other man and he rolls his eyes. "See you later!" With that, she turns around and rushes straight to her car that is parked a few spaces further down the road. Dean doesn't miss the fact that she doesn't turn the car on, nor leaves. She's probably already calling her partner in crime to gossip.
Surprisingly, Dean blushes at the question, turning back toward the wall with a shrug. “I just had it around,” he deflects, resuming painting the wall.
It’s a little weird having so many people in his bedroom. Not as weird as the fact that he’s going to go incorporeal and fly right into Cas’ arms in a few minutes to merge with him or whatever. But still weird.
Castiel sits there and looks at it for hours; this pile of paper full of scratches and the perfect calligraphy that he was taught by Metatron.
“You’re sure it won’t burn out my eyes or something, right?” Dean asks, getting nervous as Sam starts lighting some candles. Why is there always so many candles during spells anyway? Is it for the ambiance or is it really necessary?
“Sam and I have managed to pinpoint the location where every angel fell three years ago. I need you to identify each vessel and cross-reference it with every angel having returned to Heaven or died since then. Fallen angels are helping Bartholemew, we need to know exactly who they are, who their vessels are and where they are right now. This is top priority, we’ll need every garrison available flying all over the globe to check every vessel in person, is that clear?”
He doesn’t know how to do it. He tries to bring back the same memory, the moment Cas left him and went back to Heaven. He can feel the breach of the memory opening, but the Wave doesn’t seem interested in going back there, it just stays curl around Dean, gently floating to the sound of Cas humming to baby Jimmy in the background. This memory is peaceful and tender and yet somehow Dean can’t stand to be here any longer. He feels a surge of sadness and the Wave pokes at him in askance.
Castiel continues to mumble grumpily to himself as he twists and wriggles until he's under the blankets with Dean.
She blushes a little at the compliment, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. "You don't look too bad yourself," she adds, tugging lightly on his dark blue tie.
were the one that hurt him. He’s been hunted and has fought angels more than against demons at this point. She brainwashed him, manipulated him.
Dean nods, releasing Cas’s hand when he realizes he’s still holding it. The angel's worried eyes on him makes him wonder if he did hear Dean’s (mostly involuntary) prayers.
"Oh yeah, keep talking dirty to me," Cas intices, rolling on his side and sliding closer to Dean, one leg covering his.
He gets why Hannah didn't bring them all to the park. Claire was an angel compared to Lucifer's kids. He's pretty sure that the ten year old named Crowley tried to lift his wallet, and Ruby spent the whole meal telling them about the dead bird she found, in excruciating detail. Michael's twins were a little better, mostly because they were still toddlers, so they didn't do much except laugh and slobber on everything. Still, Dean had a new found respect for the poor nannies that have to take care of the kids while their parents went to have a good time skiing.
"It's not keeping secrets if no one asks you about it," Cas corrects. "I do not blame you for not telling me about your past, Dean. On the contrary, I feel like I should be the one telling you about mine," he says. Dean is on the verge to protest, Cas doesn't owe him anything after all, but Cas' eyes soften as he leans his head a little forward and Dean can't resist those eyes. "Would you let me tell you my story?"
"And she knows I'm right and is waiting for Gabriel to finally admit he's an idiot," Michael insists, petulant.
He looks disheveled and grumpy, closing his eyes again with a groan and burying his face under Dean's chin. Despite his attitude, his leg wrap around Dean's hips, squeezing him closer and Dean notices that there's a part of Cas that is definitely waking up.
Dean watches the muscles of his naked back move as his neighbor straightens up and raises his hands above his head. Dean gulps, and forces himself to look away.
Finally naked, Cas falls between his legs. Dean isn't sure what instinct makes him spread them so wantonly, but he can't regret it when it brings Cas that much closer. Close enough that their dicks align perfectly against one another in a delicious slide that makes them both moan. Dean thrusts up, exploring the sensation and makes a noise that Cas stifles with his mouth.
"Something," Dean breathes, voice tight. He folds the paper and puts it face down on the table. "I have work to do," he says absentmindedly, hurrying out of the room.
Sometimes he goes back to looking at them, but he doesn’t dare read them, can’t even bring himself to touch the paper again.
The other man comes with a long moan that makes Dean grind deeper inside him. Dean squeezes Cas' hips harder, biting his own lips as he tries to starve off his orgasm, to resist the sharp call of pleasure Cas' body suddenly clenching and releasing around him is bringing him. He fights to keep his eyes open too, he doesn't want to miss a second of watching Cas come. As soon as Castiel opens his eyes, blue clouded by ecstasy, Dean is lost too, spilling into his partner's body with a shout of his name.
Dean gapes for a long moment, taken aback. Who could blame him when the weird kid that sits behind him in History class, and whom he’s shared maybe two words with in the entirety of his existence asks him something like this out of the blue?
So far, he'd always managed to get by doing repairs or cleaning at gas stops and motels. The older he gets and the harder it gets to find that kind of random job. People are more willing to give a few bucks in exchange for manual tasks to a kid than they are to a nearly thirty year old guy. Now they just tell him to fuck off.
"I think I'll take the duck today," Naomi notes. "Nobody cooks it better than chef Francis. How about you Dean? Have you ever come here before?" There is a mean glint in her eyes that says she knows perfectly well he hasn't. Hell, from the side eyes he got from everyone as they crossed the room, everyone here knows he's not from their world. There are three holes in his jeans, threads hanging from the bottom and his dad's leather jacket probably should have ended up in the trash about three years ago. Even now, it's still too big for him and the sleeves are so scruffed that they're nearly paper thin. The original dark brown color has turned to a light beige in most places from wear. Dean's scruff is just the bad side of too long now, and he hasn't had a haircut since April, strands starting to fall into his eyes. At least, he's wearing his best plaid shirt and managed to wash up last night, so he's not smelling too rank. Why would Castiel pick him out of all the people in the street at that moment to play his boyfriend? It makes no sense at all. From the guy's obvious discomfort as he hides behind his menu, he's probably starting to realize it.
He needs them to understand and if that means sacrificing another part of his own privacy, then that’s a price he’s willing to pay.
She squeezes his knee as she sits down and sends him a look, checking silently if he’s okay. He knows that as delighted as she looks at seeing what sounds like a friend from her old life, she would drive them right home without any hesitation at any sign of distress on Cas’ face.
"I don't hate you, Cas," Dean says, shocked at the idea. I could never hate you, he wants to say but doesn't. He wants to say other things that he knows he shouldn't, especially when he sees how relieved Cas appears.
"I-I wasn't sure if you would be interested, but I thought I should keep the information, just in case," Cas says carefully, watching for Dean's reaction.
To be honest, Dean can't bring himself to care about anything right now except how damn good Castiel is making him feel. Dean feels like putty against the table. Like his whole body is going to liquify and roll off the side until it ends up in a puddle on the ground.
pink. It makes Dean think of an article he read that said the head of a man's dick is the same shade of pink as his lips. It makes him desperate to find out if that's true.
Hannah wishes to wave the others off so Dean follows her to the balcony over the parking lot. Dean feels a little regret as he watches them load up the truck with skiing equipment. He's never skied before. His family wasn't exactly the type to go on winter vacations. They weren't the type to go on to any vacations, really. Which is kind of ironic since they lived in motels and spent Dean's childhood traveling all the time. It was nowhere close to vacations though. There weren't happy meals and day activities. Just two bored kids and a fucked up dad.
Dean is opening his mouth to respond when a little body tackles him, nearly making him fall from his chair.
It stops Cas for a second, makes him close his eyes and takes a deep breath that can't quite pass the ball of lies that is stuck in his throat. Two years now, and he still chokes on them sometimes. Still spend sleepless nights thinking of all that he's lost.
"We had no idea Castiel had finally found a beau. We're really happy for you, sweetheart" the woman - Billie - says with what looks like a sincere smile to her godson.
He jumps when the door suddenly opens. He looks wide eyes at Castiel, standing in the doorway of the bathroom, a frown appearing on the angel’s face as the seconds tick by and Dean says nothing. Jimmy is wrapped into a towel, light brown hair wet and sucking on his big toe. Dean stares at him, the baby just calmly blinking back. After a while, Jimmy offers him a big smile, tongue picking out a little under his front teeth. Damn, he’s seen that smile before.
“We can go slow if you-” Dean starts. His eyes are tender, his tone reassuring and Cas knows he can’t listen to it because the last thing he wants to be doing right now is saying to Dean exactly what he’s saying.
He's not expecting the shout that follows, or the kid running toward him and tackling his legs. "No!"
Dean isn't in the least surprised when he comes home to find Jody sitting in the kitchen with Bobby. They shut up as soon as they hear him approaching, obviously having been gossiping. Dean rolls his eyes as he goes to the fridge, opening a beer and sipping it slowly with his back to them. He can feel their eager stares, can hear the chair squeaking under Jody's impatient squirming as they wait for him to spill the beans. He turns, smirking in satisfaction when he sees how restless they are.
Dean looks up, but the man is already getting up, back to him as he opens the fridge. Dean doesn't know what to say, caught off guard. Somehow, he doesn't think this man is going to go into explaining why and how he's offering his shower and house to a perfect stranger. Especially not one that just committed B & E on his property. It's probably not the time to question his luck, so Dean gets up and rushes to the bathroom before the man can change his mind.
"You don't say…" Dean ignores the way the kid is looking expectantly at him, eager to watch him take a sip, and puts the glass on the ground on his other side. He's still sitting cross legged on the floor in front of his unsuccessful attempt at furniture building.
Dean’s feet are rooted to the ground, his mouth too dry to speak. What would he say anyway? I’m happy to see you? He’s not, Dean feels anything but happy. He keeps looking at this kid and wondering if that’s true, if Cas was right all along, because it really does seem like the only way for him to find happiness was to push Dean out of his life. No. Cas didn’t push, Dean knows that, yet he can’t help the anger burning in his gut every time he thinks about Cas leaving.
Castiel sighs like he's about to drop the worst news of his life. "Our annual family trip to our resort in Vermont."
“It wasn’t just a handprint, Dean. I know you can’t see it, but it left a permanent imprint on your soul as well as my Grace.”
Instead of talking more about Jimmy, Cas tells him about a young girl named Kelly that came to the church one day and revealed that she was pregnant with Nick's baby. Of course, her word didn't weigh a lot against that of the beloved leader of the congregation.
In the few occasions where Dean might have wonder about sex with another man, he thought it was all about blowjob and buttsex, but this.
Dean wants to protest, wants to keep him close, and with them. But there is a desperation in Cas’ eyes, a plea is his tone and Dean stops himself.
"You broke your left ankle about-," the guy rolls Dean's feet around for a second, "Two. Maybe three years ago."
He looks around, but there isn't anything to cover himself except bubbles. His clothes are on the bed, and he didn't think to bring a towel. He thought he would still have at least an hour before Cas came back.
Castiel wipes his sweaty hands on his pants, looking at the loading circle turning around and around as it connects him to his Monday meeting with Dean.
They go to the garden and share a lounge chair. Cas lies between Dean's legs as they watch the sun set over the lake. It's getting cold, but they keep each other warm, nestled against one another as they are. It's peaceful and all kind of perfect and Dean doesn't want to let this moment go.
She was his first friend after all. She was the one that made him realize that you didn’t have to have blue eyes and brown hair to be family. She was the first person that made him feel like a real kid, like he didn’t have to have a greater purpose.
Despite being drowsy, he squeezes against Dean's side, one hand roaming his chest in what is probably supposed to be a seductive way but is too sluggish to be more than awkward patting. Cas nuzzles into his neck, eyelids drooping. His hand tries to slip further south, but Dean takes it in his instead, holding it against his chest.
When they arrive at the resort a couple of weeks later, Dean feels like a kid at Disneyland. What they call their 'resort' is a gigantic lodge made of light woods and glass. It looks like the kind of place you only see in the movies, with legit deer heads mounted on the walls inside, and giant couches in the common room. There are fireplaces
"I shouldn't take more of your time," Cas apologizes, taking his wallet out. Dean goggles at the amount of cash in there.
"That's Emily Dickenson, you heathen," Naomi corrects, looking outraged and like she instantly regrets all that she just said.
This brings back memories of them rubbing naked against one another, of Cas saying those same words then. From the way Cas immediately looks a little flushed after saying it, he remembers too.

“We both know you’re going to look good in all of those, Dean,” Cas offers, trying to underrate the compliment with an eye roll.
Bobby groans a barely audible "idjit" as he gets up to get some more coffee, throwing the newspaper on the table. Dean takes the opportunity to steal it. He's scanning the pages, searching for the jokes and comics section, when his eyes land on a familiar face and he freezes. Bobby seems to notice his shock and look over his shoulder at the article Dean is blinking at.
"I've never seen Castiel smile quite as much as he does when he's with you," she confesses after a silence.
“I actually have two masters degrees in linguistic and theological history. Officially." Cas adds with an exaggerated wink.
"We're supposed to share this bed, you know," Castiel grumbles. He's apparently kneeling on the bed now and pushing against Dean's hip for him to move.
He goes to the kitchen to wash them while Dean contemplates the beer in his hand, trying to find the courage to ask what a normal friend would ask. He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes with a grimace and…
Dean side-eyes him in answer, glaring harder when he notices Benny is holding the envelope full of money. Cas' money.
Dean shrugs, "Just saying," he says around a mouthful of chicken. "Do you mind if I use some of your tools to check on the Impala tomorrow?"
Finding out she was alive has been a shock, but not a surprise. Naomi was clever, way too clever to let herself be killed that easily. She had kept a part of her Grace in a failsafe in Heaven growing back slowly until she was able to possess her vessel again. Not only had it saved her life, she was also able to stay in Heaven, to stay an angel as all her brothers and sisters fell to Earth. Thinking himself alone in Heaven, Metatron had been careless in protecting himself and Naomi had no difficulty capturing him. She took all the valuable knowledge from his head before she killed him. She had opened the door of Heaven back to come to earth, but hadn’t told anyone about it or Metatron’s death yet. Only Castiel.
"Look, Jack, it's the game we wanted!" she says as she releases her hold on Dean. Somehow she manages to sit herself on his other leg and Dean fumbles a little to hold them both.
"Very coherent," Castiel mocks. Dean can feel his smirk against the edge of his jaw. He doesn't even care. What Castiel is doing to him right now is giving him every right to be cocky.
Dean wants to protest, but knows better than dismissing his own accomplishment in front of her. She generally hits him when he does. Hard.
“I was thinking that we could locate an angelic energy surge to find Jimmy,” Sam explains, still a little wide eyed but going with the flow more easily than Dean.
"But it's the closest thing I've had to a home since I've been four. Nicest one too," he adds with a sip that burns his tongue. He's not trying to be provocative. Or maybe he is, he's not sure. He's just done hiding who he is to those people.
"I asked you to nod silently for ten minutes, not to do method acting for a whole meal," he reproaches. Naomi sends them a look over her shoulder and Castiel smiles at her like there is no worries, indicating for her to lead the way,
Dean moves his hips in a circle, experimenting. They make the same noise when the move makes Cas' dick slip against Dean's crack. He raises up and a little down again, exploring the sensation until Cas lets out a little whine and grabs his biceps. Dean opens his eyes. He hadn't realized he had closed them, as he focused on the novel sensation. He wants to grab Castiel's dick under the water, push him more firmly against himself and rub himself all over it until they're both out of breath. He wants to hear Castiel moan and groan and cry and scream. He wants to see what Cas looks like when he comes.
He can’t feel the rain hitting his skin, he doesn’t have skin, but he can see the droplets of water falling, and can hear the splash they make as they hit the pavement. He looks around with no eyes. It’s a dark street, illuminated only by streetlight and the reddish glow of a neon sign. He can feel the cold seeping into his bones, the hunger in the pit of his stomach.
"There is no way you could have-" Dean starts to say as he turns on the tap, finishing in a groaned "fuck me" when the water seems to flow flawlessly without any leak.
She’s right, he knows she is. Many angels are still holding Castiel as the one true ruler of Heaven, are still trusting him to guide them. And Dean...he’s the true sword for Michael, descendant of the first man, of Cain and Abel, Dean is of Heaven’s royal blood if there ever was one.
Now that’s definitely suspicious. Cas raises an eyebrow and waits. When Dean acts like this, Cas knows he shouldn’t push. Acting annoyed and being on the defensive over nothing is Dean’s way of being shy. He’s not an easy human to understand, but Cas is getting better and better at it.
On the first morning of his return to school, Jody seems nearly as stressed as he is. Less than his very first day of school ever - where he thought she was going to pass out from apoplexy when she drops him off in front of the school - but still very anxious.
Dean offers him an open mouthed smile full of crumbs in answer before turning toward his best friend. Cas doesn’t seem all there though. He’s sitting more slouched than Dean has ever seen him against the back of his chair, a frown between marring his face as he looks at the table without seeming to see it. He’s rubbing his stomach absentmindedly.
Cas has stood somehow and Dean hasn't even realized he was standing right behind him, or that his hand was on his shoulder. He looks up at him and the affection in Cas' eyes makes Dean's heart pace pick up at once.
Dean looks down at the guy, still wondering why there is a damn hippie (with a cute butt) lying on his kitchen floor. At least this time the guy is wearing clothes, even if his white t-shirt has ridden up, letting Dean see a trail of light hair that disappears under jeans that are barely covering his hips. The guy pushes a little more under the sink and his jeans ride lower, showing off the edge of what looks like pale blue lace.
Cas glares and Rariel seems to understand he should shut up. He’s not wrong though. For them to be able to bring back the fallen angel to Heaven, Naomi developed a Grace that could be injected. Every fallen angel had some Grace left and with the modified Grace's help, it could slowly grow back inside them, giving them their power back with time. That modified Grace could theoretically be injected into humans, be enough to grow on its own and turn anyone into an angel. They’ve thought about it, but never tried it. Arariel’s suggestion was smart, it could probably turn Dean into an angel, rendering him the ability to connect to Jimmy’s soul and fly to it. But him being human is the very thing that makes him able to reach Jimmy despite the wards on the collar. Yet not being able to fly makes it impossible for him to...it’s a damn vicious circle.
“Oh, Bob, I’m so sorry. You two were so great together,” Jody says sincerely, squeezing the older man’s hand on the table.
“Hey lover,” she whispers in his ear, making him shiver, not in a good way. She pouts when she notices that with Jo there, their table of four doesn’t have a chair for her. Being that it’s Meg and she’s demented, she doesn’t take a chair from another table to sit with them or goes to sit elsewhere like she must know they all wish her to. No, she decides to sit sideway on his lap, an arm around his shoulder and wriggling way too much on his crotch.
The sun is shining, the food is delicious and Dean’s leg is pressed against his, his hand regularly coming to rest casually on Cas’ thigh. Castiel has never felt so light before. He’s enjoying every second of it.
From here, he can hear the tone of her voice, but not her words. He doesn’t need to hear them to know what generally comes next. She’s fighting a fight that they all know she can’t win, probably shouldn’t win, yet she never stops trying.
Cas inclines his head, scrutinizing him. "Would you have acted any different if it was McDonald's rather than Le Délicieux?"
Dean was kind of looking forward to skiing. He watches the way the top of the mountain is covered in snow. They aren't high enough here to have some at this time of the year, but the day is sunny and the trees all around are bright with autumn colors. Dean wonders if he could get away with going on a walk without blowing his cover. The idea of coming to such a beautiful place and choosing to stay locked up in a room is way too sad. Who knows if he'll ever get the chance to see places like this ever again? He certainly never had it before and his life isn't exactly getting better those days.
. It was one of his son's first moments and he couldn’t be here. He wasn’t here for his first laugh, just like he wasn’t there for his first smile, or first tooth. He wasn’t there for his birth. He’ll never get to hold him as an infant. He didn’t get to be there for Castiel either. He wasn’t by his side when his friend was scared or in pain. Dean will never know how round Cas’ belly got. He’ll never know the feeling of his son’s kick under Cas’ skin.
“He said he had some research to do,” Sam explains calmly, eyes on his book while he sips on his coffee, obviously oblivious to Dean’s agitation.
Soon, Dean is leaning back against the siderest, Jack fast asleep on his chest, Claire squeezed between him and the edge of the couch, and his feet under Cas' thigh. Cas himself has a lap full of Ruby who has snuggled under his blanket and is fighting to keep her eyes open. Crowley has squeezed himself against the other armrest and his oncle, head dropping on Cas' shoulder as he watches his uncle Gabriel mimic some kind of monster from the armchair near the fire.
He doesn’t eat for two days after seeing Lucifer’s picture, his stomach so knotted up that he can barely stand straight.
Dean can feel how on edge Cas is, taking longer drags of smoke and adding a glass of whisky to the mix. The joint is trembling between his fingers. It's cold enough that Dean can pretend that's the reason.
At this point of the story, Cas is trying to roll another joint, his fingers trembling so much that he can't quite get it right. He stands up to get his bong and another glass of whisky instead. Dean doesn't comment. He doesn't need to be a genius to understand what is coming. He can understand why Cas needs those.
“The instructions were very clear, so as soon as we heard the signal that morning, the other kids in my dormitory didn’t even hesitate. They held hands, said a last prayer, and gulped down the poison with a beatific smile on their face, happy to rejoin our Father on another plane of existence. It was what they taught us. But when the moment came...I couldn’t. I was ten years old and watching brethren my age, sometimes younger, dying around me and found myself too terrified to do anything. My brother...Jimmy noticed. He wasn’t scared. He was the bravest person I’ve ever known,” Castiel admires, eyes suddenly burning with unshed tears. “He was always stronger than me,
Naomi gets up and, to Dean's surprise, extends a hand for Bobby to shake. "You must be Dean's employer. Naomi Novak, it's a pleasure to meet you," she says.
"Told you, the bank only allows non-idiotic withdrawals," Benny says, sidestepping him on his way to his office. He sighs when he sees the state of it. Papers are on the ground, and all the drawers are open.
“How is this so hard?” Winchester groans, obviously frustrated by his lack of baking skills. He pokes the unappetizing dish before pouting. “But I want some piiiie,” he whines.
Dean can't help but smile at the brothers' rivalry. It reminds him of his relationship with Sam. His little brother was very stubborn, and they had more than one ridiculous contest like this one. He wonders if some of them would have lasted if they were still talking those days. Sam never copped to the mysterious disappearance of Dean's favorite edition of Busty Asian Beauties after all. Thinking about this makes him feel a little maudlin, but it's hard to stay sad when the three brothers keep bantering good humoredly for the next half hour.
Dean blinks a few times as their attention turns toward him. Castiel seems to be trying to communicate something with his eyes, and Dean frowns in incomprehension for a moment before he gets the hint.
“I know.” Dean sways a little closer, knocking their shoulders together. “Now I do have a very important question for you,” he adds with a serious tone.
“Cas…” He can’t help but close his eyes for a second, because he’s not sure he wants to see what is reflected on the other man’s face anymore. He wants to say that he’s sorry but knows that he shouldn't. He takes a breath and when he opens his eyes again, Castiel has bitten his lip so hard that a trickle of blood is running down his chin. “You hurt yourself again,” Dean states, without even realizing it.
Dean grinds his jaw. That meal order is obviously an affront. Cas does sometimes order salad, that’s true. And when he does, he always orders the Greek salad with sheep cheese and olives. He generally takes a side order of fries with it. Dean suspected he does that to both appease Dean by eating something awesome, and Sam who can’t shut up about the importance of eating vegetables. He’s also a weirdo because he doesn’t actually even like olives and always ends up picking them out and putting them on Dean’s plate, which works for Dean since he loves olives, but still. He then generally puts his fries into the same plate as that weird Greek cheese Cas loves, and his salad which is just disgusting in Dean’s opinion. But see, that Greek salad goes with a whole damn ritual that he always does. Except today.
Dean may have to wait his turn to go to the bathroom in the morning, but Castiel is a pretty good cook so that's a win. Jack is still adjusting, but Dean finds it hard to blame him for being difficult. At four years old, that kid has lived through more trauma than most adults. If he wants to run around screaming wearing only a purple tutu on his head, Dean will indulge him. Anything to let him blow off some steam, it's not like it's hurting anyone.
“You know, turning anxiety into rage is generally my thing…,” Dean teases when Cas stops sobbing, sniffing miserably instead. The angel sits back, and Dean regrets having said anything.
Dean bites his lips and nods, just once. He honestly has no idea what he's doing right now. Go with the flow, was that it? His dick certainly seems interested in the idea, so he's probably heading in the right direction… provided that he should let his dick guide him, of course.
"Now, let's slowly raise up as we breathe out," the guy instructs as he unbends in a gracious movement.
"Oh god, I did it, and on the first try too, I found your weird kink!" Dean exclaims, bursting in laughter. "It's corporate dirty talk!"
Sam glares at him. They both know the case is bullshit. There haven’t been any victims in months and the monster – vampires, he thinks - has probably moved on by now. But whatever, he knows Sam will still be a good little soldier and do his work. Dean has 34 years of experience of hearing Sam complaining, so he can take it.
Dean is holding Jimmy in a baby carrier on his front. He has a paint brush covered in green paint in one hand, wall half painted in front of him. On his chest, Jimmy is waving happily a much smaller paint brush. Despite the fact that Jimmy’s brush is devoid of paint (thank God), they’re still both covered in more paint that is probably advised. It doesn’t take Cas long to notice the small handprints on the freshly painted wall and to understand why his son looks like a tiny Hulk right now. He frowns his disapproval, but can’t retain a smile in front of Dean's sheepish look.
Cas smiles fondly at him. "The night of the engagement party. I came to pick you up and you threw a fit because you hated my car," Cas smiles, like he remembers the moment fondly. "Most of the people I tried to date, their attitude always changed when they noticed the car, or the quality of my suit, or got a glance at my centurion credit card. We could have spent the most boring night, they would always perk up and suddenly become more interested in me once they realized I had money. But you, you didn't care to please me or how expensive my car was. You stayed true to your beliefs anyway."
Sam raises his hand with a grimace. “Look, I know the incident with the baboon was touch and go for a while, but I still think it’s good for Jimmy to see more of the world than this bunker,” Sam defends.
For Cas' hair, I had the haircut that Maison gave Misha during the quarantine in head. For Dean's, it started of as first quarantine Jensen's hair and ends up as something closer to Demon!Dean's hair. I'll let your imagination run wild for Jack's!
Maybe they were brave enough to drink the vial, he ponders. Inias and him never were very brave, always hiding under the covers when Jimmy used to tell them scary stories that weren’t allowed.
“What do you mean, he left?” Dean asks, trying not to raise his voice despite the panic beating in his chest.
Dean looks down at his hands. They've been dry and so cracked up they bleed every time he moves his fingers. He hadn't even realized he was scratching them right now. "Thank you," Dean says, squeezing a little cream from the tube into his palm. The cold hasn't been kind to his body recently. He's also had a cough that he can't quite shake for the last ten days.
The coffee table wasn't actually that hard to build, which kind of gave him an ego boost. Dean believed he had warmed just enough to attack the 'Hemnes' bed frame. Now it's three hours later and Dean just realized that he put the headboard on the wrong side, which means he has to start over. He feels like crying. He may have also scratched his chestnut wood flooring by hitting it one too many times in frustration with what he thinks might be one of the bed's feet. Now he's sitting on the ground, hair tousled from trying to literally tear it out and scowling at the instructions manual like it's responsible for every single thing that ever went wrong in his life.
The next kiss is more passionate, tongues sliding together. Dean pulls on Cas' elbows, making him raise and guiding him to sit on his lap, but Cas resists. He bites Dean's bottom lip instead, before taking a step back. One of his hands is still clasped in Dean's and he pulls him until Dean follows, dazed and excited as Cas leads him to what he hopes is the bedroom.
Dean stops. He's already in the living room, looking at the front door with envy. He needs to get out of here. He's exhausted and he can feel how raw his emotions are, too close to the surface for it to be safe.
He should give his resignation to Chuck right away. He tried to talk about it with his stepfather yesterday night. Well, not it
Dean is not sure how long he's been sitting on the edge of their bed, eyes lost in the vague as he processes everything that just happened, when the door opens. Cas enters just enough to close it behind his back. He looks as dazed as Dean feels, caught by the whiplash of going from a perfect day straight into a nightmare.
Cas must notice his reaction, because he nods to himself and grabs the little bottle. Dean can only watch in stupefaction as Cas lets some liquid dribble onto his own fingers. He nearly forgets how to breathe when the other man reaches behind himself. Saliva stuck in his throat, Dean watches the way Cas' face contorts as he slides a finger into himself, first with a little discomfort, then bliss. He can see the way Cas' arm moves from the corner of his eyes, but he can't seem to do or say anything.
And since it's always been casual and off the book, the only official work experience he has is the bagger thing. He doesn't even have a high school diploma because he dropped out long before that. Not exactly a stellar resume. Which explains why he hasn't found work in eight months and is currently living in his car. Thank God he has Baby.
"Your clothes are nice. You look very handsome. The rest is inconsequential," Castiel reassures as he watches his mother approaches, along with a couple of other people.
Dean can feel his cheeks burn and forces his eyes away from that tempting bit. He focuses on the mismatched flip flops Castiel is wearing. One is brown leather and the other is yellow plastic.
Only Cas knows the true origin of the white scar along Dean's forehead, or why his fingers are so crooked, why his joints ache so much when he's only forty. What truly happened to him during the  first four decades of his life. It's part of the same story as the scars on his own back. Part of the story that he'll never be able to tell and sometimes wishes he would forget.
Somehow, that's what gives Dean the courage to break the distance between them and kiss him. It's just a peck on Cas' lips, there and gone in an instant, but taking their breath away all the same. When he leans back, Cas licks his lips, eyes closed like he's savoring it.
Cas can hear the voice of Sam and the angels a few feet behind them as Dean closes his eyes and leans a little more against Castiel’s open palm. He looks almost reluctant, like he can’t help himself. Worried, Cas reaches with his Grace and finds Dean’s soul screaming in desperation. In need. Knowing Dean doesn’t like to appear vulnerable like this, Cas flies them back to his room.
Dean takes a deep breath and squeezes his fist. He kinda feels like punching Cas, right now. He hates seeing him this closed off. Hell, he just mentioned the death of one of his siblings like it would be
When Cas looks up at Dean, the jock beams at him, before putting the bowl of chips under his nose. Castiel can’t help but smile shyly back, because that guy sure is enticing. He starts relaxing a little more, only jumping when the Singer family’s howling at the screen gets really loud. Now he knows who Jo takes her foul language from, he reflects, gazing wide eyed at Bobby after a particularly vitriolic comment.
Castiel doesn’t pay it any mind at first. Journalists have been waiting in front of his house for days now. Sometimes they get impatient and scream at him to come outside, to let them photograph him. All they got so far are a lot of fines and restraining orders, because Jody’s deputies are watching them like hawks, ready to punish every toe that grazes their house’s lawn for trespassing private property. Jody talks about lawyers and reassures him that they won’t bother them for long. Castiel doesn’t really care. He doesn’t feel like going outside anyway.
Cas’ breath catches and he’s pulled out of his memory when his hand reflexively passes over his lower stomach. It isn’t a good memory either. Or it was, but that night was tainted by what followed the next morning. He chases the memory of Dean's hard stare as he gets into the Impala, ready to abandon Castiel again. He remembers the hunter tense’s hands on the wheel and the jittering of his leg before he forced Cas out of his life again.
"I could totally bang a dude as hot as you if I wanted," Charlie says before hitting his arm, "and don't change the subject! Cas was totally jealous and you know it."
"You're still thinking too much," Castiel groans, nibbling Dean's chin. He strokes his hand just a little faster, making Dean buck up.
Dean’s leg wobbles as soon as he closes the door of his brother’s bedroom and he falls to his knees, hard. He’s gasping for air that he suddenly can’t quite find, chest getting tighter and tighter. He closes his eyes as hard as he can to keep them from overflowing and pulls on his own hair. A scream is burning his throat, but he holds it back too. His head feels like it’s going to explode, overflowing with raw emotions.
“I did,” Cas answers, wiping the blood. He looks at the blood on the back of his hand for a second. “You’re right, I should stop doing that.” He sucks on the side of his lip for a second before nodding his head. “Glad we’ve cleared that up. Goodnight, Dean," Cas says, his tone too neutral.
“Let’s try again," Dean declares, still laughing a little. He can’t let this moment go. He knows himself. He knows Cas. He knows it might never come back.
“Thank you, Dean, that...That means a lot actually,” Cas entrusts, touched. “Especially after how atrociously I’ve acted toward you,” he adds, taking his hand back, remorseful.
"Don't call me dude," Castiel reprimands, squeezing the base of Dean's shaft just a little too hard.
“You do?” Charlie asks, dejected. From the way she’s been looking at Jo with stars in her eyes, Cas would guess that she has a crush and isn’t thrilled at Jo stating she likes men.
"I'm sorry for the way things ended between us," Cas admits, turning his cup of coffee nervously in his hands.
"Yeah he is. He reminds me of someone actually," Dean says, passing an arm around Cas' hips and squeezing him closer to his side. "And Claire definitely takes after you," he adds with a smirk.
"You know what, you just saved me from having to drag them back screaming and kicking. I bought them a new board game to play tonight, how about you offer it to them?"
Dean shrugs with a wink. Claire keeps sending looks every few seconds at her brother, to make sure he hasn't found a stick bigger than the one she already has. Jack is squatting and poking at a flower, looking fascinated. He looks like he's already forgotten all about his stick search.
The voice doesn’t stop shouting, but Cas is grateful that it sounds like it’s getting farther away. Or maybe he is?
Dean squeezes his fist beside his thighs. It's not the first time Jack has expressed his worry that Dean might abandon him again. It breaks Dean's heart every time, the guilt nearly choking him and sending him back to all those times he wondered if his bio dad was going to come back.
“Yes,” the FBI agent answers at the same time as Jody firmly says ‘No’ behind him. “I’m sorry, kiddo, but it’s really important.”
"I gotta admit, Cas, this is way less fancy than I thought it would be," Dean whispers as he piles up some ham on his plate.
"I can't," Dean says, so low that Charlie leans forward, probably having missed his word. Dean turns his head in the direction of Jack's giggles. The kid is trying to mimic some dude dressed as a Viking as he bites into a giant turkey leg.
Dean frowns after him, wondering what crawled up his ass and died. Cas has never been one for social decency, but he's never been so downright dismissive before. Dean resists the urge to follow him, to make sure that everything is okay or pester him until he tells him what is wrong. He forces himself to remember that it's none of his business and probably better like this. He wanted some distance, and it looks like Cas got the same idea.
makes Castiel strokes himself harder. His cock is twitching and making his own strokes slide easier and easier as he leaks beads of precome. He wonders for a second how
It’s unsettling to see him like this, with cuts and bruises that don’t disappear in the blink of an eye. Cas has been living with them in the bunker for three months now. He’s still adjusting to being human, while Dean is still adjusting to Cas not disappearing for days or weeks at a time. He’s surprised by how much he likes it. How much stress has actually evaporated now that he knows where Cas is at all times, that he’s close and safe and not defying or pissing off the whole damn Host of Heaven. Hell, they don’t even have to worry about Heaven or angels anymore, now that they’ve locked up Heaven. Which is fine by Dean, as long as he gets to keep his favorite angel. The only one he really likes, to be honest. He’ll always be grateful that Cas chose to stay here, at the cost of his Grace, rather than go back to Heaven. All in all, he seems to be adjusting really well to being human.
"Yes, yes, yes," Claire answers while jumping up and down in his lap. "Thank you, thank you!" She leans back against his chest in what is probably supposed to pass as another hug as she reads what's written on the box for her little brother's benefit.
"They just fed me a whole jar of olives, I think my stomach needs a break," Dean complains, pushing a little against Cas' hand when it looks like he's going to stop his caress. To be honest, he was probably picking bits of food out of it more than caressing his hair, but still, it felt good. Cas rolls his eyes fondly, eating from his plate with one hand while he continues to play with Dean's hair with the other.
"If you don't want it, Daisy will gladly have it," the man says without looking up from a newspaper he's reading. As if to agree, the dog barks once. It's nothing like her previous vicious barks, she looks relaxed, tongue lolling out the side of her mouth and tail wriggling.
"Thank you, Dean, that means a lot," Cas says sincerely. Their eyes stay locked a moment longer before suddenly Castiel starts avoiding his gaze and blushes and...wait, he knows that look.
Cas is wearing black leather pants that hug his thighs so closely that Dean starts sweating just thinking about what it must do to his ass. On top, he’s wearing a puffy white dress shirt that has the first few buttons opened, showing off his sharp collarbone. The sleeves are rolled up too, and Dean never thought he could find forearms so sexy before he met Cas. Over it, Cas has put on an embroidered satin vest that is so tight that it makes Dean wonder if that might be some kind of male corset. It's purple with gold and black arabesques stitches along the side and under the ribs. It perfectly highlights the slimness of Cas' waist in contrast to the broadness of his shoulders.
They've got a hike up the mountain planned today, followed by a picnic at a vineyard and an early afternoon at the hot springs before they walk back. Dean wonders if he could get away with feeling sick again, just to keep Castiel all to himself for the day. He has some interesting ideas of how they could pass the time...
It took Castiel ten months with Jody before he stopped being scared of what would happen if he stopped shaving. When he finally tried, all that Jody did was hug him really tight. Now the tables have turned, and he throws a fit every time she pesters him to get a haircut.
Jack muffles something unintelligible. All that Dean gets is the word 'sleep', but seeing as it's around bedtime, it's enough for him to get the jist that Jack is probably not that keen on going to bed.
"You're right. It's none of your business," he says, a little sterner as he turns away and grabs what looks like some kind of tibetan gong.
After dinner, he sits on the ground around the coffee table with the children. Everyone seems to be in a good mood tonight, cozy on the giant couches around the fire. The atmosphere is warm and homey, everyone playing games and laughing. Cas is silent, but seems content to sip on a warm cup tea while watching them all play, tucked under a blanket on the couch, one of his feet brushing against Dean's back.
His Baby is everything. All he has to do is find her and he'll have a place to sleep. It's his home. He still has some canned food in the truck and some bottles of water. There might still be a few bucks from Castiel's first payment in the glove box as well. Not much, he used up most of that to buy winter clothes, gas and food, but maybe enough that he can get by for a couple days.
Cas' hands try to pull Dean's forearms away, but they don't seem to be able to grasp him strongly enough, fingers shaking. Dean doesn't move, slowly breathing in and out and waiting for Cas to calm down. It takes a while before Cas finally sags down in his hold. Dean invites him to breathe with him until Cas' eyes are finally steady enough to hold his.
"I promise I'll do my best. I mean...I'll probably screw up again, you should know that. But I do care about Jack and I want him in my life."
Apparently, Naomi Novak is prominent enough that they don't mind changing her reservation at all, and they're seated at a table near a legit indoor fountain. Dean is looking around, trying not to let show how impressed he is by the place. The walls are made of stone and covered in frescos that he always thought you couldn't see outside of a church or castle. A waiter gives him a leather covered menu and Dean opens it eagerly. After a few niceties to Naomi, they're asked what they want to drink. Dean has an inkling that he probably shouldn't ask for a beer in an establishment like this.
They seem to understand that the subject is a delicate one, because nobody pushes him anymore, not even Lucifer. Instead, Anael makes a remark about how good the salmon is and they divert their collective attention to something else than Dean's obvious sadness.
He feels like he should apologize, and like he did nothing wrong at the same time. He's still the same man that was holding Castiel in his arms less than an hour ago. He's also the stranger that Cas embarked into this whole masquerade without seeming to care about his past. Dean never told him about being homeless or having a criminal record, but Castiel never asked either. Is Dean such a usurper, or was Cas never interested in the truth in the first place?
“No,” he moans, rolling his eyes because he already had to give her a detailed report of his whole day. Then she called Charlie so Charlie could give her a full report of his whole day. That’s how she learnt about the party that he conveniently forgot to mention.
“He had just lost his son, Dean,” Sam reminds him, like Dean could forget, when he did too. It wasn’t the same, he knew that, but he still lost Jimmy too. They all did. Sam seems to realise his blunder, looking guilty. “I’ll explain him for the wards. He won’t hurt me, Dean, I trust him.”
"Dude I saw him arrive half an hour ago, how long does it take to...oh. Okay, that was worth it," she finishes, looking in awe over Dean's shoulder.
"You're not gonna say that when you start sweating cheese during the night," Castiel warns, teasing. "Believe me, we've all been there and have learnt from our mistakes."
. You took a serious blow to the head, Sam,“ Dean advises, voluntarily leaving out the part where Cas nearly choked his little brother to death. He can’t quite believe that happened, can’t allow himself to think about it right now.
“Of course,” Cas responds, even though that’s the last thing he wants to do right now. He knows he has to tell Dean that they can’t kiss again. He has no idea how to approach that conversation.
Cas sighs, enjoying the water of the shower, cascading on his head and along his body in a warm caress. He closes his eyes and lets himself enjoy it.
"Oh," Castiel says. He looks about as uncomfortable as Dean feels, which is a little reassuring, if not helpful. "I don't know how to act 'couple-y'." The dork actually mimes air quotes, making Dean roll his eyes. "Do you?" The question seems genuine and Dean is taken aback.
Soon, those long fingers are moving faster, Cas' teeth mouthing on the inside of Dean's thigh, eyes on him as he watches for his reaction. The idea that Cas might leave a mark there makes Dean bucks up again. Thank God for Cas' reflexes or that would have made Dean slip right off the bed. Instead, Cas' free hand grabs his hip, pinning him in place. Dean can't help but feel a rush at this new reminder of Cas' strength. The movement has changed the angle, Cas' fingers slipping just a bit deeper and Dean shouts as a whole new sensation surges through him, a shot of electricity making every nerve in his body light up in pleasure for a fraction of a second. Interest piqued, Cas does it again, and again. He rubs against that place inside Dean until his back is arching, his dick leaking a constant flow of precome, drenching his shaft and sliding along his balls until it joins the lube around Cas' fingers.
"I really think you should look at it, Dean," Cas invites softly. He pushes the papers closer to Dean, and Dean relents, taking it with a trembling hand. Cas' stare is firm and loving, makes him feel like whatever he's going to find in there, he will be okay. Whatever it is, Cas will be by his side to help him through it.
After lunch, they're supposed to start cleaning, but they're so exhausted that they camp on Dean's couch instead. Cas is trying to mend Bee-Bee (it has some patches burnt over its back) while Dean tries to find something suitable to watch with Jack in his DVD collection. Cas has put a veto on Star Wars and Lord of the Rings already.
“Then call him yourself,” Dean answers, a little annoyed...and touched that Sam cared that much about Cas…and annoyed at how much that touches him. Sam’s stare is insistent and doesn’t let on though, edging toward the ultimate puppy eyed look. Dean sighs, throwing his hands up. “Okay okay, I’ll do it,” he concedes with a groan.
Dean opens and closes a few cabinets until he finds plates and silverware, starting to serve them both a piece of pie.
Dean grabs Cas' wrists when he raises his hand again, pushing forward until Cas' back is against a tree trunk.
"I do hope I'll get to keep some mystery, we wouldn't want this guy to lose interest," Dean says with a wink. He pats Castiel's hand on the table. Should he hold it or something? How open on PDA are gay people those days? Not that he knows more about how heterosexual couple act in public anyway, especially in those crowds. It's probably safer to keep the PDA to a minimum here.
Duck, as it turns out, is actually very good. It's more like red meat than chicken, which is a great surprise. Although, Dean isn't a fan of the way rich people put tiny quantities of food in very large plates. He eats all the dinner rolls and scrapes every single bit of sauce out of his plate, yet he's still hungry by the end of it. He nearly starts crying when the waiter asks them if they want some dessert and Naomi declines. He's starting to wonder if that little piece of duck was worth sitting through lunch with her.
There is no one to hear them, yet Castiel whispers like it's a secret, just theirs. "Can I kiss you?"
"Yeah, my dad taught me. Grew up on the road, you know, if you don't have a decent car, you don't have a home," he bites his lips, wondering if he's said too much. "I haven't been taking good enough care of my Baby recently, she deserves a good check up," he says guiltily. "You can add whatever I use to the bill, of course," he rushes to say.
Tbh I'm not a fan of Castiel's reaction in that last part. I feel it might be a little ooc. What did you think?
It's not that comfortable, what with the sticky fluids between their skins and too many sharp bones poking the wrong places. Cas is heavy and sweaty and his hair is tickling Dean's nose.
“Don’t you go sir me, I’m Bobby and that’s that. Now go grab something to drink,” Bobby instructs, indicating a door to his left with his beer.
“It’s actually not an inappropriate comparaison, in more than one aspect,” he reassures with a shrug. “And he’s not my dad. Not like your dad is your dad.”
Cas glares and Dean sighs, deposing the kid on the blanket they’ve laid out on the ground for him. The hunter spends a few seconds making sure the toy he’s showing him manages to grab the baby's interest before he gets back up. Cas still looks troubled.
Dean sits at the table, grabs his spoon and starts to eat eagerly. No way he's missing any chance at a warm meal.
"Oh I had some fun," Cas says, pressing his smirk against the head of Dean's cock. "Not as much fun as I'm going to have with you though," he punctuates his words by grabbing under Dean's knees, pulling them up until they're pushed up against Dean's chest. Cas falls to his knees in front of the bed, leaning Dean's feet on his shoulders. Dean should feel embarrassed about how exposed that leaves him, but before he can even think about it, Cas' mouth latches onto his balls, and Dean can't quite think anymore. Cas is licking and sucking eagerly, and Dean shivers when he feels saliva trickling along his balls and further beneath him. Cas' mouth follows the same trail, nudging Dean's balls up with his nose and sucking at the spot just under it, making Dean buck up with a shout. He's touched his taint before, even experimented with his asshole since the last time he saw Cas. He's learned to relax into it and bring pleasure to himself under the shower with a finger teasing his entrance. Living on Bobby's couch never really gave him the opportunity to explore more than that, but he wants to. He really
He follows the sound, to a little park. It's just two swings and a few benches surrounded by the trees. Claire and Jack, two of Cas' nephews, are running around the makeshift playground while their mother is sitting on a wooden bench watching them with a smile. Hannah waves at him when she notices him and Dean hesitates as he waves back. He would have liked to walk further down the path and isn't really in the mood for company. The children take the decision away from him when they run straight to him.
“No wait, please!!” Cas begs, firmly pushing his hands back on Dean’s abs. “I’m ready,” Castiel affirms. The other boy grabs his wrists, bringing his arms down.
Cas' hand stops moving, only his thumb circling the slit over the head of Dean's cock, as he ponders what to do next. It's driving Dean crazy. He tries to hump up to get more pressure, but is suddenly met by air. He groans in frustration and opens his eyes, ready to protest, but all words leave him when he sees Castiel sliding further down his body.
“It’s a stupid boring file, okay? Just reading the first two lines makes me fall asleep every damn time. I swear, it’s better than Benzo, you should commercialize that shit.”
“Alright, you know what? How about I put them on and you just tell me which one looks the best?” Dean suggests, eager.
“For a start. You will also invite my girlfriend,” she exposes, designating Jo, “and drive us there,” she finishes. “And buy us food before!” she adds at the last second.
Cas can't quite look  him in the eyes, so he grabs his chin and brings him in for another kiss. It's the best diversion he's found. Sex and affection always prevail over anything else for Dean.
There are suddenly two fingers under Cas’ chin, making him look up. He gulps as his eyes plunge into Dean’s. He had never noticed how green they were. Up close, they are even more fascinating than his freckles. Thinking that makes his eyes slide to the freckles on Dean’s cheeks. He realizes that they are getting closer and closer, the fingers on chin raising it just a little more so that his mouth is right in front of...Castiel takes a sudden step back, blinking out of his daze. Kissing. He’s never done that. He was so focused on the coïtus part that he never took time to inform himself on how to do that.
Dean elects not to say anything when it happens again two nights later, because Sam is starting to suggest that they contact Heaven about it and...no, just no. Cas left nearly sixteen months ago now and Dean is not ready to reach back. Or he is, and that’s the problem. He still desperately wants to. He still has to stop himself from praying to his friend every day, knows that he sometimes still does it without realizing. He has no idea if Castiel can even hear the random ‘I hope you’re okay, Cas’, ‘Damn, you would have loved that’, or ‘Help me I’m about to be eaten by the freaking Yeti’ that Dean can’t help but send off in subconscious prayers. Cas never answered, never gave any news, even to Sam. Dean knows it’s his own fault, that he’s been an asshole and that Cas didn’t deserve any of it. He was probably right when he told Dean he was better off without him. Dean doesn’t doubt it because he keeps hurting the people he loves, or getting them killed.
Dean promises himself to call by midday the next morning, but in the end he doesn't have to. When he wakes up the next day and opens the door to let Daisy in for breakfast, there is a Tesla in the driveway.
Watch out for the new tags, this chapter has non-con voyeurism. You can go straight to the end note if you want some more details before you read.
“Sorry, guys, I can’t. My dad is already sleeping and I don’t want him waking up to me missing. I should be home already,” she apologizes, leaning in to hug Cas.
They don't need to know that Sam would never want to see him again anyway. That Dean failed him where he should have been protecting him.
“You’re about as charming as the A in DNA," the woman answers, before going back to her work station.
The kid appears just long enough at breakfast to drop a cereal box to the ground. Then later Dean is pretty sure he hears him shriek in the corridor, but by the time he gets there, there is nothing.
