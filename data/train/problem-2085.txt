Either way, it still did not excuse his absence and avoidance of his brother for the past three days. He had not seen his brother even once since he gained coherency and it took his entire being to not make that frustration vocalised.
The van was sitting on the southern bank of the River Thames by the time John had arrived alongside Mycroft. The van’s interior was waterlogged and several scenes of crime officers were scouring the taped-off scene, taking photographs and trying to recover what they could from the damaged vehicle.
There was a loud bang, followed by the loud voices of nurses and the screeching of a gurney with a limp wheel. An elderly man was escorted onto it as he clutched at his chest, complaining of shortness of breath, while telling the nurses that it was nothing to worry about. They passed by John, who turned to watch them disappear around the corner to the lift before shaking his head and continuing his walk back to the room Sherlock was currently housed. Walking through the threshold, he saw a male nurse next to a cart holding several small bottles of medication, his hands on the chart that held all of Sherlock’s medical information.
More questions swarmed around his head and John was trying to focus on the one that was the most important; however, given the situation, they all were of equal importance to him.
“Ah, right,” the eldest Holmes said with a nonchalant expression. Moving back to the laptop, he switched to a tab that he must have had loaded before John’s arrival. A bolded headline came up reading
It was as though that was what his mind was waiting for, his breath shaking as his cry bounced off the cement walls. When he tried to inhale, his nasal passages echoed in the unfamiliarity of inflammation and he found himself face-to-face with the camera once more. It was the first time he was waiting for the American to make a comment, but when nothing but silence followed, all he could focus on was the muted sounds from himself.
“I’ve offered to release the Cielo Diablos members currently in our custody, travel, money, immunity – everything.” His gaze finally met John’s, whose were filling slowly with understanding.
“Meaning we’re looking for evidence of a secondary vehicle?” Lestrade confirmed with an audible noise. “Have they found another set of marks, then?”
With his hand trailing the wall, he found the switch for the kitchen light. The light flickered, growing dim before turning off completely. He flipped the switch on and off to no avail, a sign escaping his throat. Going by outlines and memory, he made his way into the kitchen towards the refrigerator. Insomnia be damned: if he was made to be conscious, he would at least be productive. However, when he opened the fridge door, any thought of utilising his insomnia vanished when the bottom shelf lay barren. He very much doubted Mrs. Hudson to stomach discarding the upper half of a human thigh – especially one in the late stages of decomposition. Though he would not put it above his flatmate.
“Have you been able to track down the others?” John asked in reference to those involved with Sherlock’s abduction.
“We’ve tried to track the video, but it appears they’ve encrypted and bounced the originating IP address through a relay of virtual circuits. Most likely using the same program they did to send the route information to the members in the UK.”
The dirt on his boots had been wet at one point, meaning he was in a location with mud. Given that it had not rained in the last few days, and that the man clearly took care in his appearance, logic concluded he was near water.
Upon arriving outside the flat, he barely acknowledged the cabbie as he got out and slammed the door closed. The driver drove off as John walked the two steps to stand in front of the door and took a deep breath, holding it for a moment before releasing it in a long exhale. The last thing he wanted to do was go inside and do nothing while the state of his best mate was unknown, but he also knew he had to get his bearings straight before he would be any good to anyone.
“Don’t look so nervous, Sherlock. Keep a strong face for Mycroft, won’t you?” a man with an American accent spoke off-screen. Despite the man’s comment, Sherlock’s expression was that of disinterest. “Give a smile for the camera, darling.” The camera zoomed in on Sherlock’s face, who gave a cynical smile before falling back to a resting position. The camera zoomed back out. The person behind the camera laughed. “I’m sure your attitude will change in a moment.”
No longer having to worry about causing Sherlock to have another panic attack, John returned his attention to following the news articles on the takedown. Not as much was coming out, the bulk having been the initial twenty-four hours. There was a small headline that caught his eye:
“C’mon, Sherlock,” the man said as he wrapped his free arm around Sherlock’s hips as he leaned close to his ear. “Scream for me,” he whispered as he pushed in further. Sherlock’s face contorted in pain, veins straining against his neck as he willed everything in his being to refrain from releasing the build-up in his throat. When he failed to get what he wanted, the American began hastily pumping his hand in-and-out.
Lestrade’s hands were on the back of his neck, his eyes locked onto the computer screen, even as it went to black with the option of replaying.
The medic looked to Lestrade and Donovan for confirmation, rolling his eyes in aggravation when Lestrade nodded.
As Sherlock was placed on a backboard, John continued to call out his name. It barely registered as he was escorted out of the room by Donovan in the same direction Sherlock was taken, due to follow the ambulance in the police car. Mycroft was on their heels as the orders Lestrade was giving to the officers still in the room faded into the background.
A nurse had come to administer his next round of antibiotics under John’s ever-watchful supervision while they were arguing about finding a case to work on. John was rolling his eyes while Sherlock was going on about having something to occupy his mind. As the nurse was pressing the syringe needle into the injection point, John was asking if Sherlock planned to wheel himself around a crime scene, and that it would be nigh impossible for Lestrade to even consider asking for his assistance within the near future. The other was in the middle of retorting as the medications took over and he trailed off, his eyelids fluttering shut as his words began slurring. Moments later, his breathing had become even and he sank into the mattress. The nurse gave John a knowing smile, which he returned.
The recording was cut off and Lestrade leaned back in the foldout chair, releasing a breath as he set his hands on the back of his neck. Donovan stood behind him with one hand on the back of the chair and other on the desk as she leaned forward to view the footage. Even as one who always claimed to disagree and distrust the young genius, even her demeanour was tense, he shoulders taught, along with her jaw. It was as though her speculation had fallen through, and even she was beginning to feel the weight of the situation.
Confusion at the time was slowly replaced by realisation and he jerked his head up. He instinctively shoved the phone into his pocket as he approached the bathroom door. He could still hear the shower, but no heavy sound of collected water that would insinuate one would be washing. Bringing up his hand, he rapped on the door.
Banishing any ill-will he had towards Sherlock’s sibling, he relayed, “We’ve secured the street. We’ll enter through both the back and front doors, blocking off any chance the people inside have to escape. Once they are secured, we’ll recover Sherlock and have this operation shutdown.”
John’s heart thudded in his chest, knowing they were referring to Sherlock. The caught conversation made his anger rise and he had to resist the desire to slam the door open and take full control of the situation, disregarding any ill will that would be thrust upon him. It was forgone as he heard shuffling moving closer to the door.
He remembered her red hair and freckled face, but could not remember her eye colour. She was slender and he knew she was eye-level with him, putting her height at about 170cm; she had been wearing a dress – a type of sun dress if he remembered correctly – but could not recall the pattern, if it even had one.
At first, he was not even aware his mobile had gone off, it having fallen to the floor at some time during the night. His laptop nearly met it when he sat up, only being caught by John at the last second. Finding his phone underneath the bed, he was alerted to several text messages that Lestrade had apparently been sending throughout the night, the most recent reading 87. He unlocked his phone and sat back in the chair, scrolling through the updates, checking for anything that was not number-based. He tossed the phone on the table with a sigh when they were just that and stared at his incapacitated ally.
Just as they turned the corner, a female bumped into both of their shoulders, her nose having been buried in her phone. She immediately fell into an apology, before her eyes trailed up to their faces. Her gaze fell on John first, and then darted over to Sherlock, when her eyes appeared to light up.
Once unfettered, he crouched to search the man, only to find him unbothered by a weapon. A frown befell his face, but he quickly shook it off, taking the only chance he may have to escape the enclosure.
Sherlock tried to pull himself back up, but his dislocated shoulder made it impossible and, instead, he was forced to rely on his left arm for support.
“I’m fine, John.” Instead of responding, John went to the chair and moved it, pulling the power cord out from underneath. He turned back to look to Sherlock, whose gaze was on the chair, then to the cord. There was a moment of silence before the younger man said quietly, “Thank you.” He turned and continued making his way to the loo.
“You weren’t supposed to immobilize him,” the one in the black tank-top said, his accent proper, as the other moved to grab Sherlock by his neck and shoulders, hoisting him to his feet.
He moved the man’s body around the side of the building, positioning him in a way he could have been mistaken as sleeping. Once set, he searched the pockets and waistband, finding a walkie-talkie and a pocket knife – the apparent weapon they had been reaching for. He took both, along with the man’s hooded sweater, and returned to the outside of the main entrance where he found the door propped open by a small piece of wood. He entered quietly as he put the sweater over his light jacket, uncertain as to who would be on the other end, making sure to keep the wood block in place, understanding the door would lock when fully shut; and with Mycroft, and he was certain Lestrade by that point, en route, leaving the entrance unhindered was within their best interests.
“It’s done. You can leave, now.” The look she gave met with her tone had everyone in the area scatter. In any other situation, John would have found her assertive and pompous tone grating; yet, at the moment, he could not have welcomed it more. After they left, leaving the two alone with nothing more than the steady beeping, Donovan released an audible sigh, shaking her head while John watched her. “Bloody parasites,” she muttered, taking a quick glance to the incapacitated man on the bed.
Palm to the door, he slowly pushed it open, readying himself for an inevitability. Instead, when he saw who was standing by the table between the windows, he dropped his shoulders.
John shrugged and met Sherlock’s eyes. “Perhaps I am. You want to be out and about, after all. Besides”—he set his hand over Sherlock’s, who subconsciously went rigid at the contact—“if we’re a partnership, we should do what couples do, right?”
John smiled and shook his head, rubbing Sherlock’s cheek. “You’ve done nothing wrong, Sherlock. We will make it through this – I will help you through this, all right? So stop apologising. It doesn’t suit you.”
“You do that on your own – you don’t need me.” He smiled in jest as he reached his hand across the table to encompass his partner’s hand. “But if you want to have a reason to be embarrassed, I don’t mind giving you a reason.” With that, he brought Sherlock’s hand up and leaned forward to kiss his knuckles. He expected the other to pull his hand back, but when he did not, he watched as a tint of rose met his partner’s cheeks.
“It’s so hard to find good help these days,” he said, though he sounded as though he was talking to himself. “Think you could recommend a reliable plumber, Sherlock? Don’t know who I can trust in my apartment in the damned city.”
The majority of messages were along the lines of cheating partners or spouses and asking for his assistance in proving their suspicions. They were deleted en masse.
“Oh, we actually have very little interest in you, Sherlock Holmes. But you see,” he held up his phone to face Sherlock. “Your brother, Mycroft, has been a thorn in our side, as of late and we – do smile pretty, won’t you? – never do like people intervening with our affairs.” The flash from the camera went off as Sherlock gave a sardonic smile. He brought the phone down and continued texting.
“Like how you taste, Sherlock?” It was the smell that hit him before the taste. He gagged when his tongue was pressed down as fingers hit his uvula. His fingers were extracted and he ran his hand down Sherlock’s face. “There,” Dreln said as he stood up as the scent infected the genius’ senses. “Now you can smell like the piece of shit you are.”
“Unless it was hacked like the other cameras,” Donovan commented, doubting the reliability. The look she was given was that of confusion, which she mirrored. “The notice this morning?” she drew out. When his expression failed to the change, she remembered that he had been called away to investigate the scene surrounding the van before it had come in. “We got an anonymous call this morning alerting us to a system breach in some of the traffic cameras in London. While they were apparently restored before we were notified, they were hacked around the time of the abduction.” She exhaled and crossed her arms. “But we don’t know how many were hindered or for how long.”
It did not take long for the warm liquid of semen to fill his throat, which the man was sure to hold, forcing Sherlock to swallow, before pulling out and sitting back on his heels on Sherlock’s chest. He ran his hand through Sherlock’s matted hair, a strange smile gracing his features.
With a hard swing, the knuckles on Sherlock’s right hand made contact with the man’s temple, sending the stout man crumpling to the floor. Sherlock shook his hand, the hit causing a slight pain down his wrist. He stared at the now-unconscious man as he started reworking the pin against the left shackle.
“You have my apologies, Sherlock Holmes,” the American said as he set his hand on Sherlock’s forehead. “But if it’s any consolation, I can give you the choice of how you die.”
Muffled voices from the hall entered the room, the monitors steadily beeping. Early morning sunlight was leaking into the room, basking the room in a golden hue. John had returned to the chair next to the bed, a hot cup of tea sitting on the table next to a half-eaten sandwich. Curiosity had pulled him back to the website the woman – Allison – had introduced them to with the first video of Sherlock’s abduction. He was genuinely surprised to find the site still running, having expected Mycroft to have pulled some strings to have it shutdown indefinitely. What was gone, however, were the multitude of videos of Sherlock’s abuse. He had combed through the various uploads, ensuring they had been taken down, only finding videos of Sherlock and himself on various newscasts throughout the years.
The comment had Sherlock’s heart thud, but he paid it no heed, while the American discreetly glanced up from his phone.
Hoping his idea would work, he shoved his hands into the front pocket of the sweatshirt, dropping his posture as he came in view of the entryway. He saw the broken wooden desk in the centre of the room, the large window on the left wall and doorway at the far end. Immediately, the Mexican man stood straight, his hand reaching behind him for what John suspected was a firearm. The suspicions were confirmed when he entered the room to come face-to-face with a loaded 9mm Glock.
The van that Sherlock was abducted in is located. Meanwhile, Sherlock is subjected to scenarios that bring out his own inner demons.
“You really care about him, don’t you?” she asked, breaking the awkward silence and drawing John’s attention.
“Is that a get-well card?” Sherlock asked, tone mirroring his typical state, though his features spoke much different.
“Brilliant plan, but you miscounted.” The man’s eyebrows went up in curiosity, but he did not trail his gaze from his phone. “Mycroft’s never been one to negotiate, so all of this won’t bend in your favour.”
basements, John.” The doctor stopped in mid-rebuttal, his brows creasing. “Do you honestly think we didn’t consider that?”
“Are you just figuring that out?” His eyes darted to the screen. “So you do know what’s happened, then. Can I ask what you’re doing about it?” his tone was strict, which Mycroft either failed to pick up on or decided to ignore.
After several attempts, he finally felt the thin piece of metal and was able to grip it between the tips of his index and middle fingers. He had to go by feel as he made the ninety-degree bend at the tip of the pin before feeling for the keyhole to the shackle. Once he found it and inserted it at the top of the hole, he had to fenagle with it for a bit before he heard it click. Pushing his wrist outwards, he freed his right hand before passing the pin and starting on the left. Right as he had it positioned inside the keyhole, the sound of footsteps came from the hall beyond the door.
“Always the same thing. You’re getting old.” There was a pause as John made his way closer to the door, contemplating whether or not to step through and take his chances. “So go downstairs and have some fun – only thing that keeps any of us entertained these days.”
“And get blood all over my floor? Me thinks not, comrade Cleary.” The comment was met with an unamused expression, while Dreln inspected the camera, ensuring the battery was still charged. “Here.” He tossed the camera to the other man, who caught it without looking. “Do me a favour and charge that for me.”
“Do you want me to embarrass myself?” he asked, meeting John’s eyes in a silent battle, one which John had already chosen to take no part in.
Mycroft raised his brows. “Unless you have a manner of extracting information from a sodden mobile, then yes.”
“Oi, where do you want him?” the man who held Sherlock asked as the genius was trying and failing at getting free.
The officer took a minute to register the name before he recognised it. He raised his brows as he nodded. “That explains it,” he muttered garnering an odd look. “Well, I’ll be on shift until the morning when Clarke relieves me, so don’t worry ‘bout anything.”
If Sherlock was about to start a new case, he at least wanted to know what he was about to be dragged into.
He moved into the same direction the nurse had gone towards the lifts. If he was lucky, Sherlock would be coming-to, though it was an optimistic thought. It was a day ago when he had been asked to pose as a Cielo Diablos member and his mate had yet to return to the waking world. Lestrade had stopped by during his free time; whenever he was not dealing with cases files or the overall investigation of the drug cartel’s infiltration of the city. After Christopher Cleary was brought in, the information John was given became less and less. While he understood why, he had to refrain from becoming actively upset with being left in the shadows.
There was a moment’s pause as he leaned into the van, before he stepped back, carrying someone’s legs. The other individual opened the side door to the people carrier, while another person exited the van, hauling the upper body of an apparent unconscious man. Upon closer inspection, the dark trousers and long-sleeved shirt, along with the mat of dark, curly hair, made no mistake that it was the young genius Sherlock Holmes.
“More or less,” was the immediate response, the man taking another drag from his own cigarette, not bothering to look in John’s direction, instead focusing on peering down the walkways for other life.
“We’re going to find him,” Lestrade’s voice came out reassuring, despite his own false sense of hope. “All evidence points to them still being in London and they’re not going to get away with a bloody thing.” The strict demeanour had John nodding.
Mycroft staggered to the door and opened it, a hint which Sherlock blatantly ignored. “That would because you are a child, dear brother. It is beyond you.”
His mobile vibrated, signalling an incoming text. A notification from Lestrade had come in, updating him on the number of total arrests: 62. It was the only bit of information they would tell him. Any of the information they had gathered was no longer something they could divulge, though John knew that if the tides had been different, Sherlock would have been one of the people requested to help work in the takedown.
When he left the flat that morning, Sherlock was lying in the same position on the couch, a book held firmly over his face with his eyes darting back-and-forth between words. Though John was certain Sherlock was holding a different book then.
When Mycroft returned to them, he was holding a plastic bag with Sherlock’s mobile phone. Seeing it, Lestrade held up his hand, his expression becoming serious, albeit somewhat frantic.
He finally found himself agreeing with Mycroft’s accusations, how it had been his own fault for the position he found himself in, and that there was no way to escape – no one to come for him. Mycroft would never risk his position to aid someone with such insignificance, that much was certain. It was not as though Sherlock did not understand.
“There’s nothing in his profile about an allergy,” he said, flipping the page. He allowed the page to fall back into place and brought the syringe in front of his face, flicking it to force the air to the top and pressing the plunger enough to extract it.
“Mycroft,” John’s words spoke through the unnerving quiet between them. While the official looked at him, John questioned if he was paying the slightest bit of attention. “Think. They have Sherlock in a basement – a basement in London. There can’t be very many of those.”
There was a muffled groan as the Irishman inserted his partially flaccid length into Sherlock, whose body tensed. It took him a minute, but once he was fully in, he placed his left hand on Sherlock’s back and grabbed his hip with the right. Another moment passed before warm liquid began filling him and, though he knew better, the detective tried to pull against the chain holding his wrists to the pipe. The moment he did, pain seared down his back and he stopped, shaking.
There were a few grunts from Sherlock as he had to force his stiff leg up each stair. “A stroll.” They reached the landing. John kept Sherlock close to the wall, giving his mate the illusion of self-preservation as the brunet’s palm met the wall for stabilization. “Bored of being stuck in these walls with nothing to stimulate my mind. And since I’m being denied my basic right, I figured a bout of fresh air would suffice,” he groaned as they entered the living quarters and John assisted him to the couch, choosing to ignore the comment.
He extracted his fingers. Yet, before he pulled back, he smacked Sherlock’s cheek and grabbed it, giving it a harsh squeeze and beginning the formation of a new bruise.
After manoeuvring the body into the back seat, the person who had climbed out of the back of the van approached the driver of the blue people carrier. There was another verbal exchange before they got into the driver’s seat of the smaller vehicle. The vehicle started up and drove off, turning right at the intersection out front of the sports pub; meanwhile, the other two returned to the front of the van, the man with the tank top getting into the driver’s seat. Leaving the Square, they made a right along with the other, heading towards the river.
The right bastard had known the new code the entire time, but it had them both laugh at the absurdity.
His attention was drawn back to the inspector, his eyebrows knitting in confusion as he tried to piece together why he was awakened on the sidewalk with a torch. He shook his head. “I – I can’t remember.” He held his head, recalling walking down the stairs of 221B Baker Street with Sherlock in front of him.
Even with his state, Sherlock hung on the tone and verbiage. “Them” clearly meant the higher ups Sherlock had met only a few times since his abduction, but the way the American spoke brought rise to more questions. Why trust this one man to oversee, but not allow him to partake? Their early encounter came to his mind, where Dreln had ejaculated inside his mouth and told him not to mention it to anyone else. Thinking back, outside of the waterboarding, the man had not performed any act himself. Not in front of the camera or another person, at least.
I've read four of former-FBI Profiler John Douglas' books, two of the Asylum books and several of my old college textbooks.
John approached the bed and set his hand on Sherlock’s leg, eyes trailing from his bruised and cut face to the bruising around his neck. “What happened?” His attention went to the wires connecting to the machines.
“Holmes came to, then crashed,” she spoke in near aggravation, which only garnered a panicked response. “While he was coherent, he requested you and Mycroft – they’re waiting for both of you in the ER back at the hospital. Mycroft has already been notified. Foss will drive you there,” she finished, nodding the officer who brought John out of the room.
She clicked them around his wrists, frowning at the sad attempt at humour. He brought his hands in front of him, inhaling deeply as he composed himself, recalling the body language and demeanour of addicts and gang members he had come into contact with throughout his adulthood. With a reaffirming nod to Donovan, she took hold of his upper arm and guided him to the door, which was only locked from the inside, pulling it open. She pulled him forward into the room, forcing him to turn and face her. Replacing the determined look with a scowl, he held out his arms, watching as she brought out a handcuff key. When she went to take hold of his wrist, he pulled it back, causing her to put more pressure on her grip, her nails digging into his left wrist as she inserted the key and unlocked the first cuff. They repeated the action with the second hand and, when he was free, John called her a “cunt” as she shut the door.
At some point during the night, John had managed to fall asleep, his head falling on the back of the chair, his feet propped on the rails of Sherlock’s bed. Unbeknownst to him, an officer had been stationed to Sherlock’s room, ensuring nothing happened to the genius – another courtesy of Donovan’s. John came to when a nurse entered to deliver Sherlock’s medications. He monitored what she gave him and how much, falling back into sleep shortly after she left the room, ensuring his mate reacted properly to the given medication.
While his self-preservation begged to hold out, his logic took hold and he knew that the ultimatum the American gave him would only be offered once. If he chose to forgo the offer, nothing but pain and death awaited; however, if he accepted, while death was inevitable, the pain could, for the most part, be forgone. Being suffocated in the past proved that there would be some discomfort, but it would be short, a few minutes at most.
Without hesitation, the American’s free hand ran down his cheek and jaw, before his fingers entered his mouth.
John leaned the crutch against the wall and approached, seeing him become frustrated at getting dressed without causing more injury to his knee. John glanced to see his cast set on the other side of the bed.
John glanced to the table, seeing the card Lestrade had brought two days ago. He nodded as his attention had gone back to his mate. “Courtesy of Scotland Yard.”
“Look,” she cut him off. “Just because most of us don’t like the freak doesn’t mean everyone doesn’t. No one willing hangs around Sherlock Holmes unless they need him. You’re the first, John.” John stared at her, his frustration and anger rising, but he kept it contained. “A blind man sees the way you two are with other. It’s just that you’re both too stubborn to say it.” She looked at the unconscious man on the bed. “Do both yourselves a favour and tell him,” she said, bringing her attention back to John. “Might not get the chance again.”
Something cold and wooden met his inner thigh and he found himself tensing as sharp points met the outside of his anus. At the thought of the object it entering him, which he came to realize was the broken leg of the chair he had shattered earlier, his breath caught and he shut his eyes. However, there was a momentary reprieve when a pair of footsteps approached.
On the ceiling, a lone light hung down, drenching the cement walls in a low, orange light. The room held few items: what appeared to be a blood-soaked mattress sat in the far-right corner, which was butted against a set of pipes. A metal door at the South end of the windowless room was opened, leading into a dark hallway that seemed to curve in every which way. In the centre of the room was a loan wooden chair with steel d-rings bolted to the ground around it. Attached to the rings were chains, which were connected to shackles around the wrists and ankles of a young detective.
He trailed behind Foss as they went through and exited the precinct. It did not take long to return to the hospital with Foss turning on the lights to the police car, allowing them to pass through even the heaviest traffic with a bit more ease. The officer tried to keep the conversation between them light, asking about Sherlock’s condition and trying to give John reassurance, things even John knew he was trained to do when dealing with a victim and their close friends or family. Even though he understood why, John’s answers were short, predominately limited to one-word answers, rather having the drive be in silence, than feeling obliged to speak.
There was a snort from the American, who was clearly still by the camera and not the one holding the broken leg by his cavity.
“No. No – no – no – Sherlock, don’t you dare,” he spoke in haste, leaning back on his heels. He gripped the sides of the man’s shirt on his breast, pulling it apart, the buttons popping off in random directions as his chest was bared. Lacing his fingers overtop each other, he began pressing the heel of his palm over Sherlock’s breastbone. “You can’t leave me like this, you bastard, come on.” Using his own bodyweight, he started compressions, eyes on Sherlock’s face, waiting for a semblance of life.
“So incessant, John,” he said as he shut his book and sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the couch. “I could do with some nutrients, I suppose.”
Serial killers who planned out their dump sites would not travel too far from their hunting grounds – the places they felt comfortable with. Even a group as dangerous as Cielo Diablos would not be willing to travel outside of their comfort zones – places they believed the police and investigators would not look.
Before she left, she turned back to the military veteran. “John.” He turned to look at her. “Even Freak deserves someone to love him, it might as well be you.” With that, she turned on her heel, leaving the Army doctor to his thoughts.
Sherlock’s eyes trailed from their hands to the doctor’s face, mind at work as it was clearly studying the expression. His gaze moved from John to the closed laptop, then back to the table. At the objects upon it, his brows furrowed.
The sound of sirens echoed as Donovan pulled up the patrol car to the front of the building, before she shut them off, ensuring Lestrade’s attention. The impatience exuded from the car, leaving Lestrade to sigh while John appeared on the edge of breaking.
. Reflex had him try to pull his hand close, but given that the man did not release his grip, Sherlock found himself staring into the dark eyes of his captor. Before he could attempt another strike, a sharp pain shot through his knee as the man kicked his knee in, forcing it to bend the opposite direction. With a cry of distress, he hit the floor, his kneecap now bulging beneath the skin.
“He’s the one who drugged him,” John could hear himself saying to the personnel refusing to release their grip.
“Sherlock Holmes is the “greatest good” that has ever happened to any one of us. If you’re trying to tell me you’ll let your own flesh and blood go through that and do
His head was dropped and it hit the mattress with a padded thud, forcing the pressure back to his dislocated shoulder. His rectum contracted as the liquid dripped down his perineum to his scrotum. The light of the American’s mobile camera had become so frequent, he no longer grimaced at the photographs it took, so when the white flashed against the wall and piping, he paid it no heed, his eyes staring into nothingness at the wall to his left.
“They mentioned a man by the name of Francis,” John said, glancing to Lestrade. “Didn’t get a last name, but it’s better than nothing.” He spoke in confidence, as though he was talking to his best mate about a trivial case. “There was a Cleary, as well. I think he has a problem keeping secrets, since I told that American bastard I knew him. He didn’t seem surprised.”
He watched as his brother’s body jerked when the electricity met his heart. After checking for a pulse, the medical officer started again with chest compressions. Any form of composure Mycroft held onto melted away as his eyes turned red and warm liquid met the sides of his face. The hand of Lestrade was on his shoulder, trying to give any form of comfort, though it failed to register. He could vaguely hear John making comments that Sherlock “better wake up” and that he would “kill him for leaving” him. Donovan was still trying to calm him down, telling him to let the emergency personnel work as he continued to fight against her.
“I’ve tried everything,” Mycroft spoke, his eyes darting in front of him as though searching for something unknown and unaware of where he stood and who stood by him. “They never intended to release Sherlock and I don’t know what to do.”
Sherlock shook his head, pressing into the mattress. John watched him, wondering if he had fallen back to sleep. Instead, Sherlock turned to look at the windows and the sunlight flooding in, as though welcoming the light he had not seen in days. The sight had John drop his shoulders. With the light reflecting from his best friend’s features, he could see the true destruction the abduction had wrought: his eyes were sunken, skin pale, yet splotched with patches of red and purple, his cheekbones poking from underneath the skin. For the next few minutes, John said nothing as he watched the younger man. The one thing Sherlock never did was stay silent, always commenting about something that no normal person would notice. His silence spoke louder than anything John had ever heard from him before.
Seeing the fortitude and apprehension hidden behind the professional façade, it was a favour he knew the eldest Holmes needed and would take regardless if it was given. The time frame Mycroft had spoken had him curious as to what the other man had planned, but it was better left unanswered. With a nod of the head, Mycroft turned on his heel to ascend the steps leading to the ornate door that had partially rotted, its flaws covered with black spray paint. The door was slightly ajar, kept open with a small block of wood. He pushed the door open and stepped inside, leaving the block in place as the closed made a barely audible
“Are you going to sit there all day?” John Watson’s voice cut through the silence of 221B Baker Street. He stared with annoyance blatant on his features, to which his flatmate and friend, Sherlock Holmes, dutifully ignored. John pursed his lips, exhaling forcefully as he gave Sherlock the same look he always gave when the young genius was driving him mad.
If that were the case, then there was a strong possibility that their base was not too far from where the van had been pulled from the river.
“Did you catch that?” Lestrade asked as he touched the pad on the laptop, scrolling the video back a bit.
Adrenaline coursed through him as he came closer and the presence of pedestrians dwindled to naught. He was only a few feet from the address, outside of a building that was long rundown with boarded windows and neon graffiti, when he stopped short, scanning the exterior. Military training taking over, he made a note of the possible entry and exit points, including windows that could easily be broken through in case of an emergency escape.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Myrcroft said as he shook his head, eyes scanning his younger brother up and down. “Look what you’ve allowed to occur.” His expression was that of disgust, causing Sherlock to look down, only to see the front of his shirt and trousers soaked with white liquid. “You’ve had all these men touch you, you can’t possibly believe that none of it’s a fault of your own, can you?”
The name “Frankie” sunk into Sherlock’s head. Yet, as his brain filed it away, he wondered why he even bothered marking it something to be remembered.
Lestrade turned to John, who had also appeared to relax somewhat out of the eldest Holmes’ presence. “Have you gotten word?” he asked, to which John’s shoulders dropped as he shook his head. “Least that explains why the cavalry arrived so fast,” he commented in regard to the eldest Holmes, garnering a small snicker.
“You’ll never touch him again,” his voice was low into the man’s ear, who continued to beat on the arms restraining him. With his jaw taut, John reached a crossroads: whether to allow the man to pass out or to break the weak structure of the neck. As his morality spoke to him, the image of seeing the man ramming himself into Sherlock over and over with complete disregard overran any compassion he might have held onto and every bit of his background took over.
The chain that had once connected the shackles to the d-rings on the floor around the chair was now connected to the L-shaped bend of the pipes near the mattress, which was roughly three-feet from the floor. On the opposite end of the chain was Sherlock, who was facing the pipes with his hands restrained behind his back, keeping his upper body from the mattress and arms twisted at an odd angle as his knees dug into broken springs. The way he was chained, if he dropped his body, both shoulders would dislocate, forcing him to hold tension. The dislocated knee was bent awkwardly, causing a shooting pain any time he shifted even slightly or any form of pressure was placed upon it; but it was a pain he could easily block out.
“You were the woman who ran into us,” he reiterated, clearly upset as Lestrade came up, curious to the commotion going on. Her nerves seemed wracked, her gaze adverted downwards. “Where’s Sherlock? What did you do?”
John found himself having to fight to reel back his emotions. Sherlock was referring to the night he was taken – when John had requested Sherlock join him to the restaurant he had held a reservation. John shook his head, forcing a smile. “No. We’ll be on time.” He ran his thumb over the Sherlock’s knuckles, his friend attempting to nod his head.
Sherlock was hooked up to an electrocardiograph keeping track of his heart, a vitals monitor that was measuring his oxygen levels, blood pressure, arterial oximetry, and an intravenous needled administering fluids. Seeing him attached with so many wires had John clenching his jaw and biting back the desire to perform his own analysis, though he knew Sherlock was in the best capable hands. Yet, it was not the various chords that kept him from entering, but who he saw in the room, running their fingers through his best mate’s hair.
“I’m sorry, John,” he came out with, his voice distant. Though he expected a form of malice, there was none. Instead, he could only watch through his broken body as John came to kneel beside him and set his hand on his head as his other reached for the younger man’s hand. His being broke and he found himself reliving the unfamiliar emotion. Inhaling sharply, with John’s fingers running through his hair, he could barely say, “Please…stay with me.”
It was made even more difficult by Sherlock’s determination to leave the flat at any given opportunity, despite being bound by either crutches or, his least favourite, a wheelchair. While the soles of his feet had healed enough to allow pressure, the rest of the external damage would take longer to heal. John had to continuously bribe him into using the chair around the flat, instead of using the walls and furniture to support himself as he hobbled about. Though using either proved its struggle. While Sherlock had regained nearly full strength in his right arm, the splint on his left wrist was still a hindrance on either version of mobility he chose to utilise.
Sherlock fell silent, brows creasing as his eyes searched his brother’s face, studying and analysing every minute change in expression and posture. Being under his own brother’s questioning scrutiny, Mycroft felt himself fall apart. In some way, he always hoped that if the memory was never mentioned, it would somehow fade into the distance. It had been a silly thought. Neither of their brains ever allowing something like that to disappear – to becoming nothing more than a flickering shadow.
“Three minutes, Detective,” Mycroft said, making eye contact as his left brow rose. “Give me three minutes before anyone comes through the front.” It was more of an order than it was a suggestion, one which Lestrade seemed to accept, going against protocol.
With that said, he pushed off from Mycroft, staring at him and his apathetic countenance. Forgoing his instinct, he turned on his heel, footsteps heavy as he walked away.
The Irishman raised his brow and looked down. “Thing’s still got half-a-charge.” Dreln’s response was silence and eye contact. The other shook his head, clearly annoyed. “Fine. Sure you wanna keep him out like this?” he asked, referring to Sherlock as he pressed down on the genius’s shoulder again, getting the same reaction as before.
“After the incident involving the Rocephin, extra precaution was necessary,” Mycroft said as he entered the room approached the bed, which garnered a knitted brow from his sibling. John felt a pang of guilt in his chest at the reminder he had not told Sherlock of the threat on his life while he was unconscious. However, at the same time, realising that Mycroft had been made aware ignited a fire of anger that overrode the guilt. “Doctor Watson.”
As the third cut drew, he could no longer hold back and began shouting as he tried to pull the man’s arm away.
Lestrade looked down at his mobile, expecting a list. Instead, it was a notification from their tech-analyst, saying there had been another video upload. Heart thudding in his chest, he unlocked his phone and clicked on the link provided in the text.
“I’m sorry,” she said hastily, her hands reaching to grab the strap of the satchel around her shoulder. “My friend heard the radio this morning and…I think you were looking for me.” Her grip tightened on the strap, gaining looks from both the sergeant and doctor.
Sherlock paused, his gaze focused on the expression he had come to know of his best friend – the look of concern met with confusion. The reminiscence of John’s reaction after Sherlock’s faked suicide ran through his mind. He had caused John so much pain over the years. Why the man had stayed with him through it all was something the young genius could not comprehend. All he wanted to do was apologise – to tell John, “Sorry…I’m sorry.”
Pants and grunts filled the room, along with the sound of skin slapping skin, tapping and conversation.
“No, I’m honest with you. If you can’t trust your best mate, then I don’t know what else to tell you,” he said with an air of nonchalance. When Sherlock failed to respond, John shrugged. “I’ll leave you to dress. I’m going to enjoy breakfast and a fresh cup of coffee. You’re more than welcome to join me when you’ve finished.”
Donovan finally got out, “There are police already canvasing the area,” annoyed at not only having been talked over for the last few seconds, but also having a now-civilian essentially telling them how to do their jobs.
Though his mind told him otherwise, he found himself opening his mouth, taking in the other’s erection, which became thicker as the warm saliva met it. It only took a few thrusts for it to reach its full size, which was promptly shoved down his throat. As the feeling came back into his left arm, he found himself trying to grab at something – anything – as his breath left him. While his only useful limb pounded, beat and clawed as the man’s back and leg, Dreln held the position, groaning in overexaggerated bliss.
I fought with myself on which one to do, but after all the foreshadowing, I decided this was the best course of action.
Lestrade sighed, his hands going to his hips as he looked around the scene. “That’s where we’re having an issue. There’s one set of tyre marks going into the water, no shoeprints anywhere leaving or arriving. Chances are they put the van in drive, used something to weigh on the treadle and let it roll into the river.”
“Charnock Plumbing is decent from what I’ve heard,” Sherlock said, to which the man made a verbal acknowledgement. “A bit expensive, but I doubt that’d be much of a problem. All Trades London is a bit cheaper, if you’d rather.”
“Great, you’ve done that,” Donovan said as Lestrade brought his phone from his ear. “Now can we please go to the bar and do something that will actually find the freak of nature?”
The sound of boots on concrete drew his attention to the door in front of him. Squinting, he looked up to see a shadowed figure walking down the hallway. Between the pounding headache and aftereffects of whatever he had been drugged with, his vision was blurred; so when the figure came to a stop inside the room, all he could see was the blurry silhouette of a man. He blinked a few times, trying to focus.
John found himself smiling. “If it’s the smell that bothers you, I’ll have a bath in the morning; but, Sherlock, you’re smelling much worse, and I very highly doubt you’ll allow a sponge bath.”
“An’ give up a shot a’ tha real Sherlock Holmes? I’ve been wantin’ ta do this for a long time.” He ran his hands up further, before he leaned in further to try to press his mouth against the young genius’. Sherlock pulled his head away, leaving the man to make contact with the side of his mouth. His breath smelled acidic, as though the man had gone several days without sustenance, instead only relying on whatever drugs to fuel him.
The commotion attracted the attention of one of the nurses passing by and she ran into the room, calling for John to release her co-worker, her voice panic-stricken. As the man tried pushing against John’s face to get him to let go, John kept the pressure, even ensuring to press harder, his jaw taught and expression unreadable as he stared into the man’s fearful eyes. It was only a moment later when there were arms around the military doctor, pulling him away from the hospital worker, who collapsed the floor, coughing and sucking in breath-after-breath as his hands grasped at his throat.
Eyebrows knitting together, it was apparent Dreln was studying John. Inwardly, the Army doctor tensed, wondering if the foreigner had realized who he was. What could have only been a few seconds seemed to turn into minutes as the American released an aggravated sigh.
Dreln stood leaning against the tripod, which the camera was once again attached to, tapping away on his phone as three others were in the midst of setting down layers of large plastic tarps on the floor. Each of them were suited in white protective suits and gloves. Once the tarps were set down, they lifted the body from where it lay on the concrete and moved it to the centre of the tarp, spreading the limbs in a star formation. Using the top layer of plastic, they wrapped each individual limb before wrapping the torso and head.
The animosity John had been feeling towards Mycroft dwindled, regret seeping into his chest at his outbursts and belief that Sherlock’s own brother cared naught of his own blood. The way Mycroft spoke, it was beginning to become clear that the government official had been negotiating for his brother’s safe return the moment he was made aware of the abduction. His flippant demeanour had started to make sense. Probabilities were that he had been making the group proposals that had not been – and would not have been – approved; propositions that could have had him incarcerated if they had been found out or accepted.
Lestrade was in the midst of speaking to one of the crime scene officers, going over what evidence that had been destroyed and the bit that was recovered. The longer the conversation went on, the more the detective inspector’s apprehension grew, his brow line ever creasing. When another SOCO approached them with another recovery, Lestrade stared at him, his expression unreadable as he nodded. As the two crime scene officers went over their finds, Lestrade excused himself.
Almost immediately, Sherlock began jerking against the chains and shackles that held him. The chair scratched on the floor in the few centimetres it could move as the young genius tried whatever he could to get away, but was unable. With the pouring being slow, the experience of drowning was extended, causing Sherlock to become erratic, his body spasming more with each second. It was not until the jug was half empty when the water stopped and the cloth was removed from his face, revealing a coughing, sputtering and gagging Sherlock.
It was because of that calm, yet broken reaction why Lestrade and Mycroft concealed the information of another video – the video that featured footage brutal enough to have police restrain Mycroft from performing an act they knew they would be unable to account for to both the investigators and the government – information that he had been made privy to before Dreln was hauled away, but something he never thought to witness. After viewing the video, even Lestrade was barred from entering the same room as the American, knowing fully well even he would be unable to contain himself.
And I mean watch and study the episode (or at least just Mycroft and his reactions, expressions and the like.
“Oh, I’m sure he did. Someone that high up? If he doesn’t know when his brother wanks off, I’d be surprised.” He released a breath, his eyes trailing to Sherlock. “We’re moving a bit ahead of schedule, but so be it.” He walked up to Sherlock, his expression unreadable when he ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair and down his cheek. “My men are gonna love you, Mr. Holmes. You’re already the topic of conversation.”
The man laughed and clapped his hands. “I thought my accent was pretty spot-on, to be honest. But leave it to a professional detective to call me out on it.” Once he spoke normally, Sherlock placed it in the Americas, most likely Southwestern if he had to pick a quadrant based on the Americans he has heard. His phone buzzed and he held it up, reading and responding to whatever text he had received.
“Rather walk into a minefield,” he said with a forced smile as the sergeant took her cuffs from their holster on her belt.
“A falsified passport, using the identity of a Christopher Matthews, who was pronounced dead due to an overdose on cocaine two years prior.” Lestrade rolled his eyes in aggravation, while John pursed his lips, body tensing. Inhaling, Mycroft pocketed his phone before standing straight. “I do believe a new video has been uploaded to SKS. Perhaps we can gain further insight of Sherlock’s location.”
Sherlock nodded, his gaze still distant. John smiled and leaned forward, brushing their lips together. The action had drawn Sherlock out from whatever hole he had managed to crawl into and his hand reached up to grab John’s. There was a moment’s pause between them as they stared into each other before Sherlock shut his eyes and reinitiated the kiss. It was awkward and unfocused, but, for next minute, they took solace in the comfort they had not realised they had become so accustomed to throughout the years.
Even with everything against him, he found his one regret to be something he had never – and would never – openly admitted. Something he had not even admitted to himself until it became too late.
Despite the Holmes brother’s constant spatial awareness, he failed to see John approaching, even when John stood mere feet away. He cleared his throat, but still went unnoticed. He pursed his lips together, cocking his neck to get a better look at Mycroft’s expression and what was causing one of the men who observed everything to observe nothing. The longer John watched him, the more curiosity and concern waved over him: the look on the eldest Holmes’ face had changed from confusion to fear, apprehension and overall loss.
Once in the office, Donovan was leaning over the chair that the young woman now sat in. The sergeant motioned to the computer and Lestrade strode over to put in his passcode. He stepped back and gave the young woman free range, glancing up only to motion for John to close the door. The woman typed the site into the address bar.
White shots of light began flashing before his eyes as the physical contact began to distance itself.
He tried to get his mind right, tried to focus on anything other than the humiliation, but his brain would not allow him. All he could focus on was the moment and the pressure mounting in his lower abdomen.
“C’mon, Sherlock,” he said in a moan, pressing the head of his penis against Sherlock’s lips. “Use that pretty mouth again.”
“Mycroft,” he started, which instantly had Mycroft stand straighter, his brother having yet to call him by name. “Do you recall the night you came home from university?” He did not need to specify the date, Mycroft knowing what Sherlock was referencing.
I have been working on this, but a lot of stuff has gone down in my personal life, so my desire to actually work on anything has been naught.
Sherlock moved his mouth in a mocking mimicry. It seemed to work, however, and he picked it back up. It was gone in two bites, the eldest saying nothing until his brother acted appropriately. Sherlock gave him a condescending look when he picked up the yogurt. Mycroft raised his brows, his lips creasing in approval at their corners. After a few minutes, Mycroft broke the silence.
The man appeared to have realized he had been recognized, whereas he became aggressive and grabbed Sherlock’s arm, ready to inject the medication directly into the young man’s vein.
The camera used in the video shook as it was taken off the tripod and moved closer to the semen dripping out of Sherlock’s rear. His right cheek was gripped and spread, followed by the American’s voice with, “Mycroft, if you want in on this, give me a call.” The camera was turned, showing the face of the speaker, a smirk on his features. “You know how to find me.”
Sensing another presence, Dreln looked up from his mobile, staring up at John. His expression was curious, as though he was trying to understand where he recognized John. At the same moment, John’s initial reaction was to bring the man to knees, forcing him to make amends with everything he had done to his partner. Just as quickly, the understanding that causing such a commotion would draw the attention of the man upstairs.
If they had not already, he had to tell them to search the area – even if Donovan and them would have refused and rebutted, believing it to be a wild goose chase, he knew that Lestrade would do anything and everything to find the young man he had watched after for so long.
The man stepped over the body, which was now missing its head, both arms and one leg, unlocking his phone and bringing it to his ear.
How had he not realized the people assigned to Sherlock’s room seemed different – how they carried themselves? how they spoke? how they seemed to be more apt to deal with Sherlock’s personality than most normal people? Mycroft’s print was over everything and John had still been blind until it was staring him in the face.
He had coffee started before returning to the living room. The sound of the shower running could be heard, signalling that Sherlock was already awake. He was half-tempted to knock on the door to alert him of his presence; yet, when his eyes caught the letter again, he figured to wait a few minutes. He picked up the letter on the table, releasing a chuckle at reading Lestrade’s note.
Sherlock would force himself to try and recover quickly, which would have more lasting damage than if he would allow himself to experience the full and complete stages. Then again, who was John to judge? He was as equally stubborn when it came down to it.
“How trite,” Sherlock scoffed as he rolled his eyes, John breathing out a laugh. The genius’ attention fell back on where John’s hand covered his own. Expecting a comment, John was taken aback when Sherlock came out with, “My arm’s numb.”
“Oh, my god. You’re Sherlock Holmes,” she said, entire face beaming. Her breath appeared to catch in her throat and she moved to look at John. “And you’re Doctor Watson. I follow all the cases on your blog, and I think you two are fabulous.”
Before John could respond, their attention was drawn to the clicking and opening of the door near the opposite end of the room.
Before either man could respond, the woman scuttled off, knocking into both of them as she ran down the sidewalk. Sherlock was snickering, while John was trying to refrain from calling after her about not being in a relationship. John looked at him in disbelief, as though expecting some form of back-up. When Sherlock gave none, John pursed his lips in annoyance and began walking again, speeding up his pace in an attempt to put distance between them for the moment.
As he turned back to the door and placed his hand on the handle, he could hear the foreign man urging his ally to stand up as they both shuffled to their feet. He waited until he heard their steps on the tile moving towards the entrance before pulling the door open. Inside the room stood the very man he had been promised.
He watched as Sherlock’s ever-prying eyes had gone from focused to unfocused, his mind losing itself in the memory, reanalysing it from various perspectives.
The certainty Sherlock spoke with, each phrase shot into John’s chest. Sherlock was a strong individual, one who had not been swayed by being an outcast his intellect had brought. Yet, here he was, apologizing for things John had never given a second thought. Even he knew the way Sherlock was around him was his own insecurity. His ability to read people had him called a “freak” most of his life; but for John, it was nothing but admiration. It was never something Sherlock needed to apologize over. Prior to meeting the young genius, all John had waited for was the embrace of Death. The fact that he had survived so much, it only proved to him that he still had a reason for being.
“What have you found?” he asked the moment his phone was to his ear. A moment’s pause was followed with, “Quite right. In twenty.” There was an audible
The trolley was two doors from Sherlock’s room when John walked in, the smell causing his stomach to rumble. He would have to go to the cafeteria to get food for himself after ensuring his mate would eat his own breakfast.
Sherlock’s headspace focused in and out, the mounting pressure in his lower stomach being the only thing that would continually drag him back to reality. He had attempted to take his mind’s advice, but was finding a face to be difficult. At one point, he had imagined the person by his rear to be Mycroft, which took him several attempts to banish before guilt set in that he had imagined his brother at all. John was next, which somehow did make everything a bit more tolerable, even if his mind was in constant dispute.
Every rebuttal came to his forethought, but as he searched for a response, his brain could find none. The only thing he could get out was a stuttering, “But I don’t – Sherlock doesn’t—”
“I doubt it.” He cocked his head, inspecting the other’s features as his fingernails dug into Sherlock’s cheek. “Though you do look a bit too clean for their liking. So why don’t we try giving a bit of incentive, hm?”
Lestrade stared after him before turning his attention to Mycroft, whose expression was distant, despite wearing his usual mask. He inhaled, shaking his head on the exhale before following after John, failing to notice the flash of concern across the eldest Holmes’ face.
At the question, Lestrade found himself at a loss. There was no sarcasm behind the tone or suspicion that Mycroft had called in for his own proposal in lieu of what Lestrade had already gone through with his team. The last time he had even seen the eldest Holmes, he and Doctor Watson had come to realization that Mycroft knew of his brother’s situation and chosen to do nothing; seeing the man in front of him without any form of backup had him questioning how much they thought they knew.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, look at me – look at me,” despite the panic he felt, his voice came out even and comforting. He turned Sherlock’s head to face him, the other’s eyes not even seeing him. He forced a smile and repeated his actions. “Sherlock, where are you, right now?” The younger man’s mouth began moving slightly, but there was no sound. John had to dip his head down to maintain eye contact, and he saw Sherlock’s begin to glaze. “Come on, Sherlock. Where are you right at this moment?”
John directed his attention to Sherlock, watching as the man’s chest rose and fell, his breathing even. Even with the commotion and his near loss of life, the younger man failed to stir. Donovan was watching the doctor, her gaze stern and almost empathetic.
“We managed to retrace the GPS on Freak’s phone,” Donovan said as she handed the clipped papers to Lestrade, who had returned to the precinct after the scene had been cleared and evidence had been sent off. His eyes scanned the first page right as Donovan pulled the second page over. “There was a ninety-second stop near Ebury Square before they started travelling again, losing signal about where it was recovered this morning.”
“Sherlock, stop – stop – don’t – Sherlock – damn it all,” John pulled back and released a sigh when Sherlock used his good arm to push him away. John dropped his shoulders, his lips in a thin line as he watched the younger man attempting to get out of the hospital bed, one leg on the floor while he fought with the cast upon his opposite knee. With one arm still regaining its strength, and his left wrist donning a brace, watching the young genius fight against his own body to stand was driving John mad. “At least let me help you to the door.”
“Well, don’t destroy him,” interjected another voice, heavy with an Irish accent, as Dreln’s hand began feeling as though it was trying to knock its way to Sherlock’s sigmoid colon. “Don’t want to feel like fuckin’ a sandbag.”
John furrowed his brow as his gaze followed Mycroft, who walked to peer out of the window. “How could they do that exactly?”
In the centre of the room, near the wooden chair and d-rings, stood the figure of Dreln Hargett with the strong stature of his brother Mycroft. The American had his mobile out, his thumb scrolling along the screen as he was apparently showing Mycroft whatever was on it. Judging by the look his brother held, Sherlock knew it was the various images the gang member had taken of him while being captive. Dreln glanced up from the phone. Seeing Sherlock, he smiled and motioned to Mycroft.
Sherlock shook his head. “That woman, I think—” he was cut off, his head falling forward while his body began going limp.
“I appreciate the reminder,” Sherlock’s response was sharp as he made eye contact with Lestrade. It did not last long as Lestrade’s gaze was filled with guilt, causing Sherlock to pull his attention away, focusing back on the tray of food. “I assume you’ve been consulting my brother, at the very least. Even if my first-hand knowledge would be more valuable.”
The glance from Cruz was apparent, despite the foreigner attempting to hide it as he went back to staring at the wall when John turned to face the room. He acted to scan the room before his eyes landed on Cruz, whose jaw was visually clenched, forearms on his elbows and eyes focused ever forward.
Sherlock scoffed, not at all phased by his brother’s actions. Whether it was the high or the fact that it was Mycroft of all people was left to be determined. “Still know more than you, obviously.”
“If they know they have my attention, they will do worse to him,” Mycroft’s voice invaded his thoughts, having him turn to look at him.
The demeanour of the man suddenly changed and he grabbed Sherlock’s throat, gripping tight enough to stop blood flow. “Keep this up and you’ll end up in pieces scattered around the fucking country before the sun comes up, got it?” With the blood pounding in his ears and face turning a dark red, Sherlock failed to respond, causing the man to grip tighter. “Got it?!”
John had watched during the initial broadcast as several members were filmed by news reporters as they were escorted out of a large house in Kensington. He had heard from Lestrade how many hundreds of kilos worth of drugs were found in the home, and the house was only one of several. Neither one of them vocalised it, but they knew had it not had been for their abduction and assault of Sherlock, it would have been months before the cartel’s dismantlement in the countries came to a head.
He was currently held up in Lestrade’s office, his mobile on his lap, in hopes to hear something. The detective inspector came in late that morning, most likely for the same reason John had not slept. When he did come in, his eyes were hooded, he spoke in slurs and his being overall exuded fatigue. He barely acknowledged John as he walked to his office and unlocked the door. John asked if he had heard anything, to which the answer was “no”, before he was asked the very same question, giving the same response.
Mycroft sighed and approached him, his eyes staring into his younger brother’s. He brought his hand up, holding Sherlock’s cheek. After a sympathetic look, he leaned down, giving the detective a small kiss on his forehead before pulling back, gazing into his eyes.
Before either official could get a word out edgewise, John was speaking in haste, which had both investigators at a loss for words, exchanging confounded expressions. After he told them to search the surrounding buildings and their sub-levels, it took a moment of both investigators trying to interrupt him.
“Damn, Sherlock,” came the voice of the American – Dreln – followed by a laugh. “How do you think Mycroft’ll feel seeing his little brother so loose?” Sherlock felt a finger enter his rectum, followed by two more digits. “Fuck…I could probably fit my whole hand in there.” The comment was met by a fourth finger, making Sherlock tense. When a thumb entered him, Dreln followed up with, “I’d love to stick my dick in there, but I don’t fuck whores – might catch something.”
Here he had the option of how to die, and while neither leaned towards how he expected, he knew when to accept a better proposal.
Two men entered the room, one donning brown cargo pants and black tank-top, the other in dark-washed jeans and white button-up. Unlike the people Sherlock had been introduced to, neither of them had track marks on their arms, nor were their eyes reflecting any form of drug use. The way they carried themselves, for the first time, had Sherlock feel threatened. There was the speculation that it was not they who listened to the man Sherlock had first met, but had most likely received orders from higher up – perhaps even the runner of whatever group Mycroft had managed to gain the attention of.
Mycroft stood by the bed, his eyes staring sadly at his younger brother’s features, his mouth moving, words inaudible. John watched as Mycroft pushed Sherlock’s hair back from his face and leaned down, giving a soft kiss on his brother’s forehead. Sensing that he was seeing something he should not have been, John stepped back from the doorway, allowing Mycroft the privacy with Sherlock the eldest Holmes needed.
With the finished word, John gazed at him intently, but wound up rolling his eyes as Sherlock turned yet another page. “Well, then I don’t know about you, but I’m starving, and since you threw out my roast to house someone’s leg in the fridge—”
Before anyone could react, both Lestrade and Donovan had their weapons drawn onto the male nurse – Frank – who immediately went onto the defence, his hands going up as he pressed himself against the wall John had once had him had him pinned.
“What are you giving him?” John asked as the nurse pressed the needle of the syringe into the sealed cap of the liquid, filling the syringe.
John comes to terms with his feelings towards his best mate, as Sherlock battles his own inner demons.
After she left, Sherlock stared blankly at his feet, his mind elsewhere. John had set his hand on his mate’s knee, running his thumb over the skin as his brows furrowed up. Sherlock’s eyes had grown distant as his breath hastened. While his expression had not changed, his eyes had grown red along with the rest of his face.
“Please tell me he’s with you,” John said, referring to Sherlock as his eyes darted between Lestrade and Donovan. When he saw their expressions, his entire body dropped. “We have to find him. There was a woman.” He fell into Donovan as his head swam, recalling the young woman who claimed to be a fan when she ran into them. He held his head and pulled back from her, wobbling slightly as he stood, regaining his sense of balance. “There was a woman who came up to us and I think she somehow managed to drug Sherlock,” he finally spoke coherently.
A groan escaped Sherlock’s mouth as his hair was pulled and more warm liquid filled him. His rectal cavity throbbed from the abuse, while nail marks and bite marks littered his lower and upper back. Even though he had made several attempts to escape reality while it was happening, he found his efforts failing. Each time he tried, he found himself in Mycroft’s office, being guilt-tripped for what he logically knew was not of his own culpability.
The description he gave was fairly vague, but it was the most he recalled and was able to give for the police to put a bulletin for anyone fitting her appearance.
For a moment, Sherlock shut his eyes and allowed himself to sink into the mattress. “Why are you still here?” he asked without opening his eyes. As though expecting the curious look John was giving him, he followed up with, “You’ve been here for two days. I may be stuck here, but there’s no reason you should still be here.”
It was not long before John took out his laptop. The first page to pop up was a news headline reporting more on the drug trafficking ring, listing more members. The same three pictures were at the top of the article of Francis Bellman, Dreln Hargett and Emilia Hernandez. Seeing the face of the American caused a flare of anger in John’s chest. Sherlock had gone quiet and when John glanced at him, his mate’s eyes were trained on the same photo, jaw taught and fist clenched as tight as he was able. Focusing back on the laptop, he scrolled down, getting the images off the screen as he set his other hand on Sherlock’s, grounding him. Sherlock commented on the article leaving out information about members of Scotland Yard having been discovered in the ranks, seeming to ignore the contact, but John was acutely aware of his fist relaxing.
She was nervously grasping at the hem of her dress, requesting to see either Sergeant Donovan or Detective Lestrade. One of the officers dismissed her; yet, when John saw her through the blinds of Lestrade’s office, he got up and scrambled through the precinct, grabbing the young woman’s arm.
Seeing John, he made his way over. When his gaze trailed to Mycroft, who stood a few feet away with his attention on the van, he unconsciously tensed, something even John picked up on, to which he glanced between the two before focusing solely on the inspector.
I can't specify, but something has happened in my personal life to the point I've gone from writing to reading.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” he cut the eldest Holmes off as he brought his mobile down, pressing the button to end the call.
There was a laugh. The man had finally entered the screen, walking up to Sherlock right before he hit the detective across the face. He grabbed the front of Sherlock’s button-up.
Ensuring that no one was in the hall, Sherlock made his way down, ears on alert for any sound that he himself did not make. When the low light from the room could no longer penetrate through the hall, Sherlock was left in complete darkness, leaving his fingers to trace along the wall. It was not long until his foot hit a block, causing him to hiss at the pain that radiated through from his toe to his heel.
“You know I can’t do that,” Lestrade said sternly as he watched Sherlock take another bite. “Believe me, I wish I could. But Sherlock, you may not want to accept it, but you are a victim. And a victim cannot be involved in an investigation.”
She fell quiet for a moment, battling with herself on whether or not to respond. After an awkward moment, she said quietly, “I – it’s a Sherlock kink site.” At the expressions she was given – Lestrade’s confusion, Donovan’s disgust and John’s incredulous stare – her face flushed red and she shook her head. “No – no – no! It’s not like that! It’s all fake, nothing’s real!” She looked down at her feet, gripping the strap tighter. “It’s where people write stories and draw and dress up. No one on the site actually wants to see or hear about the real Sherlock Holmes getting hurt. That’s not what it’s about,” she said frantically. “But this morning…someone uploaded a video and no one on the site thinks it’s a fake. A lot of people were saying to report it, but I don’t know if anyone has.”
The lack of urgency in their voice bode well, and when he led Lestrade to the person they found, the detective-inspector immediately recognized him as the man from the second video. Finding a lack of heartbeat, Lestrade could not help but feel a sense of satisfaction, though he did not let on, despite the question biting at him about who the person behind the man’s demise could have been. The man’s neck was still red, suggestion the cause of death to be strangulation, and the positioning of the body was meant for it to go unnoticed. Had it not have been for the situation, he could have been mistaken as sleeping.
There was another pause over the line before Mycroft fell out with, “John, do not confront them,” his voice strict and commanding. “They will—”
Sherlock said nothing, his focus on where their hands met. John’s grip relaxed when he felt Sherlock’s hand move. While he had thought Sherlock was attempting to move his hand away, he was, instead, trying to turn his hand over. Once his palm was up, his long fingers tried to grip John’s. It was weak, something that apparently aggravated the younger man, the touch so light it was not even able to indent the skin on John’s hand. Sensing the brunet’s frustration, John gave it a tight grip.
His last print on the earth would be of him being beaten and violated by multiple men, his limbs scattered throughout various places around the country. The only thing he found himself hoping was that he would already be dead before they began the dismemberment, though judging by the Irishman’s actions, it was unlikely.
“Facial recognition picked up this man,” Mycroft said as he showed Lestrade and John a mugshot of the American from the video on his mobile. “Dreln Mathias Hargett: born in Houston, Texas and arrested for simple possession of narcotics throughout his adolescence. Was given to foster care at the age of thirteen, when he became involved with Cielo Diablos as a falcon before rising to their version of a lieutenant. Despite being on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s watchlist in the United States, he managed to obtain a passport to leave the country.”
“Do you still believe that after all these years?” Mycroft asked, turning to face him as he leaned against the desk, crossing his arms. The expression he gave was the of condescension. “If that were true, little brother, then why did you enjoy it?”
Survival be damned, he inhaled and finally opened his eyes, glancing sideways to make eye contact. Every fibre of his being was screaming at him, but he knew it to be for naught and he found himself nodding, his facial expression giving way.
Almost immediately, Sherlock came-to, coughing and choking, though nothing came up. He began sucking in breath-after-breath when his body came to the realization it could breath once again. While his fit went on, the unmasked man moved to grab the camera off of the apparent-tripod. He focused it on Sherlock’s face, who had turned from red to a dark purple as the coughs went on. When the young detective had finally stopped coughing and leaned his head back, his breath haggard, the camera zoomed in close to his mouth, seeing his tongue drop to the bottom of his jaw as the back of his throat opened completely to allow more airflow.
“The world would end before then, so we should cut this short,” Sherlock said, getting his mind right to block out the pain.
“John, go home,” Lestrade said, his voice comforting, yet stern. “Let us work. We will find him – I won’t have it any other way.”
Inhaling, John turned to him and watched him for a moment before asking, “Want to go to the zoo tomorrow?”
Sherlock turned back to the door, which was now closed. Turning back to John as the military veteran began typing an update, Sherlock’s memories began conflicting. The actions that occurred in the sub-level felt as though they were nothing more than a dream, something that he had been awakened from, while the memory faded into his subconscious. From what he recalled, John had a reservation at a local restaurant that evening, yet, he seemed relaxed, as though the night and his time were free. However, at the same time, Sherlock was uncertain as to when he had reached that conclusion, uncertain as to whether John had told him or if he had realized it on his own.
“You have no idea how much I’ve wanted to ram my dick into you – make you feel a real American. Seeing everyone else get to have fun, I could make you feel so much better.” Sherlock did not respond, though a comment hid itself in his mind. He felt Dreln shift and opened his eyes to find the man’s knees on each side of him, his groin close to his face. “But I know you’ve just been wanting to taste me again.” He rubbed himself on Sherlock’s face, who turned his head and shut his eyes, doing his best to ignore the comments and act.
They passed several familiar locations before the cabbie turned onto a street that quickly turned dead. Though the driver was waiting for his customer to comment that they were clearly moving in the wrong direction, his body language spoke volumes when John stayed silent, his eyes tracing over the written list of buildings containing basements.
There was a pause before Sherlock’s eyes glazed and he responded in a soft response, “John.” John nodded again, though Sherlock was still unfocused, his eyes appearing to shake. “I’m sorry,” Sherlock trailed out, his voice distant as he finally met John’s gaze.
“Wha’ tha ‘ell are ya doin’?” There was an odd air of relief at it not being the voice of the man from early that morning – the voice a thick cockney.
With the arrest of Francis Bellman, the Cielo Diablos’ frontrunner in the country, the operation they had tried to form in the limits of London had come to a halt. Scotland Yard had infiltrated and had the operation shutdown by the time the moon had risen, with several members taken into custody. It did not take much longer for the government to become involved and discover another base within the boundaries of Northern Ireland from a loose-lipped individual. After a phone call, the news headlines all across the United Kingdom had exposed the group and their various well-known members. Scotland Yard’s takedown was at the top of the headlines, following with pictures of members in the hierarchy, including Francis Bellman, the American Dreln Hargett and a Mexican woman by the name of Emilia Hernandez they had arrested during the raid in Wales.
“Would’ve drawn too much attention, most likely,” was the response. “Now, unless they had another mode of transportation, it’s unlikely they would have drowned the van and carried a fully-grown man to wherever they’re situated.”
It was awkward to watch Sherlock struggle into the bathroom, but John did not interfere, allowing Sherlock the privacy he knew the young man was desperately craving. It pained him to watch Sherlock walk in an obvious attempt to ignore the discomfort it placed on his stitched arches, but when he made it to the door and closed himself in, John found himself releasing an audible sigh. He sat on the edge of the bed, eyes trailing from the door to his mobile on the chair.
As the medical personnel approached him, he tried to push them away, saying he was fine. “Sherlock.” He clamped his eyes shut, recalling the memory of seeing his friend’s failing state. “Where is he? Greg, Sherlock was with me. He was drugged – where is he?”
“Shall I wait?” the cabbie asked full of sarcasm, expecting to be left with an idling vehicle one again.
Lestrade released a breath. “We found the owner of the van – belonged to an Agatha Delaney…who reported the van stolen a week ago.” The look from John was of concern, while Mycroft’s was that of disinterest. “They—”
“Well, most people are horrible conversationalists. They tend to scream and cry too much, and that just annoys me. But you,” he walked over to Sherlock and crouched down to hold his chin and have him look up, the detective’s expression ever unchanging. “You’re collected – calm. Under different circumstances, you’d probably be my type.”
Lestrade had stopped by as it drifted into the afternoon after having spent the bulk of the morning sitting in interviews in an attempt to locate the others seen in the videos. Even with the prodding and patience dwindling, they made no progress. The only headway was Dreln’s mobile, which was password protected and encrypted to avoid unwanted attention. Their tech analyst was given the phone and had been working on it since the early hours with no success. At a stalemate, their only hope was getting the information from Dreln, who had requested a call to the American Embassy upon entry.
While Lestrade and Donovan entered the bar, John’s eyes caught a familiar stature across the street at the Square as went to follow. He watched the person, ensuring that he was seeing who he thought, and that his eyes were not deceiving him. Turning to see the two investigators approach the bar, appearing to not have even noticed his absence, he made his away across the road.
Once in the room, he moved to the chair, picking it up from its original position and moving back to the doorframe, ignoring his sliced hands. When the man stepped into the doorway, Sherlock swung the chair as hard as he could.
Several police vehicles approached the outskirts of the building, their lights off as they pulled up in silence. Exiting a black car was Detective-Inspector Lestrade and Sergeant Donovan, meeting several officers around the side; others were moving around back so as not to draw any unwanted attention. Clearly on edge, Lestrade scanned the outskirts, as though waiting for another arrival. While he was on lookout, Donovan was giving the information to the officers who had been called last-minute to the address from their patrols around the city.
John’s chest felt tight as his lips formed into a smile, his brows moving upwards. “Do you want a cup?” he asked, keeping his tone light.
“How did you think you’d manage?” he asked as he began ascending the stairs, ignoring the fallen crutches.
Seeing the obvious look of discomfort, they had a silent agreement to not make her feel even more awkward.
Despite his impassive facial expression, the fear behind his eyes was apparent, uncertain of the response. The question caused Mycroft’s heart to drop to his bowels, his own eyes threatening an ill-gotten emotion. He could still remember shoving Sherlock against the wall, how much smaller his little brother had felt beneath him at the time, the curiosity and stubborn determination in his eyes. That same stubbornness melting into panic and fear as Mycroft released all his anger and pent up frustration.
“Something to help me think.” It was the only answer Mycroft needed to know his brother was on a cocaine high. “Though it still doesn’t help me understand human behaviour.”
In the midst of being in a state of confusion, anger and shock, his brain began piecing together where he had seen the man before. Remembering back to the night Sherlock was drugged and abducted, he recalled the man in an argument with who they assumed was his wife over his mobile phone. The way the man bumped into Sherlock, giving him the opportunity to inject him with some form of sedative. If he was a nurse, gaining access to different forms of drugs would have been all too simple, and having a member with such an ease of access would be more than beneficial to the Cielo Diablos.
John knitted his brows together. “For what?” He waited a moment for Sherlock to get his bearings straight, but his partner stayed silent. “Sherlock?” Still, he garnered no response, the younger man’s breaths becoming even once more as he slipped back into unconsciousness. John sighed and moved his hand from Sherlock’s hand to his head. “We’ll talk about apologies later.” With that said, he turned back to his laptop, his expression a mix of confusion and content as he refreshed the page, it updating to a new headline about another arrest.
Mycroft stared at him, his eyebrows moving upwards. “Might I ask why you believe such absurdity?” The reaction in John was apparent. “Doctor Wat—”
The back of the chair was grabbed and Sherlock was pulled from the floor, the chair returning to its original sitting position. Subconsciously, Sherlock tensed when the man leaned down in front of him, placing his hands on Sherlock’s upper thighs, dangerously close to his groin. “Ya really do ‘ave a pretty mouth,” he said, his lips twitching to show yellowing teeth. “Mind if I use it?”
The man’s accent was slight and forced, making the detective realize he was not British, nor part of the United Kingdom. Opening his eyes, they began to focus, albeit slowly.
“Sherlock! Stay with me, come on.” Sherlock’s body fell forward, falling into his shoulder before he was able to say a word. Heart racing, he held his friend with one arm while pulling his mobile phone from his pocket with the other. Yet, before he could dial, he felt a searing pain radiate through his head and neck, his vision going dark.
Even as his heart pounded in his ears and his focus was only on the man now on the floor, flanked by his apparent co-workers, John became acutely aware of the security staff holding him. As security started escorting him from the room, Lestrade and Donovan entered, both overwrought by confusion.
Sherlock’s breath caught as his gaze finally came up to meet the other’s. His pupils began to grow smaller and he drew out, “John.”
As his hand hovered over John’s, he glanced up one more time for confirmation; and when saw nothing but trust and comfort, he set his hand in John’s, the older man taking hold and pulling Sherlock forward into an embrace. As John’s arms wrapped around him, for the first time, a sense of calmness came over him. It was the first time he had realized that whenever John was around, there was a sense of comfort and safety, a sense that had otherwise been foreign to him. Sherlock felt himself melt away, the memories of the basement sinking into the distance.
“Are you attempting to take evidence from a crime scene?” his demeanour was strict, something that came as a surprise.
“Sherlock, wake up. You’re having a nightmare,” he said as he shook him again. He set his other hand on the side of Sherlock’s head and ran it through his matted hair. It was the reminder the young man was still in desperate need of a bath.
Dreln turned to look at the broken man before him, then drew his attention to the chair leg, which had streaks of red down its pattern. It made contact with Sherlock’s face as Dreln wiped it on his cheek, the scent of blood, coitus and urine invading his senses. The American brought the leg back, inspecting it before tossing it off to the side where it clacked on the cement. His attention was back on Sherlock and he leaned over him, setting his hands on both sides of Sherlock’s head.
Before Lestrade could stop him, John had exited the car, steps in haste as he was off to find Mycroft. The detective inspector was after him after slamming the laptop close. He came up on John’s heels right as the man approached the government official standing by the black vehicle they had arrived in.
“Someone called, saying they saw a dark van speeding off and an unconscious man on the ground,” Donovan responded. She waved over to the emergency medical responders, who were just getting out of the ambulance.
The man closed the distance between them and reached down, grabbing Sherlock’s chin and forcing his head up.
The way he spoke to the Irishman – whose last name was Cleary? – as though he could trust the man to stay quiet, had Sherlock curious of their connection.
Pictures of dismembered bodies filled the screen as John scrolled down, reading the methods of torture and mutilations the cartel was apparently known for. “Jesus,” was the only thing he could get out as he ran his hand through his hair, staring at the various photos.
By a set of D-rings was John Watson and Sergeant Sally Donovan, the latter of which was holding John, who was fighting against her. John’s eyes and face were red as water seeped from his tear ducts, his voice screaming for Sherlock. His brother was near the centre of the room, his lips a light shade of blue as two medical personnel were by him, one in the midst of performing compressions between the white pads of the AED.
For the first time, his hands were shaking as he reached down to Sherlock’s carotid artery, feeling for a pulse. Sherlock’s face was bloodied and swollen, dried semen clinging to his hair and cheeks, his lips tinted a light shade of blue. When he failed to pick up a pulse, John could feel his eyes burning.
What made it flare back up was going to see "Crimes of Grindlewald" two weeks ago. After writing a one-shot for that film, my writing muse sprung back to life and I was able to work on this once again.
After the initial compressions, he pinched Sherlock’s nose and met their mouths, breathing into his counterpart’s lungs before quickly going back to pressing in rhythm on his chest. “Please don’t go, please,” he found himself begging as his motions became more erratic and desperate.
Any strength he had left him hours ago and all he could do was allow his body to be manipulated by those around him. He had sworn to himself to not go down without a fight, but all the fight that he held onto vanished as his mind lost the fight against itself.
Most likely one of the abandoned buildings along the south end or a possible port, though the latter seemed unlikely given everyone’s carefree demeanour.
It was apparent the man was on immediate edge, but given John’s nonchalant tone and demeanour, he took another drag before nodding. “Sure,” he responded as he held his cigarette in his mouth and pulled his pack out. Offering one to John, the Army doctor gave it a once-over before putting the end in his mouth. He acted to search his pockets, then gave an exaggerated sigh. “Need a light, then?” The man reached into the pocket of his brown hooded sweatshirt, pulling out his lighter and offering it.
“Do you really think they saw anything?” Donovan asked, walking around the vehicle to her superior’s side as John got out.
“Why would they drive the van into the river, instead of burning it?” John mused, watching Mycroft talk to the photographer. Come to think of it, while he was unaware of names, he had grown familiar with the faces of several crime scene analysts that worked for Scotland Yard and, as he was looking around, came to realize most of the officers did not have that air of familiarity.
As Donovan escorted the young woman to Lestrade’s office, Lestrade looked at John, whose eyebrows were furrowed upwards, apprehension written across his face, though Lestrade was certain his expression mirrored the same.
It took a moment, but Sherlock began to relax when John gave his hand a light squeeze. “I suppose that would be proper,” Sherlock said as his eyes darted away.
doing that.” He shook his head and sat back in the chair, eyes on Sherlock. “Greg, you can’t ask me to do that.”
I would write parts to this in a notebook, and had so many drafts, I didn't know which road I wanted it to go down.
“I’ve caused you nothing but strife,” Sherlock’s voice stayed monotone. “I’ve mocked you, disappointed you, given you no reason to remain in company.” Despite his impassive expression, the redness in his eyes had given way, the line of liquid reflecting the sunlight. “I’m not worth your time, John. I never have been.”
He knew the young genius could withstand more physical pain that most capable people – hell, he had seen his fellow soldiers crack under circumstances he knew Sherlock would handle with ease. Even with this knowledge, he knew Sherlock had his breaking points. As much as the young man always claimed to favour logic over emotion, he was more emotional than even he would ever be willing to admit. Given enough stressors, he would crack. John could only hope they would find him before that point would be reached.
There was a scoff, followed by close steps and a hand on Sherlock’s left buttock. Through his slacks, fingers ran from the bass of his scrotum to his rectum, making his body tense against his will. It was followed up with the band of his pants being gripped before a hand slipped into the band, where the flesh of fingertips began running down his buttocks to his entrance. An unwillingly grunt escaped him as an index finger pressed against him before crossing his boundary. He attempted to block the foreign sensation, yet his body clenched against his will, squeezing the man’s finger.
“Top o’ the morning!” they shouted, their voice bouncing off the walls, increasing the throbbing of Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock suddenly became aware of his own heartbeat and the blood pumping throughout his veins. He closed out of his messages and set the phone on the arm of the chair. His breath hastened without his consent and he grabbed his crutch, stumbling as he stood to make his way to the bathroom. The corners of his vision began twisting upwards, warping the walls as various memories came to the forefront. The memory of urine filling his bowels came on with such ferocity that his stomach released a low growl. He vividly recalled how it felt when it spilled out of him, dripping down his buttocks and thighs, and found himself in desperate need of a wash.
John stared at him in disbelief as Sherlock took a sip from his cup. “You’re joking.” He caught Sherlock’s smirk hidden behind it. “All right,” John sighed leaning back in the chair, eyes focused on his best mate’s features. “But you’re paying the cab and I’m not pushing your chair.”
“I’m fine,” he yelled at the paramedic who was still trying to walk him over to the ambulance. When the young paramedic tried to protest, John cut him off. “I’m a doctor, it’s fine! It’s a minor concussion and I don’t need to go to the hospital to confirm that, now please stop touching me!”
“You’ve had their contact all along?” John’s voice came out tight, a clear attempt at not shouting as Mycroft turned to face him, his phone at his ear.
He was cut off as the rage Mycroft had been fighting against took over and he grabbed the man around his throat, pressing forward until he had him against the desk, his umbrella falling to the floor behind him. “Never speak about Sherlock,” his voice came out haggard. Even with the threat, the amusement failed to fade from Dreln’s face. Instead, he laughed.
Sherlock’s reaction was to pull his head away, but it was merely a failed attempt. “Swallow it,” the voice came out in a raspy command as fingers trailed through his hair. With the motion he was able, Sherlock’s head jarred, his breath releasing from his nasal passages. “Oh, Sherlock…it wasn’t a request.” His nose was pinched shut while the man grabbed the back of his head and forced his length down his throat. Sherlock could only refrain for so long before his throat contracted and he swallowed, the bitter aftertaste left on the back of his tongue.
It appeared that Mycroft was given more information, whereas his shoulders had dropped when he approached them, despite his features reflecting indifference.
Lestrade furrowed his brows, now understanding why there was no secondary vehicle at the scene. The Square was roughly three miles from the flat on Baker Street, and it was rarely empty, and even if it were, it was unlikely the bar across the street would have been. It could have very well meant that a passer-by had been a witness to the young genius being transferred from one vehicle to another without ever realizing what they had seen. Either that or—
“Belongs to you? I marked him, so I believe that means he’s mine,” he laughed as the words had Mycroft’s body language change.
Pulling it from his pocket, the screen only read “Unknown Caller” against a black screen. While he would have ignored it on any other occasion, the situation at hand made him accept the call.
John slipped on the sweater as Donovan peered through the two-sided mirror into the holding cell that held the Mexican man, Raphael Cruz, sitting in one of the bolted down metal chairs, his elbows on his knees as he stared at the wall in front of him. An investigator was standing by as a witness to anything said once John crossed the threshold.
He shook his head, banishing the thought. “I’m waiting on a list of sub-levels near the river.” She nodded, though her expression still read curiosity.
John turned to look at him, giving a nonchalant shrug. “Said he was going to get a pack of fags and would be right back.” The man rolled his eyes, aggravation apparent at the information. Giving another shrug at being waved off, John moved down the hallway.
Finally, Mycroft placed the sealed bag in Lestrade’s open palm; yet, before he released it, said, “If further damage is done, destroying any information that may still be salvageable, I can’t promise London will still be under your ever-watchful eye,” he finished with a calm mien.
But I had the last part written months before I even started this chapter and I just had to lead up to it.
An awkward silence fell across the room as Sherlock returned to prodding at the food with the fork and Lestrade shoved his hands in his pockets. For the next few moments, the only noise filling the room was from the hall outside, with nurses passing and various conversations drifting in and out.
He pulled his arm back and out, Sherlock’s body making a popping sound as the foreign object was extracted. With his upper body on the mattress and his buttocks in the air, Sherlock buried his face into the dirty mattress, hoping he could escape back to his haven. Pain continued to shoot down his right shoulder through his back, while his rectum and abdomen throbbed. With his vision hidden in the darkness, he failed to see the flash of a mobile phone. Shortly after, his hair was grabbed and he was forced to lift his head from the mattress.
Silence fell into the room like a brick, the brunet refusing to look up, not wanting to see the disappointment and pity he knew was on his friend’s face. He did not want to get angry, especially at John of all people; yet, at the recollection of having no control, and believing death would finally claim him, control was something he desperately found himself wanting to cling to.
It had been twenty-four hours since Lestrade had sent an update to John, which either meant they had managed to track down every member of the cartel or that they had decided to keep him out of the loop. While the former would have been more comforting, the latter was understandable.
“You could avoid that if your brother would give a shit,” he said, his thumb scrolling through new messages, seemingly immune to the actions and putrid scent.
As they stood dumbstruck in front of the computer screen, they failed to notice Donovan opening the door, stepping into the room.
“Whoa, hold up!” Cruz called out, cutting John off as he finally jerked his head sideways to stare at him, sitting straight in the chair. “Who said anything about killing him? All we were doing was holding him until Mycroft gave into our demands. That’s it.” John knitted his brows together, misperception blatant. “But that piece of shit clearly didn’t care what happened to his brother, because Francis was constantly bitching about him ignoring his phone calls.”
Sherlock tried using the pole the fluids hung from to support himself as he finally was able to get both feet on the tiled floor. “They’re out their right mind if they think for a second I’m using that,” he said in reference to the bed pan the nurse had set next to the bed earlier that evening.
John jerked his head towards Sherlock, whose eyes were fluttering beneath his lids. Keeping his tone and manner as calm as possible, John set his hand on his Sherlock’s with a light grasp.
Movement caught his attention of a man descending the couple of steps from the front door. Their features struck a familiar chord and it took him a moment to place why. Watching the man light up a cigarette and hit it a few times, the familiarity registered.
,” he said mockingly. “You already know what’s coming, so you might as well play along.” Sherlock locked eyes with him, not responding, his jaw tightening. He handed the cloth to the man in the mask, before being handed a jug of water from the person off-screen.
Meanwhile, John was reviewing what he knew: they had Sherlock in a basement near the river, but the location the sunken van was recovered did not have a building with a basement in the surrounding area. Logic dictated that his mate was held in the closest building with a sub-level, even if it was several kilometres from the dumpsite.
A buzz emanated from the American’s pocket and Sherlock could hear the man’s fingers make contact with the screen as he responded to whatever text he had received. After a sigh, he went back to messing with the camera.
Sherlock’s brows knitted together before he pulled his head to face Mycroft. They made eye contact and, for the first time since Sherlock could remember, he saw a sympathetic gaze staring back at him, eyes red on a borderline.
Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed and John lifted his casted leg onto the mattress, allowing the younger man to position himself in a way he found comfortable. While he was getting situated, John called for a nurse to change the bandages wrapped around his mate’s feet. During the change, Sherlock had made several comments, which had the nurse smile awkwardly as John gave him looks to be quiet, that he should have known better than to put pressure on the freshly-stitched wounds.
John found himself supporting Sherlock’s full weight as he escorted the man to the ground, his back sliding down the building. Once on the ground, John grabbed Sherlock’s face, lightly slapping his cheek, making the genius’ eyes flutter open.
“We managed to break into Hargett’s mobile.” The response was enough the garner Sherlock’s attention. “Apparently their ring runs deeper than we thought. Even some more…authoritative entities were involved.”
With that, Sherlock waved him off. He and John made eye contact, whose eyebrows were furrowed upwards, though he would say nothing, backing his best mate. Still, there was a silent agreement between them, for John to watch him and ensure his health, as long as Lestrade held his end of the bargain of keeping John in the loop of the takedown of the Cielo Diablos. With another sigh, Lestrade was gone and the two of them were alone once more.
With the limited light from the windows on the front of the building, John was able to make out another hall, with a door at each end. The one to his right was closed, but he could see a faint light emitting underneath. Moving closer, he could make out quiet speech.
A few people walked by, which was expected given the time. With the sun since set, he realized it was close to the time of night Sherlock had been abducted the night prior.
Mycroft’s mask melted away and he jerked his head towards Lestrade, expression nothing but concern. “Take me to him. Now.” His voice was commanding and Lestrade gave no comment.
Sherlock was sitting on the bottom of the bathtub, pressed into the corner, his eyes distant and knees pulled up to his chest. His extremities were tinged with blue, but the man was not even shivering, sending alarm bells off in John’s head. Red marks were up and down his thighs and arms from what John recognised as coming from being scrubbed repeatedly with a washcloth, along with various welts that appeared to be burn marks. His suspicions were confirmed when he saw the cloth still being held in Sherlock’s hand.
“Site?” Lestrade asked, stepping next to her. “What site?” When she did not respond, the detective inspector turned to stand straight in front of her. “If you are keeping any information from a police investigation, you can be charged with obstruction, do you understand?”
The memories forced his unwanted emotion to the surface and he felt his eyes burn. “John,” he said, calling his mate’s attention.
Scanning the lounge, his gaze lingered on Sherlock’s chair, his chest slowly sinking. It took him a moment to drag his eyes over the couch, where the book Sherlock had been reading the night prior still sat on the cushion. Moving to the couch, he picked the book up, flipping through the pages, eyes catching a few sentences as the paper flittered over each other. He finally stopped on a page where the spine had been creased.
Though the man seemed familiar, John could not place why. It was not a face from one of the videos, but he still could not shake the feeling that something was wrong.
There was only a moment’s pause before two fingers were inserted, the dryness causing friction and skin skipping on skin as the pressed in further. Once both of the man’s fingers were completely inside him, he began making a scissor-like motion, gaining muffled grunts and from the detective. He felt something wet at his entrance as the man allowed his saliva to drip at the base of his fingers. He had only coated the entrance before extracting his fingers.
With his hand on the door, which was now slightly ajar, Sherlock slowly pushed it open, expecting the landing leading to the lower and upper floors. Instead, he was introduced to the familiar surroundings of the basement – the pungent scent of blood, sweat and coitus filling his nostrils. Going against his better judgement, he crossed the threshold, the door to his flat shutting behind him. The deceased lower-class man’s body parts were in a pile near the wall with maggots crawling in and out of the exposed tissue, the head on top of the torso, the eyes milky and glazed as they stared ever forward. The mattress still sat in the back corner, damp with urine, semen and blood, the sight bringing back the memory of being used – the feeling of urine filling his bowels returned and nausea rose in the back of his throat.
That being said, this chapter is a bit longer than previous ones - something I'm sure you'll enjoy. (^ ^)
A garbled “yes” seem to be what he wanted and he let go, stepping back. Sherlock sucked in breath-after-breath, mixed with several coughs.
It took a moment for Mycroft to register the words being spoken, but when his mind appeared to come back online, his posture changed. He glanced to the phone in his hand before changing screens, inputting a number and bringing it to his ear. Whoever picked up on the other end was met with Mycroft’s calm composure, requesting locations of all building within the city limits with substructures. After he hung up, it was only a few moments before his phone signalled new messages.
Had it not been for the windows allowing the light from the outside streetlamps to flood into the entryway, he would have been drenched in darkness. Stairs ran up along both sides of the opposing walls, leading to a landing that had an elevator in the centre, most likely flanked by doors to long-abandoned offices. His shoes clicked on the tile as he went around the receptionist desk in the middle of the room, Just as he was about to go under the landing, leaving the light and stepping into the shadows, yellow light flooded from an apparent door to the right into the hall. It was closed just as quickly.
“Don’t lie, now,” Dreln said as he swiped through a few pictures. He held up the screen, as though showing proof he did not even have. “Even Mycroft here told me how much you enjoy being played with.”
When he unlocked the phone and went to the messages, the most recently read came up on the screen. John’s brows knitted together at the message sent to Mycroft from Sherlock, with a timestamp around the time they had left the flat for dinner the other night.
There was not even a pause as Sherlock responded, “The zoo sounds lovely.” John looked at him to see Sherlock giving him one of the most sardonic smiles. He could not help it and failed at containing himself. His reaction caused Sherlock to crack, the two of them winding up laughing together on the couch.
Peering down at the soldier’s taught expression, Mycroft spoke to the person on the other line: “Do excuse me. I have a matter to attend to.” He brought the phone from his ear, ending whatever call he had taken. He pocketed his mobile before standing straight, looking at John as though he was an inconvenience. “Is there a problem, Doctor Watson?”
His name was written on the back in handwriting he immediately recognised as Lestrade’s. He already knew it was his mobile before taking it out, but there was still a sense of reprieve at physically holding it for the first time in over a week. What he was not expecting, however, was a folded up note that dropped out with it. He made his way towards the lamp in on the table, turning it on and holding the note under the light.
As his mind drifted, the only thing he could think was apologies to the only person he did not want to leave behind.
“Appreciate it,” John said as he accepted the offer. Once lit, he passed the lighter back, taking a drag without inhaling. He took the fag from his lips, staring at it as he exhaled the smoke. “It’s quiet out tonight, isn’t it?”
is suggesting I use a catheter – I think that’s all of it, but John, please let me know if I’ve skipped over anything.”
Before John could voice it, Lestrade was on the phone, demanding to know every building in the city that had a basement, knowing the numbers would be limited. Though he was certain Donovan meant no ill-will, it was clear that she believed the search to be fruitless, certain that Sherlock was no longer within the limits of London, the group housing him elsewhere. Even if that were the case, it was better to exhaust the other possibilities.
Peering up, Lestrade was now standing in front of him, his face filled with concern. With a glance around, he realized there was more than one patrol car; there were four, along with an ambulance that had just turned onto the street.
There was a buzz emanating from the man’s pocket. He took out his mobile and unlocked the screen, his fingers tapping away. As he sent the message, he walked to Sherlock and dug his heel into the back of the detective’s injured knee, garnering a shout as Sherlock was less than a foot from the broken chair’s leg.
“Hargett, Cruz and McLane have locked down, refusing to speak,” he responded, referring to the American, the Mexican and the native. “Though Cruz was adamant about having nothing to do with what happened to Sherlock.” John’s eyes trailed from Lestrade to his mate. The words had confirmed what he had heard through the door – as much as he wanted them all to hang, he knew the Mexican man – Cruz – was against what Dreln and the man he called Francis had done.
“Sherlock,” he barely managed as he approached, his heart falling to his stomach and nausea rising in his throat as he fell to a kneel beside him.
“Very much so.” He remembered getting into several arguments with both Lestrade and Donovan during Sherlock’s disappearance, guilt in his stomach like a rock. Handling victims and victim families was what the man excelled at, and it was not like he did not know John was getting upset over the situation, not himself.
Chances are likely this will be the last chapter of having an incapacitated Sherlock, but we'll see how it goes. (__ u __)
She shook her head at the accusation. “Nothing! But there was a video on the site—” she cut herself off, as though regretting what she had said.
“The perimeter is already squared off and we’ll let the medical personnel handle him when they arrive,” he said, the tone in his voice suggesting the officer join the others around back. Picking up on it, the young officer gave a “yes sir” before jogging down the alley.
Sherlock knitted his brows together and adverted his attention to the official, whose subtle changes in posture confirmed Dreln’s accusation.
Lestrade had made a few audible comments, which the blood pounding in John’s ears drowned out. It was not until Lestrade’s arm knocked into him as he reached to the laptop that John had paid any attention at all.
His chest had grown so tight by the time he entered the bathroom, breathing felt like a chore. He caught himself on the sink as the crutch fell to the floor, making a loud
John awoke to a bright light shining in his eyes and a throbbing headache. Sally Donovan was leaning over him, shining a penlight into his eyes as she lifted his eyelid, looking for an apparent concussion. The doctor groaned, trying to roll his neck while Donovan kept his head in place. His entire head pounded, his frontal lobe aching with a dull pain, the light aiding in no comfort. Behind Donovan, he could see the blur of a blue lights from a police car. Her voice sound muffled and distant, but he was certain she was calling his name.
The expression on Mycroft’s features had him confused and he found himself reaching behind him to touch the desk, as if to have a feeling of being grounded.
“Well, while you’re contemplating, zoom in on this,” he said as he managed to push in half of his forearm, gaining a gasp and yell as a response. “Fuck…I don’t think I can fit anymore. Feel like the circulation’s being cut off from my arm.”
“Texting your boss to tell him you’ve got me chained to a chair?” he asked, voice flooded with sarcasm.
“Oh, daddy’s mad,” Dreln snickered as he glanced to other, who shoved his phone back in his pocket and zipped his suit back.
“It’s not difficult, Doctor Watson. With the right equipment, even an amateur can do it.” He failed to see the frown he received as a response.
Nodding in understanding, three of them went around the front while the others followed the rest around back, moving down the small alleyway between the buildings. As the others went down the alley, another came up to Lestrade.
Anytime Sherlock would cough or gag, the man would release a low-pitted moan, but would give no reprieve, instead holding the position longer. It did not take long before the thrusts got harder and faster, hitting the back of the young genius’s throat. Despite attempting to pull away, he was held firmly in place as the man released his seed into his throat and mouth, releasing a loud grunt as he did.
At Lestrade’s confirmation, John’s disheartened posture was difficult to ignore. Without so much as a glance, she left their presence to pull out the patrol car; meanwhile, the army doctor was searching for other possibilities, his mind turning over itself as every thought that flittered across his mind wound up at a dead end.
When the homepage came on the screen, they were introduced to a slew of fan made pictures with Sherlock in compromising positions. Donovan made her disgust apparent, asking rhetorically, “Why does this exist?” as she turned her head away from the screen. Both Lestrade and John shifted uncomfortably, while John momentarily stared up at the ceiling, exhaling an awkward breath. Allison was silent, her eyes fixated on the screen as she scrolled down to where there was a link for “videos.” Both of her hands were shaking as she tried her best to maintain a straight face, which was a bright red. Having an inspector, a sergeant and Sherlock’s best mate peering at a webpage that should never have been made known to them had her heart pounding in her chest, feeling as though it might explode at any given moment.
“Right,” John drew own, his eyes falling back on Sherlock, who was turning ahead in whatever book he had buried his nose into. “And that doesn’t bother you in the least?”
as the call ended and he returned his phone to his pocket. “Seems the van has been located,” he responded to John’s unasked question. “You will be accompanying me, I assume.” He passed John to the flat’s door, but not before he took up his umbrella, which had been leaning against the back of the chair his younger brother typically occupied.
The woman smiled, her face turning red. “Apologies. You two are out on a date and I didn’t mean to intrude.”
“Get a copy of this – we need the identity of those men,” Lestrade said to Donovan as he stood up, opening the number pad on his phone. Bringing the phone to his ear after punching in the digits, his voice broke through the receiver. “How many of those structures are near the river?” A pause as he left the room, leaving his sergeant to send the footage. “I know you sent the locations, but time is of the essence, so update it!” He barely acknowledged the manager of the pub as he passed the bar, leaving the pub to the sidewalk. “Then you have my apology, now just do it.” He hung up in obvious frustration.
John shook him a bit harder and called his name again. On the third attempt, Sherlock’s eyelids flickered. The creases eased from his expression. He took a deep breath and rolled onto his back. John leaned back and tried to wipe away the concerned look that he knew he was wearing.
In an instant, he fell back from the entryway and moved into the barely lit hall underneath the stairwells, hiding himself in the shadows just as the door was pushed opened. The shadow of the man was cast by the light of the room behind him as he rounded the corner to move down the hallway. John flattened himself against the wall and watched as the man came towards him, blissfully unaware of his presence. The moment he passed him, John came up behind him, pressing his left hand against his mouth and right arm over his throat. Even with the man struggling, his vocals unable to escape the pressure, John held fast, expression oddly calm as he tightened his grip around the man’s throat.
That being said, trying to NOT allow those reads to effect my writings has been insanely difficult - when my muse is actually going. I still feel like I let some of that out in this chapter, but because of that, I was much more critical of what I was writing.
He would have a talk about with Sherlock later about how he would go about it and what he would expect from Sherlock as an official patient, even if Sherlock had only meant it to pass off the nurse and get her out of the room.
“Do I look like a fucking pikey to you? You could offer Parliament and my words will be the exact same. Now do me a favour and piss off.” He slammed his thumb down the “End Call” button, inhaling and exhaling an aggravated breath.
Lestrade went to re-join Donovan, who had her eyebrows furrowed as a black car turned the corner through their setup roadblock, pulling up out front of the building. She glanced to Lestrade in question, who dropped his shoulders and shook his head, knowing what was to come.
John nodded while still holding eye contact. “Then we’ll bring him home together,” he said slowly with assent. There was a silent affirmation. John’s eyes quickly went back to the laptop, a question tugging at the corner of his mind. “If you had him under surveillance, then how did you lose track of him?”
It only took a few seconds without oxygen before his only good arm tried to fight back out of survival. It was easily halted as Dreln grabbed his already broken wrist and pinned it to the ground, leaning forward with his face mere inches from his own. With his blood pounding in his ears, he only caught the words “damn” and “beautiful” before the sensation of Dreln’s mouth on his own.
Mycroft paused before he nodded. Sherlock released a breath, as though laughing at the realisation his brother had not been passed the point of complete inebriation that night.
His muscle throbbed against the man’s hand, a dull pain radiating from his rectum and through his lower back. So when Dreln began pumping his hand in and out, it took all of Sherlock’s self-control to not collapse in a mixture of pained cries and moans, if only to keep his shoulders from dislocating.
They waved the weapon before putting it back behind them. “Yeah, whatever.” Their annoyance was clear. Whether it was because of the request or because of the unfamiliarity, he was unsure. Either way, it granted the passage he wanted.
Feeling the semen seep out of him, vomit rose in Sherlock’s throat. He swallowed it down, keeping his eyes shut as he attempted to return the palace he had called comfort.
“What are you talking about?” he asked, questioning if Mycroft even registered that he was there at all.
The man looked up from his phone, contemplating, before a smile graced his features. “No one’s expecting an immediate response, Mr. Holmes. But believe me when I tell you that he will eventually, unless he’s always wanted to see his little brother die.”
He was thrown to the floor, his back meeting the concrete. Before he could roll onto his side, a boot made contact with his dislocated shoulder and pressed down, forcing a pained shout.
“They’ll keep you, you know,” John said in regard to the doctors and staff keeping the detective in hospital until they could be assured he would be self-sustainable after he left their care.
Lestrade waved his hand. “It was insisted upon. Not my idea.” He stood next to Sherlock’s bed, staring down at the young man with a look of regret.
“Oh, Sherlock,” was a familiar voice. “I’ve gotta give you props for the attempt, but a zero for the landing.”
Inside, the entryway laid barren. An old counter was in the centre of the tiled room, with debris on the floor and graffiti on the chipped walls. Lights from streetlamps leaked into the broken windows above, giving a fair amount of light into the large room. To the left and right were a set of stairs that wrapped along the walls, leading to a second floor. Behind the glass counter was a hallway that light was only barely able to penetrate, while at the bottom of the left set of stairs was a wooden door. Going with his instincts, he moved behind the counter and underneath the stairs. It was not until he was under the overhead when he was able to hear the faint sound of voices.
“We need to find the others involved,” Lestrade said, voice sounding distant and hollow as his mind fell to the background. “Bring them to justice.”
“I don’t need help!” Sherlock snapped, the cast on his wrist catching on the trousers’ fabric. “I can do things on my own!” John felt his shoulders drop. Sherlock fought for a few more moments before getting to the point of tossing the trousers off to the side.
“We’re already on it,” he cut John short, handing John back the slip. “Going by the footage, they’re held up in the direction of the river.”
Sherlock did not verbally respond, but he did move to attempt to stand. With John’s assistance, he was able to get up, having to use the wall for support. No words were exchanged between them as John guided him to the bedroom, careful not to let the towel fall. He sat on the edge of the bed. John took out clean clothes and set them on the bed next to him before leaving the bedroom to pick up the fallen crutch. When he returned, Sherlock was already dressed in briefs and maroon button-down, though the shirt was still opened, and he was struggling to put his trousers on.
He gripped the handle of his umbrella as he watched a smaller figure walk underneath the landing. He was only a few steps in before he noticed Mycroft. In the process of going for his weapon, he tripped over what was an unseen figure sitting on the floor, his weapon sliding across the tile, which Mycroft caught under his foot.
The final bit of blood-stained plastic was removed from the room, leaving Sherlock with nothing more than the haunting reminder and heavy scent of putrid blood. The fever that had been slowing inching its way through his body had finally taken hold and he found himself cold, his innards throbbing between dull and sharp pains.
He stepped up to the side of the bed, taking a sip from his coffee as he watched the nurse flip through the chart before placing it back on the hook on the wall next to the patient. Picking up and uncapping a new syringe, the man took hold of one of the medication bottles.
“Oh, um, thank you,” John sputtered, indiscreetly knocking his shoulder into Sherlock, getting the detective to force a smile to the young woman.
When he garnered no response, a frowned befell his face. He put his hand on Sherlock’s chest and pushed below the ribcage.
There was a closet to his left, which he assumed was another janitorial closet. In front of him was a spiral stairwell leading downwards. Inhaling, he took the first step, his shoes crunching on broken glass. He was halfway down the stairwell when there was a shadow on the wall, cuing someone ascending. He stopped short just in time to see the familiar figure of Dreln Hargett.
“How about we have some personal time before everyone else joins in?” He ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair and stood up. He unbuckled his belt and undid the button and zipper to his jeans. Sherlock adverted his gaze to staring back down at the mattress, his jaw tightening. It was only a moment before his hair was gripped and he was forced to turn his head towards the length now staring him in the face. “C’mon, show me what else that mouth can do,” his voice came out slow, nearly in a moan as he rubbed the head on Sherlock’s lips. “And don’t bite. It wouldn’t end well for either of us.”
John could here his shoes click on the tile down the hall. He heard them stop at what he suspected was the Nurse’s Station and turned his attention back to his laptop. It did not stay on it very long when he heard his mate speak.
The expression Lestrade saw etched all over John’s face read more than words could ever give. What he read was something more than concern of a friend, of a comrade. Over the years, the only time he had ever witnessed such determination in both vocals and body language were those who deeply cared for the victim – those who loved—
