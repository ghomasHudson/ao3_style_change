Gabriel had watched this all with suspicious eyes, but when Dean so blatantly took Cas’ hand, he stiffened. “Ehm, that is my baby brother, bucko. You
On his left pectoral, right over his heart, a burn scar stood, eerily shaped like a handprint. It was like someone, or some
He just pocketed his phone when he saw the familiar short, spiky hair. His heart leaped, Dean was still on time! He was about to greet Dean, when he saw Sam exit the Japanese restaurant, waving at someone inside, and pull Dean into a tight hug. His heart froze in his chest. Was
Finally, she nodded and shuffled to the exit.
Sam smirked again. "Don't sweat it. We're in some tough classes."
Only three blocks from college, his car started hiccupping. "Christ!!" He slammed his hand on the steering wheel. "Ohhh, Sweetie, don't. Not this close to school!" From the corner of his eye, he saw a sleek black car leveling with him. The driver motioned him to pull over. Frowning, and a bit scared, Castiel complied. As he pulled on the parking brake, Sweetie hiccupped once more and her engine died. "No!" Castiel cried, shocked. The other driver tapped on his window and Castiel leaned over to roll it down.
Castiel interrupted him quickly. "Nuh-uh! You hid all my pants, save these and the ones Annette had in the laundry. Desolé, mon frère. No compensation."
From his peripheral view, Cas noticed Gabriel dashing to his feet, and Anna pushing off the wall, but his blood thundered in his ears, his mind boiling with rage.
Far, far off, a church clock started chiming the midnight hour.
Gabe was bouncing out of the kitchen. "Cassie!!! I thought I heard that sexy voice of yours!" He turned his golden eyes on the woman. "Don't tell me you were hitting on him, Meg." Unabashed, Meg batted her eyes. Gabriel shook his head. "One day Mr. Jameson will kick your ass out for being too forward, you know that, don't you, hon?"
French to English:
Castiel thought it would be rude to keep his eyes shut any longer, so he reluctantly opened them and turned to Dean. "I'm glad you're impressed, but all I did was use my study hour illicitly to get some pie."
Anna tilted her head. “Best explore all avenues. Could be either.”
The rest of the day, she kept sending him updates. ‘Dude, this is creepy. He knew that we LARP.’ or ‘He can’t know Garth is allergic, can he? Yet he just saved the dude. I am officially freaking out.’ Dean squirmed as time passed. Charlie had an LGBTQ meeting after school, but she said she’d be there around four thirty.
Another impressed nod. "Close. She's from 1967."
Anna ducked her head. “So that is why you don’t want to get close,” she whispered. “You’re afraid they’ll end up like Balthazar, and you will have to nurse another broken heart.”
“Rien, Anna. I have nothing yet,” he groused. Anna pulled her fingers through his hair and he jerked his head to the side. His blue eyes narrowed, he glared at her. “Dégage, Anna!” he hissed. “I told you...” Anna shrugged. “I think of you as a little brother, cousin dear. Nothing else. Not anymore. Anyway, Gabriel did a little digging, and he found that most victims were women. More specifically, women who were sleeping with the same guy. The same, married guy.”
Cas smiled. Annette was as good as family to him and he took her by the hand to introduce her to Dean. “Dean, meet Annette. Officially our housekeeper, but unofficially my first friend and almost my second mother.” Annette blushed at that and shyly took Dean’s hand. “Annette, this is Dean, my…” He cast a glance at Dean askance. Dean smiled and gave a nod. “... my boyfriend,” Cas finished, happy Dean understood him.
From the hallway, Maman called out: "Gabriel! Stop saying that! He is, and even if he wasn't, he would not be the least bit interested!" Gabriel bit his lip, golden eyes twinkling. Castiel copied his move and they both chortled.
Castiel grinned wistfully. "Only because my parents are adamant about it. But you were asking about Saturday?" he prompted.
“Rowena,” he calmly said, having the tiny, redheaded witch swirl around with a whisper of expensive velvet. “Sam is not in. He and Gabriel are picking out their wedding suits. I thought you knew.” Rowena scowled at him, then the door, and heaved a big sigh. She hung her head and waved her hand in a dainty little gesture. Purple sparks trailed her hand through the air and a cup of steaming tea appeared, hovering in the air on a little cloud of purple magic.
He opened the file and read the date first. It was stamped four months ago. Cas swallowed. “Bobby…” Bobby shushed him and urged him to read on. Cas nodded and read on. He finished the document, reread it, and started over. He slowly lowered the folder, eyes wide and unable to speak. Bobby and Ellen were smiling at him encouragingly, while Dean and Sam looked curious. Bobby took the other folders and slid one to Sam, who read it in no-time flat, cocked his head and waited.
“He has a group going rogue, but with the aid of witches, so they’re undetectable by infernal means. He asked if we could set someone on them.” Cas felt dubious. Most experienced Hunters were on jobs of their own, and the ones still in the Bunker were too green to set on demons. Sam and Gabriel were busy with planning their wedding, so they should be left to that.
Naomi sank her head into her hands, sobbing. “He was right. Oh my God, Jimmy was right... It didn’t help at all. Not one bit!”
Jack smiled just as widely as he always did and took Maman’s delicate hand in his. “Hello. I am happy to meet you. You are the first from my new family I meet, except for Dad and Papa. Is there an honorific I can give you, like them?”
“Gabriel Novak, but y’all can call me Gabe.” The golden haired man had eyed up Sammy with a delighted smile. “And you are the one looking to buy, I hope?” Sam had given him his best bitchface, but Dean had seen the little quirk of his little brother’s mouth.
Gabriel full on grinned now.
Even in the green light that was currently illuminating the corner where they entered the dance area Dean’s cheeks were obviously red. “Oh… okay… Let- let’s just get you home, okay. I think this is the booze talking.”
“I’m sorry I doubted you, angel. I should have remembered that.” Dean kissed Cas on the brow. “Can you forgive me?”
“Scratch him,” Cas dismissed. “He’s the one who dealt with me in the first place. If he wanted me out, he would’ve ripped up the contract, right?”
Regarde toi... tous agités. Est-ce que je me rapproche de la vérité, mon petit frère?” (Look at you ... all restless. Am I getting closer to the truth, my little brother?)
Gabriel smiled softly. “I knew that was special to you. You never left it. You never wore it either, but I remember you turned the motel on the Keys inside out until you had it. I guess...” He shrugged. “I guess I didn’t want it to be buried with you. I...” He scratched his neck. “I needed the memento. I wanted to keep you close...” Touched, Cas patted him on the shoulder. “Never again, Gabriel,” he said. “I promise.”
Cas smiled at her. “I don’t know, Maman. I’m just getting used to having friends. I think I have three now...”
Dean scuffed his toes over the roof. He’d been pacing here for a while now. He was thinking about Lisa. Lisa Brayden. She was cute and had pretty, dark hair. He liked her a lot and had been crushing on her. He dreamed about her at night, and couldn’t concentrate during the day. It had been like that for some time. Long enough, so he would finally take steps now. He tugged at the collar of his dark green school uniform jacket. Dean knew she often came up here. He’d come here, waiting for her. He jumped on the ledge and balanced on it a while. When the door opened with a metallic creak, he snapped his head up. “Hi! You’re here… Ehm…”
Another sigh, this one way deeper. "My parents really want me to become a lawyer, maybe even a judge."
Both Danielle and the sprite made a soft, grateful sound, and Cas swung the mallet at the most moist bit of wall. It crumbled like a piecrust and the warm, autumn sunshine screamed in, all golden and inviting.
“Nah. I’m just taking a peek. Like crystal gazing, only without the crystal.” She set up the table like it was for a seance, and Cas was starting to feel distinctly nervous. They sat around the table.
Cas chuckled, but then sobered. “If we ever get to be more.”
calls me that! Not unless...”
So... what did you guys think? Did I do the  prompt and the art Justice?
?” Cas shot back, his temper rising steadily.
The other guy eyed him suspiciously, but eventually grabbed his hand. “Jimmy. Jimmy Novak.”
“Eh… well… mmhh.. huh… imagine that,” Dean mumbled, and Cas looked up. His best friend and secret crush wasn’t looking back, and his cheeks were positively flaming. Oh.. ooohhh. Had he been so wrong in believing Dean did not feel anything beyond a close friendship for him?
"The fact that you look like a male underwear model on his time off, helps too of course.” Bal beamed. “Cassie, hon, you look good enough to eat! Come on, I will help you reduce your 'Come-get-me' bubble by dragging you inside, so your sexvoice will be drowned out by the music." He grabbed a stunned Castiel by the hand and pulled him towards the club.
Jimmy blinked, temporarily taken aback, but his scowl returned pretty fast.
Dean blinked. “You?
The woman sighed wistfully. "I knew it. All the good looking ones are either taken, or gay."
“But what about that orchard?” Dean asked. That seems to have been made with love and care at least.” Cas sighed. “That’s because dad hired Joshua for the garden when they bought the house. Joshua loves every sapling he ever planted.  His old age has crept up on him though, and ours is the last garden he tends, because my mother has the opposite of a green thumb: brown fingers. Any plant she decides to care for, withers and dies.” He held out a hand towards Sam. “May I use your laptop? I will show you the realtor’s advert of the place.” Sam easily handed over the hardware and in a few clicks, the house was on the screen. He passed it over to Bobby and Ellen, who looked baffled yet interested.
With a sigh, Cas scratched a bit of paint from the sigil. “Allez.. be gone.”
"He looks good enough to eat, Gabriel," a blonde bombshell cooed, lifting her own glass with sickly green liquor to her, too red, lips. Castiel could smell her oppressive perfume from where he stood. A feat on its own, since they were in a club and nearly everyone there wore cologne or perfume. "Aw, come on Cassie... give Starla here a chance."
When Sam blushed, Cas smirked. “No,” his friend answered shyly. “Just this guy, you know. He’s a few years older, but I like him. He is fun and doesn’t treat me like a little kid. Sure, he flirts with me, but it’s just as much as he flirts with everyone else. So, I don’t think much of it.”
“Cassie,” Gabriel started. “You can’t just go out there alone, bucko!
Salaud - bastard
Smugly tilting his head, Crowley blinked innocently.
With a smile he replied: "Like the gun, yes."
(See the end of the chapter for
It appeared he wasn't. "Cas! Dude, you are a gem! Sammy loved it! I got brownie points up to the stars thanks to you!!"
Dean took a deep breath. “Geez Cas… those are made with Blue Curacao, Vodka and Apple Schnapps. Couldn’t you start off lighter?”
did this? How?!” Cas deadpanned, and Bobby crossed his arms. “That’s what we wanna know from you, boy,” Bobby grumbled. Gabriel’s head swiveled from Cas to him, and back. “What?” Not in the mood for games and drama, Cas lifted his shirt up to show the burn on his chest. “What in the nine realms?!” Gabriel punched out.  Cas lowered his shirt again and crossed his arms and legs.  “Like you didn’t get some high-ranked demon to yank me topside,” he grumbled. Blanching, yet sporting indignant red cheeks, Gabriel gasped. “I’d never...” “Laissez!” Cas barked. “We all know you would, and you have.”
Her saliva dripped in the wounds, making the pooling blood bubble and hiss as it came in contact.
"Send it to me, before he bakes you that pie. I need that on my phone. If only to be able to get through another meeting with Zachariah."
“He is not a Ken doll.”
“Gabriel is partially to blame there, cousin dear,” Cas smiled, but throwing up a hand before Gabriel could splutter his objection.
Patiently, he waited for Dean to end his bickering with Sammy. "Anyway, buddy, you got plans this Saturday?"
At last, she pushed the door open, and he could escort her towards Honey.
“Soooooo...” Gabriel cooed, as Cas walked into the living room. “Who’s the Ken doll Luce spotted you with?”
Sam, cheeks flushed and head bowed to seem smaller, nodded yes. “Castiel… Castiel is in my class, and Dean… Dean is my brother. How could I not connect the dots? Castiel… Cas… The same guy...”
Juliet tilted her head, the red glow in her eyes dimming a bit. She huffed a warm, sulphuric breath over his face before gently fitting her maw over Cas’ neck.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. "Alright, alright. Let's go."
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack kept smiling as he leaned back in the chair. “I made mistakes, and you two suffered. Hunger? Fighting? World peace? All choices that mankind as a whole makes. All free will. This?” He gestured at them. “This was a newly minted Deity, that messed up, and now is setting the record straight. Erasing the side effects.” He stood, his blue eyes warm and loving. “I like you two. Now… I have to go, but I will see you two before the ends of your long and rich lives. Dean? Buy him the hive. And Castiel… don’t be too mad at Claire when she breaks that figurine. Dean doesn’t mind that much.” With that enigmatic message, Jack snapped his fingers again, and disappeared, leaving behind the paperwork for KU, and a single sunflower.
“Here, lemme just...” he started and wiped softly at the corner of Cas’ mouth. The blush went for it and rushed up Cas’ cheeks.
“Dude… you really had a lot of those, didn’t you?” Cas moaned and retched, splattering more purple in the toilet bowl. “Yeah… I’d advise against lighting a match here. The fumes are lethal, let alone if you have a naked flame near.” Dean remarked as he rubbed Cas’ back and Cas moaned, this time not just because his stomach was in knots, but also because those strong hands on his back felt
"Yes. She broke down on me. Just three blocks from the school."
“It means, Kitten,” Crowley patiently explained, “That she will be the one to take you down. Both figuratively and literal.”
“Hello hello! Isn't this a weird place to meet up, Cassie?” He turned his eyes towards Dean and his face arranged itself into a look of disdain. “And who might you be, Ken doll?”
“Exactly,” she confirmed. “After tending to this huge place for decades, I think a simple little home will be nice.”
“But I am,” Cas finished for her.
“Aw,” Donna sighed. “This is why I love weddings. Always a new couple made.” She kissed Jody, who blushed. “C’mon, Jodes. We’re not taking the girls home with us until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest. Let’s go use our very private bedroom.” Dean watched them go with a smile.
Biting down into the juicy burger, Cas moaned.
Lucien! Vraiment! Vous dépassez vos limites, mon frère. Et vous êtes grossier. Il ne nous comprend pas. Je ne parlerai pas si ce n'est pas l'anglais. (Lucien! Really! You are exceeding your limits, my brother. And you are rude. He doesn't understand us. I will not speak if it is not English.)
Cas fumbled to get his phone out. “No service… Huh.”
An uncanny, knowing look crept in her eyes. “You’re not American, are you?” she concluded, and Cas sighed.
With a scoff, Cas stood. “Fine. I will go,” he amended. “Tell Anna I’ll be back shortly. Abruti.”
Apparently, Dean had succeeded to muffle the phone by now, because the rest of baby brother's answer was lost to Castiel, who was smiling now.
The door opened and those familiar green eyes locked onto his, growing twice their size. “Cas…” Cas wanted to answer, when he suddenly got grabbed and pulled against that firm body. Dean inhaled deeply, shuddering. Cas hugged back, scared he would let Dean fall if he didn’t.
“I think you have found the right motel, love,” Cas said. “I sense the presences much stronger now. They are in the last room of that building.” He pointed to the last of four identical blue doors. “Shall I fly us in? You seem to be handling angel flight better and better.” Dean smiled warmly and did not care to explain that it was Cas’ flying he was handling better. Cas kissed him and flew them off.
“So you just woke up in that pine box I put you in?” Gabriel marvelled.
Castiel pulled out his phone as he settled down with his lunch. He wanted no disturbances, so he took a seat outside, on the terrace. The wind was chilly, but that's why he was wearing his tan trenchcoat. He pressed the second contact icon, and waited.
Cas threw him a look. “What if I would?”
Dean slapped his forehead. “Of course… variation is the spice of life. That patch is bound to be awash with whiteflies and sooty mold!” He looked up and grinned, making the ever present butterflies in Cas’ stomach take flight. “You’re a lifesaver!” Cas just shrugged and pointed at the next picture, specifically at the large cypress trees and the tiny spirea. Back and forth, back and forth. Dean groaned. “The idiot. Those spirea don’t get any sunlight with those bigass cypress trees hogging it.” He quickly flipped through the other pictures and shook his head. “No way… No fucking way… Will you look at that, Cas… He made just about every wrong decision he could. The boxwood is suffering the same fate as the spirea because of that silverberry, and how in the hell did he think butterfly weed would like living in the damp Louisiana soil? Joshua would kill him if he ever gave him that design plan.”
Without talking to his brother again, Gabriel got out of the car and went inside.
“Désiste!” he hissed at his cousin, before directing his glare at his twin. “She what?” he asked, tone flat and icy.
Cas swallowed hard. He liked the soft looking purple flowers, but knowing what they could do to horses, he started to understand why Bobby wanted at least ten yards from the fence off to be cleared of the weed. “Don’t horses usually avoid eating toxic plants?” he asked, trying to not stare at Dean’s bare underarms.
I will give translations. (And go back and do it for chapters 1 and 2 as well.)
“I was just in Watertown, taking care of a djinn problem,” Cas explained, pushing his foot down more, relishing the purr of the engine. “I was literally stabbing it when your message came through. Problem solved, time free to help you two.”
When Cas’ lips touched his skin, Dean whimpered, a fact he would deny for years after, and sought support on the back of Cas’ chair. “I.. Cas…” he managed, looking into those blue eyes.
The door opened and Cas sat up. “Everybody relax!” Dean called, throwing his leather coat over the sofa, probably knowing very well Cas would pick it up and hang it on the coat rack later, and grouch about it during dinner. “I’m here.” Sam rolled his eyes so far up Cas wondered if he could see the roots of his long hair,  and snarked that everybody
Heat raced up Cas’ cheeks. Flirty Dean was a double threat.
“Yeah? What did the old demon want this time?” Dean smirked, knowing Crowley always had to have tit for tat, and only the threat of Gabriel going biblical on his ass kept the guy in line with what he asked for.
Frowning, Dean took his elbow and guided him out again. “Sure. Tell the guy. I’m sure he’s not out there smooching another.” Cas merely shrugged. He didn’t want to get smooched by Bal, but by Dean himself. Those plush lips were luring him and he found he had very little resistance. His alcohol-addled brain gave him a sneaky thought.
Mollified, Dean kissed her on the cheek. “Merci, Annette. You are something else.”
"Oooh the hot mechanic?" Gabriel cooed, still hiccupping.
Et puis mince, madame n'est pas là. (Eh pshh, the Mrs. isn’t here)
Gabriel didn’t answer, and the silence got heavy. “I am going to hang up, Gabe. I’m driving. Take care of Anna and yourself. Bye.” He swiftly ended the call before Gabe got his senses back.
Dean clapped him on the back. “I'm buying you a beer!”
Castiel held up his hand to silence her.
He dumped his damp towel in the hamper and almost bumped into his mother when he stepped out of the bathroom.
With a big inhale, Naomi lowered her hands. “Jimmy... Jimmy is psychic. He sometimes has premonitions, and he said that right after he had met you, he had one where he saw you, arguing with a demon.”
Juliet had prowled around until the last stroke of midnight, and then she’d pounced.
“Putain, Gabriel! Get your mind out of the gutter!” Castiel snapped, more than done with his cousin. Cackling, Gabriel rolled back onto his back. “You’re so much fun to deal with, Cassie,” he gasped, shooing him out the door.
Dean bit his lip, before letting his tongue sooth it with a quick lick. "Why not? I mean, you like classic cars, I like 'em. Seems logical to get you to tag along. Sammy, he doesn't like cars as much as I do. Hell, he can find his way around one, but he isn't that into them. Give him a library to geek out over, and you won't hear a peep out of the kid. I'm more of a hands-on kinda guy."
“Sam…” he breathed. Sam tilted his head in question. But as he was opening his mouth to ask whatever made that look come to those pretty eyes, another, even more unexpected voice rang out.
Castiel thought about it. "No, just studying."
Sam’s blush got deeper and the boy rubbed his neck. “Yeah… I mean. He’s cute and his eyes… wow. Intense.” Then he turned to Cas and gave him a puppy look. “You’re okay with me going all poetic about a guy?”
Dean smiled and dove back in to kiss more. Cas loved it and allowed Dean to show him how good kissing could be, secretly feeling glad he got drunk yesterday.
"Thanks, Cas! You're a lifesaver!! Gotta go. This crap piece of rust just sprung a leak! See ya!"
His father raised both eyebrows now and his steel blue eyes, so much like Luce's, twinkled.
Gabe blew her a kiss and tugged Castiel along. "You look slightly flushed, Cassie... Did Meg make you uncomfortable?"
"Good. Speakerphone?" With a smile Castiel complied.
A few minutes later, he was letting Imp just trot along to the meadow at the furthest point from the riding school. He had noticed bees buzzing around the ranch some times, but not many, and if Cas was the guy renting it, there should be a lot of them in the meadow. As Imp clomped closer and closer to the meadow, Dean saw more and more bees. Aware of them, Dean made sure to carefully approach itchy spots on his body, just in case a bee had landed on him. He didn’t feel like getting stung.
“Oof!” she punched out as she landed on the dry leaves, her red hair escaping the beanie she wore.
“What? Why?” he cautiously asked, suspicion rising.
each-other?”
French to English:
The motel was like any Cas had stayed in, in the lower price range, just this side of shabby, and the long hallway had only three and a half working ceiling lights. Bobby and he cautiously made their way down to where the last light was flickering above the door to the room they’d been told Gabe was in. It could be faulty wiring, or a tired old bulb, but they were Hunters, and any flickering light was cause for treading lightly. Casting a glance at each-other, Cas and Bobby stopped at the door. Bobby shrugged, and Cas took a deep breath before knocking.The door opened on a pretty blonde in her underwear. “Well?” she asked after a few awkward seconds. “Where’s our pizza?” The Hunters gaped at her, then glanced at each other. Did they have the wrong room? “Well fuck me sideways,” the girl snapped. “They send two, not one, but
Dean laughed and pulled at Cas’ sleeve. “It’s not her that is running hot right now, angel,” he purred, giving Cas a sultry smolder. Cas lit up and quickly agreed that an early night was just what they needed.
Charlie, besides being a great designer, was also a great friend and very good at all things computer. She even claimed to have hacked the Pentagon, and Dean was inclined to believe her. What that girl could do with a laptop, some energy-drink and ‘asskickin’ tunes’ on her bluetooth headphones, was scary. The clock on the face of the pharmacy flipped its numbers to 18.00 and Dean whistled sharply. “Max! I’m going home! You and Alicia can keep an eye on our peeps, right?”
“What did you do to her, Crowley?” he demanded.
“I know, love. Don’t worry. We will have an amazing meal. I…” His gaze shifted shyly to the ground. “I just wanted to have your gift ready.” He stepped aside and revealed a state of the art, bee-friendly hive. The exact same one Cas had been eyeing on the internet for ages now. He had refrained from buying it because it was pretty expensive, and they were still setting up home. The bedroom walls needed a fresh wallpaper, the kitchen appliances were a bit out of date… and that list was still open. Yet his sweet husband had still bought him his very own hive.
Castiel twitched the corner of his mouth, but didn't answer. "I'm going to bed, Gabriel. I suggest you do the same. Good night."
That night Castiel was frowning at the report he was trying to write an essay, hating the blinking cursor with a passion, when his phone rang, jerking him from his blank stupor. Against his habit, he didn't look at the screen to see who was calling.
Survival instincts kicking in, he started walking to where he thought there would be a road.
Castiel felt a blush creep up his cheeks, but released his lip. This guy, whom he knew nothing about, except that he was a mechanic called Dean, had an uncle Bobby and a quick sense of humour, just broke into his personal bubble and touched his face.
Castiel balked at that. "Excuse me? I am just here for my brother. Your assumptions about my sexuality are unfounded and I'm not content with your service. I will report this."
“Looking for a monster, huh boys?” she said with a knowing smirk. “C’mon in, cuties!” Gabriel licked his lips, but Cas dug his elbow in his cousin’s ribs.
“Oof! You idiot!” the other guy snarled. “Watch where you’re....” His voice bled out, and Cas looked up.
Which he regretted instantly. “Gah!” he gasped, flinging his hands up to not see.
The pie was a good offer though. If Gabe apologised for the attack on his trusty car, he might be tempted.
“Gabe? What the hell?” Sam joined in.
“I am glad you feel that way, my boy,” he said warmly.
Thinking he could use a bite to eat as well, he relayed that plan to Danielle, who accepted.
That raised his eyebrows. "You what? Why?" Gabriel gave his brother the elevator look. "And those are definitely not running clothes... oh. Wait... I'm sorry...."
Raising one eyebrow imperiously, Cas cocked his head at him. “I cannot? I thought I just did.”
“Go and check your message. If your other friend isn’t claiming your time today, I would like to invite you over to my place. My big brother isn’t in, so he can’t steal you as my friend.”
Gabriel gasped, hand to his throat. "What? No! Why? Is something wrong with her?"
“Tell me later.” he mouthed at his son, who bit his lip so as not to smile.
Cas landed neatly behind Dean. A blush raced up his cheeks when he felt that solid warm back against his chest. “Comfy?” Dean asked, and only now did Cas realise that Dean had wrapped his arm around Cas’ own and pinned it to his belly. Cas nodded and with a simple tightening of leg muscles and a clack of his tongue, Dean got Imp to start walking.
He cringed at his hasty type-o’s but forgot about them when the three dots started blinking. And blinking… finally a picture uploaded. It was a bit grainy, due to Charlie obviously zooming in as far as she could, but there he was, between a multitude of other faces, wearing an ugly old trench coat, but his hair, the blue eyes, the multiple piercings in his ear. Dean’s heart stuttered and started thumping happily.
His thoughts screeched to a halt. Bobby. He’d have to tell him he was ok! The old guy would be worried sick!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Our father knew nothing,
S'excuser! Rapidement! Tu me décevez! (Apologise! Hurry up! You disappoint me)
Since there was no-one around, Cas felt he was allowed to snoop a bit. He wandered to the bathroom, washed his face and his hands with blessedly cool water. Then he dried himself off and started checking himself in the mirror. His throat, where he could still feel the phantom pressure of those insane, knife-like teeth, was pristine. Not a wound in sight, not even a scab. He checked his arms, where those sharp claws had dug in, nothing.
Angry once again, Cas pushed Dean’s shoulder. “You dunno, Bal. Bal… Bal’s my
Cas shrugged with one shoulder. “It’s what he calls himself. Chuck Shurley.”
"Yes. I normally don't have any cause to not pay attention. This was the first time I ever got a call from a friend during class. I had to tell him I was not brushing him off, didn't I?"
“Dean,” Sammy rumbled. “It’s an unadorned cross, but you knew that. Don’t try and freak them out. It’s unbecoming.”
He pulled on his plaid lined canvas jacket and opened the door.
Sam grinned, all teeth and dimples. "You're right. We can talk during the study period."
He thanked Dean profusely, sighed and got out of that beautiful car.
Maman looked at Castiel with a regal smile and responded likewise to Gabriel.
Castiel straightened his back and shoulders. "Actually, no. I have just gotten up and showered."
Dégage - piss off
Castiel nearly drooled. "She is beautiful! I was actually looking at a 1965 Impala Coupé, but it was in a bad state, and then this darling caught my eye..."
An older man, with a scruffy beard, worn in jeans, a bodywarmer over an old flannel shirt, and a grimey truckers cap, stood just behind Dean. A fond smile played around his mouth as he watched Dean’s desperate bid to keep a full set of teeth. When he looked up at Castiel, and he had to, he was at least an inch shorter, that smile was gone.
The other guy sighed, rolled his almond shaped eyes and levelled Green Eyes a bitchface that rivalled Wednesday Addams’.
Excuser? - Excuse me?
Translations French - English:
I am slowly getting back to it. I hope my Muse doesn't go back into hiding.
Casting him a knowing glance and smirk, Gabriel scoffed. “Yet you still call him by the name he adopted after he came to the States. Why would you?”
Cas stretched and yawned. His mouth tasted foul and was as dry as the Mojave desert. He pondered this, then got hit by the memories. Oh dear Lord… had he
“Are you ok, Dean?” Castiel’s voice rumbled. Dean sighed and held his head. “No. I feel… weird.” A hand landed on his shoulder. “I’m sorry. Shall I take you to the nurse?” Dean was spared having to reply by the door opening again and everyone shuffling around to get seated.
Cas shook his head, and Dean grinned. “Claire,” Cas said, once he got himself a bit under control. “...meet your future brother: Jack.”
“So, I slice the bun open and stack all the other things in it, placing the top back on. Then what would I have?"
Dean almost tripped and Cas chortled softly. “You’re a real funny guy when you’re sauced, huh Cas?” Dean snarked, steering him towards the bar and Balthazar.
Dean watched as Cas stepped up to the microphone. Damn, he looked good in his robe and cap. His blue eyes sparkled and his pink lips were parted in a smile. “Dear classmates,” Cas started, and Dean smirked. He had heard his buddy practise this and he knew what was coming. “I know you all just want to get that piece of paper, and be let loose on the gardens and parks of the world, but tradition dictates that you have to suffer a speech by the kid who somehow got the role of valedictorian. Me. I am sorry. I could waffle on about how Joshua, sorry, Professor Angelis, taught us all how to not put big, shade throwing trees in the middle of a garden unless there was a terrace planned underneath, but who needs that? Yes, he taught us, and now we will have to be the ones to practice it. So take your piece of paper and start making the land beautiful.” Cas grinned and threw his cap in the air. Dean whooped and followed suit.
Cas scowled bitterly. “I don’t. But...” His voice bled out at Crowley’s shrewd look.
"Really? What did you have over him, son?"
Annette smiled and took his hand in hers. “Bonjour Jack, je serais honoré d'être ton ami, mon petit caneton.”
“No… no way…” Cas tilted his head in much the same way Sam just had. His brother stepped from behind the younger boy’s tall frame, his golden eyes wide with shock and shining with tears. “Cassie? Is… is that you?”
Sucking at his straw pensively, Gabriel hummed. “Then why is Luce going all mother hen on you? He sounded truly concerned... and did you really physically assault him?”
A severely callused and strong hand gripped his. "Bobby Singer. So. You're snatchin' up this idjet for the day, are ya?" Taken aback, Castiel blinked.
He grabbed the doorknob and pulled. “Gabe, Anna, I will contact you.” He shouldered his bag and left, a dead silence in his wake.
He threw open the door to the motel room Gabriel had told him they were in.
Before visiting Imp, Dean drank some coffee with Bobby and Ellen. “Hey, Bobby, do you know who rents off land to a guy with bees?” He had tried to be casual about it, but the glances between Bobby and Ellen were a sign he hadn’t succeeded.
“It didn’t touch me there!” he objected. At the knowing smile and unapologetic apology from Pamela, he cleared his throat. “Merde. Alright then…” He started to lift his shirt, well aware of Pamela’s eyes lighting up with interest. Once the handprint was visible, she got all business-like.
Gabe chuckled. "Aw, aren't you adorable?" He turned around to the people at the bar. "Isn't he adorable, folks?" A few ladies and guys turned towards them and Castiel could feel their eyes giving him the elevator look. A blush crept up his neck and his hands curled into fists.
“Aw, Sammy,” Dean groused, but he winked at Cas. “Spoilsport.” He turned back to Cas and his smile was more genuine and less teasing this time.
Dean couldn’t think for a moment. His guy? His… Cas?! He fumbled with his phone to answer her.
He flopped head first on the nearest bed and hugged the pillow to his chest. Within two minutes, he was snoring lightly.
Crowley bit his lip, dark eyes cast down. He heaved a big sigh, then whistled sharply.
With a jolt, Cas opened his eyes, only to meet more darkness. “H’llo?” he tried, but his throat was bone dry, so what came out was a raspy, thin sound. His fingers tentatively reached out in front of him, meeting rough wood within inches. Heart in throat, Cas tried to yell for help, but the reedy sounds he made hurt his throat and carried nowhere. He fumbled for his trusty lighter, desperate to see. His elbows knocked against more wood as he moved. He was in a box. A rough, wooden box, and he wondered whether this was a nightmare, or real.
Cas bit his lip and blinked at the tears forming in his eyes. “I’m sorry I got mad at you, Claire.” Dean gave him an exasperated, yet fond look.
He pressed the hook down, gathered his quarters and tried again.
"Dean, why did you ask me to come with you today?"
!” His tone was positively gleeful. “Oh my word... this is precious! And despite not knowing anything about him, you care enough for him that you’d be angry if Naomi got hurt.”
Dean closed his eyes, a suffering look briefly passing over his features. “More than you know…”
Sam grunted about exams and stuff, and Dean ruffled his hair. “Can’t believe it’s been four years since we were at that point. Say Cas, isn’t Gabriel graduating as well?” Cas confirmed it, but Sam grumbled about being kept waiting even longer, and Dean threw Cas a wink. That assbutt had knowingly done that. “Alright, Sammy… keep your socks on. I’m here… let’s see that stuff, Chuckles.”
Cas blushed and Gabriel looked like a scolded kid. “Oui, Papa,” Cas said. “Papa, Maman, this is Dean. My boyfriend. Dean, these are my parents. Charles and Jeanette Delacroix.”
mes chers. (My dears)
“Hello Kitten,” he drawled, and Cas turned to face him.
“I am...” a voice like a spring shower said softly.
Even before Dean opened his mouth, Cas knew. The deep blush that highlighted his freckles betrayed him. “I did… I am so sorry, Dean.”
A sense of foreboding stiffened Castiel’s back. “What? Does that mean he... he’ll come back for Jimmy?”
"He is. He's an old grouch, but with a heart the size of Texas." The fond smile Castiel had seen on Bobby, was now playing around Dean’s lips.
Cas had dinner, got teased by Gabriel for shoveling it down while his brother did the exact same and claiming it was because he had to get to a friend, showered and put his tight jeans back on. After a quick internal debate, he took the slightly too tight shirt Gabe had made him wear on the night he had met Bal, and pulled it over his head. It was black and with the denim button up open over it, Cas thought he looked pretty okay. He happily drove to the mall and got out of Sweetie. His phone dinged with a message and he checked it.
Jack tilted his head in question and Cas chuckled. “She said she would be honoured to be your friend, Jack,” he explained. “And she called you her little duckling. Don’t be offended. It is a term of endearment. I am her little wolf, and Gabriel is her little tiger. Lucien has the weirdest, yet still fitting one: mon vilain, my naughty. Dean is her elf, and Sam her bear.”
Sam flashed his dimpled smile again. "Not judging you here. My brother tends to forget I study, and sends me texts during class all the time. As a matter of fact, just before you got your call, I had texted him back. He always wants to know my test results. As if I wouldn't tell him if I failed one." He rolled his hazel eyes and pulled his slender fingers through his mane.
Salaud - bastard
"Hey Cas. You look like I could have taken the scenic route and not hurry." The gruff voice of Dean sounded amused.
Sam smiled and held up his own phone. “I’m gonna text my friend. Isn’t that something? You, me, and my brother, all falling for our friends. At least we are friends before becoming more.”
Shaking, Cas got to his feet, grabbed his little plastic bag of supplies, and warily cased the terrain outside of the shop.
Cas nearly snorted out in laughter. Oh, if only they knew. “Vraiment?” he huffed instead. “Nothing new under the sun then. Those connards will always argue, always try and make deals, or taunt you.”
"And I need to touch something the monster touched,” she said with a smile, as Cas felt her other hand slide up his inseam.
Naomi looked him straight in the eyes. “He said you
Maman squealed excitedly. "Aaah, mon chaton! I am glad you are making friends."
He hit send and tapped another contact icon. If he was to get Dean his reward, he would have to hurry.
His phone rang, and he couldn’t make himself pick it up.
The girl looked at him, still obviously dazed. “What?”
“In case you have forgotten, I am in the same boat. Except that I was the one walking off. But not only did I find out I have a twin, I also hear that my mother is in that same town. Pardon me for not sticking around!” he barked. “I have no wish to see her. Ever.” He drew a shuddering breath, trying to calm himself. “Look, Gabriel, I handled the sprite. You can thank me by getting Danielle out of that awful mistake she calls a marriage. How about that, hein? Just don’t mention my brother, or my mother again.”
“Yes, Dean, I would love that.” Dean kissed him again in that tender way and Cas sighed at the sensation. “I have to get going though. I am feeling the early morning, and I still have to drive home.” Dean let go, but was obviously reluctant, since he kissed Cas again, pulled back, and then pecked a quick kiss on his lips again.
“No. I’m their lawyer,” Sam had icily replied, but Gabriel had not backed off in the least. That smile had grown lustful and Gabriel had opened his mouth to return volley, when Cas had stepped in and quickly introduced Dean, Bobby and Ellen, glossing over his own presence. Ms. Talbot had shaken hands and taken them on the tour. Gabriel had stuck to Sam like glue and Sam had indulged him. Cas, heroically ignoring his big brother, had pointed out some flaws he knew the house had, and Gabriel had fully agreed that, yes, those were legit problems, and the price should drop at least fifteen thousand.
“Isn’t it?” Cas demanded harshly. “You
Tu sais que Maman interdit les surnoms. C'est ses prérogatives. (You know Mom doesn’t allow those pet names. Those are her prerogative.)
“Oh! That’s right. You said you had a surprise for me!” Looking like an excited little kid, Cas sat down on the bed and put his hands on his knees. Dean had to bend over and kiss him on the nose. He was adorable.
“Hellam…” Dean growled. “Thanks, Crowley. Keep the rest of your demon scum inside as much as you can, ok? We’re on these guys.” He was about to disconnect, when he thought of something else. “Crowley… how big is this group, how urgent is this, and do you need them back alive?” Cas nodded. His Grace had restored itself slowly, but surely, and he was once again at full power. His wings were still a bit scarred, but functional. If need be, he could have them in Pennsylvania in the blink of a human eye.
“Why... no.
Dean shrugged. “I was so at a loss what to buy you for our second wedding anniversary. I honestly thought I would have to tell you that I didn’t have a gift for you, when I suddenly remembered Jack’s words. “Buy him the hive.” So… that’s what I did. I had to reschedule with Sam, who was going to help me get you a swarm, because he had to rush to court.”
Danielle whipped around, her eyes wide. “You believe me?” she asked, incredulously.
“Dean…”
“With this ring, I, Dean Michael Winchester, will marry you, Castiel, Angel of the Lord and member of Team Free Will, and make you my lawfully, wedded husband. To have and to hold, through apocalypses and monster threats, until Death do us part, and afterwards too.” He sniggered and glanced at Jody who blinked innocently. Shaking his head, Dean got to his own part of the vows. “Cas, you took my breath away the very first time I saw you. For ages I kept my distance, not daring to dream, let alone hope that you felt the same way. But now, I can only say that I have never felt more alive, more complete than I am with you. I love you.”
Cas huffed in fake annoyance. “That thing just refuses to be straight.” Sam snorted a laugh, and Charlie blinked innocently.
"Bal, if you keep flirting with me like that, you will not have a conquest to take home with you tonight."
The door to the study opened and Papa walked in. “Jeanette, did you hear when…” He looked up from his phone and halted. “Oh… Oh dear. Have I missed a memo? When did the boys get in?” Cas could see exactly when Papa noticed Jack. His blue eyes softened and he smiled warmly. “Oh, hello, young man. Who might you be?”
“Thank you,” he told the beast. She whuffed softly, and that was the last thing Cas heard, before she tore out his throat.
Castiel nodded, not sure what that had to do with anything.
Cas nudged him with his shoulder. “But you would like it if there was more to it, right?”
Dean rolled down the window and leaned over the passenger seat. "Don't thank me yet, bud. We still have to get her running. You gave Uncle Bobby your number, right?"
Dean pulled over at the curb and checked his watch. "Well, you made it. With minutes to spare."
A quick smile flashed over his face when he heard the crunch of tyres stop, a door clicked softly and then the tyres moved again. His cousins never remembered that he had excellent hearing.
Castiel was grumbling curses under his breath. As much fun and light as the Sunday had been, so full of crap was this Monday. First off, he had overslept. It rarely happened to him, but today it had, and that had just been the tip of the iceberg. His room now resembled a warzone. He had literally pulled almost every item of clothing out of his closet, but most of his pants were gone.
Dean fumbled the ignition and took a few stabilising breaths. “Cas…”
“Don’t be rude, boys. Let the angels in,” Pamela said in a dry tone.
That’s it, my lovelies.
“No. You can easily take off ten thousand. The kitchen is outdated, the guest bathroom too. The so-called ‘design’ gazebo, is just a run of the mill one, but my niece Rachel convinced mom that after Anna had used it as her art project, it was a design item now. It’s not bad,” he amended, after seeing their faces grow doubtful. “The colours are nice and blend in with the garden, but not much of a thing to spend lots of money on. Also, the house has been on the market for three years now. That will reduce the value. Maybe even fifteen thousand off the price, since the paint job is at least as old and needs to be redone.”
Scratching his next embarrassedly, Gabriel chuckled. “Yeah,” he drawled, drawing the word out over several syllables.
He was always very self-conscious about talking like that. He felt like he was thirty-something, and trying too hard to stay young. But Max, gay and twenty-seven, assured him it was very appreciated, especially by Hannah. Max had told him when Dean had hired Hannah, that Hannah didn’t feel either male or female. They were just Hannah. Dean wasn’t bothered by it. Hannah was a good one for the details. Big or small, they had an eye for them. Currently Hannah was eyeing the small lake in the centre of the park. “It’s okay, but maybe we need some pussy willow at the sides. Break that hard line of the fence behind it,” they said and Dean had to agree. “Thanks Hannah. You are right, as always. I’ll ask Cas to add a few to the order. He loves them anyway. ‘Great for brood and early spring feeding,’ he always says.” After saying goodbye, Dean left the site and drove his Baby home, wishing he was going home to Cas as a partner, not just his buddy, as he did every day.
Castiel sighed. Gabriel with his extreme sweet talk... If he didn't need this favour, he would sass him. Pulling a hand through his dark locks, Castiel reined in his attitude and tapped his answer.
Curious, despite himself, Cas leaned in, not minding the sulphur breathing monster at their feet any more. “Princes?”
Cas raised a single eyebrow. “Weren’t you the designated driver?” When Dean started to protest, he chuckled. “I'm good, Dean. I'm 22 actually.” He pulled out his ID to prove it.
"Yes, I am,” Dean replied. “That old Pontiac just needed a bit of TLC and a new oil filter. You shouldn't let Garth diagnose the cars, Bobby. You know he messes that up at times."
(See the end of the chapter for
Hello, dear peeps.
When he was training at the family compound, Balthazar had hinted that there was a solid reason for her disappearing like that, but Cas never asked about it and he didn’t care. In fact, he made a deal to not ever have to see his mother until his dying day.
Well, that cleared up what his brother had seen. It must have been his meeting with Crowley.
Cas cast him a look. “I only pushed and swiped him. He landed on his ass, which should be able to take a pounding by now.” Gabe gasped and covered his mouth, but a grin was visible behind his hand.
The chime of his phone during class had lost its clandestine meaning. Dean often forgot Cas was in classes while he was on break, and he had gotten to the habit of texting Cas daily. Sam, with his dimples and easy manner, teased him a bit about it, but when Cas gave him a single raised brow at the text Sam’s brother sent just a mere five minutes later, the boy chuckled and winked. “Touché, Castiel,” Sam smiled as they left the classroom. “I shouldn’t cast stones, huh?”
Cas smiled and kissed his husband lovingly. “Hello, Dean,” he answered. “What are you doing here? You said you would cook, and there is nothing prepared to even start dinner…” Cas’ heart sank a little. Had Dean forgotten their anniversary? Already? Dean smiled and Cas noticed a dirty smear of dust over his face.
“Why Castiel... I thought you wouldn’t care about little old Naomi,” he drawled.
Cas smiled. “Oui, Maman. And if one of them turns out to be more than a friend… I will let you know.”
Dean blinked, and a grin spread across his face.
Claire sniffled and smiled at Cas. “It’s okay, Cas. Dean promised me we will buy a new angel at the fair next month. OH!” She suddenly stood and grabbed a thick envelope. “This came in for you today. I think it’s the information on that 12 year old boy you want to adopt.”
He kept that bright smile on his face and turned to Dean, then back to Cas. “I am God. Well… a God. My grandfather… he sort of retired, and my dad… well… Let’s say he wasn’t a very fitting heir to the Throne. So I am now God.” Dean blinked. Did this kid honestly think they would buy that crock of shit? “I understand this seems an odd thing to claim, but look…” Jack held out his hand and a beautiful sunflower appeared in his hand, the petals swaying in an non-existent breeze. Within seconds, the bloom wilted, died and crumbled to dust.
Bal hung back a little, but it was all show. "You did make me curious now, darling."
“Well, I like it,” Dean stated, putting a hand on Cas’ shoulder. If Cas leaned into it a bit, no-one noticed, right? They never did. Cas was good in doing these surreptitious things. Dean indicated the logo and smiled. “It’s professional and stylised, yet still personal and warm. Very us, right Cas?”
"It's me." Castiel merely acknowledged.
“He’ll live,” Cas stated calmly, even if his eyes were darting around, trying to find new threats. “He just got a higher dose than you. I will take you home, and him to hospital, but we do need to go... now!”
The soft jingling of her necklace gave away Anna as she softly made her way towards him.
Glancing around, Gabriel bent over to him. "Because not only am I going to grovel to your car, but I'm baking you your pie today."
Wincing at the deplorable grammar, Castiel licked his lips. A blush crept up his neck. Did Dean think his butt was sweet, or was it just a figure of speech? And why would Castiel care? Taking his cue from Dean’s tone, he began tapping out an answer.
Gabriel looked up, legs swinging from the edge of the bed.
She frowned in thought. "Non, except for ze two pair in ze washer, I haf no idea."
“I can’t calm down, Sammy… I’m sure something will happen. Michael will pop up and claim Cas, or the Empty thinks it’s time to be awake and collect the angel that got away… or...or…” Sam could see Dean coming miles away and took him by the shoulders to stop him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel blinked. "Wha...?" he managed, before his mother cut in.
“Dean said his head hurts, Mr. Singer,” Castiel answered. Bobby narrowed his eyes, assessing Dean. “I offered to take him to the nurse,” the kid continued. Bobby nodded. “Good call, Novak. He looks like something Rumsfeld has dragged in.” Castiel stood and took Dean by the arm. “Come on then, off we go.” Dean listlessly stood and followed.
the bastard
“No. My keys. ‘M not happy with you.” Internally Cas cringed at how much he sounded like a petulant toddler, but somehow his mouth had no filter anymore. If this was what being inebriated was like, he’d pass. He hated it. Seeing Dean’s slightly hurt, but adamant expression, he bit his lip. “I- Sorry… I’m being the assbutt. Here…” He handed over his keys and tried to get to his feet. “Jus… Jus’ be careful with her.”
They lit up with a ‘woosh’ and the flames licked high.
Maman giggled again and patted his cheek. “You are adorable, Sam. But if the big brothers are willing to have, how do you say that? A pissing contest?” Sam chortled, but nodded. “Right. If they want to have such an unsavoury contest: not in our house, and definitely not during breakfast.” She sternly glared at the elder brothers. “Am I clear? Can we just assume you both told the other that if they hurt their baby brother, bad things will happen, and have breakfast? Annette made croissants.”
Cas chuckled. “Why is D not home today? Late shift?”
were the words that his heart wanted to blurt out, but his mind objected and changed them on their way out. “Did you like th’ movie?”
Cas crossed his arms and huffed. “The poor boy has a massive crush on you, and you toy with his feelings like this? I thought higher of you.”
“Dean…” His name sounded like a prayer in that voice. Dean snapped out of it. “Coming!” he replied, jogging to catch up. Inside the classroom he saw almost all his classmates, but each and every one was in regular clothing. The only dark green he saw was Aaron’s backpack. What the hell was going on? Dean dazedly took his seat and stared around for a bit.
Gabriel and Bobby gaped at him. “Errr. Yes?” Gabriel wavered.
Heaving a sad little sigh, Crowley shrugged. “Yes, sadly being a demon does not win any beauty pageants. Lucky for us that most people can’t seem to see through the masks, huh?”
He smiled softly at her, before lightly leaning his butt on her hood, crossing his legs at the ankle and his arms over his chest.
Her eyes slid past him and saw the dead djinn. Predictably, she screamed.
Gabriel had opened his mouth already, but doubt snuck into his eyes and he shut it again. "You... you what?"
Those strong hands wiped his sweaty hair from his brow and Dean took a deep breath. “Yes, Cas, what’s bothering you?”
“Ah zut. Why won’t these monsters die less messy?”
“Dean… I don’t feel that way… I wanted to do this. And I definitely want to go on doing this. I was the one starting it, remember? If  anything, you should be the one objecting or feeling pressured.” He blinked at that thought. “Do you feel pressured?”
C’est tout - That’s all
“No,” he said, soundling eerily calm and emotionless. He turned around and walked off. Cas ran after him, worried what Sam might do.
Just the name of his brother had Castiel grip Honey’s steeringwheel tightly.
Cas smiled back, and ducked his head a little. “I am sorry if I was being too snarky about it.”
The demon was all but actually rubbing his hands together.
He hit send and quickly paid attention again. With a sigh Castiel noted that he hadn't missed much. A nudge to his side made him turn around. The guy next to him, his legs stretched to the side of his seat since he was so tall, was sitting back and smirking at him. Castiel raised an eyebrow at him.
A thought sparked in Cas’ brain. “Or both...” he offered. “Maybe the sprite was attached to the wife, and his cheating ass was pissing her off. But killing him would sadden the wife too, so the sprite killed the sidesteps.”
“Dude! That was badass!”
“Lots of us ranchers rent out land, son,” Bobby answered. “Hell, even I do. To a beekeeper, no less.” At Dean’s baffled look, he chuckled. “Remember that tiny bit of meadow we had fenced in a few years ago, because it was awash with Russian knapweed and nothing we did kept it away? Seems bees are safe from it. The guy I’m renting it to, promised to keep it from the fence for at least ten yards. That should ensure the meadow next to it is clean.”
left me to fend for myself since I was 15. Don’t tell me he would want anything for me.”
"Annette, s'il vous plaît! Have you seen any of my good pants?" he called.
In the background, Castiel could hear a vaguely familiar voice call out. "Shut up, Jerk. You don't and you just lost some of the ones I did give you, because you lied."
Cas scoffed at the nickname, but then blinked at the blatant admittance of guilt.
Gabriel tentatively brushed his fingers over the scar. “Holy candy apples! Does it hurt?” he asked, voice trembling.
A cute lady demon tilted her head at Dean and scowled. “Is that a fact? I heard Winchester was dead. Him, his brother, and that angel. Other Hunters have been sending our friends home. Not the Winchesters.”
Oh... why would that be? "Excuse me? Do I make you feel lightheaded? Why?"
Naomi sighed. “No. I didn’t have to. He called me, a day or two ago, saying you were being weird.” She chuckled. “Well, in his words: ‘that idjet is being weirder than his normal weird, girl. You git yer ass there and talk it out with the boy.’ So, I dropped everything, and drove over to him, get rest, get directions and...”
Bal licked his lips and sized Dean up. Then he smirked and said, loud enough for the green eyed man to hear him: “Really, Cassie? You’re leaving me hanging? Cruel, cruel man. I was all but ready to leave with you...Oh well. Maybe next time.”
“Alright, Dean. Can you just not, for once?” Dean? This gorgeous guy was the monster? Cas stiffened.
The doctors at the hospital were curious and alarmed when Cas dropped in with an unconscious body in tow, but after Cas had explained the guy had lost a lot of blood from a neck wound, they hopped to it. In the bustle to get him the right blood, Cas snuck away and got back on the road.
“You wound me. But I don’t have time for idle chit-chat. Why did you call me? It’s not like we won’t see each-other soon. What was it? Six months from your birthday?”
Dean licked his lips and squeezed Cas’ shoulder. “Cas… Is that true? You have a trust fund?” Cas scowled, but nodded. “Dude, Gabriel is right! You were so worried about what your parents would do after you graduated, because of the debt you owe them. If the fund covers that, use it. And if there’s enough left to start your own business instead of becoming a payslave, go for it!”
Cas rose, Dean’s hand still in his, and Dean started shaking. Cas didn’t say anything, but just came closer, and closer, until those pink, chapped lips were brushing his. Dean keened and with his free hand he pulled Cas’ head closer, deepening the kiss.
The world turned red at those words. His vision vague and his arms trembling, Cas stood, Jimmy copying him.
"I reiterate... why?"
"What?" he whispered back.
C'est toi le garçon! Bienvenue! (You’re the boy! Welcome)
Grumbling, Gabriel complied.
Dean scratched his neck nervously. “Yeah… I had to undress you… but you didn’t want pyjama pants…” More memories stirred in the murky swamp of Cas’ brain and he blanched.
Cas blinked. Angels? He didn’t believe in those. They might have fooled Pamela, but not him. He quickly raised the wrist with his rosary and pressed it against Dean’s cheek.
Castiel moaned when his phone dinged with a message. A quick glance at the alarm clock told him it was only eight and on Sundays that was too freaking early. Blindly he groped around his bedside table until his hand found the offending device. Castiel groaned under his breath when the glare of the screen hit him. Good grief... Lucien...
Pleased, Cas dipped his head. “Thank you.”
. Dean raised his brows and blinked. “Geez Samantha, who pissed in your raisin bran this morning?”
He punched the gas and Honey jumped to life, eating up the gravel happily.
"Gabriel, you are punctual as ever, mon cher. Come, sit, eat!" Their mother was sure that the two little chicks that had flown the nest were severely starving all the time.
“Dean?”
Castiel ducked his head. He wasn't used to using crude language, and now he had to. "Ehm... it means... shit."
Cas growled. “You.... âne! Why the Hell didn’t you stop her?”
Without warning, he ducked and spun, grabbing his other cousin around her waist, flooring her neatly.
Cas instantly got up and followed him to his room. “Are you okay, Dean,” he asked once the door was shut. Dean smiled, That was his sensitive angel. Always aware of the other person's mood.
Cas drifted over to his side and smiled shyly. “Hello, Dean.” Dean ignored the warm feeling under his sternum and smiled as he replied. Cas turned his head to the side and smiled. “Hello, Sam, Bobby, Jody. I am glad to see you all.” Dean’s smile faded a bit. He shouldn’t be bothered by it, but he was. Cas shouldn’t be glad to see Dean’s family. He should be glad to see his own, but, as usual, they had not shown their posh-ass faces.
That made Castiel tilt his head in question. "We can?"
“Eh,” Gabriel shrugged. “I think that having his son, freshly turned 21, call him a homophobic douchebag, didn’t help much. Add to that that I also told him I am pansexual and have a slight preference for tall, sweet boys, and his apopleptic rage made him have a coronary.” Gabriel shrugged. “Naomi wasn’t very happy either, but to have a coronary, you have to have a heart, and my dear old mama doesn’t. So that bitch still lives. She threatened to disown me, but hey, I am of age and Nanna’s trust fund is no longer closed to me. I can easily finish my education and open up my bakery.” He cocked his head in a way that clearly showed his relation to Cas. “How about you, little bird? Ready to wow the world and set up your own business?”
Cas mumbled about just wanting to keep it simple, and Gabriel cackled. “You mean to say that this was just a side effect? Oh boy, cous! You are amazing!” Dean took a deep breath. He didn’t want to be rude, that was not what Bobby had taught him, but the guy was intruding.
“Mother, I think I deserve to know, don’t you?” Cas coldly pried. “What does Jimmy have to do with the fact that I’m a Hunter?”
Cas gulped. His chest. Juliet had torn it to ribbons, acidic saliva dripping in the wounds. Surely something should be visible there...
It stopped four feet from him, cutting the engine off.
?” he exclaimed, his wide eyes roaming all over Cas.
Gabriel side-eyed him. "I was trying to smell sex, but it still smells virgin in here."
“Geez! I don’t wanna know what they’re up to!” Dean objected, but Cas stood and poked a finger at the image. It shimmered and shifted like a pool, but nothing happened. “Wait… Is this happening now?” Dean asked, noticing that Sam was wearing the same shirt as this morning, and it sported the grease stain from that bit of fried egg Sam had dropped at breakfast. Jack nodded and waved again. The image shifted to Bobby, talking to Rufus Turner. Another wave and suddenly their peephole had sound.
“Gabriel, Abruti, don’t be rude,” he said as he entered the hallway. Two tall men stood in the doorway. The shorter one looked like he had posed for Da Vinci's ‘Golden Ratio’ and had beautiful green eyes. The guy smiled widely at him and turned to the taller one.
Cas had to collect himself at the innocent yet direct question. Dean took a deep breath and answered for him.
“Bonjour, Madamme,” Castiel kindly said to the lady with the long, cinnamon coloured braid. In his eyes she looked almost native, except that she was too white. “My name is agent Azure. I am here to investigate the... deaths of a few ladies.” He always made sure to exaggerate his almost non-existent accent. It tended to lull people into a false sense of security. As if a person with a French accent would not know exactly how the law in the US worked.
“Gabe?” Cas wavered past his dry throat. “Did he just call you.... cousin?”
C'est la vérité! (That’s the truth)
Cas felt sorry for her. She didn’t ask for such a crappy husband, and now she was all but ready to head to jail for a crime she didn’t commit.
As soon as they were gone, Cas flopped himself on the bed.
Cas peeked over his shoulder and smiled. “I’m rubbing off on you.” Dean stopped filling in the names on his list and looked up, his beautiful green eyes full of questions. “Echinacea? Beebalm?
