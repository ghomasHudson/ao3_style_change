Sherlock’s body bows up off the bed and his head flails towards John.  When he releases his held breath, it’s on a moan that actually contains words.
“Mmmm,” John hums in agreement.  “I suppose some of it is that it’s never quite the same as having your own live concert,” Sherlock smirks, “but, I dunno, you in particular … when you play that one you just….”
“Sherlock?” John calls as he trudges into the kitchen.  He tosses a few carrier bags onto the table – forgot they needed milk, stopped at Tesco; not the closest one to his office, the one nearest the flat; obvious from the sound of his shoes – and bends to pick up a teething ring that tumbled to the floor in the aftermath.  “I stopped for a few things on the way home but didn’t know what you’d want for dinner … is Rosie still out with Molly?  Didn’t know if I’d have to make dinner for all three of us.  Have you had tea yet?”
Sherlock screeches to a halt in the doorway to the kitchen, blinking at least twelve times while staring ahead into space, before he can formulate a response.  “Lady Smallwood,” Sherlock answers, his voice as even as he can manage.  “What an … unexpected pleasure to hear from you this evening.”
“I … have no bloody idea what it was,” John blathers.  And honestly, his head feels completely fucking blank.  He’s lucky to remember his name, really, because it finally penetrates John’s brain that Sherlock isn’t just wanking, he’s bloody well
“Weeks?!”  John’s voice bursts out of him far louder than he intends, causing Sherlock to jump.  “And where the bloody hell was your almighty brother?  Where was Mycroft while you were being beaten to hell for nine weeks?”
John doesn’t respond.  His hands tremble a bit but he keeps stroking her cheek and swiping the cool water gently across the streaks of enflamed skin on her left arm and up her chest and neck.
Sherlock nods, collecting himself and turning towards the kitchen.  “Molly’s going to treat Rosie to a pasty or something equally appetite-demolishing after the park—”
“Of course you can, John; I would never suggest otherwise.  I merely saw that you still seem … unsettled from your dream.  Rosie can likely feel your anxiety.  Perhaps if you just let me take her—”
John scowls, but it’s mostly for show.  “That is practically impossible.  Most days, you never go to sleep!”
“All evidence to the contrary,” he says and takes another drink despite it not being any cooler than a moment ago.
He can’t help the angry edge to his words when he strides towards the stairs.  “She’s starting to blister; we’re going to have to take her to the A&E.  I’m going to get her dressed and I’ll be down in five minutes.  Have a cab waiting.”
“Mary will only ever be a name on paper and face in photographs to Rosie.  She won’t know her mother.  She will, however, know
John chuckles and takes off after him, barely following Sherlock’s high speed chatter about the new baby monitor and nanny camera he’s installed or the nappy disposal dumb waiter/chute he’s built into the wall of John’s bedroom.
Anxious fingers dart all over John’s upper body, skittering up his arms to his chest and then, to John’s surprise, up under his t-shirt where Sherlock’s touch scrambles along his pectorals.  He pushes along John’s collarbone then down the breast bone, heedless of the tug of his fingernails in John’s chest hair.  Although the detective doesn’t completely relax, some of the tension goes out of Sherlock as he slides his hands back down John’s stomach and out from under his shirt. After a few moments of tracing his gaze across John’s bewildered features, the younger man drops flat to his back and brings shaking hands up to cover his face as he tries to regulate his breathing.  John lets the silence hang for a while then slides back down to his pillow and gazes at his friend as he massages the bridge of his nose and avoids John’s gaze.
“Of course not, John,” Sherlock says, snapping the lid of his laptop shut.  He isn’t quite ready to say more than that, so he steeples his fingers in front of him and rests his chin atop them, focusing his gaze on the wall in front of them.
John realizes that at some point, Sherlock put his feet to the floor and mirrored John’s position and leans forward with his forearms across his knees to bridge the space between them.  “Stop berating yourself when there’s no cause for it.  I was careless and I shouldn’t have been.  I also never stopped to consider how it would affect you, given what hap—”
John gulps and nods.  “There’s … something.  And I will tell you, I just … not now, all right?  I just need some time to think it through.”
Predictably the girl squeals in excitement and takes off into Sherlock’s bedroom the instant John cracks the door, buzzing loudly as the towel flaps behind her.  John waits a second before taking off after her.
One day, they are pirates; the next, space explorers; the day after, medieval ruler and loyal subject; Rosie is always delighted.  Young children, he discovers, are uncomplicated this way: so long as Rosie is warm and fed and clean and entertained, she doesn’t care that others find him to be abrasive, arrogant, and utterly devoid of tact; he listens when she babbles, attends to her needs, speaks to her as he would any person and not as a gibbering idiot, and she delights in his attention.  In fact, Rosie seems particularly fond of his stories about bees and pirates (which shows her impeccable taste) and his lessons on basic anatomy (which shows her relation to her father, obviously).  John, in all his sentimental foolishness, declares Rosie to be “just another in the never-ending queue of female hearts trod beneath your feet.”  Sherlock scoffs, ignoring John’s warm grin as he regales his god-daughter with a particularly adventurous tale about Grace O’Malley, assuring the riveted girl that she too could raise an army and scourge the seas someday (though not, sadly, become Irish).
“Yup,” Sherlock says.  “Right.  I’ll just—” he waves an arm jerkily towards his bedroom, “—I’ll go pack a case.  You can … finish.  With Rosie.  I’ll just go.”
“Luff Papa,” she babbles then puckers towards Sherlock for the expected kiss.  Sherlock’s eyes dart briefly towards John then back to Rosie.  He leans forward tentatively, unsure, but Rosie shows no such uncertainty.  She leaves a wet smooch on his lips and then leans back and claps her hands, clearly pleased with herself at the success of this new lesson.
“Come on, Sherlock, you’re so bloody tall, you’ll never fit without bending up at odd angles.  And then you’ll be a complete beast to deal with tomorrow.”
“Promise,” John demands.  “Nothing about you could ever be worse than knowing you were so ashamed that you didn’t think you could tell me.  That I did you such a disservice that you didn’t even want to try.”
“Okay, definitely some swelling,” John murmurs as he works, his eyes tracing over the round of Sherlock’s shoulder, “so I was more than likely right about the dislocation—” Sherlock ignores the pointed glower, “but it’s clearly back in now, so you’ll just have to be gentle with it for a week or so, take some paracetamol for the pain, and—Sherlock, where did you get this scar?”
This gets Sherlock’s attention.  John’s voice remains just the tiniest bit stiff but he’s clearly angling for a casual tone and the fact that he’s attempting to continue the conversation as if there’s nothing odd about the situation certainly deviates from John’s normal attitude about these things.  While Sherlock would never go so far as to call John prudish, he’s always been ruthless about boundaries when it comes to ‘personal space’ – insisting, rather justifiably, that Sherlock has no concept of it whatsoever – so the fact that he’s openly conversing with Sherlock while naked in the bath with his daughter is peculiar to say the least.  When Sherlock catches John’s gaze again, he can see tension bunched in the doctor’s arms but John simply readjusts the cloth at his crotch and looks up to Sherlock with a questioning expression.
“You were talking to the doctor for quite a while,” Sherlock says eventually, his irises almost transparent from the bright light of the screen in the dark cab.
He hears the detective hum in questioning acknowledgement as he riffles through the diaper bag for clothes for Rosie.
“If it’s—” Sherlock starts, turns back to clutch at the counter, and tries again while staring ahead at the cupboards.  “If you don’t want to tell me what it is then say so, but don’t lie and tell me that nothing’s wrong.  Even if I didn’t have the powers of observation that I have, I know you too well not to see that there’s
John scolds himself.  Definitely not the sort of thing you think about surrounded by commuters while on the tube.  Hard not to think about it, though.  The talk he’d had with that last patient, Alex, had stuck with him.  The boy had looked so mortified, as if embarrassed about his entire being just as a by-product of admitting to participating in gay sex let alone enjoying it.  John had wondered, in that moment, if that’s how Harry had felt when she’d first known herself and come out.  He doubts it; Harry had been intentionally, even excessively, brash when discussing and detailing her preferences in those days.  John wonders now if it was bravado to cover up something more like Alex’s feelings.  It made him want to help the young man in whatever way he could.  And if John’s completely honest, he’d wanted to test out the words on his tongue, see how they felt in his mouth, calling Sherlock his boyfriend.
“What is it?” John asks, spoon still clutched in his fingers from stirring an ungodly amount of sugar into his friend’s tea.  He sets it down on the counter and jogs into the sitting room when his friend’s expression melts into one of sorrow.  “What’s the matter?”
John nips that thought in the bud with the simple expedient of rolling over carefully to observe his sleeping friend.  Sherlock lies on his left side facing John and seems to have banished himself as far to the opposite side of the bed as possible without risking his limbs dangling off the bed.  Perhaps it’s a product of his confession that he’s never slept in bed with another person, thinking he’s got to be careful about space?  John’s been in Sherlock’s room while the man was sleeping on a number of occasions and every time, the detective sprawled out in a bent starfish of gangly limbs across every available surface (something that amused John to no end, considering that when sitting, he tended to ball up as tightly as his long arms and legs would allow).  Maybe he was trying to be considerate of John’s comfort.  That seems unlikely, though, given the man’s typical lack of regard for personal space.  What if he was actually
A/N - You guys.  YOU GUYS.  THAT ENDING KILLED ME.  The only thing that made me get through it is knowing that
“Better get to work,” John snaps and flips open the first ledger.  “If we’re going to actually stay the night, I’d like to get to a bed before midnight.”
It pricks at him – of course it does – that his daughter will never know her namesake.  He fights against the lump in his throat.
Sherlock is about to protest when he feels John glide his fingers across the expanse of bed between them.  When they interlock with Sherlock’s fingers, any words the detective may have had on his tongue scatter to the winds.
It feels odd but they chuckle together for a moment, John and this past shadow of Mary.  Quick as a whip, she snaps to serious again.
John stutters to a stop when he sees Sherlock standing in the middle of the room gawping at his phone.  “What’s the matter?” he asks, bending to scoop up Rosie and deposit her on the couch with her tiger.
The progress of the case proves to be similarly frustrating.  The local clerk meets them at the station and takes John and Sherlock immediately to the historical society’s office, giving a swift but thorough explanation of the situation and setting Sherlock up with every paper record and computer file he could need to begin his investigation.  Almost immediately, the towheaded young man declares that he’s going to pop out to a local bed-and-breakfast to secure them overnight accommodations.  John’s eyes dart upwards when Sherlock doesn’t argue; clearly he’s expecting Sherlock to be able to solve it before it would be too late to take a train home since Sherlock had declared the case to be no more than a three or four when he first introduced it to John.
The detective stretches his slim right leg from where it had been crossed over his left and regards it thoughtfully.  “They do come in handy here and there.  Although it does make trouser shopping more difficult.”
kitchen,” John clarifies when Sherlock squints at him as if he’s a simpleton, “not a science lab or a morgue.”
He pauses a moment in front of his arm chair, fingers tapping lightly on the neck of the violin laid across its seat, before he resumes pacing the living room.  “I need a case.”
“Perhaps,” Sherlock says unsteadily, then clears his throat and regroups, “perhaps I should call Molly and ask if she would like to babysit this evening.”
“No, Sherlock.  Your taste is fine for you, but not for me.  I’m Action Man, remember?  Not a bloody Ken Doll.”
“I, erm,” Sherlock mumbles then starts again.  “I took this side of the bed because it won’t put you on your bad shoulder.  I … hope that’s all right.”
“Yup,” John chortles.  “Figured if we both needed a wash, might as well consolidate my efforts.  On a related note, we need a few new flannels.  This was the only one that escaped the initial clean-up effort unscathed and,” he gazes down at his crotch with a lopsided grin, “it may now be tainted by association.”
Sherlock moves out into the foyer towards the stairs but a glance into the kitchen stops John in his tracks.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, come on, look at me.  Look at me!” John says, angling the detective’s shoulders towards him so John dominates his field of view.  “You’re all right.  You’re awake now.  You’re here with me.”
“Because I care about you, Sherlock.  Jesus, you’re my best friend.  You’re the person I love most in the world, apart from my daughter.  I want to understand.  So explain it to me.”
Sherlock shrugs then drags a chair over and digs into the tikka masala with relish, giving John an unrepentant but genuine smile in response.  John just huffs a bit, an expected show of frustration, before he takes a swig from a bottle of water and regards him with a far more astute gaze.
He’s at the point where every single thing someone says to him or does in front of him for the remainder of the day triggers some fantasy of Sherlock.  The woman describing the symptoms of what might be strep throat makes him picture Sherlock on his knees between John’s legs as he sits low in his armchair, fisting a hand in Sherlock’s curls as the detective swallows his cock.  The avid cyclist with the herniated muscle in his groin has John picturing himself perched on the edge of their sofa, clutching the plush cheeks of Sherlock’s arse and spreading him apart, one of the detective’s hands grasping the back rail of the couch behind John’s head and the other splayed on the wall as Sherlock rides his cock.  A young teacher needs a wicked splinter removed from the back of her thigh, a product of playing on the school playground with one of her grammar school students.  As she bends over the exam table and lifts her skirt, chattering away about her students in an effort to distract herself while John works, John has to physically shake his head to banish an image of Sherlock bent over the kitchen table, a hand to the back of his neck as he comes untouched from John fucking him roughly from behind.  His hands shake a bit after he puts a plaster over the wound and wishes the teacher a good afternoon.
“No sense in risking waking her up,” he whispers, then puts a hand on Sherlock’s arm as the detective turns towards her crib.  “Wait a minute…”
When John pads into Sherlock’s bedroom, his heart wrenches in his chest.  The detective stands over his daughter where she just drifts towards sleep, his slim digits creating gentle swirls along her back as it rises and falls with her deep breaths.  It’d taken John ages to talk Sherlock down off of the “but all the articles I’ve read say that she must sleep on her back, John!” ledge, but now Sherlock seems to get a strange amount of peace just sweeping his fingers along her back as she lies curled up on her belly.  Undoubtedly, Rosie is the first baby that Sherlock’s had any kind of prolonged contact with and John can’t help but be amused at how mesmerized the detective is by her most mundane accomplishments and realities.  John’s even caught his friend grinning lightly as he pats her upthrust bottom while she naps, causing John to resolutely banish the word
Sherlock nods.  “Nightmare?” Obvious, but John doesn’t like it when he assumes the blatant facts without checking.
She waits again with a smile on her face as if she could hear the scoff that comes, unbidden, from Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock’s heart thunders in his chest and it’s all he can do to keep a straight face that isn’t crimson.  Just hearing John say such things makes his pulse race and pound at his ear drums.
John pushes tighter against Sherlock’s back and feels the man quiver against him so he gentles his grip at Sherlock’s arms.  “I’m sorry,” he mumbles.  “I’m sorry, I just … God, say you’ll forgive me for what I did to you, even if I didn’t know.”
Sherlock’s fingers tighten on Rosie as she reaches out chubby fingers to John and bleats, “Dada!” but he releases his grip and hands her over to a puzzled John.  The doctor gives his daughter a quick, sweeping glance but finds nothing amiss.
“Some combination of the three,” he jokes.  And because he can’t resist, “Why?  Which one were you hoping for?”
Sherlock glares back and immediately jams his hands into his trouser pockets but it’s no good; the stiffness in his posture is unmistakable and he’s favoring the shoulder in the way he’s holding himself up.
“Well,” Sherlock begins gently but must decide there’s nothing for it because he plows onward with a resolute expression.  “I think she can’t tell us apart.  She is mixing us up.”
“What in the hell am I going to do, love?” he murmurs to her.  “Sorry about the language but reasonably sure you’re not going to repeat it just yet.  Daddy’s just … confused.  He doesn’t know what to do.”
From anyone else’s perspective, John supposes that the way they leap apart from each other when they quit their chairs probably looks fairly comical.  As a matter of fact, the nurse holding the clipboard at the entrance to the waiting room raises an eyebrow as they both stride towards her but, mercifully, she says nothing.  The petite brunette bustles around them taking Rosie’s temperature and weight, getting a look at the burn, and asking for a basic statement on what happened.  The nurse plonks Rosie down on the exam table, shooing them towards uncomfortable chairs in the corner as she examines Rosie’s neck.  John notes a distinct expression of disapproval on the nurse's face when he begins, “Rosie was playing on the floor between us; I’d just handed Sherlock his cup of tea and sat down with my own when—”
“I am not!” he retorts hotly.  “I thought she was a bloody nuisance and spent most of the time wanting to give her a good slap.”
“It’s okay, my love, shhhh.  You’re going to be all right.  Daddy’s going to take care of you.  I’m so sorry.”  This time, the apology gets stuck in his throat and his voice hitches.
By the time Sherlock makes it up the stairs and pushes John’s bedroom door slightly open, John has pulled Rosie from the bassinet and settled back onto the bed with her, attempting (ineffectually, it has to be said) to soothe her.  John’s chest heaves with rapid breaths, he’s covered in a light sheen of sweat, and obviously barely keeping himself calm.  He rocks too fast for it to be comforting to Rosie; Sherlock can tell that it’s a motion more bordering on hysteria than pacification.
Strictly speaking, Sherlock isn’t certain that’s correct and he silently prays that John will let it pass.  He does, but not without a slight narrowing of his eyes that clearly telegraphs his suspicions.
This draws a loud chuckle out of John despite the wobbly feeling in his gut.  “Yes, I suppose kissing Sherlock would be quite an experiment.”
His fingers touch the slim slices across sharp shoulder blades.  “Whipping?  With … a cord of some kind?”
Sherlock’s mouth drops open.  His jaw works as he tries to cobble together something to say, but nothing comes out.  Nothing he can think of seems enough.  John recovers much faster than Sherlock, though.  He hauls himself to his feet, gently releasing his grip on Sherlock’s hands.  Just the tips of the fingers on John’s left hand skim up from Sherlock’s hand, over his wrist, up his arm and lift off near his shoulder.  John’s fingers curl open in the air next to Sherlock’s cheek but when Sherlock gazes up into John’s face, tilting his head quizzically, the fingers clench shut again, flex a few times in the air, and then dart away. Sherlock can’t decide if he’s disappointed.
Staring wall-eyed at John for a moment, the younger man quickly drops his hands and murmurs, “I suppose not
John remains silent for a long while before asking the last question he can’t quite seem to get his head around.  “Why are you doing all of this for me?  After everything I’ve done ... Jesus, Sherlock, I beat you to a bloody pulp back in that hospital.” Sherlock opens his mouth, most likely to protest with some practiced answer, but John steams on.  “Whatever I was going through, whatever I thought about your role in Mary’s death, nothing –
She casts her eyes to Sherlock briefly and he bites off a curt, “I’m very clever.  I’m sure I can keep up.”
and it’s perfect: angry, abrupt sawing at the strings that lets him pick away at the festering wound that is his mood.  Somewhere floating above his concentration on the piece, Sherlock hears the pacing above him stop.  He picks up the tempo and the volume, his fingers racing his bow across the neck of his violin; the metal bites into his callused fingers, his chin slips from the rest and the instrument sways but he thrusts it back against his throat and continues to heave with the motion of it as he forces the notes out.  He’s only a third of the way through the concerto, scowling out the window and his feet scraping against the carpet as he rolls and pitches with the force of the music, when he hears a telltale creak of floor boards behind him.  The music trends upward, quieter and quieter strokes into the highest pitches he can wring from the neck of the violin, when John speaks.
“—I could swan around in Spencer Hart, too, but us mortal beings have to be a bit more thrifty,” John carried on loudly.
“Most A&E doctors would be suspicious of two middle-aged men bringing in a toddler with a burn at this hour of the night, Sherlock.  And on top of that, any good doctor would at least
o	Mid-late Autumn – events of The Lying Detective (extrapolated from implied time apart from Sherlock); Sherlock almost ODs
“Yes.  Case.  Thought it was going to be deadly dull – the clerk at the local historical society having some issues with the local parish’s paperwork to get funding for historical restoration – but it turns out that the clerk hasn’t got any indication that any paperwork was filed and as a matter of fact, when prodded about it, there’s no indication on any of the town’s records that the building even exists.  A cathedral that’s stood since the thirteenth century, completely vanished from the legal consciousness of the entire town, which is fairly difficult to do with no one noticing, as the parish is still thriving and has been since the late seventeenth century.”  Sherlock becomes aware that he’s said all of this very quickly.
Heart kicking against his ribs, Sherlock spends a brief moment debating doing just that.  Telling John that the description does sound like him.  That only John would have bothered to look for something like this rather than simply write Sherlock off as an unfeeling, asexual machine.  That perhaps he can only feel desire for a man’s body when he already desires the heart.  That perhaps this is why he finds himself drowning in want for John every time his fingers touch his own skin.  But although the sense memory of John’s hand smooth and strong within his own still has shocking potency after nearly a month, he still can’t shake the memory of how frightened John looked when he called Sherlock beautiful.
No such luck, of course.  “You want me to give you a reason to share overnight accommodations with John?”
A small smile works its way across John’s face as he moves to the bed.  “That’s fine.  Thanks.  Very considerate of you.”
John swears under his breath, letting loose what may be every single curse word he can think of, and presses his forehead in the gap between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, gripping his arms again for support.
“Don’t lie to me, John,” Sherlock interrupts.  “I thought … I thought that we were trying to … trying to be better.  To each other and to ourselves.”
Something heartbreakingly vulnerable tints Sherlock’s expression.  “It’s just that it’s been so long since you’ve said.  You haven’t called me that in ages.”
Sherlock waves the explanation away.  “Trying to impress her.  Obvious.  Dull.  Thought he could pocket enough of the renovation funds, taxes, what-have-you.  Thought it would make him her equal.  A small-town clerk.  Ridiculous.  Frankly, I should have known it from the start; every person in this case was pathetically attempting to impress someone—”
What if this changes everything?  What will all those people think?  What will the people at the Yard do?  Will it be James all over again, except worse this time, because John’s actually done the thing he’s accused of?  He keeps running over all the things that could happen, all the ways they could explode, fracture each other, and tear it all down.  Lose each other.
Oh God.  John’s eyes pinch shut for a moment and he has to take a steadying gulp of air before he can continue in an even tone.  His heart aches painfully behind his ribs but he tries not to let it show.  He lets a soft hand at Sherlock’s shoulders accompany his words when he speaks again.
“Alex, you do know that this is nothing to be ashamed of, don’t you?  The sex but also learning where your boundaries are.  It’s something everybody learns, no matter who they are and no matter who their partner is.”
They lapse into silence and stay that way for quite some time.  The ticking and settling of the old building echoes around them, mingling with the ambient noise of London from outside the windows, but the two of them stay as they are for nearly an hour while Rosie sleeps.  Eventually, Sherlock gets up and mills about the sitting room, collecting his laptop and a few other things he anticipates needing, placing his case in front of the sofa next to John’s.  John fiddles about in the kitchen filling a few cups of snacks and packets of juice for Rosie that he stuffs into her diaper bag to pass on to Molly.  They circumnavigate each other throughout the two rooms but don’t speak until they hear the doorbell, Mrs. Hudson’s chirrupy greeting, and the shuffling footsteps on the stairs that follow.
Sherlock wavers forward, nearly banging into the desk.  Mary pauses on the video as if she’s really there, watching and waiting for him to collect himself.
“Wake up, Sherlock.  Come on, come back to me.  I know you can hear me, come on.  Wake up, Sherlock.”  His voice sounds desperate towards the end.  The last thing he wants to do is startle the man – he has too much experience with what can come from waking someone in the throes of a nightmare, especially if it’s something like PTSD.  Contrary to what John had hoped for that his voice, as calm and reassuring as he can manage, would soothe his friend and allow him to shake loose from the dream but the sound of John’s words seem to catapult Sherlock into agony.
It takes a few minutes but the rest of the tension drains out of Sherlock.  He just breathes and clutches his hand in the front of John’s t-shirt and listens to the slow, steady thud of John’s heart beating beneath his ear.
Sherlock resists the urge to grind his teeth at the phrase ‘little blog’ which has generated the interest of actual royalty before, not to mention saved his brother’s ample arse in the last year.  “I’ve already checked with Lestrade; he doesn’t have anything that meets my needs and neither does the website.”
This teases an actual laugh out of the detective.  “Presumably.  As a matter of fact, I gather that she was the instigator, as it were, since she ended the conversation in order to … resume activities.”
When he first extended the invitation for John to move back in Sherlock had imagined that the experience of having a small, developing human in his home on a constant basis would be tolerable at the best of times and frustrating at the worst.  It is a frustration he’d happily accept on John’s account, but a frustration all the same.  After all, small children are a never-ending cycle of messy foods, squashy or noisy toys that litter the floor, drooling mouths, grabbing hands that can upset chemicals and experiments, and near-constant need for diligent attention.  Instead of inconvenienced, Sherlock finds himself nothing less than intrigued and enchanted by the girl.  His tiny god-daughter is a marvel: at times, watching her progress feels like witnessing a self-sustaining experiment conduct itself in front of his eyes; at others, he staggers at the simplicity of her sheer joy and uncomplicated affection.  Even when she is inconsolable for no discernable reason, Sherlock feels pulled to her in a way that he has only ever experienced once before (with her father).
The smile becomes more real when John laughs again, that delighted giggle he usually gives when Sherlock has said something ridiculous or scandalous.  This time it just seems … fond, which causes Sherlock’s heart to thud heavily in his chest.
Sherlock slowly stands from his half-crouch, leaving the shirt in a pile on the floor, and reaches out once more for the violin.  Once the neck of it is in his hands, Sherlock seems to be at a loss, he gazes around for a moment before retrieving the bow and then stands in the center of the room, his hands awkwardly drooping at his sides.
Sherlock says in answer to the half-formed question on John’s lips, “but not the way most people do.  Or so I gather.  I don’t feel attraction to an entire gender en masse, I don’t feel attracted to subsets of people, I don’t ‘have a type’, I don’t walk into a pub or a supermarket or a coffee shop, see a stranger and feel attracted to them the way so-called normal people would, John.  I just … don’t feel those things that way.”
“Yes, thank you,” Sherlock says in a clipped, frosty tone that has the girl jerking in place as if she’s just woken abruptly.
Sherlock jerks so violently in his chair that John clutches at the man’s leg with his free hand and shushes him.  They lean back together again once John throws the receptionist a tight smile.
John lets the room fall back to silence again as his fingers retrace all the marks on Sherlock’s back.  The detective stays quiet but shudders and quakes as John’s touch traverses his skin.  Sherlock doesn’t stop him, though, and the longer things go on, the more he feels Sherlock leaning back into his touch.  Just a tiny, tiny bit but he’s doing it.  John flattens his palms against the back of Sherlock’s shoulder blades, letting his fingers curl up and over.
“Just because you don’t witness my exercise doesn’t mean it doesn’t occur, John,” the detective rejoins, smirking.
Possessed of an odd mood in the moment, John performs a tiny experiment: he slides his hand slowly towards Sherlock’s, extends a finger, and traces the deep lines etched across the center of the long, warm palm face up on the mattress between them.  Sherlock gives a sudden deep inhale, his fingers extending out like the petals of a flower seeking sun but then closing over John’s, trapping the tip of his pointer finger in a loose grip.  John studies Sherlock’s face carefully but the detective’s features remain relaxed in sleep, so John opens his hand and brushes the rest of his fingertips across the backs of Sherlock’s fingers.  The fine-boned hand opens and Sherlock’s fingers swirl over his, gently caressing as they move back and forth, around and between John’s own; a small smile appears on the bowed lips and they puff out a bit with an exhaled breath as Sherlock snuggles deeper into the pillow.  John’s chest feels too tight.
Next chapter will have some incredibly emotional, difficult scenes (in my opinion) but are some of the best character development I think I've ever done.  Stay tuned.
Sherlock’s curls bounce a bit as he gives a single tight nod.  John sees his hunched shoulders work as he pulls Rosie from the sink, wraps a towel around her bottom and cradles her against his chest.
Sarcasm and amusement are plain on Sherlock’s face as he lounges languidly across from where John has gone rigid.  Suddenly all of his hinky behavior over the last few months makes sense and it’s all because of a bloody cup of tea.  It was something he’d done for Mary, making her tea first so it would have time to cool before she drank it.  When she was pregnant, she’d had trouble with her teeth and gums being extremely sensitive, so he’d gotten in the habit of making her tea before his own and blowing on it to cool it before he gave it to her.  She seemed equally amused and touched by the process because she always remarked that by the time hers was cool, he was so impatient and intent on sharing the evening ritual with her that he burned his mouth on his own because he refused to wait for it to cool.  He’d once gotten frustrated and asked her what was so bloody sweet about that and she’d favored him a brilliant smile before answering, “That’s real love, John: a man who’ll burn his mouth every night just so I won’t drink my tea all alone.”  Thinking back on it, John realizes he’s been doing the same thing with Sherlock for months now, the damn nightly tea scalding.  If he stacks it up in his mind next to the trail of snacks, the annoyance at Irene Adler’s texts, the terror at Sherlock’s injury, and that moment in the alley, it’s impossible for his brain to miss what this really means.  Jesus.
do, really, except finish bathing, go out there, and climb into bed with that long-limbed wank fantasy made flesh that his best friend has become and somehow
John has very little doubt that he has Mrs. Hudson to thank for this; she’s been subtly prodding at John about Sherlock’s involvement in Rosie’s rearing since they moved into Baker Street with him.  He’s been avoiding the discussion as slyly as he can but apparently she’s decided to force the issue by teaching Rosie to call Sherlock ‘Papa’.  Can’t point that out to Sherlock, though, given the carefully blank expression on his angular features.
Sherlock enunciates.  “You’re a terrible influence.  Next thing you know, you’ll tell me it’s late and we should turn in.”
“Lamb Tikka Masala.  I went down to the pub – which is right next door to our bed-and-breakfast and the clerk assured me it is
When Sherlock’s expression doesn’t change, a look of tentative unease flashes across John’s face.  He seems … nervous.  Odd.  Sherlock lets the bow drop and then quenches the vibration of the strings with his fingers.  The room is plunged into sudden silence but for the noise of London outside.
gay men would be aroused at the idea of having something that looks like a cock penetrate them, but as Mycroft would say, ‘balance of probability.’”
Sherlock turns his back, walks towards the window, and fingers his violin where it’s propped in the corner of his chair.  “I’m not her father, John.”
Eva clears her throat as she deposits a key in John’s waiting fingers.  “There’s fresh linens on the bed – David let us know you were coming – and I’ve already put towels, flannels, soap, and things in the ensuite bath.  Hopefully you won’t need anything else but feel free to come down and see me if you do.  I’m on all night.”
When John opens his eyes again, Sherlock’s face pinches into an odd expression and one hand twitches up towards his left shoulder.
To his very great surprise, Rosie actually appears to consider the question.  After a moment, she reaches out to pat John’s lips with her fist.
wouldn’t it be most likely to be John?  After all, if he only feels attraction to men that he’s emotionally connected to then getting some sign of attraction would more or less confirm that Sherlock feels something for John, wouldn’t it?  Of course, John felt a sick swoop of guilt last night at the idea of purposely goading a sexual reaction out of Sherlock in order to ransom his emotions, which is precisely why he hadn’t decided to actually act on it in any firm way.  The universe, it seems, is not without a sense of humor though because Fate took the decision entirely out of John’s hands, and even if John
John sits back and mirrors Sherlock’s cross-legged position, although Sherlock’s fairly certain it is an unconscious move.  “Ah.  DIY, then.”  John smirks at his own joke which fizzles a bit when Sherlock merely shrugs.  “So, you’re not ….” He trails off as he visually scrambles for the appropriate term.  “… active?”
“Yes, well,” the nurse says in a tight voice, but she doesn’t finish the thought.  Her eyes dart between them and John’s not sure, but he’s reasonably certain the disapproval only intensifies.  Despite the fact that, at one time, John might have seen that censorious stare and quickly removed his hand from Sherlock’s, John finds himself clasping the long digits all the more, sitting straighter in his chair and pinning her back with his best military glare that he used on unruly privates in Afghanistan.
felt attracted.  Maybe it’s arrogant of John to just assume that it would be him, but with Sherlock, who else would it be?
“As I attempted to tell you earlier, John, this case is more involved than I initially anticipated.  It’s—”
John,” Sherlock says with a heavy tone of distaste.  “The clerk trying to astound his MI6 paramour, Lady Smallwood allowing me to be the one to root out the mole in MI6 was obviously a ploy to get on Mycroft’s good side, even—”
John huffs quiet laughter and moves to the sofa, dropping his bag at one end and sitting at the other, elbows folding over his knees so he can lean forward towards the pair of them.  The detective rotates in his chair to face John, pulled inexorably towards him as always, but says nothing further.  After a moment, John raises a hand and strokes his palm over Rosie’s back in small soothing circles, his fingertips brushing against Sherlock’s wrist in rhythmic glances of touch.  The moment feels comfortable in silence but Sherlock’s chest aches.  However much he once might have ridiculed such saccharine musing, he now ponders if perhaps this is why people yearn so desperately to have children with a person they love.  The child curled in Sherlock’s arms is not his own but … but it feels as if she is, as if she lays against his chest because she belongs to him, as if John’s fingers linger on his skin because John belongs to Sherlock as well.  In that moment, he wants so desperately for this notion to be the truth that the force of what he feels for John stifles him.  He presses his cheek back into Rosie’s hair.  He has to hide from John because with the enormity of the feeling, there’s no way he could turn this face to John and expect him not to see.
The boy is silent.  John checks for a few more warning signs but based on what he can see, poor Alex is just a victim of inadequate or rushed preparation and isn’t all that much worse for wear.
John’s cheeks are pink from the cool December evening and when his gaze locks with Sherlock’s, the flush deepens.  He doesn’t look away, though.  John flinches comically when Sherlock’s sentence sinks in.
“Sorry,” he says, his voice pinched.  “Sorry, I … habit.  You know, after spending so many nights sleeping next to Mary and all.”
“Everything you’ve said about not wanting to pursue sex is in the past, but all that about how you feel attraction is in present tense.  Feel, not felt.  You
“But look at all the people she will be surrounded by who love her.  She will grow up without a mum, but she will have all those other people who will love her and care for her and protect her: Mrs. Hudson, Molly, Lestrade, Mycroft even—”
Sherlock’s heart seems to stop in his chest when John kneels up on the bed and clasps at the round of Sherlock’s shoulder with one hand and slides the other up the arm supporting Rosie.  With John on his knees on the bed, they’re of a height, so when the doctor leans forward and places his lips on Rosie’s cheek, John is so close that Sherlock can feel the warmth of John’s breath strike his throat in just the same place as Rosie’s.  John pulls back from Rosie but doesn’t pull away, doesn’t drop back to the bed, simply kneels here close to Sherlock.  He’d never precisely understood the idea of feeling as if your heart was in your throat until that moment, with John’s hands on his arms, John’s sleeping daughter clasped between them, and John’s eyes tracing over his face in the darkness.  He feels his arms begin to tremble.  He
“Maybe Sherlock does feel the same.  What do you think?  Do you think Sherlock loves Daddy?” he directs at the little girl currently buzzing her lips and patting her hands together.
When their lips press together, Sherlock gasps noisily against John’s mouth before opening his lips to surround John’s.  It’s fairly chaste, as kisses go; just a gentle movement of mouths against each other and not even a hint of tongues, but John feels it down to his toes.  Sherlock unwinds his arms from around his own ribcage to cup his hands around John’s face, palms splayed against John’s cheeks, fingertips massaging his skin where they start to run into his hair.  John’s fingers clutch at Sherlock’s hips and pull him closer.  When John’s teeth clamp down on Sherlock’s heavy bottom lip just enough to scrape the delicate skin, the detective gasps and keens out a low
Rationally, John probably could have determined that all on his own.  Even so, he also knows that rationality rarely comes into play when dealing with your child being injured, so he’s not too ashamed of the heavy sigh of relief that comes out of him when he stands to retrieve Rosie.  Sherlock stands – silent and still, more’s the wonder – next to John, giving a single squeeze of his hand before John moves towards the exam table.  The girl thrusts her arms in the air the instant John nears her, whimpering at him as he hugs her to his chest.  He shakes the doctor’s hand again and gives her a rueful smile when Sherlock insinuates himself between the two of them and sweeps out the door without another word.
John thinks the word.  He thinks it and doesn’t want to say it because he knows it’s the right one but God, he doesn’t want it to be the right one.
“I can’t imagine what it would be like to hold my hand over your heart as it stopped beating and have to—”
Sherlock turns away from John long enough to smooth his expression, making a show of taking off and folding his dressing gown to justify his hesitance.  Knowing he can’t dither any longer, Sherlock makes his way back to the bed and slides beneath the sheets.  Every skin cell uncovered by his pajamas soaks up data, cataloguing the warmth left behind by John’s body, the smell, the radiating heat of John’s body so nearby.  John has rolled away, facing the wall even though it puts him on his bad shoulder; Sherlock stares up at the ceiling, mind racing.  He can tell just from the expanse of John’s back that he sees out of his peripheral vision that the muscles are tense; John wants to say something but is holding back.  Sherlock breaks the ice as best he can.
Scoffing, John pads back for his own tea and returns with the steaming mug.  “I was medicine not architecture, remember? And with you to remind me how ordinary I am all the time?  Must be Mary’s influence.”
Sherlock can feel a blush rise up but he answers as best he can.  “I don’t really have an answer you’ll find satisfying, I think.  It varies.  I’ve certainly done it more frequently since you’ve moved back in.”  He says it without thinking so he startles a bit at the astonished look that graces John’s face.  Before the doctor can make any assumptions, Sherlock quickly amends, “Common animal behavior, John; normal response to introducing another sexually mature adult into a confined ‘herd’.”
John looks as if he is going protest but then startles, as if he’s only just realized how aggressively he’s been swaying back and forth.  A quick gaze down at Rosie’s mottled face and John hands her over to the detective, cursing under his breath.
“Well, he did have an inside man, as it were, in MI6.  I could understand why he felt a bit cocky.”  John grunts as he drops his overnight case next to the stairs leading up to his bedroom and follows Sherlock into the sitting room.  “Inside woman, I mean; the girl in MI6 who was helping him embezzle.”
“You know what?” John says, his tone aiming for bracing but coming out stilted.  “I think we both need a bit of time to digest everything from tonight.  I’m going to go down and get Rosie from Mrs. Hudson and take her for a little ramble around Regent’s Park before it gets dark.  Will you … be all right?”
Sherlock finally brings his gaze up to John’s face and he feels wrong-footed in that he has no idea what to make of the mixture of emotions chasing across John’s face.  He’s not even sure he can name them all.
Sherlock knows what John is really trying to ask but he can’t come right out and acknowledge it, so he hedges for a safer, ambiguous answer.  Still true, anyway.  “Never as an adult either,” he says.
Unsurprisingly, the nurse withers under the stare, mumbles, “I’ll just go see if the doctor’s available to see you now,” and darts out of the room.
Sherlock pants as if he’s just run a race but his eyes finally focus and lock onto John’s face.  They’re still alight with hysteria and beads of sweat run down from the younger man’s hairline, but at least he’s concentrating on John’s face.  Long slim fingers close around John’s biceps and clamp a hard grip as John pulls them both up to a sitting position.
“John, you most certainly are not that sort of father,” Sherlock remonstrates in a harsh whisper.  “You dropped the cup by accident—”
– should excuse what I did to you.  You were dying and I knew it and I still—Christ, I damn near killed you.  Smith had to stop me.  The man who was a bloody
The Monday after the A&E incident, he’s running incredibly late getting ready for work.  Rosie spent the entire weekend cutting another tooth and being completely miserable about it; Sherlock hasn’t had a case in nearly a week.  As a result, John spends the majority of his two days’ rest dealing with two unreasonable children.  Sleep deprivation, John decides with one last look in the mirror before leaving, is not a good look on him.  He’s just glad Sherlock hasn’t left his room yet this morning, otherwise he’d likely have heard an exhaustive list of all the ways he looks like complete and utter shite this morning.  As a matter of fact, he hasn’t looked or felt this knackered since Rosie started sleeping through the night at eight months old.  It’s not entirely surprising, then, that John’s gotten halfway to the Baker Street tube station before he realizes that he’s left behind Rosie’s medical records that he’s supposed to fax over to her new pediatrician this week in anticipation of her two-year-old checkup at the end of next month.  He grouses to himself the entire walk back to the flat, periodically checking his watching and swearing.  At this rate, he’ll be so late it’ll be lunch time when he gets there and he knows he’s far too curt when he rings the clinic to warn them but he really can’t be bothered to be polite.
“It doesn’t matter anyway.  I’ve already said, I only ever feel sexual interest when I’m already interested in the
Sherlock whines and the tone yanks John from a flood of self-loathing.  “Living through Serbia was dreadful enough; listening to you flog yourself over it three years after the fact is
“Case?” Sherlock asks, damning himself for only being able to manage this.  “Case, no.  Not a case.  More of a … study, I suppose.”
John stems the tumble of remorseful self-flagellation into his folded hands and lifts his head.  He’s taken his chair across from where Sherlock has curled up in his own, head hung low between his shoulders as he hunches over his knees.  God, after all these months of trying like hell to be better, healthier, he’s still
“Huh,” John responds, amused.  “Now I know your grand plan for retirement: Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, scientist … beekeeper.”
She laughs at his stunned expression.  “Mr. Holmes’s story.  It was a bit too smooth.  I’ve seen that here a lot, although usually with much more nefarious intentions.”  Her face pinches then turns up with another lopsided smile.  “Give yourself a break, John; it could have happened to anyone.  And really, you’re lucky to have someone who cares so much about protecting you.”
chest that I’m pressing my fist into while you bleed out in front of my fucking eyes and I’ve had enough of losing the people I love!  I’ve bloody well had enough, do you hear me?”
Without even thinking about it, John begins to protest and, once again, Mary seems omniscient because she holds up her hands as if shushing him.
“Would you mind getting her nappy and outfit changed and taking her downstairs for breakfast?” he says as casually as he can.  “I would love to start one day with a nice, long shower before I’m covered in baby food, wee, or diaper cream and cursing you for using all the hot water.”
Both of Sherlock’s hands still but don’t leave their appointed positions.  John wrenches his gaze up to the detective’s face, florid and tipped towards him with an inquisitive expression.
He turns a beseeching look to John with eyes that quite clearly entreat John to just go along with the story.
John nearly bites his tongue in half at the way Sherlock practically leaps away from him when he shouts this.  The detective curls his arms around his stomach, still facing away from John.
“John!” he yells when he doesn’t see the doctor in the sitting room.  “John, the case!  Where are you?”
“No,” John says and then his cheeks flush when Sherlock blinks up at him in surprise.  “I mean, you don’t have to hide from me anymore.”
Sherlock lets the high, trilling note linger, his bow still moving in continuous strokes as he turns to regard John.  He knows what he must look like to the doctor: flushed about the cheeks, sweating lightly, scowling to high heaven; and yet, John just quirks a small smile at him.
Sherlock implores; his voice sounds strangled.  “Given everything I’ve told you this evening, don’t you see how much more difficult that question is than any base discussion of masturbation?  How that particular fact might be my most private confession, given where attraction comes from for me?”
“In hindsight, I’m sure that was part of it, all rolled in to my PTSD now.  But Sherlock, I—”  he swallows before continuing, “What happened to Mary wasn’t just awful because I lost my wife, the woman I loved, right in front of me and I had to just sit there and watch it happen and not be able to help her.  That’s bad enough.  But I sat there holding in her blood from a bullet in her chest … and it felt like being back in Magnussen’s office, pressing my hand over the spot where a bullet was lodged in your chest, watching the light go out of your eyes in the back of that ambulance and….”
“We’ve … erm,” Alex stumbles, “only had sex just the once before last night, you see.  So I guess that’s why … I mean, he’s a lot bigger than me – taller, I mean! –” Alex bleats out, turning beat red, “—and he was very keen on it, so I don’t think he realized he was being a bit rough when he was behind me and ….”  Alex trails into silence for a long moment.
He hears muffled laughter and splashing, then John’s voice from the back of the flat.  “Giving Rosie a bath, give me a minute!”
to men.  But … very rarely.  I typically have no interest in sex with other people because I don’t typically feel attracted to other people. For the most part, any interest in sex is merely a byproduct of being a sexually-mature adult and rarely involves a desire for another person.”
“Why?  Why does it matter to you, John?  After seven years of silence on the matter, why should my sexuality suddenly be so important to you?”
A swift, loaded pause and then the unmistakable click of his brother’s shoes on the entrance way tiles.  “Is there a list?”
“Babysitter,” she says without hesitation.  She comes up close and uses two fingers to push the tube of cream for Rosie into his front trouser pocket rather than the much more accessible jacket pocket.  Her smile is unrepentant in the face of John’s raised eyebrows.  “Hoping for an excuse to slip you something much more exciting than medicine.  Maybe my cell number.  For house calls, obviously.”
Next to the definition, John had penciled in, scribbled over, and then erased the words “Sherlock?” and “Love = sex? Sex = love?”.  Sherlock isn’t certain what to make of this, exactly, but it does make his heartbeat roar within his chest.  A thin, snaking arrow next to the circled definition wends its way down the page and draws his eyes to a note down at the bottom.
embarrass himself spectacularly by going full mast hard the instant he gets in bed.  Christ, what a nightmare.  He curses Mycroft and Lady Smallwood and whoever the fuck else is responsible for this case.  If they’d stayed in London, John would have had home field advantage for giving a little push at what they’d been dancing around this morning.  There’d been no doubt in John’s mind that Sherlock had been looking at John – or at least, trying not to look and failing miserably – in the bath and if he’d been at home right now where he could retreat to his bedroom if it turned out he was wrong about things, this would have been so much bloody easier.  Instead, he’s out in a little hole-in-the-wall town (which he probably would have found lovely in other circumstances) investigating something that Sherlock should have been able to solve without even putting his trousers on and now having to share a bloody bed with him.  Although, thinking about Sherlock without trousers on will definitely not aid the situation, considering what was going on the last time he saw Sherlock without trousers.
A low rumble of voice that could be his name hits John’s ears as he leans towards the door but Sherlock talks to himself when John’s not there all the time, so it doesn’t stop John from swinging the door open to ask his question again.  Once John takes a step into the room, the enquiry freezes on his lips and all his stunned brain can manage to put forth is that he’s not sure whether or not he wishes he hadn’t come in.  He barely even registers the feel of the doorknob in his hand as he clutches it for support, he just stares.  And stares.  And no matter how much he stares, he can’t seem to process what he’s seeing.
Something in John’s chest tightens at the notion that Sherlock never questions the two of them growing old together.  After a long moment of silence where they just seem to both be content to smile at each other, Sherlock’s gaze slips again … over the curve of John’s bare left shoulder, down his chest, and gets stuck at his waist where his hand still clutches his towel, but he’d gotten so distracted that his grip loosens to the point of absurdity, and the worn terrycloth hangs low.
“Nothing, John.  Not taxes, utility bills, a parish registry, requests for the numerous historical renovations that have happened in the past … not even a careless teenager getting a parking ticket outside the car park.  Nothing at all since the mid-nineties.  This building has stood in this exact spot since the 1300s; surely
John can’t help the way he straightens up; his laughs a bit when she leans towards the camera, as if she believes John should be taking notes.
In a disconnected way, John tells himself that it isn’t really anything all that shocking.  As Sherlock himself said, he’s human and has the same needs and ‘biological imperatives’ as any other mature human male.  Erections, particularly in the mornings, are just another thing that proves this.  John just hadn’t been quite so
The experiment data from earlier in the day can’t keep his attention, though.  As a matter of fact, he can’t help but sift through the change in John’s behavior over and over in his head; try as he may, he can’t make it coalesce into any coherent pattern or conclusion.  The only idea he keeps coming back to, unfortunately, are the words from Mary’s last message:
“And there’s the back of the t-shirt,” Sherlock finishes without much thought.  He can hear John stiffen – or, rather, he notes the sudden complete silence – before he realizes the last time those words were said to John.  The whole Magnussen ordeal leaps up in front of his eyes and through the haze of memory, Sherlock can see conflict and hurt on his friend’s face.
“Oh, sorry, love,” John murmurs, leaning over to whisper in your ear.  “Didn’t mean to upset you, just needed to teach your—”
He feels Sherlock’s back heave as he swallows heavily.  “That wasn’t a statement on your character, John.  It was just … one more item in the heap of things that make me a freak.”
Sherlock gives her the same story as he’d given the nurse only with a little more charm and a little less anxiety.  More than once, John notes that every time the doctor’s focus shifts to John, Sherlock’s hand alights somewhere on John’s body: first the back of his knuckles against John’s elbow, then a palm over his wrist, and when Dr. Simon favors John with a bright smile, spread fingers that linger on John’s thigh.  That last one has John falling back on his military training so he won’t let the surprise show on his face.  After the quick recitation of the story, Dr. Simon reaches out both hands towards Rosie so John hands her over, murmuring to her when the girl whines a bit in protest.
Sherlock whispers, but even though his tone is sharp, he threads an arm around John’s back and places his open palm behind the shoulder where Rosie rests.  “You’re too hard on yourself.”
Sherlock pulls a face that makes John chuckle and deposits his mobile in his pocket.  “Just finished, I think.  Grotesque.”
John swallows around the lump in his throat and stares up at the ceiling.  “Yeah.  But when we first became flat mates, you didn’t exactly sign on for ‘emotionally damaged widower with PTSD and a toddler’, did you?”
“Absolutely,” Sherlock confirms, grinning into Rosie’s face as she starts buzzing again.  “Fascinating creatures.”
“Daddy loves Papa, too, you know.  Has for some time now.  Probably longer than he cares to examine.”
A long moment of silence passes because John can’t seem to say the word.  Sherlock eventually gets frustrated and snaps at him.
The memories of tending to the aftermath of Alex’s rather vigorous activities with his partner – and their basic similarities to John and Sherlock – allows a lurid vision to bloom in John’s mind that differ from all the other images he’d pictured so far.  Perhaps because of the method of Sherlock’s masturbation this morning, all of John’s mental wanderings so far portray Sherlock as breathlessly lustful but always submissive to John, eagerly welcoming John fucking him regardless of whether Sherlock was technically on the top or bottom.  With Alex, though, the similarities were too obvious to miss – sandy-haired and blue-eyed; gushing on about his tall, dark-haired, sharp-minded boyfriend who’d been keen to the point of roughness – so his mind circles around and suddenly John’s unable to stop a vision of himself kneeling on Sherlock’s stark white sheets with his legs spread, clutching the headboard, hands framed by Sherlock’s own.  As he sits quietly in the corner of a tube compartment, he imagines the detective’s slender frame bracketing his own, a litany of filthy praise dropping from those wicked lips as the muscles in his hips work, pounding himself into John, pulling groans that John can nearly feel tearing themselves from his mouth….
John gives an unsteady chuckle and kisses her chubby cheek.  “I don’t like being sad either, my love, but it seems to be my lot in life.”
John’s breath falters when Sherlock’s thumb sweeps across the top of his.  Another gentler sweep when some of the tension slides out of John’s shoulders.
John raps his knuckles against the door.  “Sherlock?  I’m looking for Rosie’s medical records, have you seen them?  I was sure I put them in the top drawer of the desk but they’re not there ….”
A plan for upcoming works in this series and a timeline with the character's ages, because damn it, I couldn't keep it straight.
John huffs as he carries the last of the boxes seventeen familiar steps, stopping at the landing halfway up to hitch a bag of Rosie’s things higher onto his good shoulder before proceeding.  Scowling darkly, the doctor growls at Sherlock’s retreating back as the man scales the next flight towards John’s room, toting the old army footlocker as if it were a shoebox.
“Sherlock,” he says gently, leaning in towards his friend so that his voice can penetrate in the most non-jarring way he can manage.  “Sherlock, come on now; wake up.”
John blinks and furrows his brow.  “Well, you were a few inches wide of the mark.  Left shoulder.  You know that.”
Sherlock doesn’t mention it when John’s arm slides up around Sherlock and over the ball of his shoulder.  He just angles his face in towards John’s chest, so John lets it pass when Sherlock scoots closer, his long body touching John’s all the way down to their ankles.  John drifts back into sleep listening to the puffs of Sherlock’s breaths against his chest.
Sherlock tilts his head in confusion but doesn’t get the chance to ask before John answers the unspoken question.
Sherlock pins John back with a withering glare.  “Oh for God’s sake, are you on about ‘High Wycombe’ again?  Honestly, John, you seem more obsessed with her than I ever was.”
John huffs with laughter before he realizes that Sherlock is in earnest.  “Why on Earth would you think that?  It’s not as if I look like a human stick insect, too; I’m fairly certain she can tell us apart.”
John hands a nappy through the door once he’s slid on his dressing gown, jogging up the stairs to prepare to head out on an adventure.
Sherlock seems completely nonplussed with the progress of the entire situation, his face a stark mask of surprise and … hope?  Apparently, he’s not quite sure he deserves what happened, but he’s clutching Rosie tightly enough to his chest that maybe he just doesn’t want to admit he’s pleased with it.
Sherlock swings around, gesturing to his own chest, and then freezes when he catches John’s raised eyebrows.
A soft wuffling sound comes from Rosie, vibrating against Sherlock’s pectoral, and he smiles when he realizes that she’s fallen asleep on him.  John must realize as much as well, a short exhalation of breath taking the place of a laugh.  Sherlock lifts his head and regards John, gesturing briefly towards his bedroom with his chin, indicating his intention to lay Rosie down for a nap.  John looks … disappointed for a moment – odd – then nods silently.  Upon returning to the sitting room, Sherlock finds John unmoved but for the hands that have clasped between his knees, so Sherlock resumes his seat at the desk.  John clenches and unclenches his fingers a few times before he speaks in a low voice, his eyes darting towards the now-closed door of Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Now,” Sherlock begins in a business-like tone, his ‘armor’ back in place, “let me show you some modifications I’ve made to the flat in anticipation of your arrival.”
Usually I wouldn't put this BEFORE the fic (so as not to bias you) but when you're reading the section where Sherlock plays for John, I want you to have these songs in mind, as they inspired/informed how I wrote what I wrote:
“Secondly,” John continues in a sharp tone after clearing his throat, “the man I’ve known all this time would never choose something like this at random.  You’re a scientist and a detective, you wouldn’t choose a potentially inadequate tool for a job.  Moreover,” John says thoughtfully, sitting back as if giving the matter due consideration, “a man who refers to any part of sex simply as a ‘biological imperative’ isn’t going to base things on chance or convenience.  You,” John sits up suddenly and points directly at Sherlock’s chest; he smiles, “you, Sherlock Holmes, would want to make sure that if you have to ‘meet the need’ that you did it as quickly and efficiently as possible, with the best possible results.  No, you wouldn’t choose … that,” John waves towards Sherlock’s bedroom vaguely, “unless it was exactly what you wanted.  You would choose that
John’s not exactly brusque when he pulls his hand away but he doesn’t go out of his way to avoid waking Sherlock as he sits up in bed and rests his back against the headboard.  The detective responds immediately, his arm slithering back beneath his body as his limbs flex and stretch, and his eyes flicker open and unerringly glance up to catch John’s gaze.  For the span of a breath, Sherlock’s expression is devastating, languid and soft and (oh God) sensual as he regards John above him in bed, but in a moment, the quicksilver eyes narrow just a bit (probably immediately cataloguing the difference in the light or something) and then his face reflects something John is more used to seeing, an expression that is content but somehow … careful.
“Of course it matters.”  John’s voice stays quiet but that earnest firmness that is so quintessentially
“Okay.  Well, just make sure that you’re communicating with your boyfriend about this, okay?  If he was a bit too rough, you’ll want to make sure that you tell him so that you two can avoid going too far next time.  I’m sure he wouldn’t want to hurt you and it’ll be a much better experience for both of you in the long run.”
o	June(ish) - events of Six Thatchers: Mary on the run for several weeks before Sherlock catches up with her
Sherlock straightens and pulls at his cuffs, clearly pleased with himself.  “Well, predominantly capoeira and—”
Sherlock fetches it and returns swiftly, handing the medicine over to John and watching like a hawk as John doses her and brushes the wisps of hair away from her face.  Another few minutes go by as he waits for the medicine to take effect; when he angles her neck to take another look, he lets out a gruff curse.
Sherlock can’t help but grin.  “Certainly not with Mycroft.”  John chortles in a rough whisper of voice.  “And if there were any moments like that with Eurus, I was either too small to remember or I’ve blocked them out completely.”
Sherlock still stares flatly at his laptop screen by the time John makes it into the sitting room.  He flicks a gaze to where John stands with his hand on the back of his armchair, a questioning look on his face.  When Sherlock doesn’t answer, just gapes at John silently, the doctor’s expression goes from relaxed and inquisitive to focused concern in a heartbeat.
John flicks his eyes up and catches Sherlock’s gaze.  The detective has the trace of a smile on his face when he looks up from where Rosie now pokes her head between his knees, buzzing ostentatiously, and the expression freezes a bit when he links eyes with John.  He’s still bent almost horizontal, peering  at where Sherlock has bowed his knees out around Rosie’s mischievous little face, and John lets his grip on his towel slacken just enough that he can feel it slide down to the top curve of his arse.  Sherlock’s cheeks redden as he scans John’s face and even though John tips his gaze back to his daughter, he can feel the heat of Sherlock’s gaze as it slides down John’s damp back and over the curve of his bum.  He smirks just a little when he hears a distinct throat clearing above his head but decides to put Sherlock out of his momentary misery.
“I’m very confused, love.  You see, Daddy loves you very much and he,” John stumbles, but his daughter barely manages three words at a time so what harm can it do to say it, “loves Sherlock very much.  But Daddy isn’t sure if Sherlock loves him back.  Probably not.  Although….”
Sherlock admittedly may be an arrogant arse but he really doesn’t think he deserves this sort of torture.  Then again, the thought is insanely irritating when he recalls that he engineered this situation on purpose for some reason.  He doesn’t have any masochistic tendencies that he’s aware of, but this predicament may cause him to reevaluate that.  Although, in his own defense, he engineered this situation before he became aggravatingly aware of what John looks like naked.
“Capoeira? Isn’t that the one based on dancing?” John interrupts, secretly gratified at the detective’s miffed expression.  “That explains a fair bit.”
John’s eyes narrow and the blue depths are almost icy in their sharpness.  “I do.  When you’re not up to something.  And the fact that you’re being so agreeable about it right now means you’re definitely up to something, I just haven’t figured out what it is yet.”
“Nope,” John says immediately.  After a deep exhale, John clears his throat and says, “Sorry.  I’m … trying to get better about this.  Ella says—”
John chuckles but doesn’t let the blatant distraction tactic derail him from his point.  “Your parents dote on her already.”
Normally John would have ignored him and carried on with the last few but he’s too upset to focus.  He chucks the dirty needle in the direction of the med kit and stomps out of the lavatory without a second look, resolved to let Sherlock clean up the mess for once.  It takes nearly an hour’s walk around circling nearby streets to clear his head but once he does, John realizes the full measure of what an arse he’d been.  Sherlock scared him and took unnecessary risk, no question, but it doesn’t excuse his reaction to it, especially not when he’d been so determined to change how he deals with his anger after what he did to Sherlock at the hospital last spring.  The worst part about it is that when he returns to Baker Street to apologize with his tail firmly tucked between his legs, Sherlock won’t let him get through it.
He feels his forehead pinch as he scans his Mind Palace quickly for which of the dozens of pieces he’s played that have a Romany bent to them that John would consider “the gypsy one” and lands on a piece he’d played last Midsummer that the doctor had taken a fancy to even though he’d only heard it the once.
“Come on, John,” Sherlock rumbles in a low whisper, grasping the doctor’s arm and tugging.  “High time to get back to the Yard and show them what we’ve found.”
“And you’re not just ‘some poof’.  You’re clearly a bright young man with a boyfriend to be proud of.”
“I won’t be sad anymore, I promise,” Sherlock murmurs to her, letting his face rest against her downy hair.  He idly recalls the smooth strands of John’s grey-gold hair beneath his cheek as John wept into his chest.  Sherlock can’t help the squeeze of his heart, marveling at how thoroughly these Watsons hold him in their thrall.
It’s not so different, really, as far as his normal daily routine is concerned.  In any case, the routine isn’t different;
“Now, if you’ll excuse us,” Lady Smallwood continues with a surprisingly even tone, “I’ve decided to reacquaint your brother with the health benefits of ‘fishing’ and I think it’s been just enough time that we can cast out the line again.  I’ll call tomorrow morning.  Goodnight, Mr. Holmes.”
“I’m here, Sherlock,” he murmurs, gazing down at the riot of curls covering his chest.  “I’m with you.  I’m safe. Just try to get some sleep.”
Does he ever just use his hand on his cock or does he always use a toy?  His fingers?  Something else entirely?  John proceeds to see all these things on a loop … Sherlock as he was on the bed this morning, working a toy in his arse as he strokes himself.  Sherlock dripping wet in the shower and striping the wall with his come.  Sherlock leaning back against the kitchen counter and fisting his cock inside the folds of his dressing gown.  Sherlock splayed over his chair, fucking up into his hand as he impales himself on his fingers.  Sherlock laid out face down on the sofa, arse raised up a bit as he thrusts against the cushions.  It drives John bloody mad all day long.  He then discovers that his subconscious mind is unbelievably cruel and demands attention be paid to just how long it’s been since he’s gotten laid, because when John’s brain exhausts all the possible ways Sherlock could be wanking himself into oblivion while John isn’t there, he starts picturing the two of them shagging in every possible variation John knows of that two men can fuck.  And as it turns out, John is far more knowledgeable than he realized about gay sex.
before you came back to London.  And how long were you in London before you came to crash my dinner at The Landmark?”
“Sorry you have to … I mean, it must be awkward,” Alex rolls his eyes away and they fill a bit.  “Having to patch up the bum of some poof who can’t even control his own—”
He’s trembling in John’s grip so John glances around in a panic, desperate for a distraction.  His eyes land on the violin resting nearby on the desk.
John can’t help but laugh. “She’s doing nothing of the kind.  Sherlock, Rosie calls me ‘Dada’ or ‘Daddy’, not ‘Papa’.  She’s
John,” Sherlock entones, clearly implying that John is a simpleton for not figuring it out.  “She’s mistaking me for you.”
The doctor clears his throat heavily and Sherlock’s eyes snap up to John’s face and then as far away from John’s face as possible.
Sherlock does look at John that time and blushes, maintaining eye contact for only a moment before staring up at the ceiling.  “Gunshot,” he says shortly.
John freezes.  Apparently that last bit is going to be addressed sooner than he thought.  He turns to find Rosie staring up at Sherlock, question on her face, and Sherlock trying desperately to mask the panic on his features.
“No, John.  I think that they may have it … but they got lax towards the end, only one guard on me and it was Mycroft undercover, so I pulled a few timely deductions on the man with the pipe so he would leave me alone.  I suspect that if it had gone on longer, they might have—but no.  They didn’t … they didn’t.”
“Don’t do that thing where you act like you deserve my bad behavior.  Don’t act like you making a mistake justifies me being a complete boorish arse.  It doesn’t.”
“So what did Mycroft want?” John asks before bending to blow a raspberry into Rosie’s belly, smiling at the girl’s shrieks of delight.  “Hopefully something other than just tormenting you with the awareness of his sexual activity?”
Sherlock’s lips quirk up at the edges as he spears another morsel of admittedly very good lamb and holds John’s eyes as he pops it into his mouth.  John scowls at him for a second and then the expression melts away, his eyes crinkling at the edges as he fights a grin and shakes his head.
in the alley after their case the other night.  They have a rather spectacular chase through Clerkenwell with some low rate thugs and end up ducking into an alley with a little alcove just big enough for the two of them to crowd in and escape their pursuers.  He allows himself to be shooed into the tight space and shaded from the outer alley only because Sherlock is a) bloody insistent and b) wearing entirely dark clothing, so less likely to be spotted in their dingy surroundings.  When pressed back into the alcove by the inexorable motion of Sherlock’s body, John gets wedged tightly against a sharp corner without a way to turn his body to align flat to the wall; with nothing else to do with his arms in the limited space, John’s hands drop to Sherlock’s waist.  Too late, he realizes that they end up underneath the folds of Sherlock’s coat, settling onto the smooth fabric of his ungodly expensive shirt.  Some footsteps clack in the outside corridor and Sherlock presses closer, his forearms braced above John’s shoulders on the dirty bricks of the building and the heat of the other man’s body radiating against John all the way down to his knees.  Sherlock cranes his head sideways to listen for the thugs chasing them and John can’t help notice that the position would look, to an objective observer, as if they’d slipped in here for an amorous embrace.  John’s arms are nearly laced around Sherlock’s back now and his fists tighten over the prominent span of the detective’s slim hips.  Their position puts his face right into the base of Sherlock’s throat and suddenly he’s surrounded by the warm aromas of clean sweat drifting up from inside Sherlock’s clothes, posh aftershave above John at his neck, the crispness of the laundry soap John buys and astringent tang of the antiseptic soap Sherlock uses after his experiments.  Christ, how could he have not noticed how overwhelming all of these smells were surrounding his flatmate for years and then suddenly be overpowered by them in such an odd moment?  And why in God’s name is his heart galloping like a bloody racehorse and he can’t seem to control his breathing and he may be panicking a tiny bit at the electric zip down his spine because it’s far too close to that thrill he gets in the first flushes of arousal and—
Sherlock’s heart feels as if it’s trying to escape his ribcage.  “I’ll just,” he gestures to the chair, “let me just….”
have no interest in sex with other people, which implies that right now is the exception.  So there’s … there’s a man you feel that way about right now?”
Sherlock nearly chuckles; he can hear Mycroft shifting the bedsheets up to cover his chest, as if the prim gesture somehow gives him the high ground.
John stays quiet for a moment then asks, “Want to tell me what you were looking for under my shirt?”
Sherlock whirls to face him, his face all astonishment.  If it wasn’t such a serious moment, John would probably laugh at how gobsmacked Sherlock looks.  He flounders wordlessly, his mouth opening and shutting a few times before he narrows his eyes at John and scrutinizes him ruthlessly.  That’s something John didn’t expect; he didn’t think Sherlock wouldn’t believe him.  The man sees through everyone and everything.  John had thought it’d be obvious.
it was, John,” Sherlock scowls as he whirls around in the doorway to the sitting room.  “I should have realized it immediately.  That clerk was far too eager to be accommodating.  Over-confidence, clearly; thought his plan was fool-proof and he’d never be caught.”
but it seems that there are subtle differences in John’s interactions with Sherlock on nearly every level.  They always make so little sense, though, and don’t seem to be indicative of any clear motivating force on John’s part.  When John makes tea now, he makes Sherlock’s first and blows on it a few times before handing over the mug but still drinks his own without waiting and scalds his tongue.  He leaves Rosie with Sherlock for much longer periods of time while he’s at the clinic where he used to ask someone else to help mind her for shifts longer than three hours.  More than once, Sherlock finishes a piece on his violin to find John watching him with a gaze that is both intense and strangely tender.  In general, John watches Sherlock far more often, usually when he believes Sherlock won’t notice and looking away the instant he is caught; regardless of that fact, however, their direct eye contact has increased in frequency (up 32% from before he moved back in) and in sustained duration (increased from an average of 3.4 seconds per gaze to 6.3 seconds).
Alex just nods and looks away again.  John’s not at all sure why it occurs to him to say the words but out they come.
John wordlessly puts up two fingers on the hand not holding his tea and brings it up for a sip.  Sherlock chuckles roundly at the rude gesture then shakes his head as John immediately winces at the scalding temperature of the drink.
dislocated, John.  Obviously,” Sherlock protests and gestures with his right hand.  The movement is jerky and he tries to hide a wince when the shoulder moves.
“Okay,” John says, mulling it over.  “Then you’ve never had any interest in pursuing something with any of the men you’ve ever been attracted to in the past, when you do feel drawn?”
The loo door muffles John’s voice but there’s something else odd about it.  He wishes he could see John’s face but given the fact that the doctor is most likely naked at the moment, it’s probably a tender mercy that he can’t.
“I can handle myself, Mycroft.  And John.  So I’ll thank you to keep your nose out of it,” he says with as much dignity as he can muster.
“Right,” Sherlock answers, not wanting to point out that John’s bath this morning is exactly why they
He gets out of the bath with little fanfare, hoisting Rosie out and wrapping her up in the little hooded towel Sherlock had bought her a few weeks ago (really, he must stop Sherlock spoiling her so ridiculously).  It had seemed a bit silly at the time, but the little bobbles on top of the hood and “stinger” on the back makes Rosie look like a little bee and it sets John grinning. He tweaks one of the bobbles on her antennae and sets it bouncing, drawing gales of laughter as he buzzes at her.  All of a sudden, John gets an idea … it’s a bit terrible to involve his daughter in his plot and more than a bit manipulative … but he does it anyway.  John gently sets Rosie on the ground, hooded towel gaping around her sturdy little naked body.  She grins up at him, chubby cheeks rosy from the warm humidity of the room.
“Stay,” John says again, leaning up in bed.  His eyes are lamp-like in the darkness but for once, Sherlock can’t read the expression.  “I mean … would you stay?”
Sherlock ponders this and then offers, “If you’ll promise me to stop flogging yourself for having the audacity to be imperfect.”
Rosie giggles in delight as John chases her in a half-circle around the bed to where she is now ‘hiding’ behind Sherlock’s legs as he stands at his dresser; Sherlock blinks confusedly as he twists this way and that, trying to get a look at Rosie as she ducks from one side to the other to avoid the reach of John’s arm.
“It’s all right, love; it’s okay,” John says in his calmest tone, trying not to betray the squeeze of worry in his chest.  “I’m so sorry, darling.  You’re all right.  I’m so sorry—”
“Two full inches, John.”  Sherlock turns to give him an assessing glance without dislodging Rosie or their twined hands.  “Two and a half.”
o	A series of one-shots rather than subsequent chapters on this fic.  The reason why I wanted to do this is because (theoretically) each work COULD stand on its own, though obviously there will be greater meaning when read together.  That being said, because they will not be chronologically continuous - rather, they will be more like self-contained vignettes of the future of John, Sherlock, and Rosie's lives together - it didn't feel right to have them as one unified story.
He starts with Ysayë’s Sonata Number 2 – fitting, given that the prelude’s subtitle is “Obsession” – though ironically, it doesn’t hold his attention; he blends into the Barber 3rd movement, but with his loss of focus, it’s too much, his fingers tangling on the strings.  Growling in frustration yet again, he starts up the Corigliano
decided to push something with Sherlock, he definitely wouldn’t have chosen “naked in the bath with toddler” as his chosen method of seduction.  Especially not for Sherlock.
“You needed something?” Sherlock says between panting breaths.  His hands tremble with the effort to remain still.
Sherlock blithely ignores the scathing censure and scowls down at the gash.  “Honestly, John it’s not really deep enough to require stitches; you could have probably patched it up with medical grade glue and had done with it ten minutes ago.  I got deeper scratches learning to shave.”  He hiccups and winces when John pulls a suture too tight and has to tug at Sherlock’s skin to loosen. It.  “Why are you so upset?”
“She’s recreating whichever style of build you’re less likely to kick over,” John rejoins, amused.  “That hardly makes her the next Norman Foster.”
“Something relatively simple and free of danger so we don’t get hurt, but something out of London.  Preferably far enough away that we won’t be able to return to London until the next day.”
sharing a bed with John and resisting his natural inclination for John’s benefit?  A light snuffling noise comes from Sherlock as he nuzzles his face against the pillow and a movement below the covers catches John’s eye: Sherlock has hedged the majority of his body to the edge of the mattress but his left arm, which should have been tucked under his body, extended straight out across the empty space stretching between them with his fingers bowed outwards towards John.  Lifting the covers as slowly and gingerly as he is able, John notes that Sherlock’s hand is tilted in such a way that, before John had rolled over, the backs of Sherlock’s knuckles would have been pressed right up against John’s shoulder blades …. A coincidence?  Or had Sherlock consciously (unconsciously?) reached out to connect to John?
John nods wordlessly in return so Sherlock picks up his bow.  For the first few long strokes across the strings, Sherlock watches John’s eyes, letting the swirling depths of ocean-blue set the pace of his pulls on his violin.  The unwavering strength of John’s gaze burns at something in his stomach so when the tempo picks up, Sherlock turns away, letting the jaunty rhythm of the piece move his limbs into a lilting dance of instrument and musician and melody.  He coaxes the bouncing cascade of notes out and lets the short, sharp strokes of his bow occupy his thoughts throughout the entire up-tempo section.  He never turns to face John again, even when the middle section drifts up into a legato melody almost like a lullaby, but he can feel the doctor’s gaze on him the entire time, intense and focused and warm.  As the music picks up again, Sherlock finds himself irresistibly pulled by the liveliness of the tune and gives in to the impulse to dance across the sitting room.  Undoubtedly somewhat ridiculous in his motion, Sherlock hears John laugh but the sound caresses rather than jolts.  It’s not a laugh of derision; his doctor laughs in delight and the sound sparkles within his veins.  Sherlock finishes the final notes with a flourish and whirls to face John, his chest heaving with the effort, his cheeks flushed, his mouth turned up, and his pulse a bit erratic from giddiness.
John stands up and pulls Rosie to his shoulder.  “I should go and put her down for the night.  Getting late.”
“As if you become a gypsy right in front of my eyes.  You’ve always been high energy but when you play, you just … come alive in such a different way.  You’re beautiful,” John finishes in a hush.
John slams his eyes shut and frantically tries to gather his scattering thoughts.  Except now, in the wake of this evening and this song, all of his thoughts coalesce into one solid, unshakeable revelation:  Sherlock loves him back.  Without hesitation, without a doubt, John knows this fact as if it is the only thing that he has ever known.  A sudden crushing weight settles onto John’s chest and he’s gasping on nearly every breath.  He’s rocking forward towards Sherlock helplessly as he feels and hears and smells the inescapable presence of the man, overwhelming every sense and knocking the whole planet off its axis.  A light brush of Sherlock’s fingers on either side of John’s jaw has him snapping his eyes open, gazing up into Sherlock’s shifting, liquid eyes and they’re here, dancing on the precipice of the moment he’d thought would never come.
He can’t deny, however, that it did seem to prompt an interesting reaction.  Sherlock had been stunned and embarrassed but there was an unmistakable flicker of interest in those verdigris eyes.  John may be an idiot compared to Sherlock but he knows what it looks like when someone is eyeing him up and John’s pretty damn certain that Sherlock was just north of openly ogling him.  Good, that’s definitely good.  Interest, John can work with.  Perhaps it’s time John conducted an experiment of his own.
“Nothing too bad,” she says as she forages and produces a small tube.  She uses a swab covered in cotton wool to apply a cream to Rosie’s neck and then bandages it, making a soft whooshing sound every time the girl whimpers.  She turns her head just slightly to address Sherlock and John as she works.  “You’re a doctor then, John, so I don’t have to spell it all out?”
“Sorry,” John mutters quickly, pressing Rosie closer to his chest, angling her red, blotchy face towards his neck and away from Sherlock.  “Sorry if she woke you – or, I dunno, interrupted you if you haven’t gone to bed yet.”
“I haven’t timed you, John; I pay attention.  Subtle difference.”  Sherlock moves to the desk where he lays out his bag and fishes for his pajamas inside its depths.  “Besides,” he continues as John begins to bang around getting his bath started, “given that I delete things that you consider fundamental knowledge such as the current members of the monarchy or the structure of the solar system, I’d think you’d be flattered that I pay attention to your bathing habits and how you take your tea and consider them of significant importance to occupy space in my Mind Palace.”
“Dada!” Rosie murmurs into his cheek.  The little girl shifts beneath him so he moves to the side, peering into the small face which wrinkles in concentration.  Eventually, she reaches out and pats his cheek with a small, bemittened hand.  “Dada, no sad.”
“No!” John says hoarsely.  He looks away for a moment then gazes back to Sherlock.  “No.  Please … please stay.”
“I’m safe, too,” he assures his friend.  “It’s all right now.  You’re awake and you’re here with me and we’re both safe—”
John absorbs that for a moment.  “Do you love her, Sherlock?”  When Sherlock turns back and stares at him, stricken, John angles Rosie towards him to emphasize the question. “You love her?”
“As you said, John, this is a five at most and yet, I can’t solve it!  If you didn’t insist on conditioning me to eat and sleep at regular intervals, I would have sharper focus and—”
“Obviously,” Sherlock confirms.  He sighs heavily and then spreads his hands.  “Contrary to what most people would think ….” He finds he has to stop to clear his throat.  “I may not careen after sexual encounters the way most people do, but I am human, John.”
When the last patient of the day tells him what’s wrong, John barely resists the impulse to shout and climb out of his own skin.  A sandy-haired boy of no more than twenty or so blushes and refuses to sit when John greets him.  He drops his eyes to the floor and explains in a hushed voice that he’s too embarrassed to his normal GP on account of the nature of his ailment.  After a few moments of stammering, John finally pries it out of him with a bit of gentle prodding:  his boyfriend had been a bit rougher than he’s used to during sex the previous night and he’d been very sore and stinging this morning.  John swears under his breath.
When John’s voice comes, it’s achingly soft.  “Why didn’t you just say so?  I mean, all that time ago… in Angelo’s, even, that first night.  You could have said.  I wouldn’t have minded one way or the other.  Why didn’t you just say?”
He supposes that it’s the ‘please’ that induces Sherlock to answer.  “You were a soldier, John; a doctor-soldier.  Surely you recognize the signs.”  The flatness of the tone pushes John that much closer to vomiting.
“Hello, Miss Rosamund, I’m Katie,” she says and offers Rosie her hand.  To the amusement of all the adults, Rosie removes her soggy fist from her mouth and clasps the doctor’s forefinger in an unmistakable shaking gesture.  “Polite little one you have there,” the doctor says to John and then turns a sympathetic face back to Rosie.  “I hear you’ve had a rough night, haven’t you?  Could one of you give me a rundown on what happened?”
Sherlock gives a mirthless chuckle.  “You’ve met me, John; how many men do you believe returned my interest?”
o	As much adherence to canon as I can manage.  Since this is post-season 4, I can do whatever the hell I want AFTER the events of The Final Problem, but I personally like to write as close to canon as I can (just a personal preference) so there will be no "pretend TFP/TLD/whatever never happened" here.  Hope that doesn't put anyone off.
When John’s thumbs skim down the center seam of Sherlock’s trousers, over his arse, Sherlock’s head snaps forward again and he stares blankly at the fireplace.
It only takes a moment for Sherlock to make the connection and quite frankly, he feels like a fool for not making it sooner.  He turns his head towards John.  “It’s the anniversary today, isn’t it?”
Sherlock gently lays the bow across the stand and packs his violin away in the case left open on the desk.  John rises from his chair and shuffles about behind him – looking for some reason to stay in the room? – but Sherlock doesn’t turn.  Eventually, John sighs and heads towards the stairs.  The doctor pauses at the doorframe.
“I—” Sherlock begins but then takes a few rhythmic breaths.  John’s hands tighten on his arms and Sherlock leans into them.  “Serbia.  Moriarty’s network, the last big piece of it, was in Serbia.”
John starts, then nods.  Sherlock can hear him clambering back under the duvet as Sherlock deposits Rosie back onto her cot.  Nearly out the door, Sherlock almost believes he hallucinated the sound of John’s voice when he speaks again.
That last bit will have to wait, John knows, before he can get back round to it.  Letting his eyes flutter shut for a moment, John swallows around the tightness creeping from his chest up into his throat.  He clears it conspicuously before he can continue.
Sherlock regards John for a moment.  He doesn’t look any different (of course he wouldn’t, his brain reminds him, he
They lock eyes for a moment and then burst into giggles.  Rosie seems determined not to be left out, as she begins clapping her hands and laughing along with them.  John jogs over to scoop her up from the couch and return to his chair, depositing the girl in his lap.  Sherlock watches John run a few light fingertips over her belly, smiling as the girl squirms and giggles in response to the tickling.  The doctor looks up to Sherlock, his indigo eyes merry, and he looks so … so
o	August(ish) - events of His Last Vow: Sherlock shot; confrontation at Leinster Gardens; John and Mary 'separate'
In his room, obvious; John’s already seen proof of that.  And really, that would be the most obvious choice for most people.  The shower, maybe?  That’s another logical choice; usually that’s what John does, for ease of clean up and convenient background noise, especially now that he shares a room with his two-year-old daughter.  Sherlock usually precedes John into the bath in the mornings now … has John ever stepped in under the stream of water and touched his own cock just after Sherlock had been in there doing the same thing?  Something about the thought of that, the possibility that they may have come in the same place just minutes apart makes John’s limbs feel watery.
Sherlock snaps his gaze up to John but now he won’t meet Sherlock’s eyes.  “What do you mean by that?”
Sherlock stays silent as a stone as Mary presses fingers to her lips and blows him a kiss.  The video cuts to black and ejects itself from the CD tray.  Sherlock doesn’t move.  The flat is dim by the time he does, when he hears the creak of the downstairs door opening and closing and John’s heavy tread on the stairs.  He hasn’t even bothered to stash the disc somewhere John won’t see it yet – can’t seem to move; why can’t he move? – but he tossed the packaging in the grate as soon as he removed it, so at least that evidence has been consumed by the licking flames that really aren’t necessary at this time of year.
Without waiting for a response, John wrenches the handles of Rosie’s pushchair out of Sherlock’s grip and starts off towards home.  The entirety of the relatively short walk, he berates himself for acting like a stroppy teenager but just the reminder that Sherlock’s been communicating with
“God help her,” Sherlock quips, tossing John a smirk over his shoulder.  “Imagine what he’ll be like to the young men or women she wants to date.”  He affects a face that is an unfortunately accurate depiction of his brother’s tipped-nose sneer and quotes,
Sherlock gives a thick smirk before he leans over Rosie and whispers, “You make a marvelous bumblebee.  They’re my favorite living thing, you know.”
The little girl puckers her lips and giggles when John kisses her with a resounding smack.  John puts a hand on Sherlock’s chest but before he can ask the obvious next question, Rosie raises a hand and pats her fat palms against the detective’s lips.
“You,” John says at once.  He moves across the room and settles in his armchair, scouring Sherlock’s face as the man stands in front of him. “Play me something of yours.  I want to hear you play you.”
“That’s fairly unhelpful,” John mutters with a lopsided grin.  “But not entirely surprising if she and Mycroft were in the middle of shag—”
“Mummy’d lost hope of grandchildren.  Rosie is the nearest she’ll get and no doubt she’ll smother her with affection,” the detective chortles.
Eight and a half minutes later, John still hasn’t come up with a way of getting dressed for bed without looking like a prat or getting naked in front of Sherlock so he decides to just brazen it out and hope for the best.  He towels off swiftly as the tub drains, shuffling the terrycloth over his hair to remove any errant drops, and stands in front of the mirror for a few moments, pondering.  Deciding against anything that would scream that he’s attempting to impress someone – Sherlock would sniff it out in a second – he just gives himself an honest, hard once-over.  He isn’t bad looking, really; he’s pulled plenty of women over the years despite being more than averagely short and sort of plain as far as his face is concerned.  He turns said face back and forth in front of the glass, deciding that it’s not such a bad face.  It’s a face that’s actually improved over time even with his hair mostly grey and his eyes tired from grief and raising a toddler.  The only ‘ugly’ thing on him is the scar, and even that doesn’t really bother him all that much anymore.  All right, he isn’t posh and handsome like Sherlock but John firmly tells himself he’s got nothing to be ashamed of, so he wraps the towel around his waist and heads out to the bedroom.
“Sorry,” John says with a self-depreciating grin.  “Didn’t think you’d just invite yourself in.  Stupid of me, all things considered.”
“Come on, you rude wanker.  Only polite to show up when we say we will so the poor woman can go to bed.”
Rosie pats his cheek again and John turns her to face him completely.  With his daughter straddling his knee, gazing up into his face with a mixture of trust and concern, his life feels far simpler than it did a half hour ago inside Baker Street.
“It soaked through my trousers and my pants,” he says ruefully.  “My groin was a very festive shade of lavender.”
John reddens as he leans on the doorframe of the bathroom.  “You realize that it’s creepy that you’ve timed how long it takes me to have a bath?”
His flatmate straightens in his armchair, his eyes flicking up to catch Sherlock’s from his former gaze down at his hands clasped between his knees.
Sherlock makes a show of gazing at his watch and then back at John.  “Two hours and eleven minutes since you walked in the door and fifty-three minutes after dinner.  I must admit, your restraint really has improved dramatically.  That’s thirty-seven minutes longer than I expected, so well done, John.”
“Not the teasing, you git,” John says, a tiny smile fading away as he continues.  “This.”  He waves his hand around vaguely to indicate the boxes.  “I know that we’ve rebuilt the flat to the way it was and you said it’s fine until we get on our feet but—”
Sherlock’s eyes narrow to slits.  “I’m also exceedingly well-versed in Aikido and Judo, if you must know.  And baritsu, but that’s more an offshoot of my fencing training.”
“Hmmm?” Sherlock asks, feigning absorption in the computer files he’s sifting through.  “John, have a look at those ledgers, would you?  There’s no way that a building of that size and age would have no record of things like taxes or fees or utility bills at the very least, so—”
Sherlock turns just his head and regards the doctor with a furrowed brow.  “You’ve never shown concern about the way we tease each other before; why start now?”
The page is covered in definitions, clearly all explanations of terms regarding sex, sexuality, or gender identity.  Sandwiched in between “cross dresser” and “drag queen” lies an entry that John has circled twice in pencil.
If you're new to this story, sorry to disappoint: it's not a second chapter, it's a plan for the future based on the response from the previous chapter's question on whether this should be a series or not.  Once I mentioned it, I couldn't get the plot bunny(ies) out of my head so I am embarking on a series to tell my interpretation of the post-series 4 "Baker Street Boys".  If you liked this story and - as many of you said in your comments on chapter 1 - want to see more of the "flashes" that I mentioned in my previous chapter's A/N, here's what you can expect:
And they’re off again, running across London as John tries desperately to shake that feeling, whatever the hell it is, out of his chest.
John’s grin widens.  “You have cold hands,” he says simply.  John can’t really pinpoint precisely why he finds this funny but it makes him laugh, a low chuckle that teases an answering rumble from the man next to him.
Sherlock nods, eyes wide, and then mumbles, “Of course.  Well … goodnight, John,” in an unsteady voice.
To say that John is disappointed in the days following his epiphany would be a vast understatement.  Well, of course he’s relieved that Rosie recuperates from the scalding almost immediately (faster than John recovers from the guilt) with only a tiny little fleck of a scar just at the base of her neck, and that only because John can’t keep her fingers off the scab once the blister had started to heal.  Sherlock, on the other hand … John can’t help but be disappointed.  He tries to keep it close to the chest but the fact that Sherlock acts no differently in the days following the A&E trip is as baffling as it is frustrating.  From the well of supportive calm to the gentle clasp of his hand in John’s, Sherlock had given the impression that even if he wasn’t overflowing with ardent affection, at least maybe John wasn’t barmy or alone in his feelings.  Maybe there’d been something to it all these years when people saw them as a couple.  Although the detective hasn’t suddenly reverted to the age-old gruff dismissal of sentiment the way he used to, things settle back into a place where John sometimes feels as if he imagined the whole evening.  Only the tiny mark on Rosie’s neck and the ghost-like memory of cool digits wrapped around his own makes him think it wasn’t some kind of hallucination.  So John spends the next week doing the only thing he can think of: putting his head down and soldiering on.
“I feel … pulled, sometimes.  To the person first.  Minds.  Hearts, if that’s what you want to call it.  I don’t … if I feel drawn to the
For a moment, John’s chest warms a bit at the idea of Sherlock putting that much care into John’s appearance.  Until, of course, he continues speaking.
John strides over purposefully, hands raised towards his friend’s shoulder, but Sherlock darts away so quickly that John might have even called it a scramble.  His eyes narrow at the detective.  “What are you hiding?”
expression but this time it’s paired with a tiny, fond smile and a loose shrug.  “I thought that there’d be a much smaller likelihood of a Child Protection referral on a high-strung long-time bachelor anxious to impress his new live-in boyfriend than a doctor who should have known better and was careless with his tea around his young daughter.”
John can feel Sherlock’s body heat warming his back and the bed is narrow enough that there’s only an inch or so between them beneath the covers.  Sherlock stays ramrod straight behind him and his posture doesn’t ease on the bed until long after John slides into the welcoming dark of sleep.
“Well then, if you don’t mind ….” Sherlock answers as if he’s been interrupted shaving or combing his hair or something else equally innocuous.
He doesn’t try to picture it (the boy is half his age after all) but the image slips into his head unbidden.  Almost immediately, the mental picture becomes John and Sherlock.  Suddenly he’s coming up behind Sherlock, pushing him down to all fours, thrusting into him with little warning and roughly fucking him until—
A deep chuckle rumbles the floorboards above him and John can’t help but return Sherlock’s mischievous grin when he thunders back down the stairs leading to John’s bedroom.
– though what it indicates, he has no idea, given how unconnected the markers are – and yet, there are several other factors that seem equally undesirable and worryingly non-specific.   Despite never batting an eye at it for the entirety of their previous tenure as flatmates, John startles and averts his eyes when Sherlock walks about in his dressing gown after a bath.  He’s surly for days after The Woman texts Sherlock about a blog post on a recent case.  John practically yells the flat ceiling down while stitching up a gash in Sherlock’s side after a confrontation with a suspect then berates himself in an apology not an hour later.  And then once, during a particularly athletic chase through Islington after a drug trafficker, Sherlock herds John into the darkened corner of an alley lest they be caught by the thugs in hot pursuit of them and the evidence they pinched.  Spying an alcove that is protected and defensible but gives a sightline to the outer alley, Sherlock corrals John into the corner with his body, keeping his ears trained to the outer alley for signs of their pursuers.  In the tense minutes that follow, he feels John’s breaths puff against his chest in increasingly erratic patterns as they wait until Sherlock is confident that they managed to shake off their shadows and can proceed safely back to the Yard.  John remains stiff and uncommunicative for at least an hour afterwards at the Yard – to the point where even Donovan notices and comments on it – and then when they return to Baker Street, he barely speaks three words to Sherlock before pleading fatigue and heading upstairs.  Except that Sherlock can hear John’s restless pacing the perimeter of his room for nearly half an hour.  Sherlock frowns and gazes up the stairs for several minutes, pondering the matter; eventually he admits defeat and gives it up as a bad job, heading back to his laptop in the sitting room.

that Sherlock has to actually clench his hands around the arms of his chair to resist the impulse to stalk over and taste the grin on John’s face.
The hitch in John’s voice as he finishes is minute but Sherlock catches it, and so he has to clench his eyes shut and croak around a tightness in his throat.  “You’re welcome, John.  Of course.”
“Oh, for—” John grouses, catching the blooming smirk on Sherlock’s face.  “I suppose if I were built like a damn giraffe and had unlimited resources—”
John stares at him until Sherlock feels like he wants to crawl out of his skin.  It’s the same feeling that he used to get when he was gasping for another fix.
John shrugs, not the least bit self-conscious apparently.  “Both, I guess.  You’ve just never given any indication of
“Oh, what does that matter?” John protests and then drops his voice to a near whisper when Rosie stirs.  “Isn’t that what Mary said?  It doesn’t matter what we really are; she knew what we
“Necessary,” Sherlock confirms, “given that Rosie has been toddling or walking outright with regularity for the last several weeks. I’ve decided that—”
“Oh, I know!” Dr. Simon croons to her as she sets the girl up on the exam table.  “It’s so awful to be poked and prodded by a stranger when you’re sleepy and hurting, but I’ll be quick, I promise.”
John chuffs a laugh but snatches the little pink raincoat from the hook outside the door without further comment and stuffs it into the pocket of the pushchair.  Once he shrugs on his own jacket, John casts his eyes back to Sherlock, still curled in his chair, and seems to want to say something.   In the end, he just gives Sherlock an unreadable look and a nod before assuring the detective that he’ll be home before dark.
“Okay,” John says and clears his throat again.  “You know, I think I’ll have a bath before turning in.  It’s been a long day, might help me sleep.”
She brightens again and pushes her curtain of hair behind one ear, casting a glance down at the paperwork as she flushes under John’s gaze.  Sherlock barely resists the urge to roll his eyes.
Sherlock reaches back and points to the general direction of the irregular splotches – “acid” – and then the circular ones – “cigarette.”  He delivers the remarks so blandly that John feels light-headed.
Sherlock whirls to give him a slant-eyed glare but stops when he sees a flush climb from beneath the collar of John’s shirt up to his cheeks.
And yet, with all of the years of denying the unusual strength of their connection, perhaps—no, surely Sherlock is just seeing what he
John hums, perhaps just to show he’s listening.  Several moments of silence go by with both men still staring at the ceiling.  Eventually John speaks again.
Sherlock confirms with certainty.  “You’re practically panting.  We both know it isn’t exercise like last time, you’ve gained three pounds since August—”
And then one day in early autumn, John stands at the kitchen peeling and sectioning an orange onto a small plastic plate decorated with unicorns when he realizes he’s already done one for his daughter, who happily munches away in her high chair as juice drips down her face.  He knows, though, without even stopping to consider, that he’s made this one for Sherlock.  The man barely eats on the best of days, despite his healthier attitude regarding sleep, and somewhere along the line, John realizes that he’s started making a snack for Sherlock whenever he makes one for Rosie to ensure that his friend gets enough calories.  The last time they lived together, John would berate Sherlock about food until they both got frustrated, then he would give up, tell Sherlock to go to the devil, and eventually coax him into eating something when the man got too hungry to function properly.  Now, when John gives Rosie a hard-boiled egg for protein, he automatically shells another and leaves the neatly quartered pieces on a plate near his laptop where Sherlock is sure to see it and eat without thinking; he hangs a banana from Sherlock’s music stand; he fills an extra small bowl with apple slices that he knows Sherlock will eat as Rosie teethes away at them, using the fruit pieces to explain the germination process to her; or he spreads marmalade on chunks of muffin (Sherlock hates the seeds in John’s preferred blackberry jam), splitting them evenly between his daughter’s plate and a bowl he leaves on the arm of Sherlock’s chair.  John’s fairly certain that this little trail of snacks that he leaves for Sherlock have become the detective’s main source of caloric intake, and John can’t accurately point a finger at when he started this behavior, only knowing that it started after the night they shared a bed.  John is wholly unsure of what to make of this phenomenon.
“—see but don’t observe; yeah, I’ve heard,” the doctor finishes with an eye roll.  “All right, all right, so you’ve studied what, exactly?”
go read the story of them getting together and have fluffy happiness.  And you totally should.  Not just because you probably need some fluff right about now but because I'm already writing the next installment, which will be a DIRECT follow-up to FTMOB so you might want to refresh your memory before that happens.
John scoffs as he stands in the doorway from the kitchen, blowing gently across the surface of the tea he’s just poured for Sherlock as the steam billows up in fragrant curls.  The freshly boiled water in his own mug stands steeping on the counter but Sherlock always takes sugar in his so John starts his first to give it plenty of time to dissolve.  The detective reaches out a long arm for the mug which John hands over with a chuckle.
The grin that Sherlock aims at John is full of mischief so John puts his nose in the air.  “Until you and your brother’s unlimited gold card decide to fund a new wardrobe for me, I guess you’ll just have to put up with the assault on your fashion sensibilities.  And I happen to like that jumper, you prat.”
“John, perhaps you should let me—” he begins, stepping towards the bed with his arms outstretched again.
He can almost hear Sherlock’s lips turn up at the corners.  “Your confidence in my skills is bracing, John, but perhaps a bit unrealistic.”
to see him naked.  Doesn’t matter though because by the time John has pulled the t-shirt down over his head and turned back towards the bed, Sherlock is shuffling down underneath the covers.
John gapes at him, well familiar with this voice: it’s the one he uses when he either wants to coax a power-drunk suspect into thinking he’s weak or a hysterical victim into sympathizing and divulging key facts.  What he can’t figure out is why Sherlock is pretending that he was the one to douse Rosie on accident.
The young man perches at the edge of the seat looking like he wants to melt into the floor.  The boy’s light blue eyes dart from John’s hands folded on his knee to the framed picture of Mary and Rosie that he keeps on his desk.  It takes until the third or fourth glance at his hands for John to realize that Alex is staring at his wedding ring – which, in all honestly, John had forgotten was still on his finger nearly a year and a half after Mary’s death.  Alex bounces between John’s ring and the sunny picture of wife and child.  Ah.  John had planned another little talk about empowerment and control of one’s sexual destiny but something completely different tumbles out of his mouth.
“Get me the liquid paracetamol from the bathroom cupboard, would you?” John says to Sherlock, trying to keep his voice steady.
Another laugh bubbles up from John’s belly.  “Yeah, shame that he’s well aware of it.  And a proper genius, too.  Most brilliant, amazing man I’ve ever met.  No shame in being proud of that, right?”
be sharing a bed.  “Of course.  I’ll just ….”  He gestures weakly with his bag.  “… Get ready for bed.”
“—looked like curtains my grandmother would buy at Oxfam,” Sherlock retorts.  “For God’s sake, John, at lease press your nose up against the window of Burberry, would you?  It’s the least you could do if you’re going to be seen with me.  The
John insists.  “You are and you will be, especially from Rosie’s perspective.  Look,” John tries using his Sensible Doctor Voice, hoping to penetrate, “Rosie will grow up without her mother.  And that is sad.  Breaks my heart.”
Sherlock tries to crane his neck sideways to look at John, who ducks his face behind the blade of Sherlock’s shoulder.  “Another few inches.  Why?”
“Sorry,” John mutters once Sherlock settles Rosie against his chest.  “Sorry, I just—still a bit … rattled.”
It’s an avoidance tactic, he knows.  Self-preservation.  Sherlock can’t bring himself to say it all, so he’s asking John to do it for him.  John understands, so he obliges.  Sherlock was right: John was a soldier and a doctor in a brutal place; he knows what he’s looking at, for the most part.
Stepping just a foot or two into the room, Sherlock murmurs, “John?” in the gentlest whisper he can manage.
Sherlock shrugs insouciantly but even John will see the tightness in the gesture.  “I suppose it was inevitable.”
“That man didn’t have a best friend with a small daughter who depends on the two of us for her livelihood,” the detective responds quietly.
Sherlock can't stop staring; his whole body's been petrified where he stands.  “Yes, that would have been … more accurate.”
Sherlock regards him with a raised eyebrow.  John rocks Rosie in his arms as she sniffles and sucks her thumb.  He leans towards Sherlock, hoping that his comments won’t be overhead when the detective leans in as well.
“I know, love, I know,” John answers, reaching out around Sherlock’s hip to touch his fingertips to Rosie’s outstretched palm.  “I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I made you ouchie.”
“Completely ridiculous that I didn’t see it before, John.  Absolutely insane.  Should have been obvious from the moment we walked in the door—”
Sherlock stares back flatly.  “Are you suggesting that only gay men enjoy the sensation of penetration?  Aside from being factually unsupportable – statistically speaking, more heterosexuals engage in anal sex than homosexual men—”
After a moment, his hand slides out of Sherlock’s grip as he turns back onto his left side, settling in for sleep.  Sherlock stares upwards into the weak orange glow from outside for as long as he can, his mind struggling to unpack everything that has happened in the last few minutes.  The weight of every minute that escapes him settles heavily on his chest as he clenches and unclenches his fist, trying to hold onto the rapidly dissipating warmth from John’s fingers.
“Oh, grow up, Sherlock, for God’s sake,” his brother snaps and switches the phone to his other ear.  “You were calling because you need a favor, which is a far more amusing topic for me.  Let’s get back to that.”
A/N - So yes, demisexuality; this is my Sherlock.  I think there's a lot of evidence to support it, especially with season four's projecting Sherlock as a highly emotional person who CHOSE to be restrained with his emotions.  It fit, to me, although I acknowledge and enjoy many different depictions of his sexuality.
“Buggering fuck,” John mutters as his cock starts to fill hopefully.  “Listen, you,” he points at the traitorous appendage, “you damn well better behave yourself tonight.  This mess is awkward enough as it is without untimely erections.”
John nearly shouts.  His voice breaks at the end and he clutches at the other man’s biceps – to steady himself?  To steady Sherlock?  God, who knows – before he can speak again.  “Sherlock.  I can’t – tell me what I’m seeing.  Please.”
“Come here, little bee,” John chortles and snakes his hand through Sherlock’s legs to curl around Rosie.  He brushes Sherlock’s calf with his arm just lightly enough that it seems like an accident as he pulls Rosie to him and lifts her up against his chest.
John studies the sharp planes of Sherlock’s face as his friend offers him a hand up from the sofa.  A long moment passes before John moves as Sherlock stands there, hand out, and something achingly vulnerable passes over the angular features that makes John’s chest feel tight.  He reaches out, clasps Sherlock’s wrist, and allows him to haul John up to his feet.
Given that Sherlock had said that Lady Smallwood would call with the details, Sherlock feels his stomach drop away with the obvious realization that John is attempting to get rid of him for the few hours before they will be going away together.  Sherlock’s chest tightens and he wills himself not to react visibly.
The detective pulls himself up to his full height and glares down his nose at John.  “Nonsense that allows me to ‘bound around like a bloody gazelle’, unlike someone who was formally trained by the military, I might add.  Well, that and the fact that I’m three years younger than you.  Perhaps you’re just succumbing to middle age, John.”
“Please tell me that you didn’t blackmail the poor soul into your bed, Mycroft.  That’s beneath you.  And if that poor person has been beneath you, no amount of money would be enough.”
Oh.  That's obviously the wrong thing to say because several emotions chase across John’s face in the silence that follows.  Sherlock puzzles at them, though, because in between the amusement and the rush of embarrassment, there is definitely fear and … disappointment?  Baffling.
John doesn’t let himself reconsider his actions, he simply acts: he threads his arm beneath Sherlock’s back and pulls, rolling the taller man onto his side and cradling him into the pocket of his shoulder.  Sherlock stays stiff against him as John lifts a hand and palms Sherlock’s face but the detective doesn’t resist when John gently guides the other man down against his chest.  Shifting a bit to get the best angle, John shimmies until Sherlock’s cheek lays directly atop his sternum.  He knows that the heartbeat under his friend’s ear is nearly audible in the still room.
Sherlock sighs heavily and sits back in his chair.  “I really am sorry, John.  I should have considered that seeing me wounded would be … unsettling to you, so close to the anniversary of what happened to Mary.”
“Not entirely.”  The detective stares forward at the wall for a moment then regards John.  “You seemed to need it.”
The doctor leaves his chair then and, to Sherlock’s surprise, kneels in front of the leather armchair to place his hands on Sherlock’s where they clutch at his knees.  Sherlock can feel how wide and panicked his eyes are, how tightly he grips his shins, how stiff his shoulders, but John’s palms are warm, heavy, comforting on the backs of his hands, his thumbs gently circling as he speaks in a hushed tone.
“She’s the only one who has ever helped,” John answers.  “She—I didn’t give her enough credit at the outset, but she has been helpful lately.  We’re—” John stumbles, hums a bit, trying to regroup, “we’re trying to work on my anger issues.  Guilt and anger and … well, I call it ‘emotional constipation’ though I’m sure that’s not the technical term she’s used.”
Above his fingers, Sherlock watches John slowly lean forward and prop his elbows on his knees.  His gaze rakes over Sherlock’s face and it feels tender, even if Sherlock can’t quite meet his eyes.
His stomach flips over and John realizes that perhaps he doesn’t give his daughter anywhere near enough credit for her development.  “You want me to … kiss Sherlock?”
Sudden silence from the loo except for a lap of water against the sides of the tub.  Oh.  Probably a Bit Not Good to admit that.  Damn, he really is off his usual focus today.
“And as for … all this?” Sherlock jerks his chin towards the flat.  “John, you’re my best friend; Rosie is my god-daughter.  Even if there were nothing more to it than that, even if we hadn’t endured everything we’ve been through together … wouldn’t that be reason enough?”
.  And yet, John is shuffling over to the far side of the bed, pushing the sheet down just enough to possibly be an invitation but not so obvious as to cause embarrassment if Sherlock refuses.
a bit, gingerly tilting Rosie’s neck this way and that, and then straightens to rummage in a drawer of the cabinet nearby.
Phew .... that was a lot of information.  Okay, if you're still with me (and I hope that you are), please subscribe to the series and keep your eyes out for more.
“He—you must understand, John,” Sherlock says in a rush, “sometimes we wouldn’t be able to communicate for days or weeks at a time because I was constantly moving and it wasn’t safe.  It took him three weeks to become aware of my situation, a week to actually find me, and another four to wade in far enough to even get close to me.”
He turns at the sound of her voice and is surprised to see her regarding him with a kind but concerned expression.
“You woke her?  On purpose?” Sherlock may still be a bit groggy from sleep (little wonder; it’s the first sleep he’s had in 72 hours), but he finds it unlikely that John would intentionally deprive his daughter of rest.
“How is it,” John grouses as he sets the carton down in the sitting room, “that after seven years, at least three near-death experiences, two near misses with drug overdoses, a heart-related gunshot injury, and double kidney failure, you can still bound around like a bloody gazelle without showing any signs of tiring?  Especially seeing as how when you’re not in the act of chasing suspects, you lie about on the sofa for days on end, only getting up to play the damn violin?!”
Sherlock settles in the rocker and lays Rosie on her stomach against his chest, one arm under her bottom; the little girl wriggles a bit until her warm face presses against Sherlock’s neck.  John leans forward, dropping his face into his upturned palms and scrubbing his fingers across his closed eyes.  Sherlock clenches his own shut against the weak light from the street lamp just outside John’s window and lets himself savor this quiet moment – his god-daughter’s moist breath puffing against his throat as her sobs ebb away, the clutch of her tiny fingers against the collar of his t-shirt, another fist twining around one of the curls at the nape of his neck.  Sherlock allows himself this one indulgence, here in the dark where even John won’t see.
With Sherlock wriggling into place beneath the covers next to him, John can’t help but feel that this is so ... oddly domestic.  He drops his mobile on the nightstand next to his side just next to where he’d dropped his wallet earlier and turns back to Sherlock. He leans in without thinking, as if he were going to kiss Sherlock goodnight; only a few inches away from Sherlock’s face, he realizes himself and goes rigid.  John shuffles away and stares, red-faced, towards the foot of the bed.
Sherlock pulls up John’s travel alarm clock and shows him the little blinking display – 1:03 am.  John actually laughs.
His fingers compress around the bag of powder.  “I’m at home … but I don’t need to leave the house to start on the list.”
“I’ll just … do you mind watching her while I…?” John flaps his now-free right arm towards the loo and then upwards in the vague direction of his bedroom.
Sherlock’s voice pitches low and soft and John feels the gentle but insistent pressure of Sherlock’s hand at his shoulder.  He resists looking up at the detective but Sherlock slides his hand down from the shoulder to grip John’s elbow, grasping him firmly enough to telegraph his intention.  John lets himself be pulled away from the sink and steered to a kitchen chair.
John finds himself at a loss to respond so he just nods and turns to go.  A cab stands just outside the front entrance with its side door open, Sherlock already crowded to the far side with his face buried in his phone.  John ducks inside, careful not to jostle Rosie too much as he sits.  At least five solid minutes go by in silence as London whips by them.  Despite the detective’s front of complete absorption in his phone, John sees that Sherlock’s eyes haven’t changed focus since John sat down.
Or, rather, you’ve just finished having sex,” Sherlock amends and then pulls a face.  “Good Lord, I think I’m going to be sick.”
Sherlock shrugs again.  “Perhaps I chose it because it was convenient.  Perhaps I chose it at random.  Perhaps it was simply on sale that day.”
A/N - sorry for the fake-out everyone ... this isn't a new chapter, it's a plan for the future.  ....
John beams at him and actually applauds.  “Absolutely brilliant.  Loved that one the first time I heard you play it.  Tried to look it up on YouTube a time or two, but even when I thought I’d found the right one, I could never find anyone that played it as well as you do.”
and you know how deadly dull most people are.  Besides, because I experience attraction and desire so rarely, the feeling of being attracted to someone … for me, it’s very unsettling, John.  Bewildering, even.  Easier to simply ‘meet the need’ on my own than pursue it.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John,” Sherlock says, eyeing it with suspicion.  “With your shoulder, you’ll be in agony tomorrow if you sleep on a couch, even a good one.  I will—”
As he hears Sherlock shuffling around in his bedroom – changing Rosie’s nappy, most likely, before putting her down – John stares at the tea service and debates his next move.  He’s known it was inevitable for a while now that they’d have to deal with this, discuss it eventually.  John’s known it since Sherrinford, certainly; maybe even since his wedding, if he’s really honest with himself.  Which he hadn’t been until very, very recently.  But it can’t be helped now.  He’d just hoped maybe they could have waited to talk about it until everything had settled down more.  Hoped not to spring it on Sherlock when they were still so busy just rebuilding their lives together in the aftermath of Mary’s death and Sherrinford.  Also, John’s just plain rubbish at the whole business of discussing emotions.  No help for it though.
be that.  John cares for him very deeply – of this, Sherlock remains absolutely certain – but if John actually felt that, surely he wouldn’t be exhibiting so many behaviors that push Sherlock away?  John is many things, but never a
“I, erm,” John falters a bit, “did some research last night when I couldn’t sleep and I wanted you to take a look at it.”
A gurgle of noise from Rosie’s cot saves them from drumming up future conversation, tufts of towheaded curls popping over the edge as Rosie pushes herself up on wobbly legs and reaches out to them.  Sherlock starts towards her – he’s on the side of the bed that’s closest to her, after all – but then the seawater eyes flick back to John’s and he composes himself again, watching the doctor’s face carefully.  John makes a show of yawning and stretching, arms lifted up over his head, and throws Sherlock a guilty smile.
“Tea time tomorrow, I should think,” Sherlock agrees, studying John’s face which he now seems determined not to show Sherlock in its entirety.  “Should call Molly and see if she can mind Rosie, though.  The case isn’t in London, so we’ll need to stay the night.”
The doctor’s heart is in his throat and he sends the door banging off the wall behind him as his knees nearly go out from under him.  He leans against the wall for support. Even with all the joking he’d done about Sherlock’s ‘bedroom voice’, John never actually expected to hear said voice in a bedroom.  Saying
“Yes, I’ve encouraged you to have discernibly healthy self-preservation instincts.  What a horror your life must be.”
“You’re having sex!”  A bit juvenile of him to practically shout it that way, but the idea is so preposterous that it merits the reaction, he thinks.
John recognizes his cue, as Sherlock has started to glance back and forth between the two of them with a desperate expression, so he picks up their twined hands.  John pulls Sherlock’s focus to him with a thumb and forefinger under his chin.
Her chubby hand moves to pat Sherlock’s cheek where a thin stream of tears trickles down from one eye.  “He does,” Sherlock murmurs to the girl.
She grins at John again and John returns the smile.  Hoping that the grinding of his teeth hasn’t yet become audible, Sherlock slides a hand around John’s elbow and pulls him away, one step short of being a yank.
his consideration these days….  The man who called himself a sociopath for so long has begun to show his heart without reservation and John doesn’t quite know how to accept that.  Accept that he is the recipient of that great heart so much of the time.  It makes John feel as if something is shaking loose in his chest and he is just as unsettled by it as he is warmed.
to treat anyone who puts their trust in me to help them.  Secondly, nobody gets sex completely right when they’re new at it and anyone who says they have is an enormous liar.”
“John, please,” Sherlock protests dramatically, “there are impressionable young minds present.  No need to warp your daughter’s impression of sex by introducing a Holmes into the matter.”
