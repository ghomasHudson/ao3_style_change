"You should go home and rest. The thoughts of John made your blood drain from your head to your lower body and you can't think straight."
Sherlock's head jerked so quickly John almost flinched at his startled gaze. Sherlock stared at him without saying a word, and John knew it was THIS moment. The moment he so feared and wished it would happen. Finally, he had the courage to confess what he had been hiding for so many years. Sherlock sat silently as if waiting for his next words. John noticed that his friend was trying not to breathe, so as not to disturb the moment.
The person's steps were quiet, careful. Almost undetectable. Yet thanks to his experience, he was convinced of someone's presence and that he was being followed. But was it even possible? What were the chances he'd come across the killer that same night? Take it easy, Watson. Stop panicking. Maybe it was an ordinary passerby or some scared woman? Where did the idea that the person behind him had bad intentions came from? He would have been extremely unlucky to stumble across Jack the Ripper on the same day he started working with the police. His eyes began to wander around the area, looking for a hideout or something that would help him in a confrontation. He tried not to shake his head so as not to alert the person who was following him. He walked slowly, trying to avoid the holes in the pavement. His hands were damp with sweat. He could feel his heart beating in his throat. He hoped to find a policeman at the end of the narrow street, or at least some customer of one of the local pubs.
This time he looked around the large living room. At first, he thought he had broken into the wrong apartment. The couch was skewed, the corner of the cream carpet was rolled up, piles of documents were lying around and the windows were only half-covered. The mess did not suit the character of his brother, who valued cleanliness and order. However, all his doubts were dispelled when he sniffed for the first time. He felt two familiar smells. They were mixed, but each of them was very characteristic. A friendly and calming fragrance that made him feel at home. Second irritating, causing him frustration and traumatic memories. It became obvious to him that he had reached his destination. There was no sign of his friend or brother anywhere. Of course not. Whoever would like to spend the night in the living room, when in the other room had a comfortable ... bed.
When they entered the hall, John was surrounded by Francesca and other women who were charmed by his behavior and a completely different way of being. They pulled him away from Mycroft, and John was grateful for that. For reasons he did not understand at that moment, he felt annoyed and angry at his husband, although he had no idea why. Walking with a group of women, he gave Mycroft one last look. He noticed Aaron, who was standing next to his husband with a glass in hand and a satisfied smile on his face. He definitely tried to tease Mycroft, and he probably succeeded. If John hadn't been so strangely annoyed, he would have probably saved the older man, but he wasn't going to do it now. He was fed up with Mycroft's strange game and decided to avoid him by the end of the evening.
He was awake by quietly tapping sound. He turned his head and saw a light like the night before. He had no idea what time it was but was sure that all normal people were asleep already. He got out of bed with a heavy sigh and quietly opened the door.
Mycroft and Sherlock stood in the passage of the dark alley. A shadow covered their faces. If a stranger looked at them right now, they would feel a shiver. The sun hid behind the horizon some time ago, and the dark sky was decorated with twinkling stars. John and Molly relaxed after a long journey one of the narrowest streets in the world and improved their mood by seeing beautiful flowers behind the window. They joined the Holmes brothers. They were ready to wander through the city but Sherlock let them know, they should have followed him. A few feet away there was an abandoned single room that caught the attention of the younger genius a few minutes earlier. They climbed three steps into a small, but tall room, without windows. The front door was also gone, and there was no sign that it would ever be there. The empty walls were smeared only with messy graffiti, smelled musty and damp. The room, space or whatever you could call it, was empty. There wasn't a single thing. The stone, but decorated and old floor was uneven and dirty with some red stains. The faint light coming from the lamp hung outside only added a darker mood.
Holmes tensed all his muscles in an instant, but he remained calm. "We were not to mix politics and such serious matters into our games," he said when the first shock passed.
"I mean, last night he stood on the balcony for a long time and listened to the sounds coming from your bedroom. I thought he would be more sleepy today."
Hope flashed in her eyes. John felt support and knew what she meant. He looked down at the discussing men. Mycroft sipped white wine, and Stoner took off his jacket, explaining something to the others. John kissed Francesca's hand and, remembering her warm smile, walked down the stairs. He passed the tall bodyguard, and decorative column, and stepped closer to the group of men. They stopped the discussion when they saw him. John tried to handle their attentive glances. It was difficult for him because he had never before faced so many important people at once. He stared at Mycroft and came next to the couch where genius was sitting.
Three weeks of hard training slowly gave results. He saw it in his reflection in the mirror as he stood shirtless. His stomach was slowly beginning to look like during his service in Afghanistan, and his skin became firm again. He was glad that he would regain the fitness he had during his service in the army. He liked it. It was also easier for him to accept his imperfections, which he could not overcome in any way. Exercises and diet made him feel more self-confident. Seeing his short stubble on his face, he was reminded of the days of the desert wilderness he'd spent alongside other soldiers. He felt good again, but his good mood was destroyed by a red bruise on his shoulder. He looked at the place Sebastian grabbed with such force. He remembered his fingers, his breath, and determination in his eyes. He has not changed. Even after so many years, he did not change his behavior and habits. He was still confident and determined to achieve what he wanted. Even if he had to use force. The red trace of his fingers reminded John too much of it. He grimaced when he touched the wounded place. Sebastian had always hurt him, and although John believed that he had mostly done it unknowingly, he preferred to avoid being alone with him. He clenched his teeth because he knew that perseverance would be the most important thing for him before they started their mission in unknown areas in Asia.
Even now, when he tried to pretend to act normal, he looked away. Not towards his brother or the documents that he was holding in his hands. Sherlock looked at the floor. The feeling of insecurity and unpleasant hit in his stomach stopped to surprise John. He experienced it all too often when Sherlock was around, and yet he was still worried when a friend behaved in such an unusual way. He was worried about what was going on in the head of the genius. Stress is one thing. After all, in a few days, they were to set out on an almost two-month mission with so little chance of success that the ticking bomb in the wagon seemed a triviality. But if John had to choose how to die, he wanted to do it alongside Sherlock. It would be an honor for him. He did not know what feelings prevailed in his friend and whether he was just as ready to die at his side. Sherlock always wore a mask of mystery and pretended to be impassive, as if he did not care about his life at all. As if John's safety was most important to him. He proved it many times. But John had never seen such stress and emotion before. It wasn't like Sherlock. So it had to be something else. Something more intimate, private. What had to do with him on an emotional level. This thought hit John like a thunderbolt. He bit his lips without taking his eyes off his friend. What if Sherlock got into information about his past with Sebastian? What if it was the reason for his strange behavior? Did he feel sorry for him? This was the worst possible option. John didn't want anyone to ever feel sorry for him. He did not want to experience it again, and the thought that his best friend would think of him in such a way caused a cold chill on his back. On the other hand, he trusted Mycroft. He wanted to believe that he wouldn't reveal details of his past. There was only one problem. Sherlock was a master of deduction. Even if he didn't have access to documents about their past, he could figure out... God knows what he figured out.
Lucy changed the subject. She saw that she should not talk about Sherlock and his fascination with a friend. She cleared her throat nervously and straightened, looking away from the things lying on the tables. "Haven't completed your backpack yet?"
"Molly? I thought you went to see the city," he said and started to get up from the chair, but she quickly took the chair opposite him. She did not want to attract the attention of the surroundings.
Greg laughed with his characteristic hoarseness. "I know. But life is not a directed movie. It will surprise us more than once." He smiled and relaxed. Tension gave way to relaxation. He was pleased and a little surprised that John did not object and listened to him calmly. It was as if he accepted himself and the whole situation. As if he was relieved that he no longer had to pretend to be someone he was not. Their eyes met for a long time, and Greg felt he should be courageous enough to show him that he was supporting him like a friend. "Whatever's between you, John, remember that Sherlock will always be your friend. That won't change. But you have to seize the moment and seize your luck before it runs away like ..." he mused, because he couldn't think of any an adequate comparison, "like some little kid who smeared a spray on the wall".
Loud laughter was heard almost across the water. It did not bother anyone, because the terrace that Mr. Coletti had booked that evening was empty. John did not even think Mycroft's friends might be such pleasant people, although Francesca charmed him from the first moment.
"Oh yes. Sherlock is angry, he wrote to me about it ..." John said with a smile, ignoring the strange behavior of the other man. "... He even threatened me. Indirectly, but ... Besides, I feel he must be terribly bored. Poor Mrs. Hudson, she probably ..."
Sherlock's mysteriousness made John feel insecure, but he was also excited. Of course, he missed his friend and his weird ideas, but he would have been lying if he said he was bored when he was with Mycroft. When he thought he would have the opportunity to spend the remaining days with the two Holmes brothers, he felt a strange excitement.
Indeed. Sherlock immediately recognized the owner of the letter, casting one glance at the envelope, handwriting, stamp, and even small creases. He watched John with admiration. His friend separated the envelopes without even opening them, making almost no mistake. At one point, his friend's attention was drawn to a large black envelope, lying at the very bottom of the scattered pile. John took it and began to watch it carefully. There was nothing on it. Neither the sender's or recipient's address. There was not a single stamp or signature on it. The matt - black envelope stood out from the others not only in appearance but also in size. Sherlock tried to remember where he had seen similar letters, but couldn't do it.
"I tried to explain to Mycroft that we could do better on our own, but he seems to have a different opinion." John didn't have to turn around to know that his friend was looking over his shoulder at what he was doing. "Focus on us and pay no attention to others."
"It's nice to see someone who is so different from all of those serious and stiff politicians. I wonder how someone like you ..." he looked at Mycroft with an apologetic look "...no offense. Like someone like you seduced and married someone as independent as John".
The street was dark. The rhythmic clatter was getting clearer. He could also hear the slow creaking of one of the cart's wheels as it moved slowly through the fog. The sounds came straight at him. Combined with the surrounding silence, it gave an unpleasantly dark and frightening effect. In the gloom, he could finally see two horses' mouths and steam escaping from their nostrils. He took a step back, watching the strangely grim sight. The black horses passed him very slowly, their hooves tapping on the stone pavement. A black carriage emerged from the shadows. He noticed with horror the horses slowed down until they stopped a few feet away. He looked at the black, ornate door of the carriage. A cold sweat spilt over him as he remembered Holmes' words about the murder's wealth and how he was able slipped unnoticed through the streets of London, even in his blood-stained clothes.
He moved to make room for him. "I'm going to meet Stamford this afternoon. He wants to introduce me to the man who is looking for a flatmate. There are a few hours left, so I have to fill them up with something" he paused, looking at his friend, who was occupied with his thoughts.
"I told you before. This person is attracted to someone." He couldn't figure out how John looked at him. Something between anger and jealousy, but wrapped in fake indifference. "Let's go this way" he proposed after a long moment, which he devoted to studying the face of his friend. John frowned, but went with him to one of the most famous bridges in Venice. On the Rialto Bridge, i.e. the lovers' bridge. He had a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone. He could show John how much he cares about him and at the same time get rid of the obtrusive stalker.
John recognized Molly's voice. She was sitting behind him. He shivered slightly, but immediately controlled his body and started browsing the menu.
John was relieved the topic of politics was over. His satisfaction turned into consternation when he saw what he was about to eat that afternoon. There was something on the plate in front of him that looked like anything he knew. The 'dinner' resembled pieces of peelings, arranged on a plate in disarray and sticking out in all directions. There was something green and orange in it that he could not describe otherwise as another portion of peelings pulled out of the trash can. The size of the dish would fit in one hand. Mrs. Hudson used to throw larger portions into the waste bin. John did not want to be considered a peasant without culture, but curiosity overcame him. He looked at Mycroft to draw his attention.
John would have smiled under his breath if he had been in a different situation, but this time he was not laughing. He had been tormented for four days. The return from Venice turned out to be worse than he expected, not only because of the weather or the surroundings. It was true that the return to cool and windy London from hot Italy was not the most pleasant experience. If he could, he would stay in Venice for a while longer and enjoy the scent of the sea and the warmth of the midday sun. Of course, London had its advantages too. However, this advantage was not a painful return to the gray reality. It wasn't until the day after arriving that he realized that he had experienced something incredible, and at the same time he realized that nothing would ever be the same as before the decision to pretend to be Mycroft's husband. This very decision was the beginning of stress and self-tension. Sherlock reminded him of his mistake, though he does so unconsciously. John felt trapped every morning. Like a mouse caught in a trap and watched by a human, ready to do some experiment on it. Sherlock had pretended nothing had changed for several days, although he denied it with his actions. He watched him, remained silent, and avoided taking any matters, even though clients pounded on the door. All he did was sit in his armchair and watched him out of the corner of his eye. John was fed up after two days of vigorously avoiding sensitive topics. Every time he left the house, he was inundated by a friend with questions about where he was going, with whom, and when he would come back. As he returned, Sherlock watched him closely and deduced what he was doing. But leaving the apartment didn't solve anything either, and it gave him a headache. Wherever he went, whoever he met, he felt as if he had been followed. Not by Sherlock, but by his older brother. He often saw a black car sneaking past or driving out of a neighboring street. He was also convinced, that every camera in the city followed his movements. The feeling of being stalked and spied on was unbearable.
Sherlock also apparently felt that this was not a good time to talk about Moran. He gladly agreed to John's awkward and obvious attempt to change the topic. He looked at the gun in his hand and smiled slightly as if this sight pleased him. Maybe it was. John didn't know what was going on in his mind, but he saw that Sherlock was looking at his fingers as much as at the weapon.
When Sherlock approached her, she held his face with her hand and gently brushed her lips against his cheek, trying not to leave marks. John may have been surprised by her gesture, but his shock didn't last long. After all, Francesca and Mycroft knew each other very well. John could even say Mycroft liked her, and he certainly respected her. That's why it was obvious Sherlock was no stranger to her. John saw an honest smile on friend's face.
John felt nothing. Neither anger nor relief and he didn't care what would happen in the following hours. He sat absently in front of the sparkling Molly and Sherlock, who was still ignoring him. He tried to speak as little as possible and not attract unnecessary attention. He sank into his thoughts. When the waiter brought his dinner he ate it with indifference, getting tired with every bite. At the end of dinner, Molly disappeared somewhere - he supposed she had gone to the toilet - and the waiter brought the bill, leaving it on the table in a small leather folder. John sighed softly, but as he reached for it, Sherlock's voice stopped him. A friendly and warm voice, as if nothing had happened, and the whole day and his strange behavior was his imagination.
Holmes looked ahead with a thoughtful, distant gaze. He was stroking his chin with two fingers. He did not react to the taunts of children who ran to their hansom cab with outstretched hands. Nor did he react to the smell wafting in Whitechapel, or to the sudden and rough vibrations of the carriage. "Why were you there?"
"I am sorry, Mycroft, I bothering you this morning. You are in a hurry, but Franco and I wanted to have dinner with you today. Could it be?" she asked, looking at Mycroft and John.
"*Can't buy me love. Everybody tells me so. Can't buy me love. No no no, no... Why the long face, Mycroft? You don't know this song? I heard it by accident on the internet when I was looking for information about ... London ".
"You see, my dear John. I adore your husband and I know he is good. He may be rude to a fool but if you need help he will help. Unfortunately many of them ..." she pointed at the men below again " ... or makes him angry or wants to find another way to deal with problems. My husband always stand by Mycroft's side, but that's not enough. That's why I'm glad he have you, John. "
He walked with his bare feet down the stone paths. He touched the walls of buildings with an open hand from time to time. He felt his friend, who almost rubbed his body with his hand or shoulder. The stars started to slowly disappear, the sky was not so dark, and the blurred morning light started to turn everything orange. But the narrowest streets of Venice were still dim.
"John, are you all right?" Mycroft asked, taking a last sip of water. Their dinner was almost over, and although they were sitting on the small terrace in their apartment, John still couldn't enjoy the pleasant chill coming in from the water. The sun had set an hour earlier, and his damp skin was resting on the gentle wind.
He had a restful sleep. He didn't dream of anything special and he was too tired to notice how quickly the night passed. When he woke up after a few hours, he realized he had been in one position all night, because the angel who was staring at him from the ceiling at night was still in the same place. Only the room lighting changed. From the side of his head, he could hear the calm breathing of the sleeping Mycroft and the quiet noise of the moving curtains. His eyelids were slightly ajar, which is why he saw the outline of someone's figure standing next to the bed and then he heard a familiar voice.
Mycroft hissed in pain. He quickly threw the razor and pressed the towel against the bleeding cheek. His face turned red. John could embarrass him with one sentence in the least expected place and time. He didn't look at him, but he could have sworn he did it on purpose and smiled at his embarrassment. He finished his shave and covered the wound with a piece of paper. He said goodbye to John and left the room. He didn't even walk two steps when he heard the familiar voice of one of the employees.
Sherlock sighed. "All right. You're coming with us, Molly. But try to be quiet." He came out on a narrow passage behind the buildings. The same passage that Mycroft and Stoner were passing by some time ago. It was night, and tall buildings obstructed every possible source of light. They walked slowly and in silence along the walls of the hotels.
Mycroft's good humor intrigued John more and more. John liked when Mycroft was showing him his other side. He wanted to know more, but he had no idea why.
"Don't pretend we have nothing to talk about. Usually, it's you who goes on with these kinds of topics and you don't leave me alone, so now, for a change, be quiet and let me talk ... "
The torn and stained dresses of women walking along the sidewalk immediately ceased to be interesting to him when he felt a tender touch on his fingers. He looked down and saw Holmes's hand gripping his. He stared briefly at the black glove. The fire crept slowly over his face. He turned his head and clenched his fingers in acceptance. He wanted to make it clear how much such gestures meant to him. They rode in silence, staring in opposite directions. The loud conversation of the crowd, the dozens of hooves tapping on the holes in the pavement, or the clinking of the metal parts of the harness, could not muffle a heart pounding in his chest. He absorbed every second of the silent tension between him and the detective. If only this moment could last forever...
The detective quickly straightened and sighed with irritation. "Do I have to do everything? An autopsy is not my responsibility."
I suspect many of you are reading this story for Johncroft. I love it too! Could I write a story about them after this one? I think yes. But I don't want to do this. I think Johncroft deserves more of my attention and improvement. I don't want it to be some boring story, or a story mainly about sex. Of course, I pay the same amount of attention to each of my work, so you can expect the most polished story that I am able to write.
"What a jerk," Molly snapped. "When he stood and watched, I felt like coming and punching his other eye."
"Everything is so expensive here ... A glass of water costs almost as much as dinner in an ordinary London bar," Molly muttered, browsing the menu. A cheerful smile did not disappear from her face.
John froze. He looked at Sebastian, who was standing in the doorway and was staring at him. He covered the door with his body, preventing security guards from entering the room. Their patience, however, had a limit, so after a while they pushed Moran into the room and stood next to him, pretending to be uninterested in their surroundings. Bruises and scratches covered their faces. Their wrists were wrapped with bandages, and one of them licked his cracked lip. Sebastian looked just like them. John knew why. He didn't meet Moran yesterday. For too long he lived with him in one camp in Afghanistan not to know, that strength solutions were his favorite way to achieve his goal. He also knew why he had beaten the bodyguards and other agents who had to intervene. Such situations have happened several times, all because Sebastian could not do what he wanted. Until their departure for the mission, he was strictly forbidden to approach him, and yet he tried to do it. Many times. In the end, however, he gave up, because he knew that soon he would have the best opportunity to be alone with him. In a place where John couldn't escape. In a distant area in southern Asia. In a place where they will have to work together to achieve the goal.
A moment later he lay comfortably on his stomach on a large bed and enjoyed the delicate scent of the pillow. He didn't think about Mycroft, he didn't think about Sherlock. His thoughts drifted away, and he felt his body weaken. He got rid of uncomfortable shoes and nestled into the soft mattress of the huge bed. He closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep.
While they were sitting in the plane he wondered about the reasons for this forced journey, glancing at John from time to time. After arriving, they didn't even have time to talk. They were immediately taken to the second floor of the building, where they had to wait for further orders. In the meantime, Mycroft joined them. He didn't seem too eager to explain this sudden meeting. He didn't look ready to talk at all. Sherlock tried to force him to be honest, but it did nothing. Even when they were alone. Mycroft was silent, and Sherlock finally gave up, although he guessed that this type of behavior meant problems.
Sherlock was patient. It was one of those traits that he had developed since he was a child and which proved to be useful on a daily basis and in most of the matters he dealt with. He was patient when the situation demanded. He was patient when he was sure it would benefit him. Now, however, he was afraid that this trait would damage his plan rather than help him achieve his goal. It's been four days since they returned home. He knew John better than anyone else, so he avoided topics that could in any way lead them to talk about love, relationships, and the last two weeks. Although it was very difficult for him, he did not press John, he did not try to approach him or give a signal that would confuse him. He wanted to allow him to think and make the right decision. It was true that he continued to watch him. He still desired his touch. However, he restrained himself and remained moderate and patient, although it was getting harder day by day. He wanted John to consciously and courageously open his heart to him, and choose to live by his side as a partner and beloved one, and that this decision would not be taken in a fit of moment or impulse that could change his way of thinking in the future.
Mycroft's words caught John's attention. He finally joined him and took his place on a wooden chair. "But this time you have no choice" he muttered in a kind voice, looking into the eyes of an older man. "If there is a slight chance that it will succeed, then you have to try to trust me and let me act on my own. You can't control everything and everyone, Mycroft. Look at me and promise from now on you will try to stop with this whole spying on me".
"John, please ... Leave thinking for me. The only reason you are here is because I need your help with this little show. It's just like I said before. Don't do anything other than what we agreed to do."
"Yeah ... It looks like he's angry with me because he hasn't tried to contact me since yesterday. But I feel he will show his disapproval when we return to London ..." he said and reached for an elegant glass of water standing on the table. He couldn't see it, but Mycroft carefully watched him put his mouth against the glass, swallowed the water, and sucked in his lower lip, getting rid of the remaining water. "Mycroft ..." John said without looking at the other man. He put down the glass and started playing with it with his fingers. "... speaking of yest..."
"Stay close, John. The whole hotel is secure and nobody can leave it until the meeting is over. Francesca will keep you company. Go upstairs and wait" Mycroft pointed to the stairs hidden behind the decorated column. John turned his head in this direction when he suddenly felt a soft kiss on his hand.
John was facing the kitchen, but Sherlock imagined his face. He also saw the remains of a failed experiment. Purple dust stuck to kitchen cabinets and the table. It decorated toaster, jars and other things. Only the floor was clean because Mrs. Hudson said she would help him clean the floor, otherwise, the dust would spread all over the flat. Sherlock saw John's shoulders drop in resignation, as did his head.
"What are you doing?" he asked, turning his head, not quite knowing what his friend was looking for.
When the car stopped on the sidewalk, none other than Mycroft came out of it. He opened the door wide without a word and waited for John. John gave him a look of tiredness and resignation, but after a moment he slipped inside the vehicle. The car drove away from the hospital. There was a moment of tension and silence between them. John looked out the window and waited for Mycroft to start the conversation. After a moment he heard him take a breath.
Two men gracefully crossed metal handrails. The last person, a woman in an evening gown, was not doing so well. She had to lean on the shoulders of one of the men. A light wind blew the fabric of her dress. The man in front all the time turned around and checked how the other two were going, although the most of his attention was focused on his companion who was walking right behind him. The sight of these three people was so strange and comical that the gondolier could no longer hold back. He gave a long whistle, which caught their attention. He grinned and when he was about to yell some vulgar joke, another boat hit the back of his gondola. He immediately looked at his colleague and at that moment his Italian temperament possessed him.
"How much?" John asked. He set his nearly empty bottle down on the ground. "How much do you need?" he repeated the question, reaching for his wallet.
"I just want to make sure I can celebrate the win this time. Usually, you're the winner," Aaron sighed, but he was in a good mood.
Their footsteps and the rhythmic clatter of cane sounded three times louder than under normal circumstances. All this was due to the empty halls, the coldness of which resembled a prison rather than a place where hundreds of students passed each day and where professors spent time on their own research. The only positive element was the wide windows that provided a satisfactory amount of light. They came halfway down the hall when the door to one of the offices quietly swung open. They saw a tall man in a beige suit and a dark hat covering his blond hair. Something in the man's posture caught Holmes's attention. He slowed down and narrowed his eyes. The stranger, however, did not notice them. He closed the door and wandered on, soon disappearing down the corridor.
"Thank you," John said quietly. "I shouldn't be happy with this situation, but I was relieved when Sherlock contacted me and happily announced that Lestrade had finally found an interesting case for him."
The forearm lying in front of his eyes was heavy and numb. He lifted his hand with difficulty, narrowing his eyes in an instant. It took him a long time to get used to the brightness. He opened his eyes, wondering where he was and why. The wallpaper on the wall seemed unfamiliar to him, as did the scent. Short bits of the previous day appeared in his head like flashes of lightning. - A glass in a black glove. Lestrade crouching over the body. Golden microscope. The carriage swinging from side to side. Dark alley. Blood. A lot of blood. Wide-open eyes and a wound on a woman's neck...
"Molly, where's Sherlock?" he asked, not hiding the surprise and suspicion in his voice. He heard a small giggle. He didn't like it at all. Molly pointed her finger back into the bedroom, then blushed and walked quickly, almost cheerfully, toward the bathroom on the other side of the room.
John raised a corner of his mouth. He wondered why Sherlock started thinking about such things ... John wasn't sure why, but his heart sped up when he thought his friend felt confident enough to talk about his feelings and emotions with him. Sherlock revealed his sensitive nature.
The trousers belt loosened as his attacker tried to get rid of the last obstacles between their skin. He felt the adrenaline fill him. Helplessness gave way to determination and the will to fight. He wished the murderer's blood would splash on the walls and fill the drains. He looked up, and he saw something that made him barely contain a groan of frustration. He still held the cane tightly clenched in his hand. His initial fear obscured his sobriety, and he forgot all about it. The murderer's hard member was digging harder and harder between his bottom, making him grow into a rage with every second. He tighter wrapped his fingers around the cane and gripped it in his sweaty hand. As the trousers slowly slid off his hips, he took a deep breath, straightened, and quickly delivered the blow. He felt the tip of the cane dig into the attacker's body as he let out a muffled sigh. He turned, immediately grabbing the cane in both hands. The murderer crouched and leaned his back against the opposite wall. It was too dark to see any detail, but he knew the killer was stunned and in pain from the sudden impact. He wasn't going to feel sorry for him. He tightened his grip and delivered another blow. The cane whistled through the air. It hit the murderer on the shoulder, then cracked with a crunch into two pieces. He closed his eyes to protect them from the pieces of flying wood. When he opened them, he saw the gleam of a knife in the hand of a crouching murderer. He was still in great danger. He threw the remains of his cane at him. Now he had only one chance to stop the murderer. He run deeper into the aisle, jumping over the woman's body. After a few steps, he fell to his knees. He could see nothing but feel the cool cobblestones and small stones under his hands. With quick movements, he tried to find the revolver, that must have been lying somewhere there. He prayed the murderer would not stab him in the back. After a few nervous moments, he finally found what he was looking for. He pulled the trigger and turned, aiming ahead. He was sure the attacker was right behind him.
"But on one condition ..." he added and looked at Mycroft. The older man livened up at his declaration. He showed no joy or contentment, but John saw relief on his face.
John didn't quite know what was going on. He looked around. He saw Lucy, who was leaning back against the rock and with her eyes closed trying to control her breathing. Arian was squatting next to her. John turned to his friend and realized what he was talking about. He smiled and snorted softly as he released his hand, which he kept tightly clenched in his hand all the time. Sherlock did not hide his amusement. The slight wrinkles around his eyes never disappeared from his face. John's entertainment ceased as he realized that he had released Sherlock's hand at the last moment because Sebastian and Josh were already reaching the rock. They also seemed tired of this sprint, although Josh was the most exhausted one. Moran was doing great. He breathed only a few times and slowly looked at the group. Then he focused his eyes on the doctor. He stared at him long and insistently. To the point that John was about to admonish him, using his sarcasm, but ultimately he didn't have to.
"Mycroft? What happened?" He asked when he had had enough silence. Instead of an answer, he heard a murmur of dissatisfaction. Only now John realizes that the eyes of the older man were focused on the big bed.
"How did Mycroft persuade you to pretend to be his husband, John? This is obviously your relationship is fake. You pretending this relationship since not long ago. But ... how did this reptile convince you to do it?" he asked directly. He knew he shouldn't play with John any longer because he might regret it.
He stood nonchalantly, leaning against the door frame. As usual, he had a perfect hairstyle, shiny eyes, and a beautiful smile. A gray three-piece suit and a gold tie woven with green thread made him look just astonishing. He was holding a single red rose, which he rotated between his fingers. He was surprised to see Molly. The surprise lasted a split second because a moment later he grinned and winked seductively at her.
Turning his head seemed unnecessary and annoying to him. He was focused on two people, he had been thinking about for a long time, so he did not intend to interrupt the continuity of his thoughts just to please the stranger a person whom he would not remember anyway. He approached the hotel entrance and saw a high staircase with a red carpet and a huge bouquet of fresh flowers through the glass door.
"Of course, signore. You are right. The apartment is ready and is waiting for you. Follow me, please ..."
John frowned. He stopped Sherlock from pulling him to a kiss. He stared straight at him for a long moment. "Kiss me with other words on your lips."
He heard a crunch. His gaze drifted to where the disturbing noise had come from. He waited a long time for the figure to emerge from the shadows. And he finally saw it. He lowered his gaze as a small shape ran under the wall of the building. It took a moment to realize what he was looking at.
He looked suspiciously at the hand outstretched in his direction. Accepting the drink seemed as unwise as refusing to do so. He leaned over hesitantly and took the glass, but not the one the man was offering him. He sat down and waited for the stranger's reaction.
Mycroft fell silent, but not for long. "Then we'll meet later." He picked up the bottle, but before he pressed the button, he gave John a brief look again. "If this is not too much of a problem for you, take your phone with you this time," he said in a strange tone. Something between irony and amusement. He sprayed the perfume, but a few drops reached John. A delicate smell spread throughout the bathroom. Carnation and incense. It was so pleasant that John closed his eyes, inhaling and remembering the aroma. Mycroft looked and stared at him without saying a word. "Take a bath before you go down for breakfast."
Mycroft contorted his face in a remarkably similar way to his brother's when he doubted or disagreed with something. "Sherlock wouldn't be happy if I didn't change my attitude towards you. Especially when we're alone."
He looked at his friend. He was terrified because John's face was pale, almost blue with terror. He seemed to stop breathing and didn't look up. He stood staring straight ahead, his fists clenched. He didn't answer the questions. He moved only when Sherlock put his hand lightly on his shoulder. However, this was not the reaction he expected. He didn't think John would ever flinch and stand back, feeling his closeness. Sherlock felt a piercing shock and pain when John jumped in surprise, knocked his hand away, and stood against the wall. Dozens of thoughts immediately appeared in his head about why his friend had reacted in this way. One thing was certain. They must have known each other for a long time. But what did they have in common? Any close relationship? Sherlock shuddered at the thought. He had found himself once in a situation where John's past had made him sadly conclude that his friend had other relationships and friendship. Whatever it was, it didn't end well. John's reaction was proof. And although Sherlock felt the pain of rejection and the pain of John's torment, he decided to find out what connected his best friend with the mysterious man from the secret cell.
He couldn't help but smile as he watched the carriage depart. Mrs Hudson was another reason why he wanted to live in Baker Street. Even if his move was to entail a risk that Holmes drew like a magnet. That's right. Holmes. He was for sure waiting for him with some important information.
He realized, he really needed it and dreamed of such a rest. He heard Sherlock sit down next to him. They were silent for a long moment. They listened to the conversations carried by the waters and the sounds of music from nearby cafes. John rested with a smile on his face. He heard the water rushing down the stone walkways and port and listened to the waving gondolas.
"Sherlock said he would spend this all day with me and you could join. You know this city better than we do."
John smiled and buried his face in the pillow even harder. "I got a reprimand from Mycroft. He was mad at me. I can't get along with him lately ..."
Apart from the victim, no one was there anymore. He breathed a sigh of relief and immediately realized the roles had changed. He was the hunter now. He couldn't let the killer getaway. Especially since he was so close. This could be the only opportunity to catch the killer red-handed. He fought the urge to make sure the woman was dead. He couldn't waste any time. He walked around her and ran into the street. He was looking for the murderer, holding his unbuttoned trousers in his hand. Where could he run away? Which way?
He was about to say goodbye to Dr Hooper and follow the detective's footsteps when the sight of her face stopped him. The longing had appeared in the hardened and belligerent eyes. Desire. The fragility of gaze, an irregular wave of eyebrows. Bitten lip. He was familiar with this view, and he knew what it meant and what feelings and emotions were behind it. He understood what was causing the hostility and stubbornness in Dr Hooper's earlier behaviour. A wave of compassion flooded his heart. The hopelessness of the situation she found herself in must have been hard for her to bear.
Josh pulled the strings gently and elegantly. The instrument made a pleasant sound. "How can you be sure it won't be useful? Anything can be used as a weapon. I believe that you should always expect the unexpected," he announced proudly. He immediately felt a strong blow in the back of his head. He flew forward but managed to stay on his stump.
Flashing, intense blue light interrupted his thoughts. It reflected in the windows of nearby apartments. John knew he was going to have a long conversation with some police officer, but he would love to take the opportunity to spend the next few hours at the police station in the cell. It would give him some more peace. The thought of a single cell gave him courage, so he ostentatiously drained the beer bottle and emptied it in front of the approaching man.
"Over there, sir ..." a boy with red cheeks streaked with dirt pointed his finger "... in the eastern part of town. Jack the Ripper got another woman. He split her open like a pig".
He thought for a moment, looking for the answer. "I won't do that again," Sherlock nodded as if to make sure he was speaking honestly.
"John, listen ..." Sherlock couldn't finish because his friend managed to free himself away from his hand. He was about to move on when he suddenly saw a stir among the guests and heard a distorted male voice. Someone stood in the middle of the dance floor and surrounded Mycroft with his arm. Mycroft pretended everything was fine and that forced touch didn't bother him. John could not understand the man's words, but when everyone looked in his direction, he understood he should join his husband in the middle of the room. He ignored Sherlock, pushed through the crowd, and finally stood next to Mycroft. Suddenly people started to encourage them to do something that John did not understand yet. He was a bit confused, so he looked at Mycroft and the other man who leaned toward him.
"But I have to agree with you. Mycroft is reluctant to maintain close relationships with the people around him. Things are different when it comes to the people he cares about. There are not many of them, that's true. However, when Mycroft has an important person, he does everything to protect them and he starts to... be more interested".
"... that's why my dad always cheered me on and was happy with every success I have." These were her first words that Aaron had understood since he had completely shut down his thoughts and hidden in his mind. He didn't show it. What's more, he brought his chair closer to Molly, and leaned toward her even more, squeezing her hand.
Reflecting on the reasons for Sherlock's strange behavior and concluding that it was one of his experiences, John became more and more irritated. He wasn't going to be part of some experiment, even more, for such a delicate issue as feelings. Sherlock could try his specifics on him, he could feed him strange things just to satisfy his curiosity, he could also lock him in the room and tell him various things ... However, he did not intend to allow Sherlock to play with his emotions. John was afraid to analyze his own feelings. And there was no way he would allow Sherlock to do these experiments. He decided to protect his emotional side from Sherlock's prying eye.
He sighed. "Quite different than I thought I would have after these two weeks. Your brother's company is not unpleasant," he said, staring into the eyes of a friend who narrowed his eyes to hear that. "At first I believed that it would be an unpleasant necessity for the benefit of my patients. That I would return to London and want to forget about this trip ..." he fell silent and fought the urge to cover his face with his hand. "The first days were difficult, but somehow we managed to communicate and get along. I do not regret that I agreed to his proposal. After all, I already had the experience of dealing with a difficult personality" he looked into Sherlock's eyes. "I'm glad you came. Although you were a little weird this time."
"Did you mean this place, John? That is where they sell the best remedy for purging?" Sherlock asked loudly, without looking at anyone around. He stared at the inscription of the hotel and pretended that he had not noticed how the short owner with a bushy mustache, perfectly fitting into the Italian stereotype, turns to him and gives him a dissatisfied look. "Is this the place where they, as you say, mix wine with water?"
Of course. That's why they were here. They were supposed to check what the potential murder weapon looked like and where it could be found or bought. He remembered the offices on each floor, but he couldn't remember any knives collection. But he trusted Holmes. After all, he had to be a regular visitor here. He walked through the long corridors without hesitation, without even looking lost for a moment. They reached the west wing of the building, leaving behind the faculty of science and technology.
Mrs. Hudson, famous for her keen eye and knowing a lot about romance, realized that something must have happened between her beloved boys and that this "something" was different from the rest of the time when the atmosphere between John and Sherlock was tense. John could see how difficult it was for her not to comment and to keep her distance, so he was grateful every time he saw when she was fighting the temptation to ask one of them about the cause of a depressing situation. She avoided being upstairs frequently, she was cleaning up the mess in their flat without a word and was involving John in minor repairs and shopping when she saw as his face started to go pale under the pressure of Sherlock's heavy gaze. She tried to help them in her own way.
"Mycroft clearly has some uncomfortable request for you and hesitates what to do about it," the genius said after a moment.
3. This story should be: realistic / fantasy / horror / based on some movie or book?/ Comedy? Or a combination of two styles?
The subconscious acted on his body. He woke up, but not enough to open his eyes or even move a finger. He was still drifting half asleep, unknowingly noting the world around him. He did not hear the crackle of burning wood. The room wasn't so warm anymore. It must have been morning because faint light shone through his eyelids. He wondered why his body - trained and experienced in many years of service - made him remain vigilant subconsciously. He sensed someone's presence. Someone was standing next to the sofa. It surprised him, but he knew where he was. He felt safe. The strange and unusual behaviour did not alarm him. He realized that the person next to him was most likely Holmes. He did not have the strength to confront him yet, so he abandoned his thoughts and slowly fell into sleepy nothingness. He changed his mind as the detective shifted and knelt beside him. He did not see but heard and felt his movements. A slender, chill finger touched his cheek, slowly stroking the skin beside his eye and his nose. The gentle caress lasted a long moment, then moved to his lower and then upper lip. The touch was soft, gentle. It took long seconds to disappear. What remained was the burning gaze he felt on his face. Something came closer. He remained calm as something hot and wet stuck to the cut on his right cheek. He felt a blast of warm air. The move repeated one more time. Under normal circumstances, he would have been looking for an answer. He would try to convince himself of the truth of what was happening. But he was so tired at the moment that he could just imagine this all.
"Finally. It took you long. We were wondering if we should go to your rescue," Josh said, playing with the guitar he was holding on his lap.
Passing narrow and winding streets, Sherlock would stop from time to time and show them the grim recesses in which the bodies of the victims were found. He drew conclusions that at that time no one could have guessed. He exposed the ineptitude of the judiciary and accurately assessed the errors of specialists at the time. John and Molly listened to his deductions with pleasure, but Mycroft said nothing. He watched the commitment of his brother and from time to time also looked at John. His face didn't show much, but he didn't look like someone who was forced to be there and was bored to death. When Sherlock finally explained that behind the crimes stood a sixty-five-year-old traveling watchmaker known to the police for his tendency to pedophilia and repeatedly punished for homosexual practices, they went to the scene of another crime. It was getting really dark. The area was free of tourists who preferred lit and more popular places in the southwest of the city. Only the locals wandered around and dealt with daily matters.
John wanted more. He wanted to cuddle up with Mycroft, kiss him, feel his body. The tongue that caressed and irritated his ear and hot breath affected his crotch. He wanted to let Mycroft know he needed more, so he raised his hips and pressed against the body of an older man. He felt bulges in his trousers. Mycroft's fingers lazily massaged him in an unsatisfactory place so far. But now Mycroft pressed his hand to John's pulsing penis. A deep growl came from Mycroft's throat. He started to rub against John's buttocks.
"Good luck!" Greg yelled from behind the steering wheel as he pulled his car to a stop on the Baker Street.
John rolled his eyes. He looked at the other man who, without taking his eyes off him, tried to take off his shirt. He succeeded a moment later and returned to John's arms with a satisfied smile. In fact, he wanted to get back into his arms, but he jumped out of bed and went to the bathroom. He came back and brought some cream with him. He put it next to John. He knelt on the bed and pulled off John's trousers and underwear. He put the cream on his fingers and lay between John's open thighs. Then he kissed him. John was trembling as Mycroft caressed his lips with his tongue and spread the cream with his free hand around the sensitive area.
"Of course it's not," Mycroft said, apparently fed up with this performance. "This hole is the result of an unprofessional attempt to hung the painting on the wall. The neighbors apparently can't use the drill because they have drilled over two feet of a thick wall." He came calmly to the stain. "And this ..." he said, pointing to the floor, "... this is not dried blood, it is just a damp stain left after flooding."
He was rested and full of energy. The living room he was sitting in was empty. Not empty in the typical sense of the word. The excess of decorated, but tasteful furniture, rugs, paintings and other things was overwhelming. However, it lacked people. John was used to the constant presence of others, so when he left the bathroom and saw that Mycroft had already left the apartment, he suddenly felt lonely. He was alone in the large living room. He had a few hours before he would have dinner with Francesca and her husband, and because it was his last day in Venice, he decided to spend it most actively. He put on his vest, though he knew he would regret it soon, because the day was going to be hot and muggy, and he left the apartment, closing the door behind him. He heard the noise of conversations from the rest of the hotel. He came to the next apartment. He knocked twice, immediately jumping back when he heard quick footsteps coming from inside the living room, a muffled crash, like a fallen chair, and Molly's surprised voice trying to reprimand Sherlock. The door opened quickly.
Mycroft immediately decided to get to the point. "What I'm going to ask you is ... Will you reject normality and accept both of us? As you can see, we both agreed and we are completely at your disposal."
Sherlock understood that he would no longer be able to focus on his thoughts. He crossed his legs and put his hands on the armrests. "You are right, Mrs. Hudson. In that case, maybe you can try to persuade Mrs. Turner to travel together? Our neighbor has been waiting for such a proposal for a long time," he said. He leaned sideways and grabbed the porcelain jug. He poured some tea into the cup and after a moment he found it cold, but he didn't mind. He guessed that he had to spend a long time thinking about John.
"Let me look at you for a little longer." This time Sebastian's voice was barely audible. He leaned over John and murmured the request directly into his ear.
John finally understood his strange behavior. He almost breathed a sigh of relief, but he suddenly realized a kiss in the hand would not be the last thing that would happen between them in that evening.
"More like a babysitter. Mr Holmes isn't able to do a thing without me." Her smile was sincere, contagious. She put the tray on the table and, straightening up, pointed her finger at the detective. "He even can't make himself a cup of tea without my help," she added jokingly. She watched him for a long time, her eyes twinkling. "You were right," she said over her shoulder to the detective. "Dr Watson is much more handsome in real life than in the newspapers... I'm glad you got rid of them," she said with a grimace, pointing to the space under her nose.
"Buona sera, signori," he said in Italian. John loved the language and couldn't help smiling back. He stared at the handsome man, meanwhile, Mycroft entered the gondola and turned to John, offering him a hand. John blinked and took his delicate hand. He felt a shiver when he remembered that the same hand was caressing and touching him in the most private places. Mycroft probably knew his thoughts because he quickly brushed John's fingers with his mouth, released his hand, and took sit. John was not very comfortable so he sat down opposite Mycroft and facing the man at the stern. He wanted to force the genius not to stare at him so intensely.
Loud steps caught his attention. He looked where the noise was coming from. Three pairs of heavy shoes climbed the glass stairs. He saw the three men only when they entered the corridor. One of them, the one in the front, caught his eye at once. He was muscular and tall. His stomach muscles were visible from under his black shirt. He walked with a serious face, looking under his feet. This was not due to shyness or uncertainty. The man had no pleasure looking around the corridor. He had to be here often. Sherlock immediately realized that he was looking at one of those people that Mycroft and his friends interrogated in the underground rooms under the building. His appearance was screaming - danger - but Sherlock had no idea what could be the reason for his detention and for how long he had been interrogated by people like Mycroft. Only one thing was clear. The man was not here of his own free will and would gladly return to his small cell, to which he probably already got used to. He deduced it from his face. Pretty handsome face, though marked with scars and a short red beard. The other two men were his bodyguards, or rather agents who were supposed to keep him in control, guide him, and eventually immobilize him if they had to. However, this did not seem to be the case. The man looked like he was about to return to his cell at any moment, which confirmed Sherlock's belief that he had to spend several years in a secret prison.
He looked at his cane. "They shot me," he said with a grimace. "After the operation, the doctor said that I would only have a scar, but he was wrong, as you can see."
"No, it's nothing. I just thought I would like you to satisfy my other whims with such enthusiasm and passion ..." John said and watched as a smile appeared on the other man's lips. The atmosphere eased completely. John finally breathed a sigh of relief. He saw Mycroft was relaxed too.
"I'm glad you finally decided to join us, Mr Holmes. Though it would be better if you refrained from questioning witnesses and wait for one of the officers so that he could make notes as well."
"Fingerprints". Holmes approached the table and looked at the scattered sheets of paper. "I'm working to prove that fingerprints are the future of criminology."
Mycroft sighed but tried to behave normally. He rubbed his tired eyes with his fingers, and when a doctor appeared next to him, he gladly grabbed the offered glass of water. "Thank you".
John looked at the coins in his wallet, then took them in his hand. Seven pounds and thirty pence. That was all he had left after cruising around the city all night. He never thought he would spend a quarter of his salary in a single night. All the more so for something as pitiful as alcohol. He was slowly turning into his sister and beginning to understand her point of view. Most of the time, love and alcohol went hand in hand. Especially if love ran into problems. However, he decided that the bottle of beer lying next to the bench would be his last one that night. He thought no longer. He turned the hand that held the money and held it out towards the drunk man.
He got up from his chair, but he didn't look at them even for a second. "I'll go change my shoes. These are not suitable for long walks," he said. He imagined he would hear Sherlock's ironic giggle because his voice was numb and unnatural.
"Oh really?" asked the older man. John knew that tone. He could bet his husband was smiling in this mean and artificial way just like when he usually used sarcasm.
"Sorry, John, but I refuse. It will be better for both of us if we spend the rest of the trip separately." Maybe he would be more convincing if he didn't avoid the doctor's eyes. He stood staring ahead. The orange sun warmed his pale face.
Sherlock opened his eyes slightly. He saw his landlady sitting happily in John's chair. She had to talk to him for some time, though he wasn't going to make an effort to look at his watch. He was a bit annoyed that she interrupted his thoughts about John, but what else could he expect? Mrs. Hudson always had a great sense of time and appeared when he wanted to be alone. He sighed softly and closed his eyes again.
"They're all for you." John might have been able to successfully hide slight jealousy in his voice, but he was betrayed by a frown and a quiet sigh.
At this point, Holmes quickly turned his head and spoke a few sentences directly into the ear of the other man, who did not change position or look away for a moment. Wrinkles appeared at the corner of the stranger's eyes as he smiled slightly. The detective's body was tense and his hands tightly clenched behind his back. When he turned and started walking towards the exit, his shapely lips formed a thin line now, and his narrowed eyes were covered by the gloomy shadow of his cylinder.
"What happened to your gallantry?" John narrowed his eyes slightly. He wasn't offended, he rather pretended to be.
John smiled. "Josh knows many languages and we count on his help, but what if something happens to him? What if he loses his voice for some reason? Or hearing?" He did not mention Sherlock's ability to learn languages quickly and effectively consciously. He knew that sometimes it was worth not mentioning a fact, especially since others did not need to know about it.
Mycroft finally had the opportunity to sleep off those few days, and John as a doctor and... maybe not the best, but still friend, wanted to let him do it at all costs. He was not interested in anything other than Mycroft's health at the moment, so without any regret, he hung up again when the obtrusive caller rang again. Still holding the phone in his hand, he waited for the third call, but this time the phone was silent.
"Good night, John." This time Mycroft's answer rang in the room so quickly that John thought he heard the echo of his own words. He blinked uncertainly several times, looking at the older man and crossed his arms over his chest.
"Because he asks ..." John showed him a message from Mycroft, "... did we finally get this envelope."
At first glance, the old woman seemed to be a dove-hearted person, but her face exposed a pugnacious woman who was afraid to express her opinion honestly.
"So cute! And so fluffy" Molly was delighted with the new companion. She scratched the red cat's neck and ears. "Are you hungry?" she asked, looking the cat straight in the eye.
John ate breakfast and went to Sherlock's apartment. He came to the door and was not surprised when it was open. He lightly pressed the door handle and went inside. He had time to look more closely at the room. The living room was large. He saw open windows with blue curtains. John could say the living room was quiet. He heard the sound of water and felt a pleasant draft. The wind made the sheets lay on the ground across the living room. The room looked elegant, but it had a different color than John and Mycroft's apartment. This living room had blue curtains and a blue rug and looked less cozy than the living room in their apartment.
"I can understand now why every time I see Mycroft, I have the impression that he has this specific aura around him."
The figures became clearer with each step. After a while, he recognized Holmes' slender figure. His top hat and long coat stood out against the white walls. The second man was a head shorter than the detective. The underside of his toga moved with every gust of air. He listened to the detective in silence, head proudly held high. They were both busy with the ongoing discussion. He approached them, hearing the thudding of his own heart, the rushing of blood, and the clatter of his cane. He wanted to tell the detective about what he discovered as soon as possible. He stared at him, hoping that Holmes would pay attention to him. But the one who finally looked at him was the other man. He turned his head and watched him intently. His dark eyes narrowed for a moment, then curiosity flashed across his face.
