He knows that they keep a first aid kit in the closet by the kitchen, so he goes to grab that first. He can hear his parents talking quietly in the living room while they watch TV, so he tries to be as stealthy as possible. After he grabs the first aid kit, he goes to the kitchen to get some ice packs. By the time he gets back to the gazebo, he can see that Dean’s tried to prop himself up against the wall, but his head is lolling a bit to the side.
Maybe she’s just keeping him distracted until the black van arrives. Abbadon leans over and snips a few more dead pieces from the bush with her shears. Dean wonders for a moment how hard he’d have to push down on her neck with those shears before seeing blood. He shakes his head to clear it.
that engulfed him was something he’d never felt before. His hips thrust up automatically, and Dean gagged slightly. “Sorry,” Castiel blushed.
“Good,” Abbadon nods. “Some omegas can’t handle the requirements that come with their gender designation. They can’t do what needs to be done to save this nation. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
Just as he’s about to take his first heavenly bite, Charlie drops a stack of papers down on the desk in front of him with a loud thump. “Oh, come on,” Dean groans.
Castiel gave him a look, but then he sighed and pulled the car around. He parked the car, and Dean was suddenly hit with the realization that this was it. He’d offered twenty grand to this guy to drive him to Paris, and now they were here. Castiel was going to get back to his life, and Dean was going to have to do things alone again. He’d only known Cas for a day now, but the idea of saying goodbye was causing a pit to form in his stomach.
“How did Mr. Novak’s birthday party go?” Benny asked. Dean had confided in him the other day about how nervous he was. He and Castiel had sort of signed an unspoken truce a few weeks ago after the charity benefit, but it seemed that truce had just expired. Dean started filling Benny in on the bet the two of them made when he heard a
Gadreel sighs in disappointment before Gabriel grabs him by the neck and shoves him into the wall. Even though Gabe is a pretty short guy, he’s surprisingly strong. “Get him out of here,” he says to the guards who’d escorted Gadreel here from the prison.
Dean gasps in a lungful of air and really hopes it doesn’t sound like he’s crying over the phone. He wants to yell and get angry, but all that comes out of his mouth is a tiny, “I can’t believe he would do this.”
Normally Dean would've laughed, but he was too freaked out at the moment. He ran towards the bathroom and closed the door, trying to calm himself down. He listened to Blue talk to whoever was at the door. It sounded like the same bouncer who had showed them how to get to Crowley’s office. The man reminded them that the fight was about to start and that Crowley set up one of the private viewing boxes for them to sit in.
“Alfie doesn’t have the authority that Senator Pike holds,” Dean says, confused. “He shouldn’t want to talk to him, he should want to talk to Larry.”
He grabs his gun from where he’s hidden it under the floorboards and puts it in his pants just in case. He probably won’t need it, but better to be safe than sorry. He puts on his over coat and grabs the keys to the Commander’s car on his way out of the guest house. He takes the stairs down to the driveway two at a time and gets into the car. He doesn’t worry about anyone potentially watching him as he starts it, because he’s the only one watching around here. Or at least the only one in this neighborhood.
Sam goes over towards Jo to make sure she’s okay, leaving Dean alone with Castiel. “Look, man,” Dean starts awkwardly. “About what I said earlier—"
Before he can sneak back to the guesthouse to take matters into his own hands, he feels someone bump into him from behind.
“And you didn’t tell Castiel?” Gabriel asked. “Whatever, she danced with me all night.” He raised his voice a bit. “I figured it’d be obvious.”
“Not only that, brother,” Benny cut in. The two of them must’ve had him on speakerphone. “This morning I followed the two of them to the Impala. They found the note you asked me to put there, but Dean didn’t seem to react at all to it.”
“I don’t know anything anymore,” Jo explains. “After what happened, I’m too dangerous to be a part of it.”
Dean stopped mid-bite. “That’s not what I meant,” he said. “You can stay here longer if you want to.” Castiel’s eyes flashed up to meet his, and he could see that Dean was blushing. The pink in his cheeks contrasted nicely with his freckles. “I actually…” Dean started and then cleared his throat again. “I don’t have any plans either.” Castiel nodded, not really understanding what he was getting at. He watched Dean take a breath before he spoke again. “Would you like to pick up where we left off?”
Dean followed right behind him and couldn’t help his gasp when they stepped inside of the city. The entrance led directly to a long ramp that went down into a pit where most of the city was located down below. There appeared to be three levels of buildings. There were buildings in line with where they were standing right now, there was a middle level, and then the floor of the pit which was where the most people were walking around. It looked like there was a main circle of stores and activity and then behind that was the more residential area. As with all new structures in the Wasteland, the buildings were pretty makeshift, built out of whatever wood, metal, and other materials were laying around, but this was the most developed and civilized area Dean had ever seen. He understood why people wanted to live there! With a wall and guards to protect them, people could live safely without fear of being attacked or having their things stolen.
After a few seconds of that Charlie groans, “Fine. I’m going to go grab us some drinks.” She stands up. “Novak, do you want anything?”
“Cats,” Castiel answered immediately, and Dean couldn't help but smile a bit. He was a little allergic to cats, but Castiel’s love for his cat, Angel was one of the cutest things about him. Dean was too tired to even bother arguing with himself right now over his use of the word ‘cute’ to describe his neighbor.
“Then he realized it would take hours to clean up all of the blood,” Gabriel said from his seat across from Sam, “So for his next kill, he brings the rope.”
“NO!!!” A scream tore out of Dean’s throat, and he was charging out the door without even stopping to think. They couldn't take Sammy!
Time to up his game. He gave her another smile, leaned forward onto the counter, and slightly lowered his voice. “Listen, you’d be doing me a huge favor.” Another smile. “Please.”
“Are you asking me a direct question?” Dick asked, and Crowley nodded. “You promised you’d never do that.”
Once the food was served and everyone was sufficiently distracted, Castiel took his phone out under the table to send a text off to his best friend, Crowley. He wanted to check how the boys were doing on the Labor Day activities he'd planned out for them before he'd been forced to cancel. He hated the thought of everyone having fun without him, but what he hated even more was being completely out of contact with them.
“The Hotel la Comtesse,” Dean mumbled. The name sounded familiar. It took him a second, but then he remembered. “When we went to the apartment, the most recently dialed number on my phone was to this hotel. I’d stayed there under the name Dean Michael Cain, and the hotel manager told me I was dead.” Castiel looked at him funny, and Dean realized how that statement would sound ridiculous in any other situation. “Never mind.”
In the time that Dean’s stayed silent, Castiel’s face has pinched up with anxiety. Clearly he’s worried that he’s shared too much. Dean realizes he needs to open up and say something about himself to reciprocate. “I’m a male omega,” he says in a rush.
Dean stood there for a second internally cursing himself for being so stupid. Of course, Cas thought they're moving too quickly. They hadn’t even known each other a full twenty-four hours yet. He shook his head and moved to sit down at the desk. He might as well try to figure out more about his fractured identity while he waited for Cas to get out of the shower. Mostly he needed to keep himself busy so he didn't start thinking about Cas
Dean looked over towards the elevator where the rest of the team was holding the doors open while they waited for him. Castiel Novak was looking over with his head tilted a bit like he was confused. He probably knew they were talking about him. Dean turned back to Bobby. “Okay.” He nodded and headed over to the elevator.
Dean sighs. “Sammy, we’ve been over the CDs. It’s gotta be something else.” Dean taps his fingers agitatedly against his leg. “We have to find it or this girl is dead.”
Dean slumped back in his seat feeling like he’d been punched in the stomach. Maybe he just shouldn’t talk because he couldn't ever seem to say the right things. This year was going to be a nightmare.
Before he’s able to get that thought out, Sam interrupts him. “Whatever is going on between you two, I don’t want to get in the middle of it.” Castiel sighs. He’s about to turn around and leave when Sam continues, “I’m not sure what happened, but Dean is stubborn. Just give him some space.”
“No,” Balthazar squints at him in confusion. “I don’t think he’s back from that sale he said he was going to go to this morning.”
He knew he should get up and move to the couch. He knew every step he took towards Dean was a step towards his inevitable heartbreak, but at the moment he couldn't seem to find it in himself to care. He wanted Dean, all of Dean, for as long as he could have him. He got under the covers, and Dean smiled so wide it lit up his eyes. He got into bed behind him and pulled him close. Castiel sighed at the feeling of
He opens the door and takes in the worried expression on her face. “I had another nightmare,” Castiel explains. “I didn’t want to wake you.”
“No sir,” Zach replied hesitantly. Castiel could tell that he'd completely lost their respect, and he wondered how he hadn't noticed it sooner. He had his usual suspicions that went hand in hand with his inability to trust anyone apart from Meg, but he was still concerned that he hadn’t noticed their allegiance switching earlier. If it hadn’t been for Ruby, they probably would’ve been able to succeed in their plan to kidnap Dean and serve him up to Alistair. Castiel shuddered at the thought. With the new revelation that his captive was none other than Dean Winchester, the son of Alistair’s first pet project, it was no surprise why he’d become so obsessed with getting his hands on him. Even if they were able to take out Gordon and Zachariah, Castiel was still going to have to keep a watchful eye on Dean. Alistair wasn’t the kind of man to give up easily when he wanted something.
Castiel swallows down Dean’s dick to the root, and this time he can’t help the moan that comes out of him. The sight of an Alpha sucking off an omega is virtually unheard of, and it may be the hottest thing Dean’s ever seen. “Fuck, Cas,” he groans in his real voice. Cas’s bobbing stops momentarily when he moans, sending vibrations that Dean feels all the way in his toes. He’d forgotten that Cas hasn’t heard his real voice yet. “Fuck me, Cas,” he grunts. “I need you to fuck me.” He’s felt slick leaking out of him almost since he stepped in the door, so he knows he’s ready. He pulls his knees up to his chest, exposing his glistening hole.
Sam looked at him expectantly, and Dean’s face heated up realizing he was about to be caught in his lie about hanging out with Benny. “I’m sure Castiel wouldn’t want me to come,” he tried to say diplomatically.
Even though Dean had no appetite, he still got in line at the counter to grab some food. He used his time in line to scout out the available options for where he should sit. It was only his first day, but he’d already figured out that where he chose to sit today would probably have lasting consequences.
“Because he knew if he was caught, he’d do at least twenty years in prison,” Castiel says, putting his hands down on the desk in front of him. He feels a bit more in control of himself at the moment now that they know this isn’t connected to Gadreel anymore. Well besides the fact that the bomber liked his design and decided to replicate it.
He knows he doesn’t really have a choice. It’s not a question, it’s yet another order. “Yes, Mrs. Rolston.” He follows her outside to the garden where she keeps the roses. Her other plants are in the greenhouse to the side of the driveway.
This particular bridge was in the raised position. It looked like a triangle with both halves of the bridge raised up at an angle and meeting at a point in the middle. Underneath the middle part of the bridge it looked like an old ship had crashed into it and gotten stuck. Blue explained that there were usually raiders camped out at that ship so that they could exact a toll on anyone who tried to cross over to the other side.
He’d met Meg a few months after leaving Alistair’s group. When Alistair killed Mary, Castiel took off on his own, but it was hard to survive in the Wasteland alone. The landscape was unforgiving and so were the other people trying to survive. After years of fighting, Castiel ended up turning into somewhat of a killing machine. That was how he’d been able to single-handedly take on the hoard of ghouls who’d attacked Meg. She knew about the darkness inside of him, and she knew the reason for it. She was there for him when he started working on putting himself back together, just like he was there for her when she struggled to get clean.
Blue looked a bit nervous at that and glanced quickly over to Dean. “He’s not here to confront me about some recruits fighting over rations. He wants him.” Now it was Dean’s turn to look scared. “I have to go before he gets here. Stay and watch him.” Meg nodded. Blue quickly grabbed his coat and pistol and ran out of the door, locking it behind him.
Dean strides over to the kitchen angrily. He’s not sure if Alfie thinks he’s blind, but he’s not. He’d seen the eighteen year old grab a bottle of bourbon from the display in the dining room and try to sneak into the kitchen. There are agents all over the place! Dean isn’t sure why Alfie thought he’d be able to get away with it.
Castiel looks down at Dean who tries to muster a smile when they make eye contact, but it looks more like a grimace. “Okay.” Sam gives him a small pat on the shoulder and then heads out to the driveway to wait for his friend to pick him up for the night. “Dean, what do you need me to do?” He asks.
“I’m not,” Sam says hastily. “I’m just glad you two seem to be getting along a bit better than you were when he first showed up.”
“See this is the problem with having girls at the party. If it was just boys you wouldn’t care. You’d be dancing already,” Benny says.
“He said I could have time to get us settled in here before I start.” John started rifling through the cupboards and refrigerator looking for his stash of alcohol.
If a few days ended up turning into one week, Dean didn't seem to mind. Castiel slept on the couch and spent the days working on his resume and applying for various jobs. Dean spent the days locked in his office working, but he hadn’t told Castiel what he did for a living. Or pretty much anything else, to be honest. Every time he asked Dean something, he dodged it. He’d discovered Dean was very good at dodging questions. It probably had something to do with the fact that every time Castiel tried to ask, he ended up finding himself pinned to some surface by Dean’s roaming hands and distracted by his sinful mouth.
He goes through the warm-up Coach Singer is running them through mindlessly. He’s been kicking a soccer ball around from around the same time he’d learned how to run. On the field is where he fits in, and it’s the first time since moving here that he’s actually felt at home.
It was the girl who’d lost her hand. Her name was Claire. He’d been at the Purgatory Training Center for two full weeks now and every night without fail, Claire woke them up with her crying. She was one of the younger omegas in their group—couldn’t be more than fifteen. After the traumatic start to her training, she’d been struggling to cope.
Castiel feels a pit forming in his stomach as he watches Dean go to follow his father and brother. He knows his parents are going to have questions for him about what just happened, and he has no idea what he’s going to say. He can’t betray Dean’s confidence and tell them that John has an alcohol problem. He can’t do that if he ever hopes to fix things between the two of them. It was clear during the dinner that Dean is angry with him about something. He wonders if Balthazar and Gabriel talked to him and convinced him that Castiel had broken their trust. Or maybe Dean remembered all the shit Castiel had put him through earlier in the year and decided he didn’t actually forgive him.
After that big explosion it seemed to be finally over, but Dean stayed still on the ground as his breathing slowly returned to normal. Charlie came over to him and the two of them held onto each other, crying as it sank in just how close to death they'd both come.
Castiel’s mouth drops open as he wracks his brain trying to figure out what is going on. He may have betrayed them in the past, but he’s really been working to turn over a new leaf recently. He’s been trying to leave his bullying self in the past. He has no idea what they could possibly be mad at him about. “How am I the Brutus?” He asks. “You’re the ones who joined Crowley’s army.”
“It’s done, cher,” Benny chuckled. “Okay moving on!” He launched into a hilarious story about a girl named Andrea he’d been trying to ask out on a date. Dean couldn't stop smiling throughout the rest of their lunch period. He looked up a couple times to see that Castiel was staring at him from across the room again.
Dean let out an impressed whistle and turned to face Cas who looked horrified. “I’m guessing Past Me didn’t show you this.”
They all start laughing hysterically, and Dean barely hears the actor ask “Who is this? How did you get my number??” Balthazar grabs the phone back from Cas and hangs up, blushing fiercely.
Castiel wakes up abruptly from yet another nightmare. He’s had one every night since the bombing case ended. For the most part, he’s been able to enjoy his three day weekend home with Amelia, but he’s barely gotten any sleep because of the constant nightmares. He takes a few deep breaths to slow down his racing heartbeat. Once he’s calmed slightly, he gets out of bed as quietly as he can so he won’t disturb his wife. He’s drenched in cold sweat so he tiptoes over to the bathroom to splash some water on his face and change into another pair of sleep clothes. He groans when he sees that it’s three in the morning. That means he needs to try and get back to sleep even though he doesn’t want to. He has to be back at the BAU at nine. The three day weekend was nice, but it’s over now. They have another case to solve.
Dean stands in the Rolstons’ living room with his eyes focused on nothing, and he prays. He can’t remember the last time he prayed. Maybe he never has. Then again they say prayer is the last hope of a desperate man, and he truly is desperate right now.
Castiel reaches up to turn the light on, and he can see panic on Dean’s face that probably mirrors his own. He gets up and then holds out a hand to help Dean up. He doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say. He catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and curses when he sees his messed up hair and puffy lips. Everyone is going to know they kissed!
Benny lowers his voice to a whisper. “She’s being corrected right now, but then she’ll receive a new posting.” Dean’s stomach turns at the idea of what her being ‘corrected’ might entail, but at least that means she’s still alive. “The beta she was with was executed.” Dean can see un-shed tears in Benny’s eyes. He wonders if they knew each other.
“I’ll be alright,” Blue responded. “I’m feeling a bit more like myself already. I am very tired though.” As if to prove his point, he yawned and closed his eyes again.
Dean put his credit card on the counter while he checked his phone. “Is Becky sick?” He asked. Becky was the girl who usually worked here whenever he and Charlie came by. She was a bit enthusiastic, but he’d actually grown fond of her over time.
“Of course I have! Well, I’ll leave you alone to your private trail.” She put the cap back on her water bottle and got back up on her horse.
. When he brought him back down on top of him, Cas immediately leaned forward and captured his lips in a searing kiss.
Gabriel tries to grab Castiel’s arm, but he pulls away out of reach. Gabe raises his eyebrows fractionally. “Are you sure you should be the one to go to the prison?” He asks the question innocently, but Castiel knows exactly what he’s leaving unsaid.
He can see that Dean is blushing slightly after Castiel pulls away from the hug. Thankfully they’re interrupted from any potential awkward moments by the sound of knocking on the door.
“Not while you’re with me,” Alistair says, reaching across the table to gently lift Dean’s chin up. Dean forces his face into a grateful smile, and the Commander leans back and pours himself a bit more rum. He holds the glass out towards Dean, but Dean shakes his head. He’s already pretty tipsy as it is.
“Got caught stealing,” Dean says. “We didn’t have any money, and my dad…” He trails off. “I stole some peanut butter and bread so I could make sure my little brother had something to eat.”
He can see Dean look between the two of them a couple times before he says, “We should keep wrapping. The gift exchange is in five minutes.”
is what you want, cher?” Benny chuckled, and Dean rolled his eyes. He never should’ve opened his mouth about Castiel to Benny. Of course his friend wouldn’t understand. Yes, his neighbor was insanely attractive, and Dean would do just about anything to get his hands under those tight vests he always wore, but that was different from having a crush on the guy. “Seriously, Dean,” Benny continued. “The quiz didn’t say this, but you can’t expect someone else to make you happy. Happiness comes from within.”
Dean wasn’t sure if he believed any of that. He'd seen earlier model synths before, and they just looked like silver robots shaped like humans. He didn’t believe that people had created synths that looked and acted just like humans. He was also not sure he even believed in the existence of this “Institute” that supposedly kidnapped people to turn them into synths. As far as he knew, nobody had ever been inside the Institute or seen it with their own eyes. It was the Wasteland’s Boogie Man.
“I’ve got it,” Castiel exclaimed. “Loser has to wear my old snow outfit to school for a week. That includes goggles, ski mask, gloves, and hat.”
He tries to laugh along, but something bigger than butterflies seems to be caught behind his ribs. “Well if you don’t have any changes to the terms, I think we’re good to go,” he tries to get them back on task.
Castiel sighs and stops pacing. It’s time to rip the band-aid off and get this over with. He knocks on the door. After a few seconds, Lisa opens it. She has a smile on her face, but it immediately falls when she sees that it’s him. He can’t blame her.
Benny shook his head. “None taken.” He knew Dean was the best agent they had. That was just a fact. “Does the agency know about his car? Plates or anything?”
The phone on the center of the conference room table rings then, distracting everyone from Sam’s awkward moment. Gabriel hits speaker. “Milton,” he answers simply.
Charlie just hoped that Benny would be able to take care of the Lucifer situation quickly before he was able to speak out about what happened to him. Lucifer had to die, and they could not fuck up this mission again. They were in enough shit already.
Dean laughed, and it might've been the best sound Castiel had ever heard. It was even better than the noises he'd made while they were kissing. “So do I, but we should wait until we sober up.”
“I don’t see him,” the officer said into his radio. His voice was way too close to them, and it made the omega jump. After another panic-inducing moment, the man finally walked away. The omega waited until he couldn’t hear his footsteps anymore to start running again. That little break gave him enough rest to start back up again.
“Lisa, I need to clear something up,” he says quickly. She holds the door open, but doesn’t move to let him come inside. She just raises her eyebrows to show she’s waiting for him to continue. “I lied to you about Dean. He didn’t cancel on you because he was with another girl. He really does like you.”
She stands up. “I have something I need to discuss with you.” He maintains eye contact with her to show he’s listening. “In private.”
He tugged lightly on Cas’s hair to see if he could get him to make another one of those sounds, but it had the opposite effect. Cas pulled back from the kiss, his lips puffy and his eyes wide. “I-I’m sorry,” he stuttered. “Do you mind if I go use the bathroom?” Dean was caught off guard by the question. It had seemed like they were both on the same page, but maybe he'd moved too quickly. “Maybe take a shower?”
Okay, so Castiel did look kind of pathetic sitting by himself, but then again Dean was the one who had been ignored in the hallways, banished from sleepovers, and had food dumped all over him. When he thought about it like that, he didn't feel like such a horrible person. He was the victim in this, so that meant he could retaliate in whatever way he wanted… didn’t it?
Dean smiles down at the pup and gently rocks her in his arms. This may be the first time he’s been genuinely happy since getting out of Purgatory. It might be his omega instincts, but whenever he holds a pup in his arms it just feels so right. He can feel Mistress Abbadon watching him, but he doesn’t acknowledge her. It seems like some sort of bond might be forming between the two of them now, and Dean isn’t sure how he feels about that.
Abbadon pauses with her fork raised to her mouth and stares at him for a few seconds. “Make the appointment,” she says.
Benny gave him a look but didn’t say anything. Castiel was glad he brought Benny into his crew, because he did his job without bitching or asking too many questions. Those were two traits that most raiders didn't possess. Castiel wiped his hand across his face and told Benny that he could go get some sleep for the night and report back in the morning. He waited for Benny to leave before looking towards the bedroom door which was still closed. He really didn’t have the energy to deal with Dean at the moment, but he also didn’t want to spend the night trying to sleep in a chair.
Sterile. That’s a forbidden word. Male Alphas can’t be sterile in this new regime. There are only omegas who are fruitful and female Alphas or betas who are barren.
Castiel frowned when he got the message. It sounded like Crowley didn't want to talk to him, but then again it was hard to read into anything via text. His heart started beating quickly as he pictured his three friends in the store laughing at Gabe’s lack of taste in colognes.
It’s pretty warm out for late October, but that’s a good thing because otherwise wearing a costume without a shirt all night would be miserable. Abbadon rushes past him holding a box of black candles and says, “Everyone is going to be talking about this party for the next five years at least!” Castiel’s heart feels so full of pride that it might burst.
The man woke up feeling like his back was on fire. If it wasn’t for the pain, he would’ve assumed he was dead. In some ways he felt dead, but he wouldn’t be in this much pain if he was dead, right? Unless he'd ended up in hell somehow. He opened his eyes and took in his surroundings quickly. There went that theory. He definitely wasn't in hell. He was lying on his stomach in what appeared to be some sort of office. He was on top of a hard surface, probably a desk, and there were some books and papers that looked like they'd been shoved onto the floor to make room for him. The entire room seemed to be rocking from side to side, so either he was experiencing vertigo or he was on a ship.
Cas walked them, still hand-in-hand, to the far end of the garage that was mostly empty except for an old black muscle car. Dean’s interest was piqued. Even though he had no memory of this car, he felt something inside of him light up at the sight of it. Maybe his memories were still buried deep down inside of him, but he just couldn’t access them.
“She had sexual urges that led her to do unnatural things, though I’m sure to her it felt like love. Usually in these cases the punishment is death, but since she’s an omega we decided to offer her another chance.”
“Are you really doing the Halloween party?” Luke asked. He couldn’t care less about a stupid pumpkin.
“He told me when I interrogated him earlier that given the chance to push that button, he had no choice,” Castiel explains. “He said it was an emotional release he couldn’t resist. I just took his word for it.”
Castiel didn’t respond, he just shrugged and walked back to the car to drive back to the field office. Well, that was entirely pointless. They could’ve done all of this from the warmth of the office instead of wasting time to drive all the way out here. Dean sighed and got back into the car.
He opened the doors and inside was a maze of steel walkways and old conveyor belts. This must’ve been the main part of the factory back when it was in working order. He stepped inside, trying his best to appear like he belonged there. Other raiders were milling around, but nobody seemed to pay any attention to him as he walked past. He spent a good bit of time exploring the various walkways, trying to see if any of them led someplace interesting. The only stairway he avoided was the one that went up to the command center. He could tell that was what it was because there were turrets and guards blocking the entrance. Blue might've been up there with the other captains, and he didn’t want to run into him.
was Dean Michael Cain, so whoever came to get his things from the hotel and told the staff that bullshit story about him dying in a car crash was in on whatever was going on. Not only that, they were faking his death. Which meant whoever was doing this was also trying to hunt and kill
A light tap on the door of the telephone booth made him jump. He looked up and saw Cas standing outside with a sheepish expression on his face. He must’ve chickened out. At least he was alright. They could figure out another way to get the information they needed—preferably a way that kept Cas out of the line of fire.
Balthazar rejoins them holding a couple solid color cashmere sweaters. They look a bit more understated than his usual outfits, but comfy nonetheless. “Castiel tried to pay with his student I.D., but don’t worry, I’ll pay for it,” Gabriel says, and Balthazar immediately gives him a hug.
Balthazar and Luke both run their hands through their blond hair simultaneously while Gabe and Marv take huge bites out of the candy bars Crowley had his driver set out for them. Dean is struck by how similar Zar and Luke are. They have the exact same haircut, and they’re both flirty and sassy. Gabe and Marv both have crude senses of humor and love eating. For a second, Dean wonders if Crowley had purposely tried to recreate Castiel’s B.L.U. group. Maybe Castiel was right in calling him a wannabe. Dean listens as Marv and Gabe start gushing about one of the cute seniors at the girl school, and he shakes his head. Not even Crowley is that psychotic.
Dean may have slipped up one night and admitted to Benny in a game of Truth or Dare that he’d fantasized a couple times about kissing a certain blue-eyed boy, but that didn't mean he had feelings. Castiel was hot. Anybody with eyes could see that.
Castiel threw back his third consecutive shot of tequila and winced as the liquid burned down his throat. He was usually not much of a drinker, but he figured he had the perfect reason to make tonight an exception. He came out as gay to his family a month ago. He’d thought they would be supportive of him—after all, it was a new millennium—but he’d been sadly mistaken. His parents kicked him out of the house without so much as a second thought. At 29 years old, he was probably the oldest person alive to just now come out about his sexuality, but he hadn't exactly had the most normal upbringing. His parents were heavily involved in the political scene in Russia, and he’d tried his best to avoid that. He rejected his trust fund and his family legacy and decided to forge his own path. His brother Gabriel, the only family member he considered himself close with, did the same thing.
“I can’t,” Gabriel grabs a granola bar out of the mini fridge. “My dad is taking me and my brother to our Hampton house for a long weekend.”
Dean hops down from the ladder now that he’s finished and walks over to where he put his water bottle. “Have you heard back from Missouri yet?” he asks.
I've been having a pretty hard time recently, but writing and reading fanfic provides a good temporary escape. Huge thanks to everyone who has been reading and commenting on my fics! Every time I see that I've gotten a new comment I smile. Hope you're enjoying the story, and I'll try to update again soon
“I don’t know what is going on with Castiel and Dean,” Chuck said sadly. “I figured they’d be friends by now.” Castiel peeked around the door to see Dean’s reaction, but he noticed that he and Sam were both gone.
Castiel laughed, but Dean could tell it was a reaction to the stressful situation. “You’re just saying that cause you hate it.”
He hears Mrs. Rolston quietly leave the loft, closing the door behind her. Now that she’s gone, Castiel bends down and places a few gentle kisses on the back of Ofal’s neck. He groans when he feels another load pump into the omega.
He walks over to his locker, which just happens to be next to Crowley’s locker. Crowley jumps when Castiel comes to stand next to him making it clear that he has been trying to avoid him.
“So, when are you going to start training me up for the Combat Zone?” Dean asked with his mouth full.
“Of course, I did,” Dean laughed, leaning over to grab a piece of bacon. He didn't break eye contact with Castiel as he took a bite and chewed thoughtfully. Castiel felt like he might spontaneously combust at any moment. How was everything Dean did sexy? Castiel picked up a piece of bacon and mimicked him. It looked like Dean’s eyes darkened slightly, but before he could tell for sure, the green-eyed man looked away and coughed into his hand. Castiel finished that piece of bacon and took a sip of the coffee. It was made just the way he liked it.
“We don’t want to get bogged down in the details,” Gabriel reminded them. “We have enough to start narrowing down the list of suspects.”
“You’re going to come with me to look at the cookies,” she all but growls, forcibly pulling him away from Jo. Dean understands on some level why she feels so threatened, but it is a bit ridiculous. He walks with her towards the other end of the market, still thinking about what Jo had said. He has no idea who The Letters are or how to find them, but he’ll have to figure out some other way to talk to Jo when he’s not with his shopping partner. He’s interrupted from his thoughts by the sound of Guardians yelling at someone. When he turns towards the noise, he sees Jo sprinting towards one of the idling cars that the drivers were using to drop wives off.
Dean hadn't ever been this attracted to anyone before, which was unfortunate since so far Castiel seemed like he was a total dick. He was just now starting to come to terms with his newly found bisexuality so he congratulated himself on being able to realize he found Castiel attractive without having an internal freak-out. Sam was the only one who knew about it, which was mostly because Sam stumbled on some of Dean’s experimental gay porn while snooping in his room one day.
Crowley, Balthazar, and Gabriel didn't even glance at him as they headed into the kitchen. Castiel smirked at him and whispered, “Nice jammies,” quietly so his mother couldn't overhear him. Then he followed the rest of them into the kitchen.
“Can’t right now, baby.” He kissed the side of his cheek, and Cas groaned in impatience. “One day, I’m going to fuck you so good you won’t be able to sit down.” Dean grazed his teeth along the bolt of Cas’s jaw and then started to suck a mark into the delicate skin of his throat.
“Good morning, Dean,” Castiel says. He’s not smiling, but Dean does notice a slight upturn in his mouth. At first when Castiel joined the team Dean thought he was pretty robotic. It’s only been about a week, but he’s already starting to pick up on the tiny nuances in Castiel’s facial expressions. It’s something a normal person probably wouldn’t notice, but he’s trained to notice nonverbal expressions and subtle behavioral cues.
After he did that, he tried to figure out how he was going to get Blue down to the river. Getting him into the river would be relatively easy since it was downhill, but pulling him back up the hill when he was soaking wet would be another issue. Blue wasn’t a small guy, and Dean was strong, but he was also much smaller than Blue was. This could be tricky, but he’d deal with that after he brought down his fever. Dean grabbed Blue from under his armpits and began to slowly pull him down the hill. After a lot of grunting and groaning, he managed to pull him fully into the river. Dean stood behind him to keep his head from going under.
“Yeah.” Dean began pacing while he tried to think. “That’s what led me to the bank where I found all of the fake passports before I ran into you at the embassy.” He stopped pacing suddenly. “This guy said he was my coworker. He had the same implant in his hip. They were able to figure out who you were and where we were going in a matter of hours. With the amount of technology these guys have, there has to be a reason... why implant a bank number in our hips?”
“This is only going to work if you relax, babe,” Dean said, gently rubbing his hands against his ass. Castiel knew the endearment probably just slipped out of his mouth in the heat of the moment, but he couldn't help the feeling of butterflies that erupted inside of him. He tried to take a few deep breaths to relax himself. “That’s good, Cas,” Dean praised, and then he jumped at the first touch of Dean’s tongue to his entrance. “Is this okay?”
“The woman at the front desk smiled at me, and I thought why do I need to do all of this sneaking around if I could just talk to her?”
Before Castiel had a chance to release Gordon, he heard a gunshot, and Zachariah dropped. Garth’s timing was impeccable, and his aim was true. Gordon’s eyes widened, and Castiel used that moment to bash his head against the wall. Gordon grunted in pain, but he didn’t black out. He grabbed Gordon by the straps of his armor and threw him onto the ground. Then he pulled out his pistol and pointed it at Gordon’s face. Meg ran over to Zachariah’s body to make sure he was dead. She kicked his gun away and checked for a pulse. After a minute or so, she nodded at Castiel. One down, one to go.
Dean pulled the car into the parking garage and parked it on the bottom floor. After it was parked, they both took a few moments to catch their breaths. He could feel Cas’s eyes looking at him like he was some sort of freak, and Dean guessed he must be. Normal people didn't do shit like that, right?
“Definitely the second option,” Castiel replied with a small smile. Was this man actually flirting with him? It seemed like he was. He had no idea why, because this man was the single most attractive person he’d ever seen, and Castiel was just… Castiel.
Dean looks over and sees his dad motioning that it’s time for them to leave. He says goodbye to his friends, who all return his goodbye except for Cas who just gives him a half-hearted wave. What’s gotten into him? He heads over to his dad and brother, figuring that he can talk to Cas about whatever’s bugging him later. He isn’t going to let this ruin his good night.
“Now we can start putting this bad boy back together.” Dean opens up the box and starts taking out the many fragments that have each been individually packaged in clear evidence bags.
His worries were unnecessary though. Anna was waiting for him at the beginning of the trail and waved when he came around the corner. “Hey, I wasn’t sure you’d be here,” he lied.
?  The older man leaned in slowly, giving Dean every opportunity to stop him. What he didn’t know was that Dean had absolutely no desire stop him. He’d been daydreaming about this for days now. When their lips touched, he immediately leaned into it. It was just as good as the dream, except this time it was real.
Castiel continues to look at him with an indecipherable expression on his face. He taps the table gently with his hand. “You need to be careful,” he says seriously.
“That’s too bad for his girlfriend,” Dean sighs. When Matt was kidnapped, he’d been with her. Whoever took him put a bullet in his girlfriend’s head. That makes it clear that whoever they’re dealing with specifically targeted Matt Pike, most likely for his connections to his Senator father.
“Because I don’t know how long I’m going to need to make them last,” Dean explained. “If I have to be on the run for a while, I can’t risk running out. I don’t know where to get more, and the headaches must’ve been withdrawals. I’ll try to only take them when the withdrawals become unbearable.”
Dean splashed some water on his face and tried to control himself. This was fine. Everything was fine.
Dean looked at the food in front of him before he took another bite. He hoped the guilt didn’t show on his face because that was his original plan. Now he wasn't so sure. He hadn’t been let out of this room since he got here last night, and even though he was incredibly stealthy, he didn’t think it’d be possible for him to get out of the factory undetected.
Sam shoots a confused look around the room at the mention of his name, but then goes back to trying to track the cell phone. Castiel looks over at Dean. He’s leaning back in his chair with a big smile on his face. This is exactly what he was hoping for. The unsub continues her long rant, “Beautiful Jo was promoted too soon. She doesn’t have what it takes to make it in the BAU boys club.” Castiel looks over at Jo. She’s still holding Larry and Alfie back, but he can tell by the expression on her face that she’s pissed. “I know all about you, and you don’t threaten me!” The unsub hangs up the phone.
“Of course I have to go!” John exclaims. “Plus I’d like to get a look at this girl, Lisa, Sammy says you’ve been dating.” Dean turns lightning-fast to glare at Sam who is shaking his head with wide eyes.
A couple was making out in the elevator on Dr. Sexy M.D. and Castiel realized that the entire time he’d been watching, he’d been deep in his thoughts. Dean looked over at him, and he met his gaze. When those green eyes caught him, he couldn't look away. He’d never look away if that was an option.
“We’re being set up,” Kevin says quietly. “There’s no other reason why he’d tell us to wait in the bathroom. This is a set up for a bad prank.”
“I’m not alone,” Dean explained. “I was traveling with someone, but he got bit by a feral ghoul. He’s very sick, but he told me there’s a cure in Diamond City.”
fault? “But what you’re doing right now is childish, Cas. Ignoring my messages, pretending you don’t see me in the hallways, leaving me out of your plans to wear the costumes today at school.” Castiel looks down at his feet because he knows Dean is right. “I know things were never great between us, but I was starting to feel like we could maybe be friends. I don’t want a stupid kiss to get in the way of that. I don’t want to have to go back to hating you.”
Balthazar sashays out of the dressing room in one of the new sweaters. It fits him perfectly, but Castiel is too upset to compliment him. “Hey, Zar, do you have a water bottle in your backpack? I’m thirsty,” he says, shooting a glare towards Gabriel daring him to say anything. Gabriel stays quiet, looking down at his shoes. Balthazar hands his backpack over to Castiel, and he immediately starts rifling through it.
“Move over,” Castiel said from somewhere on his left. Dean could barely see him through the darkness. “Oh my god, this is brutal,” He groaned and plopped down next to him in the dirt.
“It wouldn’t just be the three of us,” Sam says. “I figured we could take the whole team. Jo is obviously going to be there already. I was thinking you could ask Charlie, and I’ll ask Jessica.”
Sam appeared at the opposite end of the hallway then. He was probably coming back to find Dean. When he saw the look of fear on Dean’s face, he could tell immediately that something wasn’t right. The omega looked up, saw the two of them standing there, and then tried to run. Sam was able to catch her and the commotion brought the police officers and nurses who had been searching for the pup this whole time. Dean could hear Krissy crying as they struggled to get her away from the omega. Once they managed to grab on to her they immediately handed her back to Dean. He held her against him tightly as Sam hugged the two of them together. Dean watched as the police officers dragged away the screaming omega and realized that easily could’ve been him if something had happened to Krissy. He already couldn’t imagine his life without her.
Dean held up the cattle prod he’d taken off of Aunt Hester and showed it to her in a silent threat. “Stay quiet and take your clothes off,” he ordered, using his real voice.
“Of course you would’ve known all of this if any of you had bothered to ask us how our interview went,” Crowley picks a piece of lint off of his suit jacket. Nobody asks Crowley for a single detail, not even Dean. Castiel is proud of his friends. There’s no reason to give him the satisfaction. “Anyways, Brady,” Crowley says again. “Can I have one of those CDs to give Ronald?”
Dean looked at the empty ward in horror. He’d heard the rumors of pups and omegas dying in childbirth or omegas miscarrying before they could reach full term, but seeing it first hand was something different entirely. This was seriously bad!
“We’re going to have Abbadon to plan it. She’s the best party-planner around, and we only have a week until Halloween,” Castiel said.
Castiel thinks for a second, and it comes to him. He doesn’t want to do this, but they’re all out of options. He clicks on his earpiece again. “Gabe, I need you to come with me to the prison. We have to make a deal with Gadreel.”
“No, why would I be?” He asked sarcastically. “Why would I be upset that my best friend believes my brother is a traitor?” He whispered the last part so nobody would overhear him.
When Dean comes to alertness again, he’s in the back seat of the Range Rover. Castiel is driving them back to the Rolston’s house, and Dean sees him glancing back at him through the rear-view mirror with concern etched all over his face. Dean barely has time to wonder what he must look like before he slips back under.
When she doesn’t answer after a few moments, he risks a glance up to meet her eyes. She looks confused. Then her face hardens. “No, that’s not why you did it, Castiel,” she says harshly. “You like Dean.” Castiel gasps, but she continues, “I’ve been crushing on him for weeks now, and wherever he is, you are. I’ve seen the way you look at him.”
“Great. I guess I’ll just freeze to death!” Mr. Novak yelled before turning around to storm off. He met Dean’s gaze for a second, and Dean was surprised to see that this man had the bluest eyes he’d ever seen. The glare on his face turned quickly to shock and then embarrassment before he ran outside.
The drive back to the house with Castiel and Alfie is a pretty awkward affair. Dean is driving and apparently he is also the only one trying to alleviate the awkward silence in the car. Novak is a weird guy by any measure, but he is surprised by how much the other agent has closed off.
The moment is ruined when one of the wives comes over and snatches the pup away from him. As she walks back to the center of the room where the rest of the wives are, Dean can hear her say quietly, “Let’s get you away from there.” He tries his best not to roll his eyes.
He steps into her line of sight and catches her eye. Her hair is wet from her sweat, and her face is red and pinched up in pain. “You’re doing great,” he says, reaching out to put his hand on her rounded belly. She turns to look at him, and her eyes light up like they always do when she sees him. He doesn’t deserve that look.
“What?” Charlie asked in shock. She knew about his rape last month. She was actually the one who drove him to the hospital. Of course, the authorities didn’t consider it rape. As an omega he was probably asking for it by walking home alone at night and not covering up his enticing smell. When Charlie saw his worried expression, she quickly leaned in for a hug. “It’s going to be okay. Do you need me to take you to the omega center?”
Castiel smiled when Dean handed him the second stack of cash, but it didn't reach his eyes. “Spasibo,” he said in Russian.
“I had to listen to dozens of angry parents complain about the message we’re sending at this school and this led to us having to hold an emergency board meeting. Eventually we came to a decision.”
to host this with Dean? Or that I’d ever pick him over you?” Castiel asks in disbelief, but Crowley shrugs again. “We’ve been friends since we were in diapers. You will always come first. Always.”
He takes a few minutes to try and get his breathing under control. When he gets to the gazebo, Castiel opens the door looking very nervous himself. This can’t be good.
“Follow me,” Gabriel says seriously. That probably means this is a bad one. Not like they ever work on any good cases, but they are varying degrees of bad.
Dean got an idea. “What if I tell you something personal about myself and then you tell me something personal about you?” Maybe if he opened himself up more, Blue would be encouraged to open up too.
Castiel immediately stiffened, and he could feel Dean watching him to try and gauge his reaction. He was so not ready to talk about Gabriel. He wasn't even ready to tell Dean his real name yet for crying out loud. He was such a hypocrite. He faulted Dean for being too immature to talk about his feelings, and yet he couldn’t tell him the most basic things about himself even after the kid saved his life. Castiel’s trust issues had trust issues.
Castiel quickly ducks into his office to answer his personal cellphone. The only person who should be calling him would be Amelia, but he’d just seen her no more than an hour ago. It would be weird for her to call him so soon.
“So, what exactly goes on at a boy/girl party?” Gabriel asked as they headed back to the wagon without pumpkins of their own.
Not every table seemed as exclusive as Castiel’s, but that also made them less appealing. Dean had always liked a challenge. Sammy told him that was one of his weaknesses. He tended to make things more difficult than they needed to be. Case in point, he should've just pick any table and made some friends who wouldn't look at him like he was a piece of gum on their shoe.
“Alright, Gadreel, we’re prepared to make you a deal,” Gabriel starts. The three of them are sitting around the table in the interrogation room, and they’re joined by Gadreel’s lawyer. “We’re willing to transfer you to a medium security prison. You’re in maximum security right now.”
“Deannnn.” He pushed his hips back to try and get Dean’s fingers deeper inside of him, and Dean inhaled sharply. “I want you now.”
“You don’t ‘suck.’ I told you Dean, I was undefeated there for almost two years. I don’t expect you to best me. We’re just practicing.” Dean nodded, but Castiel could tell he was still discouraged. “Let me show you something.” He moved behind Dean and placed his hands on his hips to show him the correct stance. He felt Dean freeze when he initially touched him, but then he relaxed. Castiel realized this probably wasn’t the best idea, but he’d been longing to touch the boy constantly since the first night he'd held him. Maybe that made him a horrible person, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care when he could feel Dean’s back pressed against his chest. “You want to keep your hips squared like this.” He gave the hands on Dean’s hips a gentle squeeze. “And you want to keep your feet about shoulder width apart. It makes you a smaller target.” He didn't realize his voice had dropped down to a whisper until he felt Dean shiver against him.
Castiel makes sure to keep his face void of emotions, but inside he wants to throw up. He knows Gadreel is right. In hindsight, it’s obvious. How could he have made such a simple mistake?
The second period bell had just finished ringing, and the boys were first in line to grab coffees at the on-campus café. Crowley and Balthazar were busy making fun of people’s outfits as they walked past, but Castiel was too bored to participate this morning. He took a sip of his vanilla latte and willed his persistent headache to go away. A nerd who he thought was named Kevin approached him slowly. Castiel could see the other boys in his nerdy crew standing back watching them nervously.
Castiel had chosen tennis as his gym credit since he'd grown up playing it. The rest of the boys didn't really like tennis, but they always tried to pick whatever classes he was in so they could have classes together. Castiel always looked forward to his gym period. Whacking balls around always helped him let off a bit of steam. The past few days, Castiel had even been thinking about trying out for the tennis team since he’d heard a certain green-eyed junior was going to be trying out for the soccer team.
As he’s about to open the wrought iron gate to the driveway, three black Guardian vans speed past on the street. He wonders if they’re heading to clean up the mess at the market or if something else happened. He can’t help the image that comes into his head of Castiel driving one of those cars. Dean wants to believe he’s different than the rest of them. Maybe he’s doing what he has to do to survive the same way Dean is. Maybe he’s trying to dismantle the system from the inside.
that was on display right now, but it was basically impossible. He’d forgotten how ripped his companion was. It was lean muscle, but that almost made him more attractive.
His old neighborhood was situated at the edge of the city of Concord, Massachusetts. Maybe he’d be able to find some people there even though he couldn't see any signs of life. He grabbed the backpack that held the few items he’d collected so far: the medicine, the gun and ammo, and the cash he’d pulled from the vault technician’s desk, and he made his way towards the big bridge at the edge of the neighborhood that crossed over the river. There was more water flowing in the river than there had been in the smaller creek he’d crossed earlier, but it was still not nearly as full as it had been before he'd entered the vault.
Dean looked over at Cas and noticed that he seemed almost... angry. “Wait,” Dean chuckled, “Are you jealous?”
“Most of the people we catch are cowards,” Dean says. “They prey mostly on women and children because they’re easier to overpower physically. There’s nothing more satisfying then catching these dicks and knowing they’re going to get locked away.” Alfie wipes away a tear as it starts to fall. “Come on, he’s going to call back soon.”
“Well first of all, I need you to get that panicked look off of your face,” Dean says. “I’m fine.” Castiel rolls his eyes, but does try to take a couple deep breaths to calm himself down. He needs to be here for Dean right now. He can’t freak out. “Then I’m going to need a first aid kit and some ice.” Castiel nods and runs off quickly to do as he’s told. He can follow Dean’s instructions easily. It gives him something to do that doesn’t involve freaking out and accidentally tipping his parents off to what’s going on.
He ran down the bank towards the river, trying to move quickly, so he could spend as little time as possible out in direct contact with the storm. He could feel the static sizzling in the air around him, and he knew he was going to have to take a Rad-Away when he got back under the roof. He bent down to fill up the pot, and then ran back to the amphitheater, trying his best not to spill anything. When he got back under the roof, he breathed a sigh of relief. He could still feel the sizzling of the radiation against his skin, but it wasn't as direct as it was without any cover.
Benny watched as his friend’s signature smirk appeared on his face. “Just this,” Dean started, “When you have someone up against a wall, you shouldn’t stand in that position.” Now it was Cole’s turn to look confused. Dean continued, “It makes it really easy for me to do this.”
“Don’t tip her off, but we’re going to want to question Ofal as well.” Castiel breathes a sigh of relief. For a moment, he’d thought Azazel was talking about Ofal. The fact that the thought of Ofal being taken freaked him out that much is not good. He barely knows her, and she already has her hooks in him but good.
“Alright everyone, conference room,” Bobby orders. Sam picks up the pile of files on his desk and starts following Bobby and the others down the hallway. Dean quickly jogs to catch up to him and puts his arm around his brother’s shoulders. As they’re walking together down the hallway to the conference room, they pass by a few female agents from other branches of the FBI. All of them give Dean appraising looks and a couple even give him obvious winks.
He frowned at himself in the mirror. Another thing he’d learned about himself was that he knew an alarming number of different languages according to Garth. Apparently, most people only knew one or two languages at most. So far, Garth hadn't been able to come up with a language he couldn't at least say a few sentences in, much to the astonishment of the crew. “Est-ce que tu sais qui je suis?” He asked himself in French.
“That’s her real name,” Claire replies, looking down again. “That was my mother’s name, but she passed away a long time ago so I wanted to name my baby after her.”
“My parents are turning the barn into a home gym,” Castiel responds, sounding completely unimpressed.
“Only a week? Normally we train new recruits for at least a month before taking them out to the Combat Zone.”
“Yeah,” Jespersen says and then lowers his voice to a whisper. “If you’re a scrawny white guy in a prison like this…”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Crowley says quietly. “I know I’m far from blameless here. I really regret all of the things I said and did to you when you first got here. I know you probably won’t understand, but Castiel has this hold over us. He makes us feel really special and can convince us to do things we probably wouldn’t do on our own. I just hope you know that none of the bullying was our idea. It was always his, and we just went along with it. I know that doesn’t make it better, but I am sorry.”
“We’re ready?” Dean screeched. “Milton, are you okay with this?” He turned towards Gabriel. “We have a woman who has less than two days to live, an incomplete profile, and a unit chief on the verge of a nervous breakdown.”
The eastern light shines through the window as he waits in stillness for the morning bell to toll. He takes stock of his room as he often does because there’s nothing better to do. There's not much to look at, but he's grateful for it nonetheless. There's a window, a desk, a lamp, a chair, and of course, a bed. The window has pale curtains that do little to filter out the morning sunlight. It's also been sealed shut. He wishes for the hundredth time that he could open the window to let some fresh air into his musty room, but he's given up trying to open it. The Powers That Be don't want to take any chances of an omega running away. He thinks it's a bit silly. Why would an omega try to run away? There's nowhere to go.
“Guided by His howl,” Bela responds with a smirk. She probably finds it hilarious that he’s paired up with the annoying omega. “Did you see?”
He hears sirens coming closer to the house, but the Guardians don’t use sirens. They just come and take people quietly. He looks out the window and sees a red van. The birth-mobile. One of the omegas must be in labor.
“I’m going to keep working on getting into the kid’s laptop,” Dean says. Castiel volunteers to help, which is surprising. Dean figured he wouldn’t want anything to do with him after the way he’s been treating him this whole time. Maybe that means he accepted Dean’s earlier apology. After brainstorming for about thirty minutes, Dean decides they need help. He pulls out his cellphone to dial up the number for his favorite tech savvy coworker.
Dean is pacing back and forth around his room. He’s supposed to have his first real date with Lisa soon, and his stomach is tied up with knots. Not just because he’s about to officially start dating the hottest girl at Hancock, but also because he’d had a horrible fight with his father that morning.
“Does he have anything good on him?” A voice asked. Castiel felt a pair of hands roll him over onto his stomach and search around him.
“A wondrous day,” Aunt Naomi clapped her hands together enthusiastically. “Once a month on fertile days, the omega will present themselves for their Alpha. You will pose like a flower waiting to be seeded.” A silence filled the room as the omegas realized what she was implying.
To say that Dean had changed his life would've been an understatement. He came into it like a fucking wrecking ball, crashing into him hard and leaving a mess behind. Despite how angry he’d been at the time, Castiel couldn't find it in himself to resent Dean. The green-eyed man had broken his heart, but at the end of the day, Castiel only had himself to blame. Dean had warned him not to fall for him. It was his own fault he didn’t listen. Still, never in a million years would he have expected to see Dean at the American embassy in Zurich. What the hell was he doing here?
As they walked past the broken shells of old apartment complexes, Dean thought he heard something shuffling from inside one of the buildings. “Did you hear that?” He whispered to Blue.
They walk for a few moments in silence before Dean builds up the nerve to ask, “Has Ofmarv been transferred to a new posting so soon?”
At first Dean wants to dismiss him, but he really could use the help. “Please.” Castiel bends over to get a closer look at the wound, then he winces in sympathy. “It’s not as bad as it looks,” Dean says. It hurts, but he’s definitely had worse. Being shot is worse. Speaking of being shot, he wants to ask how Castiel’s arm is doing after being shot on his first case at the BAU. Or how his leg is healing after the incident in Chicago. He’s noticed that Castiel still walks with a bit of a limp though it probably wouldn’t be noticeable to the untrained eye. It’s only noticeable to Dean since he’s spent an embarrassing amount of time staring at his boss.
“I’ll be fine,” Dean said just as forcefully. The other boy might have caught him off-guard with that painful handshake, but Dean wasn’t about to let himself get pushed around by some stuck-up high school kid.
“She’s not your baby,” Dean whispered in shock. He wanted to dive forward and grab Krissy from the other omega, but he was worried about what she might do if he tried that.
He rereads his message three times before finally sending it. He really hopes she hadn’t actually lost her wings because he doesn’t have any to give her. His email pings almost immediately with a reply. Castiel takes a deep breath before opening it.
He walks up to the kid and grabs the glass away from him before he can take a sip. Alfie turns around to complain. “I know I’m underage, but do you think you could give me a pass just this one night? My brother is missing.”
Dean peeks a look around the curtain and can see that the auditorium is packed with their fellow students and a handful of parents. Now he understands why people are getting stage fright. As impressed as he is by the turnout, he only really cares about seeing one person. He searches the audience, looking for that silky black hair and bright smile, but he doesn’t see her. It’s not like he’d asked Lisa to come, but he was hoping she would.
“It happens sometimes with the weaker omegas,” Mistress Abbadon says quietly. “What you do… what we do together is so terrible, but we have to stay strong.” She takes a step closer to him. “That’s why I'm so grateful to have you.” She strokes his cheek gently. Dean isn’t sure what to respond to that, but he's saved from having to come up with something when baby Anael starts crying loudly from the other room. “I think Mrs. Abel might need some help. Tell Castiel that I’ll have the Abels’ driver take me home.” She walks down the hallway towards the sound of the crying and leaves him there alone.
Dean laughs, “Well they’ll be upset to find out that there’s only one girl I was looking forward to seeing tonight.” Lisa blushes again and smiles. Dean loves being the reason for that.
As he was walking past an apartment building, he heard a woman call out, “What the fuck was that?” and he paused mid-step. There were raiders in this building. He waited a second until he heard her mumble, “must be hearing shit,” before he started walking again, taking extra care to not step on anything that would make a sound.
Dean resists the urge to make a dirty joke. “There’s a cool dive bar called The Roadhouse that the team goes to sometimes to hang out. We were thinking tonight would be a good night since we’re just working on paperwork today. Would you like to join us?”
Blue nodded and laid the guns on the table. Then he began removing his various pieces of armor. Raider armor was designed to give a bit of protection while not being too bulky to prohibit movement. It was usually made out of scraps of leather and metal—basically anything that could be scavenged and pieced together. Blue then pulled off his own leather jacket and hung it over the edge of one of the chairs. He held Dean’s gaze while he slowly pulled off his undershirt. Dean tried not to stare, but he found it impossible. The first thing he noticed was some sort of writing on his ribs. He was confused for a moment about why he'd have writing on him, but then he was promptly distracted by Blue's bare torso. The man was lean, but muscular at the same time. There was a reserved sort of strength about him, and he wondered what it would feel like to be pinned down by those arms.
Dean shoots him a tiny smile. “Have a little faith, Cas.” Castiel doesn’t have time to be confused at the second use of that nickname because the phone starts to ring again. Dean answers it immediately.
“Sure, but I can’t promise I’ll like it,” Lisa smiles when Dean laughs. Cute and funny. He can deal with that.
“I don’t need any new clothes for the holidays,” Balthazar says. “My clothes from last year will work fine.”
“No, I need to see the body,” Dean explained. They needed to see it for their own eyes not just trust this guy that it was here.
Sam felt his stomach drop. Dean had definitely gone rogue then. He honestly couldn't believe it. Dean could get a little angry or reckless at times, but he’d never do something this stupid without a good reason. Unfortunately, Sam had no idea what that reason could be.
He retreats into his memories while he waits for the bell to toll. He remembers when he first got to this house, to his second Alpha.
“Thank you, Benny.” He didn't trust his ability to not get emotional, so he just nodded and stepped back into the night.
Dean dips his hands further under the back of Castiel’s pants and under his boxers too, grabbing a little feel of that fine ass he’s been trying to keep his eyes off of for weeks. Castiel gasps again, and Dean is already obsessed with all of the noises he’s making. Most of the time, Alphas try to act unfazed and completely in control, but it’s almost like Castiel wants him to take charge.
“You can ask me anything,” Naomi says seriously. She sits down on the edge of his bed to avoid messing up the comforter and stares at him patiently to show she’s listening.
“I didn’t think about it,” Dean looks back down at the ground. Maybe if he appears contrite, they’ll believe him.
“We figured Concord would be a good place to settle, but the raiders proved us wrong,” Rufus says. “You didn’t have any idea who we were, but you immediately came to help us anyways. That means a lot. I want you to take this.” Rufus hands him a tin can full of something. Castiel shakes it lightly and hears what sounds like metal clinking. Coins maybe? “It’s not much, but it’s what I’ve got.” Castiel opens up the can and sees what looks like a bunch of bottlecaps that come from beer bottles or soda bottles. The confusion must be clear on his face because Rufus chuckles and says, “Bottlecaps are what everyone uses around here for currency. In case you find yourself in need of buying something.”
“There’s no way to know for sure if France even still exists at this point,” Blue said. “I’m sure the various military groups still have a way to communicate across the ocean, but we can’t.” He sighed. “Anyways, the people who lived there used to speak French.”
Crowley continues, “Even when you started hanging out with us for the party planning and stuff like that, he still complained about you constantly. He said he wished you guys would move so he wouldn’t have to fake it anymore."
Castiel took a deep breath to prepare himself and then squeezed his eyes closed as Dean pressed two fingers into him this time. He already felt so full. How was Dean going to be able to fit his dick in him?
The two betas held onto Dean firmly by the wrists as they dragged him towards the table in the center of the room. He was back in the Purgatory Training Center. Of course, he wasn’t able to get out. How stupid he’d been to even try. Now the only option left to him was to beg for forgiveness.
“Yeah,” Dean replied from under his desk. He couldn't believe he was hiding from his neighbor and talking on a landline like a grandpa. John had confiscated his cell phone after he found out it was Mr. MacLeod’s. His stupid rule was that Dean wasn’t allowed to have a cellphone until he turned seventeen. When Dean had pointed out that he was going to turn seventeen in less than six months so he should be allowed to round up, it hadn’t gone over well to put it mildly. “I scored a five. Apparently that means I ‘nurture pessimism’,” Dean said.
“Back to bed!” One of the betas yelled, and the rest of the omegas immediately dropped back down onto their mattresses and pretended to go back to sleep.
“Wait,” Castiel commands. “Don’t tell anyone. Not yet. Let me think.” The other boys exchange looks but don’t say anything. “We need to stay still, crouching in the weeds until the time is right to pounce.”
“Hey, darling,” The new boy said in a posh English accent. He sat down on the row of seats opposite them. “Oh, who’s the new meat?” He gave Dean a once-over that made him slightly uncomfortable.
“Gabriel, Chicago sent Novak into a post traumatic meltdown. Do you really think he’s ready to work in the field on another bombing case?”
Gabriel heads off to go look at the staff list. Sam sits back down at the table to get ready for the next call, leaving Dean alone with Castiel. Agent Novak stares at him in that intense way he has, waiting to hear Dean’s plan for how to deal with the unsub. Dean clears his throat noisily. He doesn’t know how Castiel is able to make him feel so on edge and uncomfortable. He’s never had this problem with authority before, and now Castiel has only been here a week and Dean is having all sorts of problems.
After all of the raiders except for Benny left the room, Castiel closed the door behind them and locked it. He motioned for the kid to follow him and walked into the bedroom. He saw Benny move one of the chairs next to the door and sit down. It looked like he was going to take his guard duty seriously, which made Castiel relax slightly. He wanted to make sure the kid was safe while they went on their run.
Castiel takes a deep breath and marches over towards Crowley. He can feel Dale Carnegie’s words echoing around in the back of his brain, but he’s so angry he feels like steam must be shooting out of his ears. He stands over his ex-best-friend and puts his hands on his hips. “Will you please get out of my house, you pathetic wannabe, or the only thing you’re going to wanna be from now on is DEAD!” Everyone turns their heads towards Crowley to see how he’ll react to Castiel’s threat. “NOW!” He screams.
