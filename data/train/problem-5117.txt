." He growled, words laced with venom. He got up from his place at his computer desk, making his way towards the lab door. "JARVIS, send all of that classified data to my phone. I'm going to have a word with the cyclops."
"What have you done to me, Rogers?" He whispered to himself. He dropped the screwdriver and placed his head in his hands, letting a shaky breath wrack his body. He felt so disempowered with his emotions, hate and love colliding like fire and ice, a chemical mixture that could produce something beautiful, but if not tamed properly could be catastrophic. He needed to control his thoughts, his feelings, and his actions around Steve, because he will not have his heartbroken by this man a second time, nor will he feel discontented due to what Steve has done.
"I thought you could handle a little pain, Cap. When did you become so weak and pitiful." He spits at me.
, but this is out of my league," Tony stated. "This isn't something technological that I can solve and know by heart like the back of my hand, this is something far advanced, this is aliens we're talking about!" He could feel the anger getting to him, his jaw clenched as he took a shaky breath to calm himself down. "This isn't like the Chitauri, where there is a visible weakness, this is something bigger than that, and I can't crack it. You want help figuring this out? Call Thor, he's the one who can figure this shit out. All I can do is provide tech and evidence that has been laid out in front of me. Extraterrestrial shit, I cannot solve." He huffed out a breath of irritation and crossed his arms, sitting back in the chair.
There's a small intimate scene in this chapter. It occurs while the two are talking, but just know it doesn't really escalate as far, it's just more like a tease, I suppose.
"Hey, Cap!" He heard Natasha call out to him, making him turn his head in her direction. "What's the plan?" And he didn't know how to respond to her because he actually didn't get this far, believe it or not. He's more focused on just simply getting into the Raft and coming out with Tony that he didn't think about how they were going to accomplish this. However, it didn't take him more than a few seconds to at least devise a plan, because, well, he is
"It's hard adjusting to a new life, right?" He nodded his head and turned his gaze towards the waitress, smiling at her as she greeted them kindly. They placed their orders, and soon enough, she was on her way. Steve turned his head to look at Tony again, noticing the small smile on his face.
But it was the broken, scared voice he heard that made him pause in front of the door, hand on the handle. He slowly turned his head, and he was plagued with an immense wave of sadness. He could see Steve's face contort in pain, the way his breathing picked up, the way he grabbed the pillow and squeezed it tight in one hand, the feathers inside the pillow threatening to burst any second. The way his body shook violently despite the blanket being over him as if he was suffering from the harsh cold.
His eyesight had gotten a lot better, and while it's not perfect because there are still moments where his vision goes fuzzy and he needs to blink rapidly to correct it, the adhesion is gone and he can see just as clearly as he could before. The stuttering, however, persisted, but he was ok with that. He wasn't ok with it at first because he still desperately wanted his voice to be normal, he wanted to be able to speak without stuttering, but thanks to a certain brown-haired genius he loves so much, who assured him that the stuttering is a part of him now and he's always been perfect in his eyes no matter what, he was ok with it. So, he copes with the stuttering and embraces it. He speaks more often, even going so far as to speak long sentences and he's ok with constantly stuttering. It's not as frequent as it used to be, but it's still there and he's ok with that.
"Oh, so you are willing to talk to me. That's nice to know." The genius rolls his eyes at him, crossing his arms, and shrugs his shoulders, his eyebrows cast downwards as an unamused expression washes over his facial features. And now Steve's hurt because it's as if Tony is blaming him for not talking to him when
"I'm guessing sex is one of them?" Steve chuckled and nodded his head. "Figures, but I don't mind that. This is a bit slower than what I'm used to, but it's nice. Also no, you're my favorite person because it doesn't matter how much money I have, or how smart I am, the only thing you care about is the time we spend together."
"Captain Rogers?" Someone calls, breaking him out of his thought process. He jumps a little, his head bobs slightly and his eyebrows shoot upwards as he turns his head and looks towards the male doctor inching slightly out the door.
Maybe there was something different he could have done, he didn't stop to think about that possibility for a second, but he was running out of time. Actually, there was no time to simply put a pause to everything and hit rewind, because that only happens in movies, and while his life certainly seemed to play out that way, that's not what it felt like to him.
The two superheroes ate in comfortable silence, their eyes occasionally locking with one another. It felt good to finally have a moment of peace together, without any super spies or villains to ruin the mood. It was a nice touch of pace, because seriously if Tony got interrupted anymore when he was spending time with Steve, he was going to lose it. Or at the very least, he was going to fight someone, if that is what it came down to.
"I wanted to tell you that Nat and Clint are sorry. I kinda... Yelled at them, for what they said." Steve scratched the back of his head, and Tony could faintly make out the sign of red that stained his cheeks as he did, indicating the soldier was a little embarrassed about it.
depressed." His words came out more aggressive than he wanted to, causing the genius in front of him to raise his hands in surrender, his eyes widened in response as well. He cleared his throat and lowered his voice a little before speaking again. "Sorry, it's just... I'm sure I'm not depressed it's just..."
"Welp, gotta go guys, got a date with a hot super soldier." He didn't wait for them to respond, he simply ran out of the kitchen, forgetting his half-full cup of coffee, and getting back into his lab, setting himself back into his chair and once more pulling up a holographic image of Steve from the incoming phone call.
"Calm down bird brain, I'm getting there." Clint rolled his eyes but stayed silent as Tony pulled out his phone and started to explain once there were holograms in front of him. "So, if you don't already know, these holograms in front of me," he pointed at them, "I took from the security room in S.H.I.E.L.D., and as you can see there's the fake Fury coming in the room to try and kill me. That was one instance that we know of." He pushes the holograms back into his phone and stands up from the couch, facing everyone. "Wanda confirms that there were three of them at the bunker, we've seen one of them at S.H.I.E.L.D. when they were pretending to be Fury, there's another one locked up, Steve got attacked by another one, that's three already, so you'd think it would be over right?
"They wanted to keep us preoccupied with what was happening with our Captain so they could go undetected while they infiltrated the Triskelion," Bruce explained. "It's classic misdirection; you're distracted on one specific thing that you're unable to see anything else."
"You won't hurt me, you promised. Only you know how to touch me the way I like, and I promise I won't get uncomfortable. If I do, I'll be sure to tell you. But I trust you, so please make everything better." Tony nodded his head and got up off the couch, pulling Steve with him. They walked hand in hand towards the elevator, the sound of Tony's racing heart the only sound in his ears. Could Steve hear it too? No, if he did he would probably have said something by now, but he was still nervous about this.
The landing pad descended, and the top of the Raft started to fold inward, encasing them inside the island. Steve curled his hands into fists, which activated the collapsable vibranium Wakandan shields that T'Challa had made for him, while Bucky and Nat loaded their guns. The pad eventually reached the bottom, and they held their breaths for a few moments. Nat leaned over and pressed the button for the Quinjets door to slowly open. They walked forward, tense and quiet as the interior of the Raft came into view.
"Steve?" Bruce said softly. Another groan filled the expanse of the room, propelling Tony off of the chair and towards Steve's side. The soldier stirred, his fingers twitched and his eyelids fluttered. Tony's breath hitched in his throat and his hands shook as he watched Steve's eyes slowly open. He was confused at first until his eyes spotted Bruce and he smiled. That sweet, heart-warming smile that Tony missed so much, he finally got to see it again despite how much pain Steve must be in.
, Tony!" He moaned. He reached down and wrapped a hand around himself, but it was quickly swatted away by the genius. Steve whimpered and looked up, noticing the smirk plastered on Tony's face.
He stared at himself in the bathroom mirror, the door half-open as he wasn't really doing anything that needed privacy. He ran a hand through his long blonde locks, sighing heavily as he looked at his reflection. He was debating with himself whether or not he should shave off his beard. He didn't really mind it per se, but he kinda misses his clean-shaven look just a little bit.
"Well, we have the couch all to ourselves. Would be a nice way to end the night considering I've been missing a certain super soldier."
"Hey, it's gonna be ok. She's just gonna have a look, see what's in your head, no big deal." He moved closer to me, like a predator stalking its prey before it finally seized the perfect opportunity and pounced. I shrunk a little as he got close to me, his hot breath against my ear as he spoke. "I wanna see all the little things that you keep locked away in that pretty head of yours. I wanna see what you're so scared of."
"This is the best breakfast I've ever had. Usually, I don't even eat anything in the morning, all I need is just coffee and it's off to the lab. You're gonna make me more food in the future, right? I promise to eat it if you make it." He enjoyed the laugh that came out of Steve's mouth and the way his eyes twinkled due to the sun casting its light on them. God, Steve was too good to him, if only he could show him how much he appreciated him for putting up with his crap.
But he couldn't do a thing about it. So, he sat there through the rest of the day, and all through the night, crying, screaming in anguish, wishing that just for a moment, Tony cared enough to come to visit him and tell him he was sorry, but he knew he wasn't going to get that wish. He was all alone in this, and that's what killed him that night.
"You alright? Glad I followed you here after I saw myself casually strolling into this area." Fury joked. He didn't have the energy to laugh or try to wrap his brain around the situation, he just stared at the lifeless body on the ground. It started to shimmer and morph, what once was bald, dark-skinned, and covered in all black clothing, was now revealed to be a creature with fur covering the lower half of its body like pants, sharp claws on both its hands and feet, grey skin and eyes as red as rubies, its ears were pointed at the tip, and a weird set of silverish bone armor plastered across its chest.
"I j-just l-love y-you so mu-much." He stutters. The words are true as he speaks them because he loves this man
"I'm sorry, for judging you and not learning the truth until it was too late." She apologized. He shrugged his shoulders. It wasn't unusual for people to judge Tony's so quickly, after all, he did run a weapon manufacturing company that was overrun by his father's evil second in command, which of course he didn't know about which cost the lives of many people, but he's come a long way since then. It wasn't unusual for people to only see the surface of what Tony was willing to put out, only letting those he's super close with be able to see the real him, which of course is what his favorite super-soldier got to see every day.
"Y-You're hurting me, Tony," I said softly, unshed tears blurring my vision just a bit. He licked his lips and it made me shudder, this wasn't the Tony I was used to; Tony was always kind and gentle to me, he showed me affection and always took care of me. He would always run his fingers through my hair to ease the stress away, his kisses were always soft and careful like he wanted to savor each moment we were together. This Tony, he was rough, not so delicate, his kisses felt like needles against my skin, making me shiver and whimper. He seemed to be enjoying it, the way he smiled at me and licked his lips again.
He set objects on top of the drawer next to his bed, his footsteps light and quiet so he doesn't disturb the sleeping blonde. He knelt, grabbing one of Steve's arms and placing it around his shoulders, while he wrapped his own arm around Steve's waist. The soldier groaned a bit in his sleep, his face scrunching up, and his breathing had shifted, but he didn't wake up. Tony let out a quiet breath of relief as he carefully sat Steve up, his head bobbing from the side, finding its place on Tony's shoulder. The brunette rolled his eyes, wondering to himself why the fuck he thought this was a good idea. He should've just grabbed the pillow and the blanket, and put them on the floor with him. But, his own consciousness- that little annoying, goody-two-shoes asshole voice that told him not to, made him decide to do this instead.
"It's ok. I forgive you." He patted Steve's shoulder and stood up shortly after, dusting off invisible dirt from his pants.
He held him close, listening to Steve's weak heartbeat in his ear, the only indication that he was alive. It was so loud in his own ears, that he never noticed the Quinjet that came to their location, hauled with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that came towards him with a gurney, telling him he needed to step back so they could do their job. He let go of Steve, for now, letting the agents gently put him on the gurney, and carefully as they could get him onto the Quinjet. And he followed them into the jet, not wanting to leave the soldiers' side.
He heard footsteps coming towards his cell, and he didn't bother looking up anyways. It was probably either the guards or Ross himself, coming to gloat at the fact he has him all locked up in here like a caged animal, slowly accepting its death. Eventually, the footsteps stopped in front of his cell, and he just waited there patiently for them to speak.
The door to his room opened, and he sat up abruptly. He remained stoic as he watched Tony walk in, looking anywhere that wasn't at him. His heart lurched inside his chest, aching at the action because he really
"That's nice, J. Least one of us is worried about me." He stopped staring into space to look at the bottle gripped tightly in his closed fist, eyes squinted. With some ounce of strength left somewhere within him, he uncurled his fist from the bottle and let it sit there on the metal desk where he worked. "I can't do this." He muttered to himself. He rubbed his eyes with the back of his palms, working out some of the tiredness that lingered within them. He couldn't do this; there was no reason to succumb to the sinful succulence of an alcoholic beverage that knew him so well since they'd gotten acquainted over the years. There was no reason to suddenly give up all he's worked for just to drown his sorrows into a bottle. He was better than this, and he couldn't let himself down.
"It is possible." He opened the door and left Tony sitting there, collecting his thoughts. The genius bit his lip, his brain trying to put two and two together. Suddenly, something clicked inside of his head and he was up out of the chair, running to catch up to Fury.
He watched as footage he's already seen before appears on the computer screen. Yes, he knows all about the horrible things that Ross and his guards have done to Steve- his Steve, mind you because he planted a nanite camera that managed to crawl its way undetected into the central hall where the prison cells were. This is the second time he watches Ross wail on Steve with the back end of a gun, repeatedly striking him in the head, drawing blood that mats and stains his blonde hair. Twice he watches Steve steel his expression every time Ross shocks him with the collar around his neck, twice he watches him clench his jaw, and twice he watches his body visibly shake. And he hates himself that he's subjected him to this, because he was the one who brought him to New York, right into the hands of the person who hates his guts.
It was the fact that he was frozen in ice for nearly seventy years that caused him to not only shudder at the mere thought of anything that reminded him of the cold, but he also preferred to take really hot showers to remind himself that he wasn't back in the ice, that this wasn't all a sick twisted nightmare and he was actually still encased in the ice. Although he doubts that would be the case, he still hated the cold.
He thought that maybe it was a sign that Tony was ready to talk when he called him from the flip phone he gave him. But alas, it was nothing but a trap.
"First of all, language. Second of all, I learned from my mom. I used to help her cook back in the old days. Like I said, taught me everything I know." He smiled as the genius scarfed down his food, picking up the mug a few seconds later, slurping at the fresh coffee he made for him.
"Hey, Steve I-" He froze in place, head slowly turning towards the intruder standing in the doorway. He felt his face heat up, a deep blush of scarlet painting his cheeks, and he was hoping that it was dark enough for the other to not see how embarrassed he was. He was thankful that he was at least at an angle where the intruder couldn't see his front side, but sadly it gave the person a great view of his ass. He covered himself up and turned away from the door, too embarrassed to try and make any form of eye contact.
After waiting patiently for twelve hours, and then another two hours for them to get Steve situated in the medical ward, the doctors finally gave him the permission he needed to go and see the soldier. And even if they didn't, he would most likely throw a fit and get his way regardless, because he cares a significant amount about the blonde.
"It's nice to see you finally joining us for breakfast, Stark. Usually, you're down in that lab of yours doing who knows what." Clint joked. Tony chuckled lightly, sipping his orange juice and giving a content sigh at how refreshing it tasted.
He clenched his jaw and looked at the man in disgust. Of course, Ross would stoop this low and give him an ultimatum. But regardless, he'd rather take the latter option than give up the soldier.
He threw the pillow back where he took it from, and let his head hang, eye glued towards the floor. It's easier to give up than it is to try, and all he wanted to do was give up and be done with the therapy, be done with trying, done with
"You love me, right?" This time he spoke sweetly, a hint of a smile in his voice. I looked at him through teary eyes, my head resting against the chair as a sob racked my body.
It's as he sits in his room do the dark thoughts of previous nights come back to him. He hates how he got so low, waiting each passing day for Tony to call him, and never once hearing the phone ring. He got so low, so down and so crazy of thinking that maybe Tony didn't need him at all, and he was only hurting himself by constantly waiting for the genius to call him and tell him that he needed him, that he was willing to pull the trigger and put a bullet into his brain.
Clint was unconscious, unresponsive in the stretcher they carried him on, his body littered with gashes that were visible and not covered by his clothes, he looked so vulnerable and pale. Then there was Natasha, stone-cold, emotionless Natasha, struggling against the doctors that were holding her down, only for her to fight her way through them.
"Your brother wasn't so lucky?" She nodded her head slowly. He really felt for her, no one should have their family taken away from them at such a young age, and then lose the only family that they had left. She was alone, and he sympathized with her. If it wasn't for the Avengers, Tony would also be feeling the way she probably did. He would feel all the emotional turmoil she was having with being alone, and it would be hard to cope with.
Friday wasn't lying when she said that there was a mass quantity of vehicles approaching the perimeter. He could see the choppers high in the sky, circling the compound, multiple black vans within his sight as well, stopping on the lawn.
The first stop they went to was the shopping mall, because Tony decided it would be a good idea to have Steve try on an assortment of clothes just a size too small for the super-soldier, just so he could see the muscles and the toned body of his friend. Needless to say, Steve wasn't too happy being Tony's personal model, but the genius more than made up for it by allowing the soldier to pick out his own clothes. He relented at first because he liked his wardrobe as it was now, and didn't want the genius to spend money on him, considering he could do that for himself. However, Tony's stubbornness won in the end and he ended up buying one outfit he really liked. He really tried to talk Tony out of paying for the more than expensive outfit he picked out, but Tony assured him that it really didn't matter and that he was more than happy to pay for whatever Steve wanted.
"These are fresh, so they couldn't have gone far. I just don't know how far we're going to get before we lose it." Clint said. Tony wasted no time in following the tracks, Jarvis highlighting them as the others followed.
"Alright," he said, holding up his hands in surrender, "I'll go to your room and get you some clothes. Just stay here and look pretty." He paused for a moment, looking off to the side for a bit before speaking once more. "Well, more pretty than you already are. You know what I mean." He started walking towards the door to his lab after noticing the death glare the soldier was giving him, and he swore if looks could kill, he'd be dead by now.
"From what you've induced, Mr. Stark, then these extraterrestrials are far superior and highly dangerous. With our best agents and soldier's out at the moment if they are still alive-"
Tony rubbed away the sleepiness from his eyes, he was too tired to be doing this right now, but he needed to get more information on the situation at hand. He tried his best to keep his eyes open, but it was such a long and exhausting day for the poor genius. He was on a rollercoaster of emotions and it was hard to pinpoint exactly what he was feeling past the drowsiness. Fingers snapped in front of his face and it made him jump, blinking rapidly and looking at Natasha, rubbing his eyes again.
blood, and it would give him nightmares if he saw the soldiers blood on his own hands because then, he would constantly remember when Steve was practically dying in front of him and he was unable to do anything. He doesn't want to remember this moment where Steve might be fighting for his life, or if he died right here. He doesn't need that on his conscience.
As the three split up and explored the interior, Tony was deep into his work, fingers flying across the keyboard, the rapid clicking on keys being pressed, eyes moving across every bit of code he entered, only to let out a sigh of frustration when he was denied access. It didn't stop him, however, he pushed forward, stopping occasionally to take a few calming breaths before his fingers tapped away at his keyboard again. The seconds turned into minutes, and the minutes rolled along as he worked his way through the firewall. He was about to let out a sigh of frustration again when finally, a green checkmark appeared before his eyes, and the words "ACCESS GRANTED" blinked on the screen.
The ride back down to his lab was silent, giving him time to brew and fester in his thoughts. He hoped he didn't say anything that would set the soldier off; granted he's said a lot of things that had set Steve off when they didn't like each other, but this is different.
"Tony I'm going down!" He panicked. The rumbling slowly turned into groaning, the Quinjet no longer able to be stabilized in the air, and it dipped downwards. The sides scraped against the thick barks of the mighty Oak trees, pushing, damaging the Quinjet as it made its descent towards the ground. And he only panicked more, memory fragments of his past flashing before his eyes once more.
"Thank you, Agent Romanoff," Fury said, "as I was saying, we need to figure out where these extraterrestrials are holding the Captain. And on top of that, has anybody gotten a hold of Thor?"
He watches as Steve's eyes flutter open, still holding his hand with his own. He watches as his eyes open fully, and then it's almost like a pin dropped somewhere in the room. He watches the soldier look around, eyebrows cast downwards, furrowed, a deep frown on his face as his eyes look around the room. He sees the adhesion in his right eye now that he's a lot closer to him than he was back at the plane, and now that he's not staring only at his lip. He felt the blonde squeeze his hand tighter, confusion so prominent on his face, mixed in with slight fear, and it just breaks Tony's heart.
"Don't," Tony said softly, a sad smile on his face, "don't ever apologize for that. What happened to you was unfair, and I completely understand how you feel. I will and would
"So, you asked me how I'm doing, and the answer is great. Peachy. Perfect. Fine. Is that a good enough answer?"
I just want to say, thank you all for the lovely comments and kudos you have all given me! It's genuine to see that people adore this story, and are willing to take the journey to the end. Soon enough, the story will kick off even further. Also, I'm sorry if it seems things are moving too fast time-wise and between the boys, I very much apologize for that if anybody wanted a slow burn. I will put myself out there and say, I am not the best when it comes to taking things slow, as all my life I'd had instances where things have moved too fast. Other than that, I do hope the fluctuation doesn't deter anyone, and once again, thank you for your comments and kudos! Love you all, and enjoy the chapter!
Yet the world works in mysterious ways and gives you the thing you want the most even if you least expect it, and he never thought that Tony would be the thing he wanted the most. He wants to take this time to tell the genius everything he's wanted to say in just three simple words, because by God does the brunette mean so much to him even after everything that has happened, good and bad. To him, love is not something to be taken granted for, and he will never understand the aspect of cheating. He himself is not a cheater, he is loyal to the person he loves and will always be loyal to them. Granted, he knows he's human and he makes mistakes, but he hopes that cheating will not be one of them, and if he does happen to do it then he hopes to be able to work things out and tell his side of the story. Love does not equal abuse, that is not love. One does not simply raise a hand, or a fist, or anything they can find to hurt, break, or damage their lover. Love is special; kind, compassionate, truthful and above all else breathtakingly beautiful.
"Alright, you've had your laugh. Now hurry up and get outta my lab and get some clothes. We're going out." He walked away from the couch, closing down the holograms of his suits, as well as the ones of his teammates' suits. As he looked back, he saw a blushing super soldier just standing there, a blanket wrapped around his waist. Did Tony raise his eyebrow? Most definitely. It's not because Steve is standing there in his boxers with just a blanket, but because Steve was just standing there.
"We'll figure something out," he reassured her with a sad smile, "the guy in there is a tough son of a bitch, and he'll pull through. We'll all pull through. As for you, why don't you stick around? Maybe you could help?"
Before Tony could use the good Captain's own sentence of "language" against him, he effectively kept his mouth shut, watching as Steve stood up, unclipping his belt that wrapped around his waist. "Steve, you don't have to-"
"He's not property, he's a human being! And I swear to god if you hurt him I-", another dark chuckle was heard and Tony felt his breath start to become shallow. Something must've happened to Steve if this thing is laughing at him.
"Nat," Tony said softly. She stared at Clint for a little bit longer, the feeling of unshed tears threatening to spill over. She wiped them away and turned towards Tony, a small sad smile on her face.
They stepped in the elevator, and the brunette pushed the button to his floor. He felt his hand being squeezed by the soldier next to him. When he turned his head, he already saw Steve smiling at him, so he reciprocated the action, and in a soft voice, just barely above a whisper he asked, "can I kiss you?"
"Sir," his AI's voice boomed around him, causing him to jump in response and break him out of his brewing.
The two talked for hours, thankfully undisturbed, otherwise Tony swore he was going to lose it if his Steve time got interrupted. In the time given to them, Tony had decided that maybe if he was going to accept that the soldier felt something for him, it would be better to talk about it when he got back, rather than doing it like this. It would be a conversation he most likely wouldn't ever be prepared for; even if he didn't know when Steve was going to be back and that gave him either a lot or a little bit of time to think about what he wanted to say, emotional conversations were still something he preferred to stay away from. If it was for Steve, then he would be willing to compromise.
he will not apologize for saving his best friend. It might seem shallow, and something that he should apologize for, and whether it be due to his own stubbornness and pride, saving Bucky was something he had the opportunity to do all over again, and this time he had succeeded.
He turns off the water and steps out of the shower, leaving his workout clothes on the bathroom floor to be picked up later. He traverses across his room, drying off his hair, small wisps of air hitting his bare skin. He noticed that moonlight was barely inching its way into his room, touching whatever inch of the room the moonbeams could find. Just how much time has passed today? He pulls out a pair of boxers briefs, the only article of clothing he needed in the middle of the night for bed.
Tony pushed the door to the bunker opening, listening to the way the door groaned. He visibly flinched in disgust as he noticed the cobwebs littering the corners of the walls, the chipped paint accompanied by mold, it was a sight for sore eyes. He and Thor split to cover a few more inches of the bunker. His footsteps creaked against the floorboards, and he didn't know what to expect. He was going to lie to himself and say that he was okay because he wasn't. If he found out that something serious happened to Steve, he was going to blame himself until the end of time. He knows it's stupid and he shouldn't, but when it comes to people he cares about, all rational decision-making goes out the window.
"Yes." He felt a prickling sensation behind his eyeballs, the faint feeling of tears staining his cheeks as they spilled forth from his tear ducts. He rubbed them away with the back of his hand, but more little water droplets took their place. He tried to control his emotions, he hated crying because it always made him feel weak. He hated the feeling of being weak, he was supposed to be strong in situations like this, he was supposed to be made of iron, he wasn't supposed to break down this easily. "If I had just gone on that mission, if I had just followed them then I could have done something. It's all my fault."
"Like Stark is the luckiest man alive." She replied. He blushed a little bit but smiled again nonetheless. Truthfully, he felt that he himself was the lucky one rather than Tony. He felt the genius could have anybody he wanted, and he chose him; someone who's no more than just a kid from Brooklyn who got lucky, in his own words. "He's waiting for you. I wouldn't keep him waiting if I were you."
"You're a romantic at heart, but a huge sap as well. Not that I mind, I like everything about you." Steve smiled at how sweet Tony was, even if he denied that he could be a sap as well at times, it was nice that he showed his true self to the soldier.
It was from their team bonding exercise just a few short months after the whole Loki incident, popcorn scattered around the floor, soda cans standing tall on the table, smiles on their faces, hell, he could even still hear the laughter resonating from the picture. And then the wave of sadness came crashing down on him, full force, like a tidal wave submerging him a wet, mountain of sand, leaving him treading water, reaching for the surface to take that life-saving gasp of air. The more he stared at the picture, the more pain welled in his heart, pulling at the strings inside of the organ until he couldn't handle looking at the image anymore. They were his team; no, they were more than just a team, they were his
When he opened his eyes and saw the area around him was coated in thick darkness, minus the faint light that filtered through a window he could see, he was honestly very confused.
"It confirmed what Clint said; that they turn into the people we care about the most to break us, to get in our head, to fuck us up so they can take our asses out. On top of that, it told me some info about Steve." He spoke calmly.
Nobody said anything, and the silence was deafening in Tony's ears. It unnerved him how quiet it was, but soon he felt arms wrap around his waist, and a head placed on his shoulder. He smiled, and in response, he wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, holding him close and placing a small kiss on the side of his head.
"Oh, thank God you're here Tony! I was worried something happened to you." He said relieved, the genius standing there smiling at him. "I'm not even going to ask how you knew my location, considering you're a genius and probably put a tracking device in my shield, but let's go find Nat and Clint." He started to walk away, but the geniuses' feet were still planted in the same spot behind him.
Once again he felt like it was all his fault, and the guilt was settling deep into his bones and coiling around his muscles. He keeps thinking to himself that if he had just done
"It's fine. Like I said before, most people like to call me an asshole." She shook her head and chuckled, the weight of her guilt slowly diminishing. "I've come a long way since then, and I'm sure you can too. You have an amazing gift, Wanda, let's use it for something good."
self, before I received the serum. Sure, I had no problem standing up to bullies, I hated them, but there's only so much a person can take. Yet, I never learned. Even after this, I continued to open my mouth and have my ass handed to me, but where things got this bad, I always had Bucky.
Well, perhaps maybe it was different deep-seated happiness he hasn't figured out yet. Hell, he and Steve never really got along when they first met, and if you asked him, he would hope that they were considered friends, or at the very least, Steve considered him a friend back. It actually weird for him to even consider them friends if he was honest with himself. All those years of worshipping Captain America, loving everything about him, buying everything and anything Captain America related, to sadly being compared to the very man you looked up to by your father. Those years of worship slowly transformed into a few years of resentment to anything and everything Captain America, but truthfully deep down, he still cherished the idea of him.
"Nah, when I was younger I was bullied in school." Steve furrowed his eyebrows, a small frown always making its way onto his face. That was actually something he didn't really know about Tony. Well, there were still a lot of things he didn't know about Tony, and it made him actually sad to know he was bullied growing up.
"I got you, big guy. I'm here." He whispered, scared that if he spoke any louder he might hurt Steve. The soldier smiled, and how it hurt him in a way to see how this damaged man, who was most likely in so much pain, still had the heart to smile in a time like this. But he didn't do anything except smile back and brush his long blonde locks, ignoring how he got blood on his fingers.
"That's very nice of you, although personally, I'd think it's weird to not even call me so I could at least look decent."
It was that stupid-ass nickname Tony had given him that had any sort of effect on him. All of his words he just ate up, but upon hearing the world
"Enjoy the food, Big Guy. I'll be back." He smiles in response. Before Tony leaves, he kisses his palm and holds it out in front of him, blowing a kiss towards him, which he happily catches and brings his hand towards his heart, keeping it there. With one last smile, he exits the room and heads towards the communal area to look for T'Challa.
"It feels good to kiss you again, too." He let go of the underside of Tony's knees, and the brunette climbed down off of him, sitting back down on his stool and opening the bag that contained two wrapped burgers inside. "I brought you back something to eat, considering I'm sure you haven't eaten yet."
"I love you, Anthony Edward Stark," Steve whispered, eyes falling shut. Tony smiled and placed a soft kiss on Steve's head, wrapping his arm around him and holding him close.
"Someone really likes that, huh?" He saw Steve nod, and it widened his smirk. "Well, what if I did this?" He let his tongue lick the hard nub once more, but his right hand tweaked his other one, causing the soldier to arch once more, his erection grinding against Tony's again. It drove Tony crazy the way Steve always lost self-control because of him. He remembers how when they first started intimately touching each other, how hard it was for Steve to not fuck Tony right then and there, the way he growled and shivered, the way he pushed Tony up against the wall every time they kissed, the way Steve took control. Now the roles were reversed, and Tony was the one in control this time. He switched over to licking Steve's right nipple, tongue flicking against the hard nub and his fingers pinched and tweaked the other.
"Then it's perfectly fine to be talking about this. As far as I'm concerned, nobody is stopping you from showing me your goods. Specifically your ass, but I wouldn't mind taking a gander at your dick either." As much as he was enjoying toying with the blushing soldier, there was a small voice in the back of his head that told him to stop what he was doing. He couldn't quite tell past the hands that were covering Steve's embarrassment, but he felt, or rather, he knew he was moving just a bit too fast, more so for the soldier's taste. "Sorry, I'm just joking, don't take it seriously. I don't wanna move too fast and make you uncomfortable."
"Right away, sir." The AI worked his magic and soon Tony started to balance out again, but he still crashed hard into the asphalt waiting for him. He rolled across the ground and bounced for a few seconds before he finally came to a skidding halt. He groaned in pain and sat up, looking at the right side of his suit, noticing the gaping hole where the color of red and gold used to be, and the flickering blue light where his repulsor blast was always functioning at the ready. There were eerie sounds in the distance, getting closer as the minutes rolled by. He stood up as the sounds were close to him, his left repulsor blast at the ready.
A dark chuckle echoed into the room, the source coming from Tony in front of me. He moved forward and sat in my lap, his body pressed against me, his head rested against my injured shoulder, causing it to flare in response. "Home you say, no that doesn't sound like a good idea. Firstly, I think you deserve to learn what happens when you make someone who worries about your care." I looked at him confused, my eyebrows furrowed. Soon that confusion turned into a muffled scream of pain through gritted teeth as I felt his finger press against the bullet wound in my shoulder. I could feel the flesh moving around, tearing as he dug his finger slightly inside the wound.
"It's safe to say that the greatest way to get inside multiple people's minds is to target something you all care about, that would be your precious Captain." Fury spoke.
He stood up and wasted no time in exiting his room, his shoulders slumped as he walked. He was, however, looking forward to his therapy session, because maybe Tony might be there like he was the first day and they could walk together. Tony wouldn't miss his therapy session!
for him not to leave. It must've been a pretty horrible nightmare, oh who was he shitting, it was most definitely a horrible nightmare if the whimpering and prominent sweat were any indications.
He thought. He then realized that he was in his room, laying down on his own bed. "Good morning, Jarvis." He said as he sat up. "What time is it?"
"I was hoping to ask you the same question. He has not returned from his mission, and I am very worried."
"Please what? Tell me what you want." Tony teased, his tip sliding inside just a little bit before sliding right back out.
And yet he lays on his bed, facing the ceiling and contemplating his choices. He thinks about all the good that Steve has done for him, and everything they've been through together. And it's that word together that makes his heart flutter just a little bit because when he thinks about it more, they've always been doing things together up until this point. Even when they were separate, they were suffering together in a way, and they've made it all the way here together. It's the word alone that makes him get up from his bed and exit his room, traversing the hall once more to make his way towards Steve's room.
Tony's footsteps ceased, and his own shortly followed. The Brunette gestured to the plate resting on the island sitting in the middle of the kitchen, which was also linked to the debriefing room he sorely remembers when they were first given the accords. He inched his way over towards the island, a plate consisting of eggs, crispy bacon, hash browns, pancakes with just a small cube of butter sitting at the top, accompanied by a healthy dose of syrup cascading down the sides, and finished off with a nice cup of coffee. His stomach growled, and before he knew it he was already digging in with the fork he grabbed next to the plate.
As he laid there waiting for the blonde to return, it felt like he was waiting a little too long. Steve should have already been back by now, all he really had to do was put the dishes in the dishwasher. Oh, right, he forgot that Steve would most likely wash the dishes by hand because he didn't know how to use the dishwasher. Even so, he still should have been back by now.
The familiar spark of electricity coursed through his body, his shoulders tensed, his jaw clenched, his eyes held an emotionless expression in them as Tony adjusted the severity of the current. He was used to this too often, and just like when Ross had done it, multiple times in one day out of pleasure at hoping to hear Steve whimper in pain, hoping to see him squirm, he would do the same to Tony; steel his expression and not let a single sound out of his mouth, no matter how bad the collar was shocking him.
They wasted no time getting back to their home, night setting in, moonlight shimmering through the crack of glass the windows let seep through inside the tower. It was a very good day, Steve would tell himself as he stood in the elevator with Tony, letting it carry them to their floors.
"Don't hurt me anymore, please I'm sorry!" The blonde screamed as the genius tried to get closer to him. He stood there, frozen, listening to the small whimpers that escaped past Steve's lips, listened to the way he sniffled, watched as the tears cascaded down his cheeks. "I'm sorry for being weak, I-I'll be stronger next time! I'll be better, for you. Please... Don't hurt me again, I can't handle the pain!" He watched as he closed himself off from the rest of the world, knees held tightly against his chest by his arms, his head hidden away from him, the way his body racked itself as he sobbed. He couldn't do anything, he couldn't get close to him without Steve freaking out. He wasn't... He wasn't able to make him happy.
"I also wanted to ask if you're free? There's something I want to show you." Steve said once he pulled back from the kiss. On the genius's own face, a smirk replaced the lazy smile he had just a few seconds ago.
"Yes, sir." He kissed Tony again, a small peck this time instead of a full-blown kiss. He got off the bed and grabbed both the mug and the plate, making his way over to the door. "I'll be right back. Gonna go put the dishes away."
"S-Steve?" Tony called. His voice sounded so small and far away in his own ears. He took a step forward, and his heart utterly broke when he saw Steve flinch in response.
"So then, that should be the end of the story. Except it's not, because you're just the pawn in all of this. You're not the ring leader, the one behind all of these evil schemes, you're just carrying them out. So, where's your leader?"
"You can't expect me to suddenly just leave him after this long of staying here!" He yelled. She stayed silent, an emotionless expression on her face as she let him speak. "You don't know what it's like when the person who gave you everything: a home, a life,
"Over here, Spangles." He voiced. He heard the soldier's footsteps carry him over to the couch where Tony resided, the seat next to him dipping a bit as he sat down next to the genius. He could feel the other staring at him, waiting for him to look in his general direction. He gave in and turned his head to look at the blonde, his own angry expression staring into Steve's stoic one.
As Tony occupied himself with popping popcorn and getting some soda from the fridge, he wondered what would be a good movie for them to watch? What exactly do you watch with someone who's been in cryostasis for 70 years? He figures that Star Trek would be easier to watch than Star Wars; not that he doesn't
"Uh... No, no I'm okay. I-I already ate." And he knew this was a lie because Tony always had this little gleam in his eye that Steve could see even from this distance. It was also close to his eye, a brief shimmer in his brown iris that he has come to not only love but also come to pick up as a sign whenever Tony wasn't telling the truth.
to use the machine." A look of understanding crossed Tony's face. He took his mug out from under the machine once it was full to the brim with steaming hot liquid. He held out his hand, motioning for Steve to give him the mug. Hesitantly the blonde complied and handed his mug to the genius, who put the mug under the machine just like his earlier.
"It took a lot of courage for me to come down here, and I still feel uncertain as to whether I made the right choice or not. Some people would want space after they think their other half told them to kill themselves out of love, but..." He trailed off, lost in his thoughts as he tried to grasp for the right words to say without upsetting Tony. "What I'm trying to say, is that I'm ok with you putting boundaries on our relationship to not set me off, but at the same time I want you to cross those boundaries and just love me."
food in his own stomach, satiating his hunger. What also surprised him was that the food was cooked so well, and it leaves him to wonder if Tony had cooked this himself; not to say that Tony
"Do what? You mean this?" Another sound of pleasure escaped past his lips as the genius ground against him more, his hips slowly thrusting forward against him. Steve pulled him close, leaning his head to the side as Tony started to bite and lick his neck while he rutted against him. They barely registered the elevator ding that signaled their arrival onto Tony's floor, their mouths detaching from one another so Tony could quickly lead them to his room.
"Perfectly fine. But if I may ask, why did you do this for me?" He wasn't really complaining about the food; how could he even complain about it anyway? The food was divine, it sent his taste buds to heaven with how everything was cooked to perfection. If he was honest he wanted more, and that was speaking volumes inside his head.
"Uh... Yeah. Let her in." The door to the lab opened and he heard the sound of boots thudding against the floor. He counted the minutes, the seconds even until the boots stopped a few feet away from him. He turned around slowly and his eyes met a less than amused Natasha Romanoff, standing there with her arms crossed, a stoic look on her face, but if he knew any better with how long they've lived together, deep down she was probably a little bit pissed at him.
He thought, rolling his eyes. "Alright, Barton and Romanoff, you guys search the perimeter, see if you can find anything through this snow. Thor, you're checking the inside with me. Any objections?"
"Your wish is my command, my handsome genius." Steve backpedaled slowly away from Tony, not taking his eyes off of him until he got closer to the door. Tony sighed as he saw the door close, Steve's form disappearing behind it. He turned around and sat on his stool once more, staring into space.
"There's someone I want you to meet. I'll be right back, so don't go anywhere." He got off of me and grabbed the bucket behind the chair. I heard his footsteps walk away from me for a few seconds before he stopped. "Oh wait, that's right. You're tied up and can't go anywhere. Oops." He laughed and walked away from me again. The sound of a door being open and closed making its way into my ear.
"Sure, the couch is always there if you ever need it." He motions with his head for him to follow, and like a well-trained puppy, he follows. Tony opens the doors to his lab and leads Steve towards the couch, gesturing with his hand for him to lay down. With shaky feet, he walks across the cold ground towards his destination. He gently eases onto the couch, curling up onto his side, staring at the vast expanse of Tony's lab, taking in all the equipment he's tampered with and upgraded. His eyes start to close as he loses the strength to keep them open, fatigue taking over. He vaguely felt the presence of a blanket being placed on him as he drifted off into another attempt into a peaceful slumber, only this time, the nightmares never came.
"That still doesn't explain how they were able to get their hands on shield tech and modify the weapons," Tony said.
A pained chuckle escaped past Steve's lip, followed by a small fit of coughing that seemed to have agitated his body, making him cough slightly harder. He took a minute to breathe, staring up at Tony as he spoke. "I'm sorry for Siberia. I'm sorry for hurting you and putting a strain on our relationship. There's just so much I'm sorry for, but I don't know if I have the time." He swallowed hard, blinking back some tears that threatened to fall.
"Quiet, J. Nothing matters anymore." He sighed to himself and took a swig from the whiskey bottle he got from his alcohol cabinet. He usually enjoyed the way the brown-colored liquid burned the back of his throat, the way it relaxed his body, the way it set his body so close to the edge between sober and drunk. How he relished in every moment he got drunk, but he hasn't felt this urge ever since Steve came into his life and they got to know each other. Yes, the super-soldier has been satiating his need for an alcoholic beverage by giving him the strength he needs to overcome this demon of his. But with how things are working against him now, well, it's not like Steve is going to be stopping him anytime soon.
"You both look so happy." A voice resonated behind him. He turned around and saw Wanda, standing there with a small, sad smile on her face. "And I ruined it. I'm so sorry."
Soon enough they did have to break away, and God did they both miss it so much. It felt so right to be in that moment, that they wanted more, they craved the feeling of their lips together more, but that could wait for later.
"Have it your way." Ross sneered. He held up his hands, and the guns of his guards were lifted, aimed at the man of Iron. Tony didn't falter, however, he just stood his ground, hands held up as he readied his repulsor blasts. "Fire!"
His breath hitched and was caught in his throat, his vision blurred as tears started to form. He quickly wiped them away with the back of his hand, not wanting to cry in front of Steve. The soldier only giggled and reached out to grab Tony's hand, kissing his palm before entwining their fingers, and then kissing the back of his hand.
"I think you should keep the beard, it looks good on you all things considered." A feminine voice spoke out to him. He turned his head towards the door and saw Natasha, dressed in a grey high neck vest accompanied by black cargo style sweatpants, leaning against the door frame with her arms crossed, and her traditional all-knowing sly smirk plastered on her face. "Besides," she pushed off the door frame and walked over to him, placing her hands on the second to the top button on his short sleeve white collared shirt and undoing it, exposing just a bit more of his chest. "I think Stark really likes the beard." He chuckled at her, exiting the bathroom with her in tow.
"W-where did you send h-him?" To an untrained eye, they might not have noticed the way T'Challa's stance faltered for a second; the way his shoulder has slumped just slightly, the way the corner of his mouth curved downwards for a few seconds before it returned to its straight-line posture.
"Come on." He whispered. He waited for the perfect moment, watching as the creature moved so fast he hardly had any time to lock onto its location. He waited, letting it get closer to him. Once the creature suddenly disappeared from his field of vision, he turned around and held his left hand up, the familiar humming sound of his repulsor blast directed at the creature's face that tried to jump him from behind. He let the blast go and watched as the alien sailed away from him, its body crashing into another destroyed car, and staying there, limp.
felt like a prisoner. It was ironically funny- escape from being a prisoner from one place, only to be a prisoner in another place. He sighed heavily and continued to look up at the ceiling, one hand behind his head, the other on his stomach, and one leg curled under the other, right below his kneecap.
"Say that again when you can form a proper sentence without stuttering." He joked back, walking over to the other two. He pushed his best friend lightly in his shoulder, which earned him one in return followed by a short moment of laughter. And Steve was glad to have Bucky back even if he was a different person now- well, he was the same person he's always been, but mind control certainly does make you into a different person. Regardless, at least he had Bucky back.
"Come on, Shellhead, we got a fight to win." Tony happily took Steve's hand in his, the smile on his face only increasing with each loving gesture he shared with Steve.
"Don't worry about me, J. I'll be back before you know it." The lab door closed, and the lights shut off as Tony made his way in his Iron Man suit to S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ.
Everything he's ever wanted, he's been given it- even if he's had to work for it, he's still gotten it. Although it comes with some complications, such as him either breaking it, forgetting about it, or plain out ignoring it. That's his downfall, and he acknowledges that the things he has now are easily able to be taken away because that's just equivalent exchange. Sometimes things are given for free without consequences, depending on what it is.
"I do mean that, yes. I'll do anything to make you happy. Even if I fuck up somehow and hurt you, I'll make it up to you. I don't like seeing you sad."
"Let's go back in time real quick. Steve, Nat, and Clint went on a mission of reconnaissance that the real Fury administered, but when they captured the Hydra agents, they suddenly disappeared. I'm willing to bet that they were simply there as a means to get information on us. I'm inclined to say they gathered information on all of us and were waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Except we haven't encountered their leader yet, it's just been the little ones giving us hell. There's only one place, or organization that I can think of that would allow them to blend in, for them to carry out their operation."
you. I mean, I shot a fake version of you but... I don't ever wanna be in a situation like that. It hurt so much." Tony felt his heartbreak for the soldier emotionally. This man has been through so much, and there's just more salt being added to his wounds by the minute. He couldn't even begin to imagine how he would feel if he were in Steve's shoes, but God does he wish he could be. All this pain, all this agonizing, unnecessary, twisted pain that Steve's been through, he doesn't deserve this.
I would also like to say that, yes, there is an epilogue after this that I think you guys will enjoy, and that there will be a sequel to this story sometime in the near future. Other than that, I hope you enjoy all the other stories I will be posting- and also writing- for you to enjoy!
He was there to carry her coffin on his shoulders, trying so hard not to break down in front of everyone, and he succeeded. He learned a few things that day: such as the fact that Sharon Carter was Peggy's niece- and really he should have seen that one coming, but then again he never really knew her last name anyways- and that love hurts. He loved Peggy with all his heart, and he was reminded of that each day he visited her once he found out her location. He made sure to listen to her stories, tend to her when needed, and as much as it hurt him, he was there for her when she forgot who he was, over and over again. But he loved her, young and old; because even if Steve is technically a twenty-seven-year-old man who was frozen in ice at that age, he will always be that ninety-seven, bordering one-hundred, or even greater- year old who should have had a life with Peggy, and gone through what she had with her.
"I wanted to say thank you." This caused Tony to raise an eyebrow and look at Steve with an amused expression.
"It's just... I want to know what happened after our connection got cut? Jarivs told me an EMP took out the commlinks, so now I'm just left with the knowledge I gathered, with a lot of missing parts in between. So can you fill me in?"
"What did Steve do to make you want to be a better person?" Bruce questioned. Oh fuck, he said that out loud, again!? Goddammit, when was he going to learn to keep his thoughts inside of his head instead of letting them spew out of his mouth faster than he could realize? Now they're going to question him about the super soldier and he'll never hear the end of it. "Well, we are curious about why Steve would make you a better person, but I'm sure we're not going to go overboard with the questions."
So at the moment, it was easy to feel nothing, not even a sliver of what he used to feel for Steve. He just stared at the screen in front of him, watching the soldier writhe in pain, his body shuddering as he turned the frequency of the shock collar up more, just wanting to hear Steve complain once. He wanted him to understand exactly how he felt; how much pain and anguish he put him through, how he was unable to sleep at night because of what he had done to him.
They stood there, bodies flushed against each other, Tony still in Steve's embrace, neither attempting to separate just yet. It was moments like this where they could take the time to enjoy each other's company, neither wanting to talk about the mission or possibly discuss anything that could go wrong. No, now wasn't the time to talk about that and ruin the moment, all they wanted to do right now, was enjoy a moment together.
He sighed and looked down, noticing how peaceful Steve looked, how absolutely young and stunning he was. He smiled and leaned down, placing a soft kiss on the side of Steve's head. After his breakup with Pepper, he was so convinced that he was incapable of loving anyone, that if he got into another relationship he would be the reason things wouldn't work out. As his fingers continued to run through Steve's hair, and his gaze was locked on his sleeping form, he felt this burning sensation in his chest. It wasn't the type of burning sensation where you were in pain and it was hard to breathe, no, this was completely different. It was the type of sensation in your chest where you look at someone and realize, that without a shadow of a doubt, you truly care about the well-being of this person. You realize this feeling that begins to flutter closer to your heart is radiating warmth, you find yourself smiling, you feel your breath start to hitch and a sigh escapes past your lips and the sudden realization hits you; you're in love.
"God, you're so beautiful," Steve whispered, leaning down and placing soft kisses against Tony's skin. He started at his hip bones that were always hugged by the jeans that he wore, his stomach soon being showered in kisses, causing him to giggle, his chest the last area to be touched by the soldier's lips, the area around the Arc Reactor being shown the most affection. "This thing in your chest, it's a part of you, and it's so beautiful. Everything about you is beautiful, please don't ever change." Tony smiled, ruffling the blonde's hair.
However, the one thing he didn't prepare for, or suspect himself to care for, was the sleeping super-soldier on the couch. Simply hearing Jarvis announce that Steve was experiencing a nightmare, a bad one too, was enough to drive the genius from his shelter in the lab to seek out Steve's room and make sure he was ok. It left this weird light feeling in his chest; which to him sounded crazy, considering there was something actually
It's the way he looks so sincere when he tells him these words, that once more he believes him. He brings his lips onto him in a softer, more chaste kiss. He lays back with Tony against his chest, their lips still attached as they kiss slowly, savoring the moment. And when he pulls back, he looks into those beautiful brown eyes of his lovers and says those same five words he told him yesterday.
It's that simple fact that makes a big smile break out onto his face, and a small giggle erupts from the depths of his stomach because Tony is finally
While he sees nothing but darkness, he can still hear everything around him. He hears the elevator ding, as well as the doors opening to let them inside. They ding once more as the doors close, and he can feel the little ounce of gravity elevators temporarily have when they move up or down. In this case, gravity is temporarily weighing him down, so he knows that they're heading towards the upper floor, where the common area is.
"Jarvis said you were having a nightmare, a pretty bad one it looks like." He doesn't move, nor does he speak as the genius runs a hand over his damp forehead, fingers getting lost in his blonde locks. The touch makes his eyes flutter for a moment, a warm feeling courses through his vein at the sweet, comforting form of contact Tony gives him. He watches as the genius stands and says, "I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get you some water." His hand shoots out, quicker than lighting, halting the Iron Man from leaving his room.
"Morning sleepyhead." He said. Steve stretched and turned his head towards Tony, smiling as the brunette made his way over towards him.
"Tony I didn't mean to, I didn't know this was a trap. It was just a simple reconnaissance mission, I didn't know there was anybody here." I explained to him. His grip seemed to loosen up a bit, and I took in a shaky breath. Why was he so different? Why was he so mad at me? I know he cares about my well-being, but this feels so different. "I'm sorry I disappointed you or even upset you. Please, can you untie me so we can just go home?"
"Ready as I'll ever be." Tony reengaged his helmet and walked over towards the hangar's ramp, waiting for it to open. He heard Steve walkway, then two new sets of footsteps took his place, coming right next to him. It was Thor, the God of Thunder simply sending a comforting pat on his back. The ramp opened, and Tony could feel the familiar rush he always got when he used the suit. It's similar to how a skydiver might feel; that quick rush of adrenaline you get when you jump out of a plane and free fall, the wind whipping your hair in many directions, the gust of wind contorting to your body, your sensories are on overload as your brain is still stuck on the image of you on the plane, long after you have already jumped out. Tony loved this feeling, he was always in control when he flew around in the suit, he remembers the first time he tested his Iron Man suit.
"Hey!" He said enthusiastically upon seeing Steve's face on the holographic screen portrayed from his Stark Phone.
He wasn't sure if he was dreaming or not, considering he's been more or less sleep-deprived this week, but he could feel the ghostly touch of fingers carding themselves through his hair. It couldn't have been from anybody next to him, it was at a weird angle, so it had to be from someone in front of him, or at the very least sitting on Tony's bed. His eyes fluttered open and he slowly lifted his head, eyes partially open and the world blurry. He rubbed his eyes, correcting his vision as everything came into focus.
"What I was going to say before I was rudely interrupted," he glared at the genius, "is that if we cannot get in contact with Thor, then we need to devise a plan with what limited resources we have."
He closed his eyes in defeat shortly after watching Loki's scepter being raised in the air, knowing that there was no way out of this. Is this truly the way he was going from this world? What more could he do, in his damaged state. It'll hurt Steve at first when he's gone because everybody that Steve has come to know and love leave him, but eventually he'll move on. He'll cope is what Tony is hoping for after he dies, and it's selfish, he knows, but he's weak and damaged, with no control over his mind due to the scepters exposure, and all he can do is pray that things will work out.
He felt like Tony walked all over him, broke his heart, kicked him around a few times, and worst of all was taking his anger out on the soldier. In a way, he felt like this was Tony's own personal way of getting back at him for what he had done, and he would blame him for it, but that doesn't make it right. Steve will gladly take responsibility for his own actions and say that he, from an obvious unbiased standpoint, messed up,
