Dean looks down at the kids and tells them, “Wait here, while I go in and talk to your papa for a minute.”
Half of his closet was laid out on his bed. Why was he so nervous? He never had this much trouble finding something to wear when he was going out with Dean before.
He doesn’t hear the car that pulls up in front of the house and parks on the street. So, he doesn’t worry about the fact that Ishim is watching the house.
“People in charge,” Dean continues, “tend to panic and run around in confused circles, and at that moment we strike.”
“Hey, Cas, it's me Dean. You’re safe, look.” Dean had a handful of glow bracelets in his hand and was lighting them up. He fashioned a few into necklaces and put them on Cas, putting the others on his own wrist. “See, I brought some light for you. Feel better?”
Cas looks at his watch to double-check the date, “You’re home a day early.”
Claire meets the woman’s eyes shakily and accepts the bottle of water she’s holding out to her gratefully, “I d-don’t know, them, those people… I don’t…”
The horrific sound doesn’t stop until the bucket is at its final height. Castiel stands there gaping up at the sight; he can’t quite wrap his sleepy brain around what was happening. So he just stares. Standing barefoot and shirtless on his front lawn, watching a man in a bucket raised high above a large, loud truck.
“You.”
They arrive at the picturesque resort, thank the hired driver with a generous tip, and are met by the resort greeter. They are barely able to take in the breathtaking beauty of the place as they are shown to their suite, which is adorned with bright exotic plants. The kids start exploring right away, fighting light-heartedly over the two single bedrooms, for the one with the best view of the sea. Dean and Cas walk into the master bedroom, dropping their bags and sharing an intimate moment where they embrace and whisper of their love for each other before they begin helping the kids unpack.
“I’m talking about whoever you’re pinin’ over. You need to nut up and talk to them.”
“Can Cas come over here, then?”
Castiel removes his fingers from Dean’s mouth and down to between his legs, he circles Dean’s hole, wetting it before sliding a finger inside him. Dean arches up off the bed, groaning and squirming as Castiel stretches him carefully around his finger, soon adding a second. Castiel lavishes this tormenting attention on to Dean for another few minutes, listening to Dean’s breathy pants and fighting the urge to touch his own straining cock. Only when Dean is writhing beneath him, clearly beginning to lose control and ever so slightly starting to thrust himself into Castiel’s mouth, does Castiel finally pull away. His cheeks are flushed pink and his eyes are dark with longing.
The injury to his leg and the puncture wound to his chest cause Castiel to scream out in pain when the man begins to pull on him. He tries to stop, he knows Claire is nearby and can see him. He doesn’t want her to worry about him, but it’s too much. He has never felt anything like it before. His chest feels hot and sharp, as though there is a spear impaling him and making it hard to breathe. The wound on his leg feels massive, he imagines the pain would be similar to that if someone had taken a cheese grater to the area and just scraped at him until there was nothing left but bone.
“You’re welcome, Jack. You have a set of goalposts at home too, it was just a bit too big to bring on holiday. But we can set them up when we get home, alright?” Jack nods, his eyes bright with joy, “I’m sure we’ll all have lots of fun with the ball on holiday though. We can set up a game later, can’t we?”
“You’re new client is here. Want me to have one of the clerks bring him over or do you want to come meet him?” Chuck asks, also hinting at how busy the store is and how it would be easier if Dean came to get the guy.
Dean smiles at Cas and silently asks if the serious talk is over. Cas barely holds back a roll of his eyes and leans close giving Dean a kiss. Dean grabs his daughter's hand and they take off at a sprint toward the water.
“W-what’s this?” Cas asks, confused and stunned to see Mick, not to mention a little put out as he wasn’t expecting the man to turn up unannounced.
Cas (Wednesday 7:48 PM) No. I’m staying here for now. I need time to heal and to think about things. Please don’t call or text me. I’m okay, really. I just need to be here for a little while.
“Now, we wait for the moment of extreme confusion and then you start cleaning your way to the security office, and don’t let go of this bucket.”
By sunset, no help had come and Dean realizes he and Jack are in for a rough night. He asks Jack to count the glistening stars above them to keep him busy and to keep his mind off their bleak situation. Dean watches his son’s eyes light up in wonder as he excitedly points out more and more stars as they start to appear in the darkening sky.
Dean huffs out a laugh, “Can’t it be both? Just because I was trying to be charming, doesn’t mean it was dishonest,” he turns his head slightly to look down into Castiel’s face, “You’re the most stunning work of art I’ve ever seen, Castiel. You’re worth more than any of the valuable pieces in this building, you’re worth more than the sun, or the moon… you’re rapidly becoming my whole damn world…”
The old man talking at him through his speakers (who Castiel always pictured to look like Bob Ross due to his calming voice and gentle nature) was giving the latest news in the art world “The painting ‘Cupid and Psyche’ by Guillaume Seignac has just been purchased at auction…”
“I think another hour or so, thereabouts.” says Cas sympathetically as he glances at his watch, “Why don’t you try and get some sleep?”
“See you in the morning, Gabe,” Cas says as he turns around and heads past him toward the stairs. He takes off his jacket and lets it fall from his hand as though his brain had simply forgotten that he was meant to hold onto it.
Cas does as he’s told, anything for some relief. He rubs his thumb over his slit and begins jerking himself. Closing his eyes as he shivers all over, it feels so good.
I hope you enjoyed this time spent with our boys as much as I enjoyed writing it.
“Sap.”
It's the final chapter!
Her baby brother could be annoying at times, he might occasionally break her toys, or scribble all over one of her drawings - but she loves him. He is sweet and gentle and loves animals and when they do play together, he always shares with her. They look after each other when they are poorly, Jack sometimes even lets Claire borrow his favorite teddy…
Thank goodness it's not a long drive to get to the house. Less than twenty minutes later, Castiel is trying to unlock the door with Dean pressed against his back, kissing his neck.
“Well, I’ve had a long day, and I’m going to head on up to paint for a while before it gets too late. Will you be staying in tonight?”
They make out lazily until they fall asleep cuddling.
, stop?” Castiel asks, in a low voice when the waitress turns to walk away.
Dean barks out a laugh, knowing the game is over. They both enjoy their burgers, and they each get a slice of pie for dessert.
“Bye Sammy.”
“Ysss.” Dean breaths out.
Dean just smiles back at him and Castiel thinks with relief that they may finally be getting somewhere.
The care that Castiel had shown him after accidentally shooting him was truly endearing. He can’t actually believe how lucky he was, how many other people would have stopped to talk to some stranger, who’d broken into their house in the middle of the night?  Castiel had been afraid, but he’d faced his fear, he had been firm but he had also been kind, he had injured Dean, but he’d cared for him too… Dean couldn’t help but feel that Castiel had something so rare and special inside him and it was part of what made Dean want to help him because he was such a gentle and genuine person. Dean had known that night that… that, what? They could be friends? Maybe, but that’s not quite the feeling that he had. From the moment that  Cas had touched his arm with those long slender fingers, Dean had wanted to kiss the man.
Dean stands frozen, face pale, hands shaking slightly and eyes fixed on where Castiel is standing across the room... His heart shattered into a thousand pieces as his eyes fell on the man holding Castiel's hand. He was looking at Castiel with the same expression that Castiel use to look at Dean with. That longing, that joy...
"Yeah, Cas I am. I hear you," says Dean, fighting the impulse to roll his eyes. He’d wanted this evening to be special, romantic. He didn’t understand how it had come to this, so he smiled at a waitress? Big deal? What’s he supposed to do, be a miserable bastard to everyone but Cas?
Cas smiles a sad smile. “Doc says that his brain scan shows that he’s in a sort of dream state, I hope it’s a happy dream. The way they talk about the scans, it appears that there are only peaks of anxiety, and most of the time he’s steady, with an activity present - so at least we know that his brain isn’t completely broke. I just really want him to wake up, I miss him so much.”
Across the bottom of the flyer are the hours and the address. Dean notices the writing on the back.
“Hey, uh, Cas,” Dean looks over at him, “I’m going to be workin’ the next three days. Are you gonna be okay here alone?”
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas acknowledges softly.
Dean listened, eyes wide in disbelief. “Really?”
“Dad! You’re back!” he calls, then Dean’s heart breaks as he sees his son's eyes scanning the rest of the room, searching for his papa and sister. When Jack’s eyes finally meet his again, they’re sadder this time and Jack asks quietly, “You didn’t find them?”
Castiel hadn’t realized how on edge he used to feel all the time at ‘home’. Well, his old home, anytime Ishim was around Cas was filtering what he would say, always acting a certain way to keep Ishim happy, how had he not realized that it had made him utterly miserable.
He watched as Dean came in through the doors. Watched as he scanned the room and spoke to the hostess. She pointed him towards Cas and Cas noticed when Dean’s eyes found him. There was a smile that quickly came and went across Dean’s face. Dean walked up to the table (looking a little nervous in Castiel’s opinion) and greeted Cas.
Cas frowns at the thought of going to Ishim’s house and he realizes that he really does think of it as ‘Ishims house’ now, not his, not somewhere he ever really wants to visit again but he does need clothes now that he’s able to wear something other than gym shorts.
A nurse comes to Castiel’s bedside and gives the family a small sorrowful smile. “The doctors are ready for him in surgery. They are going to operate on his leg.”
When his name is finally called, Castiel goes through to see the doctor alone while Dean waits for him.
Relief that is short-lived, however, when he puts a hand up to his head and pulls it away sharply with a hiss upon feeling a hot, sticky substance coating his fingers. Looking at his hand under the glow of his flashlight, his stomach flips when he sees the blood - a lot of blood. He has cut his head open and is bleeding badly.
Dean is only now realizing these feelings, coming to grip with them.
Jack laughs as Dean bends over and pulls a funny face while he does one long inhale through his nose, then Dean nods and smiles, confirming to his husband who is standing next to him with an amused expression on his face, “Minty fresh.”
“What?”
“Was I flirting? I don’t think I was flirting. I was just being friendly.” Dean grins at Cas with a playful smirk.
Cas pulls out his phone and shows sam the texts from Ishim. “I haven’t replied. I don’t want him to know where I am, but I think I should let him know I’m alive at least. What do you think? Should I message him, what should I say?”
“You’re saved, jerk. Do your thing.” Dean calls to his little brother.
“Gabe.” Cas tries to get his attention as he rattles on about who was there and with whom, “Gabe will you listen to me?” he tries again with no luck, “Gabe, I caught a burglar!” he says again, more forcefully this time.
“Me? Where the hell were you!? You said that you weren’t going anywhere!” Claire sobs as she reaches for her papa’s hand, taking it and feeling the cool skin of his palm against her own. He is real, he is alive. Claire laughs through her tears, “You’re really here!”
Gabe chokes on his drink and gawks at Cas.
Claire closes her eyes and holds onto Castiel tightly, soon they both drift off into a more restful slumber.
The boys raided the kitchen before Sam and Cas got started on their paper.  Gabe followed Dean out to the garage.
They spend the evening talking about Jess and debating what a nice welcome home gift from Sam could be. Cas suggests flowers but Sam says that Jess is more of a ‘don’t pick them, it kills them’ kind of girl, which makes Castiel smile. After a while they land on a small box of chocolates and a bracelet, that Sam says he will get the next day.
“Snob.”
Cas never expected anything to come of his crush anyway. I mean, come on, Dean Winchester — Captain of the baseball team, lead pitcher, MVP three years in a row, owner of a totally badass muscle car, has a grown-up part-time job, honor roll and earning a full ride to KSU. Who at their school didn’t have a crush on Dean? But Cas knew the real Dean, the Dean at home, how he takes care of Sam and still, with all the stuff he accomplishes, was able to be such a good person.
The man smiles at him as though he somehow knows he has just turned Castiel’s entire world upside down with a single kiss, “By the way, my name is Dean, it was nice to meet you Castiel.”
“Well, he needs at least one beer - for toasting.” Gabe snipped back.
Dean can’t finish his lunch. He bids Bobby farewell and walks back to his car.
Dean turns to Cas and places a hand on his shoulder, “Anything else you want, we can come get once you find a place to live. I mean, I’m just guessing you don’t want to stay here.”
“Put it in your pocket or rub it on your skin for a minute, that way it will pick up some of your scents. Show Casey what you have and name it for her.”
“Where have you been?” Dean asks looking at Cas with wide eyes.
Castiel laughs and tugs at Dean’s shorts, “They are a little
“Eyes closed, Cas, no peeking. This time everyone closes their eyes. This is a special spin for the honor of seven minutes with the birthday boy!”
“Please Cas? I need you… I need you to wake up, to be ok. The kids are here, they’re safe, but they… we are all worried about you.” Dean squeezes his eyes shut and more tears fall, he has trouble forming coherent words as he begs his husband to wake up. “We need you to come back to us, alright? I need you to come back. You can’t leave me like this. Please, open your eyes, please wake up, please, please, please… just… say something? Anything…”
Cain moves in sinuous motions, flexing as he slips out of his shirt and after a few moves he tosses his hard hat behind him on the stage. He climbs the pole hand over hand to the top then holds himself straight out from the pole before slowly bringing himself down and humping against it. Moving continuously to the music. He does a backflip and gently rolls his whole body against the floor, grinding his hips to the music. Kicking off his boots as he stands and slowly unzipping his jeans, letting them slide to his ankles and does a handstand to kick them off, then he gyrates wearing only a small green g-string.
Cas gets up and grabs his t-shirt from the floor, wiping the mess off Dean, tossing the shirt back to the floor in a ball.  He lays down beside Dean and props up on his elbow, looking at Dean, smiling and tracing random patterns on Dean’s chest. Dean pulls him down for a kiss.
“I’m ok,” sobs Claire against her dad's shoulder, “I love you!”
“Here put these on.” says Dean, passing Castiel the bag.
“Not just looking - she’s really watching, intently.”
“Yeah, and I could get hit by a bus downtown. Cas, the Army will put me through school. I can learn to be a real good mechanic.”
It wasn't not long before they heard Gabe's old beater car rumbling up the driveway. Sam opened the door and greeted the brothers, ushering them into the house.
“Soon, I hope. I need to rest, a little longer,” Castiel looks at his daughter seriously, “I need you to promise me, you won’t go anywhere. Stay right here, okay? If you see anyone, tell me. Do not try to reach them on your own. Understand?”
Castiel shakes his head, looking up at the house, “No. I don’t. Besides, I couldn’t afford this place on my own, even if I did want to stay. I’m going to find an apartment. Sam has helped me narrow it down to three places that we are going to visit this weekend.”
Dean presses his lips to the top of Castiel’s head lightly and whispers, “There is nowhere else I’d rather be. Come on, we’re so close Cas, let’s do this together...”
“Dammit, Cas.”
“Babe, you don’t have to pick today. But you do need to choose one soon.”
“You should wait until your dad comes back, so you don’t get lost. Can you hold it?” The other boy says, standing up to look about them for Dean.
“Come see my show tonight?” Cas asks quietly.
“It’s alright sweetheart, I’m sorry it took so long to work out what had happened.” the volunteer watches as Claire climbs carefully up onto the end of her papa’s bed and hugs her arm around his uninjured leg, “I’ll let you two get some rest now. Take care of your papa.”
“That’s it, baby. You belong to me.” Ishim smirks and holds up his phone. “Take your cock in hand and look this way.”
They watch him as he makes his way to the far corner of the room. He speaks to the bouncer at the door and next thing they know, he’s being let in. They gape at each other then both bark out laughter.
“Oh good. “ The man smiles and it’s beautiful. “MY ASL is not very good, I’m afraid.” He signs, “My ASL is bad.”
“Oh. OH.” Bobby grasps the situation. “So, you turned tail and ran.” Not quite a question, more a statement. Bobby knows Dean too well.
“Yeah, I gotta get used to you guys being about half a day ahead of us. It's evening here.”
Bill and Dean finish their assignments for the day and head back to the office. By the time Dean parked the truck and got inside, everyone knew about his little invitation. He just smiles and asks if anyone else had received a personal invite from a sexy dancer. That shut up those teasing him and made a few others laugh along with Dean. It’s nothing but basic ‘locker room’ teasing, and Dean can handle it, he’s close to the guys he works with and considers most of them to be friends. They all work a dangerous job and have to be able to depend on each other for safety and back up.
“Alright, fine. I’m off that night anyway.”
He holds the base of Dean’s dick steady with one hand, drawing his other up and down the shaft several times before he is no longer able to resist lowering his mouth to it. He licks over the tip, with the flat of his tongue, enjoying the way Dean quivers below him. His free hand teasing and massaging again at Dean’s balls.
“Fine. You win. Where are we going?”
The spark of a smile he’d had at her words fades into serious concern. Castiel wouldn’t let their daughter wander around by herself… not unless he couldn’t go with her. Dean’s eyes flick between his two children, they were both here and they were fine…
Dean takes Castiel to his favorite diner for lunch. He doesn’t mention that little fact when Cas remarked about what a quaint little place it is and how much he liked it.
Dean wakes too early; the sun is barely peeking through the curtains when the breeze catches them.
“Fine, you know what? Let’s uber this bitch, ‘cause I ain’t gonna be DD for you boys.” Charlie decides. “I’ll call for a car and pick you two idiots up on the way.”
“Hey, Cas,” Sam speaks up getting his attention during the commercial break, “So, I know Dean probably wasn’t much help to you, but will you be alright here by yourself over the next couple of days? Dean will be at work for three days before he’s off again, so he won’t be around.”
“What-” Cas is holding his hands over his ears and is about to shout at Dean over the sound of the alarm but Dean puts his hand over Castiel’s mouth and leans in against him in the tiny space.
“Fuck, Cas, I’m… guh…” Dean stammers just before he comes.
“Where were you staying?” The woman asks as she kneels beside Claire, “Do you remember the name?”
“Look,” Claire says and she points ahead of them, turning large hopeful eyes to her papa, “That big tree. We could climb up in that tree and rest, it would be safe if another wave comes.”
Thick mud squelches between bare toes as a man with a bloody rag wrapped around his arm treads carefully through a destroyed building. A building that only yesterday morning had stood proud and beautiful as ‘The Orchid Beach Resort’. The man's bloodshot eyes land on a familiar red ball that is rolling over the ground a little way ahead of him, pushed along by the gentle breeze. He sighs, his heart feeling heavy as he remembers how well the trip had started and how quickly it had turned into this terrifying nightmare.
“I hope you had it insured.” Cas sighs. “And thanks for the kind gesture, Gabe but I’m happy with mine. I hope you are able to sell it for more than you paid for it.”
Dean gathers himself, forcing his fears for his family deep down, he leaves his post on the slanted rooftop and trudges back to the other side of the resort, feeling defeated and exhausted. The once beautiful resort is now in ruins. He takes the stairs up to one of the rooms, where there is a piled up stack of rickety furniture, that leads up to a hole in the roof. He sets his foot down on a wobbly desk and tries to climb up but the makeshift ladder collapses under him and he falls with a yelp, tumbling down and crashing to the floor, letting out an ‘oof’ as the wind is knocked from him. Pain explodes in his chest and seems to spread like a firework going off inside him, it shoots through him like electricity and he curses loudly. With a low groan, he lets his head drop back against the floor.
Sitting down on the floor just outside the doors, Dean and his two brave children wait.
“So, don’t ever do that again,” says Dean shaking his head at his husband, “‘cause we need you.”
“Well, y'all can stuff it. I like my shorts.” Dean huffs and looks back at his husband in mock betrayal, “Where did my loving support go?”
They look around the gallery together for a little while before Dean stealthily sneaks behind a velvet rope barrier by the stairs and unlocks the broom closet he’d noticed on their last visit. He had seen where the guard hung the key, and he insured their safety by putting a small strip of tape over the bolt so that the door to the closet would close but not lock back in place.
Cas talked to Benny. What did Benny tell him? Have they stayed in touch like Dean and Benny? Questions swirl around in Dean’s mind.
“Ishim was here because of me, he could have...”
The colossal wall of water crashes over the trees and buildings and swamps the swimming pool area. It swallows Dean and Jack right before Castiel’s eyes.
Dean’s eyes widen with frightened panic, his throat seems to tighten and even though Castiel’s not looking at him, he shakes his head vehemently, “I am not leaving here without you! Do you understand me? I’m not going anywhere. I just got you back, I’ll never lose you again.” Dean knows he sounds desperate, but he doesn’t care, he would walk over white-hot coals to get Castiel home safely.
----------X----------
Standing squashed closely together, they listen as the guards walk around the gallery checking that everyone had left. Cas and Dean wait in nervous silence, they’re standing so close together that they avoid eye-contact with each other for a short while. However, a sound on the other side of the door but close by forces their eyes to meet in a mutual moment of panic. Shifting slightly Dean brings a finger to his lips and silently ‘shhs’ Castiel, who is looking back at him with wide, fearful eyes. Dean drops the hand that had been raised to his mouth, to Castiel’s shoulder and gives it a gentle squeeze as he smiles at him reassuringly.
Cas reaches between his legs to stroke himself but Ishim pushes his hand away.
Cas holds Dean’s gaze and studies him closely, “It’s okay, it wasn’t your fault and it doesn’t hurt.” He meets Dean’s lips with his own for another heated kiss before he pulls back and sinks to his knees with a playful but sultry look on his face. His nails scrape lightly down the front of Dean’s shirt and he pulls it loose from his jeans as he descends to the ground in front of him.
No matter how much Dean complains or argues; Castiel will always be there to protect him.
Castiel gave Dean a shy smile, thinking about the note he tucked away in his nightstand.
Castiel just rolls his eyes and takes a drink of his own beer. It’s not the first time they’ve argued over Dean’s flirty nature.
Over two millennia later, Castiel watches over a small boy whose mother is trapped in a house fire. The boy makes it out of the house with his baby brother. Castiel wants to reach down and help the child.
“So, you’re worried about this stranger’s feelings? Man, you’re weird.”
Just as Cas was about to reply, the waitress brings their food order. “Here you go guys, enjoy your dinner.” She smiles at Cas and bats her eyes flirtatiously. Dean adjusts his plate and looks up at her.
“What?” she asked cautiously.
“Yes!”
“Ishim.” Castiel whines, not wanting to know what Ishim could do with a video like that.
“Left foot Red! Gabe called.
Cas watches Ishim leave, he stretches, feeling the ache in his backside, and frowns. Getting up carefully he wipes his ass clean on the sheet and puts on a clean pair of underwear. Then he strips the bed and cleans the floor. As he is putting the sheets in the washer, his stomach grumbles and he remembers the Chili’s meal still sitting on the table. He walks into the kitchen just in time to see Ishim throwing away the empty dish from the takeout.
Dean meets the nurse's eyes with fear, but knowing that Claire and Jack are listening, he just nods his understanding and they all follow as Castiel is wheeled away on his bed. The watch, each holding their breath as he is taken behind swinging doors into the operating room.
“But, I left you…” Dean shakes his head. “I don’t think I can ever say I’m sorry enough. I could have lost you forever and all over my stupid pride.”
“How’s he taking all this?” asks Sam quietly.
“Because I do worry about my best bud. I have no trouble hooking up. But you have been single too long.” Charlie reminds him. “Since… dude, since Aaron. Am I right?”
Castiel wakes up with a start, instantly aware that his throat is constricting. He struggles to take in a breath and makes disturbing retching sounds. His eyes look panicked and suddenly, he’s choking. Claire is by his side and yelling for help and a nurse quickly rushes over and rolls him to his side. As he starts gagging and trying to breathe, he clutches the side of the bed for support. Feeling his injuries pulling horribly as his whole body convulses. Coughing and gasping, he is desperate for some air. Even though he can hear Claire shouting his name and crying, he can’t respond. He feels large awful chunks of things coming up his throat and vomits out a frightening dark, bloody liquid. Bringing up seaweed and debris from the floodwater he had swallowed, while his stomach clenches painfully to help his body rid itself of the sickening detritus.
“Oh, okay.” Cas nods dumbly, “Thank you.”
Cas nodded his understanding and leans down resting the side of his cheek on Dean’s shoulder, “Do you really think that I’m…”
“I’m not.” Dean retorts less than smoothly. But then he thinks about Castiel’s texts again and can’t help the smile that spreads over his face, his cheeks heat up when he catches Benny glancing over at him.
Jack knocks the ball over Claire’s head and she climbs out of the pool to chase it down. She smiles when she grabs the ball and looks back at her Papa and waves to him. Claire runs towards Castiel and gently throws the ball to him, encouraging him to play. Smiling, Castiel sits up and tosses the ball back in the pool towards Jack, it hits the water and bounces behind him towards the other end of the pool and Jack excitedly turns and swims after it.
So much so that Dean had even agreed with Cas around the four month mark of their relationship, that it was time they announced to their family and friends that they were together. Having never been in a relationship long enough to declare it before, Dean had found himself feeling slightly nervous to tell his brother that not only did he have a boyfriend, but that it was getting pretty serious. Castiel, for his part, informed Dean several times that he didn’t have to tell his family yet if he wasn’t ready but Dean waved him off and told him in no uncertain terms that he was not ashamed of who he was and he was absolutely not ashamed of Castiel either.
Dean rolls down the window to try and get some fresh oxygen into the car. The heat outside is slightly less than the stifling heat inside the car. He leans his forehead against the steering wheel — such a fuck-up.
“Turn around.” Cas requests shyly.
“Claire loves to look at the stars,” Jack said softly. Not quite meeting his dad’s gaze as though afraid that it was somehow bad to bring up his missing sister.
Cas looks over at Claire when he hears her open the soda can, she takes a drink and hands it to him. He takes a small drink and hands it back to her, he can tell by the look on her face that she wants to argue. Likely to say something along the lines of ‘that he needs it more’ but he cuts her off with a shake of his head and lays back down against the rough bark of the tree. He can feel Claire watching over him as he rests.
‘How ‘bout a celebratory meal? I’m starving, how ‘bout you?”
Dean grins widely and pulls Castiel in more firmly, he kisses him even more deeply and his fingers wind themselves into Castiel’s hair. The light from the flashlight glints off Cas’s ring catching Dean’s eye, he sighs looking down at it.
In his mind Castiel sees Dean shaking his head,
“I love you, too, Cas.  But don’t you dare start saying your goodbyes! I mean it, I can’t do this alone. I need you! Please… please don’t leave me?”
Her mind distorts the picture, it betrays her with images of what her brother, papa, and dad might look like if they were in that hellish folder. Pain stabs at her heart like a white-hot poker running her through and her stomach lurches, twisting and churning.
The door finally opens, and Castiel laughs as he stumbles inside with Dean firmly gripping his hips. He closes the door behind them and turns to face Dean, pressing him against the door as he attacks Dean’s mouth. His fingers threading through Dean’s hair. Both giving as good as they get, neither wanting the kiss to end. Castiel traces one hand down Dean’s arm and laces their fingers together. Stepping back, he tugs Dean to follow him. Dean doesn't hesitate and allows Castiel to lead him to his bedroom.
“Brady,” the man answers. “Dude, you don’t even have a sound system.”
“God, I love… love the way you look right now.” Cas groans “So hot, so beautiful.”
Castiel stirs and Claire leans close, “Papa, you sleep. The volunteer told me that there is a list of people’s names downstairs. I’m going to go find the list of people here and look for Dad’s name. I won't be gone long.”
’ Dean thinks, how come he can’t control his face? “Mind your own business and drive. The house is on the next block.” Dean deliberately doesn’t look at Benny as he speaks, he doesn’t need to, he can feel his idiot friends smug smile lighting up the cab from where he is sitting without visual confirmation.
“Cassie,” Gabriel beams, welcoming his brother home with an energetic hug, “You’re not going to believe what I bought for you today!”
The sound of 50 Cent’s “Candy Shop” blasts from the speakers. Cain comes out dressed in loose jeans and a short-sleeve, unbuttoned plaid shirt, a hard hat and a tool belt around his waist.
“You’re right, Cas. Everything here seems to be brighter and more colorful than anything back home. Even after the plane ride, I’m so glad we came.” Dean leans over and gives Cas a kiss.
“Cas, you know it’s not that I don’t want you to be a part of Casey’s training, right?”
“The hell, Cas?” Dean stands and reaches for Castiel’s hand. Cas jerks his hand away. “Cas?”
“Shit, Cas… I’m close.” He pants breathlessly.
“One is all the kid needs, most of these kids don’t need more than one. I’m watching over Sam and Cas. I’m not gonna let you get them drunk tonight.”
“I received some good news today. Jess is coming back from working overseas with Doctors Without Borders. She’s been gone six weeks and I’ve really missed her.” Sam has been dating Jessica Moore for the past two years. She is a nurse and works at a retirement home in town, she has been working with Doctors Without Borders for the past three years and takes one trip each year.
“Dean?” Cas mumbles, opening his eyes and looking around.
something. He’ll just look for a few minutes, then return to his son - he can’t let Castiel, or Jack down like that. Just ten minutes.
After a breakfast of cold cereal, Dean showers and dresses for the day. He has therapy this morning. Lunch with Bobby. Something in the afternoon. What was it? Oh, errands. The bank and groceries.
The man turns away from Dean and bends over to root through a plastic bag, he pulls out a small bottle of water, as he begins pouring it carefully over the cut, he says “You know you shouldn’t be going out there at night, it’s too dark and dangerous. You have your son here, he is depending on you.”
“They’re still babies, Dean.” Cas sits up and faces Dean, “But, they’ve already started their training, this is just playtime.”
“Oh, yes, it is.” Cas says as strongly as his fear will let him, he pales as another thought pops into his mind, “A-are you armed?” The man just stares at him for a moment. “Do you have a gun?” Cas asks more firmly.
“I think I’ll have the iced tea as well,” Cas said, as he looked across the table at Dean with a small, fond smile.
“Well,” Cas says as he stares at the little girl in Dean’s lap.
They drive off toward the doctor’s office. Going in the opposite direction of where Ishim is parked.
Dean looks. His eyes go wide, and he nearly gasps. “I’ve seen him before! He runs in the mornings, and I almost bumped into him one day when I was walking to class.” He tells his friends.
Castiel squeezes Dean’s hand in his own, “What a pair we make? You thought I’d left you, I thought you’d left me… This comes back to me not trying to escape from confrontation, without saying something at the very least. As I said, Dean, I won’t make that mistake again.”
“This is ridiculous,” he tells himself after a couple of hours. Deciding he needs to get up and do something to take the edge off, he gathers the few clothes he has and his bedsheets and heads to the laundry room. He’s still awkward and unbalanced with the casts, but he feels like he needs to move. Once his things are in the washer, he goes to the kitchen and wipes the counters and tidies up what he can.
“You still have glitter in your hair.” Dean murmurs as he mouths just below Castiel’s ear.
Cas glanced up at Dean - had Dean broken his hand in anger? Just how angry can Dean get? He hit Sam in the arm, does he lash out and hit other things, other people? Cas is worried about inadvertently upsetting Dean, he doesn’t like seeing Dean angry.
He puts the flyer in his locker, planning to go to the club on Friday. He sure hopes Cain would be working.
Castiel remembers walking along the shoreline with his brother and seeing a little fish half out of the sea.
Castiel frowns at Ishim’s back as he leaves the kitchen. Turning to the cabinets, Cas pulls out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. He takes his sandwich and a glass of milk into the living room, where Ishim is now watching the news, he sits next to Ishim and quietly eats. When he finishes, he sets his empty glass on the coffee table and curls up next to his boyfriend.
“Your ass is so hot. All red with my cum all over it. Look, baby. Look how pretty I made you.” Ishim lays down beside Castiel and shows him the pictures he took. Cas wipes his eyes and nods.
Casey politely walks with the instructor to Dean, sitting at his feet when they exchange the lead.
Claire and her dad slam into each other, and Dean grasps her in his arms, picking her up and hugging her to his chest, as Jack stands beside them, wiping his tears from his face. Dean cries as he holds his little girl, kissing her tear-stained face and silently thanking whatever God might be listening for bringing her back to him. Jack comes up and holds onto Dean’s waist.
They both startle at the sound of the loud beeping of the smoke alarm in the kitchen.
After Castiel settles, looking pale but finally breathing more freely, the nurse gives him something to help him rest. Claire relaxes once she knows he is alright and sits at the side of his bed again, while he sleeps after being so ill. She listens to the sounds of his breathing in case it sounds like he might be sick again, his breaths are quick and shallow sounding.
Dean feels a lump in his throat, he wants to promise his son that they will find his papa and sister. But how can he make such a promise? He can’t even be sure that they are still alive. Looking down into his son’s wide eyes, he feels his heartbreak just a little more.
Castiel opens his eyes and focuses on the paper. He reads aloud. He reads the letterhead, to Mr. Castiel Novak, he reads every word of the greeting. Then he gets to the actual body of the letter, and he pauses. He turns and gives Dean a quick kiss. “For luck.”  And he reads the letter.
Cas is in the middle of dialing the police, but he freezes when he sees the painting.
“Besides, Dad, I don’t think we could ever lose you in those swim trunks.” Claire giggles as she points out Deans brightly colored shorts.
He rolls over and runs his hand up the curve of Cas’s side - hip to shoulder. Dean scoots closer and nuzzles into Cas’s neck, leaving sweet, gentle kisses, and whispers, “Mornin’ Babe.”
“And you look every bit as handsome as when we first met,” says Castiel sincerely.
“Yeah, I can imagine. I mean I don’t mind helping you wash your hair but I’m sure you’ll be glad when you can do that yourself.” Dean smiles. They continue to sit side by side and wait, Cas relaxing a little.
“Caaaseey - Where’s daddy’s keys?” Dean squats to talk to his dog. She looks behind her and back at Dean, tilting her head when he repeats, “Keys.” Dean wonders to himself if this is the equivalent of the dog rolling her eyes at him.
Dean and Casey are having a great time in class. The lesson is on finding and retrieving objects, and the pups think it’s the best game. The only thing that Dean has with him is his wallet, and that quickly turns into a chew toy in Casey’s eyes - because leather and Dean’s scent is the best thing ever - and she whines when he takes it away and doesn’t give it back. Retrieving his wallet will need to be a later lesson, it seems. One of the instructors gives Dean a dog-proof keychain, it’s made of woven paracord and is grey with a light pink trim.
“No, Papa! Dad and Jack are dead! We need to find help before you bleed to death! I need you here with me!” She cries out, scared that her words are true. Her eyes are bloodshot and tired, full of tears and pleading.
Castiel frowns slightly, “Why did you drive away?”
Cas took a shaky breath and realized he was crying, his eyes had misted over without his permission and it pissed him off that once again Ishim had made him cry. His whole body felt cold, his mind plaguing him with images of people watching him - doing that. People laughing. Ishim laughing as he’d sent the email. ‘
“One minute past nine. Now we know. They make their rounds hourly.” Dean wait a few minutes to make sure all the guards are back in the security office.
Dean swallows hard and tries to remain calm enough to greet the man. “Hey,” is all he can say without his voice cracking.
Castiel sends him the name and address of a coffee shop in town.
Claire pulls away from the woman and paces up and down the row between the beds trying to figure out what could have happened, where they could have taken him. Why will no one just tell her where he is? Her mind briefly entertains the idea that they are hiding him from her. Or that maybe he felt better and went to look for her… Maybe he just needed the toilet and he’d be back in a few moments.
Dean nods numbly and the pain rushes through his scalp, suddenly he feels light-headed and has to sit down. The man kneels beside him, concerned. Dean looks up at the man with pleading eyes and a serious expression, “I need to ask you something… If... if anything happens to me, will you, will you please keep my boy safe? Will you make sure he gets home, to my brother… Sam. Make sure he gets to Sam Winchester. Please?”
Jack opens his other gift, “Oh, a ball! We can play with this at the pool! Thank you, Papa!”
Castiel grips Claire’s swimsuit and doesn’t let go - he will not lose her, he
The club closes at two in the morning, so Castiel is usually finished with his closing process and out of there by three. He heads to the twenty-four-hour diner for a lite meal and coffee before heading to the local high school track - which is always lit and has a police station right next door. After the track, he goes to the gym. By the time that others start arriving at for usual morning workouts, he is already plenty sweaty and typically being ogled by housewives and grandmas. Once he’s finished his workout, he takes a quick shower and hits the tanning bed - well, about every third day, just enough to make sure he doesn’t have tan lines. By nine o’clock he’s ready to go home.
“More than any of the pieces of art in this whole place, Cas,” says Dean with sincerity.
Dean shook his head at his past self’s mistakes and finally looked up into Cas’s eyes and spoke, “What were you going to say before the waitress came over?”
“Where is he? Where’s my papa?” Finding her voice, she screams at a passing nurse, and the volunteer from earlier rushes over to come and quieten her down. She is distraught and furious and now that she’s started, she can’t seem to stop crying. Hands land on her arms and shoulders, trying to stop her shaking, to calm her down. But she doesn’t want to calm down, she fights with the two women trying to help her, refusing to be soothed, “He was right here! Where did he go? What have you done to him!?”
Suddenly, the light is far too bright and he hears his daughter screaming at him.
Dean gets up with a grunt and begins to restack the furniture, testing it for stability as he goes. Once he feels it’s safe, he helps Jack climb up first then follows, slowly and carefully, climbing up to the roof to join the rest of the survivors who are waiting warily for help to come.
"Whatever, Dean."
"Looks delicious," he lied. His plate had a veggie burger on whole wheat bread with a very large lead of lettuce sticking out, and there was a bowl of salad on his right. A glass of water filled with too much ice seemed to be the only drink available, and he was too nervous to ask for a beer or soda.
Mary squatted and brought her arms underneath her son's armpits and tried to get him up. Dean had slumped his body, going limp in his mother's arms.
When Cas would call Dean over to his apartment, they would start their evening by watching a movie on Dean's laptop, and either order food or cook something. Usually they would do it together. Cooking with him was always an enjoyable experience. The older man knew his way around a kitchen, and he was always smiling no matter what they were making. They would talk, of course, but never about anything too deep; just funny stories about their childhoods or something that happened at work. Although one time, Castiel ended up talking about the last time he saw his mother, Hester, and he allowed Dean to hold him as he cried. She was not the nicest woman, and the burn scars on Cas's thighs were proof of that.
Charlie nodded slowly. "Uh huh. Right. Well, uh, I'll help you guys with the bags. Dinner should be ready in fifteen."
The other boy pointed past the second slide and towards the garden. Jack's uncles were sitting on one of the benches by the garden, Dean with his head on Cas's lap and the two holding hands. "They remind me of my mom and Gabriel."
Cas raised his eyebrows. "Do tell."
Inside the warmth of the house, the radiator clanged periodically while the rain pounded the windows and the wind whistled loudly outside. Sam and his Uncle Bobby were arguing on the couch, Sam wanting to monitor the weather on the news, while Bobby was more interested in The Golden Girls marathon on TVLand. His parents were in the kitchen, eating what was either to them late breakfast or early lunch, an unappetizing scent coming from that direction. His Aunt Ellen and cousin Daniel were at dining room table trying to help Jo, Daniel's twin, with an assignment from one of her community college courses. Papers and notebooks were scattered on the table and Jo had a thin book clutched tightly in her hands.
"So guys," Cas started, cutting up his omelet. "Did you decide what you wanna do today?" He could hear Dean open the refrigerator.
Legs kicking in the water and feet barely grazing the slimy bottom, Dean swam towards Cas. He kept hid slightly blurry gaze on Castiel's lips. Dean gave the man a quick peck, and pulled back, looking into his eyes.
Claire ran her eyes between Jack and Maggie. The two were wearing matching polar bear shirts and black pajama bottoms. "You mean you guys aren't dating?"
When Dean served himself, he grabbed two waffles and started scooping different fruits onto his plate. He stopped, seemed to realize something, and stared at Castiel while he dumped the fruit onto Gabriel's plate. Gabe, confused, gestured to the food questioningly, but Dean didn't look at him, so he mumbled "Whatever" and picked at it.
"Tiger is the best character," Jack stated, licking peanut butter off his finger.
"Oh. Uhm. Sure." He could hear his uncle's heart beating faster and he thought that was a good sign. Miracle watched in confusion when he started moving his paws around.
The two spoke excitedly to one another, gesturing wildly with their hands and finishing each other's sentences. Gabriel looked over at Stevie, who was staring at Charlie with complete adoration in her eyes. He turned his gaze towards Castiel, who had his chin propped in his hands, elbows on the table and dangerously close to his plate of hot food, staring at Dean with the same expression, and Gabe felt a pang in his heart.
"And you don't think I'm trting to change you or anything? Because I'm not. I love you exactly as you are, I just want you to live for a long time with me. Humans can die from anything. You could get a heart attack or an infection or-"
"Then am I to assume you are free for a date?"
"But my breath will smell good," he pointed out. Taking the candy out, he gave her a serious look and lowered his voice. "Listen, Kells. Last night, I'm sorry about all that. I know I bummed you out."
It wasn't like Dean didn't notice things about him before, like the head tilt or that cute squinting thing. It was different things he saw now that they were together; Like when Cas would walk into the kitchen in the morning and Jack was hunched over eating whatever healthy crap Sam was making him eat he would touch his hair as he walked by. Or after a hunt he would hold Dean a little tighter at night. Or when Sam showed him something in a book Cas would lightly grip his right shoulder as he leaned over to look.
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose. "I just... Can there be a day or even a hour where you act mature?"
Gabriel nodded. "Got it."
"Listen at the door!"
"Bela Talbot," the head of the council said, "you are charged with fraud, theft, two counts of murder, three counts of  attempted murder, and one count of suspected murder. Do you have anything to say?"
Dean nodded toward it. "You like rainbows?"
"Hey!" he exclaimed, annoyed. "Don't do that. I could've fallen in."
"I'm gonna catch you," Kevin called out from behind him.
"He didn't find him?"
Dizzy and cold, Dean blinked rapidly as the world tilted in front of him. Groaning, he put a hand on the roof of the Impala to steady himself. Goosbumps rose along his arms as the warmth of the sun hit his freezing body. Miracle jumped out and started pawing at his leg, whining.
"I..." Dean rubbed the back of his neck. "F-forgot  to open it."
A yawn from the kitchen's entryway had Castiel turning around, feeling anxious. He relaxed when he saw who it was.
He looked at her suspiciously. "Really?"
"Dean?" a deep male voice said.
"Not that you haven't been good company," she insisted. "Jack likes you just as much as Cas."
"Do you come here a lot?" Cas asked as his eyes ran down the menu. "The hostess knew your name."
"No, he'll die," Jack replied seriously.
His cousin was on the couch, tapping away on her phone.  Some Ryan Reynolds movie was playing quietly on the TV.
Soon a snowball fight started, Jack and Cas versus the other three. They ran around the lawn, careful to avoid the decorations, and Gabriel could see the joy in his brother's face. He hadn't been this happy in awhile.
"Yeah," Dean agreed, nodding. "Also May second."
❤💚💙💚💙💚💙❤
Cas put a hand on his husband's thigh and gave him a soft look. "I know you're his father just as much as I am."
👨🏼🚒❤🧑🏻⚕️
"Yeah." He stopped touching Miracle and wrapped his arms around Cas.
Jack sat up straight.  "No! I was kidding! Please don't be mad." His heart started pounding in his chest.
"I'm not doing anything," Sam said innocently.
Dean shot his dad a glare that was ignored and herded his brother and cousin away from the several rows of chairs, maneuvering them between the crowds of people. They had been at the water park for a little over two hours before Jo started to complain how hungry she was, which made Dean realize his stomach was growling at him.
Sam sighed. "Can't think of any reason why Cas would be mad at you? At all?"
"She is vibrant and lovely. You should show your elders some respect."
"He left at like 7," she answered, mouth full of omelet.
Through the haze of his pot filled and sex focused brain, Dean remembered he had never taken Cas to his place, never even told him where he lived. A half second after he had this realization, Castiel tripped over something on the floor and they both landed on the carpet.
As soon as he was out of the room the questions started. Charlie and her wife, Stevie, were the ones asking and they spoke over each other so it was impossible for Cas and Kelly to answer them.
Cas furrowed his brow. "I've been wearing this for three weeks. You were standing right next to me when Jack gave it to me."
"Oh. Well, okay then." The night before, when him and Sam were about to play Battleship and eat chocolate chip cookies, his mom had waddled in from her bedroom and told them the baby was coming. Sam called Dean and Cas over from the other building and the second they came in him and Jack's mom had taken off for the hospital.
Cas smiled at him, shy again. "Wanna show me how?"
"Five?... oh right. Alfie isn't here yet."
They finished setting the tables just as Kelly's family started to pile in. Her cousin Layla, a bandana with Peanuts characters printed on it wrapped around her head, and her aunt came in carrying dishes of food, her Uncle Deacon close behind with bottles of Pepsi and Diet Coke.
Dean hummed and rubbed his head against Cas's chin. "Got any good stuff?" he whispered.
The two boys looked across at the benches on the other side of the playground equipment. Jack's mom and stepdad, and Dean and Cas were seated there, Claire in her stroller. His mom had her head on Sam's shoulder, eyes closed.
When he drank the whole thing, Cas took the empty bottle and his own and put them both on the nightstand. Dean lied on the pillow, looking at the older man. Cas rested his head on his own pillow and started playing with the hair on the nape of Dean's neck.
"That's irrelevant. Now, for the third time, get out."
Reading the back of the bottle, Cas said, "Next time take it before you eat."
"Mmf. Good."
10/28
"I... I think I do."
Hannah smirked. "You hate Benny."
Castiel smirked. "Interrupted again, huh? What a great night."
Dean popped up behind them then, probably bored of the tongue bruising his throat. His lips were puffy and he had on a goofy smile, showing off his perfect teeth. "Hey guys. Didn't realize you left. Gunner wants to play pool, little two on two. You in?"
"Oh. Eileen killed a ghost at a hotel in St. Louis and they gave her a free week in thanks. She invited Sam."
"We're staying up late, right?" Maggie raised her eyebrows.
"Don't be embarrassed, Deanie," John soothed. "He really is a cutie. And those biceps. Damn."
Dean furrowed his brow. "You okay, kid?"
Jack sat up. "What?" He thought they were in their bedroom, sleeping with the baby. They had beeen ordering out and using canned food a lot lately. Jack was even taught how to use the can opener so he could heat the food up himself.
"No, he's just crashing here," Dean corrected. "He will leave when he finds an apartment. Which I hope is soon."
He slammed his foot down and narrowed his eyes at Maggie. She stuck her tongue out at him.
"What in God's name did you eat?" John asked, rolling down the window.
Sam, making as much noise as possible, came in through the front door. Dean could hear his large sneakered feet pounding in his direction.
"Oh."
Cas quirked an eyebrow. "Oh, and why is that?"
"Aw," Cas would reply. They would kiss and then Dean would pull him into the kitchen for a snack.
'Went home with Ruby. Have fun!'
Jo bit her bottom lip and shot Sam a wink. "I kinda like dirty boys."
"My sister," Kelly explained.
"Nothin'," she responded happily as she opened up the fridge, causing a wave of cold air to ghost over Cas's naked chest. She started shoving soda and beer cans into the cooler. "Can't I be in a good mood?"
Dean scratched at an itch on his cheek that didn't exist. "Y'know, J-Jesse doesn't have a mom," he cleared his throat.  "Yeah, Sam, uh, dated this girl in high school, Ruby, and she was a, oh what's the right term, oh yeah. Complete and utter and bitch."
Laughing and sputtering when he reached the surface, Dean splashed Castiel in the face.
Dean leaned towards Cas. "Whose idea was this?"
Dean Smith was never one for casual sex. His mother always told him he was a romantic at heart and he couldn't deny that. He liked holding hands and strolling on the beach and Valentine's Day and cuddling after sex. He always dreamed he'd get married to a sweet guy or girl and have four kids and get a dog and live in a big house with a wraparound porch and a garden full of bright flowers.
"Gross. And no."
"Oh, she's the same age as my nephew, Jesse. Those are, uh, good ages." He tapped his foot against the floor.
The waitress left with the menus and Dean shook his head at Cas. "Well aren't you Mr. Health Conscious."
"No," Jack replied as Maggie, offended, said, "I have a boyfriend."
"Dean, slow down!" Castiel scolded.
The sound of the book closing a few minutes later had Dean sitting up, looking expectantly at Cas. He smiled at Dean.
"Kaia," Jack said a little louder, and the girl snapped her head to him.
Sam groaned as he sat up and his mom stretched her arms up.
He was sad that he had to leave the only two kids that would talk to him, but he was really surprised when two weeks later his mom brought him to the aquarium and Kevin and Maggie were there. His mom and Kevin's mom had set up a playdate and Gabriel had decided to move Maggie and her grandmother to an apartment a few blocks from Jack's building. Maggie even transferred to his school, though she was in the grade below him. His mom had bought the three of them matching shark shirts at the gift shop.
Dean sat up and spun around to find Castiel standing there, green trunks on. He smiled at him. "Hey, Cas."
After he dried and slipped into a snowman sweater Dean's mom gave him last year and a frayed pair of jeans, he went back to the living room and put his dirty clothes in his bag. As he zipped it back up, Jack sat up in his sleeping bag, yawning and stretching.
She apparently only slept during the day then, because every night her loud cries woke Jack up.
Jack sighed happily and lied back, arms folded behind his head. He stared up at a dirty white piece of gum that was stuck to the step above him. It was nestled between  two small cracks.
"Thanks be to God," the parishioners replied.
She shook her head and rubbed his shoulder. "You have nothing to be sorry for. I'm the one who asked." She smiled then, and Gabe sniffed, and he got a whiff of her candy apple body mist.
When the voices of the festival goers died down, the head of the council cleared her throat.
-I don't see why not.-
"I told her to say I did it. She won't get in trouble, there is no proof she was involved."
"Kelly," the woman replied.
Castiel hopped off the bed and slid his feet into Dean's slippers. At the door, he turned and blew Dean a kiss. "I'll be right back." He headed out into the hallway, igoring Dean's loid, exaggerated grunt, and walked to Jack's room. The door was cracked open, and just before he knocked, he heard a long sigh.
"Yeah, wouldn't want you to spontaneously combust," Jack smirked.
"Uh huh." Dean finished putting on his blades and shoved his sneakers in his bag. Slinging it back over his shoulder, he stood and smiled at Cas, making the man's heart pound fast. "Let's go!" Dean took off down the street, and it took Castiel a second to get his bearings and hop on his board.
When he let Jack out in front of his building, he held a finger to his lips. "Your mom would murderize me if she found out where you sat!"
"My dear baby sister made it for me, if you must know."
Dean spun around. "Cas doesn't have his own mug," he insisted.
He was hopping up and down, koala hat on his head and one arm shoved into his coat. "Cas, Cas, Cas! It's snowing, you have to come out, come on! Who is that? Who are you talking to?" Jack bounced his way closer and let out a squeal. "Dean!"
Castiel wiped at his face with a dish towel and turned back to the stove.
******
Max finished his drink. "Sure. Sounds fun."
"Shush. Take Jack. With the stuff you wanna buy we'll end up dying of scurvy."
"You are too young to understand."
"Good morning to all on this blessed day," he started, and Cas side eyed his husband.
Maggie tapped the handle of her fork on the table. "Laser tag first!"
"Yeah, told you," Dean replied, moving his hands through the water and bubbles. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and held him close.
"Hello." Castiel ruffled Jack's hair. "Good morning. Hungry?"
"He told you come tonight?"
"What?" The man scrunched his face up at the men. "Who the hell are you two?"
"Please do, that sugar is gonna make your teeth fall out!"
"I am going to put you down," Castiel declared. "You better stand up."
"S-sure. Thanks." He'll probably ask for a blowjob later, he thought.
Cas looked at him, disgusted. "How many times have I told you not to eat candy for breakfast?"
"Will someone tell me what the hell is going on?"
Dean stiffly walked over, each arm holding one of his kids, and Josephine latched onto his leg.
In Castiel's parents' house, Sam and Jo were eating their meals with Cas's younger brothers in the living room close by, watching a Disney movie. The adults were in the dining room, chatting away. Dean was keeping his eyes on Cas the whole time as he coaxed mashed peas into Ambriel's mouth.
Cas pushed Dean off his legs. "I probably shouldn't have left it in front of the door." The lamp on the table by the door was turned on and Dean blinked into sudden brightness.
"Most people get flowers or candy or something."
Gabriel stood, his chair scraping against the floor. "Alright. I think that's enough. Will you all excuse me for a moment." He strutted toward his brother and Dean and grabbed them each at the elbow, dragging them outside.
Dean didn't think he'd have had to worry about the fridge. Cas had a strict vegen diet, and Dean ate mostly vegetarian dishes. There were a few occasions were he ate chicken or fish, and always a bacon double cheeseburger on his birthday. Unfortunately, Sam stocked the fridge full of meat; steaks, ribs, ham, turkey. Things that Dean tried his hardest to avoid at the supermarket. The freezer wasn't much better; his frozen yogurt was replaced with ice cream.
Dean stood standing at the doorway for about ten more seconds before backing out and closing the door.
Dean stomped his foot. "Can you just tell me what I did wrong?"
"Oh, right," Dean mumbled, and he used the side of his foot to knock the ball back to the little blonde boy, who then scurried off.
-I missed you, daddy!- To the dog's pleasure, his daddy picked him up and kissed his ear, holding tight.
Eventually, the boy finished and proudly showed his mom his empty plate. Carefully stacking the cutlery and cup on top of it, he headed off into the kitchen to put them in the sink.
"I know, but it is tradition. It's been happening in Tadpole for so long it has become an integral part of Indigo Forest culture." He looked out the window at the stars twinkling in the sky. "People come from all around. Not just the forest, the islands nearby, too. It's good for trading and farming and everything that helps keep this town alive." He looked back at his nephew, and the smile on his face did not reach his eyes. "The... activity at the end of the night is the worst part, yes, but everything else it brings is a blessing." He ruffled Jack's hair, leaving it slightly damp from his touch.
Dr. Garrison put the photo back down, angling it the same way as before. "Do you have an issue with homosexuals?"
"Yeah, insults. That'll get me to take you."
"No... or at least he never said so."
"I guess so."
"Wh- no, love. That's not how that works."
The rest of the meal was eaten in silence and after Dean put his dishes and cup in the sink, Cas led him by the wrist into the living room. Hannah was sitting crosslegged on a red and green striped armchair that was patched up in a few places with duct tape, laptop balanced on her knees. Jack was happily throwing toys around in his playpen while Claire sat next to him on the floor, aiming the remote at the TV and running through the options on Disney Plus. Gabriel was on the brown leather couch, Kelly huddled close to his side while he slowly stroked her hair. Cas gestured to the green loveseat, and Dean let out a gasp as a shock of static electricity hit him when he sat next to the older man.
"Heya, Gabe," Charlie said as she came onto the porch, wearing a warm looking hat with cat ears and a puffy red coat. "What's up?"
Miracle got excited.  -Do you think she'd like my Uncle Sammy?-
Claire started whimpering and Sam rocked her gently.
"It's the candles," Cas answered, smiling. He walked over to Dean and kissed him deeply before leading him by the hands to the table. "Sit, sit," he ordered gently.
"Steak." Cas pulled out a Tupperware container and opened it. "And broccoli and carrots."
'No, I can just... you know what? Yeah. Can you come get me?'
Castiel wiped at his mouth with a napkin. "You're always hungry. Did you take your Lactaid?"
The man yelped. "Will you two please refrain from assaulting me?"
Castiel peered into the water. "I think I might be scaring the fish away. I'll see you all later."
Jack, Maggie, and Mary jogged away, while Dean and Cas walked at a slow pace. Cas grabbed Dean's hand, and squeezed. Both their palms were sweaty. Castiel didn't care.
Cas hadn't even closed his eyes when Jack woke up and immediately started wailing. He sighed and started to move, but Dean sat up and stopped him.
Castiel ran his nose against Dean's cheek, beard scratching his skin. "It's kind of crowded in there as it is. With me and all my stuff.
Putting his pen in his mouth, Dean took a hard look at the clue in the crossword puzzle. Six letters, a person who prescribes medicine.
"Hm?"
Uncle Sammy stomped his foot. "I mean it guys! Behave yourselves or one of you is going in the backyard."
"Well, you found me," Dean grumbled.
"Food that will clog the drain."
The clock on the nightstand changed from 8:03 to 8:04 and Castiel's stomach growled again. His head was pounding from hunger, but he needed to watch Dean sleep for just one more minute.
Jack jumped out of the seat. "No. Mommy taught me how to do it myself." He could feel Dean watching him as put the foil around his foood. He took a few more sips of apple juice before tossing the cup into the sink and running off to his room.
Dean grinned and threw the comforter onto Cas.
So why the fuck was he sleeping with Castiel Adler?
"You are so beautiful," Cas whispered dreamily to his boyfriend.
Rummaging around in one of the drawers, he asked "Why aren't you doing this in the bathroom?"
Sam threw him a wide smile. "Nope! Just met my future wife." A dreamy look crossed his face.
Red and green and white decorations covered practically every inch of the walls and tables. A large fake tree dominated the corner by the front window, colorful lights shining bright and ornaments neatly placed. A female angel figurine was perched at the top of the tree, and the base was surronded by several stacks of wrapped presents. Castiel clenched his jaw; it reminded him of the Winchester house.
"Greek yogurt."
Dean swallowed. "What did you do that for?"
"Sweetie, what's wrong?" Dean whispered.
"You got paint on you butt!" Claire exclaimed, throwing her short arms out as if presenting something.
"Shh!" Castiel elbowed him in the stomach.
"Hell yeah," Dean replied enthusiasticly. "You're missin' out, dude. You'll listen to Lizzo and Taylor Swift but not the gods of classic rock?"
Dean had come in, walking slowly as he checked the house out and hung his jacket over the back of a chair in the dining room. Gabe noticed Cas's Adam's bob as he gulped, staring at Dean in the grey Henley that even Gabriel had to admit fit him well.
-----
"I'm not going!" he shouted, jumping off the couch. "This is my house! You can't send me away because you got that stupid baby!"
When Naomi called for the next prisoner, Jack furrowed his brow; there were only six people scheduled to be killed.
"Oh hey, Cas. We were looking for you, kiddo."
"They... are not very curious I guess. I told them all they needed to know about you. I was pretty sure they wouldn't ask you anything. I just wanted them to meet you."
"Cas, cut it out," Dean demanded. "You're being a dick. And sit down."
Kelly took a long drink of juice. "Uhm... I... Cas and Dean were a couple but they broke up and now we... we. Him and I, that is..." Her shoulders slumped. "Oh, forget it. I can't lie in front my son. Mom, Dad, everyone," she glanced around the room, "Cas is gay, and w-"
"I wasn't sleeping," Cas whispered to his husband. "I was resting my eyes."
Dean took Cas's hand and led him out of the kitchen and into one of the firetrucks.
"Cool." Castiel smiled and pressed a quick kiss to the corner of his mouth. Dean's face burned.
The doorbell rang, so Cas gave Gabriel a sharp glare before heading out of their room to get the door. Through the peephole, he could see a pretty freckled face carrying a cardboard box, and he gasped. Swallowing, Castiel opened the door, the green eyes of his ex-boyfriend still beautiful as ever.
"I cooked them for you," Cas blurted. Heat bloomed on his cheeks. "Y'know, because you like them."
*****
Claire flared her nostrils."Wha- come on! Small Dad, tell him to stop!"
The doctor picked up the picture. "Yes. Claire. She's five. Jack is four months."
Dean scrunched up his face. This is ridiculous, he thought.
"Oh, I see. Did her parents come with you?" He took a bite of his fruit salad.
"'K," Jack replied as he stood up and ran to the couch. He launched himself onto the bed and jumped up and down on the spot right next to Dean's legs. "Get up, get up, get up." He made sure to keep his voice low, so he wouldn't wake up his mom.
-That's gross,- Bones said.
Sam looked around, confused, as Dean pulled into the parking lot. "I thought we were going to an ice cream store?"
Peeking carefully over the bench he was squatting behind, Jack loaded his gun with a few more darts. They were the last ones he had in his shoulder bag, the rest scattered around the backyard like blue and orange foam French fries.
Sam looked guilty. "Oh. I'm sorry, I thought you were like, one of those gay vegans."
Cas waved. "Hello Mr. Winchester."
"Interested in joining us?" John asked. "It's a fun game."
"I am. Now here is what is going to happen. Dean, you are going home and Cas is going with you. The long trip will do you two good. Nothin' to do but talk and talk and talk."
"It's Valentine's," Dean replied through a mouthful of bread and bacon. "No 'm'. And what do you want to know for?"
"Well because Gunner is awesome, he said anyone can come! I asked Lisa and she said she'll find some days she can take off and they'll come out. His daughter, Maggie is about Ben's age. Real sweet. They're gonna love each other. And as for my job," Dean stretched his arms out wide, wiggling his fingers slightly, "I got fired this morning!"
"It's the TV... I can't get it to, uh."
Castiel's face heated up. "Th-that's not the same, Jack." He busied himself with his shoelaces. "It wasn- we weren't do-"
His dad nodded. "Well he zipped away so fast when he introduced himself 'cause he just had to start a bonfire, so I, to annoy Dean, call him 'bonfire boy'."
"You okay now?" Dean asked. He put his hand on the boy's shoulder and Jack shrugged him off. "Alright. Look, kid, your mom and Sam are worried about you."
"So, like other people live here right?" Claire asked through a mouthful of food. "Seems kinda empty."
Jack and his friends lied on their sleeping bags, sipping from Koolaid Jammers and eating their sandwiches and baby carrots. An American Tail was playing on the TV screen, one of Jack's favorite animated movies.
Jack swallowed a meatball from his Spaghetti-O's, and Dean grabbed a napkin to wipe a drop of sauce from his chin. "Sam made me a reptile and amphibian calender for Christmas and it definitely says 'Valentime's Day' on February 14th."
Gabriel had spread out his sleeping bag behind the couch, and he had taken the liberty of putting Kelly's bag a few feet away from her son and Castiel, even though he'd rather have her next to him. She came out of the small bedroom next to the bathroom, where she had been helping her grandfather get into his bed, and dragged her sleeping bag over to Gabe.
"The dishes. It goes large plate, small plate, cereal bowl, then salad bowl."
"Well I just can't wait," Jody replied. "The last one, where that family is separated in Purgatory, made me cry."
His sister dragged herself into the kitchen just as he was setting the plates on the table.
"Well that was interesting," Dean declared. "Hope they have fun." He held his hand out and Cas took it, smiling and feeling nervous. Castiel let his boyfriend lead him to their room.
"Dean?"
"Are they gonna get married?"
👨🏼🚒❤🧑🏻⚕️
"I don't. I live with my family."
"Well, I... I don't know." Him and the angel had only leveled up from friends to whatever they were now three months ago, and Dean still felt a little terrified about being with someone guy shaped that he liked so much. "I guess so? Maybe. I haven't asked him." Clearing his throat, he got up to run water on a balled up paper towel under the sink. "Clean your face, you have a Spaghetti-O in your eyebrow."
"They're pretty obsessed, huh Gabe?" Stevie asked.
"Huh?"
When he had fallen at the soccer game, Cas had leaped over the short wall and scooped him up in his arms. The blood poured out of Jack's nostrils, running into his mouth and staining his and Cas's shirts. Jack could hear two people sobbing loudly, and it took him a few seconds to realize it was him and Krissy.
Dean had spent the rest of Saturday avoiding Cas, which was relatively easy because the angel kept running around the bunker cleaning, barely sparing Dean a second glance.
"I wish I could do something like that to James."
Cas grinned at him and took a step forward, sliding his free hand around the back of Dean's neck. The doctor slotted their mouths together and Dean fisted a hand in Cas's shirt.
Banshee was staring at the ball as if she didn't know what it was. Her head was cocked and her tail was between her legs.
"So, what do you think?" his uncle asked. "She's cool, right?"
"You seem chipper," Dean announced. "Get anything on sale?"
"Don't be ridiculous, I was planning on memorizing it."
"I think it might be rude leaving without saying goodbye," Cas stated, "and I think I should thank Helen and Jack Sr. for their hospitality."
Jack grinned down at his baby sister.
"Why is there no cable, are your parents tightasses or something?"
"If you wish."
"I've never had a date force me to eat dairy," Dean commented as he swallowed the last bite. "Isn't cheese bad for your heart?"
"No. I should. That's what boyfriends do. I, uh, am your boyfriend, right?"
Bonus:
"Ugh. That is too many people. Tell some of them not to come. Start with my parents."
Mary had used blue cheese ranch on hers and nearly emptied the bacon bits container. Dean sighed and asked his mom for the bacon, so she tossed it and he caught it effortlessly.
"Yes. I was ignoring you." Castiel crossed his arms. "How are you not getting that?"
Yes, several, he thought. "How the fuck did you get a key?"
"Oh." The boy stabbed his food with his fork. "Does it feel good?"
In the photo, the two were standing in their friend Charlie's apartment. Dean had an arm around Cas's shoulders and they were bother smiling happily. Cas zoomed in on Dean's face and stared at his perfect green eyes and freckles.
"What the fuck?" the woman said, her voice slightly muffled.
"A wallet?" she offered.
At the airport, the two held eachother's hands and Cas gave Dean a kiss on the cheek.
Dean looked over at his mom and Cas; she was gesturing wildly at his boyfriend and he could hear her raised voice, but unfortunately couldn't make out what she was saying. Cas on the other hand seemed perfectly fine. He had recalled Cas once saying he had a high tolerance for alcohol.
His mom shook her head slightly, looking at him confused. "I don't do that." She turned to his dad. "I don't do that. Johnny, do I do that? Tell your son I don't do that."
"Ribbit," Sam repeated louder. He squeezed the older Winchester's shoulder as he left.
"Hello," Cas greeted, "I brought cupcakes. Would you like one?"
Jack handed them their cups and stood up straighter. "Tonight we have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, on toasted or untoasted white bread, and your choices of cut up celery or baby carrots."
"Good. Maybe now you'll eat be- healthy without my for- making y-you."
"I've bought you gifts," Castiel argued.
"Wait, stop," Castiel ordered, pushing himself off his boyfriend and sitting on the end of the bed.
Dean rubbed his hands together. "Alright, Cas. Whatcha got for us?"
"Want me to use a different word?"
Later, Miracle stood in front of the closed bedroom door, head tilted and listening to the noises coming from the other side. His daddy was making loud noises as if he were in pain. The first few times this happened, Miracle barked and cried and scratched at the wood until his father came out and put him in the backyard. It took awhile for him to understand that whatever Cas was doing to him was okay, because his daddy would come out very happy, even though he walked funny and had strange marks on his body.
"Don't be so dramatic," Dean said, and Jack saw him lean over and press a loud kiss to Cas's cheek.
"She promised she wouldn't drink that much," Dean went on. "I knew that was bullshit. Her sugar is gonna be fucking terrible."
Dean paused when he got to a picture posted by his friend Dirk. He was in the game room at the comic book shop they worked at, a Dungeons and Dragons game on the table. Their coworkers Samantha and Stuart were sitting across from him, and next to him was Cassie Robinson.
"Uhm..." the Winchester looked at Castiel. "It's uhm..."
Dean felt his face blush. "I-I'm an adult, I don't need to tell anyone where I go."
"I get it," Dean barked with a roll of his eyes. "A present for the dummy, right? I don't ne-"
**********
He furrowed his brow. "But wait, you were gone for awhile..."
"Gee, thanks."
"Very much so," she singsonged. She turned around to face him. "What are you doing in here anyway?"
Castiel nodded. "I... that was very insightful. Wow."
Dean did as he was told, staring off into space.
"See ya," Dean said softly, watching Castiel walk into the dark.
"I'll be the judge of that."
"Cut it out, Dean," Cas growled. He turned to his daughter. "And stop calling me that."
"Dean, good morning," Castiel said, smiling. "You look like you slept well."
"You'll get a better one next time I see you."
Dean would never admit it, even though it was obvious to anyone who spent time with him while he was around the horses, but Running on Empty was his favorite horse in the stable. Her sleek black coat glistened as beautiful as the inky black of a starless sky, the brush glided through the soft dark hair of her mane and tail, and when Dean looked into her warm intelligent brown eyes he felt like she understood everything he said.
"Dean, wait," Castiel exclaimed,  rushing over to him. "Please don't go. Stay for a bit more."
"But I can-" Dean started, but Cas spun toward him and put a hand up.
Now, with Dean sitting in a booth next to Cas and feeling awkward and out of place, Sam was across from them talking to some girl he'd danced with. It was not going well.
"Oh my God! Yes! I knew your voice sounded familiar." She turned and pecked Stevie on the lips. "Sorry, babe. I got a best friend I need to to talk to." She took her chair and food over to the empty spot to Dean's left, at the end of the folding table.  Jack passed down her mug of coffee and cup of juice.
"Uhm... I do not understand."
Banshee stretched onto her stomach. -It doesn't look like fun to me.-
Jack nodded. "I promise. I'm almost done." He looked at his uncles. "Can I bring Felix?"
"I have to pee," his nephew responded.
"Wow," Cas breathed. "Your eyes are so much more beautiful up close."
John exhaled two quick breaths and sniffed. "Not me."
Loud snoring was coming from the couch, so Jack tiptoed towards it and peeked over the back of it. Dean and Cas were on the pull out bed. Jack thought the two men looked like parenthesis with the way Cas was bent around Dean's back, and how  Dean was curled in on himself, head pillowed on his hands. The Winchester was the one who was snoring and Jack bit his bottom lip and covered his mouth so he wouldn't laugh when the man snorted, making him sound like a pig.
"In their room. Still laughing. "
Alfie gave a short wave and Benjamin didn't look up from his game.
The boy stared at him. "Really? You really are sorry?"
When they finally calmed down, Maggie went over to Felix's glass case and, with Jack's permission, wrapped him around her neck . She snatched the spinner fron the floor and flicked it.  "Right foot blue, Dean."
Dean fist pumped the air and quietly said, "Yes," earning a sweet looking smile from the doctor. Happily, he gave Cas his number and typed Cas's into his own phone. On his way out, Cas gave him wink.
"Oh. Then, no."
"It has already been done," Castiel replied stiffly. He sniffed. Had he been crying? "I made my choice and I will pay for it."
"I was just leaving," Dean declared. He walked past Castiel, not looking at him. He opened the back door of the Impala and pulled out a colorful bag. "Kelly, can you give this to Jack? I've been keeping it in the car since September. Might as well give it to him now." As he was handing it off to her, the front door opened again.
"What took so long?" John asked.
"Whatever." Dean lied back down on the dock, arms folded behind his head.
By the time it was their turn, Dean, trusting Cas to not let anything happen to his mom, had drunk two screwdrivers, one shot of purple nurple, and had split a Long Island iced tea with Benny, and he was feeling tipsy. Charlie pushed him onto the stage from behind and the music started, the three friends each taking a microphone from the DJ, Caesar.
Castiel pulled Dean's hand off his dick and flicked his balls. "You know better than that." He pushed a fourth finger in and curled them inside him.
The lie Gabriel had told was based in reality. Castiel, Gabriel, and Dean had gone to that party, hosted at the bar owned by Dean's aunt and uncle, and Cas had refused to put on a costume because he thought it was absurd for an adult to dress up. That annoyed his boyfriend, who was dressed as a cowboy. Cas had reluctantly broken up with Dean that night, after he had punched Cas's ex in the face.
"I was so bad you thought you had to pretend to be in a relationship with a homosexual? Not that you aren't a lovely man Castiel, but Kells, why didn't you ever tell me I was being obnoxious?"
Cas shook his head. "No. You could've really gotten hurt o-or lost for hours. I don't know what I would've done if something really b-bad happened. I am crazy-crazy about you a-"
"What are your older siblings like?"
His boyfriend shrugged, and Cas could see the blush spreading on his face. "I-it's no big deal. It actually looks funny."
"Can I come?" Jack asked, following Cas closely. "I really really want to meet her!"
"Yeah. Yeah, take your mom. It'll be fun. Babe, go with them. You can pull him into a booth and chat. Just the two of you."
Castiel rubbed his hand up and down Dean's arm. "I made you an Egg McMuffin. It's on the stove there."
He looked up and smiled around the pen when he saw Dr. Garrison's gorgeous face. He had a green hoodie on over his labcoat and was holding coffee and a sandwich in a plastic container in his hands. "Hey, doc. What's up?"
"Your stomach is growling," Cas told him. "You should eat."
Miracle cocked his head. -Like Daddy has Cas?-
"Course not," Deputy Talley said, giving Dean a weird look. "Just temporary. Won't last that long. You've never used it?" He handed Dean the bottle. "Go 'head and take a peek if ya want."
"It's no big deal, Jo," Sam soothed, mouth full of lettuce and croutons. "Eat it first just to get it over with."
Sam raised his eyebrows. "You know he might not even be over there?"
Cas crossed his arms. "You deserved it."
"Whatever. Goodbye now."
Kevin got Maggie in the the head with a pretty hard hit, and she hit him right in the legs. Jack jumped off the couch, pillow raised above his head, but Maggie smacked him with hers, causing him to lose his balance and fall right next to Felix. Luckily, he had put his arms out, so he didn't smash his face on the floor.
"You know you have to breathe, right?" Dean asked as he took the milk box away from him.
"Eh. It's nothing. Just a flesh wound!"
"What?" he mumbled, pushing himself straight up and rubbing his eyes. He sniffed and yawned again.
"Ben," Dean scolded, "don't tease your brother and sister. And Claire will be getting punished too."
"You okay, kid?" Dean rubbed Jack's shoulder slowly.
Dean threw up his hands up. "I am n- my diet i- I don't need t-" He shouted unintelligibly and stomped off to his room.
"- we aren't together," Kelly continued. "Mom, everytime I come home or even just call you try to set me up with some random guy, so I asked Cas to pretend to be my boyfriend so you'd stop."
Dean flared his nostrils and gave Sam a sharp glare before releasing his sister. He watched the larger man watch her as she walked to his room. "Stop it," he growled.
Castiel put his hand on the door, ready to push it open, but he hesitated. He knew it was wrong to eavesdrop, but it had been enjoyable to hear the three talking like they were normal young adults just hanging out with one another, not three people who had been through countless amounts of trauma.
He took two steps forward before Gabe grabbed his shirt and pulled him back.
"Mmhmm. Mommy's not up yet. Will you help me with my cereal?"
He sighed, put down his phone, and stretched again. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw someone walking up the steps to the porch, surrounded by darkness and lit dimly by the light at the front door. A soft gasp escaped Dean when he realized it was the man he saw earlier.
Castiel rolled his eyes and hefted his boyfriend back up. "Yes, you will. It'll be good for you. Family bonding time."
*****
"Yeah, that! I don't think I... oh! It might be in the Impala." He bounded for the car, Miracle galloping behind him.
"He just talked to her. Calm down." Castiel looked at him with such a soft expression, Dean actually felt calm, and his pulse slowed down.
Jack smiled. "I need to say sorry to mommy and Sam and Uncle Cas. Will you come with me?"
"It's still my birthday two and a half hours, you have to do what I want!"
Before turning back to the screen, the three kids each stuck their tongues out at the adults. Maggie blew a raspberry at them.
Dean swallowed. "I... haven't been in the best mood since she and I broke up, but ever since I met you, I haven't thought of her. Once. So... I guess that's good right?"
Dean pulled pieces of lettuce and slices of tomato out of his turkey club. "Your dad said you have to eat healthy on this trip."
"Your pup is fast," she said breathlessly. "Can I have mine back?"
Dean twisted around to glare at his cousin. She had airpods in and was staring at her phone, probably watching a cartoon.
Castiel nodded. "I suppose I'll hold onto them until we get upstairs."
Cas smiled. "Hello, Sam."
"Uh, what are you doing?"
Miracle rubbed his back against the grass, feeling the warm sun on his belly. Close to his back legs was his favorite ball, the orange one with swirls. He needed to keep it safe from the other dogs.
"Yeah," Dean replied, head buried in his hands. "Yeah it is."
In his bedroom, Castiel was putting his stuff in a somewhat neat pile in the corner next to Dean's closet. The duffel and the suitcase were open and he was folding clothes onto the floor.
