He could also hear the footprints on the stairs, the scrape of the lock on the door, the shocked, broken sounding voice that Sherlock would know anywhere. The voice of his best friend, the best friend that he ever had, the voice of John Watson.
"And I kept wishing, that one day," John continued, "one day, you might actually come back. But you never did. And it drove me crazy. I've been going mad locked away up here, with all the memories, all the pain, but still I hoped. You've caused so much damage Sherlock and you have the nerve to call my reaction to seeing my best friend is actually alive 'inconvenient'?"
The atmosphere in 221B was relaxed, welcoming and warm, reminiscent of the time spent there before Sherlock had left.
“I had stayed with Lestrade the night before, and was therefore thoroughly unprepared for the weather, so he let me borrow one of his jumpers. I wore it under my coat. It was not a flattering look.”
Anthea walked with purpose straight into the hospital. John followed her past the reception and into a lift which took them up to the floor where Sherlock's room was located. For once, John did not care that he was in a hospital. He just needed to get to Sherlock. He did not stop when Anthea stayed behind in the lift. He continued down the corridor in front of him until he met Mycroft, who appeared to be waiting for him. With a curt nod, Mycroft opened the door.
“It surprised me.”
“Move out of the way, Sherlock.”
With John’s nod of acknowledgement, Sherlock opened his mouth as if to say more, but then closed it quickly again, biting his lip and swooped across the kitchen to the front door, gathered his coat and scarf and made a prompt exit.
John gently placed the paperwork from Lestrade in a neat pile on the coffee table as Sherlock flopped rather inelegantly into his chair in a dramatic flair of long limbs and expensive suit. The silence continued as John moved into the kitchen to put the kettle on.
“You changed when you met John. He made you more human. You cared for him a lot more than anybody thought possible – including yourself. That’s why I backed off. Some people even thought you were in love with him.”
“Hello. Are you ready to hear the story?”
“A lot,” interrupted Sherlock.
But he knew that the
“Sherlock, what’s going on between you and John?”
“You have the world’s most adorable pout.”
(I love you)
The Detective Inspector raised his head, and sighed in obvious relief at the sight of the two of them. Sally followed her boss’s gaze and sent a withering look at them, clearly she had not wanted to call them in on the case, but they were out of their depth and desperate.
“Sister?” John asked, just to clarify, just to make sure.
“What happens when Sherlock’s discharged?” Mary took control yet again, asking the right questions and not loosing her temper.
“I’m not quite sure I understand.” He voice was quiet, yet the confusion was easy to pick out. Sherlock sighed and walked calmly towards her. When he was right next to where she was sat, he leaned back against the counter and folded his arms.
“Sherlock, you don’t need to explain. You’re here now, and that’s what matters.” John said this only half-heartedly. Of course it mattered, but John was never one to cause a fuss.
“I will give you a piece of my heart. I can’t promise all of it, but I can promise that what I have, I give to you. It’s been so long, butI’m ready to start.”
All three men watched the CCTV footage on the computer screen. Sherlock leaned in and stared intently, documenting every single detail that was presented to him for further analysis, whilst Mycroft and John leaned over one of his shoulders. At any other time, this would have annoyed Sherlock. He did not tolerate having people looking over his shoulder. Of course, he did it to John, but that was different, John didn't mind and he did. But Sherlock's attention was captivated by the small black and white images dancing across the screen. They watched as an obviously well-to-do man walked down the left side of the street with large, expensive looking houses shadowing him from the sunlight. On the opposite side of the road was a small park. They followed him, jumping from one clip to the next until…
, and I was so in love. Our life was absolutely fantastic. I came home one day and she was waiting for me with the most amazing news. She was pregnant. I was going to be a
"Because you're not the same Sherlock Holmes that I know. You're still a brilliant, arrogant, snobbish know-it-all, but you're not the man who was my best friend." His voice cracked, and he looked towards the floor, desperately trying to keep the tears from falling as the brutal honesty of his words settled in. It had been one thing to think them, but admitting them out loud set it in stone. This was not the same Sherlock Holmes, and John felt that no matter how hard he tried, he was never going to fully regain his best friend. However, this did not mean that he was not going to try.
John muttered under his breath. “I don’t believe this.” The doctor ran his hands through his greying hair, like he was trying to grab onto to something and keep a tight hold – his sanity most likely, if anything was going to go missing when the Holmes brothers were together, it was John’s sanity.
Moriarty was right. Falling never hurts, but landing does.
"What about me?" It came out a little more harshly than John was expecting, and sounded incredibly accusing. He hoped Mary didn't pick up on it.
Her attraction had been blatantly obvious from the moment she set eyes on him. It was in this very lab, she was just starting her first day here in Bart’s and Sherlock happened to be right in the middle of a case. She’d smiled and giggled at all of Sherlock’s explanations as to why he was there, even though there was nothing remotely funny about them. Her hands had made their way up to her ponytail and her fingers played with the long, reddish brown strands of hair.
Next, John had approached Greg, who had known Sherlock longer than he had, although maybe not better. But it still didn't give him any insight into this odd behavior.
John opened his eyes again, and realised too late that they were full of tears. He let the notes wash over him, each one feeling like a knife to the stomach, and yet they gave him hope. Was that possible? How could something give you hope, and yet at the same time cause you so much pain.
“For everything.” In those two words, Sherlock was able to convey everything he had ever wanted to say to the woman he was holding. And she knew he meant it, all of it. She quickly let of Sherlock and playfully hit him with her hand.
“But, you’re not attracted to men.”
“John, remember that I will try as much as possible to fill Sherlock in about the past few years of his life, but it will not make it any less difficult for you.” Mycroft looked sympathetically at the army doctor. This was the plan. Mycroft would help at Baker Street, and then collect his brother from the hospital, explaining the situation as best he could to Sherlock, and hoping that he didn’t kick up too much fuss over an apparent stranger keeping an eye on him. Mycroft had promised to stress the fact that John was not a stranger, and had been Sherlock’s friend before the fall. After that, he would leave John and Sherlock in Bakere Street and watch how events unfurled, intervening only when necessary. “I would offer to take care of Sherlock myself but-”
"And who's fault is that I wonder."
Questions could wait.
It was a pain unlike any that Sherlock had ever experienced.
"John," Mary's eyes were still closed, "promise me that you'll still help him when this is all over. Please." Her voice was so quiet and pleading that John's heart broke a thousand times over. No. Now was not the time to be making last requests.
"It's an exact replica of her wedding bouquet." Sherlock had always possessed an uncanny ability to read John's mind, and once again he was completely right. "I have a new one made every month."
"You're still his friend, even now." John frowned. Mary wasn't making sense. Sherlock was his friend, but that was before his accident. Mary could obviously sense John's confusion, or read it on his face. "He was confused about what your relationship was, but even now, he told me that you are the closest friend he's ever had, and probably ever will have, despite what happened. You're the only one who outside of his family who has shown him any kindness or willingness to help. You care for him, therefore he cares for you. But he wasn't sure if you would still consider him a friend after what happened, because so much has obviously changed. So he spoke to me. I told him that of course you do, he'll always be your friend no matter what happened. You could have tried to tell him that, but he needed to hear it from me, because he knew I wouldn't try to lie to him."
"Let me make this perfectly clear to you, Mr Watson." His voice was low, deadly. "We will release you, and you will walk away from us. You will not involve yourself in our affairs any longer, your life depends on it."
"Dear me, Doctor Watson. Your manners really have worsened since you left England."
The shot momentarily stunned Moriarty, but Sherlock had been anticipating it quickly used this advantage to snatch the remaining gun and turn it on Moriarty. John also turned his gun on Moriarty.
“I love you, John. I will always love you.”
"It's fine, Molly."
“The man branded as the ‘Fake Genius’, Sherlock Holmes, who was seen jumping from the rooftop of St Bartholomew’s Hospital earlier this year, has this morning revealed to the world that he is still alive. The man who calls himself ‘the worlds only consulting detective’ attended a press conference this morning to release details about his fake suicide and the reasoning behind it.”
Sherlock’s breath hitched as Jason used that oh so familiar phrase that came so casually, but meant so much more.
“Impossible John, and you know it.”
"Sorry. I'm used to being here alone, where no-one can see this, or judge me."
But he found himself unable to finish. Because Sherlock
After the case was over, John updated his blog with the new adventure. The comments just poured in – mainly about how nice it was that Sherlock and John had managed to move on with their lives, and how good it was to see them returning to normality.
“The most illogical thing happened. I heard him, John. I could hear him as clear as day, as if he were stood right next to me. And he said ‘
“John,” Mary began, “when you say you lost your temper, what exactly do you mean?” She was pinching the bridge of her nose, eyes closed, clearly trying to keep calm herself.
Sherlock lowered himself into his armchair and steepled his hands under his chin. His thoughts rushed though his mind. Today’s case, John, dinner with Mrs Hudson, his panic at the case, John helped him, why? Obvious. That’s what they did, helped each other, saved each other. Why?
“Then there’s nothing more to discuss.” Sherlock, once again, resumed his observation of his cultures. He let a few moments of silence pass before looking up at John, who had not moved and was still watching him with a look of utter shock still etched on his face. Sherlock glanced over John’s head at the kitchen clock, and then back at John.
“Blow to the head, quite obvious cause of death, with just that it would have been difficult. But the stab wounds to the face? That’s how the killer allows us to identify him. If she was stabbed in the stomach, it could have been absolutely pointless. But by stabbing her in the face, we know he knew her.”
He wrapped his arms around Mary, holding onto her as tightly as she was holding him. He vowed, just as Sherlock had done - God, his vow, it meant so much more now that John understood why he had made it - to protect Mary and their child with everything he had. How would take are of them always, and allow no harm to ever come to them.
“Sorry,” Sherlock chuckled quietly, allowing a smile to creep across his face.
“Only me, love.” She deposited her load onto the kitchen table. “I popped in when you boys were out, and you seemed low on supplies so I thought I’d restock the fridge.”
“Marcus Wright, The Telegraph. How did you react to Sherlock’s ‘death’?”
Sherlock swooped away, pulling out his phone and dialing a number, probably Mycroft, leaving John and Lizzie still leaning over the tiny scuff marks on the floor. Lestrade walked over to them, and after John explained what had just happened to him, he clapped Liz on the back.
John lowered his gun, quickly emptying it of bullets and placing it on the ground before making his way over to Sherlock. The man was shaking, eyes hollow and staring at nothing. John wasn't surprised, Sherlock had just shot a man, it was only logical for him to go into shock.
“Babe, where have you been? I’ve been so worried.”
After making a cuppa for both himself and Sherlock, he made his way back into the living room, and after passing off one mug – the one full of sugar – to his flatmate, she sat down in his armchair, facing his friend.
“I should get started on that dinner if I were you. Mrs Hudson detests lateness and delay, and we did promise her a 5 star service after all.”
“I know about your family, but not much else. I just assumed you were a private person, I didn’t want to pry.”
All my love, Scarlett x
“He’s the best chance we have.” He pulled out his phone from his pocket, excusing himself from Molly’s company and gesturing to his phone by way of explanation, before bringing the device up to his ear and walking smoothly down the corridor, away from Molly and towards the entrance of the hospital.
He felt empty, completely hollow. Everything had been taken from him.
Sherlock noticed where the bullet’s intended target was standing.
Sherlock had been unaware that the emotions he’d kept locked away for so long were leaking out onto the surface. He twisted his face into his usual scowl and thrown a cutting remark at John about something – Sherlock did not care to remember – before throwing himself dramatically onto the sofa to continue to sulk. He heard John chuckle and return to his newspaper, saying something about ‘back to normal then.’ But it was good-natured.
he had thought. Mary seemed to have been able to read his thoughts, because she’d just smiled weakly and brushed her thumb over his cheeks. Such a gentle action, and yet so full of love, affection, and all the words they had been unable to say to each other.
"The blood, John. Only a pool of blood around his head where he fell. Completely out of the ordinary for that particular wound. There should have been blood spatter and grey matter. I myself should have been covered, considering the proxemics at the time of the shot. Moriarty must have had access to something that could fake a gunshot wound to the head convincingly enough that I couldn't question it. Also, where was the body?"
But there was a strange sense of anticipation that was sitting uncomfortably in Sherlock's stomach.
There was a small pricking sensation in John's neck where the hypodermic needle pushed a strong sedative into his system. John immediately felt dizzy, his muscles losing their strength and his eyes drooping with the sudden weariness that overtook John's body.
“Sherlock,” she started, her voice soft. “Sherlock, think about it. Without you, John would still be using that bloody cane to walk everywhere with. You made him realise he didn’t need it and eradicated the pain his mind was giving him, tell me that’s not a good thing.”
John couldn’t remember a time when he’d felt more lost. Well, he could – stood at the foot of St Barts, watching as the blood pooled around a set of dark curls. But this was different. Now there was no magic trick, and Mary would not be coming back.
Sherlock had looked up at these words. He’d never noticed it before, but hearing someone say it out loud made Sherlock realise how similar he and John actually were.
Without thinking about it, Sherlock picked up his own mug, leaving John’s behind on the table. John felt his eyes widen. He stared at Mary, who stared at him in return, and then they both turned to stare at Sherlock, who was drinking tea like it was the elixir of life.
Scarlett xx
John turned to see a flash of silvery-grey hair, longer than when he last saw it, and a broad grin spreading across the face of a man who looked genuinely pleased to see him there.
Sherlock looked back to John, who was staring at him with a pleading expression that closely resembled a small child who wants the last slice of cake.
“I don’t know what to do.” He choked out the words, suddenly realising that hot tears were spilling down his face. Mrs Hudson reached across the table and grasped one of Sherlock’s hands firmly in her own. That was all it took, that simple gesture. Sherlock was overcome.
"What happened in the taxi?"
“Not the most elegant first words to me, John, but I’ll take whatever you can give me.”
John looked puzzled.
“I just- It was really hard for me to accept the fact that he had really died. I completely blamed myself for it as well. And I had finally begun to come to terms with that. It was finally beginning to register to me that Sherlock had left my life for good. And I trained my mind to remember that he was dead, and that I should get used to it. So I did. I adjusted to a painful life without my best friend.”
Greg looked up at the man above him. Greg disliked being treated like an idiot, which is what Mycroft was doing by giving him these bloody ridiculous ambiguous statements. Mycroft regarded him, before turning back to attend to his brother. There was something off about what Mycroft was saying, and the way he was going about it, but Greg couldn't put his finger on it, and was too tired to even try.
“She didn’t know my suicide was faked.”
The second date, if possible, was even better. Even despite the fact that Sherlock decided to tag along. They’d taken a walk through St Jame’s park. Sherlock was deducing random passers-by, which greatly entertained both of them immensely. Things were looking good for the budding romance.
Molly’s head snapped up and she stared wide eyed at him. Clearly, this was still the first time she’d ever heard him admit out loud that he was confused and out of his depth.
Next to visit was Molly Hooper and her fiancé, Tom. She took one look at Sherlock on the bed and burst into tears. John let Tom do the comforting, he did not want to comfort anyone. He wanted Sherlock to wake up. Molly spent her time there holding Sherlock’s hand and talking to him. John was unsure about whether Sherlock would be able to hear her, but he appreciated the fact that she was trying. She told Sherlock about some of the interesting bodies she’d seen at work and promised him that he could have his pick when he woke up.
Mary was good for him. Mary made him happy, deliriously so. Mary made him stronger. But Mary was no miracle worker. Sherlock was still broken, and John wanted desperately to fix him.
Take the next cab to St James’s Park. Too suspicious if we travel together. – SH
“Mycroft?”
Sherlock finally bought himself to dial the number he had been avoiding for the past week. He knew that his absences had not been received well, but he’d needed time to process and come to terms. Despite what Jason believed, he was very in touch with his emotions, and over the past week they had been too overwhelming. But Jason deserved an answer, and an explanation.
"Elizabeth is one of our new members of the forensics team. She's sharp, and considering Sherlock's dictations on who I should and shouldn't bring, I thought she could lead the team today."
"No, it really wouldn't." John pinched the bridge of his nose and breathed deeply. Sherlock watched John's external sign of an internal struggle, and waited patiently for him to continue. "Sherlock, it nearly killed me to lose you last time. I was so convinced it was my fault, that there was something I could have done but hadn't. I'm not letting you go alone. If I can help in any way at all, even if it's jumping in front of bullet-"
"Packing." John refused to turn and look at Sherlock. He wanted to leave Baker Street as soon as possible, and he didn't care if it seemed rude to do so.
Sherlock turned,Not to acknowledge either of them, but to delicatley pick up his violin and raise it to underneath his chin. He closed his eyes, breathed in deeply, and began to play what Greg had entitled in his head 'John's Song'.
"You ever gonna charge your phone, mate?"
“It’s okay, Sherlock, I’m here. I’m here. I’m never leaving you again. I promise.”
John was laughing now, and Sherlock found the need to join in with it. They laughed together, hands still clasped tightly together until John moved one to the nape of Sherlock’s neck, bringing them closer together until their foreheads were touching. After the laughter had subsided, Sherlock braved another look at John’s face. It was difficult, considering the proxemics of the situation, but Sherlock found the blue of John’s eyes and profoundly did not care about how silly or uncomfortable this may be, because it felt right. He closed his eyes and revelled in the moment, treasuring each second that went by, breathing each others air and just being together. Logic and rational thinking began to quietly return to Sherlock’s mind, and Sherlock once again tried to make sense of the situation
“Goodnight, John.” He didn’t give John a chance to reply before he was playing the violin again. John made his way up the remainder of the stairs and into his room. He didn’t even bother to get changed before he collapsed onto his bed, fully clothed and fell asleep. For the first time since Sherlock’s return, he didn’t dream, his mind completely blank as his body rested.
“No,” Mary’s voice was soft. John turned his head to see what was happening. Mary was no longer on the sofa. Instead, she was no stood in front of Sherlock, one hand on his cheek, her thumb smoothing over his cheekbone. “He still is, Sherlock. And I think he always will be, no matter what happens. You just need to trust him. Your mind is trying to fight back, let John help.” She patted his cheek, and moved away.
A few nights after the incident with the smiling, John announced he had a date. A date with a woman. Stupid, of course it would be with a woman. For some reason, this made Sherlock incredibly uncomfortable and angry. But Sherlock couldn’t pinpoint the problem. Why should John going on a date cause him to be so… irrational? John brought the woman, Stephanie or Sophie – something like that – up to the flat to introduce her to Sherlock before they left for dinner.
But John was straight – or at least, always insisting that he wasn’t Sherlock’s date. John could never want Sherlock they way Sherlock wanted John, needed John, like air in his lungs and blood in his veins. And Sherlock could never put any of this into words. Sherlock was sure John was just being friendly. Surely this was the normal behaviour of close friends?
“I do not.”
John's heart was breaking. His world was shattering. His life was falling apart. Every single cliché was happening. Yet more clichés for yet more disaster.
They were going to Bart's, Molly was clearly shocked, that was all he could read from the situation.
"Jesus, John." Apparently there was nothing else the DI could offer John, so John continued to let out everything he’d been repressing since he’d lost Mary.
“John, the doctors said it would take time.”
John liked his smile. It suited him. Sherlock buried his face in the pillow, trying to hide his face as it burned with another red flush. Once again he felt the speed of his heartbeat increase, and the swooping sensation in his stomach. Sherlock didn’t know why he felt like this, or even know what to name this particular feeling. He’d never experienced anything like it, it was so all consuming. He’d have to get control over his body. He couldn’t let John realise something was going on before he’d figured it out himself.
It was the most heart wrenching, utterly shattering piece of music that Greg had ever heard, and one look at Mycroft's face told him that the elder Holmes brother was thinking exactly the same thing. Sherlock was pouring all of the emotion that he refused to express in any other way into the composition, and Greg quickly had to leave the room before he became overwhelmed.
They swirled around the flat in movements that surely must have been choreographed. The way the particles moved around each other, so intricate and delicate, reminded John of how he and Sherlock used to be. They were so in sync, always. John always knew how he needed to be around Sherlock - when his inputs and opinions were appreciated and when they were not, when he needed to ground Sherlock with a hand on his shoulder before his thoughts became too much, or even when Sherlock needed space to think and John left him alone. In return, Sherlock had understood when John needed him to shut up, or when he didn’t, he knew exactly what needed saying, he’d known when to keep John close on a case, and had never purposefully walked him into the path of danger. On the few occasions that this had happened, Sherlock had always claimed that it was completely accidental. Most of the time, John believed him, but there was something about Sherlock that John knew attracted him to high-danger situations – the thrill of the chase, as he had once put it.
Except he hadn't died. And neither, apparently, had Moriarty.
“Enough,” Lestrade’s voice boomed through the rather small room, the authority in his voice so plain that it nearly made John want to cower and obey his instructions. Nearly. John had been a soldier after all, and it was very hard to intimidate him. Sherlock and Sergeant Carter were another story. Carter completely froze, dropping her gaze to the floor, a slight blush grazing her pale, sharp cheeks. Sherlock had turned his attention back to the other people in the room, eyes widening ever so slightly at the tone of Lestrade’s voice, the only giveaway that he was at all surprised. “Now,” he began looking between the two of them, John taking a step back to slightly behind Lestrade so there was no block in the line of fire, “you either tell me what the hell happened between you two right now or you’ll both be removed from the case, effective immediately.”
“John, when Sherlock came to me to ask for help, do you know how upset he was?” John shook his head. “Well, he was a complete mess. His voice was unsteady, he was shaking like a leaf. I didn’t se him cry, but I’m sure that if I wasn’t there he would have been. He only wanted to make sure that you were safe. He knew that Jim- sorry, Moriarty would try to threaten you to get to Sherlock, and that ultimately that would end in Sherlock’s death. You were his number one priority. Not Mrs Hudson, not Lestrade, not me, not even himself. You. John, Sherlock always had the intention to return after the fall otherwise he wouldn’t have faked it. He would have really died that day – he was prepared to do that. But he knew that the threat wouldn’t have lifted, even if he did die, so he had to remove it, then come back to you. And after all that, and after realising what affect it’s had on you, do you really think Sherlock would willingly leave you like that again?”
3 months, as it turned out, was no time at all.
“Oh my god Sherlock, I love you too. I love you so much. Please come home.”
“Doctor Watson, Sherlock and I are similar in the respect that we both detest repetition. It is a waste of time and I am sure you heard me the first time.” He rolled his eyes at John. “Yes, I envied you. You changed Sherlock for the better, something I had been striving to achieve for years and yet you seemed to accomplish it within a week short weeks, possibly even days. You made him happy, you were the only one who ever could and probably ever will.”
Sherlock didn't respond. Greg hadn't expected him to.
"Ever the drama queen," John sighed. But even as he said so, he was relieved to hear Sherlock sounding like himself. "Mycroft, tell him to shut up and then tell me why he's in hospital again."
“I still can’t believe your first words to me were ‘sod off’.”
"It's done, Mycroft."
The conversation between the muffled voices continued for a few minutes longer, during which John could hear Mrs Hudson clearing up the mess that the smashed cup probably made. The deeper voice said something and there was a pause. John waited, not moving, waiting absolutely silently. It could have been seconds, or minutes, or hours, but eventually, Mrs Hudson replied monosyllabically. John could hear the man raise his voice slightly. Obviously this had not been the reply he had expected. Mrs Hudson was quick to retort. John wished he could hear more than just the muffled sounds, he longed to hear the words, to find out who the voice belonged to.
“Well, you’re wrong. I know Sherlock would never do it.” The words were out of John’s mouth before he could stop himself. But he did not make any attempt to take it back. Instead, he stood up and walked straight out of the room. Mycroft didn’t try to stop him. As he crossed the hall, he walked purposefully on the carpet, ignoring the indignant noises being made by the stupid slave of Mycroft’s. He made an extra effort to slam the door on his way out.
Sherlock’s heart cramped as he thought about what he was about to do, what he was about to put John through again. But he had made his decision, and he knew that he was leaving John behind in very capable hand in Mary’s hands, and with a daughter on the way, he would have something other than his grief to focus on. If he even grieved.
Please don’t take my sunshine away.”
Greg let go of Mycroft, looking absolutely disgusted, before pushing through the door into the room where John was being held.
“John, love. I would do it a hundred more times if I get to see you and Sherlock happy. You’re good for each other.” She patted one of his cheeks. She sighed “I’d love to have you cook me dinner tomorrow.”
There was no reply from John, and he wasn't there when Sherlock looked back towards him. There was, however, and unexpected reply from the doorway.
“Yeah, but still, I could have at least checked on you.” He ran his hands through his hair. “What’s been happening?” His eyes turned to Sherlock, and he moved so he was sat in front of Sherlock. His hands caught Sherlock’s wrists, and gently removed Sherlock’s hands from his hair, bringing them down to hold them between his own. Sherlock’s eyes – grey now – came up to meet John’s blue ones.
“You were attracted to me, and now that’s changed. I don’t understand it and I can’t figure it out so I’m asking you. Why?”
“I guess-” John sighed heavily.
clever tonight.” Sherlock’s expression turned stony. Even when he knew who John was, he did not like being mocked by him. “Tell me, Sherlock, how on
“She told me something, Sherlock. Something I’ll never forget, no matter how long I live.”
As he made his way out onto Baker Street, he saw Sherlock jump in and drive away. A beeping sound came from the direction of John’s coat pocket. He reached in and pulled the device out. A message flashed across the scene.
"I promise."
Except John didn’t seem happy. Why? Sherlock was confused. He had done everything in his power to ensure John’s happiness, so why did John not seem so?
“It’s perfectly alright Lestrade.” Sherlock’s eyes never left Sergeant Carter’s.  “I’m under no delusions that I am underserving of this treatment.”
"Oh for God's-"
“Shh, it’s okay, Sherlock. I’m here, I won’t leave. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
much."
"No, it shouldn't matter," John corrected him, "but it does. You're still recovering from a traumatic experience-"
“Inadvisable. He seems to be holding both you and I as personally responsible for Doctor Watson’s injuries. He is not in the best state of mind. Leave him be, not only for his safety, but for your own too. I know that should Sherlock cause you harm whilst he is emotionally compromised, neither Doctor Watson, or himself will forgive him for it when he’s recovered.”
“No!” Sherlock almost lurched forward in panic. “Jason, please, I just need to do this over the phone.”
"The rest of the team will arrive shortly to clean up."
Molly’s eyes filled with tears and her hands flew to her mouth as she suppressed a sob. Knowing that Sherlock currently blamed her for John’s state, and that there was a strong possibility that the strong friendship that she had formed with the tall, dark and alluring detective might be shattered beyond repair was surely breaking poor Miss Hooper’s heart.
“Sherlock, love? Do you want a cup of tea?”
A nurse entered the room, nodding to Mycroft as she did so, me then proceeded to check John's vitals.
"Hey, Sherlock. Look at me."
, he thought,
“State of my marriage, right there,” John finished, grinning as he remembered their first case together. Sherlock looked at him, confused but also surprised. John looked down at his left hand and twisted the ring off his finger for closer inspection. Sherlock held out his hand, and John immediately handed it to him, and Sherlock proceeded to examine the ring, twisting and turning it in his long, slender fingers. The trust was there, and Sherlock could see that, he just didn’t understand why John trusted him so wholly. For now, John was content to give him an answer to the questioning looks. “On our first case together, you deduced that the deceased woman was a serial adulterer from the state of her wedding ring. All her other jewelry was clean, but her wedding ring was dirty, except on the inside. The only cleaning it got was when she worked it off her finger, and that’s a direct quote from you by the way.” John shot Sherlock a grin, pleased with himself for remembering, and hoping that the glimmer of a memory was somewhere within the foggy, blurry confines of Sherlock’s mind palace.
John chuckled at the continuos threats and closed his eyes, perfectly content to revel in the fact that they were alive, they were safe and no threat was currently being held over their heads. John suspected that would all change soon, though. One of the many perks of living with the worlds only consulting detective.
John is in a similar state to my brother. But he has a job to do. He'll be home soon. - MH
“Because he needs me.” Said John, the smile still etched on his face. He looked fondly at the woman who he’s never had time for, except those Christmas and New Year parties. He’d always meant to talk to her, but in all honesty, they were both so involved with Sherlock that they had little time for anyone else.
“Sherlock-”
"No bloody idea, mate," he'd said over his pint. John liked to join Greg for a pint every so often. Mary encouraged the behavior, telling him that it was unhealthy to spend all of his time with the same two people.
As they walked, John took time to take in the scenery around him. He’d never appreciated just how beautiful this small oasis of green was in a jungle full of grey building complexes and concrete monuments. He breathed in the air. It smelled of freshly cut grass, rain and something that could only be described as London. It was refreshing. With every breath John took, he felt like he was cleansing his lungs from whatever poison was infecting 221B Baker Street. They continued walking in silence, until they came across a vacated park bench. The settled themselves on it, letting go of each other’s hands as they did. Mary waited for a few moments before turning to her husband.
John played over imaginary footage of himself shooting Moriarty in various different locations. Each time felt more satisfying than the last.
“That went well, John’s speech should have pulled on some heart strings and Sherlock managed not to insult everyone in the room.” He shot a pointed glance at Sherlock, who had managed to reduce a particularly young female report to tears.
Sherlock thought about John’s words. There was only one thing he could have been talking about.
Sherlock made no attempt to follow it. He made no attempt to move at all. He made no attempt to stop the intense pain in his head. And he made no attempt to prevent the dark oblivion from once again taking him from the world as he slipped from reality.
John shifted uncomfortably where he stood, but his gaze was still steady, eyes fixed on Sherlock, demanding an answer.
In her eyes, he was her boy. She had a pathological need to take care of him. When he bought John around, that first day, she could see what a difference it had made in him. It was like a school-boy bringing home his friend for play time. And ever since then, Sherlock had looked so much happier.
, John thought,
“I still don’t understand, John.”
Then he made one deduction too many, and any hope he had harboured turned to dust. Mary was pregnant. Both she and John were to be parents.
“Sherlock,” John began, a wide grin now spreading across his face, “you are such an idiot.” His voice was so full of fondness and tenderness that Sherlock found it impossible to take offence. “I was in the army Sherlock, I know Morse code.”
Despite the fact that Sherlock was supposed to be investigating the Moriarty situation, the next few days continued in this way, Sherlock would move to his bed at night, but never sleep, and his chair during the day, imagining all the different ways his life could have happened with John, always with John. Some of these fantasies even made him laugh, or as close to laughter as he could produce in his numb state. But then he would remember that John was not here, and any trace of happiness would be wiped away, replaced by the crushing sense of loneliness and desolation that he could not banish.
John’s hand that was touching his cheek removed itself and rested on the arm of the chair. And after a moment of hesitation, his fingers began to tap against the fabric of the chair.
Sherlock had visibly flinched. Not just a subtle change which only John could interpret, even Anderson and Donovan would have seen Sherlock flinch. His face scrunched up, eyes blinking rapidly, as though someone had just slammed a door and created an incredibly loud noise. His body tensed up completely.
“But it seems that Sherlock is in a,” Mycroft paused for a moment as he searched for the appropriate word, “delicate situation.”
"I assure you, Detective Inspector, the situation will resolve itself eventually."
Without saying a word, Mrs Hudson patted Sherlock's arm lightly, before turning and walking back up the path to the waiting, black car that Mycroft had provided for their visit. It was their first one since the funeral.
John was so engrossed in his memories of this room, of these very chairs, that he did not notice that Mycroft had moved into his field of vision until he had cleared his throat. He looked up at the man that was supposedly the British government, who was looking back at him with something that closely resembled pity. But that was ludicrous. Mycroft Holmes did not do pity.
“No, not exactly.”
“He couldn’t stop thanking me, and I thought it was sweet. I smiled and started to turn to leave, but he stopped me. He turned me back around and looked up at me. I hadn’t realised he was shorter, but that didn’t think it made any difference to how beautiful I thought this man was.”
"I don't know, John dear. I've never wanted to ask because... well... it's Sherlock. I'm sure that whatever it is, it's very important to him."
Sherlock frowned, his eyebrows pinching together. Warm? Solid? He continued to run his hand up along John's arm. The feeling of warmth and solidity never faded.
“Details,” Sherlock demanded. John made a mental note to work on Sherlock’s manners.
care, Sherlock!”
When they’d returned to Sherlock’s bedside, she’d made a big fuss about plumping his pillow and making sure his blanket was tucked around him, and John watched as she smoothed back the ebony curls from Sherlock’s forehead and plant a soft kiss there. As she pulled away, she told him to wake up soon. It reminded John of the way his mother used to tuck him in bed at night, and filled John with waves of fresh, raw emotions.
Sherlock did not let on how he was truly feeling to John or Mary. After watching them pull away in the cab, he walked back to Baker Street. After giving Mrs Hudson the shock of her life, receiving a very stern lecture and then a tear-filled hug, Sherlock was finally able to take himself up to 221B. It was only after he had closed the door behind him, that he allowed himself to break.
It was still dark outside, and the clock in the kitchen – must have been John’s influence, Sherlock did not remember putting a clock here, or even having a desire to have a clock in the kitchen – told him that it was 8pm, still early.
“Penny Newman, Daily Mail. John, were you aware that Sherlock’s apparent death was fake?”
John could tell that it was going to be a long night.
John’s voice was clearer now and he sounded utterly wrecked. A jolt of pain shot through Sherlock’s abdomen. Sherlock knew that the pain was in his mind, but it hurt nonetheless. And the pain in his head increased further.
“John.” His name was no more than a breath on Sherlock’s lips and it was clear he didn’t have strength to talk.
"Greg, good to see you. I really need to see a friendly face."
John knew that if he and Sherlock worked together, then at least one of them stood a chance of happiness in the future.
High-pitched notes, moving fluidly through the flat woke John in the early hours of a Wednesday morning. It was the all too familiar sound of a violin, and there was only one resident in 221B with the skill to play such a delicate instrument.
The crux of the matter was that John was scared. What if he was reading too much into the use of his middle name? What if he had got his hopes up that a miracle had occurred and the man in the next room was the same man who John had been living with these past weeks?
“You were hurt? How badly Sherlock?”
The entire contents of his mind palace, including his inner Mycroft, Molly, John, Mary, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Angelo and - for some unfathomable reason - Anderson and Donovan, were joining together to break down that one door that remained locked. The black door without any handles or hinges. The door from which the thick grey fog which had clouded his mind oozed from underneath the door. They worked quickly, pounding against the wood to the rhythm of his heartbeat, which he could hear roaring in his ears.
John didn’t know how many hours had passed since he returned to Baker Street, he hadn’t even registered that he’d spent the entirety of that time focused on a table and dust. Only when his phone rang did he make an attempt to move. His hands fumbled with the buttons in his attempt to answer the call as quickly as possible. He didn’t check the caller ID as he did so.
“Doctor Watson?” John managed to force himself to breathe, and pushed the words past his lips, as if on autopilot. Everything seemed to be shutting down.
It should have been fatal. Should have been, but wasn't, because John Watson possessed the uncanny ability to always elude death's eternal clutches.
Sherlock turned his head, staring at the white linoleum hospital flooring. He could see Mycroft in his peripheral vision, hovering worriedly at the edge of the room. At the accusation, he visibly stiffened, all colour drained from his face and he looked – dare Sherlock say it? – utterly terrified. Sherlock watched as Mycroft closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, preparing himself for what he was about to reveal.
The man could never do simple.
But Sherlock welcomed that madness. How could he reject it if it was bringing him John? Sherlock, of course, knew that it was not actually John. He might have been driven mad with grief (as cliche as it sounded), but he was not an idiot.
John smiled. And with that simple message, John felt like he had a little more strength as he headed back to his old flat to attempt what seemed like an impossible task.
"I assure you John that no-one is placing the blame on you. You're an extremely competent doctor whom I've always trusted to take care of my brother seeing how he does an appalling job of it himself." John couldn't help but laugh. Both of the Holmes brothers seemed to have an uncanny ability to read his mind. It must run in the family. "Considering recent circumstances, I do not point the finger in your direction over Sherlock's condition. It's his own fault and I've seen fit to remind him of-"
“My apologies for not visiting sooner Mrs Watson, it was fully my intention to visit as soon as I heard the awful news, and I’m deeply sorry. However, I wasn’t sure of whether or not I’d be welcome.” He was polite as ever. Git. How was John supposed to stay mad at him now? John could feel Sherlock’s gaze on him, and when he looked up at Sherlock, John caught a flash of blue-green. But John blinked, and Sherlock had turned his attentions to Mary.
John pinched the bridge of his nose in annoyance.
“Please don’t bother John. I don’t care for your pity.” Sherlock pulled his hands out of John’s grasp as if he suddenly realized what he was doing, leaving John stunned and a little hurt. Sherlock straightened up and his face was slipping into the blank mask Sherlock used to cover his real emotions. He was once again becoming the high-functioning sociopath he believe himself to be, shutting the world out and leaving him to the mercy of his torturing and dangerous thoughts.
John did not take Molly’s hand. Instead, he swooped towards her and flung his arms round her tiny frame. He picked her up from the floor and swung her around the room, Molly holding on tightly so she wouldn’t fly away into any expensive equipment if he dropped her. John was laughing again, and this time, Molly was too.
“Perhaps Mrs Hudson could,” Mary began, but John cut her off befor she could finish.
He wanted to be alone.
Sherlock had never intended to go mad, it was just one of those things that crept up on you and by the time you realised , it was too late.
"Me? But I didn't really do anything."
If they both made it out alive that is.
It was situated just under the shade of a tree, a solitary protrusion from the grassy covering of the ground around it.
"If you were real, I'd be worried about your sanity with a face like that," Sherlock retorted as he grudgingly got up from his chair and proceeded to the toaster.
"Jesus, Sherlock, why didn't you tell me?"
The cab was fairly warm, but not unpleasantly. It smelled vaguely of cigarette smoke – the cabbie had probably not been abiding by the ‘no smoking in cars’ rule – which caused Sherlock to begin to crave what he’d been depriving himself of since he had returned to Baker Street after his stay with Mycroft. But he’d promised Mycroft not to touch anything harmful – be it narcotics or plain cigarettes – ever again. Sherlock had thought it was just a case of ‘big brother syndrome’, but Mycroft had then gone on to make him promise “for John’s sake, if nothing else.” Something inside of Sherlock had made him make the promise, although he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. He’d guessed at perhaps it was his subconscious using memories of his past to make decisions. Perhaps Mycroft knew this also, and that’s why he was using John as an excuse to make Sherlock…
Moriarty.
Moriarty coughed and held out his hand, his palm flat and demanding.
John let out a short laugh, but there wasn’t anything remotely funny. "They shouldn't be. I should be able to mourn the loss of my wife with my best friend there to support me." It was now John’s turn to turn his attention to the remainder of his drink.
They arrived at New Scotland Yard after a short drive through the light London traffic. There were few people still awake at this hour, which made the journey quick and painless.
I don't mind at all. I look forward to meeting her. Can you send me her number? – JW
Sherlock choked on his words. He should have made John stay. If only he had made him stay.
"So, what's the plan of attack, then?"
“Well, I best leave you to it! I’m expecting five-star service tomorrow you realise.” She winked at Sherlock and John as she exited the kitchen. They listened to her shuffle down the stairs. “Goodnight you two,” she shouted up the stairs, “sleep well.”
"Blow to the back of the head and amnesia actually count as traumatic experience, especially in my book, and especially when it comes to you. I'm
The whole situation caused Greg to feel out of his depth, it was not only Sherlock who suffered from sleepless nights, and on more than one occasion had found himself at Baker Street in the middle of the night to make sure that Sherlock wasn't doing anything stupid. There was no need, of course. Mycroft had the whole placed bugged and if Sherlock did anything - reach for a gun, or a bottle of pills, or a needle - the flat would be swarming with bodyguards and medical professionals within seconds. But Greg needed to check himself. He needed the physical proof, that reassurance that no grainy CCTV image could supply.
Finally, after nearly five hours, the surgeon approached Mycroft.
“I what?”
Everything went black.
He could hear her voice, muffled through the floorboard but unmistakably hers. She sounded as if she was crying, her voice shaking more than usual and long pauses where she stopped to take breath, more frequently than usual. Not a deduction to the standard of Sherlock Holmes, but enough for John Watson to know that something out of the ordinary was happening in the flat below him.
“Tea?” Sherlock offered a mug to John, who still occupied his usual armchair. John took the cup, eyeing Sherlock suspiciously.
He opened his eyes and looked around the flat. He spent so much time repeating this action it was a miracle he hadn't gone mad. John hadn't moved a thing in the flat. Everything was exactly how they had left it on the day he lost Sherlock.
Sherlock pictured the scene with perfect clarity. The small, unassuming but absolutely beautiful man losing his balance on the ice and falling, Sherlock rushing to catch him but only just missing, their eyes meeting, the immediate connection that Sherlock had felt. The man had golden blonde hair that was gently greying around the temples, the fringe swept across in a slick style that made the man look utterly perfect.
Sherlock stood by John’s side at the altar, as he married Mary, as they became Dr and Mrs Watson. He tried not to imagine himself in Mary’s place, repeating the vows back to John, promising to love and cherish him for the rest of his life. He cast his eyes towards the floor as John recited his vows, and tried not to imagine that John was speaking these words to him. He tried to ignore the pain in his chest that felt like his heart was shattering like glass into thousands of tiny pieces that were cutting up his insides. He tried to look happy for the newly married couple.
When I say I need to find her someone, Sherlock thought, of course I mean John, he’s always been much better at these things, and would probably pull it off with more finesse than if I ever even attempted…
John deposited his bag in the doorway and moved to the window. He stood there, just staring out of it. If he were Sherlock, he would pick up the violin and play an utterly heart-wrenching piece of music to show how he was feeling. If he were Mrs Hudson, he would insist on talking to someone about it. If he were Harry, he would drink his problems away. But he was not any of these people. He was John Watson, and John Watson didn’t have a clue what to do.
And then John saw them. The beautiful, smooth white stones protruding from the grass.
Sherlock’s hand was pressed painfully against his forehead. John moved forward and removed the violin form his grasp before he dropped that too. As soon as his hand was empty, Sherlock moved it to his head, ramming the base of his hands into his eye sockets. His breathing became quicker, and John feared that he was about to begin to hyperventilate. but before John could reach out to sit him down, Sherlock let out a furious groan, that was so full of rage that John took another step back. His eyes snapped back open.
But he didn’t.
He took a step forward and Mycroft instinctively shied away, anticipating another blow, but Lestrade just leaned forward, close enough to whisper in his ear, grabbing his shirt to prevent him pulling away from his words.
Hey guys! Sorry this chapter took so long! I have been suffering with the well know ailment that is WRITER'S BLOCK! Anyway, this isn't as good as my last chapter, so forgive me, I blame the WRITER'S BLOCK!
Both John and Sherlock sighed in relief. Sherlock couldn't stand another day of being so ridiculously bored, and John couldn't stand another day of Sherlock complaining about how ridiculously bored he was The tension in Sherlock's shoulders that had been present since John's minor slip-up disappeared. John too, felt himself relax at the news that they could go home. At home, he and Sherlock could get to work on the new development regarding Moriarty. At home, it would be nearly normal, with Sherlock's memory returned. At home, Mrs Hudson could fuss over them and make them tea and insist that she wasn't their housekeeper.
“I think you would. He’s your best friend too.”
John took Sherlock's chin in his hand and forced his best friend to look at him.
“John, open your eyes.”
As he thought this, a sigh came from the man on the bed. Immediately, John bolted out of his chair, grasped Sherlock’s hand in his and leant over the detective to watch his face. Sherlock’s face creased in pain momentarily, before relaxing back into a state of unconsciousness.
"So now we've been left with two options."
After a few minutes of basking in the overwhelming relief, Mycroft made his way to John's room. It was the first time since John had left England that Mycroft had laid eyes on the man. Jon was thinner. Much too thin, and ghostly pale. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his hair was most definitely grey rather than the ashy blonde it used to be. He looked like a corpse, and had narrowly avoided being so.
The second envelope, he addressed to John. He felt that John deserved a direct explanation, despite everything.
"Well, I knew him back then, he would still turn up to crime scenes and insult our intelligence in every way possible.” He laughed wryly, and even John couldn’t help a chuckle escape him at the memories of Sherlock insulting NSY on numerous occasions. “But now it's different. He came back a few months ago, but he doesn't act like he did back then."
John took his hand after a moment of hesitation. Sherlock felt the warmth of John’s skin seem through his palm. He wanted nothing more than to pull him into a tight embrace and keep him there forever. But John Watson was not his, and therefore he did not have the right to make suha request of him. Instead, Sherlock turned and boarded the plane, making his way towards certain death.
“John had adequate means of-”
There had only been 2 more fits since Mary had arrived, and John hadn't moved from her side. He held tightly onto her hand and never wanted to let go. He got very little sleep, always wanting to constantly watch over Mary. If something happened to her whilst he was sleeping, unable to do anything to help her, he would never forgive himself. He thrived on coffee and adrenaline, knowing that sooner or later he was going to crash – hard. But whilst Mary needed him, his body sustained efficient energy levels so he could stay with her.
"Sherlock, don't, please."
There was a stunned silence. Sherlock’s full attention was now turned towards John, still holding the ring at his eye level. “I said that?”
“Lestrade’s already explained to you how I apprehended the assassins so if you bothered to listen you would already know…”
“Yes.”
Lestrade strolled into his office, Sherlock followed, politely holding the door for John as he entered behind them. Sherlock closed the door after John, leaving behind the still silent room, as everyone’s eyes had followed them into Lestrade’s office. There was 2, maybe three beats of silence, where John and Sherlock held each others gaze, before releasing the laughs they had both been restraining. John’s shoulders were shaking as he clapped a hand to Sherlock’s arms for support. Sherlock chuckled in the deep, cat-like purr John had grown accustomed to as he held on to John.
"I'll be sure to pass on the message." And with that, Mycroft promptly ended the call.
John Watson taught Sherlock what love is, without even trying.
“No, John,” Sherlock continued, “I do need to explain. Mycroft kept me in that house and all he ever told me was how well you were doing. I had absolutely no idea what was actually happening. I had no idea that you tried to…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. He just couldn’t. “If I’d have known, if Mycroft had told me what was really going on I would have come back so much sooner, I could have saved you the pain which I’ve obviously caused, and am still causing, judging by the way your holding yourself.” Tears weren’t going to be a problem. Sherlock hadn’t cried since the rooftop, and he wasn’t going to change that. But his voice wavered, ever so slightly, and this was enough for John to understand just how his best friend was feeling.
John followed the baritone rumble, which was vaguely recognisable, and yet his mind was in no state to remember immediately. The fuzzy outline of the person before him began to sharpen, and soon John was able to make out a set of well defined cheekbones, a narrow, aristocratic looking face, piercing bluey-greeny-slivery eyes all surrounded by a halo of dark curls.
"Don't be ridiculous, John. No-one's replacing you."
"You know... Together."
The sobbing began again. Although it helped to relieve some of the pain, it did nothing t fill the hole in his life, the flat, his heart. A hole that was created the moment his best friend took the step off of St Bart's hospital. The hole that could never be filled. Only one person could fill that hole, and Sherlock had just attended his funeral. Only John Watson was capable of making Sherlock feel complete.
“What’s got you so pleased?” John had asked him one evening as Sherlock paced back and forth across the length of the living room.
If he had not been spending so much time trying to help Sherlock when he obviously did not want to be helped, he might have picked up on this sooner.
"Did I?" John's voice has risen a few octaves. "And that counts as an overreaction to you?"
“Right then,” said Lestrade, clasping his hands together in a very business-like way. “It’s about time we got you guys involved. I’ve been grasping at straws recently without you. Obviously we can solve it, but it’s just a lot quicker and easier and we need you, more than I like to admit. He ran his hands through his hair again.
Yay! I finally managed to update!
Sherlock turned very slowly towards John, and John was horrified to see tears shining in Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock's arms wrapped around his own waist, and his eyes moved to the floor, still refusing to meet John's.
Lestrade was just stating the obvious now. "Yeah, he get's flashbacks sometimes. Gives him a killer headache but it's kind of reassuring." John felt guilty that this reassured him, but it was a sign that the Sherlock of those 5 years was in there, just trapped, and fighting to get out.
“I could see that Sherlock was going to take one of the pills,” Sherlock read aloud. He skipped several sentences. “Which is when someone shot the taxi driver.” A few more lines were skipped. “That someone could have the power of life and death over someone else - but I'm glad whoever it was did it, because they undoubtedly saved Sherlock's life. And, frankly, after everything that man had done to those innocent people who got into his car, a quick death like that was better than he deserved.”
A voice above John seemed to have other ideas.
No no no no no no no.
John watched her as Liz's eyes took in the scene around them. Before he could continue their conversation, Sherlock's voice could be heard making deductions and observations.
" Sherlock interrupted.
“She’s a smart girl, that Molly.” Sherlock replied. He had grown fond of her during his days spent hiding at her place. It was homely enough, but it wasn’t Baker Street. God, he had missed the flat whilst he had been away. Molly had been more than welcoming, obviously as she was still head-over-heels in love with him – he’d need to introduce her to someone, anyone to take the distracting and irritating attention off of himself.
People were beginning to stare now. His face was no longer covered by his hair, and his cheekbones were exposed for all to see. This and the fact that he was wearing his signature coat and scarf, made him recognisable to anyone who’d bothered to pick up a newspaper, or tune into the news over the past 6 months. The passers-by looked as if they had seen a ghost, which in their minds, was probably true. He would speak to Lestrade or Mycroft about organising a press conference about his return. It was better to come clean, than let people come to their conclusions.
He'd found that his abilities of deduction had somewhat vanished after John's death. Prolonged shock, Molly had said. He'd still not leave that flat for anything other than his dinners with Molly. It wasn't that he particularly enjoyed them, but he knew everyone would stop fussing as long as he left the flat at least once a week. Molly's company was tolerable, if not a little annoying as her persistent infatuation with him reared it's head every now and again. But Sherlock didn't mind that in exchange for keeping everyone else, particularly Mycroft at bay. And they got a free meal out of it, Angelo still insisting that everything they ate was on the house.
“He kissed me goodnight and we exchanged numbers. The next week we went to this terrible play. We spent the whole journey home just laughing at how awful it had been, but it was one of the best nights of my life. The week after that I came down with a cold, so he came over to take care of me, and we spent all day drinking hot chocolate. He bought me my scarf, my blue one, and told me that it would protect me from getting colds ever again, which I knew was stupid but I never took it off. It was on this day that I realised I loved him.”
When Mycroft had left the room and the door had shut behind him, Sherlock finally stopped struggling. His muscles went slightly slack, however there was still overriding tension throughout his whole body.
And he stood there, waiting, staring.
It felt warm. And solid.
"John?"
Sherlock took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerve before showing Jason a side of himself that very few people had seen.
“True.” John even let out a small, breathy laugh. It was true. Sherlock would not have put up with Molly’s constant puppy dog, ‘I love you so much’, routine if he did not believe her of use, meaning she was definitely more intelligent than people gave her credit for. He felt a slight twinge of guilt and pity, but moved the conversation on. Forwards was the best way to go when it came to things like this, and as his father had once told him in a clipped, military voice:
Sherlock had to tell John himself, or Mycroft would intervene.
It was his waltz.
It was early evening in Baker Street as a warm, familiar voice floated through the air.
“I kept you where you were so you wouldn’t see me hit the ground. Naturally the necessary precautions were taken, and were removed when one of my homeless network knocked you over to distract you.”
on the way, and in the space of one evening it had all been taken from him. Every chance of happiness he had was viciously stolen from him through another man's stupidity.
"I am not in shock, Molly." He shrugged the blanket from his shoulders.
?’ I asked him why, and he said ‘
John’s voice had echoed in his ears and Sherlock had desperately held onto what he assumed was a hallucination. He didn’t care, he needed to hear John’s voice.
“Sherlock, John, meet Sergeant Annalese Carter. Carter, this is Sherlock Holmes and his colleague, Doctor Watson.”
"I know."
It ended where it began.
No. Surely not. It was just a dream, wasn't it?
“You wouldn’t do anything stupid would you?”
“John, what is the point in denying it? I’m obviously the most important thing in your life, or at least more so than Mary, otherwise you wouldn’t-”
He was so busy concentrating on pushing even more clothes into the already full bag, that John didn't hear the tell-tale creak of the 5th stair, which signalled someone's ascent to his room. Neither did he hear the door swing open, or the familiar footsteps enter his room.
Of course, there were times when the past would catch up with him, when he would be overwhelmed with emotions that everything on Baker Street seemed to stand still, the world stopped spinning on it’s axis as John tried not to fall apart with the flood of feeling.
“That’s quite alright my love.”
“You’re too busy being the British government to help your only brother who can’t remember his old flat mate, which really isn’t a concern of yours anyway,” John snapped, finally reaching breaking point, “yeah, I gathered.” John did not mean to sound so resentful or harsh, but something about being back in Baker Street just pushed John over the edge. Maybe it was that he had to face up to the reality and enormity of the task ahead of him. He felt the pressure of a strong hand on his shoulder, and it took John a minute to register that the hand belonged to Mycroft. John was so unused to signs of affection from the Holmes brothers that he was suitably shocked and touched at the gesture. It was as if Mycroft was planting him on the ground in preparation. John would have to be Sherlock’s anchor as he readjusted to the world.
Yes, John reflected as he sat reading the comments. He had his best friend back, and now he had Mary too, Lestrade was still giving them cases, Mrs Hudson fussed and Mycroft was being his usual aloof self. The reflection of his life at the moment causes a small smile to spread across his face.
“I tracked them. All three of them. I stayed with Molly for a few days whilst formulating a plan-” Molly would have been delighted, thought John, “before heading straight out to where I was sure the first one was hidden in Brighton, the one who was assigned to Lestrade. Of course he had bolted, but had left so much evidence as to where he had gone it made me wonder why Moriarty hired him in the first place. He man was a complete idiot.”
"You want to know."
Now her brows furrowed in confusion and her eyes moved downwards towards the floor, the direction they always went when she was trying to figure something out.
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson.” She hugged him tighter
Sherlock laughed, but it was bittersweet. John used to say things like that.
On occasions though, Sherlock would be composing.
"Yes, thank you Sherlock," Mycroft snapped to stop him form picking yet more holes in his security system.
Sherlock made Mycroft swear that he wouldn’t tell John. Mycroft had agreed – a shocking feat. Mycroft never agreed with Sherlock, at least not out loud. But the promise had come with a condition.
John noticed that they were all crying, except himself and Sherlock – who had come. Mary would have hated it. She would have wanted people to be happy.
Continuing to focus on John, Sherlock tapped out his rhythm once again, still watching the doctor.
Mary refused to leave John’s side, which is how they ended up in the consultant’s office. A few words floated around John’s mind, a mixture of his own and the consultant’s
When John Watson was a doctor, he liked hospitals.
“Molly Hooper you are the best person in the world!” John said to her through her hair as he placed her back on the ground. “I will never let Sherlock insult you ever again.” Their arms were still wrapped tightly around each other.
“Mycroft?"
"Yeah.” Lestrade nodded, eyes on his empty glass, refusing to meet John’s eyes, which were now staring at Greg as if he’d grown an extra head. “He'll be spouting of his usual stuff, you know, the 'deductions', and he'll turn around, like he's looking for someone. Completely stops his train of thought and he's got no bloody clue where he left off."
As he thought, he reached a further conclusion.
“It was a bit obvious. Your eyes followed him everywhere. You made an effort to make him smile or laugh, and if anyone ever hurt him, well, you saw to it that they got ten times worse. And I knew you loved him in some sort of way the moment you left his wedding early.”
“What kind of case?” asked the consulting detective. John could see the longing in Sherlock’s eyes. He needed a case, and soon. He was bored, and a case was the only thing that was going to stop Sherlock from shooting something.
"I am genuinely wounded and hurt by that you lanky git," he smirked and shot Sherlock a cheeky, knowing wink. The small gesture felt like a knife in Sherlock's gut.
Sherlock’s heart jumped, and his head snapped to the person beside him. Molly didn’t turn, refusing to meet his eye, but well aware of his intense gaze upon her. Once upon a time, this would have intimidated Molly, but not anymore.
Apparently she’s been showing the signs for months. She’s experienced the severe headaches, which she’d just passed off as migraines due to stress bought on by work. The drowsiness, the nausea, the vomiting. Mary had even confessed that she’d been finding it harder and harder to concentrate on anything for lengthy periods of time, and that she’d had a few stumbles on her walks to and from work.
“You, you’re everywhere. In my mind palace, you’re in every room. I see you’re face everywhere, and yet I still can’t place you. It’s infuriating.” Sherlock slammed John’s laptop shut, and stormed out of the living room in the direction of his bedroom. This was confirmed when John hear the heavy slam of a door just beyond the kitchen. John hadn’t moved a muscle, hands still planted on the chair and desk, which was lucky, because he didn’t think his legs would have been able to support him at this point.
. He was
“No, I faked my death to save you. They’re two very different things, John.” John let out a short laugh. “Honestly John, how on Earth are you a doctor if you can’t distinguish between a fake death and a real one?”
“It was you wasn’t it? You shot the cabbie.”
‘Sentiment.’ Sherlock had been thinking about this word a lot lately, and whenever he did, John was present, either physically or just in Sherlock’s mind. But Sherlock was yet to make the connection. He needed to know why. The feeling that accompanied being unsure was painful to Sherlock. He disliked not knowing things, especially things about himself.
She’d reached up and wiped the tears off of John’s face, pausing as she rubbed her thumb along his cheekbone, her other hand cupped around the back of his neck, drawing them closer together. John had caught her hand and held it to his face. He smiled weakly down at her, and wrapped his free arm around her waist. He leaned forward until their foreheads were resting against each other. John had closed his eyes and breathed deeply for the first time in days, and allowed himself to forget why they were there in the first place. All that had mattered at that moment, was that John had his wife in his arms. They shared this intimacy for a few moments longer, before Mary laced her fingers through John’s and detached themselves from each other. She had lead him downstairs, and John caught a glimpse of Mrs Hudson fussing around Sherlock, who was in his thinking position, sprawled across the sofa, completely unaware of the hurt he’d caused John. He had opened one eye lazily as John and Mary entered the room. He’d looked the couple up and down once, and then closed his eye again, returning any thoughts he’d abandoned to watch John and Mary. Mrs Hudson had sent an apologetic look at the two of them. Mary had gently guided John out of the flat, and as they walked down the stairs into the hall, she’d turned and said her first words to John since she arrived at Baker Street.
“Never mind,” John chuckled to himself. He was sure he could tell this woman anything, but she wouldn’t hear him – too wrapped up in her gadgetry.
When John Watson’s wife was lying in a hospital bed hooked up to too many machines which required too many needles for his liking, John could quite happily burn every hospital in existence to the ground.
"Do what?" asked John, still purposefully not looking at Sherlock. Had that mark always been on the ceiling?
"Dammit, Sherlock," the greying detective swore under his breath. If there was one thing on this planet that Greg Lestrade was best at it was cursing under his breath, and he had one person to thank for it.
He wasn't sleeping well, if the dark circles under his eyes were anything to go by.
Sherlock took a deep breath, collecting himself before once again meeting John’s eyes.
“Can you think of anyone?”
“John, breathe! Deep breaths! In and out! In – 1, 2, 3, 4 – out – 1, 2, 3, 4. Look at me John,” the doctors eyelids had begun to droop, “John, keep your eyes on me! Breathe!” They continued the exercise for at least 10 minutes. When John had regained his breath, Sherlock sat down next to him and leaned his head back. This was going to be harder than he thought.
"Sherlock?"
Mrs Hudson took both of Sherlock’s hands between hers, Sherlock found the warmth of her hands comforting. She looked at the crying man full in the face. She had never seen him cry before, not even when he was begging for the drugs he relied on. It was clear to Mrs Hudson, that John’s wellbeing meant a great deal to Sherlock, even if it was painful for him. He had proved that the day he jumped from St Barts, and confirmed it again now, sat at the table clutching the hands of the only mother-figure he ever had in his life.
He reached over the bed to take one of the ex-army doctor’s hands in his newly bandaged ones. As he enclosed it in his hold, he bought John’s hand up to his forehead as he rested his elbows on the edge of the bed. He squeezed his eyes tightly shut against the tears that had been threatening to spill over the entire exchange with Mycroft finally slipped gracefully over two well defined and sculptured cheekbones.
About 2 miles across town, Sherlock’s phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and read the message.
She would have like that, simple, elegant, and gets to the point. It had been hard to sum such an amazing, beautiful person in so few words, but John felt like he had chosen the right ones.
The only way to ensure this was to face Moriarty alone.
"Only this time what?" Sherlock remain perfectly calm on the exterior, however, alarm bells were ringing in his head.
Mycroft eyed him cautiously.
“I was your best man?”
“Why-” Sherlock began, but John quickly cut him off, wanting him to rest, he would need a lot of that over the coming weeks. The hand wiping the tears away stopped their movement and delicately cupped Sherlock’s face, keeping Sherlock’s eyes on him.
Sherlock continued to stare at him with the same expression. A doctor had walked in, wearing the stereotypical lab-coat, carrying a clip board.
“I never thought he’d ever leave. I thought we’d stay in that flat for the rest of our lives, or until I found someone worth leaving for, but I knew that was never likely to happen, not with Sherlock being such a huge part of my life. It was either one or the other, and I chose a life Sherlock.”
The first thing they'd done was to watch back the CCTV footage in Mycroft's office. John thought it was extremely under furnished – minimalist, in fact. There was no life, not character, no sense of a living being occupying it. Quite the opposite to Baker Street. The white walls reminded him of the walls of a hospital ward, or a prison cell. It felt confining. The carpet was beige, and very dull. The lights were harsh and uncomfortable, john was already starting to get a headache. How Mycroft could work in these conditions he'd never understand. An expensive looking portrait of something – john could not determine what it was – was hung up on the back wall, providing the room with the little colour Mycroft seemed to allow. There was a plant in the corner of the room, just behind the large, overbearing desk. It looked well loved. John laughed to himself, how could Mycroft take better care of a plant than his brother?
But when he returned home at only 10pm that evening, it was obvious the date had not gone as intended. Sherlock had spent most of the evening sat in his armchair, staring at John’s, thinking about how best to hide his attraction from John – who simply could never, under any circumstances ever find out. It would ruin their friendship, and Sherlock couldn’t risk it. Not after he realised that this is what had been missing from his life. No. They needed to remain friends, and that was only going to work if Sherlock didn’t reveal the extent of his feelings to his flat mate.
"John?"
He didn’t sleep at all that night, still in a numb state of disconnection.
Sherlock complied, peeling his eyes open slowly, allowing himself to adjust to the harsh sunlight that was streaming through the windows. Of course it would be sunny today. Pathetic fallacy was an occurrence only found in romantic literature, not in the life of Sherlock Holmes.
He went through the process of masking tea, a routine he was alarmingly familiar with. He watched as the tea leaves dyes the boiling water, the swirling patterns in the cup closely resembling the patterns of the steam that was rising from the hot liquid. He made two cups, a subconscious decision, but probably a good one. He splashed milk in both and added sugar to Sherlock's. Sherlock had a secret sweet-tooth but he would never admit it, not even on his death bed. The teasing from Mycroft would be relentless. With a mug in each hand, and using the warmth that permeated throughout his body from the objects in his palms, he returned from the kitchen counter to the table. It was only when he leaned over to place Sherlock's mug in front of him that he noticed the state the detective was in.
. It's bad enough that I had to bury him today, but please don't make me face the ghosts of our past. I'm not ready to do that."
"Something amusing, Dr Watson?" He was stood behind the desk, at which Sherlock was currently situated, occupying the black, leather office chair that accompanied it.
When he was in that room, he lost all sense of self control. He had shouted, thrown things (luckily the nurse had the good sense to not but him in a room with any heavy or expensive equipment) and finally, his had just cried. His knees gave way and John had found himself knelt down in the middle of the room as his sobs echoes around him.
Greg thought.
He filled the kettle with water and set it to boil, then removed three mugs from the cupboard and placed them on the counter before him. Sherlock had his own mug here, for whenever he felt like he wanted to visit, which had been often. It had an intricate pattern in black and white, similar to the wallpaper at 221B – it was like having a part of his old life here in his new one, with Mary. Mary’s mug was red – her favourite colour – with white polka dots, and John’s was covered in blue and white stripes. They even had a pot of Sherlock’s favourite tea-bags next to the regular ones that John and Mary used. Sherlock was just an irremovable part of their lives. These past few weeks without him had been so strange. There had been no texts, no calls, nothing. Which is why John was very suspicious of Sherlock appearing on their doorstep out of the blue, and requesting a private conversation with Mary.
The consultant looked quite panicked, and John only returned to his chair when he felt Mary’s hand on his shoulder, guiding him down. Mary was in control, providing the stability John needed as his world came crashing down around him.
And Sherlock has felt all of these things acutely. He's knows what it is to be in love, and he knows what it is to have that love unrequited. And it is this, this unrequited love, this adoration, and this sentiment, which nearly becomes the downfall of the great consulting detective.
“Yeah. Actually, I can’t think of a single thing to say."
“Surely your team could handle that?” John interrupted. Sherlock turned to look at him. He was now stood behind Mrs Hudson, one hand on each of her shoulders, her left arm was reaching up to hold his right hand, a defensive position. “Just get hold of the CCTV footage and see if-”
“Yes.” John breathed.
They left very shortly afterwards. Sherlock went home to Baker Street, and John went back to Mary at their home. As soon as John had walked through the door, Mary had turned to him, obviously looking for an argument. However, the moment she'd seen the look on his face, the fight drained out of her. They ended up on the sofa together, Mary with her arms wrapped tightly around John's shoulders as he completely broke down. Seeing Sherlock in such in such a state seemed to not only have emotionally drained John, but also feel intense amounts of pain and sadness himself. He felt Sherlock's loss, had experienced it first hand, and Sherlock, who had always seemed so strong, had completely broken down.
“Greg.” John breathed. “I need to- I- Please.” John’s voice broke on the last word as he quietly begged his unspoken request.
He honestly wasn’t trying to insult John when he’d said those things about being more important than Mary. He just thought that he’d give John the push he needed, and would ensure that he wasn’t fixating on Sherlock when he was supposed to be taking care of his wife. He knew that no-one was more important in John’s life than Mary – it was never even a question.
Mycroft slumped back into the wall, scrubbing his hands across his face and through his thinning, reddish hair.
This, combined with the tightening of fingers around his arms seemed to snap Sherlock back from the confines of his mind palace, or wherever it was that his mind had wondered off to. His eyes were wide and scared. His hand covered John's where it sat on his arm, and his white, bony fingers wrapped themselves around John's shorter, more tanned ones.
Miss you already – JW x
Breathing, breathing’s good, and he was managing to do it without the aid of any apparatus, so the likely hood of him being in a coma was low. Excellent, less chance of any brain damage – although John wait until a discussion with another professional before being absolutely certain.
But more importantly, Sherlock had relapsed. It made John want to punch a wall, want to punch Sherlock. But no. He didn’t. He wanted to hold Sherlock and never let him go, even just to save him from his own mind.
Molly looked past Mycroft’s shoulder in the direction of John’s room and made to move past him. Mycroft laid a gentle, yet firm hand on her shoulder, not wanting to scare the young pathologist, but still to prevent her from perusing his brother.
He opened his mouth to try and convince him to stay, sure he could come up with a reasonable explanation and hoping that maybe, John could help him figure out what kind of mess these emotions had left him in. But in the end, all he could manage was, “I hope you have a nice evening.”
If it weren't for the fact that Sherlock let him into the flat whenever he visited personally, Greg would have ended up summoning Mycroft to sort his younger brother out.
The more time he seemed to spend around John, the harder he fell. Things about John that used to annoy him, still annoyed him, but he never lashed out because it was John. He still continued to show off with his deductions during cases, and John continued to use every synonym of ‘amazing’ that existed. He smiled more at Sherlock, which encouraged Sherlock to smile back, which made John smile more which made Sherlock’s smile brighter and on and on in a vicious circle.
Sherlock brought a hand up to his face to sooth the angry, red skin in the visible form of a hand on his cheek. That had to have hurt, John could practically feel the sting from the slap through the tense atmosphere that had suddenly settled on the room.
“Sherlock, please stop interrupting and let me finish my bloody sentences!” John flashed a fond, teasing smile at the man sat opposite him.
Sherlock threw himself into the wedding plans, playing the part of the best man with passion and enthusiasm. Well, as much passion and enthusiasm that Sherlock could put into something that isn't a case. But despite his efforts, Sherlock seemed distant, like it wasn't actually
“I think it could work.”
He needed to let it out, or the weight of his own secret would surely crush him. He considered talking to Molly, but she wouldn’t understand, having always been infatuated with Sherlock. What he felt for John was not infatuation, he was sure of it. Lestrade? No, he couldn’t bear the smug grin that would undoubtedly appear if he ever revealed any of this to the DI. And there was absolutely no way he was going to Mycroft for help.
John had moved on. John had found someone else – a woman, Mary – and had moved on with his life, a life without Sherlock. The worst thing was that it wasn’t just a short fling, as was John’s previous habit in regards to relationships. No, this was the real thing, John wanted to spend the rest of his life with this woman, this infuriatingly interesting woman who was able to give John everything Sherlock was not. And Sherlock was left lonely again.
From Romania he'd gone to Switzerland, and from there to Bangladesh, to Thailand, to Japan, to China, until his most recent destination - Serbia. He never spent any longer than a few weeks in these places, but Serbia was proving to be a bit of a problem. John had been there nearly three months before information of any worth had been given to him. Finally, they had the man they were looking for.
"Sherlock?"
Molly listened to John intently. She could understand John’s concerns. It must have been hell for him, to lose Sherlock like that so suddenly. It was now molly’s turn to feel the pang of guilt, as she had played an active part in Sherlock’s fake death. She was partially responsible for the rift in their relationship.
"John-"
Sherlock considered this. His first assumption was that John was medically interested in Sherlock’s injuries. But with further thought, he realised it was sentiment. John cared about Sherlock, and wanted to make sure he was okay, despite the fact that Sherlock had just waltzed back into his life, potentially messing John up mentally. Yet Sherlock’s safety and well-being was still the most important thing on John’s mind. A strange sensation swept through Sherlock, the same sensation he felt as he stood atop St Barts.
"Sherlock, you can't do this."
Love you loads,
"There's an Italian restaurant  I enjoy just off of Northumberland Street, and the owner owes me a favour." He did not want to explain the sentimental attachment to Angelo's, so left it there.
"Knew me?" His tone was cutting, icy. "Am I dead? Do you no longer remember me? I was under the impression that I was the one suffering from post-traumatic amnesia. So, tell me Doctor Watson, how can it be that you 'knew me'?"
"John, the longer I stay here, the longer Moriarty has the advantage, the longer we're in danger."
Why did all the worst things happen to people who absolutely did not deserve it?
Yes, returning to normality was good. Very good indeed.
Sherlock easily returned the stare that Moriarty was giving to him, ice meeting fire, genius and madman locked together in an internal battle that John was not a part of.
After about thirty minutes of silence, each man wrapped up in their own thoughts, the car pulled up again. Only Sherlock got out of the car. John was waiting to be summoned, but Sherlock returned five minutes later. He carried with him a beautiful bouquet of flowers. It looked very similar to a wedding arrangement. It was made up of rustic pink roses, with sprigs of gypsophila and ivy leaves.
"Don't sound so accusing," no such luck, "we're not teenagers, it wasn't gossip."
"It was a minor tear. The laceration itself needed no surgery. However, he will be in quite a bit of pain, but he can breathe, he can talk, he can eat, he's alive. Pulmonary laceration is not associated with long term problems, however, we do recommend that he comes in for a check up a few weeks after he's been discharged, just as a precaution. We'll need to keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't get infected."
"Yeah, alright. No need to show off you lanky git."
The funeral was on a Thursday.
As John made his way into the brisk London air, his legs defaulted to the familiar route which took him to his favourite pub.
"Talk to him," was all he had said to him, and then escorted John personally to Baker Street.
“It doesn’t matter, he’s Sherlock. It’s what he does. Why would he stop just because you told him?” The two broke apart, trying to cover up even more laughter.
"Call me Liz," she introduced. "Now, if we don't get a move on soon Mr Holmes, we shall loose the light of the sun, which will not only make everything a pain to see without torches, but it will also be quite cold, and these overalls aren't incredibly good at keeping you warm." She shot a quick glance at John, who had to stifle his laughter again – why were all the good ones married?.
“Are you implying that I’m not decent company?
“How high up?” Sherlock questioned.
Then Sherlock had sacrificed everything, a life for a life. He stayed silent and still on the pavement, even though John’s frantic pleas to let him through were killing him to hear.
“John, when I first met you, I said that you would be the making of my brother, or make him worse than ever. As I said, I am not often wrong. You were undoubtedly the best thing that ever happened to Sherlock Holmes. You didn’t see him before he met you. He was a mess. You just limped into his life – nothing special – and picked it up and turned it around. I envied you John.”
John supposed he had every right to do so after everything he’d been through. His best friend had (albeit temporarily) forgotten his existence, he’d watched his wife struggle through a brutal fight with cancer only to lose her at the end, and their lives had once again been poisoned with the presence of the infamous consulting criminal, whom John was quite happy to see die at the hand of the same best friend who’d suffered amnesia but after an encounter with Moriarty and a short stay in hospital, regained his memories.
"I am not 'sweet', don't treat me like a child, John."
Sherlock's head snapped up. His eyes locked with Liz and they shared a look. Sherlock looked utterly amazed and, quite frankly, struck-dumb, a concept that had never to this day been applicable to Sherlock Holmes. The moment would have lasted longer, had John not cleared his throat to make introductions.
“Could you turn the radio off please?” Sherlock’s voice sounded so fragile and broken, as if he was 8 years old again and had scraped his knee after falling from a particularly high tree.
"Not my problem, you're not real." He needed to keep repeating it, almost as if confirming it to himself. The thought was ridiculous. Sherlock was the most intelligent person he knew (except Mycroft, but Sherlock was never going to admit that out loud), and he was well aware that the image of John in front of him was simply that, an image. But that didn't stop the tiny glimmer of hope from planting itself inside Sherlock's mind, and everyday he woke up hope against all hope that today would be the day that John was no longer just a hallucination.
“You don’t give her enough credit, not even nearly enough,” commented the doctor, bringing Sherlock back to the present.
Greg turned his attention to Mycroft. Usually, their interactions were kept at a minimum, their only common concern being Sherlock.
There was silence.
Sherlock’s stomach lurched and his head felt like it was splitting in two. The song was getting louder, he was surrounded by it, trapped, suffocating.
He set the mugs on the coffee table and straightened up. Sherlock and Mary both reached for theirs immediately.
Special shoutout to my friend Jennie! You rock Jennie!
“Sherlock, if you don’t understand why I need to know, then you clearly don’t know me as well as you think you do. Please just tell me. I need to know.”
John needed this, he needed the comfort, and was grateful that Sherlock had the good sense to deduce what John needed.
"That's not the point, Sherlock." John pinched the bridge of his nose, as he would have done if he. Was irritated when he was alive. He let out a long, heavy sigh before promptly changing the subject. "So... Molly. Are you two..?" A sly, curious smile graced his features and he sat more forward in his chair, leaning towards Sherlock.
“Is this about Sherlock?” John cut off Nurse Lawson, desperate to hear news about his missing friend.
"Fancy getting something to eat, Molly?"
"Yes, although, from the sounds of your blog, you and your partner in crime seem to cope just fine on your own." John felt a flush of colour sweep across his face.
Sherlock froze, fingers ceasing to tap immediately. Sherlock turned to John, who was sat in his chair reading a book Sherlock did not care to remember the title of. One hand was holding the book; the other was resting against his cheek.
He allowed the tears to flow freely as the plane took off, there was no-one here to judge him now. He brought his hand up to his lips, the one John had held not moments before, and tried to imagine the feel of his skin, to imagine that it was John’s kiss goodbye. But after only a few moments of tense silence, Sherlock’s thoughts were interrupted by a man offering him a phone.
"I know, I just didn't know what else to do. I'm not the doctor around here-" Molly let out a horrified gasp at what shed just said, tears springing to her own eyes. "I'm sorry, Sherlock. I didn't mean to- I wasn't- I'm sorry."
John wanted to keep talking, but he found that he could not. His voice was trapped in his throat. Sherlock's eyes were closed again. John knew this was so he could think better. So he could absorb all of the new information into his brain and let it filter. He would then file it away wherever he saw fit in his mind palace. Once again, his fingers were steepled under his chin, in the position John had named: Sherlock's Default. Happy, sad, confused, angry, whatever emotion, Sherlock's fingers would always steeple themselves as they tucked under his chin.
After leaving the flat, Sherlock made his way to the only place he could think to go – St Bart’s. He needed data, science, facts. Not these stupid, useless feelings that the rest of the world insisted on having. No. He was not like the rest of the world.
John had always viewed that moment as the moment their relationship defined itself. It had been obvious from the start that the two men would mean a great deal to each other, but neither of them could ever gauge just how much.
“Mine? Why?” It wasn’t a question he was asking them, he was asking himself. He replaced the mug on the coffee table and stood up off of the sofa in one swift movement. “I have to go now, I’m sorry.” He bent down and planted a quick kiss on Mary’s cheek. “Thank you, Mary.”
Which brings us back to the empty, grey corridor.
“Come on John,” said Sherlock, still chucking with his deep laugh, almost like a cat’s purr, “let’s go home.”
“Sherlock-“
“So, stranger, where have you been hiding?”
This time was only for a basic once over after their encounter on the roof. John was quite content to sit there and let the nurses fuss. The reason being that, even if he closed his eyes, Sherlock made his presence known to everyone in the room and most importantly to John, reassuring him that he was okay, despite the fact he was sat not three meters away on the examination table in the next room threatening to have Mycroft have their medical licences revoked due to their incompetence. God, the man was such a Drama queen. If anything, the showdown on the rooftop just proved this.
“What?” He asked when he noticed their stares.
"You're the one that died. You're the one who left me in this state."
“Excuse me?”
John couldn't see anything of interest where Sherlock was pointing, but he heard a small gasp of understanding from where he knew Liz was standing. "Of course!" she moved forwards to where Sherlock was stood and looked at the patch of ground he was gesturing to. John followed.
"Sherlock, this was nobody's fault."
“You knew.”
She sighed in resignation and turned back to her blood samples. Sherlock walked around the lad a few times, under the pretense of finding something interesting to experiment with, but the whole time he kept his gaze on Molly, still trying to deduce the reason for the change in her behaviour. But try as he might, he could not deduce a single thing, and accepted the fact that it was probably in the locked corridor of his mind palace. After his third loop of the lab, Molly turned back to him, obviously buzzing with frustration that he too was experiencing.
John and Sherlock finally looked up at each other. Sherlock’s face was still set in the cool mask he wore which he used to cover his true emotions. Only 3 people had ever seen him when he lowered this mask. Molly, Mrs Hudson and John.
He had tried his best to comfort her. He held her close, just as she had done, rubbing small circles into her back, not caring that she was leaving black marks from her tears on the shoulder of his jumper. He repeatedly reminded her that it was only temporary, just until Sherlock recovered – if he ever did. He told her that he loved her with every cell in his body, and that was not going to change no matter what was happening in John’s life, or however many miles separated them. He promised to tell her everyday just how much he loved her, and thanked her for putting his life back together after the incident involving Moriarty, St Bart’s rooftop and Sherlock.
“I give up.” John was still smiling as he raised his eyes to the ceiling now, talking almost silently to himself.
They pulled up to Baker Street, still laughing - for there is no better way to return to your home than laughing with your best friend as anyone, including the Holmes brothers, will tell you. They paid the cabbie, who was glad to see the back of them, and proceeded to the door. At Sherlock's request they knocked instead of letting themselves in, and waited for Mrs Hudson to answer.
Another flash of colour. A brilliant blood red splattered across a gloomy grey. And there was John’s face again. This time his face was above Sherlock, angled down towards him. The same blank, empty look clouded his features.
“Yes we do.”
It would kill Sherlock for John to admit this, but Mycroft had been right. Sherlock was here perfectly healthy, memory restored.
“He looked like a lost goldfish with his mouth open like that! He looked unable to form a coherent thought!”
John smiled. "I'd like to meet this sister of yours, it seems that I owe her a thank-you at least. Sherlock's very particular, and what you did today was extraordinary." Liz's eye's sparkled.
.’ Jason, he knew what I was thinking, he knew. And I know I sound crazy right now, but I promise that its true.”
One month. He had spent one month away from John. He was exhausted; he felt paper thin, translucent. And most importantly, he was alone again. He had not sought out John, but John had not sought him out either. But why would he? John did not feel for Sherlock as Sherlock felt for John. John had a wife now, and a baby on the way. John didn’t need him anymore.
"Come on, John! If we have any hope of finding Lawson it will be by tracking these idiots that were paid to carry out this stage. If we're lucky, we'll at least have a location by the end of the evening." Sherlock bundled him in the cab, barked out Mycroft's address and they set off. Sherlock stared out of the window for the vast majority of the journey, lost in his mind palace presumably. John didn't want to disturb him to find out. About 10 minute in, John's phone buzzed. He opened the unread text message.
"Yours, you bloody prat. You know that this is a stage of the mourning process. A bit extreme in your case but still."
John snorted. “You truly are an idiot. I was thinking about you, and how much I’d rather be treating you to dinner than her.”
As it turned out, Mycroft needed no summons. Whenever Greg visited Sherlock, he would often find Mycroft sat in Sherlock's armchair, but never John's. Sherlock did not allow anyone to sit in John's chair, ever. He wasn't eating, that much was obvious.
"Charing Cross Hospital," she trilled to the driver, and the car began moving into the darkness towards the hospital and, more importantly, towards Sherlock.
“Sherlock Holmes don’t you ever let me hear you saying that again!”
He heard the door behind him opening, and looked around to see Mrs Hudson arrive with handfuls of shopping bags.
"He called me John
John had been completely broken. He had grieved. Admittedly, Sherlock hadn't thought John would mourn his loss. He didn't comprehend how much he meant to John. And John meant the world to him too. Listening to John's words as he lay on the pavement, unable to move for fear of exposing himself, then separating from him for two years - it was hard. It had taken it's toll on the both of them.
Of all the hateful fantasies his mind had conjured of John, this was the worst. He'd seen John alive, happy, smiling. He'd talked to him, laughed with him, argued with him, everything they'd done together when John actually was alive. He'd seen John dead, his corpse spread out on a concrete pavement. But not this. Never had his mind been so cruel.
Sherlock had followed him in, having taken a taxi here together. He’d watched John from the doorway, trying to anticipate any sudden reaction.
After this brief deduction, Sherlock returned to the matter at hand. He let out a loud sigh and prepared himself for what he was about to do.
"No, Sherlock. I'm not going to let you do that." John's voice was shaking in poorly hidden rage, and Sherlock flinched again at the harsh tone. He needed to get over weaknesses like this. He was in 221B, he was with John, he was
John's head was spinning.
"But not my best friend. You were the only friend I had, John. And you didn't just die. You purposefully jumped to your death and you made me stand there and watch. That's how it's your fault."
"Miller?" John looked questioningly at the girl.
John stared into the distance, focused on nothing in particular.
Sherlock opened his eyes, meeting John's deep blue ones, shaking his head yet again.
"Jesus. I've broken you."
Sherlock swallowed, and he began to fiddle with the blanket he was sat on. John waited. He had all day, and - according to reliable sources including, Mrs Hudson, Mary and Lestrade - the patience of a saint. John folded his arms and just watched, waiting.
It took several hours of silence before Mary drifted off to sleep. John was never asked to leave – he suspect’s Mycroft’s involvement.
"Bloody hell, I'm sorry."
John didn’t move, and was sure that even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t have been able. Mycroft’s word seemed to have frozen him where he stood, just staring. Mycroft let out a rather loud, irritated sigh. “Shock is not becoming of you Doctor Watson, and I’d seriously suggest closing your mouth before you choke on the amount of flies you will inevitably catch if you continue to do so.” And with that, Mycroft dropped his hand back to his side, giving John a chance to collect himself and reflect on what had just been said to him.
When he took the tea into the living room, Sherlock had migrate from the chair to the sofa, sitting with his legs crossed, facing Mary, who also had her legs crossed. They looked like young teenage girls on a sleepover, and John had to laugh. They both looked up at him, and smiled. John was more surprised to see Sherlock smiling at him. It was if all had been forgiven between them, which was ridiculous because John hadn’t even apologised yet.
“I’m sorry?” She sputtered, obviously trying to collect herself after the brief moment of surprise. Sherlock leaned over towards her, narrowing his eyes as he scanned her and took in her whole appearance. She’d put on 6lbs since he last remembered her. Sherlock was just about to point this out to her, but something in his mind which sounded alarmingly like John’s voice told him that this would be ‘a bit not good’. He settled instead fro getting to the root of his problem.
"Well, let's get started. Let's finish this game once and for all."
But it wasn’t real. They had been lied to, left to grieve, and Mycroft hadn’t done a damn thing about it.
“Christ John, you’ve not changed a bit.” A gruffer, more weathered voice joined the first.
Greg entered the flat. Absolutely nothing had changed since John had died, expect from the thick layer of dust that seemed to have settled onto every non-moving surface in the flat.
Sherlock closed his eyes against the tears that betrayed that inside he was being torn into shreds. Nothing had ever hurt like this.
Inside of 221B Baker Street, the world seemed to have stopped. Silence engulfed the flat, the only noise being the slow breathing of the consulting detective. The silence was driving Sherlock mad, only highlighting just how alone he actually was, and his heart ached.
“Uh,” John tried clearing his throat, which had become oddly tight. “We might have had an argument.”
“I did not abandon her! How
“Do you remember what happened the last time someone doubted me Lestrade?” Sherlock shot him a furious look. “Or do I need to remind you?” Sherlock was shaking with rage, his hands screwed up into fists at his side. John noticed this and moved forward.
Lestrade sighed and then nodded. He released his grip and let John climb into the back of the ambulance. The paramedics tried to stop him, but after John spent a few moments just looking at them with a confused expression, Lestrade stepped in and explained the situation. Finally, John was allowed access into the vehicle. He sat down across from Sherlock, who was now being seen to by two different paramedics. The doors closed and they began to drive away, swaying with the movements of the ambulance as it made its way through the streets of London.
Whilst being detained, Mycroft came to visit Sherlock to discuss their options, like there was a choice. Sherlock knew there was only one option available to him, as Mycroft had mentioned at Christmas. Sherlock would have to travel back to Eastern Europe to complete an undercover, and fatal mission, with no chance of returning. Sherlock accepted. There was nothing for him here. The work didn’t matter anymore, not when John was not a part of it. He didn’t have anyone, not even John.
"Thank God for Molly otherwise you'd never get out of the flat."
“No, neither can I.”
“Neither of us are happy, John. Something needs to change.”
“Sir Boast-A-Lot was the bravest, best and most intelligent of all the knights. He was always showing off to the other knights, especially to the court physician and the king himself He was always telling people how brilliant, amazing and fascinating he was.” The man laughed, cruel and taunting. Sherlock felt the blood drain out of his face as he realized who this story was really about. The man’s face then spread into a pout, bottom lip sticking out and eyes wide as he continued with the ‘story’. “Sir Boast-A-Lot was full of sentiment, too busy fighting silly dragons and self-sacrificing to notice how boring he’d become. There were a fair few ruffians that Sir Boast-A-Lot had encountered and dealt with over his time, and one decided that he’d had enough now.” His smile had returned, but now it was not manic, it was hungry, almost predatory. It sent a jolt of ice down Sherlock’s spine, and yet he still could not look away.
“Mrs Hudson, would you let Sherlock and I cook you dinner tomorrow evening?”
Since their return to Baker Street, Sherlock had reacquainted himself with his beloved home. Losing his memory had left him out of sync and he had spent the previous evenings just sat in his leather armchair, breathing in the atmosphere withing the wall of 221B. He had been happy, content to just sit there forever listening to the sounds of life both inside and outside of the flat. He listened to Mrs Hudson shuffling carefully up the stairs to check up on her two boys, to the sounds of the cabs driving past their windows, the laughter and conversations of the customers of Speedy's. But his favourite sound was that of John. Just John, existing, breathing, living. He was a reassuring presence in the flat, and Sherlock relied on it to keep him calm whilst he solved the Moriarty enigma.
It was only another stay in the hospital and several months away from Mary that Sherlock finally managed to convince John to forgive his wife. She could make John happy, John loved her, she loved John and they were expecting a child together. And now Mary could also provide John with adventure and the sense of danger that he had so obviously been missing before. They were perfectly suited to each other, and Sherlock was redundant. The couple reunited at Christmas, which was horribly cliché, but if it made John happy, Sherlock was not going to complain. What he was going to complain about would be the pitying looks both his mother and father gave him every time he was within a close proximity of the former army doctor. Of course they knew, Sherlock could not hide anything from them, he had never been able to. His parents meant well, he knew that, which is why he still felt slightly guilty about drugging their punch, but he had important business to attend to.
John had tried to follow him one day. As soon as Sherlock put his his great grey coat and his navy blue scarf was wrapped snugly around his neck, John had reached for his own coat. But as he'd tried to walk out of the door, Sherlock had simply turned to John and stared at him, brows furrowed, as if he was confused as to why John was trying to follow him. John didn't even try to push the issue further, and allowed Sherlock to leave. Of course he was curious. But even though Sherlock had a problem respecting John's privacy, John prided himself on his respect for other people's boundaries.
