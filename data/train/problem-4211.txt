The drive was silent, much like Sam, Dean kept checking the driver seat to make sure that Cas wouldn't disappear.
He snuggled closer to Castiel and difted off to sleep.
"Then why did he reject me Sammy?" He pleaded, Dean just wanted answers.
"Dammit Cas." He strokes the man's hair out of his eyes and thumbs his cheekbone.
It never came and the silence wrapped around him like thick black icy tendrils him enveloping him in a cruel embrace.
"Dean if this is some sort of ploy I will smite you even without my powers."
"I wasn't tired." He said matter of factly. "What are you drinking?" "Coffee Jack, you've never had coffee?" The child just shook his head. Dean shrugged and handed him the mug.
"You sure?" But Cas was already pushing him deeper with his legs.
“Mr. Novak, no phones in class, detention after school for you as well.” He said will a telling smirk; oh, he defiantly got a sick kick out of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He grasped Castiel's hand and brought it to the side of his face. His green eyes begged kiss me, do something, anything. "Cas I-" He pressed a soft kiss to the angel's mouth, Dean didn't dare deepen the kiss. They stayed like that for a moment, but then they heard Sam's footsteps coming their way and the angel pulled back as if he'd been burned.
"Soooo." Sam blew. "What's going on between you two?" Leaning forward with morbid curiosity.
(See the end of the chapter for
Chuck threw them aside as if they were nothing. “Thanks for the heads-up son.” he smiled as he killed his eldest child without a care. “Now.” He said. “You really thought you could beat me?”
Dean uses one finger to push inside his lover and he feels the muscles spasm from his touch.
Jack brought back everyone, everyone that was lost, everyone that they couldn't’ save. and said that now he would let the natural order of things take over, no more meddling and getting involved but everyone deserved another chance.
Jack snapped his fingers and Dean and Sam were healed.
Then Castiel spoke. "Dean. It's not like there was anything that was going to make me truly happy."
Bill stomped up to the bar and slammed a $50 on the table. "Gimme as many rounds of beer as this will buy." Then he looked over to Dean who was staring at him. "You got a problem, pretty boy?" He said gruffly. "No, no problem." He turned on the Dean charm. "Just wanted to ask you a few questions is all." Bill just glared as Dean showed him his badge. "And then I'll let you be on your way, it's about the murders, the two couples whose bodies were found in the woods."
"Why wasn't it me?" Sam stops dead in his tracks. "Y-you wanted it to be you?" Castiel nodded weakly. "He kissed me, I was so frustrated with him that I pushed him away, but he has Steve now..."
Castiel looked at her shocked, and cupped her cheek. “Oh Hannah, I’m sorry.” He smiled sadly.
Then he added another finger, and another until he knew for sure that Castiel was ready.
Dean tries to respond but the words get stuck in his throat. "Your new boyfriend wouldn't be pleased to know that you have been kissing other men." He huffed irrationally.
Dean knew that the future would be full of heartbreak, just like the past, there would be loss and pain.
He snapped them again and again and again. “What?” He said sounding scared now. “How?” He started backing away from Jack as the boy reached for him.
Dean then proceeded to tell Chuck how they knew Michael would betray them and how Jack, ever since the explosion in the empty had become a power vacuum that had absorbed all the energy that he was exposed to, that also being Chuck’s power when he beat up the Winchester’s and Chucks ignorance and ego had led to his own downfall.
Dean looks at him with a sudden sadness plauging his face.
Castiel looks intently into his eyes.
"Dude it could just be a hate crime, some homophobic sickos."
"Dean!" Castiel exclaimed, but Dean just kept walking.
"He kissed you!? Cas man, I don't know what to say, I guess I didn't really know you felt like that. I always figured that Dean had feelings for you but I never imagined..." He trailed off as Dean opened the bathroom door.
"Werewolves, well I think so anyway, a couple had their hearts ripped from their chests, and another couple even closer to the crime scene." Sam stared at his laptop some more. "Says that it happened in Wisconsin, the place is an 8 hour drive from here so we need to move now."
He healed Dean's wounds and waited for him to wake up as the last flicker of his grace died out.
Castiel hastily sped out of the classroom.
"Have you seen anything or anyone strange recently? Just anything that just didn't feel right." The bartender pondered. "Well there was those murders, the gay couples." He nodded.
Castiel blushed again, if only he knew.
“Chuck! You son of a bitch! Coward come down here and fight!” He called up at God.
Mr. Hall had been found with his husband Pete in the woods, their hearts had been ripped from their bodies and the same thing had happened with John and Andrew a mile from the first murders.
He was pulled from his thoughts by his phone going off. It was Hannah. He answered her call.
Gabriel was a brother to him, he was mischievous and always had some form of candy in his mouth, he had light blond hair that came just above his shoulders and hazel eyes that glinted menacingly whenever he had the opportunity to be a ‘Little shit.’ But his friends kept him grounded, especially since the death of his parents.
Castiel is back and misunderstandings occur.
He removed his hand from Cas’ spent cock which was now sensitive and starting to soften.
Castiel wakes up to the sound of his alarm, the sun eagerly beaming down on his face telling him to get the fuck up. He groans and rolls over, enjoying the coolness of the pillow on his face mixed with the warmness of being under the blanket.
"Steve's-" But he never got to finish. Castiel gave him a
Last chapter hope you enjoy! Sorry it took so long, I was struggling with what I wanted the ending to be. It will be happy because we deserve happy right now.
Then another thought popped into Castiel's head. Was the deal with the Empty still on? Now that he was human and had a soul he couldn't reside in the Empty.
"Cas?"
Cas goes ridged underneath him. "What?"
Dean stopped. "Who Lucifer? He was an evil son of a-"
Castiel let's out a pitiful whine. "What's the matter Cas? Never had your dick sucked before?" He teases.
Dean was nervous as he approached the bar, not that he and Cas couldn't stand up for themselves but other people can be discriminating, he thought Castiel was oblivious to his discomfort but the angel grabbed his hand. "Let them stare." He challenged and Dean squeezed back gently in response and placed a kiss to Castiel's temple.
"Wake up lovebirds, we are here." Sam's amused tone mixed with the slamming of a door jolted them both awake.
"What?" She laughs. "Let me guess, you'll kill me?" Dean just grins and shakes his head. "Oh we are way past that now." He looks directly into her eyes. "Killing would be a mercy for what I'm about to do to you."
Sam just sits at the table waiting for his brothers return, Dean wasn't picking up, he had been gone for hours.
"I wanted to check if you were angry at me for doing the right thing, evidently you still are. Goodbye Dean."
"Dean!" The younger Winchester called behind him as he made his way up the bunker stairs.
Sam came in round the corner after hearing a crack. "Dean what the fuck."
Steve nods in understanding. "And you're Sam?"
Castiel got up and sauntered towards Dean, almost tripping over.
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel and pulled him close, he fell into a deep satisfied sleep and Castiel watched over him.
"Sam." He greeted. "It's good to see you." As he came up and wrapped his arms around the stunned hunter.
smuttt
Castiel’s heart fluttered. “Uh wait lemme check.” He opened his laptop and sure enough he saw the post on the popular forum. It read.
Castiel groaned and felt a pat on his shoulder, he quickly whipped round to be met with the face of Dean Winchester.
A dark haired, blue eyed male answered the door. "Hey...can I help you?" His gruff voice was very Cas like, everything about him was. His boxers hung from his naked torso.
“How?” Chuck whimpered on the ground.
"I was saving your life, it worked." He said getting up. "Unfortunately I am human now."
Castiel was glad that she didn’t give him that whole ‘Breakfast is the most important meal of the day’ crap.
“Fuck Cas so tight.” Dean purred.
He stole a duffel bag and shoved all his belongings in the bag.
"Shit Cas I mean-" He scrabbles for an answer.
but something about her screamed power. She caressed the side of his face and traced her long fingers on his cheekbone. Castiel looked disgruntled and very uncomfortable, Dean wished that he could just reach out and hold his hand but he stood still waiting for her to make the first move.
"Is it necessary for me to wear so much flannel?" He says as Dean chucks a pack of boxers in their shopping cart.
Dean slicked up his fingers with lube and but some around Cas’s hole, he started penetrating him by using one finger and Cas breathed deeply as the first finger went in. Slowly Dean started to move it in and out.
"I love you." He trembled. "Goodbye Dean" Castiel went to grab Dean's shoulder, pushing him to the wall and out of the way of the Empty. There he stood with a smile on his face, impending black tendrils speeding towards him. This was right, this is how he goes out. Metatron's words echoed in his head, ultimately it was all about saving one human. At least he got to tell Dean how he felt, see him one last time before he was taken...now he can finally rest.
"Uhh, heh..no not Cas? Steve." He offers his hand to Dean and retracts it awkwardly when Dean continues to stare...Steve...Steve...he breaks a little more inside.
Then Dean got off him which made him whine. “Calm down Cas I’m getting something.” He reached into his draw franticly searching so he could get back to what he was doing.
Once inside Castiel went straight to the room that the Winchesters had allocated him. Sleeping and dreaming again felt weird.
He was still pretty smashed, his alcohol tolerance as a human was terrible.
"Dean please need you." He almost begged. His pretty pink flushed cock was straining between his thighs, it almost looked painful. God this guy hadn't been layed in years, he almost took pity, there was no way that Castiel would last that long so Dean took his cock and started to jack off to get closer to the edge. "Fuck Cas."
“Hear what?” He questioned.
“Awh you’re no fun.” Dean frowned playfully and then looked to Cas again with a boyish smile. “We’re friends right Cas?”
"Yeah he's uh, he's just a quiet guy, say do you think that those guys would show up around now?" Just as Dean had said that an angry looking man in a black biker jacket burst through the door followed by three more bearded angry men in biker boots.
Jack became the new God and fixed heaven, he often popped by to see how his family were doing.
“Jesus Fuck Cas, I have never seen someone come that much, not even in porn.” The manor of Castiel’s release made Dean forget about his own because now Cas’ O face was etched into his mind, how was he ever supposed to get anything done now?
Chuck landed the first blow on Sam and Dean cringed but a fist hit him in the face. He could hear Castiel yelling, trying to help him, petrified that he couldn’t while Chuck was beating them to a bloody pulp, Dean’s head was pounding, his arm was broken and he could hear Sam’s cries of pain. But he got up and so did his brother.
"Yeah well this ain't gonna be like last time, you belong in the bunker with m- us." He quickly stopped himself.
“Oh my god Cas did you hear?”
Sam gave his older brother a once over. “Dean? Whose blood is that?” Dean didn’t answer he just kept staring at the almost empty bottle of whisky.
"You are." He agreed but then he swiftly pulled Dean back to his mouth before he could say anything.
“I’ve come to break you out!” She exclaimed. “To discuss Halloween plans.”
Just need some fluffff
So Dean did.
Dean huffed and pushed past him to get back to his bedroom, he flopped on to his bed and just stared at the ceiling.
Uhm well this is my first time writing explicit gay porn, hope you enjoyed. I had a bit of a writers block with this story, I get it with most stories that's why I never finish, but I powered through for you guys :)
"Come in Cas." Castiel entered the room gingerly.
"Rough night?" The man beside him asks. He turns to face him, he was about to tell the guy to mind his own but "C-cas." He stumbles brokenly. Pricing blue eyes, brown hair and a strong jawline.
"Why did he reject you?" Sam didn't even sound surprised.
Ironically his head was the only place where he could be himself despite his heterosexual conscience banging on the walls of his mind, it was the thing that told him to pull away from Castiel when things got too 'gay.' Well he wasn't listening anymore, ignoring his in-the-closet angst he sucks and nips at Castiels chest leaving the angel breathless.
"Well...yeah."
Dean and Castiel gave each other looks and silently agreed to go. "It's a date." Dean teased.
They talked for a while longer, turned out that Steve was a classic rock fan, they seemed to be getting along. But one shot turned into two and Dean found himself almost pining for this guy, him...or Cas.
Soft, happy, smut. ;))
Castiel nodded sharply. “I won’t tell your aunt about this but tread lightly.”
But fuck that because he is here in the present and today nothing can ruin his mood.
Gabriel was no doubt home already guzzling candy so Castiel walked home alone.
"Dean, I don't wish to talk about this."
He lay down next to Dean and Dean once again closed their distance by putting his head on the angel's shoulder and a hand on his chest. Castiel took his arm and wrapped it around Dean pulling him closer.
He rushes over to see Dean on the floor with a massive bloody gash in his chest, he was positive that it went right through. Castiel is there too after smiting the Wendigo with a righteous fury.
The sensations were too much for Castiel, he moaned Dean's name over and over then he seized up and shuddered, his orgasm ripped through him and he sobbed his release into the crook of Dean's neck.
"Please just hold me, I need you." And this time he wasn't ashamed to admit it.
The pleasure leaves him vulnerable and during his dopamine high he says something that he didn't think he'd say to another soul.
"Sammy this is Steve, he uh took care of m-" Dean stopped as tan trenchcoat came into view. "I've been calling and calling you man, even on my way here but you didn't pick up." His younger brothers words became white noise as he walked towards...no...fuck...you're dead.
"I do."
Dean thrust in trying to avoid Cas’ prostate, poor guy might stroke out.
Fantasies can be cruel, they can give you what you most want and take it away, ripping you from your heaven and leaving you alone wishing that you could go back, be happy, forget that none of it was real, to forget the sharp thorn of reality just for one beautiful second.
Jack had been so happy to have Cas back but he told them all that he couldn’t come back to the bunker, they understood
"Maybe you'll stop your incessant chatter when you watch me torture your angel." She smiled again. "I'll start with his chest, wouldn't want to ruin that pretty face of his." She tapped the side of his face with her hand affectionately. "Then maybe I'll move my knife down south." She stared menacingly at his crotch and the angel's eyes widened.
Castiel nodded. “I do.”
"Met in a bar."
They both fell asleep in each other's arms, as they would do so for the rest of their lives.
Castiel was human.
"Dean." Comes the deep gravelly voice. "I need you." He whispers pulling Deans hand to his boxers. Dean obliges and pulls them of quickly, doing the same to his own.
At age fifteen Castiel’s girlfriend Meg had told him that she may be falling in love with him, Castiel merely squeaked out a “Thanks!” And run off leaving her hurt and confused, they soon broke it off.
Castiel moaned loudly as Dean ground into him and clutched at Deans waist.
"No sir..." He whispered.
Dean and Charlie got up to leave but Castiel stayed behind. “Something you would like to say Novak?”
Dean pulled away from his lover, his expression of embarrassment was twinned with the angel's. He saw Castiel adjust his slacks and he did the same, still red in the face.
He waited for Green’s response and groaned at his attempt at flirting.
“I heard your prayer Dean; you don’t need to say anything.”
"Don't leave me please Dean don't go." Desperately pressing kisses to his face and chest.
Apparently, the answer was yes because his hands had already started making a fake account before his brain could scream ‘No!’
. He thought to himself. He didn’t need Dean to say it back because Castiel had said enough for the both of them, this was where his story ended, where it was always going to end, all he felt was relief as he was enveloped by darkness.
Blue eyes flicked up to meet green, Castiel became very aware of their close proximity. Did he get this all wrong?
“I’m already home, Hannah.” He looked over and smiled at Dean who was getting annoyed at Gabriel's antics.
"No." He bit out.
He went to the bathroom and splashed water on his face. There were dark circles around his eyes dispite him having slept for almost a whole day.
"You thought wrong!" Dean growled as he grabbed Castiel's coat. "You think I'm just gonna let you walk out on me again?"
"You can touch me now." Dean says as he places a gentle kiss to his jaw.
Castiel had fallen asleep in the back of the impala, Dean kept checking on him from rearview mirror.
Sam sighs and goes to bed.
Castiel gets a response and is eager to reply.
"Dean..."
Castiel trailed kisses down his neck and pressed his lips to Deans jaw.
"So impatient." He tuts. "So desperate for me." He reaches for the tie holding Cas' hands together and makes short work of it.
"Dean!" Sam yelled, attempting to keep his brother conscious, how the hell did it get the drop on him?
Dean grinned again and kissed Castiel roughly. "Yeah?" He started to undo Castiel's belt.
The rest of the drive was silent.
Jack brought everyone back, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
"Since you're a regular Joe now Cas, you're gonna need clothes and stuff." He turned into the parking garage of a large mall.
"Knock yourself out." Jack just looked confused. "How?" He questioned with a furrowed brow. "Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of me trying coffee?" Dean felt the tears, god he was so much like him...god Cas I miss you so much.
Gabriel let out an undignified snort. “Didn’t know you were one for dick jokes Cassie.”
Dean drowns his sorrows at a bar and meets Steve.
Tell him everything.
He places a gentle kiss to Castiel's forehead.
Luckily that little mind rant had distracted him, but now he needed something else to distract him, his old friend Mr. Whisky.
Castiel smiled at the email, this guy sounded great.
The next morning he woke up and Castiel was there by his side, they immediately got to work on some slow, passionate morning sex.
Castiel couldn't think let alone breath, he pulled back panting heavily.
He felt embarrassed to be so emotional and weak in front of a stranger but her presence was quite soothing.
Dean woke up with a sob, his chest felt constricted, he couldn't breathe.
Did Dean know about Cas' feelings? Was he trying to hurt him purposefully?
“S-sure if you’ll have me.” He responded.
"It looks like you got pissed and are lying on the floor, what are you planning an escape?"
When his body had finally stopped his hand went straight for the toothbrush and used half the tube of toothpaste to get the taste of bile out of his mouth.
“About what happened.” Castiel starts to say.
"Did you ever speak to Mr. Hall? Or any of the other victims."
"I think it's best if I go Dean. Call me whenever you need help with a case."
He sits on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. "I'm so sorry."
"Did you mean it?"
Cas doesn't want him like that, it hurts so damn much but he has to get through the pain.
After a few more fast thrusts Cas seizes up and his eyes go wide, he throws his head back and moans loudly as his hips jerk wildly. "Dean! Yes yes yes!" He comes so hard it splatters on his chest and face, all over Dean's hand and even some in his dark hair, by the end of it he is shaking and whimpering.
They both looked at each other, eyes locking. His eyes raked him up and down and he licked his lips, pale with cold. This had nothing to do with desire, and everything to do with need. They moved at the same time, opening their blankets and Castiel came up under his arm, settling his arm behind his back. His arm swooped over Castiel's shoulder holding him tight, and he slid his other arm around his chest. At first his skin seemed colder than his own, but within moments the places their skin met seemed to warm. They spent a moment adjusting the blankets to prevent any draft and sat there shivering in each others arms.
A male voice came over the intercom. “Security Breach.”
"That isn't the only problem."
Sam grunted in grudging agreement. "Any luck with the sword?"
"Don't think about it Sancho," Dean slapped the back of the chair.
Dean took a step forward (well slightly to the left and forward so he could avoid Sam’s body), Meg took an involuntary step back. “Get him, you fools!” She cried. Meg’s minions surged forward like an angry mob. Cas not exactly sure what he was doing stepped forward holding out his hand.
“Thank God. Excuse me, sir. Do you know where they keep the—”
“I’m not exactly comfortable with the plan,” Dean continues as Chuck pushes open the window with one hand while adjusting his balaclava with the other.
“And you told him you love him too?” Jack asked, with that innocent curiosity of the three year old he really was.
"I don't know you sir, you have me mistaken for someone else."
Cas blushed. "I am not sure I am ever going to get used to that."
The jukebox was playing classic rock, currently on Kansas "Carry on". Sancho eyed the bar where a young blonde and an older brunette waited on the patrons.
"Apologies, sir" Dean muttered stepping aside to let him pass.
"I have my ways. Only one thing left I suppose," And he brought down the peddlers wagon wall, revealing a tall stand mirror. The light was now beginning to fade, but it was more than enough to see by.
Dean looked away, Cas could see a tear in his eye. Cas reached out to his stubble ridden face, pulling him back to him. Words were useless. He kissed him.
The girl not only glared at him in disdain but she simply turned on her heel and walked away. Where was Chuck when he needed him?
You changed me too Cas. You did. You taught me what I was fighting for and you never gave up on me, and did some stupid hurtful shit.
"You are normal Cas. Or...no one is. I mean. I think this is your normal," He said in a stumbling rush.
“After the race they ganged up on me, told Meg I had let you guys win. Faced with that lot Meg had no choice but to throw me to the dogs. Otherwise she would have been lynched herself.”
“Oh, I don’t know. Did you see him?”
Cas turned to his brother, "Dean saw his portrait in Mike's office, then he bolted. I caught up with him and he told me what happened to him and his family and that Lucifer..uncle Nick was at the heart of it."
Once the man was out of earshot, Dean cursed soundly, hurling the ball across the court and hitting the tin sided shed in a rousing clang.
“No, Bobby, until he wakes up I am staying right here. Me being gone is what got him into this mess. I won’t leave him again until he’s ready.”
Sam groaned "What did Bobby find now?" Dean just shrugged and told him to follow him. Sam followed him into the map room, his big brain already jumping on the new conundrum before Dean had actually laid out the entire scenario. Truly Dean couldn't be  an effective king without his brother by his side. He didn't want to be king without his brother at his side.
It was Zachariah and his gang.
Gunshots went off, and he felt something impact his side before everything went black.
Wishing this didn’t take so long Castiel removed as much make up as he could and Meg returned with a tan long button up coat and navy trousers. He quickly put them on ran out the stage door into the tavern, hoping and dreading at the same time that he might have missed his chance.
"If you don't like it, Bobby will drink it," He said and he twisted off the lid with a satisfying release of pressure. He plopped the beer in front of him and they began to load up their plates with Pizza.
"But why? You obviously don't love me."
“Running late. Be there in ten.”
"Family recipe," Dean replied automatically.
But in the morning it was business as usual. His father seemed none the wiser that she was the mysterious woman from the ball that the Prince had been with all evening. When he finally confronted Gadreel his brother didn't seem to know what she was talking about.
"I'm looking for someone," he said, hesitant. As if he was unsure why he was confiding anything.
“Cas, did you hear my prayers?”
"How would you know," Castiel asked thickly.
Dean stood over Sam’s bed while he slept, Bobby patting him on the shoulder.
Zach grinned. “I told you Dean, I own you. You cannot fight heaven. Do you understand that now?”
He blinked. Bright light blinded him, so he raised a hand to shade his eyes. He was laying on the side of a dirt road the sun beaming down
“Because you will go mad. You already have done. You are fool and a coward.”
"Hey, family don't end in blood," he lifted the bottle high, with the saying that had become almost their motto. "You two are really all I have left," he added under his breath
The audience, to his astonishment started clapping and whistling as he exited stage left.
“You know I'm a strict vegetarian," Cas said, staring at him.
"Did we win?"  He asked looking around in a daze.
“What?” That pulled him back to reality soon enough. Dean paused the game looking over at the computer where his email was pulled up on screen. Anna Milton was a little bold name at the top of the list of unread emails.
"Well, I can't be there every time you fall into a freezing river. Teach a man to fish..." He added the old proverb. Dean surprised him by laughing out loud, his whole body taken up in the exercise.
He leaned in and kissed him for the first time. It was like coming home.
"Look, I think I can sneak out tonight." His eyes darted to the door, as if he could see through it. "Dean seems like he might leave me alone tonight. I bet I can sneak out." He willed himself to believe his own words. He had to make it happen. He had to have more.
“Your left or my left?”
A pair of perfectly polished black boots stood in front of him and he looked up to find a short man in an outfit of navy blue. He had a neat beard, a sarcastic smirk and a twinkle in his eye.
The relief was instantaneous, and he moved to pull his arm out again.
“I have my own-”
"Yes, I want pie."
“Dean Winchester. You don’t get to decide how I react to things. Just give me a moment to process.” His blue eyes seemed to spark in the odd light of his headlights reflecting off the tin walls of the shop.
“Jimmy,” he provides pulling something from his pocket and placing it on the counter. “I came about this…”
The carriage was going so fast Castiel thought she might vomit. Or maybe that was just nerves.
“I do enjoy our time together,” Cas knew this wasn’t exactly the right thing to say, but he needed to hear what Dean was trying to say, before he let it go. Before he let himself go.
Dean clenched his fists and closed his eyes, his expression pure pain. "What if he can't Sam? What if the dragon..."
He put the slippers carefully back into the back and shut the lid then put back the floorboards, putting the loose nails back into place and heaving himself to his feet. He couldn't hide here all day. His brothers would come get him if it came to that. He still had chores to do, and he didn't trust his brothers to have brought in the eggs after their fight.
"You gonna have them shoot all of us Uncle?" Michael asked.
“But how do you know that?”
"Yeah, Singer's Auto and Salvage, Ask for Bobby."
“That I am sure of.”
“Ruby, what have you brought me?”  He said as he approached, seeming to appear out of nowhere, but Sam hadn’t really been paying attention to his surroundings.
"I don't-"
“Cas-” but Cas was already out of bed and pulling on his boxers from where they lay on the floor.
"I don't know. I'm not sure if he's crazy or saner than the rest of us."
Dean resisted the urge to crumple the papers in his hands and instead slid them back into the manila envelope. Bobby shot-gunned his beer and then they went out to the junkyard together.
Jimmy smiles at the man, understanding the lie was a deflection. He was just this side of off kilter and irreverent. So he tells him, “I like you, Dean Winchester.” Maybe more than was strictly allowed even. Unable to keep it in. The man actually blushed at him for that comment. Curious.
"I will never forget that face Cas. Why the hell do you still have his portrait on the wall."
Sam could see what was going to happen, and in the back of his head he wasn't exactly shocked. There has always been a tension between them that was palpable. Thinking about it he wasn't at all that Castiel's method of expression would be by carving the object of his affections face in five hundred different ways, nor Dean's being a more down to earth and subtle approach, his favorite thing in the world to his favorite being in the world.
"Your Highness, please," Dean saw her squeeze Jo's hand circumspectly, as they stood shoulder to shoulder before his throne. Once again he felt that he had completely lost control of his own kingdom, but he didn't really mind. No one ruled alone. "You have failed no one, least of all me. Matters of the heart are too complicated to trace, let alone lay at anyone’s feet for blame." She nodded kindly to Cas, who stood stoically next to Sam, looking like she might faint. "This doesn't mean we cannot have an alliance. I for one think it will be a stronger bond than a marriage of politics could ever have wrought. We have fought side by side and won. I only ask that if we should ever need aide you will come."
"I just wanted your counsel, not your presence on the mission."
“Uh, yeah, actually. I’m not sure I’m able to receive calls because,” he looked down, his eyelashes fluttering, “I never got one from you,” he says without skipping a beat. Dean felt his heart flutter in his chest, and a little strangled laugh escaped his lips unbidden. For some reason he can’t think of a single thing to say to this.
"I-" Cas couldn't figure out what to say. He didn't sleep, so he watched the man. What else was he going to do?
Anna raised an eyebrow at him. "You sure?"
"You dance beautifully."
It took an hour, and five men with picks to chisel away at the boulder. But finally they had half the rock in rubble on the floor. Charlie looked like she was going to be sick as she watched the desecration of her holy weapon. The sword still stood at the same angle in the boulder, despite most of the boulder being detached, The blacksmith waved his apprentices aside and went into aim a blow to the side of where the blade must lie to he could dislodge it.
Dean frowned at his best friend and then decided, what the hell, and rushed forward.
Jimmy ignores the MOL agent. “Which way, Dean?”
"Cas, I need to think about this for a-" he choked a little, tears leaking down his cheeks finally. "Can you-"
"Fair?" Bobby looked at him with an expression that was half amusement have incredulous. "Boy, none of this has been fair. I'm trying to balance the scales a bit. I told you before, family don't end in blood. You are welcome here as long as you need. Why don't you put that away for now and come take apart this damned range rover. Some manual labor will help."
Apparently his uncle had been arrested a few years ago and had been going by the name Lucifer at the time. He had been caught in suspicious circumstances that had led to a young man's death, and when they had investigated further it seemed he had been setting up a cult. There was something to do with a drug ring run by these cultists and Nick, Lucifer, had been at the center of it all.
"Sancho?  Like Sancho Panza?" Bobby Singer asked him eyeing him up and down. "You look more like Constantine."
"Brother?" Came a new voice. They all turned to find a small man, hair a mess of brown curls, edged with gray around the temples.
“Oh, yeah? What’s she doing now?” Another soul lost to the angelic Anna Milton.
“Will you and Cas finally get to be… my dad’s?”
One thing at a time. Shelter and blankets first.
“Captain Awesome!” One of her friends crowed loudly, fist in the air as she passes by. Sam grins at his girlfriends nickname. She really was awesome.
"Nothing, it doesn't matter."
“We get him first,” Jimmy states calmly. Completely non-plussed by the gun pointed at him. “If you try and take him I will kill him.”
They all walked out of the darkness forming a circle. “Castiel?”
Sam and Dean exchanged a long look.
Dean looked over at Cas and once again their eyes met. Time seemed to stop, and then he heard Sam clear his throat. Dean tore his eyes from the lad to find his brother staring down at him from an enormous height. His brothers growth spurt while he was away was going to take time to get used to. Sam had changed his clothes, but his hair looked damp and he had a worried puppy dog look on his face.
Castiel swallowed back some bile and nodded. Shrinking a little under the intense scrutiny.
"I tell you, I have two sons."
"Can we go somewhere where I'm not staring at us?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, nothing for it then," and he climbed up on the boulder and gripping the handle tight pulled with all his strength.
Another choking cough, but this time the man curled forward to cough more water out. "I"-cough-"can try-"
"Well, when I rejected him as a suitor he decided to join the crusades. He's halfway across Europe by now."
"I see. We'll have to remedy that." And he followed this with action, turning on the ancient looking tv with an equally ancient looking remote.
"There's root beer in the fridge." Dean told him, not turning around.
Dean looked down at his hands, they shook slightly so he clutched the bottle tighter, "Still."
Something about the way he said it made Cas wonder if he could read his deepest secrets. He doubted it, but he wanted to believe, "I don't have any money." He wasn't so good at believing anymore.
“Will do.”  And Bobby sauntered out of the room, passing Castiel in the doorway.
“No.” He lies.
"Why do we always end up freezing under blankets when we're together?" Dean asked after they shifted into a more comfortable position, Cas's arms around his middle and hands clasped in Cas's lap.
“Bobby? As in Bobby Singer? I thought he was in heaven jail.”
“He said something about wanting to join us, so, who knows.” Cas nodded before leaning in and pecking Dean on the lips which he returned full heartedly.
“How do you know I go by Bobby.” He asked slowly, mouth moving as if in slow motion.
Last he’d heard Rowena prevented demons from coming up here but he must have been wrong. Rogue demons, great. Next to him, she wrinkled her nose and glanced between him and the body.
“Well I don’t mind not getting my hand chopped off, thanks.” Sighing, Cas walked away as Sam called out to them. Turning, he found his brother standing a few feet away staring down at the timer with furrowed brows.
“Miracle! You’re comin’ with us bud.” He could hear Sam scoffing behind him and chose to ignore it in favor of patting the golden fur on the dogs head. The ride back was odd, silence filling every crack in the car and Miracle sound asleep on his lap. Things didn’t much change upon them getting back, just a beer or two in celebration then back the their lives as always.
“Still, this? This just sucks.” Sam scoffed at him and opened the trunk of the car to reveal their weapons stash. Smiling, he pulled out the throwing stars. He’d always wanted to use them, maybe this time could be diff-
“You remember everything that’s happened?” Dean nodded, scooting forwards further from the back of the couch and closer to Cas.
“Thanks, learned it from you.” Smirking he looked around them and confirmed no one else was around. “Okay, what’s going on Bobby? You’re not planning on taking me outback and shooting me are ya?”
“Jack..broke him out, I don’t know.”
“He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a pedler just opening his pack. His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath; he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread,” he grinned at the book reading the last line. It was true, he didn’t need a book to tell him that though.
“I’ve got nothing, you?” He didn’t catch a word Sam said, staring down at his laptop with a slightly open mouth.
Shutting his mouth with a click, Dean straightened up to stare down at the other man. He didn’t know who this guy was or how he managed to get Dean there without actually waking him up, but he knew it couldn’t be good.
“Don’t be.” He shook his head, the ghost of a smile lighting his face. “I finally know that I’m not.. some... psychopath who killed a man because of a hallucination.”
“Rugaru”
“No, never, I would never say that. Not to you. I’m just suggesting these hallucinations seem to be getting worse.” Scoffing, Dean looked away at the wall to his left. Some terrible rendering of a monkey swung on a vine through some vague shapes that looked like a jungle but Dean wasn’t quite sure.
“Just read it.” He still looked skeptical but let his eyes fall to the screen.
“We should get you two out of here, before anyone notices you.” Dean nodded albeit a bit numbly and they followed his lead while Cas lead them out, back into his car and far away.
“Well, lets not forget about the guy floating around inside!”
“Yeah, Bobby. Bobby singer. Robert Singer?” Cas’s eyes widened as he stood slowly, removing the glasses from his face as he went.
“Uh, yeah. Um,” he swiped a hand across his mouth and spun the laptop around to show his brother.
“Go, now,” upon Dean hesitating once more, Cas shoved him backwards. “Please.” Not so much as nodding, Dean turned away and, with one final glance behind him, he gracefully parkoured his way up the wall and out the small window into the outside world.
“Doesn’t matter man, I’m just so happy to have you back.” His grin wasn’t moving anytime soon and he was fine with it.
“Dean.” With a pointed look, Cas leaned forwards and gestured for Dean to talk. Sighing, he shook his head.
“It’s like, the third of February.”
“It was all real...” he didn’t explain what he was talking about, he didn’t need to, they both knew. Nodding, Cas resisted the urge to wince and let Dean push his legs over the edge and sit facing him.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to say. The guy who killed them’s dead.” Silence on the other end.
“Jeez Bobby, you make it sound like I was thrown in jail. It was a, uh, a rugaru right?” Bobby nodded but did little to hide the confusion crowding his features. In that moment Dean understood this really wasn’t his Bobby, never would his Bobby Singer have allowed so much emotion to shine through, especially when it was an emotion that would make him look weaker than he was.
With that thought, he set off into the halls and with a few quick usages of his skill sets, he was wandering around completely free to do as he pleased. No one was supposed to be up yet so he didn’t run into anyone until after he managed to gain a toothbrush and Bobby walked into the hall up ahead of him, they both froze on sight of one another, Bobby with a cup if something in his hand and Dean clutching his new toothbrush with a ferocity probably unnecessary.
“You don’t remember? Dean, You tried to take out another patient with a torch claiming they were a Rue-gay-gue.”
“No time, Bobby said they are sending me to some place called Lakeland?”
“Well, we got a call about the neighbors hearing screaming coming from inside and when two of my officers showed up, they found the father dead and drained of blood, the mother unconscious with her tongue ripped out and their two boys gone.”
“Like Balthazar?” Humming, Dean nodded and shit his eyes before throwing his head down into his hands. “But that doesn’t make any sense. We weren’t doing anything and they would have to send us through something to even get us here.” Sighing into his hands, Dean rubbed at his face before freezing and slowly raising his head. Sam took notice of this and dropped the papers he was looking through to give Dean a puppy look. “What?”
“You mean, am I seeing any hell hounds?” His smirk was wiped away with a flat glare as she sat down across from him.
Dean stared absentmindedly out the window, taking in nothing besides the general green of the trees. Nothing more than the blur of these past few days. He may not see the world but he thought about it. He wonders if they were gone for longer than a second back home. If his Cas looked for them. Whether or not he bothered to be worried, it wasn’t like Dean was the kind of person you cared about. If anything, he wouldn’t blame Castiel if he just chose to ignore Dean’s disappearance. Through it all, Cas in every realm helped him. Back home, he would be dead ten times over, here, this him would have long since faded away if not for the man stealing worried glances at him besides Dean. The car stopped and the next thing Dean knew, he had opened his door along with Sam and the trio stood outside the car.
And with that he opened the door to a dark room with a single king bed.
Dean wanted to type more but forced himself to wait for the response.
He was halfway up the block before he caught up. "Wait!"
"Please, sir, we were told to let no house go unchecked."
For a long moment they stood in the silty bank, warm river water slowly past them, the sun beating down on bare shoulders.
Michael sighed again. “And why should I?”
Sam stood up, backing away from whatever might happen.
She nodded and winked at him.
“Five minutes? Do you know what five minutes means in Buy More dollars?” He continued in his clipped tones, the effect was a little comical since he stood head and shoulders shorter than Dean.
"Gabriel can't even be serious for one second." Dean heard him grumble to himself as he marched back into the room. "Two men went to the house asking about you. They were searching the river bank. One of them was all wet and is taking a hot shower to recover from the cold." Dean felt something loosen in his chest, and his eyes started to water. He hadn't realized how worried he'd been. "My brothers will be here shortly. I suggest we sit by the fire till Micheal gets here."
"Dean?"
He then braced himself to have to push himself in the water. A cold knot was forming in the pit of his stomach at the thought, but he tried to relax. He trusted Cas. He would be fine.
He looked back over his shoulder at the office.  The cute man had his head down, obviously back into whatever show Cas had interrupted him from earlier.
“Okay. It’s done. I want you in the air in an hour,” Uriel orders calmly.
He held up his hands and the rooms erupted in applause and cheers as Charlie was escorted down the long red carpet, Princess Joanna at her side, both already dressed in travel clothes and ready to leave. Dean immediately turned to find Cas, who was still looking bewildered. She was dressed in a simple gown of navy blue, her hair skillfully coiffed, no doubt by his sister. She was still adjusting to the expensive gowns and life in court. "My lady."
Cas raised his arms above his head, bent his knees and dove with barely splash into the river, popping up twenty feet away like an otter.
"Trust me, you don't want that fellow, he's been to the south seas and is positively miasmic with syphilis."
"Did you bring the first-aid kit?" Chimes in Cas, suddenly inches from him again. "Dean gashed his shoulder on a log."
“No less fair than being psychic, this way you won’t anticipate our moves.” Claire countered, Kaia was just laughing quietly at the antics.
Bobby nodded. "Be careful, you idjit." He clapped the King on his back and rode back the waiting soldiers to give out orders. Dean motioned for Charlie and Sam dismount, as he unwrapped the dragonslayer.
“I don’t know. Like there was a Vampire at the Large Mart today. And last week someone in the MOL intercepted blueprints of a hotel. Oh and the WOH found a vial of vampire blood and schematics for a bomb.”
Dean sat his ass down on the hood of the car and stared down at his empty hands. Hearing the exact words of the agreement a fresh blow. Wishing he had held on to him tighter. “He- he-“ he couldn’t look at either of them. “He told me he loved me.”  There he said it out loud.
He also put in his application for Assistant Manager. After all, what was scary about a promotion when he had just been in a high speed chase and diffused a bomb.
“You know, turns out I had it all along in my trunk. Isn’t that strange?”
Castiel could remember being in this house only once in his childhood. He had been playing with his older brothers and they had accidentally thrown a baseball onto Crowley's roof and he had gone to fetch it. Or he was the one his brother had tricked into going. Old man Crowley was British and had made him stay for a cup of tea and a crumpet(which had turned out to be an english muffin). And for some reason had kept asking him where he wanted to be in ten years. It had all seemed vaguely sinister to Castiel.
"Bobby, I love you like an uncle, but if you ever say anything like that about John again, I will-" The last time Sam had heard that tone in Dean's voice he had shot a man in the head. It sent a shiver up his spine and he sat down on the stair clutching the railing as memories seemed to flash before his eyes.
Dean huffed out a laugh, glad for the change of subject and suddenly craving the comfort of soft serve and plastic-y fudge.
Sam felt like his head was going to split open if he didn’t get his fix soon, so he followed her to the parked car in the abandoned parking lot by the water.
"Hello, Castiel," she said to the mirror, curtsying her voice low and gravelly. "Hello, Dean," she said back, lightening her voice to a more feminine tone. She shook her head at her own foolishness. Who knew if he would even be at the ball. But she had told him she would be there. If she didn't show up...
Jimmy halted, his mind visibly working. Then he shrugs, “Why not?” He hurries them into the lift, pressing the key for the top floor.
Castiel gaped at him. "It's missing a couple pearls, but I did my best." He then handed her another bundle, tied up in brown paper with his mothers gold thread slippers, also mended, on top. "I also fixed your dress, and threw in and old one I was going to donate to the poor."
"Are you Sammy?" Sancho asked, sure that he was right.
“So people have said,” cocky and irreverent. What was this guy doing working at a chain electronics store? He seemed so much…more… than the life we was choosing to live.
There was really no denying it. Every fiber of him was lighter, being in his presence. And this. This gesture spoke volumes. The man cared about him. He could only think of a handful of people who had ever cared. Not only did he care, but he observed, listened. Knew him so well that this was his attempt at helping. This perfect attempt at helping was a slice of apple pie, ice cream, and an irish coffee.
“Get out of here!” Cas told them, Dean just sat there smiling at him. He gave his brother a wink as he turned away. It was good to have him back again.
Dean scowled at his brother. "Can you get your head out of your trousers and help me figure our brand new problems. As if dragons weren't enough."
“What happened?”
Sancho shrugged. Singer shook it off and moved on, throwing his flashlight and wrench into a basin set out on the floor.
"Can you please explain this ritual to me?" Cas asked after a minute of silence, where in the only sound was the large metal spoon Sam was wielding to scrape the inside of the pumpkin hollowly.
He timed it just right, his lips crashing into the Winchester’s just as his head lifted. Cas felt his lips meets his and the man didn't pull back, he pushed back with equal weight so that their kiss was a perfect meeting of lips. Castiel remembered what he had learned from the movies and from kissing Meg, parting his lips over the other mans. Dean groaned out low in his throat, almost a purr of pleasure and the man's hands tightened on his now open shirt, pulling him so that their bellies met in the middle. Cas, not knowing what else to do with his hands reached up and held onto Dean's elbows. His mind losing all thought as Dean sucked his bottom lip into his mouth, the tip of his tongue brushing across it causing him to shudder.
"Another."
Dean rolled his eyes, mostly at himself for not realizing his mistake before.
The noise in the tavern was loud, and raucous. Men in women’s clothes and women in men’s clothes and people who he wasn't exactly sure which side of the spectrum they were on milled freely. Most of the crowd was gathered at the bar, trying to get the several barmen and barmaids for attention as they poured ale after ale from three large barrels from large tappers behind the bar.
Cas watched helplessly, seeing something break inside of Dean. Sam, or whatever it was he called himself stood using all of his height advantage to intimidate.
“Good Point!” Chimes in Gabriel, popping a gummy bear in his mouth. Dean was certain he had stolen the candy from the display by the registers, but he wasn’t in the mood to fight him about it today. The man could argue logic to a tree, and his headache made him no match for the man today.
Someone cleared his throat behind him, he turned to find the bearded figure of Bobby behind him looking stern.
Sam stepped in and swept Charlie off her feet and into his arms. He exchanged a look with Dean telling him that he would take care of the princess. Charlie let Sam hold her, clutching her bleeding arm, tears still running down her bloodless cheeks.
He caught movement in the corner of his eye and saw Jimmy marching into the store purposefully. Spotting Dean he marched toward him wearing a tan trench coat and the same blue tie as the first day he met him. For some reason the combination triggers something and he gets a flash.
After a frustrating minute trying to find an unlocked door, he stormed into the warehouse. The opening and subsequent slamming of the old metal door echoed loudly as he stalked into the large open room of the abandoned warehouse space. He barely noticed Castiel at his heels.
"Some other what?" Dean asked,his brow furrowing.
"Well that was fun," Gabriel said scrubbing his hands together.
Before Dean could ask the more pressing question of who the man was he was clicking his teeth and the mare was starting forward. The man snaked his arms around him to steady himself, grabbing locks of her mane guiding her towards the horns sounding in the distance. Without warning he kicked the horse into a gallop back into the woods.
“Michael, we need to talk.”
Gabe rolled his eyes and Sam shook his head. “Dad says dinner is almost ready.”
"Did you really think it would be that easy Crowley?" Dean asked, coming into view and taking the sword from Castiel. "I've told you before that your kind isn't welcome here."
Sancho raised a quizzical eyebrow. "Good morning, Master."
"No one ever...yeah he's my brother."
Dean watched him with eager eyes, then took off his own.
“Didn’t you hang that shelf?” He asked Chuck, who is trembling against the wall, his pale features even more ashen than usual.
"Honestly, I think five hundred portraits of myself in pumpkins sort of gave that away."
"It's just-" but Castiel had other ideas and was kissing him again, pressing him back against the map table with more force. Dean, unsure why, let him haul him up on the table, knocking a row of pumpkins out of the way with comical bouncy noises and lots of guttering of candles. Dean couldn't be bothered to watch the spectacle though as he had the handsome object of his affection standing between his legs, staring up at him with his intense blue gaze, his hands resting on his hip bones. Dean could feel himself stirring against the angel's belly and leaned down to kiss his soft lips once more, the points of a hundred candles dancing in his peripheral vision.
“Dean! Did you see the-” Sam sounded frantic, hopeful.
Jack gets a feeling.
Ellen looked heavenward and then spat out “Why the long faces, boys?”
“Come back for more?” Cas asked.
"You're as cold as I am, you need circulation," the man scolded, but he stopped his movements, sitting down beside him with an audible thud.
Bobby glared at him as he passed Sam hiding behind the wall next to the staircase. "Both of you." He muttered as he climbed the stairs with heavy feet. Sam peeked around the corner. Dean was sitting with his back to him at the kitchen table.
Dean blushed at the thought of his botched boar hunt. The blushing that had nothing to do with thoughts of his mysterious stranger, thank you very much.
“You have somewhere to stay, sweetie?” Ruby asked coming to sit next to him. Her long black hair shining in the lamplight.
She choke laughed into his vest.
The man looked up at his third return, looking confused.
"Has he tried to get it out again?"
Dean held on to the leash even tighter. "Yes. Prison. It was a bit of a life changer. As was losing my father and almost seeing my brother killed." That took the smug look off of her face. "I only need two classes to graduate. It would make a big difference in the type of jobs I can apply for to take care of my brother. Sam is a great student and an asset to this school, so you can understand my want to be able to take care of him the best I can."
"Well, don't go giving him too much credit. He's also obsessed with Tori Spelling," Dean said, chuckling.
“Trust me, Dean. Just take the Toyota.”
He glanced over at Sancho licking his lips uncertainly, eyeing him up and down for good measure.
"Wel-welcome to Winchester," Joanna said, stumbling over her words slightly.
"You would have to consult with his teachers." Naomi said, spreading her hands with a smile that didn't really reach her eyes.
Dean lowered his knife and stared at it. Sam was staring at it too. All around them lay the bodies of the demons. Smited.
Dean couldn’t help but have flashbacks to years before when Cas had fallen to earth and had come to the bunker having traveled across the country to get to him. How he had been so comfortable in human form until Dean had had to kick him out. How devastated he had been. What an absolute dick he had been to his best friend.
“It really was eight layers?”
"Haven't you been to a show? It's pretty simple."
Three more people tried to much the same luck, Charlie explained in more detail that they had tried every warrior in the clan to pull the blade and no one had been successful.
Three hundred feet was easier than three miles.
“Does everyone in this family have to be a damned hero?” Dean asked.
"I was making you the perfect pie..."
Bobby set his pen in it’s holder and looked at him squarely "I still don't see how you marrying some girl is supposed to save us from a damned dragon infestation."
Dean relaxed, he was just on edge. "I know. Sorry. You alright?" he stuffed the report card into his folder of papers he hadn't gotten around to showing Naomi.
“No, our job today is to warn people of the virus and tell them to keep an eye on Norton anti-virus for the new update coming soon for just that problem. Let’s all take a moment to thank Chuck for alerting us to the problem.” The whole group looks over at the short bearded pariah.
“I don’t want to alarm anyone. But I have news,” carefully setting down his backpack as Sam looked up in alarm, Jess opened on eye to look at him. “I have a date!” he says spreading his arms.
“So we’re free?”  Eileen finally asked? Looking between Sam and Dean.
“No, let me get this out, man. It's not how angels were built, I thought.. How could a creature of pure cosmic intent love someone, you know? But over the years you proved again and again that you loved me. I just ignored it. Chalked it up to you feeling duty bound to me or Sam or a mission to save the earth. You proved to me over and over you cared for me, even beating the hell out of me when I was doing something monumentally stupid. I realized after… the Empty took you, how much I never told you. How often I told you we needed you, when what  I meant was…I wanted you.”
"Michael...he was one of the first to be adopted. He still resents that Father adopted me as well, even if it was ten years later. He wants...wanted to be special."
“Even with their aid there is no guarantee that we can kill this creature.” Bobby said, pushing himself up to a standing position.
"They are on their way, Sam was in the shower, and the older fellow insisted on going back down to the River to look for you. Raph went down to fetch him." Gabriel asked, looking over Cas's shoulder as if he wasn't there. "They should all be here in a minute."
The town wasn't close to the old manor, he had to take the horse and carriage in to get the shopping done, usually. Today he decided to just take the horse and load up the panniers with the necessities. That way he could use the cool forest trails instead of the open roadways and reduce his risk of meeting his brothers along the way. They had left hours earlier on who knew what errand and he wanted no part in thief schemes as it usually just spelled trouble for him. Heaven knew he was the one who always seemed to get into hot water when they were in involved.
"Oh, uh," Dean grunted, still agitated about the whole affair. "Yeah, counselor screwed me over and wouldn't let me finish up the year there. Bobby got me some book on how to take the GED, but... it's a headache to slog through so I haven't done much with it."
When he comes to from the strange little fit, he is leaning against the tiled wall breathing heavily. Dean shakes his head, changing the station to something not giving him acid flashbacks. He hurried through the rest of his shower routine
“So…?? What did he say?”
Castiel chuckled with him then. "Castiel," he told him wryly, knowing the name will throw the man. It always did.
"The Lemon Tree. It was hard to see in the dark, but it had a breakfast menu posted by the door."
Cas just looked at him, still completely bewildered by the sudden turn of events. "How did you...?"
Dean thought about this, then he thought about the hip pressed against his and the arm around his waist, the hand in his and the kiss Cas was placing on his cheek.
The man chuckled. "I like you two knuckle heads."
The pool wasn't exactly the kind of place that Dean hung out. He had occasionally walked into a YMCA when things were desperate with him and Sammy, but those times it had simply been to use the showers. This place was immense, the Olympic sized pool was used for competitions and even had arena seating on one side. He stood by the door, bright lights, echoing sounds and the permeating haze of chlorine making him feel conspicuous in his leather jacket and jeans, while boys in Speedos and people in jogging suits ran in inexplicable directions around him.
"Well, it's time to think outside the box. Bobby, have the blacksmith come with some strong backed men and picks. If the sword won't come out of the stone, than we removed the stone from the sword.
Sam continued, Dean not able to find his voice to object. "I'll go get things ready. Leave at dawn, brother?"
"Here," Dean slung the bottle of amber at Sam, his breath making fog in the chill air. Sam caught it with ease, looking down at the beer with apparent skepticism. He glanced to Bobby to make sure that it was alright.
Dean listened in rapt silence as they walked slowly past the portraits of his brothers. Dean stopped when they got to Castiel's. He must have been about ten when the portrait was done, an awkward chubby cherub like thing, with the same piercing blue eyes and unruly black hair.
"I don't like this," Don Quixote grumbled.
Gabe choked out a laugh. “You two sure know how to party.”
Castiel looked away from her up into the light, "You are asking me to go against my family."
“Empty and Billie fought for a couple days, but we finally were able to pull them apart long enough to talk the empty into a deal. Now that we were all awake, none of us were going to stay quiet. We agreed to leave the empty so it could go back to sleep and all promised the next time we die we will go straight to sleep when we return.”
"So we'll be back on the road by the weekend?" Sancho asked that morning looking out the window on the bustling cafe courtyard below.
"It's him! It's my Sammy!" Don Quixote was babbling from the floor where he had deposited him.
“So this ex, this girl…guy?”
"Thank you for seeing me today," Dean said nervously when she sat there, hands clasped, not saying anything.
Grace was eager to see him when he got to the stables. It took him a few tries to get onto her back in skirts, but he managed to get atop her and halfway out of the stables just as his brother entered. Kicking Grace forward he cantered past them, thinking the only reason he got away without them pulling him off was the fact that they were still stunned he was in a dress. They called after him with vulgar insults but soon enough he couldn't hear their whining voices. He was free.
Dean nodded and winced as he pulled the blanket back over his shoulders. Cas huddled back down under his as well and the silence stretched between them.
"Look CinderAss, give it a rest. You didn't get to go to the ball. It doesn't matter anyway, the King met a woman and you are no match for that one. I saw her as she was leaving, even Bartholomew was impressed."
"Uh, slipped my mind," Dean said looking at his shoes, not at the man.
It was dark, but somewhere a soft orange glow emanated giving just enough light to see the outlines of rock. The cave went up a ways and then around a corner, once around the corner the light was more visible flickering against the wall as it sloped downward. They crept along slowly, stopping at any sound as they descended till they came to a large cavern with two wall mounted torches.
"She's probably with Princess Charlie, no doubt they've wandered off by now."
"There's a lot of religious texts up there," Cas said, moving around the squat coffee table to sit on the other side of the man as he arranged his pizza.
“I’ll believe you when you stop trying to lie to yourself.”
I just realized— maybe it’s because you never thought about me in the first place.
“Cas?”
“D—Dean?”
Who am I, you say. Who knows. Maybe I'm a god, maybe I'm no one. Perhaps a brokenhearted person, because you know what they say: everyone is a poet when they're sad; and let me tell you, my friend, their love is the saddest story and the most beautiful poem I've ever heard.)
“I— Great. Everything’s great. Yeah. Awesome.”
“Dean?”
"This isn't up for discussion."
“Are you ever coming back?”
I turn to my right, only to see the ghost of your sleepy smile vanish into thin air before I can memorize it.
Unfortunately, that's not possible.
“You’re the best brother anyone could ask for.”
“Well, it’s going to be a little difficult for you to follow me, with a broken leg and all that.”
and I’m not right beside you—, and suddenly, that forgotten bottle of whisky is calling me again.
I hadn’t seen so much light since the last time you smiled at me, all dimples and cheeky smiles and
It's a pity that a hero so great got a death so silent.
Which, if he's not wrong, won't be too far away from the truth.
“Hey, is everything okay?”
“Hmm-hmm. So, any special reason why you called?”
“What, like his phone?”
Dean takes a deep breath. Once. Twice. Then he loses count.
“Please, forgive me, Dean Winchester. I’m so sorry.”
“I am sorry.”
“I’m not heartbroken.”
I woke up this morning with that lovely shade of green of your eyes burned into my mind —almost as if you were here—, only to fall into an endless abyss when I realized you were but an illusion of my tired, exhausted mind.
“Dammit, Cas. I still don’t understand how you manage to mess with my head like this, even when you’re not here.”
You spoke soft words of appreciation towards me, as if I was something precious to be cherished and not a messed up guy, broken beyond repair.
(But in all truth, I still love you.)
I remember the day you left, even though five entire months have passed. You just came home, your hands still a little greasy from work, your shirt completely dirty (and your eyes absolutely empty.)
"This is the only way. Believe me when I say I'm sorry."
He closes Baby's truck violently, ending the loud thoughts of his exhausted mind. He's just tired. That's probably it. He has spent the last three days drinking coffee and driving while Sam naps in the backseat.
But this isn't tragic, you may say. Sure, it's sad for us, because we know what happened, but they don't, so that means they won't suffer. Will they?
(And I know that somewhere deep inside, you love me too.)
It's like trying to remember something he never knew; like spending his whole life underwater only to find out he's unable to breathe when he reaches the surface.
You know, I write all my thoughts about you, even those I don’t really like or those I’m a bit embarrassed about, and keep them in a box under my bed.
“Look, if you don’t want to believe me—”
Their eyes are pure steel- cold, sharp and unforgiving; cutting through his ribs and crushing his heart in its gelid embrace.
A car as black as the night that surrounds it cuts through the chilly air. Inside, a restless man searches peace.
“Should we call him?”
“Uh, yeah, he’s doing… something in the kitchen. Don’t know.”
“For being an awful brother and acting like a lovesick teenager girl.”
From time to time, I ponder sending them to you. Nothing fancy, just an envelop that reads
(False. I only hate the fact that you left me.)
“Cas, if you can hear me, please send a sign.”
Whatever this is, you can beat it. You've been hunting with Sammy for- what? Eleven years? And you have yet to face a menace you can't destroy.
“Dean. He’s an angel. He’ll be okay.”
Something burns inside my chest, and I don’t know if it’s my love of you or that I had too many drinks. Either way, it isn’t a pleasant feeling.
And that's it, really.
Dean didn't see their face. He isnâ€™t even sure if they were a man or a woman. He didnâ€™t know either why he could feel an old sense of familiarity settle low in his stomach at the sight of the unknown figure.
"You can't make me."
It's a lie, of course. But they don't know that.
“Cas? Is everything okay?”
(At least, something inside his very own soul screams so.)
“There’s no reason why he shouldn’t be. However, he is severely injured. It would be best if we just let him rest.”
“Sammy, are you using your computer?”
”Sammy? What’s wrong? Are you hurt? Please tell me you aren’t hurt.”
And I still try to find you in the lips of all the strangers that remind me of you.
“’S okay, Doc.”
I saw the world in black and white, my days boring and grey and awfully monotonous, before you came along. Because the second I laid my eyes on you, and explosion of blue initiated me to a world full of colour (and you still wonder why I love you.)
An abrupt turn to the left. Blinding brightness. Sam grunts from behind his back.
“Hmm?”
(Or maybe he's just tired.)
“No.”
“What the hell are you talking about?”
"I am no longer part of their lives. Now it's your time to keep your end of the bargain. Leave them out of this. Don't harm them in any way."
“’S all that fucking angel’s fault.”
“I know.”
But the thing is, I want you to drive them with me.
(A prayer of don’tleavemedon’tleavemedon’tleaveme is the only thing that goes through my mind, over and over again.)
at your brother’s doorstep. I’m sure he’ll give it to you.
And just like that, I was lost. Stumbling across life, trying to find a purpose that you took into that old backpack when you left.
“Both, I guess.”
“What do you suggest, then?”
Do you hear my screams when, late at night, I wake up from a nightmare?
What did you do in order to forget me? A brain surgery? Sacrificing your soul to the devil? I would do any of those just to stop thinking about those lips I can’t kiss anymore. What did you do to forget me?
“Fuck off.”
I never do— though I’m usually a couple of shots away from calling you in the middle of my vodka-induced delirious state.
“Any luck?”
“Yes, Dean?”
"I'm glad you finally made the right choice, Castiel."
“Hey, Cas?”
"Heaven has decided to punish me for my crimes. It wants both of you gone, of course. But," His heart is hammering against his ribs as he licks his lips, his throat dry like the Sahara desert. "They have sworn to let both you and I live if I just erase myself from your memories."
“Perhaps he’s in danger. I don’t even know. It’s been so long I’m starting to lose my mind.”
“Dean, I know you’re in there.”
“Good.”
(But he fell and crashed ages ago, and he's not completely fixed it yet.)
“I wish I knew.”
“You are a fucking dick, man. Sammy was in danger and you didn’t help him? That’s low, even for an asshole like you. I would have honestly expected if I was the one in danger. But Sam? Jesus, what has the kid ever done to you? He loves you and you are like a brother to him. You don’t want to help him? Fine. You can rot in hell for all I care. Just don’t come back again.”
I was stupid enough to think that yes, perhaps I had a chance at happiness after all, that you chose to stay with me (even when the whole world kneeled before you and begged for just a little bit of your attention) because you genuinely liked me, because you actually cared.
But you still left me.
"We could get out of this together, as a team. As a family."
“Dean? Wow, it’s been so long. How’re you doing?”
“Hey, Sammy.”
I made a mix tape just for us, ‘cause you got me stuck in the summer of ’92, and sometimes I still only see in grey (I wonder if you feel it too.)
And the figure is gone without a trace (perhaps it's a metaphor for his life).
“Even the voicemail is gone. It’s almost as if…”
The sun drowns me in its warmth, gentle sunrays caressing my skin, and I can’t avoid thinking about you (what have you done to me?), and that stupid smile of yours reminds me of the song “Can’t help falling in love”, because damn me to hell if those lips don’t make my stomach turn into a million butterflies that fly between my ribs.
“I want out.”
“Hell to the fucking no.”
It hurts. Maybe he shouldn't continue with this. But it's not like his decision will change anything in the grand scheme of things.
My mother once told me “someday, somewhere, someone will be waiting for you, and it’ll be the most beautiful thing you’ll ever see”; but she never mentioned that I would be the one left waiting while you wander off to what seems to be your death.
Why it felt so final, he doesn't know. He's faced many things worse than that. Hell, he's fought entire armies of demons without so much as blinking. Then why,
You didn’t need more than a suitcase and an old backpack to gather all your things and walk out of my life, pretending you never entered it in the first place. (But you did, and nothing was the same.)
Perhaps an old client? Someone they knew from one of their cases that had somehow been able to stumble upon them a second time.
And that my dear, is the saddest thing that can happen to two souls in love.
“It’s worth a shot.”
“Dammit, Cas.”
I met you on a summer night, stars on the sky and in your eyes; and I felt the oxygen being punched out of my lungs. You were so beautiful that it hurt to look at you, knowing that someone of your kind would never associate with someone like me.
There it is again. The insane glint in the eyes of a desperate man, the most primal instinct, survival, making its appearance as the dying man (who will save himself with just enough willpower) fights against the vast ocean and its herculean rage.
He knew (knows) that person. That he is sure of.
(But it’s no use— you don’t want to be found.)
It’s been two weeks since you walked away, and my nights are still made of tears and cheap alcohol. How do I get you out of my mind? Tell me, do you know how?
“Sammy, you are not going alone.”
His knuckles whiten as his fingers tighten their grip on the steering wheel, refusing to stop looking at the road even if he hasn't started the car yet. Just a few hours of sleep, that's all he needs.
I hate you.
Something heavy (perhaps regret) settles in his stomach as the two men in front of him lower their heads and sigh in defeat; and his heart shatters upon the sight of the most stubborn warriors in this universe giving up.
You were the first person that made me feel wanted, that made me feel love, that made me believe I was important. I gave everything to you without a second thought, I held you during hard times, I kissed you until you forgot your own name.
“Calling Cas’ phone.”
Everything is okay. He'll be better in the morning, and once he's rested and relaxed his brain won't do stupid shit like this.
“Wait, I guess.”
Sorry does not even begin to cover the regret that runs through his veins, clawing at his bones and make everything go black and white.
Crystal wings are attached to your back and I drown in invisible feathers whenever you hug me tight —because I love it when you hold me close—. You are worthy of adoration, you should be an object of psalms, and words should be created to speak of your greatness (although I may be a little biased).
(Just like watching you walk out of my life, unable to do anything, wasn’t pleasant either.)
“It would be my pleasure.”
“Cas?”
The blade had narrowly missed the left side of his neck, its quiet buzzing sound had cut through the air, singing a deathly hymn to all those not quite ready to leave this world yet.
And I used to think —years ago, before it all started to go down— that maybe we would meet again, later, when years have gone and past, when we have left it all behind; when instead of being made of solitude and despair, we would be full of distant memories and stories ready to be told.
The room is silent, in an absolute way that makes their breaths sound like thunderstorms in the middle of a cold winter night.
But that was good, right? Anyone able to move on after a terrifying experience with the supernatural was always great. Wasn't it?
But it's not, because it means the other man will put up a fight, only hurting the two of them even more in the process.
“This is a dream, isn’t it?”
"It's for your own good."
That came out of nowhere, much like the figure from before, and that thought alone is enough to make him shake in pure terror. Something big is happening (again) and all his instincts scream at him to get out of there while he still can, to run to safety, to never look back.
“Maybe. Any news about… you know?”
They said love is beautiful. But they forgot to say that, like most beautiful things, it breaks you inside.
"I'm sorry, Sam. You've been a good friend to me, and I feel honored to call you my brother."
“And…?”
There are galaxies on the ceiling, turning and twisting and spinning and the world has never been so beautiful before.
“You fucking cunt, leaving us without any explanation. You want to choose Heaven over us? Fine, be that way. But I really thought that choice was made ages ago when you decided to fight with us.”
“I—I can’t… Dean.”
It’s raining tonight (darling, why won’t you come home?) and I try not to think as I sing “Hey, Jude” in a melody of tears while the rhythm of the rain keeps time, and the clock of the living room reminds me of all the seconds that tickle away while you’re not here.
“You’re lucky your brother is even alive, Mr. Maxwell. Five more minutes and Samuel would be dead.”
"I am. And I will."
“So sorry.”
As I try to reach a place that I’m not even sure it exists, I discover I like to think you’ve driven these roads.
Castiel's usual wide range of vocabulary was limited to grunts and groans.
Castiel realized their close proximity and remembered something about 'personal space' he decided to move and let Dean be.
"Dean faster p-please faster." He felt Castiel's swollen member on his stomach, hot and hard, he reached his hand down and thrust it between his fist lazily while his movements sped up. Dean could feel himself coming to an end but not before his beautiful angel.
"Yeah, uhh what is it?" Dean mused, mildly annoyed that he didn't get the chance to finish this conversation with Cas, I mean it was all a misunderstanding.
At age sixteen he had whacked off to hetero porn but she sounds of the over-the-top screaming from the female didn’t grab his attention. Instead, he was focused on the male, the deep masculine moans as he fucked into the baby sitter, the way his eyes were screwed shut in pleasure and his thighs clenched as he neared orgasm. No, the sounds of the female were background noise as the Pizza man emptied into her and at the same time the confused teenage boy sat there in shame at what he had just done, he was supposed to get off by watching the woman but he couldn’t get the thoughts of strong muscular arms gripping his sides out of his mind.
“Agreed.”
He places some water and painkillers on the desk and leaves the room.
They gripped on to each other like it was the last time they'd ever touch.
He deserves an explanation.
He couldn’t stop thinking about it all through class, who was Green?
He needed something to fuck, he blamed Castiel for his pent up sexual frustration.
"To be fair, last time-" He tried to retort but Dean kept interrupting.
Dean gets back to the bunker at about 1am.
He hears three knocks on his door and then the handle turning. "Cas what are you doing in there man?"
Even Becky got her happy ending with her husband and kids.
"Shit!" He curses and Cas looks up at him. "The ring."
"We need to talk." Ironically that was the line Dean used on Cas when he kicked him out.
"Out."
"You're awake." Came the thick honey covered voice. "What have you done to Cas?" He growled at the goddess, she grinned again. "He's just sleeping." She whistled innocently. "Angel's don't sleep."
There they stayed in each others embrace, Dean snored softy and Castiel watched over him.
"What? No he doesn't man. If anything it is the opposite."
He breathes faster as their bodies are pulled flush against eachother. Tugging and pulling, gripping and griding. He looks into his beautiful safire eyes and lovingly bushes a lock of dark hair from his forehead.
“Dean! Dean! I- ahh! Dean!” Castiel sobbed loudly as his balls drew up and felt impossibly tight, he felt a tingle in the base of his dick, it got more and more acute and then he came hard, shaking with the full force of his orgasm, Dean nailed his prostate one more time and he seized up and cried out as his cock spurted another load of come between their bodies reigniting his already powerful orgasm making him arch his back and throw back his head as he yelled Dean’s name.
"P-p-please." Dean mocked. "Wake up Winchester, this will never be real. Did you really think that Castiel would love a broken thing like you? You? He is an angel of the lord."
The half naked guy had stepped aside revealing his equally half naked brother fumbling towards him. "Who is this?" Sam questioned, although the evidence was clear enough. Was his brother finally coming out of the closet? With this Cas look alike, oh fuck Cas! He turned to where Castiel was and the angel looked hurt.
"Ah- Cas!" He groans, finding his pace again, he tried to avoid Cas' prostate because he can't imagine that will feel good so soon after an orgasm.
"Ask me again."
She looked up at him, shock and disappointment written on her features.
Now I bet you’re wondering when I get to Castiel and Dean and also, I bet you’re thinking why are they putting themselves in the narrative, Isn't that an overused trope? It’s because I have run out of ideas and have no idea how to surreptitiously transition to the start of a new story; the story of how Dean and Cas got together which I shall reveal in the next chapter because it’s a complicated and steamy story, it needs more than a few lines and before we get to that, I must get ahead of myself. ;)
"God I miss you so much." He quickly turned around in his lovers arms but Castiel wasn't there. "Cas!?" Dean started to panic, usually in his dreams Castiel would always be with him, he could always see him. "Dammit. Fucking dammit." He swore.
After what seemed like hours he finally pulled out and rolled off Castiel onto his side of the bed with a small thud. "So..." Dean grinned. "How was that?" Castiel just looked at him, the aftershocks of his orgasm still making his cock twitch. "Dean I- there are no words."
"At this hour?"
But he would never get to, the thought of it hurt him.
Dean straddled his hips and kissed him like he would never get the chance again, because deep down he knew he wouldn't. This was all in his head, a fantasy...his dirty little secret. No it wasn't dirty, it was beautiful Castiel layed out beneath him, blushing and smiling, laughing.
“Uh yeah studying at the library.” He said cautiously trying not to sound interesting.
Castiel felt like an awful feeling in his stomach, so Dean regretted it?
Gripping the sleeve of the trenchcoat he pulls Castiel to him but topples over, strong hands grip his back stopping him from an embarrassing fall. "Hello Dean."
“I need you Cas.” He said as he desperately pushed Castiel back onto the bed and straddled him.
He glanced towards Castiel, although the angel's plan had worked he was still angry. He never consulted Sam or Dean before temporarily dying, who the hell gave him the right? This would bug Dean for a few days to come, maybe a bit of cold shoulder would set Cas right.
Was Dean going to kiss him? After all this time.
Dean didn’t know how to respond but before he could open his mouth the sound of wings falling echoed behind him. Multiple wings?
They started to grind against each other as the kiss became more heated, the angel was making quiet breathy moans and Dean loved it. "I'm going to fuck you on the bed now, Cas. You'll be screaming my name angel." He whispered hotly into the angel's ear, he shuddered.
A little bit of smut is described here but nothing too graphic, just a warning
This was it.
They finally got to the bunker and in his drunk state he figured that he could get away with touching the angel a little bit more.
Dean woke up with his face pressing into the angel's neck and Castiel kept his blue gaze on the freckled man beneath him, Dean streched. "Mornin' gorgeous." He grinned. "You been watching me all night?" Castiel blushed. "You look peaceful when you sleep, it's the only time you don't look so burdened."
Dean gripped Castiel's hands and pulled him in tighter.
“What now? Are you going to return home?” He asked hopefully.
"Is this about when I kissed you? Look Cas I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, honest I wish it had never happened." He explained frantically moving his arms.
"Mmmphf." He replied.
He feels it pulse in his hand as he gives an experimental lick to the head and then goes straight to sucking the top of his cock and stroking the base.
"Goodnight Dean." He says before he turns and exits the bedroom.
"Could you two kindly shut the fuck up? I mean seriously I was trying to sleep last night and all I could hear was
Steve shut the door behind Dean the drunken hunter sat on the twin motel bed. "Appreciate'this maan." He smiled.
Dean picked up the tie that he has discarded on the bed. He brought Cas' hands up above his head and fastened them together with the blue tie. "Keep them above your head, don't move." He said as he took Cas' nipple in his mouth and bit lightly.
“Hello Hannah.” He greeted.
“You doing anything after school?” He asked hopefully, fiddling with his sleeve.
"Please don't." Came the quiet voice from across the room, they both froze. "Fuck Sammy is here, shit." He had completely forgotten about his mortified brother.
"Look, it's just protocol is all, we need to ask these questions if you know what I mean." Dean reassured him and the man let out a sigh. "Look...you didn't hear this from me but from time to time a gang comes in here, leader is called Bill, they look like the type of guys who would, ya know..." Dean gave him a nod. "Your partner is awfully quiet." He inquired. Dean looked over to Castiel who sat there in stoney silence.
The man just looked them up and down. "Oh god." He chuckled unpleasantly. "You're not are you? Fuck they even got them in the government now. It's a disease I swear." Then he took a step forward. "I didn't kill those men, ain't had nothing to do with them." His smile stretched wide across his face menacingly. "But I wish I had."
Dammit! Then he heard something, a door creak open and a beam of light hit his face.
Five minutes after he had sent it, he got a reply.
All about the candy? Castiel chuckled, he was starting to sound like Gabriel, then Castiel froze in horror...Was it Gabriel? No, it couldn’t be, Gabriel had been crushing on that Scottish girl with the weird name beginning with R, Gabriel wasn’t gay.
“Charlie.” Dean greeted fondly as she slipped inside the room. “What are you doing here?”
Dean looked up to see a hurt expression on Jacks face. "Aw man, look I'm sorry I ain't good at...look he was uh...he was Cas, just Cas." He gave a small smile. "Bravest son of a bitch I knew, he was good, funny too...for an angel, he had a sense of humor, he was different. He always called me out on my bullshit. He could always say the right thing...but I uh- I didn't appreciate him, I didn't listen, I kept pushing him away and now he's..." Dean cut himself off before it got too personal.
"Yeah he would'a liked you kid." Suddenly Jacks eyes flashed yellow and he doubled back, Dean just stared.
Dean brushed past his concerned brother who was about to speak. "-not now Sammy, I have to go somewhere."
Castiel thought back to the time when he had first been exposed to gay porn, he had been surfing the internet at age twelve and it had taken him to some dodgy website because before he knew it gay porn was popping up everywhere and they ads seemed to be unclickable. At first Castiel had panicked, but then he started to stare more intently, not to be pervy or anything just with a childlike curiosity.
"Were they acting strange at all? When you saw them?"
Castiel's eyes flickered open and he stared up at Dean. "Dean you're ok."
“Oh, oh yeah I was uh, well I figured you’d never get to do it yourself so. Yeah.”
Wanted to see him fall apart under Dean's hands as his blue eyes go wide and then squeeze shut because it's too much for him.
"Who is this." He growled. The line once again crackled. "Sam it's me, it's Castiel. I'm on my way back to the bunker, I'm calling in advance as to not provoke an unnecessary attack."
He stared at it mournfully before putting it on the side table.
He got home and jumped in the shower, but it was later interrupted by the vibration of his phone, he hastily checked it.
Dean looked at the sunset and the calm waves sloshing against the damp sand as the cool air whipped his body softly.
As if that was explanation enough. Dean couldn't understand it, the man didn't even know he was the King. What could he possibly see in him that made him want to help him. Without that stupid crown he wasn't anyone.
His eyes roved over the crowd, there at the door was the man from the woods. He was with a short redheaded woman and a tall muscular man. They weren’t looking at the stage, but around the room as if searching for someone.
"So why does Azazel matter?"
"Hello, Dean," Cas said.
“Sam,” Dean held up his hand to forstall him. “I got this. I already promised Cas I would take care of him.”
The man raised a skeptical eyebrow, "Seriously Dean, stop with all this nonsense.  Jessica wants you home for the wedding."
"Ah, Castiel," He pretended to suddenly take his notice. "Look, I wanted to commend you on your little...rescue mission last night. I didn't think you had such bravery in you." Cas narrowed his eyes waiting for the punch-line. When none came he was left feeling confused. Michael didn't give out compliments lightly after all, but surely there was more to this. He wasn't wrong.
"No," Cas leaned back, cheeks flushing with embarrassment "no I totally understand. You don't have to tell me." He shook his head as if in apology for even asking.
Jo was talking to the captain of the princess’s personal guard, Jody Mills, as they entered the hall. She turned towards them and the Princess stopped short.
Cas gasped, glad he was braced on the door over Dean’s head.
Sam folded his arms across his massive chest, "Do you honestly think that I'm not coming?"
Dean brightened. “I mean.. We practically are anyway. Might as well make it official. Not sure what kind of wedding I can afford on a mechanics salary, but…”
It took three tries, a lot of grunting and some sort of divine intervention, but he did manage to get them both to their feet. It was the most undignified thing Castiel had ever had to do, but it had worked.
“Only opened his eyes to the truth, Castiel. I’ll help you out too.” He made it sound like a balm. He touched Cas’s forehead.
Dean licked his lips nervously. "Uh, what's this?" His voice did not go up an octave. It didn't. He swallowed trying to regain some composure. Why did he feel suddenly hot?
Dean pulled up in the impala, kicking up dust in the dry hot air as he parked in the long driveway. He made a low whistle as he exited 'Baby', the name Castiel had learned was the cars.
Charlie looked at her feet. "No. But that isn't really possible."
Dean snorted, running a hand through his strangely longish hair. He would have to get it cut. "I cannot thank you enough for everything Bobby, I don't even know-" He cut himself off shaking his head, and taking a deep swig of beer.
"Thank you for taking such good care of her." He told him as he rode away. The boy had no time to do more than gawk at him as he rode away, staring down at his good fortune with complete disbelief.
"Yes, seriously. Castiel dove into the ice cold river and pulled him out."
"Right," Dean said, looking at his hands. Still put off by any mention of his 'unique' circumstances. "Well, I was told, when I wrote to the school that I would be allowed to return to finish my senior year. I took some courses online, but I still need to finish-"
He thought about this, his puppy eyes narrowing. “I feel vast. Like i have all this room inside me.”
"Will someone please tell me what in the world happened over break?" Anna pleaded looking from face to face, practically bouncing up and down on the bench.
Sancho said nothing.
"Come on Cas, what is it?"
"What?" He asked. Teeth still chattering.
He opened up his suitcase and pulled out his toiletries making his way to the small bathroom at the back of the room. He made himself brush his teeth and began to disrobe.
Sancho looked at the cash and walked into the convenience store. The sales clerk, a middle aged man with golden hair pulled back in a ponytail glanced at him as he entered then went back to watching what looked like porn on his monitor.
The man laughed. "Finally something going right for us. To the hills!"
“This place is far from empty.” Gabe mused. “We all woke up a little while ago.”
Cas walked to the kitchen and pick up the receiver of the ancient looking telephone. "Dial tone!" He calls out happily. He punches in some numbers. "Hello? Gabriel? Yeah, it's me- No it's Cas. Castiel. Gabe this isn't funny, will you listen? I saved a man from drowning and we got- Yes, yes. Gabe. They did? Are they still- yes? Okay well bring them along- We got washed downstream and we are at the Crowley cabin. No, we are half hypothermic and- Can you give me to Michael you ass? You will? Can you bring warm things, clothes-" He got an exasperated look on his face, "Will you just-" Completely done. "Yes. Thank you Gabriel." Cas hung up the phone looking murderous.
The ‘friend’ showed up not long after. An older gentleman with sandy blonde hair and a tan jacket. Something about him was familiar but Sam couldn’t put his finger on why.
"You looked so beautiful up there. You looked comfortable...like you did in the woods that day when you saved me from that wretched boar. Strong and sure of yourself."
"I need more," Is all he said. Curt, emotionless. While his insides squirmed. While he pictured what she had been wearing at school that day. Her tight jeans and tight black t-shirt. Her leather coat on the floor.
He narrowed his eyes at her, "You will be dressed and in the kitchens in a quarter hour or I will send your brothers up to fetch you. Is that clear?"
“No, no, no, no, you listen here. You leave my family and my friends out of this.”
Headlights ticked on, flooding the parking lot with stark yellow lights. Sam turned his head from it, blinded momentarily, he put out his arm as if he could shield Ruby from it as well.
He chewed silently for a minute. "I was thinking around the time I lost count. But maybe just ten." Dean raised an eyebrow. He could eat, sure, but this was ridiculous. "What?" He gesticulates with the bitten in two burger. "Diving is hungry work."
Zachariah's face was red and blotchy with rage. Bobby motioned for the nearest guards to restrain the man. "Castiel, I am here by order of the king to have every lass in the land try on this glass slipper to see if they are his lost dance partner from the ball. Would you care to have a seat, young lady?"
He decided he needed to hide. He ran to the little wagon, and took the three little wooden steps all painted red, up into the place. There was no one inside, but the place was deceptively large on the inside. He wouldn't have believed the little wagon could hold so much. On either side were rows of gowns. Gowns of every size shape and color, and all in the latest style.
"Tell me the truth Gabe. What do you know about Uncle Nick...and what is has to do with Dean Winchester and...Dad's disappearance."
“Because I live on planet Earth, Chuck.”
Dean, not really wanting to have this conversation, tried to get out of it by pretending not to hear him and stepping past him into the bathroom. Again Sam used his great height and arm length advantage blocking his access to the bathroom door.
"Get your drunk friend to bed will you? And if your smart you'll drink those and not let him have any."
Sam gives her a look, "Yeah, Dean?  What does it taste like?"
The water was ice cold, and he felt his lungs empty of air on impact. More from the intense cold than from the slap of the water. He had a moment of panic under the water, feeling like he was upside down. His skin felt like it was burning, but not, and his lungs ached as he clawed his way to the surface, turning in circles to find where his brother had gone. It was too dark to see, all he could see was the fog of his breathe.
The hope in his eyes as he looks up at Dean is almost too much. "I would love a burger."
Castiel nodded, grabbing up his bags and almost falling out of the wagon without using the short little stairs. They were now in the main square market, and the bright little wagon had already attracted a little crowd of ladies who had just heard news of the ball.
The computer beeped. Chuck craned his neck around to the screen to check it out.
The blue eyes man looked down at his blade. "It was my mothers. She always said it was her favorite hair pin." He looked at the thing again, red with blood "Made by angels." He added, uncertain.
"I don't know. That thing was stuck fast, he came along and it seemed to just slide right out. Legend says one who is chosen by the gods will pull it from the stone."
“So what’s your plan for tomorrow? I can recommend some places to eat and drink if you want…”
"Not yet. I want you first to feel the water. Notice the temperature and how it feels on your skin. Now I want you to imagine being in it."
Dean smiled, “You sleep okay?”
Cas grimaced, embarrassed. He hadn’t really thought far.
"You want to help them so much? Why don't you join them?"
Jo stiffened at the sight, nearly dropping the beers in her hands.
“So you prayed to me,” Cas explained. Dean didn’t actually have to say his name out loud to be heard, it was the intention behind the words after all that made him come to him.
The bathroom was out of paper towels. Dean scowled wiping his clean hands on his less than clean jeans and exited the bathroom in an even more foul mood than he had entered.
Castiel smiled taking his hunter by the hand and they walked slowly back up the beach together.
His nights were filled with quiet contemplation and a lot of information gathering in the form of inadvertent eavesdropping on all the other residents of the hotel/bar/cafe complex.
“We’re not stock boys anymore, Dean! We are leaders. Buy More leaders. And you wonder why Big Rufus wants me as assistant manager.”
"You got that?" Castiel asked.
His thought swirled around what he should have done, how he could have gotten Dean to stay, he fondled himself a bit, but ultimately gave up on that and got out. He felt clean and slightly calmer, but nowhere near sleep.
Where the hell was he?
The ball.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yeah, well, this idiot fell in the river trying to stand up or some shit so I had to go in after him. You know, cause he can't swim."
"What?" Anna looked from one to the other. "Seriously?"
The stable lad was no more than fourteen, and eager to please when he recognized him from the week before.
“Jack tried to send him a message in the empty, but I have no way of knowing if he got it, or that he believed it. It’s been months. I keep trying to find another way into the empty, but the new Death isn’t answering our calls.” Dean didn't mention that they had killed the reaper to make her death, trying to convince her that it was a good idea to help them, but as soon as they had accumulated all of Deaths past knowledge she had left with a stern message that they would not be helping the Winchesters with anything ever again.
"So," Gabe finally broke the awkward silence. "Dean Winchester."
“Fine, look you’re right, I think Lucifer is nearby, but seriously the man is not easy to find. I’ve had some sightings, but it’s always too late to figure out where he is.”
Jimmy looks at him askance, but gives him a pragmatic answer. “Until she defected,” The elevator dings and the door opens, “again.” He add cryptically. “Did she try an contact you?” he asks as they run to the stairwell.
He moved his arms and kicked his feet and kept himself together, punching out to the black surface of the water and taking in another controlled breath. Turning in a quick circle while he tread water to orient himself as the river pulled him along. As he left the weak yellow light of his dock he was plunged into darkness, so he heard more than saw the feebly splashing figure to his left. He ducked his head and crawled towards the drowning man. He was on him in a just a few strokes. Water safety classes came to the fore of his mind and he got an arm around the man's chest and hauled him onto his back so his head was out of the water.
"Why?"
“Listen to me. Whatever happened with Anna, you couldn’t have known.” Jimmy’s anger spiked back to full fury at the condescending words. “You couldn’t have stopped it.”
"Go, child before your family comes back.”
“Cas!”
“You bastard!” Dean choked out, his fists bunching at his sides.
“Well, Cas, it is my job to make your stay comfortable and so far i don’t think i’ve done that great of a job.”  He grabbed a set of keys from the counter. “Let’s get you in your room.” And he came around the counter grabbing Cas’s rolling suitcase as he walked by. His shoulder brushing against Cas’s on the way.
“No, you’re alive.”
“Yeah no. Pretty sure they’re not. Anyways, does dads journal say how to find them by any chance?”
“Why?” Even while asking, Sam pulled out his phone and searched it up, pulling up directions in less than ten seconds.
“Hopefully we won’t end up back in here anymore. Guys?” A pair of men walked in after Cas, one who held Deans upper arms (as if it would actually manage to hold him still) while the other unlocked the jacket from around him. Rolling his shoulders as much as he could, Dean let himself be lead out of the padded room and down a hall.
“Put us back. Now.” Clicking his tongue, Gabriel switched his gaze back to Sam and shook his head.
“You knew?”
“Who’s who? What are you guys talking about?” He gestured to Sam to talk as he was too busy walking away and inspecting every surface for any clue as to where the trickster went.
“You sure? It’s gonna take hours and hours of sawing through skin muscle and bone to get it off, but if you’re sure.” The guys smirk was falling with every word Dean said, still he didn’t speak.
“Doesn’t matter now. What does matter is eating the rest of these pies.” He could feel Sam’s stare next to him but chose to continue his streak and managed to down the rest of them without breaking down.
“Any suspects?”
“I don’t know, you’re just, different.” The silence between them came back with a vengeance as they passed door by door until Cas stopped in front of one looking exactly like the rest. “Your stop,” he explained with the wave of his hand.
“Uh, he-he said his name was Jim Rockford.” Shoulders falling half an inch, Dean nodded and moved to follow the other man out of the room when he lead him into a room where he spotted a familiar face.
“How can you say that? After everything he’s done for us you don’t even want to look for him?”
“Thanks.” He ignored the others smile and walked in, shutting it behind him without looking back before glaring around the room with a frown. “This ought to be fun.” He was correct in his assumption that he wouldn’t sleep much but he somehow managed to get in three and a half hours of sleep before he was awake once more. He wasn’t exactly supposed to wander and he wasn’t going to, but then he found that his bathroom didn’t have a toothbrush and he needed to do his morning routine otherwise he’d feel off the rest of the day. Yeah.
“Got to ask, why are you helping me? From what I’m getting, I’m a pretty messed up dude with psychotic visions.” Cas shrugged next to him, all while keeping his eyes facing forwards.
“Not Cuckoo for Coco Puffs?” He offered. Cas nodded before leading the way up into a small one bedroom flat with the barest essentials.
“Alright then, guess we better figure out who fits the bill.” Several hours later they laid in wait as a van pulled up outside of the one family fitting the criteria’s home. It definitely didn’t belong to them, there were no plates and two men wearing skeleton masks hopped out. Smirking, he shifted onto his other foot in wait as they drew closer.
“I don’t use this place often, it’s more for when I have guests.” Nodding, Dean walked in and started poking around in the nearest drawer. It was slammed closed, narrowly avoiding amputating his hand clean off. Looking wide eyes at Cas he found the other glaring at him.
“So Santa’s real then? That’s an account of someone seeing him?” Jack asked wide eyed and hopeful and his mouth was halfway to forming the words that, no, not quite. It was a silly poem made by someone who wanted something to tell his kids when the words died in his mouth. It was in the bunker, and in an entire section dedicated to the fat guy in red. Grinning, he shrugged and picked up his own beer.
“That’s great, want to share with the class?” Standing up, he ignored the others question and went to grab the keys to a car Sam surely stole on his way towards the door when Sam stopped him. “Before we do whatever bad idea you’re thinking of, you need to take a shower and change. You stink.”
“I don’t want to get punched.”
“Bitch.” Grabbing the keys along the way, the two exited and hoped in the car Sam pointed to. “Alright, where are we going?”
“Yeah, well. Anyway, get this, the body that they found other you standing over had odd incisions on their upper gums that later revealed they were filled with sharp fang like teeth. So, yeah, other you actually did take down a vamp.” Sighing, Dean smiled behind his hand and rolled his shoulders.
“You could say that again.” Sam said, sighing and leaning back.
“My brother, Sam? Sammy? Four years younger than me? Seriously where is he.”
Nothing else to do, he shut his eyes and only opened them up again when his door banged open, startling him from his peace of mind. Rolling out of bed, he spared no seconds in grabbing a stake and aiming it at the intruder while pocketing his lock-pick. Instead of an enemy, Bobby stood there, frantically searching the room for him.
“You are welcome. Now, lets get you some food as you’ve probably only had that pie from earlier.” Standing up, Cas hastily made his retreat back to his kitchen. Even if he finally realized everything, he wasn’t going to say anything. It wasn’t necessary right now. What he needed was to first find out how Dean’s true mentality was without the dugs and then, figure out where to go next. Still, he had no intention of letting Dean go through it on his own, he would be there right besides him making sure he never felt alone.
“You didn’t give me a chance to tell you before Cas, you left before I could say I love you too.” The others eyes flickered between both of his own and he set their foreheads together. “Sorry it took so long to say.”
“It’s okay it’s okay we’re not here to hurt you. Come on.” He smiled and extended his hand to them. They took it and let themselves be lead out until they suddenly stopped. Reacting before his brain could fully comprehend it, he shoved them behind him with a screamed “Run!”
“Dean, focus, they’re going to up your dosage every time you freak out, it shouldn’t effect you in any way other than making you more focused and hopefully stop the hallucinations.”
“Like lights flickering or...” he stopped, snapping his head back to the counter and straightening up. “Son of a bitch.” Standing, Sam followed soon after and they left a confused Cas to sit alone.
He had to say, the kid definitely came through for him, maybe he should send him a gift basket. Do they send those through inter dimensional wavelengths? It didn’t matter, all that mattered currently was the man sitting besides him in the car and the one mocking him in the backseat. See what he could do indeed.
“Right right, it’s uh,” searching his memory he recalled it after a few seconds. “Celeste! Sorry, forgot.” She shook her head at him but didn’t comment. “You didn’t answer my question, what’s going on? You look freaked.” She continued to shake her head but lost the nervous smile.
“With a little old driver so lively and quick, I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; ‘Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!’” Dean donned the most overblown impression of Santa he could, complete with sticking out his stomach and deepening his voice, earning a laugh from Charlie and a snort from Claire and Jody.
“About seven times since you got here.” Blowing out an impressed whistle, Dean switched over to an easygoing smile while still leaning forwards.
“So, evil mimes am I right?” If he couldn’t feel their glares, he could certainly feel his brothers.
“Well, I will leave you two to it.” With that she spun on her heel and walked away. Behind him the door opened and another voice he knew called out to him.
“Where were you two? I’ve been looking for you both for a week after you didn’t call in.”
“Well, what better way to reintroduce myself into you two muttonheads life’s than with a big bang!” Sam resisted the urge to roll his eyes and instead stared at Gabriel with a thinly veiled lack of patience.
“Well,” Dean started, stepping up to stand next to the other Cas, “I got to say man you-“ he cut himself off, shaking his head before slamming his palm down on the others shoulder. “You really helped me out, so thank you, you know, for not thinking I’m batshit insane and believing in me.” Cas nodded.
“You come here a lot, right? Does Gabriel usually work the counter?” Standing from his seated position, Cas looked around as well and upon not seeing the trickster shook his head.
“Mimes.” He answered automatically, looking at Sam across the top of the impala. His brother held it together for a second before a huff made its way out.
“Honestly, like I had a choice in believing you after a man just comes out of nowhere and then disappears again into a stop watch.”
Slamming his fist into the wood, it opened a second later to his brothers confused face. The look cleared the second he took in Dean’s face and he gripped Dean’s shoulders to pull him into a hug.
“Why?”
“I’m not hunting any Martin’s if that’s what you’re worried about.” He said while glancing around the hallway around them. He wasn’t sure what exactly he was looking for but it at least gave him something to do.
“Would you rather be arrested? Stop being a baby.” With a pout, Cas lowered his hand and squeezed his eyes shut. Rolling his own eyes, Dean spared a second to sigh before hitting fake-Cas in the jaw in a way that would quickly form a bruise. Cas flexed his jaw and went to speak when someone started pounding on the door, yelling to let them in.
“So who are we here for again?” Sam didn’t miss the quick glance Dean sent his way once they were out and headed towards the front door but chose not to comment on it.
“We just have to trust that the little guy can get it done.”
The moonlight caught his eye automatically and left his shoulders dropping and a smile catching his face once more. It was time to get the hell out of dodge. Running through the nearby forest he heard an alarm blare behind him and sped up. No chance any of them would catch up to him on foot, but there was always the chance they had golf carts. He managed to get a good half mile away before stopping for a break.
“Cas.”
“Well, dr. Singer had a prior commitment and as you know dr. Shirley is on vacation. Now, is there anything you’d like to share Dean.” Piercing his lips, Dean looked off into the distance and shook his head.
“Ouch!” It wasn’t his voice that came out, but he was feeling the sentiment. His body collided with theirs and instead of going down, Dean stayed firm in his stance and caught them halfway.
“No.” He didn’t elaborate further, just let the word float freely. Nodding, Dean walked away from the display case to stand in front of the other-Cas.
“What the-oh, it’s you.” He wasn’t sure whether or not to be disappointed in the exasperation of the others voice. None the less, he set Cas back onto his feet and started to walk away. “Wait!” Resisting the urge to groan, Dean didn’t stop walking but he didn’t speed up either, leaving the doc to catch up to him with a quickened pace. “Hold on, where were you?”
“Nice try, but someone who is really scared, who is completely terrified about what’s out there? They don’t act calmly, not in the way you are. So I’ll ask again, how many times have we gone through Martin, you said? Martin’s story?” He didn’t mention the fact that he and Sam already went over anything weird with this place. There were disappearances, not deaths. She sighed and sat back, glancing around.
“No, evil mimes Sam I’m telling you.”
Cutting off his thoughts with the shake of his head he continue inside. Behind him he could hear footsteps and felt eyes on his back but he ignored it in favor of walking on. A slight shifting in the room next to him drew both of their attentions.
“Because, that’s why.” Scoffing at his brothers antics, Sam silently went back to staring ahead of him at the road until they pulled up into a parking lot and both got out.
“Dude, what’s wrong with you?”
“Yeah, there’s something I’ve been wanting to check out since we got here.” They hung up soon after and met up in the square within twenty minutes. When Sam walked up to him, he straightened from leaning on his car and called Miracle over to him.
“Cas, you are one stupid son of a bitch.” That seemed to actually work in making the other look at him.
“Okay uh, authorities say the two were brothers and wanted money for drugs, approached man, got stabbed, they still haven’t found him and all he left behind was a...”
System automatically kicking into gear, Deans body worked on its own and next thing he knew he was sitting up and snapping his head side to side in a desperate attempt to figure out where he was. One quick glance around told him everything he needed to know and had the added effect of confusing him all the same.
“Sam.”
“Gabriel.” Cas stared at him with a head tilt, mouth just open enough to be noticeable. Dean forced back a smile at the look. Sure that other Castiel may have looked and cared slightly like his Cas but damn. That movement all on its own proved this was his world.
“Either that or a rogue hunter, either are pretty likely.” Sam leaned back, staring at the screen.
“It’s the place up north that’s ten times worse than here? At least three people a year get sent there, Dean. No one ever gets out of there, not unless they’re in a body bag. Look I-“ another set of footsteps and Bobby quietly cussed before shoving Dean in another direction all together. “Go that way! Two lefts and a right and you should run into Novak, he’ll help, just tell him what’s going on.” Shaking his head, Dean would have stayed if Bobby didn’t growl at him to get moving. Turning tail, he bolted out of the room and took the exact directions Bobby told him only to face a heavy wooden door.
“Who.” He demanded.
“Well do you know if he honestly believes we aren’t from here.”
“Smart move.”
“Nope.”
They took off while he and Sam blocked the men’s exit point.
Thanks to his momentary lapse of attention, two managed to seize his arms and slammed him into the ground as well. He barley managed to stay conscious through it and just managed to discern the voice above hims words.
“Hello Dean.” Within the second he was hoisted to his feet and came face to face with a woman who he wouldn’t remember had it not happened with his dad.
“I just don’t get why the dog gets the front seat and I have to sit in the back.” Next to him, Miracle let out a whine and laid his head down on Dean’s lap.
“Get on with it.” Cas snapped, even he was apparently growing tired of the others antics. Piercing his lips, Dean fought in a laugh before shifting to face the other three fully.
It was a good thing he sat down as a moment later his stomach felt warm, unnaturally so, and his eye lids dropped mechanically. He wasn’t tired a few seconds ago but, damn, now he wasn’t sure how he even managed to keep his eyes open in the first place.
“I don’t,” Castiel glanced back, relaxing his intense face for the slightest flash of a smile, “but you do. Go and fix whatever this is that needs fixing.”
“Well, Jack said he’d see what he could do.”
“Oh excuse me.”
The second his target was in sight, he leapt out and took off it’s head within the second. The other masked freak took note of this and went to hit Dean when Sam caught it’s leg and its head with bullets soaked in deadman’s blood. Of course, the sound of a gun going off awoke the family they were trying so desperately to keep safe so while Sam grabbed mister unconscious he gathered the head and body and they hightailed it down the road to the little stretch of woods they’d parked the car.
“My cousin. He just found out where I’ve been all this time and decided to visit.” She nodded but still looked skeptical. Still, she let it go.
“Hello again, this is my partner agent Wanasck.”
“Cas.” He said, walking away from the direction he was headed in and coming to a stop in front of the other man.
“Last I’d heard you hadn’t found him.”
“Thank you,” the orderly nodded and left the two of them alone. The other figure stood from his seat and crossed the room in four solid steps to pull Dean into a hug.
“You won’t be able to what, Dean.” Clenching his jaw, his hands tightened on the box, creating an unfixable dent.
“Let’s go.” He looked back to where the kid disappeared from and nodded before spotting a certain furry someone and promptly dropping to his knees and confusing his brother. Making kissy and cooing noises at it, the dog slowly made it’s way over to Dean with it’s tongue hanging out of the side of it’s mouth. Once it was close enough he reached out and took the pup into his arms.
“So what are we thinking? Djinn?” Sam sighed and shook his head.
“Rugaru,” he corrected without thinking.
“That dick? Yeah, it’s him.”
A simple hunt, that’s all it is, or was. The night before had turned up nothing which lead to him being disgruntled and getting both comforted and ignored by his brother and his boyfriend respectively. Waking up the next day though had been a ride he had not been prepared for.
In the end, he ended up with a homemade lock pick, a stake and a whole lot of loose pieces littered about. Not long after, they called out for lights out and Dean abided by it, first hiding his newly created tools before laying above the covers. The bed squeaked beneath him as he stared up at the low light coming from the window above.
"Dean?? Where the hell are you man?" Sam sounded grumpy and worried. "Look Sam we don't have much time but we got captured, Cad is gonna tell you all he knows about the bitch." Dean held the phone to Cas and he began to speak.
"You married?" She asked matter of factly.
Castiel thought about it. “I suppose we’ve never had occasion.” He told Dean. “I mean we have mutual friends but we’ve never hung out alone.”
I feel like if I'm going to finish this I need to write most of it today so I may upload a few more chapters today.
Castiel let out a huff. “Ah shit I’ll call you back my aunt is calling me.” He said quickly. “Seeya soon.” And then he hung up before Hannah could say anything.
But then he would be taken away, he was still needed no matter how useless he was told he was. Jack needed him, Dean needed him, even Sam.
Castiel hurriedly kissed him on the mouth, pushing into the lean hunter. His arms encircled Dean's neck and Dean pulled him closer trying to feel every inch of the angel, with hands roaming and tounges clashing Dean was very aware of how open and vulnerable they both were.
"Dean you have to understand-" Castiel unfortunately though that was the best moment to share his feelings.
"No, Castiel. Castiel is my father." Dean clenched his fists, how dare he. Cas was dead because of him and he was calling him his father. "Kid he ain't your father ok." He snapped.
"Yeah well, I do. Don't think I haven't forgotten about the packed duffle."
And he did, deeper, harder and faster with each thrust till they were both a mess, both moving in tandem overwhelmed by this moment.
"Where?"
“Mr. Winchester you are late, need I remind you that this is your third offence so I’ll be seeing you after class for detention.” Mr. McLeod scolded. He was a short man who always wore black and had the kind of British accent that made you feel sorry for ever being born whenever he reprimanded you, so of course he was a teacher of English.
“This one.” A gravelly voice answered and Dean whipped round.
The truth was Dean was hurt, he felt rejected. But that didn't matter for now because Castiel was here, was human.
Castiel gave him a confused look and went back to staring at some bee socks.
All three friends walked through the halls of Stone Hill High and they made their way to the weekly school assembly. Richard Roman an aspiring politician turned Principal did not look happy, truth be told he never looked happy, he hated his job and he hated children, most people wondered why he took the job maybe because of his insatiable need to exert power over people, he enjoyed the control. He was a skinny man with cropped dark hair and an icy smile. Dick, a nickname that suited him well, given to him by most of his co-workers and students, was the only sort of retaliation that you could get away with in his school.
"Dean." He breathed tugging at Dean's shirt. "Off."
Dean is left there, standing still, hurt and confusion radiating off the hunter.
Castiel frowns at him like he wants more of an explanation.
"You are acting like a child, move."
Every morning without fail he would pick them up in his dark blue 1970 Lincoln Continental, he was very proud of his car but his friend Dean who owned a beautiful black 1967 Chevy Impala, given to him by his father John Winchester, an ex-marine, called it a pimp mobile. Dean Winchester, they were good friends and would often eat lunch together but they weren't hanging-out-just-by-yourselves close. Yet, Castiel couldn’t help but feel drawn to him, he was a popular kid with light brown hair that went straight up, freckles that dotted his nose, Disney princess green eyes and a hand me down brown leather jacket, Dean was a teenage wet dream, but he was also so much more.
"You stupid bastard. Why did you-" Before Dean started to yell he stopped himself, took a deep breath and left the room.
“Heyyyy Hannah.” A short boy with a curly mess of hair said from behind them, he leaned against the locker but fumbled a bit in an attempt to look cool.
“You sure Cas’? I mean you're barely conscious.” It’s true that Castiel’s brain was swimming in some amazing post orgasmic chemicals but he was persistent, he needed dean to claim him.
Without another word she leaves.
He tried again, but it was too late. "He's-"
"You don't have to wake up." He all but begs, sucking marks onto Deans throat. Dean lets out a muffled sob as Castiel worships him.
Dean reaches between them and starts to jerk Castiel off, he'd always wondered what Cas' big O face looked like and he wasn't disappointed. "Come for me Cas, wanna see you."
If they weren't fighting right now they'd be fucking because the sexual tension was enough to melt Dean's inhibitions.
"Sam, that's ridiculous, there is no way of knowing if it is me unless you meet me in person." Sam could practically hear his eyes rolling.
Oh no some shit is about to go down.
"The what? Cas what the hell are you talking about."
Dean's eyes flick down to Castiel's lips and then he licks his own. Castiel felt the hand in his hair tighten and he wanted this more than anything.
"I'm sorry!" He pushed back from her. "I can't go through with this."
“How about we talk in my room?” Dean cuts him off.
"What're'ya doing up so early kid?" He stared at Lucifer's son, he was supposed to be the antichrist but he was a nougat loving zombie fanatic. Fuck...he looked so much like Cas, another pang of sadness welled up inside him.
"You're not going." Dean clutched the sides of the door frame like an unwilling toddler.
"No."
Dean takes Castiel’s hand and leads him over to the bed where they sit down. Not letting go of Cas’ hand he starts to speak. “Cas, I need you to know now I feel.”
"You died Dean, don't you remember? Cas...Cas brought you back." He motioned to Castiel's unconscious form.
Castiel’s chest lit up and he dried his damp hands on the white scratchy towel.
“I’m going to bed.” Sam said and Dean snapped out of his trance.
He wants to hear Castiel desperately pant in his ear and moan his name.
“W-why you laughing?” Chuck demanded.
"Cas, look you probably can't hear me because well...you know you're uh yeah. But I need you, I need you back here man, this kid needs you. I don't know what to do I'm so lost...please just come back to me." Dean closes his eyes, waiting for a few moments, waiting for a "Hello Dean." Or "I'm here." Even the rustle of his trenchcoat! Just fucking something goddamnit, he can't stand the silence.
Kissing his neck, his mouth and sucking bruises into his throat. Dean had never wanted someone more.
Then as he got older, he became more curious.
Then he looked Castiel in the eye. “We doing this Cas?” He asked. Castiel just nodded his head. Dean got on top of him again and bit his ear. “I need a yes or no answer angel.”
“I’m gonna go slow, ok Cas?” He said as he nudged Cas’ entrance with his dick.
They spent the rest of the night holding each other tightly.
please notify me of any changes I should make, or mistakes
“M-My phone?” He asked nervously.
"Dean it's been a long night, we still have a few hours to go. Why don't you let me drive? You should get some sleep." Sam said from beside him.
"No longer romantically interested in me, you slept with someone else."
"Stay."
“Me too Cas. So close so fucking close.” Dean felt his impending orgasm, the tell-tale tingle at the base of his cock resonating in his balls.
“I-I...” She tried but nothing came out.
Then in the morning too! I mean seriously, I'm going to go invest in some ear plugs." Sam complained loudly, Dean knew that Sam was secretly psyched that they were finally together but he had to keep up the disgusted little brother facade.
After about five minutes of lying on the cold floor Dean came in.
"Morning Sunshine." He grinned knowingly.
Dean rolled onto his side of the bed trying to catch his breath. “Fuck. Just fuck.” He gasped looked over to Castiel and seeing that he was equally debauched.
Castiel checked his phone again but not as surreptitiously as he had thought because it was being yanked out of his hands and pocketed by Mr. McLeod.
"Going home early fellas? The party has just begun." They both spun round to see a beautiful tanned woman decorated in beads, tattoos and jewelry, she wore a short white dress and dark purple lipstick. Lightning flashed behind her eyes.
Castiel looked up, a dark epression on his face, the man leaped back as if he had been electrocuted. "Your...your eyes man! The fuck is wrong with your eyes!?" His eyes glowed with grace as he loomed above the man.
aww aren't happy endings so cheesy? I've decided to leave it here because I am working on another fanfiction and I have problems with committing to writing, I lost my motivation for this fanfiction
He trecks through the dark halls of the bunker till he reaches the kitchen, flipping on the lights he spies the coffee machine. Good lord the sweet release of coffee was the only thing he needed right now. He locates his mug but almost drops it when he sees the favorite mug of his former best friend, it had been right behind his and he hadn't even noticed it until now, he analyzes the sky blue cup with a picture of a bee.
“Dean, where is Cas?”
Dean ‘gracefully’ rolled off Cas which earned him another grunt. “Shit sorry.” He winced. Then they got up and resumed killing monsters although Dean could not get his mind off Cas.
He throws his arms around the angel's neck and buries his face in his coat. "Cas Cas Cas." He whispers over and over fisting the material.
If you need me to add anymore tags that you think should be addressed don't hesitate to ask.
Dean imagines how surprised Sam and Jack would be when they finally tell them.
“Cas?”
Dean just held Castiel's body against his own whimpering into his shoulder, dragging his fingers through his soft dark hair as if to comfort the angel, but there was nothing there to comfort anymore. "It's your fault, can't you see? He gave up everything for you. This? This is how you show your appreciation...your love?" He spat those last words at his shaking counterpart.
Next the collected Gabriel, he had a hard time opening the car door because of the giant lollipop in his hand. “Hey guys.” He greeted. Castiel smiled again, he really couldn’t ask for better friends.
"I did some research and apparently eating fish caught by the bones of your victims made you blind, what about an entire leg bone?"
"I can't promise that I will always be around, I don't know when I will die next but Dean, I can promise you that I will always stand by your side, but I can't give you that full certainty that I will be alive tomorrow or the next day." He could have just left it at that, walked away, having won the higher ground.
Dean heard a knock on the door, too rough to be Sam's, too short to be Jack's.
"So tight...oh Cas, feel so good angel." Dean panted in his ear.
"No, they went to the bar then left."
“Something tells me you enjoy punishing me, Sir.” Dean retorted and the Brit ignored his comment.
It had been a long awkward drive, they decided it was best that Jack stay at the bunker as he was having trouble with his powers, they promised him that he could come next hunt.
Dean straddled Castiel again, their cock’s rubbing together, he took Castiel’s arms and pinned them above his head as he kissed him passionately. They were both new at this and both trying to hold as much of each other as they can. The friction of their dicks felt heavenly but Dean and Cas both wanted more.
He cringed at the part about the song but he knew that it was too late and now he had to lie in the bed that he had made.
This entire thing was a big misunderstanding, Dean had never been great at emotions but it was all becoming clear.
He kept the mixtape in a drawer, it was special to him and he didn't want it to get lost.
He opened the drawer next to his bed and pulled out the mixtape.
Castiel noticed a new engraving on the table. “You carved my name into the table?” Castiel questioned.
"I can do whatever I want." He growled.
"Dean I understand it was distressing but it had to be done." He looked Dean in the eye.
But Dean didn't let up, he pulled them together so their chests where touching and Castiel blushed like a virgin.
He placed it on Cas' finger. "Perfect."
"Cas we need-" He is cut off by a kiss. "We need-" But Castiel presses their lips together to silence him.
His chest started to hurt at the mention of Dean.
“Castiel.” Hannah called to him and Castiel turned around.
"Dean please I need you. Now." Dean lifts off him with another teasing smile.
"I'm sorry what?" He growled moving closer to Cas.
Castiel died with a smile on his face.
“No, No, No-” He stumbled and Jack grabbed his head, Chuck could feel his powers drain as he fell to the floor, his armies melted away and everyone could move again.
It only takes a few more seconds before Dean is coming, he yells into Cas' shoulder and shudders his way through it.
Suddenly Cas felt Dean push him onto the bed roughly and he grunted upon impact. Dean straddled his thighs and kissed him deeply.
"Speak of the devil." The bartender muttered.
"Sorry..you uh look like someone I-uh." Dean cuts himself off again. "Hey man, don't worry. Your boyfriend, was he nice?"
He gathers a large amount on his fingers. "You ready?" He searches Cas' face for any sory of hesitation.
Every touch burnt them in the best way, every slow caress of fingers. The pleasure prickled between them at first like when you step into a hot room after being in the snow for too long, then it burst, trying to consume them with every desperate thrust.
"No!" Dean hurried. "Just stay here...I don't want to let you out of my site right now." Castiel glowered at him. "Dean I am billions of years old, I can look after myself." Dean stiffened at his tone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel waited in patient silence.
Dean rolled his eyes and Cas came round the corner.
Jack had brought back Ellen and Jo so naturally Bobby and Ellen had settled down; he had also resurrected Kevin and he went back to college.
Dean swayed in thought and decided that he wasn't going out in a drunken car accident.
Dean maintained eye contact, his face only inches away from his own.
"...Yes."
The phone rung once, twice a third time-
He reached a hand in-between them to stroke Castiel’s flushed, pre-cum covered cock and Cas moaned loudly, he thrust faster and faster holding off his orgasm so that Cas could come first.
Somehow, between the bottle of whiskey and the dark 2am thoughts Castiel had decided that he was no longer wanted and would move out of the bunker.
Detention with Dean wasn’t half bad, yes Cas was counting down the seconds until he had his phone again so he could check his emails, but Dean was a good distraction. Mr McLoed had left the room and told them he’d be back in an hour to dismiss them. Typically, that wasn’t how detentions went but he told them he had prior engagements.
"Shaes ma babe." Dean slurred, Steve just chuckled. "Look man, I don't really know you but I don't think you should be driving in this state, my motel room is a five minute walk from here, stay."
He wrapped an arm around Castiel so the fallen angel was pressed against his side and he put his head on Castiel's while drifting off to sleep.
"Finally!" Sam rolled his eyes calling after him.
"Inside. Come inside me." He says, barely coherent, still riding out the aftershocks.
It had said no to many things in his life, including happiness, love and sorrow. It made him feel like he was strong and stoic but sometimes all but human. He needed to be strong for his family.
The body of a scorched, decapitated wendigo lay a few feet away from a pool of blood, Deans blood.
Once they had finally arrived Jack greeted them happily and asked about the hunt, to which Sam filled him in on.
He then wrote it down in the email, well not in detail, followed by,
“Yeah?” Chuck pondered carefully before replying with an amused look on his face. “You and what army?” He replied knowing full well it was an overused line, he just loved the cliques.
"Dean please." He begged as the pull was stronger now. Dean was going to die and there was nothing he could do.
He decides to dial it, it was probably someone asking for help, maybe a hunt, Dean could have lost his phone. Many thoughts raced through Sam's head but he had never expected to hear the voice of the formally dead angel.
"Their hearts were ripped from their chests! With force, no human could have done that." Sam interjected, they were hunters and if this looked supernatural they needed to at least snoop around. "There is a bar very close to where the murders happened, you guys go there and I'll interview the family and friends."
Dean got up and make his way to Cas. "What did you do?" He questioned cautiously.
In a flash they were gone.
"WHat doEs it look
There is none, as Castiel nods frevently.
Castiel finally nodded and Dean loosened his grip. The hunter pulled at his trenchcoat. "Take it off man, get more comfortable."
He opens Cas up a bit and when he is happy with his work adds a second finger.
Suddenly, Dean realized what an idiot he had been, the deal, drunk Cas and now this.
Figures.
All he could think about was Cas.
They both moan as their dicks rub against each other and the pre-cum acts as a temporary lubricant.
He wanted nothing more than to go back in time and grab Castiel and never let go, The Empty be dammed. “Jesus fuck-Cas.” He exclaimed for reasons he couldn't explain. “Fucking Christ shit.” His mouth now overflowing with a litany of swear words, was he going through the five stages of grief already? “No no no come back come back no please.” He started begging. Holy shit he was! His phone started ringing again and this time he picked it up and smashed it against the floor repeatedly until his hand bled from the shards of broken glass from his phone screen. “Fuck!” He swore again and stared at his bloodied hand. It’s ok Cas will fix him up...No wait, that’s not right. Cas is gone. Gone because of him, his fault, he killed Cas. Cas is gone and he is never coming back all because he had to go and fuck with Billie. Fucking Cas that self-sacrificing son of a bitch he left, he left and now I’m alone.
He pressed their foreheads together, they kept eye contact as Dean pounded into him, unrelenting.
Dean huffed. "Don't." He blocked the doorway with his body so Castiel couldn't get past.
“Now, whoever our little Banksy may be, own up by the end of the day and we won’t press criminal charges. Dismissed.” He said with a wave of his hand and the students left row by row.
Castiel gulped, he hadn't meant for Dean to see.
The big fight
"Sammy where the hell did you get the bone?" Sam shrugged. "Broke into the morgue and stole a leg bone off one of the victims. I used the GPS on your phone to track you." He said like it was an everyday occurrence. But in their line of work they had to do freaky shit like this.
"Give me one good reason." He felt Dean grab his face and smash their mouths together in a hot, demanding kiss.
“Ummm, just that it’s designed to hit everyone with vampire blood darts.”
Castiel pushed herself up and it took all of her strength to even raise himself up to a sitting position. She rested against his wooden headboard, finding new bumps scrapes and bruises with each new movement. Her mouth was painfully dry and a quick perusal of the room told her they had left her no water or food. It also revealed her Step Father sitting in the darkened corner of the room glaring at her. She couldn't help her reaction and startled at his presence as if he had just appeared there.
"We need to get that splinted," He said, instead of any of the conflicting thoughts that were now crashing around his head.
Castiel surged forward to kiss the man he loved above all others. Bare feet rubbed against bare feet as they sunk into the wet sand. A light chill breeze ruffled their clothes and hair bringing the smell of salt and fish and ozone.
"You can hang your towel here," Cas pointed out a bent nail in the rickety looked lamp pot that was attached to the dock. Dean, hung the threadbare beach towel, it's design lost to countless washings, where he was told.
"My lord-"
Dean had never been in a high speed car chase before, but he was certain that they were not usually performed while driving backwards.
Cas gave them all a smile. “It’s good to see you all again.”
"Zachariah," she said, finding that speaking was hard through a swollen lip and a dry mouth.
“Go get Claire for me, I need more plates!” She caled after him as he left.
Cas nodded and exited the car.
They were on a secluded beach below some sandy cliffs about fifty feet high, far down the beach to his right a couple were walking trailed by a dog that was as soaked as Castiel felt. Much further down there were kites flying in the afternoon breeze. The other way was spotted with a few gaggles of children. The sky was almost overcast, punctuated with spot of light blue sky. The temperature was perfectly mild with a warm breeze. Dean was in a tee and his soaking rolled up jeans sunglasses on top of his head, and he was holding a beer in one hand and looked even more freckled than normal. He was still staring at him.
He rushed Dean, heading right, then switching to his left side at the last moment. Obviously Dean wasn't expecting the fake, cause he got by and he took his shot, using his jumping skills to make a layup. The ball bounced in without much grace. But it went in.
“Cool, sorry i’m not really free today. But you’re free to stick around…” Dean said, hoping he wasn’t just going to leave as soon as he got there.
"Don't overstep your bounds, Castiel," Zachariah warned.
Cas shifted his feet in the warm sand, feeling the sensation of the grains that tickled the skin and seemed to wiggle up between his toes. Without his coat he could feel the breeze from the ocean sweep up through his sleeves. Looking at Dean's exposed forearms he unbuttoned the shirtsleeves and rolled each one up to his elbows.
Dean sat there in stunned silence, then decided he had known. He'd known that for a long time.
The air was bitter cold. Every stray breeze hit Castiel's skin like tiny daggers, and he could feel his hair freezing to his ears. The man's jeans were stiff with ice and mud and kept chafing at his ankle and leg, but there was nothing he could do but keep them moving and upright. Several times he stepped on something that must have been sharp, but his numb feet could barely tell.
"Cause Sammy's a dumbass," Dean said, giving his brother a face.
"Dean," he said his name with reverence. Nodding he began to turn and moved into the thickening fog.
“I thought we were friends!”
"It's uh, Sunday." Dean made his own, oh.
"Can I ask who you are, sir?"
“Didn’t think you’d apply, son,” Rufus didn’t even look up from his computer screen as Dean placed the application papers in his inbox.
"Is that why you are always so at odds?"
His neutral expression turned murderous. "Name's Abel. What do you want."
Don Quixote startled out of the focused state he was in at the sudden breach of silence.
Sam visibly relaxed and made his way up the stairs without a sound. Cas spent the rest of the night wondering whether to tell Dean what he had seen.
"It is a long story." Dean stalled, looking straight ahead into the trees.
He jumped when someone touched his arm, letting out a sigh a relief when he turned to find Anna at his shoulder. "You alright, Winchester? You look a little lost."
"What?"
"Crowley, look at me. I am a servant in my own home. I cannot even get out of the manor, let alone to the palace."
Gathering his wits, he knew they couldn't just sit there in the cold staring, they would both die. He managed to get himself to his feet, though he had to crouch for a minute to steady himself. When he finally got himself to a standing position he could just make out the lights from his house, but that was now at least three miles up stream. There was no way he could haul this dying man that far. If he was where he thought he was, then there was another cabin behind the stand of trees up the hill. It wasn't lit, so the owners probably weren't there, but a house was a house. He would worry about getting inside when he got them there.
Castiel turned to him, letting his hand cover Dean’s "I understand Dean. He ruined my families lives as well. You have the right to be angry."
Cas frowned. “Well, he didn't really have much time to respond before the Empty took me. I barely had time to push him out of the way.”
Sancho Panza, ever looking out for the insane Don Quixote had done the only thing he could wrestling the wheel from his grip and pushing the wheel away from himself  just in time to not run straight into the turbine, just glancing the passenger side. The side mirror detached and Don Quixote let up on gas a bit letting them hit the next towering giant with enough deceleration not to kill them. If only just.
