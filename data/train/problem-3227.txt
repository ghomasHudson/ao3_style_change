Castiel helped his brother up, despite him trying to push away. "Wait... Dean, why didn't you heal him all the way?" That's why Gabriel was attempting to be on his own, Castiel was digging into several severe wounds. "Sorry, Gabriel..."
"Yeah... uh, we'll tell you if it ever comes to that." Dean added, side-glancing at Sam, who looked very confused. In Dean's eyes, it seemed like whatever left his little brother's mouth about soulmates didn't sound like something he'd say. "A-And like Sam said, we hope it never happens."
"Wait," Castiel sat up in his seat, looking between the archangels. "Is it just us being your vessels that's the problem? That's what would set the apocalypse off?" He was confused, very confused.
Honestly, Gabriel hadn't expected to be bombarded with angry questions thirty minutes into his time alone. Especially when it turned out to be a very angry Dean.
Meg crossed her arms. "We're dealing with demons, three people is enough, don't you think?" Sam snorted and rolled his eyes. "What's so funny, Green Giant? Just because you've got the body and height of a god doesn't mean shit. Three people is enough."
"Hey, Cassie," Gabriel called for his little brother. Castiel stopped straightening his tie and turned around. "Uhh... I called Sam and he's going to be helping us out with this one."
"The barn, he's at the victim's barn." Dean opened his eyes again and watched Gabriel tighten his grip on the wheel. "I don't know anything else, but I have a feeling on whose got him..." There was anger behind his green eyes.
Castiel pressed his lips into a thin line. A previous conversation with Dean about someone like this clouded over his thoughts. "That doesn't tell me who you are or why I'm here." At this moment, he was stalling. "Background doesn't tell me shit on who you are."
The door was opened further, allowing the other hunter in. Meg's eyes widened when she met Sam's intimidating gaze, or at least it seemed like that to her. So, she remained standing and waited for an introduction.
The next stage of the bond is more complex. The more time the angel spends with their human, the more their grace spreads through the human's soul. Soon enough, the angel begins to feel pain that the human feels, and occasionally strong emotions. Strangely, Sam is sure that this is his and Gabriel's bond.
Once again, the brothers were silent next to one another. Castiel looked as if he wanted to say something, but didn't. The only words that had left his mouth were about the diner and its location. Well, up until they reached the door.
stop being a bitch around him, got it?" When the hunter didn't respond, Dean applied pressure to the place on his arm. "
"B-Because you would lose valuable information o-on demon plans!" Lisa managed to get out. "Keep me alive and I'll tell you everything!"
"I'd rather discuss this when Gabriel is here as well," Sam interrupted Dean's response in the making. Even though he had been the one to say it, Castiel could tell it wasn't his idea to bring Gabriel into the conversation. "It's late, you should get some sleep. You're going to want rest before this next discussion anyway."
"Good." Sam leaned back in his seat. Before he could start, Melony came over with their food and drinks. A hard glare was sent her way until she left them alone. "Now, I was in Hell when this situation took place..."
. Of all the times these so-called 'guardian angels' swooped in to save them was a time where him and Castiel were fine on their own? Bullshit.
Gabriel grumbled something under his breath and slammed the money owed. Sam followed him, a deep frown on his face. The so-called 'angel' looked a little upset with Gabriel, but who was the hunter to judge?
Dean and Castiel stayed at the diner for a little longer after their brothers left. (For one thing, the hunter had a meal to finish) This was a moment for Castiel to ask questions that he didn't want to ask around Gabriel or Sam... but mostly Sam.
Not a lot of information had been given. Dean suspected as much. Angels and demons working together most likely came with little trust, and it seemed as if the operation was currently being run by demons.
, pray. We're not going to save you from stupid shit, like getting drunk... which is what Sam did." He shot a glare to Gabriel, who scowled at the floor.
Finally, Gabriel nodded, muttering a 'yes sir' before being released from Dean's grip. He never liked the tone the archangel used with him, or the way he spoke when he was angry. It occasionally triggered a flashback to when his father would shout at him for doing something wrong and demand a counter, something to right to be done, or an apology to give.
Dean's eyes widened and his mouth parted for a few seconds, then he closed it and his face rested once more. "Because you two
Sam dropped to the floor, next to a still body on the ground. His hands were shaking, but they managed to rest without shaking on the body, right over the heart. There was no beat. There was no rising and falling chest. There was
Gabriel's grip on the wheel had just turned his knuckles white. He was upset on multiple levels involving this upcoming case. The demons have already proved to be the main cause of their problems, or more known as the upbringing of the new apocalypse... the death of him and Castiel. Wasn't Sam supposed to keep them on a leash or something?
Of course, he knew this had to do with the bond him and Sam shared. It seemed like ever since their bond moved up to the next stage, there was a collar and leash around his neck. If he made the wrong decision or spoke incorrectly, he felt a tug and wouldn't function until he felt guilty enough.
A cry of anger left Sam's lips. In his ears, he could hear people screaming, children crying and howls of pain from animals and people alike. But he didn't care. He didn't care about the 20,000 people who were suffering through their deaths. He didn't care that he'd have paperwork to fill out in Hell, or that Heaven would be crowded.
In the middle of the warehouse was a small circle of fire. Two angels stood outside of it, conversing quietly, while another sat in the circle silently. The conversation ceased when Adam and Dean approached the circle.
As Gabriel walked away, Castiel jogged over and grabbed the archangel's sleeve. "What the hell happened? Where's Gabriel going?" He watched Sam's face morph into something he didn't think it could again. Hurt. "Sam?"
"Ready to go, handsome?" Ryan asked with a wide grin, helping Gabriel down from his stool. The hunter was swaying a little, the final half-glass of whiskey moving to his limbs. "Easy, don't want to break the merchandise."
This time, Sam scowled. "There's a gate to Hell near this location." His gaze switched from the farm then back to the cattle. Castiel and Meg were approaching them once more. "And they have some news for us. An envelope in a language they don't understand." When Gabriel tilted his head, about to ask how he knew that, Sam pointed at one of his ears. "I'm a celestial being. I can hear from a far distance."
The blade pushed through the demon and dragged through her chest. Alex screamed, her eyes and mouth lighting up until she dropped dead.
Gabriel was nursing a mezcalita, a margarita, but the tequila was substituted with mezcal. Deep down, he knew that he should be at the motel, going over what happened... but
Meg backed down, nodding. "Alright. Just... let me know beforehand next time." She waved her hand and made her way out the door. "Be ready in a few hours to visit the farmer! I emailed you some info on him."
Sam frowned and gave Gabriel a slight annoyed glare. "It's Sam." The hunter shrugged, a grin remaining on his lips. "You said there's a demon problem that you need my help with?"
"No." Gabriel stepped away, leaning on a nearby wall to keep himself straight. "Go back Hell and find someone else to bother."
"Anyway..." Dean cleared his throat, slicing the tense silence to pieces. "Do you two have any questions? If not, I need to go up to Heaven to have a little chat with everyone... and Sam might need to head back downstairs."
There was a lot of information involving the 'guardian angel' business, but the brothers wanted to stop here. This was what they could start with, and the obstacles appearing later on could wait.
Several cuts and bruises remained when Dean removed his hand from the hunter's body. He stood up and walked to the other side of the room while Gabriel woke up, taking in deep breaths to not freak out too badly.
There was a sigh of relief from Castiel. "Thank God." He didn't see Sam's flinch, too focused on the fact his brother's almost-killer was dead. "Thank you, Sam. But..." there was more. "You wanted to ignore him, yet you helped him." He tilted his head, narrowing his eyes once more. "Why?"
Gabriel glanced to his side. "Who?" He pressed onto the gas pedal harder, despite Dahlia's engine roaring in warning on how much gas he was using and how her engine couldn't take much more pressure. "Demon?"
"Wait!" Lisa stood up as well, backing away from Dean as much as she could. "Y-You said you wouldn't kill me if I gave you information!"
Dean hummed. "Demon. One of Sam's old followers." Wrong choice of words, because a scowl made its way onto the hunter's face. "Key word in that sentence is
"Well you're doing a shit job," Gabriel finally said. When his point came across (despite the guilt slowly killing the anger inside his veins), the hunter stormed past Sam, bumping harshly into his shoulder. "Don't you
"Coffee, black, and the classic eggs benedict." Castiel pushed his menu to the front. He always ordered that at a diner.
He used 'agree' and not 'like'. Gabriel was now confused, and slightly intrigued. "Okay... and 'saving' me meant killing multiple demons who wanted to? Or torturing them to near death to scare other demons?" He watched Sam's face morph into one of slight anger and his jaw clench. Touchy. "That seems a bit excessive, don't you think?"
The smallest comment could make him snap. And with the bond they had, Dean wasn't so sure what would happen afterward.
He was dropped right after. Gabriel stormed over to Dean, suddenly having the boldness to grab the archangel's hand and lead him outside. "Get in the car, and shut up." An alarm in his head was going off. When Dean opened his mouth, a hand clapped over it. "I said,
Questions began to cloud over the reason why Dean was in the warehouse. When did Lisa begin to betray him? Why was she going against his orders? Did she ever truly mean she was there for him?
"Dammit, Cas..." Dean crouched down in front of the hunter, placing two fingers on his forehead. The cuts and bruises left on Castiel's body slowly faded, followed by the hunter waking up. "Oh thank... thank goodness."
Ian had been so confident earlier in the morning, bright and happy about the date. Even when they passed by to leave the motel, Ian was polite and acknowledged his existence. In the car, however, he was quiet and kept to himself. Castiel noticed his fidgeting and nervousness when he would talk.
Gabriel had a minor understanding of what Castiel wanted. Throughout the years, he watched his little brother go to school and come home beaming, spilling what he had learned to Gabriel. It made him smile that at least Castiel knew he could focus on something else. As far as Gabriel knew, he himself was a lost cause, no hope in a normal life for him.
So when a tall man came up to him at the bar to stop him from drinking too much, and Gabriel asked what he was, the man answered his guardian angel... the hunter had never laughed so hard in his life.
Castiel lifted himself off the bed, grabbing his phone on the way up. Instead of praying, because that was for emergencies only, he texted Dean about the situation. About his need for answers. His request was to be met at the 24 hour diner down the road from the motel, easy to walk to. (Gabriel would hear the car's engine)
Castiel shrugged. "Would you rather have told the truth?" He glanced at Sam, who looked a little upset at the matter. "And you two know what that means right? Acting like a couple and
The supposed soothing words didn't last long. A difficult hunt involving werewolves on some sort of steroids left Castiel with a serious concussion, and Gabriel in the hands of a pack leader... a pack leader with black eyes. A demon.
The older Novak felt like shit when he woke up. His sides hurt like hell and his head pounded like someone was repeatedly smashing a brick against it. Oh well, he had some advil on the nightstand, and it would have to do.
A glare was sent his way, but his expression fell to rest when Sam appeared in the middle of the room. There was even a sigh of relief that left his lips when the archangel turned to look at him. "Just in time, Samantha."
Gabriel was the first to see it. Castiel at school, their father on a hunt... he was watching TV when someone slid a letter through the door's crack.
There was a long intake of breath, it sounded shaky. "Very well..." Sam held back many words that could have followed and obeyed the hunter's wishes. He disappeared with a flap of his wings, leaving Gabriel on his own.
A few minutes ago, Gabriel asked the man, who's name was Ryan, when he got off work. Ryan had replied five minutes, and that was five minutes ago.
Castiel was huddled against a wall, holding his head in one hand, and attempting to use his phone in the other. But the words were too blurry, his head pounded hard until he tossed the phone away from him. '
"W-Wait, 'demon'?" Gabriel looked back and forth between the two. He was beginning to sober up, just a little. "Sam..."
A light burst above the angel. Sparks from the outburst fell like a waterfall down to the fire, somehow making the fire crackle and pop. Lisa flinched.
The demons nodded, rushing over to Alex's body and dragging her away. Both wanted to get out of the room as soon as possible, noting that their boss was angry and with a simple snap of his fingers could kill them.
The youngest archangel averted his gaze. This would upset Dean greatly. "There are angels... angels grouping with demons. They... their plan is to bring the apocalypse on." He looked up at Dean, whose face was switching to minor anger. "There's an angel surrounded in holy fire down on Earth, surrounded by some others who're making sure she doesn't get out."
The hunter said nothing. He simply stared at the archangel coldly. Internally, he was thankful and wanted to say so. In fact, he was currently having an internal battle on whether to swallow up his pride and say 'thank you' or be stubborn and change the subject.
The golden blade was thrown over the fire, landing in Lisa's chest before she could catch it. Her black(?) eyes lit up as did her mouth as she screamed. Her body fell back into the flames, slowly disintegrating into ashes.
"Can you tell me any more about our bond?" Castiel set his coffee down and placed a fist under his chin. "I mean... is it really just you're here to protect me? That's all?"
The bartender raised his hands in the air. "Woah- hey, buddy. I haven't seen anyone with that description."
Gabriel took in a deep breath, the exhale coming out more shakier than he wanted. He just needed to rip off the bandage. Just rip it off. "Why did you save me if you don't like me? And don't answer with the whole 'apocalypse' business, because Dean just could've done it without our bond
Gabriel stared at the ground with a frown. "I don't... I never said that." Sam has never visited him either, just the occasional text telling him to not do anything stupid, or don't go wherever he was going. And by occasional... two texts.
"There's a diner across the street. It's within walking distance... how about we go there?" His suggestion made Gabriel's eyebrow quirk up. Had they eaten so close? Maybe that's why he didn't know. He could hear Dahlia's engine a mile away, it would have been better for Castiel to walk.
Sam rolled his eyes. "More than one demon at work. Keep your complaining to a minimum or yourself." The crime scene gained his focus once more. There was something off to him about what was in front of him. "This... all of this was done for attention."
One of the demons next to his throne, a blonde by the name of Jessica, took the paper from his hands, scanning it. "There are many names here who have been waiting for weeks." She shrunk a little when Sam turned to give her a bitch-face. "We could always do it the way we did before you... came back."
"Okay. Sam, stop." He did. "Gabriel is a dick, okay? As much as I say you should forget what he said, you probably can't." Dean took a swig of his drink, trying to put his thought process together in the right words. "Instead of
The demon burst, blood covering a frightened and teary Castiel. But the hunter was ignored, at least by Sam.
going to fight." Gabriel rolled his whiskey eyes and looked away. "I'm serious, Gabriel. The reason we didn't tell you is because it ain't gonna happen. We're trying to protect you and Cas, and that would be giving you two a reason to ignore me and Sam, do crazy shit, then get yourself killed."
As soon as Dahlia's engine started up, her tires screeched and left marks on the asphalt ground. Dean regretted not putting on his seatbelt as soon as he stepped in. "I don't care if I'm interrupting your thought process, the hell is going on?" He looked to Gabriel's watch, the object that had caused this freakout session. "What does Castiel have to do with it being 5:30? Is he in danger?" While Gabriel had a protective-brother alarm going off, Dean was beginning to panic from a soul-to-grace point. "Gabriel, I swear to--"
The man hummed and pushed a key towards the brothers. "Room 118. How long will you be staying?" He placed his fist under his chin, drumming his fingers against the counter as he stared at Castiel.
The archangels relaxed (a little bit of anger still surrounded Sam's aura, but it wasn't too bad). "It's good you're willing to do this... well, even if you weren't, we'd still be around." Dean waved his hand, his grace poofing the bottles of beer out of existence- Sam only touched his once. "We won't always be by your side, so don't expect us to fall in line with you every time you two get into trouble." Him and Sam stood up, looking ready to leave. "Our numbers are already in your contacts, so if we do not answer a text or a call- and it's an
The brothers remained silent as they dressed and packed for the road. Castiel was thinking about what to say to Gabriel about meeting with Sam and Dean at the diner. Gabriel, on the other hand, was thinking about Dean and his little brother's secret meeting. Was this another one? Would he be playing some sort of third wheel? God, he hoped not.
The answer was, he wasn't. Castiel informed Gabriel that he was going to leave if he ever got accepted, not wanting to say goodbye to his family. But... there was a goodbye that took place, a hard and painful goodbye given to him by Chuck.
Before the archangel lay a finger on Gabriel, he took note of the injuries... how much the cost of his grace was for healing him. Several ribs bruised, a few of them cracked, his nose was broken, more than half his blood had left his body... Dean was surprised that Gabriel wasn't dead.
He knew exactly what that meant, and while a part of him was happy, hurt and the smallest bit of anger clouded over it. His little brother was leaving him. After so many years of taking care of him,
A sigh came from the phone. "Gabriel, come back to the motel. And bring Sam with you." Then he hung up.
"Now," Castiel straightened his body, looking between the angels with narrowed eyes. "Why are you here?"
Gabriel sighed and tossed his menu on top of Castiel's. "Hot chocolate with whipped cream and a short stack with strawberry syrup." He watched the waitress jot it down, continuously eyeing Sam. A surge of what he could only pinpoint as jealousy coursed through his veins... why?
Gabriel's mouth parted. "Castiel and I dying isn't news, Sam. You and Dean performing genocide. That is." Anger boiled through his veins. "Why the fuck didn't you tell us this?"
Every other hunt was the same before Sam and Dean arrived: Salt and burns, shapeshifters, wendigos, a woman in white, werewolves, vampires... the usual. The hunters were thankful for the lack of demonic problems and no sign of celestial beings, but it also left them feeling uneasy.
But what happened to their mother happened to Meg, and it broke Castiel completely. He made a promise to himself that he'd find the evil son of a bitch who killed her and kill it.
"Alright," Gabriel smacked his hand on the table and let out a long sigh. "What the hell are we doing here? And why were you with Castiel last night?"
"Unless you do something stupid like your brother," Dean sighed and looked at the hunter. "Then our bond will remain this way. And, no offence to you... but it would be better for it too." Castiel tilted his head. "Look- angel grace is one thing, but archangel grace soaring through your veins... it's a celestial beacon for trouble."
As a hunter, and someone who has mostly spent their life lying, Castiel felt like he should've seen all this coming. The first ten minutes- the
"Decisions, decisions... all of them wrong," Gabriel murmured to himself after tossing another fake FBI ID onto his bed. He was referring to the many IDs he had as well as what he had done after they arrived in Brownwood.
The brothers relaxed when they opened the door. "Meg," Castiel greeted. He opened the door wider, letting his friend in. Megan "Meg" Masters was a family friend. She had helped Gabriel out a lot in hunts, and a little bit with the entire Novak family during their childhood. "Please, come in."
,' Gabriel wanted to say. He has a very good understanding of how he affects Sam with his choice of words as well as actions. "Why didn't you tell Castiel and I that if we die, you and Sam will turn on each other and destroy the world?"
"You're leaving..." Gabriel's voice was almost brittle, but he couldn't break. He's never been able to, he wouldn't have himself do it. Castiel became interested in the floor. "When were you going to say something?"
There was a large intake of breath, but not from Sam. Dean gave his brother a sympathetic look, but it quickly turned to one of slight fear when he saw Sam's eyes burning red. Dammit, that comment should've been kept back.
Dean stood up from his place on the ground with a sigh. "Thank you for your cooperation." One of his hands reached for the inside of his jacket where his archangel blade rested.
Another punch interrupted a breathy laugh Gabriel had given. Several painful coughs replaced it... of course. '
Sighing, Sam took the blade out and wiped the blood onto his jeans. He snapped his fingers and two demons appeared, both feeling incredibly small when showing. "Take this out of my sight, show everyone else what happens when they disobey me."
"You're guilty of... something." Sam rubbed his temple with one of his hands, sighing loudly. James Hennebree. He squinted down at the paper. "Oh. Human trafficking, murdering those who defied you... fun stuff." Sighing again, the paper dropped to his thigh. "Obviously guilty. Send him to a cell."
His words stung... of course they did. Dean had promised this would be helpful, even if Gabriel was really stubborn. And even if the hunter had been intoxicated- his words were coming from deep within his soul, Sam knew that.
It sounded cruel on their part. What was so wrong with the fourth and fifth stage that got Dean's panties in a bunch?
Sam didn't care. As a celestial being, he didn't need anything remotely connected to what his vessel would need on its own. Neither did any of the demons, of course. Though there were some who had been on Earth long enough to appreciate light and air conditioning. Ugh.
"You know, it'd really be better if Gabriel is here too," Dean commented immediately. In his eyes, his brother and the hunter seriously needed to talk... and in a public place, it would tone down colorful insults. "This is about him after all, isn't it?"
Sam wanted to bang his head against a wall. The sheet of paper in his hand held many names and multiple reasons of their existence in Hell. It was one thing he enjoyed about the Cage was not having to 'judge' people coming into Hell.
Gabriel walked closer to Sam and looked down at the slaughtered cattle. "What makes you say that? This looks like any other mutilation. Just more... cattle dead and apparently demons."
Charlie and Kevin glanced at each other. "We found her around a couple of demons. They were discussing... going after the Novaks... killing them."
Then he took a seat next to the hunter. "Drinking isn't going to solve your problem with my brother." A long sigh escaped his lips. "What part of '
Sighing, Dean placed two fingers on Gabriel's forehead and closed his eyes. While the wounds healed, he caught wind of a memory that answered one of the biggest questions wandering around his mind.
The man shook his head, taking a seat next to the hunter. "Gabriel Novak, I really am an angel, specifically yours." Gabriel glared. "Your brother is about to call you. His guardian angel is with him right now."
...' Each punch, each taunt, each second that passed- Gabriel did something he hadn't tried to do in weeks. '
He wanted to stay for a few more minutes to grieve the loss of his friend, but he had to find Sam as soon as possible to warn him about what was coming.
Sam rubbed his chin and threw his head back onto his throne. "Those souls are going to have to wait to be judged." He stood up and checked his phone, looking at two messages. One from Gabriel and the other Dean. "I have business to attend to upstairs."
The screams of his mother, the cries of his baby brother, his dad telling him to take his brother outside as fast he could, and what followed the house's burn.
A glass bottle burst on the table next to them. An older man that had been drinking it used very colorful language as he stood up to save any more clothing from getting wet. The waitress who had
Castiel couldn't sleep. Despite his brother's stubborn personality, he was able to get the story out of him. Needless to say, Castiel was livid with Gabriel.
Just like the night before, their place of seating was in a secluded corner, though it was not away from everyone else due to the time of day. Sam didn't look like someone you would know as 'the Devil', he looked normal. A cup of coffee in hand and looking through the newspaper. Unfortunately, his calm and collected demeanor fell when the other three reached the booth.
". The man did not flinch, just offered a small bit of hand sanitizer, asking if he was alright. "I'm fine, thank you. I'll, uh... go set our things in our room, Cassie."
Dean inhaled sharply, glaring at the brunette angel in the circle. "Kevin. Charlie." The angels straightened. "Go upstairs with Adam and make sure everyone there is... on the right side."
!" He smacked his older brother's arm, both in embarrassment and minor frustration for being interrupted. "T-There is
"Five sounds good," Castiel finally said. He didn't even think about a demon hovering over the man, even thought that was
"...Yeah he's my... boyfriend." Gabriel tried to avoid cringing as he intertwined his fingers with Sam's. Believable. Surprisingly, however, the archangel didn't seem fazed by any of it. "I, uh, promise none of this will get in the way of the hunt."
His text was what left Castiel thinking danger would approach them soon. Gabriel being Gabriel, rolled his eyes and told him not to worry about it.
You will soon learn that Sam is VERY bipolar. Reminder: He's Satan and has been trapped in a cage for a LONG time and doesn't like humans.
There was three minutes of silence after Dean finished. The Novaks were processing the information, quite a lot of confusion about Gabriel's bond with Sam was their biggest reason. Then there was the fact two other stages took place, though no angel had ever gone that far.
The Novaks didn't need their guardian angels too often. They hadn't come across any monster that they couldn't handle, even the demons weren't too bad. In fact... demons were not much of a problem anymore for them. All they really had to deal with was the occasional crossroads demon that messed up a deal.
Gabriel disliked having bruised ribs. He could brush against the smallest thing and pain would shoot through his body. Castiel told him not to complain because the remaining pain was his own fault for saying those things.
The archangel frowned again at the prayer. This was the fourth time Gabriel had called for him... and why was that?
"You're a feisty one," the demon laughed as he finally stood in front of Castiel. "My name... My name is Tristen. And you're here to die."
Good thing is Gabriel is stubborn, that'll prove to be slightly useful... at least in ignoring Sam's terrifying demeanor when he's pissed off.
The explanation of the angels, who are actually archangels, meeting with the Shurleys took around thirty minutes. Dean had asked that questions must wait until the end, because it was enough only he was explaining it. His younger brother refused to speak, and Dean respected the 'why'.
Castiel's eyes widened and his mouth parted. He was proud that his brother was done holding his head high and decided to ask for help. But there was also the matter of conflict that could occur with Sam coming along their case. "Oh. I'm uh... nice to see you finally be willing to accept Sam's presence and help."
Dean tapped his finger against the table impatiently. Thirty minutes ago, he had texted Sam to meet him at the bar. Usually, his younger brother was quick to respond, being out of Hell and all. The amount of time that had passed was worrying...
A silence fell in the room. Gabriel wanted to intervene, but he somehow felt that Sam would be the one answering. Period.
Then, they stopped because something seemed to be wrong with the engine. Castiel offered to help (since he had been so graciously given knowledge on cars) and got out. As soon as he reached the hood of the car, Ian had stepped aside, muttering "
He noticed his little brother was still asleep. Strange for someone who would wake up at 5am everyday... the clock read 8:00. But after last night, Gabriel felt like he had no room to judge him.
"Dean," the first angel greeted. The vessel made the angel easy to recognize. Bright red hair, green eyes...
The room smelled like shit. Now, it wasn't that it smelled awful- which it actually did- it specifically smelled like shit. Castiel was 99% sure he was covered in some of it too. He only vomited once.
'Would it be wrong to punch a seriously injured person?' Castiel asked himself, watching Gabriel slowly make his way to one of the beds and wince as he made himself comfortable. As much as part of him screamed to punch his brother, Castiel decided against it. "You know, intoxicated people sometimes tell the truth." He put his index finger on his lips. "And accidents don't just happen accidentally, Gabriel."
The throne was blood-free when he slumped against it. His grace was quite useful in times as such, his followers wouldn't quite listen to him if he was covered in blood, they would stumble over their words which made working difficult.
"Sam..." Dean's voice was muffled, shut out in Sam's ears. "Sam, look at—" He was cut off when the knife was thrown across the room again, slicing Castiel's cheek. "Fuck. Cas, we need to leave."
"What're you waiting for?" Castiel hovered over the archangel and his brother. "Heal him! He's dying!" Why was he hesitating?
Sam didn't look at Gabriel, his cold stare pointed at Ryan. "Did you really think you'd get away with this, Ryan?" He grabbed the bartender's chin, glaring down at him. Ryan tried to look away, but Sam's grip tightened in an almost bruising way, keeping the bartender still. "I'm not stupid. I may have been in a cage for several centuries, but that doesn't mean I don't recognize every demon on sight." He spat out the word demon in a voice full of hatred, as if it was an insult just to say.
While Gabriel popped a few pills in his mouth, he noticed Castiel's phone was lighting up. He reached across to grab the phone, nearly dropping it when sharp pain shot through his side. It was a good thing he didn't drop it too, Castiel would've kicked his ass for going through his phone.
Castiel sighed loudly, nearly slamming his computer shut when he closed it. They needed a case, and everything newsworthy seemed humane. Nothing was out of the ordinary... it was all natural.
"--Gabriel's boyfriend. They, uh... met on one of the demon hunts," Castiel intervened before his older brother could finish. He ignored both the archangel and Gabriel's glares. Better than telling her they were working with Satan. "He's a good hunter, Meg."
High tension filled the air. Adam felt small when his older brother stood from the throne. "Where is the angel?" His answer was given when Adam grabbed his hand and flew them into a warehouse.
A full five minutes of silence followed after Dean finished. The hunters were preparing questions in their heads. The questions Castiel wished to ask were more... polite than the questions Gabriel had. He is, after all, a firm believer of the Lord and idea of angels. It would take Gabriel much longer to process the idea of such beings.
When the clock hit 8:10, Gabriel decided it was time to 'get up'. He slid off the bed, raising his arms to stretch as far as he could, then dropping one of his hands on Castiel's face. His little brother grunted and smacked Gabriel's hand away.
Gabriel, you should go talk to him. Now that your grace is bumping you two up to the second stage, you're going to need each other more. And you know what that involves using, Sam? Words."
"Demons." A grace voice interrupted. Castiel and Meg turned around, facing what looked to be a very angry Gabriel. Castiel dropped his gaze to the ground. This wasn't going to end well..."Demons, Meg."
"It's my job to keep you alive... and safe." Sam rubbed his scruff, sighing at the discomfort inching its way into his grace... or soul if he were human. "Just because I don't... agree with you doesn't mean I'm not going to save you."
He gave up on school quite a bit ago. Ignoring learning, he would have a few flings on the side with his fellow peers, but his focus on school was never right. Gabriel hadn't learned properly since that day in '83... His focus was forced on hunting and taking care of Castiel.
well on that." An annoyed sigh followed his ever-so sarcastic comment. "I don't know why I acted out like that, okay? I... I think it might have been my grace. I could feel
He slowly whipped his boys into shape, having Gabriel look after Castiel throughout the years. They would hunt monsters and save people. Gabriel told young Castiel when he discovered what their job was using the simplest words: "Saving people and hunting things, the family business".
The hunter rolled her eyes, bouncing on her toes as she stared at Castiel, not even replying to Gabriel's comment. "Who shit in his cheerios?" He did not answer, instead watched his brother enter the bathroom, catching the uneasiness in his expression. "Ugh, never mind. Don't tell me about his boy problems."
The next he did was smack Gabriel upside the head, enough to make the hunter's head pound. Dean was seething, lividness burning in his eyes.
How long would they be staying? This case could take awhile... "Do we pay upfront, or are we able to wait to pay?" Maybe they could come to an arrangement. "We, uh, don't know how long we'll be here, could we pay day by day?"
The archangel frowned. "I said nothing of the sort." His blade was out. "I said I'd keep you alive while you tell me everything. And you're done, correct?" Lisa turned his gaze to the ground, beginning to shake. "Goodbye, Lisa."
It made Gabriel feel uneasy. If Sam picked up the phone in a matter of seconds and sounded a little worried on the line, something was wrong. Or maybe the archangel was turning over a new leaf, but the hunter doubted that.
The archangel shifted in his seat, looking out the window for a moment. Castiel always seemed more worried about his brother than himself, so Dean hoped he wouldn't ask about the bond at all. It was a weird concept for him, and to Dean... the only reason he was protecting Castiel was to keep the battle between Heaven and Hell from happening. If Gabriel hadn't been so reckless, him and Sam wouldn't be on this road.
As soon as Mr Livingston left, the fake FBI agents went to work. Meg and Castiel traveled to the barn while Gabriel and Sam walked over to where the cattle had been mutilated.
The room was much too quiet for Dean's liking. Ever since he had told the angels about his truce with Sam, they had been off on their own. There were a few that stayed back, but mostly because it was their job to protect humans' Heavens and make sure everything was going right.
beings he's hated since the Beginning. 'Go back to Hell to find someone else to bother' 'Take your holy ass back up to Heaven- oh wait, you're not welcome there'?!" A light burst in the warehouse, the glass falling onto the hunters. "No wonder he's not answering you. You told him off, and he was
The demons raised their eyebrows at the command, but obeyed. Since their boss had come back from Earth, he'd been... off. They all suspected it had something to do with the Novaks, his older brother, and/or the angels and demons roaming to kill the people he protected. (One of the best things they thought of this was the slight softness he showed to them. Unless he was pissed off.)
Gabriel shook his head, dismissing the voices in his head. His whiskey eyes finally settled on Sam, who was watching him have a mental battle with his feelings. Ugh. "Thank... you..."
There were two men waiting in front of a motel room. Gabriel looked at the man next to his brother, narrowing his eyes. Was this another 'angel'? His little brother gave him a look that said 'don't even think about saying anything', so the older Novak shut his mouth.
Castiel shook his head. "Not entirely." His gaze snapped to Sam, who was tapping his fingers against the counter, almost impatiently. "This is about the demon and why you didn't save Gabriel from all those injuries."
"The hell does that mean?" Gabriel interrupted Dean. Castiel frowned at his older brother, sending him a glare that said: "Shut up and let him talk". "Sorry,
"Cassie, c'mon, I was drunk!" That would be the third time Gabriel told his little brother the blame was on the whiskey, and not on his conscience. "I didn't mean any of it. You could call it an accident."
There were several diners in the area, some close, and some far away. Gabriel almost opened the car door to Dahlia, his '69 Dodge Charger, before Castiel stopped him.
Sam jerked away from Castiel, fixing his kicked-puppy expression to one similar to a stone's. "I'll see you back at the motel." He walked away from the other hunters, waiting until he was behind the farmer's house before flying away.
Unfortunately, as soon as Sam was relaxed, his phone rang. His eyes rolled to the ceiling before shooting to the demons in the room, a signal to get out. When they were gone, he brought the phone to his ear. "What."
' on the other end. Then there was a stabbing pain in his chest, right above where his heart would be.
that they didn't just jump in bed!" His chest continued to rise and fall unsteadily, but his face was starting to become neutral again. "'S got to be at least five dates for him to do so.
Dean smiled. "Charlie." He looked at the other angel, nodding. "Kevin." The smile on his lips faltered when he looked past the holy fire. "Give me the gist, as quick as possible, please."
The so-called case was taking place in a small town called 'Brownwood' in Texas. Castiel sat in the passenger seat, looking through articles involving the problems taking place in the town. He mostly read to himself, deciding to wait to inform his older brother about the case.
Castiel knew his brother was an idiot, but this was becoming ridiculous. Where had these deep trust issues come from? Was it Sam being the biblical devil? Was it that before now, Gabriel had a clear mind on his ties to religious beliefs? Whatever it was... his older brother's issues were piling and nearly hitting one of their biggest 'supernatural' problems.
His face paled, and his grip on the wheel became loose. "If you say it's Tristen... then he's going to kill Castiel."
The dramatic pause gave Gabriel a chance to finish Castiel's sentence. "You're seeing the Ken doll that is your guardian angel." The younger Novak squinted and titled his head in confusion. "Dean-o texted you this morning about a 'diner from last night' and a time for meeting up. Do you guys need my blessing to date or something?"
The demon shivered at her boss' voice. If she had known about his wrath, she wouldn't have done anything. "S-Sir please... Y-You didn't..."
The bar was stuffy and crowded. Despite it being a Wednesday night, AKA a work night, most of the town seemed to be in the bar. It was kind of annoying, but they weren't the
He had been here before, he knew that much. The faded merlot walls, the few scattered cattle who had flies for company... well, the bloody hay bales were new. And by process of elimination as to where he's been since they arrived in Brownwood. He was chained to a chair in Jacob Livingston's farm.
"So, you're finally awake." Castiel turned his head to face the detached voice. He squinted, it was a poor attempt at seeing because it was dark, but he thought he'd at least try. "About time, I was ready to pour some water with ice in it. I heard it's quite the wake-up call."
Dean held his hands in the air. "Calm down, Gabriel. We wouldn't be around your ungrateful ass if it wasn't important." He let out a grunt when Castiel kicked the archangel's knee, silently telling him to be less rude. "A lot of information needs to be put out. The, uh, guardian angel stuff mostly. But first, Sam is going to talk about what happened to you, Gabriel."
Ah, there it was. Castiel wasn't expecting his brother to be so polite, and he had ignored the expression he wore when Meg came in. His fuse must be shortening again. Perfect.
Well, then there was Adam. The third archangel, and the youngest. Despite his questioning about why there wasn't going to be a fight with Sam, he stuck with Dean. He didn't want to be on his bad side, and that meant staying in Heaven.
Though it was a direct insult to his younger brother, Dean didn't get angry at Castiel. He was right... if Gabriel did pray- which was sort of doubtful... what the hell was Sam doing to ignore a prayer like that?
It wasn't until Gabriel had to find Castiel that they were able to see each other. He was happy to see his little brother, even under the circumstances of their missing father. And... Castiel had really settled. A girl named Meg was proud to be Castiel's girlfriend. And the younger Novak, multiple times, said that he'd go back to her after helping Gabriel with
When they pulled up to the motel, Sam was quick to exit the car, letting out a relieved sigh he didn't realize he was holding. Never again would he step into a tiny car like this- or he would probably end up breaking something... preferably the driver's bones. Even if he hated it, Gabriel wasn't someone he could harm, so Sam would settle with bitching to him about it, maybe adding a little threat to it.
It was stupid, really. After what Dean told him about Sam's grace situation, he should've learned by now to be careful with his wording. But Sam pissed him off and words were the alternative to breaking his fist when punching him (it happened before and Sam had refused to heal him for a week until Dean pushed him enough).
Castiel was about to respond, but several knocks from the door interrupted him. He sighed and walked over to the door, peeking out through a crack until he met blonde hair and brown eyes. "Meg."
' Gabriel frowned, jerking his elbow off Castiel's hand. "I know you're not joking, your jokes suck." A minor glare was shot his way. "Why the hell would we need to meet up with S- with those douchebag angels?"
"Wait." The shorter man sprinted to the other side of the bar and grabbed the bartender's attention by taking the poor man's shirt collar into his fists. "I need to know if there was ever a guy about my age in a black suit and trench coat here, maybe with someone else."
wanted, he told her: "Two beers from tap, surprise us." She left with a huff, telling the younger angel she was going to ask Dean for a good time. Not surprising. "Whatever you smell is from the demon who attacked Gabriel. She stepped out of line and harmed him, against my orders. A punishment was ensued."
When he arrived, Sam and Dean were already sitting down. The archangels sat at a booth in a secluded corner of the diner, very much away from anyone else. Castiel waved away the waitress who offered to seat him, ignoring her pouting lip and disappointed huff after his decline.
." The anger slowly faded when Dean put a hand on his shoulder. "But..." his voice had grown soft again, like he was never upset in the first place, and his eyes back to a calm hazel. "I've been asked to put my feelings of humanity aside, otherwise I'd be fighting a war that doesn't need to be fought."
The man next to Castiel gave Sam a funny look. "Why didn't you just fly here? We have wings for a reason, Sammy."
It was an old cotton factory, abandoned years ago when technology replaced the need for workers. There was a heavy smell of rust and dust, and if Dean were human, it would bother him greatly.
Gabriel was barely holding on when Dean arrived. His breathing was uneven and slow, his eyes remained closed, and his body still. Only the faint glow of Gabriel's soul showed Dean the hunter was still fighting... or at least his soul was.
"Brother," Adam interrupted the concentration thoughts in Dean's brain with a clear of his throat. "Um... there's several problems going on Earth that we should be worried about... that you and Sam should worry about."
Gabriel coughed up another splotch of blood when the demon's fist connected with his stomach. His head dropped again, the ringing in his ears returned, drowning out the demon's laugh.
Dean leaned back in the seat, his head hitting the back of the booth. "There's five stages to the guardian angel bond, but all angels usually end at the third stage. Stage One is what Castiel and I have: I protect you, and that's that. Nothing more. Stage Two is... it's what Gabriel and Sam have: Sam's grace has begun to seep into Gabriel's soul because he saved your ass twice."
. "Do you understand what will happen if you and Castiel die?" The hunter shook his head. The last explanation had been vague. "It will be Revelations all over again. The end of time. The difference is Dean and I will not be fighting each other. Humanity will be our target, and will soon cease to exist."
The archangel shook his head. "You two shouldn't worry about it, because it's not gonna happen." Dean looked at the Novaks with narrowed eyes, a serious expression covering his face. "Not on our watch. Not ever."
So far, the demon had endured multiple wounds from an angel blade, something that could harm both angels and demons. And healing wasn't much of an option for the damned either, not if Sam was around to prevent it.
The angel shut her mouth and lowered her head. Her cockiness and bravery dropped dramatically, both replaced with fear. It was expected of her, Lisa could never stand up to someone of higher status than her for less than five minutes.
threat speech Sam had gone through, Gabriel shrunk a little bit. Sam had been so awkward and uncomfortable at the bar and in the car. This Sam that sat in front of him was powerful and angry, his fuse snapped as soon as Castiel had mentioned the past. Matters were going to be proved as difficult if this Sam was to be around him.
happening between me and Dean!" Gabriel raised both his brows. "This is a meeting between me, you, Dean, and
"I-I don't see how it's possible, Dean." An uncomfortable amount of stress started to cloud over Sam's livid emotions. One of his eyes was beginning to twitch as well, showing Dean just how much this was affecting him. "I haven't been around him. Since this happened... since he said things about me and Heaven and--"
THERE ARE TWO MEGS. The one Cassie dated in college was the one from the first season and this one is from the LATER seasons.
Before his older brother could protest, several knocks echoed through the motel room. Castiel shut his mouth and reached for his gun, gesturing Gabriel to move away from the door and grab his own.
The last time they had met, Gabriel was drunk off his ass. Sam held him back from walking straight into a trap with a demon, who he had snapped back to Hell as soon as it happened.
"Yo! Demon boy!" Sam ground his teeth together at the nickname and refrained from punching Meg in the face. "Found a note that's in some weird language. Think you can read it?"
Sam didn't provide them with all the gory details, but it was enough for Castiel to push away his plate for a few minutes. Dean was also shocked, having known what such an instrument could do to a person, and the fact Sam went that far for someone he clearly disliked.
. "Where." His voice sounded calm on one end, but Sam kept the anger back so nothing burst around him.
Gabriel held back a snarky remark that was on the tip of his tongue and went inside. Castiel dropped his head apologetically and followed his brother, not waiting for the comment from Dean that his anger was not directed towards the younger hunter.
Castiel hummed in agreement. Archangel problems, boy problems... there wasn't really a difference in this situation. "Meg, why are you here? Seeing a friendly face is nice and all, but now isn't the best time."
"Well, it's just how Dad wanted it to be, okay? Now will you let me finish?" Gabriel shut his mouth, rolling his eyes. "Good. Third stage: the human soul and grace are connected at like... 60% and there's a time limit, meaning you can only be apart for seven days tops. And, uh, physical touch is needed at times-- it doesn't have to be kissing or anything sexually physical before you ask. That's usually where angels stop in terms of guardian angel bonding."
"Go," Dean interrupted sharply. He closed his eyes, waiting to hear the flap of his brother's wings before opening them again. They opened slowly, narrowing when the brunette angel met his eyes. "Lisa."
However, Castiel figured that Sam would snap more than inform. (And he noticed the hard flinch when Meg mentioned the word 'God') So, he cleared his throat, grabbing everyone's attention. "Sam... is an expert on demon activity. He's dealt with demons all throughout his life. It's better that he's with us."
His hand was smacked away. The shorter man in front of him looked just as angry as he had been. But why? "Jesus Christ! Can I not get a small break from you breathing down my neck?" Sam opened his mouth to speak, but shut it when Gabriel invaded his space, the hunter's finger jabbing into his chest. "Don't think I haven't noticed! I'm not blind! Oh, and news flash, Samantha: I don't need your help! You can take your holy ass back up to Heaven and..." Gabriel trailed off, tilting his head. "Oh, wait... that's right. I forgot. You're not welcome up there."
"He means that in the best way possible," Sam suddenly said. The words sent a wave of shock through the hunter's emotions. They weren't used to the ruler of Hell acting like this, it was weird. Did it have to do with him and Gabriel's bond? "The fourth and fifth bonds activate when you two die. It's Dean and I's job to protect you two, and dying is not us protecting you."
"Did you find a case?" Gabriel asked, rubbing a towel on his head. He had decided to take a nice, hot shower to get rid of a headache he received from his long night. Talk about a hangover. Castiel shook his head. "You're kidding."
"On that note," Sam cleared his throat before his brother could add anything. "You two have a hunt to finish. If you need anything of importance, call us." Then with the flap of wings, the archangels were gone.
A name of who had started the so-called 'revolution' was one Dean swore his younger brother had mentioned. Tristen. A demon who came up with the idea of killing Castiel and Gabriel to trigger the celestial beings into the war.
With that final threat, he was gone. The first visit, from his grace's pull, would be with Gabriel. He felt like Dean could wait just a few hours.
AND: Before you spill hate on a character, please be aware of the situation first! Read and wait to comment until you know who they really are!
"One room with two beds," Castiel told the man at the desk. Meg told them she'd be getting her own room so they didn't have to share with each other at all. His wallet was already out, knowing the place had rooms available. Only two other cars besides Dahlia had been parked out front.
to you about who's after me?" Gabriel was just as shocked as Dean. He knew damn well that Sam didn't like him, and this... this was very out of character.
Before Castiel could protest about his sleep schedule and his lack of patience on the matter, both archangels were gone. '
Sam snatched the envelope from Meg's hands. "Give me a moment." He opened the envelope then dropped it to read the note. "Enochian..." In discovering that it was written in the angelic language, Sam pulled Gabriel to the side and summarized the translation. This was not for Meg's ears. "A warning for us. Me, Dean, Castiel and yourself. Another apocalypse is brewing."
"Two coffees, black with sugar and a side of creamer." Dean was ordering for him and Sam, because his younger brother remained silent when the waitress looked at him. "And that'll be all," he squinted at her nametag. "Melony."
"So, let me get this straight," Castiel shut his mouth and allowed his brother to ask the first one. He hoped it wouldn't turn out to be incredibly offensive or rude. "Cassie and I are some special vessels of Heaven, who are actually you guys, but you don't want to be around us in that way. You're gonna 'protect' us instead?" Gabriel was very upset- no, he was
?" Alex cried out in pain as he inched the blade further, pleading for him to stop through murmurs. "
Obviously not. "If I thought it was excessive, I wouldn't have done it." Sam looked down at Gabriel, frowning. "You still piss me off, Gabriel Novak. I didn't heal you or 'save' you because I knew you'd heal. If you were on the verge of death, I would've done otherwise." His expression became thoughtful, and a tiny glare developed with it. "I'm also waiting for an apology."
Gabriel couldn't express how angry he was with the way his dad worded his opinion. It drove Castiel away... literally. Each time that Gabriel tried to contact him, his little brother didn't answer. And it was all Chuck's fault.
The man smiled widely. "Ian." He then leaned back in his chair, going to write down the names of who was staying. "And you are...?"
It wasn't a question. Gabriel averted his gaze from Sam, providing the archangel with a silent reply. He would never admit it out loud, but sometimes the life he lived provided him with unnecessary baggage. "Answer my question, Sam." He paused at the harshness in his tone, then added: "Please" politely.
A series of color profanities left Sam's lips, but not in a language Gabriel and Castiel could understand. "Maybe you should listen to the story before you make wild assumptions," Sam growled. His hazel eyes were slowly becoming a pale, glowing red. Dean smacked his younger brother's thigh, a silent demand to relax. The eyes returned to their normal color. "
"I have more questions," Castiel told Dean. The archangel gestured with his hand for him to continue. "It's about the bonds... mostly Sam and Gabriel's. I'm, uh, a little worried about what might happen with them." He took a long drink of his coffee and waited for Dean's response.
They needed something to do, and by 'they' I mean Gabriel. Ever since they met up with the archangels, his older brother didn't seem to be doing good. Bipolar was the right word to describe Gabriel, because his emotions were all over the place... constantly.
fighting." In his head, he saw this as a little exercise to them beginning a better... 'relationship'. "Just for this case, okay? Just this case."
Three glasses of whiskey and Gabriel was buzzed. He could make out everything that was happening around him, but his mind was beginning to slow.'Well, that didn't matter to him. What did matter, or who mattered in this case, was the cute blonde man in front of him.
A dark laugh erupted from Dean. "You got drunk, and he saved your ass from banging a demon." Castiel stared at his brother in slight shock. "The words you used... I wouldn't answer your prayers either. Just because you were under influence doesn't mean you're off the hook about it, you should be ashamed of yourself."
"Castiel Novak." He then waved to his later date and hurried to the room they had been given. He would need a little isolation before anything with the 'date' started.
Meg narrowed her eyes at Sam, looking him up and down. "How come I've never heard of him until now?" She turned to Gabriel. "Is he your boyfriend or something?"
Thoughts swarmed the younger brother's mind about it all. He could only guess that Gabriel was already blaming Sam for this. It was a ridiculous thought. The archangels were on
The archangel nodded, holding a hand out to help Castiel up. "I came as soon as you called." He looked around the room, gesturing to the damage of the motel room around them. "What happened? Where's your brother?"
Sam jabbed a thumb towards Gabriel. "Ask him, Dean," he grumbled in annoyance. He was too busy trying to pop his back, giving his wings a little freedom. "Can we just go inside." Despite the older Novak being the one he was supposed to protect, Sam already hated him. They just needed to explain their situation, then him and Dean would leave.
Dean looked at his brother with a quizzical expression. Earlier, Sam told him that he wasn't going to say anything about the bond, but here he was- promising that he was going to protect Gabriel. It was out of character.
"Because I know why Sam isn't answering his prayers," the archangel spat. The brothers flinched at his tone. It wasn't kind and worried like it was five minutes ago... Dean was clearly angry. "Sam wasn't too keen over the fact he'd be protecting a
Dean groaned, leaning back in his chair. He had been given the easy one to protect... Gabriel was going to be difficult with Sam. "I don't think you understand. Sam and I are going to be with you two whether you like it or not. Because you're our vessels, both Heaven and Hell are going to be on your asses."
The room was dark and held very little air. There were no vents, no air conditioners, nothing to provide any form of life with oxygen. Only an old and dim light gave the room an atmosphere, and even then... the confined space didn't seem at all habitable. It certainly didn't match all the other rooms in Hell either.
Castiel and Dean watched their brothers leave the diner. The younger Novak was worried what his brother would say to Sam, and what the archangel would do in response. Dean was worried for Gabriel as well. His younger brother wasn't doing too well with his back and forth emotions...
Sam stopped the drumming, linking his fingers together to refrain from continuing. "Did he tell you what happened?" The hunter narrowed his eyes. "I'll take that as a 'yes'." A long, tired sigh left Sam's lips. "Then you know why I didn't help him. An insult like that... it's enough to keep me away."
However, the demon tied to a chair in front of him didn't deserve such treatment. It had defied direct orders from Sam, and those were punishable by... well, punishment. Death, near death, demonic torture... all of those worked.
"You killed it," Dean corrected. "I heard what he said to you when I healed him, Sam." A scowl reached the younger brother's face. "Look, I get that he hurt you, but you can't--"
