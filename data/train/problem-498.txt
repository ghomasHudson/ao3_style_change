John hummed in agreement, "true. You'd just have to show me some danger and my trousers would come right off."
Sherlock groans, drool running past his lips. He teasingly presses a finger against John’s arsehole.
She smirks and gets off him, getting into her hands and knees. 'Show me how much you love it.' She purrs, presenting herself to him.
Sky sighs happily as she finishes the last couple bites, feeling more energized now that she’s eaten.
“Love it. Love feeling you inside me. Need it all the time.” She whimpers, getting wetter around him. “Want you to fuck me.” She whines, it’s hard to ride him since she’s so full.
George whimpers as he fucks Greg roughly and fucks himself on Mycroft's cock, getting close to coming.
"Thanks." She smiles a bit and blushes softy. "I have no idea what I could have done to deserve him. Not a clue. He's just so good to me and I don't deserve him." She frowns a bit and bites her lip.
Mycroft gasps softly and looks at him, his eyes filled with wonder. "I.. What? You.." He bites his lip and drops his eyes to Greg's lips. "C-Can I..?"
"Can we move back?" Rosie turns her questions to John now, putting him on the spot. "I...yes, we-we can move back ....home."
"N-No, I.." His eyes start to water, unable to find his safeword. He frantically looks around the room, finally locking eyes with Dean.
Mycroft moans and slips into substance easily for George. He tips his head back, exposing his neck. “Yours. Your good boy, Daddy..”
“Be a good boy and say please. We might make you into a mindless little fuck toy but you’ll still have manners.” Mycroft teases his hole, nudging it with his cock head.
Greg frowns a bit, not wanting to talk about his mother. "Yes, she is." His voice slipped into his work voice as he answered.
John smiles and steps back to Sherlock, kissing his cheek. “So now what should Sherlock do?” He asks Margaret.
"I want.. God, I want so much.. I need you inside me.. Please, George.. I need you.. Please.." He begs breathily and ruts against him.
He smiles softly and kisses his cheek. "Jean, Benny, and Michael are making breakfast. Oh Sherlock, that Jason guy from the club is here to see you." He smirks.
"To be fair he didn't want to become a mob boss. He wanted to be an accountant. He's a good man and he runs the mob very efficiently. Most of their illegal activity is almost legal.. The thing is, Greg, he doesn't know about you. He doesn't know you exist. You mother never told him that she got pregnant. So you have a choice to make. You can meet him or you leave it."
Collin moans loudly as he fucks Sherlock. "You were made for taking cock weren't you? You take it so well. Such a good boy. You like big cocks don't you? You're a size queen. John's cock is huge. You love his cock. You love how he fucks you hard and makes you come again and again. He's watching you. Watching you get fucked. Watching you come from my cock. Watching you get hard. Again." He growls and bites at his neck and back.
“It’s a good plan. We was thinking about getting together a little group to fuck Maggie. To worship her.” Crystal smiles.
Sherlock has to dodge a few children running around, nearly stepping on a few under his long legs. He walks through the yard like it’s a minefield and finally makes it inside after John.
Lydia blushes embarrassed. "Oh yeah I'm fine. Better now then before that's for sure." She hesitantly holds out her hand for a hand shake. "I'm Lydia."
“The pastor comes in this morning to open the church up and finds this woman kneeling in prayer. He tries to talk to her to ask her how she got in the locked church and when she doesn’t respond he goes to see and finds a pool of blood around her.” Greg leads Mycroft inside.
John wastes no time pulling his jumper and shirt off, to catch up with Sherlock’s bare chest, and moans at the sensation when he leans into Sherlock, and their skin touches. His hands begin to travel everywhere – all over Sherlock’s arms and down to his chest and ribs. He doesn’t know what he wants first, but he knows he just wants access to everything, to all parts of this man. Years of pent up fantasies flood his head, trying to play themselves out all at once. The sensation is overwhelming and John suddenly pulls away, a bit thrown by it all. He can't imagine how Sherlock is feeling, if this is his own reaction. “Sorry,” he says, a little embarrassed, running his hands over his face. “Sorry, it’s just… it’s
“I’ll give you so many beautiful smart babies.” Morna moans loudly. “And I’ll let you use any of my holes any time you want. Even my cock if you want it.” She whimpers, feeling his big cock deep inside her already but wanting more.
Greg moans and whimpers as Duke growls, trying to fuck himself on his cock. “God, with every fucking thrust you fill me up and hit my prostate.”
"No it's not. He has somethings he needs to work out for himself. We haven't given him a moments peace by himself in weeks. Just give him some time and he'll come back."
John clenches his jaw in frustration. How had things become such a mess? “Go on…” he manages to bite out.
"We're going to need three cradles, three of those bouncy things, three playmats, three million nappies..." John ran a hand through his hair, overwhelmed but enjoying himself. "And hopefully they won't mind sharing a room. We only have one extra room upstairs."
**Sleep will help him get better. Sherlock's doing fine. The broken ribs are hurting him but he seems alright other than that. Yes the flat is clean and cleared of any contraband I assume?--JW**
Sherlock nods. “It’s still within your allotted grieving period. As long as you and our pups are safe that’s all I care about. Besides being home will probably help you relax and feel more secure.”
He blushes a bit and nods. “Thank you.” He nods, always having been the one to get fancy things for others.
Eli smirks and snaps his hips into josh. “Mm John. If we thrust at the same time they’ll fuck themselves.”
Crystal smiles and lays with her, nuzzling her neck. “The last time? Oh no. I think we’ll be able to make him jealous a lot more.”
Mycroft bites his lip, thinking. "I liked what we did in the shower..." He murmurs. "Can... We do that again?" He hesitates. "Without pants?"
She moans and rocks with him. “You’re going to knock me up like Daddy said? You’re going to put more of your babies inside me?” She tips her head back, letting him get at her throat.
She blushes brighter and pulls her hips down more to get closer. She flattens her tongue and uses wide swipes over her clit as she pushes three fingers into her this time.
Sherlock nods, swallowing around the tightness in his throat. He knew they gave his father and Mrs. Hudson the best last years of their life they possibly could and that comforted him. But it was still too new, and after getting close to his parent the loss hurt.
"Don't let Viper scare you off. Her bite is worse than her bark." Sky hums. "You'd know all about my bite, babe." Viper smirks and Sky laughs.
"No. Shut up. I don't want to hear that shit. It's not your fault. She knew what she was doing. She did this. It was her decision and she needs to grow the fuck up."
"Daddy! Please!" He whimpers starting to feel close. He loves having Mycroft inside him. He loves feeling full and being fucked hard.
"Good. How about you sneak a smoke and then go back to talk to Sherlock when you feel better, okay?" She says softly knowing that Mycroft needs a little direction right now.
Lydia moans loudly and presses back against him. "That just means your cock is a special treat. Oh right there right there right there." She mewls and trembles.
“Sure.” He smiles and uncoils Petunia from his arm. “Hold your arms out like branches. There you go. That’s perfect.” He nods and lays Petunia over Danny’s outstretched arms.
John grins, noticing Sherlock's arousal. "Oh, it appears we may have another whore joining us. Isn't that right, Sherlock?"
He grazes his teeth over her nipple as he drinks mouthful after mouthful of milk from her. “Mm you’re so full it must have been painful.” He mumbles before switching to the other nipple and doing the same. He starts to fuck her faster but staying deep inside her.
John sighs. “I don’t know. I don’t know how he would take it, but I feel like I’m lying to him, not telling him the whole truth.”
“You’re so big. New you’d be big. You have a big cock walk. Fucking delicious.” Sherlock giggles, high on endorphins.
John blushes at Clark’s pick, his cock twitching with anticipation and excitement. “It feels brilliant.. fulfilling and so bloody good if it hits just right. I’ve had my most intense orgasms from anal stimulation alone.” He admits, blushing.
Pythia nods. “That’s right. Would you like to show your toys to Nathaniel and Luciel?” She asks, looking to the children.
Samuel smirks as he watches her drool, pushing his fingers back into her cunt. “You look so full, baby. Like he’s fucked babies inside you for months. So gorgeous and round. You look knocked up. You’re such a slut. I’m gone for a few hours and you pick out the biggest cock you can find to fuck your cunt.” Collin smirks as he watches them.
Greg frowns and tears up, finally nodding. “I just.. I need help. Like professional help I think. I umm.. I realized I’ve been cutting myself off from you guys. That things I loved to do before don’t. That I can barely get out of bed in the morning. That everything seems gray and I don’t know how to fix it. I’ve been here physically but I’m not mentally. I.. I think I inherited my mother’s depression..”
Greg smiles. “That’s good. I just want to know what I can do. It seems that anything I wish I can do, I do.” He hums.
"No. You don't have to be together all the time. You're allowed to break. Because we'll always be here to put you back together. I can promise you that."
She kisses his head before getting off him. She sits cross legged in front of him and looks at him. "Zack.."
"Then someone needs to take him down a peg." John sighs. "O-or twenty." Greg grumbles and see that Sherlock notices his stutter is back, Greg shrugs.
Sherlock nodded and shivered as his heat began to take effect. He managed to get up the stairs and lock himself into one of the bedrooms. Greg slept on the other sofa, which had a pull out bed. Three days later Sherlock’s heat was over and they were able to move on.
"Not on my watch." Sky follows the people who have the guns out, moving quicker than she has in weeks.
John holds his hips and thrusts up into him as he fuck himself on John. "Fuck fuck.. Yesss.. You feel so fucking good.."
"Wonderful. Anthea says hello as well. She's down stairs with Mrs. Hudson. Still working on that secret project of theirs." She smiles happily.
"He did want to say earlier because she was sitting close by and he didn't want her to read his thoughts about it. Then we all went upstairs and here we are now.." He shrugs. "He wants you to talk to her about it though. He says she doesn't listen to him about it."
"Mm such a gorgeous little slut for me. How would you like to be pink? Or red? Or maybe even some black and blue?" He gives the chain a gentle but sharp tug.
Mycroft doesn't really pay attention to what's going on. He can't stop thinking about Collin's lips and glances at him.
Sherlock bites his lip, not wanting to leave John’s side but knowing he’ll be safe since no other vampire can see him.
He looks at how Sherlock's holding Mycroft and gives his mate a satisfied nod. He's holding most of the pressure up just under his chin, no risk of crushing his windpipe. And probably no long-term damage to vocal cords. For once, the doctor in him doesn't care that he's witnessing another man in distress.
Heading to the kitchen, John gets a glass of water before returning to the bathroom door. He knocks and after a second, turns the handle to step through. "Here," he hands the glass over to Sherlock, "you sure you're alright?"
"Fuck. You're such a naughty slut with a dirty mouth." He growls and strokes him. "Come for Daddy. Get your come all over my chest." He strokes him and rubs against his prostate.
"You feel so good. You fill my arse so nicely. I should just keep you cuffed here for hours and use you to keep fucking myself." She moans as she starts to ride him slowly.
Sky nods. “Other times it was after a suicide attempt or something like that so I didn’t really have a choice.”
"This time?" John's brow came together in confusion as he listened to Sherlock, "this is the first time I've ever left."
"Harder, Daddy!" He blushes as he slips into subspace. He knows Sherlock likes it when he can put him into subspace.
“Oh yeah. Lots actually. Thinking about having a separate building just to store them all.” She hums and nods.
“It was. Blessed with holy water and the pin was a small syringe filled with holy water as well. Honestly I was a little shocked. Then again me just being a vampire threatened the life of her unborn child so she did what she had to do. I let her live. She was one of the more interesting humans I’ve ever met.” He hums softly, getting a bit lost in the memory.
He kneels beside her, rubbing her belly softly. “She’s ready to burst. This isn’t one of my breeding bitches. They never get this big.”
“Don’t be sorry. Makes me hard just thinking about it. I saw the way you two look at each other sometimes. I was wondering when it would happen.” Greg switches nipples as he adds a third finger.
Her face lights up. "Oh thank goodness! You have no idea how many times I told him to get his head out of his arse!" She giggles for the fist time in ages.
“Are you sure you’re going to be okay? This isn’t going to be easy pretending. And it’s going to be harder to stop.” She says softly.
John giggles and pulls out of Sherlock, his arse high in the air, and his face pressed into Sherlock’s chest. “Cutie pie.” He giggles.
Getting up John brushes himself off and heads inside. Smiling at his mother who was sitting at the kitchen table, on the phone with her mate.
He hums happily and lathers his hands, washing and massaging Michael's shoulders and back. "Mm so handsome.." Sky kisses Michael's neck and collarbone.
He starts to thrust a bit faster and pulls Sherlock's hair tighter. "Anyone in here can hear you moans like that. Like a slut for my cock. They're probably so hard listening to you being a good little whore. They probably want you to suck them off to. But you're mine. I'm the only one who gets to have you right now. You're mine." He growls.
“Really.” Mycroft beams. “Shall we go? I wouldn’t bother with many clothes, with the way John and Sherlock were planning it sounded like they wanted everyone to feed you over and over.” He chuckles.
"Oh.." Sherlock frowns a bit and gets up heading to the kitchen knowing John and Mycroft will follows him. Greg is working on heating up dinner.
"Poison!" Lydia comes running in with a vial. "He's been poisoned!" She fills a syringe and injects him.
She mewls and arches as he fills her, feeling him pump his big load deep into her. “If I wasn’t already pregnant I swear to god that would have knocked me up just now.”
Nigel paces out front of the camper like a caged animal and all of the others give him a wide space.
"I.. Sky can do this.. this thing where she puts us in one of our heads. You could fuck me with an actual cock and come inside me.." He blushes brightly.
“I can do that.” She blushes and kisses her back as she lays her down. She blushes brightly and slowly sinks down onto the cock, moaning loudly.
“I’m sure we’ll have plenty of practice.” Anthea nuzzles her. “We’ll be in touch soon.” She nods to her mother.
Mark smirks. “I figured you got a little tied up so I figured I’d head here.” He licks his lips, looking him over. “Glad to see I was right.”
She blushes and kisses his neck as she relaxes. She shivers and bites back a moan as she feels his cum start to leak out of her.
She smiles and laughs, hand lingering in Greg’s for a minute before pulling away. She hums happily as she eats.
John nods, and settles back, letting Sherlock comfort him through their bond. When they get back to his house, John has the driver stop down the street. With the car idling, John looks over at Sherlock and purses his lips. He knows Sherlock won't like what he's about to propose, but it's their best option.
‘Love it. So much. Don’t have to think. Just have to have a wet hole for them to fuck.’ She cries out as one of them pushes into her arse when it can’t get into her full cunt.
“He definitely is. I mean honestly, I’m not sure what possessed me to name him Sherlock. Could you imagine Sherlock ever doing this?” he huffs. “This dog is way more caring than he ever was.” He can’t help the bitter note in his voice.
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?" He sings getting lost in the song as he rubs Sherlock's back.
He presses down further on him, moaning as his cock hits the back of his throat. He swallows around him.
Sherlock feels tears start to fall and he bucks his hips. "John!" He moans loudly as he comes for a third time, this time it's a bit painful.
Greg smiles as he looks at Sherlock. "Thai it is." He hums. "Great. One thing I have to do first." Max walks over to the open grave and spits into it. "Much better." Max nods.
Mycroft frowns and doesn't bother telling anyone that he's leaving before hurrying to his car, nearly speeding home. He takes the steps two at a time up to their flat. "Greg?" He calls out into the flat, a slight panic in his voice.
Camille raises a brow before looking to Crystal. “What’s the truth, Darling?” She asks, knowing Mycroft is right but wanting to see who supports who.
Sky hums softly as she works on Mycroft's laptop. "Morning John." She hums as he comes into the sitting room.
Sky blushes and whimpers. "I-I want your fingers. Inside me. I want to feel them in side me. Please, Michael." She begs and moans his name.
She bites at his throat and neck, marking him. "Tell me how much you love my cock. Tell me how it feels to be fucked by your girlfriend."
He immediately starts thrusting, holding nothing back. ‘Best stay quiet. Wouldn’t want Nina walking in and seeing you like this.’
“It’s been a while. I’m Mycroft’s daughter, remember? I lived with Sherlock and John for a bit.” Sky smiles softly, knowing Mrs. Hudson has been having memory lapses as well as myriad of other health problems.
Sherlock steps into the kitchen and kisses John and Margaret’s cheeks. He sits down beside Margaret. “Is everything okay?” He asks, noticing their hands.
Mycroft smiles and continued to pull his tongue out and push it back it, each time his tongue going in her.
“I’m fine. I want it off.” Crystal takes off her shirt and tosses it to an empty chair as she sits on the bed in her bra and trousers, her cleavage fully exposed now.
He cuddles up against his chest. "My top.." He mumbles against him as he remembers his dancing top on.
“She?” He frowns, never having liked her since Mycroft told him about how she cheated on her husband with George’s. How her husband beat her and Greg. How Greg didn’t know George was his father until Sky introduced them.
Turk chuckles as he comes into view from the door way. "Mm, thought I'd bring my pregnant girlfriend some breakfast."
Molly came dressed up as Anna which made Rosie so happy. She made Molly sing with her for hours until Mrs. Hudson finally brought out the cake. (See included pictures of Rosie blowing out her candles and covered in cake as well as the spaghetti which she chose for dinner.)
Mycroft smiles and kisses Camille one last time. He picks her up and gently carries her into the bedroom, laying her on the bed and wrapping her up in a few blankets.
The god laughs and thrusts hard, moving the dildo in opposite timing to his own cock. “Little whore, being spread so wide. But you’re not little are you? You’re ginormous. A needy whore for more babies.” He growls.
“You did manage to get it yourself. It was just made available for you to choose.” Sherlock shrugs. “No I haven’t and I never plan to. I don’t want or need to know any of that.”
‘Pretty close. A half hour or so till I need to push maybe.’ Sky smiles tightly, feeling the familiar pressure start to build.
He thrusts back against his fingers, desperate for more. He kisses him back deeply, now dripping onto the bed.
The nurse nods to John, telling him that Sherlock should be alright from now on. As she leaves, Sherlock starts to wake, turning his head towards John slightly. “J-Jo..hn..” His voice is weak and raspy.
Collin explains to everyone the rules with Sky, mainly that they’re allowed to do whatever they want with her unless she says her safeword.
‘It’s alright. Soon enough. Just enjoy them being pups for now.’ She hums softly, missing carrying a litter.
Chloe whines and starts to fuck herself on his cock, each movement making a wet slick slapping sound of skin hitting skin.
"Not your usual case, and I can't pay well." John yawns then slings his arm over Sherlock's stomach. "Night, Sherlock..."
“Loads. I’ll show you the library after dinner. There are shelves and shelves full of books and things about healing.” Margaret smiles and nods. “I’m going to go clean up before getting Dominic and Leona for dinner. The kids and Pythia are in the living room if you want to get them.” She hums.
Sherlock nods. “Yes, I was then. That was one of the last times I actually drank in copious amounts. I.. I don’t know why I didn’t tell you. I didn’t want things to be awkward I suppose. I’m used to modifying my behavior in order to fit in when I want to. I always wanted to fit in with you.”
John reaches up to pull Sherlock close again and kisses him. “I’m never going to tire of doing this with you,” he sighs.
"I know. Soon, love. Soon you won't have to worry about this anymore. I promise." He holds him and rubs his back.
“Sherlock and John were with you. They’re banged up but okay. You.. You took the brunt of it. You had to have surgery.”
“Well that went well.” John smirks as Pete goes back inside. “Don’t you look well fucked.” He chuckles as he looks at Sherlock.
“Love it when you fuck me. Feels so nice and full. This is what I was always supposed to be. Be bent over taking cock.”
He smirks down at her. 'Fuck yes, gag on my fucking cock. I want you to squirt all over the fucking floor. Think you can do that for me?'
John nods and they both kiss her cheeks at the same time. “Come up to us when you’re ready.” He says softly. “I think you’ll like it.”
He moans and clenches around him as he rides him faster, making himself tighter. "Mm make me come again then you can come."
George goes inside the greenhouse, looking around. He sees her through the glass and goes to tap on the glass.
She smirks and gets off, moving onto her hands and knees. “Come on then, big boy. Mount me like a I’m a bitch in heat.” She purrs, wet cunt open and ready for him.
"Yes, Sir.." Turk mumbles softly, curling into him. Sky purrs softly as she sits in Jason's lap, making out with him.
She pulls him into a side hug as John finishes stitching her other side. 'I'm sorry. I'm so sorry..'
Michael is reduced to a pile of moans and groans, unable to respond. He simply pushes back against his cock, meeting him thrust for thrust. He tries his best to hold back his orgasm.
He smiles softly. **That sounds brilliant. I'm just waiting on Michael. He's trying on jeans.--Zack**
“No nightgown could cover his oversized arse,” Sherlock grumbles as he tries to get comfortable. “He was talking about you being unregistered.”
Leona nods and takes Luciel’s and Nathaniel’s hands. “Stay close now, I don’t want you getting lost.” She smiles.
“It stopped being fake for me weeks ago, John.” Sherlock blushes, angling his hips a bit so John can get better friction.
**Would you like me to come in, Gregory? My day has been rather... uneventful without your presence. --MH**
Pythia shakes her head. “They’ll be alive. But they will enjoy the taste of blood, it’ll be like... chocolate for us. Not necessary but lovely.” She explains.
“You always have a harder time coming when you’re not with me.” John smiles softly. “I loved it. You’re so gorgeous and the sounds you make.” He groans, getting hard.
"Anything you want, love." John lowers himself and lick a long strip on the underside of Sherlock's cock.
'He'll do anything. But he prefers to pound into his partners as they scream "yes, Daddy!" and beg for more. Last time he and John fooled around John was deliciously sore for three days.' She smirks. 'And you know how hard it is to make John sore.'
"221b, of course. He tried his tricks on John and I." Sherlock sighed. "Be quick. He might find himself jumping out the living room window to get away from us."
"I told you earlier that they went to a sex club. They're back at the hotel now." Sky hums, nearly carrying Veronica who's very drunk.
"Mm you come twice as much when your prostate is stimulated. It feels like you spilled gallons of cum inside me." Lydia mewls, pushing his cum back inside her. "He already comes more than a sample cup full. You must feel so fucking full." Bryan growls softly and presses on her belly. Lydia gasps and whimpers as more of his cum runs out of her.
"Right, so these are the rules for the night. During dinner, we can talk about any topic, you leaving, Moriarty, or the bloody football games I've been missing." John rolls his eyes and places the dishes on the table, then sits.
Greg chuckles. "I feel exactly the same. You were perfect, still are. I just mellowed things out a bit."
“Oh maybe you’re right. The Virgin thing makes more sense.” Pythia nods. “I think Min. He has that whole penis thing going on right? God of reproduction?”
"Mum..." he cries, stretching out a hand and sinking it into her hair. "I can't do this without him. I need him there for the birth. I shouldn't have gone today, we should have stayed home."
Collin looks back through the pictures. "Yup. So far we have the fatigues, bunny, corset, pirate, lingerie, and violin." He smirks. "Seven down five to go."
A nurse comes in with a dose of a sedative to calm the man and gives Sherlock a small smile. "Your husband is lucky to have you." She murmurs. "He'll probably be out all night while he... 'reboots', for lack of a better term..."
Rosie and I may or may not have taken a look at a few local shelters today at their selection of animals. One of the volunteers had a snake around her shoulders (nonvenomous and loves people) who Rosie and I got to pet. Rosie is still struggling a bit with her S sounds because of her new teeth so when she says snake it sounds like “Thnanke” it is adorable and I will send a video as well. We didn’t see any dogs that really struck our fancy yet but we’re keeping an eye out. Just in case.
"When my mind thinks I'm in life threatening danger it going into like.. Protection mode. My consciousness is pushed aside and the protection part takes over and gets rid of the threat. Sometimes using any means necessary.."
He removes the feather again. He takes the stick end of the feather toy and trails it down from Sherlock's collar bone to his navel giving him a different sensation.
"It's good. I think. Sky would tell me if something needed to be done." Mycroft says and follows Greg glacé over to Sky and Ivan. "Sky! He's royalty for God sakes!" Mycroft scolds. "He makes a better pet than ruler." Sky retorts as she opens the briefcase to make sure the full payment is there. She nods and closes the case, handing it to George who takes it to his office. "Вы мне понравилось, принося полную компенсацию." Sky hums and pets Ivan's hair, 'You've pleased me by bringing the full payment'. Ivan shudders and pushes his head into her hand appreciating the contact.
Sherlock stills, glad his back is facing John because he is blushing brightly and has tears in his eyes. “I think some of them are fused to my back muscles. It’s hard to have a full range of motion,” he explains quietly so John can’t hear his voice quiver.
“Then we’ll use the plasma I invented or animal blood.” Crystal nods. “We’ve done it before and we’ll do it again.”
"Right, hold on," John says while placing the phone down on the sink's counter. Leaning over the back of the toilet John feels the back of the tank and grins. "Got it!" He calls out as he peels it free.
Sherlock looks down at their hands. He squeezes John’s hand back. “Together. I wouldn’t want to do this with anyone else but you.” He whispers.
“Perhaps not ‘sunshine’, yeah? Doesn’t fit me.” He sits up and ruffles his hair. He looks over to the addict he was talking to the night before. “Oi, any news on our man?”
“Mm..” Margaret closes her eyes for a moment, listening to the moans and groans of the castle. “Underground garden.” She hums as she opens her eyes.
"That only leaves random strangers...or biological fathers." Sherlock replied. "The mother knew something...but the notes say they couldn't figure out what."
John lifts his wrist to his nose and inhales, wondering what it is that Sherlock's smelling. All he smells is skin, and home, and something
Meanwhile, Anthea works tirelessly to get the secure omega site open and completely encrypted. She works closely with some other colleagues as well as interviews as many omega’s and omega groups as she can.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” John says, suddenly feeling insecure. He wants nothing more than to crawl up on there and cuddle him properly, now that he is free to do so, but this is Sherlock. Unattainable Sherlock.
"God yes. Fuck the impregnator until he can't fucking walk. He'll be a fucking mess." He smirks, moaning when Carol takes him deeper. "Oh god.. feels so fucking good." He moans, looking up to meet Collin's eyes.
"You're going to fill me up with your cum, Daddy? Put your babies in me?" She pushes him down onto the couch and straddles him.
The Preist watches John, waiting for him to finish his prayer before speaking. “What are you doing here?” He asks, his tone soft and hushed.
Sherlock arches and moans as his cunt is filled, gasping. “Yes, sir!” He blushes as he starts to stretch himself.
Mycroft whimpers and arches against him. "I-It was brilliant.. Risky, but brilliant.. I told him about you all.. About how much of a good boy you want to be, Sherlock.. About how big Greg was.. About how hard John fucks me.."
John licks a his cunt and clit as he strokes his cock. “I know you can’t. I may have had Sky tweak your ovulation a bit.” Mycroft smirks.
John kisses him back. "Aw young love." Mrs. Hudson sighs and clasps her hands over her heart. John blushes brighter.
“John. John. I’m sorry. Let me get you a plaster.” Sherlock stammers, as he shakily gets off the bed and heads for the door.
"Yes, Daddy. Please, Daddy." She mewls, submitting to him. "I always want to have Daddy's babies inside me. After I have the I want to put more right back inside me, Daddy. As soon as they're born I want you to put more inside me. I can't live without carrying Daddy's babies." She babbles, knowing how much Mycroft gets turned on when she babbles.
Sabine smiled softly. "You've got a good heart, Annie." She murmured. "I don't deserve to have you as a daughter." She sighs, putting Selene back into her cot.
Sherlock goes back to sucking John’s neck. As John swears, he jumps and looses concentration. Sherlock’s fangs retract down from his gums. And into John’s neck. Sherlock scrambles away as soon as he realises and wipes at his fangs with his coat sleeve. “John?” He whispers.
Sherlock smiles, holding him close. “Mycroft said he would meet us at the hotel. I’ve texted him to bring toys for Jared.” Sherlock hums softly.
Sherlock collapses against John with a sigh. “T- take away.” He breaths, knowing that he shouldn’t be seeing Camille in her weakened state.
“You’re thinking too hard about it, John.” Mycroft chuckles softly. “If anything they're the ones in charge and they drag me along for the ride.”
"You'll face an inquiry at work about this." Mycroft worries. "Anthea's gathering paperwork in your defence. But I'm worried that my past may cost you your job." He takes a deep breath. "Your hand may be broken... I'm to blame for all of it."
“Of course.” Taylol scoops Mycroft up easily and lowers him into the water. “Wrap your legs around my waist and I’ll hold you until you’re comfortable.”
Lydia sets out the mats on the raised counter. She pushes back the tall chairs so Anthea can sit the plates down. Lydia climbs up onto the tall chair.
Thankfully for John, Indian food was not known for subtle scents. Curry half-drowned out the natural scents of the flat, making it tolerable for John to sit across the table from the Alpha.
Lydia soon comes back carrying a tray of toast and tea for Sherlock. John kisses Sherlock's hand and let's it go so he can eat.
Leona nods. “I’ll introduce Pythia to the twins. Nathaniel, Luciel.” She says, her voice travelling to them.
Trying not to smirk, John shifted in his seat and stared at Mycroft, wondering if the man had any idea how many times they'd had this conversation. With one flash of his eyes and a little effort of will, John could wipe the conversation clean from Mycroft's memory.
“I know. I’m sorry, sweetie. I.. I want you and Daddy to come back. I’ll talk to him, okay?” Sherlock rubs a hand over his face.
A few hours pass, Mycroft only moves to sit next to Sherlock's bed, his hand never leaving Sherlock's.
Sky blushes brightly and whimpers, having long soaked through her panties from listening to their thoughts from the loo.
Greg takes his hand. "Sherlock it's fine. Just breathe. It's going to be fine. I'm right here, hun.."
John frowns and shakes his head. "I'm fine. Just need a cup of tea and I'll be right as rain." John manages a weak smile.
Greg whimpers at the loss of friction. He strips the way Mycroft likes. Timely but slowly reveling his favorite areas. He strips until he's standing stark naked in front of Mycroft.
Only, once at the store, across from the butcher, he caved. The man, it seemed, was well aware of Sherlock and his habits and didn't hesitate in giving John a few bits and bobs.
"No, she left me after the last charity fight I went on. Did I not tell you? Aw man, we got a lot to catch up on."
“Mm the more you leak onto my shoe the more I’ll make you lick off.” He smirks, thrusting his cock down his throat.
John looks at Mycroft and then to the nurse with sad puppy dog eyes. "Oh of course, honey!" She smiles and pushes the beds together. "But if you think I believed that whole innocent lark of even a second than I am a better actor than you, dear." She pats his arm knowingly.
“Different things. My father sold me into sex slavery. I was bought and sold multiple times. Most of the trauma is from that. The dreams always ends up with me being out of control in some type of sexual situation where I’m not allowed to say no or I can’t say it.”
She blushes brightly and pulls him up for a kiss. "You feel so fucking good inside me." She whimpers.
Mycroft pulls him closer and kisses him again between cigarette drags, blowing them into Sherlock’s mouth as they kiss.
"Wine... bubble bath, crap telly. He's nesting. Honestly, for a genius, you're not always very bright. What else does he need to do, hang a neon sign over his head saying I'm going into heat soon, and would like to go home and be comforted by my Alpha because that's silly? Sherlock, very silly, they don't make those signs." Molly says, shooting her friend a scathing look over one of the dead Alphas.
"I want you to take me.. I need you to fuck me.. Oh god, Mikey, please!" He begs and grinds against him desperately.
Greg smiles and kisses her softly. “Then you’ll get whatever you wish for, Maggie. You deserve them all.”
“Yeah just put everything on the serving dishes.” Margaret waves her hand and all the serving dishes and things float out of the cupboards. She hums and the table settings go through the open door to the dining room, the table being set with her magic.
"Might have to invest in an actual camera soon." He comments as she turns the phone to show him the pictures of the pigeons. "Maybe for your birthday."
“He’s fine, I think. He just didn’t want to touch him so I could wash his cocoa moustache off.” Mycroft nodded. “Sherlock was the same when he was younger. He didn’t want anyone to touch him except mummy or daddy or me.”
"You need my cock, don't you? If you need it so much, take it." George grazes his teeth against Cecil's neck.
“Molly and Mrs. Hudson and I figured out he had a schedule while you were gone. Every day he’d have a different thing. He had a therapy day a day with me, a day with Molly, a day with Mrs. Hudson, a day for experiments or research.” Greg shrugs. “He stopped taking cases but he needed something to do with his energy. He helped me move and do stuff with my kids. He’s even watched them for me when I got called out on cases.”
When Mycroft had heard of the outbreak in London, he’d sent a team of his men to fetch Greg, John, and Sherlock. The helicopter returned a few days later with John and Mrs. Hudson instead.
“Getting out of what? Propositioning me?” Sherlock licks some sauce from his finger in a suggestive manner.
“Mm fine.” Nina still pouts. “I dunno why she’s so sleepy. We’d play for hours. Hiding and fighting the people who’d come after us. She’d never let them win so I didn’t think that was nice. She’d get really scared if they came close to winning.”
John slowly picks up the pace of his hand, letting out a small groan as Sky talks. ‘Ms. Cheyenne said he has a nice tight arse. No ones fucked him before. God though, I’d love to have him fuck my face before fucking his arse.’
“Yup.” He smiles and nods. “I have one of the larger horse breeding facilities in the country.” Sam smiles. “My husband and I co own some of the biggest clubs in England.” Carol smiles.
“Sire,” Sherlock breathes, “I can live off a pint a day. I don’t wish to get fat.” He says but gets up away and pours himself another drink.
Mycroft smirks and nips at his neck. "Mm, I think that's a lovely idea. I'm sure Daddy would be interested. You'll have to tell him your brilliant idea and ask everyone if they'd want to join us." He presses his hard cock against Sherlock's hip.
“You landed a date after being in hospital for a week. If that’s not game, I don’t know what is.” Sherlock shrugged. “And no one could ever replace you, John. I wouldn’t want them to. If one of us becomes too incapacitated for the work, then we’ll retire. Simple as that.”
Greg gets up a few minutes later. He sees Mycroft siting on the bed naked. "Good boy.." Greg goes to the drawer with the vibrators and opens it. He picks the white one with four different settings.
Jean smirks and helps Michael strip him. "Come here." He says to Sky and she goes to him. He kisses her deeply and starts to strip her as well.
He presses closer to her. "Before you, the police academy was all I had. I was afraid that I wasn't going to make it in, so I went to the bar to drink away my anxiety. I was always so afraid of everything. Of people finding out about me. But then I saw you. I saw you and I immediately felt like everything was going to be okay. That's why I sent over the drink and I'm still amazed that you actually came over. I'm so thankful that you did."
"You're so fucking handsome. Oh fuck yes. You feel so good. I love the way you feel over me. I love it. I love you." She moans and puts a knee between his legs so they can grind against each other better.
John smiles and lets out a half laugh. It’s like this dog knows him. When he looks into its eyes, it’s like it really understands him. Of course it can’t possibly. But god he wishes it were true. “Well he never did
John lays Sherlock back against the bed, pressing close. He slowly starts to kiss down the detective’s body. He starts with his neck, kissing and sucking gently. Leaving light little love bites in his wake.
‘Missed you, too.’ She nuzzles him. ‘I’ll come see you tonight. Just the two of us. We haven’t been together in ages.’
John makes a sound like he’s been punched in the gut and holds onto Sherlock tightly, shaking slightly.
“And I don’t want to die either.” John says softly. “I still feel like my reputation is to just fuck whoever is sent to me.”
“I’d have you for that and infinity after.” John blushes a bit, looking at Sherlock. “I love you. I want you with me. Always.”
"Exactly. So there are still two heads out there floating about." Sky nods. "Plus the finger prints have been burned off. What were these people doing that needed to be erased?" Molly frowns.
Sherlock hums, his body starting to scream for blood. “You are always so strong. And as far as I’ve heard from my Sire, you always have been. I wish I was as strong as you.” He whispers.
Without thinking about social expectations, or what would be considered proper, John strips and slips into the water while Sherlock is off getting the wine. He doesn't care when Sherlock enters the room and finds him mostly buried under a layer of bubbles, all he cares about is the relief the warm water has to offer.
“Shall we go home then?” He asks, knowing that if he proposed to Sherlock for real he’d do it in there home that they share.
James groans and starts to fuck her mouth, holding her head. 'God yes. Give it to me. Give it to me.' She moans in their heads.
She talks to the ducks telling them all about the park near her and how it's not as nice as this park because it lacks ducks. They watch the ducks until she gets bored and then she heads over to the playground once again.
"*Mais, maman ... le pauvre homme pleure.*" (“But mama, the poor man is crying.”) Marie looked sad. "*S'il vous plaît, ne pleurez pas, monsieur ... ici, Gilbert ne veut pas que vous soyez si triste.*" (“Please don't cry sir ... here Gilbert doesn't want you to be so sad.”) She escaped her mother's grip and pressed a soft toy rabbit into the crook of Mycroft's elbow. "*Il prendra soin de vous.*" She smiles, before running back to her mother. (“He will take care of you.”)
Camille points to the seats, for them to sit. “Where would I buy a new table? This one was older than you Sherlock. Where can I buy the same?” She asks.
'But what if I break? What if I can't be strong and they need someone?' He frowns a bit and covers her hand with his own.
“Mm god no.” John groans softly. “It certainly can’t suck you off and massage your prostate still you’re screaming either.”
John chuckles and holds him close. “Mm Mycroft is probably fucking him out there right now.” He kisses along Pete’s neck.
John gets a deck of cards from the gift shop in the hospital. He gets a sketch book and art things too. He heads up to Sherlock's room. "How are you doing, love?"
She kneels in front of him still holding him. "We'll get you all the help you need. Whatever you need. I know they all rely on you so much. I know that you feel like you have to be there every second for Sherlock because you're so afraid that he'll think you'll leave. I know that you feel like you need to keep Mycroft sane because he's so much. I know you feel like you have to be so totally honest with John because he's been lied to so many times and you don't think he could take anymore. They rely on you so much, Greg. It's it time to rely on them as well?"
He chuckles softly. “Ready to steer?” He asks and hands her the reigns, he’d control the speed since she was to little.
‘Get out! Lock the door! Barricade it! Don’t let them out!’ Sky yells in their heads. “The closest one.” She says, watching his body language.
John lays them on the bed and continues to kisses Sherlock's softly. Greg cuddles Mycroft as Sherlock relaxes against Mycroft's back.
"I've never flown before," Hank says, eying the small aircraft with suspicion. "When all this is over and Joann is better, I want to take her on the holiday she's always dreamed of."
Sherlock shakes his head, “no I’m taking you out. So you choose.” He says softly. “This is how... it’s been for so long.”
Mycroft keeps his arms around Camille, “Sire. I would just like to say that I love you too. And that if you ever need... someone to just hug or hold. I’m here for you, Sire.” He says softly.
"You mean because he didn't actually need a flatmate to begin with." John nods. He had suspected after seeing the money that Sherlock made consulting but he'd never said anything. "Just needed someone to keep him grounded is all."
“Good?” Sherlock goes to their bags. “Should I get you out a pair of pajamas so you can be more comfortable?”
"Alright... But we're going to talk after. Right? I'm... Fuck that one hurts...." John winces and grabs Sherlock's knee, squeezing hard. "Sherlock... Scent my stomach. Please?"
"Git. Don't you know good things come to those who wait?" John says. He pushes Sherlock back against the couch. John leans in and bites Sherlock's collar bone. He kisses and sucks it till little red marks start to bloom.
“Sorry. I’m fine.” Crystal laughs a bit embarrassed. “All the vendors are setting up and people should be arriving soon.”
"Alright but be it on your head when I kiss you before brushing my teeth," He informs him while crossing back over to Sherlock to plant a kiss on his lips.
“Mm I pity the other diners. I have the best date.” Greg smiles and kisses him once more before pulling back. “After you, gorgeous.”
"Sherlock would be an excellent father. I could tell by how he interacted with the lion earlier. Calm, excited, just a hint of fear."
“Sherlock says you’re an army doctor. Thank you for your service. There’s two bedrooms if you’ll need it.” Mrs. Hudson smiles.
“Should I take my top off and let you watch my tits bounce as you fuck me?” She mewls as she feels his cock slide back into her.
“All yours and John’s to enjoy.” Sherlock kisses her back. “Mm you said I can impregnate you again?” Sherlock asks, thinking.
'Of course. I think there's enough room for me under your desk. Or over it. I'm quite flexible as you know.' She smirks.
Tossing his mobile on the bed John strips out of his jeans and into sweats. He wasn't sure if the scan would be external or internal, but either way an elastic waistband would come in handy.
"He was furious.. B-But.. Only at first.. He told me he had started to notice that Lestrade was acting a bit strange around me.. I.. I think he knew.."
Congratulations on your promotion. It’s about time really. We’ll have a party when you get home to celebrate your promotion and homecoming.
“I want to close your eyes and imagine what your favorite sexual thing to do with Crystal is.” Maggie smiles.
John snuggles into Sherlock, happily sleeping next to the man, not bothered by his PTSD dreams for another sleep cycle. His thoughts are calm and concentrated.
"It's *fine*, Gregory. It's nice to eat a home cooked meal... most of my eating is done out, so this is really quite lovely."
"Mm I'll fuck you and then I'll suck you off some more, okay?" He sucks on his thighs. "Mm or I could make you come again with my mouth, fuck you and make you come, then suck you off again until you're screaming my name as you come." He smirks. "You decide."
Greg shakes his head. "Y-you not recognizing that you're cute only makes you cuter, hun." He smiles.
'Mm lets go in your head.' She kisses him and puts them in his head, catching Michael's eye and bringing him in as well.
She smiles and kisses him softly. "Mm you know ever since getting pregnant I'm just... Horny all the time. I can't help it. It feels so good. Everything feels so good." She mumbles against his lips.
John nods and smiles. “Why don’t you two head up to the kitchen and I’ll meet you there, when I’ve got some food for Sherlock.” He smiles as he heads off. “Oh Sherlock, have a wash before lunch, I don’t want to get poisoned down there.” He chuckles.
“Mm don’t rock back and forth. It’ll only make you more desperate because your stuck and it’ll pull on your mate. Slow circles side to side. You’ll get more friction around your knot and it’ll rub her pleasure spots better.” Darius smirks, showing him how it’s done.
“Mm brilliant idea, Daddy.” Sky purrs and pinches Violet’s nipple. Violet gasps and squirm, moaning breathily.
Greg smirks. "Yeah sure because I learned so well from mine.. I haven't even met Mycroft's parents yet.." He signs.
John growls and does just that. He fucks Sherlock while he pins his hands behind him. John takes his free hand and strokes Sherlock's cock.
John nods. “She makes all her babies whether they stay or not. Sometimes they find their way back. Sometimes they live out their life on earth.”
Zack hums and makes the next shot. Both teams are down to one cup. Mycroft hands the ball to Sherlock and smirks a bit. "Come on, Bee."
John chuckles and presses his face forward, swiping his tongue over the tight pucker, worming the tip in slightly and pulling back, encouraging the man to relax.
Sky gasps and whimpers, dripping wet around his cock. “How many should I push out this time? I have one from George, one from Cecil, one from Zack, two from Michael, two from you, and... And six from Daddy.” She whines and blushes brightly, whimpering as he hits her tender cervix.
Sherlock whimpers softly. "Would you.. Ah.. Would you be opposed to wearing your old uniform while we have sex? I.. Would very much like that.. C-Captain Watson.."
Cecil smiles softly, having calmed down since earlier. He answered, not wanting Violet to answer. "It's alright, dearie.."
He winces as Sherlock swears. He nods as he listens to him. "I know, Sherlock. We weren't excluding you or John that is not the point. I know that this is a huge decision! This is not an open and shut case. The discussion is far from over believe me." He says and rubs his temple.
His frown deepens. "Don't you dare. I love you, Sky, no matter what. Even if I never get to touch you, I love you."
She breathes hard and presses against him. "I think my pussy sucked up all your cum. You're like a fucking horse. Massive cock and buckets of cum. I can't believe none it coming out." She mewls and rubs her belly. "Maybe now would be a good time to tell you I stopped taking my pill. I haven't taken it in weeks. I'm probably so fertile right now just looking at you could knock me up. Not to mention the fire truck load of cum you just sprayed all over my womb and eggs."
Crystal giggles and smiles, kissing him. “Where do you think the Jack of all trades got started? One of my past names was Jacqueline.”
Sherlock smiles and leans against John as he starts to eat. “Thank you.” He pushes John’s legs open and sits in between them.
He kisses her back, smiling softly. 'We can go to the clinic, yeah? Get everything done there all proper and I can get inseminated there. I think I'd prefer that.'
He unties his tie and ties it around Sky's waist, pressing it against her wound. "I need you to hold this in place. Keep pressure on it. I need you to come with me."
“If you’d like.” Morna nuzzles him. “It’s a plug. To keep cum in. You can take it out if you’d like. That way I can take your cock.” She purrs.
'You have nothing to apologize for, love. They wouldn't mind even if they knew or found out.' She bites her lip. 'I told them about me this morning. They took it pretty well. They just wanted to understand.'
Mycroft scowls at him. "I can and will have you put away. And how on earth are you trying to help me?"
Mycroft growls, thrusting harder into her. "I'm her Daddy, which makes her mine. Her cunt and womb are mine. Everything she is is mine."
Magdala wraps her arms around his shoulder and holds him close. “We’ll figure something out. I promise.” She presses gently kisses to his face. “In the meantime we could practice?” She purrs softly, nuzzling him.
Violet moans loudly as he pushes into her, absolutely dripping around his cock. “Yes yes. Whatever you want.” She whimpers, doing as she’s told. “Fill her up, Daddy. I know you will. I want a nice little mouth full of your cum from her pussy. I want to lick your cum out of the same cunt you came out of. How does it feel? To be pounding into your Mummy? Is it different than when you fuck your baby girl?” Sky purrs, pushing more cum out for Violet.
John is all dressed up, ready to go out. Greg wants him to get out of the flat, so he’s arranged a ridiculous blind date, with a friend of a friend. John isn’t even slightly in the mood for it, particularly now that it’s raining. Nevertheless he has somehow managed to shave and get dressed, his sour mood hanging over him like one of the dark rain clouds outside. No one is going to want to date him. This is a terrible idea. As he walks down the stairs he can hear scratching and whimpering.
Sky sobs and holds onto him tightly. "I've never stopped. I tried. I tried to be alone. I can't. I can't do it. I've tired to stop. I can't. I'm so tired, Michael. I'm so so tired."
"Mine. All mine." He kisses him hard and pounds into him, hitting his prostate everything thrust and stroking his leaking cock.
"No it's not. Don't say it is when it isn't. I was wrong and I'm sorry." He wraps his arm around his waist.
She shakes her head. “That’s what he said. He said the bad men couldn’t see him so it was okay. That’s how he could sneak in to help me.”
Mycroft takes the coffee silently. He looks like a mess, wearing baggy sweat pants and an undershirt with just a jacket over it. His hair is mussed and his leg is shaking nervously.
"Very good. Already much better than this morning." She smiles and moves his blanket. She runs her pen along the bottom of his foot seeing if it tickles him.
"Can I get some help over here?" Cynthia calls out as she preforms cpr on a pregnant patient being pushed in by paramedics.
"Mm how does it feel? Knowing you knocked me up? Knowing I'm carrying your child?" She presses closer.
"Very good, John! But you've made one mistake. You assumed that I had a trigger to begin with. Tick toc goes the count down clock!" Ford smiles and laughs. John knows that look. He's seen it before on suicide bombers. John drops his gun and rushes to Mycroft tackling him to the ground as far away from Ford as possible. He holds Mycroft under him holding his head to John's chest as the house explodes around them.
I googled your weather, please go play in the rain for me. My body could use some refreshing rain for a change.
Lydia helps John out if the chair. He stands a little unsteady. "Careful. Your balance is off because of your ears." She signs.
Sherlock goes into his mind palace to organize the events of the morning but not so deeply that he wouldn’t notice what John needed.
John sits on Sherlock’s chest as he ties Sherlock’s hands to the headboard. He grinds his groin slowly into Sherlock’s face.
of it is okay. But I had no right to… I should never have done that. Even without your back in the state it would have been in. God, I can’t even… I feel sick just thinking about it now.”
Dominic smiles and slowly gets undressed as he walks to her. “Always. Are you sure you want to carry Diōnē?” He asks.
He blushes and groans a bit as he pulls out, stepping back as Mycroft steps forward. "Mm, hello, Mummy Dearest."
Collin licks a swipe over Sherlock's arsehole rubbing his scruff between Sherlock's cheeks and strokes his cock.
Sherlock smiles and climbs off John. “No more floating feeling?” He asks softly, as he helps John to sit up.
"Oh, I've heard of your interest in my work." Marianne laughs, opening the car door. "Not as interesting as your video, but that's not my business." She winks.
Mycroft sighs softly. "It... It was a shock." He admitted. "But a reasonable explanation." He gave a small smile.
"That's right. Like a slut. Such a loud slut.." She takes out her fingers and pushes into him. "What if someone came by and they saw what a beautiful slut you are? What if they wanted to fuck you like I do?"
She nearly vomits as he hits her gag reflex directly. She whimpers and gets on her hands and knees. She spreads her legs wide, cunt dripping messily.
He remains silent as he waits impatiently for his car to arrive, only the sound of him puffing out smoke breaks the silence.
She nods and takes his hands. “It’ll take a bit but it won’t hurt. Just kind of a funny tingling feeling.”
Greg hums and nuzzles him. Lydia comes over and sits the tray on the table as she sits across from them.
“And you want to make sure she’s nice and open to take that monster cock.” He laughs. “She must be so full of cum right now. She’s going to have pups for all your dog?”
"Mum, don't hide it from me. I know it isn't yours. We'll fix this, I promise. I asked Mycroft to force the bond off of Moriarty. We're not sure it'll work... But if we target the same area he bit you... If not, then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it."
"Fuck, fuck... oh god, yeah, right there... Don't stop, Sherlock. God," he pants out. Suddenly he's overcome with
John holds him up. "No please don't listen to me. It's not like I'm a doctor or anything." John puts Sherlock's coat over his shoulders and wraps it round him. "I'll give you something to take the edge off when we get home."
Sherlock feels John push him out of the way as a shot rings out across the room. He grunts as he hits the floor. "JOHN!" He screamed.
He bites his lip and thinks. "Since this Max person knows so much we should know about him. Forewarned is forearmed.."
Margaret nods. “And soon I’m going to be a mummy, that’s why John said you couldn’t jump on my tummy, it will hurt the baby in there.” She explains softly.
"Maybe gymnastics. I'm already pretty good at that. When's the next olympics? Maybe I could win a medal." She smirks.
Sherlock frowns. He rolls John onto his stomach and makes sure he stays in the heating pad. He moves behind John and massages his lower back. “It’s getting worse, John. Tell me what to do.”
Sherlock nods. “Well, this guy, invented electricity. That’s what everything works off. But that’s not important.” He pulls out his phone. “This is a phone, you can talk to other people through it. Either by writing a letter, called a text. Or by calling someone, so you can hear them.” He smiles softly, handing Camille the phone.
“You should have known right there something was off. As if I’d ever stoop to a junior detective when I have a doctor.” Sherlock scoffs.
He slips his tongue into him mouth and glides them together as he adds a second finger. “Mm you’re so tight. Think you can handle a big cock like mine?” He smirks and rubs his cock against George’s leg.
She snorts. "Can't promise anything." She teases. "You're a great story teller, John, but all this medical, technical talk is not anyone's forte."
Mycroft reaches between them and pushes two fingers inside her, thrusting them hard and fast. He whines at how empty he feels.
Sherlock sighs. “I’d love to have a family as well. I just... I don’t know whether my sperm is still alive or dead like me.” He explains.
Mycroft drinks half the glass and looks her over. “Finding out about Gregory has really upset you, huh?” He asks softly, once she’s finished.
John sends a quick text to Mycroft. **Home. Everything is going good. How's Greg feeling?--JW** John gets into bed with Sherlock.
He smirks and pulls the plug out of him, letting the cum from earlier pour out of him for everyone to see. "What a slut." He groans and teases his cum slick hole with his cock.
“Stupid!” She stands up and shouts at him, clearly having gotten his temper if not Sherlock’s vocabulary. “You love Papa and Papa loves you! So why are both of you so stupid!”
“You do help. Just by having you close is a big help.” Joann rubs his hand. “We can decorate it so it’s all set up for when your mate gets back.” She smiles softly.
Sherlock goes to John and somehow manages to get John to sit. He crawls into John’s lap and presses his forehead to John’s as he transforms into his human form. He can’t take seeing John hurting anymore.
‘Mm I got a new toy.’ Sky smirks and gets up, putting out a special strap on. She smirks, two large cocks on the harness. ‘One for each hole. I know you like being stuffed full so I made you a special toy.’
He chuckles softly and holds him tight, memorizing what Sherlock feels like pressed against him. "You've got to get going, honey."
Sherlock closes his eyes and focuses. “Buhbum buhbum buhbum.” He mumbles as he feels the beat through their bond.
“I understand.” Sherlock nods. “But I need to know you understand that it’s not just you you’re keeping safe. It’s all four of you.”
“I’ll watch them while you shower. Or maybe a bath if you want.” Sherlock smiles and rolls the cradle so it’s next to the kitchen so they can watch the pups while they eat.
"Mmm, a bit more life-altering than uni," John comments as he watches their youngest son read over the single sheet of paper inside.
Crystal moans as she slowly climbs off him, slick and come pouring out of her and over Greg. She lays down in front of him with her head in his lap.
Collin pulls him closer once they're in the room. "What do you want?" He hums and nips at Greg's jaw as John closes the door.
"Show me how much you missed me." She purrs and lays lays back against the bed, licking her lips as she looks up at her.
Anthea moans and her fingers tighten in Lydia's hair. John kisses and sucks on Lydia's neck, rocking his hips slowly.
He furrows his brow a bit. “I don’t know what that means. I’m sorry, I’ve been locked away for a long time..”
"Good boy. Such a pretty slut. All mine." He growls, smirking as he cuts iff his air forma few seconds at a time.
Mycroft holds him protectively, still moving his hips against his arse. The man frowns a bit. "Pity. You're fucking sexy and I'd love to show you a good time."
"I remember the better times and that gets me through the rough patches." John explains, "I know the real you. I know your heart. And whenever I begin to wonder if it's worth it, I just have to see you with Rosie." His smile widens, "and that's enough."
"Yes." John moans and Sherlock looks desperate to fuck Greg, looking at him with animalistic need. "Yes." Sherlock growls and Greg whimpers needy.
"I love you, too.." He smiles at how soft and submissive John is. He gets them dressed and out to the kitchen so he can make John breakfast. "What do you want to eat, babe?" He asks softly.
A phone rings from somewhere in the flat. Greg tenses and groans because he recognizes the ringtone.
"The neighbors called the cops because of the gunshots. I took their memories of this morning. The cops think they were all drunk and shot at each other. It's all wrapped up in a nice red bow." She bites her lip as she stitches up her leg.
Sky gags and moans as she tries to swallow, some of his cum squirting out her nose since it ro much for her to take. The man smirks and pulls off the flesh light. “Look at you. Still fucking hard.” He slaps Turks cock.
“I know. It’s okay not to know. Sometimes we need to try things out and see if we like them.” She gently runs her fingers through his hair.
Violet breathes hard, moaning at the heavy weight and pressure of the plug. She rolls onto her back and props her hips up at an angle to make sure their cum knocks her up. She mewls and rubs her swollen clit with one hand and plays with her breaths with the other. "Now that you've filled Mummy's pussy like she wanted what can Mummy do for you?" She asks all of them, hips rocking subtly as she fucks herself in the huge plug.
Mycroft pushes back from his seat and stands. "I can't believe this." He frowns and pushes his way past Greg's chair and into the loo.
“I know you do. Such a good boy. All you want is to be fucked and to knock up my wife, mm?” He snaps his hips and spanks him gently.
A while later, when it was absolutely essential for them to finally get up and get ready for their dinner, Mycroft smiled, helping Greg up. "I can't wait to see you in your new suit." He murmurs.
About half an hour later, there is a gentle knock at the door. A tall woman, with minimal makeup, a long sleeved blouse and dark Olive slacks stood there, nervously.
Sky smiles, getting the horses settled. She lets Nina and Danny hangs out with the horses for a little while before sending them off to bed.
Mycroft cries out as Sherlock hits his prostate with each thrust. "'Lock, please!" He begs, tipping his head back.
Kia whimpers, her belly swollen with so much cum. She gasps as she feels her belly grow more, not with his cum but with his child.
He moans, not caring about his expensive shirt. He whimpers, rubbing his hard cock against Duke’s stomach.
Greg smiles, “I knew I had the best vampire by my side.” He looks at Crystal’s wrist. “There’s no scarring.” He mutters.
She blushes brightly and whimpers needy. "I want you all the time. Constantly. I can never get enough of you." She babbles as she rides him.
"Just because you want to have Rosie around again doesn't mean you can't still solve crimes." John explains, glancing in his daughter's direction. "We can sort out a way to make it work."
"Mm you feel so good. Touch me. Just touch me." She begs, forgetting that Greg and Mycroft were sleeping on the other end of the couch.
Mycroft nodded, “If Sherlock wishes to go with Doctor Watson, would you give him permission?” He asks, looking at Sherlock, hoping he is judging the mood right.
Mycroft bites his lip and nods excitedly. “I just want to be used by you all. Be your needy little whore. Well, big whore.” He giggles. “Anytime, anyplace. I want you all to just get me into a room and use me until you’re done.” He blushes and nuzzled into Taylol’s neck. “Please.”
Cold eyes turn and face them. A look of unbridled rage twists the man's features. John and Harry both stiffen, but Joann's shoulders relax and she breathes a sigh of relief. John smiles over at his sister, happy to have witnessed her first step on the long road to recovery.
He reaches back, scrambling to take the condom off of John's prick. He moves to press John's cock at his entrance, moaning at the feeling of skin on skin.
“I’ll see what I can remember.” Sherlock smiles softly and sets John’s plate in front of him as well as a cup of tea.
He hums softly and kisses over his shoulders and neck. “How about I take you to bed and help you relax?”
John paused in the kitchen as he was grabbing out the glasses. “Did you just… ”  he stopped for a minute. Maybe he was hearing things. “Did you just say you wanted James Bond to… do things to you?” He laughed. He found the already opened bottle of wine and brought it and the glasses out, looking at Sherlock surprised.
"Fuck you," John snarls. He holds onto his anger for now. Being angry meant the panic and disrepair had an emotion to fight with for attention. Anger was better than fear.
"If it would please you, Sir. You did save my life so I owe you nothing less than all of me. I would gladly go down on my knees for you anytime, Sir." He wiggles slightly against  him.
Veronica grins and licks up what he leaks, sucking his cock. Jason groans and rocks down his throat. Sherlock turns up the vibrator, moaning as it presses against his cock and George’s prostate.
He blushes brighter and nods, his cock twitching a bit with interest. It’d always been a kink of his to be dominated, not only in the bedroom.
Greg nods. “I’m surprised she’s not here. She seems to be the one that’s had most contact with humans.”
“Where the flowers are from. It’s a catch me if you can. An invitation to come find him.” Sherlock frowns as he gets dressed, this was the whole point of having a funeral but it doesn’t mean that he likes it.
"So what? They were just waiting for us to leave so they could get out?" John snaps, "I thought Mycroft had eyes all over Baker Street. Why is it suddenly possible for someone to break in?"
Greg frowns and gets up to follow Mycroft but Max pulls him back down to sit. "He's fine. Probably just has to piss." Max says trying to keep Greg at the table. Greg frowns and pulls away. "And how would you know what my Fiancé had to do?" He snaps and gets up following Mycroft.
"You make such maddening sounds.." He kisses hard till he's breathless once again. "What do you need?" He growls softly.
Anthea cries out from the surge of pleasure, coming hard around Harry’s cock.  Mycroft groans as he watches them, his cock twitching desperately inside Harry. Anthea's muscles clamping down around her is all Harry needs. Her knot fully swells and she shivers as she pumps her Omega full with her seed. She doesn't release her teeth until they've both stopped twitching. With a breathy sigh, she addresses Mycroft while nuzzling against Anthea's neck.
“Great! All you have to do is take off your shoes and put on these plastic socks.” She smiles and hands him the socks.
John breaths a sigh of relief and takes the vile. “Thank you, Sherlock. I know that was very hard for you to do so thank you for being so strong.”
"No. I'm not going to make her feel like she needs to stay. She'll feel trapped and she'll hate me for it. No, Crofty. She needs to go. Keep an eye on her when she's gone.."
“Mm I don’t know about that. Mummy seems like a needy slut that can never get enough cock or cum inside her greedy holes.” He smirks and slaps his cock against her cheeks gently, making sure his leaking smears against her skin. “Even now after being fucked for ages and your cunt filled with four huge loads of cum you’re still rubbing your horny little clit desperately.”
“She wasn’t in them for hours, she took them off as soon as she could. Like any sane person would.” Camille snarls at him, her fangs showing. She claps her hands and the glamour falls away from Greg, revealing him to everyone. “You know it would hurt her more because it was inside her wrist. Now get out before I decide to cut you and let the rest of the vampires have their way with a bleeding, visible human.” She orders.
"Sher..." John stopped and swallowed back against the bile, willing his breakfast to stay down. "Sherlock." He cleared his throat. "Sherlock."
John cries out in pleasure, tightening his legs around Sherlock's hips, forcing him still as he comes into John's arse.
Oh, yeah, Hi and all that. I just... Script script? Sounds like some dull cartoon actor whose one goal in life is to be so boring and repetitive that children stare and drool at them. But, as you're the genius, I'll trust you are correct. Even if it does sound like the stupidest thing in the world right after re-activating old worn-out soldiers.
'Because none of the men in my entire family line have been good fathers. Some worse than the last. We're just not meant to be fathers.'
They pull up outside the airport and Sherlock climbs out of the car, thankful that it was dusk. He puts the two bags on his back and offers his arm to Magdala. “Will you tell me where to go?” He asks softly.
John kisses his back and pulls out of him. Collin lays Sherlock on his back and kisses his neck and chest. "So loud. So beautiful." He growls softly and kisses him deeply.
“Let’s put that on the back burner for a moment.” Crystal sighs, not really knowing where to begin. “You love him. I know you do. So doesn’t this feel like he’s using you? To get what he wants? He’s using your feeling for him to hold you hostage. He knew you’d pick him over becoming our sister. The choice is your but I hope you make it for the right reasons. For what you want. Not what he’s hoping you’ll do.”
“But..” John frowns. “You said it wasn’t your area. You’ve never gone out with anyone the whole time I’ve known you. Well maybe Adler.” He can’t help himself from scowling a bit at her name. He was still so irrationally jealous of that woman.
“I will. He trusts you so completely and he has a hard time trusting people. It’s hard for him to grasp that you can trust him and Mycroft at the same time.” Magdala rubs his arm gently. “It’ll be okay. You’ll see.” She smiles softly.
John nods as he relaxes. “Thank you Sir.” He smiles. “Will you make me your come bucket, just keep filling me up more and more throughout the day whenever you want to?” He asks.
“I guess so.” Sherlock says, trying to understand what John was upto. “I need to get in contact with him. Do you know where he’s staying? He’s left a couple of his things here at Baker Street.” Sherlock easily lies. “I want to give it back to him.”
Carol moans loudly and arches, leaking milk for him and gushing into his mouth as he latched on. Collin holds James’ hips and sinks into him.
Mycroft is alerted at once to John’s presense in the building, not only can he smell his blood, a worker comes into his room, to explain what was happening. He tells the younger vampire to bring Dr Watson to him post haste. He may have a soft spot for Sherlock, but that doesn’t mean he has to be polite to everyone he meets.
"Yup. You know me. Saving the world with one half cocked idea at a time." She giggles. "Oh! Also I designed this. Show file 42b." She says to the ball and the hologram projects a ring. "Tada." She smiles at Mycroft. "I designed your wedding bands for the four of you. Not only are they rings they are also homing devices. If you ever get into trouble you just have to spin them to a combination and it'll let the other rings know you're in danger. It will send out coronations to the wears location for rescue." She smiles.
They fuck him to the edge of coming again. The men standing around start to piss on him. The ones in his arse cum hard and let go, filling his arse with cum and piss. The other man shoved his cock down his throat and cuts off his air, heightening the feeling.
John follows with Kia a pace behind Sherlock. “Do you like this? It’s beautiful isn’t it.” He smiles.
"I love you.. I love you so much.. Please.. Come.. I need it.. So close.." Collin moans and begs needing permission to come.
Sky nods, handing Dr. Parker her paperwork. Her biggest red flag was her trauma page, nearly every box checked including physical and sexual abuse.
"Y-you.. You can touch me anywhere you want. However you want. As much as you want.. Please." Sky moans breathlessly.
“Butterflies?” Daniel asks shyly. He had seen the sign from the road that they’d just opened a new butterfly exhibit but he was hesitant to ask since Sam look like a very masculine guy. He knew that some men that were really masculine didn’t think cute things like butterflies were appropriate things to like.
“Why don’t I show you, Sherlock?” Udos asks as he carries Sherlock to his bedroom, as he walks, one fingers, gently plays with Sherlock’s entrance under his clothes.
"Mm good." He praises and pushes in two fingers. He slowly fucks him with his fingers and slaps his arse again.
“Good. Show her how a good girl takes cock.” Chloe smirks and teases Mel’s swollen slick pussy lips with single finger, dragging it over them slowly. Mel moans around his cock and trembles at Chloe’s finger.
“Greg, you and Sherlock have worked side by said on countless cases. You can’t tell me that he’s like that. I know you’ve seen his care and compassion. Hell you’ve told Donovan and Anderson off enough about him actually caring about people.” John frowns.
“You’re going to be so round, baby. So full.” He groans as he listens to the slick sounds of his fingers in his cunt.
"It's not a myth. Some of us are just lucky enough to avoid the system of forced bondings, and get to choose our mates."
"Good. Good boy. I'm going to send some people to help. I'll be there as soon as I can. She'll be okay. I promise."
He moans and fills her womb more as he comes hard into her. He has her hand pressed to her belly so she can feel herself swell with his load.
"No but I would have to spend more time abroad.." Sky bites her lip, knowing her due date is at the end of the week as well.
"Good boy. Christ look at you. So fucking perfect. Absolutely gorgeous. I've never been so turned on by watching anyone else's lips around my cock before but yours now." He holds the back of his head and rocks down his throat slowly. "Keep fingering yourself, baby. Get nice and ready for Daddy's cock. He's going to feel even bigger in your arse than he does in your mouth."
John's hips buck and he moans. He bites his lips and reaches down in between Mycroft's legs, careful not to touch him, and pulls the plug out of him. He sucks on the plug and moans before pushing up into himself.
She moans loudly and trembles, cunt throbbing as she gets closer to coming. “You love to watch me get used, don’t you, Daddy? You love watching your little girl get used. You love watching me get filled. You love watching other men fill me up with their cum and pump their babies into me. Don’t you, Daddy?”
"John?" She asks questioningly, making John's heart melt. He knows, in that instant, that Mrs. Hudson would put her foot down and not let Harry step one foot into her property if John expressed that was his desire.
Mycroft kisses John deeply as Sherlock sucks John cock. Greg pushes another finger into John and slowly fucks him.
Sky looks up and smiles as she sees Chloe come out. "How's it going?" Sky smiles as she types on the computer, not needing looking at what she's typing.
"I slept with mum last night... Neither of us wanted to be alone so Mycroft helped me drag both mattresses onto the floor. Sort of stole your idea."
Sherlock just shrugs. “We’re looking for the ashes of a long dead vampire. Nothing sounds ridiculous.” He replies softly.
Harry and Anthea are both nervously pacing the hall when Mycroft walks in. Harry is trailing to steps behind Anthea doing her best to calm the other woman down without touching her. The second the door opens Harry looks up and breathes a sigh of relief.
“I think she will. As long as they put a baby in her greedy womb I don’t think she care who owns her. She is jus a slut. I dirty little cumslut looking for any cock to knock her up.” Turk smirks, getting Mycroft’s game. “No..” Sky whimpers halfheartedly, but she knows they’re absolutely right.
"Oh God yes." She moans and arches. "I can come just by you playing with them." She whimpers and trembles as she rides him harder.
Sherlock presses himself closer and licks down his jaw to his neck. Mycroft follows John's gaze and his own turns a bit predatory. He licks his lips as he watches.
“You do know our Sire turned me because of my feirceness and she knew I would be a good protector?” Mycroft asks with a smile. “What did she turn you for?”
Crystal moans wrapping her arms around Maggie and pulling her down beside her. “Should we wake up?” She asks softly.
“I was just worried something happened to you.” Sherlock brushes some lint off him. “Or that you weren’t coming at all..”
“Oh someone has a praise kink.” Greg chuckles. “Well then, beautiful. Why don’t I take care of that?”
“I got you a lot of presents while I was on my trip. We can go to my place after dinner and relax for a bit.” He smiles, pulling up to the restaurant.
“We’ll be able to repopulate our kind with one good night of breeding.” He smirks, fucking her deeper as his knot starts to form. Sky moans breathily, tightening around them.
John shrugs. “May it’s disruptive behaviour, if they get carried away, it’s not fun for the children to watch.” He smiles, he steps up behind Margaret and hugs her tightly. “But since there are no kids here.”
Sky trembles, coming continuously as they stretch her cervix together. “You can’t possibly think you’re going to beat me. I’ll put so many babies in her there won’t be any room for yours. You might as well push back into her arse. Her cunt us mine. Her womb is mine.” Turk snarls at Mycroft as he pounds into Sky.
He hums. "Such a good little slut.." He watches as Carol walks over to her, smirking. "I can't wait for your tongue on my hot cunt." She gets onto the counter and has Michael turn Sky onto her back.
“That’s right. My good boy.” He kisses his neck. He rocks his fingers slowly, smirking as he sees Sherlock getting wet. He rubs his clit teasingly as he rocks his fingers in his arse.
John nods and smiles. “That’s true. But you could have told me about all this a lot sooner. Being a vampire, I could have helped.” He says softly.
She blushes and nods. “I’m carrying three big litters plus human babies. And I’m speeding it up a bit.”
"God, you're going to fucking drown us if you keep squirting like this." He smirks, pounding into her. "Maybe I'll pump enough cum into you to put another baby into you."
“Brilliant idea.” He laughs. “I’ve never gotten high. Tried to set a good example for Sherlock. Didn’t really work out..”
"Mmm... baby's using my bladder as a trampoline." Molly mumbles. She closes the door to the ensuite and relieves herself with a sigh.
Sherlock sighs. “I know, my dear, would you prefer to feed me or be with me forever?” He asks softly.
P.S If one more single mother tries to give me their number I’m going to start wearing a gay pride pin. They’re desperate, John.
“I suppose you’re right. I didn’t take that into account.” Sherlock hums, still straddling him. “What about me? How was I?”
“No wonder you love doing experiments.” Mycroft chuckles. “You do experiments?” The attendant grins.
Situated in the tub John leans against Sherlock's chest, hoping their closeness will help the vein-like red trails fade from Sherlock's skin.
John hesitates and takes off his jumper, handing it to Sherlock. "Fabric acts as a bumper with electricity."
“I would love to touch your penis.” Greg smiles softly. “Maybe we can start like this. I’ll put my hand here and you can press against it whenever and however you like.” Greg situates his hand in front of Mycroft’s pants, just enough space for Mycroft to have to push forward to get contact.
Harry frowns as she watches, she was born with the Watson instincts. She knew John had them as well but they were dulled down from his army training. “If you so much as leave a scratch on John I rip your fangs out with rust pliers.” She grumbles at Sherlock.
"Ah fuck.." Greg says pulling the cigarette out of his mouth as he sees Sherlock walking toward him.
He moves off his shoulder to look at him. "It's not your fault. You may have jumped the gun but you were just excited. I don't blame you for any of it. It's just.. All four of us need to have a discussion. Something we do doesn't just effect you and I but all of us. Sherlock told me that and I don't know why I didn't see it before.." He looks over at Sherlock, who is still sedated, and John who's is sitting next to him holding Sherlock's hand.
"I don't think it does either. Mostly..." John glances sideways at Mycroft and shoots him an apologetic look for being so candid. I think my three are from three different
"Good man." Mycroft looks up and smiles. "I have the order for the baby monitoring system to agree to... and a bit of work that I've put by the wayside to spend time with you." He made a face.
Collin chuckles softly and kisses his head. Greg follows them to bed leaving Sherlock and Lydia to watch John.
She flinches as he touches her but quickly relaxes under his hand. “I know this is going to sound insane but I need you to fuck me..”
“I want to help you rule. It’s never good if it’s only one person. You saw that with Camille. Maybe two people can be a little... calmer.” Greg smiles softly, kissing her cheek.
"Sure." Jean turns on the shower and strips.  Sky gets in and groans softly letting the water run down her body.
Sherlock growls and all but flies up the stairs and throws the door open, it slams so hard against the wall it bounces back and Sherlock grips it tight.
"He's terrified to speak to Carol or anyone really at this point because he's worried they'll think he was just whining for attention and it's not.. he wasn't.."
This guy comes over and talks to Sally and Sally points to Sky. "Jesus, Sky, is that you?" Paul says. "In the flesh." Sky smiles at her old arresting officer.
She frowns and bites her lip. "You know what a concussion is right?" She asks trying to make him focus on something other than his frustration with himself even if it means just trying to get him to focus on her words.
“Oh so you’re not going to be using me as a breeding cow?” John laughs. He moans as he grinds into Greg’s hand.
John stands and pulls Sherlock up with him. He drags them into the bedroom and shuts the door. He pushes Sherlock's back against the door. He kisses his neck and chest and he takes off Sherlock's shirt.
Sherlock reads the text and smiles. “Then we’ll go there.” He says softly as he gets a taxi and asks the driver to take them to the natural history museum. He puts up the slider before speaking again. “Ma’am, if I may be so brave, when was your time? Mycroft’s never told me when you changed him, nor when you were changed.” He says quietly.
"So how are you doing? Paul is it?" Sky smiles and the man glares. "How is it being Sebastian's new lap dog? Not a lot of fun right?" She hums.
“No getting into fights on purpose.” John says even though he knows Sherlock will do it anyway, hell even he does it himself sometimes.
“You’re important to me. I want you to be happy. This must be such a horrible existence for you. Constantly being used and abused like a breeding stud.” Sherlock frowns.
“Who knew your brother was such adrenaline junkie.” John chuckles. “Besides the nails were filed flat so there was no risk.” Mycroft kisses Sherlock’s head.
"Yes but that's only part of it. They only show you part of what they think because that's all they can express. Let's see.. Take Donovan for example. She's rude to you and stubborn but the other side of that coin is that she knows you are brilliant and she respects that part of you even though she doesn't express it."
John drops his head into his hands. "I know." He whispers. "I'm sorry. But Sherlock is my top priority... I know I haven't known him long, but... Christ, in thirty minutes of Moriarty's company, he ends up injured and backing straight back into the fucker's conditioning." He looks like he wants to cry.
Sherlock moans and drools against the mattress, raising his arse up higher. "Yours! Promise! All yours!"
He pulls his fingers out of himself and stormed Mycroft's cock. He bites his lip and opens his legs wider. "Fuck me.. I need you to fuck me.." He whimpers desperately.
Mycroft hands her a card from the pile, without looking at it. “I see you have a good hand, sister.” He beams.
“Sherlock’s in danger. A client went up and a few minutes later John pulled me out of the flat.” Mrs. Hudson relays.
"It would be easier to ask what I don't do!" She giggles. "I own a circus out in the country, I'm a certified midwife and I actually delivered a baby just the other day, and I handle international dealings with large companies and wealthy individuals." She smiles.
John snorts then says, "Means I don't have to worry about you doing something stupid. Like going off alone and getting yourself smacked over the head with a board."
"I better get going." John hums and kisses Mycroft then Sherlock. "It'll be alright. I'll see you later." He smiles softly and kisses Greg.
"Honestly I would have been worried if you did anything else." She hums, not admitting how much she missed having Viper crawl into her lap naked.
On the morning of the third day spent inside Mycroft's house, John looks up from the crossword puzzle he'd been working on. Mycroft and Anthea stood in the doorway, and Mycroft had his gaze set on Sherlock.
“You’ll just have to exhaust me then.” Sherlock smirks, feeling bolder ever since he ate the leaf and realized he doesn’t have to hold back with John.
John licks his hips and lays there frozen. He wants to shamelessly pull his legs up and present his slit for Sherlock but he still can't move. All he can do is watch as Sherlock strokes himself and stares down at John's stomach.
She blushes and plays with a lock of hair between her fingers. Her hair is still wet but it's already starting to curl naturally. "Thank you.." She smiles.
‘Understandable.’ He hums as he looks at them, smiling as the kitten crawls back over to him. “Hello there, little one.”
“I won’t keep him long. You know how the elders get antsy when there’s live stock around the club.” Mycroft sighs, waving Sherlock off. He gets up and goes to his desk once Sherlock his gone, looking over the Watson files until John would arrive.
For the fist time in twelve years Mycroft Holmes could not, for the life of him, make sense of the words he’d just heard.
He’d been too busy starring at his hand in John’s, lost to his own thoughts to realize that John had spoken to him.
“Right then” His father began in a stern voice. This was new, Mycroft thought with an arched brow as his father fidgeted with the seam of his jumper. Father was nervous, but father never got nervous. This was most alarming. In a panic Mycroft began to think of all the possible reasons as to why his father sounded like he was about to tell him his dog had died, a ridiculous thought, since Mycroft had never been inclined to keep any sorts of pets or companions. Mycroft had always been content in being by himself closed off to the rest of the world with his books. No, there was no need for other people, there were mummy and father, even Mrs. Smythe who would bake cakes almost every afternoon and let him polish off the icing from the spoon.
Sherlock rolled over on his back much like a cat might after a mid afternoon nap on a warm sunny day. All limber legs and arms slowly stretching upward while a deep sigh of contentment slipped by his partially parted lips. Judging from the amount of light filtering through the windows of his room it was clear that the morning was well on its way to becoming afternoon. He scoffed at the ceiling and let his head fall backwards on the pillow. He never slept, not like this, and he most certainly never dreamed of blue eyes and blonde hair.
"Jesus! John, please!" John swallowed Sherlock back into his throat with a pleased groan as he pushed the cap of the bottle open and squeezed some of the velvety clear liquid into his right hand and reached between Sherlock's thighs, circling a lubbed finger around the tight ring of muscles. He was about let go of Sherlock to ask if he was ready when suddenly he felt Sherlock bear down at the same time that the motion made his finger slip all the way in, past the tightness of his entrance.
Once finally naked John guided Sherlock down into the bed which protested with a loud creak of its springs. Sherlock's legs immediately wrapped around John's waist while his hips rocked up seeking contact and friction. "Oh, Fucking
" John's breath caught as their erections started grinding slowly together. John had never heard Sherlock swear before, and by God it was the most erotic thing he'd ever heard before and he decided that he wanted to hear it again, immediately. Without warning, John bit down on Sherlock's neck at the same time that he brought his hips down in a slow thrust. His reward was a string of mumbled curses weaved with his name.
As usual, comments and ideas for the story are always warmly welcomed :) or just pop in to say Hello!
spot over and over. Bodies hot and covered in sweat sliding against each other, moaning into each other. John reached between them and began stroking Sherlock's leaking cock in cadence with each trust. "Christ, you're so beautiful sweetheart" John panted into Sherlock's mouth between ragged and uncoordinated kisses as he continued to slam into him. It was all Sherlock needed to send him over the edge whimpering and shouting John's name.
The Fox Tail is an actual coffee shop in Orland FL that I happened to see during holiday. It was rather cute and I loved the name!
The first time it happened he’d padded down to the kitchen to distract himself. No one else was awake and he was very sure that Mycroft would follow through with his promise of shaving off his head if he woke him up in the middle of the night again just to “check if he
Sherlock’s throat decides that now is the time to see what it’s like to be completely dry.The sight of John licking,
Sherlock can see it all play in slow motion, the flash of surprise and confusion pass through John’s face. The indecision and sudden resolve form in his eyes. He knows what John is about to do a second before John takes the first step and starts to pull air into his lungs to speak.
This morning he’d dreamt of a milk and honey cake with with honeycomb candy. He grimaced as he rolled over on his side and felt the sheets ruined from this morning’s little indulgence under him. Very well then. He’d bake the cake and be done once and for all with John Watson.
When John was ten years old he’d woken up on a Saturday morning like any other before and he’d known, deep down, he’d known that nothing would ever be the same again.
“That’s right, the person I’m wishing for doesn’t exist, and if he doesn’t exist then I can never die of a broken heart, and you’ll never be alone”
Twenty minutes later find John panting and covered in sweat as he tries to think if he dreamt  the whole thing up. He ran toward where the mystery man had disappeared, he must’ve looked like a madman covered in white dust shouting into an empty street for someone who clearly had no intentions of stopping to stop and wait.
“All done then, but we’re out of milk again” Mike said over his shoulder as Sherlock finally emerged from the kitchen.
He’d gotten ready and gone into the shop as he normally did. He even said hello to Anderson much to Mike’s and Andersons shocked surprise. Sherlock was in putting the finishing touches to his milk and honey cake when he heard Mike call for him. Not odd, but certainly something serious must require his attention. Mike never called him to the front of the shop unless there was serious trouble. Sherlock took his apron off, wiped his hands on a towel and walked toward the front of the store.
John is covered in sugar when out of the blue he sees the last thing he expected to ever see: the man who would turn his world upside down.
He’d ran downstairs, not even stopping to wake Harry up, he hand’t been surprised to see her already taking the first steps down toward the kitchen. They’d always felt what the other was feeling, he knew without asking that the hairs on the back of her neck were standing up and a chill had settled down her spine. He slipped on the pancake batter spilt on the floor, he’d seen stars behind his eyes as he hit his head on the  hardwood floor, and then he’d heard the worse sound he would ever hear: the hushed sobs of his mother with a letter and a sea glass stone clutched  in her chest.  After that, John would never again eat pancakes on a Saturday and he would never again see his father.
John thinks as he takes a plush lower lip delicately between his teeth, coaxing a small whimper of pleasure to escape Sherlock's mouth traveling straight to his cock. "Alright?" John asks, letting go of Sherlock's swollen lip in favor of exploring his jaw with slow leisurely kisses. "God yes" Sherlock is braced against the back of John's front door, his tailored silk shirt half unbuttoned, revealing the tight and lean muscles of his chest, milky white skin which was once unblemished now flushed a lovely pink shade where John is running his fingernails trailing up to his neck and cheeks. John's knee wedged between Sherlock's thighs.
He sat Sherlock down at the edge of the bed and began to undress him. One by he unbuttoned each remaining button from Sherlock's shirt, cufflinks carefully collected and placed on the bedside table for safe keeping. John's heart pounded as he nuzzled his nose at the crook of Sherlock's neck, deeply inhaling his scent and feeling the soft tender skin behind his ear under his tongue while his hands moved to undo Sherlock's trousers. Sherlock tried to stifle a low moan with little success as John's hands skimmed down his thighs, guiding his trousers off.
The moment Mycroft looked into her arms, the moment he saw that little pink bundle move and squirm Mycroft new he was done for. And the moment a tiny hand tightened around his finger Mycroft Holmes decided that perhaps there was room for one more person in his circle of necessary people after all.
"Right, well John here can help you I'm sure. You know I can't lug around all those boxes. Besides, I need Phillip here to help me while you're gone"
And oh how suddenly Sherlock wanted to pat that hair, to ruffle it with his fingers and run his fingernails down John’s scalp. To hear pleased little noises scape those plush pink lips as his hands followed the curve of this man’s head down. Down to the base of his neck...
"Because everything you make tastes delicious" The heat on John's voice could've powered the entire electric grid a week. And Sherlock felt himself smiling, unable to resist John's charm. "If what I've tasted so far is anything to go by". The moment John's lips grazed his neck Sherlock lost all resolve. He felt himself melt into the touch while a small moan escaped his lips. John's hands were on his hips, traveling up to his abdomen and carresing his flesh through his shirt while he suckled a small bruise where his jaw and ear meet. His arousal pressing hard and firm into the back of Sherlock's left thigh.
Suddenly John's hands are gone and Sherlock instantly misses the contact. Before he can do or say anything in protest he's being turned around and crowded into he cooking table by John's body against his. Jon's lips against his are soft and warm barely touching his. John's hands move to cradle his jaw and Sherlock can feel a small sigh of contentment leaving his lips. Their first kiss is nothing like what Sherlock imagined. It's reverent and loving and Sherlock wants nothing more than to stay like this forever. He finds himself returning the kiss, moving his lips against Johns. Soon the kitchen is filled with stifled moans and wet sounds as their kisses become more desperate.
"Well they smell just as delicious as they taste" John said as he lowered Sherlock's hand. Not letting go.
"S'this alright? Like this? I want to see you" Sherlock seemed to be beyond words, with flush cheeks and sweaty arms he shyly wrapped both legs around John's waist in response. With shaking hands John tore the condom open and slowly rolled it up on himself gasping at how sensitive he already was, he didn't remember the last time he'd bean so needy and eager.
Sherlock’s heart thumped through his chest as he heaved deep desperate breaths leaning against the door of his apartment. He’d ran the whole way without looking back. He could still hear John yelling for him to stop, even now he imagined what that voice would sound like next to his ear whispering  his name as he palmed his cock through his trousers.  A low moan braking from  his lips at the friction.
"You okay love?" He asked as he guided his pulsing cock to Sherlock's entrance. Sherlock groaned almost like he was about come "Please John! What are you waiting for?!" It was all the permission John needed, all self control broken he gave one sleek trust, driving all the way home in one fluid motion. Sherlock gripped at John's shoulders as his face contorted in pleasure. John began to move in and out of him in a slow and decadent rhythm. They fucked like that, slowly, for a while. John lost in Sherlock's pants and moans of his name, Sherlock lost in pure bliss and pleasure finding a rhythm together.
With a moan Sherlock pressed back into John, seeking more, wanting friction, wanting to feel more of John's muscled body against his. Anything to make this feeling last. Before Sherlock can think of anything to make his need known John's hands start traveling down. Circling around his hips and down his thighs, fingernails scrapping trough his trousers against the sensitive skin of his inner thighs and he can't take it anymore. "John! Please!".
. No matter how many new recipes he tried or how many sleepless nights he spent in the kitchen nothing seemed to appease him. The fact that he’d shown up to the fish market at the same time every morning, not in hopes of running into a certain blonde blue eyed man thank you very much, with little success had nothing to do with it. Nope, nothing. Even Anderson had commented on how much fish they were serving lately.
Anderson yelled from across the shop where he had been moping the floors.  Sherlock simply rolled his eyes as dramatically as he could making sure Anderson saw, but mentally made a note to stop by and get some more tuna. He’d been wanting to try a different type of tuna altogether and now was the perfect opportunity. Not that he would ever tell Anderson that, obviously.
He was compact but not small, lean and muscular. He moved about with the confidence of someone who was both proud and sure of what their body was capable of. It was mesmerizing to watch, the way in which he moved, the way his muscular arms flexed as he examined the fish. The way his sandy blonde hair bounced around as she shook with laughter.  Sherlock sucked in a breath at the sight of a thin strip of skin that showed as the blonde lifted one of the fish up in the air letting his white t-shirt ride up his muscular torso.
Sherlock snapped his head up to find John looking at him with a glint in his eyes. Those blue eyes that were so warm and inviting, head cocked to the side with a small amused smile on his face. It gave him the appearance of an eager puppy waiting for a pat on the head.
Sherlock's stomach dropped to the floor. John remembers. John remembers it's him he saw this morning.
“Hello, I’m John” John's smile made his eyes crinkle. His pupils slightly dilated, almost overtaking the endless blue of his irises. His furry eyebrows partially covered by unruly waves of amber ale coloured hair.
“Hmmmm, suppose I could pop up by the market and procure some” Sherlock had answered in a distracted manner.
Two more weeks and Sherlock had nearly forgotten about the stranger when he found himself staring at him for the second time. He was even better than what Sherlock remembered. There he was, talking to an elderly woman in a purple dress inside the restaurant. He was smiling, hands behind his back, the sleeves of his chef’s double breasted coat hugging his slightly flexed biceps with a towel casually draped over his left shoulder. The woman had said something to make him smile as she lifted one hand to his cheek and Sherlock saw the blonde leaning into the touch. He wondered how the five o’clock shadow would feel under the pads of his fingers.
We get to see a little bit of what Mycroft during his younger days. I've always had a soft spot for him.
It’s not like he never dreamt. He did, on the very few occasions when he managed a number of uninterrupted sequential hours of sleep. But that was the trick wasn’t it? Sherlock never felt the need to sleep, not like Mycroft and the rest of his family seemed to. He just didn’t sleep, instead he would nap by the windows of the sitting room or on his bed for a few minutes at time. More than once he’d frightened Mrs. Smythe when she’d walked in on him hunched over the kitchen table in the early hours of the morning.
"Oh God" Sherlock almost chocked on the words, grabbing at John's t-shirt. "Naked, now!" John nearly fell off the bed while trying to take his jeans and pants off. Sherlock was perfect underneath all those clothes with seemingly endless white skin that John found delicious to the touch and almost impossible not to kiss. Sherlock found John's body to be everything he had come to dream and more. Compact muscles that flexed with every movement, a small scar on his abdomen where his appendix had been removed, and old rugby scar on his left shoulder and a very hard and pink cock that set Sherlock's groin on fire.
“What seems to be the prob….” For the second time in his life Sherlock Holmes was frozen, panic vivid in his eyes and a small blush slowly rising up from his neck to his cheekbones.
"Don't, I like it... I like to hear you" John whispered into Sherlock's ear. He hesitated for a second before lifting his left hand to cup Sherlock's jaw guiding him to his lips. Sherlock shivered as the kiss turned desperate, rocking his hips into John's hand letting him feel how desperate he'd become, how hard he was for him. The friction was almost too much and not enough. They pawed at each other like horny teenagers. "God you're beautiful"
He kissed his way down Sherlock's chest in slow deliberate kisses. Stopping to lick at one nipple teasing it till it was up and hard for him only to move to the other one earning him wild little moans and pleading sounds that sounded a lot like his name. "Up sweetheart, lift your hips for me" Sherlock realized what was about to happen just as John positioned a pillow underneath his hips, leaving him opened and exposed.
And to his complete astonishment and surprise Sherlock winked. Yes, playing it cool and detached was the best course of action. There was no need to let this perfect stranger know he had any effect on him. No. Mysterious and aloof was the way to go. After all, the theatric streak of things was never lost on a Holmes and Sherlock saw no need to brake the family trait now.
By the third time he’d been found in the kitchens trying to bake a banana flavored cake Mrs. Smythe had just taken a deep breath and slyly hidden the matches. Mycroft had been more than happy to assist Sherlock in his culinary exploits by tasting all of his creations. He’d praise the good ones (usually the cakes) and solemnly nod and chew his way through the less savory ones. And so time passed and the Holmes family fell in the routine of each taking turns tasting Sherlock’s concoctions. By the time Sherlock was seventeen Mycroft’s middle had a rather impressive circumference when compared to the rest of this limber body which he continued to hide behind well tailored suits and their father had all together given up and let out all of his waistcoats.
The smell of books swirled around the room encasing him in a wonderful bubble of calmness. Something about the stacks of books, carefully lined up to the ceiling, mixed with the rich smell of mahogany always brought forth feelings of comfort and even something closely resembling happiness. Mycroft took a deep slow breath, Mrs. Smythe had cleaned today, the wood smelled strongly of polish and the rich Persian rug felt plush and fluffy underneath him as he dug his bare toes through it.
John Watson has absolutely no idea that Sherlock is standing a mere twenty feet away, looking straight at him. Sherlock seems to have forgotten how to speak, how to walk, how to breathe. If anyone had asked him what his name was at that exact same moment Sherlock is sure he would’ve simply combusted on the spot.
John’s hair is messy and wonderful all at once, Sherlock wonders if his hair feels as soft as it looks, like golden silk, and he imagines what delightful little sounds would spill out of John’s sinfully beautiful mouth if he pulled at it. Because,
That voice. It reminded Sherlock of the first time he’d tasted whiskey. The way it burned his throat leaving behind a trail of fire before settling in his belly. Its soft sloshing stoking warmth through his body.Like the coals on the fireplace of his father’s study where he'd nicked it from. Sherlock decided that he could listen to that voice for ages...
Lydia pulls off his cock and tugs on his balls gently to keep him from coming. "Are you going to fuck her?" Sky purrs.
John stares down at the text for a few minutes as he takes it in. He's not entirely sure but he thinks Sherlock is giving him the go ahead to initiate intimacy again.
Her growl is turned to a whine as he teases her. “I like it. I like it rough. As hard as you can give it to me. I’ll fucking take it.”
Sherlock rubbed his hands over his face. “Will you hold me for a few minutes before we have to go?” He mumbled, defeated.
“He used to when he was younger when he was scared. He couldn’t control it. Went to speech therapy and everything.” Mycroft sits back in the hard uncomfortable hospital chair.
Brian and James set a punishing pace as they fuck John harder and harder. "Look at you. Taking it like such a good little slut." Cecil smirks and pulls his thumb out. "Look at his poor cock. So hard and red." George presses his foot against John's cock.
John loved this position, he loved when Sherlock's longer frame pressed against his, and their knees slotted together. He loved the protective hand over his stomach and the warm breath against his neck. He especially loved waking up before Sherlock, and feeling his hard length press into his lower back while Sherlock was locked in a dream.
“What? What is it?” Sherlock says in the background, coming into the living room from his microscope in the kitchen.
John gets up and stands behind Sherlock. He rubs Sherlock's shoulders. "He'll leave soon. There is only so long he can stand out there without drawing to much attention."
Sky does as she’s told, reaching back and holding herself open for him. “It’ll fit, Sir. My needy womb has been drinking it all up. Always more room for more cum.”
Sherlock doesn't seem willing, or able, to move so he lays back against the sofa and lets his mate scent his stomach. It's strange and ticklish, but it calms his upset stomach. When Sherlock sticks his tongue out and begins licking, John puts a hand in Sherlock's hair and laughs. "Scenting is one thing, but licking me like I'm a damned ice lolly is another."
"Fuck just a massive orgy to fill every fertile pussy in sight. How did we not think if this before?" Collin groans, cock twitching and leaking. Carol comes over and over as her air is cut off, she's a soaked mess from her hips to her toes. "You're a fucking genius. We'd have such a beautiful family. So big and horny. The girls always full and waddling around with our children, ready for more at any moment. Whoever kid it turns out to be gets fucked by everyone. Even the girls no matter how pregnant they are they'll still wear strap ons and fuck him. We'll have so many kids. We'll have so much sex. Fuck I'm so hard." Collin groans and strokes himself.
John clicks his fingers and they’re stood in Morna’s bedroom, he pushes her onto the bed and stands above her.
"Okay, love... we need to wait, just a little while. The nurse will come and check on you every fifteen minutes. I promise you're in the best care." She smiled at Anthea. "So good to see an expectant mother, helping her wife.. despite the nurses rounds, keep us notified if things progress, okay?"
John frowns. “Why? I wanted to be as close as I could to you, I felt so alone, and you just pushed me away.” He says sadly, cuddling Kia.
Mycroft nods. "I met sky when she was 14. She was in a testing facility after her parents sent her here from India. She knew that they were going to kill her there from the testing. She called out my name for 23 days straight. She had never met me. I didn't even know of her existence. I was brought to her. This tiny girl clung to me like I was her last hope and at the point I really was.."
Veronica sucks one of Sky's nipples and pinches the other, making Sky cry out and comes hard. Veronica smirks and continues.
“Thank you.” She nods. “I’ll send in the extraction teams now. I don’t know what else Jennifer had planned and I don’t want to find out. We need to get all the innocent out as soon possible.” She looks to Turk.
Morna kisses Sherlock back deeply before pulling back a bit. “Mm of course.” She smiles and opens his arms for Kia.
She blushes and hums happily, nuzzling him. "Come on. We'll finish showering then something to eat then a cuddle."
“Wait for him to let you in.” The worker says after sliding his fangs back into his gums. He knocks on the door twice before leaving John on his own.
"No, but I can hold off on eating directly before he gets here." John sighs turning on the bed to face his mate. "Face it. No one else is sick, not you, and unfortunately not any of your brother's underlings. I thought it was the beer, then I thought it was food poisoning. Now I just think it's stress."
He said his goodbyes to John and tossed the phone away before tipping off the ledge. He could hear John screaming his name and then he was cut off as a bicyclist knocked him over. Sherlock took the opportunity to transform in mid air, choosing an ant, since that form would be able to survive the landing from that height.
They get cleaned up and leave the loo. The girls are standing by the bar. Sky is holding her ripped dress up and the guy who was hitting on her is now knocked out cold on the floor.
“He needed a friend, John. And you turned out to be so much more.” Mrs. Hudson pats his arm as they get to 221B.
“I’m sorry I’m late. The meeting ran over.” Mycroft sighs and takes off his suit jacket before working on his cuffs. “Your heat smells like it’s just starting.”
"Fuck." Greg frowns and starts putting the information into the computer as Michael comes in to his office.
He smirks as he takes the remote. 'Good girl. You can come whenever you need to. I won't stop.' He turns on the vibrator.
That's all John needs to hear, and all restraint goes out the window. He lurches forward and captures Sherlock in a much more searing kiss, adjusting his weight on the sofa to push him back and lean right into the kiss, trapping Sherlock. All this time he has felt lesser, unimportant, insignificant beside his genius detective, unable to let him know just how giant the depth of his dreams and desires are as far as this man is concerned. And now, he is finding out that Sherlock felt the very same, all this time. Everything inside him is buzzing and churning and alive.
“I know you can, bee. I’m just saying if playing house with your doctor is to much you don’t have to go through with this. It can stop right now.” He bites his lip. He knows how brilliant Sherlock is and how capable he is but he always worries about Sherlock’s feelings and emotions.
"But I am. We both could face some serious problems... Did he tell you that I can't get medical care, emergency or otherwise until I'm registered? I can get the basics through the army, of course... but." John shrugs against Sherlock's chest and sighs.
“It’s more what I can do for you. Or what my Sire can do for you.” Mycroft says softly. “You’re done so much for me, especially when you should be resting. Allow me to offer you something in return.” He says, “allow me to offer you a position of my sister.”
“You’re still the best little cock sucker over ever had though.” He smirks and punches his nipples gently over his shirt.
"No. I'm a consulting detective working for your grandfather. Many of your relatives have gone missing...I believe that they and your other relatives are conspiring to kill you, wait for your grandfather to die and split the money amongst themselves...in other words...you're in danger." Sherlock replied.
"I'm not going to let you die. Let me out and we can all live. I'll come back to you. I promise. Let me out so we can live." She begs.
“So it’s true, isn’t it?” Sally sighs and rubs her hand over her face. “She’s not a threat. She.. She’s a shifter..”
He bites his lips and nods to himself, deciding. “Let me be right..” He whispers leaning up as he pulls Sherlock down to him, kissing Sherlock softly. His lips much more coordinated and nicer than when he was sleeping.
“I’m finished.” Crystal let’s go of his hand, sounding exhausted. “Is there anything else you need from me before I leave you?”
Sherlock nods. “Another part I’m worried about is that.. You.. You’re just so wonderfully human. And I don’t want you to lose that.”
Eli soon pushes into her cunt as well, stretching her even further. Sherlock moans at the pressure against his cock, releasing her nipple. "Wanna see Mummy so big and full and pregnant.. Would you let me give you a baby, Mummy? Let your baby put a baby in you?"
“Mm it’s nice isn’t it? You’ll have to suckle from her from time to time. She’ll make to much milk for the pups and even for the other babies in the house to consume.” Darius hums as he watches, running his fingers through Dark’s hair to relax him. Sky gasps and arches as she feels his finger.
Mycroft smiles. "Yes, I should have known. Your... mother was also... deaf?" He smiled sadly. "So you were - are - well versed in British Sign Language, as well..." He smiles slightly. "I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry. I really am very interested."
“Should have drugged you first, Dr. Watson,” the nurse says and pulls down her mask. It was Mary, the woman John was supposed to go on a date with.
“Thank you.” Sky smiles and starts to eat, not realizing how hungry she was until she finishes nearly the whole plate in just a few bites.
"Harry here was just saying how rude it was we didn't invite her to the bonding ceremony. I agree, rude of us not to even invite ourselves."
Lydia swallows John's cock deeper and James starts to rock into John. "She's so wet. I can see why you couldn't resist filling her with cum. Tell me how you knocked her up." Sherlock smirks as he pumps his fingers in and out of Lydia.
Jared only wakes a few times in the night to be changed and fed. John wakes in the morning and goes down to the kitchen, making tea while still in his pajamas.
"Where?" Rosie asks as she returns to the table with arms loaded. "There isn't anywhere nice here. The only park around is really tiny and there aren't any trees."
