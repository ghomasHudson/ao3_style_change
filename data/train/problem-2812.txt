Another wistful expression passed over Castiel’s face as he replied, “In every single one,” but as he met Dean’s eyes the melancholy lifted and something warm and small and fragile glinted there in the depths of that ocean blue. “Until now.”
He brought one hand up to press fingers into his eyes and pinch the bridge of his nose, attempting to clear the fog of sleep from his head as he broke down the exact timeline of events since coming back from the hunt.
“A true love story.” Sonia smiled conspiratorially, “Think of how brilliant such a confession will be when you swoop in to sweep him off his feet, delivering him from the belly of the beast.”
Marut planted himself between the hunter and the exit with one large hand situated behind his lapel to, Dean assumed, grip a hidden angel blade. The mark hissed murderous intent in the back of his mind and his fingers twisted into fists at his sides as he stalked closer. He itched for a fight, to strike out and beat in the bastard’s bearded face until it was pulp on this knuckles but the set in his’s shoulders must have made it obvious because before he even had to slow his stride, Hannah was ordering the hulking angel to step aside and let him pass.
“Do you believe that?” Sam asked earnestly, “You’re sure they’re not lying just to mess with us? It wouldn’t be the first time they’ve gone after Dean.”
Cas looked away, shame and sadness filling him. “Our lives have been chaotic from the start” He confessed. “There simply hasn’t been an opportunity…” He could sense her reluctance to believe him, and he realized for the first time that perhaps it was because it wasn’t true... “Just before all of this,” Cas continued after a moment of deliberation, “We were...repairing our friendship. Much has happened between us in the years we’ve known one another. I wish I could say it was our first falling out but…” He trailed off, shaking off the still raw hurt that afflicted him despite their road to recovery, “After this latest hunt, Dean wanted to...talk. I was looking forward to it.”
“Woah, wait, what?” Dean blurted, his mind tripping over the unexpected mental gymnastics necessary to unpack that kind of statement. “Wanna run that one by me again?”
--they shared, Dean had no idea, so he tried to push his waning mental energy into the territory of what he
“Wait Cas, hold on--” Sam was cut off by the whir of feathers behind him, and he turned around with the phone still on his ear to find Jack and an equally stunned Castiel standing in the center of the room.
Castiel seemed to consider this for a moment before he took a step, his expression a strange mixture of relief and disbelief. “You didn’t...become a demon?”
It was so surprising, so completely out of the realm of what he’d expected, that Castiel found himself completely consumed by the sensation; one he thought he would never feel again.  It was messy and uncertain, one of the hunter’s hands fumbling for purchase against the fabric of the tight black shirt before finally latching around the side of the angel’s neck.
“Reorganizing the chaos left up here after...” Cas let the sentence drop off; they both knew what had caused it without needing to talk about it. “...with all of the separate factions vying for power, it would have been difficult for any group of them to take the reins, let alone a single leader. Hannah, for all you might think of her, has worked miracles up here. If I were to guess, she probably didn’t want to admit to herself or anyone else that she didn’t have a handle on this situation."
A second later, the hunter was at his side, clutching Cas’s upper arm to keep him upright and grunting out a slew of curses under the sudden dead weight before throwing his other arm around the angel’s waist to stabilize him. From his periphery, Dean could see Marut’s sour expression of distaste and pointedly ignored it in favor of focusing on Cas’s sudden fainting spell. Distracted, he didn’t see Harut’s piercing observation.
Evan bristled, “You should show some respect! Mr. Hishov was a good man and what happened to him shouldn’t be taken so lightly!”
Dean halted before the bar as the lyrics faded into the final strums of the melody, and the man turned around with the hot pan in hand.
A cursory glance around for the faucet yielded nothing, but the moment he stepped up into the shower, the redlight shuddered just a bit and the water kicked on in the center, falling from the ceiling like a warm torrent of fat dropped rain. He blinked in surprise as he tested the temperature with the palm of his hand before deeming it adequate and stepping beneath it.
Dean’s arms immediately crossed, his chest tight with apprehension and...something else. Something bitter and spiteful. It was difficult to concentrate.
“My mother will not believe this.” Sonia continued on in english. “But I can assure you that if you need aid, you have mine and Evan’s support.”
He paused, momentarily surprised at himself. When had he decided that he wanted Cas to find out at all?
“Look man, I’m sorry, but uh--” He began in a rush, swiftly ducking out from between the workbench and the other man to avoid being pinned. He shuffled back toward the bike, running a hand through his hair to ground himself. This was getting out of hand, he needed to do something.
After he had regained control of his temper, Dean had continued to survey the crime scene. He was in the process of examining two weird oblong discs of metal which were stuck in the thin seems between the white bricks that made up the pathway, when he felt a sudden sense of urgency tingle up the back of his skull. He shot back to his feet like a bullet and turned just in time to witness Castiel’s knee’s buckle.
like a violin or something.” It felt odd describing the appearance of a sound, but the hunter couldn’t think of another way to say it. Cas nodded along as if he understood, so he added, “It
Sam was impressed to say the least. Evan had been right about her; she was resilient and calm in the face of information that would have overwhelmed anyone else. “Not exactly, but it's close enough.” He replied.
Then Dean was leaning in, while applying gentle pressure to the back of Cas’s neck, guiding him forward.
The mere thought of the angel worrying about his well being had the hunter up in arms again; he was going to get some answers out of this bastard even if he had to cut them out in pieces.
After hanging up, Dean flipped his phone shut and twirled it a few times between his thumb and forefinger, feeling giddy and lighter than he had in a while. Cas wasn’t just waiting around for him to come back, he was
“It’s potent magic.” Sam insisted, “When Rowena used it other witches could pick up on it if she wasn’t careful. Who’s to say whether or not this other you could sense it too? If he finds you looking in on them he could move Dean again, or hurt him or--”
A little less than an hour later, just as the sun had begun to dip in the sky, Dean pulled the Impala into a secluded spot just outside the park where the Heaven's gate sigil was hidden a sandbox. As the three men exited the car, Dean took note of the two children still ambling about on the brightly colored play structures. With dusk fast approaching, he could only assume that the unattended kids were in fact angels guarding the gate. When the brothers and Cas got near enough, the kid’s game of chase came to an abrupt halt and the pair, one dark-skinned boy of about fifteen and one knobby-kneed girl near twelve, turned in eerily perfect synchronicity to observe their approach.
“It kinda sounded like you were singing.” Dean marveled as if he hadn’t heard Cas speak, his ears still faintly buzzing from the strange resonance of the lyrical language. It was the same sort of internal vibration he had felt earlier only way less intense. “My ears are still ringing.”
“But…” Castiel seemed to falter, his eyes narrow with an expression that was pained, as though Dean were telling him these things just to hurt him. “You’re human.”
With a look of question, Sam reached for the medallion, holding it between his thumb and forefinger when she nodded her permission. It was about the size and shape of a silver dollar, but the pair of arrowheads pointing in opposite directions to create a six point star was unmistakable.
Without really thinking, the hand perched on the angel’s shoulder slid down to grasp his forearm in a comforting gesture of reassurance.
“Sorry I’ve only been hunched over ancient Canaanite all day.” Sam retorted testily, lugging the duffle into the back seat next to the cooler and bag Dean had already arranged back there. “I also took some pictures of the scrolls and packed up the lore books just in case.”
Dean's eyes widened with shell shocked recognition as a bone deep chill settled into him from the tips of his toes to the skin under the angel’s fingers.
Okay. So he was trapped there. Fan-fucking-tastic. And his captor was some psycho angel who thought he was Cas from another dimension. Crazy as it sounded, Dean thought back to the drugged out miserable human altar of Cas he’d met almost a decade ago, then to more recently to the alters of Charlie and Bobby and...Michael...from the Apocalypse world.
“You are a terrible liar.” She muttered as she poked and prodded around the edges of the bruise, drawing sharp inhales and gasps from the angel to prove her point. “How you have managed to keep such secrets for so long is beyond me.”
“I came to this world to find and protect you.” The angel began, drawing the hunter’s attention again despite his small internal crisis. “To prevent what happened to the man I...knew...from happening to you.”
Until his eyes landed on Harut. His intense obsidian eyes were fixated directly on Dean. It was only for a moment before the older hunter looked away trying with all his might to make it look like a natural sweep of the room, but in his heart, he knew it had looked like anything but.
Steam slid enticingly down the small of his back like the hot breath of a lover. The temperature of the water rose once again, the bite of it licking at his heels and calves. More steam rose in rolling clouds, curling up around his thighs and over the lobes of his ass, clinging to him and the glass until the world around him was completely obscured.
“The symbols transcribed in the sigil are unfamiliar to me and Harut indicated that even Heaven’s remaining archivists had no information about their origins or any way to translate their meaning which is...disconcerting.” He paused for just a moment before turning his head to look at Hannah directly. “I assume that every other scene was identical to this one?”
“Yeah.” Sam replied before continuing, “None of the money or any valuables were taken so the police are unclear on motive. What could be salvaged from the security video footage shows the killer riding an unlicensed 1967 BSA Thunderbolt in the middle of a flash thunderstorm and entered the lobby where he exchanged words with the victim."
“Why?” She implored sadly, her expression slipping for the first time from the stern stone mask of brevity. “Why kill him? He was a good man!”
“Yes Dean, I know.” The angel snapped with a sardonic bite, whipping his head away from the hunter almost spitefully. “My safety is paramount to the success of this investigation.”
"Hold on," Sam spoke up, using the mouse to rewind the footage a few seconds before tapping a key to pause it just before it cut to black. "Look at that!"
Blessedly, the angel’s eyes dropped to the plate and beers in the hunter’s hands and he spoke first to break the tension.
“Everything okay?” Sam asked, eyeing his brother with thinly veiled concern as he fell into step beside him.
When he finds Dean bleeding on the floor of the living room, panic, sharp and white-hot, floods his veins.
“Get the FUCK out of my head.” Dean spat furiously, puffing up and managing to look somewhat threatening despite still only being half dressed. The presence in his mind instantly backed off.
he could think about Cas a bit more than he probably should but it didn't mean anything so long as everything stayed platonic. He could justify thinking about wrapping his arms around the angel, he’d actually done just that on a number of occasions, but if fantasy Dean's hands began to wonder, he’d force the thought away. He could envision the angel poofing into his personal space, but quickly found something to distract himself if the imaginary Cas leaned in too close for comfort.
Dean grit his teeth against the emotion welling up in his chest, using every impact to force it back down. When his vision began to blur, he picked up the pace. Knees and elbows and feet and fists landed in rhythmic succession striking with enough force to make the chain above him whine and groan. He kept it up even when his lungs stung with every panting breath and his skin was scratched raw. Only when the muscles in his limbs began to tremble uncontrollably and the canvas bag was slick with blood did he finally stop. By then whatever tears there might have been were so mingled with the sweat dripping from his brow no one would have been able to distinguish the two.
Dean held his tongue, giving a nervous scoff to cover the hysterics threatening to shake him loose. “Figure of speech man.” He remarked shakily before turning to set the plate on a nearby workbench and collect himself. He turned back, keeping his eyes low, and extended one of the beers toward the angel. “Look just humor me, okay?”
Outside, the rain had let up, but thunder still quaked in the distance. The drifter mounted his bike, kicked the stand back into place and stepped on the ignition all in one fluid, well-practiced motion. The machine roared to life, deafening in the silence left in the wake of all that had occurred. It purred long and low as he pushed off, speeding away from the Blue Mermaid in a streak of black.
“Be silent Marut,” Harut hissed in warning, sensing Castiel’s mounting impatience for his companion.
The angel released a quiet sigh of relief. Both brothers were safe and sleeping soundly. This time, he did smile as he looked on and thought that perhaps he should be resting as well. He was about to turn away to leave and do just that when his sensitive ears caught a small breathy sound from the bed. He glanced back toward the sleeping hunter who had shifted just a bit, not sure if he had heard correctly. The angel’s mouth went dry as he watched the muscles of Dean’s bare back roll and settle into the new position.
The resulting darkness was pierced only by a final bolt of lightning that streaked across the pitch colored sky. The manager’s face had gone several sickening shades of splotchy purple, while his left eye bulged and swelled crimson in its socket. When the attacker finally released him, the large man hit the floor with a bloody squelching sound, his head lolling to one side at an unnatural angle.
“Higher dimension, yeah you said that, but what does that actually mean?” Dean snapped with more than a little agitation, and tacked on, “in plain English,” just for good measure.
“Because I don’t want you to be next, alright?!” Dean bellowed without thinking, the swell of accompanying emotion in his chest so powerful it was on par with the sensations he’d experienced in Heaven and for one surreal second it was as though they had switched places and Cas was the one seemingly overwhelmed, his expression one of shocked awe. Dean took advantage of the distraction and leaned just a bit into the angel’s personal space, twisting his fingers into the sleeve of his trench coat. In a low, urgent tone he continued, “Look, the only thing we know about this son of a bitch is that it preys on angels! So sue me if I think maybe we should take our only angel to a safe place while we regroup and figure this shit out!”
“Thank you sir!” Evan responded with a grateful huff of breath. “Please excuse my--uh--nerves. I’m new to the force, just finished my training a few weeks ago. I’d never been in the field before...before--”
"Oh yeah. Apocalypse World 1: Zombieland  and the sequel: Return of Michael. Both sucked. Giant Shadowy Monster world; also sucked."
The moment the car parked, Sam was such a flurry of long limbs as he scrambled to escape the uncomfortable interior that he nearly collided directly with Jack who had come over from across the road to meet him.
“Damnedest thing I’ve ever seen.” Briggs continued. “It was like the devil himself reached out of hell and crushed the life out of the guy.”
For a moment, the angel looked beyond lost and exhausted, but then he rolled his shoulders and it was replaced by a resolute determination that made Dean’s heart beat a little faster. “I don’t know, but she said that there were crime scenes to investigate, so we should find those.”
With his chest still heaving, Dean suddenly broke away from the bag still swaying from the force of his assault and stormed off toward the showers. He cranked the hot water first as high as it would go before adjusting the cold and then stepped back into the locker room to pull off the sweatpants now damp with sweat and drops of blood. As he turned back he paused when he caught sight of himself in one of the steadily fogging full-length mirrors.
Sam stepped inside and the Sheriff rose to greet him, extending his hand over his desk. The hunter shook it firmly, “Sheriff Briggs, Agent Scholtz.”
“A twenty mile radius is better than 8400.” Jack remarked, “And even though it was brief, Cas said that Dean’s prayer came from the center of the forest and now we know there’s a large lake and how far away from any city it is. If we add it all together, we should be able to get an approximate location!”
Castiel slumped forward, his forehead pressing heavily against Dean’s shoulder but his stunned brain barely registered the hunter’s arms around him. His head swam with a sudden rush of dizziness, while the unpleasant sensation of nausea churned in his stomach. He squeezed his eyes shut, turning his face just slightly inward toward the crook of Dean’s neck, inhaling the hunter’s familiar scent with slow deep breaths to ground himself.
The slice in his foot throbbed as well and he hobbled out of the closet, gingerly setting the picture on the window bench seat. A quick glance around the room revealed he was still very much alone, though he couldn’t help but feel as if he were being watched. After a moment of consideration, he made his way over to the other door. The wet squelch of blood under each step was beyond uncomfortable.
“Don’t be.” Castiel replied, “It's just...been  a long time since anyone has asked.” He paused a moment, running a hand reverently over the dark leather seat. “He did help me. Truth be told, he did most of the work, now I just maintain it. When we found it, he said it was just the bare bones collecting rust under a heap of junk in Bobby Singer’s scrap yard.”
A bandage would make it more obvious. What he needed was a distraction. His head immediately threw up the angel's note.
The room was cabin-like, the floor, the walls, even the bed frame all rich aged wood while directly across from him a small fireplace stood out in slate grey cobblestone. All the materials inside were matched in rich cool palettes that fit the misty coniferous scenery outside the window.
He spent a final moment watching his hunter in peaceful sleep before finally pushing himself up off the bed and exiting the room. He brushed passed the dark phantom leering at the pair of them from just outside the doorway, firmly pulling the door closed behind him to keep its filthy gaze off of Dean.
He noticed the scars first, because how could he not?  Angry dark lines cutting across otherwise pristine skin. He felt the absurd need to brush his fingers over them, not quite convinced they were real but was too overcome with shock to move.
“тише, милый мальчик (hush, sweet boy)” Sonia tutted with calming hand on Evan’s arm, stilling his escalating agitation. The young man quieted instantly though his expression remained wide eyed and perturbed. To Cas she said, “My mother was correct then, the thing that killed Viktor was an angel of death?”
“Damn,” Sam cursed before gesturing to the bed and accompanying personal effects. “So he talked to you, then came back to bed, but judging by the state of everything, there was no struggle and…” He trailed off for a moment as he moved to the side of the bed and tossed Dean’s used pillow to the side, finding his gun still laying there. He scooped it up and checked the clip to confirm his suspicion. “Yeah, full clip still. If Dean woke up to a random angel in our room, all hell would have broken loose.”
Sam was still snoring noisily and drooling into his pillow when Dean returned. The older hunter shook his head fondly at the sight, tossing his phone onto his duffle bag as he passed it. Peeling the thin sheet and blanket back, Dean curled back into his own bed, squirming around until he finally settled on his back. He sighed at length to relax and sank into the mattress.
Once anchored, Dean pulled him in and kissed him with a fervor that left the angel dazed. Forgetting the spirit entirely, the entire universe narrowed down to Dean’s mouth moving against his own, the point of contact so warm and insistent that the angel lost himself in it completely.
A clap of thunder loud enough to rattle the kitchen windows startled the hunter out of his own head, causing him to knock his coffee mug over. With a clatter and a curse, the hot liquid splashed down over his shirt and thighs. He shot up from the stool in the same moment that Castiel bolted around the bar, rag back in hand.
It’s sounded so casual, so natural and unassuming, but Cas could feel that it was a front and he felt surprisingly...hurt.
Castiel immediately sobered at the mention of the other angel, his posture going rigid and uncomfortable. Dean could practically hear the walls go up as the energy between them became tense once again, though the angel did give a small hum and nod in acknowledgment as he took another bite.
Was he going to hulk out now when he got angry...or at least more than he already did now with the Mark?
His stomach fell through the floor as he considered his companions. Sam would have likely woken up to find him gone without a trace and he wasn’t sure exactly how much time had passed, but he knew his little brother would have gotten a hold of Cas by now.
“Then it’s decided.” Sonia chirped with a clap of her hands, “We’ll leave first thing in the morning.”
“Check this out.” She commented with a note of giddiness as she reached her own gloved hands toward the cadaver’s chin. With little effort due to the state of Hishov’s neck, she was able to tilt his head back to reveal what Sam recognized instantly as the burn mark Briggs had mentioned. His eyes widened as he took in the shape.
Cursing loudly, Dean whirled back around, nearly toppling Sam over in his haste, glaring holes into the intruder. The slim lanky stranger who had spoken, along with a broader bearded companion, occupied the space between them and Cas which Dean was sure had been empty mere moments beforehand. They were both donned in matching pale grey suits, pristinely clean and sharply cut.
Castiel could feel his entire being rejecting what his eyes were showing him. His rational mind raced, grasping for any other possibility, desperate for another explanation other than the one that his instincts knew to be undeniable.
The moment his boots made contact with the glass, the sound abruptly ceased, and the air around him seemed to rush passed as if the visual shimmer was sucked back to where it had been seeping. The silence and the detectable change in pressure of the room left Dean feeling absurdly empty.
“No. Before.” When Dean’s brows furrowed together in confusion, Cas explained further, “When we followed after the escort and you lingered behind. I was...less than pleased about the situation. I knew that Hannah wouldn’t have risked you both for a trivial matter, but her lack of forthright information was...annoying." He trailed off, and if Dean hadn’t known better, he’d have thought the angel looked embarrassed. “Besides that, I was worried about how being physically in Heaven would affect you. I had asked you to risk it, so if anything happened to you it would have been my fault. Suffice to say I was frustrated and I...cursed...rather loudly.”
What did Cas like? In this state, it would have to be simple. Dean stewed on the question for a moment, glaring daggers of the door of the garage on the back wall to his right, before it hit him.
There was a pregnant pause which left the question hanging awkwardly in the air while Hannah seemed to flounder, tugging distractedly at her shirt cuffs, and voiding eye contact with any of them. Finally, she seemed to find her resolve, and she folded her hands over her desk to address them directly.
His heart thumped wildly in his chest, pumping hot blood in every direction as he squeezed his eyes shut to will the feeling away, but this only proved to amplify the imagery.
“You alright Cas?” Dean whispered urgently, his eyes still adjusting to the dark of the room trying to identify his friend’s expression but he was still too shrouded in shadow.
“Tell me what I need to know and there won’t be any,” the stranger fired back. He then turned his attention to the check-in book, methodically flipping it open and swiping a few pages aside. He scanned over the names and then one black-gloved finger fell to a point near the top of a page. “Here.” He hissed at the manager. “Rose and Hudson; I need to know when they checked out.”
The corner of Dean's mouth twitched into a small fond smile before instantly falling as he remembered why he'd called in the first place.
“Dean’s right Cas,” Sam spoke up, approaching them with his pistol still drawn from his perimeter check. Dean stepped back to a respectable distance, but his hand didn’t drop from the angel’s coat sleeve and Sam pretended not to notice. “We don’t know anywhere close to enough about this thing to go after it. We don’t even know how it gets from point A to B or where it goes once it’s got its prey." When Cas still seemed resistant, Sam holstered his weapon and raised his phone for the angel to see. “Look, I’ve documented this entire area and took enough notes while we were upstairs to get us started on the research end. Hannah said angels disappearing has happened before, so let's head back to the bunker and crack into the lore so we can figure out what we’re dealing with. Once we get a foot hold, we’ll be able to make a plan of attack.”
The images flashed across his mind like slides on a reel, memories from a life that wasn’t his despite how he saw each of them through his own eyes.
It had escalated from there. Now, for the better part of the last few months, Dean had been playing at the edges of thoughts and fantasies that he definitely could not justify any man having about their best friend, but still quickly stifled them before they crossed the line he’d drawn from himself. Okay, sure
“We’ll ride with Sam in the impala. Scottsbluff is less than three hours away.” Cas insisted, dropping a reassuring hand onto Jack’s shoulder.
Castiel turned to watch the hunter, following his movements with cautious calculating eyes when it dawned on Dean; he was looking for tells. He knew something was off, but he didn’t know what; probably assumed it was nerves. However, before he even had a chance to worry about it, the solemn expression on the angel’s face lifted and his entire aura brightened at the hunter’s interest. He followed Dean’s example, set aside his sandwich, wiped his hands on his jeans, and followed suit almost giddily.
The image of Cas sprinting away from him in a panic and the sound of his broken voice while he called after the missing angels were still so vividly etched into his brain that it made his heart race just recalling it. When the angel had confided in him what the energy ebbing off the sigil had felt like, the horrified revulsion and utter devastation in his voice had been palpable. Sam had definitely hit the nail on the head earlier; pair up all that with not being able to do anything about it, and Dean could practically hear the angel’s self-loathing like the heart-wrenching whine of violin strings.
“There are three large lakes in the area our first spell indicated Dean could be.” Sam stated, while Jack came to peer over his shoulder. The nephilim circled the area Cas had instructed him to reach his senses out to with his finger, indicating where the prayer had originated, narrowing it down to two lakes.
“Sure thing Jody.” Dean agreed, “Now you were saying you wanted to run something by us? You got a case?”
“So...you came here to stop it from happening to me?” Dean asked haltingly, feeling that this was obviously going to be a touch and go subject.
“Not so fast.” Sonia chided, placing enough pressure on the ice pack to keep the angel in his seat. “First of all, it’s nearly evening. A drive up to the Black Hills from here will be a few hours. By the time you got there it would be dark and you are injured--”
Dean’s stomach dropped through the floor. The paper slipped from his fingers as he staggered away from the desk. The potential of what it all meant hit him like a physical blow, knocking the breath out of him as his head began to swim.
“Look,” Dean began again, trying his best to sound gentle despite his own growing exhaustion fed irritation, “I get it, okay? You’re feeling less than useless sitting on your hands here. You wanna be out there doing the leg work. The research bit has always been more Sam’s department, and as much as I want to leave him to it, and follow you out there to gank the son of a bitch doing all of this, we just
Pushing it aside for the time being and focusing on what was immediately in front of him, Dean pulled out all the essentials and turned to leave, only to freeze in place as his eyes fell on the other side of the closet.
Sam was from far convinced but his brother's tone and body language had created a wall he wasn't going to get through, at least not right now. Satisfied that Dean at least seemed alright, he played along for the time being.
That was the mantra in his head as he made his way back into the bunker proper. He stalked back to his room, his footfalls loud and he made no attempt to quiet them. He felt irritated and strung out despite his exhaustion and it was pissing him off. After this shitty fucking day, he wanted nothing more than to sink into that beautiful memory foam and pass out into oblivion for a few hours but the closer he got to his room, the more tension he felt. The mark on his arm seared. He saw red at the edges of his vision. There was anger--there was always anger when the mark was involved--but there was something else too and when finally his door came into view, he felt so tightly wound he thought would snap.
They’d done it a few times when Sam was still young. John would pull off in a field out in the middle of nowhere to catch a few winks in the car, and Dean would toss out an old moth-eaten blanket and they would sprawl together to watch the clouds. He wondered with sleepy nostalgia if his little brother remembered those few fleeting moments of peace stolen cat napping in the sun.
When Dean finally willed his eyes open, a blurry but familiar face was hovering above his own. The hunter blinked hard several times to clear his vision. It felt like he’d just gone through the human equivalent of a hard reset. His hand came up automatically to inspect his head where he’d been injured when his fingers brushed over the ones still pressed against him.
“Hannah contacted me,” Cas answered as he leaned forward and braced both hands on the lip of the bench seat. “She’s been dealing with some sort of situation in Heaven and has requested our presence to assist in an investigation.”
“Open up ‘Agent Scholtz’!” Came a loud skeptical female voice through the door. “Or should I say, ‘Agent Con Man’. I know you aren’t FBI and I
paying attention despite his upset. Their eyes locked in the reflection and for just a breath Dean observed some sort of tension in the angel’s posture before those crystalline irises shifted to the right to address Sam.
He had suspected something like this would happen ever since he’d received the first intonation of grace in the brother’s shared hotel room. Jack hadn’t been able to make the connection the same way because the energy hadn’t resonated with his own the way it had done for Cas. To him, it felt as though he himself had popped in to check on Dean in the night as he had done many times before.
Dean stiffened in surprise before pushing himself up onto his elbows. He squinted at the face cloaked in shadow, just barely making out the glint of blue eyes in the dark.
“My apologies,” the angel replied contritely, but his expression shifted from apologetic to earnest urgency a moment later. “But I needed to speak to you both immediately.”
"It's because it's me." Cas explained between panting breaths, straightening his posture from his hunched position against the car. "I have warding that makes me invisible to other angels."
Before Cas could say a word she was up and trotting off to the bathroom, asking Sam briefly to hand a few items through the door from the cabinets before coming back to the living area with a bottle of alcohol, a bag of cotton balls and a swatch of bandages.
Then Mrs. Ivanovna froze in the hallway, the large brown eyes she shared with her daughter suddenly going wide and horror stricken, before she suddenly released a blood curdling shriek, startling everyone. She scrambled backward, nearly tripping over herself in her haste to get away, all the while gesturing wildly at Castiel.
Cas and Sam both shot astonished looks at the older hunter, but Sam was the first to speak. “Wow, really?” he inquired enthusiastically. “Mine aren't, what’s up with that? Cas, is that one of the perception things we were just talking about?”
“If we are to learn anything about what this toxin has to do with our missing brothers and sisters, a criminal’s discomfort is of little consequence.” There was a slight sneer in the angel’s tone as if daring the hunter to challenge him. It worked as intended, igniting the elder Winchester’s outrage to full-blown fury.
“Son of a bitch!” He hissed between his teeth as he teetered back but didn’t fall. Stooping down, he retrieved the photo from the ruined frame, carefully avoiding the now bloody shards of glass.
Sam recoiled at the announcement, recalling the earlier exchange with Gretchen, and was about to voice his protest when Evan himself came trotting back down the entryway and over the curb to address them.
“But--” The bearded angel made to protest, but a sharp glare from his brother brought him up short, and he fell back into place with a few short peevish tugs at his suit collar.
“Bullshit!” Dean yelled angrily, “I’ve seen him, your Dean! Charred black holes for eyes right?! It don’t take a rocket scientist to figure out how that happened!”
Castiel was quiet for a long time, long enough that Dean eventually gave up his avoidance and looked up. To his bewilderment, the angel was facing away leaning over the workbench. His hands gripped the edges hard enough that the metal had formed to the shape of them. His head hung low, dark curls obscuring his face. His chest and back expanded and fell with deep focused breaths like he was trying to control himself.
“Don’t fucking patronize me.” Dean spat at him, “You think I’m going to just roll over and play nice because you healed me and cooked a meal? We-” He gestured between them with the blade, “--are not friends. I don’t
The hunter stared at the steam curling up from the mug, not sure how to gauge the strange apprehension he felt that this guy knew exactly how he made his own coffee…
She pinched the soft skin behind his upper arm through his shirt sleeve, startling a pained yelp from him.
At least he’s getting some rest. Sam thought bittersweetly as he stepped silently over the threshold to toss a nearby blanket over his brother.
Dean looked between his brother and Cas with a skeptical squint. They had to be conspiring to confuse him. He was sure Sam would break character at any moment and dissolve into a fit of giggles for having gotten his brother to go along with the 'Heaven is the Matrix' shpeal, but when both men remained resolute, the older hunter pinched at the bridge of his nose to stave off the headache he was sure was coming on.
After a moment of deliberation, he shook himself out of it and decided the safest thing he could do for the time being was to keep his head down and bide his time. Strange as the guy was, he didn’t seem to be of the mind to hurt him; he’d even said he’d taken him to ‘
He tried not to think of all the stupid desperate shit Cas had done with the best intentions in mind, and couldn’t help but wonder if this was something like that. He’d said his Dean had lost himself and been killed and that he was trying to save him from the same fate…
“So,” Cas intoned harsher than necessary but his head felt light and dizzy again the more he thought about it and the anger grounded him, “Grace is an ethereal energy Dean; a wavelength, a vibration of light particles. That...substance...was liquefied grace. Something forced it to congeal like human blood.”
Sam scrubbed his hair away from his face to better see, only for his eyes to fall on his brother’s empty bed. He jolted upright at the sight of the blanket tossed back and the sheets rumpled, but his brother nowhere to be seen
Dean all but fell through the door into the kitchen in his haste. He had no way of knowing how soon the angel could return given his enhanced power so he fought vehemently against his own body’s sluggishness, completely unaware he was being watched with rapt attention. His focus was singular. He needed supplies; water and weapons..
They had stopped briefly at a gas n sip somewhere along highway 26 so Sam and Jack could change into suits, but it was just a short time later when he was pulling into a parking space in front of the Scottsbluff police department.
Castiel had been a seasoned warrior long before human beings had even existed. He had seen grace in every terrible way an angel could see it; expelled by force, corrupted by darkness, burned away in holy fire, torn asunder on the celestial plane and ripped apart upon entering the earth’s atmosphere...but in all of his existence, he had never seen anything like this.
“Disappearances?” Cas asked leaning forward, clearly not expecting that explanation. “You’re saying that some angels have gone missing?”
As uncomfortable as it made him feel, getting in close with this Cas was looking more and more like the only viable option. So far as the angel knew, the hunter was unaware of the memory alteration and if Dean played his cards right, he might be able to use that to his advantage. If he could get the guy to open up a little, wheedle some more of his story out of him he might be able to appeal to his better nature, assuming he had one, or at the very least, distract him long enough to get some sort of word out to the
“Could I get a map with all the cities hit by this guy?” When the Sheriff gave him a questioning look, Sam was quick to add, “For on hand reference? My partner left with our copy.”
With his head bowed low, the first sob slipped passed his lips with his hands twisting to fists against the tile.
He was considering all the possible answers he could receive when he caught the angel’s attention drop down to track the movement of his mouth without shame. Stunned, Dean tore his hand away from his face to grab his discarded fork and began pushing the remnants of the meal around on the plate as a distraction from the color blooming across his cheeks. The heat in that stormy gaze was unmistakable. He felt naked under such scrutiny and he squirmed uncomfortably in his seat.
The first thing to strike him were the two story windows taking up the entire front of the house that looked out over the breathtaking view of a dark freshwater lake, and more mountainous forest beyond it. Blinking rapidly to clear is vision lest he was seeing things, Dean lowered his gaze to the room below.
The image frozen on-screen was full of static and lines, but behind it, Dean could just barely make out the bottom half of both figures at the top of the screen. Despite being on the opposite side of the counter only seconds before, the killer had the manager pinned several inches off the floor up against the wall. The speed with which he had moved was definitely not human. Dean stared hard at the computer screen, suddenly awake and alert despite his earlier exhaustion. He tried not to think about it too hard but he couldn’t shake the dread settling like a rock in the pit of his stomach.
Dean blinked rapidly as his heart tripped back to life, a pitchy, “Yeah, sure,” falling past his lips. When Cas eyed him strangely, the hunter added in a rush, “Just seemed like the right thing to do.” He then promptly shoved his injured hand in his pocket and hoped it looked like nerves.
Scrambling into action, Dean all but sprinted from the room, fleeing the scene of his trespass. He reached the kitchen without the memory of having gotten there. In three long strides, he found himself at the sink and wrenched the cold water on and stuck his throbbing hand beneath the cool spray. As the terrible burn was momentary quelled, Dean took the opportunity to examine the brand.
“Not a guest, but one of the maids, Katarina Ivanovna, was doing laundry just down the hall from the lobby, heard voices and saw the whole thing go down. Poor woman must have been scared out of her mind because the description she gave didn’t make a lick of sense.”
Her demeanor had completely shifted, her hand coming to rest comfortingly on Cas’s forearm just as she had done with Evan. “Успокой свою бурю, Сын Божий (Calm your storm, Son of God.).” She murmured with a sad smile. “Ваша любовь с осветит путь обратно к нему (Your love will light the way back to him.).”
The hunter visibly tensed, tearing his eyes away from his friend to run a cursory glance around the scene before coming back to Cas, “It looks like a devil’s trap but the writing’s different. I haven’t seen anything like it. Do you know what it means?”
At the far end of the office opposite them, Hannah, who had stood in greeting upon their entrance, now gestured to the three identical white chairs in front of her desk. Cas took the far left seat, Sam the far right, which left Dean to suffer the center, facing Hannah directly. He made a valiant attempt, he really did, to keep the scowl off his face, but judging by the flicker of impatience on her own, he hadn’t succeeded.
His glare could have melted steel, but the moment Dean squared his shoulders to stand at his full height, Castiel stepped directly between him and the giant prick before the hunter had a chance to punch the bastard in his stupid furry face. The angel quelled whatever escalating thoughts were bouncing around in the hunter’s brain with a solid hand on his chest.
No matter what he said, or how close he seemed in the moment, this man wasn’t Cas. He couldn’t trust him. He also couldn’t make that obvious. The guy’s sanity seemed to be hanging on Dean’s reactions. His jaw tensed as he plated the toasted bread, the burn on his hand providing clarity through pain where it worked near the heat.
There was a faint flicker at the corner of the angel’s mouth that didn’t quite quirk upwards, but Dean felt the muscles beneath his hand relax and took that as a good sign. They held that gaze until Cas’s eyes flickered down to where Dean was still touching him, unconsciously tracing small circles over the angel’s wrist bone with the pad of his thumb. As if just realizing what he was doing, Dean snatched his hand away, returning it to the fold of his arms across his chest and looked decidedly anywhere else but at Cas.
Every muscle in his body was pulled taught like a bow string, ready to snap, but the demon’s skilled fingers kept him right on the knife’s edge.
The echo of Cas’s earlier words on the phone hit Dean hard, and before he could stop himself he was circling his arms firmly around the angel’s back, pulling him in tight against his chest. Cas grasped at him all the harder, his entire frame trembling beneath the hunter’s touch. Running with the sudden burst of courage, Dean turned his head and nuzzled into the angel’s hair.
Ironically, it had been all the personal effects they had slathered in lamb's blood at their fake altar before they ‘drank the kool-aid’ so to speak; a few gothic-looking pieces of jewelry, some creepy black and white photos, a copy of Catcher in the Rye…It would have been darkly comical if the reality hadn’t been so sad: they were just bored depressed kids looking for meaning and purpose. When the hunters had finally slumped into the car, more than ready to head back to the motel, it was just rounding 2 PM and the air between them was heavy and solemn. None of the spirits had been older than Jack; well, at least no older than he physically appeared to be. It was a sobering thought that made them both feel protective, especially considering Jack’s own search for purpose.
Dean glanced briefly over Cas’s features, lingering minutely his stormy eyes, before breaking the circuit of their touch and turning away with a scoffed, “Whatever you say.”
Sonia gently guided him into an embrace, cradling his head against her shoulder, muttering sweet reassurances to him. She caught movement in her periphery, her eyes darting over to find Sam frozen in the hallway connecting to the back bedroom and bathroom, his own eyes glossy and wide with shock.
“Well that’s just fan-freaking-tastic,” Dean retorted grimly, nervously fingering the coin in his pocket.
It was a picturesque family room, complete with dark leather couches and sleek modern lights. Another, larger, grey stone fireplace occupied the wall to the right framed by two thinner but equally tall windows. The air out there on the balcony overlooking the room was substantially warmer thanks to the billowing fire crackling cheerfully behind the silver grate.
She also described him wearing a bike helmet and black leather, which was corroborated by the video footage. But then…” He trailed off briefly, like he was preparing himself for what he was about to say. When he finally spoke again, Sam could tell he was trying to remain neutral despite his own skepticism. “She said he was an ‘angel of death’. Wouldn’t stop ranting about seeing black wings and holy light. Then she claimed she saw his eyes ‘flash ghost white’ right before all the glass and equipment exploded.”
The hunter’s breath caught in his throat as he took in the sight. The angel was absent the black button up he’d been wearing earlier, a tight black undershirt in its place.
Once the hunter beneath his hands was stabilized, Castiel promptly delved into his mind to wipe away what had just occurred only to discover more than he bargained for.
For a moment it looked as though the young man would argue further but after briefly meeting his father’s eyes, he seemed to deflate. He then shifted his eyes to Sam and nodded once in acceptance.
he was despite glaring differences. His hair was still the same dark unruly mess it always was, just longer, hanging loose around his ears and forehead and neck in soft curls that made the imploring expression of his face seem more open and believable than it had any right to be.
She gave him a small smile, and waved him over. He seemed to hesitate, unsure for a moment before he steeled himself and cleared his throat to make his presence known. Cas pulled back from the girl, sniffling and brushing the moisture on his face away as Sam came to sit on the sofa kiddy corner to them.
Several long moments passed in silence wherein Cas seemed to resume his hunched position on the bench and clasped his hands lightly together between his knees while he bowed his head forward. If he was praying, Dean pretended to be none the wiser. What he couldn’t pretend not to notice though, was the faint whisper of chiming bells that ghosted like phantom fingers over his forearms, his throat, his cheeks, his lips...
The confession was little more than a whisper, but Dean knew the message had gotten across when he felt Cas’s fingers twist into the back of his shirt. They stood there wrapped up in one another for a few long minutes before Dean gently pulled at the angel’s shoulders to ease him back. He went with little resistance, but his head remained tipped forward, hiding his face. Dean bobbed his head in an attempt to catch the angel’s eyes. When it didn't work, he lifted his hand to tilt his chin up.
The candle holder clattering to the floor shattered the stillness, causing the stranger with Cas’s face to jump, nearly dropping the steaming pan in his hand.
Holding the wrist of his injured hand firmly with the other, the hunter gingerly turned his palm up. Dean cursed under a shuddering breath as he realized the symbol was now clearly branded there, the raised red lines of it so angry and vicious that painful tears pricked at the corners of his eyes.
Cas and Sam exchanged mutual looks of bewilderment before the younger Winchester turned to face Sonia with an earnest air, his hands up in surrender.
There was another pause on the other end like she was deciding whether or not to believe him before Jody spoke again.
Dean’s eyes narrowed clearly understanding that this was not a good thing, but still didn’t seem to grasp why. “Okay? So--?”
Dean swallowed nervously, unable to look the guy in the eye after such a  declaration. He cleared his throat again as he took a single step back out of the angel's touch.
“He does, but doesn’t appear to be threatened.” Cas replied gruffly, cradling his left arm over his chest to keep it immobile. “He told me to ‘Give up’ because Dean was ‘his’.”
Dean dropped a hand to the angel’s shoulder and physically made him turn to face him. “Cas man, you gotta promise me, okay? Promise me you aren’t going to disappear on me as soon as I look the other way.” When the angel still didn’t lift his head, Dean closed his eyes and used the last weapon in his arsenal.
“We also examined the sigil found on Eden’s northern access pathway.” He stated evenly, his voice rough but carefully devoid of the emotion Dean had heard earlier, “It turned out to be the source of the corrupted energy signature. The sigil itself was written in liquified angelic grace.”
His eyes widened as he took in the two distinct sides, the frame slipping out of his hand and clattering to the floor. The strike of metal on wood and cracking glass was loud in the silence but he barely noticed it as he looked on in awe.
It had looked to Dean as though the men who built the place had been trying to cover all their bases, just in case.
“I feel it too.” Jack confirmed, though he was looking suspiciously around the room instead of at Sam.
An unexpected wave of heat rolled over him at the implications of that, followed promptly by a sharp stab of shame. He bit his lip against the knee jerk response to the thoughts but instead of pushing them away as he had so many times before, he allowed himself to rifle through them. He meandered from image to image until he hovered shyly around the intense memory of their ‘almost kiss’, never looking at it directly as a whole, but recalling the sensations one at a time.
“We’ll need to take a look at those.” Sam stated, interrupting the climbing tension, “And Hannah, just so I can start building a timeline; exactly how many angels have gone missing?”
Castiel had lingered in the chapel for a long while after Dean had left. He felt as though he had been drawn and quartered for all the twists and turns his nerves had taken over the course of the day. The angel pressed his face into his hands, the sandpaper scrape of his stubble biting into his palms helping to ground him.
The faint whisper of strings drifted back into Dean’s ears, along with the cool tingling essence whose presence the hunter could only visually detect now by a faint reflective ripple. He swallowed thickly while he attempted to ignore it.
It felt incredibly surreal to note that the candle holder he’d lifted in self defense earlier that day had been returned to its original position on the side table near the stairs as though it had never been moved at all, and as he passed he had the obscure fleeting sense that it hadn’t been the only thing reset.
“It’s not much but I know that-- ” Dean began lamely before a strange sort of sniffling sound from the angel gave him pause. It took him a second longer to realize it was a stifled sob. Above them, the lights hummed loudly, the light pulsing brighter in time with his shuddering breath.
The creature, now standing at its full height under the high ceiling of the library, turned it’s face to Dean. Right side up it looked almost like a man, extremely emaciated, with black leathery skin pulled tight over bone. Its whole body was gaunt hollows and sharp angles. It was decorated from head to foot with an immense array of tattooed symbols and geometric scars. Without breaking eye contact with the hunter, it reached down and twisted a gnarled fist into the front of Cas’s shirt, holding him up as he suddenly slumped to the side, his muscles seeming to give out all at once. He looked like a downed deer; like prey.
The echo of Dean’s own accusation rang in his words, and in the darker recesses of his mind where all the shadows of his past lingered, it taunted him with his many failures.
“Shut up!” Castiel bellowed, turning around and around in an attempt to spot the spirit once again, his tone lethal. “Your filthy touch could have ruined everything!”
Over the years, it had become almost unbearable to be around, mostly because Sam had decided early on not to get involved. It wasn’t his place as a friend or a brother, and he had had no doubt that neither Dean or Cas, stubborn as they both were, would have appreciated him meddling in something so personal, and he hadn’t had any intention of starting now. It wasn’t as if Dean hadn’t been worried about Cas countless times before, but somehow this instance seemed different. It could have been as simple as the angel-specific nature of the case, but Sam’s intuition was telling him there was, as Dean had said, ‘something more going on’. So, just this once, Sam decided to meddle, just a little.
“I keep looking for ways to regain what she erased, to somehow become re-endowed with what was lost but I know that it’s merely wishful thinking.”
Dean risked a sidelong glance at the angel, thankful when he saw his eyes still closed in concentration. After a cursory scan, the hunter's eyes fell on the nearly imperceptible movement of his friend’s lips as they formed around silent syllables. As he watched, the sounds of chiming bells grew louder, and beneath them, a high pitched whine that grew in intensity as well. It was calming, soothing, and the hunter couldn’t look away.
Sam's brow shot up into his hairline, "Oh yeah? And when exactly were you going to share that with the class?!” He hissed.
There had to be some information to dig up somewhere. Maybe he could get the guy to tell him their general location, that would be a start. If he could get that out of him, then all he had to do was find a phone or a computer, hell he’d settle for writing a fucking letter if it meant he could get a hold of Sam or Cas.
With a sigh and roll of his shoulders, the hunter stood, depositing the note on the nightstand and made his way around the bed toward the exit. Despite how out of it he felt, he still proceeded down the dark hallway with caution, sparing a glance over the balcony into the sitting area and out the front windows just to be sure he was in fact alone, before continuing on to the other half of the upper level he hadn’t inspected yesterday.
The older hunter bit back an undignified yelp. He knew that he deserved it, but it was still irritating to be on the business end of one of his brother’s well-placed punches; he’d hit the pressure point between the muscles with his middle knuckle for maximum punishment.
That seemed to do the trick. Castiel finally lifted his head, peering up at Dean with those wide crystalline eyes as though he were surprised to see the hunter so close. For a moment, they simply stared at one another, Dean’s arms still wrapped securely around the angel, before Cas seemed to come back to himself. He gently extracted himself from the circle of the hunter’s arms with a shaky thanks. Dean let him go, though kept one hand on the angel’s shoulder for a beat longer while he found his footing. When Cas was once again stable on his feet, Dean shoved both hands firmly into his pockets to hide the tense fists his fingers had twisted into.
Sam gave the kid a tight lipped nod before watching him flit off further into the station. All around him pairs of seasoned eyes cautiously scrutinized him until a small commotion from the back of the station drew everyone’s attention, including Sam’s.
“Uh, Cas?” Dean called from a bit further up the path. He had gone to examine the flowers which had been doused with the yellow crap and discovered with some disgusted shock that whatever plants had been touched now appeared shriveled and burned up. Even the stone on the path seemed corroded. The smell was awful. Cas came up beside him, his brow furrowing as he took in the sight.
“We have to try.” Cas agreed. “My senses are sharper; I can absorb more visual information at a glance so I will perform the spell.” To Evan he said, “I will need a candle.”
The hunter held his breath as he watched the shadows. There was no movement. Shit, had he been loud enough earlier to wake Sam up? Or was it...Cas? Oh god. His heart thundered painfully against his rib cage. What if he’d felt something through this new freaky bond thing they had going on. Shit, he hadn’t even thought about that before diving in. Jesus, he was such a moron. He could feel his face quickly filling with the hot blood that was currently draining out of his dick. This was not how he wanted the angel to find out.
Yet, there Cas stood, without having opened up a connection with Dean’s own soul reaching out to him. If this continued, the dynamics of their friendship would suffer, of that he was sure. Dean Winchester was many things, but a sharer was not one of them. Such an intimate connection would intimidate him, make him wall up, put distance between them...and that was the last thing Castiel wanted.
“Sam?” Evan parroted, his eyes widening a fraction as he sized Sam up, reconsidering every moment they'd shared together while Sophia's face colored crimson with fury.
“Oh yeah, lot of good that did you.” Dean seethed from Castiel’s side. “You shoulda brought us here when all this started. It’s only, like, our job to figure this kinda shit out--”
“Yeah, I remember the manager; pudgy dude, thick accent.” Dean thought out loud before sitting up a bit straighter, “Does it say anything else?”
Dean squashed down the flare of bitter disappointment and a second later was slamming the door closed behind him with enough force the impact left his hand tingling and then he was back out in the infinite hallway, seething and alone.
The angel glanced up as Dean approached, flashing a charming smile that made the hunter’s stomach tense unpleasantly. Fuck, why did this guy have to look
Had he not been caught so off guard by the sudden and completely uncharacteristic vulnerability in his friend, Dean would definitely have been panicking over their too intimate proximity, the warm breath on his neck, the heavy body in his arms, but at least for the moment, his worry outweighed his insecurity while he held his friend up. Dean gingerly murmured the angel’s name close enough that the black hair curling over his ear brushed faintly at his lips.
With a frustrated growl, he released himself and shoved away from the wall. What the hell was wrong with him? It was far from the first time he’d touched himself thinking of Cas but what was happening now wasn’t like those times at all. There was no warmth or fondness or longing in the act; it felt forced...coerced from him somehow by some unknown dark impulse.
The quiet click of dress shoes on concrete slowly meandered around the bike until the angel could just make out the bastard leaning against the wall on the fringes of his periphery.
With that, he patted his brother’s shoulder once more before making his way toward the door. “Go on,” He called behind him when his brother remained frozen, “I’ve got the bags.”
Drawn inexplicably to the energy radiating off the door, Dean set the lamp astride the nearest box and reached for the knob as though it would open despite all the hardware keeping it closed.
With a determined shake of his head, Dean reached toward one of the gracefully arched brass door handles, paying no heed to the odd reflection on it’s highly polished surface as he pulled the door open.
a light and angry sleeper.” Cas confirmed with a serious nod, “Even an angel would have difficulty sneaking up on him.”
Long chapter after a long hiatus. I hemmed and hawed about making it two separate shorter chapters but in the final cut, I just didn't want to break up the suspense. Lots of stuff gets revealed, more questions to be answered. The next chapter will be back with Sam, Cas, and Jack. If time seems screwy between Dean's perspective and their's, it's because it is.
, don’t even know what the hell was going on. So you can’t assume you would have, even if you did have all those memories back. Besides, it’s more important now to focus on gathering new information and making new memories.”
“Thanks for the ride,” Sam said through a tight lipped smile as he moved to vacate the car. He paused at the nose of the car when Evan moved to follow suit, “Uh...officer?”
As he’d predicted, Dean’s own reactions seemed to dictate Castiel’s emotions. The angel even mirrored his posture as he settled his weight back against the car.
It wasn’t unheard of to get drifters looking for a room this late into the night, but that didn’t ease the jolt to his old heart. Blurry eyes popped open to discover a masked stranger hovering just inside the lobby entrance, completely drenched and dripping all over the carpet.
“Cas, what the hell man?” Dean demanded, his voice wavering on just this side of hysterical, but he played it off fairly well as alarmed concern for his friend’s strange behavior. “You scared the crap out of me!”
A firm grip behind one knee stopped the hunter’s backward retreat, pulling him instead back into arms reach. With an undignified grunt, Dean’s hands wheeled out in shock only to land hard on the angel’s shoulders to catch his balance. An arm circled around his lower back then, pulling him even closer.
Would it be as simple as talking to Cas? Would he have to make more of an effort? He thought about how close the men in the photo had been, how that Cas had looked at that Dean, and couldn’t suppress the thrill that pulsed in his gut. Would his Cas have looked at him that way if he’d gotten the chance? Indignant anger welled up inside him at the thought; he’d been right on the cusp of finding out.
Sam rolled his eyes, “I mean we were just disembodied souls last time so maybe it’s got something to do with being here in the flesh?”
"You were here the day of the murder?!" She demanded, walking right up to the hunter and poking him in the chest. "What else have you neglected to tell us, eh? I'm beginning to doubt you're even a federal agent!"
“You have a phone!" Dean snapped, throwing his hands up and hissed something that sounded like ‘freaking angels’ under his breath. The shift from blissfully relaxed to the sudden overload of adrenaline was bad enough, but the thoughts he’d been jolted from were what made him refuse to look at said angel while he attempted to bring his hammering heartbeat back down to a normal pace. Those ocean eyes in the rearview mirror had jump-started more than just his heart, and he dropped the hand that had still been clinging to the steering wheel down to adjust his jeans, thankful that his brother was distracted enough speaking to the angel to notice.
“Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.” He told him urgently. “Sheriff Briggs will see you just--” The kid dropped his voice into a whisper. Sam leaned forward a bit to hear him mutter, “--take it slow. He’s a bit on edge after what happened.
“Dean wait--!” Was all he could shout in retaliation before his entire being was blown away in a brilliant flash of grace and magic.
“Perhaps,” Cas replied, eyeing Dean curiously, “I’ve spoken Enochian for spells back on earth, but we’re in Heaven now, and it is a powerful holy language. Even when speaking it phonetically with this vessel’s vocal cords, my true voice could potentially bleed through." Here Cas seemed to hesitate, his face flushing just enough for Dean to notice. “If that were the case, because of the bond we share, it’s within the realm of possibility that Dean could hear it.”
. He’d been so out of it before that the implications of it were just now hitting with full force, making his heart race and his palms sweat. Every instinct in him pointed to something supernatural, but there hadn’t been any indication; no hint of sulfur or drops in temperature.
“It’s kinda like the Matrix,” the younger Winchester interjected. “Our senses evolved for three and four dimensional reality right? But because we’ve ascended into a higher dimension that we couldn’t possibly recognize, our brains fill in the gaps with stuff that makes sense to us. Its the difference between seeing a recognizable image and seeing a bunch of ones and zeros.” He paused briefly, looking to Cas for affirmation.
The hesitant way he asked the question struck Cas a strange and he scanned the hunter’s face carefully for any sign that something was off, but as usual, Dean remained frustrating unreadable.  Was Dean experiencing something beyond what Sam was? Could it be the Mark reacting to their location, or perhaps the coin was malfunctioning? Before he could open his mouth to voice any of these questions, Sam spoke up excitedly.
“Cas!” The younger Winchester called to him as he rounded the nose of the car. “Are you alright? What happened?!”
Briggs rang his hands over the desk, looking like he was trying to find the right words.  “She gave a vague description of a man with black hair and, her words,
The slim angel peered over at Dean just then, his dark eyes giving the hunter the vague impression of a shark. Somehow though, his expression seemed less predatory and more passively bored. It was his companion who mirrored the hunter’s glare back at him.
The Blue Mermaid was a clean but sparse single-story motel situated right off old highway 26 on the western border of Scottsbluff Nebraska. It shared a newly refurbished blacktop parking lot with a small ice cream parlor. By this time of year, the lot was usually packed with vacationing families enjoying days of cloudless cerulean skies and warm star-filled nights, but the current setting was lacking that picturesque postcard scenery.
“Forgive me, Dean,” Castiel replied, not meeting his eyes. The angel’s voice wavered in a way Dean hadn’t heard since his suicidal admission in the face of what he’d done to Heaven during that terrible ‘god-complex’ period. “This is very disturbing. I must have entered a state of shock.”
Pressing his face into the crook of his elbow, the hunter groaned despite himself, his cock now rock hard and hanging heavy between his legs as the images of Cas assaulting him escalated in depravity until, unable to stand the mounting pressure any longer, the hunter’s hand slipped back around his aching length and began to stroke it in earnest.
Sonia silently resumed her task, carefully tearing open the packet containing a sterile bandage and pressing it gingerly over the area on Cas’s back she had cleaned. Once properly dressed, she patted the angel’s shoulder and stood up from the arm of the chair.
“Alright.” Cas agreed, taking the offered keys and sliding over the drivers side as Sam exited the car.
“Castiel,” She replied with a gentle affection that made Dean’s stomach tighten unpleasantly. Her eyes traveled over to Sam, “Welcome Sam...Dean.” The older Winchester’s name fell flatly in her voice, distaste clear in her tone despite her expression of neutral professionalism. “Thank you for coming. I hope Harut’s charms are performing their function adequately. I realize your previous experience in Heaven was unpleasant.”
Dean couldn’t help the blush that crept over his face at the descriptive choices. “There--it--I saw  some kind of weird shiny smoke one my way here and it
“We don’t know his motive.” Cas replied, before stepping into her personal space, his eyes bright with conviction. “But I swear to you that I will find him and make him pay.”
Before he could stop himself or think of a more tactically sound way to sat it, Dean found himself asking, “What happened to him?”
"Woah." Dean used his less greasy hand to scroll down the screen a bit and pressed play on the accompanying video. "Looks like they have what was left of the video up here, take a look."
He couldn't finish, he couldn't even think about it. If Dean were hurt or killed while he fumbled in the dark trying to find him, it would destroy him. Despite his agitation, Sam seemed to understand, his entire demeanor shifting as he placed a hand on the angel's shoulder.
Dean was so far gone in his own head that he hadn‘t noticed his companions come to a halt until he collided solidly with Castiel’s side. His brother and all three angels gave him identical strange looks as he scrambled back with a stammered, “Sorry Cas.”
The hunter’s eyes fell lastly on the two doors at either side of the fireplace, mirroring the ones that lead outside, both the same ashen colored wood and brass handles as the rest of the walls and doors in the house.
In the late morning of the second day, Dean woke up with a pounding headache and a stiff neck from the angle he’d maneuvered himself into against the arm of the couch. After sitting up and eliciting a series of satisfying cracks from his back that eased the pain in his neck, he leaned over with his elbows braced on his knees and cupped his face with both hands. He rubbed at his puffy eyes and massaged the bridge of his nose and temples to ease the pressure he felt there, but it did little by means of helping.
At first glance it looked far worse than it was with blood bubbling up and dripping off his toes, so he bit the bullet and reached for the bottle of alcohol tucked behind a small velcro belt inside the kit. With a deep breath, he poured a generous amount over the cut, washing away the blood. The wet splatter of the pink tinged liquid on the dark tile below was almost enough to drown out his sharp hiss of pain as the alcohol burned in the open gash.
He rapped his knuckles on the glass marked BRIGGS once before a gruff voice from within barked, “Come in!”
Whatever had been looking back at him was gone leaving him peering only at his own frightened reflection.
Sam opened his mouth to say something to the effect of, ‘ Thanks, but I can handle it’ but Evan was already moving to open the entry door. Shaking it off, Sam trotted up the cement path to catch up.
It was tall and bent abnormally at its boney waist to avoid bumping into the ceiling. It’s long neck twisted unnaturally, it’s black face upside down as it stared across the room with eight blood-red eyes fixed on something else in the dark. When Dean inhaled sharply, it jerked its head to look at him, mouth partially open and dripping with a familiar-looking yellowish goo.
“His?” Sam parroted momentarily confused before realization washed over him like ice water, his expression pinching into disgusted disbelief, “You mean like--”
Confused, Sam’s other hand came up to his brother’s free shoulder to steady him, his heart hammering with the sudden rush of adrenaline. “I’m right here man.” He reassured before he rushed to explain. “I heard you yell from the library and booked it. I thought that thing was back! What the hell happened?”
The younger hunter paused, carefully stowing the small triumphant smirk before turning back to his brother with a carefully crafted expression of exasperation. Dean shuffled uncomfortably under his brother’s scrutiny, but when he lifted eyes that would have better suited a puppy than a hardened middle-aged hunter, Sam relented with a slight shake of his shaggy head, his expression softening.
He made quick work of his face and hair before dragging the fragrant foam down over his shoulders and chest and under his arms. He fully intended on this being a quick in and out like one of his many rushed hotel showers, but he kept getting caught up in how he was going to approach this situation.
When the angel seemed reluctant, Dean took a breath and approached him, knowing that he needed to get the information for this all to come full circle and he felt just desperate enough to cross a line. Hesitantly, he lifted a hand to the angel’s shoulder and squeezed it reassuringly; his first voluntary touch.
Dean lept at them, his hand closing around Cas’s sleeve one moment, only to find himself crashing to the ground on the other side of the sigil the next moment. He skidded painfully along the wood floor before jumping back to his feet.
Agitated, Dean opened his eyes to glare at the dark ceiling and sighed long sufferingly. Alright, well, the world hadn’t ended with that tiny bit of honesty with himself so that was a plus. Jesus, introspection was exhausting, but at least he would be able to sleep now...
One moment his head was full of blood-red eyes that sent fear crawling up his spine and his next punch fumbling awkwardly against the bag.
While Abbott and Costello marched them back to find Hannah and Sam, Dean caught Cas’s sleeve to slow the angel down so they could both fall into step several paces behind the others.
With carefully measured steps so as not to jostle the hunter, the angel made his way back upstairs and deposited him in the bed he’d woken in and replaced the blankets over him. With one last brush of his fingers over the hunter’s cheek, he wiped his memory of the motel, the storm and the murder.
Hazel eyes softened without Dean taking notice: it occurred right then to Sam that when it came to Castiel, Dean’s heart always seemed to be in the right place.
Then, at the end of the hall, the ceiling light flickered once again, before illuminating completely. Then in slow succession, one right after the other, each section of the hallway lights began to flicker before returning to normal, making a line right to the hunter’s door. For a moment, two shadows once again stretched across the floor toward the bed, before all at once, every light in the hallway blinked out.
"I didn’t bring you all the way here to poison you." Not-Cas remarked flippantly, his jaw set derisively and, Chuck help him, Dean couldn’t help but feel like this was the exact same sort repertoire he had with the angel he knew. As if he could sense the hunter finally settling down, he finished with. “If you sit down and eat, I will tell you the whole truth. Is that acceptable?”
Then just as his cock swelled with the first pulse of an imminent orgasm, the demon blinked out of existence, and Castiel’s eyes snapped open.
“Indeed,” The taller angel replied with mild irritation, placing a hand on his brother’s shoulder when the broad man bristled at the clear insult in the hunter’s tone. “Heaven has been in..disarray.” His eyes flit briefly over to Castiel before inclining his head to look down his nose at the hunter. “Many of the records in our archives have been lost or destroyed, but the few archivists still alive assure me that even were they not, there would have been nothing there of use. We can only assume that this sigil, whatever language it is written in, was used to ensnare the victims once they were assaulted with the toxin.”
Urgent footfalls and shouting from outside the door indicated that the other’s had heard the commotion, and then suddenly the bathroom door was being thrown open, Sam’s tall frame taking up the entire doorway while Jack, Evan and Sonia peered in from his flank.
The last image shocks a gasp out of him, his nostrils flaring as he heaves breath after panting breath. He was so so close, teetering on that knife’s edge, helpless while his hand moved as though it was being controlled by someone else.
A wistful and sad smile bowed the angel’s lips, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes and Dean was instantly transported back to the shower and the image of blank blue eyes.  A shiver ran down his spine, but he did his best to school his expression into one of sympathy.
It was similar in its foundational makeup, right down to the water damaged boxes and piles of books and scrolls littering every available shelf and surface. The single exception was a person sized workspace on an old desk near the back of the room where a single dingy lamp was the only light source besides what spilled in from the open door. With a cautious glance toward the kitchen to ensure he was alone, Dean stepped inside, risking a bit of snooping with the angel otherwise occupied. It was the only place in the entire house he’d discovered so far that seemed as though someone inhabited it with any frequency and he wasn't about to pass up the opportunity to glean some solid truth.
“You are in no position to make such demands Castiel,” Marut barked, his former submission all but forgotten, “Or have you forgotten that the devastation of our species began with you?”
A figure dressed in black entered the image from the left, stepping carefully and with purpose until he stood directly at Cas’s eye level, blocking the sleeping hunter from view. Had there not been so many minor differences Cas could have sworn he was simply looking into the mirror instead of another place.
With a sigh, Sam began, "This is going to be hard to swallow but please try to bare with me, alright? The truth is we--" He gestured between himself, Cas and Jack, "--aren't federal agents."
Sam’s lips twitched minutely before he replied, “That was one long drive ago Sheriff. Would you mind giving me a quick summary?”
After hanging up, Sam glanced around their work station, eyeing the scrolls he was only about a third of the way through translating. After a quick glance at the door, he fished his own phone from his laptop bag and began to carefully snap pictures of the remaining scrolls one section at a time. If they were going to be on the road, he didn’t want to risk damaging them, but he also didn’t want to leave behind any potentially useful information. After uploading the pictures to his drive to access later, he packed up a few of the lore books they hadn’t gotten to yet, and his laptop before carefully rerolling the scrolls into their respective capsules and shelving them.
but Dean hadn’t lived this long trusting someone just because they shared a resemblance to someone else, no matter how spot on. Then, as if it really were Cas, the look alike seemed to anticipate the hunter’s skepticism because his hands were immediately up in surrender, empty of weapons or harmful intent.
It wasn’t until they reached the door marked 42 that Cas finally turned to face them, his shoulders rigid, his hands balled into fists at his sides. His eyes feel first to Sam, but then lingered heatedly on Dean before he informed them curtly that the return trip to earth would likely be just as unpleasant as the ascent. In his rough voice the words came out more like a growl, and his tone conveyed that he wasn’t too concerned about the discomfort that they’d experience this time. Without another word, he wrenched the door open, flooding the already bright hallway with an impossibly brighter light, before stalking over the threshold and disappearing into the blinding swirl.
Dean heard every light bulb and piece of glass in the room explode at once. The door blew off its hinges. The light from the hallway lights flared and flooded the room right before they too burst. The only light afforded after was the constant blink of red light from the bunker’s security system. Dean risked a look up only when he heard Cas stumbling out of his room, groaning in pain. The hunter jumped up from the bed to follow, the flashlight from his bedside drawer flickering over the path the angel had taken, only to stop short when he saw the trail of blood and yellow ooze left in his wake.
Sam froze and advanced on Cas, whisper shouting, "What?!" Before schooling himself a bit calmer in front of their audience. Through a tense jaw he asked, "How can you possibly know that?"
It was a place deep within the bowels of the bunker seldom traversed by either of the brothers. Though he was fairly certain Sam snuck down there on the rare occasion he took his nose out of the lore, it was Cas who had adopted this place, seeking out its seclusion when he needed a place to contemplate.
His heart ached to see the angel; the real angel, not whatever cheap knock off had brought him here.
Dean straightened his spine and took over at that point, glancing around the room as he spoke. “Me and Cas took at a look at the first crime scene in the garden and found some weird shit. For starters; melted angel blades--I’m talking completely liquefied into puddles here--flowers turned to rotten ash and stone corroded like someone dumped acid all over it. We think it was all caused by some gross yellow goo that smelled like ass. Laverne and Shirly over here--” He indicated the angelic brothers with a crude jerk of his thumb, “--told us about the creepy bio experiments going on in angel jail. Real classy touch by the way Hannah.”
The silence that followed the statement was profound. Sam shuffled uncomfortably from foot to foot, while Dean kept a watchful eye on Cas, vigilant of any sign of another episode, but the angel seemed to have found his resolve because he trudged on through his explanation without batting an eye.
Dear god, between Jack’s innocent honesty and Castiel’s impatient bluntness, Sam was ready to go live under a rock, but he pushed through the cringe worthy beginning to this introduction with a tight smile that he hoped appeared less forced then it felt.
“Resonance?” Dean asked, crossing his arms over his chest, the instinct to put up a defensive barrier too ingrained to ignore even if he wanted to.
In the moment it had seemed sincere but Dean was sure now that it had been his own psyche searching for the comfort of the familiar while under duress from what had happened to him that made it sound that way. He felt with certainty now as he looked over the meticulously cleaned scene that the angel had said it only to put him at ease in the moment. From literal kidnapping and half truths, to the memory scrambling; it seemed that the guy was trying to manipulate his perception and keep him from the truth despite his numerous promises to the contrary.
At first, Sam tensed up and swallowed hard--they’d stopped at a gas station in Hastings--but then something Briggs had said struck him as odd.
“No need, son” Briggs waved him off, “We’re all more than ready to get this whole situation in the rearview, you understand me?”
An echo of the heat in the chapel flickered over his nerves causing his own heartbeat to pick up. This was wrong. He knew he should leave, but then Dean growled his name again, distress clear in his tone and the angel’s legs were suddenly moving on their own, not away as he intended but further into the room leaving the door ajar behind him.
The hunter released a soft sigh, his fingers twitching near his navel as he closed his eyes in concentration.
The trio piled back into the impala while Evan got back behind the wheel of his squad car, and they were off once again.
Castiel's back went stiff, no doubt recognizing his own written words thrown back at him. His head crooked to the side, not quite looking back over his shoulder. Again, he appeared as though he wanted to argue, but thought better of it.
Briggs nodded somberly, “Just the one here in town, small blessings. The others have all been scattered between here and Kansas.”
he do? He briefly entertained the thought of just bolting out the front door, but it only took once glance out the giant front windows to prove that that would be a futile escape if tried. Thick pine forest stretched out over mountainous terrain for as far as the eye could see, and no other house dotted the lake around them. Despite the finery of the house, there seemed to be no civilization around for miles. That wasn’t even taking into account the storm clouds that seemed to have rolled in from nowhere, darkening the already hazy sky.
The versions of himself that he’d met or been told about were so different from him and even to each other that it was a complete unknown.
The small distant sound of Cas’s voice caught Sam’s attention and he realized that he’d left the angel hanging on the line. He brought the phone back up to his face as he hurried back across the room toward the front door.
“Yeah, you can thank Sam for that one,” Dean replied, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, avoiding looking at the angel. He hated thinking about that time. Hated thinking about how every vile inexcusable act he’d committed had all
"What do you mean, 'its you?'" Sam demanded, pacing the length of the car in an effort to calm down.
In the hollow spaces where Dean’s eyes should have been, Castiel could see only the black void of his own despair, while a continuous stream of hot tears leaked from his own and into the hairline at his temples.
For a moment there was only silence before a small soft smile curled at the corner of the angel’s lips and he extended a hand to take the offered beverage; the final test. Castiel’s finger’s brushed over the knuckles of Dean’s injured hand and the hunter held his breath.
“To make sure you don’t stick your nose into anything besides what you’ve been summoned here for,” Marut growled, shifting his glare pointedly to Cas. “ Heaven has reached a precarious state of order and it doesn’t need any more blunders.”
“That’s not entirely inaccurate,” Castiel interjected, slowing his pace to fall in line with the brothers so he could join their discussion without raising his voice. “Heaven itself has also undergone a massive rebuild. After the war ended and Metatron was imprisoned, the factions which had made up the Heavenly Host united under Hannah. Together, they recreated the structure of this dimension. I have to admit, despite it’s...sparsity...it is much more organized than when we first met. Each human’s paradise is tucked into its own space, much like files in a cabinet. But what you said Sam, about being here ‘in the flesh’, it has made this place change for you. The physical structure that you see--this hallway, these doors-- its a projection of your perception.”
He was absent of the trenchcoat and in its place, he wore instead a rumpled black cotton button down untucked from dark time worn jeans and black leather combat boots half folded over and sloppily tied.
“Dean,” He spoke slowly, his eyes never wavering from the hunter’s as though he might disappear the second he looked elsewhere. “You’re alarmed and confused, but you are safe.”
I am putting a trigger warning on this chapter just because there are some non-con elements present but it's self non-con (is that even a thing?). Soooooo yeah. Beware and stuff.
Sam rebutted with a vexed bitch face.  “Dude, seriously? We’d literally just be retracing our steps.”
“Angel blades.” Cas replied automatically. “He’ll likely have his own and if he knew a counter spell to the scrying from memory we should anticipate he knows other forms of magic as well.”
Cas suggested extracting a bit of his grace to perform a locating spell on his double but Jack insisted such a spell required more grace than Cas currently had to spare. He also expressed his doubt as to whether or not such a spell would even work to track this alter-Cas given that he was not in fact the same entity as Cas despite their similarities.
All was still and silent. Once his breathing was back to normal, the angel stepped away from the table and made his way toward the back hallway where all the bedrooms were located. He felt silly really, but he walked on regardless, needing to see the brothers sleeping and safe for his own peace of mind.
Dean’s breath caught before stuttering back just a bit quicker, but he played it off as though the heat was beginning to get to him despite the warmth on his skin having nothing to do with the temperature. He shifted in his seat uncomfortably, eyes flickering over to his brother, ensuring he was still fast asleep before exhaling one long sigh through his nose and sinking once again against the seat.
“Oh right, uh--” He began lamely before finishing in a rush. “I felt like a dick for earlier so I made you a midnight snack.”
“Yeah.” Dean replied, casting his gaze around for anything that could be used as a potential weapon.
It felt strange and invasive and he couldn’t help the sense of foreboding that washed over him like ice water.
“That--uh--that rolled in on a motorcycle. He had the whole get-up; leather jacket, helmet, gloves.” The hunter replied, proud of the save.
By the time Dean woke up the sun had long since set. The only light afforded to the room was the rhythmic flicker of firelight from the hearth opposite the bed. For a long moment after he opened his eyes he just lay, staring at the ceiling. His limbs were stiff and heavy like he hadn’t moved once in his sleep, while his head was, at best, a jumble of disjointed imagery and snippets of conversation. If he tried to focus on any one thing too long it simply slipped back into the fog.
Evan all but sputtered with indignation and Sam had to mentally check himself  so he didn't crack the fed persona before he replied with a polite, "Yes ma’am."
The water washed away the stiffness that permeated him, invigorating him. The back wall was lined with small cubbies built right into the tile, each sporting a multitude of different colored bottles. He chose one at random, bringing it to his nose for a quick assessing sniff before wetting his rag and administering a healthy squeeze of the deep blue liquid inside the bottle, not really bothering to identify what it was; soap was soap.
“What about a Scrying spell?” He suggested, to which Cas paused his nervous pacing across the small living area. A pained expression passed briefly over the hunter’s face before he added, “Rowena used it to find us more times than I can count.”
Once inside, he used a towel to cover the single window so he and the room around him were bathed in darkness. He then lit the tiny candle and held it aloft in the mirror, ignoring the heated drip of wax on his fingers as he recited the incantation. “
Once again, Dean followed the sounds of clattering cutlery into the kitchen, this time making his way deliberately and with purpose, only to find Not-Cas pouring a mug of coffee like they were acting out some sort of family sitcom while a plate heaping with scrambled eggs, bacon and two slices of toast--sporting butter AND dark jam--sat before one of the chairs on the side of the breakfast bar closest to him.
“Yes.” Cas nodded, once again surprised by this girl’s ability to accept the information being thrown at her.
look at him and for the first time he took in his entire appearance in the full light of day. It was unsettling how...how
Dean stopped briefly to place his towel on the slate countertop, before tossing the washrag over his shoulder and making his way to the shower door. As he approached, the lights behind him dimmed, and a warm light along the top seams in the glass blinked on to compensate, washing his skin and hair in shades of red. The strange color choice framing the top of the shower definitely had a foreboding sort of vibe to it that had Dean immediately on edge as he reached to pull the door open.
“Dean, are you alright?” Dean vaguely registered the feeling of Cas’s cool palm on his forehead, brushing his hair away as if to check his temperature. “You look flushed.”
“And yet here you are despite that.” Sonia pointed out, “Love is not about perfection, mой друг (my friend.). It is about continuing to be present despite imperfections and mistakes.”
“Sometimes, yes,” Jack replied, but sounded disappointed, “ but the signal is too weak here; whoever it is was only here very briefly. Maybe a few minutes before they left.”
Dean wasn’t exactly sure where it was that he’d been expecting to pop up after stepping through the light.  Maybe something like last time, a familiar comforting place that was a bit too perfect to be the real thing.  Rosey images of his mother and their home kitchen flashed across his mind. He could still feel the warmth of the morning sunshine filtering in through the kitchen windows. He could smell the pie cooking in the oven...
“Yeah,” Dean huffed out in a humorless laugh, “It felt like we got launched from some sort of weird holy slingshot. I thought I was gonna hurl all over the celestial plain.”
“You are safe!” The stranger shot back firmly but without heat. The hunter didn’t miss the sleight of hand evasion. “Look at me Dean, you need to calm down.”
When it seemed as though this Castiel wasn't going to take the hint, Dean rolled his eyes and added an impatient, "Look, you said if I played nice here that you’d give me give me some answers,” He gestured to the half empty plate in front of him.  “So unless you want me to sit here and keep assuming that this is as bad as it looks, start talking."
In light of his outburst, it seemed as though Hannah had forgone the escort this time, instead entrusting Cas to know his own way out and that he would take the brothers with him. His pace was swift and stiff, and the only sound between them was the sharp click of the angel’s dress shoes against the tile accompanied by the lumbersome echo of the brothers’ following boots.
The moment Cas had seen the other angel place himself between him and Dean, the same possessive instinct had flared within him. “He enacted some sort of counter spell, but the surge of power came directly from him, not the magic. I was expecting him to be stronger than me but this was unnatural; he’s enhanced somehow.
The hunter mentally shook the phantom words away. Whether it was some crazy hallucination or a random, slightly terrifying, upgrade to whatever connection--he emphatically refused to call it a
“Oh no, I had a turn in that rodeo.” He replied in a low voice that betrayed how much it still affected him. “Not a fan.”
Evan bulked, freezing under the intensity of the angel’s expectant expression before jumping into action, quickly searching around his small bachelor apartment for something like a candle. He came back with a small pack of birthday candles left over from the Sheriff’s birthday cake several months ago.
“I know you better than anyone ever has or will.” Castiel replied wistfully, his eyes looking past him to some distant moment in time. “Better than your own brother. Better even than this reality’s version of myself.”
He hit the opposite wall with enough force to crack the tile on impact before landing hard on the floor, glass showering down around him.
Finally, on the last shelf, near a proverbial pharmacy’s worth of medication and ointment for any possible ailment, he found a healthily stocked medical kit which he promptly snatched off the shelf and set on the floor next to the toilet. He then sat on the toilet seat and hiked his injured foot over one knee to examine the extent of the damage.
hearing Cas’s true voice, what did that mean? And why now after all this time? He had known Cas for years without hearing so much as a peep minus the first overwhelming moment the angel had tried to speak to him in the gas station. What had changed besides being a solid mass of human in Heaven instead of a wispy soul? Was that all it had taken? Maybe he had been exposed to some funky divine radiation. Isn’t that how people got superpowers?
“No Sam, I’m not. I’m tired, okay? I want my shower, I want my bed; we just came off a weekend teen ghost binge and I already told Cas we’d be back tomorrow.”
It took only a moment, but in that single instant of contact, his perception completely shifted as though he were looking through the eyes of another person but...he felt nothing.
Inside directly across from the main entrance was a clerical window situated next to a mag lock security door. A bored looking young woman with too much eyeliner sat slumped over a magazine loudly chewing gum. She didn't greet them or even lift her head as they approached and Sam suddenly felt a little more appreciation for Evan's enthusiasm.
It took only a moment to fully heal, but Castiel's hand remained on him, sliding up just a touch over the juncture between his shoulder and neck, his thumb tracing absently over his clavicle.
When he finally blinked open his eyes two things hit him in quick succession. First; surprise. He was staring at a stark white wall slotted with a row of equally stark white doors sporting golden numbers. They lined both sides of the hall as far as his eyes could see. Second; panic. He hadn’t caught sight of Sam or Cas immediately and for one long agonizing second, he thought he might have actually died from a dysfunctional magic coin. Heart racing, Dean’s attention darted around frantically before he finally turned around only to discover Cas standing directly behind him. Face to face with only a scant few inches separating them, Dean could count the shades of blue in his eyes...had there always been so many?
“Surely it will be worth the risk?” Sonia chimed in, “and perhaps if you’re quick enough the magic will not alert the angel?”
A muscle in the angel’s jaw jumped as he visibly tensed, averting his eyes. In place of an acknowledgment he asked, “What’s next?”
Another breath and that splintering hot cold sensation of grace flooded Dean’s system from the hand on his face. His entire body suddenly became twice as heavy and his knees buckled until the angel’s grip was the only thing holding him upright. He felt drugged, his vision blurring as his head lolled back, only to be held up by that tender hand from his cheek as it moved to cup the back of his neck.
, but more importantly, because lingering too long on it invited a metric shit ton of introspection he neither wanted nor was at all prepared for.
It was well into the early morning by the time the impala rolled into the bunker’s parking garage. Before the car had even made a complete stop, Cas had flung the rear driver's side door open and scrambled out of the back seat. Without a backward glance, he stalked away as Dean killed the engine, ignoring the older hunter when he called after him, disappearing inside the bunker. The brothers dragged themselves to their feet shortly after, both physically exhausted after the long haul drive and the back to back investigations.
Gretchen lifted her brow at him, unimpressed, “You’re just saying that because you have the hots for his cleaning lady.”
Castiel held his eyes with his terrifyingly unnatural gaze for a few moments before the light slowly faded. With it, the oppressive feeling of crackling energy around them died as well, and the lights above returned to their continuous hum. When the angel made a move to get closer, Dean put the bike between them once again.
It wasn’t that it was new to him by any stretch. Whatever the thing was that was going on between his brother and the angel  had been coasting on the same unacknowledged track for years. Despite being completely inept when it came to actually talking about emotions, Dean wore his remarkably openly on his sleeves. It wasn’t always the greatest thing, chiefly when he was pissed or depressed, but on the rarer occasions he was happy or sentimental, the open broadcast was a pleasant room-filling warmth that always brought a smile to Sam’s face.
It could have been any number of memories Dean had of the angel, but there was something in the gaze, something flatter...darker...than he’d ever seen in the eyes of the man he knew. A perverse and salacious sense of pride and ownership crept up his spine, making his stomach twist into knots.
“This time of year? Never.” Briggs answered flatley. “Guests who were staying there reported that it was so violent that the floor was shaking like an earthquake.”
“How can you be sure?” Cas threw back in Dean’s defense. It came out a bit harsher than he intended but he had sensed how the hunter’s hackles had raised in reaction to the unfair dismissal. Along with not wanting to further incur the influence of the Mark, Cas didn’t care for Hannah’s attitude when she’d been the one to summon them there. “Dean makes a fair point. With your reaction to the rogue angels on earth, it’s not a stretch to assume that some of the more independent thinkers might have begun doubting you.”
Then quite suddenly, Dean turned his head at the last moment and instead of a kiss, he pulled the angel into a one-armed embrace. Cas sat frozen, his eyes wide and unblinking with his forehead pressed into Dean’s shoulder, the hunter’s hand still gripping the back of his neck.
“Despite all that would happen to us following that assignment, I would do it again in an instant if it meant I could share my life with him again.” Castiel continued, unable or unwilling to look at the hunter. “Considering your resonance, I suspect much of your lives were identical.”
Dean then laid his phone on the table between him and Sam as he sat back down and tapped the screen.
Cas’s only response was a pained grunt from the floor. Something was broken or dislocated, he couldn’t tell which, the pain of it spidering up his back and stealing his breath. The crunch of glass under Sam’s boots was loud in the silence as he made his way over to the angel, Jack at his heels.
“I remember.” Cas’s eyes dropped away from Dean’s, the words uttered in a tone so devastatingly low and rough it was little more than a growl. “I am sorry.”
“Sorry I keep bringing him up,” Dean muttered, inspecting the surrounding area to hide his internal struggle. He
The girl sauntered forward, extending her lanky arm first toward Sam who was closest to her and then to Dean just beyond him, dropping a large silver coin into each of their waiting palms. Sam, nerd that he was, immediately brought the piece of silver up to his face to examine the symbols etched on the surface. After a moment of inspection, his eyebrows lift in surprise, before his eyes jump over to Dean.
“False indication.” The angel replied, “Lead him to believe I am near but in the wrong location. He is possessive, he wants Dean for himself, and he will not tolerate me being near, even remotely. He will go to the location you pray to if he suspects I am a threat--”
He then pushed his boxers down over his thighs and toed them off, sighing in relief as the removal of fabric seemed to cool him substantially. Now fully nude, the hunter made his way under the arch with his towel and rag in hand to find a black stone bathtub off to the left, a small storage counter with vertical shelving not so dissimilar from lockers and a gleaming stone bench off to the right, and a large glass encased shower directly in front.
In the span of a blink, he disappeared, the faint sound of rustling feathers the only indication that he had been there at all.
“I--” Dean began, but thought better of an honest explanation. Then as if just realizing their proximity, he turned his head away, out of the angel’s hands, a blush climbing up his neck despite himself. Castiel’s dislodged hands fell back to his sides, but he didn’t back away, remaining within a foot of the hunter.
A few minutes later, the three of them were hovering over Victor Hishov’s body on the cold pull out table. Sam had donned gloves for a closer inspection while Gretchen looked on, her face more interested and lively than it had been for the duration of their encounter. Evan stood back a ways, keeping his eyes averted by pretending to examine some of the medical tools on a nearby counter.
Since the first piercing sensation of the prayer, Cas's heart hadn't stopped hammering. The panic was disorienting, sending his vision spinning and muffling the sounds around him, while a wild hyperfocus circled the echo of the prayer. Dean was in danger and he had next to no grace with which to find him, let alone get to him. Not that it would have mattered if he had. Even after he’d pleaded Jack to stretch out his senses to the area in question, the young man had felt nothing, not even a blip on his radar.
Sam opened his mouth to protest his bluntness but the angel didn't heed him, too worked up now to derail his explanation.
Sam had been fascinated by the forethought and the execution of the design, but Dean had been far more interested in how they had managed to purify all the water. Possibly during a period of existential panic, the Men of Letters had built a chapel atop the glass, complete with rows of dark wooden pews, and a podium where sermons could be given. While the glass floor afforded the dramatic illusion that those who entered were ‘walking on water’, the rest of the chapel was simple in its elegance, if a tad bit eclectic.
When he detected no movement from the other side of the room and the phone continued to buzz, he jerked his head up, his hair a wild mess stuck to the side of his cheek hovering above his pillow, “Dude, get your phone.”
Sam reigned himself back in. “Y--yeah. That’s right. Sorry. We--uh--we got sent out in pairs. My partner and I were assigned to Scottsbluff.”
Relieved that they’d gotten through to him, Dean released his sleeve, his fingers smoothing over the wrinkled fabric before pulling back completely. Neither seemed to notice Sam peering at them with an expression of dawning understanding which he wisely schooled back into something like urgent concern when his brother turned to address him.
Cas blinked in confusion, his hand falling back to his lap and Dean mourned the loss of contact. “What?”
In his pocket, his fingers found the coin, worrying at it and feeling out the carved symbols on its cool surface. A strange sensation crept over him sending the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end. It was emanating from his chest, resonating like the boom of fireworks or a deep baseline at a concert.
The sudden jolt of movement punched the breath out of Cas like a physical blow, the pain spiking and then quickly diminishing to a dull ache once the procedure was complete. From the doorway Evan flinched as he watched, his face pale, while Sonia stepped carefully over the threshold, taking in the extent of the damage done to the bathroom.
Dean ignored the rest in favor of tossing his clothes on the counter and limping over to the cabinets and throwing their doors open in search of first aid supplies. The first cabinet yielded only an assortment of towels ranging in color from pale grey to navy blue and accompanying rags; he chose a pair at random and threw them across the middle space onto his clothing pile.
“I have to check back in with Sheriff Briggs before I end my shift.” Evan stated, “I could pick something up.”
The rational part of Dean’s brain knew that when Cas said ‘you’ he meant both him and Sam as a unit, but that didn’t stop the heat from rushing to his face. He hid the flush of color by turning away with a scoff, but in his periphery, he could make out the slight movement of the telltale tilt of the angel’s head which indicated he hadn‘t been entirely successful.
The only light in the room was afforded by the hallway light which seeped in from under the door. The quiet and the relative darkness should have been relaxing, his memory foam should have been comfortable enough to coax him to sleep, but even after the internal chick flick moment was all said and done with, his mind was still full of access energy. He grits his teeth in frustration, his mind still rebelling until, at long last, he relented and allowed it to wander back to what he knew was really distracting him.
A huge thank you to all of you that have been so patiently waiting for this next chapter! I wrote it, then re-wrote it, then deleted it all and re-wrote it again so I hope this final draft will be to your liking. Things will be picking up from here on out so hold on to your pants.
Before, the warm relieved smile on the angel’s face would have given him pause, made him feel confused or even sympathetic. Now, he was prepared. Now he knew better.
She looked him over once, completely ignoring Evan who was silently fuming to Sam’s left, before finally sitting up straight. The hunter had never seen anyone make such an insignificant lateral movement look like such a chore. "Got I.D.?"
He grasped the knob and turned before he can lose his nerve. The treacherous door made a small whine as it opened and Cas froze for a breath, listening. When no sound came from inside, he mustered the courage to step one foot over the threshold and peered in.
Another owlish blink from the angel had Sam hopping up from his seat and fishing around the inner pockets of his jacket which hung on a hook near the front door. After some shuffling around he returned, handing off what appeared to be a few fast food napkins covered in the familiar slanted scrawlings of Dean’s handwriting.
Then the power overwhelmed him, his eyes slipping closed as his awareness was smothered like a candle flame. Castiel bent down to hook the backs of the hunter’s knees over one arm before lifting him effortlessly into a bridal style hold, carefully cradling his limp body against his chest.
After hearing that his brother was in active danger, Sam had admittedly gone a little off the deep end. He demanded more information and got emotional when Cas couldn’t provide more than a vague location somewhere near the border of South Dakota and Wyoming. He forced himself to walk away to keep from further accosting the angel in his weakened state.
, you’d be freaking out too. Whatever this thing is, it’s taking out angels and it’s doing it fast enough and clean enough that no one knows how or why. Anyone of them could be next. Hell, even Cas...”
“What about the death you were going to investigate?” Jack inquired off handedly, before addressing Cas. “You said it was in a location Sam and Dean had previously stayed the night. Do you think it could be linked?”
The hunter’s eyes immediately jumped over to the angel blade he could still see glistening on the counter, but went still before he could reach for it when the angel’s forehead pressed into his hip bone. Slowly, fighting the instinct to lash out in an attempt to get away, Dean peered down his torso.
Then Dean felt something warm twine around and press against him. He could see that faint shimmer in the air again, but this time it was tinged a faint blue. He sat stock still, willing himself to stay calm, but the moment he felt the strange presence begin to press
The angel stilled, his eyes flickering up to meet Dean's with a pinched look half way between irritated and confused. The expression was just so
Dean followed his eyes, staring down at his offerings with wide eyes before steeling himself to speak without betraying the game. When he looked up to meet the other man’s questioning gaze, he gave a sheepish half shrug.
Stunned but still slow to react, Dean completed the process of opening the door with the frame still in hand when a sensor light above him blinked on to reveal the walk in closet described in the angel’s note.
The angel winced at the platonic term of address, lifting his gaze back up just as the heavy doors swung shut.
He slowly lifted his gaze back up, trying to calm himself down as he scanned his immediate surroundings. The picture window was the only window in the room, but it stretched over the entire wall, flooding the surrounding room in natural light.
The fingers lingered after the grace retreated, gentle and soothing. The hunter unconsciously leaned into them, their warmth chasing the remnants of prickling numbness out of the newly healed skin.
“But correct.” Harut interjects, “The last link in this chain of improbable anomalies. Angelic steel is the strongest substance in the known universe. Nothing should be able to damage it, let alone melt it.”
Glancing down, the manager discovered that the paper was actually a timeworn photograph with soft edges and a criss-cross of creases from being refolded and tucked away. It depicted a good-looking guy in a bathrobe with short shower damp hair captured in the throes of laughter.
What the actual FUCK?!  Had that really just happened? What the fuck were those images?! It had looked and felt so
Sam flipped the badge open probably a bit too quickly but he sorely needed to vacate the stifling testion between these two young people. Appeased, Gretchen knocked her fist into a large yellow button on the wall beside her station. There was a resounding buzz before the magnetic locks on the door in the entryway released. Evan threw the young woman another scathing glare before trotting over and holding the door open for Sam.
At Sonia's suggestion, Evan invited everyone back to his apartment for lunch and to alleviate Mrs. Ivanovna of the stress having them all there induced. After checking up on her mother one last time Sonia came back out with a small nap sack and new appearance having changed out of the simple cotton dress she'd been sporting to a more sturdy pair of jeans and a sweater.
Dean was powerless to do anything but watch in tense silence as the other man slowly backed up toward the wall, never giving the hunter his back, before gradually reaching out one hand to take one of the familiar glistening shapes of the angelic weapon off the wall. Then, making sure the hunter’s eyes were still on him, hiked up his shirt sleeve and ran the sharp edge of the blade over his exposed forearm.
Dean shoved his hands into his pockets and turned his eyes back to Cas, unsure of how to continue with the other bit of information that Cas had made him privy to, still having not completely wrapped his head around it himself. His expression must have been enough of a tell because Castiel stepped forward to address the room without preamble.
The 'if' didn't escape Dean's notice but he ignored it because it made his eyes sting dangerously. He felt equal parts defensive and helpless but he wasn't about to stay where he wasn't wanted and if he shut the book he'd been staring at for the last hour a little harder than necessary Sam didn't mention it.
Under the water once again, Dean tried to focus on the rhythmic sound of the thick droplets hitting the floor around him in sheets, but it did little to distract him. He swayed on his feet as another wave of arousal washed over him, catching himself on his forearm against the glass in front of him.
“WOAH! HEY!” Dean yelped as the rag skimmed over the soaked crotch of his boxers before slapping the insistent hands away, his face and neck splotching crimson. “Jesus christ man, did your Dean not ever talk to you about
“Dean!” Sam snapped, just after the last word left his brother’s mouth, his expression tight and shocked.
Dean instantly recalled the intense boom that had resonated through his chest like the aftershock of a massive firework, followed by the echo of prickling apprehension that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end accompanied by the thought;
“So we basically have jack with a side of squat,” Dean complained gruffly, crossing his arms over his chest.
Dean was instantly snapped back to his senses, scowling after the escort as they continued. He caught Cas’s eye and shrugged apologetically, but the angel simply gave him the faint whisper of a smile which had a strangely hypnotic quality to it before the angel turned to catch up with the others.
"Your mistrust isn’t unwarranted." He muttered, not looking up from his task. "I realize multidimensional theory must be a concept difficult to come to terms with--"
“Stay close.” His brother grunted from his side, “Don’t wander. You are here to perform a function, nothing more.”
“So.” He began, addressing the little group which had accumulated in the office; Hannah, behind her desk, Dean and Cas within an arm's length of one another in front of the window, and their escorting angels near the door. “This is a breakdown everything we know in order according to the eye witness statements.” He cleared his throat as he consulted his notes once before continuing, “Four days ago witnesses indicated that, approximately sometime around dawn back on earth, they saw the first victim, Rahmiel, for the last time near Eden's northern quadrant. Their statement's indicated that this was a routine occurrence and that nothing seemed out of the ordinary.  Then, about two hours later, nearly every angel inside the garden reported
Dean’s chest was tight with anticipation but he felt light-headed, almost giddy. Had they really just stumbled into a break?
“Dean never spoke about it,” He replied, “but the things he experienced in hell left wounds in his soul too deep, too terrible to heal. I suspect you can comprehend that.” Without waiting for a response he continued, “At the time, using my own grace to suture these wounds was a tactical field decision, but--”
“Good.” Cas replied. Then suddenly an idea struck him. He leaned forward on to his knees, eyes a bit manic with the notion. “Sam. You need to pray to me.”
Dean was going to get whiplash from this guy’s flip flopping emotions. It was an unsettling reminder of Cas’s instability when he’d been stuffed full of Leviathans.
“What the hell Cas?!” Sam reiterated, gesticulating wildly toward the road and fields on either side of the car. “You can’t just zap into the car like that! We could have ended up in a ditch, or hit a tree or another car!”
Dean was languidly stretched out on his stomach with his arms curled securely around his pillow when he began to make a slow ascent into consciousness, for once too warm and comfortable to rush the process of waking. His senses came back online one at a time and he made a mental note to leave an excellent review for this motel. The mattress, the pillow, even the sheets and comforter, were all softer than he remembered them being before he fell asleep. He emphasised this by hugging the luscious pillow closer and pressing his face further into it.
Sam’s lips twitched at the more pronounced depth of his tone, and had to look away completely to school his face when this ‘Gretchen’ seemed to be completely unphased by his presence, her heavily lined eyes rolling lazily up toward him.
He grunted a surprised, “What the hell Cas,” but the words died on his lips when he stepped around the seemingly frozen angel to take in the sight before them. From somewhere behind him, he could hear his brother wheeze out a startled explicative, but all Dean could do was stare while every one of his senses lit up to high alert all at once.
A red flag alarm went off in the hunter’s rebooting brain. He pushed himself all the way up and swung his feet over the side of the bed in one fluid motion. Sparing a brief glance at Sam to make sure he was still fast asleep, Dean stood and closed the space between him and the angel with two quick strides.
The Ivanovna homestead was a quaint little cottage a few miles outside the main town, situated at the end of a long winding dirt drive carved out of the prairie in the shadow of a monolithic stone plateau. Dust kicked up and plumed behind both cars as they made their way along the grass lined path, passing by long stretches of fenced off pasture dotted here and there with clusters of cattle.
Cas hesitated, glancing at Jack before he nodded solemnly. “When I saw him, he slept with an unnatural stillness. He was unharmed, but I suspect he was put to sleep much like you were. As of right now we should assume that his mind was manipulated when he was abducted as well.”
Impossibility was an understatement. Without powerful magical aid, such as the coins Harut had provided, no creature of the lower realm should have been able to enter heaven without vaporizing instantaneously. Either this creature was something inconceivably powerful or...
He turned slowly, gaze falling onto a small silver standing picture frame tucked back behind a beautifully hand carved statuette and incense dish. Now that he thought about it, it was the first photograph he’d seen in the entire house.
“Cas!” Dean bellowed in response, bolting forward just as Sam arrived at the scene. “I’m here! hold on! I’m coming!”
Shaking off the feeling to access adrenaline, Dean took one final steadying breath as the electronic door finally opened completely, before kicking off. The sky was dark and swollen with storm clouds. Heavy sheets of rain pelted the earth below.
Cas’s face contorted into an expression of intense regret before Dean felt two cool fingers press against his temple.
When Sam and Cas finally exited the office, Dean had calmed himself down to the point where he like a right and proper dick, but he bit back the apology he’d worked himself up to making when Cas breezed past him without a backward glance. Okay, he was pissed. Sam, though clearly also no more happy to see him, paused a moment to give his brother a pissy once over before nodding meaningfully in Cas’s direction, and the pair followed after him.
Sam breathed a sigh of relief that he bought it, before continuing. “Where did the first killing take place?”
As the shock subsided, the pain flared, pain spidering up to his shoulder from his hand. A quick glance back at the doorknob revealed another, larger symbol at its center now fading gradually from the brilliant red hot that had burned him. He fought the lightheaded nausea that accompanied the immediate necessity to assess the damage.
Gretchen followed after them, and though she didn't say anything, Sam felt her presence almost like a cold spot. When he'd first arrived, he was blind sided by Evan's obvious distaste for her, but now after experiencing her first hand, even briefly, the hunter understood.
Dean crossed his arms and observed the angel as he spoke, nodding along in agreement, “Makes sense then why she got so defensive when I suggested the possibility of deserters.”
Dean whipped around, a startled explicative on his lips but the only thing which met him was empty air and the crunch of glass under his heel. The accompanying shock of pain cut through the fog in his head as the glass sliced open the bottom of his foot.
Then, in that fragile moment with his eyes squeezed tightly shut, Dean felt a tug at his subconscious: a beckoning. Turning his head to the side, he saw it.
Stretching over the entire right side of the closet, occupying shelves and cubbies and hangers, were all his own clothes. With the picture forgotten, Dean darted inside, swiping through the array of button downs and flannels haphazardly organized, along with several varieties of canvas jackets, heavier winter fleece coats, and all different shades of suit coats and slacks. Ducking down to peer into the cubbies he found several varieties of casual and dress shoes alike as well as all manner of work boots. He pulled at the drawers just as frantically, flinging them open one by one to reveal jeans, undershirts, boxers, socks, ties...
For a heart stopping moment, Dean thought the jig was up. He could hear his own blood pounding in his ears and knew that the angel surely heard it too. Any moment he would ask what was wrong...
The cool air of the room on his bare skin was a welcome reprieve, but it was nowhere near enough. He glared at the wad of fabric clenched tightly in his hands as if it had been a conspirator in his predicament before chucking it at his dresser where it hit the wood with a muffled thwap only to land in a heap on the floor.
Without further ado, the hunter set to work gathering ingredients, completely shutting off his brain to the methodical actions of food preparation. The idea was blessedly minimal and sentimental;  blackberry jam and rich crunchy peanut butter. While domesticity was the furthest thing from Dean's mind, he was banking on the extra effort going a further distance toward his end goal: escaping this fucking nightmare.
In the quiet of the bathroom, he could hear the pounding of his heart in his ears like a steel drum. His mind was circling what had happened in the shower like water in a drain, but he couldn’t afford to be pulled down into that potential right now.
The hunter’s heart gave a sharp thump against his ribcage. It startled him how badly he wanted to say yes. It was on the tip of his tongue but then he thought about Cas and Jack playing dominos and bit it back. He couldn’t ask him to leave the kid behind so soon after he’d come back, not when the only real reason for Cas being here would be to satisfy Dean’s own selfish want to see him sooner.
some sort of 'twisted’ or 'corrupted’ energy signature emanating from a source somewhere within that same quadrant. Later, the first scene was discovered by the angel Haziel when she came to relieve Rahmiel's post.”
Frustrated, Dean fumbled with his belt before dropping his pants and kicked them petulantly away along with his boots and socks. Then, without further ado, he promptly dropped on to his bed and shoved his face into his pillow.
Dean snapped his head to the side, his own hands still caught in a death grip around the steering wheel. “Don’t ‘what the hell’ me!” he barked defensively, prying one hand free to angrily jerk a shaking thumb at the backseat, “What the hell
The faintest twitch down at the corner of the angel’s mouth was all the in he needed, and suddenly the slick dressed man was throwing a leg over the angel’s lap, straddling his thighs.
But before he could turn away, before he could even blink, the angel was on him, grasping his arms in a grip hard enough the hunter cried out in pain, the bones beneath his vince like fingers screaming in protest.
“Yeah, I’m still here.” He answered with a sigh. “I’m sorry about that Jody, he’s not in a good space right now.”
As the last few notes of the previous song dissolved into the gentle whir of the tape rolling in the cassette player, the first twangy notes of Ramblin’ Man had Dean relaxing back into his seat. The flow of the humid air over his skin accompanied by the music and white noise of tires rolling over pavement was enough to lull the hunter into a state closer to peace than he had been in weeks--hell, months.
After a final slow inhale, Castiel straightened up and turned slowly to address the distressed hunter behind him.
Dean mirrored the gesture and with a smile he hoped didn’t appear as forced as it felt, he tapped his bottle to the angel’s in a show of solidarity. They both shared a gulp in silence before Castiel moved toward the work bench to inspect the offered food.
“Alright." He stated, cutting the air in front of him with one hand, “I’m only gonna ask you this one time, so it’s time to fess up.” He was trying for calm and firm, but only managed barely contained. “There has been some weird shit going on since we went to Heaven, and it only seems to be happening to us” He pointedly gestured between them to elaborate his meaning. “Tell me you feel it too and I’m not just going crazy.”
Even the itch of the Mark and it’s ever-present murderous whispers in the back of his mind, seemed strangely muted.
Despite his initial apprehension, Dean tried to look at their temporary separation during this hunt as a good thing. In between being tossed around by poltergeists and catching his four hours, he’d taken some time on the down-low to come up with a plan of attack. Sure he'd apologized but he knew without a doubt there was more he needed to say to Cas and this time he wasn't going to be a chicken shit about it. That didn't mean he wanted to blurt it out for the whole world to hear. No. What he had to say required scenery of the well thought out, private, face-to-face nature.
A red flag went up in Dean’s head and he met Sam’s eyes over the phone as he asked, “How many we talkin’ here Jody?”
"Wait...what?" Evan squawked, seemingly more taken aback than Sonia about this news. "But--but you had ID!"
The hunter’s nostrils flared as he inhaled heavily around his scantily contained anger, but his mind latched onto the warm pressure of Cas’s hand where it was splayed wide across his chest, finding far more distraction than he should have in the gentle brush of one fingertip over the skin just above the crew collar of his t-shirt.
Turning off the water, Dean gingerly dried his aching hand, flexing his fingers experimentally to test their range. As expected, the skin pulled tight from scarring was still tender, leaving his hand all but useless.
Castiel lingered with Dean in his room for a few hours, laid out next to him on the bed, simply watching him. It was a strange mixture of relief and apprehension that gripped him, a small reprieve from the heartache and numbing guilt.
“That does seem to be the pressing issue,” Harut replied with a knowing glint in his eye that gave Castiel pause. “Let us continue the survey of the scene.” The lean angel turned away, taking the lead further down the path toward the sigil they had seen upon their approach, his brother a shadow on his heels. “Castiel,” He suddenly spoke in warning, peering over his shoulder. Cas was startled by the grim expression darkening his typically neutral features. “Steel yourself.”
“She is an angel Dean, she doesn’t ‘hate’. She was justifiably concerned about my loyalties while I was in a leadership role. From an angel’s perspective, my judgment
His eyes flickered from his dad’s twelve gauge, to his own hand crafted blade from purgatory, and then further to several varieties of angel blades, machetes and other familiar weaponry.
While still obviously jarred from his sudden lurch into consciousness, Sam responded to what Cas had actually said. “What’s so important that you couldn’t call or wait 'till we stopped Cas?” Sam demanded as he threaded his fingers through his hair to untangle the chin length strands and flatten the wild fly-aways.
The second cabinet opened with a waft of clean smelling cologne and lotions of which several varieties took up the space of the topmost shelf. Below that, an array of canisters and creams, supplies of razors, hair care products, and a blow dryer.
Sam couldn't help the curl at the corner of his mouth: the kid spoke with a certainty that insinuated that he had experience dealing with the aftermath of doing just that.
“Let him go!” He roared, his voice inhuman but a deep, echoing rumble emanating from every direction drew a primal fear out of him despite his anger; a fear that gripped his very soul. The sound was ancient and terrifying with a taunting edge; it was laughing at him.
For his part, Castiel seemed to roll with the punches, though his reply sounded very much like he was trying to convince himself right along with Dean. “No, no that’s not it at all. Please, Dean. Please. You are the only one here.”
“Not sure yet,” Dean answered. “But we’re going to come to you. You said you’re still in town right?”
It had alarmed him before he’d known what it was and he did regret lashing out in fear like he had--he’d apologize for that when he saw Cas next--but thinking back on it, it really hadn’t been so bad. Under different circumstances, it might have even been kind of nice.
Eventually it was Evan’s off handed remark about this being a good time for a crystal ball that gave Sam an idea.
The resounding silence after was impressively uncomfortable, but thankfully Sam came to the rescue, “Cas, you said that Hannah asked for us to help with an investigation? What’s going on?”
“What?” The older hunter asked covering up his nerves with petulance and prepared some half-way plausible deflections, but Sam merely shook his head and made his way around to the trunk.
“I understand.” Sam tried to sooth him. “Is there anything else you can tell me about them before I go to them directly?”
The hunter froze, eyes falling on the bathroom door handle as it cranked violently to the side and the door was thrown open.
Dean sadly noted the brittleness in his friend's tone but decided not to comment. “Good.” He replied instead, “That’s good.”
“YOU CAN’T HAVE HIM!” Cas roared over the cutting edge of the air whipping around him, bracing himself against an answering surge of power that slammed into him like a train, but he refused to look away.
“Mrs. Ivanovna is a soft spoken lady. Kind, but easily overwhelmed. Sonia spent nearly the entire time the authorities were there consoling her. Unfortunately she’s the only one who saw the killer’s face. Sonia will likely be the one you talk to when you go over there. She's sharper than she looks so don't treat her like she's made of glass."
There was a heartbeat of silence in which the light above them flickered once before the angel replied. “He was killed.”
It was surreal, hearing a voice he knew so well coming from a man who was in many ways like Castiel, but in many other subtler ways definitely
With a steadying breath, he continued. “He had become afflicted with a nightmarish curse, the first and strongest of its ilk. For a time, he was strong, resisted its monstrous will but…it’s a cunning despicable thing. It found ways to make him act without his knowledge. I tried to...make it easier. I built this house for him, away from the rest of the world, to keep him safe, but even out here it found ways to torment him. Dean was indeed a strong man, the strongest I have ever known, but it had only been a question of time until he was consumed by the same darkness I had pried him from in the beginning.”
The silence on the car ride back was awkward and uncomfortable. Sam caught Evan turning to speak to him on more than one occasion only to think better of it and this time, the hunter didn't prompt him for more.
The warmth in the angel’s voice sent a shiver down Dean’s spine and he couldn’t resist the lopsided grin that pulled at his lips, “G’night Cas.”
Dean’s heart began to beat a little faster as various nuanced details began to jump out at him. The Cas depicted here was absent his trademark trench coat and was instead dressed in a casual denim button up that complimented his eyes and accented the broadness of his shoulders. The pair were seated so close it was impossible not to notice it. Dean couldn’t see below the table but he could easily imagine they were sitting thigh to thigh.
"You know!" Dean accused, taking a menacing step toward the angel despite the display of power, all pretense of the game flying out the window. “You know that he’s still here!”
Neither had been equipped to identify it, let alone acknowledge it or come to terms with it, but it had been there.
Cas mirrored the motion, “As I suspected. It seems that all we’ve been able to discern is that whatever this creature is, it is uniquely specialized for preying on angels."
As he descended the stairs back into the living space, he considered the events of the morning. Their first encounter could have gone smoother, but he knew now what could go wrong and vowed to correct his mistakes. This time when the hunter woke, he would have no recollection of the angel stupid impulsive mistake and therefore would feel no revolution from the knowledge of the dead clerk.
Castiel burst into the bathroom with an expression that could only be described as pure panic etched across his face. There was scarcely a moment of eye contact shared between them before the angel was on him in two long strides, his hands on the hunter’s face, cradling it between his palms.
“What the hell Cas?” He groaned, “Sixty freaking angels go missing in four days? Shit that’s...fifteen every twenty-four hours. Why the hell did she wait so long?”
The ridges in the middle of his palm were already, inexplicably, beginning to scar, fading from the shining angry red before his disbelieving eyes. They formed the shape of a six point starburst encased in a diamond. At its center was the image of an eye at once open and closed with its pupil obscured by a cross. Despite the rapid reduction in pain and swelling, the impression was still stark against his skin, impossible to hide even if he tried.
Dean’s body moved before his mind caught up, instinct taking place of rational thought. He let off three rounds into the things face, but it seemed to melt into the darkness around him without being injured.
Castiel flinched, expression pained as he squeezed his eyes shut once before opening them to look directly at the hunter’s face. The hauntingly blank expression gave the Dean pause.
“It’s a lot to explain but the short version is; Me, Dean and Cas were already consulting on a missing angel case but...but it turned belly up and Cas--” He paused to swallow back the lump of emotion climbing up his throat. “Cas is missing now too, and we were pulling our hair out trying to dig up some leads until you called.”
Evan nodded a bit sheepishly, his cheeks tinged slightly pink. “O-of course sir, my apologies. It’s just those poor ladies have been through the grinder. Mr. Hishov wasn’t their family, at least I don’t think so, but he took care of them and the way he died…”
“Never.” He murmured, and when Dean glanced up at his face he couldn’t suppress the gasp of alarm; the deep blue was completely overcast with a terrifyingly pure brilliant white.
“Then that’s the plan?” Jack concluded. “A false prayer to lead him into a trap and if that doesn’t work, blast him across the world for a few hours while we try to find Dean?”
The soft nature of the image stood in stark contrast to the circumstances and the manager let out a huff of nervous laughter.
“Right. Thanks for the heads up.” Sam nodded in understanding before stepping passed the kid and striding over to the Sheriff’s office.
Outside he discovered a short hallway. To the left, it ended abruptly with another large window that looked out over more misty forest. To the right, the tastefully decorated ashen wood walls housed a few other doors before opening up into something like a balcony.
Harut peered back at Castiel with his glassy dark eyes, his hands clasped stiffly behind his back. “Despite what you and your...companion...might believe, the experiments did reveal valuable information we would not have been able to obtain any other way. The effects were only the beginning.”
“Fuck,” He growled as a dull throb of guilt pulsed through his chest at the ominous sight of the Castiel in the image slathered in blood.
The mark buzzed and itched under Dean’s skin like an angry hornet, suffusing every moment he remained idle with furious impatience. To counter this he hunkered down in the kitchen to clean, grease, and load every weapon in his pack and Sam's. The routine, so ingrained by this point it had become reflexive, was usually cathartic but right now it barely scratched the surface.
“I wouldn’t expect you to believe me without proof.” The look alike confirmed before he gestured slowly, with his hands still held aloft, toward the wall behind him. “I’m going to move toward the weapons and retrieve an angel blade.”
When he remained unresponsive, Dean growled and gave him a light shake before hissing a gravelly, “Damn it Cas, snap out of it will you?!”
Then just as suddenly as it had come on, the feeling vanished as though it had never been, though Castiel was left with the very physical evidence of its presence. He stayed leaning against the pew, his entire frame trembling as he took stock of himself. He bit back a bitter shame at how tight his slacks felt. After a ten count, the angel inhaled deeply and exhaled in one slow breath, but it didn’t help to calm him as it usually did.
There’s a pause on the other end of the line and he can just imagine her piercing eyes narrowing and lips pursing like she wants to pry deeper, but to his surprise, she jumps right in.
"Sonia please!" Evan squeaked, startled by the brazen accusation in her tone despite his own wavering certainty. "I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation for all of this--"
“And...” Dean began haltingly, visibly uncomfortable, but powering through it. “I’m sorry. For earlier. It was shitty of me to lash out like that.”
Sam growled in frustration, tossing the gun into his brother’s duffle bag. “I don’t get it, why now? We haven’t messed with Heaven or any angels in a while. Everything has been relatively quiet, even Chuck--” He paused, turning wide concerned eyes to Cas. “--unless, you don’t think it
This time Marut answered. His voice was like the rumble of thunder but wavered in a way that suggested he was more perturbed by the whole ordeal than his brother, “We believe it’s a toxin of some sort. Preliminary tests indicate that small doses to angels can produce burns to the skin, blindness in the eyes and, if ingested, can cause paralysis. Higher doses result in loss of consciousness, neurodegeneration and ultimately, death.”
He’d heckle the younger hunter later for the drool dribbling from the corner of his slack mouth, but for now, Dean’s lips curled into a crooked little smile as he turned his attention back to the road. It was almost perfect, but something was missing.
Through slight tunnel vision, the hunter made his way into unexplored territory, feeling more and more like he’d been dropped into a dream. The only entry on this side of the upstairs was a set of stunningly carved double doors cast in silvery moonlight from the adjacent window at the end of the hall. His body felt feverish the longer he stood there in inaction, beads of sweat skittering down his temples and the small of his back in tickling rivulets.
“Enochian.” Sam supplied, flashing a confused look at his brother, “Dean, we’ve heard it lots of times.”
“Breaking news out of Scottsbluff," He read aloud. "The Blue Mermaid Motel owner and manager, Victor Hishov was found dead in his office this morning following homicide by strangulation sometime in the early hours between 1 and 2 AM. The coroner report states that the victim's throat was crushed under such immense pressure that the vertebrae were shattered and the spinal cord was completely severed.”
The easy nature of the expression only made the angel feel worse, his face screwing up into a grimace as Dean pushed himself to sit up straight, using Castiel’s forearm for leverage with a slurred. “s’alright. Accidents happen,” under his breath.
Dean swallowed hard and chanced a glance up at the angel’s face only to be ensnared in the same sort of blue that lured sailors into the depths of the sea. His lips parted in a gasp that caught in his throat when those same strong fingers brushed feather lightly under his chin and up the line of his jaw.
The well lit interior reminded him of the garage in the bunker though it was considerably smaller. He had only a moment to glance over the two stall spots, one of which contained a familiar car shape beneath a black sheet, before his eyes fell on Castiel’s back where he was crouching several feet in front of the stairs near the back tire of a sleek black motorcycle.
“Okay creep,” Dean conceded begrudgingly, though he didn’t lower the blade, “Let’s say, hypothetically, that I believe you. You’re Castiel; a dark broody version of him anyway. Why would you abduct me and bring me here?”
The brothers had just wrapped up a case in Casper WY where they had spent the last three days playing a nasty game of hide and seek with a warehouse infestation of teenage poltergeists. They had all died in an angsty faux satanic suicide pact back in the seventies and had since been inciting suicides from other teens who used the derelict building for all manner of youthful mischievousness. The warehouse had been ripe with teenspirit (along with teen spirits, HA), marked up by discarded beer cans and homemade bongs, used condoms and graffiti as far as the eye could see. Two harrowing nights passed without any luck and Dean had been ready to burn the entire building down by the morning of the third day when Sammy finally unearthed and burned all the belongings that kept all the kids tethered to this plane.
The young officer’s eyes bulged comically, “Oh, y-yes sir!” He stammered with a fumbling salute. “I’ll get the sheriff right away!”
A low rumbling laugh bubbled up from the silence around him so seamlessly he almost didn’t notice it until it sounded as though it were right next to his ear.
Evan was obviously about to rise to the bait, but Sam had officially had enough of whatever this school yard ‘I hate you but have a thing for you’ nonsense was that was going on between them, and quite unceremoniously shoved the young man out the door.
“You must be, you haven’t eaten recently,” Castiel muttered absently, completely unphased by the sharp edge of the angel blade digging into the skin just under his jaw. “Breakfast will still be warm if you--”
Evan pulled up just outside the front porch and he was stepping out from the driver’s side door and up toward the house as Sam rolled up and parked alongside the cruiser. By the time the three of them had exited the impala and made their own way up to the porch, Evan was already chatting pleasantly with a pretty young woman with straight straw blonde hair and large soulful brown eyes. Her attention shifted to them as they came to address her.
he thought angrily. There was only one way to figure out what was going on, and he was not looking forward to facing a potential threat without a weapon. Dean released a breath through gritted teeth as he padded barefoot across the chilly wood floor to the door. Cautiously, and as silently as he could, he turned the handle and poked his head out of the room.
Eventually, he mustered the wherewithal to uncurl himself from the floor and all but threw himself out of the shower, stumbling his way to his towel. After a quick pat down, Dean tucked the towel securely around his waist and made his way back to the other side of the bathroom to dress.
If you follow my works here, you'll know I have been consumed by a recently created spn AU but I had a stroke of inspiration the other day and was able to FINALLY END THIS CHAPTER with some semblance of sense! Thank you everyone for your patience and I hope you enjoy it!!!
Dean narrowed his eyes at him, favoring a short nod instead of a word of affirmation before finally taking a seat. He set the angel blade down right beside the plate within easy grabbing distance before leaning forward on his forearms and taking up the fork.
Disembodied sounds skipped across Dean’s awareness like stones over water. Something warm and feather light brushed up against his mind, enough to stimulate, to entice, and he began to ascend from the void of dreamless sleep.
His self-flagellation is interrupted when the haunting cry of violin strings drifts up from the chapel. His hand on the wall balls into a fist. It was softer than before, stifled like a secret. Instead of mournful is sounded...resigned. The urge to turn around and go back down there was immediate and intense but the hunter resisted. He straightened his back, set his shoulders, both hands now fists at his sides and willed himself to march forward. Cas just needed some space right now, that’s all this was.
The young woman then slid into the passenger seat of Evan's squad car after confirming the travel plan one last time. Likewise, the boys climbed back into the impala and once again followed behind Evan as he lead the way to their destination.
In lue of all that had happened, Sam suddenly felt exhausted despite the early evening hours. He suggested that they find a room for the night, but Evan waved him off. “Sleep here.” He insisted, “The couch unfolds into a queen for when my parents visit, and one of you can have my room.”
“Lie?!” Evan parroted incredulously, casting Sam a look that bordered on scornful. “Mrs. Ivanovna is a good woman!  A little off the deep end with the religious stuff, but neither she, or Sonia would lie about something like this!”
The angel’s gravelly timbre jump started Dean’s stalled out brain and he took a quick step back to put some much-needed distance between them. He could feel his face heat up but he ignored it in favor of passing by Cas to clap a hand on his brother’s shoulder.
“What the hell was that?!” Dean cut him off with a backward step, hearing and regretting the alarm in his tone before he could rein it back. He tore his eyes away from the angel's pained expression to take a shuddering breath, dragging a shaky hand over his face to regain his composure. “I need you to be straight with me Cas, I am freaking out over here.”
The angel remained silent as he turned to drape the rag over the sink faucet before reclining back against the back counter to appraise Dean from a distance. The hunter held his gaze expectantly, absently licking butter and jam from his thumb and lips as he finished off the last bite of his toast.
He nearly swerved off the road when instead he found a pair of piercing blue eyes staring back at him.
“What was that back there, Cas?” Dean questioned in a low voice, “You damn near passed out on me and you look shook as hell.”
As they slid into the car, neither were sure who they were trying to convince more; Jack, or themselves.
The ‘caution against fleeing’ bit didn’t sound good no matter how he looked at it, but a shower and some fresh clothes did. The steam and heat would clear his head, and he’d be lying if he said ‘water pressure modified to his preferences’ didn’t sound fucking fantastic on his stiff limbs and back.
Sorry for the delay everyone! This week has taken me out at the knees but I'm slowly getting back into the swing of it. I wanted to thank everyone who has left a kudos or commented, or even just taken the time to read, you guys are awesome! I don't think my writing has ever received so much attention and it is endlessly inspiring! This chapter is the last of my stock chapters, so the next update might take a little longer than a week, but it is taking form! Enjoy!
Sam quirked a brow, his eyes shifting to Cas in a silent question. That was twice now his brother had made a grudging comment about Hannah. He almost sounded...jealous.  For his part, Cas seemed to be just as confused as the younger hunter. He observed Dean’s moody profile for a moment before sitting back against the seat. He wanted to chalk up the wickedly intense energy that Dean seemed to be ebbing into the thick silence as the Mark acting up, but as Sam turned back around in his own seat, eyeing the older hunter sideways as he pulled back out onto the road, he couldn't help but feel like it was something else entirely.
Cas gave a small chuckle despite himself. “You certainly have an imagination,” but after a moment his face fell, “It's a strange feeling. Usually, Dean is the hero risking his life to save someone else. If anything, I have been the reason lately that everything seems to go wrong…”
A quick rummage around the medkit revealed some conveniently placed water repellent adhesive, which he snatched up along with a small package containing a sterile cotton bandage. After a  few practiced motions, more muscle memory than conscious thought, Dean stood up from the toilet, medkit in hand, and gingerly tested his weight on the dressed wound.
Castiel looked as though he’d been kicked while he was down, but Dean wasn’t having any of it. Fuck him. Fuck playing nice. Giving in to the anger felt damn good.
“It wasn’t a close guarded secret.” She stated curtly, “You were there Castiel, we all were, but Naomi’s...reprogramming...effected your memory of it."
Sam grimaced; he hadn’t thought of that. “Don’t tell her anything yet. We’ll catch you both up to speed when we get there. For now, just...just tell her we’re coming to help with the case.”
“It’s the logical next step” Cas asserted, “His death is too strange and too sequential to Dean’s disappearance to be a coincidence.”
The drive was quiet, save for the pur of the engine and Cas realized with a heavy heart that what he missed most were all indicators of Dean presence: rock on the radio, hands tapping against the steering wheel and of course Dean himself humming along.
Sam nodded appreciatively as Cas pressed his fingers to his forehead, only to jerk them back a moment later as though he’d been burned. Sam blinked owlishly at him, not feeling any different.
“There isn’t!” The older hunter denied, shoving his hands in his pockets as Sam fished their bags out of the trunk. He cast his gaze around the garage to avoid his brother’s eyes, “It’s just this case, you know? It’s a lot.”
but the angel pointedly ignored it in favor of concentrating his grace to heal the fracture and subsequent hemorrhaging that his outburst had caused.
Speechless, Dean was helpless to do anything but stand dumbstruck beneath that soft gaze. He’d come in here expecting his emotions to ally themselves in accordance to the monstrous information he’d discovered in the journals, but he was quickly discovering it wasn’t so simple.
In one fell swoop, Dean suddenly shoved Castiel away, knocking him off balance just long enough to slam his hand into the banishing sigil he’d drawn in his own blood while the angel was distracted.
“Common man, you saw the footage, this has to be our kind of thing.” Sam continued, “Besides, don’t you think it's kinda strange that the owner died a supernatural death right after two hunters used his motel?”
There was a pause from the other end of the line before he heard what sounded like muffled footsteps and the click of a door shutting.
Guys its getting so close to the mid narrative climax! For everyone that is still reading, you are in for some twisty turns! Forewarning, this chapter, and the next few chapters will contain some Castiel whump so view appropriately. Also, I'm going to be taking some big liberties with the history surrounding Carthage/ The Punic Wars and all of the people involved with them so...prepare yourselves for that.
While Dean stalked off to cool his temper and investigate more of the scene, Cas returned his attention to the angelic brothers, his face set in a devastating scowl. “Stop. Provoking. Him." He growled threateningly at Marut, who had the wherewithal to look away under the elder angel’s bright-eyed glare. To Harut he stated, “These experiments cannot be allowed to continue. We are too few, especially now, to risk the lives of even the lowest of our kind.”
The stairs bottomed out in an high ceilinged atrium. The front door stood about ten feet directly in front of him, obstructed by a circular island table and decorative plant. The right opened up into the sitting room he’d seen from above, while the left led into a quaint dining area whose back wall was lined with more doors, and front wall displayed more of those ostentatious multi-story windows. Dean stepped carefully around the dining table in the center of the room that looked as though it might be more at home in a viking hall than a cabin in the woods.
Once out of sight, all pretense of composure completely dissolved and Dean had to reach out to the wall to steady himself.
Dean lifted a hand to swipe at the steam covered glass, needing to give himself a once over and ground himself, but when he looked up, the sight that met him made his blood run cold. Peering back at him in the glass was a perfect replica of himself, but it stood peering at him still as stone with a sharp grin and charred black holes where his eyes should have been.
Swinging his long legs over the edge of the bed, Sam stood and made his way over to his brother’s phone still buzzing weakly on his duffle bag situated on one of the chairs near the table. He grabbed it and flipped it open as he scanned the rest of the room for Dean
