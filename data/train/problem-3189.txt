Jimmy sighed and sat down; he had no idea where to start. She was way different than what he informed she could do, so was Dean bit at least he knew how to talk.
“Thanks, it was our parents. They left it to us when they passed,” Dean replied, taking a bite of food.
Gabriel talked the whole two-hour drive to Cas’s family home; he asked a ton of questions about Dean and his family, friends, pretty much anything he could think of, he asked Dean about it. They had a few things in common. Gabriel was a switch. He didn't have anyone at the moment. He went to a different school, preferring the one on the East coast, saying he didn't want the family name's stigma following him around at school.
“I got it,” Dean reassured his sister before walking over to her to hug her. He turned away to reach into the man’s body, removing the man’s soul, and sending it to the proper final resting place.
It didn't take too long for the tailor to get them fitted, saying the clothes would be in their room when they needed them. If they could find Blue and have her come back to fix her dress, they would greatly appreciate it. Dean told them they would do the best they could to get Blue back and fitted before dinner. He grabbed Cas by the hand, telling him he wanted to show him the garden his Gramma loved out there.
“Ivy, why didn't you tell me?’ Dean asked sitting down on the bed next to his sister, he didn't look at her but instead down at his hands when he asked d the question.
Stella glared at him and started signing faster than Jimmy thought was possible. Stella was grunting, trying to speak as she was signing, pointing forcefully at Jimmy.
“Geez, Salem! Give the guy a break if he wants to drink and then go home; we can find him a ride,” Sam said, nudging his sister.
Dean sighed and looked at the other man, “I know I'm sorry, it was my sister.” he replied walking around the bar to start setting up.
“Not that I know of, and yes, I plan on staying,” Cas replied. A sense of relief washed over him as he finally let himself do something he wanted and no what someone else wanted for once in his life.
Harper turned, hearing the footsteps behind her punching Dean in the jaw, “Fuck you!” she yelled, not moving from her spot, waiting for the person she was still an imposter to say something.
”That's alright I was waiting long, I need to renew my ads, ” Zachariah said, smiling at Stella she moved next to Jimmy sitting on the floor next to him.
Stella looked again and pulled it off the hanger shoving it into Jimmy’s hand, putting her arms up, indicating she had made a decision.
“What's going on? You are going to wake up Ivy,” Meg scolded, waving them away in front of the girl's door.
Cas watched as his brother's face fell; his heart for his brother was sure Blue didn't mean it the way Gabe thought, but it was still hard to watch. Blue turned and smiled brightly at the boys; Cas was taken back at her beauty, “You look like a princess,” Dean said, interrupting Cas’s thoughts.
”Thank you for telling me, I’ll change you when we get inside, ” Cas said, turning the car off and opening his door.
“No, I don't think so, I think he just, I don't know man. His different his whole approach with her is just different,” Dean said as Benny handed him a plate of pancakes and bacon
“Nope, he doesn't care about us, we shouldn’t care about him,” Dean said the bitterness in his voice told Ivy to drop the subject.
“You like that? You like being used?’ Cas questioned; he had no idea where this was coming from, but he was going with it.
Dean sighed as the warmth of his drink filled him; he looked over at Cas, who was reading the book he had brought with him; he could see Cas looking at him out of the corner of his eye.
Dean shuffled, saying these next few hands were practice so everyone would get their chips back when the hand was finished. Cas furrowed his brow, trying to understand the rules and how the hands work. Texas hold ‘em was the game; Dean and his friends were patient with him while he figured it out. As Dean affectionately called him, Salem was standing behind Benny, shaking her head, mouthing he was bluffing, so Cas called and won the pot.
“I know, she was what fourteen-sixteen when she stopped?” Benny asked not remembering exactly,, but it seemed like she would never talk again.
They both moaned as Cas slipped his tongue into Dean's mouth, the taste of peppermint toothpaste exploded in his mouth. He moved his hands down the Omegas back, cupping his butt, encouraging him to jump up and wrap his legs around his waist. It was everything he hoped for. The Omega was light in his arms as they moved towards the bed.
Dean nodded, his attention was not looking at Clover, it was solely on Cas’, and judging by the shocked look on his face, she must have said something to him about hurting Dean. He laughed when the door shut, which pulled Cas’s attention to him, telling him not to worry, Sam was coming. As much as Clover hated it, Sam was a whole lot better at making sure she didn't get into any trouble than he was. Cas nodded as he went to sit back in his seat to finish his beer and think about what he had just gotten himself into.
”I know it's; I wasn't expecting an actual baby, I thought the would at the very least talk. The site said all of the Omegas are cared for by professionals, ” Jimmy was angry.
He instantly regretted it after he hit send. He never said anything in these things, but he always made sure to leave a gracious tip. He rubbed his face, hoping the Omega wouldn't be offended by the comment there was nothing he wanted more. He grew harder from watching the Omega slowly rub his hand up and down his clothed covered ass.
Cas beat him to the fridge pulling out the juice and grabbing a cup from the cabinet. Dean sat back in his seat at the table. This wasn't
Dean ran into Bobby’s office when he got off the phone with Cas hoping Bobby wouldn't have a problem with him leaving early but he needed to see his sister, he needed to know she was ok. Bobby jumped when the office door flew open. He knew right away it had to do with Ivy telling Dean to go on and not worry about hurting back he would pay him for the rest of the day, after all, Dean was the only person Ivy had in her life.
“She knows how to fight but Marv bothers her all the time she never…. Please don't restrain her it does something to her,” Dean rubbed his face thinking of all the times he had seen his sister restrained. “It's like all the life in her leaves I know it's policy for a patient who get violent. Still, she's my sister,” he pleaded.
“I have never felt comfortable at home, and here I….” Cas trailed off, looking around. He felt safe there, like he belongs.
“I know, we already say, may sound stupid but not stupid,” Ivy frowned, folding her arms across her chest.
Dean rubbed his face walking towards his sister. When she didn't move, he pulled her into a tight hug, whispering how sorry he was, and he loved her kissing the top of her head as the built-up pain and anger came pouring out. Karen said that if they wanted to go to Pontiac, they should get a move on.
A loud booming woke Dean up at six in the morning on his day off. He grumbled about how it better be good as he opened the front door. He was greeted by a delivery man shoving a clipboard in his face while telling him where to sign.
“I almost forgot, did you miss me, baby,” Dean said, smiling at the car. He unlocked the doors leaning across to open the passenger door; he was smiling until he spotted the monstrosity that was in the tape player.
”Don't worry about your sister, Jimmy will take care of her, and when they finish they will meet us up there,” Cas said, unbuckling Dean from his seat after wiping his hands.
Dean looked at Ivy. She shrugged and took a plastic fork Dean produced from his back pocket, dug in. She sighed happily to be eating something other than hospital food. She bounced a little in her chair and let out a content sigh.
He got there about an hour early to set up for the pop quiz, he also wanted to make sure his students did the reading beforehand. He loved the power he had over the students. Cas was fair in his grading by giving everyone a chance to retake it if they needed to. It was always satisfying to hear the students' groans.
“Bull shit, you are hung over. What is going on?” Bobby replied, grabbing Dean's shoulder making him look at him.
Jimmy answers the call Becky was talking a mile a minute Jimmy said he would come down to see what was going on.
Chuck nodded and replied with a wave; his mother did the same, telling him to make sure he was on time for once. Cas laughed as he headed out of the room, rushing up the steps to grab his jacket before heading out. As he made his way back downstairs, he spotted Dean and his sister making their way back into the dining room. He hung back for a moment to make sure they didn't see him. Calling for another ride, he waited outside for the driver to come while rocking back and forth on his heels; he didn't hear the door open.
”oh, Mr. Novak, she's adorable. I love her dress, ” Andrea said, smiling at Stella, ”your meeting is here they are in your office if you want, she can stay out here.”
There was one boy who wasn't like the other children at all. He was fascinated by the twins. He thought they were funny, and as they grew, he fell in love with Dean. He never feared his gift. Instead, he was in awe of it. He wished he knew what he was and what his gifts were.
A new message popped up, stating that the creator wanted to know if he was interested in joining a private room.
“Thanks for the update, can you put a rush on the parts? I'm not trying to rush, but I need to have it ready,” Crowley replied.
She huffed and started writing again holding the pad up when she was done. “Marv is bothering me again. Can I hide till Dean comes back? Please?”
“Hi,” Dean said, peeking out from behind Cas. He wasn't sure she seemed nice, but that's how a lot of people were the first time they met them.
”Dean, remember what I said, Stella can pick out what she wants to play with, ” Cas said with a stern look.
Ivy was writing something down and showed it to Dean, he slumped his shoulders and shook his head, “You know you can't until you get better,” he said a tone of sadness in his voice.
Dean laughed when he had the computer randomize the outfit for his date. When the network had picked a business suit and tie with a trench coat, he couldn’t stop laughing but clicked ok anyways. It could be sexy to watch the person strip off the layers. Next, he had to pick a name, he was not in the mood to decide, hitting the random button. The first name to pop up was his brothers, and there was no way in hell he was going to go on a date with someone with the same name as his brother. He kept hitting the button, annoyed at all the common names popping up until finally one, he thought was exotic and sexy, showed up. He accepted that, then checked everything over and was pleased with how his date looked. He clicked accept appointment only to have the website glitch and tell him his playdate would be ready in the next twenty-four hours and logged him out.
At least I know where the fuck you are. Samuel, however, I don’t know. His phone is off, and I don’t even know where to start looking for him.
He stood up, smacking Dean on the ass, admiring the bright red handprint that showed up before lining himself up with the fluttering hole.
“Dr. Novak said it was fine, she's finally communicating. You’d know that is you actually checked in” Meg said running down the hall to get Ivy.
“Dean, you made it,” Cas said as he is looking up when they walked in; he could help but smile at Dean. “Thank you, Anna.”
Cas looked at Jimmy, ”she was kind, ” Jimmy said, holding the door open as Cas pushed the stroller in. Jimmy walked up to the counter handing over the prescription explain he had only had her for half a day and asking if there was anything else he could do for her.
“Why don't you go put your underwear back on?” Dean suggested looking at Cas from the corner of his eye.
“That is for you to write down all those thought you got going on in that head of yours. If you want to,” Dean said ruffling her hair.
Ivy nodded Dean grabbed her hand and squeezed.They watched Ivy leave the room shoulder slumped she did feel bad she never hit anyone just to beat them but Marv struck a nerve.
“Not supposed to talk about it. Master promised he would hurt me worse. Hurt you too,” Ivy wrote down tapping Dean's shoulder so he could read it. Scribbling down more before he could answer, “He has always known where I was, he leaves me alone for a while, and then when I get comfortable he shows back up. I don't know what I would do if I lost you.”
”Will you watch Stella? I gotta tell Becky she needs a change, ” Dean said as they played with the blocks.
“Ok, she does need a punishment if you will, you can't stay for breakfast but do come for lunch” Cas said hoping that compromise was good for Dean. He wanted to stay on Dean's good side and make sure Ivy was getting what she needed.
She crawled out as Jimmy stood up, she looked down, Jimmy lifted her chin, so she was looking at him.
Dean stretched, accidentally hit Cas with his elbow, “Ow, what was that for,” Cas mumbled from under the covers.
It finally clicked before he pulled the lock off, flicked the latch open, took a deep breath, and hoped he wasn’t going to regret opening the container. There were confetti and glitter everywhere as a giant sign saying ‘thank you for being the one-millionth customer’ appeared. There was a smaller sign below informing him that for being so, he ‘received a new AI sex robot for free and a lifetime of free maintenance for the bot.
"They share better than we did," Cas said, watching as Dean told Stella about the car museum and about the new car he got.
Harper and Sam were ready, as the waitress taunted Dean telling lying was a sin and to mind his tone she would drag him and his sister back to Heaven herself, Sam and Harper went to make a move Dean put his hand up there was something about the way the waitress said it that caught Dean's attention, he smirked.
She had Karen, who was doing her best, but nothing had been the same since the twins had gone to Heaven. Harper stood up, looking up at the water tower before climbing the ladder that was probably a better choice to jump than shooting herself if Sam somehow found her she didn't want that to be the last thing he sees, not that being torn to shreds by a heaven hound wasn't traumatic for him.
Dr. Castiel Novak was a big-time psychologist in New York who had his own practice. A loving boyfriend, a truly wonderful Norman Rockwell life, all that came crashing down when he found out that the man he was going to marry was cheating on him with his best friend. Heartbroken and all alone, Castiel moved back to the small town of Lebanon, Kansas, to work at the Lebanon Psychiatric facility; most were in for some kind of psychosis. Cas was extremely interested in the case of Ivy Winchester. She had been there most of her life; she had a twin brother who would visit her daily; she never talked to anyone. Cas was hoping he could change that. He flipped through her file before heading to bed. When they were four, their mother died in a house fire; father couldn't cope dragged the kids around alcoholic would smack the kids around a bit, tell them it was their fault their mother died. At fourteen, Ivy couldn’t take it anymore and slit her wrists. Her brother found her got her help. She stopped talking after. Still, her brother was convinced something else happened to Ivy; she was committed to the facility.
When he was done he told Benny he would pick him up later and they would go see Ivy together it might cheer her up. She love Benny like a brother and Benny always got her to smile even laugh sometimes. Dean headed home. He looked up at the run down building, making his way up the steps and past the neighbors that were always arguing, he tossed his keys and wallet int he bowl by the front door. Dean sat down on the couch and waited for lunch to roll around so he could see Ivy and Cas again.
Clover pouted at the suggestion. “Wait! How come I had to leave my phone, but you got to bring yours?” she asked, glaring at Dean, shooting up from her seat, sending the chair she was sitting in tumbling back.
Dean and Benny had been best friends since they were 11 they were in the same group home together, Dean was small for his age, so Benny watched out for him. They did everything together Benny was Dean's first guy he ever had feelings for they did occasionally hook up now and again. Still, it never went any further than that, Benny loved Ivy she was like a sister to him, he visited when he could bring her flowers and little gifts for her room.
“I can't believe this,” Dean said shaking his head, “what do we do? Ivy won't say anything. What do we do?”
Dean sighed and got up. He took his plate and cup to the sink to set them down in. He leaned on the counter for a second before turning back to Castiel to answer the question, “Do you wanna have sex with me?” he asked, looking the bot in the eye.
Dean choked on his beer at Cas’ admission, “Wait, do they not know if it was you or not?” he questioned between coughs.
“I need you here on time. What did your sister need? Boyfriend problems?’ Gordon asked a teasing tone in his voice.
“Ash, go to your own table,” Cas said, he could tell that Ivy was getting agitated she was bouncing her leg up and down glaring at the man.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas replied a bit startled when Dean said his name. He was deep in writing notes in a patient file.
“Salem and I are into photography; she gave it to me for our birthday,” Dean said, watching Cas as he looked at the poster.
“She likes you, not in a weird way just ya know,” Dean said looking up at Cas when the door closed behind Ivy.
”No, her brother said she couldn't talk, she makes sounds, but I don't know if they didn't care or what happened, ” Cas said rubbing the back of his neck Jimmy motioned for him to hand over the phone.
“That's really weird, I know she's been here a long tim. Maybe when her file was moved from the kids ward they lost some of it. I don't know I can call down to records and see what they have there should be copies of everything,” she said looking through the file “It looks like someone removed a bunch of stuff.”
“If you weren't here bringing Dean back, what are you doing here?” Karen asked, taking a swing of her beer.
"I'll be back for lunch, and we will meet Stella and Jimmy at home after work, ok?" Cas said to Dean.
Dean swallowed as his mouth went dry. That was not what he was expecting, but in truth, he found it hot. The bot taking control like that, maybe that's what was missing from Dean's life, someone to take over when he had had enough.
Dean sighed and looked at Cas. If he was going to stick around, he would learn that the words “professional help” were a bad thing. He stood up, shaking his head, calling out for his sister to come back. That they would explain everything to Cas, he was still new to the family and didn't know any better. She did come back after some more convincing, eyes red-rimmed from tears.
Ivy looked around for the paper and wrote quickly holding it up for Dean to read, “It leaves fewer marks than other rope.”
“What does she talk about?’ Cas asked. He was curious, especially with the way Marv was talking. There had to be more to it.
“You aren't in trouble. It's so you can eat the pie in peace,” Dean said, giving Ivy a reassuring smiled.
This is the last time I'm writing in this stupid fucking journal. Why do I even keep this? I'm torturing myself by writing to you like it's keeping you alive. You are dead, and I can't handle it!
Dean turned and looked at his sister; Karen shook her head from behind Harper, telling him to let it go. There was no point in fighting with her about this.
Dean let out a sigh as Cas set a steady pace. A well-placed smack had him on the verge of cumming; this was incredible. The floating feeling with each one of Cas’ thrust the grunts and moans filled the room, Cas praising Dean telling him what a good Sub he was and how he was so perfect.
bad, having Castiel do things for him... It was going to take a while to get used to the bot being in the house. Cas placed the glass of juice in front of Dean and stayed where he was.
“Ok, I do have a quick question, is there a reason she wears long sleeves it has been warm and it's not cold in here and her file doesn't shed a whole lot of light on her other than she attempted to end her life,” Cas said looking at Dean.
. The pain was too much. They both looked at the house as they pulled up, not knowing what to expect. They got out of the car and walked up the stairs.
Cas nodded as he tried not to breathe in too deep and make the Omega uncomfortable. At the same time, he grabbed the assignment sheet and handed it over to Dean.
Cas ran a hand through his messy hair, “They are pittens. How long have they been eighteen?” he said, pointing at Dean and his sister.
Dean jumped slightly when he felt Cas’ finger rub around his hole; he couldn't help the lewd sound that escaped his mouth when the digit pressed slightly deeper inside, slow and steady. Cas know all the ways to make his body tick, he swore as Cas added a second finger and more lube. Dean didn't even know where the lube came from. In truth, he didn't care; he didn't want Cas to stop touching him.
Sam smiled wide, grabbing his sister and swinging her up in the air. Salem squealed and laughed as Dean grabbed her from Sam.
“Cas, you can take my spot; I'm going to get the food out of the oven,” Salem said, getting up from her seat.
“I didn't ditch you; I simply forgot to tell you I was leaving,” Cas defended with a small chuckle. He flipped the collar up on his leather jacket with one hand as he rushed across the street to the cafe. He listened as Charlie rattled on about how it wasn't safe to not tell her where he was going or that he was leaving. Cas told her he was sorry and he would get better, at the very least, by sending her a text to let her know what was going on. He heard Charlie sigh into the phone, saying fine, she would talk to him later.
“Shall we go to the bedroom now?” Castiel asked out of nowhere, looking at Dean with those eyes that made his heart stutter.
"Sweetheart, I'm so sorry you saw that, but I promise I want you," Jimmy said, stepping closer to Stella.
The mansion was huge, stone steps leading to mahogany doors, two stories a balcony on top the wrapped around, white with grey trim, two men stood at the bottom level. Dark hair, blue eyes, one with messy hair, the other looked combed. Different styles, the one with messy hair, wore a suit, while the other had on jeans and a t-shirt.
The Queen turned and looked, spotting where the voice came from. She stopped walking, making her way over to Cas, “I'm so happy you are home.”
Stella was looking around opening her mouth so Jimmy would put more in her mouth she smiled at him. He was sweet and smelled good; he didn't get mad because she spilled on her dress.
“I am?” Benny asked surprised. Dean was protective over who got to visit not that htye had a tone of family but he was still shocked.
“Dean and Harper Winchester, out of the fire and back into the frying pan,” Pamela remarked, stepping back and telling them to come on in so they would get things ready.
“Metallica, it keeps me calm,” Dean replied, not opening his eyes until the flight attendant came on over the loudspeaker with the in-flight instructions.
They used diapers never being taught by the guardian how to use the restroom properly; they ate with their hands. Dean always made sure Stella had enough before feeding himself; she never learned to pick up the food for herself. Dean always fed her. The twins never wore clothes only when it got too cold in the barn. Their caregiver would beat them for getting them dirty, so Dean decided for both of them that no clothes meant no beatings.
“I don't know if I'm going to check on her, why do you ask?” Cas said intrigued at how the other patients were concerned when something was a bit off with Ivy. he figured they spent too much time together they would notice.
Jimmy made sure he had everything before getting Stella, her face was flushed, and she was walking as if it hurt, he picked her up placing her on his hip lightly carrying her into the house.
“Is this about Dom? I thought you and Blue made up?” Dean asked, sitting down at the table with three cups setting one in front of each of them.
“How long?” Cas asked, watching the tenderness that Meg had with the girl. He wondered if she was like this with all the patients or if it was just Ivy.
“It's not it's time when it is I'll be there,” Wren replied, her voice firm but sad as she held the bird’s wing to its side so Rowena could bind it.
“Dean, you will be ok. It’s fun you get to play with the other kids and do arts and crafts you'll see,” Cas said as Jimmy opened the door.
“No way, I watched him die, I remember…. I-I,” Harper shook her head, not wanting to relive the memories she had every night, “No, there's… just no!” she pulled away from Karen. Walking off in the direction she left her bike.
“You gonna tell me why you got fired? Or why were you at the meeting?” Dean asked, looking over at the man next to him, redirecting the attention from himself back to Cas.
“Awesome, I have to work tomorrow but I'm free saturday night,” Dean said trying to act like he wasn't too excited.
He changed his clothes before heading back out, getting into his car; it was strange now that he was on his way to see Dean everything in him was settled. There was no need to escape the confines of the car, no need to rip open throats, and the brushing of what was inside him pressing against his skin disappeared. He was thinking that he might casually bring up what was going on to Dean. Maybe he would know since everything felt better when they were together. He shook his head, thinking that the other man would probably think he was insane; it would be better to keep everything to himself. Entering Dean's address into the GPS, he started on his way, thinking about how he was showing up empty-handed. His mind was a bit rude; he stopped at the gas station picking up a bottle of whiskey before continuing to the next town over.
Stella sat down on the floor and waited until her brother finished, only to get in trouble for playing with the soap and having to be rinsed off again.
“He hasn't been in a while, that will make Ivy’s day,” Meg said happy to hear someone else was coming to visit besides Dean.
Cas looked up at the ceiling before looking down at Ivy, “I think I know what happened to you when you were young,” he said.
Harper huffed, turning on her heel and storming off Dean following but still keeping a bit of distance.
The Alpha wanted to make this last longer, but he could feel himself getting close to popping his knot, he removed his hand.
”Ok, I promise, ” Dean replied he looked up at his sister snuggled in her alpha's arms, ”up, Daddy.”
Harper looked at Sam, “Pam took one look at the guy, and her eyes burned out of her skull, and you want to summon it?” Sam replied.
“Go get Dr. Novak” Meg whispered, to Anna not wanting to startle Ivy, Anna nodded and ran down the hall to get the doctor.
Stella nodded enthusiastically, Dean's smiled and picked up the puppy she gave him licks and looked at Stella.
“Of course,” Cas said standing from his seat and leading Dean out of the room. They headed to the dining hall Ivy wasn't there and she wasn't in the TV room,they went to the nurses station too see if they knew where she was.
She peeked out from under her arms and nodded, pulling her legs up closer to her chest. Jimmy touched her gently; she had never felt that level of kindness like that. She launched herself into his arms. He laughed as Stella rubbed her face on his chest; his scent made her feel calm.
Jimmy sighed and gently moved away from Ivy. She shifted and rolled over, pulling her pillow closer.
“Now, Doc I was telling Miss. Ivy here that this is not food” Benny said picking at the mash potatoes and meatloaf on his plate and making face.
“I'm sorry you are having a hard time; Dean will be back tomorrow for lunch, right?” Cas asked, reading in the file the times and days Dean came to visit his sister, noting there was only one day out of the week he didn't stay too long and another he didn't come in for breakfast,
Dean looked at Cas who nodded he wanted to know too. Cas changed Dean, who wasn't as red as his sister, while Dean relayed everything that the doctors did to the both of them. Cas sighed the website they got them from said they were cared for healthy and happy, baby omegas. They weren't fit, and as far as Cas could tell, they weren't pleased.
Ivy stared out of the window for most of the day just thinking about things. What could Dr. Novak know about what happened to her? She didn't tell anyone she did try to tell ended up getting hurt and she was not going to have that happen to Cas. What if he found out that Dr. Novak knew he would hurt her? Would he hurt Dr. Novak?
He nodded while setting the empty beer bottle on the table, Castiel stood up, holding out a hand for Dean to take. He hesitated for a second before telling himself that if Castiel didn't want to do anything, he could simply say no, and Dean would leave him alone.
The nurse left, saying the doctor would be in shortly. It didn't take long for the doctor to come in, he did his exam ran his tests and finally came back telling Jimmy that Stella had damage to the auditory nerve and hearing aids may help, and it was a good start on getting her the dog in case the aids aren't helpful.
“Are you insane? We are not summoning that thing,” Harper whispered, unfolding her arms and leaning forward.
They stopped in front of two huge wooden doors. Blue pushed them open, revealing a large spacious room set up in the middle where four tri-mirrors Cas was in awe of the room. It was magnificent. The light accent of honeysuckles made him smile.
Dean choked on his juice, spilling it all over the table in the process. “No-Cas. That's not- look, I didn't know I was getting a sexbot. I need to adjust to the idea,” he said as he cleaned up the mess with the napkins that were on the table.
“Ivy,” Dean said getting his sister attention, she looked at him tears streaming down her face. “Are you sorry?” He aked, Ivy nodded yes and wiped her eyes with her sleeve and sniffed looking away from both men.
“I'm the one who gripped you tight and lowered you from perdition,” the man replied as if Dean should have known who he was; there was static in the air, the thunder booming loudly over the barn the lighting created inside made a silhouette of wings protruding from the man's back as well as large horns curling up and over the top of his head.
“Do you think he might be, like, half-fairy?” Wren finally asked after a few minutes. The thought of what Cas was and why he never showed signs of any gift was often thought about.
Dean nodded, slightly dazed as he took hold of his sister’s hand. They headed towards the door, no one stopped them. When they were hired, the staff knew that Death didn't keep business hours, and the twins were drawn to whomever’s time had come to an end.
Cas nodded, looking down at his watch, “Which reminds me, I have a shift,” he said, trying to keep the relief from his voice as he stood from the table. “I'll be back before dinner.”
Dean took a deep breath through his nose and blew it out through his mouth, repeating the process until he felt better; he smiled at Cas. He loved that there was no judgment when he had his panic attacks, and his Dom was there to help him through it. Dean told Cas he was fine, ready to go and meet his family.
“I met someone, I was supposed to go out with him tonight, but you nagged me to death about coming to family dinner,” Cas interrupted, making his way over to the drink cart pouring a shot, taking it before turning around, “What?” he asked seeing his family staring at him.
Cain nodded, telling Dean where Cas’ and his room was; Dean grabbed the bags making his way up the old wooden steps a picture of little Cas running down the steps filled Dean's mind as he ascended, reaching the top, he turned right and headed down the hall, he knocked lightly on the door there was no answer. Dean sighed and nodded again, this time a little louder, still nothing; he turned the knob seeing the door was unlocked, he made his way inside. He wasn't surprised by what he saw a queen size bed pushed against the wall; on the other side, rows of bookshelves lined with books a beehive suncatcher hung in the window. Cas didn't move as Dean walked in, dropping the bags on the floor.
It was a simple bear, but Stella loves it the second she saw it, black with blue eyes wearing a t-shirt that said ”I wuv daddy.” on it. It was the bear Jimmy laid next to her when she took a nap, and she loved it because her Daddy gave it to her.
Dean didn't stop saying goodbye to anyone. He needed time to process what was going on as he made his way to his second job. He bartended the lunch hour and into the evening at the local gay bar/strip club in town. Dean wasn't a huge fan of working there but it was a job and it helped cover what they insurance didn't to keep Ivy close to him. He pulled in on autopilot getting out of the car the manager greeted him.
“Ivy, you can't hit people” Dean said she looked up at him, she let air out through her nose in frustration.
Stella squeezed Jimmy's hand he reassured her it wasn’t going to hurt, she looked like she didn’t believe him but stayed still.
Sam and Cas greeted each other. Cas inquired as to who or what Sam was looking at on his phone. Sammy shook his head, saying it was nothing and that Clover should mind her business. Dean laughed, saying he should show them his latest obsession. Sam pulled his phone back out with reluctance in his demeanor, opening the camera roll and handing it over to Dean and Cas.
“Happy to see they made up,” Cas noted, looking around at all the flowers that filled the halls, “Are there always flowers?”
“I don't know, and I keep telling him I don't care if he was only a human,” Dean replied as he pulled his t-shirt off and replaced it with his scrubs top.
”I'm sorry, all done sweetheart, I have jammies for you, ” Jimmy smiled, slipping her foot in, sitting her up and zipping it.
Cas nodded, taking a drag, “I think John hits them, well Willow anyway. You should have seen the way he snatched her,” he shook his head, “I'm not happy, and I'm like ninety percent sure Dean and I aren't going to get along, but I see him put his hands on her like that again, I'll scratch his eyes out.”
“Leave Blue alone; she doesn't get to spend much time with her kind,” Dean scolded, heading through the open door.
”Well, Son, I'll have the doctor come over in a few hours to check out that rash and see what he says, ” he replied.
"Stella will be back tomorrow, we found out she has a hearing loss, and Jimmy got her a hearing dog in training so she will be coming tomorrow too," Cas told Becky when he dropped off Dean.
Ivy shook her head; her eyes glistened with tears as she pulled her oversized sweater tighter around herself. Still shaking her head as she pulled her legs up to her chest. Ivy looked up at him. Her eyes pleaded not to ask her again to write anything down.
“That's great, does Ivy like Benny?” Cas inquired, he had noticed the name as one on the list of people Dean authorized to nn124679-visit Ivy.
“I'm sorry, Dean. I have seen this in patients who have been forced into certain fetishes. I'm assuming your sister was restained. When that happens she retreats to a happier place in her mind,” Cas tried to answer Dean's question the best he could without help from Ivy.
He took a deep breath and typed in that he was ready. The Omega asked if there was anything specific he like the Alpha said, not the moment he could do as he pleased.
Ivy made a face; she hands the rest of the pie back to Dean to take home, hugging him before pulling her sweater tight around her middle and following Anna out the door and down the hall.
“Have you tried being nicer to Ivy?” Cas asked. He was sure that it wouldn't matter Ivy was smitten with Jimmy, and it wasn't just because he was nice to her. It wouldn't hurt Ash to stop taking her food and be a little bit nicer to her.
“She eat anything yet?” Dean asked, glancing over at Cas, who was staring at him. He quickly looked away as a slight blush made his cheeks red.
“He kept saying I was talking about a baby,” Cas read out loud. He nodded in that doctorly kind of way,“He told me about that,” he said, Ivy scribbled on the paper again before holding it up for him to read.
this chapter has a few POV changes between Dean and Cas but I promise it will go back to one POV in the next chapter.
“No, thank you but is that her favorite apple?’ Cas asked, sitting back down in his chair to add it to her chart. It was annoying how little there was in there about her likes and dislikes.
Cas was amazed by everything around him; his whole life, he never felt like he belonged, and nowhere in this magical place, he found a home. He was startled when he felt a hand on his shoulder pulling him from his thoughts. He was greeted by a young-looking man with a gentle smile.
Dean stopped eating and was watching making sure he wasn't hurting his sister, Cas told him they could play for a little bit and then a nap.
The table started to shake, and the TV was flicking on and off, showing only the snow on the channel. Harper suggested they stopped when the stench of rotten eggs filled the room. Pamela shook her head, saying she almost had whatever it was.
Jimmy carried Stella to the closet and opened the door; it was full of dresses and beautiful clothes for both of them. Stella gasped and made what Jimmy would call her wow face.
“I don't think so at the moment; she was restrained. I saw him. I think” he let out a breath before he continued to seak, “ I think I may know what happened to her.”
“Did she now? I may go visit our girl this evening” Benny said, smiling at the thought of Ivy making steps.
“I don't know. What I do know is he's just as pissed as I am. The sister seems sweet,” Cas replied as he grabbed the rag and glass cleaner to clean the countertops.
“Oh, a journal in case she wanted to write and a few pens. They are felt just in case,” Dean said as Cas unlocked the door to Ivy’s room.
Grabbing a towel off the rack, he tossed it over the mess on the floor, not caring about it at the moment. He wanted to feel clean, warm. Hoping a hot shower would help break the fever. Gingerly removing his pants as he shifted his weight, his knee buckled from the pain he swore, catching himself on the counter. Finally, he managed to get the rest of his clothes off, testing the water before getting it. Make sure it wasn't too cold or too hot. He decided to lean against the wall, figuring out that he would not have his leg give out on him again.
“It was good to see her, I miss her man,” Benny said, he really wanted to take more time off for visits but i just seemed like his and Dean's schedules never lined up.
“Call him, see if you can still make it, tell him dinner was canceled,” Gabriel said, getting up from the couch.
“Yeah, but she'll eat pumpkin too, cookies, cupcakes, not the regular cake. I don't know why,” Dean said, licking filling off his fork. Cas swallowed as his mouth went dry. He most definitely wasn't crushing on his patient's brother; he just met the man. Cas was sure Dean was flirting with him, but he couldn't be sure; it had been so long since anyone had shown interest that maybe was imagining it.
Everyone took a seat at the dining room table; Cas looked around that place was amazing the table was made of solid oak it looked old, the room had a lived-in feeling to it, it wasn't like his family’s house the cold, don't touch anything or you'll never hear the end of how hard it was to get the fingerprints out type.
“It’s not you; I want her close, that’s all I think half a day should be good to start, ” Jimmy replied, smiling.
Cas followed to keep a bit of distance between him and Dean; he wanted to comfort the other man and tell him how proud he was of Ivy even if he hadn't known her a couple of days. Dean made his way over to the line to get his food Cas close behind. They spotted Ivy and Benny while walking over, setting their tries down before pulling out their chairs.
“I can't; I just dropped by to say hey. I have a shift at the cafe with Benny in a little bit,” Dean said.
“Cas, she's not violent I swear. I don't know why she punched Marv,” Dean said pleading in his voice.
“Will we see him again? I know Stella got attached, and then we never saw him again,” Dean said, looking at the photo.
Cas laughed, saying good points, but tonight they were working out the details of his arranged marriage, so he had to go. Charlie nodded, saying how she thought it was weird that they were being married off like the seventeen-hundreds. Cas shook his head. He agreed with Charlie, but his dad needed the money John’s company could bring in if they merged, so here he was being sold off like a prized cow.
Stella started signing and pointing at Jimmy. Dean already knew what she was upset about but translated the best he could, without getting in trouble.
“Nah, man, I got visitation with Cas this weekend; I'm good,” Jimmy said, turning to go back into the room.
Dean, who was born, first learned almost everything from watching the man assigned to take care of them. Dean learned to speak, how to read a little bit. Stella never spoke. Dean always answered for her, and no one corrected it, she did grunt and point to communicate, Stella was able to make small letter sounds like “D” for Dean. She mostly babbled like a baby.
”Be gentle, they are babies,” the messy hair man said with a rough voice, he looked down at the twins and gave a soft smile.
Dean moaned his response, making Cas chuckled, “I'll take that as a yes,” he said, admiring the red handprints.
Ivy took a deep breath looking at his hands, she didn't try to move them up or touch her she looked up at his blue eyes caring and encouraging. She opened her mouth to try and say something but nothing came out, Ivy shook her head frustrated that she couldn't tell them what she wanted.
Cas swallowed; not trusting his voice, he nodded; he felt Dean place a hand on his shoulder, getting him to turn around. Dean was such close inches away, looking at him staring at Cas as if he could read his thoughts. The sound of blood rushing, his heart pounding knowing that he was about to have the most amazing kiss of his life. Cas moved forward, watching Dean's tongue poke out a bit to moisten his lips; he was going for it, this time there was no backing out now.
Harper's violet eyes flashed a bright purple for a second, “I'm frustrated I wanted to see if you got anything,” she replied; she brushed her silver hair out of her face and looked at Karen, waiting for an answer.
“I will handle…..’ Cas was cut off by the yelling coming from down the hall, they ran out of the office to see what was going on.
“I know, I'm sorry, I'm just scared.” Ivy wrote down tears in her eyes as she looked at her brother.
He headed down the hall and into the kitchen, inhaling the sweet smell he adored. Dean's heart skipped a beat after entering the room, seeing the exposed back of Castiel. His muscles bent and flexed as he moved around the kitchen, it was hard to believe he was a robot.
“It's fine; it was a tense morning and evening, I get it,” Cas replied. He really did understand where Dean was coming from, and it was true he didn't understand what was going on with his new boyfriend's family. Still, he was going to stay and support Dean and Blue.
“You know the rules,” Dean said, leaning down so she could kiss him on the cheek; it was something she didn't mind, so Dean took it as a win. He never forced her. If she shook her head, he would shrug and say ok. “Thank you.” He handing Ivy the pie to carry as they followed Anna to Cas’s office, Ivy looked at Dean when they stopped in front of Cas’s office door as Anna knocked.
Cas stood walked to him placed a hand on Dean's shoulder. Dean set his hand over his knowing the doc was just as confused as he was. He like that Cas wasn't trying to explain anything away or ask him how he felt the comfortable silence was nice.
He was more than happy with his new car, grinning from ear to ear as they headed to a cafe for lunch.
“I knew it was you a month ago,” Dean replied, running his hand up Cas’s shirt and enjoying the hard muscles underneath.
“I know I was late. I'm sorry I had to go across town to get this,” Dean said, taking a bite of the pie.
“Good morning, Ash,” Cas said ask he walked into his office dropping his briefcase just inside the door before turning back to the man.
“It will be ok; Jimmy's not gonna run off with our TV’s. I think Ivy is good for him,” Dean smiled, pulling Cas into a hug.
“It's just something,” Sam replied, laughing at his siblings, taking a sip of his beer, setting it down on the table.
Stella touched the dresses with a tentative hand, not sure if it was ok. She looked at Jimmy, who nodded. Stella smiled and grabbed a fist full of the materiel rubbing it against her face it was ruffled tulle, and she moved to the next on doing the same thing until she found a soft cotton dress with pink and purple stars on it she pointed and then pointed to herself.
The Alpha let go of Dean's hands, grabbing the hem of the sweater, pushing it up over his head. Dean sat up, pulling it the rest of the way off before laying back down, but Cas had other plans. He pulled the Omega up and off the bed before pushing him down to kneel as he unbuckled his pants, letting them and his boxers fall to pool around his ankles.
"She smelled you and could hear the sound of your voice. It's deep, so it's easier for her to hear, and the house was quiet," Dean said.
Cas sat Dean down on the floor next to his desk; Dean looked around the office was huge a large window he walked over to look out of wondering how high up they were, large dark wood desk, computer a few pictures of Cas and Jimmy and few other people Dean didn’t know.
“She's 22 now why?’ Dean asked standing up and pacing the office. He was getting more and more heated as he thought about Ivy being hurt and not telling him, there had to be a good reason she wouldn't say to him of all people.
Cas was taken back by the photos he was seeing. Cas was expecting a picture of Sam with this supposed crush. But alas, they weren't. These were quick snaps of a girl taken at a distance. This girl was walking alone or talking to her friends. He side-eyed Sam and smiled. The whole family was nuts, and yet for some reason, Cas couldn't care. He could feel himself falling harder and harder for Dean. He also wanted to make sure Clover was safe, and he was sure Sam could take care of himself, but he wanted to be there for him.
She looked up at Jimmy; he nodded and took her hand, walking her over to the changing table. The doctor smiled softly at Stella; she looked down.
“Ash said you got up and left when he sat down,” Cas said. Ivy wasn't in trouble, but he didn't want to know if Ivy was avoiding Ash for some reason.
Sam nodded, reminding Dean that he had followed some Angels to town. They had to be around there somewhere. They should find them to work the Angels over and figure out what was going on.
“Is it ok if I bring her some pie tonight?” Dean asked, a hopeful smile on his face. He wanted to do something to cheer his sister up; he hated when she was down.
“Does this have to do with Wren and I leaving next month?” Dean asked a touch of sadness in his own voice.
Cas knew Dean was close to cumming, his ass started to tighten around his cock, pushing him closer to his own release as his knot began to grow. Catching the rim as Cas slammed into Dean one last time making the boy cry out, going limp in Cas’s arms as he pumped slowly came inside Dean.
“This is Castiel, Jimmy's twin. This is John,” his father introduced, stepping to the side to show a figure that was standing behind him who was dressed to the nines, a typical businessman.
“I'm sorry, Clover. I opened my mouth before I knew anything. Will you forgive me?” Cas asked, moving closer to the girl.
Stella made grabbing hands towards her brother he waved and smiled, happy they were in the same room again.
Taking a deep breath and picked at the label on the glass, he answered. “There's this asshole... always saying stuff ya know,” he took another sip of his beer, hoping it would calm his nerves. “Kept calling me fag and all kinds of nasty homophobic stuff. So I may or may not have set his car on fire.”
Dean shook his head. He didn't know what the handprint was from, but they were going to find out. Pamela placed her hand on Dean's biceps and the other on Harper's wrist telling everyone to join hands before repeating, “I call, conjure, and command you to show me your face.”
“What are you so happy about?’ Meg asked watching the doctor smile as he flipped through the messages.
“She says someone stole her baby,” Marv replied, looking sad. “I think someone did; she always seems sadder after those dreams.”
”Hang on, sweetheart I gotta get you changed, you are soaked, ” Jimmy said with a chuckle laying Stella down on the changing table.
“Then you’re human. I will still love you, and so will Wren,” Dean answered firmly, sitting up so he could turn to lay on his side and admire his boyfriend.
Andrea was hanging up the phone as Jimmy walked to his office and Cas to his tell Dean they would all eat lunch together.
Cas wanted to stretch his legs a few moments after Ash left. He headed down to the TV room to talk to Ivy. Ever since Jimmy showed up, she sits in there instead of at the window. Ivy and Jimmy were sitting on the couch just far enough apart; she could put her head on his shoulder; Cas smiled. It was sweet and innocent.
Jimmy looked at Dean, who explained what had happened and said he was sure Stella thought Jimmy was going to be mad at her.
Cas nodded “I understand what you meant, I like her too, but I can't have her hitting people,” he said.
Ivy heard the lock click and she looked up and smiled when she saw Dean getting off the bed to hug him.
His heart skipped a beat when he felt Dean calloused hand slip into his, the rough and soft at the same time he longed for this the closeness the feeling of the fur brushing inside his skin settled the need to be near Dean was fulfilled, he was content and happy at that moment. Dean leads him out of the kitchen, passed everyone in the dining room and down the small hall.
Cas was shocked when he saw the Queen walk in; she looked exactly like his mother, his human mother.
Dean sighed as much as he wanted to know what happened to Ivy he didn't want her to tell him if she thought something was going to happen.
“Cas is fine for the staff; I'm not big on formality,” he replied, shaking her hand. He smiled at her. She seemed nice enough, a bit of take no crap attitude.
Cas shook his head and went back to reading his book, ignoring Dean's attempts to flirt with him. Dean leaned over and rested his head on Cas’s shoulder and sighed, “What are you reading?” he asked, trying to take the book out of Cas’s hand, “I'm bored.”
Dean turned around to face the counter, taking a deep breath to calm his nerves. The way the robot had stared at him made him uncomfortable like the thing was looking into his soul. He only wanted to have an online date, jerk off a few times, and be done with it. What was he going to do with a sex robot in his apartment all day?
The man took a breath, telling her to wait that he could prove it was him; he was who he said he was; Harper shook her head not wanting to believe the lies it would get her killed, “What Harp, please,” he told the pleading in his voice made her second guess shooting him.
Cas’ snapped his eyes open; a small detail was right there on the tip of his tongue; he couldn't pull it from his mind. It was like his brain was trying to hide whatever it was that came for him that night; his stomach growled as Cas laughed a bit, heading to his room to put on pants before making himself something to eat. He grabbed his phone off the bedside table, shaking his head; he still couldn't believe he had slept for two whole days, hardly remembering anything that happened in that time frame. Castiel looked at the messages. Most were from work; this was the one time he was grateful to be a supervisor, especially in a small town. The other voice mails were from his mother yelling that he missed Tuesday night family dinner; he didn't even call to let her know that he wasn't going to show up; he sighed. Hung up, opting to call her back later after he ate.
He turned to look when his reflection caught his attention. His face was different; it was half skeletal, which was normal when someone was about to die. The other half, this was new, it was rotten. His eyeball hanging out, the skin peeling from his cranium, exposing the muscle and sinew underneath. He was horrified as he turned towards his sister. She looked the same as him, part of her face half falling off, hair thinned and barely there. This had never happened before, Wren stood abruptly and rushed to her brother, reaching for him to cling to his shirt. They both felt a life, but it felt much deeper, more connected to them as it was snuffed out instantly. Dean grabbed his chest as the pain shot through his heart. Wren could feel the pain as she wrapped her arms around her brother to comfort him.
With his attention entirely on the screen, his credit card information was all ready to go, all he had to do was click send when the time came. A lot of other people signed into the chat room, hoping his request would go through. He could feel himself getting hard, the Omega was just sitting there, running his hands up and down his smooth, soft milky white thighs. He absently wondered if they were hairless like most of the smaller Omegas he had seen. He wasn't picky about male or female. He liked both, but there was something that he particularly loved about the soft male Omegas with their lithe bodies and dainty hands. He loved the way their small body would squirm under him. He wished that his neighbor’s nephew, Alfie, had stayed longer, but he had to leave. He’d only stayed with the neighbor for a season before returning home.
“Anyways, Marvs nose is fine, I didn't even know she could throw a punch like that,” Meg said making her way to the back side of the desk to get things ready for afternoon meds.
“Harper Lee, girl, if you don't get down from that water tower!” Karen's voice carried through the silence pulling Harper from her thoughts.
As they pulled into the park, Dean and Stella, both got excited, pointing to different things and clapping. Cas got the twins out of the car while Jimmy grabbed what they needed from the back.
Dean hung up he didn't wait for an answer from Cas. He needs to process that the reason his sister tried to kill herself and doesn't talk was that some asshole raped and tortured her. He punched the wall and instantly regretted it, his hand was throbbing pretty sure that it wasn't broken but definitely hurt. Making his way into the kitchen to get some ice and the whiskey he kept for special occasions. Dean sat down on the couch with ice on his hand and a bottle of liquor.
“Ya, that's me, but I didn't...” Dean trailed off as the guy handed him a pen telling him again to sign.
Cas dug his keys out of his pocket, running to the car pressing the button a little too hard to unlock the door; he climbed in, breathing heavily as he started the car peeling out as fast as possible. Once he was far enough away from the house, he started to relax, wincing when he felt a pain shoot through his hand; looking at his as he stopped at the red light, he pulled a piece of glass from it and watched as the wound sealed up on it own, he was for sure he was going insane.
“I like him too,” Dean replied with a nodded, even though all there conversations were one sided, Ivy still knew how to get her point across to Dean. She smiled and pushed his shoulder making a kissy face at him
Dean went to Ivy’s room she was curled up on the bed asleep he didn't want to wake her so he went to Cas’s office door was closed so he sat outside it wasn't too long before the door opened and Ruby walked out.
Wren was in the break room at their table eating chips when Dean walked in. Taking a dollar from his wallet at the same time before he stopped in front of the vending machine, trying to decide what he wanted to snack on.
“I know, go on I wanna talk to Dean and show that to Marv, ok?’ Cas asked, moving to sit down in his seat making notes in Ivy's chart.
Stella tilted her head and looked at him, Dean sighed and repeated when he said adding in the signs, Stella nodded understanding it wasn't safe for her to go off alone, but she couldn't help it she liked to look at stuff.
The man paid no attention to Harper but focused on Dean as he moved to help his sister with the older woman.
Dean moved closer to the bed, “It's time,” he replied sadly, reaching out with a bony finger and touching the man’s cheek.
“I would like that,” Dean spoke with a smile, turning to head back over to the fridge to grab the beers. Dean motioned for Cas to follow him out onto the porch so they could have some privacy.
Ivy giggled. The whole room stopped talking and looked over at their table, Ivy hid her face in Benny’s arm. She didn't like being the center of attention.
Ash grabbed him by the arm. Jimmy turned and looked at him, a warning on the tip of his tongue to let him go.
He waited in line while looking over the menu, deciding which drink he wanted this morning when his phone dinged. Checking the screen, it was from an unknown number. Cas shook his head, ignoring it while shoving the device back into his pocket and stepping up to the counter. He smiled at the pretty girl behind the counter before placing his order for a tropical blend of nectar along with a tuna bagel. Stepping to the side to wait for his order, his phone went off one more time. He sighed in annoyance after spotting his brother's name. At least this was the brother he liked.
”Stella doesn't like bath time, ” Dean piped up about it, telling them that they were always too rough with her during bath time, so she doesn't like it.
“Yeah, I ask for her pudding. She says no now, but still, I wanted to sit with them watch TV; Ivy got up and left,” Ash said, throwing his hand up in the air.
“She had nightmares last night that could be why she is tired, and all the excitement today,” Cas replied standing up and stretching.
Dean smiled, “Yeah, it's like the family crest,” he replied when he looked up to see when Cas was pointing at.
Wren nodded in agreement before heading into their bathroom to change. Once they were both ready, Dean grabbed the keys to his beloved ‘67 Chevy Impala. He worked odd jobs around the Orphanage, saving up money to buy it from one of the neighbors. After he and his sister took the bus the first time, it did not fare well for them. They could not hide their skeletal side when someone was about to die. Their true form appeared right before a car plowed into the bottom of the bus, scaring the twins into not wanting to take the bus after. The staff took turns, driving them to work until Dean bought the car and got his license.
Cas pulled down the gravel driveway in awe of the large amount of property they had. The lawn was perfectly manicured; the house was a one-level ranch style. He wondered if all the siblings lived there or if it was only Dean and Salem. He parked behind the other cars, turning off the engine he took a steadying breath, grabbing the bottle, getting out of the car he could hear laughing coming from the back of the house as he walked up, wondering if he should head back there or go through the house, he sent a text to Dean who popped his head from around the corned waving Cas to come to the back of the house.
”Oh yes, you can wear clothes too, ” Jimmy said, standing, Stella held her arms up. Jimmy smiled, picking her up off the ground.
“I'm Benny,” he whispered holding his hand out. Cas shook his hand making note to not get on that guys bad side.
Stella turned away when she saw him, not caring that he was mad. Elle looked at Jimmy handing Stella a bottle of milk.
Jimmy looked for the cream to put on Stella. He could count her ribs; he sighed, feeling terrible that they weren't taken care of properly. He was going to have to be patient with her; she was just a baby.
Dean said ok, holding up his hands, stopping the flight attendant for another drink; Cas told him that two was his limit, he wasn't going to carry him off the plane. The Sub chuckled and said, ok, sipping his drink, saying he was fine as long as they didn't hit any turbulence, he should be ok. Cas nodded, reaching over and carding his fingers through Dean's hair, making him sigh and lean into the touch.
“I'm gonna go eat with Ivy,” Dean said backing up and pointing over his shoulder feeling like a fool when he bumped into the door frame as he walked out.
Gabe sighed and nodded, telling Cas he would see him later. They eat their food, talking about different stuff and what to expect when the King and Queen showed up. Later, Cas nodded, understanding what was expected of him. Once they were finished, they headed to the library to find the King, Henry, who spent most of his days going over the scrolls that held all the magic in their court.
“Yes, of course, I'll go with you. I was just about to go check on Ivy,” Cas said getting up from behind his desk making sure he had the keys.
“No. I mean, if you didn't want to and I wanted you to, would you say no?” Dean asked, trying to get the bot to understand what he was trying to say.
“Why do you do this to me?’ Dean asked tossing his fork on his tray and folding his arms across his chest looking at his sister.
“No. What do you wish for me to do? I could perform oral sex on you if you wish,” Cas replied, “I have no gag reflex per your request, or I could-”
“Thanks, Jo,” Dean said, not looking at her, “Ok I got you.” He whispered holding Ivy tight, as she sobbed into his neck.
He sighed as the boy finally removed his panties to spread his ass cheeks, letting the slick slowly leak out and make everything shiny. He growled as the person on the screen ran a finger up and down his crack. Stopping to make a show by rubbing a finger on his pink hole.
Dean grumbled a greeting while complaining about having to wear traditional royal outfits, tugging on Cas’s hand to follow him so they could get changed. At the same time, his grandmother helped Blue figure out the right color that matched Gabe and didn't clash with her hair.
”Um, I need to be changed, ” Dean said in a small voice, hoping he wouldn't get in trouble. Dean always got in trouble when he told their care person he needed to be changed.
Stella was watching she was worried when Dean started crying, hugging him tight after she let go Jimmy got her redressed, and they headed to the pharmacy; it was their first outing. Cas placed the stroller in the back of the SUV grabbed some snacks, Jimmy loaded the diaper bag full of stuff, making sure they both dressed and ready to go.
Gabriel turned down a dirt road, or Dean thought it was a dirt road. It turned out to be the driveway leading up to the house. It was smaller than Dean thought it would be, seeing four Novak children and their parents. The closer they got to the house, the more of the vast property Dean could see the snow clouds rolling in over the property line, commenting they had made it just in time. There was another car parked in front of the house. Gabriel looked at Cas, saying they weren't expecting anyone other than Cas and Dean until the following day.
Ivy looked at him with tears welling in her eyes, she was embarrassed and angry. She didn't want him to see her like that, then he would know he would be the same as the other doctors. Cas made his way into the room sitting down on the bed next to her as she curled up into a ball.
