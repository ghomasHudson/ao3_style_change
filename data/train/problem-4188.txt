And it was true. Usually, Dean always was the pessimistic one, seeing ends when things were just starting... but when it came to Castiel, he felt brave and confident about their future. He couldn't even imagine a life without him anymore, wondered how he had survived without him in the first place. Castiel nodded and squeezed Dean's slender, cool fingers holding his. A twitchy smile tugged at Dean's lips when a song whirred in his mind, urging him to sing it to his lover because it spoke to him so perfectly, showing exactly how he was feeling about his and Castiel's relationship. He brought his mouth to Castiel's ear, Castiel winced with ardent longing when Dean's hot breath entered his ear seductively. Very quietly, Dean started singing with his dark voice, letting it sink into Castiel's ear. The song was only meant for him, and it meant so much to Dean, he couldn't ban the slight tremor in his voice.
The drive to the jail didn't take long, because it was late and the streets were almost empty. Castiel was so lost in his forlorn thoughts that he couldn't even be bothered with making small talk, and the cab driver didn't seem to mind, only gave him curious looks. He payed him and walked inside, right to the reception of the prison – he knew this place quite well, so the lady, who smiled at him, recognized him before he had even produced his badge.
„Oh yes, Dean. Please, I haven’t heard you in years,” she burst out, making Dean laugh shyly. His eyes once again searched for Castiel’s, feeling terribly vulnerable and naked all of a sudden. Making music was such an intimate thing for him, and when he sang, he always felt like he was showing all of his heart to the world… But then their eyes met, and Castiel beheld him mutely, a tender, calm smile on his mouth, the look of his eyes bewitching, penetrating Dean’s insides wordlessly.
Just two strangers in a cold winter night, who have both missed the last bus home. Luckily, there is a bus shelter that provides warmth – as long as you hold hands to close the electric circuit. Too bad that Castiel appears pretty infuriating to Dean. Or is it something else? =P Inspired by the Duracel campaign "Moments of Warmth".
“Well, we’ve spoken on the phone every now and then, didn’t we," he circumvented any real answer, yelping and then laughing when Bobby kicked his shin under the table mockingly. Their eyes met and Bobby glared at Dean, half in jest, half threateningly. Dean couldn’t stifle the grin coming to life on his mouth.
"Let me take care of you... I'll make up for the soreness I caused...," he spoke against those trembling lips, and Castiel's lids fluttered shut. He groaned and arched his back, pressing his growing erection further into the warm tightness of Dean's palm. One hand came around Dean and he felt his lover's fingernails scraping over the shirt's texture helplessly.
“Oh, I’ve heard. You’re right, usually, I’d be pissed. But senator Gilbert just called me, right after he read the news.”
Dean finally lit his own candle and imitated Castiel’s actions. They were kneeling side by side, and for a second, it appeared strangely intimate and awkward to Dean. He could hear Castiel’s quiet breathing, he could feel his presence right beside him… but then his thoughts wandered off to Lisa, and he remembered why he had come here in the first place, and soon, he wasn’t paying attention to anything surrounding him any longer.
“He will be tolerated, Anna. I won’t allow an uproar among our guests. We will deal with it later.”
“You are really tightly wound,” Cas commented. Dean let his head fall down with a soft sigh, utterly savoring Cas’ little massage as his hands kept working on him. He really knew what he was doing. And there was a strength inherent in his fingers that made Dean completely speechless with arousal. Dean bit on his bottom lip, fighting against the uprising want and longing within him. Did Castiel know what he was doing to him? How good his touches felt? Dean realized then how touch-deprived he was, what a long time had passed since he had been touched like this – with caution, kindness… Dean dared to lift his eyes to Castiel’s, finding with shock and excitement at the same time, that Castiel was watching him, too. A knowing expression dwelt in those damn blue eyes, piercing through the protective shields Dean had erected easily. A suave smile graced Castiel’s mouth. He looked kind and meek, but Dean detected how dilated his pupils had become, how erratic and short-lived his breaths had become. That he was keeping up a façade of nonchalance, which was about to crumble any second now. Castiel’s eyes wandered hungrily over Dean’s face, got stuck on his mouth. Dean watched him biting down on his bottom lip as if he was fighting against the temptation to kiss Dean. It was the hottest thing ever. Dean gulped thickly. What were they even doing?
A grim will awoke within him, though, as he slowly picked himself up and got up weak-kneed. The fear and the panic he had felt narrowing his chest a few hours ago were gone. It was clearly recognizable for him what he had to do, and what he wouldn't allow to happen. He would put Alastair behind bars, sooner or later, and he would work his ass off to accomplish this. More importantly, he wouldn't be impressed with the fight Dean and him had – what they shared was so dear to him, he simply couldn't let him go. He would crusade for their relationship, and he would make sure Dean belonged to him further on. Castiel walked home, a settled expression veiled his face, as he staggered through the night and held his hurting ribs and stomach with one hand.
"What's going on, Dean? What's with all this secretiveness? You're not going to slaughter me, right?"
"Get a room, you two!", Ash yelled finally, making all of them laugh. Dean let go of Castiel and winked at him, then he turned around to Ash and stuck out his tongue to him.
Unf... so... eeeh...what do you think? x3
"Nothing", Castiel mumbled and sat down, focussing on the paperwork in front of him. Somehow he felt the urge to talk to someone about Dean, to lessen the pressure on his soul, but he didn't know if he could talk to Gabe about it. He felt ashamed and disappointed with himself, and he didn't want Gabe to see him like that. Gabe's silence revealed he didn't believe Castiel was alright, and the next time Castiel looked up he saw Gabe still beheld him with the same intense stare and serious frown. His rigid gaze made Castiel's resistance shrink, and he found something inside him crumble quickly. He sighed when he realized he had no chance against Gabe's curiosity, so he just shrugged his shoulders.
“After my mother died, I was all alone, Dean. I didn’t have any relatives or acquaintances, who could take care of me. I was all alone in the world, and I wasn’t even an adult yet. I needed someone to look up to, someone who would never let me down, who I could put all my trust into. And I think it’s reassuring to know he has a plan for me, a path I cannot always see, but a path already paved for me. It’s a reason to get up in the morning. A reason
Castiel bit on his bottom lip, his heart pounding against his ribs. How had his life turned so quickly from a dream to a nightmare? He wondered how he was supposed to continue living with a heartache so severe. He nodded to himself, then whispered into the phone before Dean hung up.
changed, all because of Castiel. Dean didn't know where this change was taking him to or what the future held for them, but he wasn't afraid and he thirsted to find it out, together with Castiel. No one had ever had this effect on him...
"Dean, I'm not a doctor, but I think you've got a tendon rupture. We gotta take you to a hospital", Sam said calmly. Dean cursed some more and hit the asphalt with a fist. Wrath boiled within him. If Sam was right, he would be knocked out for who-knew-how-long. It was an absolute no-go, now that they were trying to find the demon of whom they assumed had killed their father... Though their conversations with the last demons hadn't been too revealing, Dean felt they were drawing closer to the finish line. And now
Dean took his bell pepper as well and gave Cas a lopsided smirk through the laptop cam. This was fun. They were already arguing like an old married couple, and Dean loved every minute of it.
"It's alright, Dean... I mean, it's not alright, but it's okay", he heard himself blurt out, and a mischievous smirk came to Dean's kiss-swollen, red lips.
His parents called him during the late, lazy Sunday afternoon via Skype, and he accepted their incoming call reluctantly. The last time they had called they had been in India, and they had wanted to travel to Thailand. Castiel smiled a tiny bit when he saw his parents sitting in front of their laptop, apparently in front of a wooden hut, and there was jungle all around them. He could detect the sweat on his mother's and father's foreheads despite the terrible connection, and they greeted him joyfully. He couldn't really reciprocate their warm welcome, he still felt nauseous and injured, however, he forced himself to listen to their cloud of words mostly attentively – it did him good to hear they were healthy and doing well, and he actually smiled honestly when his mother laughed and told him about their language barriers with the locals. His head was emptied, while he listened to them, and he didn't find the strength within him to tell them anything about himself or what had happened within the last months. His parents seemed to notice his tranquility at some point, and they became silent, and he felt the scrutinizing glances of them both even through the computer program.
He unlocked the gun’s safety with a quiet click. Dean held his breath; in awe, he studied the man who had given him life and raised him. Would he really do it? Would he pull the trigger? Suddenly, Castiel behind him moved, positioned himself right next to Dean. Dean was so confused with the turn of events, he barely recognized what was happening. Stunned, he watched Castiel’s handsome face turn into a mask of stone, every of his fiber glowing with determination. He smiled unkindly at John.
"Hey, Sasquatch. How come they have my real name? What were you thinking?", Dean asked sternly, not too enthusiastic about seeing Sam laugh so happily when he was glued to a bed for
“Charlie,” he laughed, “it’s
“Well, worrying will get you nowhere, it will just drive you insane. He’s old enough to know what he’s doing. And even if not, it’s none of your business,” Bobby scolded. Dean chewed his bottom lip pensively, couldn’t suppress the sensation of endless, nagging concern in his guts.
Benny nodded, all playfulness in his watery blue eyes replaced with fondness.
He heard Castiel’s unsteady exhales, the shudder in his every breath. He sounded upset.
„Tomorrow night is karaoke night at The Roadhouse. You and Castiel should totally come.”
"Listen, Cas...", Dean said gently, producing restlessness in his bones, a wave of longing and affection splashed over him. He smiled gingerly, relishing the way Dean pronounced his name... it sounded so intimate, so close...
in all this time? Dean, it’s been nearly two months”, Cas said. Dean smiled wistfully and regarded Cas, feeling something tug at his heart. How could he explain all of this chaos inside of his head to Cas? That he didn’t want anyone else, that it felt strange to touch himself, because all he could ever think about was Cas, and that Cas wasn’t there? He smacked his lips, pressed his tongue against one molar as he contemplated Cas for a second.
“I’d love for you to come with me, Cas. But what about your parents? You’ve been missing for two days. Don’t you think they’d like to know you’re okay and where you are?”
Dean didn't take offence at it fortunately, he just framed Castiel's face with his warm hands and kissed his forehead tenderly, his lips staying on Castiel's skin just a second longer than necessary. They still touched Castiel's hairline when he found his speech again, his mouth moving against Castiel's hair ticklishly.
“I know. I got hurt pretty bad,” Dean scoffed, scratched the stubble on his jaw.
"I'm sorry, Dean. Sorry. I never meant... Sorry. Just forget it," Sam chocked out, and Dean's heart convulsed, his chest tightened. By instinct, Dean leaned forward and placed a comforting hand on Sam's shoulder, bending his head to seek for his answering eyes. When they regarded one another at last, Sam laughed embarrassed and shook his head as if he was scolding himself for his temper tantrum. He brushed over his face with the back of his hand and sighed raggedly.
When they were both spent and wonderfully exhausted, the sun was about to sink completely. Thunder was grumbling somewhere near, indicating that it was probably time to go home and seek some shelter. Cas and Dean lay side by side on the stone bank, panting and naked and grinning dizzily. Dean risked a side glance at Castiel, overjoyed about the satisfaction they had brought to one another and the confessions they had shared with each other. Even though he was worn out by their lovemaking, he couldn’t resist pecking Castiel’s stubbly cheek once more. He looked so gorgeous after an orgasm, Dean could have kissed him until the end of times. For a while, they just lay there next to each other, studying the swiftly moving dark clouds over their heads. The sky was a beautiful scenery this evening – the rays of the imminent sundown tinged the storm clouds in hues of pink, lavender, and orange. Dean had his head pillowed on his hands as he contemplated the sky. He listened to his inner voice and realized that there was nothing but peace within him, serenity. A state of mind he hadn’t had in a long, long time. Out of the blue, silly questions came to his mind, as he daydreamed about unlike future scenarios.
He stopped when his hands came to rest on Castiel’s collarbone, his dress shirt blocking the way for Dean. He wasn’t sure whether he was supposed to undress Castiel now, how far the other guy wanted this to go… But then Castiel beheld him with dark, knowing eyes – blindly he reached for one of Dean’s hands and put it in his lap, making Dean feel the hot, hard bulge in his trousers. Dean gulped thickly, gently squeezing and massaging Castiel’s clothed erection, whereupon Castiel just sighed and canted his hips towards Dean’s busy hand.
"What would you have me do? You know I'm not doing it for my pleasure", Dean quietly said.
"We better get out of here, before the whole clan closes in on us", Dean suggested, and Castiel found he couldn't hold back the breathy laughs coming out of his mouth when Dean grabbed his hand and they both escaped to the Toyota at a quick pace, hearing Dean laugh as well.
He withdrew his tongue slowly, before he thrust it in as deep as possible, rotating it in small circles. Castiel's insides were so scorching hot, he already loved how the other was tightening around him, keeping him in place. Dean initiated a wary rhythm, pulling his tongue out and shoving it deep inside again and again, licking at the sidewalls of Castiel's hole teasingly. He pulled his ass cheeks far apart so that he had more latitude, whereupon Castiel whined high-pitched. With gentle force he uplifted Castiel' ass further so that he could penetrate him better, and due to the new angle, he found the rippled, delicate nerve bud inside of him.
During the course of the next two weeks, Dean and Castiel found an easy pattern in which they were dating. Surprisingly, their lives mashed together without much fuss, and Castiel was confused about his own behaviour. He caught himself smiling dreamily, or laughing more often; though his grumpy self was a huge part of his being, he was less and less somber, he even made Gabriel laugh every now and then, which was normally a very rare occasion.
Hi my lovely readers - sorry for the late update :-) I promised you an update by the end of this week, and I really pushed that deadline...  This chapter has 10k... which also wasn't meant to happen, but oh well. I could have posted the chapter last Wednesday, but I wasn't happy with all of it... some parts I really like, others feel as if I'm constantly just writing "potato, potato", as if I'm braindead... :-) Now, onto said 10k...
"My god, Sam. You bitch! You're such a dumbass! You should know me better than that. I get you're upset and fidgety about the whole thing, but it's no good storming back there again and die for nothing. Let me think this through for a night or two, okay? We'll find a way and we will contain the problem. And whatever happens, you've got me, and I will not let you change into something evil. Got it? Oh, and by the way... Be a good boy and get me another bottle, would you?"
Castiel nodded negatively, smiled sadly. His thumb brushed over the back of Dean’s hand mindlessly.
"What? You said my driving skills leave a lot to be desired! So I might as well get drunk," Castiel bantered and poked out his tongue at Dean. Sam snickered at Castiel's insolence – Dean just wagged his head at him and sent Sam an amused glance.
He was way too tired to deal with all the emotional baggage knocking at his door when he left the bathroom. Castiel smiled sweetly at him when he shoved himself into the bathroom after Dean. Dean wandered into his room and flopped down on the bed, lying there on his stomach, one cheek resting on the mattress. He didn’t have the strength within him as he just lay there idly and felt his brain going haywire, like a freight train coming his way. Castiel found him like that and sat down right next to him. He had turned off all the lights, and now only the strong moonlight shone through the tilted window, creating soft shadows. Dean quickly looked up at Cas, only to detect the other man was smiling softly at him, a reflective expression dwelling in his moonlit eyes. Cas gently let a hand run through Dean’s hair, stroked along his cheek, and came to a halt. Dean closed his eyes and thoroughly enjoyed the fondling, having been touch-starved for way too long…
Their hot breaths met and fanned against one another repeatedly. Dean was dizzy with want as Castiel lowered his head, his eyes never leaving Dean's, and how he brushed his lips sensually over Dean's, never near enough to kiss him, but near enough to tickle and tease skillfully. Dean writhed underneath Castiel, twisting his chest from one side to the other to escape Castiel. He jiggled with his arms, in a half-hearted attempt to get free from Castiel's vicious grip, but Castiel just held him tighter and pressed his arms down on the mattress. Finally, his lover gave in and kissed Dean firmly and rubbed their groins together in slow, considerate thrusts of his pelvis. Dean moaned into his mouth, already hard from Castiel's dominant behavior. He had a hard time admitting to himself how much he liked being forced to submit and take the caresses Castiel was giving him. It made him hard beyond imagination, and when Castiel moved down on his body, his fingers shoving bothering textile away and pulling down his boxer shorts... when Castiel wrapped his lips carefully around Dean's completely hard length and devoured him greedily, leaving Dean breathless and shivering with lust... for the first time, Dean felt the need to be filled, the need to be stretched. He wanted Castiel beyond anything.
“You’re not, Dean.
Nothing but alarmingly infatuated, Dean examined Castiel throw his head from side to side hectically, how his ass came down on him in quick, harsh intervals. The dark-haired man was yelling with pleasure by now, clenching around Dean further, better, harder. A wildfire spread inside Dean, he felt the first electric impulses traveling through his cock – under the structure of the condom, he was already completely slathered with his own precome. He felt he was close and Castiel was squeaking and sobbing by this time, his fingernails scraping over Dean's exposed thigh, sliding restlessly back and forth. Dean heard his own surprised sob of relief; unwittingly, he sat up as his orgasm overran him, shoving himself remarkably deep into Castiel's fervent heat. Overwhelmed, he saw Castiel's torso fall down, he heard the other cry out between pleasure and pain, then he was trembling and convulsing around him unrestrainedly.
“There’s truly evil in this world, and you hold the power to defy this evil and see it behind bars," his voice boomed and his serious mien made everyone stare back at him flabbergasted, not knowing what to think of his words. Suddenly, the entrance music started, and thus Castiel’s speech was terminated. Castiel continued staring at them all with dark and piercing looks, but then he smiled a little, nodded to himself and left the stage. It wasn’t completely clear whether he had meant to finish his speech like this or whether someone had decided to cut him off, but Dean was certain the latter had happened. There was a confused murmur among the crowd, and even some giggles here and there, but overall, the audience was startled and perplexed after Castiel’s gloomy speech.
“Morning, baby.”
“Don’t you
When it was over, he was panting and sweat-through, and his lids were weighing tons. He became aware of Cas’ arms slung around his back, holding him closely, despite all their bodily fluids mingling. After a few moments of just lying there and gasping for breath, Dean managed to quickly disentangle from Cas, unroll the condom and wrap it into a tight knot. He threw it aside and lay down next to Castiel on the blanket, still flabbergasted and excited about what had just happened.
"I know, Sammy... Yeah, you're right," Dean replied reluctantly. Deep down inside of him he knew Sam was only sensible, he reminded Dean of the wariness he had forgone all too easily in Castiel's company. His mind told him he was clinging to a fantasy, to daydreams of a future that could never be. His heart protested when reality set in and clutched him with its firm hands, as its claws cut right through him. He continued talking to Sam, and their topics quickly changed, the discussion about Castiel was put aside for now. When Dean hung up a good while later, he felt like he had been torn in two. Ambivalent feelings wrestled inside of him, he struggled for a solution, absolutely helpless. It was a hindrance that he remembered the feeling of holding Castiel in his arms vividly. He could still feel his soft, dark strands as he twisted them between his fingers. He could still hear his breathing stumble the moment he had seized his hip firmly. A painful riot rumbled in Dean's heart when the memories of Castiel mingled with Sam's admonishing words. When he fell asleep, he still didn't know what to do.
Castiel was waiting by the Impala, his arms crossed in front of his chest as he leaned against the car. The afterglow of sunset painted the sky in manifold colors. Dean studied the colorful display of the firmament wearing its Sunday best – it was a mixture of deep blue, orange, and delicate pink, spotted with white, distant stars everywhere. The faint light of dusk was mirrored in Castiel’s eyes as their glances met. Dean stopped right in front of Castiel and gently placed his hands on his lover’s hips. There was a feisty sparkle in Castiel’s look as he scanned Dean’s face, nothing but lust for life. Dean estimated the bruises on his face, his bleeding nose, a cut of Aaron’s fingernails on his jaw… it was nothing too bad, but it made Castiel look kind of rogue.
"This is a diagram of the hierarchy in hell. Don't ask me where I got it from. Satanic online forum, weird people there. So, it shows the higher and lower echelons of hell's structure. And if we believe this sheet is of worth, then he have at least a trail to pursuit. It includes demons, spirits, name every nasty creature you've ever heard of. There are so-called first class and second class demons, then there are ancient and more powerful demons, they're... I think they're the second-in-command after Lucifer himself. And guess who our little friend Azazel is?"
Soon Castiel squirmed underneath Dean, ragged breaths filled the air. He was so respondent to every one of Dean's caresses... how he writhed when Dean left wet trails on his jawline with his tongue, how he contorted his body, tormented with lust, when Dean let his hot breath waver into Castiel's ear for a while... It felt right to expel Castiel's pants carefully, but Dean's heart pounded brutally against his chest nevertheless – nervousness flowed through him from head to toe as Castiel shuddered expectantly beneath him. His intuition brought his hand around Castiel's leaking hard-on; he encircled it with a tentative fist, watching the reactions changing on Castiel's sensual face. Dean felt like he couldn't breathe, his dick twitching restlessly, he was all fidgety. Castiel's eyes penetrated his with such certainty as he began jerking him off resolutely, albeit languidly. He wanted this to last...
"No, stupid. I just wanted to give you a compliment that you look
Twenty minutes later, Dean parked the Impala in the street right in front of Aaron’s somber-looking house. The sun was about to sink – they saw Aaron moving in the house, here and there the light was turned on. Dean killed the Impala’s engine and regarded Castiel contemplatively. Castiel was completely silent. He looked composed and sinister. There was a dark light shining in his eyes, which made Dean nothing but speechless. His posture radiated with infinite willpower, was all taut. Castiel was ready, that much was certain – he must have waited a long time for this night.
The next morning after breakfast, Dean, as well as Cas, were both busy packing their stuff, each of them in their guest rooms. Bobby was just cleaning up the kitchen downstairs, humming to old rock songs playing on the radio. Dean was trying to steel his nerves as he folded his clothes into a small pile, constantly telling himself that this was alright, that it
"Dean? Is that you?" Sam asked, Dean winced once he realised he had worried his younger brother unnecessarily.
“You may not like it, and it might sound odd to you… But I had found God. Or, to put it right, I knew then that
“Don’t pretend that you don’t want this, too,” Dean said quietly. The seduction resonating in his voice did the trick, for Cas’ breath became shaky when he breathed hotly against Dean’s mouth. Dean tilted his head and caught Castiel’s lips with his, both their eyes falling shut as the rush of sensations got the better of them. Castiel practically melted in Dean’s arms and replied to his kiss with vigor, taking and giving as much as Dean. Their exchange of caresses was just getting out of hand, when they suddenly heard someone clearing their throat.
Dean bit on his lower lip absentmindedly, let one hand stroke over Castiel’s clothed torso. He enjoyed the effect it had on him, how Cas tensed up with want, how his breaths accelerated. A dark light appeared in Cas’ eyes, and he moved closer to Dean. With his slender, long fingers, Castiel suddenly stroked through Dean’s short hair fondly while beholding him closely. A surge of arousal overwhelmed Dean, goosebumps appeared all over his body – delight burned hotly within him as Castiel tilted his head and closed his eyes, brought their lips together to a slow, deep kiss. Before Dean knew what was happening, he found himself replying eagerly, kissing Cas fervently. Cas’ hand wandered under his shirt, stroked his smooth, hot skin, glided over his pecs, over his ribs, again and again.
But Dean knew a conversation would come to no good. It would change nothing; it would only hurt more. So he tore his eyes away from Castiel and saw how his face fell – the tiniest ounce of hope left his former lover's visage and the coldness possessed his fine features once more. Dean watched briefly how he encompassed the key ring with a tight fist and clenched his jaw. He wished Castiel a good night and turned around – every step cost him a lot of his will power, it was a real effort to get away from everything he ached for.
“I wanna adopt him. I don’t know why, but I love him, and I feel responsible for him.”
He winced when Sam pressed one of his bear hands against Dean's bruised side, palpating the area with a concentrated frown. It hurt like hell and he moved away from Sam's prying hands. Sam scowled at him and Dean sighed, allowing the nuisance called his brother to proceed his checks. Obviously, it hurt so bad that desperate tears came to Dean's eyes whenever Sam applied gentle pressure to his left ribcage, but Dean had received more severe wounds in the last years. So he just gritted his teeth and took another few gulps of whiskey. Sam studied his features thoroughly, his thumb brushed over Dean's black eye carefully, testing the skin's structure. With a roguish, tentative smile Sam withdrew his hands and looked into Dean's eyes relentlessly.
He adjusted his blue tie and hitched up the sleeves of his white button-down shirt. Slowly but surely the summer's heat was nearing and he already dreaded the horrid months in which he was forced to wear a suit thanks to their dress code. The sun was constantly burning through the thin fabric of his black slacks, and he wished it was already evening so that he could get out of these clothes and have a cold after-work beer. He rounded the corner and caught a glimpse of Dean bending over a car while a blond-haired young woman, apparently Jo, stood next to him and talked quietly to him, a broad grin painted on her pale pretty face. Castiel hadn't even the chance to become jealous, because he had spotted Dean's jolly smile that lighted up his whole face while the woman spoke, so that his eyes revealed the charming crow's feet Castiel had come to love.
Just let me know if you wanna go
Sam reached for his bag and produced the D-EMF meter they had constructed the other day. A red light was blinking furiously and on the display coordinates beamed repeatedly; Sam held the gadget right under Dean's nose as if that was explaining everything self-evidently, but Dean just shrugged and frowned at his younger brother. Sam appeared unnerved due to Dean's lack of immediate comprehension, so he pointed at the meter with wild, enthusiastic gestures as he started to comment what the signs meant.
His obstinacy was rewarded when at last a cabin came in sight. It was plain and wooden, but it looked cozy. And what was more – it didn’t look uninhabited. A car was parked in front of it, by the looks of it an expensive one. Dean’s breaths faltered, then tripped over as he rushed to the cabin. He looked inside through the windows, knocked on the door several times, but nobody opened it. It seemed, after all, that no one was home. Yet by intuition Dean knew Castiel was somewhere here, that he couldn’t give up yet. It was as if he
They ended up making their way hand over hand along the iron bars above their heads, training their biceps and triceps in the process. Dean felt his whole torso shake, the movements being quite strenuous. He cursed Castiel's thick jacket, because he couldn't gape at his surely firm, muscled upper arms. He felt like an ape, as they repeated the motion countless times, hoisting their weight solely with their hands along the structure. His hands were freezing thanks to the iron bars. He watched Castiel swing himself a few steps away as Dean held himself on the bars, a broad grin on the therapist's face. Dean scoffed and shook his head; he couldn't help but envy Castiel's athletic figure and stamina.
“Alright,” he sighed, then he let himself fall back down on the bed and stared at the ceiling, incapable of looking directly at Dean when it came to
“Hey, you do you, I do me.”
Castiel was slowly but surely going stir-crazy; now that he had all the time in the world, the hours seemed to drag on. The cellphone in his hand felt heavy, the weight of its significance burdened Castiel. A few times he had entered Dean's number, only to turn the cellphone off again. He tossed and turned in bed, incapable of finding a convenient position; Castiel was more than nervous, he felt like a wreck. His insides wavered between fear of rejection and the thrill of anticipation – just to hear Dean's voice again... he was certain it would make him lose it. Once more he dialed Dean's number and gnawed at his bottom lip, and this time, he waited. He needed to talk to Dean again, he needed to make him understand, so that he could have him back.
It ached when he rolled off of Dean and when his lover's still erect cock slid out of him; Castiel lay down behind Dean with a grunt and forced himself to forget about the stretching, burning hurt within him, because his own length still throbbed heavily between his thighs; he had been so close when Dean had penetrated him, and it was still difficult to refrain himself from coming. Dean seemed comatose through his strong orgasm, still trembling with the aftershocks of it, and he didn't struggle when Castiel nudged him gently and rolled him on his side resolutely, so that Dean's bare back was facing him as he lay behind him.
The highway was an infinite ribbon, cutting through the deserted countryside of green and muddy pastures. In the opposite direction, a car occasionally drove by, and the bright headlights temporarily glared Dean. He drove his 1967 Chevy Impala, feeling the horsepower under her hood through and through. His baby was purring as he spurred her on, his foot on the gas. He had extensively polished the black beauty, which was his car, before his long-planned trip, and the black lacquer was gleaming in the sinking sun’s light. Dean had inherited this car from his dad, and he kept it in good honor – for one thing, to keep the memory of his dad alive, for another thing, because he simply loved old and classic cars. Cars like the Impala weren’t built anymore, nowadays cars just looked bulky and lacked any charisma.
Castiel smiled sadly, tears welling in his eyes, then he averted his gaze thoughtfully. It was like an arrow had been shot through Dean’s heart as he watched the misery unfurl on his lover’s beautiful features, wished he had never addressed the topic bringing doubt to his heart. With caution, he stroked through Castiel’s nightly dark hair, played with the smooth strands.
It took a good while until they left their bed this morning. After a long, shared shower, during which they had both almost fallen asleep due to their prior physical activities, they had managed to stroll downstairs to the kitchen. Dean had insisted to make breakfast for once, claiming they needed lots of carbs and sugar after their “workout”, so on the menu for today were waffles with strawberries and cream. Castiel didn’t complain, just grinned at Dean and regarded him as if he had hung the moon for him, stars practically glowing in his eyes. It made Dean all flustered and blush a little. Now he expertly stirred the batter for the waffles, having picked up a trick or two from Cas’ cooking skills over the years. The radio was quietly playing in the background with Dean’s favorite station, one that played old classic rock.
"Can't complain, Gabe. Thanks for that", he answered tersely, promising himself he wouldn't tell any details.
“I don’t know, to be honest. I have no idea where I’m going to first. For me, I think the road is my only destination.”
Apart from that, the mornings when neither of them had to work, were pleasantly relaxed and agreeably slow. Dean was always thrilled to find Castiel in bed with him when he woke up, the faint morning light illuminating his eyes like two precious gems, a delicate smile on his rosy lips when they looked at each other for the first time of the day. It seemed they didn’t need a lot to enjoy their time with each other – it was easy to talk to Cas about everything under the sun, came naturally to Dean. He couldn’t remember the last time he had talked so much. But he also loved to listen to Castiel’s musings without end, listened to his tales from his youth and childhood, that made him feel like he was getting to know Castiel better and better. And the more he knew about him, the more he loved him, adored him from head to toe. But, as a matter of fact, words were just an embellishment to the omnipresent truth, which rang clear as a bell in Dean’s head continuously – that he
, the poor dude had half his face swollen, his eye almost useless with all that swelling. I’ve seen some cases of domestic abuse in my time as a cop, believe me, but it’s rare to see it
he was. In the same vein, he was dying to get to know Dean from A to Z, it seemed like a worthwhile purpose in life. Without him, Castiel's days had become dull and lifeless, the minutes and hours were often a never-ending agony; just to be able to look into his eyes now, gleaming with the first silvery light of the stars and the moon, made Castiel unspeakably satisfied and intoxicated with love for the younger man.
Blindly, Dean turned his head, and his mouth found Castiel’s. He kissed him slowly, nearly coyly, suddenly choked with the realization of how much he loved this man. He let go at last, tried to calm his nerves, catch his breath. With an unexpected boost of confidence, he grabbed Castiel’s hand and intertwined their fingers.
Every source of life within Dean died like a drought killing all plants. Benny’s face appeared in his mind. He watched Anna’s diabolic sneer, her malicious pleasure for hurting Dean so. His will hardened. He pulled the trigger. His shot didn’t miss, hit Anna right to the middle of her forehead. Her body slumped down unceremoniously, instantly dead.
“Dean…” he quietly said into the phone, his voice rough and still laced with sleep.
Dean sped through Sioux Falls, headed down the interstate as fast as his police car allowed it. Via radio, he had maneuvered his back-up in the same direction. When Donna informed him that the tornado had touched ground only a few miles away from Castiel’s location, Dean’s heart convulsed with deadly terror. He pictured the worst-case scenarios without wanting to. What if he didn’t make it in time? What if… He shook his head, willing these glum thoughts away. He would save Cas, despite Aaron, despite the tornado, despite whatever. Embittered, he gripped the wheel tighter, floored it, so that the engine was blasting away.
“Let me rest in the arms of Morpheus, the god of sleep.”
"Deaaann...," Castiel whined, holding on to his head harder. Dean couldn't care about the lust-driven creature he became whenever Castiel reacted this unrestrained, when his breathing sounded so labored, his moans and whines so close to the edge... He licked against that sensitive spot with more force, hearing his own swift panting resounding in his ears. Castiel moaned raggedly and thrust his hips into the air when Dean let his tongue rest inside him and tickled his spot with the littlest movements of his tongue. Castiel shuddered and whimpered, lolling above Dean on the couch unknowingly. A wayward hand of Dean's ghosted over the inner side of Castiel's upheaved thigh, then he let his fingers massage the aroused slit between his ass cheeks. He could feel the tension building up in his lover, how his orgasm seethed in his very veins, conveying madness and pleasure easily.
“Oi! Are you two even working any longer or am I making a fool of myself here?” Bobby hallooed at once. Unfortunately, thus ended Dean’s little dream world, and the bubble Castiel and he had sat in burst violently. He and Cas gave a wince when they heard Bobby, both of them startled. How had they forgotten that they weren’t alone? Damn it. Castiel looked at Dean and chuckled, and soon, Dean was laughing too, feeling anything but awkward, but still excited, regardless of Bobby reminding them that they still had some work to do.
Dean was astonished. He hadn’t known people did that, but it sounded pretty cool. Even though he had to admit to himself that he was probably a little too shy to do something like that, allow himself to let the playfulness take over him, all judgemental thoughts aside.
"I want...", Castiel mumbled, trying to voice the vision which almost made him come right here and then in his pants. The clasp of the man's hands around his waist tightened and he noticed he pressed his crotch sharply against Castiel's again, making him gasp surprised. "Say it", he heard the man whisper seductively, and Castiel realized he was beginning to sweat; hot drops of sweat that were forming on his neck and torso and his forehead, which was still leaning against the man's.
„There’s coffee if you want some. It’s good, Dean made it,” he offered. Castiel’s eyes fled to Dean, and the two were smiling softly at each other, making Bobby want to tear his hair out. Castiel winked at Dean and stopped to get himself a cup of steaming hot coffee.
He watched Dean staring at him flabbergasted, his mouth stood agape, and it seemed he had stopped breathing. Castiel suppressed a salacious smirk and took Dean's finger into his mouth slowly, his lips wrapping around it lewdly. He started sucking on it and let his tongue glide over it, his eyes never leaving Dean's resting on his. He saw the effect it had on Dean; his pupils dilated with each second, Castiel elicited a surprised moan from Dean, seeing him shudder and pulling his finger gently back. Castiel released it with a filthy squishing sound, grinning at Dean in what he hoped was an inviting, enticing manner.
“Wait! There’s also one guy at the court, who has been shot in the thigh. He needs an ambulance right away. Over.”
“I’m sorry I couldn’t safe you, Liz. I’m so sorry,” Dean said in his mind. It only amplified the wistfulness in Lisa’s eyes.
"Cas, could you wait for a sec? I've got to make a few arrangements. Won't take long. Promised."
"Sorry, there won't be a lot of carbs or cholesterol for you within these walls. The clinic has a specially developed nutrition program, implying lots of vegetables and fruits", Castiel explained, and he laughed softly when Dean acted as if he had to puke and rolled his eyes.
“Oh, Dean, I’m sure he will soon come back to you. I mean, I’m into girls only, you know that, but even I can tell that you’re the real deal. Cas would be stupid to let you go. There’s plenty of women in our station, who keep drooling over you.”
„I’m not ready. I need time,” Castiel replied calmly. He withdrew his forehead from Dean’s and placed both his hands on Dean’s cheeks, made him look at him. The expression of his deep blue eyes was startling Dean – there was so much agony there, mingled with yearning and love and confusion. Dean could tell Castiel desired him, that he was hungering for Dean in the same frantic manner, that he maybe even loved him as much as Dean loved him. But he couldn’t allow himself to disperse in their relationship, to be happy with Dean – he just couldn’t, and this pained Dean – not only because of his part, but because he wanted to make Castiel happy, and he simply wasn’t allowed to. Castiel smiled sadly at him. His thumbs were stroking along Dean’s cheek lovingly, a fine caress, which created goosebumps all over Dean’s skin – it was the last straw, which finally made Dean cry. He let the hot tears flow down his cheeks unashamed, and he wished he could ignore how Castiel was brushing them away so kindly, because it just made him love him more.
“No, I’m sorry, Cas. It’s not your fault. I… I just got so pissed off, and I let it out on you. I’m sorry. It’s just… I saw Lisa in my mind, as if she had never left, as if she was still alive. And it moved a place in my heart I thought I had overcome. It was as if all healed wounds had suddenly opened again, as if I hadn’t mended in all those months at all. I guess it’s just a temporary thing, that I will sleep on it and be fine again tomorrow. But right now, I have half a mind to drive this car at full speed into the nearest brick wall.”
"I know it's hard to understand for others, but I know it's worth it. Whatever I did within the last years, it's worth it whenever he comes around for a visit and I see his geeky happy face twisted into nothing else but a broad grin. I'm proud of him, and he's perfectly happy, and that's all that matters to me... Wouldn't you have done the same for someone you love? Wouldn't you have given everything to make your sister happy as well, given the opportunity?"
“Come here…”, Cas rasped, and pulled down Dean’s head to kiss him again, and Dean was only too pleased to follow his invitation.
Dean started shaking violently, his body becoming out of control, as he was flooded by the experiences of the last weeks he had made. He tried to get a hold of himself, but knew he wouldn’t get the upper hand of himself soon. Swiftly, he looked for a parking bay close beside the highway, and when he found one, he steered the Impala to it and parked there for a moment. There were only nocturnal dark fields around him in this no-man’s-land, not a single soul or car in sight. For a while, he just sat there and stared into the darkness, giving in to his brain playing all the events of the last weeks on repeat.
“I’m still trying to solve this riddle, Dean. I don’t have all the answers to life… do you?” Castiel replied good-humored.
"You will get through this, Castiel. You may not see it now, but you are stronger than you think. You will get over this, you hear me?", his mother said with stern, stressed words, and again he nodded, though he couldn't feel the same faith. He covered one half of his face with his palm, as new tears began to arise in his eyes. Heaven forbid, he never wanted to get over Dean, but he couldn't admit it aloud, because he knew how bad this was for him. He would crumble underneath the heavy weight of his shoulders, and he would drown in his pain, but to forget Dean and their time together was simply no option for him. He gulped hard and told his parents he was tired and needed to get some sleep, and they made an appointment, so that they could have another conversation as soon as possible. He shut down his laptop and put it on his nightstand, trying to digest what his parents had said to him. It was achingly strenuous to get up and to let down the window shades, but it was worthwhile to lay down on his bed in the welcoming darkness. For a while he stared at the ceiling, trying to think of nothing, to feel nothing. He worried how he was supposed to continue his life from here on.
He sped along the highway, night closing in around him. The summer’s heat was slowly abating as the day was ending; Dean was glad he had chosen the nighttime for the long drive back to Saint Louis, for the temperature was more tolerable now. Headlights of other cars driving in the opposite direction started blinding him. He felt as if he was in a coma, traumatized. With determination, he drove down with his foot down to the floor, ignoring all speed limits with indifference. Visions of Castiel appeared in his mind. He bit on his bottom lip, willing the images away. With erratic movements, he turned on the radio, hoping it would distract him and his mind off things. A little smile fled to his lips when he heard what song was currently playing: Black Sabbath’s „paranoid”. With satisfaction, he turned up the volume and listened to Ozzy singing, accompanied by heavy guitar riffs and a fast drum.
a little something…? Well, I’m not complaining. I missed your cooking.”
"You're trying to kill me", he pouted, whereupon Castiel just laughed. They came to a halt when they reached the abandoned climbing frame, and Dean eyed the iron bars and wooden bridges, meant for children, of course, skeptically. He let his crutches fall to the floor and stood face to face with Castiel, who still smiled, unperturbed with Dean's sulky mien.
When the rainstorm stopped for a second, he could see the road ahead better again – but the van had disappeared. Dean’s throat corded up painfully. Damn it. His heart was racing, his breath stumbling. This couldn’t be happening. He looked around in despair, searching for the van hectically. Damn it! He steered the car towards E. Madison St., guessing this was the road Aaron had taken. With nothing but frustration, he turned on his radio device again.
“Good that we don’t have to work tomorrow, right? That means we can party hard tonight,” Benny said. He gave Dean a boisterous grin. There was a mad shimmer of pleasant anticipation in his eyes.
They got up and strolled down the corridor, towards Castiel's bedroom, Dean recognized, and it made him all flustered inside. He almost choked on his own breaths as Castiel vanished in his bedroom, an odd, constricting sensation dwelt in his chest at the thought of following Castiel to such an intimate place. Once he stepped into the room, he saw the walls were ornated with a grey-blue wallpaper, in the middle stood a spacious bed; the only furniture apart from the bed was a waist-high, dark wooden dresser and a nightstand. On the walls were a few racks, and on them countless carved figures stood. Dean let his eyes roam over them in awe: The attention to detail was magnificent, automatically he stepped closer to the racks, feeling Castiel's eyes observing him all the while. He saw birds in all possible variations: Owls with spread wings, doves, eagles... Next to them there were a few sculptures of humans, some of them engulfed in an embrace, some of them huddled in desperate, forlorn positions – but all of them had no faces. Dean was certain he would never tire of looking at those carvings, but then he felt a warm hand on his shoulder.
"Hey, I feel kind of bad; you told me so much about yourself the whole week. I feel like I owe you," Castiel said with a terribly beautiful, toothy smile – immediately the bad memories faded away, and Dean soaked up this gorgeous smile, seeing how it reached those deep, blue eyes. He replied with a smirk, feeling ease spreading inside his belly.
The weekend passed like a hallucination, and Castiel was altogether delusional and shell-shocked. He knew his behaviour was extremely unhealthy, but he could not eat, and he could not sleep properly. Somehow he felt numb, and he was glad for this. He buried himself deeply in household chores, and every room was thoroughly cleaned, as sterile as if no one even lived in here, and Castiel thought with a grim smile that it was true to a certain degree, because he felt like a walking corpse. He drank a good deal of coffee and tea to calm his empty stomach, and sometimes he dared to let some of the pain out to release his mind. Then he allowed himself to show some emotions while he played the piano, but only somber melodies fell from his fingers. One time he had been idiotic enough to try playing the song which reminded him of Dean, but he stopped very soon, as memories of Dean and their time together overcame him, and he cried long and silently.
While they waited for their dinner, Dean studied the restaurant and the customers with interest, though he was mostly interested in the intriguing man sitting opposite to him. Again and again his eyes came to rest on Castiel. He looked stunningly
He patted Castiel’s shoulder amicably, then climbed the stairs to his room, so that he could read a book in peace and give Castiel some time alone.
Dean frowned.
He dared to thrust into him, slowly and with force, and it seemed to do the trick for Cas. A veil of reddishness covered his cheeks; he squinted his eyes shut and his jaw dropped as his mouth stood sensually agape. Dean watched his dick disappearing in Castiel’s heat again and again; he loved to see how he spread his lover, how deeply buried he was inside of him. It was hot and intense. When Castiel’s moan became more unrestrained, high-pitched and sultry, Dean leaned down to kiss him with all he had, swallowing the sounds Castiel made. Being thus bereft of fresh air, Castiel let go as his orgasm overwhelmed him. He squirmed underneath Dean, his body buckling mindlessly, as he came hard. Dean felt him come, felt his muscles constricting around him, holding him in place with all might. He was panting as he sensed Castiel’s hot come against his abdomen.
Cas kept looking down, cradled his beer loosely in his hands, and frowned.
Castiel nodded grimly. He also didn’t seem too hopeful regarding the matter. There was a moment of heavy silence, each man clinging to his thoughts.
A deafening moan reverberated in the room, and Castiel could actually feel its vibrations rumbling through his whole body. He shuddered deliriously happy when he saw Dean screwed up his eyes and when he realized Dean came within him, euphoria flowing through him as his abdomen convulsed and as Castiel rode out every of Dean's deep thrusts. He felt Dean's erection twitching inside of him, as Dean was squirting his come into the condom. Castiel bit his bottom lip sensually while he regarded Dean bathing in the glow of his orgasm, he was a wonderful sight for sore eyes, and the way he tossed and turned while tortured moan after moan left him, made Castiel almost come too, but he forced his body to stay controlled. The dismal thought within him made him furious again, to know he hadn't retrieved Dean completely yet.
THE END
“Dean?”
"Sorry, I guess it's late, and I still have to get the packing done", he excused himself. He sat up and tugged Dean's legs above his thighs, so that they both were able to use the backseat in the most comfortable way.
"Cas, we will be late!", Castiel heard Dean call through the apartment, and he chuckled and nodded his head in disbelief. He knew they still had plenty of time, and that it were simply Dean's nerves pushing the younger man over the edge. So he had no qualms about redoing his tie's knot again, dissatisfied with the way it had looked. He checked his appearance in the head-high mirror – he was wearing a dark blue suit, a white shirt and the dark brown tie he was fiddling about with. Dressing up like that was actually nonsense, because his and Dean's long winter coats would hide their fine suits anyway, but they both wanted to appear appropriate for the occasion. Castiel grinned broadly, as Dean entered their bedroom and gave him an exasperated look.
"What the hell are you doing here?" Dean whispered, a broad grin spreading over his face. Castiel looked up from below, his face wet with rain. He seemed breathless, as if he had run here. Dean watched him producing a little Tupperware container from underneath his soggy trench coat. He held it out to Dean with a tender smile and Dean accepted it slightly confused. When he opened the box, his heart made a wild somersault and his heart constricted with love and amusement: A piece of apple pie, a fork and some cookies. Could he have asked for more? He gave a brief laugh and bit down on his bottom lip as he beheld Castiel pensively, happily surprised at his unexpected visit.
So, I don't think bonus chapter 2 will be posted next week, I need some time now to cool my stupid head and relax a little - but you'll never know, apparently I'm an insane writing machine...
“So, that means I can’t abduct you somewhere else?” he whispered, his face suddenly very close. Dean could feel the exhaled words on his bottom lip. Castiel’s hands on his hips, holding him close. Heat bubbled in his abdomen, made him half-hard in his blue tuxedo trousers. He felt completely like braindead goo. He hungered for Castiel’s kisses, for his passion. Dean felt his lids droop, fraught with lust, as he took one step closer to Castiel, towards his heat. He tilted his head a little, and their lips almost touched. With glee, Dean noticed how Castiel tensed up now, overwhelmed with yearning. Dean could see what he was doing to him, and he liked it. Castiel’s fingers on his hip dug into the pliant flesh, stirring up a burning, all-consuming need within Dean so that he nearly lost all his thoughts.
“It’s my last night in freedom… and I wanna spend it with the man I love. Will you stay with me for one last night?”
When Dean hung up a good while later, the sun had almost gone down. He felt a whole lot better after hearing the voices of Sam and Jess, and pouring out his heart to Sam. Lost in thought, he watched the tangerine sun sinking on a pale blue horizon. The golden evening light fell on the streets and surrounding houses and trees, created long, soft shadows. Somehow, he felt completely calm now, prepared for his new life in Sioux Falls. He looked around the surroundings he had gotten so accustomed to, the loud noises of this busy town, and felt already detached from it all. He was already becoming a stranger to this city, and soon he would be gone.
"Well, are you, uh... are you lonely sometimes? Or why did you say it?" They arrived at Castiel's office and walked inside, Castiel shut the door behind Dean and regarded him with a long, pensive look, while they stood there face to face. Dean sensed his knees were going weak, the longer Castiel looked at him like that – he wasn't sure, but he thought he saw something akin to sadness dwelling in the expression of his beautiful blue eyes, and it burdened Dean with a heavy weight to see this gorgeous, young man look so haggard.
Dean was rather tensed up when he called Cas after work, but this nervousness soon evaporated into thin air. There was no reason for Dean’s worry, for this time, he and Castiel talked all calm and relaxed. Not one loud word was uttered, there wasn’t any mentioning of wounded pride or aching yearning for the other. They just talked and talked, and time flew by as they chatted blithely. Somehow, their topic changed to their favorite movies, and then Dean listened to himself gush over classic westerns and eighties’ horror movies, laughing and arguing enthusiastically with Cas why a movie sucked or didn’t suck. It felt as if he was talking with a long lost friend, and all worries and tensions faded away from Dean’s mind. After a while, their conversation became softer, though, quieter, as it got late and they grew tired. Cas yawned heartily, making Dean smile with tenderness.
„Yeah, I know… Let’s talk tomorrow, Dean. Sleep tight…”
A few days later, Cas was in the garden, doing some climb-ups on the iron bar they had installed there a while ago. He was shirtless, displaying his sweaty, muscled torso and his strong upper arms. Dean's mouth was watering at the given sight. He watched a drop of sweat running along Castiel's temple, and he swallowed thickly. Damn. For a second, he almost forgot what he had come outside for. Castiel was really distracting… and the strained moans and grunts escaping his mouth every now and then were just pure sin. Cas finally noticed Dean and gave him a quick side glance while continuing his climb-ups.
Wow, hello people! Did I do something wrong? I miss some of my commentators sniffles I hope you're still here! Anyhow, my bad conscience makes me update this chapter tonight lol, and still so so sorry for this awful cliffhanger; Honestly, THANK YOU for your kind reviews, I read them over and over again and I really appreciate them so friggin much... especially tonight, because I have to write a difficult chapter for this story... I think I'm going to get drunk. Have a lovely weekend...!
They hit the road and Sam sped mindlessly, using all the horsepower the Impala could give. Dean looked back through the side mirror, recognizing six running black dots following them pointlessly. Inwardly, he said quick prayers, thanking their fate. They had escaped.
“Yeah, you might say that. I guess I got carried away with my beliefs”, Castiel admitted abashedly. A moment elapsed between them, in which they just beheld the other attentively, curiously, both probably wondering where this might end. Finally, Castiel reached out his hand and introduced himself. “I’m Castiel, by the way," he said – and Dean took his hand and shook it once, firmly, marveling at the strength of Castiel’s slender long fingers.
"Why don't you get changed and meet me in the basement? I'll be in the pool waiting for you," Castiel suggested quietly. His low voice caused goosebumps on Dean's skin, made him light-headed and entranced. He nodded, absolutely dumbstruck, and Castiel squeezed his hand, then he let go and was gone as quickly as he had come.
"Thanks, Dean. There's just one more thing I wanted to show you..."
Dean gulped against the lump of pain, but it didn’t go away. He heard himself sob uncontrollably, his whole body trembling like a leaf. Castiel leaned into him, hid his face in the crook of his neck. Dean sensed the wetness of his tears against his skin, as Castiel quietly cried, too. Breathing heavily, he put an arm around Castiel’s back, held him tighter. His nearness was so familiar, gave him some solace. It felt as if Cas was the only pillar keeping Dean on his legs right now. He was about to lose his sanity, he was so overwhelmed with the loss of his dad. His and Sam’s eyes met, and Sam was crying so hard, it was painful to see. Then Dean’s glance fell on the marbled floor, where pools of dark red blood were forming, expanding slowly. It was Zachariah’s blood, and John’s blood, mingling there on the otherwise immaculate floor. Dean wiped the tears away with a nervous hand. He shook his head subtly, smiled a little. The Montagues’ and Capulets’ blood, united at last.
"I need you, baby... I need you", Dean exhaled, and his voice had become dark and husky. The mere sound of his voice made Castiel's hair stand on end, and he choked on his own breaths. His heart leapt into his throat, and he could only nod to show Dean his consent. God, he wanted him... he wanted him so badly, it tore him in two. With shaky fingers, Dean grabbed the condom and tore it open, and Castiel shooed his hands away determinately, as he took the condom and rolled it over Dean's pulsating erection slowly, their eyes never leaving the other's. Dean moaned, as Castiel had unrolled it to the hilt, and he grabbed the lube quite naturally and slathered his lover's erection generously; he loved the way Dean's fingernails bruised his hips as he pulled him closer, while Castiel massaged his dick with a tight fist and forceful, lengthy strokes. Their bodies were both trembling, when Dean clutched Castiel's ankles and wrapped them around his shoulders, so that Castiel's ass was exposed to him in the most tempting, thrilling way. Dean inhaled deeply, his eyes were fixed on Castiel's, and for a second, they stilled, as if they were both perishing in the moment of their oncoming union. This was, where they were supposed to be, in each other's fiery presence, making love to each other. The fights and tears were forgotten, and there was a moved smile on Dean's mouth as he looked down on Castiel, making Castiel's heart throb loudly, and he blushed and replied to the smile cautiously.
“I wouldn’t say that. If only, the last years strengthened my beliefs. But it always felt as if it wasn’t the right fit for me, as if something was missing. Looking at you now, I think it was you.”
Dean grinned sheepishly and scratched his head, on the brink of admitting Sam was right. Indeed, he had more often thought about ways to seduce Castiel instead of explaining him how to kill or fight off all kinds of eerie beings.
"Lay down. We'll do some warm-up." Dean had to try real hard to stifle a laugh or a sexual innuendo. So he complied to Castiel's instruction and lay down on his back, placing his crutches next to him. Castiel knelt down to his side and examined his body thoroughly, causing sparks of heat inside Dean's stomach. A river of warmth spread in his spine, and if he wasn't utterly mistaken, it was a feeling akin to lust – he couldn't suppress the sensation the longer he observed Castiel's eyes regarding him so attentively. Then Castiel touched his shoulders and pressed against them with his nimble fingers, squeezing Dean's taut muscles.
His voice got lower and quieter with every word he said, and it created a shiver of goosebumps ghosting all over Dean’s body.
Dean didn't even have to consider Castiel's proposal, he had already made up his mind. He risked a thoughtful side glance at his lover, was moved by the sincerity he read in his look. Castiel was so devoted to him, he was ready to throw away everything. He couldn’t ask that of him. It wouldn’t be fair to be so selfish in his love for him, to demand so much.
Bobby croaked and imitated him (very poorly, by the way). “Very funny, Dean. Talking with you on the phone is like talking to a hotline – you get a lot of talk but very little information. I mean… how are you
All at once Dean was all ears, oppressing his emotional life for a second. Exploring new avenues to ward off evil were always exciting to him. He had come upon many ways in his life to make the hunt easier or safer: like the one time had built his own EMF machine with an old walkman, or when he had been an elementary school child crafting his own double-barreled rifle... The hunch of a smile came to Sam's lips when he regarded Dean, obviously comprehending the nature of his attentiveness.
“Yeah, it’s actually a little funny, to have two lawyers and a cop in the family,” he commented – which made Dean and Cas look at each other and grin, because they both remembered that Dean had told Castiel the same thing many, many months ago. Castiel shrugged his shoulders innocently and smirked.
The drive back home was plunged into welcome laid-back silence, as Dean steered the Impala through the night. The car radio was quietly playing relaxing blues songs. At a red traffic light, Dean risked a side glance to Castiel - he spotted the lingering, little smile on his mouth, the joyful gleam in his eyes brightly reflected by the streetlamps. He was content, even happy, it seemed. Dean was stunned about the transformation Castiel had undergone in just a few weeks – from a devastated, beaten-up survivor of an abusive relationship, to such a tranquil and blissful man, who could smile again and enjoy the little things in life. It made Dean unspeakably happy to see Castiel like this – carefree, unburdened. Castiel noticed his glance and their eyes met, whereupon they both just smiled carefully. The traffic light turned green and Dean put the car into first gear and drove off.
“I miss you, too, Cas”, Dean whispered into the phone. “We’ll figure this out someday, somehow.”
„Dean,” Bobby sighed unnerved, not in the mood for playing games, „I have eyes, okay? Don’t you think I pick up a scent when I’ve got you two around me all day for weeks? You don’t have to tell me anything, son, but I want you to know that it’s okay, and I’m here if you wanna talk. That’s all.”
Dean opened his eyes then, deciding this conversation was more important than sleep.
", he retorted playfully, hearing Dean laugh.
All of a sudden, Dean spotted Sam, who was running toward him, a hunted look on his face. He called Dean’s name, stopped in front of him out of breath. He touched Dean’s shoulder with a firm grip. Dean looked into his brother’s eyes, saw the same pain he was feeling mirrored there. It nearly brought him down to his knees, he was so overwhelmed with the loss of Benny, with the atrocity he had just committed. Sam’s fingers dug into his shoulder almost achingly as Sam searched for his eyes.
“Your mom was right, Jack. I’ve been telling that Dean for ages, but he’s not listening. Also, I gotta admit, he makes really good hamburgers, so it’s basically impossible to resist. Come, let’s check out the other rooms.”
“Alright. Then I go upstairs and, I don’t know, go back to bed or whatever,” he laughed helplessly. When Castiel turned around to leave, however, Dean thought he could see tears welling in Castiel’s eyes – tears of despair and hopelessness. He bit on his bottom lip pensively, wondering if Castiel would be alright.
He paused and beheld Dean with a coy smile, and Dean thought it was the sweetest thing ever when he detected a veil of blush clouding Castiel’s features. He looked so meek and innocent, so immaculate… Cas smiled then and looked away again.
