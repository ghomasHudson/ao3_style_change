Tony laughed, bitter and hard. “You really thought you could just stroll back in after you were the one to walk away? Captain America, boldly going wherever the fuck you wanna go. Christ, you’re like a bad joke.”
Then he pulled away and began to cough in tight, harsh barks. Even as someone replaced Steve’s oxygen mask and the spasm slowly eased, Tony focused only on the sensation of his fingers trailing through Steve’s hair, along his brow. He didn’t notice when someone replaced the visor over his face, too busy was he memorizing every expression that flickered across Steve’s face. Serene and pale, Steve lay and stared right back at him, eased into the deep contentment Tony had witnessed only briefly, once before.
He is dizzy. Drowning. If all things are possible, then… He stares up at the sky, streaks of fire in the distance. New York is burning. Somewhere, a nuke is being prepped for launch. He could stop it. He could stop all of it.
Dropping his show of disinterest, Tony eyed him flatly. “Not gonna lie, wouldn’t be my first choice. But you’re too dangerous to let loose, otherwise.” And if Tony’s gaze flickered in Steve’s direction before he stopped himself, it probably didn’t mean anything. A reflex. Coincidence. Besides, even if he could think of what to say, the shame was gathering thick in Steve’s throat, leaving him too choked up to speak.
“I… I do not refuse,” she whispered, her face crumpling. “But how can I… What happens if the one I love is already dead?”
Out of nowhere, an idea sparked in Steve’s mind. “Actually, yes,” he said. He explained his idea, a bemused Tony listening in; the Stone laughed at him but she agreed, and Steve sighed, satisfied.
Tony, watching from the Sanctum’s rooftop, had leaped into flight before the suit had fully deployed, and managed to catch Wilson three seconds before he smashed into the ground. “Gotcha,” he murmured, swinging the other man to disperse his momentum before releasing him to roll safely along the ground.
Tony sat in the empty room, staring at nothing, until Okoje burst in impatiently. “Launch time, Stark,” she announced, then paused, her gaze sharp. “Is something wrong?”
But there were cold metal fingers digging into his chest, and then Tony was roughly shoving him away. Again, Steve fell on his ass; Tony loomed over him, his former blank reserve replaced by a boiling fury, his gloved hands instinctively raised.
Nat nodded; of course she was already aware. “Steve retreats into the job whenever he’s uncomfortable, blocks out everything else,” she explained to Rhodey, then turned back to Tony. “But now I’m wondering, what on Vormir could have made him this uncomfortable?” When Tony didn’t answer, she sighed. “Tony, you and Steve have been inseparable for months and then you sacrificed yourself so Steve can get the Soul Stone. You have to know he loves you.”
Tony’s mind took off in so many directions at once that all higher brain function tangled itself to a halt, but luckily - luckily? - Steve had already stepped away to grab the last empty container. His muscles rippled visibly underneath his white t-shirt - water makes wet, Tony’s genius mind observed - as the super-soldier hoisted the container over his head and looked at him expectantly.
With a soft moan, Tony collapsed back into his chair, hands covering his face. Seeing his distress, Steve had to blink away bitter tears. All he’d wanted was to protect Tony, now he’d only hurt him more.
An unexpected noise at the door brought them both swinging around. Steve. “They’re away, we can proceed whenever you’re ready,” the super-soldier announced. Nebula sniffed and turned back to the Stones, seemingly fine with this development.
But if Steve also liked men, why would Tony’s idiotic chattering bother him? And why would he choose to hide this part of himself now, here in a more tolerant century, among people that would clearly support him? The only answer that made sense to Tony is that, yet again, he had overestimated how close Steve had ever felt to the team. To Tony.
He asked her and she laughed. Of all things, she laughed, but there was a bitterness to it that pierced him.
“Night, Bruce, Natasha,” Tony said. Tiberius gave a quick nod goodbye, already disinterested. The others watched in silence as they left.
The former Avenger caught it without even looking. “Don’t be cranky; it’s a common practice among senior citizens. Plus I know you have some big plans for later.”
They put him somewhere soft, soothing voices in his ear. He could feel arms around him, warmth on either side. Could hear crying. Maybe his. Maybe not.
His optimism was exhausting. “Making more would take weeks, maybe months,” Tony explained gently. “He doesn’t have that kind of time.” Steve didn’t have any kind of time.
, the other man pulled off his oxygen mask so he could nuzzle deeper into Tony’s hand, lips rough against Tony’s palm. Tony was so absorbed in this sensation -
After a few minutes, Tony sighed. “It’s a better plan,” he informed Steve, and yeah, that was Tony’s breath on his neck.
“The kid deserved the heads-up,” Stark said, shrugging. And his lack of remorse provided the spark which finally detonated Steve’s last nerve, a torrent of hot fury exploding through his entire body.
Unable to resist, Steve seized Tony’s mouth in an eager, clumsy kiss. “God, yeah,” he muttered when they broke for breath. “And, and vice-versa, Tony. Everything.”
Tony dismissed the front of his helmet but retained his sunglasses display, gesturing for everyone to calm down. “Hi Thor,” he said cheerfully, loud enough so the cameras could at least pick up his side of the conversation. “Welcome back to Earth. Been a minute.” His words sent a ripple of visible relief through the crowd.
“There,” Nebula breathed as soon as she saw the mountain. “I think… we must go there.” The blue glow was visibly pulsing under her skin, and Tony exchanged a long suspicious look with Steve. But it was the best lead they had.
Yet Steve had realized the implications of Tony’s words, and stared at him. Awe. “You didn’t ask, because you knew you could do it.”
Steve had been watching him, unspeaking, as physically distant as he could get given their joined hands. “Can you stand?”
. He had to remember that Thanos was defeated, desperate; chances were he’d say anything he could think of just to spoil their victory.
“All friends again?” she asked, and Tony squeezed his eyes shut, wishing he could split himself in two, live the life where he broke her heart, but somehow spend the other as the man she deserved.
“Pretty sure it’s just a you thing,” Steve corrected him sleepily, then panicked. Maybe that was too much truth.
They broke apart only for breath, neither of them shy, yet neither speaking; this close, there was no need for words. No, they weren’t friends anymore. They were on the far side now, each reaching for the other in mutual desperation. Steve found himself ripping at Tony’s shirt, his fingers seeking the smooth skin of Tony’s sides, his muscled back. At Steve’s touch, Tony groaned and wriggled further into his lap, and Steve hissed at the feel of him, grinding against his cock. God, he was fully hard already.
And even before Steve froze, Tony regretted the quip. Things had been so comfortable between them lately, he’d allowed himself to forget how easily these moments had ruined them before. How constant petty conflicts had worn away their friendship in ways he’d never suspected until too late. The worst part was remembering how he’d reveled in their back-and-forth at the time, flinging remarks designed to provoke, enjoying Steve’s exasperated tolerance, mistaking the super-soldier’s criticism for honesty, his irritation for intimacy, long before the Accords proved how badly Tony had misjudged. At least just now, Tony had noticed when he’d crossed the line. Maybe that could count as progress.
Steve exhaled, feeling as though he’d been holding his breath for centuries. He slumped back into the couch, relief spreading release throughout his body, tilting his head towards the warmth of the afternoon sun.
Then Tony took a deep breath and sat up in one surge. His skull tried to convince him it was now just aching shards of bone sliding over a brain of pulverized jelly, but after careful exploration with his hands, he concluded this was a hyperbolic sensation and could be safely ignored.
“Okay, enough,” Steve said under his breath, then pushed his chair back and stood up tall in full command mode. And as usual, that was all it took for everyone in the room to turn and give him their full attention. Tony liked to call this effect the ‘Cap-signal’. But Steve was talking with his earnest face on, which meant Tony should be listening. “…I know we’re all working as hard as we can, and I know this is the most important job we’ve ever done, but running ourselves into exhaustion isn’t gonna do anybody any good. So I’m officially putting a pause on the preparations. If that means we have to hit Titan a day later, then so be it. From this moment, you have twenty-four hours. Take the time to rest, relax if you need to. Do whatever it takes to get your mind right. Maybe try to remind yourself what it is we’re fighting for. But no work. Not today.”
“Whuh,” said Tony, famed speaker of words. Surely that shouldn’t sound like it sounded. But instead of rephrasing, the former assassin folded his arms and let the question hang, only raising an eyebrow when Tony continued to be speechless.
And just that, just the soft sigh of Steve saying his name, was enough to stop the stars. He pressed their intertwined fingers to his lips, needing to mark the moment. “I promise,” he said. “Whatever comes. We do this together.”
The light disappears from his eyes, and with it goes all sense of the battlefield, their desperate victory. Steve is cold and sinking again, trapped in a world that no longer allows his body to breathe. He watches Pepper sob and feels no distance between his pain and her own. There is nothing else left.
had left Steve shuddering. Luckily he wasn’t the only one; in the end everyone had agreed that it was better to let go. Better to forget.
Tony took a breath, glanced back at Steve, refocused on Thanos. “But you know what? Fuck you, pal. People will find a way to survive. That’s what we do. We survive and rebuild and maybe we only get through by adding some shiny new traumatic chapters to the history books but hey, guess what? So long as there’s people, you can’t stop us living, can’t stop us loving each other and going forth and multiplying and that means at some point generations from now we’ll be facing the exact same problem, same as if you did nothing. What you did wasn’t just cruel, wasn’t just evil; it was
, Rogers, don’t pretend otherwise. And I gotta say, you’ve got it down to a tee. Playing the perfect noble leader in public so I’m just some fuck-up in comparison. Poisoning everyone against me behind my back, so now whenever I walk into a room, half the team walk out. Well, fine. What-the-fuck-ever. You want the Avengers? Let’s make it official. They’re all yours. Fuck every last one of you, I’m done.”
Across a wide world, planes seek guidance; missiles seek targets; the people need help. Bring in FRIDAY, the Captain orders. The AI is already busy, has already averted the worst she could reach. Together, the team makes a pattern. Find problem; ease problem. The Captain speaks. Dozens, hundreds, thousands.
Nebula was not alone. Schmidt was behind her, hanging back to watch. He came forward now, floating above the water, the reflected stars barely rippling at his eerie passage.
“Don’t,” Tony whispered; his anger cracked away to show such sadness underneath, such hurt, that it took every scrap of willpower Steve possessed to keep from sitting up and going to him. Instead he could only watch as Tony dropped heavily into his chair, scrubbing at his face. “Please don’t lie to me.”
A gnawing ache woke him from the deepest sleep he could remember in years. The hunger was back.  Tony opened his eyes to the morning light, blinked once, twice at what he saw. Steve.
“For a minute there, I was,” Steve said, and his expression was the opposite of fireworks, misery sinking into itself. “I thought maybe, if you were single, if I came back… there might be a chance.”
Steve ignored the tiny jolt of disappointment and flashed a serene and totally non-wicked smile. “Don’t tell Bruce.” It was really such an inappropriate thing to say, but it sent the billionaire off into gales of laughter, enough to set Steve genuinely grinning in turn. Across the lab, Rocket and Thor looked over but turned away again, muttering to each other. Whatever they were working on, the symbols were in some alien script that to Steve’s unfamiliar eye looked like garlands of flowers drawn in ink. They were the only other people around; Bruce must be sleeping.
Luckily, just then May Parker entered the waiting room, her dark eyes lighting up with amusement when she saw everyone tangled across the couches.  She nodded to Steve as she approached, then gave Tony a quick wink before crouching down to study her snoring kid. “I talked to Happy, he’s sending a car to bring us home,” she said, then smoothed some stray hair back from Peter’s face. “Damn, he’s totally zonked. I hate waking him.”
“The universe can suck it,” Tony said curtly. “My priority is you.” He swallowed, weirdly nervous. “It’s always gonna be you, Steve. So. Get used to it.”
She smiles without answering. They wait and watch on the rooftop until the battle reaches its end, until somewhere Loki is escaping with the Tesseract and Bruce finally leaves with the Time Stone and the scepter. Steve opens the suitcase and offers her the green gem. The Ancient One squeezes his hand before taking it.
Two ships, Stark relayed, instantly reverting to his professional cool. One heading for Wakanda, the other about to rock up at the Sanctum’s door.
clear,” the super-soldier whispered. “You and I both know you are a sniveling coward who will say anything to save his own neck, but eventually, you will find yourself thinking back on this moment as if it’s in the past, and you may start to think of revenge.”
The Soul Stone tilted her head to one side and pointed to Tony. “Actually, he saved you. Once there were two souls in play, I had enough leverage to protect you both. But without his actions, I could not have intervened.”
Shuri swept in accompanied by Peter - uh oh - who was carrying a tray of food. The no-longer-Queen commanded him to eat every bite to prove his recovery before dragging Peter out of the room again, although the kid didn’t exactly protest. Those two were going to be
Yet enduring the cameras was the last hurdle on the schedule before the official launch could begin, and so Tony tried to keep his expression loose and comfortable as T’Challa finished up listing the Wakandan influences on the space network’s design. Again. Over the past year, Tony had seen the King handle constant petty disbelief about the true extent of Wakanda’s technological contributions. Such disrespect should have been a headline-grabbing outrage, but sadly, this was America.
,” and for some reason Tony was weeping, saying that he was sorry, that he didn’t know, over and over. Steve didn’t really understand what was happening but Tony was upset so he tried to fix it, rattling off the active names for back home - Hawaii, Guatemala - but that just made Tony sob harder.
Steve found himself deeply irritated by the assumption. Rhodey had been on the team for years now, and although they were never close, Steve considered him a friend. Sure, they’d clashed over the Accords, but Steve wasn’t a monster. Tony should have realized he would have asked about Rhodey’s injuries if he’d known.
They sat until it was fully dark, then made their way back down to the speeder by the light of Tony’s wrist device; back at the palace, they joined the rest of the team for a large dinner, and everyone slept well that night.
Cap knew. Which meant it would be just a matter of time for Fury to recognize how unreliable Tony was and kick him off the team. Tony clenched his fists around the leather of Captain America’s cowl. It had some dried blood on the inside, where it had pressed against Tony’s forehead. The infinitely skilled attendant on his jet had cleaned up his wound. “You might need stitches, Mr. Stark, I’ll get you water instead of the usual.” Tony liked her a bit less, then, but put his head in his hands.
He was so fucking stupid. He should not have erupted at Steve like he had. Steve could already be on the phone to Fury about how Tony was unfit for duty as an avenger, or in violation of the confidentiality clause of his contract, or, or—
“Yeah…” Tony sighed, “I have you for a bit longer, don’t I? Maybe you can give me the most wonderful of kindnesses and choke me on that cock of yours, put my voice out of commission for the day. Hell, for the week.” Before Steve could make a quip about keeping Tony tied to his bed for the week, he reminded himself of what he had to do. And before he could bite the bullet, he caught Tony’s soft eyes gazing up at him. “I,” Tony paused, “I had breakfast yesterday, and skipped my coffee.” Steve felt a rush of emotion flooding his brain, wrapping around his heart and squeezing. “Good boy,” he whispered, giving Tony’s hips a squeeze with the leg hooked over them.
“Boss, you have eighty-seven missed calls-” Friday began; with a dull shiver, Tony muted her, then slid down the wall to wait out the dizziness. His thoughts were getting fuzzy again, the first promise of a headache gathering behind his eyeballs, but he couldn’t rest when he still had a job to do. He could see into Steve’s room from here, well enough to see the man was still unconscious; Tony
His mood plummeted further when the Starkphone in his hand began to ring directly, sending his heart rate racing in horrified reaction.
But the super-soldier swore he needed the help, every time, and by now Tony had gotten in the habit of providing it. And he liked the simplicity, he supposed. With the last container filled, Steve shot Tony a smug grin before hoisting a second one onto his other shoulder and setting off towards the camp.
Steve’s mistrust of the Accords rose up within him, deep as ever, but this time his resistance crumbled under the weight of Tony’s gaze. Defeated, he nodded, and Tony’s eyes widened slightly.
Two weeks later, he is saying goodbye by the lake, and he is still cold, still sinking. Sam is cheerful but Bucky’s eyes are soft in the morning light. He knows. Of course he knows. But Steve Rogers has one last mission to do, and that is how he steps up to the platform and leaves this cold, empty future behind.
For half a breath, Steve’s feet refused to move. Then he was following Tony out of the room, was calling Tony’s name, was catching Tony’s arm to stop him stumbling into the walls, because that wasn’t laughing. Tony wasn’t laughing.
“He wasn’t supposed to be there today,” Tony told her, his throat tightening. “It’s my fault, May. I’d warned him something big was coming. I wanted him to stay safe. He swore to me he wouldn’t get involved. He
He opens his eyes, stares down at the flowers. “That’s the one part that still gets me now,” he confesses. “I know things may never have worked out between us. By the end, there was too much hurt for it to matter, I think. But I wish I’d had the guts to tell him anyway. He deserved to know.”
Eventually he must have succumbed, because the next time Steve opened his eyes, Tony was slumped in the chair, phone nowhere to be seen. Awake, but… still. That was wrong. Tony was never still. He was… freedom and sunshine and fire.
Steve looked shyly pleased. “Yeah, Nat came up with it as a fallback, just in case Friday couldn’t find all the copies. Honestly I didn’t think I could pull it off until I saw…” He trailed off, suddenly uncomfortable.
- but eventually he remembered to check their location on his wrist device. Navigating was so much easier from a hundred feet up. Once they were heading in the right direction, the two men were free to chat and wander slowly through the gentle meadows towards the hills beyond. Soon enough, the ground began to rise steeply and their steps fell into an easy quiet rhythm.
Eventually, Bruce and Okoye moved away to light the evening fire, and Shuri followed Tony’s gaze to where Steve and his muscles were still -
It all escapes him then. Her death. Hulk’s Snap. Younger Thanos, their victory. The cost. She listens. Clint listens. Even Schmidt listens, floating nearby, like a nightmare. Steve breaks down for the first time since… and Nat holds him close. She’d always known.
Right now, the super-soldier was sitting across the room with Rocket, Bruce and Thor, listening to the forced cheer of their conversation without contributing; Tony was sitting with Nat, Barton and Rhodey, doing most of the babbling. Rhodey had his arm slung around the back of Tony’s chair, clearly still stuck on his plan for protection detail. He’d loudly punched a wall after hearing Nebula’s blunt report and had refused to leave Tony’s side since, even following him to the bathroom; admittedly, Tony had been glad for Rhodey’s company last night. Otherwise he’d have gone looking for Steve and probably said something stupid and fucked everything up even worse.
“Sweetheart, I promise the next dozen times we do this we will go as slow as you want but right now I’m kinda losing my mind so I’m gonna need you to fuck my ass like you need it to breathe.” He was babbling nonsense and he was being greedy and for one long unbearable moment, Steve just stared at him, wild-eyed. Then he settled one soft kiss on the corner of Tony’s mouth before he drew back, lips curved, eyes afire, and Tony nearly whined out loud because
Steve’s heightened awareness caught Tony’s flinch, but the billionaire pushed forward regardless. Always brave. “Sure is.”
The post-battle crash was hitting the team harder than Steve had ever seen. He supposed that was to be expected, given everything.
“Sorry,” Steve said, not at all sorry as his merriment eased into a contented smile. He was lying with his eyes closed, the afternoon sun kissing golden highlights into his hair, and Tony kinda wished he had a camera - uh, camera, picture, wait, yes-
Steve avoided meeting his eyes, fingers still following the lines of Tony’s scars. “I was just wondering… whether it’s weird that I know what most of these are from.”
“More like childhood sweethearts,” Tiberius said with a great booming laugh. His grip on Tony’s shoulders tightened, squeezing him closer. “Sadly, my family moved to Europe and we fell out of touch. Then a couple years ago, I walk into a bar in Hawaii and there’s my Anthony, gazing up at me like no time had passed. We’ve been inseparable ever since.” Recognizing the cue, Tony glanced up through his eyelashes and smiled shyly. Tiberius smirked back and touched his cheek, just the correct amount of tenderness in his gaze.
The toll of protesting sent Steve sinking back into his pillows, trying to resist the sudden bone-weary urge to go back to sleep. Physically, he felt exhausted, but for the first time since the surgery, his mind felt clear, its usual sharpness emerging from under a thinning layer of residual fogginess, and he’d slept through far too much already.
- Tony could pinpoint the exact moment when the super-soldier understood, could only watch as Steve Rogers’ heart broke. “
And Steve was infinite again, blasted open but this time there was no pain, only a rising hum of joy that spun into patterns he recognized, patterns he knew. His memories. They were reading his memories; Steve was a child, sick, angry; his mother turned to him with love in her eyes, smiled before kissing his forehead - universes blossomed at her touch, and he was a thousand comforted children, a million. Steve was young, sick, furious; Erskine giving him a chance, one last hope - he lived millions of young chances, found millions of last hopes. Steve was ready, strong, eager; Erskine nodding, the one proud moment they’d shared before their story was ended - billions of stories raced through him, each a tapestry woven through with countless moments of pride, hope, love; Steve watched as each life connected in a vast web that spanned planets, then galaxies, universes.
Since that day, Tony had replayed the video a thousand times in his head, but to no avail. Ty had included every possible detail of Steve’s appearance, right down to the parole device the double wore on his left ankle; Ty knew Steve would be whisked off to the Raft the second he was accused of putting a toe over the line. In turn, Tony knew Ross would pounce on the opportunity to acquire more of the serum, probably over Steve’s dead body.
The two aliens referred to themselves as the Children of Thanos. Apparently aliens could learn magic too, he discovered. Steve also learned that New Yorkers were great at responding to invasion alerts, their steady evacuation further supporting the theory that public alerts would help minimize civilian casualties. The property damage, unfortunately, couldn’t be helped. Things improved rapidly once Spider-Man showed up, which was embarrassing as both an adult and a soldier. Stark’s new nano-suit performed magnificently. Steve got thrown into a duck pond. While he was distracted, Wong saved Stark’s life, and got invited to his wedding.
Tony took another bite out of his sandwich. “Where do you want my hands, specifically?” He brought his hand up from Tony’s shoulder, along his neck and grazing upwards into Tony’s hair. Tony hummed. “In your hair? Do you want me to pull it?”
Steve took a deep breath before kneeling by Iron Man. The helmet was dented, sparking erratically. Steve suspected it might be jammed shut. The breathing systems may be damaged as well. He brought his hands up to grip the panels by the edges of the helmet, tugging. There was resistance, but, with his full force, Steve was able to peel up the face plate to reveal the blood-covered face of his teammate, which he had never seen before.
. He wondered if Tony would enjoy his humour. Or, Steve thought with a tiny shameful thrill, Tony would take it to heart and follow his instruction. His order? No… That was not something Steve should even consider. Tony and he were… an arrangement. A paid arrangement. Steve provided a service.
Tony flinched when JARVIS suddenly spoke. “The Avengers have returned to the tower, Sir.” Tony dropped his hand, mood ruined. He groaned unhappily as he glanced over towards his bedroom door, open to the rest of his living space.
. Intricate ropes wrapped thickly, carefully, over Tony’s wrists, his ankles, fastening them to his thighs. Keeping him stuck but not motionless; just wriggling and squirming while Steve did what he liked—what Tony liked.
Tony dropped himself onto his lush sheets, turning his head to press his nose to the pillow that Steve had used last night. He had hoped some of Steve’s scent might have lingered, but Steve had used Tony’s bath products and so his scent was overpowered by artificial aromas.
Tony walked up to Steve’s bed and placed something onto the end of the mattress. He could not see what it was from that angle. Tony kept fiddling with it.
Tony’s hole was bare, clean, and soft. Tony hoped his efforts had tempted Steve to do all sorts of things to it tonight, but it seemed that Steve had priorities. Steve pressed his tongue flat across Tony’s hole, swiping at the sensitive pucker. Tony’s shocked whimper was perfect.
Pepper approached the desk and Tony actively avoided looking down at her heels. He was a brave, confident business leader and he could look his CEO in the eye while she completely obliterated him with her astute perceptiveness.
Steve felt heat stir in his gut at the sight of Tony leaning his stinging cheek into his hand, against the tug of Steve’s fingers in his hair. He could do whatever he wanted to this man and that potential was intoxicating. “On your feet,” Steve ordered and withdrew both his hands.
Tony slid to his knees onto the kitchen tile, a blush growing on his cheeks as he avoided Steve’s gaze. He had an urge to nuzzle Steve’s thigh, but he had a task.
“Y’like that?” Steve growled, running one hand along Tony’s thigh, his ass, scritching and soothing in a hazy pattern.
At that, Tony moaned around his fingers, increasing his efforts and meeting Steve’s thrusts, pursing his lips over his teeth and sticking out his tongue along the length of Steve’s fingers as far as it could reach.
come on my face.” His cheeks were hot, red, Tony could feel sweat beading at his temples, on his neck.
After a minute or so, Tony’s hands settled, and he was still. Then, he turned and exited the room. It was only until after Steve heard the elevator doors open and close did Steve dare leave his position in the closet.
Ah, Steve thought, a childish drunk then. Steve could work with that. He chose not to take that tasty bait. Instead, he offered Tony food. “My guess is you didn’t eat a single thing while you were having a party for one upstairs, hm?”
A gasp escaped Tony’s lips before he could stop it. Steve’s teeth took a bite at the plump flesh of Tony’s left asscheek before his tongue laved at the captured skin and he sucked gently.
Steve was surprised at how responsive Tony was to his words. He came with a shout and his raised arms shook before dropping down to the mattress. Steve removed his fingers and delicately stroked Tony through his orgasm, as white spurts shot over Tony’s expensive shirt. Steve crawled forward to lie by Tony’s side. “That was so good.” Steve whispered. He didn’t think before he brought one slick hand to stroke Tony’s hair, but Tony did not seem to mind, as he hummed blissfully under Steve’s touch.
Tony smiled. He seemed to be delighted about Steve’s curiosity, and insisted on providing Steve a tour of his penthouse to see the rest of the art hanging on the walls. They were beautiful. Steve rarely had the opportunity to admire art when he was young. He spent most of his childhood in bed, entertaining himself with crayons and drawing portraits of Bucky when he came over to visit when Steve had been too sick to come out.
“He seemed like a nice man!” Steve felt himself blush as he thought of where he should begin to recount the events of the night before. “Tony…
“You are in luck, good sir! A Corona, it is.” Tony placed the cold glass bottle in front of Steve before mixing himself a martini. As he worked on his drink, Steve took only one sip of his own. Tony actively did not gawk when he realized Steve popped open the metal cap with his bare hands, and that... was unfairly sexy.
Steve sat behind Tony in the tub, grabbed a washcloth and a fragrant body wash and started washing Tony. He started at his shoulders, down his back, his arms. He gently wiped Tony’s face with the soft warm cloth, then placed the cloth into Tony’s left hand. “Wash your chest for me, baby. I don’t want to hurt you.”
Tony rolled his eyes, handing over the small cardboard box. “Of course you want the wings, birdbrain.”
.” Iron Man aimed his free gauntlet down to the forest, shooting a repulsor blast to the direction of the source of the gunfire.
“I was wondering if you were… I was thinking, do you ever dom off the agency’s time?” Tony winced internally. Stupid, stupid, you sound like a prick, he scolded himself.
Steve stood and went to retrieve a takeout container from the refrigerator. “I did, Tony. You’re a very good host. Pilaf okay?”
Steve started out on a steady rhythm, eyes roaming over what he could see of Tony’s face, and down his clothed body. He eyed Tony’s hands carefully as they began to twitch and wander again. This time, they began to edge closer to Tony’s crotch.
Steve had been instructed to kneel on a cushion by the client’s feet in the lush living room of his large home. The television played some drama program that Steve was, of course, unfamiliar with. Steve had his head bowed, giving access to the man’s hand to pet and scritch through Steve’s hair quietly. The ropes laying across Steve’s nipples were the focus of Steve’s attention; any shift would send sparks of sharp sensation and pleasure from his nipples and trigger fireworks in Steve’s brain.
Back at the Tower, Tony stepped into his shower with a sigh of relief. Hot water stung on his scalp, but he stood there until the pink water running down his skin turned clear. When he emerged and approached the mirrored wall, Tony froze.
Tony closed his eyes, stayed still. “No, no, you should stay. You were here first,” he started, but then his head shot up and he glared at Steve. “Well, I was here before all of you, technically.”
Tony nodded vacantly to Pepper’s voice, the words on the page blurring, and his mind flitting away, back to that morning. He fought the grinding urge to hide his head into his hands in front of Pepper; she already read him like a book, she did not need any hints about his latest personal catastrophe.
,” and gave his throat the most restrained squeeze he could. Tony wailed, clenching around Steve’s dick, hands clutching his own knees to his chest, and his cock spurted untouched across his belly.
Tony let out a choked whimper, looking away again. Steve felt an ember spark inside of him, wanting so much to
Steve stepped out of the elevator and reached out his hand for Stark. Well, Tony. “You have a beautiful home.” His mother always told him it was best to open a visit with a positive remark. “My name is Steve.”
Steve ingeniously asked Tony about a painting hung above the fireplace in the den and Tony offered to give Steve a tour of the penthouse. Tony had idly collected art over the years from charity auctions and various gifts from businesspeople he’d met with. Steve showed more interest in the paintings decorating Tony’s walls than most guests did, so Tony found himself just following Steve as Steve’s eyes followed the paint strokes and light of the scenes before finding the next piece in Tony’s collection.
“Have you eaten yet today? You said you have some food in the kitchen, right?” Tony nodded, his forehead rubbing against Steve’s firm shoulder. “When did you eat?”
“Audio call, I suspect, Sir?” JARVIS was too sassy for his own good. Tony rolled his eyes as he gargled some mouthwash and provided a visual confirmation (
Steve scanned Tony’s face, his squirming body. “You want me to fuck you, Tony? How do you want it, baby?” Tony’s eyes drifted closed again, but he seemed to catch himself and open them again, staring up at Steve. “Rough, on your elbows and knees? Want me to bend you over and take you and leave bite marks across your shoulders, bruises on your hips?” Steve grinded his hips down against Tony again, swallowing up Tony’s moan with a kiss. This time, he put everything he had into the kiss. It was aggressive and fed by the desperation of both men. Steve luxuriated in sucking and biting on Tony’s bottom lip for a long while before speaking again. Steve couldn’t stop himself from grinning at how Tony’s blush spread down his cheeks onto his neck and by his collar bones. His eyes were getting hazy, soft. Steve recognized it, he had read a
He took another sip and tisked when his glass was empty. He stood to make another. He wanted to make two for the sake of efficiency but there was that razor-thin line between efficiency and alcoholism and Tony wanted to avoid that train of thought. He sat down again on his couch and looked down at the spot where Steve had coddled him the past two nights.
“Tell me,” Steve began, coaxing Tony to speak. He began to gently stroke Tony’s thigh, gradually sliding closer and closer to Tony’s groin over his soft suit pants. “Tell me what you want me to do with you.” Steve’s grip squeezed over the lean muscle of his inner thigh.
“That’s it,” Steve purred when Tony’s fingers reached the smooth expanse of his chest, his pecs. “Just like I taught you.”
Steve pinched the shell of Tony’s ear with his teeth, a teasing tug before releasing and lifting his body from Tony’s back. Tony moaned, in both pleasure and displeasure—he adored the weight of Steve’s body and the not-so-subtle erection that was returning to full hardness again inside Tony’s ass until Steve was selfish enough to pull out.
. I just want to do as much as I can.” Steve started scrolling through more of the information the service sent. He wanted to ask Natasha any questions he might have.
“That feel good, baby? You want it?” Steve’s voice was low, weighing Tony down to the present. He nodded quickly. “Did I fuck the words out of your head? Where are your manners, sweetheart?”
Then, absolutely unforeseeably, they were chest to chest, Tony’s hands on Steve’s hips, looking at each other with lusting eyes and pink cheeks. Steve could pull him in for a kiss, suck his neck, bite his shoulders, mark Tony up. Mark Tony as
“Tony, it’s okay.” Steve cooed, bending down to press his forehead against Tony’s. Suddenly, this all felt too intimate. Tony had to close his eyes again.
“Tell me, sweetheart, tell me what you want me to do to you.” Steve was surprised at himself at how easily the words fell from his mouth. Tony had his eyes closed, breathing deeply. “Look at me.” Steve said, wanting to see those blown pupils again. God, they were gorgeous.
“You’re such a good boy, Tony. Raised well to say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, weren’t we?” Steve continued to stroke Tony’s cock with his right hand while his left index gently pushed into Tony’s hole. Tony nodded steadily, agreeing with whatever it was that got Steve’s thick fingers inside him.
Steve then pulled back slightly to return with a shallow thrust into Tony’s throat, before pulling back out until only the head rested in Tony’s mouth. Tony did not seem able to resist swiping his tongue across it for a taste.
Tony started stroking himself eagerly then, remembering the look in Steve’s eyes when he was inside Tony, when he was holding him down, and when he was bathing him.
“Well, that’s hardly the point. I want to learn.” Steve huffed as he searched for the term in his video files. After a few moments of tapping, he found a short video, watched the first 13 seconds, and immediately closed it. “Oh.”
want that to happen. His left hand shot out and tugged Tony’s wrist away just as Tony’s fingers had been dipped below the waist of his suit pants.
A client has requested to have a repeat experience with you. That’s fantastic! Please read over the new details they have requested for the new appointment.
Tony was practically vibrating with anxiety as the time ticked closer to 9:00pm. The past day was nearly impossible to get through, as his mind kept wandering to imagine Steve’s hands exploring and groping his body. He had freshly showered and cleaned out, intent on tonight going much farther than their first appointment. Steve had rejected most of the food Tony had offered last time, but Tony still had arranged for a small spread of options for them and made sure there would be beer for Steve.
The tiles were cold on the palms of Tony’s hands, but at least his suit shielded his knees enough. Tony was still thankful that the distance from the kitchen to the bedroom was short. Steve walked in stride by Tony as he crawled, watching Steve’s feet.
Steve let out a laugh and rubbed his brow. “You know what? Sure. I’ll have time to read about subspace and nipple play
Steve was still laid out on the bed, arms stretched with his hands folded under his head, eyes closed.
Tony took a deep breath and held it for much longer than necessary. The hand on his neck gripped firmly, fingers sliding closer together, gathering tension before releasing suddenly. Tony exhaled heavily and sagged against Steve’s shoulder.
“Do you even know what you’re begging for?” Steve was surprised at how soft his own voice had turned. He nearly thought he had just broken the Captain America spell when Tony’s cheeks grew pink and he stammered, “N- I... Whatever you think I deserve.”
Tony groaned, squeezing his grip around his cock for a moment, before remembering his characteristic defiance and continuing to jerk himself off. “How’re y’gonna stop me?”
Steve had hoped that a more amicable relationship could be struck up now that the team had been relocated to Stark (Avengers) tower, but his efforts were fruitless as Stark was still unauthorized to know Captain America’s identity. It would certainly be cumbersome to walk around in his cowl in case Stark happened to come down to the communal Avengers floor; however, Natasha had said that Stark had never come to the communal floor during the day. Steve simply took to leaving take-out leftovers in the fridge with notes marking them as Tony’s. Clint had told Steve (once, in passing) that sometimes Stark would come down to scavenge from the fridge, so Steve figured they would not go to waste. Steve had also figured that, without the notes, anyone (
Tony complied, carefully unfolding himself and coming to full height, his nose level with Steve’s lips. Steve found himself tempted to plant a kiss, but refrained. Instead, he grabbed Tony by the shoulders, pushing and pulling to have him turn in his place. As Tony slowly shuffled and spun, already seemed to be slipping down into the soft space he looked so beautiful in, Steve looked his fill. The bite marks on Tony’s shoulders had disappeared since the previous night but the front of his neck was bluish-purple from the tug of Tony’s collar.
The third client Steve had accepted had been matched with Steve due to his strength. The man had a kink for large-muscled men to hold him down. Just that. Press him into the mattress, grind him into the lush carpet, preferably while disparaged with humiliating lines predetermined by him, until he wept with frustration. Steve had wondered if the man would ejaculate from the experience, but he fucked the man afterwards in the master bedroom.
He was rewarded with fingernails dragging up his back, his shoulders, then one hand tugging on the hair on the top of his head. Tony’s head was pulled up, back, throat stretched, exposed as he was pulled backward up to his knees. Steve’s chest was warm and fantastic against Tony’s back.
Tony. Tony was stepping out of the elevator. Tony, was stepping out of the elevator, onto the communal floor, where Steve had just been left alone by
“Y’know what I mean. You kept coming… Did you— oh, I wasn’t the only one was I?” Tony suddenly felt sick, felt like he was thrown out of his own body and forced to watch as he made a fool out of himself in front of Captain America, Mr Perfect, Captain Sculpted Ass. Of course Tony wasn’t the only one Steve was meeting with. Steve was… Steve. He was smart and gorgeous and he somehow knew his way around Tony’s kinks like he had crawled up into his brain to take notes. Tony wasn’t special, he never was.
Tony turned back to her with sudden laser focus, brilliant mind hungry as ever. “Right, but first, where are we? What
“So what, throwing yourself into an alien river unsupervised was the only possible option?” Tony asked, tone biting.
Ty sneered, his usual cold smirk slipping back in place. “Anthony needed to be taught a lesson,” he said. “Would you like to see our lessons, Captain?”
That’s why Steve is there in the Tower when there’s a report of an accident on the news. That’s how he is there to catch Tony after he answers his phone. And he’s there when Tony identifies her body, right by Tony’s side.
On autopilot, he eventually found his feet had led him to a particular door; he knocked, his mind loosely figuring it was as good a place as any to find himself a Steve.
“I just shouldn’t have- sorry.” He couldn’t seem to stop. “I’m sorry,” he repeated, again and again, and once more when the two nurses entered. They hastily injected Steve with something, and the rampaging pain diffused into a cloud of green sparks that floated away into an endless sky above him. There they are, Steve thought, pleased. His stars. They were cool and serene, strong and steady.
to be it. He’d been scared, and confused, and got caught up in an old memory. Steve could explain everything now. And if he could explain, Tony might understand.
However that brutal truth made him feel, it was better that he knew. Easier. Uncomplicated. And for two years, he’d poured his full attention into moving on. Had tried to be more responsible, towards his former team, towards the world. With his international fleet of legal teams, he had modified the worst of the Accords, shaping them towards a far more practical, efficient design. He’d reported to Ross, been civil to his face, mentored the kid behind the politician’s back. Breaking the rules, yeah, but
Whatever the other man heard in his voice, he instantly relaxed; next, his gaze searched Tony’s face, back and forth, up and down; what he found there Tony did not know, but by the time their eyes finally met, Steve’s expression had become soft, radiant. Beautiful. Without dropping his gaze, Steve raised their linked hands and pressed his lips to Tony’s knuckles, the only prayer Tony would ever need.
Ignoring Steve and the assassins’ quizzical gaze, Tony pulled out his phone, quick fingers popping the case. “Great job, Fri,” he said. “Now get your ass clear.” Tony connected the hidden component and turned the phone back over, waiting for Friday’s confirmation she’d removed all traces of herself from the building’s network. Only then did he enter the command.
Their mission was to destroy all copies of the footage; only then could Tony end the relationship without repercussions. Stone kept his most valuable files on private servers locked in the basement of his mansion. This archive was the target of the primary team, but the media tycoon was both shrewd and resourceful. They had to assume there were further backups off-site. If they could get Friday in, the AI would hopefully identify the location of any backup servers; the secondary team would then head out and eliminate them. In the meantime, once Friday analyzed the original footage, she should be able to track and delete any copies off any online device, thus preventing Stone from retaliating.
The air surged back into his lungs in a painful rush, and Tony rolled over, coughing. By the time the dizziness let him stand, Thanos had been hammered into retreat by the glowing woman’s fists, cheered on by a visibly uninjured Peter. Tony watched the alien make his escape through a portal, leaving the shattered street silent and empty.
Tony blinked, a fresh wave of disappointment turning his stomach. He had flung himself first off a cliff and then face-first onto Steve’s face; if anything, the super-soldier was
“Leadership can certainly lead to isolation,” Thor said; the king sounded uncharacteristically subdued. “Yet the more responsibility one accepts, the more necessary it becomes to have trusted companions who will see the person and not the power.”
,” he whispered, “was the hottest fucking blowjob in the entire history of the universe.” Steve gave him a proud sloppy grin in response.
“Captain Rogers was invaluable in those first days,” Shuri said, walking towards them. “It was chaos out there; nobody understood what had happened. FRIDAY and I could access any system on the planet, but Rogers was a familiar face, one many people still trusted. He calmed them down, got them focused on relief efforts, emergency plans, supply lines. His actions saved thousands if not millions of lives. But it meant he went days without sleep. His body is strong, but not invincible. The stress caught up to him, so he’s resting now.”
A flicker of concern crossed Tony’s face, a momentary beacon of warmth beyond the blankness. Almost like Tony remembered being his friend. Almost like Tony cared.
Getting sassed by a rodent would have been one of the top things Steve missed about this future, if he could miss anything about this future. As it turned out, time travel via Infinity Stone was nothing like the movies, with their alternate timelines and, uh, something about a cartoon man and donuts? Tony had tried to explain it once. Basically a wormhole or quantum machine could theoretically create a tunnel back to the past and let someone travel through, but the future they left would continue to exist independently, even if the traveller’s individual experience branched off into an alternative future.
“What?” Clint asked once Peter started making a bunch of different little-annoyed voices. He held the four-month-old against his hip and started walking towards the changing table. He wondered if Peter needed a diaper change, but he didn’t smell anything and assumed he was saved from diaper duty. “What do you wan- oh,”
He honestly wanted to laugh when he watched, in synchronization, as the smug smiles dropped off of every single persons face. The Captain cleared his throat. “Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you there, Barbie. We need it.”
The past week Steve, Tony, and the rest of Avengers have been busy working on Project: Baby. Bruce and Bucky were in charge with Baby Proofing the tower. Sam and Thor were in charge of buying Peter clothes. Rhodey and Natasha were in charge of buying little games toys and decorating Peter’s room, even if he wouldn’t be using it for a while. Clint and Pepper were in charge of helping Tony and Steve with the most important things that they needed such as a crib, changing table, bottle station, etc. They were also in charge with helping calm down the nervous husbands. Clint already had children and understood what physiological worries the pair was going through. Pepper was also helping with overseeing everyone else. She made sure that Bruce and Bucky baby proofed everything, she made sure that the outfits purchased by Sam and Thor were varied for different types of weather, and she made sure that the toys, stuffed animals, and decorations Rhodey and Nat picked out were appropriate for a two-month-old. And since Happy is head of security, Tony and Steve had him increase the amount of security in and around Stark Tower.
It took two weeks, four days, three hours, and twenty-seven minutes, but Tony finally got to see his son crawl.
Neither said anything for a few tense minutes. Tony trying to find out if he was going to get murdered or not and ‘Clyde’ coming to the realization that he just got dumped. Tony’s sniffling seemed to bring the blonde back to the moment. “Why are you crying? I’m the one who just got dumped.”
And Tony supposed that that was for the best. There was no point in conversing one last time with these mysterious strangers who have become a larger part of his life. There was no point, and there was no trust. The closest he’s ever been to hearing any of their real names was when the Hulk got drunk and began to call Hawkeye ‘Cl-’ before a hand was slapped over his mouth.
“Good night, small Midgardian,” Thor whispered as Peter’s small eyes closed, and he drifted off into unconsciousness.
“I missed it?” Steve must have been too excited to hear the sudden melancholy that had seeped into his voice.
“It was good,” Tony said. “Is… is everyone sleeping?” Laying scattered across the room, the Avengers were all fast asleep and dead to the world.
Tony got out from under his covers, wrapping several different blankets over his form while he trudged to the other side of the room. “Well that’s a loaded question,” he muttered.
Even after months and months have passed, Tony hasn’t gone more than three nights in a row without reliving those events in his sleep. No matter how hard he tries, Steve Rogers won’t leave him alone.
Tony stuck his tongue out at her before turning to page six of the Daily Bugle. He scanned the page, looking for what Natasha wanted him to see. Once he found it, Tony's roaring laugh filled the air.
"Sorry Stud, not tonight," Tony said simply, walking away from the table and out of the restaurant. After a moment, he felt the Captain's presence behind his and when he reached the car he barely had time to turn around before the Captain was on him. He forced the car door open and Tony fell backward onto the seat as the Captain climbed over his body, already mauling him with his lips.
“Me too.” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist and smiled as he gave his husband a quick peck on the lips, “But I can’t believe you freaked out so much.”
“Huh,” Tony’s brow furrowed, “that’s a lot of blood for only one bullet.” Tony knows how to shoot a gun. After all, he owned a weapons company. If he didn’t even know how to fire a gun, then he was in the wrong line of business. But even he didn’t think that his one quick shot to the chest would perfectly pierce the man's heart. Maybe he was just better than he liked to give himself credit for. Howard always told him on their quarterly trips to the shooting range that he could do better. “I thought for sure I’d need at least two.”
“About two weeks.” She said, “His parents had an emergency and needed to leave the country for a few days. They left Peter with some friends. After a week, they called the police when they couldn’t get in touch with his parents. Apparently, his parents were in a private plane and it crashed somewhere in the middle of the ocean. The people that Peter was staying with wanted to adopt him, but they weren’t financially stable, so they were unable to.”
Peter rocked his head back and forth and he chewed and swallowed. Once he was done he quickly said, “I wanna tell Gwen I like her.”
He pictures Steve’s smile. The way his lips curve around his perfectly shaped white teeth. The way it would always grow whenever he saw Tony.
“I’m so proud of him, Tony,” Steve’s voice was filled with so much unadulterated pride as he continued to say some more things to Peter. Tony tore his gaze to the baby monitor on his desk where he could Steve balancing his cell phone in between his shoulders while he gently bounced Peter on his leg. Peter smiled largely and suddenly his adorable little laugh flooded through the phone.
Tony had surprised Steve with a weekend getaway to Iceland. When they checked into there hotel and opened the door to there room, they found two life-size cardboard cutouts of themselves. One was of the Iron man suit with its palm up, pointed towards you and the other was of Captain America. The Captain was covered head-to-toe in his 1940s uniform, and Cap looked as though he was about to throw his shield at the enemy. Steve and Tony thought it was hilarious so they asked the bellhop to take a picture for them. The two decided to pose in the same position as their own avenger and give the camera a stern look, although that didn’t stop Tony on throwing up a peace sign right as the camera went off.
“PAPA!” Steve could hear Peter's voice from across the parking lot.  When Steve turned around he saw his son exiting the school building, dragging a boy with black hair behind him.
Tony struggled to sit down. His back slid against the rocky surface of the ship's interior. The cold metal felt like it was piercing through his delicate skin. The abandoned and broken ship was too quiet for Tony’s liking. Every once in a while he would hear a small creak or a curse, and he knew that Nebula was doing something in another sector of the ship. She still had hope that someone would find them. Tony wasn’t as optimistic.
“I do. You’re really nice and pretty and smart. Oh, and these are for you too.” He handed her the Tupperware of cookies he had behind his back. “I made these for you. I mean, my dad helped, but I did most of the work.”
So Tony really had no other option except to call him ‘Clyde’. Because, really, he couldn’t bring himself to call him ‘Captain’ every time. And while Tony does admit that he has a thing for a man in uniform, he does not have a thing for higher authority figures than himself, so constant ‘Captain-calling’ just won’t work. But the more Tony continued to call him ‘Clyde’, he could see now that nickname gets under the man's skin. The Captain's eye will twitch, or his jaw will clench. Tony finds it kind of adorable that he can get under the man's skin just by calling him the name that he gave him in the first place.
“Steve. That’s my name.” Tony completely froze. The Captain brought his hands forward and cupped his cheeks, spreading his tears with his thumb. “Steve Rogers.”
“Is this what you wanted?” He asked as he picked up both plushies in one hand, and held them in front of Peter. “Do you miss your dads?” Peter clutched the closest plushie, Captain America, against his chest, “They’ll be back in a few hours. I promise.” Clint waited ten more minutes before bringing Peter back to the other Avengers.
Tony stayed home for the rest of the day, watching and waiting. Not wanting to miss seeing Peter crawl again.
Before Steve could defend himself by going to the kitchen and opening their stuffed cabinets for Tony to see, he heard a faint sniffle behind him. Both husbands snapped their heads in the direction of the sound to find Peter with red, puffy eyes. His lips were pursed and he was starting to shake as he released another sniffle. Both husbands surged forward and each wrapped an arm around Peter.
Some mornings he would wake up early and find a warm body up against his. His first thought would always be
“When Daddy first admitted that he liked you, did you say it back? He told me that you two worked best when you were honest and he decided to tell you the truth. Papa?”
“Well I'm going to have to talk to Daddy about this first, and then we'll have to talk to Ned’s parents. Okay?”
Tony closed his eyes and took deep breaths. He stayed like that for a while, hoping that eventually his mind would shut down and he would drift off into a peaceful sleep. But sleep didn’t come.
When Tony got back from Siberia, after he checked on Vision and Rhodey, he went into Steve’s room and finally accepted everything that had happened. He spent the next week holed up in Steve’s things. Tony slept in Steve’s bed, wore Steve’s clothes, read Steve’s books, and looked through Steve’s drawings. After a week he decided that he didn’t want to shed any more sad tears for Steve Rogers.
“And when did you have time to realize what my notebook was?” He hummed. “Because at no point, when you stormed into my office, did you have time to look through that book.” When the man said nothing, the realization hit him. Gasping loudly, he yelled, “You took it as revenge!” Damn that son of a bitch got lucky, grabbing the closest object to him to get back at Tony. He probably believed that he was taking Tony’s day planner or his empty monogrammed journal. Definitely not a book containing the secrets of New York Cities' three largest gangs.
“Remind me again why you waited two days until Christmas to find Peter a gift?” Pepper asked as she and Tony looked at the selection of baby clothes in Macy’s.
Squinting his eyes, he zeroed in on his target. Pressing down on the trigger, a single bullet fired from the revolver lodged comfortably in his hands. The familiar BANG! reached his ears as a smile spread across his face.
Steve looked up from his newspaper and over toward his son whose mouth was filled with a spoonful of Cheerios. “Peter I told you,” he said as he wiped the milk off his son's chin, “don’t talk with your mouthful.” Steve watched as his son carefully chewed and swallowed his food before continuing
“Anymore?” ‘Clyde's’ face shifted from one of confusion to dawning. “You're breaking up with me? That's what this note meant? That's you're done?” He looked back and forth between Tony and the note in his hand as if that would change the writing on the paper.
The room erupted in a chorus or “not it” before Sam, who claimed that he would be an amazing babysitter, begrudgingly got off the couch and headed towards Peter’s room, where he remained for the next forty-five minutes until Peter fell back asleep.
Tony froze for a moment, temporarily blindsided by Peter's question. He quickly came up with a story, deciding that making up a nice story would sound better to his six-year-old's ears than the truth. After all, how do you tell your kid that you and his father danced around each other for years, finding ways to be around each other as much as possible before giving up and trying to move on but then waking up naked in bed together after a night of drinking?
“Are you saying that you don’t miss me whenever we go a few hours without seeing each other? Because that’s rude.” Steve smiled at the snark in Tony's voice.
Tony took the few clothes that he bought yesterday, a new set of Avenger plushies, along with some of the child development books Rhodey had gotten him and gave those to Peter who immediately reached for the hulk plushy and sneezed on it before holding it hostage in his little arms.
The world seemed to be in an uproar when they found out that the one-and-only Tony Stark was officially married. Many people were happy for him, but many were also upset that they hadn’t known. The people wanted to see a superhero wedding, after all. Tony hasn’t been seen in New York since, however, sources claim that he has been traveling back-and-forth from the Avenger’s Compound to Stark Industries for meetings, conferences, and testings.
So Tony tip-toed through the house, surprised that he didn’t run into anyone. Usually, Hawkeye could be found in the kitchen and the Winter Soldier and Black Widow sitting together on the couch. But tonight everything was quiet in the seemingly empty house.
For the first time in a long time, Tony smiled. He knew that he needed to talk with Steve, not just about the past, but about finding a way to undo the annihilation caused by Thanos. But right now, none of that mattered. What mattered was Tony had Steve back. And to him, that was a victory that he really needed.
“Just get a room.” Tony and Steve both jumped in their seats as they turned their attention over towards Clint, who was hunched over the table with a mouthful of cereal, rolling his eyes in Natasha’s direction. “It is too early in the morning to see you two making bedroom eyes at each other. I’m trying to eat here.” He groaned as he shoved another spoonful of Foot Loops into his mouth.
