"I dunno, Tony, I mean, do you really want to give that a shot?" Steve asked, but Tony's answer was cut off.
"Yeah," Tony responded, gleaming with pride. "It's mostly different lab areas."
"So, does anyone have any ideas as to how we're going to be getting the Hulk somewhere safe? I mean, if Bruce decided to go all mean and green again, don't we want him someplace where he won't kill anyone?" Natasha asked.
Just then, Tony and Bruce came out of the front door.
Steve tried to stifle a laugh. "It sounds like a plan. I'll drive Bells over later, around 5-ish, and I'll bring food. Then we can start."
With much effort, thanks to a lot of bruises from Bruce's Hulk, Steve sat up, completely awake and alert when he saw the state that Banner was in.
"Bruce Banner," Steve replied.
It could only have been luck that Howard Stark stormed into the lab area just then, panic in his eyes. "Anthony Stark! What the hell are you doing?"
What does PE Class look like when you spend it with Clint Barton and Natasha Romanov? Well, Steve Rogers is certainly about to find out.
Everyone gave him a look that basically said, "you have your archery equipment in your car?"
Steve was safe, for now. And for Coulson, that's what mattered.
"You were supposed to be home last night by midnight, and no later. And no one was answering the phone here," Coulson gave a pointed look at Howard, who had followed him down, "so came over myself."
“Poetic,” Steve repeats to himself quietly, turning the word over in his mind.  The piece of vibranium once kept in Tony’s heart might have been just that, but he thinks the word is better suited to describe how they seem to have found each other now.
Steve wants to care – and part of him does, the part that had kind of hoped that he and Tony had finally found some common ground, some mutual respect, and could work together well in the future – but right now he’s too exhausted to deal with a man who had taken what had happened while fighting as an Avenger and pulled entirely the wrong lessons from it.  After Tony first decided that he could handle every situation on his own, he then turned around and decided he’d rather not handle any situation at all.  Both decisions seemed like the wrong call.
There’s not really enough room on the couch for both of them to lie down beside each other, but they make it work.  As he wraps an arm around Natasha’s slender waist, he can’t suppress a light chuckle.  This is not how he imagined his first time sleeping with a dame would be.
“You two are ridiculous, I hope you know that.”
“I promise you, Tony, ‘riff-raff’ or no, I’m not keeping any important messages from you.” Pepper eyes him warily. “You know, you could just
right in the room next door.
*******
Pepper is warm and easy-going with Steve, making things instantly more comfortable for everyone.  She seems to genuinely enjoy Steve’s company – the way he’s charming without trying, the way he occasionally slips and calls her Miss Potts and then blushes, like being proper is something to blush over.
He doesn’t know who has been following Tony for days, whose finger has twitched on the trigger of his handgun or around the handle of his knife, ready to kill him just because Tony’s smiling at Steve over a cup of afternoon coffee at their favorite café or because Tony’s hand is on the small of Steve’s back as they sweep their way down a red carpet at a charity ball.
Tony spends the rest of the night taking Steve to pieces, not caring that he’s falling apart right alongside him.
“Yeah, it was one of the shots where the sound didn’t roll. It’s a short enough gap to fill that we’re just using the MOS we got, and the Foley guys laid down an ambient track.”
“I know…but I should go before it starts to get light out.” Tony reluctantly admits, slipping off to Steve’s side again as he glances toward the window. Steve nods, knowing that’s true.
“Most respectfully, I do agree with Brother Stark,” Thor states.  “It seems highly irregular to inform the Captain of his comrade’s continued existence on this earthly plane to only then turn about and deny him the right to visit this dear friend.”
Steve gets a bottle of water from the small fridge he’d installed and twists off the cap, handing it to Tony.
– he does this, goes after Steve, it’s going to mean losing her for good.  It’s a huge risk that he doesn’t want to take, especially since being with Steve is beyond wishful thinking and Pepper’s so real, and so very much his.
“Out with it, Stevie.  Don’t tell me, milk man? Paper delivery boy?  No…please tell me that you worked at the corner soda shoppe and wore one of those funny white paper hats and a red bowtie?  I bet the girls just loved you.”
“You can still fund them, supply them with tech if they need it, without living with them.  We could re-build the house in Malibu, put some distance between you and the team.”
“Welcome home.”
Steve pauses for a moment, taking a deep breath and looking Tony in the eyes to make sure the man understands him this time.
“We’re going there.” Off Tony’s displeased look, Pepper gives him one of her own.  “Face facts, Tony, you don’t have a name here. If you were making weapons and we were in Washington, then yeah, everyone would come to you. But you’re nothing more than a dollar sign out here, especially if you’re not willing to trade on your family’s history with the
“You want to try a relationship with Tony? The two of you?”
The next few weeks for Steve flew by.
Steve flinched at the use of his last name to address him, his memories of the US Military volunteer program fresh in his mind. "Please, call me Steve. I'm on my way to a chemistry class."
"That's why I think we should start working on it tonight," Bruce said, and Tony gave him a look of exasperation. "What? It's a Friday night, I know for a fact that none of us have anything going on," Tony was still giving him the look, "yes, even you, Mr. Perfect. We have the entire weekend to observe results, and the lab, whatever we try, is due on Monday."
to reach out and touch him.
Bucky takes Steve at his word and takes his time.
. It wasn’t even anything…I don’t know what I’m going to do, what I would do if…”
“It’s like he’s angry at me but doesn’t want to tell me why.” Steve tries to put his finger on the difference. He rubs his face, the feeling of stubble strange under his hands. They’ve been shooting the scenes where his detective is down on his luck, finding solace in the bottom of a bottle, and the art-mimics-life of it all is not lost on him. If anything, it’s only made him feel worse, his job giving him license to wallow rather than demanding that he get his head on straight. “I’ve tried asking him what’s wrong but every time I do, it gets worse.”
Steve lifts his eyebrows, too wiped to voice the question.
,” Steve mumbles when he finally stops hacking, his voice rough and hollow. He crumples up the tissue in aggravation, tight in the ball of his fist. He draws his legs in close and leans his head against his knees. It hurts Bucky to hear him struggling to breathe.
“It’s not like you’ve never done it.” Steve mutters, the double standard rubbing him the wrong way even when he knows Bucky’s exactly right. He’d never pay a dame for a night; that’s never been a thing he considered honorable for a man to do.
Bucky throws his head back, letting out a grunt of pleasure each time he grinds down against Steve’s face, Steve’s tongue. Tony doesn’t know how Steve is breathing, but they must have some system, some experience at this, because Bucky doesn’t back off for even a moment.
“It’s a bit more complicated than that, but yeah, for all intents and purposes that’s about right.  Repaired the old ticker too,” Tony replies, tapping his fingers against the center of his chest where that strange blue light used to be.
As Thor continues to praise his breakfast meat, Natasha spears a piece of cantaloupe on her plate and wordlessly drops it onto Clint’s beside his cottage cheese.  She hates the orange melon while he loves it.  He gives her his watermelon in trade; it’s a system they have worked out.
“Buck and I went exploring quite a bit when we first moved here. The beach is quiet, and we took a fancy to that diner down the way. Serves breakfast all day.” Steve nods his head toward the bright yellow building perched on an overlook just down the way, the green and white signage reading
“Yeah.  Well.  We’ll have to reset those parameters then, won’t we.”  He puts some space between Steve and himself, straightening up his workspace.  It’s something he hasn’t done in months and some of this stuff he doesn’t even remember using.  “Oh, that’s where it went.  Totally forgot about that.”  He comments as he finds a blueprint for a new car engine that he’d folded up and set aside over six months ago.  It’d had some fundamental problems, but maybe it’s worth re-visiting.  He unfolds it and tacks it to the nearest board.  “And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I should never start anything on paper.”
“I appreciate your concern, and I’m sorrier than I can say that I didn’t call, but one night out doesn’t mean I’m suddenly a different person.”
warning.”
“JARVIS, can I install an access code for this floor?”
“Steve…Steve, I’m gonna, I’m gonna come, we gotta…” Steve lets go of his ironclad grip on Bucky’s hips and Tony sees the deep purple bruises already forming there. Bucky thighs are trembling as he climbs off of Steve and kneels beside him on the bed.  His hard-on is standing nearly straight up against his stomach, less thick than Steve but nearly as long.  These two are ridiculous.
The crash seems ridiculously loud in the now quiet room.
“It’s not too late?”
Tony manages to push himself upright. He tosses the newspaper aside without looking at it and clumsily reaches for the coffee. It tastes like something died in his mouth.
But he’s not accustomed to doing good and he’s not sure he knows how.
“That’s always a risk.” Tony admits plainly. He rubs Steve’s arm as Steve involuntarily tenses. “All of us can talk about it together, tomorrow, okay? Tonight, it’s you and me.”
“You know, this time, last year, I was in China with Natasha, chasing after the Winter Soldier, not even aware I was really chasing Bucky.”  Steve speaks first, walking closer to the railing in an unspoken invitation for Tony to join him.
“This isn’t for that,” Bucky replies, nudging the bag toward Steve.  “I just…picked up some old favorites.”
“And Clint snoring like a lawnmower,” Natasha adds.
“You’ve never been all that discerning before,” Steve retorts, not so much critical as maybe a little annoyed.  Tony gives him half a shrug and opens the bottle, pours himself two fingers.  He hesitates, then pours a glass for Steve too and slides it over.
called
“It’s yours, you can slap your name on it if you want,” Steve murmurs, halfway to sleep as his eyes drift closed.
His shoes catch on the ridge where the stairs collapse, but Steve steadies him without comment, and also pulls him out of the way when he stops in his tracks, at a loss for where to go.
“It’s a perfect picture of something, all right, though I’m not sure what.”
…feels so good…” Steve gasps. He reaches up with his left arm, wraps a hand behind Tony’s head as they continue to kiss. Bucky’s metal hand starts to roam over Steve’s body, dropping his hold across Steve’s shoulders to run over his arms, his stomach, his thighs, and then back up again. “Come inside me. Bucky, please, let him come inside me.”
“So it looks like you and I need to talk, Stark.”
“So when you asked about the problem, that was a rhetorical question then. You’ve already decided what it is.”
“We were all really scared.”
So even if Pepper had all the facts, she probably wouldn’t have been able to stop this anyway.  When Captain Steven G. Rogers opened his eyes on the year 2012, Tony falling in love with him was a foregone conclusion.
“We should go get them if we’re going to set these pumpkins out tonight.”
It stings a little, once he parses Steve’s polite, detached speech and realizes that he has in essence been rebuffed as Steve’s shoulder to lean on.  It should be fine, since Tony never meant to offer that shoulder in the first place.  Instead it feels like the kind of rejection Tony hasn’t allowed himself to feel in years.
“Well.  Didn’t think you had that in you, Cap.”
Tony will get Steve back, because he won’t be able to live with himself if he doesn’t, but whatever they were building toward,
“When did you get here?”
“He didn’t.  He told you?”  Tony knows Steve didn’t, wouldn’t have, but Natasha
For one brief, horrific moment, Tony worries that he may turn the corner and look up to the loft, find Steve running those amazing, strong hands of his over Bucky’s body, but he quickly dismisses the thought.  As a fear, it’s downright insane, because Steve would never do that to him, and he understands that as surely as he understands gravity and mechanics and the speed of light.  But it’s still a fear that won’t go away for good, maybe because he wants to be Steve’s
They press pause on their conversation as the hors d’oeuvres arrive – shrimp cocktails, rolled toast with mushrooms, and stuffed olives with bacon. Steve’s glass of wine is refilled before it can go empty.
“Yeah?”
“Because
“Fury.”  She gestures somewhere to her right.  “Fury’s got Barnes.  Fury.  Over there.”
“A whole…fifteen…minutes…” Tony looks down at his expensive wristwatch, tapping its glass face with one finger, considering. “Whatever shall I do…”
is clearly disappointed.
Tony finishes with a choked off groan, tension waning as he sags at the middle, bending in over himself. The moment is brief, however; Tony slowly begins to stroke and rock over him again, Steve’s length yet hard in his grasp.
“It could be different than this.”
Tony stumbles into their kitchen around 10am, blinking sleep from his blurry eyes. He hadn’t meant to sleep in, but apparently he’d been more strung out last night than he realized. He supposes the anxiety of his and Steve’s situation had taken its toll. It’s not every night he talks to his boyfriend about being in love with someone else.
“I’ll go keep Tony from doing something stupid.”
He’s working on Steve’s belt, and Steve should be stopping him, but he’s not.  And the fact that he’s not makes Tony’s head swim.  He whispers something vulgar, maybe an entirely unedited stream of thought about Steve’s body and what he wants to do to it, and Steve
“She’s not wrong, you know. Stark could be a good thing for you. A boost for your career.”
“The only way I’m ever playing that song is if Ingrid Bergman herself walks in here and asks for it. If she can stand it, I can stand it.”
been awake, Stark?” Steve counters.
He wipes sweat from his brow with the corner of his white tank and then finishes pushing one into place.
She nods politely in thanks, not really looking at him, and her companion doesn’t give him so much as a glance.
“Well speak of the devil,” Jan purrs, turning toward Bucky and crossing her legs. “Your ears must be burning, Mr. Barnes.”
Their friends fall back into pleasant chatter as Tony forgets his breakfast, content to lose himself in Steve’s maple syrup-tinged kiss.
“And you, what do you kneel for?”
“I don’t know about that.”
“Oh, my delicate ears, how will I recover,” Natasha sighs in a Southern accent, fanning herself. “Assholes are a dime a dozen in this town, Steve. If you avoid them, you’re going to be out of a job. So the question is, is Stark the kind of asshole you can work with, or no?”
“Then I met you. And I get it, I see it. You have the makings of a star, Steve Rogers.”
“Wonderful.”
Tearing his gaze from Steve’s bulging biceps, he notices the pained look on Steve’s face and realizes too late that jokes about lost arms probably aren’t in his best interest at this point.  Leave it to him to shove his foot in his mouth this quickly.  Has to be some kind of record.
“Jesus Christ.” Peter thumps his head down on the table as Tony walks away, whistling.
“That’s SOP where Stark is concerned.”  Phil kisses Pepper’s hand in a very gentlemanly, respectable fashion and Tony rolls his eyes.
“This can’t be true.”
“Tony, you need to hear me. If Steve comes to me and he wants this...I am not going to be able to say no.”
“Pepper, you are absolutely breathtaking this evening.” Phil offers her his arm, very obviously turning away from Tony.  “Would you care to join me for a drink?”
“Gonna hold me prisoner?”  Steve smiles against his cheek, his hands sliding underneath Tony’s thin t-shirt, those wide palms pressing flat along his lower abs, fingertips tracing the bottom edge of the arc reactor.   For someone whose longest previous relationship lasted the length of one passionate kiss, Steve’s surprisingly good with casual intimacy.  “Keep me tied up?”
“It’s a nice looking thing, Boss.”
, we have publicity for the film scheduled for the next two weeks straight.”
you.”
Steve’s heady gaze shifts toward him, hearing his curse, and even though he looks too far gone to stop, there’s still apparent shock evident in Steve’s eyes at seeing Tony there in his bedroom.
Bucky texted a snapshot of the note Tony left behind. The note that basically gave Bucky permission to do anything he wanted with Tony’s boyfriend.
“I’ve been to the tower a few times.”  Steve rolls up his shirtsleeves and folds his leather jacket over his arm.  It’s warm out still; he’d forgotten how the city streets bake in the summer heat.  It’s funny though – he’s not really sweating so much as he feels like he
“Yeah.  I get it.”  Barnes says quietly.  Tony nods, and at least Steve manages to give him a small nod in return.
Bucky’s bedroom door is shut, his light off. The snore that interrupts the silence assures Tony that in his stupor Bucky must have tumbled into bed and he probably, hopefully, won’t wake until morning.
Jan comes back into view with his tuxedo gathered in her arms.
“Is this Red Room?” Tony demands from her as Clint clears the stairwell and they begin to climb upward.  “This is about Barnes defecting?”
“Yes, ma’am.”  Tony salutes her with his spoon, fully intending to disregard the warning.
“I know we both have to be at the premiere, but after that I think we shouldn’t… I know it’s a small town and in all likelihood we might run into each other, but as much as possible…” Steve looks at him and the pain that Tony sees there will stay with him until his dying day. “I don’t want to see you again.”
While he waits, he thinks back on Bruce’s statement, wondering if he really had wanted Steve from word go.  Way back when Steve was studying graphic design at Pratt and Tony was getting a computer science degree to keep his earlier mechanical engineering degree from MIT company.  Steve, who was best of best friends with Barnes, who studied drama at NYU and dated Natasha, who was pals with Clint, who partied with Thor, who roomed with Bruce, who took class with Tony…
“But –”
Steve doesn’t answer. He’s left breathless by the time Tony pulls back and starts moving his mouth down Steve’s body.
“I know Kermit’s your bro, but-“
“It means that Natasha’s not wrong.  She’s never wrong.  Not about things like this.”  Tony steps down off the treadmill and pushes past Steve, his mood shifting from acerbic and annoyed to downright stormy.
“You are.” Natasha holds up her hand, cutting him off.  “And you know it.” Bucky casts his gaze down to the floor, refusing to acknowledge how right she is. “You’re the only one around who knows what it was like for Steve before.  You’re best equipped to help him adjust and get through this.”
“Won’t say a word.” Steve promises.  Natasha draws back, her fingers tracing the length of a bruise on his cheek.  She presses just hard enough for him to feel it.
When Tony pulls away, he’s treated to the sight of an absolutely

The only rush that comes close to this is the first time he flew the suit. He rests his weight down against Steve, naked bodies flush against each other. All his angles and curves meld to Steve’s, slotting together perfectly.
“My darling Jane, should I be concerned?” Thor gestures between his wife and Steve, but his smile is broad and his tone jovial.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve greets him in a soft and low mumble.  Tony lets his hand slip higher, fingers brushing Steve’s calf underneath the loose leg of his jeans.  The muscles shift beneath his touch, Steve stretching a little.
“A thing?”  Natasha nods, frustratingly vague, and Tony makes a face at her.  “You and Clint are always going off on ‘things’.  SHIELD-related ‘things’.  Fury should really be sending us all out on these ‘things’.  You know, team building and other such nonsense.  Misadventures and the like breed brotherhood.  Or so I’ve heard. I never got much into the whole frat thing at college.  I think I’d enjoy hazing Katniss, though that’s just a guess.”
“You know, people usually sleep with the producer because they
“He’ll have a headache, sure, but the Other Guy usually bears the brunt of the bad stuff,” Tony explains as he squints in the bright sunlight, looking around.  “Whoever our guardian angel is, he or she is a hell of a shot.”
“Can’t believe that.”  Tony really can’t.  He can’t imagine Steve longing for him this way.  “Since when?”
“So, Cap, where are we going next?”
“So now that our fugitive friends are back in the fold…Steve and I worked some stuff out.” Tony doesn’t explain further, though there’s clearly more explanation to be had.
“Don’t.”  Tony grits out, flexing his fingers in front of him, staring down at the ground.  His knuckles are bloody from where his fist shattered the desk.  He feels the split skin sting, vaguely, like he’s two steps removed from himself.
As scared as he is of being a powerless cog in someone else’s machine, he’s equally scared of being powerless to this immoral desire, the need to
Steve leaves, grumbling something to himself and shaking his head but smiling all the same, and Peter doubles down on the math problem in front of him, even though the numbers are no longer making a lick of sense.
“Currently Barnes is cooperating under the provision that he does not have any direct contact with you.”
“Really.” Natasha drums her fingers on the tabletop, bright yellow painted nails tapping a steady rhythm against the worn wood.
“C’mon.” She jerks her head toward the staircase.  “You should get some sleep.”
Natasha slinks in between Clint and Tony, as always having a sixth sense about where she needs to be.
He circles around to the cabinet tucked between his posters of
“As much as I appreciate being involved, you two must have discussed
“You’re in a hotel suite on the 4th floor of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. You’ve been here for one night. It’s 10 in the morning on Saturday, August 6th, 1949.” Steve nods again, everything registering clearly. He begins to relax, his breathing returning to normal. “I’m Tony Stark, millionaire movie producer and arrogant asshole extraordinaire, and you’re naked because we just fucked each other senseless for
The Winter Soldier is not ready to be caught.
“Son, I need you to show me to the Stark Suite, that’s what I need.”
A faint but real smile, weak from non-use, comes over Steve’s face as Tony drains half the glass and then slides it back.
Luckily, Steve himself provides Tony with some options.
“Well you can be, if you wanna. Nick sent me over here to tell you to take a load off.”
experienced.”
Tony stares at Steve, that first moment of shock settling into something much harder and unforgiving.
“He’s wiping me and starting over.”
“Tell me again why I’m doing this?”
He cannot remember a time when he felt this nervous about seeing someone.  As prone as he is to hyperbole, it isn’t an exaggeration.  His whole body is in tumult: anticipation and anxiety, desire and doubt, all these different emotions tugging him in multiple directions.
He woke up the next morning in Steve’s arms, and that, as they say, was that.
The way the man moves is somehow familiar – an impossible grace and control as he quickly loads up a cart with supplies, heavy items giving him not the slightest trouble. When he stops to pull a list from his back pocket, he pulls off his right work glove with his teeth and grabs the pencil from above his ear, checking off items with an intense concentration that brings a furrow to his brow.
“No, we’ve got to find the
“Adjust and get through
“You were attempting to fix a glitch in the programming software for the climate controls on a clean energy powered sports car?”
“Team effort.  Yay.”  Tony chuckles with a half-hearted cheer, trying to take the note back.  Steve makes a move to crumple it up and toss it aside but Tony grabs it, straightening the crinkled paper out.  He sets it on the nightstand as Steve lifts an eyebrow, confused.  “Hey, Cap, I plan on taking that seriously.”
“It’s a helluva lot harder to share a bunk with him now that he’s double the size, triple the weight, and one of us is waking the other with our stupid nightmares every five minutes,” Bucky explains.  “He’s been insisting on giving me the bed for weeks now.”
“I don’t think I’ll change my mind.”
and…” Bucky wraps his arms tightly around himself. His whole body is starting to hurt, all over, his limbs aching and his stomach twisting, and he realizes tears are threatening to spill. He doesn’t want Tony to see this. He may love Steve and because of that he deserves some answers, but he doesn’t have the right to Bucky’s pain.
“God help me, Pepper, if you
“I’ll call you from New York,” Tony murmurs as he presses a kiss to Steve’s temple.
“This must have been confusing as hell, Buck. I’m sorry, I—”
He spends four days on Rogers’ tail before he’s pulled back in to Pierce.  Four days is evidently longer than he usually needs to get a job done.
“I shall assist you if necessary, sir.”
“It’s really no trouble,” Tony insists and Steve lets him have it, not in the mood to argue.
Barnes swallows, nods his head slowly.
“So.” He starts, nudging Steve’s mug back to him and then taking a sip of his own coffee, staring at Steve over the rim.
Tony is leaning leisurely in the open doorway, backlit warmly by the bright lights from the party inside.  His black bowtie is hanging undone around his open collar, half empty glass of champagne held loosely in his hand.  He’s devastatingly handsome in his black tuxedo, managing to look both distinguished and debauched.
“Crowded. Grand Army looks different, but the Plaza Hotel looks pretty much the same, even if it’s far more…” Steve pauses, “Uh,
Entering the apartment, Steve sees it with fresh eyes, wondering what it will look like to someone as fashionable as Janet. Their furniture is merely serviceable, their décor practically non-existent. Steve’s pretty sure the boring ocean landscape painting above the couch came with the place.
“Bucky…he could’ve had an easy life.  Sure, he was an orphan, like me, but he was different, Tony.  He was something else.  He had the looks, the smarts, the charm – he coulda had anything he wanted and he gave it all up, time ‘n time again, to be best friends with an annoying runt like me.  I dunno why he did it." Steve shakes his head, smiling sadly.  His wet hair is dripping into his eyes again and he pushes it back, and then sets his hands firmly back on his knees.
hear yourself think.”
“I’m impatient.”   He picks up the sugar from the table and pours a large amount into his cup.  “This coffee is awful.”
As it is, this isn’t the first lighting mishap on the film, much less the first one
“That’s just it. I don’t know that I will be.”
But Tony doesn’t have a clue why he came, or more to the crux of the matter, what he hopes to gain from being here.  All he knows is that he was in his lab and he felt like he was crawling out of his skin.  After a few weeks the excitement over the plans to reconfigure Stark Tower for the Avengers’ use wore off, and even the prospect of the work he and Bruce might be able to complete together, their two great minds combined, faded as nighttime minutes ceaselessly ticked their way into early morning hours.  Not even repairs and re-designs to his suit could release the pressure building up inside of him and he could feel his gears rattling, gaskets getting ready to blow.
because you told them to. Mindless sycophants aren’t your style. It’s pretty much the only reason I keep working for you.”
He shoves down Steve’s pants just enough to get his length free, waistband tucked snugly underneath Steve’s balls. When Steve was changed back to his pre-serum self, Tony had honestly been
“Well I, I’d like us to be friends.”
Natasha pushes him out onto the busy street, Clint following at much more leisurely pace.  Steve straightens out his red and white-checkered shirt, adjusting the buttons and the collar, and now that his world is steady and he’s not being shoved down a flight of stairs, he stops and takes Clint and Natasha in.
“I honestly don’t know what else to say.  I thought you were going to bring him back.”
He must pass out, because he doesn’t remember anything after that.
“Look, Buck.  Home.  You’re home.”
“Since Vegas.  Aspen.  Not really sure.” Steve gently touches the arc reactor with the tips of his fingers, and Tony’s astounded by how the light plays across Steve’s handsome features and that Steve’s attraction to him isn’t some newfound revelation.
“Nobody says you have to move in there,” Clint mutters.
“And you get far too much enjoyment from doing it, Romanoff.”
“Maybe you’re not looking for anything. Maybe it found you. Life works that way sometimes.”
“You’re a
The wartime remembrances of his nightmares have been pushed out by the sensual memories of last night, but he’s still teetering off-balance. He’s simultaneously unsettled and undone, something dark digging at his mind even as arousal is racing through his veins.
gonna help me save Captain America, god only knows, but it’ll sure help if I ever decide to take remedial geography at BMCC!”
He takes Steve to all the great places he knows, but the restaurant he chooses, the club he picks, even the luxury hotel he checks them into, don’t seem to do the trick.  Steve’s smiling, Steve’s polite, but it’s not the right kind of smile, and they should be passed polite.  Tony plainly doesn’t know Steve well enough to give him a good time, but he does know him well enough to see through the act.
“I want to talk to him,” Barnes directs this request to Fury, gesturing toward Tony with both hands, zip-tied at the wrists.  Hill keeps a firm grip at his elbow.
“Fitting.”
“You mean
Bucky sucks in a deep breath, a dark look crossing over his face.  Tony turns even gloomier, which makes Steve sorry for even having brought it up.  He should’ve waited for his doctor, whoever that might be, or maybe Bruce.
He never would’ve guessed he’d come to personally know not one but two generations of Starks, much less receive direct orders to bunk under their roof.
“You keep mommying them and they’re never going to leave,” Tony warns as Steve grabs four more bottles, knowing enough to grab double for Thor.

as their ring tone?” Pepper retorts coolly, arching an eyebrow, and Tony ducks his head sheepishly and frowns at his phone, the traitor. He flips the setting to silent, though it seems that’s shutting the gate after the horses have bolted. “And I’m assuming that since we’re not turning the plane around and hightailing it back to New York, Steve is okay, so what’s going on?”
He sucks in a deep breath, considering doing it, just bringing himself off quick and dirty all over the tile, when the bathroom door opens, bringing with it a rush of cool air that flutters the shower curtain.
It’s a lesson Steve learned very early in their relationship.  He’s hesitant to say

In the logical part of his brain and the sensible chamber of his heart, he doesn’t want to do this to Pepper.  If –
“This is too much, Tony.”  Steve interrupts, coming back over.  He’s flushed, looking worried.  “I can’t accept this.”
Tony wrenches the shower on and disrobes quickly, climbing in before the water has a chance to heat.  The fact that his dick’s already half-hard sends another wave of guilt crashing over him for having hung up on Pepper.
“Appreciate that, Tony, it’s very kind, but I already ate.”
Even so, some mornings when Steve wakes up and Tony’s sleeping beside him, beautiful in the early morning light, he so badly wants to know it will last forever.
“Exactly, you’re the producer. So I don’t think you want us falling behind,” Steve counters, covering Tony’s hand with his, stilling it. “Besides, how would we explain it, me taking off with you to New York all of a sudden?”
“He wasn’t my
“I’ll always need you,” Tony replies truthfully.
Not that it’s not highly sexual too.  Cause it is.
Steve has to smile a little at the analogy.
“In case you haven’t noticed, there’s nobody around you in a five foot radius. You’re scaring away all my customers.”
"You say tomato, I say tomahto." Tony shrugs.
- Geez, Steve. There's a difference between going out with your pals and painting the town red with that spoiled idiot. You'll be plastered all over the gossip rags like he is if you're not careful."
to know that by now.  Tony had spent long enough learning how to say it, to keep saying it, despite being programmed from birth to keep his cards close to his chest.
He thinks it’s perfect until Happy rolls up to Madison Square Garden and Steve gets out.  He stares at the building, and then casts about for a street sign, and then looks back at the building with utter dismay.
He’s seen these weaknesses play out for others before and it never ends well, but the emotions come, ceaselessly, wave after wave after wave.
"Aw," Clint cooed, walking into the room, "you two are adorable."
, is actually a highly trained hand-to-hand combat assassin. The chemistry teacher has been working in the chemical engineering department of SHIELD for over ten years now, helping in weapons development alongside Stark, so he knows how important Rogers is to keep safe."
"You think it's so impossible," Steve said, "then turn around and look in that lab, and tell me that doesn't look absolutely impossible right before your eyes."
, he failed to notice all of the heads he was turning.
A chemist, a physicist, and a super soldier walk into a lab... and the physicist has a crush on the super soldier...
Steve started to respond to Tony's flirtation, but he was still shocked and flustered from the interaction. "I-" He started, but he heard a click of the door to the lab room. The blonde watched as Bruce walked through the encased lab and to the table, putting the cage of rats on it. It was clear that he was completely oblivious to Steve and Tony in the control room.
"That is irrelevant," Tony snapped back, scanning the panel in a fury, "Bruce set the entire thing up. All I could think about was... Never mind, that's not important. We need to figure this thing out."
Tony grabbed a nearby blanket, stuck his key in the lock, turned the door open, and quietly strut into the lab room.
"Didn't he notice the thudding of our bodies being thrown across the room last night?" Steve muttered to Tony as they walked out of the lab room and up to the living room of the mansion.
Natasha, who had followed him silently down to the lab, punched him hard on the arm. "You idiot, it's a lab room. If they had girls involved, it would have been the pool, or the bedroom."
"Come on," Steve spoke with his soldier-like initiative, picking up Tony and shoving him over his strong shoulder. The two ran into the control room,where Steve placed Tony down in the rolling chair and strolled him to the control panel.
"I'm one of the agents for SHIELD, the company that your father used to work for. But my question is," Coulson turned from his conversations about work to Steve, "why weren't you at home by curfew last night, young man?"
"Mother of God..." Howard muttered, putting his hands to his mouth. He almost fell over. "It really is... it really is you! The super-soldier! My super-soldier!"
"How do we shut it off?" Steve asked, panicked.
"But-but-" Tony was so frustrated it was almost comical.
, the computer's voice responded. So, Tony kept flipping various switches. "There has to be something, there just has to be- damnit! Where the hell is it?"
Soon, the class ended, and Steve headed home, his motorcycle, Bells, being his private escape from the crazy world he just launched himself into.
"Well..." Tony smirked, batting his eyelashes at Bruce in a "you know you love me" sort of way.
Every time there was a lab they were supposed to be working on, Steve would put on his protective goggles like he knew what he was doing and set off to work, eventually messing up the entire lab and forcing a do-over. Tony never quite really got mad at Steve for that, though. He more just gave him an extremely affectionate look, a pat on the back, and it even looked like Tony longed to kiss Steve on the cheek. But maybe Steve was just hallucinating.
"Gym. With him and Natasha. She's like a freaking
Fury somewhat chuckled, or maybe it was a small burp from dinner, Coulson couldn't quite tell which. "This school is the safest in the district. It's SHIELD run. If anyone was
"Left foot on yellow," he hollered.
"It's not a problem, really," she responded. "Let me walk you to class." Just as she said that, a spiky-haired guy in a t-shirt, jeans, and converse came up from behind her and wrapped his arm around her waist, kissing her head.
But the eyes. They may have been green, and they may have been becoming savage with rage toward the two people he probably didn't want to see right now, but Stark was right. It was Bruce.
"You think," Bruce started breathing heavily, "that I can control this... this thing?" His voice hardly sounded like the Bruce that Tony knew and loved. It was deeper, like something bad was about to happen.
The laptop screen went blank, and Coulson shut it, putting it back in his briefcase and going up to his bedroom.
The minute Steve walked in the door, he was bombarded by questions from Uncle Coulson.
Steve grinned, and picked up his pace. In his new, US-Military-enhanced body, though, fast was fast. And walking fast meant that he ran into someone, both of them dropping their books like complete klutzes in the middle of the hall.
, if you will. We have to be careful. God knows how many people out there want a sample of his blood."
"Sorry?" Steve asked, not sure where he quite fit into this current conversation.
Tony decided that if they were alone, he would probably have already started making out with Steve by now; the redder he got, the sexier and more adorable he got. But he resisted temptation. "Come on, you've gotta tell me sooner or later."
In the midst of getting away from the heaving Bruce, Clint pulled out his wallet and slipped a ten-dollar bill into Tony's pocket.
"Bruce, buddy," Tony started, rubbing his back in a back-and-forth motion, "calm down. This lab can't take another beating."
"I hope they explode," Tony said, rubbing his hands together, bouncing up and down like an over-excited school girl. The smile on his face disturbed both of his friends.
The other end responded.
Steve looked up and stared right into Coulson's eyes. "Our... experiment went wrong."
"Damnit! I almost forgot that the door locks on the inside, too. Tony! Come over here, with your key!"
That's the last thing Steve remembered of that night.
"Yeah, what's your problem with me caring?" Clint asked, offended, coming and sitting down on the opposite side of Bruce. "I'm only saying..."
came up with this serum? The one that's coursing through my veins? But he said he
The screen showed Fury moving his hand from the top to the bottom, telling Coulson to calm down. "The minute you said you would be sending Rogers to this school, I started preparing. Each of the security guards that roams the halls keeps the small prototypes of the ray guns that Stark
Tony pushed back his hair and grinned. "Yes I am."
"Looking good in those shorts, hot stuff," Natasha laughed, slapping Steve on the ass.
No. He would think of another thing to say. Just not now.
Bruce thought about replying, but didn't.
The beast that they had been fighting sat in the corner directly across from them, wrapped around the original gamma ray mechanism. The beast towered over the lab room, its body filling up the entire corner it was in and then some. Steve's first-look impression was right by two details: it certainly was green, and it was more humanoid than what was expected. Hell, it looked like it was just a large, green bodybuilder wearing shorts.
What followed next was a satisfyingly loud smack.
"You're asking the wrong person," Clint responded, laughing, "I just fall in love with her every single time she speaks Russian fluently. I could care less if her English has an accent."
," Steve heard a prideful voice mutter, "who
"Holy shit!" Tony quickly attempted to sit upright, only prevented by the table that was laying over his chest from Steve's makeshift shield. As soon as he realized, Steve sheepishly removed his arm from Tony's chest, and took the shield off of his arm.
"Oh, shit!" Tony shouted, the seductive voice he had been using earlier completely gone and replaced with a sense of sheer terror.
"Everyone knows Tony will win at that. We're in his house right now, what do you think that says about his luck with money?" Natasha chuckled.
Tony heard the same roar that preceded his launching across the room, and heard a bang similar to that of metal on metal. Steve was launched backwards in his defensive position. The only thing that was different was a huge fist imprint on the little lab table-shield that was wrapped around his right arm.
"Bruce!" Steve shouted, as though scolding a child. He straightened his posture, adjusted the shield on his hand, and began to walk towards the massive green thing. "Tony was trying to help you! You do realize, that-"
The gas that streamed out was just cooled oxygen, so that was a plus. No noxious gasses to knock out Bruce. Both of them cautiously wandered into the room, keeping their eyes on the massive, heaving shape in the middle of the room, completely silent. Steve almost tripped over a random object on the ground: it was Bruce's pair of wire-framed glasses, a crack running through both of the lenses, the frame bent out of proportion.
"And what would that be, Captain?" Stark asked, resting his head on top of Steve's.
Bruce tried to push himself up again, succeeding and wrapping the blanket more around his entire body. "Well, I'm sure the Hu-" Bruce cleared his throat at saying the name of his new alter-ego, "the other guy-" he continued, "probably won't let me die any time soon. I'm pretty nervous to see what happens at even the slightest change in my surrounding environment at the moment."
"Well, you are the one who caused this entire thing," Clint mumbled, almost inaudibly.
"...And he hit on me!" Steve interjected, yelling. He immediately quieted his voice. "He pinned me against the panel, moved his hand up my thigh, and I overreacted and slammed my hands against the control panel. It just so happens that I accidentally pressed the red button in the process."
"It was this specialized, top-secret experiment program thing. They needed a volunteer and my parents and I weren't exactly well-off, along with the fact that my dad actually used to be in the military and, well, let's just say he's not around anymore..."
"No, no, no," Tony responded, shaking his head and grimacing as he did so. "Not in the way you'd really expect. Look, I need your help."
"You want to know what happened?" Bruce whimpered, tears welling up in his eyes. "Those two... those two idiots," he started to raise his voice, lifting a finger at Steve and Tony, "turned me into a monster. A big, green, out-of-control monster!" He started to shake, and looked up at Steve.
"Tony! Tony, it looks like-" Steve started to say, but the thing, a green, almost-human monster from what he could tell, sent him sailing across the room. He landed right by the lab table, which had also been sent across the room. Steve guessed that's what made the thud.
"Nice going, Captain!" Clint would shout, mocking Steve's US Military training. Steve kept having this feeling that Tony and Clint must meet up and tell each other about his chronic problem of messing up in what he doesn't know what he's doing.
"Wait, you're Steve's uncle, right?" Tony asked.
Howard flashed an angry glare towards her. "Whatever is happening, I don't believe it. That is completely im-"
"Tony!" He shouted again, still not completely able to see him. "Tony!"
before...
"Yeah, but that's not the point," Tony continued, "how do you know my dad?"
"Hey," Steve tried to flash a clever grin, holding out his hand.
Howard turned, and his eyes grew as wide as saucers. "Holy-" he paused, and thought for a second, "Ok. I have something for this kind of thing," he ran to the neighboring lab control room, pulling out a nasty looking gun. "This is a military-grade Stark Tranquilizer. It-"
"Steve, it's Bruce..." Tony barely said, the air knocked out of him.
"Get back," Steve commanded, grabbing the nearest fire extinguisher. When Tony refused to move, Steve gently nudged his companion out of the way. He started wailing on the door with the fire extinguisher, over and over again.
"Sounds like a good idea until Bruce decides to human down again," Clint chuckled. The team dragged Bruce's unconscious Hulk body down to the over-sized lab, and lay him down in a napping position.
"I do," Fury said, his smile almost indiscernible. "The gym teacher, though he's like
Because Steve, was, well,
?" Steve asked, shocked. "I couldn't even tell if she had an accent! How does that work?"
Steve shook his head. "You have no idea that I got training from the US Military, do you? I don't need a bow. I've got a shield," he held up his piece of fiberglass, "and raw strength."
"Let's hope not," Steve muttered through his teeth, giving Tony a concerned look.
"Hey, Clint? It's Tony," Tony muttered in a hushed tone into his phone.
"But not today," Steve said with a warning, glancing at Tony. "We can't exactly afford another problem today."
"Well, don't do it again, or I'll have to take care of you later," Steve threatened.
me one more time…”
He reluctantly uncurls his fingers.  One poor sketch is hardly reason to toss an entire book, no matter how wretched he’s feeling.
, right?”
“What…precisely is going on here?”  Tony makes a vague gesture around Steve’s person as he takes in the set of blue and white striped button-down pajamas that are hanging off Steve’s body.  They’re about a full size too big, which makes Tony wonder how and where Steve even found them.  And if he bothered telling Thor that he’d found a store with off-the-rack clothes made for giants.
Pepper laughs softly, her smile affectionate.
“Well let me tell you…” Tony starts, and then quickly realizes that he has no idea how to verbalize exactly how beautiful Steve’s work seems to him, or why.  “Okay, nevermind.  Just know that your evaluation of the piece has vastly underwhelmed me.”
He winks, then pushes off of Steve’s chest.
“And you’re not a dame.”
.”  Tony mistakes his intent gaze as judgment for his lack of manners.  “I’m sorry, I’m a man; men burp.”
“Christ, Buck,” Steve sighs, despite knowing it's in his best interest to keep quiet and let this all blow over. “I’m an adult. I don’t need a lecture.” Steve closes his eyes, wishing the words back into his mouth. He turns to face Bucky and meets his unimpressed glare.
“Well, who could hate magic?” Bucky asks, and Tony promptly lifts his hand.
At that point others start coming down to check on them.  Steve wonders if they’ve set up a rotation, because over the course of the next two weeks he sees each member of the team in the studio at least once every day.
“Rogers, I’m secretly running this whole town.”
“I don’t believe that for a second.”
“Fantastic.”  Tony mumbles, tilting his wrist to swirl the ice in his glass.  “If you’re going to tell me how wonderful he was, I’d rather get a few more of these in me first.”
“Why didn’t you ever say anything? It’s not like you had competition, Buck, and you must’ve suspected…” Steve stops, not wanting to sound like he only fell for Bucky because no one else paid him the time of day. That’s not how it happened. He'd only ever had eyes for his best friend. “You were the one out on the town every night, I literally had no idea you even felt that way. I thought it was hopeless.”
Steve downs the last of his drink, gin burning his throat all the way down. He wipes his lips with the back of his hand and signals Nick for another.
Steve’s heart still jumps at seeing him.
“Ah ah ah, I’m a drunk, but I’m not a mean old one. I actually think I’m quite fun. Not to mention young and devastatingly handsome.”
It doesn’t matter that his mind is hazy; he’d recognize James Buchanan Barnes anywhere.
Captain America hasn’t changed that.  Steve Rogers is still the person that no one wants to get to know.  Almost no one.  He seeks Tony out, needing to get eyes on him, and finds him sitting on one of those overstuffed white couches and in animated conversation with a pretty brunette he recognizes from magazine covers at the newsstand.  Her perfectly manicured, elegant hand is resting on Tony’s forearm as they share a laugh.
Steve’s whole body is reacting to this sudden turn of events, his heart racing and his skin warm.  He’s achingly hard and he can’t bring himself to feel embarrassed.  Kissing Tony feels so right that he almost can’t believe they’ve never done this before.  The whole tangled mess between them just seems to fall loose, everything straightening out.
He’s a fool if there ever was one.
Tony shivers sympathetically and presses a kiss to Steve’s temple before snaking his left hand out to grab Steve’s nearly empty coffee mug. He backs away and goes to the coffee machine to re-fill it, so Steve will have something hot to wrap his hands around, and to prepare a cup of his own.
Tony’s already hard, and Steve’s vision swims as all of his blood rushes south in response, his body in a hurry to catch up. Tony’s lips are on his and he answers in kind, gasping into Tony’s mouth and his hands taking firm hold of Tony’s slim waist.
Unfortunately it’s a lot harder to make rent that way.
There’s a flicker of annoyance that ticks along Tony’s jaw.
It’s strange, because the Avengers have been a team without him for much longer than he was ever with them, but it still feels wrong whenever they leave him behind.  He itches for his suit of armor.
“You should just go talk to him.  You invited him here, after all.”  And there Bruce goes again.  Tony’s gonna have to figure out if there’s some facial tic that gives him away.  He’ll have to think about Steve in front a mirror or something and see exactly what’s going on up there.
“Think I’m more of a Lou Gehrig type,” Scott counters. “That’s beside the point. Which is – you’re supposed to be mentoring this kid, not me. I thought this was a gig, not a fucking episode of
Tony takes one of Steve’s hands and places it over his chest where the arc reactor used to be.  Steve loves Tony just a little more for it.
Away from the hubbub, the backlot is strangely empty. It’s odd to go from a bustling hive of action to desolate sidewalks, but it’s a good kind of odd, a soothing kind of odd. It makes him feel a world away. The architecture is turning from the Upper West Side into Brooklyn when Tony stumbles across someone else who must have also been seeking the solitude.
one of them.”
Against his back, Tony can feel Steve’s heartbeat, slow and steady, and he already knows he can’t go back from this.
“You’ll be interested to know, I can now put my legs behind my head…” Tony quirks an teasing eyebrow at Steve and smirks knowingly when he sees Steve’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallows hard.
“That’s how it is.” Sam replies. “And not to discourage you further from my sterling company, but is there any reason you’re over here and not over there?” He jerks his head over his shoulder toward their friends’ table. “
“Urgh.
“I’m in the middle of ‘Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me.’ Bring me a coffee back?”  Happy replies and Tony decides he has to give the guy another raise.  He always knows precisely when he’s needed and when he needs to leave well enough alone.
Steve doesn’t mean to be rude but he can’t help it.  He feels unmoored if he can’t find Tony in the crowd, cast away in a sea of unfamiliar faces smiling at him as if they’re all the best of friends.
To keep the undesirables from bothering me and all. Sorting through the riff-raff.” Tony waves his hand.
In the distance Steve can hear the music from the carousel, light and airy, drifting down the boardwalk.  Tony’s gaze ticks down to Steve’s lips, and for some reason that’s all it takes.
“I know one thing we could get up to.”  Steve runs a hand through Tony’s hair, and it feels more amazing than it has any right to.  Even so, Tony’s not fool enough to hope that the next thing out of Steve’s mouth will be a lewd suggestion.
He kills ex-KGB officials in their beds. He hunts HYDRA down. He tears their men to pieces and burns what’s left of their facilities. One head, much less two, cannot grow if there is no body.
“He’s here, god knows where. Dumbass thought we should split up.  What about Nat?”
Steve’s blue eyes are blown black with arousal and his usually pale lips are plush pink and kiss-swollen.  His cheeks are rosy and there’s a delicate sheen of sweat beading over his broad chest.  If Tony breathes deep he swears he can smell the heady scent of sex, and his fingers twitch as they hover over Steve’s zipper.
He loses track of himself until the world goes quiet around him.  He pries his eyes open, finds himself staring right at Steve.  Have Steve’s eyes always been so impossibly blue?  When the fuck did that happen?  He’s probably hallucinating.
“Phil?” Pepper asks Tony, immediately understanding where Tony is going with this.
“She is a real beaut.” Happy pats the dash like a proud father. “One of the perks of this job. Not that I need perks, mind you. Tony’s a great boss. Helluva guy.”
“I fucking love you too.” Steve does crack a small smile as he mimics Tony’s less-than-romantic phrasing. He’s so beautiful with his gaze downcast, his long, dark eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks and his plush, pink lips parted, that Tony has to kiss him again.
“I don’t know about that,” Steve averts his eyes, feeling his face heat.  “And we’re…we’re not together…exactly.”
He doesn't want to, but he has to let Steve go.
footage? You specifically asked –”
Crossing the lobby of Caesar’s Palace, Tony’s all charm and bright smiles for the staff he knows and the few people who recognize him, but the façade abruptly crashes the second he and Steve are alone in the elevator.
with a hand over Steve’s mouth, so worried that someone will hear. He remembers thinking that he'll never get out of the war alive, but Steve will, and that he is okay with that.
He knocks his knee against Steve’s, trying to lighten the mood, but Steve doesn’t smile. Tony sits up, abandoning the casual pretense, and cups Steve’s face to tilt it toward his.
He tugs on Steve’s hand, urging him to lean over and look.  Stark Tower is easy to spot, taller and brighter than nearly everything else in the skyline.  Only 1 WTC climbs higher, and even Tony doesn’t begrudge that.
“I have contingencies for nearly everything.  And I’m quite good at coming up with awesome shit on the fly, too.”  Tony grins, waving toward his arc reactor.
There’s a long pause, and Tony can only imagine what Bucky is saying. Pepper keeps her face carefully schooled, giving nothing away.
Steve’s gaze snaps toward Bucky and he finds his friend staring at him earnestly, blue eyes studying him.  Bucky abandons sarcasm and embraces sincerity even less than Tony, so Steve’s caught well off-guard.
. “It’s just my first in a very, very long time. I guess I had forgotten what it’s like.”
“Except I can, Bucky. I can. And it’s okay. This time is yours and Steve’s. Only yours. We’ll talk more when I get back—when we know exactly what it is we need to talk about.”
The stifling heat doesn’t seem to bother Tony in the slightest as he lets himself in, bouncing up the steps and into the small dressing room. While he’d left no fans running, Steve had at least remembered to pull the shades, so the dim room is not nearly as sweltering as he imagined. It’s still warm enough to make his head feel foggy.
“Suit up, Tony.”  Steve urges him away from the computer.
“If I had to guess.  But I don’t much like guessing.”  She replies as Clint steps aside to cover the ascending staircase; she kicks open the door and enters the hallway, both guns drawn.  “Clear. “
“Check in.”  Tony Stark’s a busy man – a busy man with much more important things to do than simply “check in” with someone like him.
“I only meant-“
"That's
, mind you—affair and then pick at me for being reasonable about your callous disregard?”
. Tony never thought he’d live to see the day. She just as quickly schools her face into its usual calm repose, but it’s too late, the jig is up.
“Maybe I had too much to drink after all.” He mumbles, his brow furrowing. Tony wants to take him in his arms and kiss that worry away. “I should probably…” He gestures inside.
The warmth of Frank Sinatra’s voice fills the space between them.
Steve strips off his work gloves and tosses them onto the table.
*******
“The tower’s ready.  All fixed up like brand new.”
And kissing Steve Rogers is
“Seriously!  What the hell can I do?  I’ve been sitting here running data and comparing timelines and using this incomplete bullshit rundown on the Red Room’s activities to try and figure out
“Tony…” Bruce is getting up and walking toward Tony, likes he’s concerned Tony’s the one who is going to Hulk out and destroy the room.  Tony shakes Bruce away.
“Hill’s already routed someone to give us a lift.”
"Are you saying I look old otherwise?" Tony asks and Steve rolls his eyes, giving Tony a small shove as they continue their meandering walk through and around the square.
“What?”
“Television is an up and coming –”
. He’s
Steve nods, feeling strange to tell Bucky this before he’s even said a word to Tony.
“You’re the one who designed her, I’m only the pilot. A faulty landing mechanism would be all on you.”
Tony’s floor now, and Steve invited him up, it never feels right to be here when Tony is too. Maybe it’s because Tony has never done the inviting, or that he and Tony have never been alone here without Steve, but whenever Tony arrives, Bucky instantly feels like an intruder in their private space.
“I don’t mean that to be nasty, Tony, you have to believe me, I just…I can’t do
“Fast?” Tony supplies quickly, perhaps betraying his own apprehension.   He’d honestly been expecting Steve to put on the brakes long before this, so he steels himself to stop, drawing on his shallow well of self-control.
“Not Barnes?”
dining nightly with Van Dyne or making off with Maximoff to get married in Mexico?” Sam grins. “Stark has gotta be paying Laufeyson a small fortune to drum up heat for this movie – you’d think you’re Clark Gable for how much ink you’re getting.”
“How much would it bother
“Let’s walk.” Tony thumbs over his shoulder, already three steps down the path.  “I’m getting unpleasantly moist out here in the wide open.” Raindrops are sending ripples pitter-patter over the surface of the conservatory water now.  Steve hadn’t really noticed but now he sees that Tony’s gray suit coat and pale purple shirt are spotted, his artfully styled hair damp.
Bucky purses his lips, his gaze still judgmental. He doesn’t say anything to dispel the tension, instead waiting for Steve to continue.
“Can’t.  I got a thing.”
Tony considers getting back on the elevator, because it’s not too late to turn back, but he manages to stay still.  He doesn’t know if he deserves this, doesn’t know if he’ll be able to keep it, but if he can be with Steve even once he has to do it.  He can’t go on imagining what it could be if only he
He grins to himself as he spots Tony’s fixed gear bike locked haphazardly to a lamp post, despite the fact that there’s a fully functional bike rack not twenty feet away in front of the restaurant.  One day Tony’s not going to slide by with a mere ticket and he’s going to come back to find his lock cut and his bike impounded.
He catches Steve’s eye over Pepper’s shoulder, gives him a wink.  Steve smiles softly and then looks away.  He doesn’t look back.
In the pause, Tony tries to get ahold of himself and say something reasonable, like how they should clearly stop. His hands are on Steve’s ass, and he slowly draws his palms up and over the sharp cut of his hips, pressing Steve back a little to put space between them.
“Pepper?”
“It doesn't matter, there's nothing much to tell. Not anymore. It's over between us.”
“I didn’t pin the note to Steve. It’s not as if I sent him down to Bucky’s room with a sign that read
Tony Stark in a Motel 6 – what is the world coming to?  If only he’d caught up with Steve somewhere near a decent Omni.
Steve jerks back awake, snapping toward the sound of someone’s amused voice.
“I don’t know. Let me down easy?” Bucky replies, though it’s obvious he doesn’t fully believe that. “You love Tony.”
“Sir, it’s fine,” Steve assures him, just glad that they’re not being recognized as the ones who took part in the destruction.
“Thor?”
Why now? Why me? Why do this at all? Tony doesn’t know what Bucky has to gain from bringing him in, why he didn’t tell Steve in advance that he’d be doing so, or what he thinks is going to happen now. Steve’s everything to Bucky, and why would he risk everything on this?
“I’m sorry, of the two of us here, which one has been in love with Danvers since ’44 and hasn’t done a damn thing about it?”
He’s barefoot, clad only in his white boxers and undershirt. His brown hair is in desperate need of a comb and his prosthetic arm is already off for the night. He still manages to seem threatening.
Steve's body is still wet and open when he sinks down on Tony’s length, resting his weight on Tony completely in order to feel him reaching deep inside.
Natasha turns on her heel and walks down the hall toward the kitchen.
“All right…” None of this seems like it would lead to this evening, to Tony’s strange request.
“I should go...Bucky – my roommate – he’s probably worried about me. I don’t usually stay out all night.” Steve finishes buttoning up his shirt and glances at Tony. Tony shrugs, and his nonchalance causes Steve to hesitate. It’s not like he wanted Tony to beg him to stay, but maybe he’d hoped the man would at least want him to.
“All right, that’s enough,” Steve interrupts the back-and-forth, knowing from previous experience that it can only get more coarse from there and not really in the mood to hear it. He backs up until he’s standing alongside Gabe as well, giving himself some space to survey their work. “Seems fine. Did Monty get final word on the color choice?”
Pulling his handkerchief from his breast pocket, Tony unfastens his trousers and pulls his hard length out with a sigh of relief. He doesn’t bother to get up and lock the door. It only takes a couple of rough pulls and the thought of Steve’s lips sucking at his tip, blond head bobbing between his thighs; Tony comes quickly and quietly, one surprised gasp pushing past his lips, and the heavy load caught carefully in the red square of silk covering his other hand.
“But I-“
“Being your friend has always been the best move I ever made.”
“What I should have asked but was always too chicken shit to say, was: were you in love with Bucky?”
“I won’t.” Tony assures him, but then surprises him by continuing, “Maybe you should.”
“Okay, then go clean yourself up, wipe off the flop sweat, and call Steve, would you? I’m sure he’s working himself up real good too, if you’ve been avoiding him all afternoon.”
Tony is standing a few paces from the restaurant.  His noise cancelling headphones are looped, unused, around his neck, but he’s still just as oblivious to the people loitering around him as he fiddles with his smart phone.  Steve ambles toward him, taking the moment to just appreciate his boyfriend.
Tony’s walking over before he has time to think about what he’s doing.
“They say running is bad for the knees.  You’ve missed it, being frozen and all, but doctors now suggest participating in more low-impact exercise.  Like yoga.  Or water aerobics.”
Steve seems set off-kilter by that, like he can’t imagine Tony saying anything good to Pepper about him.
“Guess you weren’t quite ready for that yet.”  Tony’s grin is careful and strained.  He claps his hands, shaking his head like it’s no big deal.  “That’s okay, we’ll work up to it.”
“So that’s how it is. You’re leaving me to play messenger?”
on him, and he’s been doing it with regularity ever since.
“When I saw how late it was, I panicked and hopped in the car and came right over, I wasn’t thinking all that clearly. I guess I hoped you’d still be up.”
He’s feeling pretty good about his decision to bring Steve here until they get inside and the crush of the crowd closes in on him.  He’s avoided places like this – most places like
No matter if Steve happened to love Bucky too.
“Something’s off with the shutter speed, I’m trying to figure out what it is without gutting the entire thing and rebuilding it.”
He certainly has it easier – he doesn’t have to walk in heels, after all – but even so the panic is setting in.
“Kiss,” Steve says tiredly, lifting his head and looking at Tony like he should already know this.
“This one’s pretty self-explanatory.”  He runs a hand over the intricately carved backs of each of the ten chairs lining this side of the long, mahogany table as he crosses the length of the room toward the library.  “And here in the library-cum-lounge, we should also find someone you folks already know.”
“And how do you know what I want, Tony?”
Clint finds Fury pinned underneath a comm unit and Natasha hurriedly helps him lift it.  He’s barely conscious and his leg is clearly broken.  His eye patch has been ripped off, revealing his scarred eye socket.  Barnes lays a few feet away, unmoving.  Clint slaps Fury’s cheeks, trying to get him to stir.
Tony gives him a look, one that says he knows more than Bucky suspects, but doesn’t say anything aloud.
“Well, I brought the wrong person to Vegas, clearly,” Tony comments.  Steve starts to get up, figuring that they should go if Tony’s not enjoying the concert, but Tony pulls him back to his seat.  “No, no, sit down, you big lug.  I think she’s about to wail out that song from
“Just…make sure you’re not turning things down for the wrong reasons, okay? You can handle whatever comes your way, and you deserve to be successful. Your past is nothing to run from. You should be proud of what you’ve done.”
of that was her fault; she was an innocent bystander.  But that doesn’t change the fact that she knows all the research, all the data, backward and forward.  She’s one of the few people outside SHIELD who has any fundamental understanding of how, theoretically, the super serum is supposed to work, and how gamma radiation functions.”
“Well I don’t know about that,” Tony mumbles underneath the beeping of settings being adjusted.  The belt slowly starts to move under Tony’s feet and Steve rolls his eyes.  So many of these newfangled machines are ridiculous.  The point of running is to get somewhere, or at the very least
He reaches back blindly and his fingers brush Steve’s. The touch is light, almost enough to be passed off as accidental.
“Excuse me, Chase, have you seen Mr. Stark?” Steve stops him, regretting it immediately when he sees the kid’s panic-stricken, exhausted face.
—hit the brakes,” Rhodey puts his free hand up in warning.
“That’s the third one this week, Barnes,” Stark comments, pulling his attention away from doting on Steve long enough to notice what’s going on in the rest of the kitchen.  “If you don’t like the pattern, there are other ways to channel your inner Martha Stewart.”
As opening lines go, it’s not a great one. Belatedly it occurs to him that he’s insulted this utter perfection before him, but he’d gone with it and now it’s too late to take it back. So he commits.
"Where is what?" Steve asked. He sucked with technology, so he felt helpless just standing there.
"What if I'm wrong, and Bruce really is gone?" Tony asked, his voice shaking. Steve could see the tears in Tony's eyes that he was trying to hold back, the lump in his throat that was preventing him from sobbing
"Oh, this is Steve Rogers," Natasha responded, "he's new."
Tony rubbed the back of his head. "I'm not completely sure. All I know is that you're alive. And I'm pretty fucking grateful for that. I can't go losing my best friend and my chemistry grade all in the same weekend. Maybe later you can die, but not yet."
"If you
"So," Tony said, making it awkward. The awkwardness just escalated when Howard came and leaned against the wall behind Steve and Tony, watching Clint and Bruce. Tony shrugged off Steve's hand instinctively, what with his father being so close to them.
Tony shrugged, coming over to help move the bike. "I guess, yeah. It'll make a nice lawn ornament."
"Oh my god," Steve dropped to the floor, "I am so sorry! I-"
Tony grinned at the flustered Rogers below him, and slid his hand onto Steve's thigh.
"When we were fighting Bruce's rage monster, you looked like you completely knew what you were doing, like it was all just the same to you. You looked so... at peace with yourself, which is probably completely the wrong word to use."
"Tony!" Steve gasped, stumbling backwards, balancing himself by hitting the control panel with both hands.
"He can pack one hell of a punch." Steve glanced at the punched in table, and let out a nervous laugh. Tony kept quiet.
in chemistry or gym?"
Steve shook his head in a terse nod and ran over to greet Natasha and Clint.
Before completely fading out, Steve saw the Hulk sit back down in his corner, the breathing slowing, and his eyes closing gently.
"Oh," Steve grinned, "Tony Stark. He said he'd help me with science, and with decking out Bells, and-"
"Do you doubt the strength of the safe-rooms in Stark Industries?" Tony asked, pretending to be insulted. "My dad has these rooms with radiation exactly like Gamma for specific reasons, so he's had them radiation-proof, shatter-proof, basically break-in proof. It's like military-grade steel turned glass. Pretty cool stuff."
Finally, the end of the day rolled around. Steve sped home on Bells. He emptied his backpack of everything but chemistry books and the necessary rations: cans of coke, chips, popcorn... He was set.
"What the fuck were you doing in here?" Clint shouted, and Bruce turned around, slightly coming out of his fetal position.
"Steve Rogers," he finished, pulling at his collar on his shirt (which, though unbuttoned, felt like it was choking him), and headed to the back of the classroom to sit down.
Steve pushed him off jokingly. "Nah. You know I can't talk to girls."
Coulson has every right to be fawning over his "nephew," even if that means begging for details on his first day.
"Why do you immediately look at me for a solution?" Steve asked, throwing his hands in the air defensively.
"Well," mid-sentence, Steve let out a long, drawn-out yawn, "I think I'm going to call this a day. Good night, Uncle. Thanks for dealing with my new school shock syndrome."
Suddenly, the little red lights all over the control room turned on, rotating to alert the experimenters of a change in plans.
girlfriend, "you said you wanted to show me your moves?"
Coulson laughed and walked off. "I'll be placing bets on how long it takes you to get a date."
"I guess the gamma must've..." Steve was trying to describe what they saw, but he simply couldn't.
Tony put his hand on Bruce's shoulder. "I'm glad you're coming to terms," he muttered.
"Huh," Clint breathed, sounding impressed. He turned, launching 5 arrows into the bulls-eye of the furthest target within thirty seconds, and nodded. "I guess it's time to go give Natasha some attention, yeah?"
Natasha stretched out her leg skillfully to the row of yellow blotches, but Steve and Tony were a different story.
"I'm gonna just," Steve started dragging the motorcycle across the drive, "keep my baby here. That ok?"
"The one I'm looking at in particular," Bruce continued, "is pretty close to both physics and medical science. For a while now, I've wanted to see the impact of Gamma radiation on living organisms. Because, I mean, we use X-Rays on people to get a good look on bones, and UV radiation to dry nails faster, and everything else, so why not Gamma?"
"I'll go help him," Steve sighed, pushing himself up and following Clint down to the labs.
Tony walked over to the smear on the wall, and started rubbing the back of his neck. "Oh, hey. Looks like the rats did explode. Cool."
So, Steve tucked the phone into the single pocket on his shorts and closed his eyes, taking in a huge breath. He only had to channel a little bit of energy into his super soldier self. When he re-awoke, he was a raging fire. He lunged at Clint, who immediately rolled out his way, over about 10 feet, and skillfully launched an arrow right at Steve's head. In response, Steve grabbed the piece of fiberglass that was holding the bow and arrows Clint now had, holding it up like a shield.
"Alright, kids," the gym teacher boomed, "we have a new student. Everyone say hi to Mr. Steve Rogers."
The prideful voice turned around. Well-kept and goateed, the kid looked like he belonged in a college class. "Hey, kid," he started, "I'm Tony Stark. Nice to meet you."
When he was far enough away from him, Howard pulled a fragile test tube out of his coat pocket. "Hey, Rogers!" He hollered, Steve picking up his head automatically like a good-old-fashioned soldier would at his name. "Think fast!" Howard launched the test tube in Steve's direction, but about five feet off.
"What? Don't look at me like that," Clint glared right back at them, "I was planning on going to practice a bit at the range later." He left, returning through the front door with a large bow and a quiver of high-quality arrows already on his back. He swung the lab door open and bolted down the stairs.
The group finds something to do while they pass the time waiting for their green friend to wake up in his original skin.
But, now that Steve had been a student at this school for more than a month, it finally felt like things were falling into place, particularly when he started a big extra credit project with Bruce and Tony.
"That," Bruce pointed, "is where the gamma is going to come out of. The rats are going to be on the table."
"What the fuck is that?" Tony shouted.
"Whatever," Natasha said as she started to walk toward the rock climbing wall, "I'll be over here doing something useful."
Steve held out his hand in opposition. "Yeah, yeah, I got it. You don't have to tell me all the details."
"Not sure," was the response, "but you could top that bike, if that's what you're worried about."
"No, he's right," Bruce's voice came from the doorway. He was wearing his very stretched out pair of... shorts now, with Clint's jacket draped over the top of him again, "we need to do it again. I won't be involved. But we have to do it again... at least, you do."
"What if you're right, and Bruce is the big green thing we saw, that threw you across the room and-" Steve cut off suddenly. "The room is basically clear," he whispered, "and look."
He grabbed the table, and, with the advantage of the activated super soldier serum coursing through his veins, turned the legs in, making it a shield.
"Oh, god-" Steve turned around and Tony rushed to his side to see what changes the control panel had initiated.
"Are you seriously going to sit here and talk about what does and doesn't constitute as blood and guts," Bruce asked, getting annoyed, "or can we actually do this?"
Clint came into the conversation. "It's not that we think you can as much as it is that..." he started backing away, taking his jacket with him, "that we know you need to try."
Clint snapped his fingers in front of Steve's face. "Hey, captain drift-off, mind giving me the holder for this bow? Isn't exactly mine, y'know."
Steve just turned red and fell to the ground. "Sometimes I wonder if all those girls you get caught kissing in the janitor's closet are just an act..."
That was what his only goal was, for now. To fit in. And that was going to be difficult in itself.
"Y'know," he muttered to Steve, "I'm not a huge chemist, either. I'm much more into physics. But I can
There was nothing. Nothing but the big shape, towering ominously over what seemed like a small lab now.
"An experiment program? You've got to tell me more about it," Howard almost shouted in Steve's face, standing directly in front of the young soldier.
Tony continually glanced back, checking to see the reaction on Steve's face at the long and confusing lecture on how various chemicals balanced out others, and other random chemistry facts. When Steve got too confused, Tony slyly got up and shifted to the empty seat at Steve's lab table.
Steve punched Tony in the arm. Hard. "That's my pride and joy you're talking about, Stark."
Steve and Tony ran out to the entrance to the lab room, Tony shoving his key into the lock.
"...but I called dibs," Tony muttered under his breath.
But nothing could have prepared him for when he pulled up to the Stark Mansion.

"No, no," Coulson made a forward spinning motion with his hand, shaking his head, "the other one."
"...a green rage monster," Natasha finished, her voice eerily calm among the calamity of the current events.
to help you."
"Wait, she's
"Hey, Clint," she responded, kissing the guy on the cheek.
It didn't help that the dynamic duo of Bruce Banner and Tony Stark weren't in any of the rest of Steve's classes The time allotted to pass from class to class was the only highlight, where Steve could greet Natasha and Clint and maybe, if he was walking through the science hall, see Tony and Bruce.
“Huh.”
“Oh good, you’re up.”
“Tony.”  Steve leans back in the too-small booth, crossing his arms over his chest.  Tony tries his coffee again, finding it now too sweet.
“You know I always will, right?” Tony asks, coming closer. He’s bundled up against the wintry breeze, dark pea coat and bright red scarf. He shoves his bare hands in his pockets. He looks warm. Bucky isn’t even wearing a jacket, only a black hoodie. “If he stays like this, without the serum…nothing changes. Not the way I feel about him, anyway.”
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve murmurs, drawing his head back slightly.  He smiles, really meaning it.  Tony’s returning smile seems a little broken, and he visibly swallows before responding.
His distraction must be painfully obvious.  Anyone giving him half a moment’s notice would have to conclude that he’s either enamored of or obsessed with Tony Stark, or both.
“Only weird if we let it be.” He replies with a slight shrug. Steve shoots him another look. It’s not that simple, even if Tony believes it. “Here, let me guess: then he jumped you?” Tony theorizes as Steve waffles. “I mean, that’s what he said he was going to do.”
The thought of a computer having to handle the shower for him is too ridiculous.  He doesn’t know how this became his life.  He still remembers growing up when functioning indoor plumbing with hot water was a downright coup.
Don’t you know that?  Sometimes I wonder what it could be like if I just…got over myself and we could be together, the way we never imagined we could be –”
“Sort of. Sometimes. How about you, you got a guy?”
Steve’s jaw tightens in that way it used to when he’d stubbornly refuse Bucky’s help, when he wanted to put up a tough front and prove he could stand up for himself. While he’d seen righteous indignation and staunch determination on Steve’s decidedly more broad and chiseled face in recent years, it’s been ages since he’s seen this particular petulant, defiant edge to Steve’s expression and it makes Bucky’s heart hurt even more.
Steve startles as Bucky snorts beside him, shaking his head at the sight below. Steve hadn’t realized he came outside. Bucky takes a drag from his cigarette and taps the ash in Tony’s direction, frowning.
“I thought she was attached to Reed Richards,” Wanda murmurs beside him with an air of judgment lacing her tone. “I thought they were
scandal, dating you would be a
Tony and Jane exchange airy, fake kisses to both cheeks and then Tony deposits himself on the loveseat that lines the far side of Jan's fitting room. He spreads out lazily as if he has every right to the space.
“I know, gross over-simplification of a far more complex matter, you’re Shrek, you’re a big green monster of an onion, you’ve got layers.” Tony waves Bruce off, wondering how long it will take Bruce to realize that when he says he gets it, he really does
He climbs two steps up toward Bucky and Steve but stops when Steve glances away, his eyes seeking Nat and Jan as they cross the street to Jan’s bungalow. The low-key glow from the pendant streetlamp illuminates the side of his face and for the first time, Tony can see the tension in the set of his jaw.
It’s a particular Stark talent, one that occasionally makes an appearance on the business side but shines brightly and often when it comes to personal matters.
“All the better.” Bucky locates three wine glasses, all mismatched, and sets them on the table in front of Jan before setting to work with the corkscrew. Jan watches him work one-handed with a spark of interest, her eyes following him keenly.
“Well, that’s my job too.”
follow that up with a lewd come-on of sorts. When Natasha had told him that he would need a daringly bold woman, he thinks she may have conjured Darcy into existence.
He reaches out, fumbling for the feeling of Bucky beside him. Expecting to find a shoulder, an arm, instead he finds the other man’s thigh.
Old lovers reuniting and all that.
“I don’t think even Queens will have us now,” Steve breaks the silence, his voice used, throat raw.  Tony lifts his head, rests his chin on Steve’s shoulder to look at him inquisitively.
“Compared to what?”  Pepper replies without missing a beat, turning around to face Tony.  Tony takes her champagne, polishes it off.
“Dum Dum, that was Barnes who sent her your way. And you were so drunk, you didn’t notice until she took you up to her room.”
“Fuck me,” Steve whispers, the words giving him a thrill, and pulls Bucky back down to him as Bucky starts to move, shallowly at first. Their foreheads rest together and their lips brush in promise of a kiss that doesn’t come, both of them too overwhelmed to do anything but share breath and stare into one another’s eyes.
“I thought you were supposed to be some genius.”  Barnes gets in his face.  Tony’s startled but tries not to back up, pulling his head back slightly but planting his feet.  “Steve and I are
“Is it the war?” Sam asks, bluntly. “You know more than most that sometimes this shit just comes back and bites you without rhyme or reason, Steve. Bucky’s been doing good for a long while now but that don’t mean he’s always gonna be good. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.”
“Bucky…what are you doing here?” Steve’s voice cracks and he moves back from Tony.  He wipes his lips and adjusts the waistline of his jeans, trying to make his erection less noticeable.  It doesn’t work.
While Steve’s only verging on tipsy, Bucky and Jan are three sheets to the wind, having moved on to hard liquor after the wine was all gone.
“I want to fuck you so badly right now,” he says, voice rough. “All I want is to climb inside you and stay there.” Tony pushes a sticky finger past Steve’s lips; Steve’s not sure who he’s tasting, himself or Tony. It really doesn’t matter. “Fuck you’re gorgeous.”
“But-“
Steve tilts his hips up just a little, and squeezes around Bucky’s length experimentally. He’s in so deep, and he feels so good. The sensation is more intense than he was prepared for, and he swears he can feel the throb of Bucky’s heartbeat echoing throughout his entire body.
“Whatever works, JARV,” Tony replies, waving him off to work freely.
“But…?”
“You swear a lot more too.”  Tony’s mouth twitches a little, like he’s fighting a smile, and Steve’s really had it.  He moves to get up but Tony moves too.  He puts a hand on Steve’s bicep and tugs him back.  His touch is warm against Steve’s damp skin. “Hey, c’mon.  I like it.”
"Shouting ‘Irrrrrrrrrrrrr-viiiiiiiiing!’ at the top of her lungs--" Bucky joins in, remembering the shrill call so clearly.
all the time if Bucky and Natasha would finally settle in for the long haul, if he could love someone like Jan. It would be so straightforward. Simple.
“I didn’t even know Howard
The moonlight is bright enough to highlight the tops of the pine trees, to break the mountains from the sky along the horizon.  He can see the stars and he wants to go outside and look up, name all the ones he knows.  At the orphanage, sometimes he and Bucky would sneak out onto the roof and Buck would ask him to point out the constellations.

But Bucky hadn’t been there when they’d liberated the camps. Bucky had been in a hospital in London and he didn’t know, he didn’t
“That thing we haven’t been talking about for the past month.   That Steve-shaped thing that just got on his motorcycle and went back to Brooklyn.”
“We’d agreed that we were dropping playboy from that string of epithets, didn’t we? I remember having that conversation. ‘Pepper, I need to focus on the work. Pepper, I need to be taken seriously. Pepper’–”
“What’s wrong with this one?” Maria inquires, her voice as sharp as the jab of her pen as she strikes out another name on her notepad.
“Thank you for the sandwich.”  Steve pulls the food toward him by the wrapper and digs in.
“I’m fine,” Steve tries to sound reassuring. “I just…I had a bad night last night, that’s all. Didn’t get much sleep. You know how that goes.”
“The movie. You should take it.”
up there?”
“Well,
“I know General Eisenhower.”
“You didn’t walk very far,” Steve observes and Tony has to give it to him for calling it like he sees it.  “You do everything short of suiting up.”
“Stark…” Steve sighs, re-adjusting the tape on his hands to give his brain something else to focus on instead of how difficult Tony can be.  As a tactic, it fails.  “Why do you insist on saying things you

somehow and I’m having trouble putting it back. But I will. I always do.”
“As long as it’s not an omelette," she replies.
Or that she and Bucky had started this up once again.
“I’m going to see Fury,” he announces, scooping up all his work from each screen and depositing it all into a file folder to take to the SHIELD helicarrier.  He runs a quick encryption on it and puts it on a portable drive.  He could certainly access it directly from SHIELD but he doesn’t want any avenues open to his network, doesn’t want any SHIELD agent poking their nose into his business.  He doesn’t doubt his paranoia is warranted.  Stupid assholes, letting Barnes come in like that, how could they not have
than a kiss. It’s already leading somewhere, promising something. They tilt and shift to get deeper, mouths open, tongues sliding. Steve’s feeling too warm, his heart thudding out of time in his chest.
Steve thanks Happy for the ride, opting to walk the short, stone driveway up to the arched doorway. The lobby is small, and despite the large windows, it is rather dark now that the sun has dipped below the hills. It’s not uninviting however, as the table lamps are all shaded with golden yellow glass or beige linen, throwing pockets of warm light over richly upholstered chairs and dark cherry wood tables.
“Hey, you beat everyone else here?” Steve asks as Tony grabs the bottom hem of his hoodie and pulls him forward hips first, before reaching up to tuck his other hand into the navy blue scarf looped loosely around Steve’s neck.  Steve goes easily, leaning in to Tony’s kiss.  He tastes like clove cigarettes, a habit Steve has pleaded with him to break.  Steve opts not to say anything about it now.
, not when –
“Comrades!”  Thor’s booming voice cuts through Steve’s thoughts on Natasha being a Blockhead.  A moment later Thor’s huge hand claps him on the shoulder, hard enough to make him wince.
“I’ve been ridiculous and I’ve been defensive on separate occasions, but never both at the same time. I feel this is an accomplishment,” Tony jokes sardonically, tilting his chin up slightly as if he’s proud.
“The candles.  For the jack o’ lanterns.  Where are they?”
Rhodey pats the plane like it’s a good dog.
“Like…this?” Tony lowers his mouth to his, lips parting softly. “Or, like this?” Tony’s words brush against his lips and then Tony kisses him harder, filthier, his tongue sliding deep.
“That was about to get good, I resent that.” Tony, petulant, points at the wall.  Natasha’s face is carefully schooled into blankness; if she hadn’t taken out her feelings on the button, he might not have thought she was invested in the outcome of today’s proceedings at all.
“Thought I’d take a longer route today.  What’s wrong?”  Steve doesn’t dally, quickly closing the space left between them.  It’s obvious Tony, dressed in a sharp suit and Italian loafers, isn’t here to join him on his run.
He hurries on without a reply, clearly having a laundry list of things to still accomplish before his night is over.
“What the…” Tony starts, eyes widening.  Instantly curious, Steve turns to actually look up at Thor.  A red bandana is wrapped around his head like a sweatband and his look is overall more lumberjack than usual, given that it looks like he hasn’t shaved in over a week.  Which may not seem that bad except that it seems like Thor can grow a full beard in a single afternoon.
