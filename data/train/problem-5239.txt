“Tony. Look at me,” Steve interrupted, attempting a comforting smile when worried brown eyes flickered over, “Are you sure this is what you want to do, sweetheart?”
Tony felt the familiar trickle of anxiety at the mention of the Hulk, but he outwardly pouted more, growling at Steve’s amused smile.
He grinned and leaned down, blowing a raspberry against the babe’s cheek. He squealed loudly and tried to wriggle out of his blanket, only to have Steve scoop him up so they both could kiss his cheeks. PJ squealed even louder, laughing as he managed to get his arms out to he could push his small hands against their faces.
“Steve’s health had gotten to a point that it was either sign up for shady experimental testing or die,” Bucky said, pretending to not see Steve’s face twist up and look away, “I wouldn’t let him do that shit
Those worries were all superficial compared to the fear of the nightmare that was to come. Eventually, they would all have to fight Stark’s army, come hell or high water, and Steve knew that he was going to have to lead his men into battle whether or not Tony approved. There was more on the line than just Tony and Peter; the fate of the colony was at stake, and if he was forced to choose who to save, he knew what he would have to do, even if it killed him.
“Hey, it’s done. He’s not taking any more,” He murmured quietly, rubbing PJ’s arm, “You can take your arm back, sweetheart.”
Thor hurriedly translated and Steve nodded, scooting closer to them. He wrapped an arm around Tony and supported the arm that was holding Peter, using Tony as a little marionette so he could position Peter right to drink from the wineskin. It took a little finagling, but after a moment, he could properly tip the wineskin down. Peter drank from it, only to thrash his arms about and wail louder, causing fat tears to roll down his plump cheeks.
“Yes, pumpkin pie?” Tony asked, only to have PJ’s stomach growl in the middle of his sentence, “…Oh. Yeah. Okay. J? Could you—damn it—could you ask Steve to bring down an overnight bag for PJ and food for him?”
“That’s it. I have to touch to get this shirt off, then we’ll start with bottoms, okay?” Tony instructed, “You’re safe, honeybunches.”
“Brooklyn in the forties will always be my original flesh and blood,” Steve continued, reaching up to brush away an unusually stray lock of hair from Tony’s forehead, “But the new body needs a new place to thrive, and it’s here, with you, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
“Hey, darling, I know you need attention, but you are hurting me a little bit here,” Tony gritted out.
He burst into laughter, only to gasp and put his hand over his mouth when Tony whirled around and glared at him.
“It’s still disgusting and if you keep doing it, Natasha will skin you,” he said, still grinning despite the other’s pout.
He nodded, and Thor stepped aside, revealing the Prime to him, slouched in his throne with his head on his fist. Tony paused and took the man in, hoping that his eyes were not as wide as dinner plates. He was smaller than Thor but broader, so well-defined in the upper body that his skin looked like it might tear. Unlike the other Alphas, he wore only a short leather kilt and boots, most likely traditional for his position. Red, white, and blue paint swirled on all of his available skin, creating intricate patterns that made Tony wonder if it was a language or merely a design. His hair was shaved on the sides, save for two small braids brought back around his head to meet with the large top braid. The whole thing was twisted together and hung over his shoulder. Strips of cloth and various hanging ornaments were intertwined with the hair: small trophies of the conquered, no doubt. He was undeniably handsome, and with a stroke of his carefully groomed beard, motioned to Tony to begin.
The animalistic feelings were too thick to pry open. In an attempt to soothe them, Tony tried to picture calming things, like summer walks on the beach and laying in bed long after the sunrise. Peter’s weight on his chest brought forth vivid images of the babe sleeping on him and cuddling up to him, so Tony concentrated on those and hoped that Steve could feel him.
“Okay. You’ll be okay, sweetheart, I’ve got you,” Tony promised, “And if—y’know, since you have sensitive nipples anyway, if you get hard, that’s okay. I’ll take care of you after, too. Alright?”
“I wasn’t sure what you’d like, so I went with Black Widow,” Tony explained, grinning at the boy’s wide eyes, “That’s Nat. She looks pretty cool on a shirt, yeah?”
and vanilla these days, but you tried to take me for a ride, yeah?” Tony babbled, suddenly very aware of the silence in the room, “Where did you even learn to
He switched to the native tongue and snapped at the Prime, then sighed, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Clint is almost always down here crafting arrows or throwing knives for Natasha, Barnes tempers any new weaponry we recover from battle, and Sam, our falconer, makes tracking bracelets for his fleet,” Bruce explained, “We have many people who work in here, usually all at the same time.”
Steve looked around lazily, and upon seeing that no one else was in the room beside them four, shrugged. He settled his head back down onto Tony’s shoulder, wriggling slightly until he found the most comfortable position. He cooed at Peter and reached over to rub his tummy as a warm smile slowly spread across his face.
“We can have fun once we’re home. I promise. Here—if you’re even feeling well on the plane, we can torture James squared with another entry into the Mile-High Club,” Steve compromised, “Okay? I just—I want to lay here with you and hold you for a while. I really thought I lost you, Tony.
“I don’t know,” Steve admitted, “I think he’ll have to, eventually. God, he’s going to hate having to go back to therapy and through routine doctor’s visits again.”
“Okay, okay, it’s okay, Steve. See? His vitals are good, everything is okay,” Bucky said quickly, putting his hands on Steve’s chest and shoulder, “Just a minute, then we—”
. Watching you fall out of the sky for the second time and ending up in the hospital when I should have been to there to prevent it, or at least catch you—”
“See, he looks funny. You just look cute,” Steve said under his breath, turning to give Tony a shy smile.
The room shook as a loud explosion went off outside. Shouting and the clanging of swords froze them in place until a loud trumpet broke the stupor. Natasha moved first, pocketing her knife as she ran to look through the doorway.
Once the cup was put back down and wasn’t in danger of being spilled, Steve leaned in to carefully draw Tony into his arms, burying his face in the other man’s neck. He sniffled and pressed a soft kiss to his skin, only starting to settle when he felt Tony’s hands move to his hair and back.
be right there to help you and love you, Tones. Nothing could ever break that. When we got married, I made a promise in that little clerk’s office to love you, in sickness and in health, through the good and the bad…”
Fall turned to Winter to Spring; the leaves changed and fell and grew back on their branches, turning the once brown and barren landscape into a field of green. Flowers bloomed on every shrub and bush and painted color back onto the castle grounds. Time passed, and with it brought growth. Peter was nearly one now, and though he was still a small little thing he had become quite the toddler. He had acquired a head full of the soft brown curls of his father alongside his laugh, disguised as a tiny giggle. A few teeth had begun to fill in his smile, but that had only caused a lot of long nights of pained whimpers from both him and Tony. That, and he found his voice early, babbling a constant stream of nonsensical noises. Tony could not help but hold ‘conversations’ with him, hopeful that his encouragement would coax out a few real words.
Tony would never admit to thinking his next thoughts, but he couldn’t help thanking the universe that AIM managed to power down the suit (for thirty seconds) so that he could see the sight in front of him. He leaned against the very expensive gym walls next to an uncomfortable looking Bruce, watching Steve and Thor wrestling, arms out and ready, heads down.
Everhart wasn’t deterred, rather repeating with a quirked eyebrow, “Do you plan on helping with the destruction caused or just throwing some money around and walking away?”
“Uh, yeah, I’ll go call the place, get our usual order then,” he said, retreating with his head down.
“We, uh, I-” he cut himself off, caught Rhodey’s gaze and jumped up from the couch. “Breakfast! Are there still eggs? Did Thor eat them all?”
“I’ll bring you all the flowers you want. And I already have a reservation, but at that little Greek place you love so much,” Steve said.
“Sure J, let him in,” Tony said, spreading his arms out and prepared to pretend. Steve walked in, and Tony’s eyes got stuck on the bright red roses clutched in his hand for a few seconds before taking in the rest of him. He was in a navy blue dress suit, white under shirt and grayish blue tie. His hair was styled similarly to how it was yesterday, and Tony forced his smile even wider. “Cap! Who’s the lucky lady?”
So how could he be blamed, being as tired as he was after practically being awake for two days, having to listen to Fury’s endless droning, and then being out on the streets with his team, that some paparazzi managed to catch him zoning out? How could he be blamed that in his spaced out mind, his line of sight happened to be trained on one specific thing? How could he be blamed that that one specific thing happened to be Steve’s ass?
“No…” Tony breathed. “Pep, Pepper, love of my life. You have to take this down, Steve can’t see- Oh God, Steve!” Tony was nearly in full on panic mode. “JARVIS! Put the tower in lock down mode, lock Steve in his room, do NOT let him watch the news!”
“I did tell you that you should say something to him,” Pepper supplied, earning herself a glare from Tony which she brushed off.
Steve had a tendency to wear tight shirts as it was, but the fitted Under Armour tee was absolutely straining against Steve bulging biceps and pecs. Tony could count each of his abs through the light weight material, plastered to his skin by sweat. This must have been what the Renaissance sculptors used as inspiration when making those masterpieces. Hell, Michelangelo’s David had nothing on
He loves how well Tony can read him, of course he does, but sometimes it does work against him. It’s both endearing and infuriating.
When Clint had mentioned playing Spin the Bottle, Steve found himself automatically seeking Tony’s gaze, wondering what it would be like if he agreed to play, if his spin landed on Tony and they kissed. If Tony would be nervous, or if he would be brazen about it, stealing a kiss off Steve’s lips easily for a game.
Steve thinks of how sketching Tony has felt second-nature for a long time, and grimaces at the thought that his feelings must have been obvious to everyone long before he realized (a voice in his head that sounds suspiciously like Natasha’s adds, “extremely obvious.”)
Even if Clint and Tony aren’t actually together, Tony could never be his. Steve’s an old-fashioned, stubborn ass who can’t even deal with his own feelings without avoiding two of his best friends. What hope does he have that Tony might return those feelings?
“What the hell were you thinking?” Steve hisses furiously, dabbing at the thin red scratches on Tony’s face. His voice falters a little as he remembers the feeling of panic punching a hole in his stomach when he’d raised his head to find Tony motionless beneath him.
So it’s not the image of Steve in red and black checkered flannel that stops Tony in his tracks at the doorway of the rec room. It’s the sinfully tight skinny jeans that Steve has chosen to pair with his flannel top that is currently leaving Tony breathless.
She smirks. Steve thinks that maybe he needs to reconsider his earlier sentiment. “Just making sure you’re not getting lost in a daydream.” Jan’s expression softens.
Thor nods. His happy expression turns mischievous as he looks down at Steve's phone. “Ah, so you have read about Tony and Clint’s new attachment as well? A fantastic joke, is it not?” He clasps a hand on Steve’s shoulder before leaving the room, his laughter booming loudly behind him.
Steve startles a little at the sound of high heels behind him. He twists around to find Jan carefully making her way down the steps of the fire escape in tall black boots, one hand on the railing and one hand grasping the jacket around her shoulders.
“Did Natasha finally get you to agree to go out with Jennifer? Or Kristen? Katherine? I can’t remember, the one from accounting,” Tony looked back at his project, not wanting to see Steve looking so good, so unattainable. “Where are you taking her? Need me to call Gio’s and get you a table? Could have just asked J, no need for you to come all the way down here to ask little old me.”
Tony heard Nat quip something back but all he could imagine was sparring with Steve, his hands on his biceps, those hands
He was content with just snacking on some almonds until he could get some food without running into anyone when JARVIS interrupted his peace, “Sir, Captain Rogers in requesting entrance.”
Tony’s not sure that the sounds that came out of his mouth were even human, but he made Steve laugh at least, and that was a glorious sound and sight. Steve’s blue eyes practically glittered as his head was thrown back, blonde hair catching the sun just right. He could almost hear Rhodey’s voice in his head, see the teasing grin on his face. It basically sounded like Tony was writing poetry or fanfiction about Steve.
“Incoming,” Natasha muttered as she disappeared into the shadows as all 6 feet 2 inches, 220 pounds of glistening muscle and rippling pectorals came at him. Tony pushed himself off the wall, standing probably a little too stiff and straight to be believable. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw the spy twins laughing at him, but his main focus was on Steve, sweaty, beautiful Steve, who stopped a foot away from him. God, Tony wanted to smash his face right in between those pec-
“No, it- it looks really good,” Tony replied, too awestruck to think about filtering his thoughts. “Really, really good Steve.”
Steve smiled fondly now, holding Tony up from where he practically fell out of his chair, “Very sure Tony. I, uh, wasn’t sure you were interested in me, but Nat insisted I go for it.”
“She was the best, and I mean that. Didn’t put up with anyone’s shit, not even my own when I came back with a swollen eye from another back alley fight. Would swipe the back of my head and scold me, all while getting a cool towel and making some stew. Got my fighting spirit from her.”
Tony watched all eyes turn to him expectantly when he blinked once, twice and put on his best (fake) smile, “What was that darling?”
Once Tony’s attention was finally on Steve, he seemed to lose a little of his bravado, ears turning a light shade of red. He seemed to steel himself before eyes bore into Tony’s, “Tony Stark, would you like to go get dinner with me?”
Steve looked back up and reached up to touch the glasses adorning his gorgeous face. Sighing and taking the thick rimmed black glasses off, he gave a slight chuckle, “Nat was teasing me about my age, asking if I needed reading glasses.” He raked his hand through his short hair, and
Tony Stark didn’t typically participate in team workouts, or workouts in general, because he had the Iron Man suit. And as much as Steve tried to convince it would be good just in case, Tony usually won the arguments and stayed down in his workshop or did minimal boxing with Happy instead. However, after the last fight with AIM, where Tony found his suit powered down (not like that would
“Captain Rogers requests access to the workshop sir,” JARVIS said again and Tony felt like he was going to cry. His throat closed up and he forcefully cleared it, pulling himself together. He was going to be happy for Steve. He deserved someone good. He could pretend to be happy for Steve,
“Thanks Tony,” Steve said, blush reaching even further up his neck, to the tips of his ears. His hand came up to rub the back of his neck. “So, uh, I didn’t really have a chance to eat much breakfast, and knowing you, you probably only had coffee. Not that I’m getting onto you about that! I just, well, you know that I wish you ate better, but I- gosh, what I’m trying to say is I’m hungry and you probably are too. I was about to call some take out? If you want some? Thai?”
“Don’t worry Stark, no need to go running for cover, I’m taking Steve with me actually,” Natasha said, standing up and pushing Steve off towards the elevator.
“Tony,” Steve repeated and Tony shut his eyes, willing the tears back. “Will you please look at me?”
“Thank god for her,” Tony replied and earned a full smile out of Steve. “Yes, I’m very interested, just didn’t think you were.”
Tony Stark wasn’t blind, and thank God for that, because then he wouldn’t be able to ogle at Steve in his uniform. And he’d deny that he ever ogled Steve in his uniform, no matter how many times Natasha may or may not have caught him looking. It was one thing for a Russian super spy to notice, but it was another thing when the media took notice.
“Don’t worry, you two can continue your pining later,” Natasha grinned when Tony choked on his coffee, sputtering his protests before she continued right on. “We’re going shopping, You know how I like to use you as my personal crowd divider, so let’s go.”
It was the day after the awkward group lunch that was possibly supposed to be a date, and Tony Stark was once again hiding in his workshop. He had refused to look at Steve during the whole thing, and also tried to avoid Natasha’s disappointed looks. After forcing the food down his throat and wondering if Steve had actually been trying to ask him out, for lunch, just the two of them, Tony had quickly excused himself to go back to work. Put the workshop in shut down mode and slept on the old couch he kept down there.
“I, uh, shit, I think I’ll spar with Barton, thanks Cap,” Tony exclaimed, a little too loudly, hands coming up as if to pat Steve’s arm before quickly aborting that mission and remaining stiff at his side as he crossed the gym to a giggling Clint and exasperated Natasha. If he glanced back and thought he saw a slightly dejected look cross Steve’s face, he tried to ignore it in favor of putting bird brain and his teasing remarks face down on the mat.
freaked out, so…that’s been about the past two hours,” Tony murmured, “Steve’s...not doing great. I kinda finally realized he’s been avoiding me ‘cause he likes me, so there’s that development. Ah, other than that, pretty good.”
“Fine. Put Pete in his crib first, though. I do not want to risk dropping him on accident,” he grunted.
“Sir yes sir, keep your pants on,” Steve snorted, finally backing out of the garage to speed down the road toward Stark Tower.
confused at his request. Steve merely rolled his eyes and climbed into Tony’s cot, tossing his blanket over them both and re-settling Mr. Rabbit between them.
“Wow,” he whispered aloud once they walked in, keeping a hand on Peter’s head so the baby would not look up at the bright embers, “It--It is
“There. Now you can listen to Daddy’s heartbeat and maybe sleep some more,” he said, brushing his fingers through Peter’s fine hair.
was interesting. He did not know much about bonds beyond basic knowledge, as Howard had not thought it relevant to his curriculum. Sure, Rhodey and Pepper had gossiped about bonding before, but Tony would have remembered if
“—Steve? Are you even listening? God, you better not have died while I was talking, that would be so incredibly rude—"
,” Tony argued, “He is only that kind of person. I am sure he would have done the same for any of the others.”
“I,” he said once he found his breath, “I think I am falling for him more than I thought I ever would. He looks at Peter and me with such a strange look in his eyes and a relaxed smile on his face… He already makes me feel valued. Perhaps my bar is too low, but if he keeps it up, he may make a wife out of me sooner than he thought.”
it to anything. That, and I’m kind of doing what Howard didn’t do for me. So. It’s working out, for now. We’ll see what happens tonight. I doubt he’ll enjoy it being dark.”
From the corner where he had been reading details of the overall experiment—Tony made sure he did not get any papers about the child, thank god—Steve stepped out of the shadows with his arms crossed over his chest.
“You are so good for me,” he murmured as he laid back so Peter could rest on his own, leaving both of his hands free, “Just another few minutes and we can go find some clothing and something to eat.”
Thor translated the question and Barnes laughed while shaking his head. He reached out to pat Tony’s cheek, only to laugh harder when Steve growled behind him. He patted Tony’s cheek again and purred a sentence at him, then ducked just out of reach when Steve swiped at him.
“We need to talk about your clothing choices at some point,” he said, raising an eyebrow at Steve’s grunt, “Not that I do not love having your body on display, but I really would like it to be a sight for only my eyes. Plus, seeing you nearly naked makes me want to ravish you all the time, and it really is not healthy to think of sex that often.”
it was that was in charge. The Prime Alpha may have superior leadership of the colony, but Tony was not going to allow him to attempt to force him into submission since his Omega biology reacted to an Alpha command. The crowd around them gasped at the defiance; at the noise, Steve suddenly seemed to remember himself. He turned red, crossed his arms and ducked his head, outwardly yielding to Tony’s display.
He led Steve over to an open bed and had him sit, gently petting his hair to try and keep him calm. With Peter shifted into a better position and tucked up against Steve’s chest, his wails turned to soft cries, but even they were quieted when Tony reached down to smooth back his fine hairs.
He sucked in a breath when Tony turned, recognizing the glassy look in his eyes from the first sleepover. Carefully, Steve drew him into a hug, smiling when the others declared a group hug and gathered around him.
Noticing that his charge had finally fallen asleep, Steve carefully replaced the furs over Tony’s feet and stood, attempting to be as quiet as possible so Peter would not awaken them both. He shuffled up to the head of the bed and smiled down at the two newest members of his family, leaning down to brush his nose against Tony’s before changing himself into sleeping clothes, keeping an eye on the bed the whole time. Content that neither of them would awaken, Steve blew out the candles in the room, drenching the room in darkness. He crawled into his bed, pulled the furs that Tony had slept in earlier up to his chest, and fell asleep.
He picked up a water bottle from under the bench he was on and uncapped it, swallowing it all in one go. Wiping the water from his lips, Steve sat forward and stared at the ground, replaying the last few hours of the mission in his mind. Thankfully, Natasha and Sam had managed to find a place where they could all lay low for a while without raising suspicion, considering most of them were clearly foreigners and didn’t speak the local languages. It had been a complete surprise when they burst through the door of the compound and demand they all suit up, barely explaining on the flight over that they’d found the entrance and that the heavy hitters would go first.
Shocked by himself, Steve’s eyes widened, his mouth open slightly as he realized what he had said. Tony stared at him, a hundred thoughts running through his mind.
. That’s cheating, you know. I can’t put up a fight when you act like a big soft teddy bear,” he grumbled back, cupping Steve’s chin to run his thumb over his lips, “It’s quite rude, you know.”
Smiling as the bickering continued between Clint and Bruce again, Steve sat up a little straighter, his momentary disgruntlement gone. Seeing as the movie had ended, he stood with a stretch and bid them all goodnight, missing Tony’s lingering stare as he turned to head up to his room.
Touching the skin under each eye as Tony mentioned them, PJ seemed to mouth the names of the colors, thankfully distracted.
“Yeah. Sorry you guys can’t stay overnight, but I’m not ‘llowed to have girls overnight and Mother didn’t want me to make them feel left out,” Tony admitted, shrugging off Bucky so he could wrestle himself into his clothes, “Plus, Father’s still mad over the last time you guys came over and tried to get into his study.”
PJ perked up at that, tilting his head up from Tony’s shoulder. He flicked his gaze between Tony and Pepper, eventually settling his eyes on the ginger.
Listening to Steve whine pathetically, Tony quickly poured lube into his hand, distracting him with kisses as he warmed it up. He giggled at the Captain’s eagerness, nibbling on his bottom lip and eagerly slipping his tongue into his mouth. Groaning softly, he grabbed both of their cocks with his lubed hand, loving Steve’s sultry moan as he gently stroked them off together.
Not soothed by the treatment, Peter continued to cry, grasping at Tony’s chest hair until he winced and had to pull the baby’s hands away. He tried to cradle Peter again to see if he was still hungry, but the baby refused, large tears rolling down his cheeks.
“I came to check on the Prime,” Bruce said as he entered and closed the door behind him, “How are you feeling, Steve?”
“I want—I want to do therapy with you,” Steve was saying, pulling him out of his thoughts, “I want to be there with you, for all of it. I missed—I fucked up so much already. I want to be there for you, more than ever, and—”
He stood and got to an angle where he could still stitch and gently guided Steve’s head to his neck, knowing he was putting him right at his scent gland.
“Not for now, point break. Go to the compound. You’ve already been and know your way around,” Tony decided, scratching at his goatee, “Is that everyone? Yes? Okay. Natty, dear, please tell good ol’ Cyclops what’s been going on. As much as I loathe to admit it, SHIELD may have some men on the ground that know things that we should know. But only divulge on a need to know.”
Turning, he nearly missed Steve’s color roaring back in full force, even darkening the tips of his ears to a rosy pink. Smirking in victory, Tony traipsed back into the bathroom, finding PJ fiddling with his wet hoodie as he shifted from foot to foot. He crouched down in front of the boy, smiling warmly at him.
Pausing in his thought, Tony sat up with a grunt, adjusting his pillows so he could at least stay sitting up. He felt like whining loudly to get Steve to bring him some sort of painkiller, but he’d rather slice off his own toes before admitting to the Captain that he was needy.
She flicked her eyes over to him, and after a moment, nodded and left. Tony turned around to face Steve, careful to keep his arms wrapped around Peter for safety. He tentatively inched closer to the Prime, only stopping once he was close enough to touch.
Tony shook the thought from his head and smiled at his boyfriend, taking his hand once he was ready to leave. They had suit fittings booked for the morning; Steve grew out of his last one, and Tony was always in the market for new threads, especially since he wanted to celebrate graduation with something flashy. Technically, they had already picked out the suits they wanted, and this was a final alterations check. Steve had chosen a tuxedo in navy brought in at the waist to accentuate his shoulders and chest, with straight pant legs to draw the eye upward. When he stood on the short platform and looked at himself in the mirror, straightening out the cuffs and collar, Tony had to sit down or risk creaming himself in front of the tailor.
The finger inside him stilled and Tony nearly cried. He tried to move his hips again but Steve growled and slipped his finger out, much to Tony’s chagrin.
“I hope so,” Steve said quickly, only to turn and grin as Thor ran up to him, tackling him into a laughing hug.
“Not really, but every time there’s even a small hitch in their relationship, I’m ready to call in favors,” he said softly, “Tony’s my best friend, man. He’s already been through—
“Sorry. It’s cute how terrible you are at this,” Tony teased, sneaking in a small kiss on the tip of Steve’s nose, “We’ll go to dinner tonight. Dress nice. I’ll have J let you know when to be ready. Oh, and remember to put the ice cream away. No need to mope anymore, right?”
“Hey now, its just Auntie Pep, no need to be shy,” he soothed, petting PJ’s hair, “Why don’t we go get Mr. Elephant and some of your books? We can practice your words for Papa, so you can show off for him when he gets home. How does that sound?”
He moved Peter up to his shoulder and scooted out of the bed, feeling both thankful and guilty that his pain was mostly gone. He walked them over to the closet and dug around for Peter’s wrap, carefully tying the baby to his chest so he could keep his arms relatively free.
With that smile cast on him and him alone, Tony was unable to help his own shy smile, picking up the drawing and holding it to his chest.
Tony watched as she left, momentarily stunned. A bit of guilt nagged at his brain as he immediately thought about Steve, but he shoved it down, knowing he needed to focus on the situation at hand. Carefully, he reached over to take PJ’s small hand in his own, careful of the IV in his hand. He finally realized how fragile the small child was: not only was he weak to the point of barely being able to function like a normal child, but his abused psyche no doubt affected him in ways that even Tony had trouble understanding. It was all he could do for the moment, to sit and wait and
“You know that I would do anything for you, yeah?” Steve mentioned quietly, standing to wring out the washcloth and lather it up again before swiping it over Tony’s belly, “No matter how bad this is, or how bad your nightmares get, or if you end up wearing a catheter to bed because this becomes a permanent issue—I will
“No? No sad?” Steve answered with a wet laugh, delicately putting a hand on the boy’s back, “Okay. No sad for Papa.”
“Alright, little caterpillar, let’s get you up here,” he decided selfishly, using one arm to heft the lightweight child up onto the bed.
He ducked down under the blanket again and pulled the book back out, opening it back up to the diagram. He let his eyes linger for a moment, and once he decided that yes, it
“Nah. Thor went, so I decided to stay back and wait for you,” Bruce replied with a smile, “That, and I wanted to check on PJ, as well.”
He stopped mid-sentence to hiss softly, his right hand involuntarily going to press against his left side. Panting softly, Tony shook his head as the sharp pain dulled, leaning back in his chair to ignore Steve’s amped up look of concern.
“Yeah. Sleep and food,” Tony murmured, “Hopefully he’ll sleep through the night tonight since he’ll be with me.”
Tony stuck his hand out at the boy, wiggling his fingers until PJ giggled, gently resting his hand on top of Tony’s, as usual. Together they started to go through boxes until Tony crowed in triumph, pulling out a boy’s twin bed set.
“Right. You’re on the team headed to the Sahara,” Tony said, shaking his head when Steve opened his mouth, “I agreed you should go. Bruce and Wanda are staying here, so they need the manpower. We’ll be okay while you’re gone.”
“This is a really bad idea, but I know I can’t convince you otherwise,” Steve sighed, letting PJ down to get into the car before sliding in himself, “If we do this, you owe me one.”
The line went quiet for a moment, so Steve imagined Tony walking over to the other side of the shop to first scold Dummy, then to pick up PJ and rest him on his hip, lightly scolding him for turning his other child against him. After a minute, Steve heard rustling on the other side, but the line was still quiet otherwise.
“No, Tony, you were only standing up for yourself,” Bruce soothed, “It is a natural reaction. I am sure Steve understands and will help you have a relaxing evening to wash off this accident.”
. Jesus, Steve, you ran out of there like a bat out of hell. You scared the kid enough that he tried to run after you.”
After listening to the sound of vibrainium clanging against wood for longer than he ever wanted to, Tony was rudely snapped out of his thoughts when a log was tossed onto the fire, making it crackle and hiss in his face. He swore and leaned back, looking up to glare at a smug Bucky.
Ever quiet, Steve leaned back up and offered him a small smile, then settled back down on the bed. He tapped his ear and rolled over onto his side, closer to Tony. Just as he was about to ask what Steve was doing, their bedroom door flew open to reveal Thor, hurriedly attempting to catch said door with one hand and a large platter balanced in the other.
“He’s overwhelmed,” Steve interrupted, causing a shiver to go down Tony’s spine, “He came from a place where the world was designed to hurt him and he had
“Hello, Mother,” Tony said softly, not wanting to accidentally scare her as he so often did, “We’re here.”
The dreams were worse. Bloodied eagles had turned to torrential rains and howling wind, destroying all in its path as it tore through the city. He screamed and screamed as the market and the castle were ripped from their roots, bodies joining the debris that swirled up endlessly into the sky until they were nothing more than faraway dots. He was alone in the middle of it all, seemingly unaffected by everything happening around him, like a prisoner trapped in a glass cage.
“No, I banged myself up in my cell. He did not get to me to hurt me, you know that. You were there,” Rhodey soothed, pulling up his sleeve to show Tony the mottled bruising on his upper arm, “Really, Tones. He is quite… impressive. You sure have him wrapped around your finger.”
“Hush,” she soothed, reaching up to cup his face, “It’s okay. I finally get a child to spoil that I can leave with his parents when he decides to be a brat.”
“Mine too,” Steve whispered, moving up to brush their noses together, “God, I’m so sorry, love. I’m so, so sorry—”
Leaving Clint to keep watch over PJ, Tony and Steve hesitantly followed Bucky down to the common room, joining their fellow Avengers once more for a group meeting. Tony immediately sidled up to Natasha’s side and Steve to T’Challa’s, both men clearly impatient and antsy.
A screen on the dashboard flickered to life with a GPS and Tony set the car in reverse, resetting his mirrors as he turned out of the cabin’s driveway to roar out of the jungle. At first, the drive was smooth, but at a few soft pops, Tony looked at Steve through the rearview mirror, catching the familiar creased-brow look.
Knowing he was still at a disadvantage due to his injury, and not wanting to put PJ at risk, Tony sat on one of the side benches, looking out the window as he tried to console the boy. He decided to bounce PJ on his knee, which for the moment calmed his crying, and allowed Tony to fully focus his brain on their surroundings passing them.
Steve cleared his throat next to them and Tony jumped away, blushing deeply and casually pushing down Rhodey’s hand from his side.
Tony did not hesitate to sit, leaning up against Rhodey’s arm to rest his head on his shoulder. Rhodey hissed and moved his arm to pull Tony in instead, grunting at the movement.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Doesn’t mean I’m happy about it or that I’m not going to try and get to the workshop sometime when you all are asleep,” he pouted, folding his arms over his chest.
“He’s trying to ask you if you’re coming home to me,” Tony said, “I’ve been assigned a color, due to it being emanating from my chest.”
“Pots of boiling water to be readied on the walls. If you have an example sword or can retrieve one, I can melt it and re-temper it to be stronger, or it can be crafted into a metal shield. Long-distance weapons would be superior, so perhaps you would want it to instead be made into arrows and crossbows?” Tony rattled off.
“I can get SHIELD to do the same,” Natasha agreed, looking over at Clint, “We’ll keep Fury in the loop, but only need-to-know.”
“Steve, honey, breathe,” Tony said calmly, reaching out with both hands to take Steve’s shoulders, “Stay with me, okay? You’re starting to hyperventilate, you’ll set off your asthma if you’re not careful.”
“That’s it. Such a good boy, PJ. A good, sweet boy. You’re doing so well,” Tony praised, feeling embarrassment prickle the hairs on the back of his neck, “I’m right here. Nothing’s going to hurt you, okay? They can’t hurt you anymore. You’re safe here. It’s okay, pumpkin pie. We got you. I promise.”
“Then you should be very careful. If you have not been exposed to heavy spices for a long time, you may not have enough bodily resistance to their… unpleasant effects,” Bruce said, “I will try to see if our chef has other dishes that can expand your horizons without destroying your bowels. Fair?”
Steve blinked, looked down at Tony’s hands and then at the Omega, eyes blown wide with need. He slipped his hands around Tony’s waist and down over his ass, sucking in a sharp breath at just how wet he was; slick had smeared over his cheeks and down his thighs, which made Steve wonder about the absorbency of Tony’s underwear.
Once he held his hand out, PJ griped but slid his tiny hand into Tony’s palm, slipping his other hand’s thumb into his mouth. With Steve trailing behind them, the trio slowly made their way to the elevator down to the medbay. Thankfully, once the doors opened to the familiar hallway, there was already a nurse waiting with a bed, to which Tony sent off a silent thank you to JARVIS for thinking ahead. Carefully, and with Steve’s help, he got up onto the bed, not realizing how terrible he actually felt until he was laying down.
“Good gods, you need to stop sneaking up on me,” he snapped, cuddling Peter to his chest since he had also scared the baby in the process.
He forced himself to keep his head tilted up to make eye contact, surprised to find Steve’s worry melt into a shy smile that made his eyes crinkle in the corners. Then, he started to laugh, soft at first, turning into shoulder-shaking cackling as he ducked his head into the crook of Tony’s neck.
Tony grunted at the weight, but at least Steve was still conscious, which was better than some of his previous partners. He could feel their bond buzzing in his core, and when he mentally poked at it, he choked on the searing pleasure that roared into his body. Instinctively, he writhed and clenched down, his cock twitching in interest. He felt Steve’s cock pulse again inside of him, but Steve barely reacted as he was too busy catching his breath.
It felt hopeless. Tony opened his eyes and sighed, leaning up from Natasha to slump against the wall. She patted his shoulder and slipped off of the bed to move Steve’s desk back into place, then paused with her hand on the doorknob as she turned to leave.
“Pumpkin, you need to eat if you ever want to be ridiculously buff like your Papa,” he said, picking up a knife from the table to start cutting the sandwich into cubes, “Besides, PB&J is the best kind of sandwich. I promise you’ll like it.”
“Ow!—yeah, yeah, I get it,” Steve grumbled, taking his hands out of Tony’s pockets to put them protectively over his chest, “I’ll read it once and hand it over and not say anything about it. I promise.”
Coughing a bit, PJ looked up, his eyes bloodshot and cheeks blotchy from his fit. Shushing him softly, Tony bounced him on his hip as he carried him over to the forgotten box of tissues. With a heavy grunt, he bent at his knees to pick up the box, ignoring Steve’s chuckle at how loudly his knees cracked.
“You still do, sometimes. It’s cute to see Tony pout at clearly being Mom and then relax when he sees how proud Steve looks,” Rhodey laughed.
He watched Tony, and after a moment his husband’s shoulders slumped, and he rubbed a hand over his face with a sigh.
Frowning, Tony slid off the gurney, shifting uncomfortably at the ice pressed to his chest. He quickly scooped up PJ and the pajamas, holding the child tight as he followed the nurse to be returned to his six-guard entourage. Quickly, the guards fell into place around him, marching him back out of the medical wing and toward the cell he had woken up in. Before the door closed, he turned around, clearing his throat.
“Right, finding out you and I have a genetically engineered child isn’t exactly the best for you,” Tony said before he could snap his mouth shut.
“Well, I’ll be damned,” Natasha whistled, “Alright, question two. What is your favorite flavor of ice cream? Bruce, you go first this time.”
The two men looked at each other for a moment, a mutual understanding sending chills down Tony’s spine. He looked away before Steve did, slipping off the counter with a grunt. Realizing that his pain was better without an ice pack on, horror must have shown on his face, because Steve was right there, his hands gentle on Tony’s biceps.

“Well, in my defense, I was trying to not seem imposing or anything. I mean, gosh, Tony. You’re—you’re
He moved Peter up to his chest for skin-to-skin contact, knowing that his own pheromones were souring the room, as some of the lesser Alphas had wrinkled their noses or turned away. The Prime stared at them for a few minutes, then he beckoned to Thor and began to talk rapidly, fast enough that the man could not translate in real time. One of the other Alphas in the room began to giggle but was quickly silenced with an elbow to the gut. Tony felt a bit comforted by that, stooping down to pick up his clothes and slip them back on, all while still juggling his baby. Just as he was straightening himself out, Thor turned to him, conflicting emotions betrayed in his face.
“Enough now, little rabbit. You will upset Peter if you scent more like this,” Steve said quietly, squeezing his hip again, “Let us return to the dining room and have our friends distract you for some time, yes? After we all separate for bed and have Peter settled, we can go for a walk if you wish.”
He looked up at Thor and tilted his head at Steve, nodding to insinuate that he should translate. Thor barely had the sentence out when Steve made a choked noise; Tony stiffed and schooled his face, keeping his eyes on Peter so he would not have to see the disappointment on his new Alpha’s face.
It was his last card to play. Tony swallowed nervously and turned around, only to take a startled breath, as the Prime stood just a few inches from him, towering over them. Shaking, Tony lowered Peter into his arms and removed his swaddling, cradling the nude babe in his arms. The Prime’s eyes grew large as he looked between the baby and Tony, clearly staring at their unclaimed markings. Peter looked up at the Prime and reached up a chubby arm, whimpering when nothing was given to him to hold onto. Tony immediately shifted him to one arm so he could let Peter hold onto his finger, but the baby was already upset, and he began to cry.
“No, no, it is okay,” Tony said quickly as he reached up to pat Steve’s back in comfort, “That… That is good. I am just not used to seeing you so sweet with him, is all. You should hold him more often, you know. He likes to be held and kissed.”
“Daddy,” Tony answered back, pointing at himself before racking his brain and pointing to Steve, “…uh, Papa?”
The Warlords are called out on a mission, leaving Tony and Bruce to find companionship in each other.
“It’s okay. You can cuddle me in a much larger bed once I’m good to leave,” he promised, his smirk widening as Steve’s blush traveled down to his neck again, “You aren’t that good at hiding embarrassment, are you?”
PJ gave him a suspicious look, but he obeyed, leaving Tony’s lap to crawl into Steve’s arms. Relieved of the pressure, Tony opened his mouth to let out a silent scream, turning his chair back around so the others couldn’t see how pained he actually was.
“Relatively speaking, there is good news. There is no sign of invasive torture like we tend to see with most children in these cases,” The nurse said, placing the clipboard on the bed for Tony to pick up and look at, “He’ll still need some forms of therapy, though. There’s no doubt he has been through a lot, and it will take him a long time to recover…but, if there’s anyone who can help this boy, it’s definitely you, Mr. Stark.”
Tony watched Clint’s shoes go by as he ran off and he sighed, wincing when Steve rolled his hips again and huffed into his ear. He tried to lay as still as possible and shut his eyes, attempting to ignore Steve’s nibbling up his neck and on his jaw.
“Uh, yeah,” Tony says, frowning a little before shaking his head, apparently deciding to ignore Steve’s lack of brain-to-mouth filter for the moment. “You seemed off at the debrief earlier. Are you feeling alright?”
As if summoned by Steve’s thoughts, Tony suddenly appears next to him, one hand on his arm. There’s a pinched edge to his smile that smooths out when he sets his eyes on Steve. Something tight and careful in his posture leaves Steve feeling on edge, even as Tony maintains an outwardly calm expression.
More than one picture of Tony dancing at the party makes it onto the next morning’s newspapers. Using one of the photos, Steve attempts to replicate Tony’s expression on paper. It’s almost perfect, for once. Tony looks content, if a little bored at being the center of attention, his smile bright and flawless.
Steve sees Tony tracking the movement of his hand. Perhaps it’s a trick of firelight, but for a moment, Steve swears that Tony’s face falls in response.
It’s Friday afternoon, which means Tony will be at the lab with Professor Pym, but when Steve gets there, Tony is nowhere to be seen. Three calls to Tony all go to his “This is DUM-E, I’m a robot so don’t call me back” voicemail.
It’s like not being able to understand a picture until you turn it the right way around. And then it’s there in front of you, impossible to mistake for something else. Like looking into a partial reflection and seeing the rest of it, even without the light.
“Your eternal love and devotion, of course? What did you think I’d ask for?” Rhodey rolls his eyes, but Tony sees the fond smile lurking at the corner of his mouth and beams triumphantly.
“Are we really so tiresome that you’d prefer the company of a good book and a stiff drink to a night on the town with us?”
The doors slide smoothly open and Steve steps inside. “Tony, there’s breakfast upstairs if you want it—” Steve breaks off when he spots Rhodey, the strangely shy look on his face morphing into a delighted grin.
Steve makes the call amid loud hoots and laughter from his team and hangs up on an irate Johnny Storm mid-way through his tirade. It looks like the next team up with the Fantastic Four is going to be an interesting one, after this.
Steve drops his sketchpad down beside him before glancing at Tony, who’s now turned away from him. He wonders if he should apologize for acting defensively when Tony startled him, but he knows Tony will brush that off without a second glance. He shifts a little, his knee knocking against Tony’s, and something warm settles in his stomach when Tony doesn’t move away.
Their lips slip against each other’s rather clumsily until Tony tilts his head a little, coaxing Steve’s mouth open with a soft lick. Steve’s kiss tastes tangy and sweet against his tongue. Tony never wants to stop chasing that taste until he’s learned it by heart. It’s not perfect, but it’s so very real, and Tony wants
Steve sucks in a long deep breath, almost dropping his sketchpad onto the floor before his reflexes snap back in action. When he looks up, Tony’s frowning and looking closely at him. “You’re looking a bit flushed, Steve. Is everything okay?”
Steve grins up at her and does as she says, holding out a hand for support as she settles herself gingerly on the step beside him. “As milady wishes.”
“Drinks, dancing, friends, my dazzling presence… What more could you want, Steve?” Tony fiddles with the knot of his tie, peering encouragingly at Steve from under his eyelashes before returning his attention to his suit once again. “How will we enjoy ourselves without you?”
Foggy makes a noise of approval. “Oh god, yes, that sounds amazing.” He gestures towards Steve. “Also, you have to tell where you got that Bilbo Baggins shirt because it’s brilliant and I want ten of them.”
Darting next to Tony, Clint takes the mug from him in a flash, before pressing a sloppy kiss to Tony’s cheek. “I’ll take that. Thanks, honey.” Steve’s heart thuds painfully in his chest. He resists the sudden and very strong urge to shove Clint away from Tony.
Steve screws up his half-finished sketch into a tight ball and tosses it on the floor in frustration.
He’s good at his job - there’s no question of that. Steve knows that Tony and Jim had had misgivings about taking him on as their illustrator at Pepper’s recommendation while she broadened her scope to chronicle other journals as well as
It quickly dissipated as Tony hitched in his sleep, his brows furrowing and lips quivering in response to whatever kind of dream he was having. Steve quickly shushed him and rubbed his thumb at the worried crease, leaning forward to kiss the curve of his jaw until Tony settled again.
“To be fair, Tony’s always liked kids,” Sam pointed out from the couch, “I just didn’t think he still wanted his own genes still swimming around.”
It was nearly Christmas, so the elementary school was holding a play, and all of the students were required to participate. The younger kids were to be carolers, but for Tony and his class as the older students in 4
“Every time I look at you, my heart feels so much lighter,” Steve sighed fondly, unaware that Tony could understand him, “You are such a treasure to come home to, little rabbit. You and Peter.”
He honestly really hated that he had to use a rolling backpack, but if he was going to carry his AP Calculus, AP Government, Physics, and ACT study guide textbooks around, Tony recognized that he did indeed have a weak back and would not be able to carry them around by himself. However, Steve
Tony tried to bat away Bruce’s hand, but with Peter settling on his chest, he had to let the man check him over again. He glanced over at Steve with the largest pleading eyes he could manage, swallowing his smirk when the Alpha stepped forward and growled at Bruce. Immediately, he stepped back and bowed his head, allowing Steve to take his place and cup Tony’s face. Tony felt guilty after that: Bruce was only trying to help, after all.
Tony was quiet for a moment. He knew it was probably confusing to the toddler that he did not necessarily see his daddy before bed every night anymore.
“Okay, wives. I’m going to ask you three questions. Put one answer per piece of cardstock, okay?” Natasha asked, resettling herself on the chair at the front of the room, “First question: What is your spouse’s most irritating habit? Bucky, we’ll start with you.”
“I brought you something else, too,” Steve interrupted softly, a small smile on his face, “I thought you might like one. I had one when I was around your age, so—”
PJ shook his head, but he grabbed onto Steve’s hand, tugging it toward him. Steve cocked his head as PJ did it again, then blinked once the boy moved closer to Tony and tugged once more.
“What’s this for?” Steve asked in a tight voice, taking the thermos and clearly holding back from crushing it.
“Rhodey has the War Machine suit and Clint has ridden bi—on the suit’s back for long periods of time!” Tony complained, “Plus, they’ll get a lift back home from SHIELD once they take care of the base. C’mon, Steve, we had to g—”
“We just finished making the bed and he started jumping on it, then laid down and just passed out for no reason,” Tony explained in one breath, hovering over Bruce’s shoulder as worry built up in his gut, “He wouldn’t wake up when I shook him—”
Tony winced when the boy wailed louder, barely resisting putting his hands up over his ears. He reached out toward Thor and looked at him pleadingly, hoping that the man would understand. Thor fumbled with the wineskins but eventually handed one over, and after Tony had tasted it to make sure it was milk, he tipped it down for Peter to drink from.
Turning off the water, Tony set all of the cleaning supplies back where they had been before going back out of the shower, glad to see that they at least had
PJ whined and pouted as he was set on his feet, grunting when Tony wrangled him out of what was left of his pajamas and carefully scrubbed him down. It was a miracle that the child was able to behave for him for so long, especially since he continued to glance at the door like he was going to bolt. Recognizing the itch, Tony bundled the boy up in a towel and carried him back out to the bedroom, plopping him onto the bed.
“Sleep, my love,” he murmured, “I’ll be right here when you wake up. I’m not going anywhere. I promise.”
“Do not fret. The Prime has no trouble in battle, but if it brings you comfort to know that I am at his side, then I will be there,” Thor promised, “While I watch for him, keep an eye on the good Doctor for me. He gets into trouble without the rest of us around.”
“Baby, I’m going to cry, even if the ceremony is some random old dude having us sign our names on a piece of paper,” Steve said, his voice clearly wet with emotion, “C’mon, I can’t stand not being married to you any longer.”
It was a little difficult to pass a sleeping baby without waking him up. Eventually, they settled on Tony almost tipping the babe into Rhodey’s arms so his head would easily flop from one shoulder to the other. If it bothered Peter, he did not make a noise to voice it and carried on sleeping. While Rhodey cooed and fussed over the baby with the others, Tony sidled up to Steve to wrap his arms around his waist and tuck his head against his chest. Steve quickly enveloped him in an embrace and gave him a kiss of his own, slowly and deliberately.
Steve turned and stuffed the compass into his utility belt, nodding at his Lieutenant who had poked his head into his tent.
With a shaky hand, PJ reached out to touch the shirt, only to burst into tears. He plopped down in the doorway and sobbed, rubbing his eyes. Tony was taken aback for a second before his brain kicked in and he attempted to soothe the boy.
Thor and Bucky shared a glance over their bickering, from which Bucky nodded and elbowed Bruce. The doctor looked up and glanced at them both; upon catching their signal, the three men slowly eased out of the room until Bucky was just a shadow in the doorway. If Steve saw them move, he did not say anything, for Tony did not notice they had been left alone until he realized Thor’s constant translations were missing.
Tony waved a hand in the direction of the gruff voice, trying his best to ward Steve off. He was fine, thank you very much, he could get up and take care of his baby all by himself. Slowly, he tried to get up again and promptly ignored the throbbing in his knees, his chest, and behind his eyes. He shuffled over to the crib one step at a time, making sure he was properly balanced before hefting Peter up.
Forcing himself to raise his head, Tony barely registered Steve crouched in front of him, his hand halfway between them as if he had stopped himself from reaching out. Tony blinked erratically, hands clutching at the plush carpet as he tried to force words out of his mouth.
Looking helplessly down at the boy, Tony kept trying to wake him, wondering what nightmare could be holding onto the boy so tight.
“How else do you think I deal with my anger issues? Expensive therapy?” Bruce said, shrugging, “Also, you carry yourself differently after Howard has an episode. You hunch more, like you want to hide.”
“Clearly, I was kidding, but he took it seriously and left. Bruce got mad that I made Steve upset, so
“Now, this time, do you want to bathe? If so, that comes first so I do not waste any supplies,” Tony said casually as he put his supplies on the counter.
“Where are we going in such a hurry?” Tony grumbled, nuzzling Peter’s head while he stayed in line with Steve.
, and the fire in his belly was only growing hotter. The bond tugged and pulled at him, wanting his attention, and the longer he resisted it the worse he felt. He wanted Steve, dammit, he wanted his cool touch and warm lips against his forehead. Sure, it was childish to want such things when they were in the middle of a damned
Steve visibly gulped and crawled in, shimmying around until he was seated on his usual side. Finally, Tony could turn his attention to Peter, letting out a relieved sigh at the baby’s easy temperament. After a kiss and a quick diaper check, Tony laid Peter back down in his crib and smoothed down his wispy hair.
“Shall we go find out what the Alphas are up to?” He asked, standing slowly as not to aggravate Peter, “It is not very kind of them to leave us out, you know. Nor is it kind to leave your betrothed at the table alone.”
“Hey, what was that for?” He grumbled, trying to see over her shoulder at the last paper she had stopped on.
“You read the rescue mission one, didn’t you,” he accused, pouting when Steve giggled, “You bitch, you are
“Tony. It’s okay,” Bruce said gently, putting a hand on Tony’s arm, “We recovered the elephant. He’s in PJ’s room, all nice and cleaned. I’ll go get stuff put in motion, then be down later to help with PJ, okay? Now you, young man, you be good for your Daddy, okay?”
Thor’s voice died as he and Bruce led Clint away and into the castle, leaving Tony alone with the others. Steve looked at Natasha and nodded toward the prisoner, to which she happily took off of the horse and led them away by the rope. Barnes and the falconer--
Bruce shook his head. “We need to keep moving. Clint and James packed up and caught our breakfast, but we wanted to let you sleep in a little more. How are you feeling?”
“Rhodey had patched me up. One of the stupid agents took out my chip, so we need to put a new one in somewhere. Probably my thigh. Anyway. Steve got us fed, and because I’m worried that something invasive or whatever happened to PJ, I made him leave with me in the Avengecar. Quincar. It flies.”
“Are—are you sure? I don’t want to get in the way,” he said softly, showing his nervous tick by picking at his nails, “I mean, you two probably need time to recuperate—”
“A Southerner?” The Warlord said, smiling at Tony’s surprise, “I speak many languages. It is why I patrol the borders for trespassers such as yourself. Why are you here, in the Northern Territory? Surely you know your people are at war with our own.”
As per his first investigation, the mattress was certainly chained to the bed frame, but the bed frame wasn’t chained down. Snorting a laugh, Tony slowly dragged over the second bed, fitting it up against the first bed to make a larger area to lay down. With a wince, he laid down and sprawled on the beds, smiling as PJ then settled down next to him, careful to be on his side that wasn’t being iced.
There was no argument. With that, Natasha waved her hand, at which they all scrambled to their feet. Together, they rearranged the furniture and dragged out the dining room chairs, setting up three sets of pairs with a chair in the front for Natasha. Once they were settled, Nat held out the hat, to which Thor plucked a name first.
He scowled and shut his eyes tight, rubbing the space between his brows to try and quell his headache.
“I am sorry,” he whispered, unable to loosen up due to the shame he felt,  “Y-you just bathed, you will have to clean up again—”
“Yeah, honeybear, I guess I did,” Tony choked out, reaching for him with his other hand to squeeze his hand, “Sorry ‘bout that.”
“Where’s Mom?” he repeated nervously, pretending he didn’t feel Steve’s arms tightening a fraction around him, “Where is she? Is she here yet?”
“Please do not choke,” Bruce said, absolute judgment stamped on his face, “I do not want to have to figure out how to save you while also holding Peter.”
“Alphas only turn feral when they think their Omega is in danger, Tony, and James does not know any of the Warlord Omegas,” Bruce said quietly.
“Make yourself at home,” Tony grumbled, pretending that the Alpha’s scent was not even more pleasing up close, “Would you like me to lay on you as well?”
Technically, it was not a lie. He made himself read through any medical literature he could find and regularly practiced using medical supplies so he was prepared for the days when Howard was wine drunk and angry. It happened often enough that he had become quite good at stitching the skin, apparently to the point that an actual doctor could recognize it. Thankfully, Bruce’s only response was to raise one eyebrow, not believing him but not pressing the matter either.
“At least it was with me,” he whispered to himself, damning his shaky hands as he put the book back in the shoebox.
been treated well, and the others seemed to genuinely be concerned for his well-being. If things continued to be… less than ideal with Steve, he figured he could always hide out with Thor since he had witnessed the linguist publicly scold the Prime Alpha.
The word made Steve perk up almost immediately, relief flooding his face and bringing crinkles to the corners of his eyes. He brought his hand up to cover Tony’s, turning his head so he could kiss Tony’s palm. Embarrassed by the affection, Tony patted his cheek and pulled away, stepping back and motioning to his stomach.
“Now look, we got you step stools and even a little butt cushion, so you won’t fall in,” He explained, grinning at the boy’s soft giggle, “If you need help, St—Papa and I will be right outside, okay?”
“Alright, everyone! Pack up and head to your seats with your math books!” Miss Hill called from the front, clapping her hands three times.
The Captain paused, his hands stilling in the bag as Tony’s words washed over him. He looked up, painfully obvious hope spreading over his features.
“Ah, Mister Stark?” The nurse asked quietly, edging forward as Tony was in the middle of getting PJ into his new clothes, “Overlord Zemo asked me to attend to your injuries. Apparently, the child was…
Forcing himself out of the inner debate, Tony stood from the chair and looked around, catching his face in a dark computer monitor. He quickly fixed himself up to try and hide the freshly-cried look, only to give up and run a hand through his hair. Now sufficiently rumpled, but not at
“No, you move,” Steve murmured, ducking his head to try and hide the bright red flush that dipped down to his neck, “Yeah. I think she was just trying to make my stubbornness into a good quality, though. I have a tendency to do that.”
“The Prime has agreed to grant you refuge,” he said, clasping his hands behind his back, “But he has laid out a…condition. Of sorts.”
“Ah, yes,” Steve muttered, his cheeks somehow turning a darker shade of pink, “It is your nickname, if you would like. I thought it was fitting… because you are so jumpy. Like a little rabbit.”
“It was just a thought, okay? Just—drop it. I’ll have a conversation with Rhodey later,” Tony interrupted back, putting a hand on his forehead, “Could—could you just please show me where PJ is? I don’t—I don’t want him to be alone right now.”
He winked and tugged on his reins, guiding his horse toward the front of the pack. Steve raised an arm and followed with the entire cavalry behind him. He exchanged words with Thor, and with one last chant and cheer, the group galloped off, quickly disappearing over the horizon. Tony stood there for a time, just looking out in case they suddenly turned back. He shifted Peter up and distractedly nuzzled the baby’s cheek, managing a smile when Peter gurgled.
Tony nodded, blushing as his Mother leaned in to kiss his cheek, using her thumb to wipe away any traces of her lipstick.
“Upstairs?” Tony asked hopefully, beaming at Steve’s flushed nod as he attempted to get out of the car and also hide his arousal, “You could carry me and we can just have someone else come get the ch—”
Steve whirled around and grabbed his upper arm, tugging him close as he dragged them off to a more private alley. At least, as private as they could get; some of the townspeople followed and hovered around, interested in who their leader was with and what was going down.
“Well, he has the mentality of a toddler, but he’s physically older, so sure. He’s the older brother.”
“I’m right here. You’re okay, you’re right here with me, on my floor, and everything’s alright,” Tony said quietly, cupping Steve’s cheek to wipe away the tear tracks that ran down to his jaw, “Do you think you can stand? We should get you to the couch so I can hug both of my favorite boys.”
Tony leaned forward as he watched Steve bustle about, subconsciously focusing on the other’s broad shoulders and the muscles moving under the thin tank top. He nearly got lost in thought before two hands were tugging on his pant leg, dragging him back to reality. Looking down, he smiled at PJ, sitting back in his chair.
“I know you wish to squirrel me away from the rest of society, where no one can hurt me or try to take me from you,” he said carefully, “But you need to understand that I am just as autonomous as you are. Omega or not, I am a person, Steve. Though I do admit that I like the feeling of… possession… I refuse to be a prisoner simply because you do not like how I dress.”
“Like a bitch, but I’ll live,” Tony laughed softly, only to grunt as he tried to move, “What happened? Where the
Tony looked up and made eye contact with Bruce, searching the doctor’s eyes for any sort of untruth.
“No can do,” Bucky said, shaking his head, “Natasha bullied the staff into telling us why they knew your blood type without asking and not so legally got a hold of your records. It’s just a safety precaution, Tony. Especially after last week.”
“Oh, yes, please make yourself at home, not like I wanted that warmth or anything,” He grumbled, watching PJ snuggle up to Steve’s side, “You’re a brat, you know that? You come in here, take him
“I’m fine, Tony,” Steve said gently, smiling down at his shirt as he tugged on it, “Riddled with holes, but they’re healing. Should be okay by tomorrow, I promise. Clint and Buck took the worst of the damage, as far as I know. How are you holding up? How’s the kid?”
Steve hushed him lightly and gently rubbed his back, reaching up to tug on the hair on the nape of his neck. He stepped back and helped Tony down from the cot, steadying him when he landed on unsteady feet. Tony ducked his head in embarrassment, shifting Peter around again so the babe was nestled upon his shoulder. He was surprised that Peter had been so easy-going, considering how hectic their day had been. Thankful, he pressed a kiss to the babe’s forehead and whispered to him that he was so good, such a sweet little boy—
He moved back out into the bedroom and paused in his step, eyes focused on Steve. The Alpha was turned away from him as he dressed, strapping leather belts across his chest before dragging out a large fur cloak with a lion head hood from the closet, tossing it over his shoulders and tying it on. As if sensing Tony’s gaze, Steve turned around to catch him, an easy smile lighting up his face as he finished arranging his cloak. He looked more like a Warlord with the additional accessories, but Tony could not help but feel a bit naked in comparison.
, Omega,” Steve growled, secretly enjoying Tony’s full-body shiver at his Alpha voice, “I will take care of you. Trust me to do that for you.”
“Oh, are we good now? Okay,” He chuckled, “I’m gonna put my hand on your back, okay? Just so you don’t roll or anything.”
Peter gently kicked a foot into Tony’s stomach and he laughed, laying the baby down so he could undress them both.
kid a book and we’re going to read, because that’s a thing people do with their kids, and I’m going to be a great dad, dammit.”
“Tony, I don’t want you to think that this is a one-off. I can’t do that, not with you, even if that means—”
“I texted Rhodey but he’s still in class and hasn’t gotten back to me yet, and I really need to see Tony right now.”
That doesn’t mean it’s going to go anywhere, though. He’s not going to risk messing up an amazing friendship for confusing feelings he doesn’t even understand himself, especially when he doesn’t know if they’ll last. God knows romance isn’t exactly something he’s familiar with.
“You know, Cap, if you keep frowning like that, your face is going to end up sticking that way,” Clint remarks, swinging his legs up on the table before leaning over to try and steal a cookie from Hulk’s plate. A moment later, Steve hears a crash and a bang beside him, so he figures the attempt was unsuccessful.
For a moment, Steve feels so very small, staring at something he wants but can never be his. In a perfect world, those girls would be giggling over a picture of him and Tony dancing at the gala, but he lost his chance at that too.
Tony’s pretty damn sure Steve knows he’s standing in front of him, but Steve’s eyes don’t move from his book. He licks his thumb before turning to the next page, and Tony feels the back of his neck turn hot.
A misshapen lumpy figure that looks a lot like Tony smothered in three, no, four different blankets. And a purple robe.
After more than a year of living with Steve Rogers, Tony has gotten used to the sight of the man in flannel or plaid. He likes to throw on a t-shirt for his morning runs (Tony’s favorite is the one with the turtle cartoon that has the caption “Shell Yeah!”), but long-sleeved checkered shirts are Steve’s comfort clothing of choice around the Tower.
When he steps out in nothing but an AC/DC shirt and a pair of boxers covered in tiny, red hearts, Steve’s vision nearly whites out. From what he remembers later on, his very first reaction to this was an extremely coherent “hnnngh.”
Tony feels a laugh bubble past his throat to his lips when he realizes just exactly what Steve is trying to say. He presses a hard kiss to Steve’s mouth and laces their fingers together.
“Hey.” Foggy’s hand is warm as it covers Steve’s, and Steve fights the urge to brush a hand across his eyes when he looks back up at Foggy.
“Good.” Steve steals another kiss from Tony’s lips, basking in the sound of his laughter. “Right back atcha.”
“I know you’re my favorite,” Tony says. And maybe he had meant for it to come out as innuendo, but his words turn gentle at the end, entirely sincere and more than a little careful.
“The others have turned in already. I said I’d take the first watch,” Tony continues, voice low. “You should get some sleep.”
“It’s not a fling for me either, Steve. I want more, with you.” Tony blinks and tightens his grip on Steve’s hand. “That is...if you want that too.”
“Well, you certainly haven’t been acting like you consider me your best friend these past few weeks!” Tony yells back, seemingly done with acting calm. “All you’ve done lately is avoid me, ever since I came back from that mission with Natasha. You keep running out on mission debriefs, and blowing me off for our weekly hangouts,” Tony scoffs bitterly. “Last week after truth and dare, I embarrassed you so much that you didn’t even come to movie night, and you always make time for movie night.”
If Tony’s calculations are right, he’ll get Steve to crack in five days. Then, he’ll have his hands full with a gorgeous super soldier in his bed, hopefully for good.
The dark blue material molds itself perfectly around Steve’s legs, accentuating his exquisitely muscled calves. Tony lets his eyes roam freely, eagerly over the unexpected surprise before him. He’s fully aware that he is blatantly checking out Steve at this point, but Tony figures that’s exactly what Steve wants, so he’s not too fussed about it.
That’s the question Tony’s been wanting to ask since Steve’s come close enough for him to see the tiny Iron Man cartoon plastered outside his mostly red hoodie, complete with repulsors and a small helmet, but for some reason, he can’t seem to form words at the moment. Tony knows Steve’s been on a hoodie kick lately - it seems to be a part of his plan to get a rise out of Tony, but Tony never imagined a harmless piece of clothing being used against him like this.
Tony’s hand clenches in Steve’s hair and Steve hears the sound of an unsteady exhale before Tony tilts his face up. Then his mouth is on Steve’s, hot and searching, sending a wave of bliss through Steve’s body as he wraps one hand around Tony’s wrist, sinking further into it as he deepens the angle of the kiss.
Tony’s tone is unmistakably fond, and the warmth of his words wrap around Steve like a homemade comfort, like coming home to a pair of kind eyes and a soft smile at the end of a long day.
Steve pulls his knees up to his chest and folds his arms over them, his heart knocking frantically against his ribs.
“Sorry, Tony, I think I’m going to try and turn in early. Raincheck for next time?” Steve says, trying to inject a note of cheer into his voice.
It’s probably just because he’s not used to them going undercover together, or he’s not used to seeing Tony with someone, that’s all. He pushes the thought aside and turns back to the video feed.
“You think we should put him out of his misery and tell everyone tonight?” Tony asks, eyebrows raised.
“I’ll give it a shot, anything’s better than listening to you whine about it,” Sam offers with a smirk, twirling in his chair on Bucky’s other side.
At this, Foggy freezes, looking apologetic. “Not that you’re not fantastic, or anything. But I’m, well, I have feelings for someone. Annoying feelings that I’m trying really hard to get over, but still.”
And when JARVIS had informed them of Red Skull’s attack, not hearing from Tony on the comms when he’d spoken to the team had hurt more than a punch to the gut, even if he should have expected it. He had gotten so used to them working side by side that Tony’s absence left him off-balance and wrong-footed, made him careless. It had nearly cost them everything.
Steve knows he owes it to himself and his heart to give his feelings a chance, and to trust that their friendship will survive if he’s wrong.
“You should have yelled for me to move, not thrown yourself at me to get me out of the way,” Steve retorts, his breath hitching in his throat as he forces himself not to raise his voice any further.
He looks at Steve. “I’m demiromantic. That means I only experience romantic attraction to someone when I already have a strong emotional connection to them.”
Something in Steve’s expression must give away his seriousness, because Jan scoots closer to put a hand to his arm, and Nat stretches over to nudge his foot with hers.
Sure enough, when Tony looks up, Steve’s standing in front of him. There’s a slight flush to his skin that Tony finds unfairly tempting, one which suggests that this time Steve’s the one who’s had more of Thor’s mead than he meant to. He says a quick hello to Sharon before his gaze latches onto Tony’s face, bright and intense.
There’s a pause, and then Sharon’s next words almost make Tony’s heart stop. “Well, you better figure it out fast, because he’s coming over here.”
“Having a little trouble with your muse there, Cap?” Tony asks, flopping down on the couch next to Steve and turning an interested eye towards his sketchpad.
“I know it’s late, but I was thinking we could order in from Di Napoli, go to the cinema… if you pick a bad movie we can make out for most of it in the back row like we did that time we went to see—”
“God, Steve,” Tony says, letting out a breathless laugh. He leans down until his forehead is touching Steve’s, one hand twisting in the curls at the nape of Steve’s neck.  “I thought I lost my chance.”
Nat hums a sound of agreement from behind a large pile of books on Steve’s desk. Bucky tears his attention away from his and Sam’s impromptu thumb war to add a “God, yes please” to the idea.
Tony’s pacing grinds to halt. “You what?” Something like panic flits across Tony’s face before his expression hardens. Tony flinches away from Steve’s hesitant touch. “What are you talking about?”
Steve steps out of his bathroom suite, running a towel through his hair. He’s barely gotten his pants and shirt on when Tony storms into his room.
Steve’s heart flutters at the sight of Tony’s smile, small but incandescently bright and all for him.
He also dreams of helping Steve shave his scruff when it starts getting too long, spreading the shaving cream carefully with his fingers before oh so gently swiping through Steve’s stubble with the razor so that Steve can feel good.
This is exactly what he wants with Tony. The ease and warmth of knowing each other so well as friends and being able to tease a laugh out of the other person and make them smile, all tangled up with the desire to kiss and touch, to hold him close.
There’s a strange undercurrent to Tony’s words that Steve can’t quite place, and he shifts back to his heels, anxiety sharp in the back of his throat.
Bolstered by this answer, Steve turns back to the computer screen, which is currently showing them footage of Tony and Natasha slow-dancing together, Tony’s hands loose around her waist, Natasha’s face in Tony’s neck. The sight brings back the tight, uncomfortable feeling in Steve’s chest in an instant, and for a moment it feels like there isn’t enough air in the room. Tony’s smiling again, the same soft smile Steve had seen when he had looked at Natasha earlier, but there’s something wistful in his eyes that leaves Steve with an odd ache in his chest.
Tony looks at him with the bright mischievous gleam in his eyes that Steve adores and fears in equal measure. “We could make an announcement… or we could have Clint catch us in here as payback for that time he trapped us in the elevator and then forgot to let us out.”
She laughs. The sound chimes like the sweetest of bells. Steve’s breath catches in his throat before her next question takes it away.
Steve ducks his head, and Tony sees that his ears have turned a little red. He imagines the taste of Steve’s blush, hot and sweet on his tongue, and chokes back a whimper of want.
Steve punches in his access code to Tony’s lab, pausing just long enough to get the sequence right before pushing the door open.
Steve misses the tiny lopsided grin he saw on Tony’s face sometime ago. It was the one and only time he’d tried to teach Steve how to waltz after they’d gotten soused on too much whiskey.
Rhodey throws an arm around Tony’s shoulder and drags him forward. “Come on, you too. I don’t need to ask JARVIS to know it’s been far too long since you’ve had food that isn’t blueberries or some of DUM-E’s green goop.”
“If Thor hadn’t grabbed you at the last second, who knows what could have happened? The armor doesn’t make you invulnerable to time blasts, Tony. I know you like to think that you’re invincible, but you’re not.”
Foggy bites down on his lip with a self-deprecating laugh, and Steve feels a sharp pang of sympathy at the look on his face. He thinks of Tony, and those occasional quiet moments when he wants to lean in and feel their hands brush against each other, or when he wants to tell Tony that everything Steve feels for him is sometimes strange and confusing, but also amazing.
Steve freezes as Tony lets out a swear and takes off. It only takes him a moment to see why - Clint’s falling fast through the air with no signs of stopping.
“Hey, hey. It’s alright. I distracted him well enough before you got there to finish him off, didn’t I? Luring the Bilgesnipe out was a bit of a risk, I’ll admit it, but
Tony’s apparently watching Clint and Bucky engage in a bizarre kind of dance-off. Steve thinks he’s better off knowing as little about this as possible.
“Fine with me,” Steve says, wrapping his arms around Tony’s shoulders. “Just as long as you keep doing that, please.”
Jan’s hand tucks itself into the crook of his elbow, and she nestles closer to his side, letting her head rest on his shoulder for a moment. “I think that’s really great, Steve. I’m sure you’ll find that one day.”
“It was pouring when we were getting here and he kept shivering underneath the umbrella, of course I gave it to him.” Steve doesn’t mention how nice it had been to see Tony wearing his jacket, how the sight of Tony’s arms being dwarfed in his longer sleeves had created a warm, tingly feeling at the bottom of Steve’s stomach, leaving him a little tongue-tied.
He takes another sip of his drink and fiddles with the edge of his paper napkin, brushing a finger over the small sketch he’s been working on in the half hour since he deposited himself at the bar. It’s of Tony, It’s of Tony sporting his hat and bowtie. A sharply-cut suit is a rare look for him, though he looks just as dashing and suave in it as he does on the cover of a
“Boys, quit flirting,” Nat orders, looking back down at her notes. Steve bites back a grin at Bucky’s look of flustered confusion as Jan giggles.
Tony’s face crumples a little and his voice is unsteady as he continues. “If I were a better friend to you, I could be happy for you without staying away from you, but I can’t do it yet, Steve. You’re just so
“I’ve wanted to kiss you since you managed to trick me into thinking you didn’t know about the original trilogy’s Vader twist,” Tony says, swallowing Steve’s chuckle with a kiss.
“She’s amazing,” Steve agrees with a smile. He doesn’t get to see Pepper very often these days with how busy she is, but they still keep up a semi-regular correspondence via text about art, books they’ve managed to read recently, and of course, Tony.
Steve bites back a curse, worry forming like a heavy stone in his stomach. He’s been so wrapped up in trying to manage his feelings for Tony ever since his realization that he’s been putting some distance between them, and now Tony might not be okay.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. And no, that isn’t it. The secret is, you look very dashing in that suit.”
Steve spends the entire night restless and awake after Tony leaves, running his thoughts over his feelings, again and again, unable to keep his mind off of Tony.
Steve receives it in silence. When she inclines her head, he moves forward and whispers his answer in Death’s ear.
Steve halts in the doorway, the sight of a sleepy, barely-awake Tony in the kitchen lifting the last dregs of his bad mood from yesterday.
“Suit yourself, Steve.” The hesitant smile that Tony aims in Steve’s direction is more than worth the loss of a couple hours of sleep, even if Steve grumbles about it in the morning.
Steve glances up and colors when he sees the open doors in front of him. “Thank you, JARVIS,” he answers.
“I know about you and Foggy,” Tony explains. “And I know I should be happy for you, and I am, or I will be, but god, Steve, I just can’t be around you right now.”
From the determined look in Steve’s eyes, Tony knows this isn’t over. Steve Rogers is not one to back down from a challenge - but Tony Stark isn’t either.
Something that feels a little too much like panic spreads through Steve. He swallows hard. He knows there’s nothing romantic between Clint and Tony and that Tony’s been tasked with cake-tasting as Rhodey’s best man for Rhodey and Pepper’s wedding. Yet, somehow, Steve still feels off balance.
The earnest concern on Tony’s face is gratifying, even as Steve feels guilty for sidestepping the truth, though he knows telling Tony the truth would be a worse idea.
The feeling is a familiar one. Steve sinks into it with more than a touch of relief, letting Tony’s proximity put him at ease.
“Here you go, Tones.” Jan reaches over to the side of the bed where Steve’s football jacket is hanging on a clothes hook and tucks it around him. “Don’t hog the duvet.”
Suddenly, the StarkPhone in his pocket starts vibrating rapidly. Steve retrieves it, squinting down at the screen in front of him.
Just then, there’s a loud knock on the door. When Steve opens the door, he’s met with the sight of a half-asleep Tony looking dead on his feet. He’s wearing a LEGO Batman shirt that Steve is pretty sure belongs to Rhodey. There’s a furrow in his brow that Steve is trying really hard not to find adorable.
“It was Cap. My first crush as a kid was on Cap. I had all his posters, made my own model of the shield… I only realized years later that it was my first crush, but yeah.”
“You were magnificent,” Steve replies, because Tony had been, so much that he’d rebuilt his armor and saved himself and the whole team from the Time Stone. He always is, as well as dazzling and brilliant and wonderful and frustrating and the best person Steve knows. The person Steve wants to come home to, always.
Steve easily reads the question in Tony’s scattered words. “I knew you weren’t together but I didn’t like the idea of everyone else believing and wanting you and Clint to be in love.” He swallows. “I hated it.”
“I will wait down the hall to give you privacy,” she said, not taking her eyes off of Steve, “If he tries anything--”
“If it helps, we didn’t know until we—until—” Steve drew in a shaky breath and squeezed Tony’s hand again, wanting nothing more than for his husband to wake up.
“Hey, hey now, I’m right here,” Tony soothed, rubbing circles onto the tot’s back, “You’re okay, honey. You’re safe. I’m not going anywhere.”
Gently, he moved Tony off of him and got up, pressing the heel of his hand against his forehead to stave off an oncoming headache. Tony watched him slowly move around to dress in more traditional clothes, only to growl in annoyance when Steve turned to go. The Alpha froze, sending a wide-eyed look over his shoulder at his Omega.
Feeling a strong domestic urge tug at his heart, Tony kissed the palm of his hand and held it down to PJ, nearly fainting as the boy did the same and put his palm on top of Tony’s hand.
Rather, he stood there, looming over PJ and Tony both, to the point that Tony glared up at him and stood from the chair.
Steve’s eyes narrowed at that, but he didn’t comment, which Tony was thankful for. He stumbled over to his bed, sitting down heavily on the plush comforter as he put his hand up under his own shirt to cover his reactor, feeling the machine whir and his heart thump under his fingertips. Still catching his breath, Tony hung his head, turning his face away when he felt the bed dip as Steve sat next to him.
Tony froze, but he swallowed and nodded, carefully undoing his sash belt and tucking it into his pants. Slowly, he drew out his bundle from under his shirt and cradled it in his arms, slightly undoing the swaddle to show the group. A shocked gasp and murmur ran through them, something that Tony was expecting. Peter paid no mind to the strange response; rather, he stretched and yawned, turning to tuck his head into his father to recapture his warmth. There, on both of their necks were matching bumps, clean and pristine.
“He’s been ogling Steve’s biceps mostly, saying God blessed America and his eyes under his breath,” Bruce replied, not even sparing a glance from his work.
“Confidence, I like it Cap,” Tony said, fake smile slipping off as he turned in his chair. “I’ll take care of your reservation, you go on and ask her out.”
“Yeah?” he said, turning around again to find Steve right there, gazing down at him intently. Had Tony been standing, his knees would have definitely given out on him because the way Steve was looking at him, eyes dark and hungry, Tony wouldn't stand a chance.
“Tony, I-” Steve began but Tony just kept right on, not wanting to hear anything about Cap’s hot date.
where they were?” Clint cried from where he was perched on top of the fridge, presumably searching for the cookies in the wine cabinet there. “That’s just playing dirty Cap.”
“Does it look ridiculous?” Steve asked, shuffling his feet a little, red creeping up from under that wonderfully tight black shirt. “Tasha insisted I at least try it on and next thing I know, we’re walking out the store with it. You know how she is, there’s no fighting her once she makes up her mind.”
"A date,” Tony mumbled, almonds forgotten as they fell out of his hand. “Great, tell him good luck.” Tony plastered a smile on his face, despite no one being there to see it, fake or real.
Tony was tired after the battle with Doom. He had only been asleep for two hours after a nearly a day and a half long bender in his garage when the call came in. All he could think about were the upcoming debriefs and press conferences concerning the doom bots and the destruction and how the Avengers let him get away. For once, he sincerely wished that Richards hadn’t been out of state so that his team would have been the ones dealing with Doom. The only bright side of the whole situation was that Steve was there in uniform, cowl down and hair messy, like how Tony imagines it would look first thing in the morning.
Tony just stared at Steve blankly, not sure he was hearing Steve right. So naturally, he messed up, “Yeah! Hey JARVIS, let the team know we’re getting take out! Common room in 10 minutes!” And when he looked back at Steve, he had the kicked puppy look on his face. “Meet you up there Cap?”
“Aye! I do believe in letting love run its own course,” Thor said, smiling around his mouthful of pop tart crumbs. Tony retreated to the safety of his workshop amid Rhodey’s laughter and Pepper’s ‘I told you so’ look.
“I’m moving to Malibu! Permanently!” Tony exclaimed, dramatically retreating to hide in the penthouse.
Tony finally fell asleep, listening to the stories of Sarah Rogers and her Irish temper and kind heart. And in the morning, when the rest of the team emerged to find Tony, with his head resting on a shirtless Steve’s chest, Steve’s own head cushioned against the back of the couch, they silently went about making breakfast, so as to not disturb the two. And if Natasha snuck a picture of the sleeping pair, well, that was no one’s business really.
Tony knew Steve probably heard the elevator, the minimal sound it made, but he still shuffled over a little louder than normal, as to not scare him when he whispered, “Steve? Everything okay, uh, buddy?”
“Hey Tony,” Steve’s voice cut through the mental dam that was his mind at the moment. Steve was watching Tony with an oddly fond look on his face and suddenly he just wanted to melt into a puddle.
“I’m afraid he’s insisting sir,” JARVIS said, and if an AI could sound amused, Tony swore JARVIS did.
Steve reared back, clearly not expecting that and the roses that had been held out to him went loose in his grip. “Oh, I- gosh Tony, I didn’t mean- I thought- I misread the situation, I’m sorry, I’ll just go.”
It’s a solid plan, a good plan, so Steve has no idea why he’s feeling on edge about it. He keeps his eyes fixed on the huge screen in front of them, absentmindedly registering the way his fingers keep tapping the desk in front of him, and how he keeps shifting his seat every few seconds. It’s a simple enough plan, and he knows that both Tony and Natasha are more than capable of taking care of themselves even if it does go sideways.
Once he’s made sure it’s perfect, Steve steps back with a satisfied smile. He looks up at Tony, only to find Tony already looking at him, a dark, indecipherable look in his eyes that almost makes Steve lose his footing.
Steve sweeps his gaze slowly over Tony’s body, and Tony feels the weight of Steve’s desire as clearly as if Steve had voiced his thoughts out loud. An answering rush of desire courses through Tony, swelling up to meet Steve’s. Steve’s tongue darts out to lick his bottom lip, his eyes still never leaving Tony’s, and Tony finds himself fighting for breath. Who needs oxygen when Steve Rogers is looking at him like
Steve sits up from where he’d been lying sprawled on his bed after they finished their Mamma Mia movie marathon. Jan and Nat are sitting at the end of the bed as Jan braids Nat’s hair, while Sam and Bucky are in the middle of what Steve guesses is their third game of Battleship tonight.
“Someone I didn’t want to lose.” Something in him cracks open, bleeding desperation. Steve thinks it might have been his heart. “Couldn’t afford to lose.”
Putting his book aside, he stands up and strides over to Tony, motioning at him to lift his chin. “You must be dreading this party to want me to go so badly, hmm?”
“It’s great to meet you, Matt,” Steve says, grinning a little when he sees them both blink rapidly before refocusing on him, evidently having gotten caught up in the other person. “Foggy’s been singing your praises.”
Steve gives a watery laugh. “Even if the feelings in question might never be returned and I’d be risking one of my most important friendships if I ever said anything?”
“Damnit, Romanoff. I don’t know why I ever told you that,” Tony mutters, staring down at the empty cup clenched in his suddenly tight fist. Steve watches Tony’s face grow redder by the second, and he’s wondering exactly what Natasha knows that could make Tony Stark blush, when they get Tony’s answer.
Steve gives him what he hopes is a passable smile in return. “JARVIS, would you mind zooming in on the video?” he asks after a moment.
Why else would Tony come to Steve’s room if he wasn’t looking for Steve? As if feeling like an idiot in front of Tony isn’t enough, now he sounds like one too.
Except, he’d saved the file with one single resolution without really giving himself a reason why. Except, as the weeks passed, the simple desire to lean over the dinner table or turn to him when they were sitting next to each other on the couch and kiss Steve stayed warm and bright in his chest. The desire to take his hand and kiss him slow and close in the brightness of Tony’s workshop, or on the street for all to see as they were joking and dealing with clean-up of another mission. Wanting to kiss Steve quickly turned into thinking of ways to make Steve smile, wanting him to smile at Tony, wanting to take care of him, to hold him…
“And what, exactly, were you thinking about when you were supposed to be paying attention during the debrief, hmm?”
It’s true that there’s an undercurrent of something more than friendship in how he’s been looking at Tony for the past few months, though he’s not sure when it happened. He’s not sure when Tony’s laugh became one of the things that can instantly make him smile on a bad day, or when he started learning the meaning behind each of Tony’s different smiles.
“He looked good in your football jacket.”  When Steve looks across at Jan, there’s a tiny grin spreading across her face. He laughs and rubs a hand across his face.
“You’re… not with Nelson?” The disbelief in Tony’s voice is now milder, tinged with an edge of hope, and Steve nods. He slowly reaches out one hand to Tony.
Steve reaches up to cup Tony’s face, warmth spreading through his chest at Tony’s soft expression. “As much as I’ve enjoyed sneaking around, I want to be able to kiss you in front of everyone and have them see what you mean to me,” he answers quietly. Steve lifts Tony’s hand to his mouth for a kiss. “I can’t think of a better birthday present.”
Tony grins at their inside joke, only to watch Sharon’s own grin turn calculating. “Then again, I think maybe someone else might be taking that place now.”
Nat says. Her musings are cut short by an outraged squawk from Tony, who sits back and points an accusing finger at Nat.
“Hey, Tony, looking for me?” Steve asks in what he hopes is a normal tone, before realizing what he just said.
Pepper laughs until she cries over the video. Tony remembers the worried frown on Steve’s face when he’d pulled Tony into his arms and steered him away from the wall.
Some say she takes on the guise of a loved one, and tricks you into giving up what you love the most. Some say she has no face except a mirror image of those who come to her. Some say she’ll laugh in your face and strikes you to the ground with nothing but a lift of her finger, so if you know better you’ll stay away. Then there are those unlucky few who spend their lives searching in vain without a single glimpse of her shadow, meeting her only when their time has run out.
It’s Clint and Tony dancing at last night’s gala. Tony’s head is thrown back in that loud laugh that Steve loves so much as Clint grins at him in the photo.
He wouldn’t want it that way, especially from Tony. The thought had stuck in his mind like a splinter. If it happened, he didn’t want it to be in a crowded room just for show. He wanted it to be real.
Most likely he’d end up on the sidelines, watching Tony in the arms of a different suitor for every dance, and while Steve’s never really been one for dancing himself, the thought of Tony turning on his effortless charm for interested partners leaves a sour, bitter taste in his mouth.
Steve holds back a sigh at Tony’s question, fingers clenching around the stem of his champagne glass.
“I overheard you and Jan talking that night at the party. When you said that you wanted your first kiss to be with someone who really wanted it, I realized that someone was me. And I had all these plans to woo you and I wanted it to be perfect, but then Jan told me about Foggy, and I thought she meant that you two were together now, that I wouldn’t even get a chance to show you how much you mean to me.”
“I mean, you saw me just before we fixed things. I didn’t know what to do and I was terrified that I was going to screw it up, that I was going to lose all of it if the Stone turned me into nothing. My life, the team… you.” The way Tony is looking at him is so bright and full of warmth that it makes Steve think of holding Tony in his arms at night, the soft blue light of the arc reactor bathing his skin with a gorgeous glow.
