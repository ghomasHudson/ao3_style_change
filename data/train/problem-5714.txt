“It’s my apartment too. I just came in.” Bucky paused, before saying, “Also you should probably know. Tony Stark is outside our apartment.”
The fireworks cracked and burned and popped above him, and even though every inch of his body was screaming at him to run, hide, get away, he forced himself instead to focus on Steve’s face, to focus on the feeling of Steve’s hand on top of his own instead of on his racing heartbeat and the memories that threatened to push their way in at any moment. By the look of intense concentration on Steve’s face, he could tell that he was doing the same thing.
“See you around, Steve.”
“Really,” Steve said, his voice a little breathless and just a little hitched. “How would you suggest that?”
Steve turned a little pink before accepting the offered arm, so stiffly it made Tony laugh openly. “Relax, I’m not walking you to the electric chair,” he teased.
“Okay, okay okay,” the blonde in front of him giggled, bending over at the waist to laugh more, some of her beer sloshing out of her cup and onto the floor. Tony couldn’t help but smile, his flush reaching just higher than his cheeks as he took another sip of his own drink. He was at least several steps past drunk, and had no intention of stopping anytime soon.
Maybe New Year’s Eve wasn’t the worst day of the year after all.
It was far from his best snarky comment, but it made Steve smile, which made Tony feel like he’d accomplished something anyway.
“Tony. TONY!”
And then they’d kissed, and it was like nothing Steve had ever felt before. The warmth in his chest, the buzzing in his ears, Tony’s mouth, warm and sweet and tasting of cheap beer and expensive coffee. Tony, up on his toes to reach Steve’s mouth because he was that short, something that he should have laughed at but only made his heart warm even more, and the feeling of Tony’s waist under Steve’s hand, their skin separated only by the flimsy fabric of Tony’s shirt, and  –
“Well ...when you put it that way,” Tony said, stomach churning, and before he could get another word out Steve had bent down (God he was tall, was he always this tall? Tony wasn’t sure) and pressed his lips softly to Tony’s in a warm, chaste kiss, before pulling away. Tony could tell he was blushing by the way his cheeks were burning, and was surprised to find himself wishing that the kiss hadn’t been so sweet.
As much as it killed him to admit it, as much as he would rather stay here all night, against the wall with Steve Rogers, he knew that Rhodey was right. Damn him for being right, and damn whoever had called the cops. And damn the cops who wouldn’t be bought.
Which had caused Steve to flush, and bite his lips, and made Tony Stark’s face swim in his mind, every detail made even more beautiful by his memory. He’d been planning on keeping it a secret from Bucky, mostly because of Stark’s…..reputation, but as soon as Bucky had asked, he’d blurted it out.
“Well?” Steve said, looking vulnerable. The party was starting to die down, guests and their dates beginning to trickle out of the tower while the Avengers began to make their way to their rooms.
dry martini and tried to keep his hand from shaking. Though it wasn’t quite midnight yet, it seemed that the citizens of New York City had fired off a couple of test rounds that had left everyone else in the tower looking up and making sounds of astonishment while Tony had immediately tried to find cover, a hand protectively over the arc reactor on his chest.
that he was used to hearing out in the battlefield. It was something gentler, more tender, and it made his mind stop rushing for a moment and just focus on Steve, right in front of him. He forced himself to meet Steve’s eyes, which seemed to catch him off guard, because he only held Tony’s gaze for a moment before looking away. Normally it would have left him feeling victorious - tonight, it only made him feel worse.
Maybe he’d have to flip a coin for it.
Not that he was shell-shocked, or anything.
The only person who had noticed was Rogers, and though he’d certainly given him a funny look, he at least had the decency not to say anything about it. He was sure Rogers had seen it plenty of times, what with being in the war.
Their mother walked over to them, smiling at people as she walked pass them, before standing in front of her youngest with a knowing look. “I thought the phone rule was iron clad?”
“I guess that’s the one.”
“Hello,” his mother’s voice came over the phone. “Boys stop fighting already and go do your homework.”
“I am... inevitable,” Thanos said as he snapped his fingers, but nothing happened, the Titan shocked as he watched the stones light up in Tony’s hands.
The first half of this made me an emotional mess..... I didn't like writing it at all. NATASHA!!!!!!
“Sure,” Clint answered, he looked between the two of them before walking off towards the café.
Steve hadn’t thought of it that way, he’s only known Tony for a few months, and had spent a while just trying to get to know him pass that disaster that was their first meeting and maybe even the second. “It’s good that you can see that,” Steve said looking at the way Tony smiled at everyone talking about the break, it warmed his heart to watch.
“He deserves to die then,” she said and while Tony would like for it to happen, murder wasn’t something that they could really get away with. But she needed to know the whole story, she needed to know the extent of what happened, because in the end she had always been the one that had stayed by him. His brothers were already out of the house by the time they reached High School, but Natasha had been the one to console him during his break-ups, she had been the one to dance with him in their living room when no one was watching. She was his sister and his best friend all rolled into one person.
“I dropped the ball,” Tony yelled back.
The purple power stone floated in front of them, almost like it was taunting Tony, it had been the same stone that had forced a moon onto him during the fight with Thanos. He had seen its power first hand, as well as the power of the other stone’s in the madman’s possession.
“Yes, they are,” Steve said and they both saw as Vision’s face changed to sadness.
“Who’s they? What are we going?” Scott continued with his questions not caring that he was being ignored.
Steve’s break on the other hand, was spent corralling his brothers, helping his mother, or making sure that nothing went to hell, he was glad to be back on Sunday morning for his shift at Starbucks. For some reason that was more soothing then being at home for the holidays. He loved his family but the house sometimes felt too full when everyone came home, especially since his mother was now on bed rest and his father wasn’t a very good cook, so it was left to Steve to help out with everything while at the same time trying not to ruin dinner. Which according to his mother was the only meal that she got to share with her kids, which was a lie since they had Christmas a month later, but she liked to guilt trip them, especially Hank and Bruce who were both off working at some huge company, in different fields. They’re usually too into their work to actually remember to come home every once and a while for something, anything at all. They were sometimes too into whatever it was that they were researching to actually remember that there were holidays happening at any point in the year.
“Sure,” she said before running off towards the back of the store.
Steve grunted behind him, forcing the bickering twosome to focus on the matter at hand, “Well we traced the fluctuation to another planet, and came up with this,” Rocket said before the screen pulled out and mapped a course towards a planet in a faraway galaxy.
“I hope they like me,” Tony said as he got out of the car, he was practically bouncing up and down, the flowers in hand, his eyes looking between Steve and the house.
“Oh please, the poor little rich boy, it’s my story more than yours you don’t have a claim towards it,” Ty said to him, but Tony only stopped packing when he realized what Ty had said, he had never told Ty who he was, not even that his family had money. “Just because you’re a Stark doesn’t mean you get to have everything.”
“You’re joking right?” she had to be, his father was always hard on him for every little thing, no matter how small it was. There was no way that man would soften up for anything, especially if its something Tony had done.
“Have you slept at all since we saw each other on Monday?”
“Whatever,” Tony said wrangling his pillow back and covering his face with it not wanting to let them see his disappointment. “I’m just going to write my stories and ignore the world until classes start on Monday anyway.”
“Sure, anything you want.”
“I’m still mad at you for getting on that space ship, I told you not to go and you didn’t even listen to me,” she said glaring at Tony. “I may be the C.E.O. but you’re the owner of the company, and don’t get me started on Rogers over here.”
The next time Tony asked he actually reiterated what he had heard, remembering it better than when the professor had taught it in class, and extremely glad to be done with it. It was tiring for some reason, the whole thing in general, especially with Tony so close to him but he actually remembered. Tony got up to stretch once they were done, and Steve couldn’t help but watch the little strip of skin that showed as Tony’s Black Sabbath shirt rode up. He wondered what it would be like to touch it, to feel his hand against Tony’s body. He quickly looked down at his notebook, pretending to study the work and not the slowly growing erecting that he was currently growing in his pants. He needed to think about something else, anything else, but he was so close to Tony that he could kiss him, and he wanted to so badly.
“Let’s go watch a movie,” Kamala said smiling at Morgan.
“I don’t have anything,” he answered knowing that he had to get something else to eat now that his roommate had scarfed down his breakfast and head off to his room just so he could go to the robotics lab. “I’ll see you later,” he called out to Bucky before rushing to get a bagel and another cup of coffee and running off towards the dorm for his backpack.
“We’re Spider Bros,” Miles said which made Tony laugh, since it played on his and Bruce’s science bros joke.
“Not a sidekick, more like a partner, or even a team, Iron Man was mine, but Nat created her own and we wrote stories about this team of superheroes, and we called them the Avengers,” Tony was smiling but he probably didn’t know that he had Steve hooked on this, Steve had always hated the character, and everything that had come with it, but seeing it from Tony’s point of view changed something in him, because what if Captain America wasn’t just one hero, well outside of his brothers own characters that his father had created. What if there was a team there with him? Helping him, instead of the regular comics his dad had been writing for them for years.
Tony had seen what that thing had done to Hulk’s arm, he’s heard from Steve about what it had done to Thanos’s arm five years before. If he did this he knew that he wasn’t going to survive, there was no coming back from this, if had had more time he would have been able to make his suit control the power of the stones, but they hadn’t thought this would have happened.
Everyone worked quickly around him, Tony was taken away leaving Steve sitting on the ground next to Vision’s lifeless body, the one thing they had hope for. It felt hopeless, they had no way of making sure that Vision would wake up, they had no way of knowing if they were going to be able to change everything, all they had was hope and for Steve that hope was slowly dwindling.
“If you don’t mind accompanying me, we can go over to Burger King and eat some food,” he said smiling at her. “My treat.”
“Where do we go from here?”
“Bucky....” he said between breaths. “Bucky... is... alive!”
“Who’s Bucky?” Natasha asked him, and he knew at that point that only Bucky’s close friends called him that, to everyone else he was just James.
“The idea of Captain America was, not me Tony,” Steve said looking at the picture in front of him. Tony knew that this was a blast from the past for him in many ways.
They all looked at the planet highlighted on the table in front of them. No one said a word, and Tony knew it was because none of them were sure about what was happening. They were in uncharted territory, no matter where they looked, they didn’t know where to go next. There were too many of them, too many possibilities, to many chances at messing everything up.
“That I am,” Steve said before licking his way up Tony’s chest, before settling on Tony’s nipple and sucking it into his mouth. It took Tony a minute to realize that while Steve had taken his ring off, Tony’s was still very much on and it was very tight all of a sudden. “I still have your special vibratory in my ass, I wonder if you can feel it in yours.”
“Yeah sure,” Tony pulled the story towards him, still in the notebook which meant that to fix it he would have to type it into his computer, which meant more work for Tony. “What do you think is wrong with it?”
“Just take it easy, and when he comes over, be nice to him,” she said before getting up. “Jarvis is going to stay with you for a little while, I have a meeting with the new batch of students you’ve hired for the S.I. interns, since you’re not going to make it to that now that you’re injured.”
“To our futures,” she said winking at her brother. “May it be filled with love, success, and unlimited happiness.”
He had spent his whole life in New York, the only time he had left was to go to M.I.T. to get his degrees, and when that had been done, he had promptly come back. There was something about the crazy nature of the city that appealed to him, even when his one favorite spot as a kid had been a local bookstore that was run by this little old grandmother. He had hidden in there for years while in high school, and when her grandson had come to help, he had stayed hidden. It wasn’t that he was shy or anything, and maybe he had harbored a crush for the blonde, but that hadn’t mattered, he had been twelve and on his way to graduating high school.
“Okay,” he said to her, giving her a quick hug before she got into the car with Scott and Hope, they were going to New Asgard, they were going to see Bruce and Thor. With a final wave, they drove off and Steve went in search of his husband.
“Whatever, you and your logic over here can leave Cap alone,” Tony said because in a way he was also defending Steve, and while Steve didn’t really need defending from someone who didn’t know him, it was still something he needed to do.
“That’s not the half of it, he has twin sisters on the way, his mother found out that she was pregnant over the summer and told him before left for school this year the kids are due at the end of the year or was it January... I’m not really sure,” Bucky said while his mouth was half full of food, which would be gross to most people, but Thor had been like that when he had lived at home so Tony was used to it. “It’s a risky one though since she’s in her late-forties. His older brothers are really close in age, I think there’s only like nine months between them all, they could practically be twins or triplets or something.”
they can't catch you again. Or me either, for that matter."
And though his mouth felt dry, and his knees a bit weak, the sheer honesty and open vulnerability in Steve’s bright blue eyes left Tony with no choice but to say, “What the hell. Let’s go watch some fireworks.” He quickly checked his watch. One minute to midnight. He offered his arm to Steve. “Shall we?”
He’d managed to escape the party not long after Tony (Bucky had appeared out of nowhere, leading him through the crowded house to a back exit), and had collapsed in his bed shortly after, despite Bucky’s probing questions. He’d woken up at 11:30 am (not bad, considering the night he’d had), to Bucky sitting up in his bed, texting something to someone, and asking about Steve’s night.
He carefully sipped the very last drop of what had been a very,
“Stark, truth or dare?” the blonde asked. He’d known her name at some point – Rhodey had introduced them, but it had gone in one ear and out the other.
A text. A text wasn’t an emergency. A text was an afterthought. He was an afterthought. The fury rose, uncontrollable, choking him and boiling his blood. Fuck you, Tony thinks, and slams the phone shut.
Bucky had rolled his eyes.
“Tony,” Steve said, and it wasn’t the harsh, commanding
1. He was in desperate need of another drink, and
After a few moments, the panic started to subside. The guests around him were laughing, throwing their arms around each other, kissing. Tony let out a shaky exhale, glad the whole ordeal was over. “We made it,” he said with a weak smile.
“Good luck,” Bucky called after him as he left the apartment, shutting the door behind him. He took the stairs down two floors, exited the lobby, and outside was Tony Stark, hands in his pockets, leaning against the building like he owned the place (which, as far as Steve knew, he could). As soon as Tony saw him, he took his hands out of his pockets before shoving them back in almost immediately after. Weird.
He stays down there even when Pepper calls him up to bed, and he sees something shift in her eyes, like she’s remembering why they broke up the first time – because the truth is, he thinks he’s too fucked up for her, that he’s too much of a mess for the force that is Miss Pepper Potts.
He needed to stop this, needed to stop right now because Tony Stark was a playboy, and he was sure that the events of the night before meant nothing to him, even though they meant everything to Steve.
Now Tony really wanted to shrink, because of course he had been so busy throwing up his armor, so busy protecting himself, that he’d forgotten that Steve was a soldier before he was Captain America, that he’d been shot at and seen things that the average person couldn't begin to imagine. Of course he hadn’t been the only one struggling, how stupid of him to assume -
Tony bit down hard on his lip. So maybe he was lying to himself. Maybe, every time he heard a firework that sounded slightly like the missile that had embedded shrapnel in his chest and forced him to have what amounted to open-heart surgery in a
Even in the dim light of the balcony, Tony could see Steve flush just the slightest bit pink.
Tony was mentally engrossed in a plot to perhaps fake his own abduction, when he heard a familiar voice from behind him say, under his breath, “You know, I don’t love fireworks either.”
And Steve had said
And that had been the end of their conversation. And now, Bucky had left, ostensibly to grab some bagels and coffee, and Steve was settled in his bed, drawing Tony’s face in his sketchbook, because it seemed like the only way to stop thinking about what had happened between them the night before.
“Maybe I’m not a nice guy,” Steve said, sipping on his drink and Tony laughed. It seemed Steve knew how to play along – now things were getting interesting. He moved a little closer, and couldn’t help but grin when he noticed that Steve didn’t move away.
But he doesn’t get rid of it because it’s from
Steve braced himself.
Tony’s chest tightened, but he forced himself to take a few deep breaths. This was just the anticipation. The actual fireworks would be worse - he needed to be ready.
She turned a little pink, and Tony smiled into his cup. Rhodey let out a barely audible sigh beside him, but Tony ignored him, all of his energy focused on the girl in front of him. “Kiss……” She trailed off, her eyes scanning the room. The corner of her mouth twitched up, and she pointed. “Him.”
He doesn’t know what to say. It’s been weeks since Steve sent the message – Tony wonders if Steve even remembers he sent it. He wonders absentmindedly if he regrets it. These could very well be the last words he ever says to Steve Rogers, and he wants to make them count.
Steve stared at him for a moment, and Tony resisted the urge to shrink from his glance. He had the feeling, as he so often did, that Rogers was dissecting him, pulling him apart, removing all of the masks he used to carefully hide all the soft and fragile parts of him with those stupid, all-American blue eyes. After a brief moment of silence, Steve added, “Sounds like shells.”
The door to their apartment opened, and Steve jumped, setting his sketchbook down beside him. “You scared me Buck,” he breathed, and Bucky simply shrugged, handing him and iced coffee.
But now Tony doesn’t know what to feel. Whenever he thinks of Steve, it’s a strange cocktail of “Fuck you” and “Come home” that he isn’t sure how to reconcile. Sometimes, when he thinks of Steve, he flips the phone open and stares at the only contact and thinks about calling. When he’s drunk, he almost does. But then Rhodey or Pepper or Happy will mercifully appear out of nowhere (he blames FRIDAY – he always did make his AIs too smart for their own good), and the phone will vanish to his bedside table. He’ll wake up, and see the phone, and the cycle begins again.
All the options swirl around his head.
he thought to himself, but his hand stubbornly refused to move.
. It hurts like Steve had just slammed his shield into Tony’s chest, over and over and over, until Tony couldn’t breathe any longer. Steve had never said anything like that when they were together – never, not even once. Tony had always been the one to say, “I love you,” in the throes of passion, or sleepily curled up in bed next to him, or after Steve saved his life on the battlefield and everyone else thought it was a joke.
“I mean, do you have another explanation for people, as to why we’re standing here holding hands in front of your entire party?” Steve asked seriously. “And I thought that was a tradition, to kiss someone at midnight on New Year’s. It makes sense. Less questions.”
Tony had stood up when it was his turn and said,
Steve hesitated for a moment before taking Tony’s hand and shaking it. Electricity ran up his spine at the touch of Steve’s hand – warm and firm in his own. “So, what’s a nice guy like you doing in a dump like this?” Tony said, winking at Steve. It was a cheap move, but he still felt the same surge of satisfaction when he noticed the slight color in Steve’s cheek.
It's a piece of shit flip phone. He knows he should stick it in a desk drawer and forget about it unless the world goes to hell. Or he should blast it to bits with the repulsors, and watch it shatter into a million tiny pieces. Because it's from Steve. Steve who, in Siberia, straddled him and tore the armor off his face, leaving Tony defenseless, bleeding, and with eyes gone cold had slammed his shield into Tony's chest. The armor had done its best, but Tony had still been bedridden for weeks.
“Look, Tony, I get it –“
That was the extent to which he knew Steve Rogers – his name, his major, and the fact that occasionally when he was bored, Tony would stare at him because he was handsome and it was something to do that wasn’t learning how to do equations he’d known how to do since freshman year of high school.
“Rogers, right?” Tony said, and Steve jumped, clearly having not noticed Tony approach. “Steve. You’re in my…..Calculus?” He offered Steve the drink he’d poured for him.
“Two!”
Tony grinned at him, a beautiful, radiant smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes.
“I just wanted to say…” Steve’s voice trailed off, before he cleared his throat and started again. For a moment Tony could almost see him, the scrawny boy from Brooklyn that Howard had described to him in story after story. “Well, I just wanted to say that I know it’s hard. When people expect things of you that are hard for you to give, and you have to keep up appearances. I had to all the time, I mean ...when I got back, there were fireworks. No one ever figured ….”
he thought to himself.
All Steve could do was sit there in total shock, complete silence. What could Tony be doing outside their apartment, except…..except to tell him that the night before had meant nothing, and to ask that they never speak of it again, pretend it never happened. Maybe even offer him some hush money if he put up a fight. With a sigh, he forced himself out of bed. “Best get this out of the way,” he said grimly.
“How could you,” Lila yelled, she had come from nowhere anyone had seen to a very haggard looking Clint, “You just left us, I’m not supposed to be taking care of everyone Dad.”
Tony walked back into the room, to his scowling boyfriend, and thought of the one thing that Steve did to him just to tire him out enough to go to bed at a decent time. Since Steve breaking the golden rule of superheroing got them into this mess, then Tony is allowed to punish Steve… he could though right. Though he knew that whatever he did to Steve would come back to haunt him in the future, but the man and his stupid moods were enough to drive them all crazy.
“No, sir. I'm, a... visitor from MIT,” he said knowing that his father wouldn’t really care too much about where he was from, what mattered was that he wouldn’t notice just how familiar he looked to the other man.
“Yeah,” Tony said smiling as he put the finishing touches on the draft before sending it to Ty’s email so that he could read it. “It’s interesting to see how it develops, but for now all you have to do is read it and make sure that everything you had before is still in there.”
“Yes, that’s FRIDAY, she wasn’t my first A.I., though I don’t know why they all come out sassy,” he said shrugging his shoulders.
“I’m just going to go,” Sharon said inching towards the door.
Pulling up to his childhood home, made him more nervous, mainly because he hasn’t introduced his parents to anyone that he’s been interested in, not since Bucky and him had broken up. There hadn’t really been anyone that had stuck, not like Tony who had just stormed into his life and changed everything he ever knew. All it took was one look at Tony’s wall, seeing Iron Man and Captain America together, and everything changed from that moment. Tony made his heart race, he talked a mile a minute sometimes, Steve couldn’t understand half of what he was saying but it didn’t matter to him. He liked hearing Tony talk about things that he was passionate about, it’s good to see that kind of fire in a person.
“Everyone get ready for a wild ride,” Tony said trying to make himself feel a little better about what they were about to do.
“Really, remember when we pulled you out of your house because you spoke with my mom, and you worked hard yes, but at the same time you were freaking out about being at home in time before the Marshals came and you ended up in back in the raft, but we got you back in time, no problem.”
“Just tell me who it is?” Sam asked pushing for answers, and he knew that Sam would ask questions, it’s been a while since Steve even thought about dating, everyone thought that him and Sharon had a thing, they didn’t but since Steve hadn’t jumped on it and stopped the rumors, the whole debate over whether or not they were dating had become fueled to everyone because Steve hadn’t confirmed the relationship or denied it either. He wished that he had denied the whole thing from the beginning so that things like this wouldn’t keep happening to him.
“I thought you said five,” he said already complaining as Nat and Jan both plopped themselves down on his bed. “I wanted to get some sleep at least.”
“Like how she got those powers of hers,” Natasha said.
“So,” Steve said after five minutes had passed, Tony could see the unholy glee in Steve’s eyes, because he knew that they were right, and Tony would have to tell him.
“Let them have a moment,” Tony said as everyone gathered inside. “We’ll reconvene in an hour, FRIDAY, order some food for everyone here,” he called out to his AI before pulling Steve along with him. “Chinese would be good, and maybe Pizza if people don’t want that.”
The moment that Steve walked into the room Tony almost jumped out of his skin, mainly because he hadn’t been paying too much attention until he felt a warm cup on his face. Tony already knows that it’s the same one that Steve had made him before, he can taste it before it’s even in his mouth and he’s too excited about it.
“Why don’t you like Captain America?” Tony couldn’t help but see how Steve had stiffened at that question, and Tony knew that it seemed as if it were a sore subject, but he really just wanted to know so that he wouldn’t be stepping around the whole topic when it came to Steve. “You don’t have to answer it, I was just curious.”
“Oh, hi Steve,” the other guy said smiling while his glasses slid down his face, his big brown eyes drawing Steve in, which was bad, he couldn’t get into a relationship with Bucky’s roommate, what would happen if it didn’t work out. “I’m Tony.”
“He's not wrong Nat, I’m scared too,” he told them.
Steve got up without thinking, he needed a moment, so he just got up and followed Tony to the door and walking with him towards the dorm’s back doors surprising Tony. “Hey Tony... um...,” he said stopping the younger man for a moment. “If you get out late call me, I’ll come and pick you up,” he couldn’t understand what compelled him to say that, Tony had said date, which meant that the other person would want to walk back together. He felt so stupid, but he said it and now he wanted to commit to it.
“We didn’t know what would have happened with this, they could have gotten hurt,” he told him and Steve took his hand. “I can’t lose them too.”
When he had heard that little old Mrs. Rogers was about to lose the store, Tony had started his own company, he had been sixteen and at school, but had come home for the summer to hang out with Pepper, May, Jan and Rhodey, all of which were twenty and for some reason were okay with having a sixteen year old troublemaker as a friend. He had started Resilient that summer, it was a part of Stark Industries, but it worked on technologies that helped countries that needed medical help or making long lasting solutions to some of the world’s biggest problems. He honestly didn’t want to be known for making weapons, but he had used his own inheritance to buy one New York City block its buildings and all, modernize the structures and make them more eco-friendly, so that Mrs. Rogers could keep running her store. She had treated him like one of her own, and he was going to protect her like she was his own grandmother.
“I know Tony,” he said before pulling the man he loved into his arms. “Trust me I know, but I also know that if we had the chance to give them back their families, that we should take it.”
Before he could answer, the man put him in a chokehold as if he were trying to get the answer out of him by rendering him unconscious. He had to think fast, before he couldn’t breathe anymore and Hydra ended up with a second Captain America.
“How long were we down there,” Tony said as the sun hung over them, warming up the air around the large group of travelers. “I was sure we were only down there for a few hours.”
“Thor,” Tony said stopping the other man from taking his drink, “You’ve been going a little heavy there with the booze.”
“Shit,” she said again and Tony wanted nothing more than to hit his own head against the table. Steve was going to kill him.
Maybe he should start from the beginning, or at least the beginning for his family, you see while Tony is the only biological child of Howard and Maria Stark, he’s not their only child. He’s the youngest of five, in a rowdy household, the oldest being Thor, who was ten years older than Tony and the protective big brother over all of them, even though he had an unhealthy obsession with pop tarts, but that didn’t matter. The next is Loki, who is actually Thor’s biological brother, the two had been adopted at the age of five and three, when their parents had died in a housefire. Their parents had been good friends with Howard and Maria, so when Maria had trouble conceiving, they had decided that adopting the two brothers would be the next best solution. Howard needed heirs to Stark Industries, and Maria loved the boys as if they were her own.
There were only two people that came to mind for Steve, one was currently in New Asgard, the other was at home blissfully unaware of what was happening. Steve wasn’t sure if he wanted Tony to know about this, their lives had been good for the last few years, and the thought of losing it all and reliving so much of what had happened scared him. But he also knew that he needed to speak with his husband, they needed to figure this out, because there was always one thing that he thought about over the years and that was the question of their kids. About whether life would have been a lot better if they hadn’t lost their families, he didn’t want to lose them, but if he could give them their families back, he would in a heartbeat.
They stood there, Bruce introducing his boyfriend, who also happened to be a Stark, to his family, and Steve couldn’t help but think just how small the world really was. Even as his father called them into the room to introduce his sisters to the world, knowing in the back of his head how his father was already thinking of creating characters for them.
He could do this, he could keep Riri from saying anything, and then he heard Kamala say, “What happened to the TV?”
They stopped far enough away that no one was around to hear them, but close enough in case they were needed. He saw the worried look in Carol’s eyes and he wasn’t sure why, it could be nerves just like any one of them, but there was something else there that he couldn’t place.
“Window’s closing, pull my pin,” he said just as he heard Scott on the other side.
Of course, this had started a catalyst in the Stark house, because a few years later they adopted a little boy named Clint, who as it turned out would be as much of a trouble maker as Loki had turned out to be. The two were barely months apart in age and there had been times when Jarvis, the family butler, and Ana, his wife and the family chef, had been at their wits end with the two. But the house had never been so alive, and it gave Howard a reason to act like a father to the three rowdy boys. Maria often times watched them as they blew up one thing or another, laughing at the antics of her boys, it had been one of the reasons why they had moved to a different part of the city, buying up an entire city block to create their home. That sprawling New York mansion that to this day feels too big for anyone to live in.
“You know,” he started, “There’s a chance that you might have to kill your own father.”
“No,” he said before pulling Tony further into the room. “We’re not having this conversation, whatever they do in their personal time is up to them and if they want to tell us they will.”
“You look familiar,” she said to Tony who just gave her a warm smile.
“Alright everyone,” the professor said as he walked in through the door, getting the classes attention Tony looking at the professor with an excited glee rushing through him. “My name is Professor Phil Coulson and welcome to Fiction Writing.”
“Steve when I broke it off with you, you were at my door an hour later trying to fix things, I know I had been the one to break it off, but I hadn’t expected you to try to fix it so quickly, and then I had to break your heart even more. I sometimes wish we had never dated because even now you don’t treat me like you did when we had just been friends, you act like you’re going to lose our friendship all over again if you say or do the wrong thing.”
“Yeah well maybe it’s time that someone made you work for it you’ve had it easy for far too long.”
His roommate would arrive the next day, the freshmen had to be there on Friday, while everyone else moved in on Saturday, though Tony wasn’t sure why his roommate was a junior, but he took it in stride. He had three older brothers, he would survive a few months with his roommate, it wouldn’t be that bad. He didn’t really go to bed that night, the bed feeling too new, the room too bare, he spent the night putting up his Captain America art, as well as some Iron Man art that one of his readers had done for him. It had been strange at first, that someone had loved his stories so much that they had wanted to draw it. He had drawn a few renderings of the first armors, the ones mentioned, and then others had taken them and drew them with Captain America for him. Those were the ones he loved the most, and the ones that were sitting above his desk as he started the next chapter of his story, he wanted to finish writing it before the final volume was published in May.
I choose Nat and Tony to tell this part of story, well they were the two most effected by the stones, mainly because in the movie they were the ones that died.
“You like talking about the things you create,” Steve told him, and Tony could feel him smile against his hair, as his breathing changed. “I noticed it when you first started talking about your story, the first time I asked you to tutor me, it’s actually nice to see someone so passionate about something.”
“Yeah, but he eats now, I’m guessing it has to do with his roommate, but also with you, because most likely he asked all kinds of questions about you during those dinners with James,” He knew he was turning into a tomato but that didn’t stop her from talking. “He thought that you were dating your roommate first, and when that didn’t turn out to be true, he thought that it was Sharon, though I did fail to mention that it was the same Sharon he knew.”
They did just that, they were just going to focus on themselves and keeping their little family safe. Riri and Kamala became fast friends, which was something that they both needed, someone to be there for them. With Steve and Tony as their foster dads, life at the lake house had become strangely fascinating for the four of them. Their family growing, everyone had lost someone close to them, they were all finding their way to move forward. Tony smiled when he would hear the girls laughing in their room, it felt nice to give someone hope again, to give them the chance to be happy again.
If there was one thing that Steve knew about America, was that she’s a year younger than Miles, and he knew that she wasn’t inclined to be around others very often, but she had befriended Miles when he had gone to NYU, and Miles tries to bring her out of her shell every so often. Steve liked that Miles was making friends, even more so that he was trying to help those friends in the same way that his pops and his dad had helped him.
“So, what now?” Tony asked him as he climbed up the stairs to the house.
“Yeah sure man,” Clint said, Darcy not far behind him with a bag of ice from the café.
Before Tony could say anything, his professor was surrounded by students, and Tony was afraid that he had done something wrong again, but he knew he hadn’t, the story had been perfect. He knew that he shouldn’t freak out, but he was going through a million possible scenarios in his head about what could have gone wrong. If he had been paying attention, he would have noticed that someone was following him to the professor’s office, it wasn’t until Ty’s stupid grin was right in front of him that Tony realized that whatever it was that was going to happen it somehow involved Ty and it wasn’t going to end well.
“But I didn’t want to, because it was something that you gave me, it was a piece of our relationship and I need to preserve it so that when someone asked me one day why I fell in love with you I can always tell them about that one time you write binary code on a twenty dollar bill.”
Introducing Wanda into the story, plus her and Sam being into the ghost hunting shows was something that I made up in my head, but would also be stupidly funny to think about.
“Dad’s not going to like this is he,” Riri said smiling at him.
Steve didn’t miss how America automatically hugged Lila, which meant that Lila was the girl that America had been talking about. They had all grown, found friends, and some had even fallen in love, this was what they were trying to protect. He didn’t know what to do about them showing up, they were all grown up enough to make their own decisions about what they wanted to do regardless of what he or Tony thought.
“You’re repeating yourseld,” Scott said and all Steve could think was that he was trapped in a fight between his kids/ “You’re repeating yourself. - No! - Come on. You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist.”
“Where could we all go that won’t kill our budget,” May asked as she took Tony’s Orange Chicken from him and threw it on her plate before he could get it back.
“Rumlow,” he says watching as the men around him all started getting suspicious of him. “I just got a call from the Secretary. I’m going to be running point on the scepter.”
“Carol, are we seeing you here next month?” Natasha moved onto the next topic without preamble.
"Riri told me to come and save you,” she said as he picked her up. Which also meant that his girls had been listening, Riri more than Kamala would know the ramifications of doing this crazy plan without being absolutely certain. They had all lost a lot over the years, they weren’t willing to lose anything else.
“Miles I have your dad for that,” Tony answered keeping his eyes on the road, he wanted them somewhere safe, nowhere near where they were in case something happened.
“I’m not, he wants to know if we would be willing to carry on with not only Captain America but introducing Iron Man and everyone else into the comics, and having me and you, and probably anyone else who wants to be involved, starting up the Avengers comic run.”
“Okay,” Tony said, but neither made an effort to move, both of them seeking comfort in each other’s arms just for that moment. Steve knew that a small trip, just to give them a reprieve, was all that was needed, and when they got back to work, they would find a way to help everyone recover.
“Are you regretting leaving Titan without being able to stop him?”
“Why do you do that? You can’t afford to replace that door,” Steve said quickly standing away from Tony’s side of the room, feeling self-conscience about being there especially when Tony had left the room angry.
At those words Steve pressed down on Tony’s watch, which was now on his hand, until it was cranked all the way up. Tony hadn’t thought it was possible to feel something like that, but fucking hell with the way Steve was plowing into him while biting down on his nipple, he could feel everything that was happening.
“Air Force, we trained at the same base a long time ago,” Rhodes answered, a hint of something more there, but Steve knew that it wasn’t his place to ask, instead he nodded his head and motioning for them to follow, Nebula walking towards the far end of the conference room that they had been working out of until Tony had come back, Sharon and Nat were working on finding out who lived amongst the heroes that they knew. Behind him Rhodes and their newest arrival talked in hushed tones, before putting quieting as they approached the table.
He thought about it for a moment before turning towards her. “I’ll be fine, there’s a lot of things that could have happened, but I trust Steve, and if you didn’t maim him after I left then that night, then means that he’s telling the truth.”
“That he is,” she sat down next to him looking out at the space Tony had once occupied. “Peter, in a way I think, reminded him of himself, that curious energy that Tony carries with him. I think if it were possible, Peter would have been Tony’s son, they’re both crazy smart and have the tendency to get themselves in trouble.”
“I hope so,” Steve answered with a smile. “I’ll have to see when I take the test.”
Walking into the house and seeing it from Tony’s eyes was one thing that Steve had never thought about before now. The living room was the first thing you saw, the dining room was turned into a makeshift study area before the door to the kitchen. All of the people who lived in the house played baseball, but they were all on scholarship as well, so they had to study no matter what to keep their grades up. They only had parties at the end of the semester, and if they won a game during the season, other than those days the house was pretty quiet give or take the random sessions of them playing on one of the video game consoles.
“Do I even want to know how you five all fit in there?” he asked as they all tried to recover from the fall. “Or better yet why you’re all here in the first place?”
“I’m not a baby anymore,” he grumbled, his head was killing him, and he was glad that his students had a long weekend, because he wasn’t ready to deal with them just yet.
“There’s this kid, he’s about your age in fact, he’s really smart and a little hyper, and if you and him ever got together you’d be a terror to us all,” he said thinking about Peter and the whole incident with the Vulture, and how guilty Tony felt for taking the suit away from Peter when he so quickly put himself in danger. “He’s also Spiderman.”
“Now they’re leaving me,” Tony said his voice sad, it had been nearly five years since the snap, five years of them all growing and getting to know each other.
“It’s not too simple is it?” he asked still a little wary about what he put together, but he knew that Tony liked it just from the way he was looking around.
“Do we know if she had family?” Shuri asked, she was one of the few people who had been friends with Natasha over the years.
“Too late,” the tell-tale voice of Ms. Potts sounded off from the back of the group.
“When were they both there?” Steve asked knowing that Scott was about two seconds from trying to stop them from doing whatever it was that they were about to do.
“Anyway, I thought I should come here and apologize for my picture posts,” Stark said and Steve knew that someone was messing with him, there was no way that Tony Stark actually came into the store. “Someone told me to stop being stupid and actually talk to you.”
“I love you 3000,” she said and his heart was ready to burst, he really loved his kids if they could give him the kind of joy that he never had with his own parents.
“They’ll come home,” Steve said hugging his husband. “They always do, plus I taught them to drive.”
“I’ll answer it in the future, when we’re better friends,” Steve told him, rubbing the back of his neck as if he were struggling with the answer.
The last person to speak to the group was a young Latin woman, she had only started coming to the meetings a few months before, but Steve knew that she wanted to say somethings, and while she had only shared the basics of her life at first, she had finally opened up.
“Thanks,” Tony said before he started walking forward.
She would too, and he knew it, for some reason their parents had indulged her in her love for knives and he couldn’t understand why. He knew it was because it meant that she could defend herself, but she when threatened him with bodily harm if he tried to get out of something then it was just going too far. His sister was a scary person sometimes and he never crossed her, not matter how tired he was because he valued his life.
As they walked out, he saw DUM-E and U rolling around grabbing papers off the floor that had been knocked over while they played, U grabbing the broom and sweeping up the floor. This was his home, made up of a group of dysfunctional bots who he loved like his children, and a group of wayward heroes that became his family. Even when they fought one another, even when they disagreed over what to watch on their random movie nights, this was his family and it was one he came to on his own.
Tony was excited for Steve, but he was also nervous, he knew the risks that Steve’s mother was taking just to have the babies, there was also the fact that Steve worries, he doesn’t tell Tony that he worries, but Tony knows.
“Just a moment.”
“It’s good,” he said with a smile before taking a deeper drink in hopes of hiding his face.
So, that summer, once Steve moved back to New York and into the upstairs apartment his Nana had left for him, because Brooklyn was too expensive to live in, and she had the apartment so why should he have to look for a place to stay. She was always taking care of him and he was honestly grateful for it, he had enough saved up because of this to remodel the store. After seeing his Nana off at the airport, she was going to live with his parents in Florida, his father worked down there as a liaison between the company he worked for called Resilient and Nasa. It took two months to make the whole thing work, they needed permission from the owner, even though Nana had said that they would be alright with the remodel, they needed supplies, and lastly, they needed more workers for the expanded space. The store before had only been run by his Nana and two other people, both of which had decided to work somewhere else.
“I will,” she said to him as the cradle pulsed behind her. “He should be up by the end of the day.”
“Yeah,” Steve answered, not as cranky as before. “Natasha and I talked while we ate, and she gave them to me. I’m sorry for being a brat the other day.”
“Yeah, it’s just... Nat I have to prepare myself for this, because if I see Laura, I don’t know what I would do,” he said and they all knew it was something any of them would have struggled with if they were in his shoes. “Let's just get this over with,” Clint said looking at all of the people who had gathered around them.
The elevator only had one other occupant, and since Steve’s picture had been in the facility, Tony tried his best to shield his husband from being noticed too much. There was also the fact that he was a possessive son of a bitch, and having SHIELD find Steve standing right there in front of them would cause Tony to lose his husband.
“Yeah... Sullivan Street... hmmm... Bleecker,” Bruce said to them as if it would help.
“That’s just you being you, honestly, I think you will change the world in a few years, but I’ll go, and if Natasha hasn’t kill Bucky by then he should go too.”
That was the last time Tony had shared anything like that with his father, his mother knew everything, eventually calming down dear old dad, but in the end the damage had been done. That night Tony had started on his first robot, a little desk helper bot named Butterfingers, mainly because he had been eating a butterfingers candy at the time he had finished. He hadn’t shown his dad, and the little bot now sat on his desk here at college, helping him when he was working on a new project, whenever he was stuck on his writing, or even just eating a granola bar. The little bot cleaned up after him, sweeping away the crumbs from Tony’s snacks or pushing away the wads of paper balls until they were in the trash bin on the side of his desk. She was Tony’s first real friend outside of his family and the friends he had made in school or those that had associated with him just because he was a Stark. Butterfingers was Tony’s child and he was alright with that. Maybe one day he could make the little girl some brothers too.
“I haven't,” Scott said raising his hand. “I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.”
“Fuck you Rogers.”
“Wasn’t there a guy in Hot Tub Time Machine that looked like the Winter Soldier,” Clint said making everyone stop and look at him. “What, you know I’m right, hell I’m sure if we gave the guy Barnes’ haircut it would be an exact replica.”
If he needed something to make sure that what had happened that night had been real, it had happened a few hours later, as the sun was rising over the horizon, and Bucky slammed the door wide open and startled the two of them out of their sleep with the loud thud of his bag.
His phone ringing soon afterwards, reminding him that he had a morning shift at his job, “Fuck,” Steve said before grabbing his stuff. “I have to go or I’m going to be late,” he called out to Tony. “I’ll call you later so we can talk, or you can stop by the house tomorrow, we’re having an end of semester party.”
“I wonder just how small it really is,” Sharon said before going back to her spot next to Sam. “Especially with all of the misunderstandings going around.”
With his glasses on and FRIDAY in his ear, it hadn’t taken him very long to find the lab that held the tesseract, which only made the lack of security a little troubling. He remembered that the tesseract would burn his skin if he touched it, so he was careful to put it in the case he had secured on the way there, using one of the Iron Man gauntlets which had formed on his hand.
“Yeah well it was true,” Steve said rubbing Tony’s back.
There was something about hearing Tony say things like that that made Steve happy, mainly because Steve never thought about his parents that way. When you’re a child you always just see them as parents, people you look up to until the next person comes along that catches your interest. Children have short attention spans when it comes to certain things, but their parents are a constant in their lives. Steve wondered when he stopped seeing his parents as heroes, and just saw them as mom and dad.
“They say that the body changes once every seven years, so maybe your body just did what it had to for you to get to where you are.”
Steve had made his way to the kitchen, mainly to get away from all of the noise and to get something to eat, he was debating whether or not he should just leave and go hang out with Tony. Deciding that he would have a better time just hanging out with Tony, even if all Tony would talk about was his project, he grabbed some food and went to look for a bag to put them in smiling as he did it. He was about to leave, when the door swung open behind him and all of a sudden Sharon was standing in front of him with a smile on her face.
“I know, and we’ll try our best,” Steve told him before pulling away and kissing him. “Now let's do this and when the kids come over, we’ll watch a movie and ignore the fact that tomorrow morning while they’re in bed, we’ll be attempting to change the universe.”
Tony spent most of the morning finishing his story after Steve had gone off to work after making sure that Tony had gotten breakfast before promising to pick him up that afternoon. Well it was more like Steve pulling him towards the dining hall, getting coffee into his system just to wake him up. It was strange to think that they were together, stranger now because they’re having their first official date. But there was that goofy grin on Steve’s face once Tony was fully awake that reminded him that this was real, and he was all for this if that’s what it took to have Steve look at him like that.
“Aww buttercup, you just miss Carol,” Tony said as he hugged his best friend. “Don’t worry she’s on her way, probably will show up glowing and everything.”
“Call me the moment he wakes up, I want to know what he says, or if he remembers anything.”
That got Steve’s attention, “What,” he was about to say but was interrupted by Scott’s rant.
“I got the scepter,” he said as he walked away from the elevator, the scepter in his hand, he knew he had to move fast before someone realized that he wasn’t their Steve Rogers.
“Got it,” Steve’s voice came over the ear piece. “I’m approaching the elevator now.”
“You should get on my dick and get this whole thing over with,” Steve said, and Tony knew that cranky Steve was back and ready to mess with him.
“I like that there’s a possibility that I can look at them and the person I like would be looking at the same stars as I am, that we could live under the same sky and one day find each other.”
“Well that guy is a major dirtbag if his father told him to use you to get that deal to happen, mainly because they would have just used your name and then say something about how you love the idea even if you’ve never heard about it.”
“And most likely second guessing yourself in the process. Just go, I know he would want to see you, and if you’re trying this hard to look your best you want to see him too.”
“Why you up?” she asked him as she climbed onto his lap.
“Okay now onto other matters,” Tony said as he pulled out Steve’s Shield, the same one that he hadn’t taken with him on the first trip to find the stones.
They moved from their spaces and gathered snacks, Tony went to the fridge in search of some blueberries, because if Steve was going to force the healthy stuff on him, then he was going to have something he liked. Shuri set up the next stone on the screen, a bag of treats already in front of her. Tony walked over and sat down next to her, placing some fruits in front of her as well.
The first thing that came to mind was that there was something heavy on top of him, that’s what happens when a building collapsed on you of course. The second thing was that his friends and family were also trapped under the rubble, he knew Steve was close but how much weight could the super soldier take on top of him. How much could his kids take, he didn’t know where they were, only that Steve had told him that they were somewhere in the compound waiting for punishment for breaking the rules and following them. He was grounding them until they were forty for even showing up, it was the only thing he could think because the thought of losing them after all of this was just too much to handle.
Steve looked to see that Clint and Bruce had joined Natasha and Rhodes, which he hadn’t realized how public that little kiss had become.
“Why the long face?” he said while rolling down the window, the trip home had taken longer than it should have, but that was because he had to deal with a cranky Morgan, who wasn’t happy that her fathers were going somewhere without her. She hung out with her sibling's way too much for Tony’s sake, well at that point anyway. “Let me guess, Lang turned into a baby.”
“Let get to work,” he said getting up as Bruce and Shuri began to move towards the door, the two of them talking in hushed tones about the calculations that Tony had been working on the night before. There was no stopping Steve from remembering what his husband had said, the conflict in his eyes, they were risking more than their own lives here, they were risking everything that they had spent five years working towards.
It had been barely a few seconds before Clint rematerialized on the glass platform, he was panting, his hands on his knees before he buckled and hit the glass panels on the ground. Natasha was the first to get to Clint while the rest of them hovered over them.
He knew he was in for another round of this as he pulled into the McDonalds that was in between the New Avengers Facility and Pepper’s house, and if he had to hear them arguing their point, he was going to need some coffee. He was going to need a lot of coffee to deal with three superpowered teenagers. He ordered breakfast sandwiches for all of them and two of the largest coffee he could get for himself. Even after his conversation with Steve the night before he had stayed up all night working on the safest way for them to time travel. FRIDAY was fabricating the devices so that he would be able to pick them up on his way back.
“So, I’m guessing that even though Scott was placing all of the blame on you, it wasn’t really your fault that it had happened the way it did.”
Tony was the first to take flight, Thor not far behind, they both wanted blood, now more than ever, they had lost too much, even now years after the decimation they were still losing those they cared for, all because they wanted to bring everyone back. The hits weren’t going through, he wasn’t sure how much they were going to have to work for it, but they needed to keep it going. Just the thought that somewhere was that stupid Chitari army, Thanos’ attack dogs, all of it, and everyone they cared about, all of their lives were on the line.
She looked different than Tony remembered, but he really didn’t remember much from the time, he had just started running Stark Industries and was dealing with so much loss. He was lucky he remembered anything that happened in the early nineties, he was sure that there had been some kind of explosion on the highway or something, but he really couldn’t remember. Something about a huge fight happening between an old lady and some woman, but it was before cell phones were really a thing, so no one really knew what had happened. Tony had just brushed it off, he had had bigger things to worry about.
The mention of Clint made Steve tense and Tony knew it was because Clint out of all of them was having an even harder time moving forward. “I wish there was more we could do for him,” Steve said as he rested his head against Tony’s. “It’s not fair that we can have all of this and he’s still struggling.”
Steve didn’t ask a single question, just taking Tony’s hand in his and smiling back at Tony’s Professor just for giving his boyfriend something to smile about. They had been in this relationship for two weeks, known one another for months now, and this moment was how he knew that he was truly falling in love. Someone else had given him this gift, and he wasn’t going to take it for granted, instead planning their afternoon in his head, driving Tony to one of the local restaurants, having dinner. None of this is what actually happened, instead they just went to the dining hall and Tony told him everything that had happened in the office, his arms going everywhere, all the while Steve just looked at him with a fond expression.
“I’ll tell Thor everything I know about you and then some if you start with me Banner,” Tony said before turning back towards his project.
The class was an exciting one, even on the first day, they talked about their first writing assignment which was due at the end of September, a collaborative assignment that was their midterm assignment, as well as the final project, which Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for, and it was only the first week. He could write ten thousand words any day of the week, but it’s usually in fanfiction, he’s never written an original piece like the one that the professor was asking for. He had said up to ten thousand words, but Tony wasn’t even sure what he should write about, he wasn’t sure of anything at the moment. It was exciting and he had made a friend so that was great too.
Pepper had finally looked up to see that she had been facing Steve and not Tony, “Who are you,” she said before he pulled Steve’s hand towards him, “Oh my god Tony what happened, are you in an ambulance? are you alright? Should I call your mother?”
Steve sighed before moving forward. “Tony, I’m sorry.”
“Okay, stop,” Tony said to Peter before ripping off a piece of paper from the flowers and writing down a complicated code of some kind before handing it off to Peter. “Try that and then we’ll talk.”
“You act like we’ve never done this before,” Steve said it as a joke, because Tony knows the last time that they had tried to do something before the kids got back, they had almost gotten caught with their literal pants down.
“I’m an only child so I wouldn’t really know, but since I was always at Steve’s house, it was like having an insanely large extended family,” Bucky told him with a smile, and it made Tony wonder the why of his relationship with Steve and why it hadn’t worked out according to Jan. “What are you planning on majoring in?”
If there was one thing that Steve was certain of, it was that he hated Captain America, he was still at home, it was too early to function, but he could hear his father on the phone with his editors in New York, as they planned the end of the series. His father had created the character, naming it after his son as the public called him, because he wanted Steve to have someone to look up to. It was also because he had the idea of Steve growing up to be a big strong person, who took care of others, a man with a moral compass and a love for his country. What Steve wished hadn’t happened was his father’s need to put those ideals on him from the beginning, though he had a love for art like his father, he didn’t want to work on comic books at all.
“I can take care of people when I want to, plus I’m not the one cooking, Sharon and Pepper pulled a bunch of us left over into the kitchen and we pulled out the barbecue and started making things outside. We figured that the two of you need some fresh air.”
Feeling daring, Tony smiled up at Steve, feeling more like himself than he had all evening. “I think I need you around tonight. You know, in case there are more fireworks.”
Maybe his eyes were playing tricks on him, but he could have sworn that a little pink rose to Tony’s cheeks. “Is that a yes?” he said, and for a moment, the façade slipped, and he saw something that almost looked like worry in Tony’s eyes.
Steve stood there, in utter shock for the second time that morning. So he wasn’t crazy. The kiss had been something after all. He hadn’t been crazy to replay it over and over in his head, hell, Tony had been doing the same thing.
Tony flinched despite the fact that he’d known Steve had seen him earlier. Regaining his composure, he turned and said smoothly, “Funnily enough, I can’t remember asking you. But I’m sure if Captain America doesn’t like the fireworks, the entire city of New York, hell, the United States of America, can cancel New Year’s Eve.”
And it fucking
“I’ve already got something to drink,” Steve said quietly, and Tony felt an odd surge of frustration. He poured the beer into the cup Steve was already holding and tossed the empty one over his shoulder.
“W-what?” Tony stuttered. “I -”
Before the party, Steve had only known of Tony Stark. How could he not know him? Son of Howard and Maria Stark, born into one of the richest families in the world, heir to the multibillion dollar weapons company Stark Industries. They all knew Tony Stark. Steve had a class with him after all, some awful Calculus class that he needed to sludge through in order to graduate. And then last night, Tony had come up to him at the party. Flirted with him. And he’d flirted back. And then……
“Happy New Year!”
“We made it,” Steve repeated softly. He still didn’t move his hand.
“Easy,” Tony said, throwing back the last of his drink and moving to the keg, pouring himself more beer and figuring he’d better grab one for Steve too (even though he saw him holding one already). He glanced back at his group, all of whom were staring at him, silently urging him on. He waved them off before sidling up to Steve.
“A joke? Out of Steve Rogers? Somebody call the papers,” Tony teased as they stepped onto the balcony with the rest of the party. He checked his watch. Thirty seconds to midnight.
“Three!”
The message lingers in the back of his mind, and he’s always thinking about it. What could he have to say to him, after all this time? Tony rubs his chest absentmindedly, a phantom ache that he can’t ever quite shake. He suddenly wonders if Howard would have taken Steve’s side. The hero he created or the son he despised? He takes a deep, steadying breath, and retreats to his workshop for his fallback – the suits. He’ll build a thousand of them if it means keeping Steve Rogers out of his head.
“I...um, thanks. For everything. I wouldn’t have made it through tonight without you.”
But then Siberia happened, and things got complicated. Not that they weren’t before – fucking your childhood idol while being in love with him but not knowing exactly how he felt about you while the two of you were leading what some in the press had called “Earth’s mightiest heroes” was already pretty fucking complicated.
“I’m not finished, just let me….let me finish.” Steve fell silent, and Tony continued. “Listen, last night…I do…that, a lot. I mean, hook up with random people I barely know at parties. Which, I’m sure you no, it’s not exactly a secret. Anyways, what I’m trying to say is, I don’t do
2. He really, truly, hated fireworks.
Finally, Tony decides to go with his heart. Why the hell not – Steve had already broken it a thousand times over. He might as well put it out there. It wasn’t as if there was much left for Steve to break.
And now he was standing at a loud house party, totally alone, and Tony had been dared to kiss him. And he wasn’t one to turn down a dare.
Steve’s arm slid out of his own, but before Tony could complain, Steve’s hand was covering his own. When he looked up at him in confusion, Steve mouthed to him,
“Cops. They're on their way, and you
“Dare. Sweetheart, you should know I don’t do truths.”
“Yeah. Yeah, it is,” Steve said finally.
“I almost wish you were,” Steve said, though his arm relaxed.
was he going to make it through midnight on New Year’s Eve in New York City, with hundreds of fireworks going off at once? In front of hundreds of people, who were already crowding their way onto the balcony to see the show that was about to start?
And then, a few weeks later, he wakes up in the morning, Pepper tangled in the sheets beside him, to see the flip phone by his bedside, blinking. Tony’s heart leaps and catches somewhere in his throat.
Truth or dare. The kind of game played by elementary school girls at sleepovers. And yet, here he was, in a loose clump of people, in the corner of a house party in Boston, playing along. What the hell, right?
–“ He gestured to the two of them – “often. I guess what I’m trying to say is –“
and then sat back down, to a chorus of soft whispers, some of awe and some of spite.
He tells FRIDAY to plug in all the analysis from their fight in Siberia. He rubs his chest again. Steve won’t ever hurt him like that again – he won’t ever get close enough to Tony to try. He smiles, but it doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
, he got a little bit on edge, which, in his mind, was completely reasonable behavior.
“I…I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it either,” Steve said finally.
The familiar voice broke him out of his dreamlike state, and he pulled away reluctantly, his eyes still hooked on Steve’s bright blue ones. “Rhodey, can’t you see I’m busy –“
“Tony,” Steve said, forcing himself to stay calm. “What’s up?”
But the most pressing issue at the moment was how the
“Hey Rogers, um, Steve,” Tony said. He looked tired and….nervous? He couldn't quite tell. It made Steve feel nervous because, God, was this going to be even worse than he’d imagined? He steeled himself, forcing to push down the butterflies in his stomach that were only intensifying the longer he looked at Tony.
“It’s just me, Rogers. You don’t need to apologize, or anything. Just ...say what you want, alright? I don’t have the President on speed-dial.”
Around him, he could hear people begin to count down.
The way Tony saw it, he had two choices. He could either stay inside, and have to field a thousand awkward questions about why he’d missed the fireworks, or he could go outside and try to brave it, and hope and pray he didn’t have a total meltdown in front of all of his guests. Neither option seemed particularly appealing.
“Interesting theory,” Tony said. “We’ll have to test it.” They were so close now that he could practically feel Steve, that he would hardly have to reach out to touch him.
He flips the phone open.
“Now...we should probably kiss, I suppose,” Steve said, casual as can be, and Tony almost choked on air at hearing those words leave Steve Rogers’ mouth.
“...That the last thing Captain America might want to hear when he got back were more explosions,” Tony finished, and Steve nodded somewhat sheepishly.
“One!”
“- that I literally have not been able to stop thinking about kissing you since last night, and it’s really throwing me off, and I was wondering if you would like to do it again? And maybe get coffee? Or maybe a couple of very, very stiff drinks?”
“Not to say I wasn’t grateful,” Steve said quickly, which made Tony snort.
______________
It was somewhat embarrassing – he had to push himself up on the tips of his shoes to reach Steve’s mouth, but it was definitely worth it. Steve’s lips were soft, full, and warm, and he tasted like cheap beer and something else vaguely sweet that Tony couldn’t identify. And Steve Rogers was one hell of a kisser. He felt Steve’s free hand drop to his waist, and he broke away for breath, but only for a moment because Steve had come back for more, and they were kissing again, and Tony was pleasantly dizzy and –
“I can’t lose this Steve,” he said feeling the tears start, “I don’t know if I can live through all of that again, knowing what I have now.”
“All right Avengers,” Steve said standing in front of the display, “We have a plan. Six stones, three teams. One shot.”
“I still can’t believe you made me get up so early just to come back here,” Bucky said slumped over at one of the tables. “I could have slept in you know.”
“What are you talking about?” Scott said interrupting Tony’s thought process. “Where are we going?”
“What?” Steve said looking over at the man astonished that they hadn’t killed Scott in the process.
This is all on his mind as he walked next to Steve towards the Quantum Time machine, Tony looked at the team standing around him, Rhodey opting to have his suit look more like his War Machine Armor, Scott’s looks like the Ant-Man suit, the rest of them in a generic suit, which would change when they needed it to. He wanted them all protected, because in all of these timelines, Thanos still existed. He wanted his family to be safe no matter what, even if it meant creating suits for them that would protect them when they needed it most.
“STRIKE team’s coming to secure it,” other Tony said just as what they would later learn was HYDRA’s team, which included Rumlow and Stiwell, entered the room.
“Yeah, after mom yelled at the both of you to stop because you broke one of the vases in the hallway, the thing was worth a small fortune.”
“Not now Clint,” Steve said annoyed that that was the first thing that had come out of Clint’s mouth. “Can you just get Sam to give you the first aid kit that we keep in the café.”
“How would you know that?”
“Thanks Peggy, and sorry about missing our dance.”
“Do you have some weird eating disorder,” Bucky asked him after he had come back from showering his hair up in a bun while parts were damp from the shower. “All you ever eat is what’s in that fridge which I noticed is only packed in with smoothies and coffee, and those weird granola bars you hide under your bed.”
“What do you want Bucky,” Steve said from the floor, and Tony just wanted to throw a pillow and cry over losing the most perfect nap in the world.
“I said we’d lose, you told me that we’d do it together, and guess what we lost Steve,” he said his voice getting louder, and he knew that everyone behind him could hear him and he didn’t really care. “
“Wai-Wait a second,” Rhodey said interrupting them. “I have to ask you something.”
Later on, after they had blown up the TV and DUM-E had used the extinguisher on them, Tony knew that he was going to be in trouble with Steve. The TV blowing up was an accident, and there was a spare one in the family room anyway, but Steve had told him to never upgrade anything in the house without him knowing first. Especially after the microwave copped an attitude with him and made his lunch explode.
They studied together that night for a few hours, it was Thursday night and Bucky at the moment was out with Natasha, so they had the room to themselves. Tony was stretching on his bed while Steve sat at Tony’s desk and answered the questions on the practice test. The prize was Tony reading one of his stories to Steve, because while his own life was going to hell, it helped him write his fanfics more. Leaning over and grabbing one of the iced Frappuccino from the mini-fridge, Tony sat up to see a smiling Steve with his paper held out.
“Steve,” Natasha said from behind him, he hadn’t noticed that Scott and Hope had left, but there was a lot of things happening. “I need to go somewhere first,” she told him and he knew that where ever it was it had to do with Clint. Clint and the kids had been her family a lot longer than the Avengers had.
“Wait they’re here,” Kamala said sprinting out of the room, most likely in a rush to find her godparents.
Hope laughed from next to Scott before holding back the man so that he wouldn’t go after Rocket. Instead, Nebula cleared her throat and pushed them to the next stone, she clearly wasn’t in the mood for Rocket’s antics. She moved the soul stone forward, and Tony could see just a hint of sadness in her eyes.
“Sorry... what was that,” Tony said as he walked out the door. “I can’t hear you,” he really didn’t want Bruce guilt tripping him over this, it was stupid yes, and Tony did want an excuse to go to the store, but he was second guessing himself, so he was using Bruce as a lifeline so that he could go.
“Oh, well... um...”
“Maybe they’re on silent,” Steve said but he heard Peter talking in the background, which meant that at least Hank had gotten the call.
“We can’t,” Tony said his voice barely a whisper. “Vision hasn’t woken up, Shuri nearly broke the cradle because of it. Now this, I honestly don’t know what to do with myself.”
They didn’t waste any time after that, Steve could see the determination in Tony’s eyes, the need to fix something that was broken, it was something he loved about the man. They were in the lab as Tony and Rocket worked on the glove, they needed to make sure that this would work, because they couldn’t have one more failure on their hands. He knew that they wouldn’t be able to take another one especially after the last three big ones.
“I may have, they may have been there all along all it took was getting over what I had with you,” she was smiling at him, a little blush to match her red hair. He wasn’t sure who it could be, since his real friends are a group of superheroes, and her and Happy, a few others in between.
There was a moment between Steve falling off the bed, and him running off where Tony had to stop and think if everything that had happened had been real at all. Except his roommate was still standing there looking at him dumbstruck, so what else could have happened if not this. Tony didn’t want to say anything in that moment, he still wasn’t sure where Steve would have run off too so early in the morning, his guess was work, but it was still a little surreal for it to happen.
Natasha huffed at him before rolling her eyes, “Fine I’ll go get it, but head towards the bathroom on the far side of the ballroom, mom won’t go over there, the thing is closed, they had a problem with the pipes or something for it’s under construction.”
“Would you two quit it,” Rocket said to them reminding them that they had an audience. “We got work to do.”
“'Cause I got some important shit going on here. What do you think?” he said without thinking.... he was in so much trouble. “I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.”
Steve could hear Tony sigh as they went over the same three problems for the third time, it was Steve’s fault honestly, he was distracted by Tony. It was stupid, hell he thought about what Tony had told Bucky about his older brother, and the thought that if he tried anything and messed it up then the same brother would kill him as well. But the smell of Tony was distracting him in so many ways, he smelled oddly like coffee, coconut bodywash and metal if it were possible. He knew that Tony was constantly in the robotics lab working on something, hell he’s seen the little robot on Tony’s desk, he wondered if the thing knew when Steve was staring because he could swear that he sometimes saw the thing move, like it was assessing him.
Tony held himself back for a moment looking at Steve which made him feel self-conscience for a moment, before Tony said, “Thanks,” and walked into the room.
“Thanks,” he tells Steve with a huge smiled before taking a big gulp from the large coffee cup. Before either could say anything, else Bucky kicked the door open again before turning to look at the two of them before shrugging his shoulders and taking off his shirt, throwing it in the ever-growing pile in the corner.
“Why can’t we help?” Kamala was the first to speak after the three oldest kids talked in hushed voices. “We want to help.”
“I took off the ring, and since you’ve denied me my release, you’re going to have to live with it inside of you once we’re done, and after I have had my fill, of food anyway, I’m going back to your slopping wet hole and I’m going to fuck it open until you’re so open that when we wake up in the morning I can just slip inside and fuck you all over again.”
“Seriously,” Tony said looking at his roommate. “How blindsided have you been, the two of you have been going on dates for the last month, I know because you always come here with that doofy grin on your face.”
“If we can do this, you know go back in time, why don’t we just find baby Thanos, you know, and...” Rhodey made as if he were suggesting that they go back in time and strangle baby Thanos with a rope.
“You put me to shame, and I’m not saying that as a joke either, I feel like I have to run a few laps or something just to try and catch up to you.”
Tony heard the tell tale sounds of footsteps, he knew that their friends were there looking at what had happened but all he could do was look at the paragon of all that was good and holy in his life and want to punch him. It was always one step forward and three steps back with the two of them, and it felt like there was never going to be a common ground no matter how hard they tried.
“Well that’s the funny thing, she has a part in the company too, she’s a Stark after all, even through marriage, she runs the foundations and helps out legal, she has a law degree, but she likes doing charity work, so dad let her create the Maria Stark Foundation.”
“Steve, what if trying to fix everything brings more problems? What if trying to change what happened costs us what we love the most?” he didn’t say it, but he was afraid that even Steve would leave him, if they tried to change everything.
When he woke up three hours later, Steve was missing and Tony’s ass felt full, it took him a moment to realize that Steve had used one of the bigger plugs and not their standard ones. His hands were free, although his wrists were red from being tied to the bed, he wondered where Steve had run off too, he was due to take his medication soon, and he was still healing. Though the majority of the healing had finished, Tony felt guilty for doing what he had done.
With a nod the Hulk smashed a car, and jumped into the air to grab one of the Chitari flyers as they went by, taking him with it. “There he goes off on his own, it feels as if it were only yesterday when he was smashing the walls and bringing pain to his enemies,” Tony said as he watched him go.
“As much as I want to scream finally,” Natasha said making the two of them jump apart. “We have a mission to get to.”
The drive to Pepper’s was quiet for the first fifteen minutes, and then the kids woke up one by one, Tony knew that they had been listening, they’re nosy little bugs, but they were curious all the same. The only one that was still asleep was Morgan, she was slumped over in her car seat her mouth opened just a little bit as she softly breathed.
“Usually they let me write the answers and send it to them, but mostly it’s Thor or Loki doing the talking, I tend to start talking about tech or something and everyone just looks at me weird.”
“We’re not fine,” Steve said looking at not just Thor but at every one of them. “Thor we’ve all suffered a lot, you more than most, but we want to get there, we want to try and fix all of this, if it means going back in time and finding the stones we will,” he didn’t know if the words were worth it, but it was the only thing he had at the moment. “We will get you your families back, your people, our lives, no matter what, because they all deserve a chance, we all deserve a chance.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said to Bruce, knowing that he was intruding on their date. “It’s just that my boyfriend was supposed to come here today, and Natasha’s boyfriend as well, but they had to go to the hospital on a family emergency.”
“Thanks for the pep talk, pissant,” Tony rolled his eyes at Steve, which meant that he was annoyed by Scott’s questioning. “You trust me?”
“You don’t know what loss is,” Thor said, and Steve saw the moment where even Thor realized that he was wrong, the moment when Tony flinched, because he had lost more than most of them had.
“No not really, I have to get home and finish up with my paper, and I want to add things to this,” Ty said still looking at the papers he had printed out. “There’s a lot of work I still want to do on the story.”
“The plan,” Tony said while giving Steve an apologetic look, “Is to essentially give me a heart attack.”
“Yeah well,” he said with a smile. “There’s only so much you can do when you’re living in a life you hadn’t expected.”
“Yes, and he remembers everything, he’s been asking for you all, he’s been asking for Wanda too, but I haven’t told him anything,” she said looking at him with a worried look in his eyes. “I don’t know what to do.”
“It’s a family business,” Miles said with a shrug, Vision landing next to Miles, his powers fully operational, which meant that Shuri had been able to finish, with time to spare, this time around.
The first person that was hired was Bucky’s girlfriend, and their childhood friend Natasha, she promptly said that she would take care of the children’s section, which only made Steve wary of her command. The second person to come in was Thor, who had wanted a more relaxed job than the one he had as a bodyguard, so Steve made him the head of security, because he didn’t have the money to install more than three cameras and the store was now three times the size it had once been. The third was Phil Coulson, who his Nana loved, but had gone to work at some chain store because he had needed more money and didn’t want to take it from the sweet old woman. Steve had given him an Assistant Manager position, the man was good with organization and Steve needed someone like that because he wanted to actually be in the store and not stuck in the back. The last person had been their old army friend Sam, who had just gotten out of his service because of an accident involving his wingman, but Steve knew that Sam and Riley had had something going on, they had kept it quiet but losing him had broken something inside of Sam.
“You were kidding right?” Shuri asked next to him and Bruce shrugged.
“But,” Clint said, and it looked to Steve like the conversation with his daughter had helped him a little.
“It’s not that...” Tony said trying to find a way to convey this.
“I don’t know,” she started but Steve gave her a small smile.
Steve couldn’t help but smile, it was good to hear that even Pepper was thinking of the future, even when he was afraid of telling her that that future might not be real, they don’t know the outcome of the mission they were about to embark on, and he knew more than anything how worried Tony was about everything.
“I know that we’ve been through a lot over the years,” Steve said with a smile. “We almost never agree on a lot of things, but honestly its one of the greatest things about our relationship. You never looked at me as someone who needed to be pitied because of the situation I was in, you’ve always challenged me, you’ve helped me become a better person.”
Yes, Steve didn’t want the store to have any bad publicity, but she had assured him that they weren’t especially since everyone knew that it was one of Tony’s favorite places. For Steve though, it wasn’t so much as the press finding out, but the fact that Tony had gotten hurt, he was afraid that they would turn it around and blame it on Steve instead of the guy responsible, all the while Steve was worried about Tony being hurt.
“I don’t want you guys to hate Bucky, we were friends before we dated and we’re friends now, it’s not going to stop, we just weren’t right for each other.”
“In a way, there’s a lot more to it, but I won’t tell you about it until you’re ready to tell me about why you don’t like Cap,” he said countering Steve’s own reservations when it came to Captain America.
“Do you think that we could get a move on,” Scott said looking around at the destruction around them. “There’s a lot happening and I really don’t want one of those leviathan things falling on me.”
“But Steve is hurt,” he said wanted to whine like a child, but mostly because he had his own evil plans, mainly because he hated that Steve had taken that hit for him, but also because Steve was always in control and now he was just bedridden and Tony wanted to take advantage of it.
Slowly he brought his head down to meet Tony’s, feeling the warmth of Tony’s breath against his mouth, knowing just how close he was to the softness of his lips, he didn’t want to turn away from it. He closed his eyes and slowly kissed him, savoring the smoothness of his mouth as Steve swiped his tongue over those perfect pink lips. When Tony opened up for him everything in his world changed, and he knew that there was no going back from this. He was sad when Tony pulled away from him and looked up at him as if questioning whether or not this was really happening.
“That’s okay, trust me,” he leaned close to Sitwell and whispered the only words that he’s dreaded for his entire time as Captain America. “Hail Hydra.”
“That’s true, your father wouldn’t do anything to go against me, I would kill him if he did,” she said and though Tony knew it was a joke, they all knew to never cross his mother. “But when Thor and Loki came everything changed, hell Clint used to climb into the ceiling vents and drop down in your father’s workshop, scaring the shit out of him. But when Natasha came, and then you, well he softened.”
“You just did, while fucking yourself on my dick.”
The Annual Stark Christmas Gala was held not just for investors but also employees of Stark Industries, it was a huge party, and one that his mother spent months agonizing over. Tony loved watching the lights turn on this year, he had helped create a more energy efficient set of fairy lights, they twinkled all around them, it had been one of his end of the year projects, though not for school.
“Together,” Steve said with a smile, even after that argument five years before, even after everything that had happened, there was something about them being together, all of them working towards something better, that made it all the worth wild.
“I was good today,” he told Pepper as he got his stuff to leave, “Please don’t call me tomorrow, I haven’t really slept in the last few days and it would be nice to have a day off.”
“It’s good that he has a friend like you to help him then,” Steve said knowing that it was the truth, but he couldn’t help but feel that Rhodes was judging him. That this was a test of some kind, in the same way that his own family protected him after his break-up, or how Sam and Bucky had been there for him after he had been injured at the end of his last season playing ball. Rhodes was assessing his worthiness to be Tony’s friend, and Steve hoped that he passed that test, because he honestly wouldn’t know what to do if he failed.
An idea formed as Thor was thrown back, “Okay, Thor, I need you to hit me with everything you’ve got.”
“It’s not, it’s actually really romantic in a way... I don’t think anyone has ever really said something like that to me.”
“Yeah we did,” Tony said as he wrapped his arms around him. “We found out that there are three stones in New York during the invasion back in 2012.”
“You did, but then again you weren’t here and all we had were your notes.”
“We can snap our own fingers,” Natasha said, and Tony knew that it was he way of getting something she lost back, he wasn’t sure what, he never really asked what she had lost, or who it had been. “We can bring everyone back.”
“They’re SHIELD.... Well, actually the STRIKE team was Hydra, but at the time we didn’t know that yet,” Tony answered wondering in his head about all of the ways he could change the future for this group if he could only tell them that Hydra was in SHIELD.
“Good,” Steve told him before kissing him again and sitting back. Turning the car on and driving off. There weren’t a lot of cars out on the road, so getting back to the house was easy, but once there he could see the hesitation in Tony’s eyes. Steve knew it was because of what had happened the week before, one misunderstanding nearly ruined something that had just started.
Steve didn’t pressure him to go back to the Avengers facility, he didn’t pressure Tony to be Iron Man, all Steve did was work through his own pain and his own guilt, while also making sure that Tony was alright after a panic attack or on days where Tony was too far into his own head that he needed to get out. So, as the first year went on and they got closer, they had also found a way to work together on their little project, not that fixing a house was a little project, not with Tony involved. They did other things, Tony learned to cook while Steve learned to bake, everything was fifty/fifty, they talked and watched movies, but most of all they learned to move forward together.
Tony more than any of them, other than Rocket, knew the severity of Nebula’s loss, her sister was her only family outside of a murderous titan, losing her cost Nebula everything she cared for. The Avengers adopted her, but Tony made sure she didn’t have too many bad memories since, Valkyrie, Bruce and Thor helped whenever she visited New Asgard, but Tony was always the first one to greet her whenever she came back to earth. Even setting up one of those intergalactic video screens at home so she could call him whenever she wanted. They were a family now and he was going to protect her as much as he could.
“I know, and while I sometimes think about it, it’s up to them to tell us,” Steve said before settling into the chair next to him. “For now, I’m just worried about Thor, he’s been drinking beer almost nonstop since he got here.”
“Because I’m going to make you suffer right along with me,” Bucky stuck out his tongue and Steve wanted to cut it off just for annoying him.
“Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way,” Clint said to the STRIKE team, and boy did Tony wish he could use it on them right now so that they wouldn’t have the chance to take it from the Avengers and start experimenting with it.
“Clearly, your friend is fine,” she said, even though she knew, that he could see through her mask.
Before the two could bond even more a few of those attack dogs came at them, reminding them of the battle was still happening. Tony sees Clint before he hears him, the gauntlet in his hand as a few of the Chitari fighters were after him.
“I’m afraid of what would happen if someone took advantage of his generosity, it’s happened before and he retreated so far into himself afterwards, I honestly don’t want that happening again.”
“Yeah, I do it three nights a week,” Sam answered, and Steve realized that he hadn’t known that.
“So, how big is this army we’re feeding?”
“Well I’m glad that’s something that I could give you,” and it was something he was glad to have been there for.
“Night Pep,” he said fully knowing that it was mid-afternoon.
“Nope just burgers and fries, and the best milkshake in the world.”
“No, I wrote most of it, you just cleaned it up for me,” Ty was defending himself against all of the work that Tony had done on a story they had both worked on. “Tony, you’re a good writer and I’m glad you helped me, but this is my story.”
“Thor, sweetie, I know you are hear with your lovely boyfriend, but I need you to drive Tony and Natasha somewhere, if it’s alright with you,” her face was serious as she said it because Thor’s eyes turned serious the moment she was done.
“Yeah but you did the one thing that no one could, think about it Tony, Steve hated Captain America with a passion since he was a kid, and seeing the good ole Captain from your perspective has changed that, his mother said that the person who fell in love with Steve would be able to love both parts of him and as much as Steve hates to say it, Captain America is just like him in so many ways.”
“Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?” Steve said getting straight to work.
“Nope, I told you that you were going to suck me off,” he answered as he climbed his way up. “I only opened you up Steve, I’m still tight as ever.”
“On my way down to coordinate search and rescue,” other Steve said to the room, when all of a sudden Loki transformed into Steve, Tony realized at this point that Loki could be their one advantage in this whole thing, mainly because he can make himself look like anyone, which meant that they wouldn’t know that his Steve wasn’t their Steve, they could all think that it was just Loki playing tricks on them.
Miles stopped what he was doing his body stiffening in front of Steve, “Yeah... well... um.”
Sharon was a nice girl, Steve knew this, but for some reason he wasn’t attracted to her, it could also be because he’s seen the way that Sam looks at her and he didn’t want to be in the middle of Sam’s crush on her. Even when Sam had tried to get over it he was still pining for Sharon, and honestly it wasn’t there for him, that same feeling he was having over Tony. He thought about Sharon, and then about Tony, his mind automatically turning its attention to Tony who he wanted to get to know better. Hopefully they’ll find some middle ground at some point.
“Oh, stop being a baby Steve,” he said, the pills in his hand, but when Steve turned away Tony could only think of doing one thing, he put the pills in his mouth grabbed the water and moved close enough to grab Steve’s face and pinch his nose until he opened his mouth. Tony quickly forced the pills into Steve’s mouth along with water and put his hand on Steve’s face. “Swallow Steve or else you’re not getting any for me for a month.”
“What did that shelf ever do to you?” someone asked as Steve put the final nail into the shelf.
“I’m not sure, the stone on my head is not the Mind Stone, but it has similar properties to it, though I know the original stone no longer exists,” Vision said and Tony knew that there had been a real connection to the mind stone. “I know that a lot of things are amiss.”
“It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left...,” he heard Rhodes say and seeing how Natasha was reacting, Steve realized that he had missed a lot of things over the years. “I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.”
“Yeah everyone but Harley has a character, Harley actually told my dad that he didn’t want to be a part of it because he would rather be remembered for other things than to be the kid of the guy who created Captain America and Spider-man.”
The kid’s name, Miles Morales, and he hit it off with Steve, both of them from Brooklyn, both of them had a love for art, and honestly both of them were troublemakers, who had started a war against the girls, all the while Tony watched and made sure that they didn’t hurt themselves too badly. Miles, was like Peter in many ways, including the powers, which threw Tony for a loop, because how could there be two kids with the same powers in such a short amount of time, and how had these infected spiders gotten out. Tony just filed it away as another coincidence, and just watched the kids as they got along with one another.
“Sir,” Jarvis called out to him while he was in the hallway. “I believe that it is time for Captain Rogers to take his medication.”
“Did anything happen while you were all on that planet? Anything that would have alerted you to something coming after you all?”
“Gotcha,” he said smiling as he closed the briefcase. “Back in the game.” Steve would very happy to know that the plan was half way done, as he closed the panel that had held the stone.
They all got ready for the day, eating breakfast, talking like they weren’t about to do something incredibly stupid, before they ended up sitting in the conference room, Tony watched the holographic displays, the stones displayed along with their times and locations, each team under a stone. The biggest team going out there was Tony and Steve’s because they needed to get three of the stones, and one screw up would end this mission before it began. They couldn’t fault themselves if something went wrong, they had to get in and get out, and when the stones needed to get back to their time, that person was responsible for it landing in the right place at the right time.
“Don’t take the blame for something that wasn’t your fault,” Steve told him, and he knew him better than anyone. He hadn’t wanted to have anything to do with the time heist, he liked his life, but he also hated that Peter had died, he felt guilt for not stopping Thanos, and most of all he was afraid that everything that they were doing was going to blow up in their faces.
“Okay, but you’re going to have to scoot, I won’t fit if you’re hogging the whole bed, I’m not really a small guy if you remember.”
“How about for now, we just go back to sleep, because I’m not sure that this is really happening, and maybe we can talk more in the morning,” Tony said to him before snuggling right back into Steve’s chest. He wasn’t sure what had just happened but he knew that it was a start and what ever happened from that moment forward would change both of them.
“I’ll be the judge of that Rogers,” Tony said, taking out a red pen that he had gotten for the next time that Steve had asked him for help. It was a gel pen with gold glitter, and he had found it at one of the shops in the city, thinking about using it on his own story to fix the errors but then thought of Steve, especially after finding a blue one with red and white glitter. Of course, he brought both of them, along with those little gold star stickers he used to get in kindergarten, though he wasn’t sure why, all he knew was that it was silly, and it reminded him of Steve.
“Both of Captain Rogers legs seem to have fractures and will need to be bound before he attempts to walk, he also has a slight concussion, as well as five bruised ribs sir,” JARVIS answered him showing Tony the scans on the suit’s HUD.
“God Damn it Steve,” Bucky yelled causing both him and Sharon to jump as the door slammed against the wall, Tony’s sister Natasha not far behind his best friend.
“Yes, it was, but he took it in stride, and I’m sure on your next date it’ll all be alright.”
“Really smarter than Shuri?” he said joking but only because he knew that Steve was trying to cheer him up.
“But Dad the Ironheart armor is safe, and you’ve upgraded every single protocol for all of our suits,” Riri started, it felt almost as if they had planned on ambushing him with their intent on helping.
Steve stopped a few feet short of his car and turned his attention fully on Tony, “Am I going to have to go after him?”
“Okay, can you do that tonight if Bucky can’t get a hold of Phil?”
There was something in Tony’s eyes, a mixture of hurt and sadness, “I don’t know,” he said to Steve. “I really don’t know, I mean I sometime wish I had yelled at my dad, told him to pay more attention to me, Lila is stronger than I am in that respect, but I had still had my mom.”
“Trust me, I always thought I would have been a horrible father, until I became Iron Man, the thought that maybe one day I could have a kid was there, I had thought it would have been with Pepper, but this,” he said looking at Steve with all of his heart. “what we’re doing with them, how we are together, I couldn’t have asked for anything better.”
“Fine, but after I tell you this, you have to tell me your half of the story,” he said wondering if this would ruin what they had and not caring because he wanted to be honest with Tony. “My dad is Joseph Rogers, he had created Captain America for me, just like he had made Spider-man for my little brother, even creating characters for my other siblings, but for some reason Captain America had been his first real big break as an artist.”
They stood there for a while, before Tony pulled away, “I knew something was going to happen today, from the moment Shuri called I knew something was going to change.”
Mostly this is what happened to Steve and Tony during the five year gap, there's mentions of other characters, but it's mostly healing and fluff. I want my boys to be happy.
“It’s because I’m more myself here with you and Bucky and Natasha, then I am when I have to be in public, I had to create this persona for the public to see, one that wasn’t me, because I when you live under a microscope you want to keep the parts of yourself that you only share with those you’re closest to.”
“Can I read one of the stories one day?” he asked, amazed that he could want anything to do with something he had hated for so long.
He paced the room twice before noticing a picture of himself sitting on the desk, it was a picture that had been taken when he had been at Camp Leigh, and it was a strange sight to see. It was before the serum, before Captain America, before everything that had happened, but he realized in that moment just how much his life had changed. That Steve still existed, he drew with Miles, he danced with his daughters, and he smiled more whenever his husband was around. He wondered if everything had been different just how much this one photo would affect him. He couldn’t help but pick up the frame and look at his former self, someone who he hadn’t been in decades.
“You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich,” she says to him as a joke, before smiling.
“Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead?” Thor said his speech clear even after consuming as much alcohol as he had. “We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together.”
“Scott calm down,” Hope said next to him.
“Who would have thought you and Howard’s kid, the man would have a coronary if he knew, but I won’t tell him, I’ll just stay close to Tony, and when you find him in the future wherever you are, I’ll make sure you cherish him as much as you do now.”
“How much do you want me to spill everything inside of you,” Steve whispered in his ear, Tony hadn’t even realized that he had closed his eyes, he wasn’t even sure that he could talk. “Tell me Tony, how much do you want to come?”
Steve had spent the weekend reading everything that Tony had ever written or at least what he could find, he was certain that the one that Tony had read to him the night that they kiss hadn’t been published on any of the fanfiction websites. He knew Tony’s username, because no one but Tony had written about what Steve now dubbed as the Iron Avenger. What he had found in those stories were characters that he had never heard of, ones that he knew, and some that could be familiar if he had kept up with his father’s comics.
“Sorry, I guess I should have just read it myself,” Steve answered but Tony shook his head, because if he were honest with himself at this moment, he liked the fact that Steve was so close to him, and that he actually liked the story.
To his surprise, Steve was actually sitting near the library, a sad look on his face almost like someone had kicked a puppy in front of him. Tony wasn’t sure that he was ready for this conversation, he wasn’t ready for any of this. The whole weekend had been a disaster, and he was still nursing a hangover from his weekend inventing binge.
“FRIDAY, do me a favor and activate Protocol 8,” Tony said as he activated the shield for his suit, Clint standing next to him.
Instead of arguing with Steve about paying, he pulled out a twenty-dollar bill to put in the tip adding a little smiley face to the bill and a note to Steve in binary, because why the hell not, it wasn’t like he was going to see it anyway. Slowly writing each and every number so that he wouldn’t miss the right combination, he was nervous and it was really really stupid of him to write it but it didn’t matter.
“Have you and Happy ever thought about having your own?” he asked curious since they hadn’t had a kid, but dotted on Morgan like she were her own.
“See you two are alike in some ways, but also different in others because I’m pretty certain that you wouldn’t like to sit through an entire ballet.”
It took him two hours to finish, the chapter was around twenty thousand words, well he could have gotten carried away writing it, but hell he only had one shot at this story, and he wanted to pack in as much as possible. When he was finished, he grabbed another granola bar and shoved it in his bag with a cold brew Frappuccino before heading out to the robotics lab to work on his bot, all the while making sure that Natasha didn’t see him. Which was hard considering she knew him better then all of their siblings put together, there was also the fact that he wasn’t very good at being sneaky.
“What kind of present,” Tony asked knowing full well that it would be something dumb, but they’ve been best friends for years, and they usually got random things for one another, mostly from where ever they were in the world.
“Well I hated the one mom gave me, so I took it apart and only used what I needed to keep it on the plan, and then I made my own phone, but it’s not really that hard, I’ll explain it to you when I’m not freaking out about whether Steve’s been in an accident,” he said as he turned towards the wall, acting like he was looking at one of the decorations, all the while he pressed his thumb on the screen and watched as it lit up. “I know you want one.”
“Thanks,” Tony said grateful to hear it from someone who has had such a huge success with their writing, whether or not Tony was blushing at that moment... well he wasn’t going to discuss it.
“See you in a minute,” Natasha smiled at them just as they all shrank down into the Quantum Realm.
“A story,” he said before thinking about what to say. “Once upon a time, a girl went to bed. The end.”
“We won’t know the outcome of any of it though,” Bruce said to them. “We could all exist, we could have met at a different time in our lives, but it would still be us.”
“What like Iron Man should have been there the whole time or something?”
“Oh,” she said her face turning a little pink. “I didn’t know.”
It was cold and dark outside, usually this was where Steve would show up to walk him home, a big doofy grin on his face and a cup of his latest Starbucks creation just for Tony. Instead Tony started crying right outside the library, wanting for the whole world to swallow him whole just so that he could be alone. He wanted to scream out at the unfairness of it all, but instead he took a couple of hiccupped breaths before slowly walking towards his dorm. The whole semester had been a disaster, and if something else happened he wasn’t sure that he would survive it.
“Yeah, well I’ve been a little busy,” Tony was rubbing his head and now Steve worried that there was something there that he had missed, it felt like everything reversed itself all of a sudden. “How’s Aunt Peggy? I haven’t called her in a while.”
“Uh, kitchen, I think,” he said still in awe of their friends, Tony remembered that Lang hadn’t interacted with Nebula or Rocket before. “That’s awesome,” he said when Nebula was near him, her arm shining in the sun.
“I don’t understand half the things you say, I can remember all of it, but in the end,  I just like hearing you talk when you’re excited about something, but this, Tony this could fix everything, not just for us but for all the people that lost something that day.”
“Sharon goes to those parties,” Tony said reminding himself that someone he didn’t know who was also friends with Steve, was now dating his cousin.
His eyes were closed when he walked into Tony’s room, but he figured that he could just sit there with him for a little while. Steve had brought some cookies that he had made as well as some books that he had his grandmother recommend, though why Tony Stark would read romance novels was beyond him, but his grandmother had insisted that it’s what they normally read. He put the books on the bedside table along with the cookies, they were shortbread and a little more on the sweeter side because he usually drank it with his grandmother’s tea, and he thought that Tony would appreciate it.
“Did Natasha really hit you,” he said looking at nothing but Steve’s hand in his, he didn’t know what to believe, but he knew that Steve wouldn’t just sit out in the cold for who knows how long just to break things off with him. “I mean she could have stabbed you, she has knives.”
“They’re good, really good, and you said that Tony was the one who created these, as fanfiction, but they would make an amazing comic run as well,” his father said, there were notes on the papers, but from what Steve could see they weren’t bad, his father normally made notes to change something here or there. “I wonder if Iron Man could be a woman or a man, it’s a real mystery if you think about it that way, they could really be anyone.”
“Bombs away,” Scott said to him and while Tony knew the reactor inside and out, it’s probably different from Scott’s point of view. It made Tony wonder what it would be like to be able to shrink down and see his own tech from that size. “Is... is that Axe body spray?”
“Hey,” he couldn’t help but lean down and kiss his boyfriend, “You didn’t have to come you know.”
“Yeah, they just don’t like that you two dated,” Peter added, and Tony couldn’t help but laugh at how blunt the boys were.
“We were bored,” he said with a shrug. “It happens, but now... Steve now, it really doesn’t matter does it, because you want to do this whole time-heist thing.”
“It’s definitely broken, I can already tell, just stay still,” he said to Tony, and the only reason he knew it was broken was that Bucky had broken his nose testing out his arm when he had first gotten it. Tony’s nose was swelling the same way that Bucky’s had. “You shouldn’t have tried to intervene Tony.”
“I'm thankful. Because now, I know what I must do,” Thanos says as he stands up in front of them. “I will shred this universe down to its last atom,” he put on that god forsaken helmet and Tony just wanted to find a way to rip it off his head and shove it up the titan’s ass. “And then...With the stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given. A grateful universe.”
“Cool,” Bucky said taking the keys from Steve before heading out, leaving them alone, Tony in his head telling himself that they could never be more, that there was too much history between Steve and Bucky for Tony to be anything with Steve.
On Sunday he had driven home in a mad rush, to get his collection out of the basement, only to find that his father had been keeping them stored in a trunk, all hardcovers dating back to when Steve had just been a baby. He had stopped reading them a long time ago, but Tony’s version of the story had reignited something that he never thought would come.
“Well you said dress warm, what was I supposed to do, but I’m glad... I kind of like the little jealousy thing you had going,” he really was turn on by it, and he shouldn’t be, but it wasn’t like Steve was aggressive, it was more about having Tony in Steve’s clothes, which was cute and hot at the same time. “You’re adorable Steve Rogers,” Tony said just as Steve started the car, before Steve had the chance to shift into drive Tony pulled him into a kiss.
“Our future probably wouldn’t exist,” Bruce said to them all.
“Yeah that’s a lie, I saw like three of your tags all over campus, and it was my school’s campus,” Kamala said, and Miles just glared at her.
“What you didn’t think that I knew about the suit, your daughter is a blabbermouth,” she said to Steve and Tony.
“Do you know why?”
There had been a moment the other night where the Hulk had been walking around, but they had stayed away, mostly because the Hulk was talking with Thor while the other man cried. Tony had pulled him away not wanting to intrude, but something must have happened because Thor had been quiet the next day.
