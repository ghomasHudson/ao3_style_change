"Don't know. But we'll try to get Natasha back. And for now I'm out of all actions." She nods and left.
"There's three bases Captain, We should check them and then we're going to search the bases in russia." Natasha filled him in.
But just when Tony entered the room he looked at him and he was surprised when Tony pulled Thor’s collar to kiss him . He was shocked he couldn’t hear or see anything except Tony and Thor .
"You chocked me again and then you'll kill me right?" He opened his eyes to see the guilt in Thor's eyes.
He was hurting Tony alot . But he can’t help himself. When everytime he saw someone is touching Tony he’ll get mad . But if Tony’s happiness is being with Thor he will leave Tony ? No he can’t he loves Tony so much .
They all know how Tony is the weakest one in the team and yet all the team was against him. Why nobody wants to be there with him?
After that Natasha asked promotion to enter the lab and when she entered she pushed him against the wall and kissed him.
When the hours passed by it’s seemed that Sharon doesn’t want to leave she kept making out with him in the garden . But suddenly he felt that Tony is not ok . There’s something wrong! He pushed her and told her he had to do something. He run to Tony’s lab .
How was he supposed to tell them about what happened? It’s looks like they can’t remember anything and that’s they were being controlled by! He was pulled from his thoughts when Thor called him again.
“I miss you “ She whispered and Steve was shocked that she kissed him infront of Natasha , Clint , Sam and Wanda .
“Hey Peter it’s ok breath.. Just breath, no, no! Peter calm down sweetheart,” Bruce voice make it worde some how.
"Rest." That's all He got for their talk. Yeah The winter soldier is not active for small chitchats.
Tony can feel the tears running down his cheeks. Why he’s saying this to him ? No one knows about what his father done to him except Steve and now he was making fun of him . He was making him feel worthless . but he’s not a whore or a trash . He had a heart just like everyone. But why this is so hard for them to understand that !
“Steve?” His voice was hoarse and Steve looked at him then he ignored Tony and continue walking. Tony sighed and stood.
Steve, Thor and Natasha were so mad at him, but Natasha didn't say anything and so is Thor. Steve was scolding him and Tony can't accept The great captain America talking to him like that in front of a lot cameras.
“No, I’m bigger than this. And you’re bigger than this. Why he’s so skinny like that? When was the last time you guys gave him some food?” Tony walked to Ross and started untying him.
“Take off your t-shirt please?” Loki asked and Tony took tome before nodding and he started taking it off.
After that they kept talking and most of the times Steve will roll his eyea and he was thankful that this was a call and not face to face .
"Peter I want you home by7! understood!?" Peter couldn't believe him so he stormed out of the house.
"Leave? You know you never paid for me? I spend alot of money on you and you know that." Tony said and every word was like a knife to Peter.
"Save him Steve, please?" Steve just closed his eyes to prevent himself from breaking down and crying like a kid. He gasped when he felt another one hugging them, he looked to see Peter hugging them and they both hugged him back.
They all were talking and Tony was looking at them . How could they do this to him after all he did to them ?
Thor wiped the blood from his lips and said “Let’s have this fight then “ And yeah they did !They only stopped when they heard a sound of bullet .
“But you’re not dumb like me to waste a life full of love with the purest man ever ! but we shouldn’t lose the faith Peter ! He’ll back to us “ and That’s Steve
How many times did Steve put Tony in pain? It's countless times, and now he'll di- no he won't. Steve won't let him.
“Tony, why did you do that?” He looked at Natasha, then she passed out. ‘I’ve to.’ Was all he can think about.
But he remember what happened in Siberia and lowered his head to the ground and then looked again to find Natasha and Thor and ... Raccoon?!
“What was that? You know maybe I’m the one who’ll use the safeword.” He asked her and smirked, but when she looked at him in the eyes, he froze. She was crying, but why? He cupped her face “Tasha what happened? Who’s the reason of this!?” He asked her and he couldn’t hide how furious he was.
he cupped Steve’s face and kissed him and this time Steve closed his eyes and returned the kiss for the first time
And now they were whipping him cause he tried to run and suddenly he felt something is coming out of his back.
He wakes up screaming, He still can feel their hands on him. His body was on fire thanks to Thor for whipping him.
He felt dizziness creeping down his body and he reached for the nearest thing and it was a tree. He sighed and reached the wound. He looked at his hand it was red from the blood, he cursed under his breath and Clint turned to him.
He didn’t hear or see anything. When he regained consciousness, Bucky and Loki were holding Thor . They were Stopping him from killing Steve, but Thor was very angry.
He woke up when cold water was on his face he jolted away and looked at Bucky who was holding glass of (was) water and now it’s empty.
“Let’s go Tony. Can you walk?” Steve asked him and Tony nodded, But he felt his legs being so weak and he stopped walking.
“Tony? Don’t worry he’ll be fine. And we’re going to make sure they’ll pay for it.” Natasha said to him trying to make him feel better and he just nodded.
If he told him that he want to face him Steve would feel hurt cause again he doesn’t deserve Tony but he’ll face him . He’ll do anything Tony wants from him .
She was right. But yet calling him a whore it’s reminding him of what happened back there. It’s reminds him of their filthy hands on him. It’s reminds him of their whispers.
Tony smiled to the memory and he realized that he’s missing his babe his love his boyfriend. He sighed happily and decided to go to see him and he was actually surprised that the other avengers are out . He go to their room and he heard a moan he blinked and again he heard it but this time louder . he sallows and opened the door a little slowly and he was prying that Steve is not cheating on him. His eyes went wide open once he saw Sharon is riding Steve she was on him and Steve pulled her into a kiss . Tony never saw this love in his boyfriend’s eyes when they’re making love .
Once he opened the door he was shocked to see Thor was kissing Bruce. They broke apart and looked at him just shocked like him .
She stood infront of Frost and put her hand on his cheek, "You're mine. Forever." It felt like she's promising him.
Thor pulled Tony’s wrist and They fall to the ground and Thor was on him but they continued laughing .
“Oh Shit ! I’m so close Tony !” Steve said as to tell Tony to come now and Tony did after seconds Steve followed him .
"I'm..." He stopped to collect his breath, "I'm not fine Peter, after what I've done to you and what you went through because of me. I would never be good." Tony looked at his lap while his hand never stopped brushing Peter's hair.
“Come on Tones . You have to wake up now and be strong “ The voice said again and Tony felt some one behind him .
“Ned gave us your message the first thing I did was going to Pepper and Rhodey thanks to god they were in the same place. so we go directly for Tony and we saw Sharon with him giving him magic and drugs by needle so we stopped her and we get the answers we wanted.” Stephan brushed Peter’s hair away and saw how Peter’s body froze but he knows why so he sighed and continued “Then I came up to you and broke the spell from them. But they can’t remember anything from the past month when they’re a wake.” Peter nodded and looked at them.
He just have to see Steve and if he was outside or in his bedroom? He stood and excused himself from Bruce and left .
“Stop ! Thor ! Steve! Are you a clowns !!” Tony wanted to stop the fight he was between them when they are both punching eachother .
“We’re glad to see you Peter.” The two AI replies in the same time and damn if they were human he’s sure they’re having tears in their eyes now.
Thanks for the Ideas guys ! It’s really helpful! Hope ypu enjoyed! Please leave kudos and Comments :3 . Love you all :D
"If something happened to anyone of them then that's on you! I'll let you regret what you did! We told you to go back and take Bruce with you so why you're still here?!" Tony's eyes were wide and he thanked his god that they cannot see him because right now all he needs was his armor.
“I saw him Tony... the one who was abusing me when I was only 7, he still got the power over me. I... I couldn’t do anything I just stood in front of him and the fear climbed me. I felt so weak.... Fury told me that when I’m strong again he’ll let me go to missions.. He doesn’t know that this man has power over me, Tony I’m scared that he’ll be free again and try to kill me.”
"Alright, if he doesn't want to tell me about it then I'll see what happened." He said and Tony nodded to him.
He couldn’t hear what Tony was saying or what Thor was saying cause the next thing he know Tony asked Thor to fuck him
Tony took off his t-shirt and Bucky touched the wounds . and Tony bited his lower lip because of the pain.
"Eww did you just seriously were having sex and come and touch me and dares to touch my son?!" Tony asked and faking being offended.
As you can see... I tried to make it the last chapter but I couldn’t.. I wrote this chapter two times and I’m ok with this one. Thanks for your kudos and comments ♥️💋 love ya all
“I’m fine darling “ Bucky replied then Steve and Sharon entered the room and Steve’s eyes locked with Tony’s for a second then Tony looked away.
"I swear to Thor that I'll kill who ever stood in my way to bring my kid back! It's been a week Bruce! A fucking week!" Tony snapped at him and get in the suit.
“What you think you’re doing?! I’m really pissed off with you! You’re nothing! You’re worthless! Without Howard’s money you’ll be dead by now! But you’re so lucky that the people around you dies and you’re still here ready to kill another good people.” He heard them before talking to him like that so he just rolled his eyes and waited for Clint to finish his talk so he can go and drink beer.
“Tony that’s enough.“ It’s hurts Hearing Steve’s voice defending them and He can’t shout or shut Steve up. He can’t hurt the man he always loved no matter what .
When Bucky entered on them Tony doesn’t want anyone to see them fighting or to see Steve wants to rape him .
He hides behind the wall and then he looked to see Sharon giving them potions like drugs. She was sticking the needle into Tony’s neck.
“Nah Nat the food is good but I don’t feel like I’m hungry “ He answered her smiling and she smiled to him but yet he can see the worry in her eyes .
"Tony, breathe, you're safe here, no one can touch you." Nebula was trying to calm him down, He smiled to her .
He’s not going to let her or let them control him again. He was about to lose Peter. If someone tried to stood in his face he’ll kill him even if it was Steve.
“Oh my god ! How I’m going to hide these shit !” Tony was angry when he saw the heickies but then he laughed at Thor .
“What!? No! Why would I do that to my boy!?” that’s Steve voice and- oh he’s sitting in Steve’s lap and not on the floor, while his back pressed to Steve’s solid Chest!
“I can’t believe you did that Tony.” Oh, no, it was the disappointment voice. The captain is disappointed. “And I thought that you were pure. But I was wrong, you’re so filthy and I can’t trust you being here to be with the team. And I thought what was happening between us was a thing, but I was wrong; you only loved it when someone use you.” He felt like the shield was breaking his arc reactor again, He wanted to scream and tell them that they are wrong, but if they know they’ll hate him more.
“Jesus! Man what the hell ! knock first !” Tony rolled his eyes but once he saw Loki is looking at his body Tony turned red and Loki smirked.
“You? You of all people telling me this?! When was the last time you had taken a nap?” Bruce asked while he was pointing at him with his index finger and there’s something in Tony’s eyes, it’s different. He never saw it before and when Tony realized Bruce is searching for something he looked at the floor again, technically avoiding looking at Bruce.
on top of Tony, he blushed and wanted to sit but Tony pulled him to his chest and Bruce froze. Was Tony being soft with him?
“You’re the death of me boys.” Loki hummed in agreement and Thor snorts loud which caused them to laugh.
He did the one thing Rhodey told him to stop doing it. He cuts his wrist and hissed in pain. He was looking at the blood and he felt so dirty. This is the second on of his teammates putting their hands on him. “Damn Howard stop fucking laughing! I hate you, even when you’re not here you’re hurting me!” He can hear Howard’s laughs, he covered his ears then he fall to ground, his back resting on the wall, while his head is resting on his knees and he just closed his eyes and slept.
“Peter? Tell me what happened with you, Steve said you were in pain but he couldn’t know what happened to you.” Tony said and started brushing Peter’s hair.
He’s safe with Tony’s hands wrapped around him protectively. Tony had a soft spot for them and they should never broke him cause then no one can pick him up again.
“Rhodey it’s hard, I don’t think I can make it.” Rhodey shushed him and wipes the tears away from Tony’s face.
“Sometimes I’m curious to know why you’re not broken? I just hope someone will brake you!” Natasha said and he wanted to tell her that he was already broken and so many people had broke him but he just smirked and fired back.
Steve doesn't know what to do, he pulled at his hair. He shouldn't lose control, but he is right now. His kid is being kidnapped while they were hurting him. His husband on the edge of dying. And now he's here all alone.
“Hey Iron head ! How are you ? you look like shit !” Loki said grinning and Tony rolled his eyes but still smiling .
“You know that he’s not going to let you touch him again right?” Finally she looked at him and he smirked.
"Eww how could they force someone like you to someone like her!" Peter starts giggling wich causes the soldier to smile.
As you can see.. They started to remember what happened :) ... I hope you liked this chapter.. thanks for your kudos and comments❤️ Love ya
"I'm sorry uncle, I'll tell them I promise." Stephan kissed Peter's forhead again and Peter missed being contacted like that. He missed being warm, he missed to sleep between Tony's arms.
There was a hand on his shoulder he looked to see Bruce looking at him with the rest of the avengers even Steve was standing beside him
"What's the plan?" He asked because he didn’t want to go deeper with Steve and did not want to be hurt again.
Bruce wasn’t in the mood for the playboy even though he’s his best friend, Tony could be pain in the ass sometimes and Bruce will hulk out if Tony teases him about something stupid.
“N-No! I don’t want him! Don’t call him, I don’t fucking need him!” Tony start rubbing his arc reactor just to get rid of the pain he’s feeling.
After that he kept their place secret, cause he knew they’re in Wakanda. Anyway Ross kidnapped Tony, they broke him there, but yet he didn’t tell them anything. Then there’s a (rape) and he didn’t like saying that he was so weak and he couldn’t fight them back, So he said that he enjoyed it.
He opened his eyes slowly only to close it again, the lights did nothing but hurts him more. Where the fuck he's?
He closed his eyes and remembered when Tony spit in his face and told him he’s cursed with killing everyone.
“What do you want? You took him from me. What else DO YOU WANT!” He can’t control himself anymore he was scared and he was alone.
“Tony you’re so weak. Don’t show that to them . Go and take your chance with the god. Go my little demon “ The voice said again and Tony wiped the tears he waited for the voice but it was silent.
He opened his eyes and Tony was still looking at him, not smirking or judging or anything else he was just looking at him with... worried eyes?
“I-..I need to breath, please?” Peter says or better say whisper but Steve heard him and let go of him slowly.
“But it’s wasn’t my fault?” He wiped the tears away and tried to calm down. But in the end he couldn’t and he kept his room locked even when Thor was threatening him that he’ll break the door.
He left Peter looking at his hands on his thighs, he preferred Tony beating him better than ignoring him.
"You're going to see yourself. Soldiers!!" She called three soldiers wearing a symbol of Hydra. She jerked her head towards him and then he was being lifted off the chair by his hair and getting kicked in his rips.
“No ! I don’t need to be loved ! What the hell is wrong with you guys ?!” Tony said rolling his eyes.
"Steve, What about the stones?" Carol asked him and he shrugged off, the stones are the reason why Tony os in the bed, and Natasha being dead.
He nodded without looking back. “Sure, cap.” He was surprised that his voice was steady. He left to his lab.
“What ?! Where’s Peter ?! Is he okay ?!”  he pushed Steve away and go out . He couldn’t wait to hear the answer.
Tony sits up and Steve sighed, he should search his son, but he can't leave Tony alone while he's like that. "Babe, I promise I'll bring him back to you and let hi rest between your hands" Tony just shakes his head and tries to stood but he fell to the ground.
“I love you ... I always kissed you just because I love you all of them except the first one “ Tony laughed and Stopped laughing because he was pained and Started coughing again
“Babe ? Are you ok ?” Steve asked cause Tony was closing his eyes and hugging him he never acted like that only when he had a nightmare.
He stood and go out he was only in the towel. He found Loki  sitting on the bed Tony jolted and put his hand on his heart .
He dropped his spoon on the floor and no one noticed him and when he gets down to get it he saw Steve holding Sharon’s hand under the table he paled and picked his spoon and suddenly he felt that he’s sick .
“With who you were talking?” Thor asked and Tony laughed and he knows that he sounds like a crazy one but he doesn’t care .
How could they do that to Tony ? He was like their brother and more ! They’re really animals just like him ! Tony deserves the best he doesn’t deserve to be treated like that !
“Hey Wanda. What’s with your nose? Don’t stick it with something you don’t know about.” Natasha retorted and with the glares that she was giving to Wanda.
Seeing Tony sitting in Thor’s lap and hiding his face in Thor’s neck cause he’s tired from some boring meetings.Just the way they always do after every meeting or interview.
"He takes the shot instead of me." Everyone looks at her and she continues, "He made himself a human shield, the idiot. I can take this bullet why he thought that I was going to die?"
He saw Tony sleeping he can see nothing but an angel. He doesn’t deserve Tony . He kissed him then he decided to wake him up .
He puts his clothes and books in their place. And he was surprised to see Loki is already reading a book.
“I found the love of my life finally ! And I want to spend the rest of my life with her ! “ He looks at Natasha who was smiling to him . And he smiled back.
As you can see I added the tag that you wanted it and Guys anything makes you uncomfortable just say it.
He looked up at Rhodey who was holding Tony’s hand between his hands. He was so shattered, Colonel Rhodey was never like that.
That’s true his mother was like his Howard, but he loves her and he can’t stand anyone talks that bad about her. Even when she hits him in the past it wasn’t her fault, it was the drugs and alcohol’s fault.
“You know? I’ll take your wings and I’ll give you to your enemies. Yes Tony I’ll give you to the angels We have a deal together. They’ll kill you and no one will miss you even Steve and you know why? Cause he’s going to be with me.” She stood behind him and she started to touch the wounds.
When Tony was at his room, he got two calls. One from Ross telling him to apologize to the avengers. The other one was from Nick Fury telling him the same thing.
He crashed into someone. he looked to see the angel looking at him and he knows that he was so screwed.
“What about you slapping me twice?” Tony asked looking at the ground grinning as if it was a joke but inside no he mean it .
“You’re just a bitch like her and you know that .” There were gasps and dropped jaws about what Tony called Nat .
“Good morning.” He mumbled to them and he gets a waves and a (Hi,Hey) with a (goodmornings), but the only one who doesn’t care about his Presence was Tony, he just kept sipping his coffee and totally ignoring Peter.
Tony runs to him and hugged him . Bucky wrapped his arms around Tony before looking darkly at Thor and Steve.
"Stark? I'm happy to see you again .. Tell me .. How do you feel after losing this annoying child?" When Thanos mentioned Peter, Tony felt the blood boil inside him. He could not stop himself from attacking Thanos. He can hear Steve tell him to back down.
Suddenly Tony remembered that no one ever kissed him like that. It's just felt so warm and he remembered that he should know this feeling very well, but he can't cause his parents were too busy abusing him.
“No you’re not ! You’re tired Tony ! I can’t resk it “ Steve said and Tony look at his body he was full of bandages
“Bruce you piece of shit !” Tony was calling Bruce and when he saw him . Bruce was arguing with Thor and Loki
“FRIDAY lock the door.” as if someone will enter on him again. He kicked them out of his tower no way they’ll back to him. He must apologize to them and he knows that.
“CAN you explain WHY you haven’t been in your SCHOOL FOR MONTH!” Tony was in a second in front of him.
“It’s ok Bruce they’re scared about Steve nothing is wrong.” Tony replied to him and Bruce nodded after staying silent for minutes.
Tony put his head on Thor's shoulder and closed his eyes and this time he didn’t prevent himself from falling sleep.
"I'm his wife! You can't just come and take him from me! He wants to rest! He's going to suffer more because of you!" Pepper started screaming and pushing at his chest and crying, he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her to the hug they both need it.
“S-Steve  ... ah !” Steve was surprised what’s wrong?! he thought Tony was having a nightmare about Titan and not about him .
“Tony? Look..” Clint sighed and put Natasha on the cold ground, Tony was about to yell at him and let Clint take Natasha from the cold ground.
“It’s only two years I can do it.” He was convincing himself that everything is going to be ok but he knows that the hell is waiting for him there.
But he didn’t say anything he jsut kept looking at them but not looking into their eyes- hell he’ll never do that again.
From no where he was having a flashback when they tortured him on the table. it’s like the air can’t get inside his lungs.
Thor was a good friend to him and he was ready to collapse in front of him because he did not judge anyone and this is what distinguishes him from everyone.
He has saved his life but in return now he is on the bed. He's supposed to be on the bed and not Steve. Why does this always happen with him? Why didn’t Steve leave him to die ?
“I..? I don’t get it? Why you’re welcoming me? I. I thought that you would kick me out of the compound?”
Who’s coming? And who dares to do this to Stephan? But who ever they are he should admit that they’re really strong to do this. He got a really bad feeling about this.
Hands were everywhere.Too much skin. Tony gasped when Bruce bit him hard that he drowned blood from him, he pulled Bruce closer to him and he wanted them to go to bedroom better than this couch.
Bruce closed his eyes and tried to control his breath, why Tony was under him? And why they’re still sitting here?
"Stop! Do not try to touch me again!" Tony felt dizzy again but this time Thor reached him before he could fall andTony was very grateful.
"Avengers, Let's go. All out now." He walked and saw Loki stabbing someone in his neck. Thanks god Loki was on their side.
"Aunt Natasha, please? If you're going to talk about it then leave me alone!" Natasha shook her head and again he disappointed them. When he saw how she flinched when he raised his voice he regret it.
"Brother I told you to do the spell on my beloved Bruce so I can have a baby from him." Thor says and Bruce huffs out.
“Bucky the safety of people is more important than him “ Clint said and Bucky give up and sit down again.
“What happened? Steve I swear to god if I know you were behind this then you’re going to regret it!” Like always only Tony’s voice could make everything better. He start recognizing things now.
“No Thor, put that food away. He’s grounded.” Tony said without looking up from his tablet. Everyone was about to tell him that he cannot prevents his son from eating something, but Peter smiled and nodded to his father.
And now he was being beat again. But he can’t just die! They should be here saving him and he should be with Steve now. Why all the bad things just kept coming to him?
He was moving his hands, so when did they untie him? He looked around him. No one was here just him and Frost, while he was sleeping on the floor with gis head resting on Frost's thigh.
Today is the day. He’s standing in front of them all. Rhodey by his side. He received glares from everyone, but he ignored it.
Anyone who says Captain America is a merciful guy, then, they're so wrong. Here he was ripping them apart. Blood is everywhere and yet there's no information about Peter and Bucky.
I’m sooo sorry guys ! I’m having alot of troubles and I’m sorry for being late . I know this chapter is not good and I’m sorry again:(
“Yeah Of course you have to proof that they are wrong “ Steve said and yet didn’t look into Tony’s face or eyes
He saw Natasha she was sitting on the bed waiting for him. They smiled to eachother and ahe patted the place next to her so he can sit next to her.
“No you’re not I know what you’re suffering just when I touched you “ Loki smirked when Tony’s eyes widened
“You know that you were my favorite hero? And you know that you’ll always be my favorite hero?” Tony said and Steve was surprised but he smiled to Tony and Tony was grinning to him.
"Jesus Christ Tony! Are you trying to give me a heart attack!" Tony couldn't help the giggles that escaped his lips and Clint is smiling too.
"Peter, come on hold her and give her a name." Loki holds her out to him, he holds her and she looked at him whith her beautiful gray eyes and yawned.
He sitted down between Thor and Steve like always, Bucky gave him orange juice while Thor was about to put food for him when Tony stopped him.
Bruce sighed and hugged Tony suddenly. Tony froze in his place. He doesn’t know what to do? Cry? Push Bruce away from him? only hug Bruce in return?
“Good for you Sharon ! You taked the person that I always loved ! But I’m not going to let you take my son away from me !” They all were surprised from Tony .
After Clint was talking on the phone with his wife Tony took the chance and leave to see Steve and he was searching for him but his heart stopped beating when he saw Steve is marking Sharon’s neck .
"Bucky said he saw it too." Tony stood and start pacing around. It's true, there's noway they're just imagining things. They're all monsters, what happened? Why they were treating Peter like that? And how could no one of them remember what happened in the past month?
“Tsk! Now you wants to buy us with your money and act like the angel that we were seeing you! But the truth is you’re the devil honey.” Clint retorted and Tony was hurt by that.
He is not going to ask why this is happening to him cause he knows that it’s like there’s a curse on him. He’ll be sad to the rest of his life.
Steve pulled his hand free and all though Tony wasn’t holding tightly. He looked into Tony’s eyes and says “You’re the wrong Tony.” Even when the lights are off he saw something in Tony’s eyes for a moment, but then Tony looked away and sighed.
‘Everything is going to be better now. No one have to put up with me now. I don’t have to be broken now’  That was the last thing passed his mind before he let the dark claim him.
“I mean I put the blame all on you while I’m the one who was a bad leader. It wasn’t your fault or Natasha’s, it was mine. I’m sorry Tony of course you won’t forgive me so I’ll just go and lea–”
Steve sighed and returned to eat but every five seconds he will look at Tony . And when he saw Tony is looking down at his plate and he was about to pass out in any moment. Steve was thankful everyone noticed him . He doesn’t care about her he dropped her hand and go to Tony he stood beside him .
He was in love with Tony and He can’t stop Tony from getting in relationship with Thor cause he’s the one who started this fire and he deserves what’s happening to him .
She sit beside him in Tony’s chair. What are you doing? Who are you to sit in my boyfriend’s place?! .
His body was hurting him he’s not strong enough and it’s seems it’ll take maybe 2 months and he’ll be ok again oh that’s if nobody beats him again.
"Tony! It's been only hours since you've out of the surgery! You can't leave!" Bruce was pacing around and trying to stop Tony from leaving.
“You’re grounded! There’s no patrol! There’s no suits! There’s no food for today!” And like that Tony closed the door loudly and Steve sighed and shook his head.
When Tony wanted to make their relationship official for all Steve was so scared at first but then he agreed with Tony .
There were only inches between them and the last time that’s happened he remembered it was painful, Steve using his shield against his son was a bad memory for Peter.
“Po-pops? Please, Let me go? please!? I-I’m scared pops! Please I-I’m sorry for whatever I’ve done. Just please save me I can’t do this anymore, I’m hurting pops, I’m in pain- m-my head hurts so bad I-” Peter doesn’t know when he start crying but his breath was stolen away when Steve pulled him to his chest and Peter broke apart and started sobbing between Steve’s arms.
He felt someone wrapping his arms around him. His eyes shoot open to see Thor picking him up and Loki was standing on the other side of the room.
They finished and both of them were shaking. Bruce looked at the man under him he was passed out, He kissed Tony’s forhead and he lets his hand resting on Tony’s cheek. Tony opened his eyes and kissed Bruce’s palm, Bruce smiled to him and Tony smiled back,
"Brother, please let's go back? Our father is waiting for us! Please, Loki?" Thor looks at Tony for help and Tony swallowed. Huh? He wants him to convince Loki? Loki who chocked him and throw him out of the window?? Loki who tried to kill him?
Tony can feel his heart is aching but he was smiling and laughing with his friend Clint . And now he was sure that Steve was with Sharon out side making out .
He couldn’t let her getting shot again, she would die. No matter what she’s a girl after all. And Natasha is soft she won’t make it.
“Baby, What’s wrong? Tell me, are you alright?” Steve asked him and his voice full of worries and soft in the same time.
Bruce came and give him a syringe to let him sleep. And when Tony was on the bed again and looking at Steve like he betrayed him, Natasha and Thor enterd the room and call Steve.
But maybe he got feelings towards Steve even after what happened? It’ll be a torture to see him with Bucky. He understood that Bucky is also victim right here, but he can’t help it; he felt angry that he’ll lose Steve for Bucky and in the end he did.
How pathetic he was. His father had broke him too many times. His mother as well, the students in the school he was in,Obieda. Steve just like his father he hurts him so much. And now Natasha and Clint.
“Hey .. It’s ok . You hadn’t cheated on me ok ? I know that Thor was in love with you . And I just was about to end the things between me and Thor “ Bruce hugged Tony tight and Tony patted his back .
“Babe I’m really sorry ... even when I’m saying that I’m sorry you have all the rights to not forgive me “ Steve kissed Tony’s lips slowly and sighed.
"Make me." She challenges him and he looked away. He is not even ok. He doesn't know why he's still in pain while he should be completely healed.
For pops and dad? Shit who am I to call them like this again? They’re different people. I really don’t know them.
He made everything worse and worse. He was such a disappointment. They run and run, fire behind them, an explosions happen behind them, but all they care about was getting to safety.
“Shut up! Shut the hell up!” He walked to the elevator. ”Friday. Please lead them to the lobby. All of them” everyone was shocked but they did what he said he stopped bucky.
“You know that he loves you “ Thor was sure with what he was saying and that’s what made Tony snorted .
"Wh-Why?... I don't want them to remember uncle stephan. Please help me I.. I don't know what to do please uncle!" The last thing Peter wanted was them remembering everything happened.
She lost a lot of blood ‘course she’ll pass out like that. The pain is killing him and he can’t do anything about it.
“No ! I can’t live with that kid in the same house! He’s a nightmare! Of course you’re suffering cause he won’t let you sleep because of his cartoons “ Tony giggled again and Bucky rolled his eyes.
If it was all just the affection of the spell then he mustn’t tell them about what happened, no matter what.
Tony was sitting on the couch now and Peter sitting beside him holding Tony’s hands between his hands .
He started to faint in his lab more than usual. Friday will never open the door if he told her to, while Jarvis will open it if he saw Tony's in a bad situation.
“Yes , your mother’s sister . She told the wizard everything and he told Thor everything and Thor told me everything and I’m here to tell you everything “ Loki said wiggling his eyebrows.
"I'm not a good brother Tony. He... he was begging me to stop hurting him and I was just listening to them not doing anything else just kept hurting him more and more." Tony doesn't know what he should say to that. So he kept brushing Thor's hair.
There’s an houre before Steve will wake up, so first off all he had to do was making pancakes for him.
“No he’s not coming “ Thor said making Steve wants to laugh and he was shocked to see Tony is not coming to him and staying by Thor’s side .
He stood in front of the mirror... Yeah he was looking fresh and new, now he was ready to face them. Yes he's ready.
"She's not. Back when they bring her. She was just a child maybe 6 or 7 years old and they told us that we're going to marry once she's old enough."
Steve closed his eyes remembering all the bad times between them and how many times Steve wanted to slam Tony to the wall and kiss him hard. And god, he wishes they could go back in time so he can kiss Tony and tell him how much he loves him, but the Time is not on their side, why wasn't him who should die? Why it's Tony? Tony have a family and a beautiful daughter, but Steve...Steve was a man out of time.
“L-love yo-u Rh-odes.” Event thought that he’s still can’t talk like before, but it’s warming Rhodey’s heart and Pepper who was standing at the door crying.
Tony is pissed off from Steve, of course he thought that Steve was scolding him for patrolling out late and he was having a panic attack because of Steve. Yeah that happened before and Tony thought it’s happened again.
“Please be mine . Don’t lose the faith in me babe “ Steve pressed thier forhead together and closed his eyes .
When he woke up from a nightmare, his body was full of bandages. Tony came out and thought everyone was asleep but he was surprised to find them all sitting .
Days passed by and everyday there’s a new video for Tony being fucked from different people. Steve felts sad he really does, but Tony shouldn’t do something like that and he shouldn’t run away from this problem by killing him self. Yet he was surprised that Tony tried to kill him self more than once, Hell what was he thinking about?
"He did nothing! He never hurted anyone on purpose and even if he did then it's meant you're the bad guys." He smirked when she frowned.
He saw Tony laughing on Loki and Clint and hearing his laugh warmed Steve’s heart . But the way Tony and Thor smiled to eachother makes him wants to throw up .
"Move." She orders Frost, who refused to move. She was mad in a second and she controled her power and throw him to the wall. He groaned in pain and Peter's eyes filled with panic. She chocked him with her power and Peter stood and run to her so he can stop her but she moved her hand to him and he was hitted by her power and fall to the ground.
“Why didn’t you tell me about this?!” Tony looked at Steve who was very angry at Thor and Natasha, But why?
“He’s right, you can’t give me food while I’m grounded.” He said smiling to Thor and Thor looked at Tony like he was about to smack his head but he sighed instead then he ruffled Peter’s hair.
Soon Tony opened his eyes wide and kept looking at them then he whispered “T-tha-anks.” Even though it was hard to hear it, but they were so happy to hear him.
“Tony! You can’t do that!” suddenly Steve snapped causing everyone to jolts. Peter looked at Steve to find him red and that’s mean he’s angry and he would kill anyone right now if he wants to, but Tony slammed his hands on the table and Peter’s eyes filled with fear.
“Damn I’m getting emotional!” Rhodey chocked out but hearing Tony laugh again was enough to bliss his day.
He wakes up because of a nightmare again while his neck is hurting him, he groaned and stood, he took warm shower and then dressed himself.
“Tony? apologies for this now.”His father bossed him like always but Tony stood and take the bags from his father’s hands and walked to the door.
He closed his eyes remembering the day Tony came back from the space, he was so thin and he run to him, already feeling that he let him down. But what can he say now?
The avengers ignoring him or mocking him or saying mean words to him or humiliate him. And he was friendly with them even when they’re treating him like he’s the dirt in their shoes.
“Tony ? Babe ? Are you ok ?” Steve ignored Thor cause Tony was out of the zone and he was looking at the ground .
But Tony was surprised when he saw that Natasha was avoiding him very much . she doesn’t know what happened in Siberia?
“No . I mean yeah there’s but in our sections only the two of you.” Clint answered him and Tony nodded smiling to him.
This time when the door was opened, Frost couldn't move away from him, so she saw them. Her eyes hardened at them once she saw them.
When he saw Ross in a room, he stayed calm cause he knew his friends got his back. He knows that Steve will kill Ross if he tries to put a finger on him.
“You’re not alive! That’s can’t be true! Please, get him away from me!” Tony looks at Ross who was standing behind Tony now. Who’s this guy? What does he want?
He looked to see Sharon sitting in his place where he was sitting and resting his head on Steve’s chest .
“Please Tony, please... Can you just stay here and I’ll try to deal with Natasha’s wound and I’ll try to call Cap. Please take the gun and if anyone gets near you kill him ok?” He hands him the gun and Tony kept nodding, he can do that for them. Natasha would be dead if they couldn’t do anything about it cause she loses a lot of blood.
Steve was surprised to see Tony strong again . He was shaking and so scared but once he heard Peter is in danger he was like a rock .
After what Steve had done he’s sure that Steve loves him and he was just wasting his time with her . He was looking down at his plate and he was smiling with closed lips .
He closed his eyes and remembered how cruel he had been with Tony. He was just trying to save the situation, it wasn’t his fault and yet he said mean words to him.
Now they can’t talk to eachother again. They can’t laugh with eachother. He can’t do anything to make Tony happy .
"Babe, take it easy. Doctors are saying you have a failure with your arc reactor and with your heart. You should rest babe. You can't even walk." Tony groaned at the news which made his husband smile at him.
“Nothing babe it’s not important let’s go back to sleep please?” Tony said smiling to Steve who sighed and hugged Tony .
"In his room, Bucky stayed with him. Natasha and Clint in Shield, while Loki and Thor are back in asgard."
He ignored their stares and he had to pass between them and when he did Natasha pulled his wrist and he lift his eyebrow and he was about to tell her to fuck off but she spoke before him.
for Bruce, Nat and Clint he’s sure they will be like a body without a soul, they’ll try to keep the avengers team and will be there if something bad happened.
“Then let’s go take a shower and eat something then maybe we can talk?” Tony suggested and look up at Bruce with eyes full of hope. Bruce chuckled and Tony grinned genuinely.
What Steve did was totally wrong cause Tony was crying and screaming and he was trying to get himself free .
"Frost, where's my dad?" He asked even though he's leaning into the touch cause that's the only comfort he'll be getting and that's what his guts telling him.
Steve sighed and said “I can’t Natasha! I really want her and I can’t keep lying at him cause I can’t hurt him anymore!”
"What about him Tony? He finished his exams and now he's in his room grounded because he was sassy with you in front of us all." Steve replied and Loki couldn't control himself when he rolled his eyes and Tony did the same.
He closed his eyes but he wasn't listening to them clearly, but he knows if he falls they'll be here to catch him.
Just for the same reason everyone is breaking up with him. Just the same reason why he and Steve are like this.
“We’ll get them back together alright Tony ?” Steve said and put his hand on Tony’s cheek He noticed how Tony leaned into the touch
“And for how long you’re not letting him eat?” Loki asked crossing his arms to his chest. Tony sighed and sitted in his spot again.
“F-Fuck off ! W-why you’re here !” Tony shouted on him he was breathless like there’s no air in his lungs
“ They don’t love you Tony ... They will kill you so soon “ The voice said and Tony couldn’t understand what’s going on .
“No,No! I’m not done with you yet Stark” Tony smiled to him and wiped the blood from his lip and Punched Clint back but it’s easy for Clint to dodge him.
“Peter! PETER!?” He looked up at Thor who was kneeling beside him, Thir wanted to pick him up like always, but that’s lead Peter to have panic attack.
“ I’m the god of thunder. I’m the king of Asgard. I’m the strongest avenger . Do you know me now ?” Thor asked Steve and he pulled Tony behind him . That’s surprised Steve more and more he felt his heart was about to stop .
In the next morning he woke up because of a hand touching his face . He opened his eyes slowly to see Steve smiling to him Tony smiled back and he pulled Steve to kiss him and Steve kissed him back .
“Tony, I- I know that I don’t deserve you and I know that you deserve someone better, but I know we can make a beautiful couple if we tried. Of course we’ll argue and fight over the stupid things and I know that we’ll have each other’s backs. Will you stay your whole life with me and bliss me with every morning when I see you sleep between my arms? Will you love me even though I’m being jerk? Tony will you marry me?” Tony was crying and he jumped on Steve who fall and hugged Tony.
once Steve saw Tony is looking at him he moved away from Sharon and looked at Tony he nudged Natasha and she understood him .
“So lovers boys ? I’ll come back later alright?” Tony moved back and his smile never lefts his face.
“Hello! My name is Clint! You’re new right?” The man was so loud and Tony knew he could get in with him easily.
He inhaled Steve’s scent and kissed Steve’s shoulder before he closed his eyes and started chasing the sleep.
Then they were sitting and watching Brooklyn nine-nine. It’s only about hald an hour and Bruce was sleeping with his head resting on Tony’s chest.
“I broke up with Tony “ He answered her and she was surprised but he can see the hint of the smile on her lips .
“Sharon ? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me? Will you marry me ? “ he was holding her hands and she cried and hugged him .
“You’re not a monster Bruce. She doesn’t deserve you or deserve Hulk. You two are better than being with someone fake like her.” Bruce wanted to interrupt him but Tony put his index finger on Bruce’s lips to shush him. “Come on Bruce? Seriously? When was the last time you had sex?” He asked but still he wasn’t mocking him or anything.
“This is the first time you’re dreaming that I’m leaving you .” Steve said and Tony took a shaken breath and smiled to Steve
Thanks for reading guys ! in the next chapter we’ll back to Tony and we’ll involve Loki in the next chapter! Please support me with your comment and kudos! Love you all hope you enjoyed! muah .*Be ready for a new supernatural in the next chapter xD*
and there’s a section we don’t get close to.” They shared a look and nooded to him so he can continue.
the man was having  a dark hair man he seemed a trouble to Tony. Why he’s going to be with this one?
Tony cared about Bruce, he’s his favorite person and Jarvis informs him that Bruce was about to Hulk so many times, so Tony decided to let him rest for a while.
Then when Steve was about to finger Tony he turned Tony so now Tony was facing the pillow like always .
Suddenly everything came back to his mind. The punches, the metal arm pulling his arc reactor and the shield in his chest. The hands that touching his body and rap- He pushed Bruce away and hide himself with his arms. They’ll hurt him of course, Steve sent them to do this or Ross told them to rape him so he could get information from him. He felt a strong hand on his shoulder and he jolted away.
“No, Barnes. Anyway I made a new arm for you. I have contact with Shuri and we did it at the end. Now when ever you want to try it just tell me.”
He looked up to see Natasha reloading her gun and someone was about to shot her, he couldn’t let that happen no matter what. So he did the one thing in his mind, sacrificing himself.
"A new home finally!" Peter shouts opening his arms wide then he starts running around the house like the child he's everyone knows.
Tony stood and Peter starts walking, Tony wasn't sure if he should touch him or Peter will refuse to touch Tony. But Peter made the decision by running to his father's arms.
Steve came and wrapped his arms protectively around Tony and he was apologizing to Tony who just kept crying on Steve's chest. This family was broken more than anyone expected.
but Steve held his head so he won’t hurt from the floor he puts him slowly to the ground and wiped the tears that falls from his eyes and left Tony on the floor
He felt shivers run down his body when thunderstorms hit the place. He would think it’s Thor, but now he’ll say it’s just a thunder.
"Could you just accept the fact that I'm not your fucking Soldier!" Here he was having shouting match again with Steve and the whole team.
“Babe go back to your bed you’re still tired you scared me “ Steve said kissing Tony’s hand and Tony was about to roll his eyes and tell him to shut up but he just smiled to him .
Steve never marked him only just when Tony is the one asking him to mark him . And here he was marking that bitch . He go to his lab but his heart was hurting him so much he put his hand on his heart and tried to focus but soon he was dazed and he fall to the ground and everything was black !
He sighed and started working on Clint’s arrows to waste his time cause he doesn’t want to face Bruce, Thor and Loki after his panic attack so he kept working until he can face them again.
He felt so warm when Tony was talking. Tony was being soft with him and that’s weird, but he was so grateful for him. He was saying bad things about him while Tony was saying only nice things about him. Steve felt in shame but right now he was so busy fucking Tony and losing his virginity with Iron man.
“Tony babe ? you sure you’re ok ?” Steve asked him he really was worried about him but Tony gave him that look again. But again he smiled that faked smile and it’s started to pissed Steve.
He realized that Thir was talking to him but he pushed Thor and choose to fall to the ground better than being in Thor’s hands again.
“Steve you’re the only one who could do this mission “ Nick said and Steve nodded but he doesn’t know what mission he meant .
He could never hurt his son no matter what, but yet Peter will flinches when everytime someone tried to touch him. Sometimes he could feel that's it's real so he decided one thing to do.
He looked up at his teammates The guilt in Natasha’s eyes was worth to wait. The last time she looked at him like that when she knows what happened in Seberia.
Tony felt like he’s talking with a kid and not a growing man. Clint was scared and Nick Fury was a bitch! And the one who was abusing Clint is in the jail!
“Can I ask you a favor for one last time?” He asked avoiding to make eye contact with anyone of them and they nodded to him.
“ I’m not responsible about what happened I swear. Please believe me. Steve?” She asked Steve’s help. He’ll stand for her of course and Tomy knew it. They’re so fake. He can’t do this anymore.
And he should move on just like Steve is moving on ?! But why he can’t hate him ? Why when everytime he saw Steve he forgot all things that happened to him ? Why when Steve is smiling to him He just loved him more and more ? This is not fair.
“Tony I’m sorry I’m really sorry . I’m not going to make that mistake again I promise you I won’t leave you again Tony “
“Nothing Tasha. I just got lost.” He lied and Natasha rises her eyebrow and she seems like she wants to smack his head for finding this horrible lie.
once they finish they go to sit with the others and he saw Tony there eyes met but Tony looked away of course he’ll. It’s like he’s still in love with you dummy?! He sitted down and kept looking at Tony . Tony was in another world and he know that Tony was thinking too deep.
“You should have see how he believed in me! Oh my god! He is such a fool!” Steve was laughing hard and Peter was watching them with horror in his eyes.
"He told you to stay in the back line because there is a plan ! Why you are always trying to be a hero, you are not a hero! You could never be a hero . You’re a criminal Tony ..” Natasha left him looking at the ground.
Now they care about him? He wanted to scream, wanted to shout and to yell at them but all it came from him was just a sigh.
Once Tony saw Steve looking at them he stopped laughing. And damn he had been afraid of Steve’s look .
“Seriously Bruce I can complete them alone you don’t have to worry your self “ Tony said once they entered the lab
It's been a week since he was taking by Hydra. Frost couldn't keep his mouth shut and couldn't keep his distance, just when Wanda was about to stab Peter, Frost take the knife from her and stabbed her.
He was looking at himself and he was beating his own son! Peter was pleading him to stop, but he was too busy hurting his son. He can’t see himself slapping or punching or even kicking Peter. And the worst part Peter wasn’t stopping him, he was bleeding and when he see himself stopped he sighed in relief, but of course Tony was shocked to see himself pulling Peter from his hair and dragging him god knows where!
"He told you to let him go!" Loki pushed Thor away and pulled Tony to his chest. Tony yelps in surprise but Loki transfer and so is Tony.
"He took everything from me, my parents, my brother! My life!" She was getting angerier with every moment passed and Peter was getting scared especially her red glow is spearding through the room and when she took steps toward him, he shoots her with his webs but it's like she expects him to do it; she holds him with her power and lifted him frim the floor and he was feeling something inside him is tearing apart.
"What are you thinking about Pete? Didn you fall in love without telling us?" Tony asked him and starts playing with Peter's hair.
“J! Help me, I don’t know what to do!” He makes it worse when he rises his voice and he cursed when Bruce shoved him and opened his eyes.
‘Put your mask on Stark.’ That’s all he thought before he smiled to them. “Welcome back! Your rooms are still the same and there’s a room for you too Bucky it’s in the same floor with Steve I didn’t want to get you apart dude, but if you wanted a floor alone then there’s one already completed for you.” Tony wishes that Bucky will say that he wants a floor alone, cause he hates seeing him close to Steve.
Clint crouched in front of Tony and he cupped Tony’s face and Tony closed his eyes at the warm touch.
“Involved? huh! my ass. She’s the head of the snake the bitch! She tried to get her revenge from Steve by turning everyone against you and especially Tony. And when Steve start to cheat on Tony with her, of course Tony will figure out and he’ll punish you for something you haven’t done, cause as she said you’re their slave, accidentally he’ll kill you but the truth she’s the one who will kill you.” After saying that much Rhodey took a deep breath and nodded to pepper so she could continue and she nodded once and continued.
“You know what it feels to lost your best friend in the middle of the war? You know what it feels to see your friend’s face and calling your name to save him, but you fail? You know when you promise the love of your life a dance but you sleep for 70 years? No you don’t know because you don’t have friends and you never know how to love someone.” Tony was about to beg him to stop, he didn’t need someone to remind him of that, but only if they knew that his childhood was a torture for him. He moans when Steve bites his shoulder and makes it bleed. Steve left Tony’s wrists and they were bruised from Steve’s hand. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck for support.
Seeing Tony smiling to him and brushing Thor’s hair just after the sex , The way Tony smiled to him .
"Hospital." What?! What happened with Tony? Is he alright? Or.. or what if something bad happened to him? What if he died and Peter couldn't apologize to him? He didn't even tell him that he loves him!
"I won't go back... He's not my brother!" Tony could hear the fear in Loki's voice and he won't blame him.
“ I’m not doing this because you take Steve from me.. No, I’m doing this cause you go to the best part in mylife... Peter. Yeah you bitch you’re just a trash I don’t care about you... Seriously find something better instead of destroying happy lifes. huh what a whor-“  He was cutted by Steve slapping him for the second time. And that’s smirk again on Sharon’s face.
“Sharon? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me ? Will you marry me ?” Steve asked her holding her hands and she hugged him and cried from the happiness.
"For god's sake Tony.. Can you please just do what Cap is telling you to do?" Natasha asked him and she was crouching beside Clint.
Tony lifted his head and he made eye contact with Peter. They just kept looking at each other, no one of them realizing or caring about the tears that are falling from their eyes.
Steve stood and walked to the room and saw Tony looking like a ghost, he couldn't believe that he's still a live. He pulled a chair and stayed by Tony's side. People were talking beside him, but he couldn't see or hear anything but Tony. He touched Tony's hand and then he hold it softly. Rubbing Tony's knuckles with his thumb, while Tony's face was so peaceful. Why they're saying he's selfish now? He just wants Tony with him, is that wrong? And no, he won't stay with him after Tony wakes up. He'll leave him with Pepper cause she deserves him and he deserves her. She's strong, beautiful and the perfect example for wife. And Steve? Steve is broken and he's nothing like Pepper.
They’re all mad at him. Bruce and Clint in bad situation because of him, if something happened to them he won’t forgive himself.
Seeing Tony comforting Thor after defeating the enemies and how Thor is resting his head on Tony’s chest and Tony brushing Thor’s hair and kissing his head .
He was calmer than before, he retired from being Ironman and he adopts Peter because he can’t live without his happiness.
"Don't leave me alone Steve. Please, no again." Loki was shocked to see Tony broken like that, not lol at anything tears run down his cheeks and his voice was a whisper and the worst he was asking Steve to not leave him.
He starts to panic who the hell is she? And where's everyone? The girl didn't look so dangerous but she looks scary enough and Peter was smart so he decided to have a talk with her before attacking her.
They were so quick and following Clint’s leads and then they were about one corner out of this hell.
“Tony ? Go to your room and wait for me ok ?” Bucky said and Tony nodded. Bucky kissed Tony’s forhead again and Tony left .
“You noticed how he was crying and asking you to stop fighting you fuckers ?” He asked again  . There was no answer again .
“Well you’re kissing him alot and you didn’t give me a kiss ! I need only a one kiss “ Steve said looking upset
He wish that he could back in time and tell them that it’s ok we can start a new part of our life, but he was so selfish.
“Is it so cold for you mr Stark? Do you want my coat? Do you want hers? Just fucking answer me you son of a b–!....” he cut himself when he saw Tony’s eyes widened in shock. “I’m sorry Tony, I didn’t mean to snap at you. It wasn’t your fault.” Clint sighed and then sighed again. Tony looked at the ground and then nodded to Clint. “Let’s keep walking, I hope we can see a safe place so we can contact with the others. Is that ok with you?” Clint asked him and Tony nodded again, Clint smiled and Tony smiled back to him.
Tony rolled his eyes and go to prepare a coffee for him and he felt a hands wrapping around his waist. Tony froze he knows that big arms . It was Thor’s!
“What are you doing here alone? Where’s everybody else?” Bruce asked again, but he was taking steps towards Tony. Until he pulled Tony into a warm hug.
I know this is a fake smile Tony stop smiling please and cry between my arms I’ll keep you safe no matter what .
"No one is a whore just you." Peter said and she kicked him hard in the ribs. Frost closed his eyes he's not strong to see anymore.
“Come on babe we have to eat our perfect breakfast “ Steve wiggled his eyebrows and Tony was totally in love with Steve. every second pass he’ll love him more and more.
Tony will accept it when they talk about him or about Howard, but not his mother. And what hurts Tony the most is Loki getting in his head. How could he? Tony stood and ignored it when his bare foots stepped on the broken glass and plates and god knows what else was on the table. He was standing a few inches away from Loki now and then he slapped Loki.
Thir felt sorry to see this family suffering. He just hopped this family will find the happiness again.
“I need you Steve. I love you” He Kissed Steve’s lips and when he stood to leave he saw Natasha with clint standing at the door looking at him.
He could feel his heart aching he wiped his tears that started falling but no , he can’t lose Steve! He won’t fight him about what happened.
He go out and froze when he saw Steve’s back. He was fighting with the others avengers. There’s someone Tony couldn’t recognize him.
He just imagined Tony’s reaction, What will happen to him? What if he locked himself in his lab till he dies!?
He knew that he was blushing and he knew that Thor know why he's blushing. Thor starts getting closer and Tony can feel Thor's breaths, he closed his eyes and parted his lips a little. Instead of feeling Thor's lips on his mouth, he felt it on his forhead and that's sent warm feelings inside his heart.
And when Tony kissed him for the first time it’s like his dream had came true and the more important thing that he told him he loves him . And when they had sex for the first time Steve saw Tony’s scar on his chest and he was shocked .who could hurt a beautiful one like Tony ? Who would want to break this beautiful heart? . After the first time Tony never took off his shirt again. Steve will see his chest only when Tony is taking a shower he will come and have sex with him and see his beautiful chest and heart.
“Tony ? You have to stay with us seriously we can’t resk you” Thor said and the whole time he was standing by the door leaning on the door.
Now he is working on his return and to see what he caused from his loss. What happened because of him in the first place.
“Yeah I wanna take him . That’s the truth! I wanna keep him between my arms in the night! I wanna kiss him and take the pain away from him ! I wanna make love to him and make him forget everything he kno-“ Thor was cutted because Steve punched him in the face .
“You’re putting my boyfriend behind you ! Away from me ?” Steve asked taking step forward but Thor also took step forward they were inches away from eachother.
He was being selfish and he knew it, He should do that for his uncle and for his family. Even though it's hard on him but he should do it.
He can’t see Steve only in nights cause no one is there beside him so he’ll just sit beside him and run his fingers in Steve’s hair or hold Steve’s hand between his hands or kissing Steve’s cheek.
And What about him being not a human ? But he’s acting like one of them . It was a real problem to him .
"Me and Romanov in the right wing. Clint and Thor in the left. Loki you're going to try and reach Peter and Bucky. And Avengers... kill'em all." Just once they were in positions, the Ironman suit with a tired Bruce showed up.
“Shut up!” Tony was smiling now. “Just shut up you dummy! It wasn’t your fault too. You’re not the one who shots Natasha, you’re not the one who told me to jump and take the shot instead of her and it wasn’t your fault that we’ve been caught. Clint you’re a good leader, I’m alive and Natasha is also alive. That’s mean you’re the beast leader and who told you that you’re not a good leader?”
“I gotcha!” Thor said and he was smiling to Peter and Peter was only looking at him with wide shocked eyes.
“Yeah I wanna take him . That’s the truth! I wanna keep him between my arms in the night ! I wanna kiss him and take the pain away from him ! I wanna make love to him and make him forget everything he kno-“ Steve couldn’t hear it anymore. These things no body should do it to Tony only him !He punched Steve and cuts him .
Sorry for being late but the school had started and at least I have 3 exams in the day . Hope you liked this chapter. And guys who wants to be my beta reader? Thanks for reading. Support me with your comments and kudos. Love you all .
“What do you meant missing?” Natasha asked. She was calm and not saying anything and yet she talked. So Steve didn’t tell them about what happened? Ok?
“Ok ?! I feel we’re sitting between demons ! Jesus ! Let’s go Tony “ Bruce said giggling and Tony joined him .
Why you kept talking like you care about me ? It’s ok just say that you don’t love me and you love her !.
“I can! I must do that so he can learn and never hide things from us!” Tony shoots back. Tony looked at Peter and Peter looked away, and Tony continued “He can’t even look into our eyes! He didn’t even apologized to me!”  Peter closed his eyes, he can’t see his dad and pops yelling at eachother because of him.
