"Danny?" the scrub nurse addresses the supervising one, "could you go to the surgical supply room and get me the number two elective aneurysm basket, the wide-jaw micro Kerrison and the Pennybacker periosteal elevator?"
Sherlock doesn't bother with the food. He's too restless, too running on fumes and adrenaline for his digestive impulses to kick in. His appetite is fickle at the best of times, and under duress it's logical for such baser, unimportant impulses to give way to more important tasks. He feels frozen to the bone, and the unheated house shields him from the wind, but not the cold. He searches the house just as the sun drags itself below the horizon, but he's unsure as to what it is that he hopes to find. The limited survey he does with the help of his torch tells him the house is a mess.
John is biting his lip, looking out towards the sea. He seems uneasy, restless. "I better go. Want a ride back?"
"You must have talked to her about lots of stuff you don't know how to discuss with me." John takes his usual seat opposite Sherlock.
, I mean. They think we should attempt all manner of ridiculous and expensive and agony-extending tricks even when we know they won't be useful to the patient. In the States, a doctor cannot apparently take someone off a vent unless the family consents, nor can you deny anyone access to intensive care."
"It could be both, this time," you admit. Sherlock has complained about concentration problems, about his head feeling foggy — which is probably because he's so sleep-deprived. But he wouldn't pick cannabis as an
"You've allowed yourself to hope that you might cope better than you expect with interpersonal relationships. The unavoidable, occasional retreats to old, less effective coping mechanisms and the small falls we all take with other people need not discourage you from believing that you have improved a lot. I know setbacks are discouraging, but dwelling on them is not going to help, nor should you use them as an excuse to fall back on
He needs to continue. "I met my partner John Watson at a time when I was struggling professionally. Partly this was because I had grown tired of fighting myself and everyone else's expectations, of trying to fit in. I was so tired of what I saw as a story of failure to conform and a failure to adapt to the demands of my chosen profession. So, I began to write myself a different one, applying the lessons of Harrow: I held on to the belief that it was better to be feared than it was to be pitied. I created a new personality through which I could shrug off the reactions of other as something I had chosen to elicit instead of something that happened because I couldn't,
. Let them pursue their interests without constantly being reminded of their shortcomings. Help them get the support they need but offer it in a manner that does not marginalise, belittle, or deprive them of autonomy."
In the end, the assessors seem to have agreed with Sherlock's opinion since the missed parts have been labelled: 'No judgement was made'.
tell him this, and you can't read on his features whether it helps, but in your own ears it hadn't sounded dismissive or pretentiously optimistic. "I know you're shite at patience," you add, "but it's early days yet. I promise to tell you if you seem to have gone daft, eh?"
touching the meth and cocaine mixture. He has no experience of the effects of such a cocktail and, having picked such a pointless, inelegant street drug as crystal methamphetamine, is something of a deterrent. He feels a pride swell in his self-control as minutes pass. John should be proud of him, but John doesn’t really understand these things at all. He doesn’t understand that managing an addiction is not a business of actions but a business of electing
"He could never disappoint me in the same way I disappoint him. He works hard to compensate for my faults."
John shakes the hand, slightly disturbed by how this man is taking over all the attention by just, well, existing calmly. After releasing Mycroft Holmes' thankfully dry hand, John leans slightly to the left to focus on his patient. In contrast, Holmes the younger seems to want to exist anywhere else but in this hallway. "What should I call
It doesn't feel odd at all, not after everything that's happened in the past two weeks, to be resting quietly and so close like this.
The sound he’s still hearing must be coming from outside. He stands up, gets as close as he dares to the window smudged with the human fat from countless fingerprints, and looks down. It's Edward the Abdicator, tugging at tall grasses growing on the side of the house and munching them as thoughtfully as a sheep with likely not the highest IQ of its species can manage. Sherlock knocks on the window and the ram looks up, its jaws ceasing to grind the plants into a pulp. Perhaps it's due to the near-rectangular pupils, but the look in its eyes is sardonic.
John greets him with a bone-crushing hug, even offers the chair to him. Sherlock protests that he's not quite wrecked enough to need such service, but John silences his protest with a determined shake of his head and a peck on the cheek. They discuss their respective work weeks over the meal, and even Sherlock can tell John is making an effort to focus on him. It means he shouldn't bring his tablet or his phone to the dinner table; if he does that when John wants his attention, John will get annoyed. It's just one of the rules Sherlock has deduced and memorised through the years.
Sherlock had spent the morning exploring the ruins of Noltland Castle east of John’s house. Dating to the late 16th century, the fortress’ main parts are well-preserved, but most of the adjacent buildings and structures are nothing but a crumbling ruin. The multitude of gun loops and the thick walls bear testimony to what a formidable stronghold it had once been. New wooden staircases have been added for visitors that lead from the massive kitchens to the upper floors. A plaque had explained that the castle was meant to have three functioning floors, but only the second floor had been finished and used. Bloody skirmishes had been fought to gain control of it, draining the resources needed for construction. Standing in the courtyard, Sherlock had imagined the shouts of soldiers, their swords clashing as they struggled to control this rare shelter standing alone in the grasslands. Entering the great hall, he’d discovered all the roofs missing. One couldn’t see that from outside, where the castle looked much more intact than it really was. He’d found a scratched inscription barely legible on the right-hand side of the arched entrance. It read:
He's been neglecting his violin for years. He's been too busy, and the week he'd been forced to stay home had not repaired the damage of such a long period of lacklustre practice. There's not just the shakiness, but a lack of…
Sherlock looks satisfied, but can you be sure that a test devised by his brother whose profession it was based on will convince him?
The next morning, they part ways at the staff entrance. John heads downstairs to the lockers to change into scrubs while Sherlock, wearing a dark blue suit and a white shirt today, is bound for to the neurosurgical ward's morning round. The preparations for his first operation will take long enough that he can attend the round, grab a coffee and change to scrubs before his phone will ring with a summons to the OR unit.
It's Edgar, who has learned about the incident from TV. He doesn't know which staff members were involved, so that's why he's calling John: to find out whether either of them played a part in what went down.
"You wouldn't have gone on a killing spree if I'd died at Bastion." John's lip quirks up. "Though I have to say it's a pretty flattering mental image: you, grabbing an assault rifle and taking down a local Taliban cell to avenge my death like a really posh version of Rambo."
"Do you ever go to Pierowall for the evening?" Sherlock asks over steaming hot soup two hours later.
She senses the urgency in his actions, which makes her decide she won't make him wait ten extra minutes while she reviews her notes from their last session. "Hello, Sherlock. Go on in," she prompts, depositing the rest of her lunch back in the fridge.
"I asked Sherlock in the car what they'd talked about. He said that Walthard commented on his weight and canvassed what matters in Sherlock's life could be connected to the ulcer and his digestive issues. The decision for a nutritionist consult was made based on that conversation."
— there doesn't seem to be an acute airway compromise. "I'll get you paracetamol and ketoprofen and get us an Uber. I'll also find out who's on call for ENT."
John opens his mouth to ask what the hell that's supposed to mean, but Sherlock shifts in his seat so that he's facing the other direction, and every bit of his hunched form tells John that no more words will be spoken on this tonight.
a blood pressure — low, but it's there. It needs to be high enough to preserve his brain; Sherlock wouldn't forgive you if there was damage. He'd hold you accountable for not telling him about such a risk because he trusts you to tell him the truth. He wouldn't settle for anything less than perfection, not for anything less than his old self.
"General Duties Medical Officer. We ran a coalition field clinic in Qayyarah. Heavy insurgent activity."
It feels good enough to satisfy the sum total of his cravings — for now. He knows, however, that the cigarettes will make a part of his brain wonder if he could feel even more spectacular if he indulged in something else that would light up his neural networks like a Christmas tree.
"Better, I guess, after the storm died down. Wasn't easy, fending off the press when Sherlock wasn't here, but I get it, I understand why he left. Nobody knew–– I mean, I'd spotted some stuff; I thought the foundation CEO he was dating was a bit barmy, but we had no idea…" Andrew shakes his head. "When he got back from wherever he went, it was straight back down to business. His drive is back, I think. It was like whatever was distracting him being gone — well, we now know what it was — has brought things back to, if not the old normal, then a new one."
"Why would they need to call me as a witness? There are the CCTV tapes and the confession. It's an open-and-shut case. All those articles described him as
Sherlock grunts and flinches when a hand is shoved unceremoniously into his trousers, and when John's calloused fingers wrap around his cock, he knows he's done for. Thoughts are turning to treacle, his thighs are shaking with arousal and adrenaline. After only a few tugs of the circle John has formed with his fingers, Sherlock comes, and it nearly knocks his feet from underneath him.
Ardle's calloused fingers, the knuckles cracked like Japanese raku pottery, curl around Sherlock's opposite to tug him up from the chair. "Op yar get."
They rest together for some time, then decide that tea is in order. Not that Sherlock drinks his — instead, he paces in the sitting room in between changes into different pyjamas three times. The third try ends up with the shirt inside out, perhaps deliberately because he hates the feeling of seams. John runs him bath but despite several prompts, Sherlock forgets to get in. When John finally manages to coax him to enter the bathroom, he ends up throwing up in the sink and sitting on the cold floor with his forehead against the sink shaking and shaking and shaking.
There's rustling and the sound of the wardrobe opening. Sherlock listens carefully, and his ears pick up clinks of metal and the scuffle of John changing his shoes.
"221 Baker Street," Sherlock announces. "And don't try to get there through Marylebone Road. It's a carpark at this hour."
Sherlock has seen people react to the loss of a child. That deluge of emotion is profoundly unsettling, even to a bystander. Having never wanted children, he can't relate to it, and suspects that no one who hasn't experienced it first-hand can quite imagine what it's like. It's raw, violent, primal, unashamed of itself, free of the rules of social expectation. He has also observed how physical the experience is: the mind cannot contain all the pain, so it bleeds into the body.
His heart skips a beat from relief when Angus Ardle answers the phone on the second ring. Leaning against the wall in the kitchen, Sherlock explains his predicament. Ardle replies that he'll be "royt theeer", which Sherlock deciphers as a promise to render assistance in the near future.
John's hands had been absolutely steady, though, as he'd carried in the tray, and his words are perfectly enunciated.
John looks at him oddly — as if surprised by the question. "Yeah, there is. I need to prepare for that big reunion. Five classes at the same time, with talks and a gala dinner."
There's better china in the cupboard, and John now realises that his mother-in-law would probably tut him for putting a regular mug in front of an important visitor such as Joanna. He knows the two women have met.
"I don't need you to keep reminding me of him," Sherlock tells him. He's retreated a bit towards the opposite end of the sofa, picked up a pillow and arranged it on his lap like a shield.
When he looks at his friends, colleagues smiling with encouragements, his partner and some of the parents in the audience who seem to be desperately drinking in his every word, he doesn't feel like the freak so many have claimed he is.
"Hm?" Sherlock hadn't registered the words, save for his name, which had roused him out of the cocoon of his brain. Before, he used to keep several channels open for new information, but these days, he shutters away so easily and completely. “It’s not a kidnapping, it’s a homicide,” he says bluntly.
Sitting in the chair reserved for visitors in John's office, Sherlock feels as though he's been summoned into the headmaster's office. John is sitting on the corner of his desk, so close that their feet are nearly touching on the worn grey carpet. His arms are crossed, but he doesn't look angry.
They get home after a quiet commute, and John goes to the kitchen to flip through the stack of letters and other mail they've received. Sherlock has gone to the bathroom to wash his hands; the water's running.
You swallow, realisation dawning. This must be the reaction you've been expecting, the storm you've smelled in the air, the dark clouds in the horizon finally covering the elusive sun. Mycroft had anticipated as much: two days ago, he'd told you to just wait until it really sunk in with Sherlock what had happened. '
Sherlock swallows, the fight suddenly draining out of him. His shoulders slump where he's sitting in an old, uncomfortable office chair. He closes the lid of his laptop before making his way to the bed and clicking on a reading light. He sits stiffly at the foot while John is lounging in a sitting position with his back against the wall.
"It's not your fault," you say weakly. "You were probably just born with a weak spot in the valve structure."
Suddenly, Sherlock searches for your eyes, bewildered. The agitated restlessness seems to drain out as you watch his expression shift from purposeful to surprised. "John?"
"The StrepA test was positive, and I’m sure they’ll replace it with something else if the swabs or blood cultures come back with something more exotic."
A roadwork outside Euston Square tube station is slowing traffic down and eventually causes a stop. This allows John a thorough glance at Sherlock, who is turned furtively towards the window, fingertips resting on his lower lip. It's not his usual thinking stance of the fingers and upper half of his palms pressed together; no, it is worry that has etched lines on his forehead. John is sceptical that he's thinking about any of the topics he has just tried to raise; it is likelier that what haunts him is the same thing that had made him ask John to bring him back home.
. Such a toxic idea for someone like Sherlock, whose skills have never included emptying his mind and just enjoying the moment.
John frowns so hard he is practically squinting. "Sherlock, wh––– Oh God. You really thought I'd go alone, didn't you? Didn't you read the invitation I left on the kitchen table?"
Christian has dropped from his barstool and shifted closer. Now, he steps into the vee between Sherlock's legs, slides his arms around his waist. "Want a line?" he whispers into Sherlock's ear, palms sliding downwards so that he can hook his thumbs into the belt loops of Sherlock's trousers.
Sherlock shrugs. "Repeat customer, not a long-term admission. They wouldn't do a rhythm reversal from FA at the ward."
It's then you notice that there's a temperature reading on the monitor: 38,6. Slight fever. That's why he's lying there without even a blanket properly tucked up to his shoulders. There's paracetamol being infused. You tell yourself to calm down because these people know what they're doing.
"I don't want to hear it. Why would hearing about another patient who suffered an unnecessarily bad outcome cheer me up? Why would it help to know that we all make mistakes, most of which are probably preventable?"
Sherlock hates that John understands that he should ask whether it's alright to touch, to seek closeness, or whether Sherlock is too on edge, too close to a panic attack or — God forbid — a meltdown to tolerate it. He hates that John knows that about him. Shame should chase him out of the room but, instead of wanting to leave, to hide, his first impulse now is to beg John to fix it, to defuse such thoughts. John's arm hovers behind him and Sherlock leans back slightly. John wraps it around his waist, tugs him closer. The touch is grounding now that it doesn't come with performance anxiety over sex. Sherlock lets his head loll against John's shoulder, allows himself to be rearranged into as close an approximation of a hug as they can manage sitting side by side.
"Have you been eating?" John hates nagging, but if Sherlock is going to regain his strength and the muscle mass which this bed rest is going to cost him, he'll need better sustenance than fizzy drinks.
, hear me out. When you were a child, I constantly felt like I was failing, doing things wrong. But I couldn't quit. I
John can't find it in his heart to disagree. Like most doctors, he's been examined by the GMC but only once, thankfully, and the case didn't progress into an MPTS tribunal. There were no consequences to his career since he was found to be not at fault. He knows he got off easy, but even just that preliminary investigation had put a dent in his confidence — made him fear that any patient encounter, any mishap could lead to some random accusation and a punitive process blown out of proportion. It's a scary thought that real mistakes most often don't lead to consequences if a patient doesn't complain, whereas foundationless, harmful accusations can lead to processes where a doctor is ripped apart in the media while being able to do little to defend themselves even if the facts reported to the MPTS service aren't facts at all.
This brings on a sudden wave of nausea which must be plain on Sherlock's face because John then asks if he needs to lie down.
Sherlock steps onto the couch, then collapses down into an artful expanse of flouncing blue silk lapels, spindly limbs and messy curls.
"What does 'good' actually mean? Even though I probably made the right call with Sylvie Fairholme, when her husband showed up with a firearm it certainly looked like I didn't explain myself well enough. Am I a good doctor if my actions or things I neglected to say led to the deaths of two more people? What part of it is on me, if the A&E doctor made a hack job of explaining my decision-making? Should it have been me to deliver that explanation?"
A week passes, and he doesn't start sleeping at night. You tell yourself it's because intensive care messes up a person's sleep cycles, and that being confined mostly to bed at home will make it worse. Especially for someone like him who's never stuck to any sort of regularity with their rest. You tell him that over a breakfast he barely touches.
"Of course I try to do that! It's all I do, try to manage, and either he doesn't see it or the things I… or the things I do which require extra effort I don't want his praise for because it sounds so condescending."
You hitch your brows skyward, pursing your lips. "And you thought cannabis would be a fun new hobby? Was it something you did before?"
If Collings is amused by the rapid-fire explanation, he doesn't show it. "Right. Well, shall we?" He cocks his head towards the appointment room door.
"That's not a unilateral decision. We've done this a thousand times. Whenever you say that there's nothing, there sure as hell is something to talk about. You don't seriously still think we should have taken that patient into theatre tonight?"
The next day, just before noon, John rocks restlessly on his heels as he watches his mother-in-law seesaw between the kitchen and the buffet table set out in the cottage's back garden. Though his repeated offers of help have been accepted graciously, Violet still won't specify what he is supposed to do. The garden party serving as George's sixty-fifth birthday celebration is due to begin in an hour. Nobody expects all the guests to arrive at the same time since it's all meant to be more of an open house -type soiree than a formal, scheduled affair. George is helping here and there: carrying in glasses and plates of small treats and ignoring, in a well-mannered way, his wife's attempts at shooing him away because he is the one being celebrated.
You keep forgetting that his extensive theoretical knowledge doesn't mean that he is familiar with the clinical side of medicine. "With V-fib, you wouldn't be having a conversation with me and, as I said, you've had A-fib before."
He takes a deep breath. A few audience members who looked disinterested before have now perked up. The headline he'd chosen for this talk does not reveal much of his contents, and that had been deliberate.
John has crawled across the expanse to sit by him at the edge of the bed. "Can I––" he starts, then swallows, obviously planning to rephrase. "Is it alright if I…"
He's smarter than any system within the NHS or the GMC designed to try to catch people who use illicit substances. He'll outsmart them by not touching a single milligram of what he's buying. A vile sort of pride swells within him. This is one thing in which he knows more about himself than John and Pichler and his parents combined.
"Pulled his arterial line. Doctor Mansfield will do a new one once he's calm," Andrew explains. "BPs been stable, but we still need regular bloods and there could still be some hiccups."
To Sherlock, his husband sounds exhausted and ill and worryingly compliant. His brain being so fever-hazy must explain why Sherlock's expert protest about thoroughly exploring all the options and making sure that the most up-to-date knowledge is being employed has been filed and dismissed.
When reality finally begins creeping in, judging by what he can feel at his left buttock, John's is now working at his own cock. He comes with a thigh-shaking groan and rests his forehead against Sherlock's shoulder before pulling back. The separation of their bodies feels like a cold front.
She cocks her head towards the door, through which Sherlock has just disappeared. "Him, requesting you specifically. Five Oceans Watson still leaving a trail of cooling corpses in your wake, then?" She teases. "Or is he still a work-in-progress?"
He spends an hour and a half of working on the Alban Berg violin concerto, the sheet music for which he had recently picked up. He hasn't worked on many diatonic pieces before and had been looking forward to expanding his repertoire, but perhaps it's not the right time for such a piece. What he craves are the familiar emotional landscapes of pieces from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, so after gritting his teeth through the
The flat had been partly furnished when he'd rented it. He'd sold or donated away most of his sparse furniture before Afghanistan so that he wouldn't have to pay a lot for storage. Most of it had been acquired from thrift shops on a student and trainee budget or received as hand-me-downs from relatives; parting with it all wasn’t a hardship. He'd only brought two pieces from that loot to this flat: an old carved chest that had belonged to his grandmother and his dad's armchair. Though the dark red-and-black fabric is torn at some spots and the padding is flattened by decades of use, John wouldn't dream of abandoning it.
Sherlock, as a surgeon, has the privilege of marching into theatre when the subject of his operative intervention is already blissfully unaware of what's going on and incapable of distracting him with pointless prattle. Some surgeons are willing to do herniated disc repairs under spinal anaesthesia, but Sherlock doesn't see the point. Shouldn't the surgeon's concentration be given higher priority than some arbitrary justification anaesthesia seems to find in keeping them awake? He has wondered if it's because a spinal block patient requires much less time and effort to be moved out of the OR post-operatively than someone who's been given GA, intubated and then flopped onto their stomach for a back operation.
Wiggins gives him a thorough once-over. “Dunno what you look like. Private detective, maybe,” he suggests, chuckling, "coppers ain't got the kind of money that buys suits like yours."
There stands Mrs Hudson, glancing around with a strange sort of determined confoundment. "John!" she calls out instantly upon seeing you and begins the approach which ends in a bone-crushing hug. For her age and frail size, she is strong.
We can fix this; you can't just walk out of the hospital in your pyjamas with a heart rate of a hundred and ninety."
John looks tired, now. "You know as well as I do that Greg very much does. He can take any case off your hands. Boss, remember?"
She takes a pause, as if to consider what more to reveal. "Perhaps not. Let him take his time. I would not recommend putting any additional pressure on him to communicate.  He and I will be focusing on certain past events in future sessions so that their current impact could be defused."
Before Sherlock thinks to inquire about the mail, John takes his coat and starts asking him about his research. Once Sherlock gets going explaining the latest stages of all his projects ad the outcomes of today's meetings, dinner passes quickly and pleasantly.
Sherlock looks as though John's suggesting ingesting live worms. "And endure that awful slimy film on my tongue it creates? No, thank you."
You've armed yourself with data a bit like Sherlock conceals his insecurities and fears in factual information, and you push on. "Up to one in eight heart attack survivors develop PTSD. Stress-related anxiety, sleeping problems and mood issues on a smaller scale are dead common, Sherlock. You needed emergency surgery for heart failure — plenty bad enough that you'd still be affected."
"Yeer flittin'", the old man says, nodding and touching the edge of his moth-eaten flat tweed cap with his forefinger in a salute.
After they solve a double murder, Sherlock asks if John wants to come up to his flat. For what, he doesn't specify. A celebratory drink? A nightcap?
"Would you say that it is a fair estimation that, out of all of King's College Hospital's surgeons, you have the reputation for the worst patient communication skills?" Wareing asks, leaning his thighs against the defendant's table and looking rather pleased with himself.
He finally opens the door and enters the foyer — mostly just to shield himself from the biting wind.
Even though there are complications with John's reserved nature, things are still better than they were with Victor. John has a way of banishing that churning resentment, that fruitless frustration Sherlock has carried for Victor who cannot be yelled at or pushed away any longer. Not that Sherlock would have done such a thing. Had Victor crawled out of the grave and rang the doorbell, Sherlock would have welcomed him back — until he set foot on Westray and began to question a great many things.
3D endoscopy systems and virtual reality-assisted neurosurgical microscopes have broken through in the market, and King's is in the process of acquiring such a system. That means spending time and money training their neurosurgeons to use it. Unfortunately, something in Sherlock's particular neurology makes him exceptionally incompatible with all such gadgets, giving him debilitating nausea and vertigo.
"Andrew informed me that you wished to be present when he began showing signs of taking over breathing on his own. He's now done that — and more — within the last ten minutes."
Sherlock arranges himself onto the bed, close but not touching John. His fingers long to seek comfort from the warmth of his husband, but he's afraid he's done or said something wrong and it hurts when John recoils physically from him at such times.
John's tone is endeared — perhaps even a bit amused. The contrast to the version of him which Sherlock had just escaped from in his dreamscape is staggering. Feeling hag ridden and confused, he climbs to his feet and sits on the edge of the bed, fingertips tingling still from the adrenaline.
"He lost his wife," Sherlock answers plainly. "I can well relate to the pain of that, having come close to losing my husband twice. But I have channelled that pain and that anger into helping my husband and trying to protect our relationship, not into harming others."
"He had some damage to his heart from an infection years ago. It weakened the tendons connecting his mitral valve to his left ventricle. Those snapped, and he…" you decide to forgo explaining how close to death he'd been, "…the valve had to be replaced. There's a mechanical one in, now. You can hear it when it's quiet."
John is nearly back in the kitchen when Edgar jogs down after him. "Are you sure you wouldn't like me to contact a private security firm to cordon off the front door, to evict the media from there?"
"No. None available here, you know? He said he talked to Mum about looking into that when we moved to Liverpool, but she never…" John's lips tighten. "He just loved the stuff, you know. Whatever he could get his hands on. There're boxes of records in the attic; I should go through them but haven't got around to doing that yet."
"What?" he asks after an odd delay, looking completely lost when he looks up to face John's scrutiny. "No," he then dismisses after making some deductions based on what he's read there. "That's not…
"A patient whose brainstem has ceased functioning and who has thus lost the ability to breathe autonomously may die at any moment."
He studies your expression, seeking further evidence that he won't be dismissed and ridiculed. Your heart aches for him for having gone through things which have so shattered his confidence that others would respect what he thinks and feels.
"She still elects to serve a myopic system preoccupied with putting doctors through the wringer for every minor misdemeanour while the real problems of the NHS remain unaddressed."
He's tapping the phone with a nervous forefinger, tempted to use his boss as a sounding board and to vent his frustration at spending another night alone in the flat. Who else could he even ask for advice? He briefly considers texting his parents, but he doesn’t have much new information to share on John's status beyond what he'd told them via text several hours ago. Besides, he can anticipate the way his mother would drive him mad with her fussing. Sherlock knows Lestrade is on call for the second day in a row since he's the backup for a late-stage registrar; Sherlock doesn't want to intrude on his duties but then again, Dr Greg Lestrade is certainly capable of ignoring Sherlock when he thinks he needs to do so. He inhales, then taps out another message with his thumb, the fingers of his other hand drumming restlessly on the table.
"I know they told me to sit on the details until family has been notified, but Stephanie's dead, John. Shot at point blank."
Sherlock realises her opinion is likely useless since there is no guarantee she is more an expert on the protocols of the Royal Army Medical Corps or the specific tastes of one member thereof. Why is he wasting his time at this appointment?
, nor am I in any way repressed by my sexual desires, even if I'm not jumping at the chance to embrace some submissive bondage identity or whatever it is that you're insinuating."
"Perfect weather for cod-angling," John says, "the currents get weaker than usual around the rocky outcrops where they live in the deep bits, and they'll come out to eat."
,  you tell yourself, and then want to make that thought evaporate just like he sometimes swishes away invisible things he digs out from his Mind Palace. You wish you had one right now — all your knowledge and experience arranged neatly, ready to be deployed. If your mind is anything, it's not a palace, but a closet stuffed too tight, and you don't want to open it in case things start falling out. Things you don't want to look at.
to go back. I didn't enjoy surgeries at all during the next few weeks — I just kept fearing something would go wrong."
"From one of the aneurysms, yes. I operated too close to it, and it ruptured. I had hoped to avoid that, and I could have."
Once they're standing outside and Sherlock has stepped to the edge of the kerb to hail a cab, John digs out his phone and checks the GMC Fitness to Practise Guidelines. He sighs.
"In the sense that I think John would be the likeliest to leave, no. He seems to want to stay. That's on him."
"That's what strikes me as odd," John says, brows knitted together. "You, calling Greg in after you'd already managed to clip the artery. You handled the really tricky part alone, then called him in for what you described as the easier, less risky half of the operation. When you were still a reg, you gritted your teeth every time you had to have someone supervising you. This doesn't sound like something where you'd need or want Greg's help."
Now, he faces another revelation as he reaches for John's hand to pull him on top of him on the bed. He's never
No other story demonstrates better the destructive and ill-informed methods of Violet Holmes in raising his son than
Somehow, he doubts John would bother with such social mind games. He’s under the impression that army culls such nonsense out of a person, unlike the sorts of boarding schools his parents had sent their boys. They are fortresses of nonsense and archaic pretentiousness, and thus Mycroft had thrived in them. Sherlock considers it one of his greatest achievements that he was booted out of Eton. He wonders what John had been like as a schoolboy. Hard-working but rowdy? Mediocre but athletic? Surely, he had been popular rather than solitary, and sickeningly normal in many ways.
Lestrade pops his head into the OR fifteen minutes later. Sherlock is stitching up the dura and John has just injected the patient with some oxycodone to make sure they won't wake up in pain since the remifentanil infusion is so short-acting that it'll stop doing much for pain before the patient has even been taken to the recovery room or the ITU. Mrs Mills will be headed to the ITU since she'll need to be closely monitored overnight.
Sherlock's throat tightens. He has deduced that John's changing expression means that they are headed firmly towards a conversation which has the potential to be emotional and thus difficult to navigate. All he can do is hope that John will be that navigator while he bounces from wall to wall trying to communicate what he really means while trying to manage John's expectations.
Angus seems amused by something in Sherlock's reaction to the old bike, revealing a set of tobacco-yellowed teeth behind that grey, lichen-like beard. "Ne'er", he says, and it sounds like a promise, "left m' on the roood." He spits over his shoulder as though for good luck or superstition, then climbs on.
He's startled when Angus claps a gasoline-smelling palm on his shoulder. "London says er week," Angus declares.
"The fact of the matter is that this erroneous report exists," Dr Spray says apologetically. Regardless of what happened in the OR, it will be investigated, and it explains what happened."
Violet glances towards the window; bare branches are dancing outside in the brisk wind. It had been November then, too, everything outside bare or decaying and dying when George had driven her to Brighton for that… other procedure. They didn't tell anyone. It wasn't something people talked about. Back then, many people didn't think it was a good enough reason to do it that another child would not be good for the family. She recalls her own mother declaring the whole thing to be something not becoming a good Christian after reading some newspaper article. She had passed away when Sherlock had been seven. She'd often told Violet that she just needed to discipline her children better — that autism was just some fashionable word for incompetently raised children. 'I expected better from you than to fall for such nonsense,' she had told her. After the death of her second husband — Violet's father had passed away many years before and she had remarried — she'd moved to France to a house inherited from distant relatives, so the boys never saw their maternal grandmother much. That is something Violet does not regret. Camille Vernet had been cold and relegated childcare to nannies. Giving up caring for her own children like that was something Violet had sworn never to do, and she'd kept that promise to herself.
Bill Wiggins is scarfing down what looks like a tuna sandwich, casually leaning against a streetlight, when Sherlock rounds the corner of Baker Street and Melcombe Street.
We don't have sex that night. Instead, the very thought that it's possible paralyses me in the doorway of what is now our bedroom, and everything is suddenly too much.
'THX FOR THE INFO. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF, YEAH? FAMILY'S ARRANGING A MEDICAL FLIGHT TO BELGRADE ONCE WE SAY ZEZELJ STABLE ENOUGH TO MOVE OUT OF ITU.'
oversee the proceedings and the use of drones to survey wrecks not identified or explored on their prior trip — will be Sherlock.
Sherlock dismisses her with a flick of his wrist. "Unless you can deliver opiates, there's very little use for you."
Sherlock logs in and opens the records. His surgical notes tend to be slight less concise than most neurosurgeons' because he wants to make sure he can glean all the important details from them ever years later to remind himself of the case. In his notes for Mr Zezelj he states the indication for the operation, gives an account of the consent process, details the operation chronologically and finally, gives his instructions for post-operative care.
"Depression. PTSD. Other anxiety and mood disorders. None of which will get better by sticking one's head in the sand."
He could be pretty self-sufficient by now, with the help of the PT he's chased out three times, now, with his sharp tongue. He could manage most of his clothes, walking around the ward, even going down to the cafeteria with an IV pole, but he won't. He's done a 180 from ignoring his Transport and thinking it's indestructible to acting as though just breathing deeply might break it. You no longer have to fear him overdoing it, but as it happens, there is such a thing as
John delivers a kiss right in front of his ear. "I'll give you a private tour of the academy," he promises, winking.
What follows is an interrogation. This John Watson seems to have deduced that Sherlock needs all the help he can get to manage in his new residence and starts going through a list of things he thinks are needed for that. Have you got this, have you got that…
"What happened?" Sherlock demands, tone as sharp and keen as his gaze. He hushes Natch, presses a palm gently to the dog's back to stop him from trying to keep up. It is a heart-breaking sight: his left side does not appear to be functioning at all.
"But you still want some poor bugger to stick a needle in their back to create a potentially spine-threatening bleed since the patient's fully anticoagulated?"
He'd been assisting Mycroft with some MI6 nonsense again. The agency had extracted three relatively high-ranking Russian military operatives from the war zone in Sevastopol after they had leaked information that the Russia never even intended to respect the Kharkiv pact between the Federation and Ukraine concerning the control of Crimea. Now, someone was hunting them down one by one, and Mycroft had told Sherlock he needed an outsider in finding a mole in the MI6 ranks since someone was obviously tipping off their opponents regarding the agency's moves. When a fourth defector — a Russian spook stationed in London — materialised with information and concrete proof of a larger, secret pact between Russia and its former states regarding the seizure and division of several Ukrainian territories beyond just Crimea due to their natural resources, protecting the man became a priority. In the process, MI6 caught wind of an operation seeking to take down all the agency operatives connected to the case to prevent details of the so-called Glezyieve tapes coming to light. Sherlock found his own name on that list and barely escaped a kidnapping attempt, which would have likely resulted in a well-concealed murder. He'd broken several ribs and his ankle in the process and was in agony by the time he was escorted to a safehouse.
"A calling to get killed so that poncy paper-pushers like you can move on to the next crisis and whip out yet another batch of disposable idiots to shove at the enemy of the week?"
"Yes, though I've no idea how long it's been without power. It's one of those old freon monstrosities." Sherlock hadn't dared to open its door, fearing what might lurk inside if the previous tenants have just left without emptying it. He is not squeamish, and sometimes stores forensic experiments in his own at home, but what's in this fridge won't be his leftovers or mould cultures.
with Victor all went up in flames, eventually. She took it as proof that he was just as vulnerable, gullible, weak and incapable of human interaction. Hence her concern that John was just the same as
The one John feels right now has little to do with sex and shouldn't be very different from Sherlock's. John wants them to meld to each other, to wake up safe and close and warm like this. Had Sherlock's earlier nervousness been an internal struggle about whether he wanted or should do this, or was it just an amalgamation of many anxieties difficult to pick apart?
Sherlock breathes out through his nose, and his expression shifts from warily curious to angry and disappointed. "You just want to avoid litigation."
For the next hour, Sherlock tries to come up with inconspicuous ways to stim where he's sitting in the day room where patients and family members come and go, borrowing magazines or books, having tea or just stretching their legs. At one point Sherlock had allowed himself to pace, but that seemed to make the others occupying the room uneasy.
All he needs to do is keep his head straight for just three days, and then it'll be Friday and he'll fly in for the weekend to see Sherlock.
"Does suffering entail others to treat their partners…" she trails out, wanting to avoid describing John Watson, even indirectly, in a way that would cause Sherlock's claws to come out again. "…in a way they don't deserve?"
John had been right in one thing: the change in surroundings provides enough distraction that Sherlock can almost pretend something in the back of his mind isn't dragging things down like a trawler scouring the darker layers of his psyche. If he busies himself with being a house guest, his brain finds it harder to scare up things which he'd then have to waste energy trying to expel.
"My name is Sherlock Holmes. I am a Consultant in Neurosurgery at London's King's College Hospital. I received my medical degree from Cambridge along with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering. I am the inventor of several models of anti-siphon shunt valves which should vastly improve the lives of many children and, by extension, their parents."
"We all have constructive traits and destructive traits, benign defences and ones that only end up hurting ourselves when we employ them. I’ve read that even Mother Teresa could be quite a temperamental woman with a hurtful tongue. Emotional space and the right to it, Sherlock — that's all. I apologise if I failed to explain myself well the last time we spoke. All I wish for you and John is that you feel as equal as possible in your marriage, and that there's room for both of you in it."
"Caught with their trousers around their ankles with their abysmal taste in picking CEOs, it appears they have adopted a rather charitable attitude towards the Centre and sponsored two five-year positions, one for a new PhD student and another for a diving specialist who would help plan and oversee underwater excavations."
he could have made such a mistake, who's to say it couldn't happen again? What if he drills a biopsy hole into the wrong side? What if he makes an incision in the wrong intervertebral space? One mistake, and people will say that
"Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by the brandy, of course we shouldn't since you haven't since I left––"
. He had a fever and was in a lot of pain.” There’s another brief panic as Sherlock realises that he’d overlooked something: a rare, but potentially severe complication.
As always during their Sussex visits, they're staying in Sherlock's old room that's barely wide enough for a double bed. Still, John never protests because he enjoys the prompts it gives to think about Sherlock growing up.
John shakes his head and adopts a determined stride towards his lover.They haven't seen each other — Skype and phone calls and emails just aren't the same — in two months. After two weeks of bliss on Malta, Sherlock had returned home, and the next month had been busy as he re-established control over the Centre and its finances and fended off reporters desperate for a comment from the man who had brought James Moriarty's business empire down. Moriarty himself had left the country, or so Sherlock had told John.
His train back deposits him at Victoria Station. As he heads to the exit to Buckingham Palace Road, the sound of a bow on strings perks up his ears. A cellist is busking in a busy corridor, a worn hat on the floor containing many coins and even some notes. Londoners are discerning customers when it comes to busking since they are treated to many talented ones; judging by the loot, this one must have some talent. Sherlock slows his steps but does not stop until he recognises the melody. And that's when he feels as though someone has kicked him in the chest.
She turns off the ceiling light, leaving on the small, round lights above the counter and stove. It makes Sherlock feels as though he's on a stage with the spotlight directed right at him.
Mr Zezelj looks perplexed, now. "You told me, before surgery, that anerism can bleed. I know this because you tell me, I accept risk because what else option I have? I have tumour, I have these other things, all other surgeon say no."
This seems to make him introspective again, cocooned in the grey linens of his duvet. "I shouldn't dwell on it. As you told me, there wasn't much of a decision to be made. Submit — or die."
John licks his lower lip, fixes his gaze on Sherlock. "I won't accept it. You've told me I see but I don't observe but I
"I'm here for you, and you only. I'm here because Mycroft and I felt you should have something to fall back on if I couldn't be with you anymore.”
You realise she doesn't know. To you, she's more than a landlady but still a landlady; to Sherlock, she is clearly a dear friend. You secretly enjoy watching them interact; Sherlock never speaks of her with the exasperation reserved for his parents. From her, he allows such open caring and mollycoddling you doubt he'd welcome from anyone else. She's a chosen surrogate parent, someone who sees him,
There is nothing more for Sherlock to do here than to leave, to go home without his husband. "Text me if you…"
In Icelandic, church is "kirkja". In Norwegian, it's "kirke" and in Swedish, "kyrka". Don't ask the Finns; the closest they ever got to the Vikings was being pillaged by them. (They do say "kirkko" but altogether their language has nothing to do with the rest of the Nordic ones. Poor proto-Finns were probably headed elsewhere but took a wrong turn somewhere and ended up where nobody understands a word they say.)
"Not extensively. He is recovering from surgery, as I explained on the phone. He shouldn't be burdened needlessly with other people's problems."
you wonder, stupidly, because he's looking right at you now, and there is something pleading in his gaze.
"There is still a lot to unpack here, and I think you would greatly benefit by seeking a therapist of your own."
'. That was among many of his statements which had raised some eyebrows, and you had chuckled not-even-that-secretly. They should be all used to the terrible, terrible, humour between you and Sherlock by now. You love those oddly private moments with Sherlock amid a crowd — it's you against them,
Two crime scene technicians are summoned to verify what Sherlock has just said. They find a spatter and pooling patterns on the floor and the surrounding cabinets.
There is an eyeroll so artful John is tempted to laugh. He suppresses the urge with the skill of someone who's had to stifle his amusement many times at the antics of patients and fellow soldiers.
"Has disciplinary action within the Trust or by the GMC ever been directed at you based on these areas of professional conduct?"
Holmes says this with his eyes cast downward and away from Joanna. His tone is quiet, distant, as though he's talking about something he read in a paper. She has made a note of his ability to dissociate which must be useful at work, but when it comes to his emotions, it just makes him float further away from the chance of understanding them. "Logical, wouldn't you say? On both occasions, John developed a sudden illness requiring help which you could not provide."
You appreciate Marsh's conscientious manner of explaining things, of emphasizing what is normal and not inadvertent wakefulness. Sherlock is answering him with less irritation and anger and looks to be really listening to the answers.
I've not been entirely honest with John; it's not just the cough that persists. He doesn't know about the rash on my torso or the night sweats, about the chills or the sore throat. Mostly, it's like a very persistent head cold in its early stages. He's seen the enlarged lymph nodes, but those could be anything.
An open skull fracture allows for some extra brain swelling in an injury, since the soft matter of the brain is no longer just confined within its usual boundaries. However, when an injury is severe enough to cause uncontrollable swelling, bursting out of the natural bony holes and the wound will inevitably lead to brain death.
"Whenever we write statements for patients, we never talk in absolutes. At this point, we need to treat your claim of a mistake as a theory, a matter to be investigated. It doesn't exclude the possibility that it happened; it just makes it sound a bit less…"
With a heavy heart, John calls his brother-in-law. Mycroft listens to the news with little commentary; he does not seem surprised when John gives him the bad news, probably because his secretary has been keeping an eye on the air traffic situation.
patients, Sherlock. What about that opera singer? What about all the other people you have told us about whose surgeries have been a success? Do they care, after you've removed their brain tumours, whether you said all the right things? I don't often say the right things to people," Violet argues, "but I manage. We both do."
Last night, John had lain in bed thinking about duty and compartmentalisation and empathy. He'd thought back to when he'd come home from Afghanistan and failed to see how his behaviour had affected Sherlock. John had delayed returning to work because a part of him had known that he had no sympathy or patience even for his own crisis, let alone for patients. Things had come to a head when Sherlock had been injured as well and confined into a halo vest for months, which was an exquisite torture for someone with his sensory issues. As a physician, John should have seen the signs, plain as day, of depression and crisis and pain and relationship problems which Sherlock was exhibiting, but he'd been too wrapped up in his own pain to do anything but lash out at the one person who loved and needed him the most. A doctor completely drained of empathy is a dangerous creature.
"Please tell him how sorry I am that I wasn't there today. Tell him I love him and that I miss him so much," John tells his brother-in-law.
Sherlock wouldn't have pegged Dr Kim for a tattletale, but he can't say the same for the rest of yesterday's OR team. They're all experienced, all skilled, but… he can't read people, can't predict what they would or would have told others.
"There's nothing wrong with the records," Sherlock replies, barely keeping his rage in check. "He's gone, then. Out of your hair."
"He killed a person, nearly killed another. You have to keep that in mind, and you don't have any obligation to summon even the slightest bit of sympathy for him."
"It's just that…" Edgar starts, switching off his tablet and sliding it into his messenger bag Clearly, he feels very uneasy about voicing these worries. "…I've had to remind you of many things in the past few weeks. You're not normally this…"
impressive, really. They never do, not to you. Especially not the serial killers. Their visible humanity as they are caught strips the lore and the legend away, leaving just a person with depraved tastes and an impulse control problem. What interests you are not them but watching Sherlock best their efforts at remaining uncaught, listening to him strip through their rationalisations and deflections as he gets them to confess. '
"Only you," John says with a grin, and it takes me a moment to realise he's referring to the visual similarity between the piece of somewhat burnt toast I have placed on the table next to the photos, and the blackened murder victims in them.
"That's standard after cardiac surgery," you reassure her. "I'll ask the nurses when it would be convenient for you to come."
You wonder if she has some kind of sixth sense, because she should be used to long absences of her tenants by now. She looks concerned, demands answers with her stern schoolmistress' gaze.
"Because King's College Hospital NHS Trust caved under media pressure. They want to look like they're doing something, so they've decided to make an example of me."
Even though Sherlock had entered a war zone in Afghanistan to bring John home, he's never had a gun pointed at his head or a person shot in front of him. And, he couldn't even react to any of it at first because he had a patient on the table. John realises that all of what he couldn’t even begin to process, must be coming out now. He doesn't ask Sherlock to recall the events in the OR; he's done enough of that with the police. If anything, he needs to get his mind off of it.
A sickening pity and overwhelming affection making your own heart pound in your ears, you watch as Sherlock rips off the last of the bandage.
“Collings sent a message when he left the OR to say I can go home tomorrow afternoon, assuming I feel a bit better.”
"John," Greg pleads, "have I not had his back before? Have I not been there for the two of you? I've tried talking to him––"
As a personal favour Mike had volunteered, he's handling Sherlock's case though he's usually at the outpatient clinic or consults for the A&E department instead of handling things at the ward.
"Yes," John breathes out. "I want you to handle all that. I trust you to be discreet, to direct all inquiries to the police, and to say that we don't have any comments."
"Medically, you've got a stellar record without any disciplinary action pertaining to medical competence. It wouldn't be fair to endanger that just for the sake of something that could happen to anyone. You said you mixed up the sides — guess whether there's ever been wrong kidneys and wrong knees operated on in this hospital? We have all those checklists not because these things don't ever happen — we have them because they do. It's a bit… I don't know… martyr-like to insist on getting ripped apart by official processes for something that's not like you."
"Sir, let me direct you to the waiting area of the fifth floor," he is finally told by a desk clerk.
"I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to monitor your recovery before you were flown home," Sherlock explains. "That is why I wanted to have this conference, to see how you are getting on." He refrains from using the word 'recover' because it stings; his mistake is what the man is now recovering from instead of just the expected after-effects of brain surgery.
The System puts people through a series of assigned relationships in order to determine who their Perfect Match is. John believes that it works; Sherlock really, really doesn't. One of them is probably going to be wrong.
Sherlock whirls around to face him, brows hitched towards his hairline. Finally, an honest reaction, a non-calculated one.
Once again, John is clueless. He doesn't understand that even needing a fellow surgeon to stand beside him, watching over him, is as good as dropping all his instruments on the floor and swooning like some Victorian maiden.
John had told the officers that they'd been fighting, that it was his fault. He had a bleeding head wound and was demonstrating symptoms of a possible concussion, if not more, so the interview was left brief on site. John was taken to hospital and kept under observation for seventeen hours before signing himself out against recommendations. When he'd been transported from the scene, his daughter had been barely alive, still. She'd died four hours later in the hospital. Sherlock wonders if John had seen her there before she succumbed to her injuries. The investigating officer had gone to see him at home the next day, brought him in for an interview. John had stated that they'd been arguing in the car, and that must've distracted her. He says he dimly recalls her telling him to fasten the child's car seat into the back of her car — it had been in his since he'd been on holiday, looking after her during the days while she worked instead of taking her to daycare that week. He was reticent to discuss what they'd fought about that night. The officers conducting the interview had informed John that the child's seat had been thrown towards the driver's seat which was simultaneously being crushed in by the collision. The interview had to be terminated at that point because John had been too distressed to continue.
His eyes flutter as he strains to focus on you. He looks indignant, approaching horrified. "Plush on–– on–– plastic. Disgstn."
You have no idea how he could run the distance of half of London and not even get all that winded even though he never really exercises on purpose. Nature has gifted him with some very wonky genetics.
A-fib, atrial fibrillation: the heart has lost its ability to retain sinus rhythm and the atriums are contracting rapidly and chaotically while the ventricles are trying to keep up as best they can. This is not a resuscitation rhythm, but when too slow or too fast can lead to a threat for life.
He has no right to say Sherlock shouldn't be in that OR today — he has no right to decide that for another doctor without solid evidence that they're impaired. He can't be there all the time to protect Sherlock from his own occasionally lacking self-awareness and going to Greg would only prove what Sherlock may fear already: that he's not fit for his work right now. Greg's interference would also embarrass him in front of others, which he already fears his mistake will have done. It would signal to Sherlock that even John thinks he's not worthy of his reputation, that he has no insight, that he'd be a danger to the patient.
"Your brother helped your husband make sure you had a support system if you needed it," Ella says. "What's the harm in accepting that help?"
The day has been tiring in a good way. The market opening had been Violet's show, not his, so he didn't have to care what people there thought of him. Somehow, it hadn't even occurred to worry about what nitpickery Violet might come up with concerning how he conducted himself.
You shouldn't have asked, because he climbs to his feet, eyes blazing with rage. "And you wouldn't? You'd just content yourself with all the lost time, all the not knowing, with everything you weren't told and don't understand?"
I have a chronic illness. I'm managing it. Not a single day will pass when I won't be reminded of it by the blister packets I punch through. That shouldn't feel as crushing as it still does.
The house, sitting on the shore, must be threatened to be lapped by rising water during storms. What Sherlock assumes in the lagoon-like beach he'd been left on last night is off to the north, judging by how the tree branches he'd made note of last night are sequestered. There is another house off to the west, too far and too small to analyse whether it's even inhabited. What looks like abandoned fields surround the house assigned to him, now nothing but grassland and small bushes. The oak tree he's standing under is the only shelter local land birds must have available, and Sherlock can see several nests on the branches above. The rocks lining the sea are craggy and low here, but the land rises dramatically towards the lighthouse. There must be handsome cliffs beyond the drop, and Sherlock makes a mental note to go explore that area once he gets himself settled.
"Hardly," Sherlock scoffs. "I had a trial run of those after Andreason died." Mycroft had helped him when he'd relapsed. He'd known he'd have to choose between the coke and his surgical career, and just like with Victor, he'd chosen the future.
The following hours are a test to the patience of all concerned: nothing seems to help as his pain level increases and his frustration builds. There's oxycodone, more paracetamol, even ketamine with midazolam.
"After my arrival at King's College Hospital as a transferring registrar, a complaint was made by a fellow surgeon about my conduct and diagnostic management of a case at my prior training unit. These allegations were found to be untrue."
