“Well, I didn’t say anything about retirement,” Dean says. “I can still do these kinds of jobs, Cas. I want to keep doing it. It keeps me sharp.”
Dean tires as they’re finishing a third movie. It’s very late by now, and he’s yawning every couple of minutes. Dean shuts the TV when the credits roll, patting Cas’s thigh as he gets up.
“Sure, let’s talk. Made any good investments lately?” Dean asks. Cas looks at him. “Let’s keep trying the radio.”
“Yeah, you’re bleeding pretty bad too,” Dean says, though he seems relieved now that Cas is talking to him. Dean touches his forehead, brushing away a lick of blood from his hairline, and despite the state of things, Cas’s body flushes warm. “Witches are some nasty fucking bitches, huh?”
“OK, what is up with you?” Dean demands. “I know you’ve been having a hard go of it lately, but newsflash, Cas: Everything sucks! Always has, probably always will. But it’s more than that. You ain’t acting like yourself.”
Her apartment is small but stacked to the ceiling with a mix of ugly antiques and pop culture merchandise. Cas shuffles close to Dean while Charlie finds them some beer and then gets right down to brass tacks with Dean about their LARP thing. They try to explain it to Cas, but it seems like a lot of running around in the woods dressed in costumes, and he doesn’t understand the point. They’re planning some kind of festival for the spring.
“If you’re implying that you want to shut my mouth for me, then I’m pretty sure you can do that back on Earth,” he points out.
“I’m not a duck, Dean,” he says, pulling his hand off of Dean’s shoulder. He squints at the ground for a long moment as though gathering his thoughts; and when he looks back at Dean, it’s hard and unyielding as the stone Dean once thought that angels were made of. He watches Cas shake off the clay with clear, earnest eyes.  “You taught me what love
Cas’s hand stays in his hair for a time, and then it drifts to his shoulder. After awhile he folds it back in his lap, but Dean feels the phantom weight of it brushing across his skull the whole rest of the drive home.
At this, Cas sits up straighter, all ears now and definitely not thinking about cheese, fried and breaded. Well maybe just a little bit. It’s not his fault: He only discovered mozzarella sticks five minutes ago.
shirt again, a tee that’s evidently becoming a favorite of his, along with one that made Dean double up laughing in the store because it shows two beer mugs snapping pencils and the words “education is important, but cold beer’s importanter!” arching overhead. Dean can’t decide if the view makes him want to laugh or kiss him again, so he does both, smiling as he brings Cas back close.
It’s a nice song, nicer when he’s being tightly wrapped around and held against Dean’s mouth without any freedom to pull away. He pushes his hands underneath Dean’s t-shirt and feels him nudge his thighs closer, already pressed together chest to chest.
Cas breathes out a laugh, pulling him closer. He pauses an inch away from Dean’s shoulder and doesn’t press his lips there: Instead he brushes his nose against his white undershirt, closing his eyes and breathing in the nearness of him. Cas rolls his forehead against Dean’s shoulder and shuts his eyes.
Cas enjoys taking care of his plants. It’s calming and peaceful and he can clear his mind when he does it. There’s just him and his flowers and the rock music he leaves playing on low all the time, because he saw once on an episode of Mythbusters that flora prefers that genre to grow its greenest. Cas hums along to the song that’s playing and spritzes water on his aloe plant. He’s going to start making his own medicine; he and Sam used to talk for hours about the upsides of natural, holistic cures, although now he mostly watches nature documentaries stoned with Charlie and buys every plant that they mention has any additional properties whatsoever.
Dean moves first, but Cas bridges the gap just as much and lets himself get pulled in until Dean’s kissing him: hard at first, then softer and sweeter until his hands loosen their death grip on Cas’s t-shirt. Dean smells even better up close,
Cas eases further down the bed so they’re level, now. Dean forcibly blows out the breath he’s been holding and shifts back just slightly on the mattress. It’s hardly even an open door but it sends Dean’s heart hammering in his chest anyway—he realizes his eyes are open now, darting all over the wall he’s facing in the dark. Jesus Christ, is it supposed to feel like this? It was so easy the few other times he’s tried, with Cassie, with Carmen in that one djinn dream. Now his body feels like it’s on fire, and Dean makes himself move another inch. He’s done way more debasing, vulnerable and sexual things:
But Cas is back the next weekend, timely as an atomic clock. This time he manages to line up right with Dean’s lunch break; Dean prefers to believe it’s a coincidence, rather than that he was spying.
He focuses more closely on screwing in the light. Cas helps him down with a hand on his elbow when he’s done, and Dean hauls the ladder over to install the lights along the front lawn that will go on automatically when they detect motion. They go down the row together, shuffling the ladder along the line.
Ben rolls his eyes. He says, “If he wants to see you so bad, he can knock on the front door like everyone else.”
Dean clears his throat. The word hangs thin in the air between them, and seems meaner the longer that it lingers. He reaches out and fiddles with the wood he was drilling before, hears it make an unpleasant sound in the loose hinge. He should fix that, make it tighter. The thought barely appears before Cas twists his wrist just so and screws it together.
Cas shrugs. Sometimes they play Connect Four or something. Mostly Charlie thinks it’s hilarious to call it
Cas’s second cut went better than the first. It’s not perfect but it’s much less shaky. Dean shut the power saw the manual way and jostled Cas’s shoulder.
, he thinks into the dark still room, and kisses it into Dean’s mouth, into his cheek and neck and the stray splatter of freckles on his shoulder,
Claire and Alex snicker. Dean raises his fist, and the girls exchange a glance that Cas sees them share a lot around himself, but Claire bumps it.
“Down, boy,” he says mildly. Dean’s gun clicks, and Crowley puts up his hands. “No need to test out your trigger finger there, Dean. I come in peace.”
“God made all of this...the trees, the metal, all the raw materials.” Cas looked around at everything gathered in Dean’s yard, the tools and workshop materials and the bare patch of land where Dean planned on erecting a two-bedroom from the green ground up. “And humans turned it into...this. You use your talents, your God-given abilities and the nature that He gave you and turn it into something incredible...and then you consider it so mundane, so
“Hey, Cas,” he says amicably, because he stopped getting annoyed about these late night phone calls on day three. “You’re in bed already?”
Sam’s ritual happens on a Sunday morning. Unlike Crowley, he doesn’t beg or barter or lie; he just lays there comatose hooked up to his machine. Cas feels bad for not visiting before, it’s true, but he’s here now—though the sight of Sam like this is twisting up his stomach, an unpleasant and almost nauseating knot right in the center of his gut where his heaviest emotions always lie for good at bad. Cas offers to be the one to do it, but Dean insists it’s his brother and the last thing he needs is Cas walking out of here with any more scars.
“It makes me feel good to take care of things,” Cas says when he’s catching his breath. His fingers trail down Dean’s sides. “This garden...Miracle…”
“So we’re done gathering all the ingredients, but there’s still the matter of timing,” Cas is telling him, and Dean glances down the ladder to where Cas is holding the bottom steady, “and in the meantime Hannah’s leveraging a series of attacks to subdue the outer circles of their main base of operations.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean mutters, and goes to rescue his man from the mind-boggling human phenomenon that is an Elvis Presley record.)
“No curtains,” Dean says, wrinkling his nose. He pushes some brown liquor across the bar and Cas takes a heavy seat.
“It’s OK. You don’t have to explain anything to me,” Charlie says more seriously. She reaches out and finds a nacho that’s absolutely heaped with melted cheese, then resettles herself in the couch more comfortable.
In the morning, Cas takes his cereal in his room and watches cartoons, stretched out and still robed from last night’s shower. He hears Dean get up and clatter around the kitchen around noon but it gets silent an hour or so later. He assumes Dean’s gone to look into things for Sam, as he usually does until it’s time to work on his car. He won’t tell anybody, but Dean’s always secretly craved routine as much as he hates it.
The witch, who calls herself Sophie, loses her shawl on the rolling chair and leans back against the desk. Her legs are long and exposed, drawing the eye as she crosses them and raises her glass. Cas, painfully aware of her leer without the distractions of the club around them, drinks more of his cocktail than is perhaps considered polite when he
Previous to meeting Cas, he didn’t think it was possible to file ‘crazy kinky monster sex’ under the same category as ‘making love,’ mostly because he’s spent his entire life shying away from both of those things. Regardless, it turns out Cas can make his angel wings manifest on this plane of existence if he wants to, and just because Dean can’t
“I’m going to have to pass,” Dean says. “Sorry. Got to do some reading on a vamp thing that Garth put me onto, so…”
“Of course. Because she is. As are all of God’s creatures,” he says, getting to his knees. Dean lets the dog go and she bounds at Cas, knocking him on his ass. “He didn’t mean that, baby. The odds of you being born and us meeting on that night, at that Gas N Sip, it’s astronomical.
“Are you close to finding your shapeshifter?” he asks, because his chest is aching and he wants to tell Dean goodnight to his face for once. It’s frustrating that he can’t fly over there to help this all go faster. A lot of things piss him off nowadays, though, and it’s old hat to push this aside along with his other hang-ups.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re above all this human shit, right?” Dean turns away from him. “So why are you here, then, if you didn’t come to apologize? Just taking a snack break in between all that torture?”
One year ago when Dean stood here on this spot, it was sunny. The warmth glinted off the windows of the car so Sam almost didn’t see himself in the reflection. For moments, when Dean squinted up with his eyes swollen, that brightness was all that he could see, touching all across the earth like one last, great cosmic joke. But today it’s cold, windy and feels as though it’s going to rain. The sky is an off-blue layer of clouds.
Cas looks at him. Dean looks at Cas. Finally, Cas takes his hand off of Dean’s arm and then looks at his own palm like he’s expecting to find a message written there. With his hands up, he backs up toward the couch again. Dean lets himself lay back to the bed, forces each limb to relax. Cas sits down.
Cas sits back in his seat, not expecting this. He suspects that heat in his face is translating to color, although he hopes it won’t filter through under these lights.
Lisa has perfected that sad little smile. She’s still stroking his hair, though, so it doesn’t really cut like it should.
“Things must, uh…” Dean pauses. His fork stabbed jagged perforations through his breakfast, raking around in a cascade of maple syrup. “Things must be really going well for you up there.”
“You’re right,” Cas says, and Dean looks at him again in surprise. “You’ve paid your debts, Dean, more than what you owed. If you want this...I cannot begrudge you retirement. I
“Nah, don’t worry about it. You look great.” Dean shoots him a grin. “See you later. Lock up before you, uh, Apparate on out of here.”
“Yes,” Cas frowns at him, “probably. Or I could make you think you were in a house. Remember Zachariah’s room? But I was under the impression that you placed the value in the work itself, not the final product.”
An angel blade drops out of his sleeve, and he’s halfway across the room before anybody else even reacts. Dean’s beginning to see why other people keep insisting that they need Cas for VIP missions, even when he doesn’t want to go; he’s a hell of a fighter. He dodges around Hannah and goes right for Ishim’s neck, backing him into a corner in seconds. Cas swipes up to cut his throat, knocks Ishim’s blade into the air, grabs it in his free hand and spins around to plunge the left one into one of the other’s chest all in one sinuous move. He blocks the third angel with his free blade as he’s yanking the other out.
“No.” Cas puts his hand beside the extra condiments, crowding Dean closer to the grill. “I was hoping that you could help us.”
In the same second, Dean’s throat feels like it’s closing up. He gasps, hands flying to his neck so quickly that he loses his balance and falls sideways, landing hard on his elbow. The witch smiles.
“Cool...Cool, cool, cool.” Charlie sucks in a breath. “All the same, I’d like to get out of the bunker until that ex-psycho is gone. Cas, you’re gonna take me around town.”
“So, what?” Dean asks, stabbing at his food. “You felt bad enough to make me a pet, so you could get a second chance at playing guardian angel?”
Dean seems a little surprised by the change of pace, and he needs a moment to get into it, but he’s brought down to the pillows easily enough. Cas nuzzles into his neck, pressing his mouth there so he can feel it vibrating against his lips when Dean talks.
Dean gestures him across the table. Crowley and Cas both lean in. When he’s sure he has their attention, Dean demands, right up in Crowley’s face, “Do I look like I was born yesterday to you?”
Cas’s mouth pulls up in a sneer, but before he can reach out and slam Crowley’s head into the table, Dean pulls him back. His hand splays on Cas’s chest, right over his pounding heart, and he shoves Cas back.
Dean agreed to meet Crowley at a café in town, insisting that a) he can handle himself and b) they turned Crowley human in order to close the Gates of Hell, so he’s not much of a danger to them regardless. Cas is still deeply shaken by the idea of letting him go in alone; Crowley may not be juiced up, but he’s still a nasty son of a bitch, and Cas doesn’t trust him. Call it an ex-partner’s intuition.
He stares off into the middle-distance—watching the road but not really seeing it. The car bumbles over the line into the next town, and Cas blows out a big breath.
“Cry yourself to sleep at all over being a real boy like us?” he asks. For such an insensitive question, Cas nonetheless recognizes a gentle voice, and he smiles briefly to himself especially as Dean’s free hand blindly finds his knee and squeezes there at the same time.
, so they could enjoy things like dinner and downtime with a TV. He’s been alone with his own thoughts for two days now.
“That’s not gonna happen,” he says, getting up. “Well if you’re not coming, I’m gonna wear my good cologne.”
For a rare change, that night Dean doesn’t dream at all. It’s not concrete evidence, but it’s a damn good start.
“And I’m trying to make sure that you don’t have to,” Cas says, sounding extraordinarily frustrated.
In the morning, the news. Breakfast. Fix Baby’s tail lights. Tell Lisa about Death in Chicago. A cemetery got broken into and the cops found joints and an unopened condom wrapper there. Hash browns and eggs. Tweak the horn back to full volume. Lisa’s Sunday yoga has her finally flattening her palms to the floor when she bends over, a feat she’s very proud of. A kidnapped woman found alive. Fruit—cereal for Ben. Touch up the paint job where Dean got thrown into the door. Explain what a hellhound is. Local animal shelter hosting a fundraiser that weekend, looking for people to adopt their overflow of huskies. Blueberry pancakes. Replace the car’s oil. Reminisce on their weekend ten years ago over a bottle of sherry (it’s okay, because he shows her another good CD while they talk). Amnesiac woman kills her husband by dragging him behind their car. Sausage, egg and cheese.
Cas sighs and gives into Dean; he knows a losing battle when he sees one. Besides, moving his mouth to Dean’s mouth is more telling than he could ever be, and so he turns his head and he lets Dean know how much he loves him.
He spends the day repainting the side of the house, where all the paint’s chipped off from Ben’s soccer practice when he mostly just kicks the ball into the siding again and again and again. They moved fairly recently, within the last couple of years, and he’s already taken a good chunk off the first paint job.
“What I told you in the basement. That was true,” the monster starts. “My nest tried to kill me years ago for running off with a woman. They killed her. Or at least, I thought that they did. Turns out they just turned her as one last
Dean’s hands are quick undoing the brace by now, not least because he helped build it with Charlie. Crowley helped, which is why Cas still expects it to suddenly break down when he needs it most—but miraculous it’s holding, so far.
When it’s clear, Cas spins around and drops back to his knees. His hands are on the side of the Dean’s neck, his eyes are restless on his face.
“I promise you, the second I got back to Heaven that night, I told them to stop what they were doing,” Cas intones. “You have to believe me.”
He wanders into town again to see if he can get a cheap peppermint latte to wash this taste out of his mouth; Forrest gave him a dollar after he saw what those guys did to Cas‘s face. He finds one that’s scalding hot and horribly bitter but does the trick, and he drinks it outside while he reads a newspaper someone left open on their seat. The metal of the table is cold on his bare wrists, but he feels better now that he’s surrounded by people on the crowded street.
“I was thinking we could go into town tomorrow and check some of those things off your to-do list,” Dean says. “My friend Charlie hooked us up. We have a couple fake credit cards with no limit. I’m sure we can do some serious damage.”
It should be a traditionally easy kill, silver blade to the heart, no big deal. Cas doesn’t sleep much the first night Dean’s gone—tosses and turns the second, third and fourth night too. Not being able to instantly heal himself is awful. Knowing Dean’s alone on a case is awful, too.
“What? No,” Cas says. “If anything they probably intensified his connection to the underworld, making it strong enough to save his life. With the Gates closed, the demon part of him...wants to go back to Hell, for lack of a better way to put it. In Enochian, there’s a more accurate—”
Cas stays over that night, and the one after that; and then Dean has to go back to work. Cas lingers in the doorway while Dean’s getting dressed for the day.
Dean doesn’t try to talk to him on the ride home, and Cas shuts himself up in his room when they get back to the bunker. He hears Dean walk by his door a few times, but it takes him nearly three hours to actually knock. Cas isn’t feeling much better, but he’s calmed enough to be sorry that he made a scene. His hands aren’t shaking anymore either.
He puts it on mute, on speaker, looks at Dean and just waits. Contrary to the beliefs he held up until a few weeks ago, Dean is decidedly
Her voice is shaky but deliberately cool. Cas would admire her if he wasn’t so busy trying to hold his ribs in all the right places.
“I’m not worried about me!” Ben stands up with a loud scrape of his chair against the hardwood floor. “What if something happens to him when he’s out there all alone?”
Dean’s face is very close to his. Cas’s heart is racing in his chest, leapfrogging wildly past his reason. He’s thinking things...letting his imagination run away with him. Another thing he discovered the past couple of years.
“I’ll get it,” he says before she can, and shoves his chair back with a loud and horrible scrape. Literally anything that will get him out of this dinner, away from the kitchen and this indescribably terrible conversation.
“No, we’re heading out soon,” Dean says. “It’s about a two and a half hour drive—Lisa, who do you think you’re talking to? Yeah, Cas is glued to the weather report every morning. I know…”
“I told you this wasn’t the—Cas, don’t come up here,” Dean says, turning abruptly when he’s already halfway there. “No—”
“And you thought I wouldn’t give up Heaven for this,” he sighs, shaking his head. He strokes Dean’s hair with intent, making him look up. Speaking directly to Dean’s lower lip, Cas adds, “I’m sorry. Your blinding self-hatred just seems minisculely ridiculous in this moment.”
like he sees him, but how can he? The things he says just don’t match up. How can somebody rebuild you from the bare bones up and still look at you like he’s seeing some goodness? A righteousness that you
“So you see, brother,” Benny grips his beer tighter, “I looked into the case already. I look into every case that could be a vampire in these parts. I don’t want anybody else hunting on my territory.”
They get through the rest of Kurt Russell’s reel that night, the remainder of the decent picks that Cas hasn’t yet seen. They both lay with their legs splayed, and as Dean tires more, he slumps further down the bed and lays his head on Cas’s shoulder, his eyelids heavy. Cas’s cheek nudges the top of his head every now and then when he talks.
It's a long day. They decode the second half of the runes thanks to clues they get from the first translation; actually, Claire’s the one who cracks it, remembering a betting term she heard when she lived with the criminals where Dean, Cas and Sam found her. Remembering it makes his skin heat unpleasantly—smarting like a delirium fever. He knows Dean handles the memory even worse, so Cas distracts him by sending him out for beer.
And then Cas keeps looking at him, as though having a small revelation; and the waitress comes over to ask if they want a refill on their drinks, and they both accept. Dean remembers he has food on his plate. On the walk to the car, Dean puts his arm around Cas’s shoulders. Cas walks closer as a result.
“I’m sure that was a terrible sacrifice for you,” Cas says wryly, and Dean laughs way harder than everybody else, like he always does when Cas successfully makes a good joke. Cas perks up, pleased.
He doesn’t like being around so many people, but appreciates the one-on-one with this woman, Alicia, who’s funny and talks about her twin brother with clear love shining through. When she’s enjoyed her tour of the place and lost to Dean at a round of darts, Charlie comes back over and hones in on Alicia immediately. Dean slots in beside Cas and kisses him softly behind the ear when he shuffles around to get more juice.
When Claire smiles, surprised, her face lights up beautifully. She’s growing up into an amazing young woman, and he’s—proud, Cas realizes. He’s proud of her, and she may not
“And you’re choosing to spend it in Indiana?” Dean whistles. “Remind me to take you on a vacation someday.”
It takes some cajoling, but he convinces Cas to get out of his funk and try to share in Dean’s revelry. Even Cas telling him how premature and pathetic this is for a housewarming can’t dull Dean’s good mood, which is getting better all the time; he catches Cas bopping his head minutely to a couple of songs, and that’s good, that means he’s getting cultured. He even recognizes some of the words.
Lisa presses her lips together, looking him over; then she shrugs off the door and envelopes him in a warm, tight hug. Dean’s startled at first, but then he wraps his arm around her back and squeezes her to his body. It goes on for longer than is perhaps customary at the end of a dinner party. Lisa smiles when she steps back and cups his cheek in one hand.
“You did manage to find a place of your own,” says Cas, glancing around, gaze lingering on the hotplate.
“How is this serious?” he asks. “This is literally the most mundane reason that I have ever needed medical care, that’s a fucking
“We want the location of the Alphas, yes, but I didn’t realize that that was what Hannah met by reconnaissance.” Cas sounds exasperated. “Dean, look at me!”
“Look at you,” said Neal, stepping back to give him a proper once-over. “I hear you’re quite the character.”
“Uh...Thanks, Cas.” He spreads his hands. “So what’s up? Do you need help with Heaven or something?”
“You don’t want to teach other born-again angels how to think for themselves?” Dean asks, half-teasing, half-grim.
Dean’s knife is relentless, stabbing him in the chest. Sam’s crying but it turns into a horrible, vicious laughter. Blood bubbles from the corners of his mouth.
Looking between them both, Dean says, “Alright, alright, that’s enough. Cut to the chase, Crowley. What do you want?” and Crowley smirks.
“By being here for you!” he says, his voice cracking down the middle. Against his instincts, Cas’s heart jumps at the sound. “By giving you space to do your thing.”
Cas touches his face and kisses him hello, and then takes the vodka he was holding and finishes the drink Dean just poured, passing it to its buyer. The guy looks at him, and Cas gives him a look back, like,
It’s chilly, even this late in the season. Dean fiddles with the heater and radio station until he finds one strong enough to follow them out of the woods. It’s a quiet drive back to the main road, although ‘main road’ is a bit of an overstatement in the middle of the night when it’s pitch black, with no street lamps or other cars in sight.
Cas is standing by the opposite wall in his puffy vest and jeans that actually fit, hands shoved deep in his pockets.
“Not much of one, being away from you,” he says honestly. Dean goes still and Cas clears his throat. “I just mean, no matter what happens, I would never want you gone.”
“Would you stop arguing about fucking cartoons with me, man? I’m trying to tell you something,” Dean says over a third beer and an extremely tempting pile of mozzarella sticks. Cas did not know fried food could be so incredible. “I—I found out something. Well, Krissy and her friends did. They were on a case last week and she ran into a couple of angels.”
...that’s…” he says, in that blustering way that makes Cas want to kiss him, but he has to let Dean let it out first. Charlie’s losing her shit. “I’m an adult. Shut the fuck up.”
Cas rolls his eyes and grabs it from the end table on Dean’s side of the bed. He’s in a mood because Dean said they couldn’t stop at the World’s Largest Ball of Twine on their way, mostly because he’s already seen it a hundred thousand times, and no amount of alternative tourist traps or giving Cas some input on the playlist will appease him now.
“I’ve never popped somebody’s weed cherry before,” Charlie says. “I especially didn’t think I would get a chance to devirginize an
“We’re gonna do this,” Dean promises, leaning into him, hands on Cas’s thighs but it doesn’t feel like his usual advances. “I’m gonna work the new Roadhouse. I do the floor, you handle the phones. And cases…”
The first thing that touches him is Dean’s fingers, curling into the t-shirt lying against his chest. Dean’s breath is shaky on his face—against his mouth. Cas is pretty sure his breathing’s coming faster in response. Dean’s eyes drift shut, then open again, enchanting colors blinking in and out of view as he steels himself visibly, strength working its way up his throat and all over his face.
“What? No, I’m just making good use of the mini fridge,” Dean says. “So what did you get up to today?”
Dean gets lost in the kissing for a little while. He deserves this, maybe, a little bit of a break from overthinking, and Cas’s hands on his waist and the edge of his jaw, and the quiet rasp of Cas’s stubble on his cheeks. Dean pulls him in closer until Cas lays down, bare chest touching bare chest.
The first thing Dean understands, when he jerks awake in his dark bedroom, is that his hands are shaking something fierce. The second thing is that there’s a warm touch on his chest that’s getting more and more familiar every single day.
“You tell me that you want to spend more time together, and how upset you get when I go away,” Cas says.
“I didn’t say you did,” Cas counters. They stare at each other again, waiting for the other to break first.
He takes a minute to get his bearings back before he heads for the car. As he’s approaching the Impala, out of the corner of the parking lot underneath a flickering street lamp, a stocky figure in a peacoat looms out of the dark.
Seeing his opening, Dean slides across the floor and cuts one of his pocket knives through the vampire’s leg restraints. Dean pauses, catching his eye; the vampire nods, and Dean slices away at his hand bindings too.
The café isn’t far from the bunker. They roll up twenty minutes later and, aside from a minor incident with Cas and the crosswalk and almost running into oncoming traffic, they make it to the shop unscathed. Dean gets a plain black coffee, Cas tries some cherry thing that Dean thinks tastes like cough syrup. Cas has never had that, but he definitely agrees that the coffee is bad.
“Sure,” he says, because if it’s good enough for Dean then it’s good enough for him. He reaches his arms out. “Come here.”
“Yeah,” she says automatically. Then her brows pull together. “I—I mean...No offense, but are you sure you want to?”
make a good stoner. Put a joint in your mouth and this is basically every date I ever had with Rebecca Hayes.”
There are three of them, that’s all he knows. They’re mean. One of them has a knife. They don’t care that Cas has approximately $3 to his name at the moment. It doesn’t matter to them that in twelve hours, he’ll be home free—or home bound. He does manage to avoid getting stabbed.
Dean makes sure Miracle has enough food for a couple of weeks, even though Sam’s more than capable of looking after her himself. He packs enough premade food that he doesn’t have to live off corner store sandwiches (Dean long survived on the road but, like his exposure to Cas, now spoiled he’ll get short if he goes without homemade dinners) and carefully chooses which extra books to bring for leisure, which he hides in the bottom of his suitcase so Cas can pretend not to see them. He’s learning many lessons, taking solo hunts with Dean.
“I told you, I don’t torture them!” Cas says. He grabs Dean’s shoulder and spins him around. “When I found out what they were doing to find the Alphas, I was furious with them.”
Dean just stands there when he grabs the cheese plate and pushes past. Until then, it didn’t feel like he was boxing Cas against the counter but suddenly he’s upset with himself for crowding him by accident. Frowning, he grabs a fresh beer from the fridge and goes to make himself useful by taking over most of the cooking.
“No hot jerky this time,” she notes, accidentally ringing him up for the habanero twice. “No Combos either.”
They look at each other for a minute. Then Dean clears his throat, and Lisa pulls her hand away to get back to eating.
Cas cleans himself up while Dean orders some dessert and digs the playing cards out of one of his spare bags. He used to get bored on the road a lot while Sam would be off reading one of his geeky books or, like, texting the rare girl he met on the road or something equally worth mocking him over, but truth was Dean couldn't
Cas rolls his eyes, bereft of anything to toss at him and too far to pinch his side or sock him on the shoulder. He turns away and cleans the pitcher under his hands with a wet rag.
“No. You’re the best hunter I know, Dean.” Cas leans in, raising his eyebrows. Dean stops. He intones, “And I suggested it, so technically you’re just
Dean looks around, his eyes adjusting to the sudden emptiness. It was easier to see in the dark. There’s the bottle of melatonin at his bedside that wasn’t there before—he’d left it rattling around in the first aid kit beside all the ibuprofen and vicodin, but there it is, steady beside his bottle of holy water.
between me and Dick Roman. Sounds dirty,” Charlie says. She shrugs, adding, “And...I don’t know. I guess I’m just a sucker for a grand adventure.”
In awhile, Cas will get up and help Dean organize bottles until his leg or ribs tire him out, and Dean will make him laugh with a stray joke or pour him another drink to coax life back into his bones. Cas will stay and watch Dean build until he retires for dinner or wants to nap; or perhaps he’ll grow bored abruptly, as the mood sometimes settles over him precipitously, and find that he barely has the energy to make it back to his room to lay down. Dean will help him walk if his crutches are too much work. Dean will sit with him in the dark if he asks, or lean against the headboard with him watching a movie until dawn.
“Trouble with the missus?” one of the others from the cul de sac asks, slithering up beside him. He’s looking toward the way Cas left, where he’s now chatting with one of the mothers with a screaming baby clinging to her hip. Cas reaches out with one finger and touches his forehead, and the baby quietens.
“No weed!” Dean snaps, although by Cas’s look of alarm this is definitely going to be a battle that they revisit later. “Uh, I’m glad we’re not fighting either, by the way. Just for the record.”
“We’re preparing to mount our final attack,” Cas says all at once, spinning back to face him.  “Alpha blood is a critical component to our plan. They were just trying to get the location of the first vampire, and our intel led us there.”
“No.” Cas glances at the floor. “The Alpha blood and the weapon we got—It’s all connected. Our side is going to do something. We’re building a spell...If we can pull this off, the effects to the opposing side would be catastrophic.”
sit by him at the big dinner table with their (Dean’s—Bobby’s—quickly becoming universal) friends. Mostly Cas gets on surprisingly well with the angsty teenage girl, possibly because they’re both the most morbid and borderline unhinged people that Dean has ever met.
Cas shrugs. Dean has a beer resting on the counter, which Cas snatched about twenty minutes ago so he’d have something to pick and sip at. Dean banned phones in the bar because he doesn’t know if the bunker’s protection extends to here or if the bad guys would be able to track their signals, so Cas has nothing to do while he watches Dean fix the place up. He helps sometimes, when there’s need for an extra set of hands, but mostly he observes and tries to learn a few things about carpentry. It seems fitting that he knows the basics, right?
“This is a shed, Cas,” he tells him. “I’m not…living here permanently, just while I build the main house.”
“Dean,” he rumbles. His voice seems lower, maybe just because Dean’s ear is right against his throat when he kisses underneath Cas’s jaw like this.
“It’s not all bad down here,” Cas says, shooting him glances as he bends to scrape the edges of the little black bowl of marinara sauce.
Usually, he goes in on Wednesday through Friday plus Monday. On the weekends, he puts together another house: His own.
“Where’s Sam?” Cas asks when he’s got food in his stomach and, coincidentally, is feeling better and more in control than he has since he landed here. His headache’s even gone away. He wonders if modern medicine knows about the healing properties of cheeseburgers. “He didn’t come with you. Is he OK? Is he really that hurt?”
Cas says nothing for long enough that Dean glances up, only to find him just standing there looking at him.
A wash of relief rolls over him when he hears Cas’s voice like balm for the hellhound gouges, but he pushes it down, down. Dean swallows and tries to wade through his muddy, muddy thoughts.
Cas actually pauses and looks him over. Fuck, Cas doesn’t need Superman x-ray vision: That piercing, unwavering gaze feels like it goes right through Dean without even trying. He studies Dean like he’s stripping him back to the flayed soul he found in a Kansas hole in the ground, except—Except Cas never looks at him like he’s a red, bloody thing. That’s the part that Dean doesn’t understand.
Something about her tone of voice gives him doubt. Dean’s grip tightens on the gun, and he shifts his feet to strengthen his stance.
It’s a long drive to Indianapolis; just forty minutes, which a few months ago would’ve been a trip to the grocery store, but it feels like forever driving away from Lisa’s street and putting Cicero in the rearview mirror. Dean’s little plot of land has patchy green grass and a long driveway, but otherwise there’s nothing there but an old ramshackle shed in the back corner of the property, a few feet of green on either side before the fence, and mosquitos.
’s human! And that’s your big hang-up? That’s what’s got you acting like a damn hermit? It’s pathetic.”
show, but the angels keep showing up trying to use me as their own personal FM signal! They think I’ll lead them to Metatron.”
“Creation is the reason that existence started. It’s why we’re all here,” he explains. “So maybe it’s the reason I exist, too.”
“It’s not too late to power up the weapon, right?” Dean asks, trying to gather up all of his work stuff which has somehow scattered all around the motel room since yesterday afternoon.
“Three months, yeah, since I sent you off on that demon case in Fort Wayne,” Bobby says. “It’s...it’s good to hear your voice, son.”
“I’m not stupid, Dean,” he reminds him in a low voice. “I know what holding hands mean and I can follow a simple conversation.” Dean clears his throat, shifting, but the back of his hand is still in the same place when Cas’s fingers reach down and brush it. In that same slow, melodic drift Cas adds, “And these feelings...they’re not
Because they can’t agree on whether pineapple belongs on pizza, they get two; and Dean has to pick it up from the shop because he won’t let a delivery guy within ten miles of this place. Cas takes Dean by the hand back to his own bedroom, and they pass by Sam’s door on the way and Dean pops his head into where his brother’s recuperating, tossing him a few slices of pie. When Cas’s room shuts behind them, he sets out the food on the bed while Dean flicks through his paltry record collection—the player scavenged and cleaned and repaired from the side of the road, one of Cas’s many new hands-on projects. He managed to find a few acceptable records last time he went shopping with Charlie that he knew would fly with Dean, thank you thrift stores wedged between offbeat music shops and secondhand, dark-dimmed bookstores. Dean settles on something from the eighties and sits at home on his side of the bed, nearest to the door.
Inside the cabin, all of the lights are on. The curtains are drawn but Dean can see the colors flickering against the fabric from what’s most likely a TV on inside. The front door seems unguarded, but that’s way too obvious and Dean already knows about three other ways inside. He decides not to go with the roof or backdoor and opts for the secret passageway instead; more grimy but most likely less warded.
Cas, presumably to be a gigantic asshole, details the specifics of the alleged Mothman case while critiquing their route up to Bobby’s with the forecasted traffic. Dean tries approximately five times to get him to fold and go check the Mothman thing out, but Cas has that patented Catholic guilt down pat and then some when he considers blowing off their plans to go chase what Cas delicately calls Dean’s ‘ultimate hunting wet dream.’ Ironic, considering the way he kisses Dean against the car before they get in and head north for South Dakota. Dean’s just glad to put the motel in his rearview mirror before cleaning service checks the room and sees that they’ve shattered the bathroom looking glass to splinters. It’s not their fault, just a byproduct of getting down and dirty with someone who packs that much of a punch, but still would be difficult to explain in conjunction with the noises they were making all last night.
Cas’s hand, covering Dean’s and pushed into the pillows, clenches twice. His lips brush Dean’s chin when he raises his head.
“That’s nearly three months,” he says in a shaking voice, “of absolute, unbelievable happiness. It was so good that...I almost didn’t think about anything else.”
“Say goodbye,” Cas repeats, the words landing somewhere just right of Cas’s heart and hovering, warm. Generally he doubts that Dean even recognizes how kind he is, but that doesn’t make it any less charming. Still, a pit opens up in his stomach beneath the admiration. “But you just got back.”
“We’re talking about you, right? Weren’t you just marveling at the grass and a couple of pieces of wood?” Dean shakes his head. “Dude, I could take you a few states over and you’d be shitting yourself at the mountain ranges there. You know what, never mind. If you’re coming to the picnic, then you need to bring something too.”
“I’m sorry that I hurt your feelings,” Cas sneers. “Time works differently for us. When you’ve been around as long as I have, a month seems—”
Around one in the morning, a truck pulls in to fill up his tank. Cas doesn’t realize the driver is watching him until he comes over and puts his hand on Cas’s shoulder and he startles, tensing up, ready for the worst.
But it’s also the first time that Cas doesn’t seem like he’s fading away. He always had one foot out the door, before. He’ll be here long after Dean’s gone, that’s true; but it presses on him very heavily, all of a sudden, the weight of someone choosing him over eternal Heaven. The knowledge of it settles over his bones like a thick homemade blanket, or a sudden wildfire throughout his body. Dean pulls Cas’s mouth down to his, because Cas is warm and heavy and very, very
He finds Dean lurking in the library when he’s done, flipping through old books. Whatever it is can’t be important because when Cas touches the inside of his wrist and quietly says his name, Dean puts his tome back and turns around.
I was beginning to make all these new choices? Why I would give up Heaven over and over again so I could be down here with you?”
“You know I do,” he says finally. He looks at Cas, and something he sees there seems to hook him, make it linger. Dean’s mouth opens slowly, like he’s trying to find the words, although when they come Cas imagines they were supposed to sound more casual like the tone implies. “You remember Purgatory, don’t you, Cas? That seem like some shit I’d do if I didn’t care about you?”
He and Hannah size each other up; then she nods, once. With a glance at the other angels and a jerk of her head, the rest of Cas’s army files out of the cabin. Maybe he decided not to be their fearless leader, but it’s clear his opinion still carries some weight. Hopefully that will be enough for now.
“Do you?” Dean steps in. He supposes it’s meant to be intimidating, but that’s not what makes Cas’s breath catch. Damn him. Even when they’re screaming at each other… “You never ask how he’s doing, or God forbid actually go see him in the hospital! What the hell is your problem?”
Cas shrugs. For some reason, the long pause he takes next makes Dean suspicious, though his face remains relatively impassive. Cas is a boarded up house, but Dean’s been tossing in flashlights for awhile, so he can sometimes see through the cracks.
“And you’re saying you did that?” Dean asks. “So I’m just, what? Supposed to believe you? It could have just as easily been the angels who did that.”
Cas’s hand is making soothing trails through his hair; thankfully this doesn’t make them stop. “Yes?”
But Cas’s bubbling upset is tempered as soon as the high starts rising within him, not even a minute later. Charlie grins when he raises his head and breaks out in a smile, and she gives a little cheer.
It’s a long, cold night under the trenchcoat. He wishes he could clean out the blood: From the jacket, from his hair. It’s matted behind his jaw and making his ears cold.
?” Dean demands, rounding the corner with the scruffy white mutt, now bathed and vaccinated, close behind him by the collar. Apparently unbothered at being manhandled, the dog sits down and lolls out her tongue.
“How could you say that?” Dean demands. If he wasn’t physically incapable of it after Cas remolded Dean’s body with his bare angelic hands, he’d be so scandalized right now, but some things make you incapable of being shocked at somebody’s audacity. “This is a 1953—”
They check out around eleven and set off immediately, so they actually get in a decent amount of miles today; Cas convinces him to pull over in the early evening to find a dinner theater for them to see, because now that he thinks about it that’s on Cas’s bucket list too. Maybe he’ll write one down for real and convince Dean to help him check them off, one by one. He’s sure he’ll be interested in teaching Cas to be human.
The club is brightly lit with cool tones and very, very loud. Cas never realized how extraordinarily head-splitting bars were before, in part because Dean prefers quiet, cheaper places and in part because as an angel he didn’t notice it so much, busy paying attention to several other dimensions and the Winchesters every time.
“Nah,” says Dean, munching on more cold french toast. Cas watches in mild horror as Dean soaks his bread in syrup until it’s dripping with it. “He’s all bark, no bite anymore.”
But Dean doesn’t know how to say the words lodged in his throat. He just knows that he wants Cas to stay here, laying in his arms, and he wants him to keep looking at Dean like
Cas’s mouth gets small when he’s mad. Or upset, or cagey, and sometimes when he’s guilty and lashing out, or if he’s just thinking really hard about something. Cas always has a justification.
All’s quiet on the homefront for a long time. He’s settling in alright at Lisa’s, once they get into a steady rhythm. They watch the news over breakfast, although some days Lisa trades it in for her favorite soap opera instead. She watches
“I found something in the lore about people who have been ‘infected’ with demonic energy, and I don’t think they’re talking about possession,” Cas starts.
Lisa tells him about what’s new with her while they eat, and that keeps them busy for a good half of the meal. She asks him about the house, wants to see it in all its glory now that it’s finished up and painted, and he promises to have her over for drinks with the neighbors sometime after they get back. Dean helps her clean up the dishes afterwards, bumping elbows and sharing little smiles while Ben takes Cas back to the living room for a nightcap.
It’s the same one as usual this time. He and Sam are sharing a beer in Bobby’s kitchen. Dean would’ve thought he’d ache more for this place, but he doesn’t really in his waking hours—maybe something about visiting it so often at night. He’s waiting for the moment he can have a regular dream-visit here and spend all night wandering through the rows of cars. He’d like to work on Baby uninterrupted just once, like when he rebuilt her from the ground up after they lost Dad. He’d like to feel the dust from Bobby’s yard on his face and drink the beers he’d stock in the fridge, a brand you can only get in South Dakota.
Cas shuts the door and angles his body between the square window inset in the wood and Sam’s face as Dean puts his hand over his mouth and starts muttering Latin.
Dean breaks out first in a jog toward the sound of her voice, and then a run. He still can’t see, and he’s tripping over his feet, but the woman’s plea is loud and unbroken and it’s impossible to deviate off-course no matter how many times he stumbles. The closer he runs full-tilt in her direction, the high-pitched shout gets clearer and clearer, until it coalesces into a distinct yell. Subconsciously Dean recognizes that the words are staggered, that she’s
“Nobody cares about your psychic witch drama,” Dean promises. “If that’s all, then why did you try to kill Cas?”
“He’s right, Dean,” Cas says. To Crowley, he adds, “Although I was created at the beginning of Time itself. You’re still basically a teenager to me.”
It feels much later than it is when they arrive. It’s barely turning nine. Dean feels caked in dirt for no real reason and claims the first, very hot shower, but then he just leans on the tiles gripping his hair for awhile while steam fills the room. When he gets out, the room is choked with fog, and out there Cas has set out two glasses and the rest of last night’s whiskey.
“Yes. I’ve never played,” Cas informs him. Now Dean does pull on a shirt, and Cas turns around fully to face him. “Will you teach me?”
“I love you,” Cas says, and Dean’s eyes change. He shifts, slightly, but maybe Cas only notices because he’s half on top of him when he does it.
“You look very nice today,” Cas replies, allowing himself his first breath. He wasn’t sure how it would be after Dean said those words, if his heart would ever stop pounding, but now that he’s seeing Dean’s face again it’s become a cool, constant kind of elation. “Are you ready to go?”
Dean looks up at him, barely doing anything to temper his smile. He squeezes his unhurt ankle and pulls himself up, falling heavily into the seat right beside him. Pulling his drink over, Dean tries, and fails, to seem casual.
them. Cas can also do some pretty freaky things with his grace. It doesn’t hurt that he can read Dean’s mind while they’re going at it either.
!” and throws Dean across the room with one flick of his wrist. Dean hits the dungeon wall and crumples. In the same second, the door flies open with a deafening crash.
“Nothing. We just finished clearing the table,” Lisa says, smiling brightly. She tries to act natural when she eases into the room, not like they ran in to make sure that her weird friend’s awkward immortal boyfriend isn’t sharing any of his whiskey with her average teenage son. “What are you boys playing?”
From this angle, low to the ground, Cas can see behind the sparse and under-watered bush against the corner of the gas station. A tuft of white flops to the dirt, shakes, and steadies.
“I know. I...I don’t know what happened. I asked him to stop…” Dean shakes his head. “But he finished the ritual. Crowley’s cured. We both thought that he’d drop dead, but he didn’t.”
They both jump at the man’s voice from the phone, laying forgotten beside them. Dean scrambles off him and Cas sits up so fast his vision dots unpleasantly.
“Alright, come on, Cas. We’ll grab ourselves some coffee in town today.” Dean pauses. “I’m taking one of these egg sandwiches to go.”
Under the dim reddish lights of the bar, Dean signals for another round of drinks. One of the pretty waitresses circling the floor grabs their empties for her tray. Cas nudges closer to him.
Dean’s laughter is infectious. He elbows Cas in the ribs, and before he can help it he’s grinning too. The moment slips out from underneath them without a whisper or terribly awkward goodbye.
“The truth,” Cas says with a frown, at the same time that Dean insists, “He’s just messing with her. Cas has a very...weird sense of humor,” and then Cas turns that frown on him.
Dean sways further into his arms, and Cas pauses for a fraction of a second. Then he squeezes Dean tighter, and presses another deliberate kiss just behind his collarbone. Cas’s first two fingers find his chin, and he turns Dean’s face toward him, leaning in, mouth just hovering near; and it’s Dean who reaches to grab the side of his neck and pull him in the rest of the way.
“I’m not letting you launch this massive kamikaze shot on your own,” Dean says. “No way, fuck that noise. I’m helping you finish this.”
“Are you really going to just sit there and watch me sleep?” Dean demands, glaring into the dark where he knows Cas is sitting. “Hey, what are you doing?”
“You know, I’m not trying to baby you,” Dean says, fingers poking around the edges of it. “Head wounds are serious business, man, I just wanna make sure that you’re alright.”
The angel he’s following, Samandriel, guides Dean to the camp’s perimeter and points out the places he has to draw extra sigils in the dirt. He teaches Dean three basic symbols and sends him off to the left; Samandriel heads right, to meet him in the middle on the other side of camp.
“Let’s call a truce,” she says, and it isn’t a question. Cas squints, wary. “We’ll all go our separate ways. This doesn’t have to get worse—it doesn’t have to leave this room. Too many of our kind have died already, and this will only cause unrest among our side.”
The map splays out across the motel’s dull wood table where Dean usually takes his morning coffee and does a healthy scan of a few local news sites just to be safe. He’s not sure what kind of traps the siren will have set, but they’re probably all juiced up with witch power—Dean scoffed a little when Cas tried to impress on him, for the tenth time at least, that maybe Dean didn’t take witches very seriously but Cas has met a few very, very powerful ones in the past millennia including Crowley’s long lost bitch of a mother, and Dean takes Crowley seriously, so he finally took
“Would you shut up?” Dean asks, laughing, and touching his face. “I’m trying to give you a romantic speech here.”
Dean traded up to the main office at work, so now he’s only ten minutes from his clock-in spot every day. He has the same hours, but the pay bumped up a half dollar. All Dean’s got, besides the bags of hunter shit in his car, is a twin size mattress in the shed and all the tools he uses for work.
“Listen.” He tosses the guns in the back and slams the trunk shut. When he turns around, Lisa’s head is perfectly tilted for him to cup his hand around the side of her neck. “I appreciate everything you’ve done for me. And it goes both ways, you know. If you need me, you call me. Any time.”
Jody keeps exchanging these looks with Cas that make Dean want to leave the house altogether, except Cas hasn’t stopped touching him since they arrived and it makes it a little easier to breathe, especially today. He doesn’t take this for granted; yesterday’s wounds are still fresh and Dean’s itching to go for a drive. Only Cas’s hand on his back could make him feel more calm and at home than taking off with his other baby.
“You know…” Dean says when they’ve eaten their fills and Cas is mostly watching Dean pick at his toppings. “Before, when we were talking about how you’re handling things and I...I got mad and I said some things—”
“I know how you see yourself, Dean,” he says quietly. “You think you’re….destructive, and you’re angry and you’re broken. You think hate and anger, that’s what drives you, that’s who you are. But it’s not.” He reaches out and touches Dean’s shoulder, and Dean’s too shocked to pull away fast enough. “You’re selfless, Dean. You’re the most caring...You’re the most selfless and loving human being I have ever known. And I’ve watched the Earth grow and change since the first man grew legs to walk it.”
“So,” she asks, setting her drink down. She looks up at him from under long lashes, the lights in here dimmed but not as dark as it is outside. “What are a couple of hunters doing in my monster bar?”
“No,” Cas agrees. Were he somebody else, perhaps this would be the part where he smiles. But it’s Cas, so instead he says, “Much of the time, I’d rather be here.”
“Yeah, alright,” Dean mutters. His voice is warm as butter in Cas’s ear and much more fond. “So that’s all you did with yourself today?”
He has absolutely no experience with painting, and only two big buckets that are supposed to be for the walls. He just knows he’s got a big ball of something in his chest, something sickening he thinks is great dark
“Well, not completely.” Dean shrugs one shoulder. “But out of the big stuff. I just think Heavenly wars, angels—It’s all a bit...big for me nowadays.”
“I think...they would probably try to teach me a lesson again, like they have before,” says Cas in that voice that sounds the way rolling his eyes looks. “So I guess it’s a very good thing that I’m dismantling the power structure in Heaven instead.”
“Of course he is,” he says, throwing his arm around Cas’s shoulder. “He can’t resist a good homecooked meal.”
Cathy comes running into the room with two others on her heels, barking at the three of them to get out. Dean paces the hallway with his hands in his hair, and Cas and Crowley look at each other.
“Have you ever played Settlers of Catan?” she asks. Cas shakes his head. “Well, we’ll have to adapt the rules a little for two people but it should work out fine.”
The door bangs open, but Sam’s jeans are in the way so he can’t see who’s just come in. Sam jumps out of the way and then just—turns and books it down the hall. That’s weird, too. Dean looks up just as two large hands come down and wrap around the air near where Dean could feel the great beasts breathing as they ripped into him.
He shrugs, looking at his feet. Cas doesn’t want his pity; he doesn’t want his apologies, either. Cas did this. He was stupid, he trusted the wrong people, and worst of all he didn’t trust
“And what do you think Heaven would say if they could see you slumming it down here with me, picking out China patterns?”
It takes two hours, a lot of watermelon juice spiked with vodka and a promise to do all the grilling today, but Dean organizes a game. He slicks back his hair, but his swim trunks are still dripping onto the grass when he takes Cas’s ugly puffy vest and explains the rules of touch football. It’s not even cold out, Jesus Christ. Why did he give this guy his fake credit card and a ride to Goodwill? Some kid’s mom turns the sprinkler on, and Neal’s Pomeranian does jumps through the water, much to the children’s joy.
. And I’m just expected to cook, and clean, and buy everything on my shopping list and pay off a whole bunch of taxes. I don’t know what I’m
“You’re kissing me,” Cas concludes brilliantly. He’s not rejecting it; by contrast, he holds Dean closer. “You argued with me the whole drive here. You hate my TV show. And I’m keeping you awake.”
On his way back to the registers, glancing down aisles, a sign catches his eye and makes him pause. Backing up a step, Cas pauses—then wheels the cart around and halfway down the row. Finally curiosity gets the best of him, and he drops two buckets of paint and a huge canvas into his cart.
Dean nearly falls asleep on the couch. One minute he’s engaged in a lengthy backstory about Harrison Ford, although he’s yawning through it, and the next he blinks and Leia’s in a completely different outfit. Dean sits up straighter, rubbing his eyes.
He’s leaned across the table now, eyes huge, begging Dean to tell him the secrets of the universe. Dean’s the savviest, most street smart person that he’s ever met—that’s why it’s worse, maybe, when a voice in the back of his head whispers that maybe there
After the tour, Cas cajoles Dean into buying two cases of the beer the guide deduced was perfect for their palate. Dean wants to see the beer garden after all and cracks open the top box right there. As the sun starts to set, fireflies come out, and Cas watches them weave in and out of the nearby flowers from the picnic table he’s perched on top of, half watching the night sky to pick out constellations in his head and some of his attention on Dean.
“Me too, I guess,” Dean says. “Like you said, one day I just looked up and realized what had always been there. And I couldn’t hold it in anymore.”
Dean pulls up to his regular spot. The room’s warm and stagnant until the night air rushes in, tipping the scales in the other direction. Dean doesn’t relish getting in the shower now but after dinner, he flicks on the heater and hopes for the best.
This appears to be the wrong thing to say. Something flashes in Sophie’s eyes, and her demure playfulness is gone: Tripping back a step, her expression abruptly shutters over into a defensive snarl. Cas barely has time to pull his knife before she mutters a spell that pins him to the door, flat. Struggling against her magic, Cas manages to flip his knife. Sophie’s close enough he can plunge it up into her arm without wresting off her magic, and she cries out, wrenching away from him. The knife falls to the floor out of reach. Sophie drops back, baring her teeth, clutching her wrist.
Jody seems happy, chatting about her Alex’s goth phase and how great it is that the kid’s skipping class to smoke weed because at least she’s not still part of some weird psycho vampire cult. Dean really doesn’t know where he finds these people.
Together, they push the metal sheets aside. Every inch they move, more light floods in from behind. Dean shunts him to the side, rolling up his sleeves, to get one of the heavier pieces out of the way and then the last few slide down, clattering to the floor with a sound like a gunshot, and Dean jumps out of the way of the sharp edges and knocks Cas back a step. Using Dean’s shoulder for leverage, Cas steps over the blockage and into a spacious room.
The compliment sits hot and strange in his chest, like fizzling electric wire. It threatens his voice too, so Dean focuses instead on the bitterness: About Sam, about how hard being normal is, about everything. He brings it up to the surface like it’s fresh and feeds off it so he doesn’t do something stupid, like cry, or say thanks.
Dean always has to go places and talk to people. Eyes straying back to the book he was reading before something one of the characters said made him think of Dean, Cas murmurs, “Be safe, Dean.”
“When I’m down here with you...working on the house, doing research, even coming to the diner to eat. I...like it,” Cas says. He smiles. “I’m happy down here, Dean. Seeing my Father’s creations up close, it’s...changed me. I care about this world.”
“It’s OK. You don’t have to say it. Come here,” he adds, moving his box to the floor as well so he can sit up on his knees, take Dean by the back of his neck. “I love you. Come here.”
Dean wipes his forehead and goes for the cooler, which—Cas is already reaching into, pulling up a water bottle from the icy depths and tossing it across the room for him to chug, gratefully.
“My...ribs. I think my ribs are broken,” Cas says. He painstakingly shifts onto his back, flinching, and mumbles curses in a dead language. “My leg definitely is.”
“Great. Thanks.” He tosses his hands in the air, but letting go of his stomach makes him start to bleed on his jeans, so he stops. “Why are you in my lucid dreams, then?”
Dean has made it his dual mission to fix up the bar, right after he fixes Sam. He’s been learning drinks that he cooks up for Cas to try lately, which Cas is pretty sure is related to the first laser-focused objective. Dean is extraordinarily dedicated when he wants to be; it was just easy to miss at first because he used to do, seemingly, the exact opposite of everything Cas asked of him. Things run much smoother now that they’re working in the same direction.
He’s never made chicken pot pie before, but it seems applicable for a barbecue; Jenny squeals when she hugs him and Neal whispers that Dean’s in the good books when he pats him on the back in hello. Cas is a marble statue by Dean’s side, awkward and immobile.
They post up in the kitchen to make movie food—Charlie is embarking on a campaign to educate him on both cinema and the proper snacks to go along with it, an endeavor that Dean eagerly insisted on joining. But when he comes into the kitchen while Charlie’s making popcorn, Dean sees them both and just freezes.
“Thank you, Dean,” he says, brushing it down flatter. Dean doesn’t turn to look but he can feel Cas’s steady gaze intent on the side of his face. “I suppose we should get a move on with it, then. So we can get you out of the game for good.”
“Shhh,” Cas admonishes. “I’ll celebrate my victory later. You can teach me how to make pot brownies.”
In the morning, Dean makes them breakfast and sits around chatting for over an hour (well—Charlie and Dean are talking while Cas sits bowed over his sweet coffee and the police blotter on his phone) when Dean’s double backup cell rings. He looks at it, rolls his eyes and shows them a familiar unsaved number.
Dean draws as fast as he can without smudging the sigils beyond usefulness. When he reaches the second corner, he hears a scream ring out from the center of the encampment—where Cas’s boss tent is standing now.
seriously and agreed to do his homework before this little soiree. He doesn’t want to get back in business with the king of the crossroads. What a slimy little dick.
“I…” Dean swallows, glancing around the room. “That came out wrong. Of course he was hitting on you, you’re very...uh, handsome.”
“Maybe,” Cas says, though his brows are drawn and it doesn’t feel like he can do anything right by Dean these days; every move he makes is wrong. Or just not important enough to warrant significant attention in Dean’s already crowded headspace. He’s not sure which is worse.
He heaves himself up and starts going through the motions; at this point, it’s not so hard to just let his body do what his mind is all too familiar with. He doesn’t even have to think about it anymore: Get the ghoul in his trunk. Drive out to the middle of nowhere, or the closest woods. Dig a hole. Burn the motherfucker. Go home and clean—
Or maybe Cas is broken like they all say. There’s turning out to be a lot to live for down here at rock bottom.
“You bring several knives to the grocery store,” Cas points out, shaking his head, and it makes Benny laugh. No matter how much Dean wants to start bickering, he’s just happy that they’re getting along, so he leaves that one be.
“Let me guess. It’s a one-man-in-particular thing?” Charlie says. Cas barely turns his head enough to meet her gaze and he nods, sharply. “That is one seriously tough break, man.”
In the warm afternoon heat, Dean strips down to a grey undershirt and hauls the large glass pane into place. It’s heavy without an extra set of hands but sweat’s been blooming along his hairline for hours already, so Dean barely notices the discomfort at this point. The sun stripes through the living room windows, freshly installed, and paints him all over with searing hellfire and fresh energy. If he can finish the living room today, he’ll be nearly done with the structural part of building. All that’ll be left is more wiring, furniture and paint.
“Take care, Dean,” she says, and pulls him into a hug. He squeezes her around the middle tight. “Call me when you get there.”
Dean murmurs his name as he lowers them both down to the bed. Cas curls closer, nose nudging his, crowding into his space. Dean’s hands find the warm skin beneath his thin t-shirt, the solid muscles there. He just feels at first: Touching, caressing, and then his hands spread out and he uses the grip to pull Cas closer. His mouth opens beneath Dean’s with a gasp.
Bright yellow lights overhang the narrow tables slung against the walls, leaving the big open windows gaping across weathered wood floor. It’s dark now, although the sun will probably look gorgeous coming through that way at sunset; for now it’s just streetlamps along the road outside. Backlighting rows of dark liquor, a sign reading
“Only when I’m worried about you,” he says, shrugging. “Charlie showed me how to do it. I have her, Sam and a couple other people on low-level surveillance at all times.”
“I thought I was doing very well considering I’ve never had the occasion to do that with a woman before,” he says.
“Pleasant dreams?” Cas asks, looking around the room. He walks along the wall a little, examining it. Dean sees his eyes catch on the same spider.
She grabs Cas’s knife off the floor and he shouts out, sure she’s going to run him through—but she only cuts him with it. Even that stings like hell: Cas struggles, but her magic’s still holding him in place. She’s whispering over the blade now: Whatever she’s doing with their blood, mingling together on the edge of the knife, Cas can feel her magic climbing from his stomach all the way up his throat, choking him, until he thinks he might puke on it.
“Yeah, I don’t think Krissy’s the best at relaying intel,” Dean agrees, “but she definitely got the name right. How many Metatrons can there be running around?”
Dean finds them a murder mystery show. The food is underwhelming, the performance is very good. Cas buys a hat at the counter and puts it on.
“Ben’s got a really important soccer game this weekend,” Lisa says, brighter. “Maybe you guys could come down and see it?”
The property is dark when they arrive. Cas disappears from the car as soon as Dean puts it in park, and a second later the lights flip on in the house. Dean rolls his eyes and follows in after him.
There’s a sound on the other line, like the rustling of some paper. Probably research notes, or maybe a penned confession. No, Bobby’s not that outwardly sentimental.
“Does it...bother you?” The thought has honestly never occurred to him. Can angels feel shame? It’s not like Cas has anything left to fear from Heaven. “When I...You know.” The way Cas is looking at him suggests that no, he doesn’t. Dean sighs. “When I touch you like that. In public. Or...like this.”
“This already worked on me,” Crowley reminds him, looking up where he’s standing by the bedside with his arms behind his back. “I’m also a witch’s boy, so I know a few things about blood magic.”
Cas glances up from the ground to look at him. He pauses for long enough that Dean suspects he’s debating honesty.
“He didn’t survive, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean’s heart goes cold. Not for Jimmy: He knows what words Cas is dancing around, what surrounding circumstances led to Jimmy’s demise. “What Lucifer did, it was on an atomic level. I think...I
“No, probably not. I imagine it would take quite a lot of marijuana,” Cas muses. “I was just, um, looking for the extra soap.”
“Yes,” Cas frowns, pulling the page closer again so Dean can’t read any more. “I should probably get my anti-possession tattoo. And I want to ward myself against the angels, if they think to come looking for me again.”
He doesn’t think about it, how he leans in and knocks their foreheads together. He can’t decide if Cas looking at him is creepier or just more intense up close, crowding some feeling into a knot around his heart and yanking tight.
“Yeah, I know you have, Cas. And I get it,” he says. Only Dean can make his voice so hard and soft at the same time. No other angel or human in all the time he’s been alive has ever perfected the balance, not while they’re looking at him. “But we need you
In all his past experience, Dean was the one who took the reins. He has opinions on where is the best place to drink depending on your mood and angle; he knows where not to go and which drink special can have Cas on the floor, if he feels like having a laugh tonight—but Cas trusts him. Reason number two he likes when Dean picks where to go: It’s less stress. Cas isn’t exactly known around the neighborhood.
Dean cringes from the familiar noise, shrinking back against the couch. He won’t scream. Ruby/Lilith tells him, “I don’t have to listen to puppy chow.”
“Well hello to you too,” Dean says at last. “How have I been doing, you ask? Well thank you very much for checking in on me! I’m good, except my best friend keeps going super-ghost on me for months at a time—”
A horrifying vision of Cas from 2014 appears in Dean’s mind. He’s already this close to buying a drug rug every time they go to Walmart.
Dean had no idea what that meant. Was he breaking the rules and didn’t want Dean making it any harder by asking questions? Was he doing something else on Earth that he didn’t want Dean to know about, something he needed to be talked down from? Maybe he just knew that Dean didn’t like to be called ‘business.’ Maybe he didn’t trust Dean with a house.
Nobody wants to be on his and Cas’s team, but Dean cajoles a few guys into taking the hit. He’s almost good enough to make up for how much Cas sucks in the beginning, but then he seems to pick up on it angel-style and starts running circles around them. Their opponents are pissed—at Dean, for some reason, who holds his hands up and swears he just taught Cas the ropes, like, thirty minutes ago. Then the kids want to play capture the flag, and the argument dissolves as Cas starts sucking at a new game.
The noise hits them before the light, but then there’s the telltale dim gold seeping from underneath the stockroom door. Nudging Charlie, Cas points to a case of beer for her to heave into her arms while Cas gets the last couple of locks, human- and monster-proof alike.
“Look who’s finally making himself useful,” Dean congratulates. “Did you get a chance to look up that name I mentioned earlier?”
They drop the dirty dishes in the sink and trip over each other to get to their respective boys first. Dean rounds the corner with Lisa just on his heels, but then they both pull up short: Cas and Ben are sitting on opposite sides of the coffee table, playing some complicated game of cards that seems to require a lot of counting, if Cas mouthing numbers very obviously is any indication. They both look up when Dean and Lisa sway in the doorway together.
“It’s OK, Dean,” he murmurs, nose brushing, meandering up toward Dean’s neck. “You’re OK, you’re awake now. You’re here with me.”
Cas doesn’t have many of those. It’s too warm for a winter coat, and the only other jacket he owns is a sweatshirt with weird stick figures on it, which Dean informed him were created by some artist called Keith Haring. Cas still hasn’t gotten around to becoming more familiar with his work, but he shrugs that on and meets Dean in the study.
“Excuse me for leaving my harp on cloud nine, Dean,” Cas spits. “I must have left it there before somebody ripped out my grace and threw me down to Earth. I’m still getting used to having to use the bathroom five times a day.”
After awhile, when he’s listened through the album twice and is no more tired than he was before (his leg is aching; Dean never fixed the heat), Cas gets up. He smokes the rest of what’s left in his bowl and then grabs his crutches where they’re leaning next to the bed.
“Yes,” Cas says, smiling serenely again. “You care about all of this. Seeing that...it’s made me care about it too.”
“I will stab you,” Dean threatens. To Cas, he says, “You remember that first day when he called me? Since then he’s been kinda...texting me. And dropping by.”
“Why did you come back to hunting?” Cas asks after a little while, after Charlie finishes telling him about a tulpa she helped take down after a couple hunters radioed her for backup, and Charlie looks up at him. “From my understanding, your role was done after what happened between you and Dick Roman.”
(“I didn’t even know you were bi,” Dean says as they’re pushing around some of Bobby’s furniture to make room to accommodate more guests for pre-dinner beers.
They chat for another few minutes before the family makes their excuses and everybody promises to hang out for real once they’re all back in Indiana. When they’re walking again down the picturesque residential side street, Cas turns and looks at him up close.
When he’s done with his garden, Cas turns to the rest of what he brought home today. After a little contemplation he goes to find the kitchen scissors and cuts the canvas until it can fit in the corner of the astronomy room, along the only wall that Cas hasn’t covered in plants.
Dean’s managed to tamp down the heart attacks when this happens, but some of his coworkers aren’t so desensitized; he catches the nearest of them staggering back a step when they notice Cas appear out of thin air, looking haggard and stranger than usual in his suit out here in the heat, especially next to Dean who’s stripped down to a wife beater. Dean gestures him away from prying ears, finds a place perched on a stone wall apart from the others who are also taking lunch.
“I did it because I’m intending to convey good will and affection through positive touch. Nonverbally,” he concludes. He inclines his head; this is not the full truth, but then Dean doesn’t always handle it well when he has it. He tends to…over-fixate on individual words. It’s merely effective that this excuse also lets Cas carefully step around what he knows Dean is really asking. “I hoped it might provide some measure of comfort.”
“Dean keeps having these truly horrific nightmares,” Cas informs her gravely. “I was bringing him something to help with that.”
“What happened to Alicia?” he asks when it occurs to him that he’s looking at a dating app; Charlie had them each make a Tinder together one drunken night a very long time ago, before all this happened with Dean.
jasmine-scented one but Cas’s stubborn insistence on the difference between the white jasmine, honeysuckle jasmine and smoked jasmine leaves Dean’s dissuasion attempts in the dust. Cas gets ten new candles and a lighter that has an intricate drawing of a skull growing pastel flowers painted on the side.
“Just from a distance?” he asks, and Cas doesn’t imagine how he nestles closer on the bed when he reclines toward the pillows, settling in with his food. Cas watches him carefully for a minute, expecting a retaliatory sneak attack.
He’s stripped down low for bed and answers the door that way for their delivery. Claire’s in the adjacent doorway, paying some pimply kid for two large pizzas, and she glances over Cas with an unreadable but slightly distasteful expression. Frowning down at himself, he misses when Claire closes the door without comment—and in his fluster, accidentally tips the delivery guy 40%.
“A hot sorority chick I dated when I was twenty,” Dean says. “She dealt hash to pay for her coke addiction.”
Cas looks at him, stroking his wrists. With a sigh, he looks at his glass of bourbon and drinks most of it in one swallow. Then he tips forward and kisses Dean again, cupping the back of his neck in one hand.
“Aw, don’t use me as a measure of your faith,” Dean sighs. It occurs to Cas that Dean’s hand is still on his knee. “You met me and look what happened to all that power and certainty. Huh? I just...break stuff. I broke
“Yes, I remember,” he says, warmer. It’s so strange to be sitting in a disused bar that nobody knows exists with a half-dressed man he saved from Perdition, discussing acts of godhood while Cas finds himself terrifyingly, undeniably human. His smile fades, leaving only a pinch in the middle of his forehead. Quietly, he says, “I have fallen further than I ever believed I could. Further than I conceived it was possible to fall. I was all-powerful. I was an angel with a mission, with a purpose. Now half my bones are broken, and I can’t even put a stupid bar back together—I can’t even make my own dinner. And I once found and reassembled the Righteous Man, who was
“Most of it,” Cas tells him serenely. He nods across the room. “I did step out briefly to pick up breakfast. Do you like everything bagels?”
“I suppose,” he sighs, more because he doesn’t want to talk it about any longer. He remembers he has a half-gone joint in the ashtray and digs his skull-and-flowers lighter out of the drawer. “Maybe it’s all good news. If the angels are focused on going after Metatron, then they’re not going to spend their energy trying to find me.”
This seems a bit of an exaggeration. True, Cas doesn’t know the intricacies of U.S. weed laws but considering Dean breaks several federal mandates on the daily, he assumes that between the two of them, Cas isn’t the one with the bigger rap sheet here.
Dean tries to hold the vampire’s stare, but his curiosity overwhelms him. He glances between the vampire and his number, if that’s what it is, and then reaches out to grab it with his machete still aloft.
“I’m just reminding you that it’s OK to keep living your life, Dean,” Cas says, buckling his seatbelt as though not looking at him will make the words burn any less. “That’s why he did this. So that everyone could move on.”
The Saturday after Cas moves in, Dean receives a phone call over breakfast. He picks up right at the table and has a five minute conversation about what sounds to Cas like the logistics of organizing a get together—something to do with
“Yeah? Well I don’t care about everyone right now,” he answers without heat. It is what it is what it is.
“No,” says Cas, nonplussed, blinking at him. “We’re single-minded units, Dean, not an organized army. And I’m not a general. We’re all just soldiers working towards a common goal.”
“I think I finally get why everybody wants to worship angels so much,” Dean says, which makes Cas laugh and scratch affectionately at his back where his fingers are already laying.
Dean doesn’t say anything, but after a minute Cas feels a hand touch the small of his back, warm through his sweatshirt.
He gets up and starts pulling open closets at random. Honestly, he has no idea where anything is in this whole bunker if it’s not his bedroom, the kitchen or the bathroom. Nowadays he barely even spends time in the library unless they’re working a case, although Dean hasn’t been taking a lot of those lately either. He doesn’t want to venture too far from the bunker anymore, because of Sam.
“Jesus Christ, just throw me back in Hell already,” Dean mutters, while Cas nods at a family passing on the trail. This incline is insane. Give him a few rounds with a demon any day over this.
Dean’s swinging a beer from one hand and dressed down in sweatpants now, and Cas instinctively scoots over on the bed so Dean has room to sit down next to him.
Two things about having a broken leg, several dislocated fingers and a couple of snapped ribs: It fucking sucks, and it’s kind of awesome. Cas is allowed to lay in bed nearly all day; when he’s in a good mood, Dean even brings him breakfast. He’s only expected to make an appearance for movie night and when Dean cooks something special for dinner, although Cas suspects that he’s been going out of his way more often recently to do just that.
“Why would you do that?” he asks slowly, putting his phone down and getting to his feet. Dean likes that phone, it’s better than when Cas used to buy burners and Dean never had a number for him. Sometimes it’s so hard to remember he’s an all-powerful celestial being when he does things like text or pad across the room like this, barefoot and messy-haired from a long day of travel and revelry. He’s just
It is warm and stuffy underneath their sheets, and Cas is a heavy, clinging weight beside him, on beneath him, on top of him...Dean has rarely done this before, but Cas makes it easy for him: All he has to do is follow the sweet sound of his voice and the encouraging twists of his body, and Dean’s already got a two year head start on that.
“What, like it’s the first angel we’ve killed?” They look at each other. “What if he’s doing something bad that we don’t know about?”
“Movie,” he counters. “I don’t have time to watch you run through all your worst pickup lines with every poor woman at the bar.”
“Right.” He clears his throat. “The Hellish part of him—the blood that Azazel put in your brother...It wants to be at rest too, but it
“I don’t understand this game,” Cas says. “Why is this ace a losing move? Usually when we play, it’s a trump card.”
“That too,” Cas says. It’s incredible that his I’m-so-fucking-ancient-and-powerful-and-don’t-you-forget-it voice still packs a punch when he’s naked in bed with messy, messy hair, but there it is, landing somewhere low and deep in Dean’s gut. “But Dean, I thought about it
“You’re not just a killer,” he says, and maybe because it’s early or because he’s not in the mood to get heavy or both, Dean interrupts him by kissing him instead. To be fair Cas lets himself get lured into it: Lets Dean slide his hands to his neck where it makes it hard to think and chases him when he tries to go.
Smiling, Dean squeezes his shoulder and gets up. He mouths something unintelligible but along with the hand movements, Cas understands the gist. He shoos Dean out of the room.
“You should drape lights around the windows for the night crowd…” Cas murmurs, tracing the outline in midair.
After they finish the five mile round trail, Cas finds a bar with a good wings special with his free hand while the other traps Dean’s over the gearshift. Dean downs three rum and cokes while he’s eating, and then they hit the remainder of the road.
Realizing his hands are trembling, Cas covers Dean’s with them and drags them down to hold against his chest.
Cas is still sparring, but then Hannah shouts, “Castiel, stop!” and she plants herself between Cas and his last attacker, blocking one’s forearm and the other’s knife. Hannah’s hair flies around her face in fury, and her blue eyes are very bright.
“No, I counted the melatonin and know that you haven’t been taking them,” says Cas. “And your meditation CDs are actively gathering dust.”
She reaches into her pocket and tosses something across the room. Dean catches it without thinking and opens his hand: Hex bag.
? Cas, I’m not doing better, alright? I’m coping. That’s all, I’m just—I’m barely hanging in there, day after day after day, and...it doesn’t
Alistair touches his knee. Dean knows it’s Alistair without looking at him, because who else would it be? Alistair’s favorite hellhound is here too, her claws already lodged deep in Dean’s chest. He cries out when she digs at him like she’s hidden her favorite bone nestled between his ribs.
When he wakes up, he only realizes that he hoped Dean would be here by now because of how crushingly disappointing it is that he isn’t. He’s so failing at the knight in shining armor routine right now, if that’s what he was going for. Not that Cas expects that, but he just—Purgatory happened. He didn’t hallucinate that, he’d stopped being crazy by then.
In the dream, the ornate room with the hellhounds is bigger. Disproportionately bigger. Dean feels in his bones like he could sprint the room and beat them to safety, and then tenses to try it—but before he can, the lights flicker. The first scratch of the hellhounds’ paws sounds beneath the door.
The hallway light sneaks under the door and glints off of Dean’s rings and the chain around his neck as he shifts, removing layers of clothes; and it’s in his eyes when he gets close enough to yank Cas in with a low sound and a tight grip on the back of his neck. Cas’s eyes are wide, and then they’re closed—and there’s certainly something he’s discovering here, kicking his feet with Dean’s in a bed that, despite being Cas’s, smells like the rest of the bunker which he thinks smells like home smells like
Cas drops his hand as he leads the way into what must be the head honchos’ tent. There’s a map spread out on a table with tacks clustered by color, which six angels are surrounding and talking in low, urgent voices, with Hannah recognizable among them. Cas comes to stand at a space at the head of the table.
When Cas pulls open the middle drawer there, he blinks. Pauses. Reaches into the drawer and pulls out a little ziploc bag.
Dean watches him for a long moment. His thumb traces circles behind Cas’s ear, and he memorizes the way he looks right now, with the bright South Dakota moon painting his dark face with pale light. For once, Cas looks as eternal and powerful as he really is, and Dean can’t fathom why it is something like him would ever choose to stay here and give up paradise for
“You don’t know that,” she says. She’s still forcing herself to be calm, it’s obvious in her voice, but her hand’s clenched into a fist on the table. “I just think that it’s only been—You’ve only been here for a week and a half.”
“Shh, shh. Oh, Dean. It’s okay. It’s gonna be okay,” Lisa’s telling him, right in his ear—all the usual bullshit people say when somebody’s upset at their feet. All of it just batters at his armor and falls right down to the floor, cracked in half straight down the middle. Dean gasps and claws at her, mindless, for a while.
“I admit...I don’t understand the ins and outs of what you’re doing here,” Cas said. “But I find the idea that it will somehow become a house…fascinating.”
Alex is a grumpy but clearly bright young woman who mostly sits by the fire and uses her phone rapid-fire without looking at any of the adults. Donna goes to occupy her after awhile, pretending she doesn’t notice that Alex dumped all the soda out of the can she’s holding and filled it up with beer instead. Dean hears the girl ask if she can take off early to go meet up with a couple of friends. Jody and Bobby are sitting on the other side of the flames, huddled close together beneath a thick blanket and talking in low voices. Dean realizes that he hasn’t seen Cas in awhile; he finds him in the kitchen, picking at a nicely arranged platter of cheese and crackers.
“Let him go. Just leave it,” Dean murmurs in his ear, jostling him toward the door. Other diners are starting to stare.
Benny’s arms come around him in a bear hug that’s so tight, he and Dean automatically sway to the left. Clapping Dean on the shoulder with one big hand when he pulls away, he shakes Cas’s with the other so enthusiastically that Cas looks a little bit alarmed. Ruffling up Cas’s hair in the back, Dean gestures them over to the booth he saw Benny in before. Cas doesn’t move over that much when he slides in, so Dean has to press up against him just to fit in the same side of the booth.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s good, Dean,” he explains patiently. “Creation, love, nurturing growth—it’s all the same thing. I don’t know if that’s the reason I was made by my Father. In fact, I doubt it. I think he made me to be a perfect soldier and listen to whatever the angels wanted.”
“Are you kidding me right now?” Dean tips his drink at him. “You’re giving me interior decorating advice?”
“Great! It’s next Sunday at four. I hope to see you there,” Neal said. “I gotta run, gotta pick my daughter up from gymnastics. Dean, I’ll catch you later?”
First he sits on the side of the road and buries his face in his hands. Then, when he’s cried his fill, he gets up and walks until he comes upon the lights of the nearest town, about four miles down the road. From a payphone just outside of Albany, New York, Cas dials a familiar number with one quarter he found after a painstaking search of local convenience stores’ floors and all along the side of the road on the way here. The phone rings six times. Is this what it feels like to wait, to not just fly away wherever he wants to go? Cas is missing his wings more than he thought was possible.
The last of the trees break a little less than ten minutes later. It’s nearly nine now, so the witch has definitely made itself scarce; Cas didn’t say what it was, but he promised Hannah had set up a surefire distraction to keep the witch far, far away from here tonight.
“Bad,” Cas says. “Also the heater has been acting up all day, and the cold air’s making my broken leg ache.”
“I know.” Cas looks at his feet, uncharacteristically awkward. Well, the dude’s always awkward—just usually minus the shame, or whatever it is that’s flickering over his face now. “I didn’t want to get in the way.”
“Yeah, I’m, uh—” Dean slung his arm around Cas’s shoulder, pulling him tight to his side. “I was just teaching my friend here a few things about building a house.”
Hesitantly, Cas catches Dean’s shirt between the backs of two fingers and Dean sways closer. But he lets him go, and Cas’s hand comes to rest covering Dean’s own on his knee, where he splays his fingers out and lets them warm Dean’s own. For a beat, Dean’s frozen like that under his touch. It’s not the worst feeling in the whole wide world.
“Is that this weekend already?” he asks, trying to feign interest for her sake. This means that Dean’s going to be gone all weekend, which equals a lot of sleeping and painting on Cas’s part. Maybe Sam can find them a hunt so they’re not too bored without him.
“Then we’ll gank the bastard and skip merrily off into the sunset,” Dean says, throwing his arms out. “I didn’t even know if you were ready to
“You’re smart, kid,” Dean tells Claire. He glances around surreptitiously and passes her a beer, and Cas pretends not to notice.
He looks over and finds Cas smiling at him, but Cas almost immediately looks away and flips the TV to the right channel. Dean offers him a couple of Cheez-Its from the bag, which Cas seems to like better than he likes the movie—he eats more than half, but during one of the commercial breaks, he turns to Dean and declares, “This movie has too many guns and too much tuberculosis.”
“Sure, no problem, Cas,” Dean mutters to himself as he trips over yet another branch crawling its way along the path. “I’ll just go on a nighttime hike. This flashlight will definitely be enough to stop me from breaking my damn ankles. And then when I do, we can celebrate by feeding my ass to a siren and a
Here’s the part that Cas was fighting so fiercely against: Dean swallows a bottle of sleeping pills and lays down on their bed with his arms splayed out. Cas sits by his side while Dean’s falling asleep.
“But I’ve changed,” he says, in a voice that tugs on Cas’s heartstrings. Shit, in some ways he doesn’t blame Crowley: The guy was a demon, they were forged in literal fire. He knows he’s just biased because that could have—would’ve—been Dean if Cas didn’t do what he did, but that knowledge doesn’t make the urge any less compelling.
Dean looks at him for a long time. Maybe he can’t think of anything to say to that, or he can’t make himself give voice to it. He twists Cas’s shirt tighter and drags him down to his waiting mouth.
“I’ll try to leave at sunrise,” he promises. “It’s a long drive, Cas, are you sure you can’t get any closer to me?”
“It’s fine. It’s Bobby. We’ll pick him up a bottle when we go into town tomorrow.” Dean concludes. “Hey.”
“I mean it,” he says. “I chose this, Dean. I chose not to go looking for a solution to getting our wings back. And I chose to close down Heaven.”
“What? No, I’m not—” He glances around the table for backup that doesn’t come. “What did I say about you doing the ‘angel on my shoulder’ routine?”
It’s fitting, Dean thinks. He hopes that when the sky inevitably opens up, the hurricane soaks him to the bone. He hopes it’s chilly, he hopes it’s torrential. It’s not even a fraction of what Sam’s been through since Dean let him jump one year ago to the day.
It’s not hard to imagine that Sophie’s got a few loved ones who she wants to make sure are set up alright up there; you can’t be in this life, playing with these stakes, and not have any skin in the game. Dean looks at her. She frowns at Dean. Finally Dean lets her up off the floor and Sophie dusts off her sheer violet dress, curling her lip. She jerks her head toward the exit.
“What’s up with him?” she asks, jerking her thumb over her shoulder. Cas looks on in askance, not sure what to say.
“Do you guys have a sound system in this place?” Charlie interrupts them, which is probably wise because Cas is considering tipping forward into the frustration that’s pooling after that comment, although it’s inching further out of reach as Cas takes his turn.
“Sorry,” Dean murmurs against his lips. “I don’t think God gets the credit for this little piece of handiwork anymore.”
“I’ve been thinking,” Cas announces from one foot behind Dean, which is apparently how he thinks it’s appropriate to introduce himself.
They talk strategy for awhile. Claire reaches for a second beer and Cas smacks her hand out of the air.
Cas raises his eyes to the ceiling and lets out a long, heavy breath. His mouth twists as he looks back at Dean’s face, close and frustrating and desperate to help.
“I didn’t ask you to do that, Cas,” he says, each syllable deliberate. His hands are raised defensively. He takes a step back. “I didn’t ask you to fall.”
He was worried that becoming a full-on angel again would make Cas ghost him or go cold again, but even if Cas is faking the feelings underneath it all, he sure likes their new principle of doing whatever they want, whenever they want. They’ve earned their free will, after all. As far as Dean can tell, Cas likes kissing. And baking. And tending to the garden he planted out back, and browsing nearby pet adoption websites (so far, Dean has
With one last kiss, Dean grabs his lunch off the counter and hurries out the door into the bright Indiana sunlight. When he looks back, Cas is standing in the doorway barefoot and lazy, waving him goodbye.
Dean just leans back, studying his face, his mouth open to say something. Maybe to talk himself out of it. It’s all well and good to waltz in and ask out his best friend, but having him actually in front of him for the metaphorical taking, well, Cas knows firsthand how those are two very different things.
It’s nearly a day’s drive back to Kansas. Cas understands the need to stop for the night in the middle, but he wishes Dean believed in stopping
He touches Dean’s hand where it’s draped over his chest, tugs on it twice then lets him go. Dean studies the side of his face and slips off his shoulders.
They order pizza for lunch, and after a lengthy argument between Dean and Charlie about whether pineapple or anchovies taste better as topping, they get one of each and make Cas the tie breaker. He thinks that both of them have incredibly out-of-whack taste buds and picks off the anchovies to eat it plain.
Two months after Dean moves into Lisa’s, he gets a job: Four days a week on a construction crew, mostly fixing up poolhouses or adding on units over on the rich side of town. Three weeks after that, Dean celebrates his fourth nightmare-free sleep in a row. He thinks that drinking a large glass of whiskey before bed is his lucky charm.
folded on his pleas to get a dog), and watching Dean work after he visits him for lunch sometimes, and arguing with him about what’s on the radio while they fly down the highway to the other side of the city. Dean wins this particular round and chooses the first mixtape they listen to, and despite his tangible, prickling irritation, Cas’s fingertips drum out the beat on Dean’s jeans when he reaches over to hold onto his knee.
“And we’re working,” Dean adds. “So maybe you should...Alright, that’s great.” He slides into the booth opposite Cas as soon as the guy’s gone. “What the hell was that about?”
“Tell me you put up defenses on this place,” Dean says, but the angels don’t answer: They just keep chanting. Dean grabs Cas’s shoulder. “Cas, tell me what warding to check!”
He already has to contend with the cumbersome pain of broken bones; remembering the feel of that immobilizing contraption holding his head in place while his family drilled into him isn’t a feeling he wants to be reminded of when he’s doing good things like making out with Dean.
“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news,” Dean says. He jerks his head, meandering further into the room. One of the others raises a knife, and Dean stops. “What are a couple of hardworking professionals like you doing torturing one measly vampire bitch?”
The side street comes out of nowhere, same as the dark. Dean pulls up to an empty spot on the curb and kills the engine and then just looks over to where the lights on the house are blinking through the front windows. His fingers flex on the steering wheel, still tense from the long drive.
ago? Bobby isn’t usually that slow. He waited, he waited until the anniversary so he could—What? Have an excuse to bring it up? See how Dean’s doing? Try to reunite under the guise of shared grief?
. And it’s bad that it feels so bad, because Dean’s seen a lot of gore in his day. Worrying about Sam’s death felt like this, only...different. And he doesn’t like that it’s different. A word is tugging on the corner of his mind, but Dean pushes it away.
“What did you do?” she demands. She drops to her knees and grabs Dean’s shirt with both fists, yanking him upright. He gasps unattractively in her face. “
“We’d better make sure,” Dean breathes. He pauses, looming tall and beautiful in the moonlight and a new expression crossing his face, not sexy. “Did you call the coroner back with everything we found today?”
In the library, Cas turns a page in a large book of old alchemy tricks. Sam, sitting at the other table with his legs extended, is clearly texting his girlfriend that he thinks they don’t know about and pretending to read a hellspawn bestiary. Cas’s eyes jump to Dean when he appears in the entry.
in bright red and yellow. It’s exactly the kind of ugly thing that Dean should’ve gone into Goodwill and vetoed for him. He can’t really be seen out in public with him like this. In front of the neighbors?
The air still feels stifled between them. Cas does nothing but watch the golden petal on the flower by his hip as he listens to Dean go.
Before he can think himself out of it, Dean takes the sides of his face in either hand—he’s still standing close enough that he barely has to reach out—brings Cas close, and kisses him. Cas is warm and resolute against him, his mouth firm, his hands grasping. He keeps stroking the sides of Dean’s face, leaning all of his weight into him and touching him the way Dean imagines he did the first time Cas put him back together: Reverent, greedy, sure.
It’s a slow news day on all the relevant state channels, which more or less means that there’s nothing particularly funky going on within Indiana’s borders. They’re watching a politician lay out his new clean water initiative while Dean finishes eating, and Cas gets dressed; he throws on a pair of jeans and leaves on the shirt printed with Schrödinger’s irony along with the only non-dress shoes he owns.
Cas’s expression is bordering on hilarious: He looks simultaneously like the entirety of the English language dropped straight out of his vocabulary and like he’s never wanted anything more than to spend the night in ratty sweatpants pretending not to watch a guy sleep.
Dean puts up his hands. “Can’t. I got some more research to do tonight, for Garth. You crazy kids have fun though.”
“What?” Dean asks. Like a confused animal, he kisses Cas again short and sweet, begging for a response because he’s been faced with sudden withdrawal. The urge to soothe him rises and crests.
“Dean,” he says, and Dean thinks that only Cas can say his name like this: Like an admonishment and warning and so, so heartbroken at the same time.
Cas spends twenty-five minutes standing in the candle aisle, carefully picking out every single scent he can stomach. Dean tries to insist that they don’t really need a
He doesn’t get to really talk to Cas again until after they all finish trading ghost stories around the fire and getting appropriately drunk for this reunion, growing more raucous as the night goes on. Cas has enough beers to roll up his sleeves, which is a win because Dean never had hopes of getting an angel smashed tonight so at least he’s getting somewhere, anywhere at all.
Cas tilts his head. It’s not fair to have an argument with someone capable of begging like that. His sorry expression is an unfair advantage. Cas didn’t know there were so many intricacies to fighting and forgiving before he met Dean.
“Dean,” she says, surprised. She sounds just like he thought she would. “Oh, thank god! Are you alright?”
me night in her head, even if they don’t actually play one, but he hopes she won’t say this out loud in front of Dean.
“No,” Ben says matter-of-factly. “You took your go-bag. And you were only gone three days, your only family is half a day’s drive from here. What, did you drive straight there and hang out for two days without any sleep?”
time I saw you. When you would say my name or—or reach out and pray to me, I felt it burning through me like a fire. I knew that wasn’t...normal.”
“Yes, he’s...doing something,” Cas says, not bothering to pretend to lie because Dean says that he’s not very good at it. Cas drags his gaze from Dean’s back to this guy’s pretty face; it’s not the worst view he’s ever settled for, he thinks, assessing him. Good-looking but he doesn’t really do it for Cas. Maybe if they didn’t have a case to work, and if his alternative wasn’t spending the night with Dean. “Do
It’s true; she trotted right up to the backseat of the borrowed car without any fuss whatsoever. Miracle barked when they got back to the bunker and stuffing his set leg in the front seat of a car was worth it for the excited way she waited at the door like she knew she was coming home.
“Sorry.” Dean pulls a face. “I don’t think they stock up on heavenly bombshells in the homegoods aisle.”
Her purple shoes walk out of his line of vision, and the door opens and then slams shut. Dean says his name, voice jumping down an octave once Sophie’s gone. Then the books on top of Cas’s head begin shifting.
Dean flinches and then shoulders away from Cas, putting some space between them. Cas always stands too fucking close. It’s suffocating. It’s fucking ridiculous, that’s what it is. And he’s still standing too close, muscling back into Dean’s space to get near and hiss in his ear.
Dinner is quiet. Cas doesn’t always eat in the kitchen with him; sometimes Dean brings a plate to his room and sits on the end of his bed pretending like he’s not watching Cas finish his dinner, but usually Dean just leaves him alone if he doesn’t feel like company.
Lisa has a tray of various drinks already set up in the living room. Dean picks up the whiskey decanter and pours himself a strong glass but Cas touches his wrist when he goes to put it down. He nods, and when Dean pours him some too, Cas grabs his forearm and lets the touch linger.
It’s been a long day in the car, and although Dean has missed hitting the road with Baby for longer drives, he and Cas started getting on each other’s nerves around hour number five and that was all the way back at sunset. It’s long been dark when he pulls the car up the driveway, and the house is cold. Dean goes right to the thermostat when he gets in and Cas takes the opportunity to snag first shower.
“Yep. So I’m just waiting on you, slowpoke,” Charlie says, shooting him finger guns. He still doesn’t know what that’s supposed to mean. “You said you’d show me Rocky’s now that it’s all done.”
when he really wants—Dean would be a pile of maple-scented ash on this diner floor already. Instead Cas is silent for about five long, uncomfortable minutes; it makes Dean itch underneath the collar, even though Cas is probably just relishing in the environment he’s creating in this little diner booth between them. That knowledge does nothing to soothe the awkward feeling in his gut. Meanwhile Dean can feel the seconds ticking by like each individual one is crawling down his skin while he sits there, and Cas is a marble statue on the other side of the booth.
That makes Dean smile. He folds the paper in half and slips it into his pocket, and Benny starts backing up with his hands still in the air. When he’s far enough away, he turns to run, freezes, and looks back over his shoulder.
, it does, in fact, sound like me,” Crowley’s lip curls. “Look around you, Dean. Demons can’t survive on Earth anymore. We’re being picked off and given a one-way ticket back downstairs one by one.”
“I’m worried about him, Cas,” Dean says, looking up at him with shining eyes. His throat works. “It’s been months, and we’re not any closer to knowing what’s wrong with him…”
Dean starts to turn over, but the grip tightens as Cas uses it to leverage himself down to the bed, too. Dean can feel him, still half-propped like he isn’t sure if he’s allowed to relax. The touch loosens, and without thinking, Dean claps his hand over Cas’s on his arm before he can move too far away.
“Sorry about that,” Dean says, flipping his knife around to grip it more securely. “It’s not personal. Really. I’m just running an errand for a friend.”
Cas thinks about Naomi. He thinks about how many Deans he saw as a bloody, murdered corpse on the floor, and how when push came to shove, Dean told Cas everything he needed to know on his knees in a crypt looking for the Word of God, and Cas didn’t do it.
“What if the girls forget the iron chains again?” Cas asks, lost in thought squinting at the wall but he knows Dean’s listening.
“Deputy Director Fabray,” he says, propping the cell phone under his ear. “Mhm. Yes, she’s one of mine. Of course, I’ll tell the same to your boss.”
“I’m just happy...that you’re still here,” he responds carefully. He studies Dean’s face. “Also that strange teenager said she would sell me marijuana, and I’m very much looking forward to trying it with you.”
“I...You’re welcome,” he says, wrong-footed. Sometimes Cas holds grudges for months; sometimes his mood swings fly by in a minute. It’s hard to wrap his head around. It’s hard to keep up. He decides to just start eating again too, and say as casually as he can, “I thought you told me not to call you.”
“I’m sorry. It’s just more intense than it used to be,” Cas explains. “I assume losing my grace had something to do with it. It’s not as dull anymore, it’s just...it’s always there. Maybe I’m only noticing it more often because I have all these other, new human considerations that should take precedence in my head, but I always find myself...” He blows out a heavy breath, eyes unspacing out to roll back to Charlie. “Distracted.”
“I would like that, yes,” Cas says. The air congeals between them, and Cas frowns, shifting to face her. “I’m sorry, it’s not that I don’t enjoy your company. You are actually…very nice. I’m just very new to the whole ‘being human’ thing.”
“So you’ll think about it?” Cas says. He sounds monotone as ever, but Dean thinks he detects a note of anxiety somewhere in his voice anyway. Huh.
“Some of the other soldiers believe there’s a weapon nearby, a weapon that will help our side in the war,” Cas says, low. Dean goes still, not expecting him to talk business here but instantly on high alert. Ingrained instincts die hard. “One of the lieutenants, Hannah. She’s a good friend of mine. She believes that she’s found its location after many months of fruitless searching.”
As predicted, Dean does. It’s loud and lit in an awful gold that’s both too bright and very unflattering. Their wings are juicy. The game on TV is close, the late night adult cartoons in the mirror above the bar are mildly uncomfortable. All their jokes skate the line of sexual innuendo or what Cas considers a moral failing on multiple different levels but Dean informs him is mere ‘political incorrectness,’ whatever that means.
, even. He sets aside the paper he was idly sketching on, too caught up in this strange show on Cartoon Network to do anything else after he finished his cereal: This anxious dog is plagued by ghosts.
And then Cas is there: Not the one who came to see him in his dream last night but a different one, colder. He isn’t looking at Dean; his eyes are fixed on Jo instead.
“That we visit our families a shitload?” Dean guesses. He glances at the girls. “Do not repeat that.”
. Cas and Dean had been fighting about all the Home Depot charges on his credit cards at the time. Cas never got that joke.
Dean watched him come closer with a serene feeling blooming in his chest. The sun was warm on his face, beading sweat along his hairline.
“I know, and I want answers. But Charlie’s coming over,” Cas says. “We’re supposed to watch something called a...D.E.B.S.”
“Jesus Christ!” Dean jumps so hard that his stack of boxes topple to the floor. He spins around and then breathes out, all at once. “Cas, damn it.”
“OK, that’s enough!” Dean shouts, waving his hands to block both their views. “Come on! I’m not some—some—”
Then Anna Milton’s face looms suddenly out of the dark. She appears so suddenly that Dean sways, pulling up short.
“Uh—working, actually,” Dean says, blinking as though surprised. At this or Cas’s reply, he doesn’t know. “A couple of hunters found them when they fell, and they kinda...teamed up with each other, I guess.”
“Very. We have a ton of regular hunters coming through now.” Cas tips his head onto his other shoulder before the hold music cuts off on the phone tucked beneath his ear, and Cas jumps upright. “Hello? Angela Mabel’s office? Yes, the rude blonde who came in this morning—”
“That’s actually suboptimal,” Cas says. “I don’t know about—Where did you say we were, Dean? Bumfuck, Indiana—but most humans consider an ‘A’ to be a—”
“You come down here, and you—you tell me that most of the time, you wanna be here. With me,” says Dean. “But then you keep running off to play soldier again—”
“Oh.” Cas flicks his thumb against the edge of the book he was reading. He leans back and rolls his eyes upward, sending up a quick prayer for mercy—not that anybody’s listening. “Awesome.”
“You weren’t there,” Dean says, shaking his head. “Seeing Sam, it hurt, Cas. But seeing you act that way…”
“Don’t you think she’s a little young for you?” Dean admonishes Charlie when Alicia steps away to use the bathroom.
“Sorry,” Dean says loudly, appearing behind him. He claps the guy on the shoulder and grins, showing his teeth. The guy looks rattled for some reason, glancing at Dean’s hand lingering on his bare skin. “He’s on the job.”
“Someone was very interested in my money,” Cas says, feeling sour again. He twists out of Dean’s grasp. “I had three dollars on me.”
a gay bar. Do the math,” she says. She pushes off the desk and is across the room in a flash. Cas shrinks back against the door, feeling behind for the knob. Shit, shit— “Are you here to kill me?”
Dean’s a normal, human man with normal, human romantic feelings for other normal human beings—but if he could manifest this house into a living, breathing woman and marry her, he’d do it in an instant. Hell, he’d take her out to Vegas for a honeymoon and try to win them millions on the slots.
“Yeah, huge win for feminism,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “We know where she’ll be on the full moon—”
He leans in an inch closer, presumably to drive home his glare. Then he blips out. Dean slumps against the wall, breathing harder, as soon as the grip on his lapels vanishes.
pass, and Cas just watches him without rest. Dean’s hand lands on his shoulder and Cas stares as his thumb begins to stroke his t-shirt, brushing over the bottom of his collarbone.
Cas looks from their hands up to his face. Dean’s got an exceptional amount of freckles this close, which he knew but it never fails to amaze.
“I’m just being honest, Dean,” he says, not sure why Dean’s looking at him like that. After riding Cas so much over the past several years about telling him the truth, always, he looks a little strange now that Cas actually is. “You know I always appreciate our talks and our time together.”
“Well I didn’t bring you back here to flirt with you, sweetheart,” she purrs. Sophie’s gaze flicks over him and seems to find something lacking; her upper lip curls delicately into a sneer. Cas crosses his arms.
“Well, forgive me for being confused,” Cas says, throwing his hands in the air. “I’ve only ever seen you retain one. Me.”
“Well it’s true,” Cas says, ignoring the impulse to soothe Dean’s concern. He feels feverish, like he used to when he was insane and things got tense; he feels like a rabid dog with no control over his bark. If he could fly himself to the living room and lock all the doors, he would.
Dean can’t breathe. He can feel it all in a ball of wind in his throat. Cas is half-furious, half-open: So much contained in such a big, blue stare. Dean swallows hard and tries to think of something to say, but there’s nothing in his head except Cas’s face. Cas’s open, serious face. The only lifeline Dean has left…
The angels have a range of artifacts on the table, from a long golden blade that Dean suspects used to live in a sewing box to a bone about the size of Dean’s hand—but it’s a funky blue color, not human. Cas looks around at the table, takes a deep breath and reaches for the blade.
The thought of his former kind being gone stings, but that’s not why he stops when he gets into the bar, swaying off his bad foot.
The next week is slow, the one after that even slower; Dean passes out as soon as he gets home at the end of it, barely even hanging up on Lisa before he faceplants straight into bed. He plans on spending the day working on the house tomorrow, and right now he’s worried that he’ll never be able to move again.
Cas loses spectacularly to Charlie in COD, but mostly because he loses interest as soon as he starts falling behind. He sighs when the round is over and puts down his controller.
Clearly she’d been conspiring with Cas, because he showed up soon afterwards and shoved him up against Lisa’s shed, got all up in his face the way he did. Under threat of death, Cas told him to stop going where he couldn’t come straight home to heal up perfectly—unless he wanted to let Cas fix him up after a hunt. Dean shoved him away after that.
It’s also the most at home that Dean’s felt in months, the minute he hunkers down with pie and cards on a dirty motel carpet. Cas picks up his hand confusedly, glancing up at Dean’s face for approval.
“I think you guys are sweet,” Ben pipes up. Dean makes a face, and Ben sticks his tongue out right back.
“I don’t think of it like that,” Cas says, tilting his head. “Making time for you matters. You’re important to me, Dean.”
For his part, the kid seems really psyched that Dean’s there at all. He sits right next to him at the table, edging out Castiel, who shoots Ben little glares while he’s sighing his way around to sit across from him instead. Dean nudges Cas’s foot when he sits down.
Dean put him on phone duty recently, a hobby to keep him busy so he doesn’t strain himself limping around. Cas latched onto it with surprising enthusiasm; his people skills are improving every time. Cas taps the ash off his joint and breathes out.
“You can’t…” Dean stops. He licks his lips and tries again. “You can’t just say that and then go right back to ditching me.”
“My home,” he clarifies. “I don’t want anybody here stirring up trouble and pointing the local authorities over to me.”
Charlie throws her arms around him when she comes in, and Cas chuckles in her ear, hugging her back. Everything instantly feels easier now that Charlie’s here.
“Do you know what people at the bar think when we take impromptu vacations together like this?” Cas asks, wandering back into the room as he hangs up.
“I am just...worried about you,” Cas says, taking deep, audible breaths. “You have a tendency to rush into things half-cocked, especially when you’re upset.”
“I don’t know what to tell you, Cas. Welcome to being normal!” Dean throws his hands in the air. “Maybe you should go get your prostate checked if you’re peeing too much.”
The ghoul is a nasty sonofabitch…for an amateur, but Dean’s got some big notches in his belt and he kills the sucker no problem. His biggest causality is getting covered in sewer sludge from head-to-toe. He spends forty-five minutes in the shower that night, scrubbing himself clean.
“Cas?” he asks, kind of lazily kissing his jaw, kind of just lying there and watching his fingers trace the bumps of Cas’s ribs underneath his bared skin.
The UPS guy dropped off a new couch this morning. They’ve already argued about moving the TV into the living room now that it’s finished—argued about it a shitload of times.
“You didn’t introduce me, you...pimped me out, would be a more accurate description,” says Cas. “Let’s just play flag capture.”
? Oh hell yes!” Dean shuts the door, crosses the room in three easy strides and jumps into his place in the bed. “Scoot over, man. This movie is so awesome.”
“Oh my God. Does it really bother you that much?” Cas demands. He steps closer, squinting up into Dean’s face. He never throws a fit with Charlie or Sam smokes. “I’ve
loops huge in cartoonish red letters. The chairs are all set out, the music’s set lively but not distracting.
He learns his lesson about being green the hard way, after Forrest shows him a better place in the park to sleep and then Cas makes the mistake of getting up in the middle of the night to pee.
to come home with me,” he says stubbornly. “Miracle followed me all the way back here, without much calling.”
too serious with his fantasy roleplaying—our LARP thing,” Dean clarifies, noticing the mystified look on Cas’s face. He takes Cas’s joint, angles Cas’s face toward him and presses over onto Cas’s pillow to breathe his smoke back into Cas’s mouth. Smiling, apparently pleased, Dean kisses him softly.
They go back to bed around four in the morning. Cas acts like he isn’t following Dean’s lead, so he waits a couple of minutes to shut off the TV as well as the lights. And Dean, who feels like he can’t protect anyone worthwhile most of the time, holds out his arms for Cas to curl into them on top of his chest.
Despite the long weeks of searching, Dean hasn’t found anything that can wake up Sam. It’s definitely not a regular coma, so the doctors are all but useless (Dean’s rants always accentuate this point in particular), but as far as they’ve read there’s not much lore on what to do after you complete a bunch of ancient trails to shut the Gates to Hell and completing this mission is supposed to kill you, but it doesn’t. Cas thinks it’s probably got something to do with Sam having demon blood, but surprise surprise, there’s not much lore on yellow-eyed demons turning babies into latent super soldiers either.
He makes another minute’s small talk with her while he finishes paying for his munchies. She pulls her flannel tighter around herself and waves as Cas pushes back out into the cold.
“Dean!” he says, dropping to his knees. Behind him, a stream of angels are filing inside and swarming the siren, but then Cas’s face is in his and Dean can’t see anything else at all. Cas grabs his shoulders, looking him over frantically. “Dean? What’s wrong? What’s happening?”
“What the hell happened?” Lisa demands, pushing him suddenly back. “I saw the kitchen and the yard, and I thought—”
“Dean,” he says from the bed. Neon signs from the parking lot peek through the curtains and flicker across the sheets. Cas’s hair is all mussed on one side, comically so; and his eyes are wide. “That’s for tomorrow.”
Dean fixes up all the bare spots, but it’s not as late as he thought by the time he gets done—he still has nearly two hours before Lisa gets home. Ben’s going to study at a friend’s tonight, so it’ll be just the two of them after dinner; Dean should make a nice dessert to surprise her. He should find good music and a movie on TV.
“I never reckoned that Heaven was real,” Benny says, “but if I had, I never would’ve thought that they’d give two shits about monsters. Even the ancient ones.”
This isn’t what Dean was expecting. He doesn’t know what he was expecting, but definitely not that. His hand freezes and he splays it out on Cas’s chest, using it to push himself up so he can stare down at him.
“We could play a game,” Cas suggests. One of them accidentally tore off the corner of a page when they were reading. He balls it up and flicks it across the table.
The call takes a very long time. They keep putting him on hold to discuss “family business” amongst themselves, although he highly doubts his ability to find someone who’ll give Claire a key to the crypt she got caught breaking into last week. They need to have another stealth refresher ASAP.
Dean’s still looking at him all soft. He stands up and shakes his head at Charlie, and Cas sways toward him; it’s instinctive to close the distance. He wants to remind Dean that he’s not an angel anymore, either, but then he wonders if the moment’s passed until it’s been so long that it really
“I don’t, Dean,” he says, shaking his head slowly. “Not anymore. Not for one second. When I chose free will…”
“Yes, the human part of me is gone. That’s true,” Cas murmurs—thoughtfully, he thinks. His big blue eyes find Dean’s and settle. His fingers clench even tighter. “But you showed me the path to righteousness before, Dean. I’m confident you can do it again.”
“Yeah, you seem back and better than ever.” Dean’s eyes trace the ceiling. “Don’t make me carry you again.”
He shifts closer to Dean on the bed, and now he’s the one leaning over Dean; his hand hesitates over Dean’s heart before landing hard beside his shoulder. Dean swallows. Without thinking, he reaches up and pushes his fingers through Cas’s hair.
Dean frowns, serious now. He leans down until Cas is forced to meet his eye, and Dean holds his gaze as their heads lift, in tandem like magnets. Dean points sternly.
Dean shakes his head, dropping it down between his shoulders. With a playful grunt, he yanks on Cas’s shirt until he tips forward.
“Are they yours?” Cas retorts, annoyance prickling along the back of his neck at her line of questioning, though for no reason he can discern.
He tries to say something, grits his teeth against the pain in his ribs instead. He thumps the floor as hard as he can from this angle to let Dean know he’s still alive.
“That sounds like just the vacation you need,” Benny says wisely. “Every time you call, you seem to have some kind of work disaster on your hands.”
Cas breaks out in a very relieved smile. Then he drops Dean’s shoulder and swiftly rearranges his face back into a glare.
“Nothing,” Cas says finally. Dean raises one eyebrow, and he relents. “She thinks that I’ve...spent a lot of time down here, that’s all. It’s made me more human in some ways...I’m beginning to care about things. People.” Cas glances at Dean’s face again.
“Well I’m sorry I’m such an inconvenience to you,” Dean sneers. “Taking time out of your precious schedule—”
“Hey, your purpose is creating stuff and my purpose is killing stuff,” Dean says. “That’s kinda romantic, we’re like night and day.”
Cas moves toward the door in frustration, like he’s going to storm out like some angry heroine in a Brontë novel. Dean grabs his arm and yanks him around.
“If you attempt to hug me, I will find an ancient spell to turn me back into a seraph and smite you until you’re a pile of ashes on the floor,” Cas threatens.
Dean doesn’t see Cas for a month. There’s no word, there’s no sign of him. After two weeks, Dean stops expecting to look up and find him hovering in the doorway. He fills his time with the house, with work, with Neal and Jenny from next door. He keeps his eye on a medium-sized radius around the address Benny gave him, but he never hears about anything that sounds like a vampire attack, not there or anywhere else in the whole state.
He jolts completely upright in his bed to find Ben hovering in the guest doorway, one hand on the knob and his eyes enormous. Dean sweeps his hand through his hair. He can feel his sweaty t-shirt sticking to his back, shit.
“Dean! You have no idea what you’re meddling with!” Cas yanks him forward and slams him back again. “Leave celestial affairs alone. I mean it.”
Cas has to minutely tighten the grip he’s slid into Dean’s hair for him to let Cas breathe. Dean’s mouth is shaky, hovering close, and there’s a shift deep within Cas, something he’s not used to feeling. It starts in the center of his bones. It’s tangible in the tips of his shaking fingers, in the upward curve to Cas’s lips, in the moments Dean catches his breath still tipped closer than he has to be and a pleased, almost smug smile tugging like the dawn across his face.
He finally, mercifully, meets Samandriel in the middle. The angel barely touches his shoulder, muttering, “Go, Dean!” before Dean takes off running for the center of camp.
After a local movie theater grabs Cas’s attention with some film about animals, they double back to get the car so he can store his jar and ditch their weapons in case the theater has metal detectors inside the doors.
But Cas doesn’t get back to his research. Dean goes back to sleep, although slower. He can feel Cas’s eyes on him the whole time from the other side of the room.
They glare at each other for a minute, steady. A strange, light feeling raises in his chest like a filling balloon and it’s—easier, Dean realizes. It’s an argument about something besides Gods and Devils and the fucking Apocalypse. Dean breathes out. He leans back in his chair.
There’s a commercial break when Cas sits up suddenly, and Dean’s very comfortable cushion slips out from beneath his head. Dean looks up at him.
“You better hope he’s in one piece, you goddamn motherfucking bitch,” Dean says with this dark, dangerous laughter.
Cas helps him to his feet and together they stumble over to lean against the table. He lays his hand on Dean’s cheek, and the new bruises he felt darkening from the crown of his head down to the base of his spine all heal at once under a burning blue glow. Dean clutches his sleeve, just drinking in his closeness. Man, he’s glad they’re alive.
“Hmm,” he deduces, and pulls out of Dean’s arms so he can listen without distractions. He nestles up against Dean’s side and closes his eyes, and Dean allows it, stroking his arm vaguely in time to the drums and giving him the space he needs to fish the bowl out of the drawer.
It’s a ghost possession case, the kind that stains his nailbeds with ectoplasm for a week no matter how hard he scrubs at them in the shower. Dean gets through it without any major life-threatening scares, but he does get knocked in the head and the bitch slashes at his shoulder, so that’s bleeding into his jacket while his ears ring the whole way home. His bum shoulder gets zapped with a lightning flash of pain every time he jiggles the wheel just so; it’s only ten minutes back to Lisa’s, but it sucks major ass.
He gestures out the door. If Cas uses his x-ray vision, Superman style, then he can see the collection of wood beams and partially-constructed walls scattered around the plot with his workbenches and tools.
“At least you have Dean,” she says, and Cas shrugs, looking away. Softer, she adds, “And you have me.”
With his eyes on the both of them, Dean reaches one hand behind himself, and rubs his jacket against the wall. If his aim’s right, there should be a sigil just between his shoulder blades.
Dean keeps yawning but can’t seem to sleep; he curls around Cas even while Cas talks through his show and generally pushes his buttons, for no reason except that he had a 5PM coffee and can’t get appropriately tired himself. Not long after Cas tries and fails for a fourth time to sleep, he nestles his head closer to Dean’s pillow. His eyes are barely open and his breath lands on Cas’s collar, comfortingly even.
“...and more than the day before that, and the day before that,” Cas says, because it’s true, and because Dean is a little funny after all: Eyebrows halfway up his forehead, not sure where to put his hands. He settles for balling them in the bed on either side of Cas’s head.
Dean’s quiet for a minute, watching his fingers trace invisible patterns and trying to gather his thoughts. He knows what’s been nagging at him for a couple of days now, but it’s hard to put it into words.
The hellhounds materialize as smoke then flicker and die with an ear-piercing howl. Dean flinches, throwing his arms up to cover his eyes. The howls fade away as a waning death wail; Dean lowers his arms slowly to find Castiel standing over his body, studying his face.
Cas rolls his eyes, wondering if this is another one of Dean’s double-meanings that he doesn’t understand. Dean may as well be allergic to saying anything without piling on five layers of
, which naturally Dean avoids like the black plague despite Cas never going for the ones that would really make his head spin. Were Cas convinced that Dean was done teaching him things about life on Earth, he might even risk getting kicked out for good just to get it off his chest. Were feelings always this heavy, or does he just notice because now he spends his time around Dean 24/7? Dean would probably look hilarious if Cas laid it all on the line, though Cas doubts there’s any room in him to love Dean more. Well, he’s always been in for a penny.
“Oh, right. Well, Krissy says they were talking about finding Metatron,” Dean says. “They mentioned something about a half-snake woman who’s all tuned into the angelic grapevine.”
“Dean,” she says carefully, and the hope in his chest closes up like a big metal door sliding in front of his heart. Dean doesn’t have any room for more disappointment, not tonight, so he just nods.
“You know, I’m still not used to having to come find you,” Dean says, and Cas jumps, turning around. His eyes go wide. Dean ducks through the doorway and inside and scans the ceiling that’s leeching fake light; Dean finally bought those artificial bulbs he needed to let this garden flourish. “I keep finding myself praying. I forget you can’t hear that anymore.”
“It’s none of your business,” Cas snaps when he’s pushed a third time, knocking Dean’s arms out of the way, yanking him in by the jacket and slamming him into the wall hard enough to knock out his breath. “What are
Cas gets closer to him. Man, if there’s one party trick Dean’s got, it’s making him tilt his head just so. That and shooting straight, in various senses of the phrase.
“There’s a brewery tour that I saw last week. On my drive to make a memorial for Meg,” he says, and Dean looks down. “It’s not far from here.”
Most monsters aren’t crafty. Ghouls in particular Dean finds remarkably stupid, even for a bunch of freaks—but he should have remembered Adam and his mother. They could be crafty when it came to family.
“The angels wouldn’t bother cutting off her head. Give me a chance to prove it to you,” says the vampire. “I’ll tell you where I’ll be. You catch even one hint of a slip-up in the area, and I’ll surrender myself to you in an instant. All I want is to be given a second chance. I wasted my first one thinking about her.”
The witch drops him on his ass and whirls around, but she’s too late: Castiel is a mask of pure fury above her. He grabs her face with one hand and she screams, a light burning from inside her outwards. The witch slumps to the floor with her eyes blackened craters. Dean looks up, and when Cas catches his eye his expression cracks right down the middle.
Dean throws the jerky on the couch, slams the bottle on the floor and smacks the side of Cas’s knee.
“OK. I want to show you something.” A smile threatens to overtake him, but as usual he wins over his impulses. “Let me check your leg first.”
She frowns up at him, all theatrics. Her fingers land on his chest and splay. Her nails grazing feel like a threat.
For a moment he can’t make himself climb out of the car. What if she lets him in? Suddenly the thought is just as terrifying as it was comforting. Dean doesn’t know how to live in the suburbs. He doesn’t know how to drive Ben to school or sleep in the same bed as a woman more than two nights in a row or get through a whole day without thinking about Sam. Today he hasn’t even managed to last through one hour.
Cas says, “I don’t know, maybe,” but he does. They watch two Star Wars movies over one big box of chicken lo mein.
Charlie doesn’t wait for him to figure out what the means; she flicks the paper and it sails across the table and hits Cas square in the forehead. While she loses a hold of herself laughing, he levels her one of his patented extra-strength frowns: He’s got plenty of practice putting up with Sam and Dean all day long.
“Yeah…” he says, glancing between all of the angels, trying to judge the best angle of attack to give him a shot at walking out of here. “I just have a few questions I wanna ask you first, you understand. I’m sure Cas would be fine with his friend asking another friend some questions?”
There’s bacon and eggs on the stove and toast on the table; Ben’s digging into a slice overloaded with butter and scribbling in a math workbook. Dean glances at it as he passes by and wrinkles his nose. Long division—Gross.
Around two in the afternoon, the curbside darkens with the roar of an engine right before it cuts off. A door slams. Cas’s ears are tingling with how hard he’s both listening and pretending not to listen, pretending to read the newspaper instead. Maybe these human tics
It’s not bad, mostly because he changes into sweatpants as soon as he gets out. He can feel Cas hovering in the room, though he expected him to make himself scarce awhile ago. Cas never usually lingers this long; and Dean doesn’t want to ask about that in case it makes him go. He licks his lips, glad that Cas is busy pretending to read the old newspaper so he can get dressed because it gives him a little time to get his thoughts together.
“Yes.” Cas crosses his arms. “All of us...all the angels. We’ve had our wings clipped. And my...” He swallows, looks away. “My grace is gone.”
“I—No I did not,” Dean says, holding his finger in the air. “It was on the couch, Cas! And second of all, don’t you start telling them about me—”
He scrubs at his eyes. Checks his maps again the next time he passes a road sign. Just ten miles left, he tells himself. Ten, maybe fifteen minutes until he can turn off the car and stretch his legs and—get something to eat, maybe, he could—He wonders what Lisa has in her fridge. He wonders what Ben looks like now. He wonders if Cicero is as hot this time of year as the outside of Baby was, baking in the afternoon heat all day; like Hell to the touch. Like—
Lisa’s expression cracks down the middle, and she says, “It’s never too late,” and her voice is overloaded with something that Dean can’t take too close a look at.
Whatever’s dark in Dean’s voice clearly startles him, because his eyes get huge and blue. His face gets impossibly stoic when he’s trying to hide something, except for the eyes. Maybe it’s just the fluorescents.
“Of course I do. You’re the most capable hunter I’ve ever known,” Cas says honestly, still not quite getting him. “That doesn’t mean I don’t worry. I now understand how...fragile humans really are. So much can hurt us...”
religiously but only recently started making Dean and Ben deal with it too. Dean knows why, but he doesn’t feel like delving into all of it so he just lets it happen. Then Ben leaves for school and Lisa for work; Dean tries to pull his weight around the house with chores, yardwork, looking for jobs too—he can’t crash there rent-free forever. Ben goes to his room for homework after practice, and Lisa comes home shortly thereafter and gets started on dinner. Dean should probably take over that job for her.
“I know,” she says, stopping him with one hand. “But if you’re staying here, you have to stay here. If you have to go every now and again, then go. Just make sure you come back every time you do.”
“Oh, honey,” she murmurs. She wipes his face dry like he’s a child, even when he grabs her wrists to make it stop. Dean looks up at her. She gives him a smile that says,
“So you’ve like, been to Hell before?” she asks, shoveling rare steak into her mouth without breaking her stare.
“Are you serious?” Dean lights up. “Hell yes! So you’re ready to get educated now? Maybe next weekend we can take a break from building the house, order in, we’ll make a whole movie night out of it. What do you think?”
the same,” Dean says, his cheeks dusky red. Even in the dim afternoon sun coming through the dust-ridden front windows in patches, he glows. Or maybe it’s sweat; Cas still has a keen eye, rose-colored glasses be damned. He’s intelligent enough to know his own weak spots, and Dean is a big one with a bullseye in the middle. “I didn’t know if you could feel things like that. Even as a human.”
“Well yeah, sure. But it seems deeper than that. I don’t know,” Dean says, shaking his head. “You don’t seem very angelic lately, that’s all.”
What’s that running in an undercurrent? Some kind of wobbling. Cas thought his chest was already aching the worst it knew how, but now Dean has to go and get weepy.
“You’re getting kinda heavy for a Saturday afternoon,” Cas says eventually. He yanks Dean down to kiss his shocked, slack lips. “Now get off of me. I want another slice of pizza.”
“I know what guilt looks like, Dean,” he says all haughty, going back to his dinner. “Mmm. Mm! Lisa, this meat is...very good.”
Dean sighs and stops pacing away from him. He comes back slower and stops right in front of Cas, just out of arm’s reach. He doesn’t stop scowling.
Neither of them say anything when he gets there, but Ben won’t quite look at him either. Lisa clears her throat while he spreads a napkin over his lap. She’s finished the steaks for him, and made a side dish, too, on top of the salad.
Cas considers this. He looks down at the fallen angels with a scowl, then back up at Hannah. He nods, raises his weapon, and steps back. The motion subtly plants him between them and Dean.
Dean does not deign to answer. He puts coffee on too, enough for two since Cas likes the taste when it’s got a little caramel in it. He doesn’t have the gas hooked up so it’s hotplate eggs and half-burnt toast again (never steal a toaster from a roadside motel), but he happens to have jam he took from the ‘continental breakfast.’ Cas must have gotten good at Snake over the long night, because it takes him awhile to follow Dean out to the kitchen.
“Sam just informed me of a rumor that we frequent weekend retreats for swingers,” Cas says. “Apparently our sex life is versatile and adventurous.”
“I don’t know,” Dean says, annoyed. He scowls into the corner of Cas’s room, and Cas frowns in the other direction.
“I was coming to see if you still had that Zeppelin tape I gave you,” Dean says. He claps Cas on the shin, though, and keeps it there rubbing circles into his sweats. “And to see what you were doing this afternoon.”
Dean completely forgets what he’s doing with the grill. He actually steps back, splitting into a huge grin as he looks Cas over.
“Dean,” he sighs, exasperated. He shakes his head. “I’m just...I’m really struggling with all of this.”
“I know,” he says, trying to breathe. He watches his hands on the kitchen table. “But I didn’t go looking for this, it came to me.”
And then it’s not just him: It’s Mom, and his dad, and Bobby too, and then others—all of the people he should have but didn’t save. Who he let die for him instead. They start closing in on him, just oozing out of the walls and reaching for him, reaching—He covers his eyes, and this is probably where he starts saying Cas’s name aloud in his sleep, but in the dream he just cowers and—
When he eases the door open, gun at the ready and blood-dipped bronze dagger in the other hand, he mercifully doesn’t come out in the siren’s eyesight. Although he did forget about the mind-reading.
“In the tragic, literary sense of the word, yes, I agree,” Cas says. He looks at Dean. “Although with a much happier ending.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, and he made them drinks but he’s barely had any when he sets the glass down and puts his hand on Cas’s good knee. “Stop talking about the bar and look at me.”
“No,” Cas says finally. He passes the rest of the angels to come stand in front of Dean, as though guarding him from view. His chin lifts. “Dean came through for us today.”
Cas glances up with a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth. Jesus, this guy’s mood swings. Dean’s going to prematurely gray. Fuck the Apocalypse; that was childs’ play compared to knowing Castiel. Ask any angel in Heaven, Dean’s sure they’d all agree.
Dean stammers for something to say, and eventually manages, “That’s pretty archaic thinking there, Cas.”
Dean and Cas both freeze. They look at each other with Dean’s eyebrows climbing higher and higher toward his hairline. Crowley spreads his hands and beams at them as though this is the most simple request in the world.
But the sun dawns, same as it always does. Dean went to bed so early last night that he’s up as soon as it rises, and not just because the birds are really, really loud from out here. Dean opens the padlock on the door and steps out into the early morning sun.
In the ensuing quiet, Dean can’t look him in the eye: He glances at the pavement, then the back wall, then the car. Then back at Cas’s face. He’s just watching Dean. He should get that confused look tattooed on his face, Dean thinks with relish.
“Do not compare us to Hell,” he says, eyes getting all squinty again. “We’re trying to put things back straight. Create a better world order.”
“But this will be your home base,” Dean says thoughtfully, testing out the words. Cas dropping by there for hours at a time and then coming home, instead of the other way around. “Yeah, OK. Let’s try it out.”
“Come on,” Dean says, knocking a knuckle against Cas’s cheek. “You’re good to go. We’ll stop for whiskey on the way home.”
“What are you doing?” Cas asks as though Dean’s the one out of place in this six-row CVS in Bumfuck, Indiana. Dean was born in first aid aisles at the drugstore. He grew up pocketing this shit.
Cas sighs and looks out the window. Dean propels them well down the highway and then over for drive-thru Jack in the Box before Cas so much as looks at him again, and only then because Dean offers him half the fries. They talk quietly while they eat in the parking lot and hold hands on the way to the motel.
“You told me,” Dean reminds him. This time when he tries to loosen Cas’s grip on his shirt, Cas lets him pull free. But his hands linger, covering Cas’s, for a few precious seconds. “You’re becoming human.”
But it’s OK, because as he closes his eyes to draw in a breath, he feels Dean’s shaky on the corner of his chin.
“Yes, actually.” Dean throws his legs off the bed. The floor’s cold to the touch. “Why didn’t you just meet me there?”
Cas’s mouth downturns. He doesn’t look at Dean again while he carefully cleans the wound, checks his stitches haven’t popped out from all Cas’s squinting and smooths the bandage back over. His fingers leave warm trails on his skin. Cas hates fighting with Dean but he still frowns while Dean works, the palms of his hands itching with the need to get out of this kitchen, to go somewhere with a lockable door. As soon as Dean sets his hands on his knees and gives Cas a terse nod, he struggles up, fumbling for his crutches.
Cas’s laugh is sweet as nectar, and the only thing that propels him to his feet and across the room to glorious caffeine.
“I’m sorry I haven’t been working on Sam’s case with you,” Cas says carefully, watching his hand trace patterns onto the bar with his brows pulled together. “I should have been more helpful…”
When Dean ducks inside, the room’s overflowing with blinding light. One angel is standing beside Cas, gripping his arm to keep him upright while he bleeds over the bowl and muttering their spell with him too. Everybody else has abandoned the table. They’re taking defensive blows, all facing the big bundle of light glowing sunshine-golden in the far corner of the room.
Benny slides back into the booth, and Cas grabs one of the beers dangling from his fingers and downs half of it in one go. Benny and Dean look at each other.
As it is, he gets up as fast as he can and slashes the knife, but it doesn’t even make the thing flinch. The ghoul snarls and tackles Dean flat on his back—they hit the grass, rolling around, tussling over the knife when it gets knocked out of his hand. Dean gets a grip on the handle right as the ghoul snags his shirt, dragging him back and underneath it. Dean flips over to find the ghoul snarling and snapping at his face, throws them both sideways and gets his knees bracketing the thing’s ribs and shoves the kitchen knife to its throat, pushes until the blade cuts right through.
Cas and still barely made a dent in Cas’s expression. “We’ll stop for snacks first thing. You can pick out whatever you want.”
Dean digs up some old clothes for Cas to relax in, including another Goodwill t-shirt, this time a baby blue number that says
“Claire and Alex will be staying in the adjacent room,” Cas says, failing to hide how his breath is catching. Dean smiles, fingers creeping more boldly.
Charlie brings along a pack of cards with pictures of wizards instead of numbers and a massive blunt that smells like cinnamon, which she says is “for later.” For now, she brings out an equally impressive bong and a bag of what she assures Cas is “premium kush.”
He finds the special plant food he was looking for and loads it into the cart. Satisfied with the day’s haul, he wheels back around out of the garden center, missing the outdoorsy smell as soon as it’s gone.
But for now, Dean and Sam are drinking those beers and trading stories about their childhoods. Sam likes the one where Dean ditched him all afternoon, acted like a dick and long story short he ended up apologizing and telling him it was them together, them always. They carved their initials into the car that day, just kids. Dean likes that story too, but it’s too sappy to take top spot for him and he always ends it by telling Sam to shut up and when’s he going to change into his skirt, anyway?
He looks up and finds Cas scowling. It’s such a ridiculous look on him—usually he’s just blank, or curious, or confused or even laughing occasionally if Dean’s around—that for a second, Dean nearly breaks. He stifles down the laugh threatening to bubble out.
“Cas…Cas.” Neal snapped his fingers. “This the same Cas who convinced you to move out of that shed that was falling apart?”
