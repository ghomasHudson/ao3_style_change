Stark turns as though he’s only just noticed Steve—and maybe he has. For a split second, perfect surprise is written in every line of his face, but Steve doesn’t have a chance to examine it properly before Stark’s expression hardens and cools, carefully arranged into indifference.
Back in his workshop, Tony’s fixing up his own comparatively minor wounds—slapping a bandage over the cut on the bridge of his nose and wrapping his bruised ribs is nothing when he thinks about what Clint must be going through.
Tony is still frowning, although he looks more bewildered than anything else. He grabs his coffee mug, knuckles white as he grips the handle tightly. “Permission to be dismissed, Captain?” he says, a spark of defiance in his eyes, daring Steve to retaliate.
“Natasha said the rest of the team can handle cleanup,” Steve says. “Apparently they’ve all but finished off the bots.”
“Stop feeling guilty,” he says, and Tony starts. “It wasn’t your fault. And I’ve been to see Clint. He’s stable and already recovering. Do you hear me? He’s
He thinks about it while he’s scrubbing dishes. He thinks about it while he’s out running. He even, sometimes, thinks about it during debriefs. And he thinks about it every damn time he looks at Tony. He’s mortified, unable to help wishing he had just said “screw it” and kissed Tony anyway when they’d been interrupted.
Steve nearly swallows his own tongue, hands automatically going to Tony’s hips. “Tony, I don’t think now is the best time,” he protests, but it sounds weak even to his own ears. “We should really wait until—”
he realizes in a rush, that’s what that feeling had been. A wave of fatigue and something not unlike longing washes over him, and he leans his hip against the counter with a bone-deep sigh, glancing over at the coffee machine, then down at the cup in his hand. He lets his fingertips lightly trail across the chrome surface of the machine, across the button Stark had pressed, but he rarely indulges himself and neither Tony nor coffee should be cause for exception.
The effect this has on his teammate is immediate. Tony’s expression shutters, his face going curiously blank. His grip on his cup slackens, but his shoulders go rigid, his eyes darting away from Steve’s face and fixing on a point just past his shoulder. “Sir, yes, sir,” he says, flatly, and marches past Steve without another word.
When the helmet comes off, Tony blinks up at him, eyes huge and dark, a smear of blood on his forehead. “Cap?”
between them that they each refuse to acknowledge or discuss. It’s possible that it’s just Tony still thinking about it, but he doubts that’s the case.
“Goodnight, Stark.” Steve’s lips are still curled slightly upward when he opens the door and ducks into his room. Tony waits until the door has clicked shut before releasing the air trapped in his lungs, turning on his heel and heading back down to the workshop.
Steve looks unimpressed. “You shouldn’t mix alcohol and prescription medication,” he says sternly, moving forward and gently taking the tumbler from Tony’s hand. He frowns down at it, then sets it aside—out of Tony’s reach—and crosses his arms over his chest. The disapproving look that Tony has been getting less and less lately is back, but even now it’s tinged with something else, something suspiciously like real concern.
Shaking his head, Steve sighs deeply. “Barton and Romanoff were, apparently, betting on how long it would take us to get together,” he says gravely, but the corner of his mouth is twitching.
As he shades the armor with soft, light strokes, it hits him that what he’s trying to capture is the personality that Tony always lends to the suit. Without the man inside, the machinery is beautiful, but dark and lifeless. Steve doesn’t think he’s gotten everything quite right, but for his first time drawing it, he thinks he did a decent job.
Tony’s gaze skitters across Steve’s face, darting away once, twice, before finally settling on a spot just below Steve’s left eye. “Will you let go of me, please?” he mutters through gritted teeth.
Softly, Steve traces the curve of Tony’s lower lip with the pad of his thumb. “Say my name,” he requests, voice a near-whisper, breath warm on Tony’s face.
Tony yelps, nearly dropping the bottle as he whirls around. In his defense, he’s still jumpy from the battle, hopped up on adrenaline, and Steve’s voice has the capacity to set his heart racing even on a normal day. “Christ on a bike, Rogers. What the hell are you doing down here?”
He smiled to himself and began to pet the Colonel in the same way Steve had been doing moments before. Tony leant back in his chair and closed his eyes. As he listened to the low mumbled voice coming from behind the back wall of the shop and the deep purr coming from his lap Tony couldn't help but feel like this was the most content he'd been in years.
Tony braced himself for a possible rejection before turning his arm when a loud yowl startled him upright and away from Steve.
A couple of hours later and the tour was complete. Tony had showed them all how to correctly use their passes, had a quick training session to show the guys how the gym worked, shown Natasha the spa, Bruce his lab and Clint the games room. He'd show them the bedrooms later once the beds finally arrived.
"Ahh now you see, each of these doors leads to a training room suited to the specific persons' fighting style. For example, if Clint were to go through his door, JARVIS would plan and build his battle scenario to better his bow and arrow technique. Whereas if Natasha went through hers JARVIS would change it so she can further her hand to hand style. Clever huh?"
"I honestly don't know Pep. I guess I’ve built up this image of him in my head and now I'm scared to shatter that by finding out that maybe he’s actually a huge racist, homophobic, misogynistic prick. Or perhaps even worse, he could be exactly like I've imagined, send my heart into overdrive and I'll keel over at his feet." Tony rambled out, placing his head in his hands.
Resting the urge to sneeze, he reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet and StarkPhone. He sent an urgent pick-up request to Happy and pinged his location across before getting a couple of notes out of his wallet to cover the coffee.
It was amazing how Pepper could scare him even when she was miles away and not physically in his presence. "I think we're getting off subject here. What i'm looking for is a solution to how all of us are going to survive tonight with no heating and no beds." Tony swore he could hear Pepper smirking on the other end of the phone.
"Right Stark, I'm gonna give you clearance for this, however, any sign of trouble and I'm pulling them out of there. I need my two best agents alive and sane."
Tony relaxed as the chest underneath him shook from laughter and looked over to see Natasha wink at him before closing her eyes. He'd question the wink in the morning but for now he was too tired and too comfortable to question it.
"Snow, yes. The vans got stuck in this 40 miles out, there's no way they can get the beds to you tonight."
"Naturally, and you'll have a training room, enough bedrooms for you all to have two each if you want, a lounge for all of us, a spa, some-" Tony was cut short by a soft gasp from Natasha.
"Ok well first things first, here are your keys." Tony announced as Pepper passed over the five 'keys'. Each one was the same size as credit cards, with the Avenger logo, the holders name and a grey square in the corner of the card printed on.
A twinge of anger—not irritation this time, but real anger, tinged with something else that’s even more infuriating than usual—brings a hot flush to the back of Steve’s neck. And normally he doesn’t take the bait when Stark goads him, normally he restrains himself, but he’s so off-balance and so frustrated that this time, he bites.
“Here,” he says, and opens his sketchbook. He carefully shields it as he leafs through the pages, and Tony has the decency to not try and look. When Steve flips to the most recent page, the one with the drawing of Iron Man, he carefully tears it out and hands it to Tony. “I want you to have this.”
But there are rare occasions that Steve wins their verbal sparring matches. The worst offender is one morning in the kitchen. He hasn’t slept in two days, easy, and is pushing three when he finally emerges from his workshop in search of more coffee. As he climbs the stairs, he reasons that it’s early enough in the morning that everyone else is still asleep, or they’ve already cleared out, but as luck would have it, Captain fucking America himself is sitting at the kitchen table, sipping coffee out of a black-and-white patterned mug. Tony makes a valiant effort to ignore him, but it’s no use.
But if Tony’s a sadist, he’s also apparently got a masochistic streak in there somewhere, because when he and the good Captain fight, it
Steve is shocked into stillness for an instant. Then he snaps into action, knocking a Doombot aside with his shield and barking into his comms, “Iron Man’s down. I’m going after him; can everyone hold up all right?”
Tony whips around at the sound of Steve’s voice in his ear, shooting a blast from his palm repulsor at the giant wasp—giant
His gaze drops to Tony’s mouth, and Tony lets out a tiny, involuntary noise—whether of fear or of want, he isn’t sure. Steve leans a fraction of an inch closer, and Tony’s lips part, his lids fluttering shut, and—
“Thanks.” Steve smiles softly, and crosses to the beat-up red couch that slumps against the wall of the workshop. From this angle, he sees Tony in profile, and quickly gives into the temptation to warm up by sketching him. It’s more of a suggestion of outlines than anything else, a few lines doing the job of depicting the slope of Tony’s nose, the shadow of his facial hair across his jaw, the column of his throat and the way the muscles bunch in his wiry arms.
They get into it, practically nose-to-nose as they so often are when Tony provokes him, and then Cap just… goes silent. He’s still glaring, sort of, but the lines on his forehead smooth out, eyes softening and roaming over his face with a disconcerting intensity. Tony’s stomach twists, fluttering in a way that, while not exactly unpleasant, is entirely unwelcome. He’s not one to back down from a fight, but for some reason in that moment he wants nothing more than to run away, to escape from the weight of those blue, blue eyes that seem to pin him in place. The worst part, he thinks, his heart beating double-time against the arc reactor in his chest, the worst part is that Rogers doesn’t seem angry anymore; instead, Tony has the intense and invasive feeling of being truly seen.
Tony’s impulsiveness, his disrespect, his disregard for others, and his seemingly absolute lack of capability to follow to orders—those were all aggravating, but they were things that could be dealt with. Now, though, following first that morning in the kitchen and then the night when Tony had found him in the gym… now, Steve’s problem has taken on an entirely new shape.
Sure, it’s been weeks since the Battle of New York, since everything happened on the Helicarrier and the mess with Loki got cleaned up, but if Tony Stark knows how to do one thing, it’s hold a grudge. He can hardly stomach living in the same
It takes them a moment to get their balance—Tony has only lifted Steve like this a handful of times—and by the time he drops Steve at Clint’s location, they’re almost too late. Right as Tony lands, Clint gets stung and goes down, and from there it’s a mad rush to get him back to the quinjet for medical treatment while trying to keep from getting hit themselves. Tony gets beat around a little, but nothing actually punctures the armor.
When he leaves the workshop a few hours later to actually get some sleep for once, the bottle remains untouched.
It appears to do the trick. Cap gets annoyed, sure, the Frown of Disapproval (Tony wants to get that term trademarked) settling over his face, but he doesn’t seem genuinely angry like he had that morning. And he doesn’t call Tony “Mr. Stark” again. Tony counts it as a win for the good guys.
With an artist’s eye, picking out details as he renders them in bold, delicate lines, Steve can truly appreciate the beauty of the suit, the genius of its creator evident in its design. It isn’t as though Steve hasn’t noticed before—of
Steve has a problem. And his problem comes in the form of a handsome, sharp-tongued billionaire superhero by the name of Tony Stark.
Tony lashes out— “Permission to be dismissed, Captain?” —but he’s not expecting the way Cap’s face falls. Hurt, disappointment, regret—all flicker across his face in the briefest of seconds, before his brow furrows again. And anger Tony can deal with, anger and irritation and frustration are the things he expects from the captain, the things he knows. Rogers being angry is familiar to him. Or so he thinks.
Tony blinks owlishly at him, lips parting in surprise, and it’s comical and a little bit adorable. To his credit, he recovers quickly, if a bit gracelessly, lifting one shoulder in a shrug. “Sure thing. Knock yourself out.” He turns back to his work, though Steve notices the way his gaze lingers a little.
“Tony,” Steve says, just to watch Tony swallow his own words, just to watch his lashes flutter. He loves the way Tony’s name rolls off his tongue, hard at the start and soft on its way to the end.
Tony mimics in a surprisingly good imitation of his tone, and his mouth is a soft curve that makes Steve’s heart pound a little harder when Tony shifts closer and places his hand on Steve’s chest. “You’re so sexy when you’re mad at me. Really makes me want to kiss you.”
now, never mind the fact that Stark’s grimace is slowly fading into a vaguely uncomfortable scowl. Because now that he’s noticed the dark circles under Stark’s dark, cognac eyes, he can’t help but notice other things, too, like how incredibly long his eyelashes are, and the smattering of barely-there freckles on his nose, and how has he never seen these things before?
The suit falls to pieces around Tony, and he sits up, takes Steve’s face in his hands, and presses their mouths together.
With that, he smiles at Tony one last time before slipping out of the workshop, leaving the other man speechless and blushing and clinging to the drawing with slightly trembling fingers.
Steve’s attention shifts across the room, to where the Iron Man suits are on display. He flips to a clean page and pauses for a moment, resting the tip of his pencil lightly against the pristine white paper as he debates on how to begin. Slowly, he draws the curve of the top of the helmet, brow furrowing as he concentrates, world narrowing to the simple
Tony’s personality is larger than life, all energy and brilliance and arrogant, sarcastic wit packed into a surprisingly compact frame with a glowing heart and big, expressive eyes. Everything he does is in present tense; he demands attention and holds the world in the palm of his hand so easily. Tony never seems uncomfortable in the spotlight—in fact, he always seems to revel in it, commanding everyone to
Rogers leans his head on Tony’s shoulder, face against Tony’s neck. His hands are still in his lap, knuckles white under the loosened wrapping as he clenches his fists. Tony has the overwhelming, irrational urge to kiss his forehead and protect him, which is laughable at best. Captain America doesn’t need protecting.
Steve lets Tony help him into the elevator, silence heavy over their heads as it goes up, and they make it as far as Steve’s hallway before they stop. “I think I’m good from here,” Steve says, voice hoarse and quiet. It’s the first time he’s spoken since greeting Tony in the gym, what feels like hours ago.
There’s a conspicuous pause, then Natasha lets out a faint sigh, one that closely resembles a chuckle.
Clint interrupts dryly. He sounds strained, but he’s clearly alive enough to snark at them, so Tony isn’t too concerned.
SHIELD medical has, somehow, managed to send him pain pills, the bottle of which is currently sitting innocuously on Tony’s desk. Steve’s doing, no doubt. Tony glares at the bottle, but pops two pills anyway, swallows them dry and then reaches for his tumbler of whiskey to wash them down.
Pursing his lips, Steve just glares at him, turning his damp mug in his hands. “Stark,” he says tiredly, resisting the urge to roll his eyes or massage his temples. “This is your house. You can go wherever you want.”
That tiny detail, the physical evidence of Stark’s exhaustion, is captivating. It’s… humanizing, in a way, making Stark seem almost smaller than usual. Steve’s only half-aware that he’s outright
The universe is full of surprises, apparently, because the Captain barks at him, “Permission granted, Mr. Stark.”
A nod, and Steve starts to pull away. Tony scrambles to his feet, wincing at the twinge in his knees, and offers his hand. Steve just looks at it for a second, as though he doesn’t quite process why it’s there, before understanding flickers across his face and he reaches up to take it. Tony is ninety-nine percent sure that he isn’t actually helping so much as letting Steve pull himself up using Tony as leverage, but he’s on his feet, and that’s what matters.
Tony's stomach flutters as Steve turns to approach him. The intense look of concentration on Steve's face falls away to fondness in a split second. Giddiness makes him pick up his speed until he's right in front of Steve, who greets him with a peck on the lips. He hopes Steve’s enhanced ears can’t pick up the sound of his heart racing.
Tony shook his head. “It’s not the same. Long distance is hard even with things like Skype to help ease the distance. Steve, I…I really want to work things out with Pepper, I
If his father were to listen to what he had to say, Steve had to play by his rules. As much as it pained him, he carried his new eagle-pommeled sword and had the stablehands saddle the snowy white palfrey for today’s hunt. He hoped his father would consider it a sign of goodwill.
It wasn't surprising, given their history. During the war, they had taken prisoners of war and conducted all kinds of horrific experiments on them. As far as he knew, only one made it out alive, if you could even call it living. James "Bucky" Barnes had survived HYDRA's experiments only to be subjected to a worse kind of torture.
Steve's thumb traces the outline of Tony's mouth and pushes at Tony's bottom lip. Steve gasps when Tony parts his lips and takes Steve's thumb into his mouth. He recovers quickly, pressing his thumb deeper into Tony's mouth. The salt of Steve's flesh coats his tongue, but for once, Tony feels like the hunter.
The sound of children squealing pulls him from his thoughts and brings a smile to his face. Carmen had spared no expense, not that he expected any less, as he takes in the Tilt-a-Whirl lifting its arms higher and higher. The riders throw their arms up in the air, their laughter carrying on the wind. For today, they would get to fly too.
"Thank you," Tony says, massaging his temple, trying to stop his stress headache before it begins."It's like having children."
She rolls her eyes, but it's all in good fun. "Well, then, I'm happy for you. You deserve all the love that comes your way."
His mind went back to his earlier thought. Maybe he was dead and this was Hell and he was going to be forced to watch everyone he loved die over, and over, and
“Suddenly they were the only thing I was making,” Tony finished. “Until this,” he said, gesturing all around him. “Until Iron Man. Until this team.”
Their faces were close, and for a moment, Tony thought Steve might have kissed him despite what Tony had just done. Tony looked into Steve’s eyes and there was earnestness there. Earnestness and lust and something he didn’t dare try to name. But…if Steve was willing to try…
That defuses the tension in the room, just a bit. Bruce lets out a light chuckle while Natasha just rolls her eyes.
He had never told anyone of his inclinations, not even Bucky. Obviously, he had not been as subtle as he intended. He shuddered to think of what would happen if his father ever confronted him.
There had only been one lady; Lady Carter. Steve had courted her only for her to end up betrothed to another man. He had given them his blessing, but it had still hurt to be pushed to the wayside like he was nothing. Like he was nobody.
It wouldn’t be long before both of them fell over the edge. His heart hammered so loud he swore he could hear it in his ears. His cock throbbed, aching for release.
Tony and Sam and Bucky. He missed waking up and actually feeling like he had belonged somewhere. Maybe he would always be the man out of time. He wasn’t the same man who had put the Valkyrie in the ice all those years ago, nor did he think he was the same man who had stepped on that platform merely a month ago.
—that it meant he wouldn’t fall ill ever again. Steve had far too many memories of lying in hospital beds, hacking up his lungs or burning with fever and even more memories of refusing treatment altogether just so he and Bucky could make that month’s rent. The promised healing factor wasn’t the only reason Steve had agreed to the procedure but it sure did play a part in his decision. He remembered thinking that he wouldn’t be a burden anymore. That he could help people without his body holding him back. But it seemed like the serum couldn’t cure everything.
Tony’s kisses had stolen his breath along with his sense, it seemed. His breath echoed in Steve’s ears, and a savage satisfaction filled him at the sound. Tony was breathless because of him.
“Okay, first of all, hard assery is most definitely not a word,” Steve retorted. “And second, I like you too.” Steve placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder and lowered his voice, “I know you like it here but Tony, you love Pepper don’t you?”
Tony’s brain short-circuited. One more word out of Steve’s mouth and he was going to come all over his desk. Years ago, Tony would have felt ashamed at how much he wanted Steve, how much he begged. Tiberius Stone and Sunset Bain had made sure of that. But Steve was different; he teased Tony because Tony
Steve hums and wraps his arms around Tony’s waist like he’s afraid Tony’s going to vanish into thin air. “Good,” he says and presses a kiss to Tony’s neck.
“Mr. Stark, Agent Hill is requesting entrance to your workshop,” JARVIS interrupts them before Rhodey can further interrogate him.
Steve has a beard now, Tony thinks idly, watching the other man from across the patio. Dark brown hair hides a jaw so defined as if an artist had spent years painstakingly crafting it out of marble. He’s wearing a Yankees cap, and oh that must
If anyone's still reading choke on me at this point, thank you so much for your support, it truly means a lot to me 💖💖
Tony’s eyes shot open as he flipped over in his bed. He was sweaty and shaky from the dream but nothing filled him with more terror in that moment than seeing the Mark 42 poised over Pepper, ready to strike. Tony rolled out of the bed, gesturing with his hands and shouted, “Power down.”
Tony jumped up and whirled around, dropping the gauntlet and the screwdriver he had been holding. “Jesus,” he mumbled, his voice all tight and hoarse. “You scared the shit out of me.”
Tony hums and spends the rest of the dinner teasing Steve like his life depends on it. Although Natasha and Clint stare pointedly at each other from time to time, the others don't say anything. Tony wouldn't be surprised if those two had a telepathic connection with each other.
“Captain,” the woman was kneeling next to him now, placing her gentle hands upon his shoulders. “I can fix this if you will let me.”
Even though he knew what to expect from Tony's kiss, the moment their lips touched still left him gasping. Tony's lips were just as soft as they were the night before. Soft and sweet and maddening.
"No, no, I'm not saying that." Her eyes flit back and forth between him and Steve. Clint's waiting by the elevators with his arms crossed over his chest. "Just don't make a mess."
It seemed like after his panic attack, the flood gates had opened and everything he had been pushing to the back of his mind to deal with later, decided
“Yeah,” Tony says, clutching a pillow to his chest. He’s currently staying at one of his vacation homes on the Amalfi coast. His bedroom has a perfect view of the sea. Every evening, he sits out on his balcony and tries not to think about how Steve’s eyes are the exact color of the Mediterranean at sunset.
Tony's dream comes to him unbidden. Everything plays out the way it had in real life; the sonic device
On one such upstroke, when Tony dipped his tongue into Steve’s slit, Steve lost what little control he had left.
Tony doesn’t know how they end up here. One moment, Tony was damn near shouting at Steve for everyone to see, each word more filled with hurt and rage than the last, and the next Steve was looking at him with those ocean eyes of his and they were off. It wasn’t hard finding the nearest motel, Tony throwing a handful of bills at the counter, standing around impatiently while the concierge handed Steve the keys. Tony barely got a chance to survey their room before Steve was on him, lips rough and insistent against his.
The summer seemed to zoom past him, June bleeding into July and July into August. It was late one evening in the tower, he and Bruce had been making dinner together (chicken tikka masala this time) that Steve realized he had been in the past for three months. He had froze in the midst of chopping onions, his hands stopping in mid-air like a still-life. A tsunami of grief and guilt slammed Steve, sinking deep into his blood, his bones, his very being. For three
“So you look for the next best thing,” Steve finishes. “The staff. They’re using Loki’s staff to make super-soldiers or something close.”
To be fair, Tony doesn’t remember. All he remembers is basking in the fact that Rhodey’s parents actually seemed to
With flour in his hair and sticky palms, Tony launches himself at Jarvis who finds his arms full of dirty, sticky, boy-genius. Jarvis has never been happier.
Once again comments, kudos, and bookmarks aren't necessary but they're much appreciated and let me know what you guys want to see more of, less of, etc. Thanks again for reading and see you soon (hopefully 👀).
But then the nuke reached the ship. The blast couldn’t be heard in the cold vacuum of space. But it sure as hell could be
“Didn’t touch myself,” Tony panted. He could barely get the words out, but he managed to get his message across. “Wanted...wanted to wait for you.”
There was a twinkle in her eye. “No one has called me anything but the ‘Ancient One’ for nearly 600 years.”
Elena looked younger than 24 with her round face and big blue eyes. She was smiling in the picture, showing off a tiny gap between her two front teeth.
Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck. “And I’m perfectly fine with that.” Before Tony even knew what was happening, Steve had spun his chair around to face him and pulled Tony into his lap. Tony yelped at the sudden movement, his hands automatically flying to Steve’s chest to brace himself. “Steve!”
He’s clutching at Steve’s shoulders like his life depends on it and Steve’s hands settle onto Tony’s waist, hot against his skin like brands. Tony bites down on Steve’s lips, hard enough to draw blood on an ordinary man, but just enough pressure to have Steve groaning. They crumple to the bed together like rocks tumbling to meet the sea. They make quick work of their clothes, tugging and pawing at each other like they’re teenagers until they’re completely bared to one another. Steve with his hair mussed and chest bared and eyes burning like coals is like something out of one of his teenage fantasies when his appreciation for Captain America went far beyond hero worship.
Before Tony could snap something back, JARVIS had called Happy for him. “I’ll deal with you later,” Tony said.
It's a far cry from the "aw, shucks" wholesome Irish Catholic mask Steve dons, but Tony shouldn't be too surprised. This is the same man who got him off at the dinner table. And the shower. And the helicarrier.
Steve never finishes his sentence as Tony's tongue slinks into his mouth. Steve moans, kissing him back. One of his hands finds Tony's cock. Tony bucks into his fist, still slick with lube, digs his nails into Steve's back until they're both falling apart. Steve comes inside him with a muffled groan, filling him with a wet heat; meanwhile, Tony feels like his brain is leaking from his ears as his come spurts from his cock and paints both of their stomachs in white.
Tony’s hairs stand on the back of his neck. The boardroom is charged with all kinds of tension, ready to boil over. They can’t blame themselves. If they start blaming themselves, they’ll never get anything meaningful done.
The elevator doors have barely closed on them before Steve's boxed him into a corner, his arms braced on either side of Tony. "That wasn't nice," he says. There's a tilt to his lips, so Tony knows he's not actually mad.
That’s when he starts collecting Avengers like a kid collecting those little trading cards when Tony was in college. Digimon? Pokémon? It was something that ended in -mon, he was sure of that.
Tony frowned up at him, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “I’m gonna take a nap. But only because I want to. And I think you actually will sit on me.”
“Tony,” Steve began, stepping deeper into the room. “I don’t think it’s just the gauntlet that’s giving you trouble.” He motioned to the whiskey bottle. “You’re drinking in the workshop. You never drink in the workshop.”
He sits next to Steve and directs him to the search bar on the app. Their heads are bent close together, and this close, Tony can smell the remnants of his cologne—lemon and pepper and sycamore—until he's dizzy with it.
Instead, she had put on a record, held out her hand, and asked him to dance. And what could Steve do but say yes?
And at the back of his mind, Steve had a niggling thought that the mission was also starting to take a physical toll on him as well. His movements were slow and sluggish and he felt the beginnings of a migraine building in his temples which shouldn’t have even been
“You’re lovely,” he finally said, his face burning. He drank from his goblet to cover himself. Tony paused mid-sip, his skin tinged pink in the firelight. Steve had made him blush. A primal part of him he hadn’t even known existed purred in satisfaction. He wondered if anyone else had managed to make him blush, if
Steve had an awful, nauseating feeling that if he were to reach out to the left of him, his hands would come into contact with the hilt of Loki’s scepter.
Steve blushes, but it's all in good fun. Thor, of course, breaks the game, the bell flying clean off the top of the tower. The game runner in awe (and a little bit of fear) gives Thor a prize regardless. Tony promises to compensate the man as soon as possible. Despite all of that, his headache has receded slightly. He needs to eat
Somehow, Steve found the nerve to speak to her without breaking down crying. He wasn’t sure if this was Hell or Heaven or something
. But Steve Rogers was a good man. So he would complete the mission, return to the 21st century, and try to move on from there.
Tony spent the rest of the afternoon locked up in his workshop doing what he did best; inventing. And avoiding his problems. But mainly inventing.
“The Accords were wrong,” Steve says, a muscle in his jaw working and Tony wants to slap him. The only thing keeping him from backhanding the other man is the risk of breaking something. He should slap him anyway.
Steve’s hands hesitate at his sides before he wraps Tony up in his arms, the full heat of his body engulfing Tony. He melts into Steve’s side, letting a sigh of contentment escape. There’s no sound but the sound of their breathing melding together; Tony’s bedroom might as well be on another planet, he and Steve, the sole occupants. It’s a comfortable silence, one that Tony doesn’t feel the need to fill for once with inane chatter. For the first time in years, he feels safe. He feels loved.
Steve and Natasha show up with Clint right behind them. They’re still healing from their injuries, but overall they’re okay. Aside from dumping hundreds of SHIELD/HYDRA’s secrets onto the world wide web.
Tony hunched in on himself, his vision whiting out. Steve held onto him for dear life like he wanted to sink into Tony’s skin.
Tony's glad the Avengers are helping him out, honestly. It's just...the thought of six Avengers...around young, impressionable children…
The Red Skull smiled, a grim, bitter thing. “Do you think I would still be here if I could lie, Steven?”
Look at me being somewhat consistent. In case you didn't read my first note, I'm tentatively setting a goal to have Chapter 5 up by February 7 at the latest. Feel free to yell at me if it takes longer than that.
. Tony never missed movie night these days, not even after spending entire nights the day before in his workshop. He’d always show up, even if he ended up falling asleep five minutes into the movie, his head lolling onto Steve’s shoulder. Steve had an awful feeling those nights were the only times Tony actually got sleep.
“We also deserve a day off,” Barton says. “At least I do. I don’t know about the rest of you slackers.”
"So sensitive," Tony murmured. "I wonder what would happen if I did this…." Instead of just licking, Tony took the head of Steve's cock into his mouth. Steve's free hand shot out from his side and fisted into Tony's hair.
“It’s okay,” he says, and he means it. Because Pepper is still his and he’s still hers, just not in the way they had originally wanted.
"Game plan. Right. We're here to work." Carmen clears her throat, a flush still staining her cheeks, and flips through some of the pages on her clipboard. "Okay, Tony, you're easy. You're running the basketball booth."
Whatever pain Rumlow had inflicted upon that poor girl had been given to him tenfold. His injuries had healed eventually. All aside from the raised scar in the shape of a spider emblazoned across his cheek. Rumlow never said outright who had done him in, but the spider made it all too obvious; it was Madam Natalia’s sigil. King Joseph had been furious, but without Rumlow's cooperation, he couldn’t persecute Brooke’s most well-respected brothel owner unless he wanted a revolt led by all of the menfolk in the capital out calling for his head.
Steve’s head was beginning to hurt. His younger self’s conscience had disappeared entirely along with his future body…did he kill himself?
All chaos had broken out with Rhodey then teaming up with Steve to damn near try to drown Tony in ketchup.
Steve has his phone on him, and Tony gets him to download Instagram easy enough. In two years, Steve's caught on quickly to 21st-century technology. Giving him a StarkPhone had gone surprisingly well, with the other man taking it from Tony with a gracious smile that had Tony averting his eyes.
He rises out of his seat and grabs the few dishes that remain. Tony helps Steve load up the dishwasher. He tries not to think about how domestic it all feels, how it's practically become routine for Tony and Steve to look after the others and put away their dishes. He doesn't know what it means, but he has the strangest feeling that Pepper is smiling to herself halfway across the country.
Aldrich Killian was the founder and CEO of Advanced Idea Mechanics or AIM, a scientific research and development organization. And, as Tony zoomed in on a picture of him, was very handsome. His face was long and square, but not overly so, avoiding the horse-like look less than fortunate people with long faces had. His dirty blond hair was long but neat, a single strand falling into his clear blue eyes. He was smiling in the picture but something about it didn’t sit right with Tony. His smile…it didn’t reach his eyes. Tony didn’t fault the man, though. Tony’s own smiles never seemed to feel real in photographs either.
“Cap, I swear on Isaac Newton’s grave, I’m not catching you the next time you jump off a building without a parachute.”
Tony was to blame, too, for his absence. He could admit that. He had just thought, after everything that had happened between them, Steve would have been right by his side—not spending every waking moment fighting an invisible enemy.
couldn’t make Tony light up like that, but a bigger part couldn’t help but burst with love and happiness at the sight of Tony’s happiness. He’d take a happy,
He lets go of Tony's cock, but Tony has no time to beg because he's lining himself up with Tony's entrance.
"Tell me," Tony finds himself saying. Steve's working his fingers in and out of Tony now, searching, searching…
Rhodey’s lips quirk up ever so slightly into a smile, and then he’s gone, plunging Tony’s workshop into near silence. He finds himself looking forward to Rhodey's leave. It’ll be good to see him, take his mind off of everything.
"One more thank you, and you're going to rupture my eardrum," he says, holding his phone to his ear. He's making breakfast, which for him consists of swiping a yogurt cup and spoon from the kitchen.
The next time Tony cooks, it’s on a plane halfway to California from Monaco. Pepper sits across from him, regal and golden in the sun’s rays parting through the clouds.
“He loved you,” she murmured, her voice softer than he had ever heard it. “He always loved you, even when you fought. And trust me, I would know.”
One of the volunteers lowers the bar over their heads, making sure that they're secure, and that's it. Tony's trapped. He's stuck on this Ferris wheel for the next ten minutes, and Steve is so goddamn
“Three,” Tony said. “You’re doing good, Steve. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s not real. You’re at home.”
“Hey, girl,” Tony had said, running a hand across the bike’s handlebars as if it were a startled horse. “Let’s see if I can fix you up.”
weren't nice," Tony counters. Steve rests his hands on Tony's hips, a stance of theirs that's quickly becoming one of Tony's favorites. He'd die before he'd admit it out loud, but he likes the size difference between him and Steve. Especially when the other man is leaning down to kiss him.
They both curse, Tony at the change in angle, the lightning in his blood, Steve at Tony's sudden tightness, and Steve fucks into him in earnest.
“Banner’s got a point,” Romanov says. “I want him to pay, just as much as you,” she admits. “But how would we even go about punishing a
“Not you, too,” Tony said, then narrowed his eyes. “Despite the sleep deprivation and the fact that I’ve eaten nothing but smoothies for the past 24 hours, I’m 99.9 percent sure you’ve never even come up to the penthouse before. And you haven’t called me, ‘Stark’ which is double weird. Are you here to yell at me?”
the Time Stone should seldom be used. I assume whatever device you created operates under the same rules.”
"What? No!" He says, raising his hands. Hell hath no fury like a Pepper scorned. "I'm here, in the flesh. I just got...distracted. I guess I haven't really taken a day for myself."
The same terror grips him, that awful feeling of weightlessness and pressure all at once. He barely registers the shouts of the others over the comms before his sense finally kicks in, and he deploys the flaps meant to slow his fall.
“Did you enjoy your birthday, sire?” Dugan asked when their ribbing of Bucky had lost some of its initial fun. “That sword of yours is a beauty.”
Mark 42 slumped over and for good measure, Tony struck the suit in the chest, causing it to fall to pieces.
“That’s what you are, aren’t you? You’re my bitch, aren’t you sweetheart?” Steve insisted, stroking himself harder. The wet slapping sounds of flesh on flesh were deafening in the otherwise silent office.
He grimaced, the thought of doing his duty souring the swig of wine in his mouth. Now that he was of age, he
“I learned from the best,” JARVIS sniffed. “Mr. Stark himself can be quite persuasive when he wants to be.
“Good boy,” Steve said softly like he meant it. Feeling his cheeks grow hot, Tony glanced down, unable to meet Steve’s gaze. “Oh, it’s too late to be shy. I think we’re past that, don’t you?”
“How about a nice vibrating cock ring, hmm? Slip it on you early in the morning. Maybe a long-distance remote to go with it, keep you hard and ready all day long.”
“You’d like that wouldn’t you? Sitting under my desk all day doing what you do best; warming my cock.” Steve said, his voice little more than a rasp at this point. His words had dark chills going through Tony as if someone had poured ice water down his back.
She reminded him of Peggy in the best way possible. She had her wit and this deep inner strength to her that Steve had only encountered one other time in his life.
When Steve gets up to leave, part of Tony wants to reach out his hand and pull him back to bed. Like Steve’s a sailor lost at sea and Tony’s the lighthouse meant to bring him home. But Tony’s light is broken and Steve…he’s convinced Steve doesn’t want to come back to shore. So Tony watches as Steve gets dressed, pulls up his pants and throws his shirt over his head. Standing there in his disguise from earlier, Steve looks and feels like a complete stranger. Steve stands at the edge of the doorway and their eyes meet for a split second. He looks like he wants to say something to him. Tony wants to grab him by the shoulders and shake him, kiss him, scream at him, or all three at once.
Tony’s a whirlwind, flitting from one pot to the other putting Steve in the mind of a little hummingbird flying from flower to flower in search of nectar.
Steve also looks disappointed, his shoulders dropping. “Whatever it is, it must be important. Raincheck?”
They settled back into the easy rhythm until AJ said, “Time’s up! Now there’s two ways we can do this. We can either do a round robin, if you guys are comfortable with sharing with each other. Or,” she looked around, “I can meet with all of you privately so we can discuss your work.”
"We're sticky," he says against Steve's lips and wriggles his hips. Steve pulls away from him and glances down, observing the mess they’ve made of each other; Their come and the lube is starting to dry on Tony's skin, leaving it tacky.
"I just want peace," Tony had said when he had given him his shield. "Turns out resentment is corrosive."
“I—I,” Steve stuttered. What could he even say? That he came from a timeline where a genocidal maniac wiped out half of all sentient life? That he and the Avengers had
Tony mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like “Stupid super-soldiers and their stupid enhanced strength,” but he closed his eyes nonetheless, his long dark lashes casting shadows on his hollow cheeks. In what seemed like mere seconds, Tony’s breath evened out and Steve knew that he had truly fallen asleep. He really
He can't help but chuckle to himself. Talking to Carmen was always so fun. She had the same (admittedly dorky) sense of humor as him. He remembered the days when they sat in the back of their homeroom, laughing at each other's stupid jokes over the morning announcements while their teacher gave them death glares. They kept in touch after graduation but not enough for Tony's tastes.
“My apologies, sir,” JARVIS said dryly, or as dryly as an AI’s voice could be. “Would you like me to shout it next time?”
Rhodey stays. Rhodey stays and Tony flourishes under his attention like a long forgotten toy finally being picked up and played with again. He stays when Tony takes too long getting ready in the morning.
"Hmm," he says and kisses him softly this time. It's been so long since Tony's been touched with tenderness. Steve moans into his mouth, and his arms come back up, perched on Tony's waist.
While leaving the building after his second therapy session, Steve found a dog. Not just any dog; he was sure it was the cutest dog in all of New York.
Their skin is tacky with sweat and lube, and the clean-up will be awful, but Tony doesn't care as the reality of the day hits him. Tony almost
Rumlow grumbled something under his breath before stalking over to the other side of the clearing where Steve’s father and his advisers stood.
Peter, seemingly uncaring of his master’s physical condition, went about things like usual, chattering all the way.
soldier,” Steve had said. “No one ever sees me for me. And I’m thankful for the super serum and the chance it gave me to do good but,” Steve hesitated. “I wish people saw me for me. Not some untouchable ideal man.”
Tony looked down, slowly taking a seat on the nearest work bench. “Cap, I’ve been asking myself that for years.”
day. Despite not having spent the day fighting off an alien invasion with the others, he figured his brush with death by migraine more than made up for it. He was ready to curl up on the nearest relatively soft object and go to sleep for another seventy years. Only the sight of his teammates kept him awake, but just barely.
He doesn't know how long they've been in the shower, but the water is starting to run cold, which is a feat within itself. Steve swallows around him, and Tony's coming down his throat with a shout. Steve moans around him, not letting up on him for a second until Tony has to physically push him away. He's never come so hard in his life and never within such a short period of time in between.
It’s movie night because they have those now, and their little group is bigger than normal. Pepper, Rhodey, and Sam have all made an appearance. Pepper and Rhodey were at the tower for Stark Industries business and stayed around longer than necessary to check in on Tony, much to his visible delight. Sam had come to visit Steve (and check out the tower. Steve was sure any day now, Sam would accept their offer and officially join the team) and had a few more days before it was time for him to go back to D.C.
God, Steve’s eyes were practically black now, his irises stretched into a thin ring. Steve slipped two fingers into Tony’s mouth, Tony parting his lips with no hesitation. Steve’s fingers, like the rest of him, were big, stretching Tony’s lips. Tony sucked obediently, his tongue licking at the space in between Steve’s fingers before trailing back up to circle the tips. When Steve pulled his fingers away, they left a trail of saliva running down Tony’s chin.
,” Steve growled, his words slurring together. “M’gonna fill you up. Get you so fucking wet and open, I could just slide in whenever I want.”
For a moment, Tony didn't say anything, and Steve wanted to shovel his words back into his mouth. He was so stupid! Why should Tony care about any of Steve's so-called problems?
Tony’s face lights up and Jarvis can practically see the little wheels in his head turning. Even with all that he had accomplished in his short life so far, Jarvis will perhaps forever be in awe at how fast the boy’s mind goes, Tony often jumping to (usually correct) conclusions in mere seconds when it took grown men hours to put the pieces together.
Steve lifts his head from Tony's throat, and Tony brings him down for a kiss. They exchange languid, sweet kisses like they have all the time in the world. They don't. They don't because HYDRA's back and worse than ever, and Tony knows down to the marrow in his bones that there's something else on the horizon. Something ruthless and out for
Steve’s lips are on his again. He can’t get enough of Tony today, it seems. His tongue slips into Tony’s mouth, one of his hands running down his chest and into his pants. Tony arches into his touch, moaning into Steve’s mouth. Steve may be a thief, but in this moment, Tony is just as willing to give him everything he has.
“If not a therapist, than at least a support group of some sort,” she said. “Pity, there isn’t a support group for superheroes.”
Returning the Aether had been harder than he had expected. Nobody had told him he had needed to inject the stone back into Jane, and the look of surprise on both their faces at the realization would have been hysterical under literally any other circumstances. Putting the Power stone back into the orb had been easier. He had arrived just as Quill, had landed on the storm battered rock that was Morag singing along (badly) and dancing to his music. In a way the man had reminded him of Tony, and what little amusement he had experienced died just that quickly.
Tony, sensing a fight brewing, raises his hands in defense. “Not to replicate. It just doesn’t make sense.”
him to. It was something they both got off on, not a thinly veiled excuse to break down Tony's self-worth.
“You’re deflecting. Trying to push me away.” Steve stepped forward until he was about a foot away from Tony. “I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s wrong.”
“I know you didn’t send for me,” the courtesan said. “That much was obvious.” His voice was deeper than Steve expected and oddly accented. He spoke fast and enunciated, whereas Brooke’s natives had always favored a slower form of speaking, letters getting mushed together or lost entirely as they spoke. To his shock, he liked it. It was something different.
Hailey nodded in agreement. “It’s like everyone thinks you forgot how to laugh after…” she trailed off.
The last word hit Tony hard as a hot pang of lust struck him in his groin. Almost embarrassingly fast, Tony sunk to his knees and looked up at Steve from beneath his lashes. His kneecaps would definitely be sore later but in that moment he couldn’t bring himself to care.
Red Skull eyed the suitcase and said, “Although, it seems as if it is already in your possession.” Steve’s grip tightened on it until he was sure the handle was going to crumple into dust in his fist.
“Making mistakes is a part of the cooking process, Tony,” Jarvis says, stooping down to look him in the eyes. “Sometimes those mistakes make for the best meals. Think. How many meals do we have now that were made by mistake?”
“I’m gonna start you off easy,” AJ said. “I, like the ninety-year old grandma I am, am a hoarder. And because I’m a hoarder, I have a crap-load of magazines.” AJ heaved two big cardboard boxes onto the tables that had been provided for them. “I want you all to look through this magazines and try to find pictures that speak to you. Things that remind you of yourself, how you view yourself, how you think
He let go of the nuke, letting it fly in the path towards the largest of the ships. For a terrifying moment, he worried that the nuke would malfunction and the earth would be utterly decimated by the Chitauri. He feared for Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, the three people he knew loved him unconditionally and he did in return. He feared for the other Avengers as well. They had barely gotten to know each other but they fought together like a well oiled machine. Any more time spent with them and Tony wasn’t sure if those four idiots (not including Bruce, of course) were going to worm his way into his heart or make him rip his hair out.
When he emerges from the bathroom, Tony can't say he's surprised when he finds Steve, still suited up, sitting on the couch with his helmet in his hands.
Tony deliberately avoids mentioning Siberia. There’s only so much rage within him that he’s willing to show. How no one has taken any notice of them is beyond Tony’s comprehension as by the end of his speech, he’s struggling to keep himself from shouting.
She placed the cup in front of him, the scent of jasmine, lavender, and now freshly squeezed lemon blending together blissfully until Steve could feel himself letting go of tension he hadn’t even realized he had been carrying with him.
"I know where she is," Tony says and leads the way, picking out Carmen's chirpy voice, throwing out orders and praise with a
The wine left his mouth dry. Steve licked his lips noting how the courtesan’s eyes tracked the movement. “Yes,” Steve said, surprising himself. “I suppose I am.”
Not gonna lie, I'm absolutely floored at the response the first chapter got. Thank you to all of you who commented, bookmarked, subscribed, left kudos, hell, thank you for even just
“Would you like some wine?” He asked, mentally cursing himself. There was no wonder that Tony had wanted to leave. If Steve were forced to entertain himself, he’d want to vacate the premises as well.
"When?" Tony demands, his voice rising. "I thought going off on a half-cocked mission was my thing?"
As their friendship had progressed, Tony had started making an effort to take care of himself and he had seen the look less and less. But all of his progress went down the drain in the winter of 1991.
“Really, there’s one basic one. You can’t remain in proximity of any younger version of yourself for more than 24 hours. Even if you’re on completely opposite sides of the universe. Granted, the effects are slower the further away from your younger self you are, but they don’t stop completely.”
The third batch is perfect, Rhodey tells him, practically moaning after carefully biting into a still steaming slice. Tony taking that as a good sign, digs in himself. His eyes close as the sweet, piquant syrup the sweet potatoes created floods his mouth and he has to agree. Candied yams may just push chocolate chip cookies down a spot on his favorite dessert list. Apple tortes are still first but candied yams, Tony decides, are damn close.
call it the other word he's thinking of lest he get his hopes up,) but for what seems like the umpteenth time, he decides to ignore his doubts.
Bucky huffed and slouched into his seat. "I was just trying to liven things up. I saw you at the feast. You can’t tell me that you weren’t miserable."
Tony had completely wrapped himself, head and all, in a fluffy, fleece-lined red and gold blanket, little tufts of his hair poking out from where he had tossed the blanket over his head. Two house shoes with absolutely ginormous Iron Man themed heads adorned his feet. He looked absolutely ridiculous. And adorable.
His heart pangs in his chest as the little boy jumps as soon as his drawing is finished and throws himself into Steve's arms. Steve startles but recovers quickly, giving the kid a polite hug back.
Steve's hand reaches for the lube once more, the other jerking Tony off at an agonizingly slow pace until he's truly hard and leaking pre-come all over Steve's fist.
Tony could understand him. The same way Steve could apparently spend days working on an art piece, Tony would spend the same amount of time in his workshop, bringing an idea to life.
When he told her about Bucky the tears had finally fallen until they were both openly crying, clinging to one another like they were all each other had. He wanted to tell her everything. He wanted to tell her about Tony and Natasha and the rest of the Avengers and he guessed that included all of the new members they had collected along the way. Steve had
He didn’t want to look. Because if he looked, and Natasha wasn’t there, Steve wasn’t sure what he would do with himself.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Save the world a few times, and suddenly you have no time for your friends," she says, grinning, so Tony knows she's joking. She turns to the Avengers, who've all been standing there awkwardly like they're the new kids in school.
"I'll stop shouting," she says, which is a complete lie. "I just can't believe the Avengers are going to be at my fundraiser!" Case in point.
Tony’s eyes softened. “In all seriousness, though, thanks Cap. It means a lot. Truly. And,” Tony looked down. “I’m sorry, too. You weren’t the only one who said awful things on that Helicarrier. The serum may have made you all,” Tony did a hand wavy gesture, “but it didn’t give you your heart. That’s all you.”
At the final number, Tony let out a sigh of relief. They had managed to get his breathing under control and now Steve was just tired and hungry and wouldn’t be opposed to eating the entire pot of chicken tikka masala by himself before passing out right then and there on the kitchen floor.
Steve guided the head of his cock to Tony’s mouth. Tony placed a soft kiss on the head, licking lightly at the pre-come that had gathered there, making Steve hiss between his teeth. Steve’s pre-come was salty but not unpleasant. Tony wrapped his hand around Steve’s on his cock. He felt hard enough to cut diamonds in Tony’s hands and that submissive part of Tony
“I’m coming, I’m coming,” he chuckles. When he sees Tony slumped over, his blood runs cold, and Steve nearly drops the plate he had brought down for Tony. His first instinct is poison, but how? Who could have slipped in and out of Tony’s workshop unnoticed? Bullet then? Was he stabbed? Why wasn’t Tony moving—
“We’d know. The minute they perfect their experiments, who do you think they’re going to test them out on?”
Rhodey doesn’t say anything, he just takes out four sweet potatoes and gets to peeling them. His hands are a blur as he makes quick work of the first sweet potato and starts on the second one like its nothing.
“And none of us want to be defined by our jobs,” AJ replied. “I’m an art therapist and that’s a part of my identity but it’s not the only part of my identity. Art therapy is important to me but I’m more than just my occupation. And so are you. You are all more than your occupations, just like you’re all
Steve set down the shirt he had been folding. “It was working too well. Just figured SHIELD could use the extra help.”
. Steve couldn’t breathe and for a second he had a horrifying, sickening thought that the serum was failing and he was having an asthma attack even though he hadn’t had one in years.
Tony had bristled, sadness quickly giving way to anger and if he was being honest with himself, embarrassment. “I just turned fifteen,” he had said through gritted teeth.
. For so long, after they had thawed him out from the ice, Steve remembered feeling like a passenger in his own life. His days prior to the Avengers had been filled with him training, always getting ready for the next mission that never came, never allowing himself to properly grieve over everything he had lost. And then they had been brought together, whether it be by fate or through man-made machinations, and Steve’s life had had a purpose again.
So instead of saying I love you, he just lifts Steve's head up to look him in his face. He loves seeing the utter desperation in Steve's face, the euphoria right before he comes, loves knowing that he was the one to bring him to such heights. He sees it now. Steve's on the edge, his hair falling into his eyes, his lips all red and bitten like a smear of blood.
Tony blindly grasps for the drawer of his nightstand, rooting around until he finds what he's looking for: a bottle of lube.
“Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did.” Tony was no stranger to deflecting. Hell, he could write the textbook and teach the class on the art of deflecting.
"He's the best of us," Tony says. He glances at her. Natasha sits forward, resting her head upon her palm. Her face is smooth, her cheeks still tinged pink from their rowdy tramping through the fairgrounds. She looks...raw. That's the only word to describe her. Raw and real and human. Not the robot switching personalities and names and appearances like most people change clothes.
Steve just nods, not trusting his voice, and Tony makes his way over and sits down stiffly next to Steve. It’s a tight fit. Tony’s thigh presses right against his own. Steve can feel the heat of Tony’s skin through his pants. JARVIS dims the lights and starts one of the movies on Natasha’s list of Necessary Pop Culture she had created for Thor and Steve. Tonight, it’s Legally Blonde, with Elle Woods in all of her pink glory, gracing their screen.
Friendly reminder that I don't own Marvel or the MCU or anything related to it, and this is all for fun. Hope you guys like this one 💖.
But while Steve seemed to be thriving, Tony was slipping. It had been three months since the Battle of New York and Steve knew the other man tried his hardest to hide it, but Tony was hardly getting any sleep. Tony’s dark circles were permanent features on his face now, along with a cup (or twelve) of coffee in his hands. He also spent nearly all of his time in the workshop. Before, Tony had at least come out of the workshop to eat (unhealthily but hey, Steve wasn’t complaining. At least he was eating.) or to catch a few hours of sleep on something other than the worn couch in his workshop. But now, now it would be actual
“So us retrieving the stones, me returning them, fighting my younger self, all of that led to…my brain leaking out of my nose?”
"I know," Tony says, and the next few moments are naught but a blur. They kiss again and make their way to Tony's bedroom, occasionally stopping to feel each other up or get rid of a piece of clothing. When they finally make it to Tony's bedroom, they're both down to their boxers.
Tony tugged insistently at the strings of his trousers. "Let me show you just how handsome I think you are," he purred when they withdrew from each other to breathe.
But did he love Tony? Did he love Tony like Tony loves him? Before his anxiety could get the best of him, he pushed the thought from his mind. Regardless of how Steve truly felt, Tony would still care for him. There was no going back. Hell, Tony didn't
“If Richard doesn’t mind.” Tony turned to look at Rhodey with the widest smile he could muster. “You alright with this, Dick?”
that his brain didn’t even want to consider at the moment. Until he figured out what the hell was going on, he was going to proceed as he would normally. Normal. As if anything in his life was something as mundane and boring as
“As much as I enjoyed that soldier, I’ve got a heart condition. You can’t just kiss me breathless like that,” Tony jokes.
, claiming it was absolutely essential for Steve to watch in order to acclimate to the 21st century. They had sat next to each other on the sofa, Tony completely disregarding Steve’s personal space (Steve loved it) and settling his feet into Steve’s lap. Steve had enjoyed the movie for what it was, although the time travel plot line had hit a little too close to home.
Steve stalks into the kitchen and is immediately hit with the scents of his childhood. Mutton and onions and potatoes and carrots and underneath the savory mix, he can smell currants and caraway seeds.
“…Nat, I don’t think Tony would want to see me, period,” he said softly. “In the end, I…I never got to make things right. He hated me.”
Steve froze, his fingers stilling inside of Tony. Tony held his breath. He mouthed off to Steve all the time but very seldom could Tony actually get him to break. He decided to push it one step further.
Tony huffed out a laugh before reaching for the pocket of Steve's utility belt that he was 99.9 percent sure carried lube. He flipped open the pouch, and sure enough, a travel-sized bottle of lube resided in the pocket.
The bug-eyed look on Steve's face as he hurriedly tries not to spit his drink all over the dinner table is satisfying, to say the least.
Steve cursed, bucking his hips, and Tony gagged. He waited for Tony to buck him off and demand that Steve never touch him again, but instead, Tony looked up at him. His eyes shone with unshed tears, but the absolute lust in his eyes and bulge in his trousers told Steve all that he needed to know. So he did it again and again, all the while muttering a steady stream of curses under his breath.
Tony and Barton end up arguing the semantics of flying over a finger of Tony’s best scotch, Bruce occasionally chiming in, Romanov and Steve looking on in amusement.
"Tony," she says in that way of hers that usually means she's worried about him, and Tony's heart twists. "Is everything okay?"
Steve's hands are on Tony's waist, and he's shot back to the first time they stood like this, close enough to catch each other's breath. That first time had been an exploration—an adventure in learning each other's bodies.
"Why do you wear them?" He asks, grabbing a carton of milk from the fridge and giving it a hesitant sniff. Tony's not the greatest cook, but he'll be damned if he didn't make the best hot chocolate in all of New York. Passed on from Maria Stark herself, he never used the instant powdered mixes that were so commonplace. After returning home from long days being a glamorous socialite or a generous charity organizer or simply being Howard Stark's wife, his mother would end the night with a hot chocolate in one hand, and Tony curled into her side.
Tony gripped the arms of the chair as he did what he was told. From this angle and with Tony controlling the rhythm, every downward thrust had Tony’s head spinning. He could barely make sense of his thoughts, but in some ways, it was welcome. Tony’s brain was always working, always theorizing. Sometimes the only way he could get it to shut off was when he was with Steve.
He crouched down and dipped his hands into the stream. The water was warm to the touch but not altogether unpleasant. Cupping his hands, he scooped up some water and splashed it on his face.
Reaching into the case, Steve grabbed the Soul Stone and let it go just as quickly. Instead of dropping to the ground, the stone hovered in the air, glowing a brilliant orange. The shimmering light grew brighter and brighter, engulfing everything in its path until Steve’s eyes burned from its intensity.
The video started. At first it was just a solid black line but as Steve tried his best to heed the AI’s advice and pay attention to the video, it unfolded itself until suddenly Steve was looking at a triangle, then a square, then a pentagon, and so on so forth until it collapsed back into a single point.
It’s like someone’s dumped cold water down Tony’s back; he’s so in shock he can barely register what Natasha is saying. He swallows. Natasha knows. Of
Steve's smile falls just as quickly as it came, and Tony kicks himself mentally for being the one to do it. "Whenever HYDRA's involved, things tend to go south pretty quick."
Tony squirms in his seat, and suddenly the floor of his workshop is the most interesting thing he's ever seen. Has he always had so many motor parts lying around?
“It’s not superhero business, I get it,” Tony finished blandly. His hand shook as his grip on the crayon tightened. It was
Steve barely reacts as Tony plops right down in the seat directly across from him; his hand resting on the table clenches into a fist, near imperceptible if you knew what signs to look for.
“I’ll go first,” Steve said. His collage was simple. Only a handful of images had called out to him as AJ put it. He had thought about how he viewed himself and how other people viewed him and had split his images in half. On one side, he had a bunch of patriotic pictures of the flag and hard-faced soldiers at attention. On the right side, he had darker-toned pictures; pictures of clocks and storms and cliffs and right in the middle sat an image of his shield that he had managed to find after some serious digging.
work hard,” Pepper admits, pursing her lips. “But you work too hard. When’s the last time you had a day to yourself that you
embarrassed. The only ones who saw his freak out were the bots and JARVIS, and they’d never tell anyone. They like Steve too much. Maybe it was a little silly of him to panic, but being friends with Tony Stark meant heart attacks on the daily. The man’s lack of self-preservation was truly astounding.
“Let her in, J,” Tony says after staging the room. A gauntlet and soldering iron take the place of the gun.
Clint runs off to the bathroom, and something catches Steve's eye. Tony follows his gaze to the herd of children trying (and failing) to watch them eat without freaking out. Steve rises from the table, taking his prizes with him, leaving just Tony and Natasha behind.
Usually, Steve appreciated Peter’s merry mood in the mornings and often thought of it as a pick-me-up, but last night's events left him groaning and burrowing deeper into his sheets.
Tony’s head was reeling. According to JARVIS he had just had an anxiety attack and a severe one at that. But what had set him off? Rhodey…Rhodey had mentioned New York…and then the kid had asked him about the wormhole…
“Captain Rogers?” JARVIS said. Steve swore he heard a hint of concern in his voice. “ I believe you are experiencing another panic attack. Would you like me to get Mr. Stark?”
The words had hit him hard in his chest, almost as if Tony had actually dealt him a physical blow and suddenly Steve was falling deep into the clutches of his traitorous mind.
Friendly reminder that I don't own Marvel or the MCU or anything related to it. This is purely for fun.
The circumstances were different, but he didn’t want to take his or the Barnes’ chances with Madam Natalia.
Tony can practically hear his heart beating in his chest over the sound of Steve's steady, even breathing. Steve presses into him so slowly, so carefully like he's trying not to break Tony in half.
. He supposes that they’re friends now. He has his own personal entry code to Tony’s workshop, which he uses whenever he wants, it seems. Tony never turns him away, anyway.
It's easy being with Steve. Too easy. He keeps on waiting for the other foot to drop, for Steve to realize that there's better things he could be doing than fucking around with Tony. He's quickly learning that Steve isn't the type to be needlessly cruel. Steve volunteers with the cleanup crews that come in and take care of their messes after each mission. He stops to take pictures and sign autographs when he runs into fans on the street, and he's quick to call someone out on their bullshit, and Tony...admires him for it. Steve Rogers is a good man, a seemingly perfect man. It was inevitable for the other man to grow on him.
Having Dodger had given Steve something of a routine. Every morning on the weekends, he’d wake up to a face full of fur and dog kisses which really did something to boost one’s mood. Dodger, whenever he felt particularly energetic, would occasionally accompany him on his morning runs. The afternoons would be spent in Tony’s workshop, Steve doodling in his sketchbook, while Dodger and DUM-E would play fetch with each other when Tony was too occupied to throw the ball himself. Friday evenings were devoted to couch cuddles where Dodger, all tuckered out from his day, would clamber onto Tony’s expensive Italian leather couch just to plop his body down on Steve and Tony’s laps while they watched a movie. Between volunteering at Habitat for Humanity, “catching up” on the 21st century with the help of his friends, and going to therapy, Steve kept himself busy and dare he say it…he was sort of happy.
his and he knew in his heart of hearts that he couldn’t take that from her. Not when he knew how much good she was going to do during her life.
“No,” Steve gasped out. “Don’t get Tony. He can’t—” Steve wheezed. “He can’t know. None of them can.”
" He thinks to himself on occasion. Rhodey and Happy and Pepper come to mind then. Tony's relationships with them are warm and familiar, rooted in years of misadventures with each other. Being with them is as comforting as sitting by a fireplace.
"Give it my all," Steve clarifies. "I could devote an entire day to working on a project. Just me, some charcoal, and my canvas."
They curl close together, uncaring of the mess cooling on their stomachs. If Tony has anything to say about it, there’s a nice joint shower waiting for them when they find the will to move. Steve places one final kiss on the bite.
In hindsight, it was probably the “please” that got Steve off. The thought of the great, defiant Tony Stark on his knees begging for cock like his life depended on it.
"And you're not him," Tony replies. He leans his head against Steve's shoulder, sighing when he feels Steve press a kiss to the crown of his head.
“Shit, Tony,” Steve grit out. “You always feel so fucking good. I just want to,” Steve’s fisted a hand into his hair. Tony was starting think the other man had an obsession with it, with as much as he liked to lead Tony around by it. “Fuck your mouth whenever I want.”
He’s not sure what he’s expecting when the elevator's doors open and he steps out, but it sure as hell isn’t Tony Stark in the
"She an old flame of yours?" Clint says, and Tony tries to ignore how quickly Steve's head turns to look at him.
He's been caught. Lying isn't even an option; Pepper would sniff out the truth like a bloodhound. She was like Natasha in that way. If those two ever team up again, Tony feels sorry for whichever poor soul they set their sight on.
Rhodey had took one look at them and shook his head. “JARVIS, am I the only adult in the tower?” he had asked.
Steve pulls back from their kiss to look at him, and Tony's gone. From Tony's penthouse suite, he has the perfect view of the sun in the evening. It's midday, and the sun, not quite setting, casts shafts of light into his room, catching the blond of Steve's mussed hair until it shines like hammered gold.
It isn’t until Natasha points out that he’s shivering when Steve realizes he’s still cold. They had fished him out of the Atlantic not even three months ago and yet the chill of the ice follows him around like a ghost. For a moment, he thought the serum had malfunctioned, but SHIELD’s medics had reassured him that his body temperature was normal.
He could taste the wine on Tony’s tongue, honey and spice sweetening his kisses. He was hot, too hot; he wouldn’t have been surprised to see a trail of smoke coming off his skin.
Steve chokes, and Tony jams his elbow into his side. Steve coughs into his arm and clears his throat.
"Don't apologize for being decent," Steve murmured. "Save for Bucky and Dugan, no one else would have bothered."
the damn thing and if it were up to him, he would have willed it out of existence entirely. And the thought of going back to the 70s without Tony by his side…it filled him with more dread than he cared to admit.
Tony leans into his side. Steve stiffens, and for a moment, Tony thinks he made the wrong move, but then Steve slowly, almost like Tony's going to scamper off, wraps his arm around Tony's waist. His palm is hot against his side. The warmth seeps into his skin through the thin fabric of his shirt.
“I’m sure he’s a natural at riding,” Rumlow said with a smarmy smile that made Steve’s skin crawl. “Can’t be that different from his profession?” How could a man like that be a knight and personal guard to his father nonetheless?
“Living with me is a blessing!” Tony replies, feigning anger, except he’s grinning wide enough that his cheeks are starting to hurt and the effect is ruined.
Usually, Tony's quick with a quip, but Pepper's question makes him pause. Last week, Steve asked Tony if he wanted to join him on his run around Bryant Park, and what had Tony said?
Tony throws back the last of his scotch and tries not to think of Steve on his knees licking at Tony’s thighs and groin and—
Tony wasn't heavy by any means, and the feel of him pressed directly against Steve's groin was undeniably pleasant. His face grew hot as he pondered how much better it would feel had they been bare.
At first, Steve didn’t want to go near the New York Sanctum with a ten foot pole, but in those early weeks after the Battle of New York before he and Tony had had their breakthrough, Steve had ached desperately for a friend. And seeing as his current friends had still been stuck in their “Oh my God, it’s Captain America” phase, his options were sorely limited. He actually liked Brita. She had a sharp wit to her that Steve enjoyed. One moment he’d be peacefully drinking his tea and the next nearly choking on it as his brain would register whatever Brita had said.
“I…I probably shouldn’t be saying this. Hell, I don’t even know if you’re getting these, but, uh,” Tony had heard a ruffling sound, almost as if Steve had sighed into the phone receiver. “I’m leaving. For a SHIELD mission. Absolute radio silence. I don’t know how long it’s gonna take, but when I get back, I was hoping we could talk? In person?”
“Yeah,” Tony answers. “It’s mainly used for cooking. Have all your ingredients and utensils lined up from the beginning. Makes it easier in the long run.”
The rest of the session had gone smoothly after that, Chris and Jackson and Hailey all sharing their collages and getting feedback from AJ.
Natasha opens her mouth first, and Steve just about dies when she says, “I’m sure Steve can make some room. Right, Steve?” Her smile is saccharine, and yet Steve still feels like she’s threatening his life.
The last time around, he had said yes without a thought. He had underestimated how much he had missed being on a team, running around doing some good. At least he thought it had been good until HYDRA had reared its ugly head. His mind began to race with all of the possibilities. In the elevator he had said those disgusting words but…he could use them to his advantage. If he said yes, he could take down HYDRA two years early.
"Ha! Bucky's my only friend. Dugan...he's a good man, but he still serves my father first and me second. The rest might as well be puppets. My father's tools to do whatever he pleases." The bitterness in his tone surprised even him. He never had much of a head for politics, but part of him wondered if there was another way to rule.
The suitcase felt surprisingly light in his hand despite carrying six Infinity Stones. He didn't know what to expect, really, but with a name like “Infinity Stone” Steve thought the case should have felt...heavy. Important. Like it should have equaled the mental weight of having the fate of the universe in one's own hands. It felt like holding air.
Steve scrambled towards the case, his hands fumbling over the latches that had snapped back shut, and tugged at the stone. He ignored the searing pain racing through his hands and pulled until the stone finally came free. The woman grabbed the stone from his hands and placed it in the necklace around her neck.
“But I didn’t,” Steve muttered to himself before realization struck him. His eyes shot to Bucky, who was easing out of his seat and towards the door. “Bucky!”
One moment, Tony had been indulging in quiet conversation with Bruce about his travels. His fellow scientist had decided to treat them all to a wonderful samosa recipe he had picked up in India. It was a breakthrough for Bruce, sharing a part of himself with the other Avengers without fear.
cute with Steve's signature red, white, and blue suit and the shield to go along with it. "Thank you," Tony says. "You sure you want me to hold onto this?"
Tony’s lips find their way to the shell of Steve’s ear. “Hold me, please?” he whispers. Steve tenses, every muscle in his body coiled like a tiger ready to strike.
He wants to savor this moment with Steve, wants to live in it for as long as humanly possible, because who knows when they'll get another moment like it. Unfortunately, Tony's discomfort wins out.
