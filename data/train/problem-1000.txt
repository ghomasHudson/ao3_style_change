The man was exactly John’s type.
," Sherlock growled. "Let
John growled again.
A shiver of arousal passed through John’s body.
“And don’t pretend you don’t know you’re a silver fox,” Sherlock added, poking at Greg’s shoulder with one graceful finger.
Sherlock berated himself for his lack of courage. He hadn't told John how he truly felt about him because he was terrified of ruining everything, choosing to keep his platonic friendship with John rather than risk chasing John away with his... desires. But it was clear to Sherlock now that he was a fool to think that John would stay with him as "just flatmates." John would keep searching for a suitable partner. Sherlock shoved his hands into his hair and tightened his fists in it. Continued inaction could cost him
Mike's expression sobered. "Don't forget what I said this morning. I won't sell your house to anyone until autumn at the earliest. If you need to come back -"
He felt a hand on his forearm. "Don't fret, dear. He just needs some time."
Sherlock dragged his hands down John's body. He pushed his right hand over the front of John's trousers and onto his erection. John arched his back again. "Sh-Sherlock!" he cried, his voice breaking.
"I'll take it under advisement." The man smiled back. He put his right hand out. "Sherlock Holmes."
He wrapped his hands around John’s wrists, and John hissed in pain. Although the ropes were of good quality and the bonds had been expertly tied, John’s repeated yanking against them had taken a toll.
He looks back up at Sherlock, taking a shuddering breath.
John smiled to himself.
John wished desperately to be able to see what Sherlock was doing between his legs. He knew it was unimaginably greedy of him to want more in the middle of the most profoundly pleasurable experience of his life, but he was rapidly learning that when it came to Sherlock he would always want more. He would give anything to see Sherlock wrap those long graceful fingers around that big rosy-tipped cock while he took John’s down his throat.
John looked into Sherlock's eyes for another moment, searching for any sign of deception. When he found none, he smiled back shyly. He turned and made his way to the bed. Sherlock followed. John sat down. He lifted his eyes to Sherlock's again.
John was in freefall. He was coming harder than he had ever come in his life. His entire body thrashed uncontrollably against Sherlock’s grip before tensing up, locked in ecstasy.
Sherlock looked into John's eyes again. "I'd like that... very much."
"John, do you really want to come with me? You'll lose everything you've built here."
He bracketed John’s shoulder with both hands, front and back. “This will only repair any damage you did tonight.” He repeated the incantation.
located between the cafe we were in last week and your building."
John dropped his head. Sherlock's arms were around him. "I'm so sorry, John."
As they sat on one of the hills, John stroked his hand through Sherlock's hair. "I'm so sorry you have to do this. I know a place where we can stop. There's a hidden glen a little over halfway to Mike's farm. We'll be safe there until tomorrow night."
John laughed. It was a beautiful sound. Sherlock wanted to make John laugh like that every day for the rest of his life.
"Close, John, I'm so close."
"Why?"
John sat up fully. “Because I am good at this. Very good. I’ll admit you bowled me over tonight. Give me a chance to get my feet back under me and show you what I can do.”
"You are
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes, will you marry me?"
He went back to the bedroom, grinning at the sight of Sherlock splayed across his bed. John pulled his underwear on and went to the kitchen to see if any of the food he'd been cooking was salvageable. He took the macaroni and cheese out of the oven and set it next to the pork chops. Everything looked dried out and overcooked. He poked at the food with his spatula and decided it was too far gone.
"Sherlock -"
"It's okay, Sherlock. I've got you."
3:05pm
They walked in silence over the hill. The sun was coming up, its light revealing the scattered colours of early spring amid the grey and brown left by winter. John's house was a small, neatly kept wooden structure with a thatched roof. There was a well on one side and a woodpile on the other. John opened the door. "Let's get you into the bed, Henry. I'll sleep on the floor while you're here."
Sherlock glared at him. "Yes, I'm
, my love. It hurts me, too."
, Sherlock! How could you think I would leave you?"
He and Mike talked quietly to pass the time as they drove. The village was quiet as they passed by in the dark. They drove on toward the sea. After a couple of hours, John could smell the salt in the air. They stopped to bury Sherlock's clothes in the forest.
"Sherlock'll be all right, dear. I'll check on him later."
) wrapping his arms around him. He captured John's mouth in a searing kiss as he moved his hands over John's body, settling one in John's hair and the other on his arse. He shoved John backward, crowding him against the opposite pillar.
Sherlock looked away. "But I can't run on a broken leg. I may as well just go back."
A cold wave of primal terror crashed over John’s entire body and settled in his groin.
"Why don't you close your eyes now, Honey? It's still a couple of hours before dawn."
"It's okay. I... was shot."
"Oh, that's wonderful! I bet you're very talented!"
John stopped in the hallway to make a note on Mrs. Sheffield's chart. He felt Sherlock's watch bump against his thigh. He stopped writing, suddenly unable to think of anything but Sherlock. He indulged himself for a moment, allowing his mind to wander. He remembered the way the candlelight had danced in Sherlock's eyes at dinner the night before. And the way Sherlock's whole face had lit up that morning when John asked if he could call him.
Sherlock shook his head again. "No, you were incredible. You had everything under control before I could even process what was happening. And the way you kept everyone calm... You're truly extraordinary, John."
. He closed his eyes and tried to brace himself. His heart was pounding. A moment passed.
" Sherlock hissed.
"John, I can't imagine a life without you any more. You're everything to me." He put his hand on John's cheek. "I love you."
Sherlock moved forward to reclaim him. John spoke quickly. “Take them off.” Sherlock froze, millimetres away from contact. John’s cock objected strongly to the interruption.
John had no idea how to respond to that. So he said nothing and continued stroking Sherlock's hair. He was beginning to suspect that Sherlock had been hurt badly in the past.
, he thought.
John closed his eyes as his body settled against Sherlock's. He groaned as his erection pressed into the hollow of Sherlock's hip. He felt Sherlock huff out a breath as John's hip settled on top of Sherlock's erection.
"What is it?" Sherlock looked mildly concerned.
Sherlock clamped a hand onto his other shoulder to keep him in place. “At least let him finish explaining, Lestrade.”
"Hmm." Sherlock looked out the window. He took a sip of his drink. He set it down and began fidgeting with the glass, spinning it slowly on the table.
Guilt and pain shot through John's heart when he heard Sherlock's voice, but he couldn't stop. It was all he could do to walk away rather than run.
After kissing Sherlock's mouth thoroughly, John dipped down to Sherlock's neck, nuzzling into it. He kissed and licked at it. Sherlock gasped out, "John!" and pulled him closer. John moved his hands into Sherlock's hair and reclaimed his mouth.
. I'll warn you though, I'm not going to last long."
Sherlock opened his eyes and followed John's direction. Slowly. He deliberately exaggerated his movements, quite aware of how the sight of the muscles in his back and arms contracting would affect John.
"Yes, he is," Sherlock replied as he tossed his shoes aside and attacked his own shirt buttons. "Clothes off.
They soon finished eating. Mike insisted that Sherlock lie down on his bed. Sherlock complied, but stayed on top of the coverlet, using his cloak as a blanket. It felt wonderful to be in a bed again. John and Mike went to the barn.
Holmes is also well known as a composer. His works have been performed extensively throughout the world. He is best known for an unaccompanied violin work, 'Watershed,' which he premiered in recital at Unity Temple in 1979. Holmes is famously unforthcoming with details of the personal inspiration for his works, but it has been suggested by sources close to Holmes that the piece deals with the Plaza flood of 1977 and its impact on Holmes and Watson and their fledgling relationship.
“Excellent,” he said as he studied John intently. “Your self image is not exaggerated.” He took hold of John’s cock, giving it a solid stroke down and back up the entire length.
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably but didn’t look away. His voice was flat. “Whatever you think you feel, it isn’t real. Your orgasm releases chemicals in your brain to discourage you from immediately abandoning a mate you may have impregnated. It means nothing.”
"I'm still taking you out for a nice dinner later, though." John propped his head up on his arm. He trailed his fingertips over a Sherlock's chest until they landed against his dog tags. He picked them up. "Now that you'll have a proper wedding ring, I suppose you won't have to wear these clunky old things."
Heat surged through John's body as he pulled Sherlock in. Sherlock's lips were warm and soft against his. Sherlock opened his mouth, pushing his tongue against John's lips. John opened his mouth in response, allowing Sherlock's tongue in.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. "My horse."
John gripped Sherlock's arms harder and took a shaky breath. "Sherlock, I want you to promise me something before we go any further."
He threw himself diagonally across his bed, rolling onto his back.
11:45pm
Sherlock melted against him. "
"So, Henry, who are you running from?"
"Not a chance in hell," John replied with an indulgent smile.
John reached out and put his fingertips on Sherlock's hipbone. He looked up and saw that Sherlock's eyes had opened. Sherlock was gazing at him with undisguised want. He shuddered as John trailed his fingertips all the way from Sherlock's hip to the hinge of his jaw and leaned down. "Sherlock, you're
"If we are going to do this, I want you to promise to tell me if anything I do makes you uncomfortable."
Sherlock pulled John into an embrace. "I don't know what I'd do without you, John."
As they talked quietly over their drinks, Sherlock reached up and tugged at his white bow tie, untying it. He let it hang loose around his neck and reached up again to unbutton two of his shirt buttons. John felt a rush of heat through his whole body when Sherlock's long, graceful fingers pulled his shirt open at his neck, revealing part of his collarbone. John took a sip of his drink, swallowing hard.
Sherlock showed no mercy, working John hard. He moved one hand to John’s bollocks, holding them with precisely the right amount of pressure. His other hand clutched John’s thigh.
John went out to grab supplies to stitch Sherlock up.
as he caressed Sherlock’s upper body, unable to resist rocking his hips subtly against that lovely cock.
“Please don’t leave.”
, he startled hard and scrambled up against the headboard.
,” John breathed. “They’re
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders. "Fine. How was your shift?"
When they'd both finished, John got up and put the food away. The first light of dawn was beginning to show through the window over their heads.
John fixed his eyes on Sherlock's. "Let me see, Beautiful.
Mary lifts her head and looks at John and Sherlock.
"I live here."
Sherlock parked his car back in its spot in his building's underground parking. He turned to John. "John, will you... stay with me tonight?"
Sherlock still didn't turn around. "This batch should be ready for bottling sometime next week."
John froze, the shirt still in his hands as he looked at Sherlock. The firelight was glowing and dancing over Sherlock's skin. He was looking up at John, the firelight mingling with the heat in his eyes. John had never seen anything so beautiful. Sherlock put a hand against John's cheek. "All right?" he asked quietly.
"Why did you run away?" John asked gently.
music. A lot, actually. But my taste runs more to Zeppelin and Hendrix than it does to... Mozart."
"Concertmaster." Sherlock was still looking at his feet.
After several minutes had passed, John managed to find the strength to prop himself up on one elbow. Sherlock stood across the room, facing away. His tail moved in slow, satisfied curls as he laced up his ridiculous leather trousers.
"Look at me," John commanded.
Sherlock yielded. "I'm sorry, John. Take my car. The keys are by the phone. Call me if you need anything, all right?"
"Your knees are still bothering you."
"What's it about? Are you thinking about something specific when you work on it?"
"I became a soldier."
Sherlock looked up at John again.
John scoffed.
The remaining empty seats around John filled up over the next few minutes. It looked like all of the musicians were on stage now, except for Sherlock and Lestrade. The lights dimmed.
Sherlock carefully pulled John's cock out of his underclothes. He grasped it firmly and licked the head. John made a keening noise above him. Sherlock took the head into his mouth.
Sherlock grinned at him. "It is. But not because of the turkey."
“Well, if you’re the best in the world, surely you can have anyone you want,” Greg said. “Why me?” He gestured vaguely toward the dance floor. “Why not one of those hot young twinks over there?”
John could feel pressure being applied to his abdominal area and a whole new wave of pain attacked him, momentarily rendering him unconscious. All too soon though, he was awake and there was a face above him, strong hands supporting his head. "John. Stay with me. Try and focus on me."
Sherlock pursed his lips before averting his eyes to his knees. He could feel the tears stinging his eyes but he wasn’t going to let them show, not now. Molly made her way back over to the sofa and plopped down next to Sherlock, resting a hand on his shoulder.
“No.”
Pieces of paper are strewn across the living room of Baker Street, case files, evidence. A cup of coffee is spilt, becoming dry and sticky. Sherlock is on his hands and knees, frantically rifting through the documents, not caring where they land. His hands are shaking as he picks up sheet after sheet of paper, eyes scanning the content before throwing it to the side.
“You’re going. I’m not bothered by your protests or your claims of not needing it. You’re going to rehab.”
I think this fact hits him the hardest. He might never have his ability to control  simple bodily functions. Things that shouldn't even have any thought put into, that anyone can do. That everyone does. He can't. Might never be able to again.
he sighed, “am I not surprised?”
But no matter how hard I try he doesn't move, doesn't open his eyes and tells me that he loves me again. He doesn't hold me as I wake up screaming about another nightmare because it isn't a nightmare, not this time.
“You could, though you need not to.” He sipped his coffee. “Why didn’t you tell Lestrade I was awake if you knew I hadn’t gone to sleep?”
The fact of the matter stood, however, that John could so easily have not started breathing again. There was never a guarantee of his heart continuing to beat, and if it hadn’t, Sherlock had absolutely no idea whatsoever of how he would be coping right now.
"John..." Sherlock's knees had buckled in an instant and he was on the floor, right beside John's body. The sight of him made his stomach repel and he was coughing, vomiting beside the body of John's unconscious father. "No, John- you can't. No."
Lestrade interjected, with an, 'I'll leave you two alone,' before standing up abruptly and leaving the ICU.
She peers at me, waiting to see if I have any questions for her but I do not. I allow her to continue. "The neurological examiners will test the motor nerves, which includes muscle tone and muscles weakness, as well as sensory nerves and reflexes. Through testing John's reflexes we will be able to determine how his bladder and bowel movement have been affected. Usually this worries patients the most which is why I am telling you this.
“Apologies little brother…” a moment “and John…” He’s silent for a moment more. “Isn’t this cosy?”
"Shit." Grimacing, John closed his eyes, resting his head back against his pillow. "What happened?" Without hesitation, Sherlock shifted the uncomfortable plastic hospital chair forward so that he was closer to John's side and took his hand in his own.
“John.” Lestrade stands still, not stepping any further into the room. John too stands where he is, careful not to make too much noise. “John,” Lestrade says again, this time a lot softer. “I’ll come back another time.” A sympathetic smile crosses his lips as John nods as a thank you. He’s loathe to send anyone away who wants to visit Rosie, especially if it’s Lestrade or Mrs Hudson or Molly, but on days like these he knows it’s for the best. Lestrade makes to leave, squeezing John’s shoulder ever so slightly as he leaves. Then, it’s just the three of them yet again.
I haven't looked at my gun in years. I didn't need to.
I'll be the first to admit how bad I was. Depression isn't pleasant, neither is feeling suicidal. I didn't want to live at all. I was broken. Utterly broken. And to top that off I had an injured shoulder, a psychosomatic limp and post traumatic stress disorder that would be enough to scare anyone away. It was in that moment that I wished that I'd have someone to take all that pain away from me, to rid me of the world.
"Wake up James. Wake the fuck up, come on for fuck's sake! Wake up!" I screamed, over and over again, my fists scrunched tightly into his uniform. The smell of the cindered flesh hit my nostrils again and I realised that it was his flesh, his body that had been burned. I lurched to the side of him and threw up, over and over again. Someone put their hand on my shoulder and started tugging me backwards, ordering me to go over to the helicopter that I hadn't even acknowledged had arrived.
"Sherlock?" He asked, nudging Sherlock's elbow. Sherlock shifted from his position in John's lap and sat up, looking with concern at John. "Don't worry, I'm fine." John reassured, patting Sherlock on the thigh before setting down the glass on a coaster on the table.
“He’s in good hands.” Molly rubbed her hand across Sherlock’s shoulder, doing anything she could to be as comforting as possible. Despite not wanting to admit it, Sherlock did appreciate Molly’s concern. He definitely wasn’t going to get it from Mycroft.
expression never once faltering.
to distract him from what is going on right now.
Molly nodded her head before realising that Lestrade could not see what she was doing. “Right. Ok. Has John been awake?”
"Hey, it's alright, John." Sherlock placed a kiss to the corner of John's mouth. "We don't have to tell them." Another cry rippled through John's body as Sherlock spoke softly to him, knowing that what he said was untrue. He needed to tell them. It wasn't an option. He couldn't continue hiding the one person who he cared for most in this world from the two people who were meant to support him through everything. It just wasn't right.
The things he did to me, the way he moved, how he was so gentle, so considerate. I craved him, his whole being. He was like a drug to me- the one thing I needed to keep going. The fact that he felt the same way made me feel things I'd never felt before.
It is not until my eyes are welcomed by the sight of his blue ones that I realise I have been staring at him. We are both laying flat on our backs, our necks turned at slight angles so that we are able to see one another. My hand subconsciously reaches out for his and our fingers intertwine, lacing together in a way that is just perfect for us.
“I don’t know.” A loose curl falls over Sherlock’s face as he nods his head in response to John’s answer and he kneels down beside John so they are level with one another.
"Hey, Sherlock." John squeezed Sherlock's hand, a reassurance. "Don't blame yourself. Please." When the detective didn't reply, John squeezed  his hand again, using all of his energy as he did so.
your daughter. John and I will cope in any way that we see fit and if you so happen to step foot on Baker Street in the foreseeable future you will regret it.”
"She looked genuinely happy, John. And that's because of you. And if that wasn't enough, she then told me that she was grateful that she had such a caring son who would look after her. She told me that she was proud of you."
After he died, I found it hard to cope. The motivation to continue onwards just stopped and I spiralled downhill, finding new distractions, not focussing on myself. Not that I did that much before he died, but he helped. John helped me so much, although I was reluctant to admit it.
It was well attended. Mrs Watson was there, wearing a straight cut dress and jacket. Harry attended, arm in arm with Clara who were both wearing elegant black outfits.
I had to leave halfway through the memorial when Mike stood up, reminiscing on the memories he and John had together. Then he started talking about me and how happy I made John and I lost it, completely and utterly lost it. Similar to how I was at the hospital, I was inclined to get away from people and shoved my way past classmates who were staring at me, tears in their eyes and tissues in their hands. I noticed my English teacher standing up, ready to come after me but soon Greg was there, telling her not to follow me. She didn't.
The doctor stops speaking, allowing me time to accept the information that has just been given to me. I can't think. I hear Lestrade curse under his breath and then his hand is on my shoulder, squeezing it reassuringly. My hands start to tremble again, expressing exactly how I'm feeling despite my face showing no emotion whatsoever.
"You are too." Clearing my throat, I turned to look at Greg, my face a picture of confusion. "You looked after him. Cared for him. I don't know many people who would have been able to do that without getting frustrated or angry."
"John..."
"If anything goes wrong... we can just go away. One of Mycroft's assistants is driving around and we can go with him, back to my house. I'll just need to phone him. Your mum can come as well." John stood on his tiptoes and placed his arms around Sherlock's neck.
now without another word.”
“My-“ he tries to say his brother’s name but all that comes out is a shaky breath. Sherlock inhales and shakes his head, squinting his eyes and retreating into himself.
Back at Baker Street, Sherlock immediately went to find Mrs Hudson and they went upstairs to 221B. Mrs Hudson had been worrying all night, understandably- “I wish you would tell me when you’re not coming home, Sherlock! I worry! And John-” She looked around in search for the man in question. “Where’s John?”
“Nightmares. Flashbacks. Have you experienced any?” She began scribbling notes down as she waited for John to answer.
Nodding his head ever so slightly, Sherlock agreed. "Of course."
"You can tell me anything, John. You know you can. Father doesn't have to know."
"Ready?" Lestrade asks, and I nod. I need to face the world again, go back home, adjust to my new life. But there is one thing I must do first and I intend to do it now.
Sherlock pulled away, panting. All four of them were at the bottom of the staircase, a pool of blood forming around their feet. The younger teen dropped the photo frame that he had been clinging onto, one corner now tainted with the blood of Mr Watson. He looked at the site before him, stunned in momentary shock before he spun around and faced Mrs Watson whose face was marred with quickly forming bruises. Her mouth hung open and mascara had leaked down her face. Sherlock placed his hands on her shoulders and forced her to look at him.
I went M.I.A. When the bullet ripped through my left shoulder, meshing together my skin, muscle and bone, I didn't believe anyone would find me. I still don't understand how they found me, laying in the dirt as I bled out. The sun was absolutely scorching- you would think that my main focus would be the pain, the absolute agony, but it wasn't. It was the Afghanistan heat, the overwhelming, treacherous heat that for some reason I welcomed as I was dying out.
that I am never going to see John again, hear his voice, look at him smile.
It was three weeks in to my second tour and James and I managed to sneak out of camp one evening, down to the stream a couple of miles away. We laid down, our gazes shifting to the stars. And it was so, so beautiful. We had our moment where the bombings and the shootings were forgotten and it was just us, two men in a world that didn't stop to think about anything except fighting.

Sherlock obeyed. He stared forward, so lost he wasn't focusing.
"Sherlock?"
John pulled his mouth and body away, causing Sherlock to whimper at the loss. John's hand tightened in Sherlock's hair. "Open your eyes, Sherlock."
John stared at Sherlock in shock. "How - how do you know that?"
The guards kept walking. As their voices faded, Sherlock began to tilt his head up slightly so he could track them. The guards went around the next corner. Sherlock sagged in relief. He put his trembling hands to his face and tried to control his breathing. He was immensely thankful that John hadn't returned while the guards were there.
Sherlock's cheeks went pink. "All right."
“How many times - I’m not a mind reader!” Sherlock whined.
"Walk with me, Doctor." Sherlock turned and walked away. John followed.
"Emergency. I'm at St. Luke's."
Sherlock, a huge smile breaking over his face:
"I'll be the judge of that." Sherlock grabbed John's arm and pulled.
Sherlock's POV
John took the horse in and rubbed it down. He milked the cow. As he approached the house, he could hear Sherlock laughing.
John couldn't help smiling back. "I enjoyed it too, Sherlock. Thank you for dinner." He extended his hand.
"Hmm?"
The conductor turned to the whole orchestra, flipping the pages of a large book. "Okay, we're going to run the first movement," he said. He had salt-and-pepper hair and a gruff voice. "At the top, please."
"Well, no, it always seemed such a waste of time. A distraction. I thought myself above these... desires."
John looked up at Sherlock's face. Sherlock could still see trepidation in John's eyes. He smiled at John warmly.
He looked into John's eyes. The light from the window was catching in Sherlock's eyes, making them glow a vibrant mossy green. John looked down, chastising himself again.
John sings a 12th century love song to Sherlock in this chapter.
"Oh?"
Sherlock broke the kiss and tipped his upper body back to allow John to open his shirt, attacking John's shirt at the same time. When both of their shirts were open, Sherlock dove back in. He kissed John deeply and stroked his hands over John's upper body. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock. He ran his hands up Sherlock's back under his shirt, then dragged his fingernails down. Sherlock arched his back and growled against John's mouth. John grabbed hold of Sherlock's ass and pulled his hips tightly against his own. The kiss faltered as both men moaned at the friction.
"You're a cruel man, John Watson." Sherlock was glaring at him now, but he hadn't let go of the balusters.
John unwound Sherlock's legs from his waist and moved to kneel at his left side. He put his hands back on Sherlock's hips and looked up at his face. Sherlock's eyes were still closed, and his mouth was slightly open. John carefully pulled Sherlock's underwear down and off. Sherlock pulled his knees up to help. John sat back and allowed himself to look for a moment. Sherlock was
"You're rather remarkable yourself, John. I love you more than I can say."
“Incubi feed on human energy. We won’t drain or harm you, we merely pick up what you’re giving off. The two of us are unique in three ways. First, Sherlock here was innovative enough to discover that sexual pleasure is the most potent and satisfying of human energies to absorb. That’s obviously good news for you.”
Sherlock scrunched up his face. “Every human thinks they’re good at this, particularly the males. The vast majority of them are wrong.” He stepped toward John. “
"John." Sherlock nodded his head slightly at his own hand. John looked. Sherlock tapped out their signal. John looked back up. This time his smile reached his eyes. Sherlock looked at John's hand. He smiled when John gave the signal in return. "Go on, John. I'll be here waiting for you."

"It's already done. Everyone knows by now. If they're going to fire me, so be it. I'll think of something."
"Well, my medical side was distracted. He's risking a nasty infection injuring himself like that. And the rest of me was
They managed to put themselves back together and get to the Uptown Theatre a few minutes before the show started. John was grateful they had taken the edge off before the concert, because
Sherlock returned the half-smile. He and John silently watched the land getting closer. When they were close enough to see people moving around, John dragged himself up with a groan and went to the railing. Sherlock watched John's face as he watched the crew on the ship and the dock workers. Under the pallor of his seasickness, Sherlock could see a hint of the beautiful expression of wonder John had worn when they first set sail. He smiled faintly.
"Then that settles it. But you'll have to... tell me how."
John put his hand up toward Sherlock, waving it in an attempt to tell Sherlock not to worry about him.
John's chest felt tight. "Okay."
"If you'd met some of the women my mother's set me up with over the years, you'd know why I couldn't be sure."
Sherlock grinned at him. "I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about."
"Doctor Watson!" Bill said. "What happened here?"
Sherlock nodded slightly and took the head between his lips again. John whimpered. Sherlock moved his mouth up and down slowly - much more shallowly this time. He made a mental note to research techniques as soon as possible. He continued to use his tongue and suck lightly. He felt John's cock grow even harder.
“Sherlock! You will not actually die of boredom. I have to start slowly. We’ve talked about this!”
The second guard grumbled, "Why does it matter, as long as you're getting paid? I'm sick of listening to your whining."
Sherlock watched the firelight dance in John's hair. He watched then tension in John's body fade. He kept watching as John's breathing slowed and deepened.
Greg was pinned, unwilling or unable to look away. His lovely brown eyes were wide. His chest rose and fell rapidly.
John put his hands out. Sherlock took them. John helped him stand up slowly on his right foot. Sherlock moved his left hand onto John's shoulder. (John noticed that Sherlock made sure it was the right shoulder. John tried
"Just get in the car, John. Please." He fixed his eyes on John's. "I want to go home.
Double update this week due to chapter 9 being so short and so brutal! I hope you enjoy chapter 10. (I certainly enjoyed writing it!)
He moves to sit up, hissing in pain. Sherlock moves quickly to help him.
Realization dawned on Sherlock's face. "Oh."
Sherlock was going limp. "I'm fine, I'm fine."
"Of course."
The exquisitely sculpted creature loomed over John, caging him in with his body. John instinctively tilted his face up, expecting to start with a kiss. The incubus dipped down, nuzzling into John’s neck instead. He inhaled deeply, taking in John’s scent and responding to it with a soft growl.
After lunch was over, Harry was expected to go to the kitchen to clean with her mother and Linda. John played along briefly, taking Clara back to the living room. He leaned close. "I'm going to go tell Mom that Harry looks pale and needs to come sit in here with you instead of wash dishes."
He slowly made his way down Sherlock's body, the exquisite body he knew better than he knew his own. He took his time, despite the pain in his knees and the ache in his shoulder, writing his love over Sherlock's skin with a thousand kisses.
Mike rode out as soon as dinner was cleared up, promising to return by dusk. Sherlock had insisted that Mike take a piece of gold to Molly and Greg as payment for the clothes. John went outside to see him off. When Mike had gone, John came back inside, barred the door, and sat at the table next to Sherlock. He took Sherlock's hand and said, "Don't worry about Mike. He's tougher than he looks, and he won't give anything away."
"Yes, of course, John."
The wounded expression was transforming into a glare.
Sherlock paused. The he lifted his head. "I miss you."
"You mean
Sherlock pulled back enough to focus on John’s face. “Why does it matter?”
Sherlock took John's hand. He shook it as John had intended, but he didn't let go. John's heart started beating too fast.
John looked at Sherlock again. He saw Sherlock picking his crutches up and moving to stand. John started to help him, but another bout of nausea hit him and he had to return to the rail.
John shook his head. "It's a good thing most of my decent clothes had found their way into
John choked back a cry. He clapped his left hand over his own mouth. His right hand was still in Sherlock's hair.
John flew back into the house, scanning for evidence. Two plates! He put Sherlock's plate away, then dried his mug and put it away. He looked again. The flour sacks! He restacked them quickly and slid them under the bed. He looked again. Nothing. They had been right to keep Sherlock's things gathered. He hurriedly hung up his bow and quiver.
John's POV
“You’re sure you can handle it?”
Sherlock leaned onto the table. "Hello, John."
John leaned dangerously close to Greg’s ear, his hand still on his shoulder. He deliberately lowered and roughened his voice. “You think he’s hot now? You should see him in his true form. Take us home and we’ll show you. And he honestly
"All right. Thank you, John."
Sherlock appeared in the doorway. He hadn't bothered to put anything on. John's dog tags rested against his chest. "Looks like the salad survived," he said, gesturing at the bowl on the table.
John found a spot where Sherlock could wait while John arranged a room. John stood next to Sherlock. He didn't move to leave. In fact, he seemed rooted to the spot.
"The ninth variation is a particular favourite of mine."
Sherlock ducked his head. "It's all right, John. I... I don't mind." He finally looked into John's eyes again. His cheeks had gone fully pink. "I
"Still broken."
"It's fine." Sherlock started the car.
John's mouth dropped open. He quickly tried to recover. "You... you listen to Alice Cooper?"
"What are you talking about, Sherlock? You looked like a model and I was wearing ratty old jogging clothes!"
Mike interrupted. "It's the best chance, Sherlock. For you
John glanced around. Sherlock was right. Most of the ER staff was staring incredulously, not even pretending to work. John met Sherlock's eyes. "I don't give a rat's ass," he growled as he pulled Sherlock back into his arms. He felt Sherlock gasp slightly and melt against him.
, I love you." He slid his clean hand under Sherlock's shirt and robe and wrapped his arm around Sherlock's back. He held him tightly and listened to Sherlock's heart as it gradually slowed its frantic pace.
"Nothing. I just never know what to say when people say that to me."
"I'd like that, John." Sherlock smiled shyly at him.
"Didn't they tell you in the village?"
"Clearly," Watson replied with a smile.
"Don't be ridiculous. I'm just a musician. I'm certainly not a
“Take us home, Greg,” John commanded.
John's head tipped back against the tiles. He groaned loudly. "Oh, God,
me to finish you." He stroked John's right nipple with his thumb.
John:
John's eyes widened. "How did you -"
Sherlock's arms were around him. "I'm so sorry, John."
"Will you... sit with me while you eat?"
John took the glass. Sherlock held up an Aleve capsule. Warmth flooded John's heart as he took the pill from Sherlock's hand. "What's this?"
John got up and put his plate in the sink. He turned around and leaned against the counter, scrubbing his hand over his face. He'd been thinking of nothing but Sherlock for the last three days.
Sherlock bent down and put his forehead against John's again. He closed his eyes. "John, I don't know how to do this."
The man sighed heavily. "Fine." He swept his hood back. Dark curls fell over his brow. His face was ashen with pain. He pushed the cloak aside, scattering the leaves. The man's left boot was off. His lower leg was clearly swollen.
John and Sherlock stayed at the cafe while the other customers came and went. As it grew later in the evening, the cafe began to empty again. Sherlock paid the bill as he'd offered to, but John insisted he allow him to leave the tip. John gave the waiter an enormous tip as an apology for commandeering the table for the entire evening.
They didn't move for several minutes. Then John pushed himself up. He kissed Sherlock and tried to get out of the bed. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him tightly, holding him down.
Sherlock huffed out a breath and gave John another little shake. He pitched his voice lower. "
John's cheeks were hot. "Do you need them taller? Shorter? Please tell me and I'll adjust the height for you."
Both of Sherlock's hands tightened as he came with a sharp cry.
“I want to see it.”
Sherlock's eyes widened in concern. He dropped his notebook and pen on the bench so he could reach out and grab at John. "John, no! Your knees!"
Sherlock smiled briefly. His face became serious again. "You should think this over for a while before you say anything to your mother. I don't want you to make a rash decision and regret it."
John spoke even more quietly. "It's possible you may hear me having to tell someone I'm only helping you for your money." He leaned toward Sherlock a little. "
..." He grabbed a handful of John's hair and held him in place.
Sherlock laughed quietly behind John. When they reached the bedroom, he yanked John back by his hand, capturing him in a scorching kiss.
John finished and sat back on his heels. "You're lucky, Henry."
John was overwhelmed. For a moment, he simply watched Sherlock in wonder. He was amazed that this gorgeous, incredible man had given himself to John so completely. As he watched, Sherlock let out a keening sound and opened his eyes. "John," he whimpered. "John,
"I heard you playing your violin. When I was in the hallway. I... didn't knock right away."
When he pulled back, John looked at him in wonder.
John cowered against the headboard. “Sorry.”
After I completed my interview with Watson, I finally convinced Holmes to sit still long enough to answer a few questions. Watson disappeared into the kitchen.
John grabbed one of Sherlock's hands and kissed the palm. "I know." He let go and took hold of Sherlock's jeans again. There was a soft thud above him as Sherlock's head dropped back against the wall again.
John's heart leaped when Sherlock stepped onto the stage. He was dressed like the other musicians, in white tie with a black tailcoat. He'd combed his hair back, taming his curls slightly. He looked
John breathed a sigh of relief when he caught sight of Sherlock talking to the pretty dark-haired cellist. As John approached them, he could hear Sherlock saying, "Thank you, Molly. Your solos were superb as well. Very lovely." Molly began blushing furiously. She was attempting to stammer out a response when Sherlock caught sight of John.
John gently rolled Sherlock's stocking down. Sherlock squeezed his eyes closed, wincing as John prodded at his leg. "I'm sorry. I know it hurts. I'm checking the bone to see how badly damaged it is."
John:
"It's really nice out today," John said. "I thought I might walk around for a while."
When John was clean and his filthy clothes were in the washer, he went back to the bedroom. Sherlock opened his eyes and began to sit up, wincing. John rushed over to help him sit against the headboard.
The overture ended with a big flourish, and the audience applauded. The conductor had the orchestra stand to acknowledge the audience, and Sherlock locked eyes with John. He smiled a little, and John grinned back at him. Lestrade bowed and walked off the stage. The orchestra sat down.
Sherlock blushed even harder as his eyes wandered over John's body. "R-running," he stammered. "It looks like you were running."
Tuesday, August 23rd, 1977
He picked up his chair and set it next to the bed so he could sit by Sherlock's knees and face him. He set his mug of ale on the small table with Sherlock's and retrieved his plate. He began to eat. So did Sherlock.
John grinned. “Third, we are the only incubi to approach the human we’ve chosen in public rather than manifesting in their bedroom uninvited. This is my innovation, and Sherlock is still skeptical, but I’d imagine you appreciate a conversation and a choice rather than an ambush.”
John nodded. "Oh, yes."
John reached up and took Sherlock's hand in his. "Come back to the wagon, gorgeous. I've got supper ready."
How could he have said that? How could he be so
John was gratified to see the spark of attraction in his eyes as they swept over him. It always did his ego good to be able to hold his own next to Sherlock, with those sharp cheekbones and those mysterious eyes and those miles-long legs.
Before Sherlock could respond, he was out the door. When he came back in he was holding something under his arm. Sherlock realized with a sudden shock that that John had made crutches for him. They looked simple, but strong. John had clearly spent a significant amount of time rounding and smoothing out the underarm supports to make them more comfortable. Sherlock was overwhelmed.
John tugged at the cuffs of his shirt as he approached the will call window. He'd changed his clothes three times before leaving his apartment, eventually deciding on the shirt that he'd bought on Monday with his sport coat. He hoped that he'd finally found the balance between "nice enough to go to the Philharmonic" and "not trying
The rocky stream bed had been disturbed. John studied the disruption and determined that something had taken a fall down the bank. Something large.
mean it! I've never seen anything so gorgeous!"
“Oi,” John objected blearily, “That’s private.”
John wrapped himself around Sherlock. He rested his head on Sherlock's chest and listened to his heart as it pounded wildly. Sherlock's breathing gradually calmed and deepened. His heartbeat slowly returned to its normal pace. John closed his eyes and let himself drift toward sleep.
John gathered him into his arms despite the mess between their bodies. He stroked Sherlock's shoulder with his clean hand. Both of them were still trembling. John rested his cheek on Sherlock's hair. His heart felt like it would burst.
"Patience, John." Sherlock rolled his hips, groaning in pleasure. "All in good time."
Then he smiled.
." Sherlock closed his eyes and slumped against his crutches.
"John! I... I can't stop it... I'm going to -"
There will be an epilogue posted in one week. It takes the form of a newspaper feature story on John & Sherlock.
John smiled at him broadly. "Hi."
He looked up. Sherlock's eyes were wide with shock and concern. "John, I'm so sorry, I never should have asked."
John shook his head. "I wouldn't say that."
He grabbed his keys.
Sherlock, wiping the last of his tears off his face:
(See the end of the chapter for
John put his own unsteady hand over Sherlock's. "I love you so much, Sherlock."
. Sherlock's hands reversed direction, moving back up his thighs. One hand gripped John's hip while the other took hold of John's cock. John shuddered. "Ah!"
John smiled sheepishly. "To be honest, I could hardly pay attention."
Sherlock put both hands over his face for a moment. Then he reluctantly pushed himself up to sit against the headboard, whimpering in pain as he moved.
"I'll just... I'll be fine. On the floor. It's all right." John took his cloak from its hook and went to his flour sacks. He breathed slowly. Deliberately.
The man let out a full-throated laugh. “What makes you think I need to use the doors?”
John smiled wickedly and sat up. Sherlock huffed out an impatient whimper as John slipped out of his grasp. He pushed his legs back and forth for a moment, looking up at the ceiling. He grabbed the baluster again with more force than was strictly necessary and gave John a pleading look.
," Sherlock whimpered.
John pushed his shoulders back, lifting his chin and glaring at Sherlock. "Assuming you have the right to determine whether or not I date - which you don't, by the way - why not?"
Everything faded as Sherlock fell into a deep sleep. When he stirred, he could see by the quality of the light that it was after midday. He heard the rhythm of John's axe splitting firewood. After several minutes, the sound of the axe stopped. John's footsteps approached the door. John hesitated, then opened the door as quietly as possible and peered around it.
"Not going to happen, Sherlock! You're wounded. And you're a
Silence.
John smiled and got up. He brought over the food and fresh water from the spring. The afternoon sun was warm. Sherlock pushed the coverlet and cloak aside. They ate together quietly.  When they were finished, John helped Sherlock lie back. "You'll do better if we keep that leg above the rest of your body as much as possible."
His rich baritone, coloured by an outlandishly posh accent, was a soothing contrast to the intimidating leathery black wings rising from the backs of his shoulders.
John whimpered again. "Oh, God, oh,
Sherlock sitting astride John's thighs, leaning down to capture John's mouth with his own.
Searing anger surged through John. He breathed deliberately slowly and stayed silent to allow Sherlock to go on.
John, nodding reluctantly:
"Anything."
John shuddered. He looked into Sherlock's eyes, already lost. Sherlock put a hand on John's arse and pushed him higher. John crawled forward again. He rose up on his knees and leaned on the wall. Sherlock used the hand on John's arse to guide his hips down. Finally, finally, John's cock was at Sherlock's mouth.
The ambulance arrived quickly. John looked up as two paramedics came through the door. As they approached, they recognized him.
"I'm going to pretend I understood that."
John laughed. "Glad I could be of service." He tossed the spatula onto the counter. "Get in here. You're helping me make the sandwiches."
John let his head fall back as his anxiety faded. He let his body respond to Sherlock's touch, arching his back gently toward him. Sherlock hummed in pleasure and redoubled his efforts to kiss every inch of John's skin.
“I insist.” She rolled her eyes.
"There was no way you could have stopped that maniac!" Lestrade hollered, swerving around the corner, not too far away from the hospital now.
“I can’t find Rosie’s drawing.” His voice breaks slightly and he feels all of his composure slipping before him. John is the only one he will let see him like this, the only one who could possibly know what he is experiencing. After a moment, John stands on the very tips of his toes and pulls Sherlock down slightly so that his head rests on his shoulder. His fingers rest on the back of Sherlock’s neck and they stand in an embrace, freeing the tears that they had both tried so hard to keep in.
He exhales and presses his eyes together, a single tear dripping down his cheek. The swelling has gone down a lot since yesterday. I'm afraid to hurt him further so I am as careful as I can be.
“Remember Bluebell?” John asked, his eyes looking dazed as he looked up to the detective.
last week because she was drunk. And you keep letting her go out! And she’s out again tonight!” Mrs Watson clenched her jaw.
“My sincerest sympathies.” The doctor says to John. “We have a fantastic palliative care facility at the hospital.” He continues speaking, but John isn’t listening. All he hears is
The seconds ticked by, neither Sherlock or John moving an inch. It was John who made the first move.
“How was uncle Rudi’s wedding?” Mycroft asks before John has a chance to respond to Sherlock’s dad.
"I'm so sorry."
“Anger is clouding your judgement John.” Sherlock says as they make their way down to the pond located at the front of the hospital, a plain feature that doesn’t do anything to distract families from the fact that their relatives are dying inside the building behind them, or the fact that their parents and brothers and sisters are ill and injured.
brightest star in the sky. And on either side of it is Alshain and Tarazed- Falcon and Plundering Falcon.
His words confuse me- a feeling that I have been experiencing a lot of lately. "What for?"
I'm 38 years old when I lose him, my husband. He doesn't leave the world spectacularly, dramatically. He doesn't leave how I know he would have wanted to go, on a case or with me.
“He took that well,” John points out as he stands up, dragging Sherlock up with him. He straightens Sherlock’s shirt with his hand and smiles. “Better than how my dad would have reacted.”
"Since when have we done anything like we're supposed to?" He asked, a mischievous smile toying on his lips.
I am nothing without John. I need him and he's gone and I am alive. It isn't supposed to end up like this, yet, it has.
“What time will you be back?”
“I’m more of a morgue type of person. Hospitals always make you ask questions: will he make it? Will she pull through? At least with morgues you know there’s no hope for the person.”
In one swift movement Sherlock had successfully divested them both of all of their clothing until they were naked, both overwhelmed with the situation but neither one willing to make any more comments on the matter. After all, what else was there to say?
He knows the answer soon after because Sherlock lifts a shaking hand to his forehead and wipes again, this time leaving an even bigger smear. Then comes the pressure on his chest and
It was that day that John decided he wanted his father to die. It was that day that he started to be on the receiving end of his aggressive outbursts and violent tendencies.
"With beanies?"
I will miss him.
"I think we're ready."
I am alive again, just for that moment. We are one, as we always will be.
“Sherlock, just sit down for Christ’s sake. Pacing isn’t going to do anything.” Lestrade sighed, exasperated, tired, and frustrated. This wasn’t fair. Not on John, not on Sherlock, not on him who had been trying to catch the murderous bastard for months.
“Just slightly.”
“You got yourself in to this.”
It manages to calm me down but a new feeling is taking over me. My body is hurting so much, irritating and vexatious. Tantalising.
Never did I realise how wrong I would be to want that.
His eyes remain closed.
Carefully, I moved my hand so that it was cupping his cheek, caressing my thumb just below his eye. I nodded, too shocked to be able to form words. I could feel a tear trickle down my face and I finally managed to mutter out the word 'yes'.
“As good as I can be considering the circumstances. What’s happened with the shooter?”
what would happen next.
"Yes?" I say his name in the same way.
"I left it intentionally."
." He circled his tongue over Sherlock's nipple and was rewarded with a gasp and a shudder. "I think about you all the time. I
John turned and went back down the stairs to the ground floor. After he'd locked his apartment door behind him, he stripped off his sweaty clothes and showered quickly. He got back into bed and drifted back to sleep.
Sherlock huffed out a breath. "We'll be back on land by nightfall. I think you'll last long enough to make it there. Come sit with me, John. You'll be a little more comfortable."
“If someone touches them, do you... feel something?”
!" and began stroking Sherlock again earnestly.
The ship made its way into the channel. John was amazed by the way the land shrank behind them, the way the ship moved through the waves, and the way the crew worked at the rigging. He was thoroughly enjoying the experience. Until he wasn't. Nausea suddenly crashed over him. John vomited over the rail repeatedly, embarrassed at doing so in front of Sherlock. He held onto the rail, putting his head down on his arms between bouts of illness.
"We need a shower."
John pulled Sherlock past him into the room and closed the door. He turned, gripped the lapels of Sherlock's dressing gown, and kissed him thoroughly.
Sherlock's POV
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes."
Sherlock seemed unable to speak.
After a few moments, Sherlock broke the kiss, gasping for air. His hands were pushing John's chest upward. John stopped stroking Sherlock and got up onto his knees again, confused at having been pushed away.
Sherlock takes over.
Sherlock swayed, yielding readily to John. John used his grip on Sherlock to crowd him backward until he hit the wall of the entryway with a deep groan. Sherlock sagged against the wall as his knees began to buckle. John pushed his body firmly against Sherlock's. Sherlock shuddered. He whimpered against John's mouth.
"All right." Sherlock's voice sounded pinched.  John led Sherlock into the barn.
John pushed Sherlock's wet hand down as he positioned his hips to line his aching cock up against Sherlock's. He wrapped Sherlock's hand around both of them. He tipped his head back and moaned as he felt Sherlock's hand close around them. "Oh, Sherlock, my darling."
As John pulled away, Sherlock swayed toward him and John felt a surge of triumph.
"Your record collection?"
"You're utterly gorgeous. I want... I want to put my mouth on you."
"Sherlock?"
John's throat felt tight. "Yeah."
Sherlock smiled warmly and set the dog tags back down on John's chest. He pushed John's shirt farther back on his shoulders. "Will it hurt you if I touch your shoulder?
“See what?” Sherlock teased. He settled his body against John’s, heavy and hot. He nuzzled into John’s neck and inhaled deeply. He hummed in appreciation as he took in John’s scent.
John took Sherlock's hand in his. "I'm never going to leave you, Sweetheart. But that doesn't mean I'll never get angry. I needed to clear my head. That's all."
Sherlock finally took half a step back. He looked dazed, his hair riotous. John chuckled breathlessly. "We should probably call a truce before one of us actually kills the other."
John:
John divided the rest of the rye loaf, putting half on a plate on the small table next to the bed. He brought Sherlock a mug of ale as well. He drank down his own ale and ate his bread quickly. Sherlock watched him silently.
As John led Sherlock slowly to the back of the house, he worried a little about how his home must look to a prince's eyes. He had worked hard on his home and would have been proud to show it to almost anyone, but he thought it must look primitive to someone used to a castle.
Angelo beamed at him. "You interested?"
Sherlock closed his eyes. "John." He took a breath and let it out. He opened his eyes. "I will never tell you to stop." He stood up slowly. John's hands fell away from his arms. "How long have you felt this way, John?"
"Are you angry?"
Sherlock opened his eyes. They widened as John reached into his jacket pocket. John pulled out a small gray box and opened it to reveal a heavy platinum wedding band.
Sherlock lowered his head and looked at John. "This will never stop, will it?"
Sherlock smirked at him. "It's your own fault, you know."
me watching you. But let me assure you,
"I wish that were true. But, John, I tried to tell you yesterday. I'm... not nice. I'm rude, condescending, arrogant, dismissive. People don't like me. You deserve better. You deserve someone like you. And you deserve to know the truth about me before you leave your home."
Sherlock gasped, arching his back. His chest pushed up against John's before he dropped back against the bed. John's hands found their way into Sherlock's hair as he claimed his mouth in a scorching kiss. Sherlock moaned against John's mouth and wrapped his arms tightly around John's back.
John was mildly surprised at the word that had popped into his head. He had never described a man as "beautiful" before. Handsome, yes. Attractive. Good-looking. Once in a great while he might think "gorgeous." But beautiful? That was a first.
Several minutes later, Sherlock heard heavy footsteps outside the door. They stopped directly outside. Sherlock instinctively put his hand on his knife.
Sherlock clutched John's arse tightly as John got even harder. John tugged on Sherlock's hair, making Sherlock groan loudly as John started to come. John cried out helplessly.
John let go of his shoulder and shook Sherlock's hand. "John Watson." He stepped forward as he resumed massaging his shoulder. "Come on."
He splayed them out to give John a better look. “Filed down. I use them for pleasure, not pain.” He flexed his fingers suggestively.
As John took the bowl back, his fingers brushed against Sherlock's. He felt a jolt of electricity rush through his body. Sherlock was looking up at him with that amused expression again. John quickly cleaned the bowl and put it away. He put his cloak on and turned to Sherlock.
Sherlock stared at John for a moment. Then he did as John said.
A distant part of John’s brain was questioning the wisdom of allowing a demon to bind him, but he knew he’d already passed the point of no return. By the time John found his voice, Sherlock was kneeling between his legs. He had already stripped John’s t-shirt off and bound one of his wrists to the headboard. He had the palm of one of his graceful hands resting on John’s bad shoulder and was mumbling something unintelligible under his breath. A curious, tingling warmth spread through John’s shoulder.
John grinned at Sherlock. Then his expression sobered. "I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to stay another day."
" Sherlock yanked the door open.
Greg chuckled politely. “Yeah, just about.”
"You were rushing off to a meeting? You really didn't have to cancel..."
John turned his back and returned to his bed. He could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him as he slipped beneath the sheet and settled in.
Sherlock moved forward and curled up against John, dipping his head down to rest it on John's chest. He tucked his arm around John's waist. John wrapped one arm over Sherlock's shoulders and stroked the opposite hand through Sherlock's hair. Sherlock melted against him.
Sherlock pushed John down gently so he sat on the bed. "Don't care." He bent to pull John's shoes off, then sat next to John and started taking off his own shoes. "Take your clothes off."
John stirred. His head was hot and sweaty under his pillow. He groaned and knocked the pillow to the floor. The air felt cold on his damp hair.
Sherlock's POV
John leaned over the table. "Sherlock, this isn't easy for me, either. I
“Hold still.”
Sherlock's expression softened. "But what about getting married? Having a wife? Children?"
Sherlock was in a great deal of pain. He was very sore under his arms because of the crutches, despite the care John had taken to make them as comfortable as possible. His back ached. His right leg was strained from overuse. And his left leg... his left leg had swollen terribly. The skin was so tight he feared it would split. The thigh muscles were strained from holding his leg off the ground. But worst of all was the pain radiating in waves from his cracked tibia. Sherlock had tried to keep the pain from showing on his face so that John wouldn't worry. But now, with John's head resting against his shoulder, Sherlock let his face contort in agony. He still deliberately controlled his breathing, but tears began to fall past his temples and into his hair.
"I'm glad you did."
John laughed. He and Sherlock sat and talked until the cafe started to fill with customers for dinner. Their waiter had been to their table a few times asking if they needed anything before giving them up as a lost cause.
John tipped his head back to look up at him. "From our personal supply, right? Widow Hudson will have our heads if we raid her sales stock."
Saturday, June 27, 2015
John stepped back, taking Sherlock's hand. He picked Sherlock's dressing gown up with his other hand and led Sherlock to the bathroom.
John released Sherlock. He was still on his hands and knees over Sherlock's body. He watched Sherlock pant and tremble and took hold of his own cock. He began to stroke himself, sighing.
John let more of his weight press Sherlock down into the mattress. He allowed his teeth to pass over Sherlock's skin as he let out a low growl.
Sherlock turned and walked away.
John grinned harder. "Clara, have you met my sister Harry?"
John closed his eyes. "I've never dated a man."
John rolled his eyes and shoved Mike lightly. "Let's eat now, please."
John ducked his head. "Two and a half tours."
"I know. I've got you." John licked his hand, pushed it into Sherlock's open trousers, and wrapped it around his cock. He dragged his thumb across the head. Sherlock shuddered and moaned loudly in relief. John didn't try to make it last, knowing that Sherlock was already incredibly close. He stroked Sherlock steadily, twisting slightly over the head. Sherlock buried his face in John's shoulder, crying out, "John, John, oh God,
sorry. I was too hard on you last night."
Sherlock was examining the disc carefully. He looked up and gently handed the disc back to Angelo.
He was up the stairs in a rush. Sherlock grabbed the flint and the lamp. He locked eyes with John. John closed the hatch. Sherlock was in the dark. He heard John covering the hatch with dirt and leaves. Then John's footsteps retreated quickly. Sherlock lit the lamp with shaking hands.
2:30pm
"When should I be there?"
John's vision whited out as his orgasm overtook him. He cried out loudly, his whole body convulsing as he came. Sherlock caught him under his arms as his legs gave out.
you are."
John ran to his car and drove to Sherlock's apartment building as quickly as he dared. He took the elevator to the basement first, sighing in relief when he saw Sherlock's car in its spot. He pushed the button for the twelfth floor.
feet. He no longer wore his fine black suit. In its place was a ridiculous (yet ridiculously attractive) pair of black leather trousers. One hand was propped on his bent knee, canting his elbow up. His other hand dangled against John’s sheets.
"I've got some rabbit stew if you'd like."
Sherlock used his left arm to give John a little shake. "You didn't answer me, John," he murmured. "Do you want me to stop?"
Part 1:
"John, wait!" Sherlock pushed at John's shoulders. John sat back, panting. He moaned quietly.

"John, I don't know what to say..."
John had expected to finish embarrassingly quickly, but Sherlock was incredibly skilled at pulling him back from the edge of climax before he could fall. He thought distantly that it must be another of Sherlock’s many gifts.
Sherlock's expression had softened slightly. "I'll leave a ticket for you at will call. Saturday night?"
"Good. I'm going to lead you back to my house now."
“Is that meant to be better?” He scrubbed his hand over his face. “Full marks for creativity, I suppose. I haven’t heard that one before.”
John takes care of Sherlock and declarations are made - some of them en Français.
Sherlock is across the room and at John's side in an instant. He drops the gun and grabs John's hand, looking down in desperation at John's face. To his immense relief, John is conscious.
“And you think you know my desires?”
half a piece of bacon and a few bites of egg. When John finished eating and stood up, Sherlock retrieved the rest of his clothes and put his shoes on. He walked toward the door holding his jacket.
"Which one is it?" Sherlock asked. When John finished describing his building, Sherlock turned toward him. "Liar."
John was watching him. "Oh, God,
John squeezed Sherlock back. "I don't want you to, either."
"Do you like living in America?"
John murmured into Sherlock's ear. "That's it, Sherlock. Yes. That's
A sob of relief bursts from Sherlock's chest. He fists both hands in John's shirt and drops his head down between them, hiding his face against John's collarbone.
After a several minutes, Sherlock reluctantly put his clothes right and sat up straighter. He dragged his chair closer to the table and put his hand on John's shoulder.
"I won't change my mind, Sherlock. You're incredible, I love you, and I'm done hiding you." John stood up. He put a hand on Sherlock's cheek and bent to kiss him tenderly. When John pulled back, he locked eyes with Sherlock. He took both of Sherlock's hands and squeezed them gently. "I promise you, Sherlock. I won't let anything or anyone come between us again." He kissed Sherlock again, letting go of his hands to wrap his arms around him. Sherlock's arms came up around John's shoulders.
When the show was over and John and Sherlock were back in the car, Sherlock turned to John. "That was a remarkable performance. What did you think, John?"
John opened his eyes and reached for the stove. He turned the burner and the oven off. He then put his hands on Sherlock's chest and pushed him back gently. Sherlock straightened up, looking slightly disappointed. John took both of Sherlock's hands in his, lifting them away from his body. Sherlock's face was clouding over. John stepped around Sherlock and turned them both around. He started walking backward, pulling Sherlock by both hands.
"Just on the next hill." John smiled at Sherlock. "I told you you were lucky."
Confusion and hurt passed over Sherlock's face. "John?"
Sherlock Holmes was seated on a bench, facing away from John. He was looking intently into one of the trellises. John began jogging again, going the long way around to give Sherlock a chance to see him approach. He looked at Sherlock as he circled around the path. Sherlock was as impeccably dressed as always, even in the park. He had rolled the sleeves of his wine-colored shirt up to his elbows. He looked amazing. John felt self-conscious about his sweaty old t-shirt, but there was nothing to be done about it. He didn't want to miss the chance to talk to Sherlock.
. John gently pulled away and lifted Sherlock's head with both hands so he could see him. Sherlock's eyes were cast down. "Hey," John said quietly. Sherlock finally met his eyes. "We're just going to make each other feel good, remember?"
The audience quieted while the orchestra tuned. When they were finished, Sherlock took his seat. Lestrade walked onto the stage. The audience applauded and the entire orchestra stood. Lestrade bowed and stepped onto his podium.
." He squeezed his eyes shut again, dropping his head back against the door. "Please,
John dropped his arm. “Sorry. I don’t know what came over me.” He tilted his head, noticing that the ebony claws on the demon’s fingers were blunt, in contrast to his feet.
"Of course. In... my former profession... it was necessary to be able to communicate in several languages."
John stepped past him to the other end of the bench and sat down. "So, what are the bees doing this morning?"
." John's eyes were full of fire. He pulled Sherlock into a brief, bruising kiss. "I'll come back for you when they're gone."
John smiled broadly. "And I adore you, Sherlock." He stood up and went to put his boots on.
"And all of that is you?"
John gasped when he felt Sherlock's mouth on his neck instead. He tilted his head against Sherlock's hand to better expose his neck to Sherlock's attention. He put a hand to the back of Sherlock's head, tangling his fingers in his hair.
The battle he'd fought with himself over what to wear had been a nice change of pace from the one he'd had with himself over pursuing Sherlock. After two days, John was firmly holding his doubt and fear at bay.
that question."
John just shook his head in wonder. How could he be lucky enough to be with this incredible young man? He looked back out over the dock. His heart stopped. Two of the King's men were at the other end of the dock. John's hands gripped the rail tightly.
John stepped back. "Come on, then."
Part 2:
John's brow furrowed. "I'm sorry?"
John finally grasped Sherlock's cock gently and pressed an open-mouthed kiss to the side of the head. Sherlock sobbed in pleasure and relief. John took the head into his mouth and stroked it with his tongue. He moved his other hand to Sherlock's balls.
The morning was clear and pleasant. John jogged along Brush Creek before heading down Wornall and into Loose Park. On impulse, he decided he'd do a lap around the circular rose garden. As soon as he entered the garden, John stopped in his tracks. A huge smile broke over his face.
okay for you to believe that! I will have to find a way to make you understand how
..." His fingers tightened in Sherlock's hair.
John took Sherlock into his arms again and kissed him. "I love you, too, Sweetheart."
I asked Watson about Holmes's reputation as a formidable and exacting musician. "Oh, his reputation is well deserved. He's never been one to tolerate any type of sloppiness or laziness when it comes to performances," Watson answered. "Of course, there is more to him than that," he added. When asked if he might be implying that Holmes has a softer side, Watson demurred. "No one would dare suggest such a thing about the great Sherlock Holmes," he said with a wink.
John tilted his head. "Yeah," he admitted. He let a slow smile spread across his face. "But I don't give a rat's ass."
Suddenly, John had a handful of Sherlock's hair. "
“But I’d like to.” John rested his hand over Sherlock’s heart. His skin was still flushed and blood-hot. John looked up into his glowing green eyes.
Sherlock didn't answer.
When he finally laid John back down, John had no sense of how much time might have passed. Through the haze of his arousal he could feel Sherlock gazing down at him, no doubt admiring his handiwork. Then Sherlock was leaning away to open John’s bedside drawer. He pulled John’s box of toys out and tossed the lid onto the floor.
what I'm doing, John." He released John's cock and sat back on his heels. "Or did you think you'd gotten away with it?"
John watched as Sherlock stripped down to his underclothes and began washing. The candlelight played across Sherlock's body, catching in the droplets of water on his chest.
Sherlock was still looking at John, but his expression was blank.
." He punctuated the last word with a sharp thrust of his hips.
Clara leaned forward and spoke quietly. "Could they be any more obvious?"
John wiped at the sweat and tears on his face as he approached the edge of the roof. He looked out across the plaza. It was almost completely dark. The only light came from the streetlights and the occasional window. John's eyes were drawn up to Sherlock's windows. His light was on. John let out a tight, breathless chuckle.
!" Sherlock spat out. John ignored him.
"By you."
Sherlock's shirt fell from his hands. Sherlock let John pull his head back, moaning at the pull on his scalp. "It's not a tease if I follow through, John."
, John! You're
"Better."
stop!" He closed his eyes. He could feel Sherlock trembling. He took a deep breath and pulled back to look Sherlock in the eye. "Okay. I'm going to finish stitching this cut now. You're going to rest. And we're going to talk about this later when we're calmer. Do we have a deal?"
"I'm going to do some chores, cut some firewood. Sleep as long as you want. I'll be right outside if you need me."
Sherlock tilts his head down. Their lips are almost touching. John's hand slides into Sherlock's hair. They breathe the same air for a moment, neither of them quite ready to believe this is real. John smiles warmly. He pulls Sherlock in and kisses him gently.
John walked over to him and put a hand on his waist. Sherlock took a sharp breath. John put his other hand on the back of Sherlock's neck. "Yes, it is," he said. He pulled Sherlock down into a kiss. Sherlock melted against him, letting out a little sigh. John pulled back. "Come eat breakfast with me."
. He was going to have to get off the roof, no matter how sick he was of pacing his apartment.
"What did you say to her?"
The man held up a gold coin. "Take it. Forget what you've seen and move on."
Sherlock looked down at his notebook, clearly struggling with how to respond to that.
The smaller man spoke. "Yeah. The spoiled, selfish brat," he muttered.
Sherlock's eyes widened.
"I'll meet you there. Where will you be?"
Then John was standing directly in front of him. His hands gently took hold of Sherlock's face. "
..." Sherlock's thumb stroked John's cheekbone.
"I hope I didn't wake you," John said sheepishly.
"Yes. I understand why you were worried. I shouldn't have shown up unannounced."
"I look forward to it."
Sherlock was still for several minutes before he stretched his three sound limbs languorously. He sighed contentedly. He let a few more minutes pass before sitting up slowly. John had picked up the clothing scattered over the floor. He'd placed Sherlock's clothes on his pack. Sherlock put his underclothes, stockings, and nightshirt on. Everything else he stored in his pack, his cloak folded on top.
John woke before dawn. He no longer felt sick. His strength was returning. And he was ravenously hungry.
John shook his head. "I'm fine. I ate before I went out this morning."
... to me?"
"Sherlock." John leaned onto the table, mirroring him. "How was the concert?"
We can get tested tomorrow, but I won't take chances with your health."
Sherlock's whole body shuddered. He was still clinging to John's arms. John pulled back slightly and pushed his hips firmly against Sherlock again. Oh.
They somehow manage to manoeuvre themselves into the centre of the forest opening, feeling the cool air nip their cheeks as they move. John’s fingers brush against Sherlock’s cheekbone, delicately tickling the skin which has a blush edging its way quickly upwards from his neck. They are on the ground, John with his back against the soil, laying in a bed of leaves. His pale skin contrasts with the shades of amber surrounding him, and with every slight movement the leaves crunch beneath him. Sherlock is on top of John with his knees either side of his hips, hands digging into the earth beside John’s ears.
That was the last time John saw his mum.
"I'm so sorry, Sherlock."
“Hopefully this medication will kick in before I try to sleep.” John yawned and Sherlock knew exactly what he meant. No matter how hard John tried to disguise it, Sherlock knew that the PTSD was coming back. Exactly what he had feared.
“Yep.”
And that's when the realisation dawns on me.
There wouldn’t have been anyway to survive that, Lestrade thinks as his eyes remain locked on John. Up until that point the detective inspector tried to avoid eye contact with John’s face but there’s no use in denying what he will inevitably have to do. And as he looks, he gasps, and immediately turns his attention away to face Sherlock.
“I can come back later if now isn’t convenient-“
His arms began to ache as John held on to his mum’s lifeless body, watched as the colour drained from her face. “Sher-“ He couldn’t finish the name.
“John, the kitchen was on fire.”
There is a pressure on my shoulder and  realise that the doctor has placed her hand on it. I glance towards the hand, then back to her and force a smile to my lips. She leads me to one of the private waiting rooms and she gestures a seat for me.
Sherlock is suddenly there again. He doesn’t realise that he has left, but when he returns he has a cloth in his hand and he’s pressing it against John’s forehead to stem the bleeding. “It’ll need stitches.” Sherlock says, and his voice is calm, any sense of worry that he may have is disguised by the way his words fall gently from his lips. “I’ll call for an ambulance.”
“You need to tell me if you do, John. It’s very important-“
The next thing I heard was the crashing of the car into one of the houses along the road. I didn't care.
“Entry and exit wound. I imagine you’ll have some extensive damage to muscle and surrounding areas. Collapsed lung. You’ve a drainage tube- that’s expected. I’m sure it’ll be out in a couple of days. Nasal cannula- obviously you’re aware of that. And just about as much as you’d expect after coming out of life saving surgery. You went into shock and stopped breathing in the ambulance- never do that again, John.” Sherlock was the one clenching his jaw now, but he didn’t stop looking at John. It was more of a plea than a demand, and John was aware of this as he held Sherlock’s hand tighter and gestured him to come forward, which he did, and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.
"John," I say again but I am getting tired, needing to fall asleep. Keeping my eyes open is proving to be extremely difficult but I am determined to stay awake.
“We’ll help you recover and-“
"We may as well get it over and done with." John replied, never once taking his gaze away from the mirror.
Soon enough the medicine kicks in and it’s just the two of them. Johns asks Sholto to tell him what happened again.
I kiss the top of his head, not focussing on the fact that he no longer has any hair. Around an hour later, John has fallen asleep and I carry him back to bed, carefully resting his head against our pillows. He doesn't wake up until 14:00pm the next afternoon.
Mrs Holmes tuts and holds John out at arm’s length. “John, how many times do I have to tell you? Call me Violet.” She hugs John once more before twisting round and going back to sink. “Please, help yourself to as much as you want. Steven should be down any minute. Ah, Mycroft darling, could you pass me that glass over. I’ll pour John some water.” As Mrs Holmes fretted about the kitchen getting John his drink, Sherlock and John sat down at the table before helping themselves to some vegetables. Sherlock’s dad arrived at the kitchen shortly after and soon they were all seated.
“You’re an idiot. How do you think mother would feel if I had to tell her that you had died? Father? How do you think he would feel?”
"You can only be too safe, John. Now go before Sherlock leaves. Your father's not home at the minute so you should do
“I’m sorry.” John shuts his eyes as remembers the morgue. Remembers how panicked Sherlock was when he thought Culverton had the scalpel, when he was laughing at him. The fear that encapsulated his eyes was a vision John couldn’t shake and he took advantage of that. His vulnerability had never been more obvious and he
Sherlock returns and the gentle notes of the violin are replaced with Sherlock’s equally as attractive voice.  “Glass?” Sherlock asks, though he knows the answer. John doesn’t know why Sherlock asks but he never questions this out loud. Maybe it’s just because Sherlock needs the confirmation, or maybe it’s because he wants John to acknowledge what has actually happened. He can’t be sure but he doesn’t want to ask.
I shake my head. "It doesn't look promising."
The detective side stepped before slamming his forearm against Mycroft’s chest and shoving him into the concrete of the hospital wall. “John is in that operating theatre. I intend to be there when he wakes up.” And with that he stalked back into the hospital, back to the waiting room, leaving Mycroft behind.
“Hello?” John asks in a way unlike Sherlock had done just ten seconds ago.
He feels himself start to panic, and he knows that it’s the most ridiculous thing he could possibly do, but
“Happy now?” Sherlock asked, teeth gritted together as he looked at Lestrade. Mycroft’s lips twitched in a grimace as his brother looked at him, the
Her lips turn upwards but I can tell that she is pitying me. I am past caring. I take about thirty seconds to compose myself before I start speaking.
what was going to happen, John wouldn't have almost died. John wouldn't be in this hospital bed and he sure as hell wouldn't have had to face months of rehabilitation. When John didn't reply, Sherlock spoke up again. "You almost died, John, and that would have killed me if I knew I was the one responsible for your death. I can't lose you."
Shortly afterwards, he falls asleep again.
"I love you, you know that?" John asked. However, the smile which had previously plastered John's face disappeared and one lonely tear trickled down his cheek. Sherlock peered up at him, his ever changing eyes taking in the sight in front of him as another tear fell.
Fucking hell Sherlock. No one should have to go through that. See the most significant person in their life slip away in such a cruel manner.
I don't read them.
The pinks turned into purples which turned into navy which turned in to black. Soon enough the forest was pitch black and the only thing that could be seen in the sky was the stars.
“I’m sorry.”
“Are you really so stupid?” Mycroft rolled his eyes, exasperated. Every single time this happened, every single time Sherlock was hospital bound due to some ridiculous overdose, this was his response.
Opening his eyes proves to be more of a struggle than he ever thought possible because he just feels
"There we go." Lestrade says once I finally calm down. I ball my hand into a fist, frustrated at my own weakness. The chances of us having an incident on the way back to Baker Street is slim. I shouldn't be working myself up so much.
"Sherlock, I want to thankyou for absolutely everything. It's a lot for any 23 year old to deal with but you...you've managed it. When I'm gone I know that you'll be able to cope. It'll be hard, bloody hell if the situation had have been reversed I don't know how I would have handled this, but you've been amazing. So, if you'll let me do this." His heart began to race and his breathing became slightly erratic but by God was John going to do this.
When Lestrade tells me the extent of my injuries, I cannot be bothered to care. When he tells me that I received severe head injuries and that I needed life saving surgery, I don't react. When he tells me that my spinal cord was severed in the accident and that I shattered several vertebrae, I don't reply.
"We were engaged." I say to him, avoiding eye contact. "Three days before the accident, I proposed to him. He said yes."
“Will you-“
Despite the morphine that was shooting through his veins, John was in pain. “Do you want me to get a nurse?” Sherlock inquired- for the first time in his life he was unsure of what to do.
I remember the sound of the explosion, the way it came out of nowhere and pounded into my ears. We were overturned and there were men shouting, screaming for help, for a medic.
I snap immediately. "He's paralysed. I do not think that is doing well." The anger that I have felt at the whole situation is taking over and I cannot think rationally.
“Lestrade. If you don’t-“ However, Sherlock didn’t manage to finish his sentence as Lestrade pulled the handcuffs backwards, in turn bringing his arm back, and pushed him against the wall so that his face was pressed against it.
“Not good.” She responded, placing her elbows on the table and dropping her head into the hand which wasn’t holding the phone. “He told me something.”
It felt very different.
Lifting his hands, Sherlock gripped one hand to John's shoulder blade, his nails digging in and leaving red crescent shapes in the tanned skin. His other hand drifted lower until it was gripping John's arse as they moved together, their erections sliding together as they did so. John let out a low moan, his grip on Sherlock's hair tightening ever so slightly.
A mixture of oranges and reds and pinks decorate the sky, merging together to create one beautiful burst of calming colour. I turn my head around and a smile graces my lips as I see him, laying beside me at the edge of the lake, his toes dipping in and out of the water ever so slightly.
Lestrade quickly pocketed his phone as Sherlock entered the waiting room again. If there was one thing that he was certain of it would be that Sherlock would not be impressed with what he was about to say. However, he was under strict orders from the elder Holmes brother.
“John, you need to carry on going to therapy!” Harry slurred. She had turned up at his house later that evening drunk. “It will help you!”
Sherlock cradled John's face in his large hands again as he bowed his head forward, capturing John's lips in a passionate kiss, expressing all of his words through that one simple motion. John leaned into the kiss, allowing Sherlock to take dominance as his tongue licked across the pink expanse of John's lower lip.
"No, no, it's fine. I'm just...overwhelmed." He let out a small chuckle which soon turned into a hearty laugh and then Sherlock was giggling too, giggling so hard that he was struggling to breathe.
Sherlock was on the phone, explaining the situation to the paramedics. “Sherlock,” John says, the fright in his voice evident. His voice quivers and Sherlock knows that he’s trying to be strong, for Rosie’s sake, but he’s seen too many people die and doesn’t know if he can handle seeing another person die, let alone his daughter. “She’s asking where you are.”
They returned to the waiting room in silence and Lestrade sat down. To their surprise, Mycroft was seated on the chair in the far corner, legs crossed over and staring at the floor, thinking.
An hour later John was rested in a side room in Felstead Ward with Sherlock perched on a chair beside him. It was coming up to half past seven. “Visiting will be over shortly.” Sherlock pointed out, looking at the clock on the wall. Those walls. A sickly shade of yellow encapsulated all four surfaces, making the room appear even more dingy than it already was. A window overlooked the carpark and every so often, if the two of them were lucky, a bird would fly past.
John is a little way ahead of Sherlock and Harry still, so it is entirely unexpected to the both of them when John rips the curtain aside to gain access to his father’s bed. He looks weak and pathetic hooked up to various pieces of equipment but his eyes light up at the sight of his son. When John steps closer, Mr Watson smiles faintly.
Pulling away, John wiped his eyes with the back of his hand before turning his head up towards Sherlock. His eye is still bloodshot, the bruising surrounding it turning into a deep shade of yellow. The stitches are gone but he knows that a scar will be left. All because of him.
"It's alright, John." He whispered in my ear and the way he said my name made me tremble. I unbuttoned Sherlock's shirt, my fingers brushing against the dark hair on his chest and leant forward, pressing my lips to his in a kiss filled with so much want and need. Because I did need him, I needed him so much that it hurt.
Sherlock reflects back on the night of the proposal, remembers the sheer amount of joy he felt at something, just
“Rosie, I’m here. I’m here.” Sherlock hands over the phone to John, who shuffles slightly so that Rosie can lay in Sherlock’s lap. Like with John, Rosie burrows her head into the crook of Sherlock’s arm, curling herself inwards. Sherlock is rocking her on his knees, having found that this is the best way to try and calm her down. She clings tightly to Sherlock, refusing to let go even when the paramedics come.
“Please, come in.” Sherlock shuffled closer to John’s head so Dr Holden had more space to stand.
"For what?"
It's fucking sick.
"John-"
“He’s stable.” Sherlock averted his attention back to his partner and pressed his mouth to John’s hand.
"Dad!" John interrupted before his father could start the verbal abuse on Sherlock. The teen on the bed turned his head as he noticed the harsh, ragged breathing of his partner. John was bent over slightly, his left hand pressing to his damaged ribs in an attempt to subdue the pain. Sherlock could clearly see that it wasn't working. "Dad... just... leave him."
“Why-“ John breathes and wraps his arms around Sherlock, letting out a sob. “Why the fuck does he think he can do that after everything he’s done?”
He can’t sleep, knows that if he does manage to slip into a dream that it’ll soon morph into his daughters face, crying in pain. It’ll turn into Sherlock’s anguished cry as he holds his daughter one last time. It’ll turn into her skin, slowly becoming cooler in his palm as he clings on to her hand, hoping that all of this is a cruel game.
"I trust you, John." Their lips met again in another chaste kiss, just a quick touch of skin to reassure one another.
I don't want to accept the inevitable. I can't fathom my life without John by my side. But I know that it must come. And it does.
“I’m fine.”
You would think, wouldn't you, that it'd get easier. I've had to go through this once before. But then I had Mary. That was a fortunate turn out, wasn't it? She shot you and you almost died
John woke up God knows when, to the steady sound of beeping machines and someone pacing frantically up and down. "Sherlock would you please stop-" But before Lestrade could finish his sentence he was grabbing the detective by the sleeve of his coat and pushing him forward, motioning him to John.
"I love you... so much, Sherlock." A smirk painted itself on Sherlock's mouth as he pecked John's cheek.
After around five minutes of me embracing John, allowing him to free his emotions, his sobs eventually subsided and he pulled his head back slightly, although, he kept his arms wrapped tightly around myself. Gorgeous blue eyes glanced up at me, red rimmed and glassy from the tears that he was no longer allowing himself to shed.
I love him so much. It is so bloody difficult to explain how much love I have for him. Had for him. After James I didn't think it was possible, but it was. My God it was.
It seems like an infinity ago that we had that first night. Our bodies slick with sweat, our lips pressing together in a way that just seemed
Mycroft thinks again as he watches his brother’s ribs being crushed under hands that are trying to save him.
The detective looked at his landlady and he was graced with a sudden rush of empathy. He was aware of how fond of Mrs Hudson John was, and, additionally, how much Mrs Hudson cared for John like he was her own son. However, before Mrs Hudson had the opportunity to respond, there was a knock to the door and she was up, wiping the tears from her face as she made her way over to the door.
“There’s nothing you can do except be there for John. Even if you decide not to be, I will. I can’t expect he’ll want to be seeing his father and it’s up to you if you want to, which I expect you will going by your reaction to John going in there. But don’t condemn John for not wanting to.”
John clenched his fist. She was in no way the person to tell him whether he should go to therapy or not when she was the one who couldn’t even bring herself once to go to rehab.
I turn the corner and almost collide into Dr Pace who is walking quickly, a clipboard held tightly in her hands. She steadies herself and looks up to me. There is a spark in her eyes, despite the tiredness that is evident from the bags underneath them. She clearly enjoys her job, although she does get extremely tired. Immediately her lips take on a sympathetic smile as she says, "Ah, Mr Holmes. I was just coming to talk to you, actually. Would you mind if we go somewhere that is a little more quiet?"
“I highly doubt that.”
Sherlock proposed to me, two years later. It was just after a case in which a moronic criminal decided that it would be wise to try and kidnap me. Obviously Sherlock wouldn't allow that and the criminal ended up in hospital with a broken pelvis, three cracked ribs and a split lip. Plus a four year prison sentence.
Suddenly I can hear screams and there are people outside of the car, trying their hardest to rip the doors open. John has slumped forward, his chest resting on    of the metal that has pierced through his body. I am in complete and utter agony; my legs won't move, my back feels like it is being crushed and my head is spinning uncontrollably.
, surprisingly. So whilst you were having the time of your life I was holding mum as she died. She didn’t want to listen to dad and he grabbed her, but once he let go she lost her balance and she fell. She fell and she wouldn’t stop-“ John felt the tears threaten to spill over once more. “I couldn’t find it in me to tell the police that dad had done it. Sherlock won’t say anything. I know that we need him, as much as I hate to fucking say it, but we do. But he can’t do everything that he did and then think it’s ok to leave us without any parents. It’s selfish. It’s cowardly. So, Harry, I’m
My time with him has been tremendous. We understand each other in a way that not many people get to experience. It's one of those feelings that, even if you express it with exaggerated gestures and extravagant words, you will never truly show the magnificence of the time you had together. That doesn't stop me from trying.
The pneumonia came on within a few hours. One minute he was feeling as well as he could be, the next he was struggling beyond measures. Sherlock is at the hospital with him when he falls unconscious, not too long after his arrival.
“Thank you for being here.” Sherlock kissed John again before cupping his jaw and stroking his thumb once across John’s cheek.
It's not the first time that John's woken up in the middle of the night in agony. It won't be the last. It's 03:21am and this is the third time already, just tonight.
He looks at me now as if I may break. I already am broken, though. Of course, he did fix me at one point. The point when I didn't think I was able to be fixed, no matter how hard anyone tried. But he did. The ghosts that haunted me from the war didn't attack, just lingered, until eventually they dispersed and vanished altogether, all because of Sherlock. But I am being crushed, falling down again. Falling from such a height that even my true love will not be able to save me from.
Having decided that the session was over, John picked up his cane and limped over to the door. “See you next week.”
"Excuse me?" One of them asked, clearly annoyed that I was disturbing their conversation.
