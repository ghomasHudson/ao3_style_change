“Should I,” FRIDAY asked, almost gentle; Tony startling because it had probably been close to a minute of full silence and there were firebreathing jerks out there who did not care for his current breakdown at all. “Keep the suit waiting at the landing pad?”
“So you’re telling me,” Sam began slowly, voice growing more despairing by the second, “that the entire city’s thrown a party, and you’re in a
No clanks- and something tight and twisted in Steve’s chest eased up before he could even realise it. The three of them were standing around a screen that was beginning to play flickering footage- there were words droning on in the background, Zemo- oh,
There was another video listed on the sidebar, from a couple of months ago. Steve’s fingers guided the mouse, almost unfeelingly- he needed something older. Something reminiscent of better, livelier times.
“Then we keep working at it.” Tony twisted in the embrace, head turning around to look Steve in the ducked eye. Leaned forward and coaxed a kiss from those gentle lips, sharing his breath slow and easy, fingers weaving in silvered strands. His chain swung forward with the motion, Steve’s dog tags spinning lazily between their chests.
So......I didn't actually get around to the fully-fledged Steve/Tony. Honestly though, you had to be blind if you were reading it any other way XP I just couldn't find a way to organically introduce that with all the trust issues floating around the place. There will eventually be a follow up to this story though- the second of a series, and some seeds have in fact already been laid in this that will eventually come to fruition in the next, hopefully much longer work.
“We should.” Tom answered, like it was that easy. “And we don’t. You…still trust the goodness in others. Fight for people, without knowing if they deserve it.” A pause, almost like he knew what his following words would mean. Even if that was impossible. “You’re a good man, Captain Rogers.”
His fingers hovered over the armoured plates, their shadows long and slender over the metal – when something prickled at the edge of his consciousness. Red and shine and – and
The minutest flinch, at the name. Stark didn’t appear outwardly anxious, but there was a tightness to his sentences and movements. “He’s…there was another cave in. During the evac. Rhodey…got out but Rogers is still-”
“I don’t think you know how much. I don’t think anyone does.” Rhodey didn’t seem angry though. His tone was calm, no vindictive bite to the consonants as they left his lips. Unwavering, like stating facts of life. “You never actually were on a team, not even in school. Skipped through grades too fast, and even if the other kids invited you-you were too young to do well, and you hate being bad at things. Never even played a team sport. Too busy, too proud.”
“Morning FRIDAY.” He stretched his arms along the sides of the bed, rustling through the silk sheets. His toes uncurled, brushing against the fluffy down of the comforter that he’d thrown off his body sometime during the night. Everything was deceptively comfortable.
(Steve tells him he’s being unreasonable, that he sees farther and acts more proactively than any person Steve’s ever known. Tony doesn’t tell him that he stopped measuring himself by other people’s yardsticks a long time ago. Steve was a part of that lesson, after all.
His words made Tony feel like a stranger to himself. He tested a series of sounds to confirm his vocals were a pitch higher.  Looking at his risen wrist, he noticed his watch had slipped down a quarter length of his arm.
“Tony.  I have been expecting you for some time.  Captain Rogers, thank you for joining us.”  Strange nods at the both of them before leading them down the corridor.  Peter bounces slowly behind the three, and Tony sneaks him a single look back at him while the doctor is addressing Steve.
The Fairest looked like he wanted to push but didn't. He just pulled his glass closer with a sigh. Tony, not one to appreciate awkward silences, bounced back with a new question:
But the man shook his head. he got up to his feet and -okay he was, even more, taller now- peered curiously at Tony.
Cold hands gently grasped the Wizened and pulled him upwards. Tony titled into his arms, not really steady on his feet.
Widow stepped and sat next to him, nodding a thanks at Thor who slid a glass with some red liquid towards her. Tony was 97% sure it was blood. Darklings were creepy enough to do that. The other 3% leaned towards cranberry juice (because that was also a level of creepy in Tony's mind).
He looked at the Fairest at that who sighed in exasperation. But at least Barnes gave a small chuckle at the name.
He was put down on something soft. A loud booming voice that could only be Thor's announced he was going to fetch some covers. Carbonnel wanted to get up and tell them not to bother. He was going home after all. He wasn't going to just, fall asleep here. He could hold his liquor better than that. He wans't going to-
“Did you?  When you boarded this ship, did you really think you wouldn’t make it out of this one?  Once you save the doctor, then you can turn around and come back home. We can regroup, and we will take Thanos on together.”
Tony attempts to smile, but the devastation of the last sixteen trials makes his happy expression waver. He tilts his head downwards, teeth clenched and eyes heating.
“Just--tell me why you never told me.  You walked in when I was in the middle of a Binarily Augmented session.  Did you think I was reliving the moment before my parents died just for shits and giggles?”
Tony remembers the beginning of the third glitch.  He arrived the moment Steve had slammed his shield into his chest and managed to break his reactor. Watching the scene sent him into a panic attack, surprising Steve of that time off of his broken suit and over to his broken future, anger still driving him.  He had made a run for it, but that Steve had caught up to him and was confident Tony was another threat until Barnes reached him.
Minutes later, surrounded by iron limbs and pieces, Steve is ripping the faceplate off of Tony’s suit and gripping his shoulders.
).  Tony has yet to pick himself off of the floor, pants still swimming at his ankles as more of Steve’s cum trickles out of his ass.  He tries to stand, but his knees demand another minute rest. He bangs his head against the wall behind him.
“Come out of there, Zemo. Otherwise I'll pull you out.”  Tony glances at Stark as he passes, recognizing the confusion in his gaze and slipping him a sad smile.
“You’re making eggs with a hat?”  Tony nods slowly before turning to grab the salt and pepper.  Steve is already there behind him, pushing the two small grinders into his hands.
“So, what?  Since it never happened here, I'm supposed to forgot how by me leaving, you ruined yourself in grief until you put a gun to your head?”
“I understand your last visit here was memorable.  I can send you back in this timeline to try and correct the wrongs that transpired, but this Time Stone is not from this universe and may glitch.  My few bouts of time travel in this world were restrictive, but in the end adequate after a few attempts.”
“Plate, Cap.”  Tony sees Steve wince at the nickname before presenting a second plate.  Forks in hand, the pair take their meals over to the dining room table. Tony drops his dish in his spot and turns back into the kitchen, head halfway into the spice cupboard.  He returns and sits across from Steve, popping the small spice container open and sprinkling his eggs.
“Laugh? Make a joke about what happened to us, that’s your solution?” Steve drawled, glaring at him.
Ah. Tony's poker face was on point today because he managed to say that it was going well and that it just needed a few tweaks and twerks left. The truth was, he left it a bit behind when he learnt about Potts. He did his research on her and discovered that she was working for Stane Entreprises. Obie's society was a conversion of Stark's Enterprise, not long after 'Tony' died. (To be fair he didn't like to think about it. About how Obie turned his father's legacy, something that was handed to him and taken by someone else. Even if that someone was a part of his family). At least he managed to bounce after the tragedy. But that didn't explain why Potts could have a clue on Tony. So hedged dig back deeper. And by that, he meant hacking and pulling every string and statement on social media to link her to his past life.
“Ah, Thor! Yeah, he is. He’s a kind soul, don’t tell him I said that. Since you’re a dog person you would get along with him: he acts like such a puppy sometim-OW!” Tony yelped and pointed his pen at Bucky, while rubbing his side. “What the fuck you threw at me?
It was beautiful. Marble Stone in the form of a large muscular man sleeping peacefully. He was depicted lying on his back, large hands on his chest, the features completely relaxed. The whiteness of his skin making him stand out even more in the green of the place. Every strand of hair was carved in detail, even the lashes throwing shadows on the cheeks. And the size of it probably could rival Thor’s own height. What was strange was the fact that the statue had clothes on, pretty boring ones at that: a thin shirt and white trousers that looked more of a pyjama than anything else. They got slightly wet with the humidity, sticking on the chest and hard stomach of the piece. Well, it left little to the imagination and Tony had to give an A+ for that.  As he knelt by it, he felt some wyrd coming from the carved man. The changeling frowned at that. Did Fury let some changelings do some experiments on a work of art? Wouldn’t be the first time but to leave it here, where every meeting took place, It had to be important. He went to touch the cheek, trailing his fingers over the cold stone feeling no default in it.
The blond was alone, surprisingly, with just a glass for company. Most changelings were frowning back, looking at him like some sort of oddity that was out of place. The Wizened hesitated for a couple of seconds. He was leaving after all. Going to leave just to turn back and sit with Steve would break his dramatic exit. Then again... Steve was probably trying to fit into this strange community and no one was taking the time to see him. The Wizened sighed and turned towards him. With a new determination, He went to sit down in front of him, taking the man by surprise.
"He has a job and a life a part of being my friend. Plus I thought I wouldn't do any harm to talk to other changelings.
“Emails and phone calls count you cyclops! And you just threw me in front of a Werewolf? I didn’t even know werewolves were a thing!
So why not mix with other creatures or plain humans? Fury claimed it was for the wellbeing of his Court. If, for example, every werewolf learned about changelings, they will get curious. And since changelings don’t have much power or control over their wyrd, if they are seen as monsters or threats they won’t stand a chance. Better to hide from everyone, to concentrate on sheltering and grouping all of the changelings together. Barnes was the exception. Why? Because he had a pal changeling?
There was a long silence that stretched for minutes. Tony looked around him, no one was laughing. Barnes seemed confused, Steve was still frowning and Fury just nodded at the mechanic when his turn came.
"That's what I said. Anyway, it's very frustrating because I'm not a biologist or doctor so I'm probably gonna take me longer than expected. But I can just carve spell on where he is
He raised his hand, turned the doorknob and walked inside one if the most famous pub in the Changeling community. People inside raised their heads when he walked in, some nodding at him when recognizing him, others would just look away probably thinking it was just some random human. The mechanic walked slowly inside, glancing around, trying to distinguish the humans from the changeling. There were few normal fellows, probably just stopping for a drink and hide away from the summer sun until it’s bearable. As Tony was in the middle of the room a loud voice boomed behind him.
Tony Carbonnel actually looked at his client when he said that. Deigning to roll out from under the car he was working on. The man was dressed up in a suit, sharp and still in the middle of his workshop. He looked uptight at first glance and was glaring at the mechanic
“That’s the spirit! Let me take you to the back. The sooner the better !” the larger changeling offered and then stormed off towards the back of the pub.
“And you Rocky? Did you hang a bit in Valhölh?” He must be popular since he’s a new face in the pub.
He was holding down the Wizned wrists and pressed harder to underline his words. Tony felt the pulse in his chest beating stronger and faster. Blue light was seeping through his cotton shirt and a fleeting thought came up to him.
“He’s implying that you are a Fae’s favourite. He reached out fascinated by you while you were sleeping, didn’t he? Changelings aren’t usually easily impressed or influenced, only Fairest has that trait and it’s given by the Fae who kidnapped them.
“Of course! I just need to first make a prosthetic for you as a human, then one for you as a wolf, then I'll improvise a bit-
Finally, after a couple of minutes, three silhouettes walked towards him. Goose perked up and pounce from the changeling’s lap, digging its claws in his thighs as he did. Tony gasped and look at the scratches on his trousers.
“Maybe I did. And that would make the touching even creepier, let’s stay on that first scenario. I’m Tony, by the way, you’re the dude who needs my services?”
“Look, wyrd is weird, pun intended. It feeds on three things: logic, imagination and emotions. Logic because it needs to settle in reality. Imagination because you’re creating something with it. Emotions because emotions always fuck things up.”
and hasn’t played well with authority all his life, and wants to be the lone gunslinging hero of his own fucking show but that’s a mere blip on the landscape because who the hell would listen to that guy when there’s Captain America?”
The man in question lifted his chin, afternoon gold sliding over liver-spotted, still glossy skin. His dark eyes appeared russet in this light, something sure and implacable in that gaze. He was smiling. “I don’t need to leave the ground to fly, Tony.”
“Thursday.” Tony nodded, and then again as if he’d forgotten to do it the first time. He turned, motion sluggish, and slowly walked away, head bent and ponderous. Steve watched his back, all the way till he reached…his group of friends who’d been waiting for him. And watching. Oh golly.
“I have finished indexing and collating the results of the multiple searches you asked me to run in the afternoon.”
“I do, and his wife is there, and his kids are there, and nothing is going to happen to them.” Stark’s mouth twisted, like the assurance burned. Or the fact that he’d had to make it. “Or to him, if he goes back and keeps his head low. Besides there…there’s someone waiting there for him.”
“What name did you go by?” His feet settled on the floor, toe to heel, his breaths falling a bit more slowly. “Regina Phalange?”
Once upon a time, that might’ve rung hollow in Steve’s chest, a pang of longing. Now it nestled there, warm and soothing and protected from the burn.
“You’re twenty-four.” Sam attested easily, “I could give you my mum’s fridge. Pretty sure it’s from the time of her marriage, the miserly coot.”
“No bug and roach life detected…there’s barely even any bacteria.” Iron Man confirmed tonelessly. He was moving to the far left of the room, light getting smaller and more distant. “It’s unnatural. There was definitely something here.”
.” Peter goggled a little at this, opening and closing his mouth, choosing to respond a little frustratedly with- “But you still- I mean you can- people still-“ A throwing up of the hands, as if to say ‘
“Cute.” Tony said, almost flippantly, but eyes feverish in their fixation on the vibranium edge not two inches away from his memory-self’s throat. Then, practically bipolar in its sudden shift, from casual amusement to impatient rage. “But we aren’t here for fucking fantasies.”
displayed by these groups…thinking they know better than the people of the world how exactly they need to be saved.”
the conclusion you’re drawing from that is totally unfair, considering how I quoted two other poems literally ten seconds ago.”
“Isn’t the guy traditionally supposed to be the one sending the poetry?” He imparts this fatal blow, eyes twinkling behind glasses, and Tony snorts and fixes up his morning coffee.
It isn’t even that big of a deal anyway. Tony had seen a goon aiming for Steph from behind like the loathsome little coward he was, swooped in to intercept and got blasted into a subway station for his efforts. Yes, she’d already seen the guy, Tony, yes she could just have dodged the shot Tony, yes you’re a self-sacrificing idiot with no regard to his own safety, why the hell do you keep on doing this to everyone Tony
The silence dragged much longer this time, and Clint was surprised it dragged at all. What was Nat holding up her sleeve this time? What logic would she use to explain this? There had to be one, he was sure of it. He was ready to accept it and take it for scripture. There were too many versions of the truth-if he had to pick one, he’d pick hers.
“Maybe.” Another quicksilver smile, Stark’s eyes searching Sam’s own features with unerring accuracy. “You ever wish you’d done things differently?”
. And so Tony sits down and reads about a gentlewoman who was called on by death, who watched kids play, crops sprout and the sun set, watched life pass her by while she was seated in a carriage with Death and Immortality. The woman saw her grave, and Tony remembers an empty marble monument in Arlington, remembers watching Stephanie visit it with an emptier expression on her face.
“It’s there, both of us sitting on the middle bar of the A like a park bench, that he tells me, ‘I think I wanna marry MJ’.” The good-natured laughter so far quietened down; everyone’s gaze redirected to the couple in question – but Peter and MJ were looking at him, soft-eyed and perfect.
And Steph raises her eyes, and without missing a beat, returns: “I do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands that the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses.”
Steve Rogers, of the I-was-the-weirdest-thing-created-by-science, absently-patted-Butterfingers-on-first-introduction, considered-Tony’s-arc-an-interesting-accessory variety, was apparently arse over dick
The Stones followed, five throbbing points settling below his knuckles. They still felt lighter than the phantom weight of an arc reactor, chest-warm and leaden in his palm.
Ten minutes elapsed before Rhodey straightened up again, having carefully erased the sweep of his wings to draw them more sharply angled to the fuselage. “What do you think?”
“So I am sorry. That I had a part to play in letting you think, even for a second, that disappointment was the best you could do.”
His bark of a laugh was half surprise, half relief. Fuck, he’d forgotten how she used to ambush him like this.
And the quiet returned, vicious and silent and ever-encompassing, punctuated by the Black Panther’s cool, detached gaze. There was no judgement, only something curiously akin to pity. No, kinder. Sympathy, maybe. Like a look Steve might give a soldier who was stuck in the very hurdles Steve had long past.
The shadows began to clear, and Steve regretted every fucking thought that had crossed his mind before this moment. His heart was cold in his chest.
“Don’t worry, I’ll send you a writeup of what I’ve got on AIM. Well, send it to Rhodey.” Did his hands always feel this awkward, just hangin’ by his sides? Maybe the next Mark of the armor needed pockets. Though Iron Man had definitely not had much cause in the past to just… stand around and chat. “And whatever FRIDAY manages to dig up. You guys can yak about it over your next team movie night, or whatever.”
. Natasha’s voice whispered in his head-but something was better than nothing. He’d push himself up, swing his legs off the pallet he was on right now if it didn’t feel like he would keel over in place. Waiting was the best course of action right now. The serum was already at work, he could feel it in the deep itch of his skin, the twisting of his belly-working away, mending the tears. He wasn’t nearly strong enough to force a physical altercation with the man. So in the meantime, he’d take the information, unreliable though it was.
A very distant part of Tony’s head noted that Captain America was stumbling on his words – but he’d left Tony the shield, and maybe with it the eloquence. The artifice. Or maybe it was the other way round, and he’d taken the freedom to flounder instead – to trip over and pick himself back up, to let his voice thicken in powerless emotion.
Awareness sparked dimly in his mind, which was still lumbering somewhere in the realm of the subconscious. His legs felt overheated, entangled as they were in the blankets- but kicking them off seemed too much effort. He’d drooled on his pillow- there was a conspicuous damp spot and his lips were parted and sticky with it. From somewhere, he mustered the wherewithal to at least close his mouth, shifted his cheek away from the patch of drool and lay unmoving- waiting for sleep to reclaim him.
Tony hit the couch cushions shin first, then turned around on being released to flop down next to Steve, all the while attempting to straighten his blazer with meticulous fingers. God, forties handsiness was weird. Sometimes, Tony tried to imagine Steve and Howard engaging in ‘friendly fisticuffs’ and ended up gagging.
A loose wave of the hand, and holograms came to life in the space above the conference table-blue and transparent lines sketching out an overhead map of what looked like innumerable, small landmasses scattered over limitless sea. “Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Manus island. Some of the prominent locations with detention centres. A closer look at some of the islands towards east Guinea…”
He remained staring despondently at the platter as footsteps echoed to his side, Steve rapping him briefly on the shoulder as he passed by, “EMTs outside, c’mon.”
The cursor hovered motionlessly for a while- a strange blend of curiosity, grief and loneliness staying the finger. A quick flashback of the last recording proved to be more than enough incentive- Tony Stark standing at his table for an entire night, head bowed, trying to get himself to
into him with all of its metaphorical shoulder-setting glory – the impact thudding through bone as it jolted back into place, pain radiating through muscles gone loose and watery...the kind that made you gasp with the relief of it, the kind that flared white-bright for a second before ever-so inexorably beginning to fade.
“Because.” Steve repeated, and those eyes had never looked less like a liar’s. “Because you are my friend.”
And Tony watched Captain America walk away, gravel crackling underfoot, silhouette bleeding into the sun. Air flushed his lungs in deep, steady breaths – though his heart still thrummed, high and anticipatory.
“Someone like me?” Steve had already risen half-way through the passing minutes without realising it-he pushed himself up all the way through, palms pressing hard for support against the pallet. He didn’t want to be lying down for this. He didn’t think he could bear it.
, just like it was supposed to be. But then Tony asked one, small little question…..and somehow all the words, all the voices in Steve’s head had nothing to say. Nothing to say at all.
“Sorry platypus.” Tony murmured. If DUM-E had fallen and couldn’t get back up, he’d be whining about it forever.
call.” And Steve didn’t even know why he was pressing this. This had been his major worry ever since he’d first heard of the Accords- yet this tiny detail was all-encompassing now. “You promise that
She’d left her sketchbook behind in the workshop-he sneaks the page between her drawings of the New York skyline and a half-eaten apple. He doesn’t ask JARVIS when she reads it, doesn’t care to eventually see her reactions. Doesn’t know if she ever will. But it’s there, waiting. In case she might ever care to.
“Aftershocks.” Rhodey corrected. “The big one hit an hour ago. The areas are ‘too remote’ for the armed forces to help, they say. Not immediately. So they’re sending us in.”
Tony has heard it all, the litany of it. Peggy, Bucky, Dum Dum, Brooklyn, the alley where I got my nose broken, the hospital where my mother brought me up…and he knows it’s a never ending one.
Too small to be a flinch, too expressive to be anything else. Tony watched Steve’s shoulders tighten, like he was bracing himself, “Did you read my–”
having fun, it got him antsy. Steve seemed to be not expecting him to leave. And, uh. What was up with that?
do that. So he psychs himself up, tells his terrified looking reflection in the mirror to deal, and goes up for dinner.
There was something trickling down from Natasha’s temple – a thin line of scarlet mingling with the trail of tears. He didn’t know how close to the truth it was. He’d never gotten to see the bod– he’d never gotten to see her go. His voice cracked with the thought, a cleaving strike right down the middle, “I can’t do this without you.”
“That I lived in Japan.” FRIDAY responded demurely. “American companies, labour outsourcing, you know how it is.”
He rested a hand on the cool ceramic of the basin, fingers unconsciously digging into the spindly cracks on the surface. The other damp hand ran down his side to slip into his right trouser pocket, finding what it wanted with ease. It was the only thing there-he never brought his phone along when he dropped in on Peter.
He turned around, taking a solid two steps before Steve spoke to his back, words carrying despite the downtown Manhattan clamour and a quiet voice. “I wouldn’t press if it didn’t feel like… you wanted to come back, sometimes.”
Sam’s wings curled out in reflex, stirring the still, muggy air in a graceful flap. War Machine had turned his face away, booted clunks thudding through the ground as he turned toward the black horizon. Steve…
to. Because what do I hear- after the punches have long been thrown, hits landed, words spoken, sides picked.” Another mirthless exhale, Clint shaking his head from side to side. “That Tony screwed over the Accords like he should have long ago, and flew to Siberia to
He was tired. Sleep would be nice, but the greyish white ground looked so uninviting. But all would be fine. Someone was coming for him. No more fighting, screaming, punching….strangling. He could sleep. All would be fine.
Steve stared at the helmet, the doomed words making their way out of his mouth forlornly. “I don’t understand.”
“Again, Rogers.” Tony’s voice was deathly quiet. “This would have been a hell of a lot more touching if you hadn’t pulled shit that indicated anything
Tony leans over, and flicks the cover of the folder open. Steph’s features are still pulled into a glower, marked by ill-disguised frustration (over a freaking bagel. Really, this was just getting ridiculous), but she chances a look down. Then she looks again. And keeps looking.
“Nah.” Tony said, and didn’t bother to smile in reassurance. But this wasn’t a lie. It wasn’t a lie. “Nah, I’m good.”
Natasha looked at him for several seconds, unblinking. Then, like releasing a dead weight on Clint’s twisting heart-a small burst of air puffed past her lips, bitter-fond.
“Tony.” Came the response, and Tony snapped his mouth shut immediately because that tone meant Rhodey was trying to
And here was where he had to thank Sam again, because it would have been more than a little humiliating to ask Tony to clarify what he meant by that. But there was no time to think about that, because words were brimming up frantically in Steve’s chest-
Except it had been over three years since he’d met a cocky blonde breezing by him on his morning jogs, and Steve was a lake of still water before any op. Always had been. Sure, his mind could be churning up and falling to pieces on the inside, but he’d disciplined his body too well. There was nothing restless behind Steve’s motions now except the very
, but somehow couldn’t seem to escape past the blockade in his throat-because he liked to be honest, and watching a man you didn’t know for ten hours
“It’s nothing new.” His tone was low and controlled, the way it got when Rhodey was trying to breathe normally. Tony didn’t know that about him, before. “Fleets of boats, crossing hundreds of miles of ocean to get to safety. Well, I say fleets. More like a procession of rickety wooden corpses that capsize more often than not.”
“We can prepare,” Steve fists his hands by his sides, so as to not reach for Tony’s trembling ones on the kitchen countertop. Everything around them is night and still, but for the flickering of the bulb overhead. “We’ll be ready for them when they’re here.”
Steph’s watching him, and it’s like her eyes have been tracking his entire train of thought. “And you say you don’t get poetry.”
And she was also far more forgiving of his vices. “That’s not what a good head of R&D does now, is it.” He dropped onto the couch, jacket sticking uncomfortably to his skin, left hand darting to the side table to pick up a stylus. “Now go occupy your servers surveying the world for trouble. And processing the latest upgrades in the armour. Being my nanny is far too much of a waste of your brilliant abilities.”
, heading straight for the Arctic shelf. Natasha’s mouth curled slightly, an affectionate smirk as if she could read his mind. “Serves you right for setting such a good example, hmm?”
“Punk.” Tony muttered, a little huffily. You know what he needed to do? He needed to buy out this stupid game and pay off the stupid millennial who’d developed it and
“You’re off Manus, if that’s what you’re asking.” The man…Tom, for now, dragged the stool over, wood screeching against cement. He settled his bulky frame into it heavily, poor illumination catching against deep-set eyes. “Still on Papua New Guinea though. Don’t worry, you’re safe.”
Steve faced him, not even a full yard away, both dark and colourless against Mekong’s turbulent skies. Tony hadn’t heard his following footsteps, though he must have followed. He just stood, unspeaking, while water scored past and bleached the lines of a face, a profile that just seemed…bleak. Apathetic.
.” before he threw himself into the same well of memories he’d just clawed his way out of, except this time he had control. Just to prove he could, despite fear and trauma and hurt and everything else, the reckless bastard.
From there though, the progression of Steve’s thoughts was almost inevitable- the poorly lit scenes flashing before his eyelids, Howard’s face crumpling as it was smashed in by a metal fist. Steve’s chest squeezed in pain at the memory; but for perhaps the first time, it wasn’t because of Bucky’s impassionate face, or horror at what his best friend had become. He saw another friend’s life brought to a merciless end, effortlessly charming, fiercely intelligent, and grieved; because while Bucky’s head had been slowly being erased of all traces of Steve, and Peggy had been getting married- Howard Stark had been sending expedition after expedition to the Arctic determined to keep Captain America alive.
“Lila.” Sam voiced, quiet and considerate. Another lightning-in-a-bottle smile. “Hey, we all make our sacrifices. Don’t beat yourself over the head for it.”
Rhodey snorted. “How old is that movie now, forty years?” His hand was still moving unerringly over the page: long, straight strokes. “And you know it isn’t just that. They give me ten requirements, I’ll give them…five extra features on top of that, max. Someone asks
“Another panic attack?” Tony nodded, moving back under the spray. He handed Steve the soap and washcloth and let the supersoldier bathe him. He ignored the soft kiss on his thigh as Steve scrubbed his legs.
Sam clapped his leader’s shoulder.  Bucky came forward, gaze wavering between the bedroom door and the floor.
Warning:  a dash of consent issues.  Nothing happens, but it's obvious Steve is yearning and Tony is conflicted.
Steve repeats his apologies from the Quinjet, detailing when he should have told Tony the truth about his family.  He stops his rambling after he shames himself again for his failure as a friend. Tony pulls back far enough to capture Steve's leaking blue stare, mouth turned downward but his eyes a bit brighter.
Unbetaed. I am running up against the deadline, so let me know if you see any issues and I will correct. :)
When the spinning stops, Tony opens his eyes to the same dark passage in the bunker.  Steve is gone, and Tony digs his nails into his palms, pain staving off the sorrow lodged in his throat.  Peter is still at his side, eyes focused down the hallway.
“I believe she noticed the difference in Mr. Stark’s form and hoped to assist him in a more confined environment.”
A combination of delayed footfalls and uneven dragging makes its way closer.  When Tony sees a clean-shaven Steve Rogers hauling the Winter Soldier’s battered body, he tries to retreat.  The roughed up blonde spots him before Tony can take more than a few steps backward, and he pulls his broken friend behind him.
Pepper found herself being towed to the door with a heavy arm around her shoulders.  Once they reached the entrance, the supersoldier leaned down so his mouth nearly grazed her earlobe.
Tony wakes up to heat and misery.  As he moans, the warmth recedes and Steve's sad face comes into focus.
“Cap. Are we seriously in Wakanda?  I can tell by the tech in this room that they have some serious vibranium stashes still socked away.  Also, sidebar; where the hell was I? They said I have gaps in my memories and lots has happened since my BARF demo.  You okay there, Steve?”
I apologize for the delay!  I ended up writing two different short stories rather than updating this.  Now that I have finished that series of upset and agony, I am back on track to work on this one. :)
Tony cleared his computer screen and reached for the stack of files, unfolding the first report as the door opened.
“Absolutely.  I am putting down fifty dollars that Tony will throw at least two mugs at Steve if he ever has to go through a menstrual cycle.”
“We’ll finish sweeping the area.  Go clean up our banner boy.” Tony tries to not scrunch up his nose at Clint’s suggestive tone.
OH I am so sorry y'all for the long wait.  I have been half-way done with this chapter for a while now.  In the last month I (1) got a new job (YAY) and (2) started studying for my next exam.  Welp.  But since then I've planned out the next three chapters of this story, so there's that.
The ragged man gave Tony a long look.  His eyes did not quite meet Tony’s, but the fear in his gaze sent a shiver down his spine.
“The fact that SHIELD is under a different regime is not yet public knowledge.  I have shared certain details with necessary parties, including Ms. Potts, so that they were made aware of your situation.  Extortion also does not apply as we are not looking to make an exchange.”
They stand in the kitchen together in silence, staring past each other and seeing other people from other lives. Steve eventually makes his way over to Tony, taking the smaller man in his arms.  His chest clenches when he feels the initial resistance to his hold.
“You should have never been there, kid.  If I hadn’t given you that new suit, you might have survived.”
“Whenever Rogers demanding proper attire makes me weak in the knees, we need to timestamp last lay.”
Peter is sitting next to him on his bed, holding one of his clammy hands as Tony tries again to steady his racing heart.
Wanda passed Tony a pair of her jeans as well as a t-shirt and a set of undergarments still in the packaging.
“If he’s right about those weapons-” Tony rounds on Steve who’s following his down the enclosed staircase.
Barnes and Rogers are standing next to each other by the expansive window in the laboratory, staring over the lush land of Wakanda.  Tony tries to give the two some privacy, but an unknowable force won’t let him stray far from Steve. He settles on a bench next to the set of supersoldiers.  Peter sits next to him, swaying his legs in front of him.
“You know Steve can't mix fun with business.  He also sucks at playing pretend to avoid intergalactic complications.”
“Mr. Stark flew his suit to meet you, Captain. I would have expected he would have left in the same manner.”
Tony wishes he hadn’t looked up.  Steve’s face is worn and tired, but he has that stupid hopeful light in his eyes as he gives the exhausted mechanic a small smile.  Tony opens his mouth and stops, eyes darting to Peter. Peter gives him a little wave and gestures toward the approaching supersoldier.
Tony can’t help it--he looks back over to Peter.  The young man walks to him, kneeling in front of his seat and pressing his fingers into the wrist holding the letter.
She grabbed her heels and took the elevator.  Tony tried his best to school his upset, but he loses his nerve and rushes forward blurry eyed when his best friend turned the corner.
“He requested to be put back under until the HYDRA brainwashing no longer works on him.”  Peter pops up and walks over to the window. Tony decides to follow suit, ignoring how Steve’s eyes follow his movement.
“You deserve this.  Everytime you let those damn Accords stop you from saving lives, this abuse is the least you deserve.”
Tony closed his eyes as those strong hands started massaging his scalp. He felt soap suds slip down his neck as his head was moved directly under the flow of water.  The memory of periodic drowning back in the cave with his chest sparking made Tony tense and put distance between them. Steve let him retreat to the corner of the stall, out of reach of the showerhead, chest heaving.
“Not entirely.  But I can recall pieces.  I have a feeling I'll remember more as time passes.  Do you?”
Steve swears his sternum cracks as a sharp, stinging pain claws as his chest.  He reaches and holds Tony's thigh still underneath the hospital covers, careful to keep his grip under control.
“Old habits tend to be difficult to suffocate.  Maybe you want to complete the Stark set.” Barnes noticeably tensed, dropping Tony's glare and staring at the frayed paperback in his lap.  Any guilt Tony may have felt for upsetting the broken soldier was buried beneath his rage as the familiar taste of bile crept up his throat.
“Pete, why are you here?  You said yourself that you-” Tony eats the rest of his words, sitting down at his bench and picking up the closest tool within reach.  He ignores the hovering teen as he pulls up a new schematic for his nanobot suit on the holoscreen and gets to work.
They get the plane up in the air before getting off his gear. Steve remembers the small manual latches at each hip and flips them open to receive an armful of shivering Stark. T’Challa wraps several provisional blankets around the pair as Steve keeps Tony pressed to his chest.
“He now appears to be a she.  I expect our visitors may have done something to cause this gender swap.  We should try to contact them before they venture too far from Earth’s orbit.”
“Woah woah, wait. Half of the universe?  Is this?” Stark’s breath hikes with Tony's slow nod.  He looks over at Rogers with a wide expression, taking a step forward before he stumbles. Steve catches him around the waist and keeps him up.
“You’ve imagined us?  Having…?” Steve closes the entrance of the Quinjet before turning to face Tony.  He pulls the top part of his Captain America getup over his head as he approaches the other man.  He reaches forward an touches the top of Tony’s jeans, curling his fingers underneath the navy and into the skin above his hip bone.
“While I enjoy their appeal on other people, boobs appear to be horrible.  I can already feel the back problems built in with these bitches.”
Steve placed a heavy hand over Tony's. He entwined their fingers as he leaned to rest his forehead on top of the shorter man’s dark curls.
“I’ll be fine once we’re down in the shop.  You’re going to start drooling once I show you all of the new settings for your web shooter.  Karen mentioned you used to bitch about there being too many choices, so I updated her to be bustier and better and ready to please so she can help you default to the best--what, webbing?--based on your situation.”
Tony continued to type away at the small keyboard, tugging every so often at the access card around his neck.
They share another smooch and smile before Steve lets Tony rest, plans already in the works and making them both better, happier men in the end.
“And that is exactly what I would want to hear you say.  God, I am pathetic.” Steve presses a kiss against Tony’s forehead before his hold on the smaller man tightens.
Wong watches him watch Peter.  He says nothing as he walks Tony out.  He stays on the front porch and watches the red and gold suit soar away.
“The minute they figured out that scheme, I would be put back in the blender and iced again, then HYDRA would go behind Steve’s back and have you killed.  Better to have an unhappy supersoldier than no supersoldier at all.”
“Then don’t say it.”  Ignoring the oil on his fingers, Tony’s inhales his first slice before stealing the entire box and sitting on top of his work table.  Rhodey comes and sits next to him, leveling his stare with the genius’.
“Please.  Don’t leave me here again.  Go back. I won’t fight you.  I can’t, Steve.” Tony cannot stop his pleas.  He reaches a hand up and tries to hold Steve’s, but after the briefest contact with the rough skin the blonde recoils.  He knows Steve sees his tears before he turns away and continues toward the exit.
“I need to talk with Steve.  I know I'm not allowed to use your cellphone, but there's a landline in the living room.”
They took the elevator down to the common area.  Tony wrapped his arms around his midsection as he glared down at the tiled floor until the doors opened.
Tony sees white as he starts jerking harder into Steve’s hand.  He comes hot and heavy all over that palm, and his sight starts to bubble back slowly until he can see the pleased smile on his tormentor’s face.
The brunette stills his cheek as Steve leans forward, pressing the blade against his face.  Steve narrows his eyes as he swipes the razor down. The short gasp following the movement makes Tony curse.
Tony will not admit how much Peter’s refusal to join the Avengers affects him.  Instead, he is quick with his smile as he takes a knee and proposes to his CEO in front of dozens of reporters.  Dear sweet Pep just returns his smile with a roll of her eyes and says yes. Tony sees Steve in the herd of press workers and decidedly ignores him as he answers a few easy questions from the crowd before leaving the way he came with his fiance.
“Yeah, especially if it’s that special time of the month.  Pray that you never have to experience a period.  You for sure would lose your shit.”
“Nothing good.  Zemo showed us the footage of the Winter Soldier from that night. Finding out that you knew made me lose it.  You left and don't come back until it's too late.”
Steve soaks up the warmth in Tony's brown eyes to calm his frazzled nerves.  He gets up from their bed and starts to change, shot still ringing in his ears.
When Tony meets the other’s eyes, they scream of promises and forgiveness he knows he’ll never find.  Spinning on his heel, Tony goes down rest of the stairs, tapping his access code into the terminal with a wavering hand.
“Steve.”  His words fell flat.  Bucky reached out his metal arm and shook his leader’s open palm.  Tony stared at the silver limb, his body turning cold when his eyes fell on the crimson star centered on the man’s shoulder.
moment, thanks to destruction and mayhem (compliments of gods and aliens, which really does sound like a title of an '80s B-rated movie).  Now back in his own space, Tony groans as he throws a wrench between Dum-E and U.
“I'm going to go talk to Pepper.  Just--keep me up to date? He'll self destruct at this rate if we let him.  Rogers, you should probably check on him in an hour or so.” James took the elevator after he saw Steve nod, figure hunched as the doors shut.
A light tap on his back makes Tony turn out of Steve’s hold until he’s semi-focused on the teen behind him.  Tony watches as Peter’s mouth moves, but his words don’t reach his ears.
The redhead leaves after giving Tony a long look.  Tony takes off his tie, jacket, and shirt slowly, then stares down at his naked torso.
Tony tries to smile for Steve again and fails.  He leans forward, wanting to steal another kiss from those bright, pink lips before reality sets back in.
Tony had not realized he had crossed the room until Rogers restrained him, pulling him to his chest and locking Tony’s arms at his sides with that stupid sad look in his eyes.
“They're gone.  They warped out of comm range. Vision is attempting to contact Thor for some assistance.”
“They...engaged in intercourse.  Had sex, I mean.” Steve is blushing and turning his head away from Tony’s gaping visage.
“Unfortunately, yes. It seems Captain America Steve Rogers may be compromised. You need to report to Director Fury, as he's the only set of eyes restricted from these materials.”
Peter is up in a flash and shadowing the mechanic’s every movement.  Tony rubs his hands, noticing the ash covering his fingers doesn’t smear.
“So this is literally a rehash of what HYDRA was doing seventy years ago. Make guns from power cubes and alien tech.”  The words left Tony’s mouth before he could consider stopping them. He automatically started tapping his arc reactor with his overgrown nails, groaning weakly when he recognized his tick and stilled his fingers.
“Can’t be the outfit, since this isn’t the first time this has happened.  What did I say?” Steve leans his face closer until they are cheek to cheek.  His shortening breaths dampen the outside of Tony’s ear.
“Haven't been able to sleep very well knowing my Nazi ex-boyfriend shares the bed.”  Tony got a glare and stony face as a response. Steve looked like he wanted to say something, but he instead turned back to the stove and killed the gas.
But Steve has already rounded the counter.  Tony tries to flee, but he finds himself being wheeled around instead with hands on both of his shoulders.  Steve starts to say something, but the words seem to get lost in his throat, and now he’s looking down at Tony’s sweatpants and--
“You tell me.”  Tony yanks off the damaged faceplate and turns toward the supersoldier.  Steve winces as he stares at the left cheek. Tony sighs.
“I--shit. No. Thanks.” She gave him a small smile before retreating from the bathroom. Natasha walked over to him as Tony stared at his reflection.
“Maybe was a long time ago. Now, you need to get your shit together. Tell him the truth. And sign those damn Accords.”
“That’s it?  HYDRA will take over SHIELD, and then what?  Launch those helicarriers and murder anyone some software deemed a potential threat?”
“Almost.  Something about me makes those closest to being family want to betray me.”  Tony shared a small smile before he eyed Steve as he sat in the armchair across from them.
“It’s definitely some advanced form of conditioning.  HYDRA used the Tesseract on him when they captured him back in 1945.  I was stationed there in case things started to go south before they finished the procedure.  Three days later, Steve came out spouting HYDRA rhetoric and plotting their global takeover.  They faked his escape so he could go back to base and begin to put their plan into action. Thankfully he went down in the Arctic not too long after. But once SHIELD located him, HYDRA got their claws into him again to make sure he was still loyal to the cause before letting him loose in the world to start his mission again.”
Tony’s hand was released. Rogers left the kitchen, only stopping shortly at the front door, face turned away as he spoke.
Several cries and and groans later, Tony starts stretching himself with two fingers.  Steve pulls out of his mouth and pushes Tony down on the floor of the jet, sucking on his fingers before replacing Tony’s.  He manages three over the next minute as Tony pushes against those thick digits until he sees stars.
Tony locks himself in the workshop’s small bathroom and stands under the steaming pour of water until his skin is pink and irritated.
The teen disappears from the room so fast that Tony has no idea where he went.  Steve stops once he’s a few feet from the other in the kitchen, now close enough to see the food on the stove.
Steve turns and looks at his husband. Tony has his arms locked by his sides to stop his body from shaking.
“Yes.  No.  Does it matter?”  Standing, Tony makes his way out of the common room, Peter at his heels.  He hears Steve make more demands, but he ignores him and pats the lanky teen on the back with a shit-eating grin.
“I granted you amnesty.  You’ll be getting that vacation you wanted over the next week at my safe house.  Not close to the ocean, but the scenery is nice. No one around to bother you.”
“Good news?  You're still pretty.  Looks like your hair's getting longer as time progresses.  You sure you don't want assistance? I know you've taken off many women garments over the years, but putting them on requires a bit more finesse.”
He hears Yinsen telling him to get up and go, but he stays down. He hears his mother begging for him to survive, but he can't move.
“About damn time.  Now, leave. I must escape this timeline to not further contaminate it.  Speak with my counterpart on the eventual side effects you may encounter.”
“Let me reassure you. This ruse will not work. No matter what you plan, I will stop you. Now let's rewrap your hand before you hurt yourself.”
“Stark.  He’s blocking our exit.”  Steve turns and the two supersoldiers look at each other before the maimed one looks back at Tony.
Steve screwed his eyes shut as the remembrances flitted by- the last burst of warmth he’d felt towards Tony Stark, watching that MIT presentation video (not quite right, there had been that aborted gush when he’d realised those were
“I promise.” He said, and it was hard, but he did. He trusted the Avengers; and if Tony said that a situation didn’t need his involvement- well. He said he needed Tony to keep him on the straight, and for once in his life, he wasn’t going to be a hypocrite.
“Tony, I- I knew it, I knew you would-” Memory-Steve sounded disbelieving, amazed. Steve wanted to punch him in the face.
Two figures- red and blue, red and gold. Sparks flying in all directions as the shield caught the full force of the repulsors- Steve could still recall the faint sense memory of the metal warmed by battle shuddering under the pressure in his hands. He could remember every move as it played out in horrible definition on the screen- every blow flung, every desperate parry, every harsh pant, every groan of pain. What he couldn’t recall was the visceral imagery of it all- he’d never been in the position to observe, caught in a battle for friendship and loyalty, betrayal and vengeance. He hadn’t gotten to pause and see the cold Siberian sun gleam off titanium alloy, the burnished leather strapped over dark Kevlar, the hard sheen of arm plates.
But it wasn’t quite a freeze frame, because Tony Stark had stepped out of the shadows, somehow, surveying the scene. Instead of the three piece suit he wouldn’t seem to be willing to be glimpsed out of these days, he had a tank top on, old and worn. Grey sweats, goosebumps peppering bare, lean arms. Bare feet too- and as he stepped closer and closer to the main players, frozen in time, the littlest toe of his right foot dipped into the pool of blood by Bucky’s head.
Steve moved closer. He could feel the heat steaming off the floor now, the thunder of dancing shoes hitting the boards in tandem vibrating in his chest. Hear their strained, exhilarated breaths rush out of their lungs, pouring into his ears over the trombone solo.
on the screen. Hell, wasn’t super-serum eyesight supposed to be impeccable? Did those pixels need to be in such close vicinity to Steve’s Grecian nose?
...more than 20k, and they still haven't officially re-met yet. I think you guys are getting a sense of how slow this slow burn is going to be :P This fixing-job is hard, guys. But half of next chapter is going to be just Steve and Tony, actually interacting with each other, so there's that to look forward to XD Comment if you liked!
Missiles…they bored past metal and scored through Chitauri skin and imbedded splinters into flesh and bone and exploded and- even super healing was hard pressed against such a....modern, technologically superior foe. Steve remembered seeing those missiles in action for the first time- another video like this, shaky and grey, tiny little objects whizzing through the air, leaving ghostly smoke trails and embedding themselves into the arms and legs and guts of terrorists in Gulmira. Tony hadn’t cared to spare those lives.
“We’re not children, Rhodey.” He wanted to sound constant. Unaffected. But a thread of inexorable tiredness leaked into his words anyway. “Can’t let a dispute risk the loss of lives now, can we?”
themselves with it, played pretend, thought that by snapping on suspenders and waistcoats and flowery dresses for a night, they could be…they could
“There’s nothing to be scared of, Tony.” And Steve’s jaw softened, lines of severity melding into the sunlight streaking across his face, eyes glimmering in faith and voice ringing steady. “Not when I know people like you.”
She looked beautiful – and it had never seemed to strike him more, not even when she’d glanced up at him through Natalia’s doe-lashes and he’d been a dying bastard leering at her bikini shots.
“Army’s here ahead of schedule.” And the shell was back in place again, features compressed into the flatness of professionality. “You need to grab your plane, and get out of here.”
“I…I know.” Steve tried, and failed, to peer over the Wakandan king’s shoulder to the doorway behind, which…what? Led to hallways and corridors and ten staircases which may or may not lead to the room that Bucky was being kept secure in? It was ridiculous.
“I did, Steve. We all did. And I wouldn’t have chosen differently. You told us that ‘we fight’, and we did.” Clint smiled, quick and mirthless. “But that was it, wasn’t it? We didn’t
He would have answered yes. His first impulse was probably always a yes. Pepper was a fixture of his life. This was a chance to get their friendship back on track- possibly even get back on the way of rekindling things. More Pepper was always good.
Tony jerked back in response, dark eyes widening for a moment. They scoped over Steve’s own, for an infinite second.
zip, because the guy had never obeyed an order in his life. “Not even because of what I told you six months ago?”
“Sorry.” A quick, perfunctory curve of the lips, playing at a smile. Then back to a featureless canvas, tone calm and inscrutable to match. “Got lost in thought, for a minute.”
Braced for a repulsor to the gut, he stayed still in breathless defiance – only for his eyes to widen at the all-too-familiar whirr of the shoulder flaps opening up. Mounted short-range missiles… those took three point two seconds to arm, in the Mark VII. That was…
“I like you in the black, anyhow. The fitted one, with your red tie.” Steve propped himself up on his elbows, eyes blinking languidly to half-mast. (Tony was happy to report that age had done nothing to curb Steve’s, ahem,
“You…don’t mean that.” Bucky’s voice. Not lifting in the end, not even the slightest. Not even bothering with hope.
When Tony lifted his head next, mostly to blink through the blurriness – the workshop was silent. Crap, missed the solo.
Steve blinked. His t-shirt was a couple of shades lighter than his eyes; unlike the shirt he was wearing on the night ULTRON went berserk, which matched those deep blues perfectly. It was the last time he’d seen Steve in civilian clothing… no, the time at the farm.
“Chatting with Mr. Patel at the bodega three miles away. Helping Wanda control her powers.” It was like feeling the dark give way, lightness stealing in – till his vision was wrecked with it, till keeping his eyes closed was no longer an option. “Morning runs with Sam. Sparring with you.”
Something slipped into his hand, warm fingers working their way into his own gaps. Steve squeezed against the pressure, breath escaping just a fraction more lightly. “Did it hurt when you went down?”
The day he first thought of the word, he checked on the status of the tracking chip T’Challa had slipped into the phone Steve had sent to Tony. He hadn’t entirely approved of it- it was a massive invasion of privacy, even more so considering the recent turn of events. But the same sanctimonious self that had written out that letter, convinced himself that Tony was proud (which was true) and wouldn’t call for help even if he needed it (which was also true), and that Steve had to have some, however miniscule a chance of tracking Tony down against his wishes if that was what was needed (which was one of the biggest fucking lies and presumptions that Steve had ever had the audacity to make).
“Couldn’t give less of a fuck.” The reactor light gleamed off the whip-sharp curve of whitened lips. Stark offered up another smile for the gallows. “Do you guys make up scenarios? Imagine ways in which things might have gone, hypothesise?”
“Or.” Ross parsed out, slow and thoughtful. “We make an example of one of the richest, most powerful men in the world. Successfully incarcerate
Betrayal- something in Steve’s head repeated again, caught in infinite loops, wild and thrown-off. He fumbled the phone, it slipped past his sweaty fingers, catching the end of the bed and tumbling to the floor- “Fucking
So no. Not a surprise at all. The ceased motion, or the rapid turn. Sam couldn’t see the thin smile Stark was sporting in the darkness, but it made its presence known. “I do.”
“Almost at the end of it.” Steve murmured. Weapons from eras long past hung on the walls, carefully maintained. There was an early 19
–but not anymore. Maybe it was decades too late, but he had people to step in for him now, people who’d shed blood and heart and sinew so Bruce could live his life for himself. The thought made Tony’s breath stick in his throat, the warmth that had been gently stirring in his belly since the beginning of this conversation expanding into something bright and living. “Who’d have thought they’d get so protective of our gentle giant.”
Tony was at the same workshop bench as last time, the real, present time Tony. The one with the unhealthily dark skin under his eyes, the tremors in his hands, the one who somehow looked more ragged and run-down than the Tony Stark recoiling from blows in battle. Coffee mugs scattered around a table so piled up with bits and pieces of machinery that the metal top was barely visible, holograms flickering weakly in the background, the blanket from the night before pooled on the floor. It looked like he hadn’t moved since then.
“What?” the werewolf asked, eyebrows rising. “He asked, I delivered. I know the whole folk story is that we infect people but that’s bullshit. We are not a disease. Plus not every kid born from a werewolf line has werewolves capacities.
The left arm of Barnes was missing from the shoulder. He bowed slightly his head in salute. Maybe he was a knight of the Court’s who lost his arm for their safety.
“Damn, indeed you’re not an easy one. You’re a beast then?” he was slightly confused. It would explain the wolf form.
That answer clearly distressed the Fairest, his pale features turning whiter and covering up the gold band with his other hand. Being loved by a Fae was worse than anything. If They loved you, there is a chance They will come looking for you at some point.
"Ugh, call me Tony, we're all changelings here. And I don't, but Thor's food is neat so it's a good place to hide." he answered, plopping a pastry in his mouth.
From the shadows that made her clothes, she pulled out something. Tony frowned at it and took it carefully. It was the picture of a very pretty redhead. Looking defiantly at the camera with the same intensity when she had met him. He turned it between his hands before asking wearily:
He was dropped with a laugh. Thor took advantage of his height and ruffled the older man’s hair, leaving it standing up and filled with static electricity.
Well, he did have it. At first he was just talking about random stuff with Steve but every time the glass emptied he took another. Then another. The random subjects turned into small debates about baseball, then it turned into Tony talking about wyrd and toaster. Finally it ended on Bucky's order and by then, the Wizened well kept up appearance got a bit dishevelled. He has now managed to lose his shoes (don't ask), was sitting on the ground with other's customer's napkins and was trying to explain to Steve the mechanics of wyrd with the prosthetics. His drawings and calculus were incomprehensible but Steve tried to listen and participate a bit.
Alas the more he thought about it, the more he was hesitant. Even as they’d set the date and tools, they haven’t said much on what they wanted for him. He hated that, not being able to know what they had planned for him.
"All the more reason to let me in peace here no? Fury must be glad, he has all his pets in one place.
Steve and Tony looked at each other before sending a scathing glare at the Widow. The heck was she talking about? She ignored the glares and turned away to pull a chair out for herself. Tony knew what to expect next. She was just going to wait here until she could give her message and then leave among the shadows. Since she didn’t just say it and left the second she introduced herself, Tony guessed it was just for his ears only. He got back up on his feet and brushed off the dust on his work trousers. He really hated those shadowy messengers. At least she didn't chatter like Agent Coulson. God does that one blabber until he gets a response from the mechanic.
An hour later -so he wasn’t as nearly finished as he thought, so what?- the mechanic was walking the duo out. Widow hadn’t said another word even if Bucky had tried to get her attention in and out of wolf form, showing off his muscles when he could and earning eye rolls from the changelings. But it made the atmosphere bearable after the nearly-fighting between Steve and Tony.
The pub was bustling at lunchtime. Valhöll had a little menu for anyone who wanted to take a snack or a little lunch. Most changelings only came here to drink away their past and worries. To be fair, Tony was no stranger to this habit alas that was not his purpose today. Since the place was busy, he wasn’t on the receiving end of glares and whispers from his folks which was a nice change. He could see some humans chatting happily among themselves and sometimes mixing with changelings, unaware that they were in the main buildings of the Court. Tony could see some of his pairs happily talking back but the majority just stayed away, uncomfortable. The mechanic slipped past the crowd to reach the bar, he needed a drink. Or two. He hoped no one would come up to bother him because he really wasn’t in the mood. Luckily, no one wanted to talk to him anyway.
Broken toys? That was his work Fury destroyed behind his back. It was not him being childish, it was him feeling betrayed.  It was the fact that he didn't ask or didn't even try to talk to him before going behind his back. He wasn't going to forget that easily. Widow was right in one way, Fury didn't see them as pets, he just was their King. That meant he gets to act without caring about the consequences.
Opening a door and he slipped inside a maze of corridors and doors. Tony, when he first arrived here, learnt the hard way that the place was enchanted to guide people forward and away as Fury’s wishes.
“It is such a pleasure to see you back so soon! Have you lost weight? You feel lighter than last time…”
“So Tony! How is everything? How's your shop? Although, with how hardworking you are, I know your customers must leave satisfied!
Tony saw that all screens had turned on and hands made of cables and wires had started to crawl around them. He blinked a few times, surprised at himself, he knew the workshop reacted to his moods but it never turned violent against something. He noticed Dum-E rolling around, letting out a long beep worriedly. The mechanic waved at him to back off and the claw lowered itself, obedient. Steve and Bucky looked at the place brimming with wyrd and Bucky let out a sigh. Anxious but still admirative.
Goose narrowed its slit pupils at that sentence before giving another sound of outrage. The wizened could only imagine the many orders and insult in it. Then, to his surprise, the ginger cat got up and rubbed himself against his legs. Tony felt his fear and anger seeping from his limbs, he slid down against the tree and let the cat settle on his legs.
Two large arms circled the newcomer and squeezed him against a large chest. Tony yelped and tried to break free but the hug just got tighter.
Bucky’s panicked voice couldn’t cut through them. What he could only see was those blue eyes, staring into him and he stared right back. He wanted to kick his ass but thankfully he remembered that this dude was made of marble and he would hurt himself if he tried.
Getting up to his feet, Tony sighed, conflicted about what to do. The only positive thing in saying “yes”, to visiting the Court for a special command, was that he’ll get to pass by Valhöll. It had been a while since he visited other changelings and old friends. But there were too many negatives in falling back into their lair. He always had mixed feelings about the Court. Their intentions were all for helping the changelings who survived Arcadia in creating a new life. Yet, they had something else behind their mind in harvesting all these lost souls under their wing. Also, Fury’s an asshole and his cat was even worse. So. There’s that.
Chastised, Tony didn’t comment back on it. The King may be right but at the same time, his workshop felt specifically like
"Well..." Tony glanced at the people surrounding them. "You're not doing a pretty good job at it if I may.
“That’s for the ‘dog-person’ comment. Don’t push your luck Carbonnel.” the wolf warned him, half-serious.
He didn’t really believe that though. He thinks of Thor in particular, who is always smiling and trying to lift people’s spirits up. Even Tony himself could be a people person if he wanted to. The wizened realised that was all he had since he didn’t like any other changelings. (Or, if we were honest, he didn’t bother to try to know and like any other social being. Thor managed to get through because he couldn’t stop even if he tried.)
And just with that, the tension broke, Tony let out a laugh. Yeah. Yeah, he was pretty badass. He gave a “Ha, see?” look at Steve but couldn’t get the man to look back. The Fairest looked exhausted, his eyes gazing aimlessly at the ground. Frowning, Tony opened his mouth to try and snap him back to reality but another voice cut through the silence.
“Money. I’m probably going to drain myself in enchanting his arm and you want to leave me with just some mundane money? I’ve got already many clients to pay my rent,
“It is good that you’re here among us again Tony. You should consider coming back to our neighbourhood!” Thor suddenly said, slowing down to a stop. “This was made to be our home. All together, changelings need to be with each other.
The voice was soft and feminine, making their head snap where it came from. It belonged to a slim silhouette all draped in black who seemed to appear out of nowhere. Black pantsuit, heels gliding without a noise along the concrete floor towards them, she was like a character out of a black and white film. The only touch of colour on the newcomer had was her red lips and scarlet hair that fell at her back. If Bucky perked up at the pretty lady appearance, Steve and Tony recoiled a little. Her eyes and nose were non-existent. As if someone had taken an eraser and rubbed out the details. Sure there was a bump where a nose should be and a slight cavity for where the eyes had been but that was it. Just smooth skin and yet, she moved her head as if she was taking in each of them. It was clearly unsettling. Tony envied Bucky and the fact that he could stare at the illusion instead. For changelings can see the damage made by the Fae but no one else can. The Wizened narrowed his eyes at her. If she was there since all the confrontation without any of them noticing her, she could be a Darkling. Darklings are partially made of shadows, Fury being the best example. She seemed to feel his gaze and sent him a smile that looked mischievous and sharp at the same time. Yeah. Definitely a Darkling.
“Sorry big boy, I’m here to deal with the boss. But after I’m done with him, why not. Nothing better than getting drunk in the middle of the week.
“Whatever. Now that we know Mister Rock-of-Wonders is not my client may I know for who am I here for?” he drawled at the King of Changelings.
Was it possible that people were untrusting because he was a Fairest? Tony also had some prejudice against him but that didn't stop him from talking to Steve. Is it because he usually hang out with Bucky and they don't feel like mixing with a human too? (So far only Tony and Fury (and his little spies) knew that bucky was a werewolf and not just a regular human)
“You’re Carbonnel?” the browned haired man asked, a large smile on his face. “Name’s Bucky Barnes, they said you’re the best when it comes to tech and prosthetics.”
He's shy? No that couldn't be, especially after he saw him confronting him back in his workshop. Still, the Wizened have to admit that it was slightly strange: he has all this handsome marble creature thing going on and he didn't have a crowd of groupies around him? I mean, there is yourself? Which didn't count. Nope.
The thought of Jarvis smiling at him made his chest ache with pain. He wanted to have his old friend back. He was…
He cut himself and sighed. As if he was weighing if the price of it would be worth it. What he actually said next, sealed Tony’s decision to accept the deal.
“Means I’m the least important.” the mechanic chuckled darkly. “Wizened are experiments that worked or failed. But hey, it’s not the worst.”
“I mean.” the Fairest let a smirk appear on his lips. “It’s not like I didn’t make the same jokes. And he is making your arm. Fury had sung your praises when he talked about you. Will you truly be able to link the arm to his shifting?
“You were taking too long.” she uncrossed her arms and rested herself against the wall. “I am here on behalf of Fury, as you have probably guessed.
"If the neurology of the living being could sync with my wyrd and therefore engage with the process of shifting then you'd have the perfect prosferics.
“Well, I got a good one for you. I’m gonna need an arm that can shift with me when I need to be in wolf form.”
He felt some of the clients turn to glare at him as he said that. He didn't bother to spare them a glance as he downed his drink. He felt justified in his feelings, and even put himself in the same lot: he was not a kind man. Pushing away people and leaving as soon as he could to shield himself away. Not matter how much Thor insisted to talk or making him feel welcome. Even the whole situation with Jarvis is just him indulging in a selfish fantasy where he could feel human. No. He didn't deserve the warmth of others. Though he had to admit, when Tony arrived he had appreciated the elemental care and smiles. It made him feel at home. But Valhöll can't and shouldn't be home. It was more like a twisted version of Hotel California. Some danced to remember, some danced to forget. And oh, how many of them tried to forget the outside world in there.
“Virginia Potts. She seemed to be looking deeply into you, a bit too deeply. Since she was around when your fake died you might have a little visit from her and it’s better to warn you about it.”
“Do I? Maybe you’re right. Maybe it’s just a bit presumptuous to think you know me after the second meeting.
“We are ready to offer a good price for your services. More than mundane money, Carbonnel.” the changeling said with a pointed tone, grating Tony’s nerve.
“But in all, you could say I’m new around here.” he reached for his lost arm, as if it was still there, before letting his hand fall.
Now he has to deal with all of this. At least there was alcohol. Plus, when Thor came back with a homemade burger, Tony begrudgingly agreed that it looked and smelled pretty nice. Moreover, after the first bite, he wolf it all down, because it was a really good burger. He tried to ignore the satisfied smile of the Elemental as he finished the last of his crumbs.
The world tipped backwards and Tony felt the ground slam against his back. The pain shot through him and he let out a yelp of surprise/pain. His workshop rumbled then roared to life as he cursed and squirmed under the large mass. He was not having this!
“Why do you keep calling me a fairest?” sighed the man, obviously confused and annoyed at the choice of words.
And with that last sentence, he stepped aside and showed him a large door covered in vines, nettles and brambles. Tony raised and slipped his hand between the stinging leaves and thorns, feeling it slowly wrapping itself around his limb. Then his shoulder, then his face and neck. The unkempt weeds finally wrapped around him and pulled him to the other side of the wall.
“So tell me Bucky, how one is born a werewolf?” Tony asked while taking the measurements needed for the werewolf’s arm. (And also desperate to change to tone of the conversation.)
The last thing he managed to see, was Steve's hand putting something soft over him. The ring on his finger shining softly in the light of the pub. Only then slumber took him.
He was looking for a sign of wyrd, a sign of his time in Arcadia. Normally, changelings had a particular physical trait that only over changelings could see (due to the fact they were all modified and filled to the brim with the Fae’s magic). Thor had his long blond hair that fizzled moved and twist as if the wind was always caught in it. if it wasn’t the hair it was the eyes that turned white when he would get too excited and the air would grow heavy around him.  Tony…
He got up, Steve and Fury were back with a third man. Tony narrowed his eyes as he approached. Pale skin and But this one… Dark hair tied in a bun, soft blue eyes, pink skin that actually looked like real flesh.No floating or heavy aura around him. Did they-No Fury would never allow that: no way that it was a human. Maybe if he comes closer he’ll feel something. Steve was standing close to the newcomer, smiling softly at something. Smile that slide off when he turned his gaze back to Tony who felt a tad offended.
Bravado back, Tony unbuttoned his shirt down, revealing human skin and chest hair at the poor Steve who looked back up, dumbfounded and eyes wide. Tony laughed at his expression.
As the conversation continued and change, Tony learned that Bucky and Steve were childhood friends. It made the mechanic raise an eyebrow and Steve choose this moment to jump in and explain.
"It's not evening! It's mid-afternoon-" he stopped when he saw the streets outside basking in the sunset. He looked back at Steve who had a smug expression on his face. "Well, when you put it like that. BUT it's not nighttime yet, so drinks should still be on the table.
The Wizened jumped at the loud voice and then felt his ribs being crushed under strong arms. He tried to squirm away from Thor’s… Heavy affection but after three seconds he just let himself go limp. Maybe he’ll think he’s dead and the elemental will let him go.
Tony raised an eyebrow and didn’t bother with a response. Instead, he turned back to Bucky, now really curious.
In his panicked state, Tony noticed that there was a ring on the man’s wedding finger, pulsing with energy. Realization crashed on him as the creature pulled him close to stare a him.
“From the two meetings what I’ve got was, you joke around about what happened to us with Them. You stay away from the Court and push away other changelings who tries to open to you. And you don’t help unless you’ve got something to gain for yourself.”
The Wizened was pacing around Fury’s office, much more normal than the garden. He had left in an instant when he learnt about Barnes but Fury brought him to his office to convince him to stay. The only reason Tony willingly came and didn’t just flip the King the bird was because too many questions were turning inside his head.
The “living thing” sneered at that, the grimace not breaking that unnatural beauty he had, before letting him go. Tony felt back on his butt, in a very ungraceful manner, before rising to his feet huffing, embarrassed.
Tony raised from his chair but a large hand landed on his shoulder, stopping him from jumping on the redhead. Thor glared down at both of them, his usual smile gone to scold them.
Hope you enjoyed it! If you find anything confusing don't hesitate to tell me! Fells like I'm dumping too much info in each chapter xD
He turned his sight back to his plate. Before he could mourn the absence of food, a little plate of mini doughnuts nudged against his arm. He tried to look nonchalant as he pick one up.
"Fancy seeing you here! It seems that we are bound to meet each other even when we don't want to!" he exclaimed as he sat in front of the man who jumped slightly caught off guard. "You want a doughnut? You can only pick one, the rest is mine."
Well, that was tempting: the Court did have interesting trinkets in their safe. But he wanted that mundane money too just to be able to pay his rent.
"I-ha- I want-ha- compensation for this near murder! And put those doughnuts in a doggy bag, I'm not eating them where I'm vulnerable.
“I knew Fury lied when he said you were house-trained.” Tony snarked back. “Remember who’s making your arm.”
“I- What you don’t?” Tony shook his head and pulled to break free again. “You know what, who cares, let me go! I didn’t realize you were a living thing.”
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that you had no emotions.” It was honest at least. He looked expectantly at Tony, probably waiting for an excuse from him too. After all, he hadn't been kind either. Sadly for him, Tony was stubborn and didn’t want to say it back just yet.
“You are here for pleasure I hope! I have some new mead for you to taste, join me !” he loudly declared, making some clients glare at him.
“No, and now that we agreed on the price, yes we did, don’t bother, what day and time do you want me?”
“Yes. We’ve heard about the fake humans They put when they kidnap people. I didn’t have one so when I came back I just… Walk back into my mundane life, or at least tried to.” he cleared his throat, the memory of it coming back to him and making him uneasy. “I don’t know why either They didn’t do it. Fury told me that I’m the first changeling to whom it happened.”
"Well, I do try to keep a happy mood when I'm working. After all, even here, not many of us find the strength to do so. I see it as my duty to stand strong for them.
He plopped Tony down, who had to catch himself on the barstool unless he crashed onto the ground, before patting his shoulder.
He could hear Steve answering but the words jumbled together in his head. A few other voices jumped in, making it even harder for Tony to pick apart the sounds and understand the sentences thrown at him. Geez, it really seemed he exaggerated on the drinks. A soft hand brushed his shoulder and he meet the eyeless face of the Widow. He felt himself flinch away from her but her hand held him tight. Her ruby lips moved once more and he was pulled back inside the pub by the Fairest.
"No. I don't think that's a good idea. Give me that drink." Steve took Thor's special 'mead' and set it further away from Tony who let out a sad noise at the action. "I think it's enough for this evening.
Of course, Goose, not caring about his feelings, just kept purring and rubbing his head against the rough hand. He may be part changeling, he was still a cat. So Tony just sighed and kept petting it, waiting for the others to come back.
Fury didn’t even blink at the comment but the man next to Tony looked horrified by the casual insult. Goose sniffed the hand that was still held out for him and jumped, purring into the man’s arms. The mechanic had to agree with the cat on this one, those arms seemed to be a wonder to be in.
That was the start if the fight. That lingering gold who never left his wedding finger and who seemed to ooze with wyrd. Logic, Imagination and emotions. This thing was filled to the brim with emotions.
“Ugh. More secrets, why am I not surprised. Let me then ask you what’s in it for me? You’re asking me to build something that’ll have to be intertwined with wyrd so that it would go from arm to wolf leg. I’m good, true, don’t think any of your paws could realize such a feat. but this is going to take so much time. I’m going to have to do tests, reruns, crash tests, you can afford me for that.
“I’m going to make you a fulfilling lunch my friend." Thor decided with a nod. "With a good glass of mead for the soul and some meat to put on those bones."
He took a step closer to Steve who also took the bait and took a step forward, his solid body moving with fluidity even when made of marble. Bucky tried to grasp his arm, stop his friend from the confrontation but the blond man shook him off.
garage. He wasn’t going to let normal clients wander inside while he was talking about prosthetics and wyrd in the same sentence. He plans on staying a simple mechanic in his everyday life, ok? There was one thing he was good at, and it was keeping his ‘human’ life separate from his changeling’s one.
“No one wants any remembrance of Arcadia, Carbonnel. But we influence our lairs with our soul no matter how much we hate it. Many changelings came here, slept, and live a full life within these walls. This isn’t just me. Also, you can’t say you haven’t impacted your own home yourself.”
"I offer quality content unlike many thieves in New York so yeah. I have plenty of regulars who trust me and spread my reputation throughout the city. I guess that a little wyrd here and there goes a long way."
It is nothing. It should pale before the face of the big things, the earth-shattering, the miraculous – the
“I have… Arlington.” Steve awkwardly presses himself against the wall of the overfull coffeeshop, paper cup oozing warmth through his palms. Sometimes, if he lets himself forget, the crowds piling through the street and bustling indoors can still stun him. “There’s a memorial there, I mean. But if I could pick, after I eventually… Brooklyn, probably. In the Barnes family plot, if they allow it.”
to access his data framework of the ones who (still) had access. Rhodey’s stony silences made his disapproval of the BARF tech all too apparent (he said he disapproved of Tony’s
That memory kept him cheered for the next few hours, as he yawned through breakfast and poured three cups of coffee into his gullet; went down to R&D for a surprise visit, multitasked through a couple conference calls. The sky was absolutely clear outside, not a puffy cloud to be seen – even Tony who wasn’t that big of an outdoors guy found himself drifting off once or twice, daydreaming about popsicles and walks in the park. Morning ticked over into afternoon and as the day continued to be almost insolently sunny, Tony found himself at the employee lounge on level thirty three, debating if he had the time to venture out for a walk and coffee number four before his two-thirty-lets-be-realistic-three o’clock.
There were lines of brown-green pots: Chinese cooking vessels, the placard said, from the tenth century. Round bellied with short, engraved legs, bronze polish turned sage green by the corrosion of the centuries. He moved towards the closest one. The roughened, imperfect surface had small ridges-rectangular lines spiralling inwards and simultaneously spanning the girth of the vessel, like a maze.
“You’re welcome, Sir.” JARVIS prompts him primly, and Tony bites back a laugh. He’ll deal with (express his unending gratitude to) his AI later.
Natasha stilled. Behind the shield of banter, the fond, biting grin – Steve could see now that her eyes were too bright. Gleaming with a layer of something liquid and unspilled, eyes reddening – streaks crawling in from the corners, overwhelming the whites. “Yeah?”
believed Clint was going to hit him. It could be a joke. It started as a joke. But Clint was one of those perennial jokesters that could flip to deadly serious in the blink of an eye- smiling and unamused.
“The records I’ve been able to retrieve indicate Christmas morning, when you were eleven.” FRIDAY responded, even more quietly.
Air rushed into his lungs in a desperate surge, of a sudden, and barely a second passed before Steve was flinging the device to the side and scrambling off the bed, stomach twisting uncontrollably. Not five minutes later, his forehead was propped against the smooth porcelain of the toilet seat while his mouth retched; throat pulling out every remnant of food he’d swallowed in the last six hours and more besides. Disgorging every substance in his innards, it felt, till his body was hollow and flopped over the bathroom tiles, breathing harsh and vengeful.
It was a curse sometimes, the eyes of an artist, catching on these little details that so often went missed. He’d have moved on to the teenage couple at the back, hobbling through their steps; except there was a flurry at the corner again, and Steve’s eyes went careering back to the goateed man and his companion. She was apparently on a tirade, lips moving rapidly-ceasing when they pulled back, held hands and kicked outwards-and there they were back again, and she was continuing, brows scrunched and exasperated moue. And he was…he was actually nodding his head along, apparently according to the beat of the song, mouth curled cheekily. And there she was again, reaching up to thwack him for the third time upside the head.
tell me you couldn’t come up with someone better for the job. More experience, more up to the-hell, someone who actually
Even if he could see value in Queens now past all the snobbery….sometimes he wasn’t quite sure if the snobbery was real, even back then. As a kid, he’d zoom past the smaller boroughs of New York, nose flattened against a limousine window- and watch the kids playing on the streets. He’d imagine being poor (and what a fucking joke was that, how condescending, a rich kid growing in the silky embrace of luxury wishing to live a little closer to the ground), imagine growing up like his father did, maybe; son to a fruit seller on the Lower East Side. Maybe then his genius would feel a bit more real to the people around him. A bit better deserved. Money
Repulsors cutting out, he hit the fake grass with a particularly defeated thump. Steve Rogers turned his head at the sound.
“I think,” and Tony stretched his hand out, watching it shake almost imperceptibly. Watched Steve catch it in his own trembling palm, fingers snaking through the gaps and pressing the tremors into their knuckles. Hands clenched tight, heartlines aligned. “this isn’t how it happens.”
Steve parsed out a sigh of his own, somehow eloquent for a glorified, unsyllabic burst of air. “Why do you always have to–”
you only live once. Don’t wait, or you might be too late. That kinda thing.” Tony released the skin, watched as the crease remained before he smoothened it out with a thumb.
Wait, she’s spitting sarcasm. What? Oh, right. The manila on the counter. She’d handed it over to him a week ago, chock full of photos and intel gleaned from their last attack on an AIM base. He’d apparently dumped it out into the public space, untouched.
Fifteen minutes later- Steve was sitting up on the bed, spine pressed against the headboard, laptop propped on his thighs booting up. His heart was a constant drum in his ears, unending deep thumps like he might be underwater. His fingers were tapping out a restless pattern against the cool grey plastic- he stilled them with conscious effort, and immediately felt like he might scrabble out of his skin. This was…this…damn, he didn’t know. He didn’t know what to expect. He didn’t know if he should expect anything at all.
“No.” Tony said, fingers drifting to his throat – knuckles brushing against the silk of his tie, before he curled them in. “I mean, yeah. Yeah, of course.”
(For all his resentment against the world he’d ended up in, Steve was fairly convinced that the ‘modern masterpiece’ that he’d received a link to very early on in his university days, was anything but a masterpiece. He still felt vaguely bad about the reams and reams of mockery that the work had apparently inspired-but considering the role it had just played in his own sarcastic commentary, he was probably a hypocrite.)
