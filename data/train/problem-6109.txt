Tony blinked a few times, then just gave a slightly stunned, “Wow.”
"Well I guess it'll just take some time for you to get used to. ." he muttered letting out a nervous chuckle. Lately he had been on edge, feeling anxious and skittish. He knew they were worried about him and others were disappointed in him. "Well I have to prepare for the press conference so I'll get going."
“Steve you know better than I do that if Tony wanted to he could recreate any of the sujits he already had. Or even make a new one from scratch better than the last.” She was right and Steved knew that. But at the same time he was unsure. Lately Tony had been pulling stunts Steve didn’t know he was capable ol.
Back at the tower it all felt off. Steve was back but all he did was pace his room. Some were lounging around the living room meanwhile Tony had left his lab in the hands of Scott, Sam, and Peter. Natasha and Clint were in the training room. They were all going about their usual daily tasks and routines but it all felt out of place without Tony.
Clint walked into the living room with a look of confusion on his face. "Tony who was that? That wasn't  JARVIS." Everyone seemed a little confused and concerned. Tony simply smiled.
"Sam? What is it?" Steve asked calmly. Sam was standing in the living room eyes glued to the tv. Confused as to why the boy hadn't answered Steve slowly followed his gaze to the tv. Steve's brows furrowed as he saw the local news station. He squinted his eyes as he read the headline. 'Stark Industries In New York Catches Fire After Chemical Spill."
"I think it's beset we just leave Tony alone." Natasha started. Clint scoffed and stood up walking over to Natasha. She glared at the man. "What is it Hawkeye? Got something to say? Speak up." She confronted.
team which means it's
So I was going to wait a bit to post the second chapter but I wrote a lot of the first chapter while I had free time in class and I'm a little too excited not to post it. I won't really have like update days but now that I have uploaded chapters one and two I'll try and post new chapters Sunday and Monday. Uh I hope this isn't too bad and again I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes in advance.
Steve stared at tony with an expression that Tony was unable to read. But either way Tony still smiled back. "I don't believe anyone will have a problem with this correct?" Tony asked and Steve stood up again.
benefit and it put the whole planet in danger." Tony knew he was in the wrong. What he had done was selfish and a stupid choice for a supposed genius. The guilt had begun to was over him and he couldn't find it in him to meet the soldier's eyes. "Tony! Are you even listening to me?" Steve stopped placing his hands at the edge of Tony's desk.
"I haven't been able to sleep well." he paused. "The other day I made a couple bad calls in field during a fight." He stared at the ground not wanting to meet Steve's eyes. "I mean you saw Clint. He ended up with a broken arm and Sam had a concussion because of my mistakes."
Tony understood why though. They weren't on good terms right now and he was the one to blame for it. Tony had
He switched out his uniform for a pair of jeans and a crewneck tee. He threw on his boots and reached for his jacket and keys. Ignoring his team members he headed down to the garage to get his motorcycle. Just what was it that Pepper wanted him to see.
Steve didn’t understand what Nat could be suggesting. That fire? That explosion there’s no way that Tony could’ve survived that. At least not without the suit. But as far as he knew the iron man suits were all still here locked up in the tower. But of course knowing Tony he would always be able to rebuild the suits better than the previous.
yeah he would definitely miss this place. He'd miss the people. He'd miss the place he'd started calling home. But this was what he had to do. "He walked down into his lab. "Alright JARVIS this is it buddy. Dumb E, Butterfingers, you two ready?" He smiled sadly.
Tony jumped as he heard a knock at the door. He hadn't even realized that the tears had began to fall the alcohol having more of an influence on his emotions than he thought. He quickly wiped his face before turning to walk to the door. When the door opened he was met with Peter Parker in the hallway playing with the sleeves of his jacket. "Peter, come in. What can I do for you kid?"
"Ah that's right." Fury started. "I hadn't the chance to inform you as you were on a mission. I didn't need this information distracting you." Steve scoffed in annoyance but let Fury continue anyways.
Stark leaned back in his chair as he tried to shake the thoughts from his head, he hadn't taken his meds and he knew this would end poorly. But it was too late he could feel the anxiety and panic begin to build. Suddenly he found himself gripping the arms of his chair fighting to calm himself down before it worsened. But the thoughts continued to flood his head.
"Hey Steve you alright . .? You kinda just walked off and everyone wanted me to come an check on you." Steve felt a dip in the mattress as Nat had found a seat next to him. She placed a hand on his shoulder. "Steve, you know I think he's still out there. Stark may be reckless but this? This just doesn't feel right and what Fury said?" She paused. 'You and I both know that was a load of crap."
problems Tony." She started. "You don't get to abandon
"Tony what's going on?" Steve finally asked. Tony didn't know what exactly he was asking about so he didn't know how to answer. "I mean why the sudden retirement? Why pick me? Are you al-" Steve cut himself off.
wanted again. For
With that Nat was dismissed and found her way back to the others who were mourning the loss of their friend. Steve took a deep breath not sure he was prepared for the call that was ahead of him. “Alright uh FRIDAY call Pepper Potts.”
Hey sorry this is late I know I said that I would try and update Sunday and Monday but some things came up. I spent Sunday hanging out with a friend and Monday and Tuesday I stayed home from school talking a mental health day. So here it is. I'll try and update more frequently but I can't really say I'll have a for sure date for when I update. Also apologies in advance for any typos and grammar mistakes.
Eventually the tears had stopped and Tony laid in his bed drifting to sleep as exhaustion took over. This was it. Tony had moved out. The avengers had their new leader. All that was left was the press conference and it was officially over. But Tony honestly wasn't sure if he was ready to let it all go.
"Everyone I'd like you to say hello to FRIDAY. She's your new tower security system. She'll also be able to answer and assist you with anything you need in the field through coms." Everyone starred at him as he began to explain. "FRIDAY here is programed to work the same way as JARVIS just a little easier since I won't be around if something happens. Her program is uh better protected than JARVIS to say the least."
Once inside Steve walked pass everyone else straight for his room ignoring their expectant stares. He felt exhausted though he hadn't done anything, his whole body feeling heavy.  He wasn't in the place to be answering everyone's questions right now. None of them were. They had all just lost a friend and they needed time to process and grieve. :Less than twenty four hours ago they knew their friend was alive. Within less he was gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony sat in his lab, a soft glow from his screen illuminating his room. An hour had passed since his accidental reveal of his plans of retirement and more than half the shot glasses were empty. Tony felt tired as he rested his head against his desk. He was going to miss this place thought surely he'd build himself a nice lab in his future home.
Tony and the gang finally meets up and finds out who will be taking over the leadership for the avengers. Steve is confused and Tony confesses why he's retiring. Steve is worried for Tony. The press conference takes place and Tony announces his retirement. Exhausted and overwhelmed Tony makes his way back to his dark and lonely penthouse.
The team had gotten back from another mission. Tony hadn't slept well in weeks since Cap left. Often he found himself working day and night in the lab trying to keep his mind occupied. When he wasn't working or in he field he found himself drinking until he blacked out to avoid thinking. This all began to take a toll on his abilities to think and work in the field and it was starting to show.
"Tony we need to talk." Nat started, Tony giving a small hum of acknowledgement. "You need to get your shit together Stark. You can't keep leading us in this state." She sighed keeping her tone steady like usual. "Your reckless choices are putting us at risk Tony. Today it was only a broken arm and a concussion but one day what if that's not all." There was a pause. "What if one day you lead us to our deaths."
Tony gave a small smile. That's what the kid was so worried about asking him? He always liked Peter, he was a good kid. Both smart and brave. He had a bright future ahead of him and with his replacement leading he'd have the best chance of living through that future.
“Contacting Miss Potts.” FRIDAY announced. Steve didn’t know how the two would handle this news. It was a few moments before Pepper had answered the phone. To his surprise she sounded fairly calm. He was suddenly scared that he would have to be the one to break the knews to Pepper.
Well uh there it is chapter three. I wrote it in the middle of class so I hope it isn't too bad. Uh yeah angsty.
Within minutes of stepping into the tower Tony had been fixing himself yet another drink with some kind of hard liquor. He began to pour the drink before he faltered hearing footsteps come to a halt behind him.
Tony leaned back against in the chair sighing. He felt exhausted. "Jarvis we have some planning to do in the morning. For now turn off the lights and play some nice jazz." Jarvis did as he was told. Tony stood up looking over the city once more before he turned making his way to the sofa in the corner of the room to sleep and let his frantic mind rest.
They all nodded before making their way over to the avenjet. "Captain, can I come with you?" Steve turned to see Peter in the new suit Tony had left him. He knew how much the kid looked up to Tony and he couldn't say no. The could could hand himself well and Steve knew this. He nodded his and allowed the kid to follow them.
"So what's the game plan?" Clint asked, already completely suited up along side Falcon. " Steve shook his head causing Clitnt to frown. " Did Fury tell us we couldn't go? When have the avengers ever listened to that bastard."
He was left alone in his office with his thoughts. He let out a shaky breath he turned to face the window overlooking the city.
Steve was beyond irritated at this point. Maybe even enraged. Tony did his best to ignore Steve not daring to face the angry and disappointed expression written across the man's face. "You know what Tony you are absolutely fucking ridiculous do you know that? When will you get it through your thick skull that the whole world doesn't revolve around
The next morning as the sun came through the windows of Tony’s penthouse and Steve lay with the man in his arms, he found himself wondering how he’d gotten so lucky. Maybe there were some perks to looking after Tony.
Steve had woken up at two in the morning thanks to a jumbled mess of memories that formed into one incoherent but disturbing nightmare. Normally his initial reaction was to go to the Avenger’s gym downstairs, but that night he decided that he’d rather not be alone. So he’d slipped on a pair of shoes and headed down to the workshop in a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt.
Steve was used to Tony’s flirting.
“No, you do. Always. Dunno how, but you do. Have a shirt I took outta the wash one time and it was yours and ‘stead of giving it back I just sleep in it.”
“You need higher standards.”
How about I just come up to your floor and we can talk? Have you eaten yet today? -SR
Steve frowned, looking down at Tony. “What do you mean ‘probably’?”
“He did most of the flirting.”
The date went well. Surprisingly well. Tony took him to a place that was nice, but not so nice that he had to wear a suit and tie. And thankfully it wasn’t nearly as awkward as their lunch in Tony’s kitchen ended up being. Apparently having two people who struggled to process emotions alone in a room together after making big emotional statements didn’t exactly lead to a fun half hour.
“Well when you’re drunk you never remember what we talk about. I could tell you anything and it wouldn’t matter the next day. Not exactly perfect circumstances for a conversation.”
“I don’t know. He’s really only sweet and genuine like that when he’s drunk. A part of me thinks he’s not ready to do that sober.”
Maybe ‘flirting’ wasn’t the right word. ‘Hitting on’ might be more appropriate. He wasn’t sure a soft, bubbly word like ‘flirting’ was the right term to apply to the constant jokes about how good his ass looked in the suit, or that he looked like he could rip his shirt by flexing. Sometimes it would be gentler, although it was usually combined with insults, like saying how it was a shame such a pretty face ended up with such a grumpy old man.
“No, I- I definitely meant it. I just… Are you sure?” He sounded slightly incredulous.
Steve took the water bottle, screwing back on the cap before tucking it into his sweatpants’ pocket. “Alright, let’s get you to bed.”
It made him think, and think hard. What if Tony meant it? What if he really
“I was just going to say I was worried about him getting hurt! Which is stupid, because of course he wouldn’t, we had everything under control.”
After a minute Tony wandered into the kitchen, looking a little worse for wear. He’d at least made the effort to get dressed, but his clothes were slightly askew and his hair was a mess. A real mess, not the carefully styled mess that he usually sported.
“What is it now?”
“Making sure you’re okay is the bare minimum for human decency, Tones.”
So he didn’t remember anything. Which meant he probably didn’t remember fawning over how nice he was and then telling him that he was falling in love with him.
She took another sip of her latte, studying Steve over the lid. When she put it down, she took another moment to absorb what he said before speaking. “So. What you’re saying is you think you have a crush on Tony, but you’re so bad at reading your own emotions that you can’t actually tell.”
“I guess you can thank Fury for that. Or Loki for invading. One of the two,” Steve teased with a little smile.
When he walked into the lab, Tony was sitting at his workbench with his head buried in his arms, an empty glass and nearly empty bottle of scotch next to him. Steve just sighed, making his way through the workshop to place a hand on Tony’s shoulder. He was expecting to just pick him up and carry him upstairs as usual. He wasn’t expecting him to be awake.
“Well what did you do with Bucky?”
“Course. You’re pretty and nice. And you take care of me. Kinda ticks all the boxes.”
“What is it? Sex? Money?”
Steve frowned. “Are you… okay?”
“Dunno. Was asleep. ‘Sides, you don’t
“You do a thing when you’re thinking where you furrow your eyebrows. It’s cute, but it’s a dead giveaway. Face it, Rogers, you’re easy to read.”
Another month and a half passed before Steve found Tony drunk again. He went through the same motions as before, getting him water and coaxing him into drinking it. This time he didn’t bother trying to get him to walk, he just scooped him up. Tony happily snuggled down into his arms and buried his face in his shoulder.
Steve blinked at the sudden turn in conversation. “Thanks.”
“I had two decades with Bucky. I’ve only known Tony for a year.”
“You’re being too nice.”
“No! No. It’s just unexpected. And I don’t exactly know how to react.”
“Okay.” His voice was small, and he really did sound hurt. But Steve had no idea how to fix it. So he just carried him into the elevator and took him up to his room, laying him down in bed. He carefully removed his shoes and put them by the door, then put the water bottle on the nightstand.
The coffee stirrer stilled as Steve frowned. He wasn’t exactly sure
“Well have you ever had a crush before that you can compare it to?”
Tony considered it, then nodded. “I guess I should probably say outright: I love you. That wasn’t just some drunken thing I said just for the hell of it. I really do love you.”
I did, and I think I owe you an apology. -TS
Steve paused. “And Tony?”
“And so are you. Which is why we’re friends.” Natasha took another sip of her coffee. “So, what are you going to do about it? Ask him out?”
Steve nodded, the coffee stirrer back in motion as he tried to think of various ways he could beat Tony at his own game.
“You’re close enough.”
“Still don’t hafta do it.”
The rest of his day was dominated by the memories of Tony’s words.
Steve stepped into the elevator, pressing the button for Tony’s floor. “But I want to. I want to make sure you’re safe and healthy and happy.”
do anything.”
“Tony.”
“Cap! You wanna see what I’m making?” he slurred, then turned back to his workbench and started to explain the mess in front of him. It wasn’t the first time he’d tried to explain an invention to Steve, but it was definitely the most incoherent.
Tony paused. “Okay, you and Rhodey. But you’re always here.”
“You’re thinking about this too hard,” Natasha chided, bringing him back to reality.
Steve nodded, twirling the coffee stirrer between his finger and his thumb as he thought. “…I really like Tony. But I don’t want to push him too far.”
“You say a lot of things when you get like this.”
At first, he thought he was doing it to get under his skin. Even after the Battle of New York, their relationship hadn’t exactly been perfect. Fighting together and learning to work together had meant that they went from despising each other to forming a somewhat workable relationship, but it didn’t stop the constant bickering. For those first few months, he fact that the team treated the Tower as a sort of home base was the only thing that kept him living there.
Nope. Nothing. How’s your hangover? -SR
“Well maybe start small. Start flirting back when he’s sober.”
“-Said absolutely nothing. You’re the one who dug that hole yourself.”
Days went by, and his relationship with Tony didn’t change, despite the fact that he was thinking a lot about. It left him wondering if the warm feeling he felt in his chest when Tony directed a smile at him was purely platonic, or if the way his heart beat a little faster and face flushed when he flirted with him was just embarrassment. He was never very good with his own emotions. So what if everything he was feeling actually was romantic? But what if it wasn’t and he was just fooling himself into thinking platonic attraction was romantic, and then he did something he shouldn’t based on that?
Two days later, he was out with Natasha again, for coffee this time. Caffeine did nothing to him anymore, but he liked the warmth of the drink.
“You don’t do this with Tasha,” Tony pointed out.
Steve laughed softly. “Really though, I’m pretty damn far from perfect.”
“With Bucky it was easy. I was his friend, and I felt happiest when I was around him. When he smiled at me I got weirdly excited about it, even though he did it all the time. And… now that I’m saying it aloud I’m realizing exactly how similar that was to this.”
The beginning of the dinner was slightly awkward, but it wasn’t long before Tony made a comment that made Steve laugh, then from there things relaxed into a more comfortable back and forth. By the time they were back at Tony’s penthouse, things felt almost normal.
“Of course.”
“Why? ‘M fine,” he protested, looking back up at Steve. They stared at each other for a moment, locked in a moment of pure stubbornness on both ends. It took a minute, but eventually Tony cracked first, his face falling. “Fine.”
“You-” Tony jabbed his chest unsteadily, “-Are nice. ‘M a fucking mess!” He laughed. “’M a mess, and you’re always so damn nice. You take care of me all the time. Make sure I’m eating and sleeping and shit like that.”
“Night, Cap.”
Steve exhaled through his nose at the text before putting his phone back in his pocket.
“Finally got that sorted out in your head, huh?”
Tony nodded, accepting that. “JARVIS, lights to… whatever.”
A look of surprise crossed Steve’s face. He’d never actually told Natasha-or anyone-about his relationship with Bucky.
“I just don’t know how to flirt.”
Tony looked up at Steve, studying him for a moment before speaking again. “You have really pretty eyes.”
Tony looked up at him, and the second he got a good look at him his face lit up like a kid on Christmas. It was strangely adorable.
“You’re a menace.”
Sure. -TS
“I mean it. How many times have I found you passed out in the workshop and had to take you upstairs?”
“How’s the hangover?” Steve asked, keeping his voice low.
Well, he supposed that answered the question of where his blue shirt went. He stepped into the elevator, pressing the button for Tony’s floor.
“I mean, I do love you. So I dunno when I said it, but I probably meant it.”
“Shit, thanks.” Tony looked at the food on the counter, regarding it for a moment before turning back to Steve. “So I should probably apolo-”
“Well what was the difference?”
Hey. Just wanted to say thanks for taking care of me last night. JARVIS said you took me upstairs. I don’t actually remember anything, so I hope I didn’t do anything /too/ embarrassing. -TS
When he flirted with him next, he ended up returning the compliment. Tony had made a comment about how good Steve’s ass looked in the Cap uniform, and Steve had replied with an offhanded compliment about how the flight suit looked pretty good on Tony too. Tony had stood there for a moment, looking at him as he went about his task, his back to him so he couldn’t see him blush.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony waved his hand again, but this time Steve managed to dodge. “Sober Tony likes you too. He’s just a coward.”
As their relationship grew and evolved over that next year, he’d thought the flirting would stop. Instead, it just morphed into a sort of inside joke. Tony would make a comment about his body, and it would just be a normal part of their conversation. Nothing out of the ordinary. And over time, Steve just learned to accept it. For Tony, it seemed like dropping pick-up lines into conversations came as naturally as breathing between sentences.
“Well tell me about them.”
So, we should probably talk. -TS
A few sentences in, Steve squeezed Tony’s shoulder. “Tones, I think we should get you to bed.”
The next dinner he brought to Tony was homemade, not just takeout or something from the team’s dinner. He actually made dinner specifically with the intention of bringing it down to Tony. It took some coaxing to get him away from his work long enough to actually sit down and eat, but he managed it, and he enjoyed it.
The next time he heard from Tony it was a text.
“Can just have JARVIS fill me in.”
A month passed, then near the end of the next he found himself in a familiar situation. He’d gone down to talk Tony into going to bed only to find him drunk out of his mind, except this time he was focused intently on something that even Steve could see wouldn’t work.
“Tell me that again when you’re sober and maybe I’ll believe you.”
“Well maybe you just need a little more time. I wouldn’t do anything just yet. Maybe wait and see how it goes.”
“Well, yeah.”
Tony went silent, and Steve had a strange thought. Had he… hurt Tony by telling him that?
Steve considered it for a minute. “Alright. JARVIS, tell him what he said today when he wakes up."
He pulled the shoes off and dropped them over the side of the bed, then crawled under the covers and curled up there. He looked up at Steve, giving him that pleading look again. “Stay with me?”
He was about to leave when Tony caught his arm, pulling him back to him. Steve went easily, allowing Tony to pull him against him. Then his hand was sliding up to his bicep and he was leaning up to kiss him.
“A couple.”
“Well I’m not.”
The flirting has started in those few months. So Steve logically assumed that it was just meant to irritate him. And it did. He absolutely hated it. They’d be having a conversation and Tony would drop in with a comment about his body and a little smirk and Steve’s blood would boil.
He couldn’t stop replaying parts of the night in his head. Tony calling him perfect, being so sweet and genuine. Tony telling him that he made him feel safe. Playing with Tony’s hair and feeling that swell of affection and protectiveness over the sleeping man. Tony pleading with him not to leave him, because everyone always did.
Most of this Steve just wrote off. That was Tony. He was a flirt, and Steve knew he was attractive, despite the fact that he still felt slightly disjointed from his appearance even all those years after the serum.
“’Kay.”
He explained all of that over lunch with Natasha a week later, pouring out everything that had been going through his head.
Steve went to the fridge, retrieving another bottle of water before returning to Tony’s side. He stood by him as he took sips, making sure he drank at least half of it before carefully helping Tony to his feet. Then as he tried to lead him to the elevator, Tony stopped dead in his tracks.
“Yeah, yeah. I know,” Tony replied with another flippant hand wave.
“Want you to carry me again.”
“There. Happy?”
He stayed there for a long while after Tony was asleep, just playing with his hair and listening to his snoring. So JARVIS was going to tell him everything. Or, at least, everything that had just happened. Which meant he would know that he told Steve that he loved him, and there was sure to be fallout from that. The question was: was he ready for it?
“Thanks?”
Awful. I’m going back to sleep. -TS
Tony was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke up again, it was much quieter. “…Please don’t leave. Everybody always leaves. I don’t wanna lose you too.”
Steve had heard him say it drunk, but hearing him tell him he loved him sober was something entirely different. It made his chest feel light, a sort of giddy happiness dominating for a moment. God, he really was like a schoolkid with a crush.
“Not gonna thank either of them for shit.”
“So… did you mean it?”
“Natasha doesn’t need my help as much as you do. Drink.”
“I’m your friend, Tony. I’m going to take care of you. That’s what friends do.”
“Well work with that. Try to find things to show him you’re interested. Just start with that.”
“Are you going to be sick?”
“Nothing.” Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He wanted a relationship with Tony. But that came much later.
There were a few nights that Steve would come down to the workshop to check on Tony before bed and find him passed out from either exhaustion, alcohol, or a combination of both. Those night he’d end up carrying him upstairs to bed and making sure he was comfortable before leaving him. Apparently JARVIS had made the executive decision that it was in the best interest of Tony’s health and safety to allow him access to his room to put him to bed.
When he thinks that he almost lost him… He will do anything to prevent it in the future. He never wants to see him like that ever again. Even if he has to tie him up to the bed he will do it. He will show the billionaire how much he loves him, how much he cares for him. He will show him that he is needed, that he is wanted. Because according to what Tony said back in the warehouse, he believes that he doesn’t matter but the truth is the opposite.
And then Tony finally sees who is beside him and he is shocked. It's really Steve. Tony is starting to shake a little in fear of what's coming. Is Steve here to mock him even more? That he is pathetic for trying to end his life? But he doesn't let Steve play with him anymore. He is going to fight back.
“Will you kiss me?” Tony goes YOLO.
“Since you are his Captain then yes. But only you, I’m sorry.” the doctor said. Steve would finally see his beautiful genius. Make sure that he is still alive and that the doctor didn’t lie.
Tiberius lowers himself to the ground before Tony so they can be face to face and continues in talking, his voice is cold and merciless. "Did you tell him anything?" He asks even though Steve was clearly clueless about what is happening down here. He just needs an excuse for beating Tony some more and he always finds it.
When Tony has enough blood to calm down his urge he slowly lightens up his grip on the soldier. He knows he screwed this but he had no other choice. Maybe he should have just killed himself when he was turned at least he wouldn't hurt the man he loved.
"S-save it for y-yourself, you n-need it… N-need it m-more." Tony refuses the bread, he, in fact, doesn't need to eat at all, there's only one thing for his survival and they are not gonna bring him any. Tony knows he is in a horrible situation right now and there is only one outcome. That is actually what they are waiting for. But he is giving all his strength for it to not happen.
Moonlight is coming through the tiny window, illuminating the small room. The brunette retreated back into the corner and now he lets the teardrops flow down freely and his thoughts swallow him. He just lost the man he loves before he even got the chance to man up and do something about his feelings.
Steve thought.
They don’t waste any more time and speed out of the door. No one seems to try to stop them as they are now located in a small windowless hallway with only a few other doors and stairs leading up.
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" Steve yells at Tiberius furiously as he opens the door and runs towards the two of them, Tony has never seen him like this before, so angry, the Captain America always keeps his cool.
Steve is satisfied with the answer and it actually perfectly makes sense. Of course Tony would invent something that would ease his life as a vampire. The genius is probably the only one who has that serum so it's good to know no vampires are lurking in the daylight.
He was getting out of time, the bomb was still ticking. He unplugged the arc reactor and attached it to the core of the bomb. It was doing what it was supposed to. Fine.
Hope settles in the supersoldier's mind and he works on autopilot, that's when he feels a needle in the back of his neck. It stings a little but he can't think about it for too long before his vision starts darkening. The fatigue lowered his guard and he is now unconscious laying on the ground. Whatever they do to him at least they will get him to Tony.
Steve is nervously walking in the waiting room. He is still in his Captain America uniform which is stained with Tony's blood. Nat and Clint are sitting and trying to calm him down. Even Bruce joined them, he is worried about his science bro too. Steve is a mess. They have never seen him like this.
"We are your team and you didn't tell us! We could have worked it out like we always do! You didn’t have to be on your own." Steve spats angrily. He thought that the engineer learned that he is not alone anymore and that he has a team that cares about him and will always have his back no matter what. But he was terribly wrong. He is still the same narcissistic soloist like before the battle of New York. Doesn’t trust anyone and thinks he is better than all the other people around him.
"Do you have some plans for today?" Natasha asks.
"He has a tracker, no?" Steve points out not wanting to rub it into the woman's face that she has forgotten. It's a lot of pressure on her right now. And Steve is well known for staying cool minded in the toughest of situations.
"Tony! Where are you?" Steve said worriedly because now he could hear how Tony's voice was trembling, like he couldn't breathe...
"Okay, 5 minutes max. Then I seriously need to go. We can continue once I come back."
"Oh, okay. Are you hungry? I have prepared a little something for you. Close your eyes." Steve does what he said and then Tony takes his hand and leads him to the roof where the dinner is ready. The ground is full of red rose petals.
"It was nice meeting you, but I have to go. Take care, Captain." Tiberius says and pushes the button for the elevator to arrive on the floor he is on.
"You don't remember? Is this just a game for you? I never thought that the incredible Captain America is so harsh." Tony replies and it breaks Steve's heart a little. What happened? He is confused even more.
"And do you know where he is then?" Steve asks yet another question and even though Pepper is really tired she doesn't let anyone see it and answers. "No, I have no idea where he is." At that, she fixes her perfect high ponytail in frustration.
Steve ran as fast as he could and then he saw the building. When he stepped inside, his heart stopped for a moment.
Then Tony finally picked Clint up and flew with him on the building... The fight could start. Everyone had their spot to shield. Natasha on the west side of the battlefield, Clint was guarding east, Tony was defending from the air and Steve was on the north.
The man opens the door even wider, steps out of the way and just plainly informs them that they are both free to go. Tony and Steve look at each other in shock, they don’t know what to think. It could be another trap or some kind of trick, maybe a test. Nevertheless, the man could also be telling the truth and this is their way home.
“And can you help them somehow?” Asks Steve.
"JARVIS are you there? Where is Tony?" Steve was desperate.
“And I’m sorry Steve... I know you could never feel the same… I thought I was going to die… But it seems I can’t even do that right… You don’t have to feel guilty…” Tony tried to ease the situation a bit. He didn’t want Steve to feel like he owes him something.
The residential genius is a charming, mysterious and sarcastic person but he is also the fearless Iron Man and the supersoldier's teammate who Steve has a crush on. It's not really a crush anymore it's more of a love towards the billionaire who flies in the suit. The blue-eyed man hopes one day they will be together as more than friends, however, he is willing to wait and for now, he is happy as it is. The truth is that he thinks life couldn't be better. But one day changes it all, a day no one expected.
“I love you too. And can I ask you a question?”
"I will be visiting Asgard and I may not return for a few days," Thor replies. He said a few days before that he is planning a trip to Asgard so no one is surprised by the news.
The team is a little bit awkwardly looking at their two teammates, nevertheless, they are all happy for them and they won't interrupt the two lovestruck men. None of them doesn’t know what they went through in their imprisonment but it seems it has just made them stronger.
“Okay, keep doing what you are doing,” Steve mumbled.
He wanted to at least analyze the damage that was done to his body even if it was pointless. 'J, the stats...' said to JARVIS and before that he turned off the comms so the rest of the team couldn’t hear him.
All he knows is that he has to help Tony with whatever was the cause that made him do such a horrible thing. He will do anything to make the genius feel better because he can't live without him, the engineer is the only thing that keeps him sane in this new era of his life.
Tiberius thoughts to himself. The dark-haired man hates the captain for everything he stands for, it's good to know he is not as perfect as everyone says.
"Try talking to him on the comms." Bruce shares his idea. How is that not their first step... It must be from tiredness. So Bucky does as the scientist says and tries to contact Steve via the comms but it's without success.
"You need to go. They are probably waiting." Tony says disappointed that his lover has to already go.
"Alright, team you know the drill let's go! Bruce, you stay here... The four of us can handle it..." Steve stated, and what he says is holy. Nobody ever tries to question his orders except for one resident genius.
"No, he's not. He has to deal with his brother after the battle with Chitauri and has to fix what he did. So he is not coming any time soon." Bruce monotonously answered. Tony was just asking no need to be so annoyed.
Steve sits there for a good half an hour when the elevator clicks indicating that someone is coming. Steve jumps from his seat expecting Tony. Maybe the genius changed his mind and after all is coming for the movie night. But when the elevator opens it's Tiberius who steps out. Good, at least Steve can ask him about Tony.
"Sir, I detected your stats are higher than it's usual. Should I call for help?" JARVIS asks like the good A.I. he is, but not even he can help Tony right now. Nothing and nobody can help him right now. The best thing that ever happened to him in his miserable life is gone, but it can’t be gone because apparently it has never been his in the first place.
"S-steve… G-get as f-far… F-far away from m-me as p-possible... I c-can't take it m-much l-longer." Tony pleads with a trembling voice, he is wrapped in a ball, knees to kiss chest. It's a horrible view but Steve just wants to help him. That's all he ever wants to do.
At this moment Thor would come to handy, the god would just fly around and everything would be a lot faster but he is in Asgard fulfilling his duties in the palace. This time they will just have to manage without the god of thunder.
'Sir, since the stab wasn’t straight, you have punctured lung, internal bleeding and few minor injuries on the upper hip, larger wound on your head and cuts and bruises all over the chest. After you took out the arc reactor the shards started nearing to your heart. I advise calling for medical support.'
On that, the team returns to the tower from the failed mission. The worst part is that someone will have to tell Pepper the bad news. The woman will be devastated, they have been friends with Tony for a long time and the redhead cares about him even though he is such an idiot sometimes. Someone could say they are even platonic soulmates.
“It was in Afghanistan, more details later…” Tony answers with a low voice as he is looking down on his feet. He is still processing Steve’s words and he is also aware that he didn’t reply. What must Steve think right now… Maybe that he made a fool of himself in front of the whole team by revealing his feelings to the man he loves and also being rejected by silence from the side of the said man. Tony is cursing himself right now, his low self-confidence in this kind of thing is showing. Nevertheless, he can’t let Steve this way, he needs to say something. He knows what he wants to say but he doesn’t know how.
"Hey, Bruce what do we have here?" Steve asked with a troubled expression.
Steve should probably say something, but he is wordless, his brain stopped working. His dream just came true, but he never imagined this scenario. That it will be the last words the genius says. He just stares at his precious sweet Tony and doesn't say a word.
Everyone from the team is at their maximum and another battle is ahead.
"That's just amazing!" Clint yells out of frustration from his spot on the stone, his bow resting beside him.
Tony just lays there and lets the man do whatever he pleases. This is it, the end. He can't defend himself anymore, he never could. He is nothing without the suit just like Steve said when they met for the first time, he is just a fragile weak old human. Nobody is going to find him in time and he will die here in his workshop by the hand of his abusive boyfriend.
"The bomb is defused..." It sounded as good as it could due to his condition.
Steve hurriedly walks to Tony's room and he sees the genius from the window. The sight of him feels wrong. Tony is pale and so small in the white huge hospital bed.
After a few minutes, the team sees the two heroes below them and tries to land somewhere near with the plane. Steve and Tony run to the landing-place and reunite with their friends. The reunion is full of hugs and cries of happiness. They are all glad they are together once again.
“I would like to do nothing more rather than this.”
"Steve, the love of my life, the air in my lungs, the sun on my sky, I can't imagine the rest of my life without you by my side. I can't imagine a single day waking up without you, so will you do me the honour and will you be my husband? Will you marry me?" Tony says confidentiality. He is excited about the answer but nervous at the same time. Two years is a long time. If Steve didn't want to be with him he wouldn't stay so long, right?
"They just revealed the truth. I can't trust you anymore. It's not really a problem that you are a vampire. We could have worked with that but you didn't tell us. You didn't tell me! You lied for years!" The blond tries to explain his point of view on this situation. Because it seems Tony thinks that the blue-eyed man hates him due to the abnormal creature he is, however, that's not the truth. He is not that cruel-hearted, he is not blaming the genius for what he is because Steve is sure that Tony didn’t want it, that he had no say in the process that turned him into a vampire.
He knows he is selfish for not fighting more, he knows they would need him to make them a new gear, but they would find someone better it was just a matter of time and as a teammate? He was to use just in the armour exactly as Steve said. He was nothing without his suit. He was billionaire, genius, playboy - not anymore - philanthropist, but that was useless in a real battle.
"Because we need someone on the line that's why..." Steve answered irritated by everlasting Tony’s ignorance.
The world was slowing down, Tony’s vision was blurry, he wasn't able to speak anymore, but he had a lot more things to say... There was just no time for that, giving up. He had to get it out of his chest, he had to tell Steve about his feelings even if it’s selfish of him and it will make Steve only guilty that he doesn’t feel the same.
"Yes, you are on the right coordinates... according to what I see in front of me," said Bruce in the comms.
"It was fine, but it could be even better if we stay like this for the whole day." Tony grins at the blond.
"I love you too," Tony replies truthfully, but he doesn't meet the blond's eyes. He is too scared of what he will see in them if he looks above.
"I don't really know yet… What would you say to work on that project for S.I., Bruce?" Tony yells at the said scientist.
"We heard about what happened. Is everything alright?" One of the team members asks.
"N-n-no." Tony pants through the sobs painfully. Tiberius now can see and hear that the engineer is crying and that makes an evil smirk appear on his face. Tony knows what's coming.
Steve slowly walks through the halls to the elevator and then to their shared penthouse. But it's also quiet there. The lights are off. Weird, Steve thought to himself.
"But he could be helpful..." Tony teases again.
"Tony what can I do?" Steve was lost. He didn’t know what to do, how to help Tony to get better. He is willing to give his life if it helps.
He is waiting in the hospital for Tony to come out of the surgery. They had to pump out his stomach since he has eaten so many of the sleeping pills. They said that if he came a few minutes later it would be much worse. That he might have died. Steve doesn't, no he can't think about that outcome.
“Can I see him?” asked Steve, trying to be brave but he looked terrible.
Steve turns back looking at Tony who is still trembling in the corner of the room but now it looks like whatever is happening to the genius is getting worse. The supersoldier takes the bread and tries to hand it over to the philanthropist but on that, the engineer flinches away like the touch is poisonous.
Since they started dating Tony is not drinking alcohol anymore, he is sleeping like a normal human being and eating regularly. Steve has changed him for better, he is the best thing that ever happened to the genius and he doesn't want to lose him. He doesn't know what he would do if Steve would leave him. His life would be probably over because he can't live without the super-soldier.
“And it seems that everything lays on our shoulders again, Capsicle…” Tony pointed out.
Steve is stepping inside a building and looking around himself if his tired blue eyes can spot something. It's been really exhausting, they have been searching almost the whole day and it's putting its toll on them. However, as the blue-eyed soldier walks farther into the building he sees something and immediately runs towards it.
Now all is left is to find a way back to the city but as the supersoldier is looking around, scanning their surroundings, it seems they are still at the place Steve and the rest of the team were searching for Tony so the blond has an idea as to where they are supposed to go.
"I can't promise you that. If you leave me I can't guarantee that I will go on with my life without." Tony replies sadly.
The medics are taking care of Tony and even when Steve wants to be at Tony's side, he doesn't want to interfere. So he steps aside, every second counts…
"Why can't Bruce go with us, enjoy the show Capsicle?" Tony had to interrupt just to annoy Steve. Nat and Clint just stood there a bit impatient and not amused by Stark's annoyance.
"Get away from me!" Steve hisses at the genius, holding his bleeding neck that is marked with two holes left from the fangs. He doesn't mean to be so harsh but he is angry at this moment. Tony should have said something.
"Mr Stark is in an abandoned warehouse to your left side Captain, you better hurry."
"Then it's good that I will never leave you. You are never going to get rid of me. I love you." Steve takes Tony's hand in his and kissed the top gently.
"I love you Steve and sorry for all the troubles I caused you but I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?"
“Let’s forget everything that happened. This new information doesn’t change anything about you. You are still you and that’s all that matters. I’m never gonna stop loving you.” Steve says gently and starts closing the distance between him and Tony. As he finally approaches the brunette he plants a gentle and loving kiss on the man's lips and the genius returns the action by pressing into it. It’s a hungry kiss full of frustration and love. Both men were waiting for this moment for so long that neither one of them wants to pull away. It’s like the whole world stopped around them.
He saw Tony, hardly breathing, blood pouring from the gash in his suit. And what was the worse; his arc reactor, the beautiful glowy blue thing that was keeping this beautiful precious man alive was out of his chest. Destroyed.
Then he looked at the core with the reactor. The ticking stopped, the bomb was defused, but the reactor was broken so there was no way for him to put it back into his chest.
"Stop it Stark, I'm the one in charge, so you are going to listen to me!" Steve yelled sharply.
"Good morning." Tony greets his boyfriend who lays next to him in their king-sized bed. The billionaire is wrapped around Steve's body like his life depends on it.
"But we still don't know what causes the change." Bruce points out. That's true, they don't know what is happening that Tony changed so much and the team feels useless. How can they protect the world when they can't even help their own friend? Their family?
"And you didn't tell anyone about this?" At that the blond points at Tony's whole body. Waving his hands around in the air. The brunette can tell that the other man is angry and he has every right to be.
So Steve asks: “How is it that daylight does nothing to you?” On that, the brunette lifts his head from his knees and looks at the blond with his wet big brown eyes. Steve almost forgets about everything that happened when he sees that the eyes that he fell in love with are sad and teary. He wants to see them shine and glitter with happiness and never see a glimpse of pain in them but then he comes back to reality and patiently waits for his answer.
Natasha and Clint stopped with their intimate chatting and stood up from their seats on a sofa ready for yet another mission.
"Very funny Iron man... instead of joking around, lift Hawkeye on the building over there so he has a better view..." Steve was already tired of this, but he kept answering.
There is still the chance that the genius will get himself out of there by himself but that's a bit of a hazard, they can't rely on that. They need to save him. The kidnappers seem like they know what they are doing, so they also have to know who they abducted and what he is capable of with nothing but a scrap. That's certainly a disadvantage for the brunette, they are prepared. But Steve will stop at nothing until he gets the engineer back safe and sound, preferably into his arms.
"Guys, we have a problem, the bots are coming and it's a lot of them, prepare for a good fight!"
"You have nothing to be sorry about. I don't need a huge romantic proposal all I want is you and you only." Steve replies.
They are searching for hours and it's getting really dark. However, the team is not giving up and continues in looking for their friend.
“I and Tony, we take care of the rest of the bots and you two get the civilians to safety. That’s our priority.” Stated Steve.
Tony followed the sound. It was coming from an old abandoned warehouse. He stepped inside and there it was: a bomb, on the timer, it was 7:12.
“On it Captain.” Replied the archer.
The fight was long and it looked like it isn't ending anytime soon. And when it wasn't enough Tony faintly heard a beeping sound.
He walks to the bathroom, the alcohol is finally taking its toll. He opens the cabinet above the sink, there are a few bottles of pills, he doesn't care what the pills are for. He swallows them all and then returns back for the alcohol so he can drink the pills down.
“I will try.”
But this is too much. The worst thing is that he believes that even though he tells someone about what is going on, they will join Tiberius and laugh at him, beat him together. And he certainly doesn't want Steve looking at him like Tiberius does; with disgust. He doesn't want Steve to laugh at him and beat him. He is sure he doesn't stand a chance with the supersoldier but he is okay with the friendly concern and glances he gets from the blond.
"But Steve…" Tony says trying to find where the misunderstanding occurred, but no words come from his lips. How could Steve change from the loving boyfriend to this? There is no explanation for this outcome. It must be true, the words Steve said.
After that, they go to the med bay to get Tony checked up. The rest of the team took care of Tiberius. Some of his illegal activities showed up and he is now sitting in a jail where he can hurt no one.
Mmm okay now we kinda getting somewhere but sorry for the uh late updates. I have had a bit of a busy week. Uh I've had a lot of club meetings and I have finals this week. I had birthday dinners both weekends and I also had  volunteer work to do yesterday so I just hadn't had anytime to upload a new chapter.
His thoughts were cut short when he thought about Pepper and Rhodey. “Has anyone called Rhodeny or Pepper yet.” Nat shook her head no. Steve sighed and nodded to himself. “I’ll uh handle it then. You go back to the others, I’ll be alright.”
In all honesty he wasn’t sure. With the recent events Steve wanted to believe that their friend was alive. But at the same time he wasn't sure Tony was the same man he once knew. Tony was always this extravagant, crazy, confident, genius.Not to mention stubborn amongst other things. The last few weeks Tony was different, calm, mellow, and sad. It made Steve unsure.
Before anyone could ask anymore questions he walked out the door. he could hear Steve calling after him but he ignored it rushing towards the nearest restroom. He could hear the footsteps follow behind him. But at that point it wasn't important as he ran into the stall hurling up whatever he had for breakfast.
Tony sighed. "I thought you'd be overjoyed." He laughed sadly. "If you wanted to know the truth Cap I've gotten worse." He said bitterly. "At this point I don't even know if the medication is working anymore." Tony let out a sigh.
The ride home was quiet with the exception of Peter's sniffling. Steve himself was trying his damned hardest to hold it together in front of everyone else. He couldn't help the occasional tear that had threatened to escape. You would think after losing everything that he had known, losing everyone he had known would make this a lot easier. But the reality of it was that no matter how many times it happens it still hurts like a bitch.
"seems they've classified it as a class C fire. I still can't tell what the hell-." Sam was cut off by another explosion. It seemed that one of the building's generators had blown. Steve stood their in shock thoughts running at thousands of miles per second. There was no way Tony would of survived that. Not without his suit. Tony didn't make it. Even if he wasn't blown to pieces the smoke would have suffocated the man.
"He made his choice, Hawkeye, if hew as too weak minded to deal with it then that's on him." She spat bitterly not really meaning it. Now it was Bruce's turn to speak up. He understood why Nat would be mad at Tony. Tony had spent all this time questioning both Clint and Natasha's loyalty to the team. Questioning if they were on their side or Fury's. He questioned their loyalty and he was the one who left.
Their conversation was cut short with Friday interrupting them. "Avengers Falcon has requested everyone meet in the living room immediately. They all stopped and looked at each other before turning to walk to the shared living space.
Tony stopped what he was doing for a split second before slamming his hands down on his desk. He inhaled ready to put on the cocky, playboy, genius act all over again like he always does. "Listen we're all alive. The world is still in once piece. If you ask me sounds that like a mission accomplished." he sassed. Steve shot him a glare and he faltered for a moment. "Besides it's
"So as I was saying. Tony is leaving the team." The word leaving made Tony wince. He didn't want to leave them. He wasn't abandoning them. They'd always have his support and the support they needed from Stark Industries. But he'd just help them from afar. This was what needed to be done.
"Tony this isn't what I meant when I said get your shit together. You don't get to run away from
Tony was late. He knew the team was already inside as well as the new team leader. He took a deep breath before he pushed the door open. He made brief eye contact with Steve before he quickly looked away. "I apologize for being late. Had to make a pit stop." He saw them frown as he took a seat next to Fury.
Okay so that is the end of the chapter.  I wonder what miss Potts wants to show our captain.  Also I uh hopefully will have more updates soon I really am sorry for all the late and inconsistent updates.
"It wasn't that he was weak minded. Tony was dealing with a lot more than he lead on or said to anyone else." He started slowly. "He was on anxiety medications, he was seeing a therapist for his nightmares. We all know that Tony is an insomniac. He was dealing with saving the world, helping us with a million other things, while also helping Pepper run the company from time to time. Not to mention he handles most of our legal issues."
team."
Tony hadn't talked to anyone as they all left him alone and watched from a distance per usual. he hadn't even talked to Pepper or Rhodeny to his own surprise. As for Steve? He and Steve hadn't talked since he quit the team. Last he heard from Nat he was now working as an agent for Fury. It seemed as though Tony was the only one the soldier didn't want to talk to.
"It's not that easy Hawkeye. He's a busy man." Steve said making an attempt to create an excuse. Honestly he didn't think that he had the right to talk to Tony. To call him and check on him after the mess he made of their friendship. "Besides, he seems to be doing. . fine according to the news."  Hawkeye only rolled his eyes.
"JARVIS are you ready to leave buddy?" he asked aloud knowing that technically the AI had no real choice. "Sir wherever you go I must go." Tony let out a soft chuckle. Jarvis was the only one who would never purposely turn his back on him as sad as it was.
Peter looked up and showed a force smile as he nodded. "I understand. I just wish you didn't have to leave the tower but I understand." Peter stood up thanking Stark for his time before leaving. Tony felt as though he'd just disappointed the kid in choosing to just pack up and leave but he wouldn't be able to work in the tower it wouldn't be right. It wasn't his place anymore.
Tony quickly walked away leaving the team to get to know FRIDAY. He made his way into what was left of his lab and sat on the counter pulling out his meds. In a rush to get the new system set up he had nearly forgotten to take his pills. It was going to be a long day.
Weeks had passed since Tony had moved out of the tour. The avengers had gone back to their regular routines but it all felt off. In the middle of an argument amongst each other news of a fire breaks out.
“Hey Pep it’s Steve. . uh I was wondering if you’d seen the news.” Steve, honest to god, didn't want to be the one to tell Rhodey and Pepper. Sure Pepper and Tony were no longer together but that didn’t mean they didn’t matter to each other as friends. I mean she was and still is Tony’s right hand woman at the company.
He made his way back up into the living room. "Alright FRIDAY. I have your first task. Call the avengers to meet me in the living room." Tony knew it would work. Why wouldn't it work? He created it after all.
"Shit" Steve cursed under his breath. He turned away from the group fishing his cell from his pocket. "Cmon' Fury pick up the damn phone." He waited a moment listening the the dial tone. "Fury, have you seen the news. Stark's facility is on fire."
“Oh um okay. I’ll head over to Stark Industries.” he was already standing up again to collect his things. “I’ll see you in a few Peps.” He didn’t wait for a response before he hung up. He was curious as to what it was that Ms. Potts wanted to show him that had been so calm about the recent events.
He sighed and glanced over to the shot glasses before downing another glass. But growing up with his parents always too busy for him he practically never had family. But over time he began to consider the avengers his family. But now he was losing everything all over again and he only had himself to blame.
Everything else seemed to drown out and the ringing in his ears intensified. He had failed to rescue his friend. Sure he had lost soldiers before in battle. But this? This was different. This was Tony we're talking about. Tony wasn't just a soldier he was their friend, their teammate, their family. Now he was gone.
"Alright let's get this meeting started shall we?" Fury cleared his throat. "As you all know Tony will be retiring Iron Man. Which means we need to discuss who will be leading the avengers. Steve stood up wide eyes leaving Tony confused.
“Yes. I saw the news. I was going to call you. . Steve, there's something I need you to come see.” To his surprise she sounded fairly calm. Not distressed or sad and it made him confused. He nodded his head not that she could see.
"Alright, I will get you to know when I found him." The ginger woman calms down after what the person on the phone said to her. As she hangs on the phone call she falls to the couch exhausted.
“We believe you, but you have to be strong right now,” Nat answered. The whole team knew how their two teammates were oblivious to each other’s feelings or at least they suspected something like that. It was unbelievable to withstand it, the tension between them. But the team thought the two idiots will confess when they will be ready. They didn’t want to push them. Maybe they should have done it.
“Thanks, doctor, these are amazing news to hear,” said Nat, relieve visible on her face. Everybody relaxed a bit at hearing the good news, except Steve who was still worried.
"This is going to be so much fun..." giggled Tony.
"Open your eyes…" Tony announces, he can't wait for the moment when he proposes, but that will be after they eat the desert.
"Mute." Tony silences JARVIS, that’s something he has never done before. JARVIS has always been there for him. He helped him to get out of every mess Tony got himself into, but not now, Tony is broken, beyond repairable.
The whole team is suiting up. There was an echo about doom-bots attacking nearby town full of civilians. And the Avengers are needed.
JARVIS rewinds the video and shows them when and on which exact place the genius has been seen last and it appears like the billionaire truly was kidnapped. It shows the car the brunette was sitting in as it stops at the side of the road, Tony is already unconscious in the car and another guy steps in. It must have been planned all along, the driver is a traitor working for criminals. If only Happy wasn't sick this wouldn’t happen, however, there is still the possibility that it was planned as well.
"Cut the chatter, this is serious..." remarked Steve with his Captain America voice. Sometimes it feels like he picks on Tony for no valid reason. As if he was biased towards the brunette.
When Tony arrives in the main room the whole team is already there. Natasha and Clint are eating at the table and Thor and Bruce are watching some movie. Tony moves in the kitchen and grabs some waffles and what is remaining of the coffee in the pot. He sits next to Clint.
Maybe this time Tony will accept his offer to spend more time with the team. Spend more time with him. He needs a break from all the work once in a while. Tony is still just a human like all of them except for Thor. Sometimes people forget that fact.
Only 5:21 was now on the timer. There is no time thinking about it and for Tony, it’s an easy decision to make. It’s either him or the Avengers with Steve and the civilians. It’s would be an honour to die like this, save so many people. If his life was meaningless his death won’t be.
"But you guys didn't see him before... it was like from a horror movie... blood everywhere..." He answered, eyes red and puffy from the crying. He wants to cry more, but he has no tears left.
“That’s not what it’s all about…” Steve said sadly. Does Tony really think that he could be ever a burden to me? Steve thought to himself.
And then Steve wakes up from his trance, realizes what is happening, but it's too late because Tony doesn't hear him.
"Ouch that hurt, think whatever you want Capsicle..." Tony sarcastically said, doing as Steve’s words didn’t hurt him, but that was just another one of his masks coming into action. The truth was that Steve was right and the genius knew that.
"Okay okay." Steve quickly retreats, not wanting to go and cause Tony any more discomfort than he already is in and keeps on talking. "What have they done to you? Or what is happening?"
"No, I'm just worried. He is not himself anymore. I thought you might know what is going on." Steve says genuinely, something is off about Tiberius but the supersoldier can't point it out. When Steve asked about Tony, Tiberius tensed and that indicates something.
Tony slowly walks to the cabinet with secret booze under one of his working tables. Tony never thought he will ever use it again, that he will ever drink again. He has been sober the whole time he was with Steve, but now there is no reason for him to try to please the super-soldier.
"Thank you, doctor, for your time." Steve states. He can't wait to see Tony.
"Nobody is hurt so far, but there is still a lot of bots so I can’t evacuate them yet,” Nat announced briefly.
However, now it's not the time to think about it. Tony is lifelessly laying in front of him and the time is running. Steve is trying to stay calm but it's nearly impossible. His mind racing. He has to call the ambulance fast, so he calls 911 and waits in panic for their arrival.
Nobody answered everyone was from head to toe in fighting bots.
"Sounds good, just wait until this ends. It's just a few more minutes." Bruce yells back.
"Alright... Let's eat. I have lasagna and apple pie, your favourites."
Tony doesn't get to crawl far because Tiberius catches his leg and pulls him closer and after that, he kicks the genius into his chest and stomach and Tony doesn't know where anymore, his whole body is on fire. Tony is not able to tell where the pain comes from, that's just how unbearable it is, it's all over his body. He can hear the cracking of his ribs and it's not a good sound, however, Tiberius seems to be enjoying it and continues. That sick bastard.
"So you heard… What about you? What will you be doing?" Tony asks. He doesn't really care what they are going to do, because he probably already knows. They will probably be sparring, that's what they do almost every day, but everyone knows who will win.
