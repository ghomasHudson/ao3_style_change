I raised myself up on my elbows. He lay below me on the hearth-rug, his hair swept back from his face, soft shadows gathering about his lips as the flames bathed his face in their uncertain light.
Christmas is the time of gift-giving. Parcels wrapped in brown paper are everywhere in this episode. If you know the original story–or even if you don’t, and have drawn some inferences based on the title–every time you see one of these parcels, you want to yell out at the screen, “NO! DON’T OPEN IT!” Whereas the Granada “Blue Carbuncle” stands out for its effectiveness in filling our hearts with the spirit of the season as Doyle intended, Bowen’s screenplay relies for its impact on the constant friction between the Christmas setting and the content of the actual case. This friction is at its most burningly painful in the scenes of Sarah Cushing’s Christmas party, during which The Cardboard Box is sitting under the tree amongst all the other presents, while her dog Gladstone sniffs at it–until she opens it in the presence of all her guests.
episode than a typical Granada adaptation. The characters and the main events of the plot are preserved, but integrated into a very different and more modern kind of story. And I have to say that until we get to the graveside drama, I was totally on board with this. It’s a shame to lose the Turkish bath conversation; but although it’s slightly hokey, Holmes’s sinister play with the figurines is compelling in a different way. After the lethargy of HOB, it’s such a relief to see Holmes snapping into action, yelling for Mrs. Hudson, firing off his telegram, and setting the whole beehive a-buzzing. Watson gets genuinely invested in Lady Frances and makes us genuinely care about her. (This also raises the possibility that Holmes goes out there at least partly because he’s worried Watson may be a little TOO into her, but I’m not going to go down that road at this time.) Including the Earl as a character was a fantastic decision; it gives us a chance to see who Frances is and what she’s been fighting all her life, AND it gives us another chance to watch Holmes school an asshole aristocrat, which he does beautifully.
So, the first thing I did after watching “Empty House” was write up a thing comparing
Doyle seems to be slowly dissolving the Great Partnership. At some point before “The Blanched Soldier” and “The Lion’s Mane,” Watson remarries, leaving Holmes not only working on his own but narrating his own adventures. At some point before “His Last Bow,” which is narrated in the third person, Holmes is sent on a multi-year undercover mission by the British government, apparently sans Watson (who is nevertheless in at the kill, disguised as Holmes’s chauffeur). But at some point before all that, Watson appears to have moved out; and this is the part that I (even as a child who didn’t know what ‘shipping’ meant) always found baffling and sort of painful. On the one hand, “Illustrious Client” starts out with Holmes and Watson in a Turkish bath together. On the other hand, Watson mentions casually afterwards that he had his own place in Queen Anne Street at this time. WHY? my plaintive younger self demanded. Why would you LEAVE 221B? VOLUNTARILY?
In fact, the Granada team often had trouble getting an hour’s worth of TV out of a single story without padding it or introducing laughably extraneous “action” sequences like the train chase at the end of “Greek Interpreter” (more on that in its own good time). But the better scripts were able to seize Doyle’s missed opportunities and add nuance and development that Doyle didn’t have the time for. “A Scandal in Bohemia,” since it’s the introductory episode, has plenty of work to do, so it keeps the pace up pretty well. Even better, it invests most of the extra time in character development, which is the real strength of the Granada project. Granada’s production values were pretty good (at the time) for heritage TV–but they don’t stand up that well in the twenty-first century. There is also some unevenness in the acting. Holmes, Watson, and Mrs. Hudson are all fantastic all the time. The guest stars are a mixed bag. Wolf Kahler–charitably described on IMDB as “a German-born character actor–is underwhelming as the King of Bohemia, and although Gayle Hunnicutt is lovely as Irene Adler, she’s not really as good as the part they wrote for her.
Thus transformed, “The Cardboard Box” acquires a kind of twisted irony that seems very modern to me, and very different from the canon story. Rereading “Cardboard Box,” I was surprised at how much I liked it. I thought maybe this was one of those adult-perspective-changes-things moments; but then I recalled that I must have liked it before, too, because “
Richardson brought to the role just the right combination of strength and vulnerability; she’s believable both as the intrepid investigator and as the endangered victim. It’s largely thanks to her and Ackland that the large chunks of this episode that don’t feature Holmes and Watson are gripping instead of boring (as in, say, “The Crooked Man”). The screenplay, meanwhile, seems to have attempted to mitigate *against* the Violet the Hunter reading. Some of the dialogue used to support that theory is reassigned (often to Watson), and when Watson is reading his conclusion out loud to Holmes at the end of the episode, he omits the line about being disappointed that Holmes no longer took an interest in her after the case was over. It’s probably Richardson’s performance that accounts for my love for an episode where Holmes and Watson do comparatively little, and it is proof that you CAN write an episode around a female character and still have it be a perfectly viable Sherlock Holmes story.
, which evidently was made between the two Return series. Gonna have to brace myself for that one.
“Priory School” is very entertaining, with a lot of action, interesting locations, and–in addition to some great scenes from Holmes–the added amusement of seeing Holmes and Watson on horseback and bicycle. There is also an attempt at some artistry on the part of the director, which I always appreciate.  But there are also some major deviations from canon, especially toward the end. The short story is that it appears to me that the adaptation, done by T. R. Bowen of “Abbey Grange” fame, seems to be more protective of young Lord Saltire than Doyle was. And yet, Bowen’s changes also rehabilitate the boy’s extremely culpable father. It raises some interesting questions about what we’re really doing when we say we’re ‘fixing’ something from canon.
So Watson’s quite aware of how he’s been played; and he makes his peace with it. And this is just one of those wonderful nuances that get into the Holmes/Watson relationship over the course of the Granada series. Holmes’s line about the fresh air killing him–which is not in the canon story–is consistent with Holmes’s canon characterization (ACD canon Holmes, as I have observed, loves London pollution and hates country air). But it also continues a little sub-narrative about Holmes, Watson, and holidays that they’ve been developing since “Musgrave Ritual.”
"Oh my dear, dear, darling man," said Holmes, softly. "I have always admired your stories."
And now, let me extol the virtues of paper as a stage prop. Compared to other things that Holmes handles in the Granada series–test tubes, magnifying glasses, syringes, fireplace pokers, revolvers–paper has the virtue of extending and amplifying the actor’s gestures. The arc a sheet of newsprint describes as it travels through the air is bigger than the arc the hand holding it would describe alone. Paper, because it’s flexible and strong but delicate, quivers and dances and flutters like an extension of Holmes’s own body and spirit. Through paper, Brett’s Holmes expands to fill the space around him, becoming an elemental force, whipping up a tornado and then making it rain. This is something Brett had obviously learned before playing Holmes; but never was this put to use more effectively than in the Granada Series.
And then, along with this nuanced verbal performance of Holmes’s uncertainty and doubt, you get the genius of Brett’s physical performance every time Holmes catches a break. In the best scene Brett and Hardwicke have together in this episode, Holmes is about to head out the front door for his initial investigations when Watson calls him back by telling him that the guy he was planning to visit has been murdered. This is in canon, but in canon the whole thing happens in the sitting room at 221B. Hawkesworth by now knows exactly how to milk this, and it’s glorious. Holmes comes running upstairs, and he and Watson are both so excited that they wind up standing in the hallway while Watson reads the story out of the paper as Holmes listens and interjects. Then Holmes grabs the paper and runs in, with Watson behind him, and finishes reading it out loud himself; and when Watson suggests that maybe the murder is a coincidence, he just tosses the thing in the air. As I observed re “Dancing Men,” I honestly think I would watch an hour of just Jeremy Brett interacting with paper. I don’t know why; maybe it’s nostalgia for the pre-digital world, which I actually remember. But I just love all the paper.
to this:
was Rupert Graves’s Lestrade. It was never easy for me to imagine a similar characterization or relationship in Granada Holmes; but now I can. And that’s worth the crap you put up with on the way to the revelation.
For kicks, I recently re-read “The Lion’s Mane,” which is just so much worse than I even remembered (for starters, Holmes the master of observation and deduction fails to infer that the victim met his death in the water because he evidently couldn’t tell from a visual inspection that the dude was WET). Everyone has their things about ACD canon that they want to reject. For a lot of people it’s Watson’s first marriage. But I find myself far more distressed by Watson’s *second* marriage, late in the game, to a woman never even vouchsafed a name. Mary Morstan, I can deal with. It’s a sad story all round but at least Holmes and Watson have each other after Watson’s double bereavement is over. Now I have to imagine Holmes retiring to the Sussex Downs ALONE? Are you trying to KILL ME?
Marina Sirtis, everyone. Counselor Deanna Troi. That’s her. She does a great murder stare but does not have much dialogue in this episode. Made me kind of wish they had cast her as Sophia Kratides in “Greek Interpreter” and done the whole double-murder thing. But I digress.
Could we maybe be looking at Holmes instead of at Holmes’s reflection in a spotty mirror? I mean, all right, this sets up a nice dissolve where Holmes’s cigarette smoke sort of becomes the smoke on the train where the Tiger of San Pedro will meet his end; but again, why the mirror?
"No," I said. "The only subject that could require richer color, et cetera, than a gem worth half of the Countess of Morcar's fortune...is you."
have been, on some probably unconscious level, about the production team processing their feelings about Brett’s own mental illness. What’s frustrating is that this could have been quite a compelling story; and every once in a while, as I said, some of its potential will be realized for a few fleeting moments. But it seems to me as if everyone behind the scenes who was involved in
it’s Tonga who kills Sholto with the poison dart; Smalls is so mad about it that he beats Tonga  with a rope until he draws blood. Hayes is a lower-class villain straight out of Ruffian Casting; he’s fine with bashing a guy’s head in, but James, the aristocratic and sensitive son of the aristocratic and sensitive Duke, is horrified by it. And yeah, that is Doyle letting his inner late Victorian shine through, and I can see how Bowen would have felt that needed fixing.
And yet.
Back in Baker Street at the conclusion of their investigation, Holmes subtly warns Watson that he might want to leave this one out of the chronicles. “A chaotic case, my dear Watson,“ he says. "It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is dear to your heart.” “Wisteria Lodge” is
So this means the following: 1) Holmes now recognizes the experience of watching your partner die as lethally terrifying. 2) This tells you something about how terrifying the prospect of Watson’s death is to him. 3) It also tells you something about how terrified he is of his own feelings about the fact that he inflicted this unspeakable horror on the person he loves most.
This, by the way, is a feature of Holmes as detective that will become very important for the genre. As we already know from “Blue Carbuncle,” Holmes’s #1 goal is not necessarily to punish the wrongdoer. Holmes is willing to, as he says later on in the story, “play tricks with the law of England” in order to get the result he thinks is best. The one constant is that he needs to know the truth–and that in order to secure Holmes’s sympathy or assistance, the suspect
how healing it is to watch Holmes and Watson genuinely reconnect, and to see the hurt and the remorse turn into forgiveness and rejoicing. This is the way it SHOULD be done, and only when you watch this scene can you really appreciate how fucking cruel to everyone involved the “Empty Hearse” reunion scene was.
“Dancing Men” offers opportunities for more complex emotions because of the tragic outcome. The emotional arc that Moffat and Gatiss spent four seasons drawing out more or less happens in this one episode; Holmes goes from telling Cubitt to shut up about his true love already and “get to the point” to growing anxiety about the danger menacing his client to feeling real shock and grief when he hears about the shooting. My favorite moment of this episode has always been the bit where they get the last message from Cubitt, and Holmes pins it up and starts translating it on the board, which is set up so the viewer can’t see what he’s writing. He says the first few words out loud, then just keeps writing. He and Watson watch the letters take shape with growing dismay. They stare at it for a moment, then look at each other, and then they both just ZOOM–with Holmes snatching up all the paper messages on his way out. You know, this is not flashy, it’s not technically complicated, it’s not rocket science. It’s a tad hokey when they show you the now-deserted chalkboard reading “ELSIE -RE-ARE TO MEET THY GO-.” But it WORKS.
When I found out that Trevor Bowen, who was responsible for the HOB script, also wrote the screenplay for “Frances Carfax,” I feared the worst. But it turns out that like Frances Carfax’s burial, my eulogy for this show was premature. Brett still looks like he’s been through hell, but he now seems to have come out the other side. His face is ravaged; but otherwise, his Holmes seems much more his old self. The voice is back, the energy is (partly) back, and in general there’s just a lot more acting going on. This is also a great episode for Hardwicke; I haven’t been this interested in his Watson since “Devil’s Foot.” I even like Trevor Bowen’s definitely not by-the-book adaptation…until the last five minutes, when it STABBED ME in the HEART.
The difference between the boyfriend as he had been presenting to her (and us) and the boyfriend revealed in those journal entries was STARTLING. He wrote about her personally in shockingly demeaning terms; but I think what definitively ended it for V was his description of participating in an especially vile form of sex tourism. And honestly, you would never have known from interacting with him. From what I hear from straight women, this is not uncommon. Evidently a lot of men learn how to simulate a personality in order to attract women they want to sleep with, inhabiting it so effortlessly that it can take a long time for the target to find out what he’s really like.
as if he is actually sinking into the water to drown. But right after his head disappears, the angle changes, and you discover that he’s standing in a boat which is being rowed across this little moat thing:
I wrote a song about Jeremy Brett. Here it is.
Paul does a good job of getting Holmes and Watson into the center of the action. Watson gets to pull the governess off the train himself, and the scene in which Watson and Holmes meet up at “Henderson’s” house (which Paul invents pretty much wholesale) is delectable, though one gets frustrated about Watson’s failure to perceive the urgency of the situation (dude, that woman trapped in the upper story who was signaling to you that she needed help SLIPPED YOUR MIND?). One cannot help but notice, however, that Paul seems to be writing with Burke and pre-1986 Brett in mind. Both Holmes and Watson are older and slower than the screenplay wants them to be, and you can really see it in the chase scenes (especially Watson chasing the cook–the cook is actually moving pretty slowly, but Watson is yet slower).
Well, I have a few theories. One is that Young Plaidder knew nothing of international relations, and was therefore ill-equipped to understand either the mystery plot or what was at stake. Another is that Young Plaidder had very little experience with subway trains or public transportation in general. Doyle doesn’t stop to define any of his terms, so if you don’t know what the “points” are, for instance, it’s hard to see what’s going on in your head. Or maybe it was that there’s only one woman in this story and she’s not especially important.
This adaptation thus provides even more confirmation of my Everything’s Better With More Watson theory. Watson is incorporated into the investigation in reasonably logical ways; but more to the point, we get to see Holmes and Watson on holiday, and it’s pretty funny. Holmes, who has a cold or maybe just hates fresh air, spends the first part of the episode swathed in shawls, flinging them about his shoulders as if they were Norma Desmond’s fox furs. I don’t know if the cold is supposed to be another symptom of addiction or what, but it definitely provides occasion for some entertaining acting choices. He’s petulantly uninterested in the Things You Do On A Visit To A Country House, sitting morosely on a bench (wrapped in God knows what) while Watson goes out to kill some grouse. It’s nice to see him and Watson getting to relax a bit, before everything goes down.
On the page, Holmes is immortal. He rises from the dead, and is allowed to drift off into various afterlives: keeping bees on the South Downs, international espionage, the Valhalla of the mind where it is always 1895. That’s part of what fascinates us about him: he never has to get old, he never has to die. Over time, film and TV adaptation preserves the myth of Holmes’s immortality by continually renewing the character and the stories so that a rejuvenated Holmes reappears, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and modern, with each iteration. But
we know both that Doyle read Poe’s detective stories and that he was very concerned to differentiate Sherlock Holmes from Dupin. The influence is undeniable, however. You know how Holmes is always complaining to Watson that he’s turning their cases into sensational tales instead of mini-monographs on the science of deduction? Well, if Watson ever listened to Holmes’s writing advice, all of Watson’s stories would come out like “The Purloined Letter.” There is a juicy story in there–a nefarious minister steals a sensitive letter from a royal personage via a brilliant but simple and daring stratagem, then immediately begins blackmailing her with it–but Poe is more concerned with letting Dupin discuss philosophy, mathematics, and the art of reasoning with his unnamed narrator friend. The Big Idea in “The Purloined Letter” is that in order to outwit a criminal, you have to adjust your own intellect to the level of said criminal. If you can’t make yourself either smart enough or stupid enough to think the way he does, you don’t win the game. Dupin gets the letter because he realizes that the nefarious Minister has had the simple, bold, brilliant idea of hiding the letter in plain sight. G. the official detective laughs his ass off at first when Dupin suggests that he might be failing because the case is too simple; but he’s pretty stoked when Dupin trades him the letter for a cheque for 50,000 francs.
All right, so let me first talk about the canon story. I’ve mentioned before that late Victorian London was trying to cope with a massive housing crisis and widespread unemployment fueled by a mass migration of people from the country to the city. All through the first 24 stories you can see little glimpses of the poverty and human misery that may be largely quarantined in the slums, but nevertheless occasionally infiltrates the world of Holmes and his middle-class clients. The “Baker street irregulars” introduced in
Unfortunately, Hawkesworth decides to be a stickler for canon when it comes to Watson, which undoes some of the good work done in the earlier episodes. Watson, in “The Final Problem,” is more than usually obtuse. You can’t really do anything about the fact that he falls for the note from the hotel; that’s integral to the plot. But you don’t have to include the moment when Watson sees a lone figure dressed in black climbing the mountain toward where he left Holmes, but thinks nothing of it. Hawkesworth does; and he shouldn’t have. Granada Watson is really not that stupid.
In the canon story, Holmes makes Watson a little speech about how dangerous and reckless this was and how sorry he is to have exposed him to all this danger. Watson treasures this moment because, he says, “I had never seen so much of his heart before.” As different as the adaptation is, this moment instantly captures the effect Doyle was striving for here. The first name tells you: this is a breakthrough moment. What’s happening here, and the visuals keep reminding us, is that they are re-playing the “Empty House” reunion scene, with the roles reversed and with a completely different kind of emotion from Holmes. In the reunion scene, Holmes also reaches out for Watson; but here, instead of saying, “I’ve come back to comfort you,” the same gesture says, “For the love of God, comfort me.” In “Empty House,” it’s Holmes bringing Watson around after his faint; here, it’s Watson trying to drag Holmes back to the land of the living. In “Empty House,” it’s Watson who has to grab onto Holmes to reassure himself that he’s real; here, it’s Holmes clinging to Watson for dear life:
It’s late, this week is still terrible, and I’ve got some time to consider a question that has been much on my mind of late: why is it that I love watching Jeremy Brett handle paper? I’m taking it up now partly because it was always my intention, after finishing the rewatch, to write up a post about why Jeremy Brett was the definitive 20th century Sherlock Holmes. But every time I start such a post, I think, oh what’s the point, it’s all already been said, by myself even, and anyway there’s too much. I’ve formulated a hypothesis, though, which is that if I can explain why Brett’s interaction with paper is so important to my enjoyment of this show, I will probably in the process be demonstrating what it was that made his Sherlock Holmes so unique and indelible. So follow me, friends, while I unfold my crackpot theories about the romance of the material text and how it binds us to the Master Paper-Handler.
Casting Jude Law as the stable lad who dresses up as Lady Beatrice makes this an entirely different kind of drag act. Joe the stable lad is really rather beautiful here; and in the next scene, when Holmes is getting Sir Robert to fess up, Joe’s crying in the background while Carrie comforts him. During one of the flashback scenes from Sir Robert’s confession, we see Robert sitting in the crypt, crying over Beatrice’s coffin. Joe is behind him, and puts a hand on his shoulder gently for a few moments before finally withdrawing it.
Holmes's hands traveled slowly, solemnly, through the air. I felt his hands against my temples, cool and burning somehow at the same time. His exalted gaze met my own. He drew my crowned head toward his own.
What can I say? This is the shit, right here. This is the H/W relationship against which all others eventually pale in comparison. Watson’s voiceover announces that the Granada team has decided to change the overall story arc, and Priority #1 was eliminating Watson’s marriage. Watson says that at the time of the case, he and Holmes had been living together for “some years.” He also says that every time he leaves Holmes for “any length of time,” he comes back dreading Holmes’s “moods.” As soon as he gets inside, he starts asking Mrs. Hudson about how Holmes is doing, and it doesn’t sound great. He goes up expecting the worse, sees the syringe in a half-opened drawer, gets righteously pissed off, and decides to just start right in: “Which is it tonight? Morphine or cocaine?”
I’ve always been fascinated by the fact that Watson can’t actually see the snake when it finally shows up. But I don’t have time to get into what that might mean. On to the next one!

murder: Sir Eustace’s immolation of Lady Brackenstall’s dog. I applaud the principle behind this addition even though the execution could have been better (the dog should not have been named “Fudge,” the name tag is obviously both modern and brand-shiny-new, and the tombstone’s placement is inexplicable): this incident is mentioned in passing in the canon story, but incorporating it into the investigation helps confirm for the audience what Holmes already suspects about the Brackenstalls’ marriage. (It is no one’s fault that this bit now reminds me of the exhumation of Mr. Tippy in the classic

And here we go. The end of Brett and Burke, and the end of my adolescent Granada experience. No longer will these write-ups be infested with irrelevant detail about my younger self, the ardent and idealistic Young Plaidder who watched these in the first bloom of her womanhood, blissfully unaware as yet of homophobia, institutional racism, the deep cynicism of American foreign policy, the Internet, reality television, gynecological cancers, and exactly how stupid a Repubican president could become. For Young Plaidder, the big loss after “The Final Problem” was not Holmes–who everyone always knows now is coming back–but Watson. When the series resumed after the hiatus, Burke was unavailable, and Edward Hardwicke was cast as Watson. I don’t yet know how Brett handled the transition; but Young Plaidder could not. I am loyal by nature, and once I get attached to an actor, I find it hard to let go.
” and I came to appreciate it more. It’s a very modern situation, in a way–a young boy sent to school, largely to protect him from trouble at home, is nevertheless drawn into his parents’ mess, and nearly destroyed in the crossfire. What struck me most forcibly when I returned to it was the poignancy of a nine year old boy thinking that he was taking matters into his own hands–sneaking out of school hoping to be reunited with his mother–and discovering the hard way that he’s no match for a malicious adult. But the ACD story is not really that interested in young Lord Saltire as a character; he never speaks, and Holmes and Watson never interact with him. I thought this might be a story that would be improved by expansion and dramatization. And I was not wrong. “Priory School” is very entertaining, with a lot of action, interesting locations, and–in addition to some great scenes from Holmes–the added amusement of seeing Holmes and Watson on horseback and bicycle. There is also an attempt at some artistry on the part of the director, which I always appreciate.

vibe.  Accordingly, in the Granada narrative, “Norwood Builder” takes place three episodes before “The Final Problem” (we have “Resident Patient” and “The Red-Headed League” coming up first). And thanks to some great work from the screenwriter and from Brett and Burke, this becomes, not just an interesting case, but a beautiful moment in the development of Holmes and Watson’s relationship.
. Granada’s “Empty House” establishes that during the Hiatus, Lestrade and Watson developed their own working relationship, and in this episode they both follow Holmes around like residents following the attending. Holmes obviously really enjoys the extra attention, and it spurs him to new heights of histrionics that are quite entertaining and by this time quite familiar. But it’s the final conversation between Holmes and Lestrade at the end of this episode that makes it worth sitting through all the BS about Italians. At that point, this episode becomes truly extraordinary. You would think that by this point in the series you’d have pretty much seen everything Brett could do with this character. But you would be wrong.
All right, let’s get the bad out of the way first: whoever devised the opening sequence of this episode should have been sacked immediately. I know it was the 1980s and everyone was really excited about the
Would you come walk with me in the snow?
First of all, let me give props where they are due: they were really making an effort with the production values on this one. Someone’s tried to make the cinematography visually interesting and thematically appropriate–I don’t know how cool that horse-cam really is, but points for giving us multiple points of view–and the locations are beautiful. They also seem to be working harder on making the corpses look deader. Oddly, the 221b interiors seem weird to me–maybe they weren’t able to recreate the old set for some reason, or maybe they decided to give it a makeover–but overall, this is a cut above.
I love their last little interaction at the dinner table for so many reasons. One, it flips the tables on the running gag about food; Holmes is about to just tuck in when Watson brings up Horner, and he’s the one left looking longingly at the untasted supper as they get up and head out to the police station. Two, it shows Watson getting what he *really* wants—justice for the innocent and suffering Horner—without having to stop Holmes from being Holmes. And three, I will admit, the Dickensian manipulation got to me even though I know better and I do sort of cry a little bit every time I see Horner coming out of the jail to embrace his two kids while his tearful wife looks on.
And then there’s Bowen’s sexualization of Sarah Cushing, which goes beyond what’s in the original story and which is used to transfer the responsibility for Mary’s death from her actual killer to the woman who somehow made him do it. In the canon story, after all, we only have Browder’s word for it that Sarah was responsible for turning Mary against him. Even if that’s how Browder sees it, that’s no guarantee that it’s true; and in any case, by blaming Sarah for the breakup of their marriage, Browder is not only shifting the blame away from himself but denying Mary’s agency–which is just a preview of the way Browder violently cancels Mary’s agency forever by killing her. His own description of the murders, while it tries to create the impression that it happened in an uncontrollable and consciousness-threatening burst of rage, also shows that he was absolutely not acting on impulse; he spends a LONG time following them, has to make several active decisions to *keep* following them, and has plenty of time to think better of it and go home. The fact that he appears to have regretted the murders immediately doesn’t mean he didn’t consciously intend them. Browder himself thinks he should hang, and the canon story agrees. Bowen, on the other hand, seems to think that his killing of Mary was in some way excusable, and scripts a final encounter in the jail cell with the ghost of Mary which I found extremely squirmy, which appears to have been intended as an opportunity for Browder to show us how much he ‘really loves’ her.

* A snake could not climb down a bell-pull. For snake locomotion they need something rigid to push against. You can totally tell this in the final credits of this episode, where the snake is quite obviously NOT crawling down a bell-pull, but rather crawling along the top of something which is really horizontal and probably either concealing or attached to a long wooden rod.
The episode ends with Lady Frances sitting in her invalid chair, with Green sitting behind her, looking over her shoulder. It’s a bright and sunny scene, but it’s also ominous. She doesn’t look very aware of her surroundings; he doesn’t seem to have any way of interacting with her except silently waiting in the shadows as he did before.

, IMDB informs me.) It is not helped at all by the guy playing Abe Slaney, who’s just terrible. But he’s only in one scene.
As I said, in “Illustrious Client” and “Creeping Man” the adapters were still fighting that narrative. In the “Memoirs,” they seem to have given in to it. Watson is spending a lot more time at his surgery than he used to, and he doesn’t appear in this episode at all. It’s true that in the canon story, he doesn’t have a lot to do that couldn’t be done by someone else; and it’s also true that Watson’s absence makes more sense out of the fact that these bozos allow Anna to literally expire before their eyes without either deducing that she’s taken poison or trying to get her to bring it up. But up to this point, fixing that has always been one of the goals of the Granada series–to make Watson a partner in the firm, rather than a perpetual apprentice. The effect of bringing Mycroft in here, on the other hand, is to reduce Holmes to the role of *junior* partner. Mycroft is the one who figures out where Anna’s been hiding and comes up with a method of getting her to show her tracks; Sherlock only works it out after Mycroft has dropped a couple of very obvious hints. That, let me just say, doesn’t make a lot of sense because Holmes does still get to notice the importance of the coconut-matting in both corridors; of what is that clue “suggestive,” if not the one that Hopkins has him failing to grasp?
and Jonathan Smalls in
Now, everyone loves this scene, and so do I. Woodley is such an asshole, and Holmes lays such a beatdown on him (physically and rhetorically), and the boxing part of it is credible enough to make it exciting. Woodley goes into it clearly thinking he’s going to make hash out of this pencil-necked geek, and it’s just so satisfying to watch training beat brute strength. “A gentleman uses the straight LEFT!” must be up there in the history of the great punch lines of British TV (har har). Even better is Holmes’s glowing self-satisfaction as he describes his triumph to Watson, who’s patching him up:
(thank you,
only began airing in 1993.”
So on their final trip to Farnham, Holmes has kind of already put himself in the detective doghouse; and then he finds out he’s miscalculated the timing. At that point, he and Watson are basically at the same level, effectiveness-wise; and from here on in they’re relying on each other. The other great moment in this episode is when Holmes tells Watson to go stop a spooked and runaway horse, and Watson just goes out and does it, while Holmes watches him go and says, “Good man!” Watson and Holmes sort of take turns chewing out Carruthers during the final explanation scene. Back in 221B, Holmes enjoys pulling the same ‘deduction’ trick on Watson that Watson played on him with Hilton Cubitt’s appearance in “Dancing Men” (pretending to have deduced something when in fact you have prior information about it). And of course his chemical experiment solves whatever’s going on with John Vincent Hound, but fills the entire flat with smoke and calls the fire brigade.
You are so much more than that
He drew me back down to him. I thought, as I unfastened his collar, that I had never really done him justice. I thought that if the shadow of fear could ever finally pass over us, I could paint him with all of my brightest tints, and not only scarlet. Vermilion, heliotrope, cerulean, fuschia. The brilliance of sapphire. The audacity of emerald. The sparkling evanescence of aquamarine. In another world, he could outshine any of these absurdly overvalued objects--scintillating, multifaceted, deceptively transparent, leading your gaze endlessly into his ever more brilliant depths.
Anyway, the real tragedy of “Thor Bridge,” alas, is that Gibson doesn’t learn that lesson, at least not permanently. Holmes’s sparring, delicious as it is, is basically just a temporary inconvenience. Gibson ends the story with everything he wants: his wife is dead, Grace Dunbar is cleared, and the final shot of them driving back over Thor Bridge together certainly suggests they will “join forces. Alas. But at least we’ve got Holmes and Watson back, along with the only other romance that matters on this show: Jeremy Brett and paper.
One of the things that makes Holmes exceptional, in canon and in Granada, is that he has successfully resisted the deadening process that separates so many of us from our sensory capabilities as we are socialized to deny all that input so that we may tolerate the sensory deprivations of the modern workplace for longer. To most of us a floor is a thing you stand on. That’s not what it is to Sherlock Holmes. That floor is talking to him.
Then there’s the fact that this story about people regressing to a simian state raises the specter of Victorian racism. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, one of the most common tropes used to deny humanity to a specific group of people was to depict them as simian. Racist Victorian scientists and anthropologists posited Africans as the evolutionary link between apes and Causcasians, thus dehumanizing Africans and putting some distance between themselves and their nearest primate cousins. But really, I shouldn’t call this Victorian racism, because that shit is
Holmes is never for a moment under the illusion that he’s on the side of the angels in this case. He is engaged in the cynical exercise of helping someone with a lot of power and money cover his ass, at the expense of a woman armed only with her wit and charm. One of tne of the most enjoyable things about Brett’s performance in this episode is how consistently he telegraphs Holmes’s contempt for his own client. The consultation scene is fantastic in that regard. Watson, once he finds out that the client is a King, starts trying to do all the royalty protocols; Holmes pointedly doesn’t give a shit. The King wants to wear a mask and call himself the Count von Kramm; Holmes addresses him as “your Majesty.” The King doesn’t want Watson there; Holmes tells him “it is both or none.” He mentions that the King has “killed four opponents” in duels; the King says “All of them honorably;” Holmes just laughs. I particularly love the moment when Holmes is running through all the reasons why this isn’t really a problem, and the King is responding to them. At first Holmes is dismissive; then, as he starts to realize the King hasn’t told him everything, you see Brett leaning forward with the gleam in his eye, gesturing impatiently at him,
1) This is the equivalent of the final shot of Sherlock in the graveyard at the end of “The Reichenbach Fall,” in that is promises us that more narrative is coming. The addiction plot set up in the first four episodes has been largely dropped in the more recent ones, without any resolution; maybe this is a promise that Holmes will come back so we can do his recovery narrative.
So at the end of the day, there is maybe some darkness hiding under all the holly. But overall, this rewatch was one of the happiest hours I’ve spent in front of the television. Or, in this case, computer screen.
Doyle invented Moriarty for the specific purpose of killing Holmes off. Moriarty plays no role in the saga as written prior to “The Final Problem.” The fact that this criminal mastermind had never come up in any of their past cases immediately struck fans as ridiculous, and it was in fact retconned by Doyle himself in
, before starting work on the “Adventures.” Granada Holmes was different because it went back to the text, instead of to the earlier adaptations, for its source–and because Brett rediscovered there a protagonist who threw himself into his work body and soul, just the way Brett did.
But, as I think I said in my review of “Bruce Partington Plans,” one of the consequences of Hawkesworth’s indifference to publication order is that Holmes can never quite take Watson for granted no matter how long they’ve been together. Brett’s Holmes always seems to be really anxious about whether Watson will accept these invitations; and yet at the same time, he also knows that Watson’s never once turned him down. In “Boscombe Valley” the little courtship dance we see in that telegram is drawn out until its workings become obvious to both Watson and the viewer.
How to go on with your part
: he ends the Blue Carbuncle’s trail of blood by taking it out of circulation. The fact that, in the Granada adaptation, we see it going into the same drawer that contains his syringe emphasizes the ways in which the stone’s possibly magical power over people simulates some of the effects of addiction. So he may be doing a public service; but he is also, possibly, feeding an illicit but irresistible desire.
stops to buy the paper first because he just can’t help himself.
Once Holmes has a puzzle to solve, though, downtime is over; and we share Watson’s joy and relief as Holmes’s engines start revving. Paul also makes the solution slightly more complicated by adding the oak tree weathervane, which helps explain how so many previous generations could have failed to solve this puzzle. (Why everyone assumes that the trees named in the ritual won’t have grown at all since 1649, I don’t know; but then I’m not a botanist, maybe it’s not bullshit.) But what I like about this one, and about “Dancing Men,” is that they manage to actually dramatize the finding of the solution, instead of just glossing over it. Brett’s good enough at drawing your interest that you can watch him messing around with fishing rods and twine and whittling pegs and whatnot and still be entertained. And watching them row him across the little moat thingy, standing erect in the prow of that tiny dinghy for all the world as if he were George Washington crossing the Delaware, is priceless:
I’m afraid that for me this exception proves the rules–the Norwood Builder Rules, to be specific. Early on, Holmes drops a snarky comment about Watson’s limited medical skills, and Mrs. Hudson says, “You only say that because you miss the doctor.” You can see immediately from his reaction that she has HIS number. Yes, Holmes misses the doctor and I miss him too. And this is another of those somewhat spooky ways in which Brett’s illness forces the Granada series to correspond with the canon arc–in which, toward the end of the saga, Watson starts to drop out of the picture.
Paul follows what I have come to think of as the
Sorry, that’s more in the “unambiguously goofy” range…how about this one:
Now, some of this is slightly mitigated when Neville is finally unmasked (I’m coming to that in a minute) and he tells the story of what really happened. In that sequence, at least, “the Lascar” is shown to be acting out of loyalty to him rather than out of cruelty to Mrs. St. Clair, and gets to be non-menacing and articulate for a couple minutes. But overall, not only does the scent of Orientalism remain strong, it pervades the whole production. I must say in all fairness that the adapter here is only following the Everything Should Come From Canon rule, because as Milligan argues, Holmes is described in “Twisted Lip” in very orientalizing terms, especially as he sits up all night smoking tobacco and dreaming his dreams. But I don’t know if it was really necessary to do the whole Buddha/enlightenment thing:
The episode ends with McFarlane and his mother at home, playing a version of the Granada theme on the piano. The loving teamwork of these two men has saved this poor child from Oldacre’s possessive, vindictive, malicious and destructive abuse of heterosexuality. Harris brings Watson in on the interview with McFarlane’s mother, which means that we get Watson’s reaction when she shows him the defaced photograph, and it is gratifyingly intense. After “Solitary Cyclist,” after “Speckled Band,” and after “Copper Beeches,” Watson has developed an instinctive recognition of toxic masculinity and a healthy revulsion and loathing of it. He’s learning; Holmes is learning. And I was learning, too: that two people of the same gender could make a good team, could become each other’s mainstay and support, could entwine their lives without losing their identities, and could use the camaraderie and the happiness that their love enabled to help other people. So this was an important episode, for me; and it was great to get to revisit it.
All this means, unfortunately, that we lose something I always thought was really cool about the original story, which is Holmes explaining to Watson how his preconceptions about Lady Brackenstall colored his perceptions and led him to misinterpret or dismiss evidence that went against the narrative. Where ACD canon Holmes is bothered, after he leaves, by a nagging feeling that something’s wrong with the evidence, the impression created in the adaptation is that he’s already concluded that the whole scenario is fishy and the question he’s really debating is not, did Lady Brackenstall collude in covering up the murder of her husband, but will he or won’t he let her get away with it. In the adaptation this is considerably compressed–he and Watson have the conversation about those three damn wine glasses, of which perhaps more later, but that’s all–and Holmes’s second visit to the scene is expanded to include the discovery of the episode’s
"Well, one must remember, Watson, that he was playing for the whole crown."
–which is where it fell in the original order anyway–this would have been one of the great ones. Think about it. How much would you give to be able to watch “Blue Carbuncle”-era Brett and Burke do
-style with actual torches chasing Wilder and Arthur into the depths of a system of caves, until Wilder, during the final standoff, falls to his death.
Watson will be back, of course. But the show will never be what it was, and neither will their on-screen relationship.
At any rate, especially on the day before James Comey, former director of the FBI, is going to go before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify about his interactions with our possibly treasonous President, I am slightly more interested in a story which is really about protecting not just state secrets themselves, but the honor of the career civil servants who work with them. Poor overworked, underpaid Cadogan West dies trying to stop a venal, amoral, brother-betraying aristocrat from selling his country’s military secrets to an enemy spy. I salute you, Cadogan West. It’s a good thing you’re not real and still alive, or you would be going OUT OF YOUR MIND right now.
Hawkesworth, I figure, was smart enough to know there was no way to actually show us any of that; to dramatize the story of how Holmes took down Moriarty’s gang you’d basically have to write your own feature-length film. What he does instead is give us a kind of micro-version of that story by creating the plot about the theft of the Mona Lisa. I have to say I’m not thrilled by this part of the episode. First of all, although stealing the Mona Lisa is certainly audacious, it suggests to me a certain lack of imagination–not so much on Moriarty’s part as on Hawkesworth’s. It was suggested, I suppose, by Holmes’s commentary on Moriarty’s suspiciously pricey private art collection in
Honestly he looks like he is on the way to a Victorian-themed BDSM party. Even worse, the director decided to do a whole Blindfold Motif thing:
I really enjoyed “Abbey Grange,” partly because of the interesting choices made by Trevor Bowen in the adaptation. In addition to following the Everything’s Better With More Watson rule most admirably, Bowen makes some changes regarding Holmes’s interactions with Lady Brackenstall. Bowen seems to have conceived of Lady Brackenstall (nee Mary Fraser) as the protagonist, and he spends a lot of time developing her and dramatizing her backstory. In the process, he generates some really interesting new material for Watson. And since I just had the experience of contrasting the Granada return with the Sherlock return, I could not help think of this adaptation as a really interesting example of how you can center a heterosexual relationship and a female character in a narrative without abjecting the queer characters who share it. Which is a thing that some more modern adapters have abjectly failed to do, naming no Moffats or Gatisses. In “Abbey Grange,” the fact that Holmes winds up playing fairy godmother to a different Mary and a different John (no lie, that is the name that “Jack” is a diminutive of) in no way erodes his own autonomy and dignity, and ultimately both strengthens and complicates his bond with Watson.
That’s the real reason he’s so happy to see that Watson is starting to look for evidence of McCarthy’s innocence: it shows him that Holmes’s plan to use his expert testimony to destroy the prosecution’s case against McCarthy
In “Wisteria Lodge,” there are opportunities galore to exploit the doubling feature, since Holmes is given an unlikely doppleganger in Inspector Baynes of the Surrey constabulary. Indelibly played by Freddie Jones, Baynes looks and acts like every sad-sack, seedy, possibly corrupt backwater cop you’ve ever seen on TV; but in fact, he turns out to be an unsung Sherlock Holmes left to “stagnate in the provinces.” Holmes spends much of the episode veering between irritation and admiration as Baynes keeps scooping him–the unkindest cut of all being Baynes’s long and very complete deduction riff based on Senora Durango’s handwritten note. Jealousy is not a good look on Holmes, who is reduced to scraping a few trivial and useless dedcutions from the bottom of the deduction barrel. And here, it seems like the mirroring has a point: Hammond goes to some lengths to ensure that Holmes and Baynes mirror each other:
I’ve always said that one of the best things about
started doing this in series 2, and some of these episodes (“Blink,” for instance) are extremely effective. But nobody in their right mind would have chosen “The Three Garridebs” as the vehicle for such an episode. Making “Garridebs” with no Sherlock Holmes makes about as much sense as trying to bake an apple pie without apples.
And yet, at the same time, Holmes is also wrong. He realizes that after the debacle at the bank: by trying to save Lady Frances from the trap he foresees, he’s actually pushed her into it. After all, think about what she sees when she looks over the balcony. Green is tearing into Watson; the police are all over them; and while her one protector is unable to assist, a man she’s never met before goes charging up the stairs after her. Of course she runs. She doesn’t know Holmes from Adam; all she knows is that he’s with Green and he wants to grab her.
In other words, though by and large Watson doesn’t realize it, Holmes is training Watson. He’s involving Watson not just as his Boswell, but as his detective apprentice. And this is kind of huge. We’ve all always known Watson was the action guy– “Scandal in Bohemia” established that–but here, Skene departs from the story as written to show us Holmes teaching Watson how to solve the puzzle–and Watson eventually learning it.

of them if it comes for one of them, and that he never wants Watson to go through that again.
Well, I would not say they made it better. They just made it weirder. This has to be one of the trippiest episodes ever.
wind up as poor and helpless as Turner, that just underlines the fact that he’s not there yet.
So my hypothesis is that Doyle picked out the gravesite first and then had to figure out how to get Holmes and Moriarty to it, and that explains Holmes’s apparently boneheaded decision to ‘escape’ Moriarty by eloping with Watson. But of course this is useless as fanon. Fandom’s ultimately goal, really, is to bury the author, because the impossible desire driving fandom is always to make the imaginary real. An ill-concealed authorial intervention like the continental holiday is obnoxious to fans because it reminds us that our favorite character is an artificial construct. So one of the earliest fan theories formulated was that the whole trip was an elaborate attempt on Holmes’s part to assassinate
what he did to Watson by deceiving him. His experience of those three years was completely different from Watson’s. For Holmes, those years were about cheating death: staying one step ahead of the assassins until he could come back home and shut them down for good. For Watson, the same years were about accepting Holmes’s death and learning to live with it. As much fun as they’ve been having since “Empty House,” they’re still far apart in ways they don’t want to talk about.
episode which starts with Watson on holiday by himself. One imagines–I imagine, anyway–that Holmes finally just said look, these ‘holidays’ make me miserable, but you obviously need them; so go out there and get as much fresh air as you want, just leave me to poison myself in London. And yet, Holmes can apparently only stand so much tobacco-enshrouded solitude before he goes galloping down to wherever Watson is holidaying to drag him off on a case.
It’s an achievement, really, that
Holmes asks the King for money up front, something he hardly ever does–partly to get the money, of course, but also to send the King a message: please do not allow yourself to believe even for a moment that I’m taking this case for any other reason. Certainly not because I’m honored to be consulted by a guy with a title; and definitely not because I give a damn about
I don’t blame Bowen for finding this unsatisfying. After all, Holmes has only the Duke’s word that Wilder will be gone, and there is plenty of evidence that Wilder has always been and will always be a real threat to Arthur’s safety (as I shall henceforth call young Lord Saltire). The business with the check probably seemed to Bowen to be unworthy of Holmes, especially after taking such a high-handed approach with the Duke up to this point. And yet, all of this is perfectly consistent with Holmes’s earlier behavior in cases like “Scandal In Bohemia,” “Blue Carbuncle,” and “Abbey Grange.” As long as he knows, and he is satisfied that justice as he understands it is being done, he’s not about helping out the police–and he’s shown himself plenty willing to take money off aristocratic clients, especially if they’ve given him attitude. “Discretion” is one of the things that people like the King of Bohemia pay him for, and Holmes knows that, and he’s made his peace with it–because the Kings of Bohemia fund his investigations on behalf of all the governesses and music teachers who can’t afford him. If he makes a habit of dragging all his aristocratic clients through the press, pretty soon he won’t get any more.
Up to this point, of course, the show has dropped that ball many times. During the making of
"My heart," he said.
"About your story," Holmes said, at last, as we lay together by the fire. "I have only one complaint to make."
Bowen’s most inspired invention, though, was definitely the fight at the bank. I love everything about this. Holmes is up there on the balcony, effortlessly spinning out his story for the bank manager, and he looks back to Watson for backup as he so often has…and Watson’s not there. And Brett’s reaction to seeing Watson making a beeline for Green on the floor below is priceless. On the one hand, he has this look of absolute horror as he foresees the entire debacle about to unfold. And yet, there’s this fatalism about it even as he tries to stop him; because Holmes knows Watson’s gonna Watson and this impending disaster is in fact the Watsoniest thing Watson’s done in his whole life and what force on earth can stop him? This is basically everything he loves Watson for: his loyalty; his love for his friends; his willingness to put himself on the line for the people he cares about; his single-minded determination to do the right thing at all costs. Watson being Watson happens to be the worst thing that could happen at this particular moment. But part of that agonized expression on Holmes’s face is the pain of being torn between his knowledge of how disastrous this is and his affection for all the parts of Watson that are leading him to commit this blunder. This is all foreshadowed, in fact, in the opening scenes with the figurines, when Holmes picks up what appears to be a child’s building block, looks at it, and says, “Watson, you’re a brick.” Bricks are dense. They are, however, also sturdy, trusty, and to be relied upon; and you can’t build anything without them.
Still the peacock of this firm, even if the plumage is more subdued…and then this weird moment when Holmes, after objecting to the mini-Christmas tree, decides to decorate his lab equipment:
There’s a fine line between a chase scene and a train wreck.
So I can sort of get down with the anachronisms and the tonal contrasts created by crossing “Red Headed League” with “Final Problem.” In some ways, the forced union of these two plots works less well. Athelney Jones’s role in all this, for instance, is pretty incoherent. Holmes refers to him as “an absolute imbecile in his profession,” which based on Jones’s role in
this rewatch has been kind of a masochistic exercise. “The Cardboard Box” is definitely not one of Granada’s better episodes. But as show finales go…well, I’m an
I don’t care whether you think Holmes and Watson are platonic besties or ace soulmates or are doing it on the regular on the hearthrug in the 221b sitting room: whatever you think the true nature of the Great Partnership is, the first time you read these three paragraphs, you realize you have been waiting for them all your life. Finally, the grand emotions of the Great Partnership attain full expression. This moment is as full of vindication, validation, astonishment, and love for the reader as it is for Watson. And for Holmes–that initial moment of panic and denial says so much both about what Watson means to him and how ill-equipped he is to cope with his own feelings. I generally don’t endorse extrajudicial murder; but we have to imagine Holmes is making that threat mainly for Watson (and for the reader): oh by the way, Watson, in case you were wondering, I can now confirm beyond a shadow of suspicion that if in fact anyone ever seriously harms you, I will FUCK HIS SHIT UP.
There are only two things that Marlowe and/or the director seem to have been really interested in this episode. One is the opening scene showing Sutton’s nightmare about death, and the other is the almost-silent scene in which Holmes goes over the crime scene collecting evidence. As for the first of these…well, it’s different. Cheesy and very 80s…but different. The second one is legitimately compelling and a good showcase for Brett’s abilities (although not necessarily for the cinematographer’s). But it’s really not enough to sustain an hour of television.
It was an uncanny moment. It’s like having someone work in the next cubicle over for five years and you sort of chat once in a while but don’t really talk and then all of a sudden you discover one day that you were actually friends with her in kindergarten. It’s freaky.
One has the impression that Hawkesworth might have decided, back in the early 80s, to hold “Boscombe Valley” in reserve. It’s a comparatively early story, written back when Doyle and Holmes were still making their reputations; and it’s longer and more complex than many others, so it lends itself better to episodic TV. But whereas delay was, as I’ve lamented, pretty much fatal for
Now there is, to me, a very obvious reason that Doyle did this: he wanted Holmes to die in the Reichenbach Falls and he wanted Watson to be able to tell the story, and a holiday on the Continent was the fastest way he could think of to make that happen. Why the Reichenbach Falls? Well, you have to remember that the reason Doyle killed Holmes in the first place was that he wanted to be able to pursue his other writing, hopefully in more Literary and Prestigious directions. “The Final Problem” may have issues when it comes to plot, but Doyle was obviously concentrating primarily on providing Holmes with a grand exit worthy of his exalted status, and since the days of Byron and both Shelleys, for readers of English literature the Swiss alps had been the pinnacle, if you will, of the sublime. The Falls themselves are sufficiently dramatic, chaotic, and turbulent to be the resting place of someone who, as Holmes observes in “The Red Headed League,” spent his entire life trying to avoid stagnation and boredom. Watson’s description of the Falls reaches for a loftier tone than he usually aims for, and honestly I think contains ‘his’ best writing:
All the reviews in this series were written during a rewatch I did in the months after my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. Going back to this show, which I first encountered on PBS in the mid-1980s as a misfit teenager who didn't yet know she was a lesbian, was one of the things that helped me keep it together while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation. (She's fine now.)  At the time I was watching the Adventures and Memoirs in the basement with my little sister, I couldn't imagine I would ever find love. And now here I was, watching it again in my late 40s, faced with the possibility of losing my wife of 28 years to the same disease that carried off Brett's wife Joan Sullivan in 1985. This song is me trying to understand what it means that Brett was there for me during both of these difficult times. I don't sing, so I can't perform it; but here are the words.
. But mirrors also have the power to distort reality, or to reveal truths that elude the naked eye; and they can be used to make twins or doubles out of two distinct people (such as, for instance, Holmes and Watson).
So I was talking before about how many things are wrong with the canon “Final Problem.” The canon “Empty House,” really, in a lot of ways is even worse. Doyle wasn’t expecting to have to retcon “Final Problem,” and he didn’t leave himself that much wiggle room (though the fact that he killed Holmes in such a way that the body couldn’t be recovered does suggest to me that he had some unresolved ambivalence about killing off his cash cow). Others have pointed out that Holmes’s explanation for why he played dead for three years doesn’t make a whole lot of sense given that the people he says he was trying to fool–i.e., Moran et al.–are exactly the people who knew he was alive all the time. There are other technical problems that bigger canon geeks than I geek out about–someone wrote an entire poem about the fact that it’s impossible to figure out where Moran would have shot Adair from–but the adaptation exposes one of the biggest, which is the wax dummy in the window of 221b. Holmes says he’s surprised that Moran fell for it, and by God so am I. Sure, the profile is perfect and Mrs. Hudson is moving it from time to time. But it’s also very obviously not alive. This is the kind of thing that becomes more obvious on film than it is in print. Doyle also doesn’t do a great job of making us care about the Adair murder for its own sake. Clearly the main business of the story is the Reunion, and the actual case is–if you will–window dressing.
But in Marlowe’s adaptation, Holmes starts judging Sophia as soon as they get to the house. “One wonders,” he says, “with how little remorse” Sophia abandoned her brother to his fate. He’s even harsher with her in the train compartment. And when, after she’s led off in handcuffs into the mist, Watson asks what will become of her, Holmes says, “Nothing. It’s not a crime to have a cold heart without a single shred of compassion.” And then, for no reason, Watson walks off in the opposite direction so that Holmes can disappear into the mist, like the lonely, misogynistic, cynical hardboiled detective he has suddenly become.
I open this journal once more, not to record an adventure, but to impress a memory upon my heart. I wish, for the moment, that I had in my hands something more lasting than pencil and paper. In that dream world of which I can now sometimes catch the occasional glimpse, where everything is as one's heart desires it, this would not be a sheaf of paper but a copper plate on which to etch an intricate design, or marble in which to chisel an ideal form. But I belong to the humble world of mortal flesh and its immortal diseases, and must work with the tools within reach of my hands.
But when Watson says “death is always with us,” that opens things up on a lot of levels. In one sense, it’s a universal truth: we’re all mortal, death is a certainty for everyone. Implied, of course, is a message to Holmes: you’re mortal too, and if you don’t start taking better care of your body you’re going to destroy it. But I think it also has a personal meaning, as in: death is always with
Now I trudge around town
But the whole thing just goes off the rails as soon as Latimer tries to make a break for it. First of all, Holmes basically kills Latimer. Latimer is the idiot who tries to escape from a moving train; but he’s hanging from the door, shouting for Sophia to help him, and Holmes deliberately physically prevents both Sophia and Watson from doing it. After Latimer falls to his death, Watson is, quite properly, horrified by Sherlock’s complicity. This isn’t just the collateral damage we saw in “Speckled Band” and “Copper Beeches;” this is vintage Dirty Harry-style vigilantism. And quite frankly, I hate that shit; but even people who don’t hate it like I do know enough to know that this is out of character.
–Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, “The Cardboard Box.”
And then I realized: the Holmes/Watson stuff in this episode is what you might call roommate comedy. These are basically sitcom-level interactions based on an “odd couple” dynamic: two people who really shouldn’t get along, and bicker a lot for that reason, but at the end of the day really are friends. The only bit of it that rises above that level is the conversation at the barbershop at the beginning (and the two of them walking arm in arm back to the flat afterward). It’s sort of funny, but it doesn’t…I don’t know, it fails to convince me that it’s Holmes and Watson–this particular Holmes and Watson–and not some other odd couple.
All right, well, at least they started strong, let’s hope things pick up in…let’s see what’s next…ah, “The Priory School.” That should be interesting.
You MISERABLE FUCKERS.
I love the way he waggles Gibson’s letter at Watson, like, come and get it, you know you want it. Like this is his courtship ritual. “Note how this
Paul also emphasizes the fact that Isadora is Of A Certain Age, something with which Holmes consoles himself in the final conversation with Watson. Watson, as usual, is protesting the fact that she will face no consequences either for organizing his own beating or for her treatment of Douglas Maberley. Let me just say in passing that Maberley’s suffering is depicted in flashbacks in the most melodramatic and over-the-top way imaginable, as if the episode is deliberately trying to be as bad as Maberley’s terrible autobiographical novel must surely be. Paul ties Maberley’s death to the beating, so Holmes is not just “compounding a felony, as usual,” but letting go of an unresolved murder investigation. But Holmes is satisfied to know that he’s done Isadora Klein out of her last chance to be a Destroyer of Men: “Time is not on her side.” Knowing that he’s aging is more satisfying to him than any other revenge he could imagine.
"My heart," I answered.
at their first meeting,
and we’re back to Dr. Watson’s Very Bad Day. And here, you know, I’m just going to admit that I would have enjoyed the Watson stuff in this episode more if it were still Burke. I can’t help it. But moving on: again, this episode can’t decide whether it’s comic or scary. Possibly the biggest problem this creates is the Big Reveal in Hugh Boone’s jail cell, where they honestly try to get menace and suspense and creepiness out of a freaking sponge:

"You did?"
I heaved a sigh. Holmes drifted toward me. One of his hands came to rest, gently, tentatively, upon the top of my head. I was vexed to feel my throat constricting.
The GIF slows that down; at normal speed it’s less seductive and more comic (I love the way he leaves, then pops back in to nag him some more: “Get your clothes and come!”). But anyway…here, I guess, is my point. Sure, Granada always shows them in separate beds, and in other ways refuses to Make It Canon. But Granada never pretends, even for a moment, that Holmes is heterosexual. Everything he does for Mary Fraser and John Crocker in this episode is done
What they use at this point in the montage is various false-color versions of the footage they shot of Holmes and Moriarty falling off the cliff for the end of “Final Problem.” But of course what’s shown in that footage is something that never actually happened. Holmes never did go into the chasm. It’s Watson’s
bad news?"
I fully applaud the decision to eliminate Watson’s marriage. If Doyle had known, when he wrote
But sometimes, you can’t blame the boring on that alone. “The Crooked Man,” as a story, poses a lot of challenges for the adaptor, the main one being maintaining the viewer’s interest. Arthur Shaughnessy, who wrote the screenplay, rose to some of those challenges and not to others. Ultimately, this episode turns out to be a pretty good demonstration of the major strengths and weaknesses of the Granada team. That this adaptation does nothing to mitigate the orientalism, the jingoism, and the Victorian attitudes about disability that are baked into Doyle’s story is one issue. But the main problem–not unrelated, I would argue, to the first one–is that the farther into the episode you get, the more boring it becomes.
I guess I could just say: I know this feeling. I recognized it IMMEDIATELY. It is the feeling of someone who, say, has been in a relationship for 20 years and is suddenly offered the opportunity to make it legal. It’s the feeling of discovering, suddenly, that things
. And every time you shoot up, every time you chase after someone bigger and stronger and more heavily armed than you, every time you skip a meal or work for 72 hours straight, I see what’s coming. Every time you neglect or mistreat your body, I know you’re bringing us closer to the day when the worst thing in the world is going to happen to me. Again.
universe, where the text has dematerialized.
…and then storms off, while Brett gives the most priceless look at the camera, murmuring, “Maybe I’ll see you tomorrow?” and then casting an exasperated glance heavenward as the door slams. In general, Holmes’s snark game is strong in this one–it’s good for him to have Lestrade back–and it carries us through a lot of this episode. Sure enough, Watson is in tow when they reach Presbury’s house, and Holmes feels confident enough to air a little of their business as they head up the stairs to Edith’s window: “I’m glad to see you’re more yourself today; you were a veritable BEAR last night.” When Holmes has is epiphany over the Evening Standard in the middle of the night, he goes clomping up the stairs shouting for Watson, thus reassuring us that in fact they’re still living together (in the canon story, they’re not). Watson, meanwhile, bitches about the task he’s been given but does it anyway. My favorite moment for Watson, actually, is when Holmes says it’s time to go back to Dorak’s shop to kick some ass, and Watson says he’ll be delighted. He’s so looking forward to watching Holmes deal with those jackasses who threatened him.
Look, it’s Holmes and Watson finally sharing a cell together!
I said it 30 years ago and I’ll say it again: Gentlemen, I call bullshit.
I don’t normally post two reviews in one day; but this isn’t going to take long.
is quite engaging as Mycroft; if anything, he’s a little too avuncular and affable for someone whose supposed “shyness and misanthropy” qualifies him for the Diogenes Club. But it’s all kinds of fun watching Holmes and Watson interact with him and react to him. Brett convinces us of the long-standing relationship instantly and effortlessly,  and Burke…well, much about Watson’s love admiration for Holmes is conveyed by the look of pure wonder and joy on his face as he discovers that in fact the universe is marvelous enough to contain TWO human beings like Sherlock Holmes.
is is a smackdown of Victorian materialism and a defense of intangible things like beauty, which both hard-line industrial capitalists and liberal reformers would dismiss as “extra”–because they don’t have a monetary value and don’t satisfy a bodily need. On that level, I can certainly appreciate this speech; but it has to be said that it’s out of character and a propos of nothing. Paul cuts out the heart of this passage–everything from “All other things” to “an embellishment of life, not a condition of it”–and leaves us with pretty much pure sentiment, which exacerbates both problems.
And then of course, paper so often serves as an intermediary between Holmes and Watson–as a kind of indirect caress. You could base an entire drinking game around the number of times that one of them will pick up a document, read it, and then hand it to the other one to get his opinion. At times this move becomes, IMHO, unambiguously flirtatious:
And in how many fanfics…but no. No, in canon,Holmes calls on the Duke, manipulates him into writing out a check for the 6,000 pounds’ reward, and then tells the Duke the jig is up:
Oh, Moffat and Gatiss.
Holmes confidently assures Williamson and Woodley that “a forced marriage is no marriage, but a very serious felony;” but Holmes fans have been skeptical of this assertion from way back. At least as late as the eighteenth century, the mere fact that the woman had not consented to the marriage was not enough to invalidate it under English law. From the fact that forced marriage was only criminalized in the UK in 2014, it would appear that Holmes’s confidence was misplaced. In any case, historically, the most effective way for the perpetrator of a forced marriage to prevent the victim from challenging it legally was to rape her afterward, which ruined her ‘value’ in the marriage market and thereby made her family less likely to fight to get her back. This is clearly what Carruthers fears Woodley is planning to do to Violet; but due to Victorian sensibilities and no doubt the
So in the adaptation, “Boscombe Valley” loses some of the canon story’s youthful exuberance; but it also gains some depth. In particular, I think, Hawkesworth uses this opportunity to give us a closer look at Holmes and Watson’s dynamics, and at the complexity of Holmes’s unofficial position.
So this is now our third dramatization of a story revolving around a woman who’s left some money that a man is trying to pry out of her. (“Solitary Cyclist” and “Speckled Band” are the others). And, as with the other two, this is really a story about how vulnerable Victorian women still are to male predation. And yet in each case, the client is valued and trusted by Holmes for her courage and her independent spirit. This is why I have always had so very little patience for Moffat’s bullshit about how
), this is what would naturally occur to a guy who does not like to wait for results. Doyle did a similar experiment on himself with gelseminum, and wrote it up as an article. Holmes takes what Doyle would have considered sensible precautions: he ensures proper ventilation, reduces the dose, and uses the buddy system. The fact that it nearly kills both of them anyway is really a testament to the astonishing toxicity of this particular substance, though Holmes does berate himself afterwards for having ever thought this was a good idea.
. Y’all can do this if you want, Moffat and Gatiss, but this is NOT what I signed up for.
This brings me to the way Holmes relates to Lestrade in this episode, which is noticeably more prickly than even in the original story. Brett keeps the character fresh by painting with a different emotional palette in each new episode. Here, he’s nervous, anxious, and irritable from the moment Lestrade shows up. It REALLY bothers him that he is now dependent on Lestrade’s permission to speak to his client or to visit the crime scene. He’s painfully aware, in a way that he hasn’t shown us before, of how much more material power Lestrade has than he does. Whether McFarlane is guilty or not, Lestrade can get him hanged with what Oldacre’s given him, and Lestrade certainly seems determined to do so. With them actually working at cross purposes, Holmes has to confront the limitations of his ‘consulting’ position in a new way, and he hates it. Even more does he hate the fact that “all the facts are one way, and all my instincts the other.” This is a story where Holmes, up to a certain point, has to trust his gut–and he’s desperately uncomfortable in that position. Brett brings all of this through beautifully, and turns something that in the story is more of a friendly competition into a kind of existential crisis: can I really go up against the police and beat them? Can they, just by virtue of being The Police, defeat me even if I have logic and instinct and intelligence on my side? Does the way the facts themselves seem to be obeying Lestrade’s hypothesis mean that I am actually on the wrong side of this one–that I am wrong to be always seeing solutions that the official police don’t perceive or acknowledge, not only now, but maybe frequently? Maybe almost always?
I could not quite believe what I was hearing.

I will call it first relative to the story as written; and then I will talk about how the Granada adaptation does full justice to both Violet Hunter’s extraordinariness and Holmes and Watson’s respect for her.
while they did the rest of their business, as the adults in the canon story undeniably do. You can see
reasons that women like Violet Hunter were dependent on the protection of male figures. The reconstruction of Violet’s first meeting with Rucastle at Westaway’s does a fantastic job with this. Violet is one of a million single women of genteel background in London who are looking for a situation. Her profession requires her to go, alone, into the house of a bunch of complete strangers and live there, cut off from outside help, often without getting any actual cash payment until the end of the quarter. It’s a situation ripe with the potential for abuse, and this scene really brings that home. It’s clear from Richardson’s reactions in this scene that she is picking up creeper vibes from Rucastle immediately; and indeed, they are powerful enough to be registering in telegraph wires 10 miles away. She’s well aware that all of the weird questions Rucastle is asking her–would you mind wearing what we tell you to wear, and moving the way we tell you to move–and Rucastle’s obvious fascination with her physical appearance would all admit of one fairly simple explanation: he’s not looking for a governess, he’s looking for a sex toy, and he’s already got some fairly kinky scenarios he plans to enact as soon as she shows up, possibly with his wife. So she and Rucastle are having this very sexually charged conversation, as Violet tries to defend herself without outright angering Miss Stoper’s new favorite client, while Miss Stoper sits there behind the desk pretending this is a normal interview–because she wants the commission. Violet is being put at risk here not just by the Big Bad but by Stoper’s clearly marked decision to overlook the obvious sketchiness of this situation in order to make a buck for her agency. That she’s essentially pimping Violet out to a client planning to abuse her doesn’t bother Miss Stoper at all. Probably she’s done it before.
See…I videotaped these–YES! I TAPED these episodes as they were broadcast on PBS, using a VCR, so that I could watch them later, because that was THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT at the time–and I watched them kind of a lot. These opening credits were my friends. “Natasha Richardson,” I would say, in the days long before IMDB was thought of. “Wonder if she’s related to Miranda Richardson. Well, she was good, anyway.”
I’d like to thank everyone who encouraged me, in the comments on my writeup of
In the course of this rewatch, I have found myself reaching for the phrase “this episode is uneven” pretty often. With Granada Holmes, there are a few episodes where it’s all good– “Blue Carbuncle,” “Speckled Band,” “Second Stain”–but there are a lot more episodes where you have to take the good with a certain amount of bad. So far, though, I can’t recall another episode that gives you the best and the worst that Granada Holmes had to offer in such close proximity. In the course of dramatizing Beppo’s backstory, there were so many, many terrible choices made. The first five minutes of this episode are so squirm-inducing you could well pull a muscle watching them. The squirming commences anew any time any of the Italian-speaking characters reappear for any reason whatsoever.
The dematerialization of the text in the digital age is something we will all eventually take for granted; but it is a big deal, and I believe that some part of us mourns the loss of the tactile. To think, as late as the early 1990s, I was regularly writing letters, of some length, to friends in faraway places. Somewhere under my bed right now are boxes of letters written to me by my family, by my friends, and by Mrs. Plaidder, during times when we were physically separated. A handwritten letter conveys the writer to you in ways that electronic communication does not. So when I see some fool having a roll in the hay with a letter,
But to me the most important thing this episode offers is an image of human perseverance in the face of the inevitable. I know some fans argue that they should have stopped making the series after “Case Book.” I can see merit to that position. What’s on record in “Three Gables” is not a great performance or a masterful dramatization of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. But it is a record of someone living through the shitstorm that is human mortality, just trying to get the best out of the body that you have and the time you’re given, trying to hold onto as much life as you can while you’re dying. Maybe you have to be who I am and where I am right now to value that. But I find that I do; and I’m grateful for that.

.  And now, let me favor you with my thoughts upon re-viewing the episode that introduced Jeremy Brett’s Holmes and David Burke’s Watson to a soon-to-be adoring public: “A Scandal In Bohemia.”
At the same time, the screenplay makes this “chaotic case” somewhat more chaotic. I can’t understand, for instance, why Paul didn’t make it clearer that the whole point of Scott Eccles was to provide Garcia with an alibi. It can be inferred, but I think it’d have been easier on the viewer if someone had discussed that explicitly, as Holmes does in the story. The final shootout on the train is also so artistically done that it took me two viewing to figure out what the hell was going on. Nevertheless, I have to applaud Paul for that divergence from the original story; it’s more satisfying, and it also humanizes the cook by providing him with a rational motivation for his return trip to the house–to get the other pistol and complete the mission.
In the canon story, that’s the end of it. But this episode has more in store for Watson. First, we find out that Holmes was wrong in thinking that Watson was gullible for buying Lady Brackenstall’s account of her husband’s drinking. In a conversation with her on the way out, we learn that she was really describing her father’s drinking, and he tells her he knew she couldn’t have come up with something so realistic from nowhere. Doctor Storyteller knows his shit, even if he’s not as smart as Holmes. Then, there’s a very interesting conversation with a couple of snifters by the fire, in which Watson warns Holmes against making himself “both the advocate and the judge.” This is consistent with Watson’s reaction to Holmes letting Ryder off at the end of “Blue Carbuncle;” but here, although he went along with it at the time, Watson is less willing to let Holmes off the hook. And actually, this is the moment at which I think I made my peace with Hardwicke as Watson. I would say, comparing him to Burke, that Burke is a more intuitive actor, and I really miss that. I also miss the snap and fire his disputes with Brett used to have. But Hardwicke is maybe more cerebral, and this helps with these moments where Watson’s demonstrating his expanding wisdom. His affection for Holmes is never in doubt during this scene, but we also see that he’s lost the starry-eyed wonder that Burke was so good at conveying. “It’s just as well you are unique,” he says, finally. I love the reactions here. Holmes is unnerved by this. Watson smiles at him to reassure him. But Holmes is not, finally, entirely reassured. They go back to drinking their snifters by the fire, and the film freezes on that image for the closing credits.
as much independence or agency as Doyle gave Violet Hunter. “The Copper Beeches” is really Violet’s story. Violet isn’t just the client; she’s the detective. She’s really using Holmes the way Sherlock uses Lestrade: as back-up in case things go sideways. And as much as Holmes bitches about this case at the beginning of the episode, by the end of it, he’s pretty much embraced that role and is all right with it.
Holmes actually hunts Watson down while he’s in the middle of what appears to be a fishing trip, goes through the performance of asking him if he wants to come, pretends he’ll be OK with it if Watson says he’d rather finish his holiday, and then–once he secures Watson’s consent–reveals that he’s already got their train tickets. Exasperated by this presumption, Watson will be even more exasperated when he discovers that Holmes arranged their accommodations before he even went out to invite him on this jaunt.
is two men sitting on a bench in the open air.
From that moment on, both of our boys have the scent in their nostrils and are on the trail, and it’s beautiful to watch. The way they both sit there greedily staring at Mr. Henry Baker, hoping he’ll turn out to be the most dangerous jewel thief in London, is a master class in reactions all by itself:
stories, you start to see a lot of plots involving characters who are trapped in disastrous marriages that they can’t get out of, who are sometimes given the opportunity to vent about how unjust this is. That’s what happens during Lady Brackenstall’s interview in ACD’s “Abbey Grange,” where her story about her marriage is quite simple: my husband was a monster, my marriage was a nightmare, someday God will change the laws of England so people can exit their marriages at will and then
And boy is he pleased about it:
as if he were a real person–had made up some fanon about Violet Hunter which, even at the time, annoyed me, and which I cannot look back upon now without being filled with rage. Isaac S. George, in 1949, wrote a piece for the BSJ titled “Violet the Hunter” in which he argued that the case itself was essentially a put-up job and that Violet’s real goal throughout is to seduce Holmes. As evidence, he cited Violet’s occasional references to her own remarkable qualities (her “artistic” hair, her “naturally observant” personality), which she obviously could ONLY be pointing out in a brazen attempt to attract him, the winsomely beseeching tone of her telegram (”Do come!”), the fact that she smiles at him, and the fact that Holmes’s actual participation in this case is unusually peripheral. This theory became so popular in the boys’ club that used to be the official fandom that she became widely known as Violet the Hunter. In other words, as with Irene Adler, the boys could only explain the presence of a compelling and independent female character within an ACD story by turning her into a love interest. But this move is extra cruel in Violet’s case, because so much of the satisfaction the “Violet the Hunter” crowd derives from this fanon comes from the one-sidedness of VIolet’s crush and the implied humiliation of her failure as seductress. Irene Adler at least lives on in Holmes’s memory. Poor Violet fades immediately: according to Watson, Holmes “manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems.”

, if you will—for Holmes and Watson. It starts early in the morning, as Watson heads off to do some Christmas shopping, and ends at midnight as the bells ring in Christmas day. Everything about their part of this episode is a source of delight, from the moment Mrs. Hudson busts in to roust an extremely startled and displeased Holmes out of bed to the moment they sit down to their very late supper. Holmes starts the day in glorious disarray. He’s apparently slept in his dressing-gown or lab coat or whatever that is; literally the first thing he does after telling Mrs. Hudson to “go away” is to reach for a cigarette; and he is in the act of sneaking out to the sitting room to look for matches when Peterson surprises him and forces poor Holmes to have a client consultation with terrible (yet inviting) bedhead and in what are basically his pajamas. Holmes doing his best to be polite to Peterson while he rambles on about his goose and hat adventure, while once or twice nearly falling asleep, is just a treat to watch; but it’s just the beginning. Holmes is sort of coming into focus and starting to take an interest in the situation as he shoos Peterson and the goose out—he keeps sniffing his fingers, I suppose because of the lime cream from the hat lining. He nevertheless goes back to bed; but then he pops out to take a look at the hat and…I’ll just do the gif:
We see here a callback to the chalkboard in “Dancing Men,” the episode which, in the Granada arc,
series from the 1980s, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and David Burke/Edward Hardwicke as Watson, and
This is the very last episode aired of Jeremy Brett’s Sherlock Holmes. In a lot of ways, it was better than I was expecting. In general, I’ll be honest, ever since The Last Vampyre this rewatch has been kind of a masochistic exercise. “The Cardboard Box” is definitely not one of Granada’s better episodes. But as show finales go…well, I’m anX-Files fan, so for me the bar is not high. There are worse notes on which this show could have gone out. And after the vast disappointments of “Mazarin Stone,” it’s nice to have Brett back–even not at full capacity–so that you can say a proper goodbye.
, with its twenty-first century setting, you can dispense with all that–or with something like the Robert J. Downey films, where the setting is nominally Victorian but the production is so clearly post-
Hawkesworth cuts all of this except for the first three words; and as much as I love this passage in context, I think he was right to do it. Coming where it does in the order, Holmes’s decision in “Boscombe Valley” forces him to re-evaluate what’s now a longstanding practice of making his own decisions about what to do with the criminals he identifies. The adaptation, which replaces Lestrade with a local inspector–Colin Jeavons was obviously just not on board for the
So, when I started this I did promise these writeups would be enjoyable even for peopel who don’t watch
If you think about it from the point of view of the investigation, though, what happens is that Holmes blows his own cover after being on the job for all of five minutes. He’s evidently too involved in getting the dirt from the bartender to pay attention to his surroundings, and doesn’t realize one of the subjects he’s investigating is actually in the pub with him, listening to him ask questions about him. Holmes can’t go back to that pub now, and he’s never going to get any more information about the situation or the people involved than he already has. The only new piece of information he’s discovered is that Woodley is staying with Williamson at Charlington Hall on the weekends. He still doesn’t know who the cyclist is–or at least he doesn’t know any more than he did before he went down there–and he’s not in a position where he can take action to protect Violet. In other words, as much as he enjoyed pasting Woodley, as a detective, Holmes has also done remarkably badly.
For all the hoo-ha about how terrifying Mycroft’s massive intellect is, however, as written, “The Greek Interpreter” doesn’t give Mycroft much time to shine. Apart from the deductions game he plays with Sherlock at the window in the Diogenes Club, Mycroft solves the case not with brainpower but by doing something simple, effective, and also entirely thoughtless: he puts an ad in all the papers asking for information about Paul and Sophia Kratides. This does solve the mystery–they find the house only because someone’s answered the ad–but of course it puts their client, Mr. Melas, in mortal danger. Holmes’s impatience throughout with Mycroft’s failure to consider the human consequences of his actions is clearly telegraphed by Brett’s reactions. This is really an action/suspense plot, where the real question is not how to solve a puzzle but whether they’ll be able to save Mr. Melas and Paul Kratides in time. Marlowe does a good job of turning a reference to the difficulty of getting a warrant into a tense little scene with Gregson at the police station, and the translation scenes in Kemp and Latimer’s house are freaky for real. The actor playing Kemp appears to have a side job as a Peter Lorre impersonator; but derivative as it is, his performance also extremely unnerving and creepy. He really gets the laughing-while-saying-hideous-things part exactly right. The way Kemp and Latimer treat all three of the Greek people in this episode reminds me of the brutality of my own government regarding immigrants and “foreigners” of all types, which gives those scenes an extra dystopian shudder.
"To Sir George Burnville, undoubtedly," he replied, sadly. "He is one of those to whom a jewel is simply a highly concentrated form of currency."
So…all in all, you know, there’s some cute Holmes/Watson stuff in this one and a decent heroine and some work for Rosalie Williams and it’s not all bad…but Neville St. Clair’s “people don’t expect beggars to quote Shakespeare” shtick REALLY annoys me, the gratuitous Orientalism annoys me even more and…I mean that’s a SPONGE, man, am I seriously supposed to be scared of that?
"What subject could require richer color, or more vibrant life, than the adventures of a unique and priceless jewel?"
“The first of, of course, is ‘never start a land war in Asia.’”
"Whereas, to me..." He took up the hand I had just rested on my knee, interlacing his fingers with mine. "Three gems or thirty-six or thirty-nine, what does it signify? The beauty, the history, the romance of each jewel is unique. It cannot simply be...multiplied."
Let us remember that this drug forces people to confront things so terrifying that they will literally be driven insane if they contemplate them for too long.
, whose production style usually appears to be trying to replicate Sherlock’s own manic hyperawareness and satisfy his craving for constant stimulation.
This story was adapted by Derek Marlowe, who appears to have been under the impression that his name should have been Philip Marlowe. The first half is quite entertaining, even endearing, in classic Granada Holmes style. Then, Marlowe runs out of story, and fills out the rest of the hour with a hardboiled detective AU involving a chase on a train, guns, extrajudicial murder, and a femme fatale. “You still retain your low opinion of women,” says Mycroft to Sherlock, after the case wraps up. No, Mycroft; no, he doesn’t. I hate to be the one to break it to you…but that man you’re talking to isn’t really your brother.
All right, first of all, let me just tell you: this episode is, as I believe the kids today say, LIT as FUCK:
“…flag denotes the end of the words.” And he leaves Watson to figure it out.
“Ha!”
So, first of all, the whole opening of the story has to be redone because the canon story opens with Watson having breakfast with Mary and getting a telegram from Holmes. Now, it is sad to lose this, because…I mean look at this telegram:
It must have been a huge relief to him. That, and the fact that since Holmes is faking it, it wasn’t going to matter if he got it right. The more exaggerated and over the top things got, the better it would be.
What I love about this is how quickly both of these actors establish the depth of the relationship. Watson’s reaction to the sight of the syringe is so intense and so immediate that you know this has been source of conflict for them for a long time. Holmes reacts in what he knows will be a maddeningly understated way. As the conversation develops, we realize that there are other layers to this. Watson is angry partly because he’s coming home from a long trip and instead of getting to just settle in and enjoy being warm and dry and cozy, they have to have THIS argument again. The running gag started in this episode about Watson’s appetite–he’s always hungry, and Holmes never is, and it seems like at all times Watson is devoting significant bandwidth to ensuring his own access to food–stands in for a more poignant disappointment: coming home to Holmes is never as comforting as Watson wants it to be. There are always the “moods” to deal with–moods which, it appears, are partly Holmes’s way of getting back at Watson for leaving him in the first place. Holmes even implies, at the end of this confrontation, that he left the syringe visible on purpose: “You my close that drawer. You have made the wrong diagnosis, Doctor! This is my stimulant.” And he hands him the King of Bohemia’s letter.
