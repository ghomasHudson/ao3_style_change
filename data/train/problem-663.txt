"This all seems highly inconvenient," Watson said with a sad laugh. "I cannot understand how other vampires could send away their thralls. Have they no soul left?"
home," he retorted, "but I do not relish the idea of hearing your voice every day. Baker Street must suffice."
"It would take an incredible amount of effort," Watson clarified. "They would have to dominate your mind first, which would be difficult, and then feed you enough of their own blood to counteract mine. For a vampire it is hardly worth the trouble, as humans are plentiful."
After a long moment which Holmes spent contemplating the merits of housebreaking the door finally opened, the doctor standing on the other side looking pale and dark-eyed, white skin almost translucent in the moonlight.
"You have not yet confessed to a heavenly witness,” Deighton reminded him. “Were you to die now, you would go to hell.”
He nodded again, "And he did not attempt to harm you?" Watson would not have, point in fact but Holmes had to keep up appearances.
“Christ,” he muttered as the vampire gnashed and screamed in hunger, tearing at its bonds until the bed frame creaked. Best to put the wretched thing out of its misery... but the only wood in the room was a cross nailed to the wall. Watson ripped it free and stalked over to the pathetic figure, staring down into its frenzied, desperate eyes.
He picked up a cold, stiff hand, indicating with his finger as he spoke. "Note if you will the callus built up on the inside webbing of his left hand just here, between finger and thumb. He has calluses nowhere else on his hands; he is not a man used to hard labor. He is however a man who spends a great deal of time sliding a cue stick between his fingers. That and the white chalk on his sleeve says he was in the local gaming hall no more than an hour or two before dying. No time to eat, but time to shoot billiards. Clearly he had priorities."
He would have been happy to lay there indefinitely, but all to soon the dawn threatened and Watson, whom Holmes had established
"Of course," Watson said. "And you think he will reveal things to you as yourself, instead of the homeless man you impersonated?"
"I rarely sleep while on a case," Holmes said dismissively. "In any event, there is the business of the garret window. There are shutters of course but I mean to board it as well. There is some lumber in the coal shed..." And then, his mind desperate for something to occupy it, he became distracted by an experiment that had been percolating on the table for the last week and a half; engrossed enough he did not hear Watson either leave or return again.
“We?” Watson repeated with a quick blink. “You think he knows I have allied myself with the Diogenes?”
Holmes flicked the comment away with a twitch of his eyebrows. "A ridiculous assertion; I have you. In any case, it has never stopped me before."
Watson rubbed at the smooth skin of his brow in contemplation. "Not easily, though it depends a great deal on the strength of the master; a weak vampire makes for weak thralls. But even for the very young among us, thralling a mortal confers to them certain benefits; chief among them is an ability to withstand mental domination or attack. It is difficult to read their minds, and nearly impossible to give one an Order unless there is a very great disparity of strength between the two vampires."
"I will sleep elsewhere,” Watson assured him, "but I insist on being here at night. If the sire means to take London he will not come alone; his clan will likely be with him. You will be the most vulnerable at night."
"No, I think we've enough to take it from here," he said almost gently, and the courtesy chaffed against his skin like sandpaper. He hated being so pitiable a figure; especially in front of someone like Lestrade.
The clergyman blinked dully. "That name sounds familiar,” he said after a stretch of silence, “have you visited before?"
likely but she didn't believe her own words. I don't know why she would lie, nor what has frightened her so but there is a reason her husband has her under such close scrutiny. We weren't alone five minutes before he came in search of her. I slipped away before he could spot me. I thought it for the best." He waited, hoping Holmes found his information useful, though he wasn't entirely sure why he felt the need to prove himself to a mortal, except that somehow Holmes had the power to make him feel like an ignorant child, and not a powerful, supernatural being of folklore. Watson didn't like that at all but it seemed there was nothing to be done about it.
distressed, but eventually lessened the bone-white grasp on her arm and allowed her to go with Holmes.
Holmes exhaled grey smoke, watched as it dissipated into the air. "Logic, brother. After evading all notice for fifty years, you think he would
Watson blinked and pulled back at the reaction, fire giving way to a wary sort of confusion. "I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it was relevant."
“You seem to have it all thought out.” Holmes' lips were quirked in a shadow of amusement, and Watson had the distinct impression the detective was laughing at him.
So many years ago now, the images called forth were muzzy and sepia-tinged with age. It had not been a park then, but sprawling farmland dotted here and there with copses - crown holdings belonging to King George. There were no green lawns, no broad avenues lined with manicured flower beds or sculpted fountains, no willow trees with their branches like fingers trailing in the water.
He drank more. His mind was no longer his own, not really, Watson’s thoughts and desires now superimposed over his, not erasing them but melding the two together, fusing until he was uncertain where his own will ended and Watson’s began. He didn’t much mind. Watson would steer him right, and he found himself wanting to please the doctor, to listen to him and be guided by him in all things. He knew such thoughts were contrary to his own personality and understood them to be borne of the blood ritual he was partaking in, but he did not care.
"Oh indeed yes,” Watson confirmed with a nod, “there are many things I understand more quickly and with more clarity than I did before. I think, had I been a mortal man experiencing the revolution of technology we have gone through this century, I might have been quite staunchly against it. Trains, steam power, electricity - such wonders! And such horrors, as well."
"He was moved there after his death, of course." Holmes looked the body over, searching. There wasn’t a gun to be found but he wore an ammunition belt at his waist. Holmes opened one of the pouches and emptied it, rolling the small, shiny bullets about in his palm.
want you to have them, that’s the trouble,” he answered unhappily, and Holmes quieted him with a kiss. Then he curled into the doctor’s cold embrace and did something quite remarkable.
"There," Holmes pointed at Montressor's house while handing the cabbie another silver piece. "His name is James Montressor; he arrived home less than ten minutes ago and depending on how well his faculties are working he may even now be packing to flee."
Sunlight had only just cracked the edge of the slate colored horizon when Holmes slipped into an uneasy slumber, crumpled like discarded laundry at the edge of the settee. But rest was as fleeting as every other good thing in the world and barely an hour passed before he was roused by another flurry of pounding on the door.
“And nearly as long since Newman came to the parish,” Watson added, and Holmes gave him an approving look.
To his credit, Mycroft listened, his massive body squeezed into one of the oversized chairs, and his face pulled into a craggy frown.
“He was wary of them,” Holmes replied honestly, “but if he had either knowledge or suspicions as to what was going on, he did not share them with me. But it is certainly true that the vicar campaigned very hard for me to believe the doctor himself was behind the disappearances around the church.”
"My brother can make his own choice at that time," he agreed. "And if he chooses to stay, you will leave him alone."
"Exactly." Holmes said, spreading his open hands. "You are in no danger of being addled; the doctor's parlor tricks have no power over you."
There was a commotion within, frantic voices and the front door ripped open, Lucy Montressor standing in the doorway looking pale and frightened.
“The Irregulars have called them already," Holmes reassured him, "they will be here within the next five minutes.”
"Take more care around these men than you usually would," Watson cautioned, belaboring the point, "you have no one to watch your back now."
“Perhaps I want you to myself for as long as possible,” Watson replied, shooting him a veiled look and gesturing to the world beyond the window casement. “Besides, a cab can’t show you London the way I can.” He had learned long ago that the fastest way around the city was via the rooftops. Fewer people, and easier to traverse the city in a straight line, rather than follow the labyrinthine snarl of London's streets.
Despite himself Watson laughed, and bowed slightly towards Holmes, a conciliatory tone to the movement.
The man moaned again, but Holmes had no comfort to offer. He dare not reveal that help would (eventually) come.
"You've still got plenty of time to leave without being noticed, and you desperately needed rest," Watson replied, looking over at him and seeing only the rumpled lines of his back. "Here is your jacket," he added, standing up and bringing it over. "You should... probably also button up your shirt before you go."
"May I ask you again to take my case?" He entreated, and this time there was no imperiousness, no cagey smirk, no cards hidden up his sleeve, waiting to be played. He was simply a man asking for help - asking for
Somewhere in the cursed house, something screamed. A great, shrieking howl that brought to mind visions of hell and dancing demons, of eternal fire and tormented souls wailing in lament. It was horrific, and he almost dismissed it as a hallucination dredged up by his fever-soaked mind but no- both the vicar and Newman whipped their heads around.
“I’m Diogenes. I would not be here if the thought of vampires terrified me. But while we are taught all vampires are murderous, I believe that is because we only follow the bodies. If one could feed without killing, as you seem to  have done, that would make them nearly invisible to our agents. I have long believed we had not met with any ‘good’ vampires simply because we have no way of detecting them.” His smile grew wider, “I finally have proof such theory is more than wishful thinking.”
"Well, if you hold his death against me then find comfort in knowing my days since have been their own hell, and will continue to be so until I am doubtlessly murdered by someone seeking a less righteous brand of vengeance than yourself."
Watson kissed him back in passionate agreement. "The hours expand when you need them to shrink," he muttered between kisses, threading his fingers through Holmes' hair.
But Mycroft would not be routed so easily; he was long used to Holmes' particular brand of artifice. "And what of the rest of you? Your mind is your worst enemy."
This was not as hard as it might be for some. Holmes in fact had an incredible amount of focus; it was necessary, least he be driven insane by every piece of data about the world he could not ignore. The trouble was finding something to focus
It was well into the afternoon by the time Lestrade's man came by with the letters. Sergeant Clark was a solid, dependable sort of man, slightly more competent than the average London peeler (though that was faint praise indeed) and Holmes was inclined to think as well of him as he did any of the Scotland Yard constabulary. Which was to say, marginally. That and the fact Clark seemed less bothered by Holmes' eccentricities than most meant it was nearly always he Lestrade sent to Baker Street on police business, making Clark Holmes' unofficial liaison to the Yard.
"All right now,” he said, trying to decide on the best way to covey within the limits of the English language abstract concepts that had no real explanation, “close your eyes and then- then feel for me with your mind. Think in the direction of my voice and focus your thoughts towards me."
Holmes did look at him then, gaze shrewd and knowing. "And achieve what? Consider the ramifications if he actually succeeded in finding you."
Holmes gave a grunt of agreement, and Newman spent the next quarter hour showing him about, much of that time spent in the shed where Father Deighton kept a small menagerie of a single parrot in its own cage and six clip-winged doves in a coop.
Now observe:  here is a man of decent wardrobe in good health, who's girth indicates a hearty appetite, yet the contents of his stomach suggest he had not eaten a true meal since breakfast. There are no particular religious holidays that require fasting this time of year, and a pastry is not the nibblet of a man skipping meals to lose weight. Ergo, he has been in an urgent rush today, so much so that he has eaten nothing since early morning and bought a penny pastry from a shop to stave off hunger."
Holmes was not looking at him as he replied, "That question is precisely why I need to continue my investigation."
"How do you propose I 'disappear' then?" he asked, intrigued at the implication that he needn't physically leave the city. The kettle continued to heat as they spoke, and Watson prepared the teapot.
“Promise...promise you will never enter my mind without permission. Promise you will not- that you will never use your abilities to shape my reality, nor close my eyes to the truth simply because you think it best for me.”
Presently the sound of a carriage suffused the heavy silence, emerging reaper-black from the gloom and coming to rest on the corner of Marylebone Road. A sole passenger disembarked and with a quiet exchange of payment sent the carriage on its way, clattering wheels muffled by the dense fog. The figure lingered on the corner, striking up a cigarette with one hand cupped around the match to shield it from the damp, staring into the impenetrable darkness with an equally obscured expression. Finally they crushed out the nub of cigarette and turned down the corner of Baker Street, up the cut stone steps of a nondescript building and rapped sharply upon the door.
"I am a man of justice; it is disheartening how often those two concepts diverge." He sighed, "Montressor must answer for his crime. I cannot do that without compromising you, and in so doing putting the lives of innocent - if incompetent - officers at risk. I think I speak rightly when I say you will not go quietly into that good night. If someone threatens you, you will not hesitate to kill them. You might mourn them afterwards and grieve for your actions, but in the heat of the moment you will protect yourself. If the Yard comes to your door and you refuse to meet them in the daylight, there will be questions. Even if you belay their suspicions, it will take root in others.
“I am quite at your disposal,” Holmes replied, which was a rather dangerous thing to say, and Watson quickly reeled in his more indiscreet emotions lest Holmes catch a hint of them, but of course it was Holmes and he was a bastard three times over and so he simply sat there smirking at him and Watson didn’t know if it was his mind or his face that gave him away. He cleared his throat, and began again.
Watson wondered if Mycroft knew as much, and concluded it likely that he did. Perhaps that was the reason for his inexplicable change of heart, why he was suddenly eager to exploit Watson’s abilities for his brother’s benefit...for who else could act as such an anchor now? Holmes would certainly trust no other, even if the Diogenes had other psychics at their disposal. Even if he weren’t under a thrall.
Watson accepted the truth of those words without agreeing to the sentiment behind them. “And Montressor was only trying to protect his wife. It doesn’t make it
"That's quite enough of that!" Montressor thundered, stepping back into the sitting room, red-faced with anger. "The man is a monster. He hypnotized my wife!"
Lestrade nodded, looking thoughtful. "It seems very possible, then, that if Jackson suspected something and Deighton knew, he might have plotted against him.  After all Jackson was a doctor, and much respected at the time. Couldn’t make him disappear with the same ease as a vagrant off the street."
Watson hissed, turning to Holmes like a coiled snake ready to strike, hands clenched into trembling fists at his sides. "Yes, it would be possible. Feeding is...intimate."
Holmes set the paper down. "They only left out a few vital facts and fabricated a few more," Holmes remarked. "All in all, better than one usually expects from the press."
“For one who has spent a century passing as a mortal, I wonder what your objection is to taking a cab.”
Holmes smiled thinly up at the vicar. “I believe you have the advantage,” he said, raising his hands very carefully because his life had been threatened often enough to know whether someone was bluffing or not. Deighton wasn’t, and while he was an older fellow and no match for Holmes physically, when a man had a gun in his hand he only needed enough strength to pull the trigger.
Deighton tapped his fingers against his leg. “Confess your sins, Mister Holmes. I assure you I take no pleasure from this work, none at all, and I would rather it be done quickly. Confess to the Doctor’s whereabouts – that creature who wears a man’s face. Tell us where he is, and begin to unburden your soul from the shadow cast over it.”
Watson leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms, watching the patrons of the bar as they scuttled about their infinitesimal lives. "I used to attend evening Mass, to keep up appearances. One night, over a month ago, Newman pulled me aside after the service for a quiet word."
"What is it?" Watson asked, thinking Holmes must have just had a revelation of some sort, those great flowing rivers of thought connecting together in some obscure way. "What are you thinking?"
"If I didn't think I could learn anything I wouldn't bother. There are half a dozen other places I am needed."
“I distinctly remember asking you to tell me everything you knew of vampires, and you replied that you knew nothing at all. I did not ask the question out of idle curiosity, Doctor.”
"That is madness," Holmes corrected contemptuously. "Where did they find you, Bedlam perhaps? You‘re certainly no priest; you’ve never been indoctrinated.”
“No, though I have been trained to withstand thrall, as have all the Diogenes members. But those gifted with psychic acumen are the most adept at it, and Stamford was one of our best. He was a highly intelligent boy, and a talented psychic. Finding one at all is difficult enough, finding one of his calibre is a rare boon indeed. His loss was a great blow to our efforts.”
“Then you should not take offense when they are pointed out,” Holmes replied with infuriating reason.
Montressor was at a loss as to what to do. “Did you hear me?” he said, trailing after him. “We’re closed. There will be no more business today. I – I must to the train station, before dark. I won’t travel after dark!”
Well, it was all conjecture anyway. Still, it was a working theory that didn't rely on magically animated corpses, so there was that.
Holmes nodded, and immediately enfolded himself in Watson’s arms. Impossible man. "I have learned a good deal more today than I expected to," he replied, wandering hands already tucking themselves under Watson’s waistcoat.
Holmes had to be careful here. Lestrade was not a smart man, but he was tenacious, making the rank of Inspector through his sheer refusal to give up a case, regardless of how outclassed he might be intellectually. He would not easily give up looking for a 'madman' who did not exist.
He blinked, smile frozen to his face for half a second before melting away, pleasure replaced by mild offense. "A parasite?" he repeated, searching the detective’s face for signs of jest but of course there were none; Holmes was a master deceiver.
Holmes ignored the first comment. One did not present themselves as a supernatural being to a man of science, challenge them on the point and expect anything less than a thorough examination. "And your bowls do not empty? Then where does the blood go?"
You are now a predator of predators. Evolution requires that you understand your prey, to the same degree at least that the cat understands the mouse. So, it stands you would not be stripped of your capacity to reason. If anything, it would be enhanced."
Holmes studied his brother unreservedly. “You have doubts.” If Mycroft truly believed all of that, he wouldn't be telling Holmes any of it. Not while the thrall remained.
"I wish you to be safe!" Watson corrected, too much passion in the words but there was nothing to be done about that now.
"I do not think I want it broken," Holmes admitted, "though I cannot say if that is the thrall speaking for me. I hope it is not; I do not want this to be mere illusion."
"I am not a museum specimen," Jackson said with a huff, though he didn’t pull his hand away. “And yes, I must drink blood regularly. I won't die without, not for months- possibly years - but the hunger becomes overwhelming. That can be quite dangerous, and I prefer to keep such urges in check. As for everything else, there is nothing. Just blood. I cannot eat food or drink."
"I cannot say. Mycroft's mind is private even to myself. There could be a distinct element of danger to you, however. If he thought our association would do me more harm than good, he would not hesitate to move against you. Even for one such as yourself, you would not want him as your enemy."
not to notice Watson’s true nature...and just happen to mention absolutely none of this to either Holmes or the Diogenes.
"But you did not read his thoughts?" Holmes asked quickly, and Watson gave a self-depreciating laugh.
“I admit I have no head for strategy,” Watson said, backing down because he was sensible enough to know that fighting amongst themselves would be detrimental to their cause, “but here’s what I don’t understand; if Moriarty is so very old, why is he bothering with such an elaborate ploy? He could best me easily; why not simply invade the city with his clan and take it?”
"Why would he require Langley to frighten Jackson away if the man had already gone?" Holmes asked reasonably, and Newman spread his hands helplessly.
"That never changes," Holmes continued. "The nature of man: conflicted and afraid. Fear is an inherent characteristic in any sentient creature. The deer must be ever wary of the wolf, and the wolf fears the hunter. But conflict; it is our self-awareness which grants us that. The urial fears the lion but it is not conflicted about it. Neither is the lion conflicted about where its dinner comes from. We are capable of such great goodness and great evil precisely
Holmes nodded, reaching up to squeeze Watson's hand. "When the thrall lifts, you may not feel so strongly towards me," he pointed out.
Watson blinked in surprise, denials already forming in his mind. "Do I?" he asked, and the look Holmes gave him made him feel rather stupid.
It was a long way up, but the firemen held the ladder secure at the bottom and Holmes made the journey to the top without incident. The roof on that part of the building was slippery, but he had enough purchase to make his way across to the second ladder. There things got a bit tricky, for the roof itself was slick and steeply sloped. He climbed carefully, reached the last rung of the ladder and there could go no further, the body still beyond his reach. It lay at the very top of the roof, twisted along the ridge and facing away from him. He could see only the faded brown waistcoat of the man's torso.
Watson laughed, the sound reverberating in his chest. "I suppose we have. Our intentions were good, at least." He gently stroked Holmes' hair, holding him close. "How are your injuries?" he asked suddenly. "You may still have some pain, and a limp, but the wound should be closed at least."
"Oh- yes. His practice is very soothing, very professional. I could hardly believe what my husband said he saw."
"That...is a problem," Holmes said, which definitely wasn’t the 'thank you for saving my life' that Watson might have been expecting. But when had Sherlock Holmes ever done the expected?
He ran with it anyway. “There is,” he said with a lecherous grin, “but you keep telling me I must wait until after the thrall has faded.”
"I have many places to be; things which must be done. I must find who among Mr. Kramer's associates had means and motive to kill him. I must find out more about the unfortunate Mr. Langley and his ties to the church. I should also like to speak with your former patient myself - you should provide me with the lady's address, by the way - and of course, the vicar must be interviewed."
He infused the last three words with his Will and watched as the man’s face went slack, the Order gripping hold of his mind.
And on it went again. Holmes could not possibly hope to conceal his thoughts completely, even if he weren’t under thrall; there was too much of him for that. Conventional protection would, Watson realized, be utterly useless.
“Had you been any other vampire, I would not have attempted it,” Holmes answered with infuriatingly pedantic reason. “But you bring up an interesting point: ‘how’ indeed.”
“Is that why you have kept me under surveillance?” he asked. “I ran into one of your lackeys while investigating the death of Michael Kramer.”
Mrs. Montressor looked assuaged, her husband less so, but he had at least stopped arguing and blubbering, so Holmes moved the conversation swiftly forward. "Now, there is one more thing I would ask of you."
“No indeed. Most likely he discovered you after he had left their employment, and was thus under no obligation to do so. He probably wondered how you had managed to escape detection, and upon discovering you did not kill, decided to return the favor.”
Watson couldn’t deny him, fingers already tightening in Holmes’ hair and he arched the man's neck even farther as he leaned down, licking the length of his carotid and feeling it pulse hot beneath his tongue. Holmes was perfect, the most perfect human he'd ever met, his scent intoxicating. Watson was hypnotized, love-sick and lost.
you did not have so thorough a dominion over my mind as we had both presumed.  What better way to test the theory then by direct and irrefutable disobedience?”
"He keeps evening hours, of course he has electricity. But that is not why I ask. Does he play music, something soothing?"
Of far more interest to him was the fact that he had detected no pulse, no proof that any life flowed through the doctor’s cold limbs.
“He had been injured in a brawl, and needed the services of an after-hours doctor. He admired my discretion as well as my rates, and returned to my practice whenever he required a physician. He did eventually confess to being your confidant, and the cases you worked together the reason for his not infrequent patronage.”
"Beyond mad," Lestrade agreed, his shoulders sagging beneath the weight of his office. "I've seen madness - or I thought I had, until now. This is something truly monstrous." He sighed, "Well. At least London still has its detective."
Holmes shot his brother a tilted look. “You are taking a rather keen interest in my client’s affairs." Mycroft taking an interest in Watson would be problematic to say the least. Holmes could manage the public, the church and even the Yard with nominal effort. Mycroft was a different matter.
“Come brother. You may be head of the Diogenes, but it is not a monarchy, and I cannot believe your fellow slayers were in any way eager to have a thrall staying in their inner sanctum.”
‘Ah - yes. I see, that was – interesting – and perhaps it would be as well to remember next time that it appears to produce quite a flame. Here, hold this wet handkerchief to your burnt hand, my dear fellow, that is right -  and so this greenish vapour would be the chlorine you have obtained? I understand the halogens to be bad for the lungs, and indeed, it catches strongly at the back of the throat, do you not find: let us open the window, my dear, before we are asphyxiated entirely. By the way, is that the barrel of my silver pen you have used? I am glad it was of use to you, but I do not think it will sit well upon my pen any longer, alas.’
. Near midnight, with nearly all having left the Chamber, Labouchère rose to suggest this amendment. It was barely debated; passed on a nod. I cannot even now determine whether Labouchère has a genuine hatred for inverts, or whether this is part of his customary love for obstruction, but in truth it matters little. Any man who harbours tender feelings for another – and displays those feelings for him in public or in private – is guilty of a misdemeanour.’
‘Then keep me with you.’ He sighed. ‘I must go, Holmes: I have to be at the hospital today. When do we expect our baronet?’
The interview was at an end, but I had gained my point, and we both knew it. He turned once more to affairs of state, the Naval Treaty tucked securely away in a safe, and I walked home, contemplating his words.
‘It was not.’ He turned away. ‘I think – I hope – nay, I do believe – that I am about to be – singularly fortunate.’
‘Myself, I do not know that he has sinned sufficiently to be blackmailed.’ I told him. ‘Shinwell Johnson says that the girls call him ‘Mr Glad-eyes’ and ‘Daddy Do-Nothing.’ But he may have been tempted enough to have a very guilty conscience for all of that.’
‘I am not, ah, not a man of sentiment.’ I lied, for I was, I was awash with feeling where he was concerned. ‘I – I was not brought up to be.’ And that was the truth – ignored, neglected, the unwanted second son (for my parents had wished for a daughter to complete their pigeon pair) oh yes, that was the truth. ‘But Watson, you must not think me – ah – averse to all innocent pleasures.’ No, nor the chance of some less innocent, I added to myself. ‘I shall enjoy this Christmas much more because I am sharing it with you in our own home, and so let us by all means make merry, since it is your first Christmas here for some time.’
'And once this morning: I was in need of stimulus. Well, if you will not, you will not, but at least answer my question. If this love makes me a criminal, why should I hesitate to become one in truth? Why should those supposedly evil propensities within my soul that lead me into desiring to commit the sin of Sodom not be given full rein? For if I am a criminal in that one respect, surely I am damned in all?'
‘I do not take cocaine in solution any more, Watson: it is not as quick-acting. I prefer to inject, as you know, but it is only a seven per cent solution, and I have only taken it twice today. I found myself flagging a little, and needed the stimulus it provided.’
We had separated the pages of our daily paper, as was our wont, and were reading quietly together after breakfast. Our Sussex sojourn lay a week behind us, and I for one, although sorry to lose our cherished solitude, was eager to take up the reins of work again. My melancholia had dissipated – how could it not? – under Watson’s care, and my health was better than it had been for some time. I poured more coffee into my friend’s cup, and tapped gently at the sheet he held before his face.
‘He is well, I thank you,’ I had replied, moving towards the door. ‘His health has improved, but is still delicate, although he has not had a relapse of the fever for a while. I ensure he does not overdo, of course.’
‘I had soup, I seem to recall,’ I protested, as he covered me again with the blankets. ‘I am too warm now, Watson, you need not swaddle me like a babe.’
We will meet Burns-Gibson, Bradlaugh, and the Besants again in Part 7. Holmes and Watson are slightly different social classes: Holmes' father was a squire, patriarchal (not in today's pejorative sense) and caring deeply for those who looked to him. Watson's father was a self-made ironmaster: urban-minded, not rural. Holmes is a dyed-in-the-wool Tory, Watson a left-leaning liberal.
He smiled, and then grimaced. 'That is all thanks to you, Holmes, and I am grateful. Oh, oh, I know what I want for this leg, and I know what I may not have, too. I shall be laid up all the rest of the day and tomorrow if I can get no relief from the pain.'
‘Two hundred and fifty-six grains of morphine sulphate, eight grains of salicylic acid in sixteen fluid ounces of distilled water,’ he recited, as if by rote. ‘I daresay you have the very book that I do, Holmes – Kane, of New York, upon the hypodermic injection of morphia? Published but two years ago?’ and on my silent assent, ‘I expected no less of you: you are a scientist. I am glad at least you do not use the muriate or acetate of morphia, they are more –dear God in heaven, what am I saying? Glad! Of course I am not glad. It is only that the sulphate is more stable – less acidic and damaging. Oh, I cannot think– Holmes, my dear Holmes, if you have read Kane’s book . . . you must know . . .’
Once arrived at the house, it was with a pure and savage joy that I understood the meaning of what Lestrade had observed – that the rug on which Lucas had bled had been moved, and must have been moved to get at something beneath. It was with rage and desperation that I saw, while Lestrade interrogated his police officer, that whatever had been in the hidden compartment under the rug was no longer there. It was with a dismay I could barely conceal under an affectation of indifference that I saw him return to the room with his officer and heard the man’s shamed confession that he had allowed a visitor to enter the room. But it was with very different feelings that I heard his story, recognising at once who his visitor - the beautiful, quietly-dressed young woman who had coaxed him for ‘just a peep at the room where the murder had happened’; and then fainted, so that he had run to fetch brandy to revive her from the nearest tavern – must have been. Who that woman had to be.
And the pride of them, as they bestride the world. Yet they are no Colossi -  they would sooner reign in hell than serve in heaven. Is it the Babbacombe decision next?
‘I will. Could we walk tomorrow, John? Arm in arm, as we were wont to do. It feels – as if we have not for a while.’
‘A snake! Poor Labouchère! Holmes, I have never known you to be so melodramatic. But I will not press you again to meet him, if you do not wish to: it is true that you have put me off several times, but I had no idea you disliked him so intensely.’
'Haslip agrees with you that she cannot live: the peritoneum is pierced, and mortification has already begun. I have stationed officers there to take her further deposition should she be able to give one.' Lestrade seated himself at the table. 'Ah, breakfast! Excellent!'
He had walked to the door, hat in hand, as I turned from him but he looked back, then, with an expression so serious, so uncheerful, that it pierced me to the core. Again I wavered, opened my lips to speak - but he was gone. The door closed gently behind him, and I heard his slow step down the stairs. He halted, halfway, and I sprang to the door, in the hope that he might return: I swear in that moment, had he come back to me, I would have given it up, no matter what it cost me, so as never to see him look thus beaten down again - but then he resumed his downward path, and I, fool that I was, was too proud to follow.
'Alone, as before? It went against the grain not to hurry there, but of course I did not: I am not a fool. Not after the last time. I took the address, sent the messenger away, immediately went back into the hospital, and secured the assistance of one of my dressers. Accompanied by him as my witness, I went and knocked up Moore Agar - I wanted a trusted colleague with me, an independent medical man, and Agar owes me a favour or two - and besought him to accompany me to the place the messenger had given. We arrived to find that another doctor had already been called to the body: life was extinct.' He gave a strangled laugh that was almost a sob. 'There were thirty-nine stab wounds: of course life was extinct. Even had I gone post haste there it would have been to no avail. And it was Martha Tabram: I recognised her from the clinic, having seen her only a day or two before.'
I often wondered what he thought of those walks. We were always arm in arm now. I needed it, hungered for it: the only touch we had. He would stand, waiting for me, his elbow crooked. When I approached, and tucked my hand into his arm, he would press me gently against his side, almost embracing my hand as he sheltered it. Though wool and linen separated my flesh from his, I sensed his skin as if my hand could penetrate his shield of clothing and reach home to him. I was in an agony of desire then, my whole being focused on the point of contact between us. Sometimes, expounding a point of deduction, I would allow myself to grip his arm hard, as if wrought up by my intellectual exercise, and unconscious of my act. He would remonstrate, laughing at me – ‘Holmes, old chap, do calm down. I am not a criminal, you need not maul me so, I shall not hurt you.’ Sometimes he would pat my hand, soothing me. ‘Holmes, come now, you’re gripping me hard enough to bruise. Your nervous system is too finely tuned, my dear fellow, you’ll have me prescribing you valerian, as I do for my patients. It’s no wonder you’re so thin: that great brain of yours wears out your body.’
He received it into his hand, then slowly, methodically, tore the paper across and across, and tore again, again, until he held a heap of small and unreadable scraps. He opened his fingers, and a light wind drifted the pieces away, some powdering the damp ground around us, then darkening under the fine misty drizzle that had begun to sift down. Others were wafted to the surface of the river, where they floated for a few minutes before their sodden weight dragged them under. A fish rose lazily, sucked a piece down into a small swirl into the water, expelled it in a bubble, then dived, concentric circles rippling from where it had breached. It had found the words no more palatable than we had, and for now there seemed a strange justice in such an ignominious end for someone’s hate.
I turned, and there was Watson, his face pale, and sterner than usual. He waved imperiously at a porter, removed my valise from my unresisting hand, delivered it over to the man, and directed it to be carried to the Great Eastern. Without more ado, he drew my left arm over his shoulder, and supported me around the waist with his right. He was warm, and solid - so hopelessly dear and familiar and safe - and I leaned into him with a sigh of relief that I could by no means repress.
! Was that how it went? Faithful to my vow: I will cherish you, my brother, my friend, my more than all!’
'As you know, for some years, now, I have been working with Mrs Josephine Butler, first of all to see the Criminal Law Amendment bill through - with what result you know: we obtained relief and recourse to law for those children dragged early into prostitution, but - ' he swallowed hard, ' - well, you know, Holmes.'
It took some time for me to persuade the Prime Minister and Hope to confide fully in me with details of the case, but I would not continue without knowing. Their attempt to tell me merely what the letter looked like, was as ludicrous, forsooth, as their suggestion that I might move in the matter without Watson. That they could not, at that moment see that I would need to know who might be the buyer for such a letter – and buyers I knew well that there would be – I ascribed to their extreme distress at the time. I understood the horrors of war no less well than they –  if it became known that we chose to support Prince Alexander against Russia, then Austria-Hungary and Turkey would take it as an indication that we might allow them to make a move against their long-time enemy.
‘One cannot be too generous with the dearest fellow in the world.’ He tightened his clasp around me, then removed his arm – I felt cold immediately - and stood up. ‘I must bathe and change my clothes if we are to read; I like to be comfortable, and today has been one of those days when I feel to have been steeped in the filth of other people. I should not even be near you in this state, let alone embrace you. We dine in today, do we not?’
We were interrupted that moment by the cab driver who had taken the man who had followed Baskerville. I have never been more surprised in my life when he told me that his mysterious fare had been none other than Sherlock Holmes. Watson burst into a hearty fit of laughter which much amazed the poor fellow.
I telegraphed Scotland Yard about the case – which is not, of course how Watson wrote it up - but otherwise would not stir, determined not to leave until my friend returned. For he was my friend, both in the sense that the pronoun implied, and in the singularity of the noun. My friend. There was no other. When he arrived home after luncheon – which I had refused – his coat was wet with the drizzle, and his face more serious than I had ever seen it. I pounced on him – positively pounced, I am sorry to say – insisting that he remove his wet coat, and set it to dry, that he come to the fire and warm himself, and that he instantly remove his shoes and put on slippers, crying that he was not to stir until Mrs Hudson had brought him a hot grog. He suffered my ministrations with an abstracted air, but becoming, at length, aware that I was observing him closely, he rewarded my care with a weary smile.
‘Watson, I was bred in the country. I have been handling arms since I was breeched. Why do you doubt me?’
‘Then we shall not discuss it at all. I am sorry I have been presumptuous as well over inviting Lestrade, Holmes, Would you like me to make some excuse for you, to say that you are not well? And then I have to go to Barts anyway, and to the Alexandra Hospital, so you may have some peace and quiet.’
‘Come to me.’ I stretched out my hand. ‘Come, John. I cannot embrace you in full sight of the street. Shall we take Dr Mortimer’s case? It would get us out of London, perhaps, and that is no bad thing. I weary of these wretched murders, and, I confess, I am anxious that there should no more suspicion light upon you. And for all that I have done my damnedest to acquire the government’s good will by every means in my power, I am weary, too, of acting the diplomat for my brother. Of course, there is this latest blackmail case . . .’
‘Nor I without you.’ He picked up his bags, but lingered in the doorway. ‘I had almost thought it better to be away for a while – you were so strange with me, and I could not see why: I could not account for your shrinking when we had been so close – but now I know, and all our misunderstanding is cleared away, I am easier in my mind also.’ He turned away, then back to me. ‘Except for leaving you of course. Holmes, you are not to get into trouble while I am away. Do not do anything that carries a risk, my dear, while I am not here. And let me hear of you often. I shall send you bulletins, and do you do the same for me. I trust it will not be too long before I am home.’
‘If the temptation is strong upon you, perhaps we should remove you from its grasp, rather than remove it from you. We could run down to the country for a couple of weeks,’ he suggested, when I broached the issue. ‘You are looking jaded, I can see that, and to say truth, I am in need of some time out of London myself. That last case of mine at the hospital . . . the burned child . . .’ and he shivered, despite the warmth. ‘A clearer atmosphere, perhaps, some good hard walking to exhaust you in a healthier way, a little botanising or geology – they might do you good. The heat here is enervating, and the air unclean.’
‘Hush.’ I placed my finger on his lips. ‘We lie in one bed just to sleep, my John, my dear friend. There can be no harm when it is only to sleep. We are just comrades who share a bed.’
By this point in the story, said Jack, he had entertained some suspicion – there were not so many kindly doctors in London who could be called upon by any street urchin after all, and it was, he well knew, Watson’s medical beat, as it were. He assented, he said, to Grant’s suggestion, to see whether those suspicions were correct. (And if he smoothed over this story after the fact, I did not blame him; a man may be driven to many things for want of money, and in the pinch he had proved himself loyal.) Once there, and confirming that it was his own Doctor Watson, unconscious and stripped to his smalls on the filthy bed, he had terrified Grant and Coulton by telling them how they would be hunted down by Mr Sherlock Holmes and Scotland Yard with whom this same kindly doctor worked. No pitch would stick to Watson, he had said, for he was above suspicion, and exceedingly well in with the authorities, but they would themselves be defiled: Coulton, Jack told them, would certainly end up before the magistrate again, and his punishment be more severe: Grant, as a first offender – that the magistrates knew of – might be let off more lightly, but his anonymity would be gone, and the police would have him in their sights. So they had chosen the wrong pigeon for the plucking, and must let him fly.
The room was close and stifling, the windows tight shut, and the shabby curtains drawn across. In the gloom, Watson lay in a double bed, asleep. His face was deadly pale, dark bruises under each eye, his breathing stertorous. He had been given laudanum for his pain; the bottle, glass and spoon lay on the nightstand. A handkerchief the double of the one folded into my pocket bound his brow, and a rusty stain had seeped through it, dark in the middle, paler at the edges. His naked left arm lay straight at his side, his wrist strapped with another handkerchief. As I watched, he stirred in his drugged sleep, flexed the arm and moaned. I drew back the covers a little and shifted it gently into a more comfortable attitude, watching the lines of pain ease from his brow. He had been stripped to the waist, but in that close heat his torso gleamed with sweat and his face was flushed.
‘The greatest therapeutic dose is one and a half to two grains.’ he said, passing a hand over his eyes. ‘In case we find a marked idiosyncratic response, we are advised to start with one sixteenth, or even one thirty-secondth, of a grain in those new to the drug. Or so I do, anyway. Let be on whatever dose you take: we will discuss it later. How often?’
Watson marvelled with me at the silvery black stain on the porcelain before reminding me gently that Mrs Hudson would not thank us for abusing her coffee saucer with arsenic, and, upon my nod, taking it away to clean. ‘For it is still arsenic, Holmes, even if in an oxidative state, and we must not poison our good housekeeper, or ourselves. Nor must we damage her property, for indulgent as she is, I do not think she will thank you for spoiling the set.’ He stood by the fire, into which he had thrown the arsenic-tainted rag, looking at the saucer as he turned it to and fro in his hands. He had small hands for a man, blunt-fingered, dexterous doctor’s hands that would be strong to heal, and kind to soothe. His smile was wry. ‘I do believe my nanny whipped me for breaking just such a saucer as this. It’s strange, the things one remembers about childhood. But Mrs Hudson is far kinder to us waifs and strays than we deserve.’
‘Why, I have been so busy with Lestrade’s cases – first there was the European business, and then Rainham, and the death of Mrs Stewart at Lauder – which I am certain Moran was behind, although I cannot tease out the clue to connect him to it, try as I might – in short, I have had very little time to pay attention to Gregson.’
"Why did you seek out services for bloodletting in the first place?" This was safe territory; a logical question to ask, so he did not worry about her husband overhearing.
He looked at Mycroft for a long moment. "It will be his decision; I fully plan on telling him how little I trust your word in this. If he does come, consider what that says of him. Consider too that Stamford - one of your own - was his friend. All he has done, from taking my council to saving my life was done before the thrall."
“The true nature of our relationship would have landed us both in gaol, doctor. You can hardly blame him for keeping it hidden.”
Watson sighed sadly. "I did so enjoy London...I was born here, did you know? It was- it was very different then. Smaller. Less sanitary too, if you can believe it. I wandered for so many years after I was turned...but my heart always desired to return-"
"I didn't," Watson insisted, and he could not flush with embarrassment but his body language belied the emotion, arms crossed against his chest like a shield, his gaze turned away.  "I thought whoever tried to come here, I could handle on my own. I have until now..."
are at risk as well, your name is in the papers in connection to the case! Blast me, I can find a place to sleep for the day, I'll move every morning if I have to. But you! You can't even stand!"
"It could have been." Mycroft narrowed his eyes. "You were lucky, and I know neither of us believes in luck."
"Surface thoughts are easy," Watson said with a wave of his hand. "You're curious but skeptical. Anything deeper - I don't like to do, if I can help it. It's...rude."
Holmes was greeted in the morning with hot tea and cold rain, desultory clouds the color of tombstones hanging low in the air, wrapping around the city like wool.
"I am more interested in what happened before them," Holmes replied, and flipped purposely through the pages.
Holmes quieted him with a beneficent wave of his hand. “No, you are quite right. There is certainly a game...but I’ve not the faintest idea as to the end he is playing towards.”
"Lestrade does not pay me at all. When called upon by the Yard my usual fee is waived in service of the crown."
"Stay then," he said, taking Watson's hand again. He felt genuinely tied to Watson now, as if their souls had become one. He told himself it was simply Watson's blood in his veins speaking for him, but that hardly seemed to matter.
But that hardly made a difference to Holmes; fools constantly spoke as if the nonsense they spouted were immutable truths.
Holmes’ good hand made a hard fist against the wooden armrest. “Obviously,” he bit out. “To that point, I should not have allowed you to stay at all.”
Holmes looked up, a jeweler's lope screwed into his eye for reasons Watson could not fathom. It made him look distorted, a giant automaton come to life. He glanced at the clock. "Hmmm, yes...you may have a point. Very well, I'll to bed in a moment." Then he bent over his work once more.
Holmes had spent the last several days ferreting out what information he could and thus knew already what he was looking for, and the most likely places to find it. To that end his first destination was the cellar, and he paused on his way only long enough to pocket a few semi-valuable items; a silver candlestick from the table and a trinket box inlaid with pearls he found laying carelessly atop the mantle.
"Newman was obviously his man," he muttered, "here he mentions that Newman is 'returning to London' - he must've traveled in order to maintain the thrall. Quite a risk, I'd think. If the man were delayed, he might start to fight it."
"If things are as dangerous as I think, it will be a relief. I have reason to believe they are far worse." He stood, tipping his cap to Watson. "Should you need to send me word you will find several urchin children within easy sight of your surgery. Call upon any one of them; they will find me."
"I had never given it much thought before," he admitted, slowly turning the idea over in his mind.  It made a good deal of sense, now Holmes had pointed it out. He glanced over and found the detective silently laughing at him, some dark amusement flitting it way through his eyes. "What is it?"
A bit later Mrs. Hudson came up the steps with tea, finding him with the letters spread out before him like a jigsaw puzzle. He'd been staring at them for well over an hour but found it devilishly hard to concentrate. Watson haunted all his thoughts, the dark space behind his eyes filled with bone white hands and golden smiles tinged in blood.
The man’s features were twisted in horror, frozen in eternal shock and between the teeth of his gaping mouth something protruded. Holmes removed it, unsurprised to find a crucifix of fine silver, encrusted with a single small jewel and fastened round the man’s neck by a delicate chain.
"Hmmm," Holmes agreed with a non-committal grunt. The top few buttons were still undone on his shirt, sleeves dangling like Spanish moss. He threw his coat on and draped the cravat around his neck, not bothering to tie it.
Sturgerson smiled slightly. “He believes in his own experience, and what he sees. His experience has not been pleasant, and what he sees are bodies.”
“You should have deduced as much yourself,” Holmes countered, and Watson was forced to admit the truth of it. He, who had boasted of killing every vampire he met in the city, and hadn’t realized one was living right under his nose. He could think of no good response, but thankfully Holmes saved him the trouble.
"I wouldn't presume to tell the Inspector how best to waste the constabulary's time," Holmes answered smoothly, flashing Lestrade the loveliest of smiles, "You'd know far better than I."
He could resist out of sheer stubbornness, but to what aim? He didn’t wish to antagonize his brother and even if he did, there were far more creative avenues to explore than simple obstinacy.  Besides, all else aside Holmes was a connoisseur of knowledge, and in this critical area his understanding was woefully incomplete. He had no objection to learning more about thrall than the little Watson had been able to tell him.
"A doctor stopped by a few days ago," she said, thrusting the letter at him. "He left this for you. Where have you even
do is run." Holmes cast a shrewd look his direction and Watson felt transparent, all his secrets laid bare  beneath Holmes' dissecting gaze. "I know you are considering asking it of me, doctor. You might as well not bother."
A sound like distant thunder reverberated from deep within Mycroft’s chest. "If you believe I did not trouble myself, you are a larger idiot than I thought."
The moment stretched on, tense and unforgiving, the air filled with an energy so palpable the room nearly vibrated with it though each man remained motionless, trapped together in this strange drama like characters from a renaissance painting.
“He was only hired two nights ago,” the inspector said defensively and Holmes' amusement grew, some inimical mirth winding it's way through his dark eyes.
Probably sensing the doctor’s sudden uneasiness (it was an uncanny trait of all the Holmes, after all), the government official took the conversation in his own hands.
The warm smell of self-made sponge cake wavers through Mrs. Hudson’s small flat. Their landlady had offered her kitchen as the set for Antoni’s food segment and had puttered around nearby ever since, presumable to shower in Antoni’s overflowing charm. The scene is so domestic and homey (especially now, when Mrs. Hudson makes some tea “as a refreshment for your hardworking boys” and Antoni gushes over antique tea-set while they take a break from filming while the cake is baking) and John catches himself wishing Sherlock and Rosie were there with them. Sherlock had taken on babysitting duty this morning, off with Rosie to god-knows-where doing god-knows-what. John indulges in a small private fantasy that they’d just come rushing in the door and join the merry baking-round. It’s enough to make him smile and flush and he quickly tries to overplay it with a sip of tea.
Really, he was pouring his heart out in the open here, although his vocabulary on the subject was limited and his experiences quite poor. But he tried, thank you very much, and John treated it like it was no big deal whatsoever.
“No, I’m sorry, I’m not” A wave of guilt hit him for trying to fool his partner, and it mixed with all the stressful emotions of the day’s events. While everything sort of came crushing down on him, his mouth set into motion, to spill all of his pathetic thoughts and feelings into awareness.
Their small “outing” was a complete success. All the nurses and doctors at the party were absolutely smitten with Sherlock, who charmed his way through like it was something he did on a regular basis. John just stood next to him, looking like the cat that got the canary; all proud about his partner (who was termed “one hell of a catch!” by Holly).
The detective only gave him an overly sweet, buttery smile; before he gracefully threw himself in his chair, to stare at his brother with an unreadable expression. Immediately, the playful air changed in the room, to something more tense. Mycroft nodded soberly, acknowledging his brother’s presence.
It’s good that they get to catch up now after this long investigation, but John feels a little cross at both of them for abandoning him like that. To be at the mercy of five fabulous tornados.
"I'll take us home" he promised. Right on cue, Lestrade approached, but halted some meters away from the pair. John guessed they were a strange sight to behold, but Greg was (no matter what Sherlock had to say about the matter) a smart observer. John was thankful that Sherlock didn't seem to notice the presence of a third party (and if he did, choose to ignore it). Instead, he huddled even closer to John (how that was physically possible was beyond the doctor) as if he wanted to hide inside of John's body. His large hands desperately clung to the jumper, as if he was afraid that John would leave him alone in these desperate times. John sought Greg's gaze and tried to communicate their dire need for a cab. The DI raised his eyebrows a little, but his eyes were filled with worry.  John gave him another pleading look, and Greg understood. He walked away wordlessly to hail a cab for them. The army doctor sighed, thankful for a friend like Greg.
He closed his mouth with a snap, blushing hotly. John laughed lightly, cradling his partner’s head securely, to press a light kiss against the pointy tip of his nose.
fantasies) curled in a small ball, with John’s arm securely around his waist, and a hand gently patting his hair.
"She has always been different, our Violet, she has, but we didn't...we couldn't..." the woman made a strangled noise and buried her face in her shattered looking husband’s cardigan. John nodded in sympathy, but kept his doctor demeanour.
John had been home at Baker Street for one month; Sherlock had come back to the living three months ago. The doctor didn’t take it well, at first. There was arguing, and screaming, and denial, and anguish. John refused to even see Sherlock, let alone live with him, and for a few hellish weeks Sherlock seriously thought he had lost his only friend over a stupid nurse he met at the surgery. He was on the verge of another drug relapse. He didn’t know how he brought up the strength to resist. He was glad he did, though. One day, John was back at his doorstep; soaking wet from the rain, a stormy expression on his face, with two large suitcases in tow. They were together again.
Watson fretted a bit and chewed at his lip, intimately aware that Holmes thought far more highly of his moral capacity than himself. But to refuse was to leave Holmes defenseless. "If... if you truly wish this, then write down a list of things you refuse to do, things you would not forgive me for if I accidentally order you to do something. I shouldn't even speak with you honestly, once it's done."
Holmes considered that, a contemplative tip to head. “Possibly, but who would assist in the endeavor? I was given to understand Stamford was the chief mentalist among you; has he been replaced, or is there another who could perform such a task?”
He ran a hand along the rough stone, found the small grooves where strong fingers could grab hold and pull. He jerked with sudden strength and part of the wall came away, a hidden door opening outward to reveal a secret room within. Small and narrow, it had once been used to hide the treasures of the church in case of siege or civil unrest.
"That depends entirely upon your own actions. If your affliction comes with the prerequisite taste for human blood, I do not see how I can."
He sighed again and went back to trying to read through the singed and soot covered letters. The chief of them comprised correspondence from a nameless man - undoubtedly Newman's Master - and were addressed to the vicar. There were threats both direct and implied aimed toward Deighton and at his son. Newman was named several times as well, often in the context of being a watchdog. But none of that told him anything he did not already know...
"I did not, though I suppose I should have. I- I do not use my powers often. I have found the best way to hide among mortals is to act as one of them as much as I am able."
Watson looked up, interested but not without reservations. For all his intelligence, he could not fathom how Holmes would presume to know the intricacies of a moment a hundred years in the past, nor the intentions of a vampire he knew nothing about. "How could you know that? No one could know that. I never knew her; I certainly could not guess at what her intentions might have been."
He held up a pale hand for inspection; a reddened mark like a burn arced across his palm. "From his crucifix," he explained. "And the bullet struck my arm. Painful, but I've had the day to heal and he missed my heart. Terrible aim, honestly."
"Lestrade..." Holmes mumbled, wrenching his eyelids open and it felt like tearing the dressing off a fresh wound.
"I swear I've told nothing but the truth," he protested. "What's best for Holmes is, logically, for me to stay away from him as much as possible, to guard him from afar and keep watch while allowing him his free will. But I... I can't stay away. I’ve
"I think-" Holmes stood slowly, hanging onto the arm of the chair. "-not." His knees buckled and he sagged.
Watson watched Holmes leave, giving more attention than he should to the vanishing line of his shoulders, the black swirl of coat. He tried to get back to work and found himself utterly devoid of concentration, his mind overrun, thoughts bent again and again toward the man he had so recently viewed as an adversary. Sherlock Holmes, the great detective. Sherlock Holmes, preeminent champion of law and order. Sherlock Holmes, the man he had thought he might kill...
"I will not allow harm to come to you," Watson assured him, voice warm with conviction, and growing warmer when he received no response. "I am in earnest, Holmes."
It was a question well below Watson’s intellect, and Holmes shot him a look of mild exasperation. “Who else would I ask? You say you know little, tell me what you
Leaving the city will not be enough; you will be searched for in connection with Montressor's crime, and it will look all the more suspicious that you are gone. Furthermore, you are tied to the church for reasons I still have not yet divined. Your supposed death will be a boon for me in that investigation as well."
"Very well," he replied stiffly. "For right now, I will retire elsewhere for the day, as the upstairs room is not yet ready."
"That's a wonderful idea," Watson said happily, no doubt eager to encourage Holmes to spend his time in well lit, public places where the threat of danger was minimal, and not sneaking into churches and skulking about alleyways where known murders lurked in the shadows.
"I do not know of any other such creatures," Watson replied with a shake of his head. "I have heard of some; werewolves, spirits, fae... but as far as I know, no evidence speaks of their existence, which I suppose lends more credence towards your theory of this affliction being a scientific phenomenon.”
Holmes nodded and then proceeded to ignore him in favor of his laboratory and a pile of notes he'd scribbled in three different languages apparently at random. Watson found himself with no great desire to leave, and passed the night entertaining himself with Holmes’ large library of books. It was well past 3 in the morning when he looked back up.
Holmes was far less bothered and kissed him back with unguarded passion. As with all things to which he applied himself, Holmes was exceptionally good at kissing. Even so, it wasn’t enough, these stolen moments of human affection; having only
Watson's eyebrows shot up. "You smell like bird shit," he said bluntly. "I can barely catch your scent under all that. What on earth have you been up to?"
"I do hope this is your handiwork, Doctor," he muttered to himself. The trouble was, of course, that he could not implement the next part of his investigation until he knew for certain. And he would not know until evening.
"Unnaturally so,” Jackson corrected once Holmes had moved back. “And so, you are out of scientific answers. That leaves only the supernatural as an explanation. If you choose to believe, that is."
In a dark, closed-off part of his mind he didn't like to acknowledge Watson imagined what it might be like to feed from him, to part his rumpled collar at the neck and bite down, that moment's resistance before teeth pierced flesh, the euphoric rush of blood. Watson's hand tangled in the dark mess of hair...he wondered what Holmes might taste like...
Holmes didn’t answer, simply rode the waves of nausea as the room spun and swooped around him like a carnival ride, analyzing and breaking down the various sensations as data. It was extraordinarily easy to ignore the vicar.
“It’s the same as Langley, right?” Holmes did not stop for him and so Lestrade was obliged to follow after, still talking. “A body drained of blood with two holes in his neck. Some madman’s running through London thinking he’s a bloody vampire and now he’s killed again. It’s the same bloke, ain’t it?”
Holmes calmed, and after a moment looked vaguely around, eyes glassy and unfocused. "The vicar?" he asked, mind already turned to the case, even damaged as he was.
Watson glanced at him askance, and were it not for the fact he had touched Holmes' mind and knew the great breadth and depths of it himself, he would think the man was sporting with him. But Holmes was not sporting.
As Holmes approached, another Inspector by the name of Gregson broke away from the throng and stepped over to him.
"No. He read my thoughts one night at my behest as a point of scientific inquiry; his presence was unmistakable, as was its absence. And since the thrall, I can find the shadow of him in my mind if I stretch my senses to look for it. It was not present that night.”
Watson pressed his lips together. Damn Holmes and his infallible ‘logic’. "There is a trail of blood through the house, from the cellar to the upstairs, where carnage ensued. There is a charred corpse-shaped pile of ashes on the bed, and two dead men. There's enough evidence to prove they were dragging a bleeding man upstairs to some horrific fate; perhaps the corpse on the bed is his remains."
"He arrived here unexpectedly one night and saw you drinking her blood. Am I correct in deducing that your heightened senses become somewhat dulled when you feed? When all you can focus on is the blood?" Distracted, hearing nothing but the pulse of blood through a living heart, the smell of it in the nose, its taste on the tongue and the hot slide of it as it coated the inside of a cold mouth...it might be possible to catch a vampire off guard.
"I should like you to try," Holmes pressed. He was a man of science; he dealt in all things with facts and cold reason. Watson should have known better than to make such an outlandish claim if he did not intend to back it up.
It was not yet noon when Holmes left the church and so he returned briefly to Baker Street for a bit of lunch before continuing with the investigation. Stamford was no longer there to badger him about such things as sleep and food, and so he was forced to keep track of these frivolities himself.
"I am being serious," Watson said, reading Holmes' sour expression. "I could set up a drop location somewhere neutral to both of us."
He removed from beneath his waistcoat a long, bulky envelope, both postage and address from the Netherlands.  He passed it to Holmes, who snatched up the parcel greedily and pulled out several sheets of foolscap covered front to back in small, neat handwriting. He stared at it a moment.
“She might know something of the business,” Lestrade argued halfheartedly, his will not in the fight.
He reached out and grabbed Holmes' shoulder in a bruising grip. “Where did you go?” he asked quickly, giving him a shake and Holmes pointed behind him. “Jes’ through the rooms there, an’ the kitchen. I were makin’ me way upstairs when I 'eard ye comin'.”
“I haven’t the faintest idea,” Watson admitted. “But I think we have already established ours is a different beast from most.”
"I do not think so, no. She is under a great strain; I would keep her as much apart from the thing as can be managed. Her husband’s crime is not hers to answer for.”
“This is Saint Cyprian’s clergy house,” Newman explained. “It is only Father Deighton and myself who stay here at the moment, and his duties at the church leave him scarce time to care for his birds. As for myself, I fear I know little of the subject. So you see, your skills are sorely needed; perhaps God has guided your feet here.”
Watson dragged them both over to the settee and fell down with Holmes still in his arms, the detective laying half atop him. "It's the thrall. It seems - it seems to intensify emotional attachments," he added finally, and Holmes glanced up.
He was immediately assaulted of course, that deluge of sensory input tearing at his defenses, everything coming so fast and so much he thought for a moment he might become lost in a fugue, just as Stamford had told him Holmes himself occasionally became lost, stuck in the hell of sensory overload...but Watson’s mind was stronger than it had been when he was mortal and he broke free of it in short order, following that gentle pull downwards.
“He was not-” Holmes began obstinately, but this time the club struck his shoulder and he felt something give. He stopped talking.
“Stamford?” he said at last, once Holmes had finished. “You say he claimed to be a friend of Stamford’s? Impossible. The boy had more sense than that.”
"Father Deighton believes you can be turned from the path of sin," Newman continued, seeming unbothered by the silence. "And I believe him. Will you let me help you overcome your earthly fears, and embrace the love of God?"
Holmes could sense the truth somewhere just ahead of him, and pushed on. “Is that what got him killed? Did he talk to the wrong person?”
"And it did not occur to your thick head that he was controlling your mind even then, to convince you to consent to such a dangerous thing?"
"I killed him,” Watson said plainly and without remorse. “Along with his friend Newman and that- creature." He could hardly call it a vampire.
“That is the central point.” There was a good deal more that could be said, but talking required effort, and what energy he had left must be used sparingly.
“Use your head, Sherlock,” he snapped, sounding much as he had when they were children. “Set aside your sentiments, examine the situation logically and you will see that all Stamford did, he did for your welfare.”
Watson walked unhurried as the dawn approached. He kept a number of alternate sleeping places hidden throughout the city, experience having long ago taught him to be ever vigilant of both the sun and humans alike. More than one vampire had met its end at the hands of well-meaning mortals who had pulled their supposedly dead body out of whatever makeshift shelter they had found to weather the daylight.
“He knows by now I have disappeared from Baker Street,” Holmes added, “and you have not been seen for at least as long. It is possible he may assume you killed and drained me as many vampires are wont to do with thralls who have outlived their usefulness, but if I were so disposable, why come to my aid at the church? A less considerate monster would have simply let me die, and found another thrall to do their bidding.”
Holmes kept his face clean of all artifice. "If I did not have evidence, I would not have called on you."
Morning crawled up over the city, cold English sunlight filtering through the dusky windows and Holmes set aside his experiment, grabbed up the oil lamp and took the steps to the garret room with unabashed curiosity.
But when he arrived in the parlor he found a letter awaiting him, having been delivered by one of his Irregulars not a handful of minutes after he had left that morning. He opened it immediately and was greeted with Watson’s elegant, somewhat archaic scrawl:
Holmes snorted softly. “Hmm, if only he’d done the same in regards to murder. Ah well, anything else pertinent to the case?" Most likely the dearth of material items was due to the fact he’d been a thrall. Holmes suspected Newman had been sent to London with the purpose of keeping an eye on Father Deighton; What point would there be in acquiring anything beyond the most basic of necessities?  Would the thrall even allow him to consider such notions as personal comfort and material desires? He did not know. Certainly his own experience did not seem so overpowering in that regard, but it appeared the effect of thrall was different for everyone. Holmes had certainly not detected in Newman any of the all-encompassing devotion for his Master than he held for Watson.
Watson felt a wash of irritation suffuse him. True, he was not as forthcoming with the detective as he should have been but he was hardly the only reticent character in the room. “Well why the hell didn’t
"There would be no better time to risk it than now; we are quite safe here, and it may bear useful results."
"No one else will make you their thrall," Watson said firmly, rolling up his sleeve. The he bit down on his own wrist and quickly brought it to Holmes' mouth.
"No!" Watson says, shocked. "No Holmes, you can't-" He swallowed hard, looking back to Mycroft. "Please. Let Holmes make his own choice, whether you trust it or not."
The man considered Holmes’ proposal, finally relenting with a shrug. “He rented some rooms over on Swinton street, near Regent’s square.”
"Can't say I like the idea. I'll be sending two men up with you, to catch you before you break your neck when you slip off that wet slate."
Holmes cleared his nose and said, “I am not so certain of that,” watched as Watson blinked at him, eyes wide and slightly startled.
“We were experimenting as per your suggestion,” he said warmly, but Mycroft only turned his cool gaze towards him with an air of disdainful apathy.
Holmes marked that, continuing with his soft investigation and innocent questions and allowed himself to appear satisfied by the answers given. Finally, they were back at the beginning, Holmes standing in the chapel with Father Deighton as the priest listened to him talk with a grave expression.
He stayed out of the lamplight, clinging to the shadows as he snuck around to the back entrance and Watson was there already, stepping out of the hazy fog as Holmes approached.
Lestrade suppressed a shudder, swallowing thickly. “Good Lord,” he said again, all other words seeming lost to him.
"And age is the only vector by which a vampire's strength increases?" Holmes pressed, and Watson paused before he answered, because Holmes had a sharp look about him, something intense and driving lurking just under the surface of everything he said and Watson didn't trust it, that deconstructing gaze.
Watson walked over to it and pondered. “Yes, I think so. I have leverage the poor soul tied to it did not.” Besides, of the two of them he wasn’t newly turned and starving.
This did make Holmes’ amorous feelings somewhat of a thorny problem, for they were certainly a construct of the thrall. Thus, while both of them desired, it was only Watson’s affection that was genuine. That meant there was a line beyond which there would be no forgiveness, and Watson could not trust Holmes to recognize it.
Watson shrugged, looking briefly away. "I am quite strong. No wall is difficult for me to scale, even with a body in hand."
"Doctor Jackson is no longer a member of this congregation," the priest reminded him, his voice firm. "But perhaps if you speak with him, he will give you the name I cannot."
By the time Watson joined him a few minutes later Holmes had nearly finished pouring half a gin bottle’s worth of accelerant at strategic points around the room. “Place it in the center of the attic there, and douse the corpse with the remainder of this,” he instructed, handing over the bottle as he went to open the street-facing window.
"I haven't the foggiest idea." He looked at Holmes apologetically. "I know that must be terribly disappointing. But she told me nothing that I can remember, just... finished killing me, and then gave me life again. She left while I was still-" Watson's mouth worked soundlessly, "-it is not an easy process to die and return."
The whole business took less than seconds and still he was almost too late, the vampire held back only by the bonds around his wrists and the fact the bed was clamped to the floor. Even so, the creature had a hold on Holmes’ mind and the detective was pathetically attempting to reach it, one bloodied and trembling hand outstretched, mere inches away from the creatures’ mouth.
fight and that was the problem.  As it was, he couldn’t even walk...and that was very much Watson’s fault.
And that was that; Mycroft had delivered his ultimatum and would not be moved. No one could move Mycroft once he had planted himself; not even Holmes.
A thin and cynical smile slit the corner of Holmes' mouth. "If she is dead there is no fear offending her delicate sensibilities," he replied brusquely.
Holmes clicked his tongue and reached for his pipe. “You forget that a thrall must be maintained, and Deighton’s parish sits well within London’s borders. As a vicar he could not always be leaving and returning again without catching the attention of the bishop, and the sire had no idea how tight a grip you might have over the upper members of London’s clergy. He could not risk their notice becoming yours, nor could he risk entering the city himself. Newman, on the other hand, who was not a minister and had never been ordained, was free to come and go as he pleased.
Holmes studied him for a quiet moment. "Well," he said finally with stoic reason, "if you are already dead then there is hardly any reason to fear a man coming to kill you.”
“-we risk burning down half of London,” Holmes finished. “Yes, that is why you must follow my instructions exactly.” He took the stairs two at time. “Put the corpse into some of your own clothing, and bring it upstairs.”
“He was a most remarkable boy,” Holmes continued, “devilishly clever. Had the most extraordinary gift for languages, as well as possessing the singular ability to know precisely what I was thinking at any given time.”
Watson huffed, unsatisfied. “So, you do not trust me with your secrets,” he concluded, “only your life.” But even as he said it he understood it to be an affliction that plagued them both.
him, beyond even all the very obvious and logical reasons why he should be bothered. He wanted to think on that. He wanted to
"Did they remove anything?" He went to the most well-used books first, those with a focus on vampires specifically. Kramer had thought he was dealing with a supernatural evil. He would have researched; he would have wanted to be certain.
Holmes grinned, because Mycroft was only telling the truth, which is all they'd ever done between themselves. Nor did Holmes take any offense to the statement; that Mycroft deigned to come at all, however grudgingly said more than words ever could and they both knew it. "You are a treasure beyond price, brother mine."
. There was something flowing past him, shimmering like gossamer. An undercurrent of love, adoration and deep respect. Holmes could feel it if he concentrated, and tried to reach out with his own mind, to touch that glimmering surface...
Watson came, pulling Holmes into his arms and holding him tightly, Holmes lips on him already. He didn't  care if Watson could enjoy such physical affections; Holmes could and he intended to. "The day has never moved so slowly."
Thrall was, according to all sources, one of the most insidious weapons a vampire could wield. Not all vampires were skilled at it, but the older they became the more likely they were to have mastered the art, as it was a foregone conclusion that any vampire who intended to live long would have at least a few thralls under its command.
"You admitted when you first turned that you could not help killing; it was a compulsion you forced yourself to overcome. That compulsion has a source, Watson. If it does not come from you, then where?"
Watson hummed thoughtfully, then looked again at the dead man, his expression pensive. “At the risk of conceit, I believe this was a message meant for me.”
"If you have indeed lived a hundred years, I doubt I have seen as much as yourself; I have not yet lived half a lifetime. However, I have witnessed both great evil and great goodness in that time. We, mankind, are neither inherently good nor inherently evil. If I were to make a sweeping judgement, I would say what we are is inherently conflicted - and afraid."
"No, you are not Stamford," Holmes replied gruffly, one hand braced on the mantle as he stared at nothing at all. He considered what he wanted to say, and how to communicate it in as few words as possible. Talking right now seemed an unbearably heavy task. "Stamford was...a gentle soul. He made me a better man by his influence. You have made me a worse one."
The third morning the vicar himself made an appearance, and taking notice of Holmes stepped over, beckoning him inside with a firm but weathered hand upon his shoulder.
"What does the cocaine do to your mind?" Watson asked curiously. "The isolation of cocaine as a compound happened fifty years after I was turned."
Fortunately, Watson learned long ago that vampires did not require mortal medicines to heal the sick. Not exactly.
"Holmes!" Watson said, wrapping his arm around Holmes' chest to hold him back. "Settle, man, please.” He turned towards the door. “We should go."
He took a deep breath and stepped over, found himself quite unharmed. He turned back with a smile and a sigh of relief. “It’s clear,” he said, and Watson quickly joined him.
"Good," Watson said, his voice both full of praise and relief that at the very least, Holmes' mind still seemed to be functioning. "Knowing you of course, people won't be surprised to see you out and about in a week or two with a cane and a limp."
"I hadn’t noticed," Newman replied, sounding bored. "But as I said, no one has disturbed his things."
And thus the terms of his employment were settled. Point in fact, Holmes abided within God’s law for the next several days, tending to the birds, sleeping in the shed, and acquainting himself with the staff of both church and clergy house.
"That would depend on what proof was presented, but now it is my turn to ask a question: what is it you expect me to do about the person who is after you? If your fantastical claims are true this individual may have very valid reasons for wanting you back in your grave, the least of which is that it is undeniably where you belong. Such actions might not even be criminal; I do not know that England's laws against murder apply to persons already dead."
Watson shared none of those thoughts. He was acutely aware he cared far more for Holmes than the detective did for him, nor could he expect anything else.
"Ah, Brother," Newman said, smiling like a puppet. "I had just come in search of you. This is Mister Sherlock Holmes - a detective."
The man had seen Watson feeding from his wife and, understandably terrified, brought his suspicions to the church. Then he -- along, no doubt, with Father Newman -- convinced Langley to take up arms against the doctor. When that proved futile, the desperate and unhinged Montressor, now teetering dangerously on the edge of madness had lured the unsuspecting Kramer -- his friend, shop patron and fellow believer in the supernatural -- into the alley and killed him in a mad and clumsy attempt at a frame-up.
Montressor's street was quiet and dark, a welcome change after the bonfire frenzy of Cavendish. Holmes had stayed only long enough to make certain the fire was under control and the nearest families out of danger.
“If by ‘work’ you mean you forced me out of your mind, then yes. Yes, it worked. You also fugued; had I been any other vampire, you would be dead.”
"I suppose it doesn’t really matter," Watson conceded. "If someone is drunk and I drink from them, I do feel something akin to drunkenness, but I don’t believe I’ve ever had the opportunity to try cocaine. It struck me as useful for surgery, and not much else."
"To gain our trust," Mycroft replied sourly, directing his words at Watson, who shook his head helplessly.
"You are very perceptive," Holmes replied approvingly, his voice soft and low. "When was the last time you saw the doctor?"
"Many men have come to find work," the reverend agreed amicably, "Perhaps the church can help you in your endeavors. What skills do you have, Mr...?"
"Mine," he whispered, the word fierce and ragged-edged as he slid one hand down to curl around Holmes' hip, pulling him closer.
Unsurprising.  Mycroft Holmes had no more of a sociable bend to his personality than himself. Less than, if one were being honest. "No matter, I shall contact him myself. He has a propensity to ignore any correspondence not related to his work."
“I- I don’t understand...” Something was wrong. Holmes should not be immune to influence. And he certainly should not still be in love with Watson...
"I'm sorry," he said, and started backing away, letting go of Holmes just enough so he could walk, but keeping his hand on his arm as he herded them towards the door, his eyes on Mycroft.
All right then, it had been petty of him, and he was marginally disappointed in himself to find that after a hundred years, he still had the capacity for such picayune urges. But then again he had worked hard to retain his humanity, to live among mortals and love them and feed on them without killing. To befriend them. Perhaps a moment here and there of all too human weakness was no more than his due.
"You don't have to be," Watson said, but truth be told, a man who could only come out at night was a terrible guardian.
John moved to them immediately "Stay behind me" he said now putting himself between them and Moriarty.
I let a week pass to have our conversation slip from my flatmate’s mind. It was then when I started my elaborate plan. The first day I would arrive late at night before John went to sleep, subtly complaining that my neck hurt. The following morning, I would have a small bandage on the side of my neck.
about what might happen if one was a character in those stories" he blushed again and finished his tea. "You said this was for a case?" he asked.
"It’s a set of custom-made canine extenders I bought online" writing down my findings from that next slide, not looking up.
A deeper, more feral growl came louder "Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?" squeezing even further.
I imagined John with these teeth, hovering over me. I shuddered with the thrill, as I imagined him breathing into my neck, running his tongue along it, and then sinking down into me. Taking me for his own. I grew impossibly hard at the notion and had to palm myself for some semblance of relief. Yet, that only spurred me on more. I needed to release. I took myself in hand and thought of all the terrible, wonderful things John would do to me. Shuddering and bucking into my own hand, my orgasm came fast and hard. Taking a few deep breaths, I looked back into the mirror. If just the thought of John taking me brought this type of reaction, then what could it possibly be like if he took me for real? I ran my tongue over my new teeth and smiled. Time to finish this experiment.
“Go to the edge of the balcony and keep a lookout,” she told Sherlock. He left them and casually made his way over to look down at the crowd and surrounding club.
"Why does this intrigue you so?" I cocked my head and surprisingly he started to blush; but why? He looked away and rubbed the back of his neck, stumbling on his next words "I...uh...well… I’m not sure...forget it" and he left the kitchen to go sit in his chair by the fireplace.
"You gentlemen might as well join the party as well" he called Sherlock and Lestrade. They appeared in the doorway and made their way over.
When Lestrade felt the teeth puncture his neck he was transported back to the time they met. He was a sergeant at the time working his way up to the inspector.
He whistled and the two other irish vamps appeared at his side. "See you soon" he turned and the three all disappeared into the night.
“Hungry?” I inquired “You know my methods, I don’t eat on a case, slows me down” and pocketed my mobile and grabbed my coat and scarf.
I quickly tapped our goodbyes to Lestrade on my phone and we caught a cab home. I could feel the tension in the cab the whole drive home. I was staring out the window and idly tonguing one of my teeth as John tried not to stare and bounce his leg in (sexual) frustration. When we arrived, I exited the cab immediately making John have to pay, and quickly made my way into the building and up the stairs into our flat and into the loo. On my way through the flat, I quickly texted Mrs. Hudson to shut off the power for a few hours, I had told her in no uncertain terms my plan to seduce John and she was 100% on board. Entering the loo and locking it behind me, I opened the sink mirror and took out the contact lenses I had stashed away in a toothpaste box. I opened the flashlight app on my phone and opened the case.
Lestrade was dressed similarly to Sherlock. Gone was his normal suit & tie and occasional trench coat. He was now also in jeans, a short button-up shirt, and boots.
I got up and stretched from my seat at the kitchen table and walked with my mug of tea to sit opposite John in my chair.
“Someone in London has been draining and killing. In fact, you have two that I don’t recognize in your club right now, did you know? Let me remind you that I own London. If these miscreants are allowed to roam the street, that's bad for business; both mine and yours. Who are they, and whom is their leader?”
She pulled Lestrade into her lap and looked into his eyes. “C’mon Detective Inspector, I expect you to play along. Can’t have people thinking you’re a cop”.
For the remainder of the hour, I practiced with my new teeth, mostly biting into apples and trying to speak without hints of lisp. I didn’t want to show my hand too quickly. John arrived home at 7 pm and quickly told him to go change as Lestrade wanted us at a crime scene; double murder. He smiled and went up to his room to change. When he came back down a few minutes later, I saw him subtly assess me as he turned his head to the side and said “Somethings different” and then narrowed his eyes at me.
They heard a faint whistle through the crowd which they noticed that the two by the bar, their heads snapped up. A third person appeared with them, their back towards Sherlock and Lestrade. Sherlock got the awful feeling that he'd seen this silhouette before. Straining his eyes to see properly through the blinking lights, the person finally turned in profile and Sherlock was able to make out one word "Roof" before his eyes widened in horror.
"I can only make out a few words here and there based on their lip movement, nothing of consequence".
"Canine extenders...wait...Sherlock?" he leaned forward on the kitchen table begging me to look him in the eyes. I felt his heated gaze and tried my best not to look up, however, I did feel my face start to blush.
The rooftop door burst open and Cereza was on him in a second. One arm pushed between him and John and the other reaching out around his throat.
“Is that so? Well, I guess I’ll have to break out my old uniform for you now” he poked me in the side.
Ciri relaxed in the seat beside her. “He showed up about 2 months ago with a handful of them. I’ve noticed their number increased substantially over the last couple of weeks”
We rode in a cab on the way to the crime and scene and greeted Lestrade when we arrived. I quickly ignored the niceties and went straight to work. It was a simple open and shut case, barely even a 4, and had it solved within the hour. While Lestrade was distracted talking to another officer, I made my way over to John. Stepping into his personal space “John, I’m hungry” I growled low and made sure I showed him my teeth. I heard his breath hitch as he stared into my eyes. I leaned lower to whisper into his ear and breath onto his neck. “Perhaps, I should take you home now before I get a little too...ravenous?” I heard his breath quicken “oh, god, yes” he breathed. Leaning back to look into his eyes once more, I saw they were utterly shattered, his pupils blown wide with lust.
"Something from a company called... Chompers?" he appeared at the threshold of the kitchen and strode over to the table leaving the small package beside me.
“That was...amazing” I could feel him smiling. “I didn’t imagine that right? That just happened? And your teeth and those eyes…I..just..wow” he nuzzled into me.
“Was it not you who said that everyone and their mother already thought you and Sherlock had been shagging for years now?”
John went over Sherlock taking his hand in his and rested his head on Sherlock’s chest. He could feel the warmth in him and his heartbeat calmed in. Sherlock brought his free hand to embrace John pulling him closer.
Lestrade took out his phone and started to call for an ambulance, but she stopped him. Lestrade looked at her bewildered “You’ll die if you don’t get medical attention”.
John paced the roof of the nightclub, keeping a look &  ear-out for any trouble down the alleyways and checking to make sure Sherlock was still alive. When Sherlock informed them that there were two suspects in the club and he was purposely getting closer to them, it set John into a bad place mentally. Of course, Sherlock would go headfirst into danger. And like a punch to the gut, John heard it. Sherlock’s heartbeat all of a sudden kicking into overdrive. Something changed, something went wrong.
"Tell me, have you had a string of new vamps popping up in your city, along with several bodies? Hmm? Yes? Well, the same is happening in Dublin. That's why I came here." She released him and took a step back.
“You’re thinking...You can’t wait to inspect your work and track the healing progress of all the bites on me for your case aren’t you?” He mumbled into my chest.
"The teeth. I mean when you put them in. Assuming that's what the intended purpose was..." he took a sip of his tea, still smiling. I didn't understand why this amused him so.
to eat while we’re out” and walked out the door not looking back. I heard the fridge open and close, he must have put it there. Good, something to run a few experiments on later.
"Isn't funny, even after all this time, we keep running into each other" he garbled. "If it's not us, it's one of our family. Seems we're destined to always be at odds with each other".
Cereza strolled over to Lestrade and gave him an obvious up and down with her eyes. She attached a small bumblebee pin** to the lapel of his shirt and unbuttoned the top four of his buttons. “Maybe a little more column B for you, Detective Inspector” she teased, and he blushed.
“You…” John took a breath “You can’t go out looking like that” he brought his lips to Sherlock’s neck, pressing his body against his.
“My family’s sigil, if someone from my world sees it, they’ll know you’re with me. It will open doors for you and in some cases, bar you from others. Only those whom I trust with my life are allowed to wear this pin”.
On the 5th day of my ruse, we got take-away from Angelo's. I took a bite and quickly realized that something was wrong, it tasted differently, did Angelo change his recipe?
It was a 30min drive to the nightclub in SoHo. As they exited the vehicle, Cereza took Lestrade and Sherlock on each of her arms to enter the club, while John took off to make his way to the roof. One look at the bouncer was all Cereza needed to give for them to gain entrance. The club was dark, with music pounding and lights and lasers pulsing over the crowd of patrons. There was a bar on each of the levels, 3 Sherlock noted. Cereza kept them close as they approached the employee guarding the entrance to the VIP lounge where the owner no doubt was.
“Well, I would have chosen Sherlock, but as you can imagine, I don’t John would like that very much”
On the rooftop stood the specter of James Moriarty. The hair and jawline differed, but the same dead shark eyes and cheshire grin remained. John didn't move. He couldn't look away.
“She says that it should be back on in a few hours, nothing should spoil in the fridge” He called from outside the loo door. “Sherlock, everything ok?” he knocked.
"Hmmm" John began and he leaned over and took a fork full of my linguini "There shouldn't be any problem, I asked them to not put garlic in our meals" and I saw just a hint of a smile creep onto my bloggers face.
"Diet and food acquisition" taking a sip of my tea. John always made the best tea. I smiled into my cup.
We’re going to be hitting up Crimson Prism tonight. Sherlock thinks the next victim will be from there -JW
Lestrade tensed. “Is this what I am tonight? You’re meal ticket? The distraction while Sherlock catches the bad guy?”
John couldn’t take it anymore he went to go through the rooftop exit but he heard a soft “whump” behind him. He turned and thought he must be looking at a ghost.
The next day I decided it was time. Clearly, John had figured out my plan but still wanted to play along. He left for the surgery early in the morning and I knew he would back around sundown, perfect timing. I opened my package from Chompers and read the instructions.
A low growl was returned and he turned over onto his back. The moonlight was now shining right on me as I smiled down on him. Judging by his reaction to my intrusion into his room, the teeth, and my eyes, he was already breathing heavily and his cock leaking copious amounts of precum.
Despite having some knowledge as to the strength of Holmes’ mind, Waston had no real idea what to expect. Some people took more naturally to the art than others, particularly those with latent psychic abilities of their own. He didn’t know if Holmes was such a man; he had not been in his head long enough to find out.
They began again, and once more the library whirled and danced about him, but this time when he tried to gain access, he could feel Holmes’ resistance as the shelves spun faster, eluding him. He smiled in approval, then let a bit more of his strength flow in. He reached out and grabbed hold of one of the bookcases...
“True, but they were not. They were made by a man who wore military boots with the heels worn down and a large crack in the leather sole. I often smoke in my parlor and dispose of the ash out the window; he had a bit of tobacco stuck to the bottom of his left boot.”
"A ten percent tincture for morphine," Holmes answered immediately, “seven for cocaine.” He cocked a glance in Watson’s direction, critical tilt to his eyebrows. "I am not as careless as you and Mycroft seem determined to make me."
"Nevermind," Holmes said, because he could already guess at the contents of their conversation. Montressor was neither clever nor brave; he would not have approached Langley without being prompted. And he certainly could not have afforded to send the man after Watson with a pouch full of silver bullets; Newman's influence was evident. "I believe you saw what you claim you did. However, there are logical explanations for each point."
Watson shook his head. "Not outright, no. He said he knew what I was and then called me a 'tool of the devil' along with a good many other colorful epithets. Father Newman is quite well respected among the congregation and I didn't want trouble from the vicar or anyone else, so I left. A few days later, Langley began following me. Discreetly at first, but with more boldness as the days passed. You know how that story ends."
"Nothing that is of any consequence to anyone, anymore." Holmes stopped talking and for a moment the world fell soft and silent around them, something delicate in the air but then Holmes stood abruptly and Watson felt as if a spell had been broken, like he had just woke blinking and confused from a years long sleep. "The night wears on Doctor, and there is work to be done." Holmes pointed at him. "If you are to be of any use to me do not waste what little time you have in idle conversation. Go, learn what you can, send me a missive at dawn. Each day brings delay I can ill afford."
Watson pondered that. "The idea is... disquieting. Hard enough to imagine some curse has been placed upon me; to think a disease, an organism, an infection is living within me..." he shuddered.
“Thank you,” said the stranger with a formal nod, “I know the hour is unusual, but the matter is quite urgent.” He removed his hat to reveal blond hair as carefully groomed as the rest of him.
It might have been hyperbole, or Mycroft might have been entirely serious. It was impossible to tell and with Mycroft, it was always best to err on the side of caution.
not. His skin was dead; the stolen blood that sustained his strange life would not be wasted on warming his flesh.
"What reason could there possibly be? Deighton and Newman both had their heads smashed in, and you nearly joined ‘em. It's a bloody wonder you're not dead yourself.”
Jackson’s eyes narrowed. "I expect you to find evidence that this man is indeed out for my life. I do not care if you agree with his motivations. But if it eases your conscience, I haven't killed while feeding in half a century."
"No, of course not; he wants you dead. However, he doesn't yet want to kill you himself, which is as favorable an outcome as one could hope for."
"A parrot?" he repeated dumbly, because while he had indeed glimpsed into that raging maelstrom of thought, it had not bestowed upon him any enhanced powers of understanding. It had been no more than a glance anyway; any longer and he'd risked being pulled in, pulled under and drowned in the constant flood of sensory data that poured into Holmes' mind from every direction and battered him ceaselessly. Every scent, every noise, every glance was a full-on assault. Each trickle of information became a stream of data the required processing and cataloging, each stream running on until it met up with others, became great flowing tributaries of information, vast rivers of knowledge all rushing into the immense sea of his memory.
Holmes ignored him in favor of pursing his own line of questioning. “Judging by your attire and schedule, you believe sunlight to be harmful to you, yes?"
Holmes sighed loudly at the fools the world insisted he suffer. “Chiefly, the contents of his stomach.”
Watson squeezed his hand reassuringly. "Who could have guessed? Even I had no idea such a secret society existed in the city." He walked over to the window and Holmes joined him instantly, saying,
Then, John would turn his head, to rest it in the crook of the geniuses’ neck, to whisper a soft “Come to bed” in his ear.
“So, you lied to him,” John chuckled at the sheer ridiculousness of it. The lengths they would go to with the Holmes brothers…
With every moment passing when his life was invaded and turned upside down, he felt his confidence in this mantra slip. Only just now he came to fully acknowledge, that Greg might have a massive point. He might need the help of the Fab 5 more than he initially anticipated.
“I’m stupid.” The doctor snapped, getting irritated by the playful way Sherlock was treating this topic. He didn’t feel taken seriously at all.
before. It may take a while to break the shell of a Holmes, but the reward of getting a glimpse into their ‘human’ side was worth it.
The hate subsided, but the sinking feeling of being nothing but a necessity for his friend stayed, always lurking in the back of his mind when he found himself unable to fall asleep. Because Sherlock didn't do feelings. And John, after having enough time to let his heart out of the closet when the object of its desire was gone, had to admit to himself that he did feelings. In fact, did quite a lot of them when it came to a certain consulting detective. Not that it mattered. Or at least John thought so at that time. He came to this conclusion in one of the heated discussions he had with Sherlock's image in his head (even in John's mind he hadn't have the decency to not be an insufferable bastard). After staring at the untouched cup of tea (he always made one for Sherlock as well for an embarrassing long time) for a small eternity, John decided to live again. He threw Sherlock out of his head (not without a bit of struggle, the man was a stubborn one, after all) and carefully coaxed the image of the world's only consulting detective out of his heart.
John smirked a little, for he knew how to deal with Sherlock's little temper tantrums. But, more importantly, would he care about John's value system? Knowing Sherlock, probably not. He would most possibly laugh, and dismiss it as stupid sentiment. Still....wasn't it worth a try? You only have one brother, even if he's shite at times. And Mycroft had moments that were so far away from shite, that John even felt a little sorry for thinking him such a nuisance at times. When all he ever did was
The doctor sighed, knowing he already lost the argument he was having with the version of Sherlock in his head. Although he didn’t really fancy facing the Yarders in the state he and his daughter were in, he was also aware that it was the only way to get a hold of the lanky brunette detective they both so very much adored. ‘Fine’, he thought. ‘Have it your way. If The Work is your top priority, then I have to insert our family into it.’ With small protests of his bad leg (Thanks, anxiety), John straightened himself and gathered a very quiet, very emotionally exhausted Rosie in his arms. “He is not finished yet” he explained the curly head currently tucked in the crook of his neck. “But we can come visit him, yeah? So, we don’t have to wait until we can see him. We’ll be home together in no time.”
Sherlock still talked when they got out of the cap, still talked while John freshened himself up, changed, and put his jacket on again. Just as he was about to leave the flat, Sherlock paused.
Instead, John pats the right side of the bed gently once he’s climbed under the covers. Sherlock stares at him with the storm still raging in his eyes. But the twinkle is there, too. John can’t keep the unmasked affection from seeping into his voice, when he quietly speaks again: “Come to bed, you daft tit.”
. They even came barefoot to the campground; forgotten all thoughts of upholding a certain appearance. It was a becoming look on them.
Waking up with Sherlock in the room does wonders for his mood. Something about the fact that the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was Sherlock bouncing Rosie, the morning light catching both of their curls made him indescribable happy (he could get used to this).
“It’s just … Sherlock, it’s somehow too much. I don’t know, and I don’t want to bother you, but… and Rosie’s been cranky all day and I just bloody know I’m a bad father, but it still hurts when the prove hits me right in the face and-“
?! The detective had straightened his back again, looking as smug as ever, as if he didn’t just change the rules of the whole fucking universe. Rosie, oblivious to the wonder she had just witnessed, babbled a hurried “Bye Daddy”, eager to get back to her legos, and wriggled out of Sherlock’s hold, ready to start the second princess castle of the day. “I’ll be there in a sec”, the detective whispered into her curls before he put her down and she was off to the livingroom.
John walked over from his casual position in the doorframe, to helpfully fill the detective’s cup. Stupid John. Always being helpful and considerate. This would be a whole lot easier if there wasn’t so much to admire about his blogger.
The doctor sighed and let himself sag heavily against Sherlock, closing his eyes, just breathing in the fresh air. He caught Sherlock’s hands and held them tightly in his own; warm radiating from their palms, making him feel raw and loved and absolutely perfect.
Jonathan practically squeals from the couch. He loves a good sexy bed-sharing arrangement, after all. He says as much. John looks between him and Bobby like somehow he hasn’t gotten an inside joke.
Only 15 minutes after he send the message, the front door softly creaked and hurried steps stumbled up the stairs. John had to close his eyes, because the intensity of the relief he felt when Sherlock unlocked the door to the flat overwhelmed him a little bit.
The thought made John flush with an emotion he couldn’t quite place, so he chose to ignore it. Not as easy to ignore was the way this special attention made him feel. Small. Vulnerable. Loved. Things that did not really fit the image he had of himself; things he normally deny he needed; things he shouldn’t disclose in front of anyone. He was John H. Watson from the British Army. He was a doctor, a safer of lives. Nobody would take him seriously anymore if they knew that the great John Watson sometimes needed to be coddled in order to function. Sherlock most certainly didn’t take him seriously anymore.
Technically, we're finished here. But I plan to add a sickenly-sweet epilog; and perhaps a bonus chapter that only contains smutty moments between those two (because really, who dosn't enjoy some smutty goodness from time to time? >:3).
1) Sherlock tasted like a delicious combination overly sweet coffee and minty toothpaste, a combination that really shouldn’t be so tasty, but oddly enough it was; 2) Sherlock Holmes, his best friend, had just kissed him; 3) John wanted him to do it
“I won’t be long, promise. Just get yourself nice and comfortable, I will be back before you know it”
John opened his eyes, to look down at Sherlock in surprise. Of course, he had thought about it. Or rather… daydreamed about it. It seemed highly unlikely, thinking about Sherlock ever wanting to retire, let alone grow old with ordinary John Watson. Almost impossible. A new surge of affection welled up in his chest.
“What are you talking about? It’s extraordinary” Another adjective for the list Sherlock never would have dreamed to be called. “
Sherlock turned his head to give his best friend a convincing ‘I’m fine’-look, but realized his mistake immediately when he took in the doctor’s appearance.
“I’m not mad anymore” he whispered, pushing his cheek against the nest of hair. “I’m sorry I ignored you”, he added, while rapidly blinking the gathering wetness in his eyes away. He would not become an emotional sod over a heartfelt apology; he would not!
“Gentle breaths, yeah? Everything’s fine” Sherlock had started, as he belatedly and to his annoyance realized, to hyperventilate a little bit.
Antoni- as it is his habit- immediately pulls open the refrigerator door. He is delighted (animatedly talking to the camera) that there are two fridges in this house- “Surely an indicator of immense culinary experimentation”- when he encounters the toes.
The sudden noise of Sherlock’s text alert made them both jump in surprise. The genius fumbled the device hurried out of his trouser pocket, fingers shaking and clumsy, almost dropping it twice. The screen lighting up his pale face and Greg took the moment of distraction to have a deep breath. Sherlock read the message once, twice, three times before the words made sense to him. He let out a long, relieved exhale.
. Genuinely disbelieving that it was possible for another human being to like him, just for being himself. It made a surge of protectiveness well up in the doctor, combined with the urge to punch anybody who had ever hurt this wonderfully odd and oddly wonderful man.
When the Fab 5 plus two camera teams enter this time, he doesn’t even flinch and lets himself be wrapped into several hugs obediently. They radiate the same kind of unwavering energy despite the fact that it’s early in the morning, which John is slightly jealous of. He’s never been a big morning person.
John stared thoughtful into his mug. He wouldn't like the last option. He never liked the idea of Sherlock deleting anything remotely important that happened between them. But, so he decided, he was probably just being romantic again; Sherlock surely deleted a massive amount of data he and his not-genius brain deemed of importance. So, it didn't really matter if it would happen this time (Except it did matter, a hell lot).
“So, anyway, John’s been nominated by his friend, DI Gregory Lestrade, because according to Greg, John’s life is a pretty big mess right now. Ever since his wife Mary has been shot, he’s struggling with adapting to his new role as a single parent- aw man, that’s really sad.”
Still, he let himself be pulled against John without any resistance, and let himself be kissed; warm, and reassuring, and gentle. A kind of kiss that makes you forget, just for a little while, that your life is about to go to shreds.
Mycroft eyed the exchange knowingly, but didn’t comment. John, feeling mildly embarrassed, proceeded to stuff his face with ice-cream.
“I know,” Sherlock answered, pressing his whole body against John’s back, draping a light blanket over both of them.  “Lestrade told me as much.”
While their voices shout over each other, John pats the poor lad’s hand and explains: “That’s the biohazard fridge. Experiments are vital to Sherlock’s line of work and sometimes they tend to be a bit grotesque. The food fridge is over here.”
“I’m not a child” the detective scoffed, but felt his cheeks heat up under the praise he so very dearly graved. He sighed and pushed his fists against his eyelids, suddenly feeling a nervous energy bubble inside of his stomach.
With all of the fussing over Rosie, they don’t notice him at first. When they do, it’s really Jonathan, and he almost squeals. Karamo notices the gleam in his friend’s eyes and know that now, Jonny’s a man on a mission.
Still, that had to be the stupidest thing Sherlock had ever heard, and he was taking Anderson into account. “That’s nonsense. You already keep up with me” Him, leaving John? It wasn’t even worth a consideration as a possible outcome from this scenario. The thought alone was absurd. “I couldn’t” As terrifying as it was to admit it, it was true. “You make me better. You fix the broken parts” Sherlock frowned at the cupcake- almost an emblem for everything that was
John had been stupid enough to believe their romantic entanglement would change the tables. He actually believed that Sherlock would consider his feelings (or anything expect for the suspect for that matter) before he dived head first into careless dangerous situations. They talked about it. John promised Sherlock he wouldn’t have to change for them to work out. Always the consulting detective first, the partner and parent second. BUT he had hoped. He had hoped Sherlock would see. He had hoped Sherlock would understand. They were raising a child together. There was so much to lose. Something worth being careful about, something worth to not carelessly play with your own life. He had hoped and he had been proven wrong.
“No, Sherlock. Now you listen to ME!” The younger man pressed his lips in a thin line. He’d rather die than admit it, but he dreaded the feeling of John’s anger. It made him strangely…. Anxious? He couldn’t remember being anxious since he had been a child.
Instead of prolonging the conversation, he pulled his insufferable madman to lay down with him and proceeded to snog the living daylights out of him. Sherlock, although a little surprised, welcomed this change of events eagerly.
He made eye-contact with Lestrade and whispered: “Stay back, please. He’s having a panic attack.”, because John hated to be crowded during a panic attack, only Sherlock’s closeness was tolerated,
” his voice cracked at the last syllable, betraying his state of emotional turmoil. Sherlock never cried in front of anyone. But in that moment, he came pretty damn close.
“I could keep bees” he continued, cursing himself for rambling, but unable to stop the embarrassing stream of words to escape his lips. “You could write mystery novels”.
"Let me offer you a last piece of advice" He addressed the crying woman, who clung to her husband's frame like a drowning person would cling to a lifeguard. "A team of medics will arrive shortly-" the husband was about to rise his voice again, but John discreetly ignored him- "Get her tested. Let them help her. For her own sake. I'm terribly sorry"
This isn’t a sexual crisis, John sternly tells himself. It is a ridiculous thing to have a crisis over
"Drink" the John in question ordered without rigidity. Sherlock looked at him, insecurity still written all over his features. The doctor held his gaze persistent. He understood that Sherlock must be exhausted from feeling so many suppressed emotions and confused by most of them, but to figure this new situation out, the genius brain needed to be hydrated. Sherlock's hand flexed uncertain on his knee, jerking forward a bit as if he wanted to reach out for John, but was too embarrassed to do so. John understood that not only wanting but initiating physical contact was another completely new experience for the detective, but he was still more concerned about Sherlock's health. He nodded in the direction of the mug, and Sherlock huffed (a little more like himself), but nodded and reached for the tea.
John did pretend to not notice (of course he noticed); and later when they laid on the couch to indulge in some crap telly, John ignored the subtle shuffling beside him, until suddenly a forehead nudged against his thigh. The doctor looked down amused, watching Sherlock’s oblivious façade and persistent nudging for some minutes.
And it is hours later, when he wakes and finds Sherlock is still right where he was when they both slipped into a nervous slumber. He stares at the long elegant arch of Sherlock’s back and shoulders, listens to the quiet hums leaving his best friend’s lips.
It’s enough that he’ll be portrayed as a sad old looser on a Netflix show, better not add ‘insane’ to the list.
And just like that, a certain sense of anxiety crept up on him again- not the crushing, but the lingering kind- that caused his stomach to do flips, and a tremor crept into his fingers.
He tries not to dwell too much on why this might be the case, not with Antoni there with him; Antoni who saw him getting flustered when Sherlock smirked at him yesterday. No need to feed into the fantasy…
… Sherlock?” The detective just smiled, with a devious boyish charm that made him look so much younger, so much more
Mycroft was a strong connection to Euros, he was the link between the estranged siblings all those years without Sherlock being aware of it. He had made a lot of mistakes, a hell lot of mistakes. But, John had to give it to him, he always had been reliable. More than once and more than only frequent they had relied solely on Mycroft to somehow get them out of the trouble Sherlock managed to dive in head first. Despite his bullshit talk about affections (a matter so foreign to bother Holmes brothers as rocket science to him), he had proofed more than once that he cared about Sherlock. And for fuck's sake, they were
"I have to hang up now" John mumbled, while he combed his fingers through the wild nest of hair affectionately. "See you in a bit".
“Really, Sherlock? Really? Fine. You were doing fucking fine…” He took a deep breath, willing his temper to calm down the slightest bit. Screaming at the younger man wouldn’t change a thing. John had the habit of getting loud rather quickly, Sherlock was used to this vocal outburst of tempter. John wanted to give him something he wasn’t ready for, something to get through his thick scull. When the blogger spoke again, his voice was quiet, but deadly. An involuntary shiver ripped through Sherlock’s body.
normal for John, that he was just being nice, because Sherlock had been having hard time, that all of this didn’t
for John. The problem was his fault. It was only fair that the solution was his doing as well. All this time he spent moaning over why John would never be in love with him, could have been invested in actually giving John something about him to love. He shouldn’t have left John alone with it. He wouldn’t leave John alone with it, anymore.
Behind John, people begin to shout excitedly upon seeing his flat mate (something about touching “those curls, honey!!!”) and the doctor shoots his friend the most apologetic look he can muster.
“Is there still a free spot in your crew, captain?” He was addressing Rosie but didn’t miss the twinkle in his little brother’s eyes, the twinkle that used to be there whenever a very busy Mycroft agreed to play with him, all these years ago. It were some of the most treasured memories they both shared. The thought of getting to relive them now, share them with Rosie, whom they loved desperately, was enough for Mycroft to forget that he was supposed to be the British government, when he toed off his shoes, rolled up his trouser legs and stepped into the cold water (with a small, dignified squeak).
Clearly it was the first show of affection in ages, if Mycroft’s rigid posture and comically wideness eyes were anything to go by.
A sharp cry. Located next to Lestrade, belonging to a 10-year-old boy. Sherlock forced his head to turn to the left. His breath hitched at the sight. The way the young officer held the devastated child back was sickly familiar. Her brother, obviously, the kin was undeniably for the eye. As well as the signs of physical violence (Sherlock felt like he should sit down). "Don't" the boy begged, voice hoarse with an ugly mixture of tears and mucus. "She doesn’t mean it, she just doesn’t know...please don't take her away!" (He felt dizzy). He struggled against the strong arms, but it was no use, his exhausted muscles couldn't compete to the steady grip-
"God... I love you," he whispered in broken awe, laying Holmes back down against the settee with gentle hands and pulling away his shirt to inspect the wound on his shoulder. It was beginning to heal already, flesh closing up on itself, and new skin beginning to grow.
A small smile – perhaps even a genuine one – pushed at the corner of the doctor’s mouth. “That is quite remarkable,” he said, the barest hint of admiration in his voice.
That did the trick and Watson gave in, letting Holmes have his way, which involved a good deal more kissing. They passed several engrossing minutes or so in that manner, and then Holmes stopped rather abruptly.
"Yes, thank you,” he replied as he felt the worst of the pain begin to drain away. His eyes were drawn again to Watson’s hands as he stowed away the syringe.  Holmes found Watson’s hands fascinating. Nimble enough for the most delicate surgeries, strong enough to bend metal like clay... “It seems this case is nearly at an end,” he heard himself say. “I assume you will not wish to stay here; wooden houses burn entirely too easily to ensure your safe slumber through the day."
"Yes, one of Lestrade cold cases from a number of years back. Had strange bite marks all over the body, wasn't from an animal, definitely human, just with what seemed to be extended canines".
John asked about it and I merely brushed it off as a scratch from a bush I was running through the night before. The following days I complained about the sunlight and hid in my room during the daylight hours. During one of these evenings, I stopped by a costume shop to pick up some red contact lenses while John was working a night shift.
“I...I feel like I'm drowning, I guess. But not necessarily in a bad way... If that makes sense?” He tried to explain.
"So, you're looking to do what...put on some teeth and find a willing subject to experiment on?" he laughed
John walked over to Sherlock, crowding him up against the nearest wall, staring into his eyes. John caught his wrists and pinned them near his head. Sherlock gasped and arched into him. Just as John thought, that shirt rode up high on his stomach with his arms raised. With one hand strong enough to hold Sherlock’s wrists in place, his other hand now skimmed the pale flesh now revealed to him.
“She’s already here. One floor up, making her way down here” Her hands going up to his neck “I’m going to need you to relax Lestrade, I’ll need to make a show for Ciri. Do I have your consent to bite you?”
As Cereza attached a copy of the pin to Sherlock’s jacket, she leaned in and whispered “You take care of him Sherlock Holmes, or you’ll have me to answer to” and she leaned back and gave him a wink. John looked down and smiled hearing her warning. Finally, she approached John to attach his pin as well to the lapel of his suit jacket.
"You must be Dr. Watson" an irish lilt in his voice. "Didn't know that you played for our team nowadays, must have been a recent development, hmm?" He grinned. With a snap of his fingers, he appeared directly in front of him. John moved back but he grabbed the lapels of his jacket and kept him there. He ran his fingers over the bumblebee pin "Ah, I see you've already been claimed. Shame."
Good, this should buy me a little more time. Taking a deep breath, I opened my eye and put in the bright red contact lenses. I admit they were quite striking once I blinked them into place.
A few hours later, a little after sunset, Sherlock excused himself to his bedroom to go get changed for the undercover stakeout at the next nightclub. As Sherlock busied himself, John paced by the window, fiddling with his new phone. He decided to text Cereza to check-in.
Good. I’ll swing by the flat in a few minutes. I’m also having your new clothes sent to Baker Street as well. Should be there sometime tomorrow - C
"Well then.." clicking his tongue "...perhaps I've intruded enough this evening" reaching into his suit jacket he pulled out a business card and handed it over to Cereza "I'll be staying here the next couple days, mobile number's there as well."
Ciri quirked an eyebrow “What do you want to know?” she said with a sigh, raking her gaze over Lestrade once more as he walked away.
Clearing his voice and adjusting his suit "Seems someone has gone rogue and started to turn and kill whomever they choose. I haven't been able to hunt them down myself. I heard London was experiencing something similar, so I thought why not pay Holmes a visit?"
John looked up to meet his eyes and leaned in for a quick kiss “I know” he smiled. With Sherlock in hand, they left the flat making their way out to the black sedan waiting for them.
“You two gentlemen” pointing to Sherlock and Lestrade “Will be my escorts for the evening. John will be up top on the roof keeping an eye on the alleyways and side streets next to the club.”
Moriarty glanced at him "Oh my, now isn't this interesting" grinning widely. "I wasn't referring to you Sherlock dear, although we MUST discuss the death of my last living descendant, the word is; you were partly responsible for that".
"It seems we have a common enemy, my dear. I simply came to chat" bringing his hands up in surrender.
“Oh my god,” Lestrade breathed and went over to the woman “Are you alright?”. She smiled at him “I will be if you help me” she stammered.
"Humor me. What do you know about vampires?" I turned towards him, crossing my legs and clasping my hands together.
He stared back at me. "Oh...OH!.." he narrowed his eyes "...oh. Umm...well.." he cleared his throat  "Compared to other things that you've used me as a guinea pig before, I suppose this one... isn't....so bad. I...uhh..I'm going to go for a walk now" he got up and grabbed his coat and quickly walked out the door.
After his team eventually found him, he quickly had to come up with a convincing story about how his suspect ended up with a snapped neck. After a few days of recovery, he called the number on the card, with the woman showing up at his flat not a few moments later.
“Well, well, well” a voice appeared in front of them “New toy, Cereza? You did always have good...taste”. A woman in her early thirties appeared, dressed in a low-cut, skin-tight, black lace dress. One side of her head was shaved, the other in braids.
Lestrade had texted me earlier and I informed him John and I would be around just after dark. I spent the day in my Mind Palace filing away important information and deleting others. The alarm on my phone went off an hour before John was set to arrive home, so I gathered my materials and went into the loo to attach the canine extenders. With a little bit of spirit gum and some wiggling into place, the extenders sat rather comfortably. As I checked them in the mirror, I imagine the fake teeth on John and suddenly I realized what the appeal had been. Why John acted the way he initially did.
“Anything that seems out of place to be honest. I know your normal senses will be dulled in a setting like this, but as a genius and Detective Inspector, one would assume you would notice anything...off. I also brought some earpieces & mics for everyone so we can keep in contact” handing out the devices to everyone “courtesy of Big Brother, obviously”.
“So, how do I look?” came Sherlock’s voice entering the living room. John turned and he gaped at what he saw. Sherlock was no longer in his standard suit attire. He was wearing a tight black v-neck shirt that barely brushed the top of his low riding jeans, chucks, and a leather jacket; his hair artfully tousled.
Lestrade looked her in the eyes and dipped his head in for a kiss. It was slow and languid, Lestrade took a deep breath in through his nose and kissed deeper. His tongue sliding across her lips. She sighed into the Detective’s mouth remembering the last time she had a taste of him. She released his mouth and moved down his jaw to his neck. Running her tongue along his pulse point, she felt him squirm in her lap. She bit down gently and took a deep pull.
“Well, as slippery as your mind is, I must ask you why you are here” She sat down beside Cereza “...and if you might be willing to share, you know for old times sake” gesturing to Lestrade.
I did my best to make a low growling noise and heard John gasp in response “I’ll… I’ll be in my room if you need me…” he stammered, but I heard the lust in his husky voice.
Sherlock scanned the crowd and noted all the entrances and exits. The killer would most likely be taking their victim out a side door into the alley. As he scanned the crowd he was startled to see two sets of eyes reflected back at him, the same as Cereza’s had when dropping off John’s letter. He spoke into his mic hidden in his jacket and relayed the information.
When he had left in the mornings, I repaired to the University, where, thanks to Mycroft’s interceding for me, I was given free rein in the Advocates’ Library. I had long been interested in the older languages of the islands which we inhabited, and how the successive waves of invasion had shaped and changed them. During my childhood in Cornwall, it had amused me to listen to the soft tones of the local folks, and even more to the elderly people who spoke the original language of the country - Kernowek, a tongue akin to Breton and Welsh. It derived, I understood, from the Brythonic dialect, which, with Goidelic, had been one of the two languages of the islands before the Caesars came to straighten our narrow roads and replace our huts with their forts. Goidelic, of course, had developed into Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and the declining tongue of Gaelg spoken on the Isle of Man. I pored for hours over dusty manuscripts, finding in works such as Isidore’s comments on the Maxims of St John Damascene (written in Latin and glossed in Gaelic) and the Book of the Dean of Lismore, ample evidence of the development and divergence of the two branches of language from their original Insular Celtic. An exceedingly useful ‘Galick and English Vocabulary’, a rare and delicate printed book dating from 1741, which had been compiled by the Jacobite poet Alasdair MacMhaighstir (or Alexander Macdonald, as the English form runs) for the use of charity schools, was a source of much delight to me: I committed as many pages to memory as I could.
‘You speak as if you were some wise greybeard,’ I protested. ‘We are not so very far apart in age, are we?’
He tucked my hand in his arm, and drew me close. ‘You do not know my company smiles,’ he said, quietly, ‘because I do not offer company manners to you, who are my true friend and noble Damon. When I smile at you it is with both affection and respect, my dear fellow: it is not a mere socially mandated rictus, offered out of  form. So do not suspect me of beginning to intrigue with the honourable Miss Holder, I beg of you. I do not dislike women, it is true: I do in fact relish both their company and their conversation – as I do men’s -  if they are reasonable people, and not vapid or silly. But I have no desire for more of their company than will serve to while away a pleasant half-hour, or to do them an honest service. And on this occasion, I was doing you an honest service, my dear friend. I do not know what is afoot, but I can tell you Miss Mary is not so distraught about her uncle’s grief, as she is about her cousin’s likely trial for theft. She is desperate for him to be let off. She is both fearful and guilt stricken . . . and I wonder, myself, why that should be. She cannot meet one’s eye and appear at all composed over the case, her agitation is excessive, and when she looks at poor Mr Holder, she flinches.’
"As long as he is by your side, you will never know," it said, in a pointed, Italianate hand. "when the next blow will fall. It would be better for him if you had never met him, would it not?"
‘I believe it is another trap.’ Lestrade’s voice was tight. ‘And I will not take action upon something as foul as an anonymous letter, to spring a trap of another’s device and setting. I am no puppet to have my strings tugged by a man who wishes you ill.’ He offered the paper to Watson. ‘I am ashamed that I must show you this, Doctor, but I believe I should.’
then so should the male be in the interests of simple equity, before frowning and adding that he saw little difference between these female bodies exposed for sale and those of London’s youth, both being equally a disgrace.
It was not long before he had transported all our boxes into the little hall where I was standing, engaged in contemplating the curious bubbles in the thick glass pane in the door. He led me to the sofa drawn up before a blazing fire in what I took to be the parlour, and made me lie down. Blankets appeared as if from nowhere, and divested of my outer garments and shoes, my tie loosened and removed, and my cold feet in new woollen socks, I reclined, if not at ease in my mind, at least comfortable in body. He bustled around quietly while I lay, gazing into the fire, musing idly upon the chemistry of the flames dancing in the grate. It was a driftwood fire: streaks of blue and lavender mingled with the gold. I could have watched for hours, resting there almost in a state of catatonia. When Watson came in and handed me a cup of soup I would have waved it away, but he compelled me to drink, and when I had finished, smoothed my hair with his hand, and covered me close with the blanket, telling me that he would leave me there to sleep. It seemed to me that this would not do, so I held his hand and begged him to stay with me.
Dear Watson. He told her it was a capital idea, and his hand went into his pocket book, returning with a sovereign I knew he could yet ill afford. ‘For the little ones,’ he urged her, when she would have demurred at taking it. ‘See that they are warmly clad, with a gift or two and a shilling, and come to me for more, if you have need. I have not had a real Christmas in England for some years – at least, not one that bids so fair to be happy,’ he added, glancing around our sanctum. ‘Let us spread a little joy, Mrs Hudson, and remember how old Scrooge came to his senses with the ghosts. He was in the right of it in the end, and so let us be too, for it takes little enough to make a child happy, as he did with Cratchit’s children. Now, Holmes, give me but five minutes, and as I said, I am your man. And take that experiment downstairs now, there’s a good chap, then I will help you secure it against the weather later, when we return.’
‘Most vilely.’ I went willingly into his embrace. I did have a headache, but not for the reasons he thought. ‘So we care little for the laws of God; we are not believers, so we will not follow them. What of the laws of man? What of those, Watson? What of the new law?’
‘No, in a word.’ He came to perch on the sofa, and I made room. ‘We can hold up a candle against the darkness, and that is all. But we can do it together, my dear Holmes. Now, what of this case?’
Forgive me for the two month delay. I wasn’t uncommitted: I was unable (emotionally: I think my mother’s death caught up with me a bit)!
‘Is not that the point of the story, Watson? Monte Cristo has pursued revenge to the exception of all else, he has arrogated to himself the mantle of godhood, he presumes to act as the deity in working out his revenge. He wished to punish those who injured him: his enemy de Villefort most of all, only to find that the cherished son of the only family he intended to reward had fallen in love with de Villefort’s daughter. His plans are thrown awry, he will save – he does save - Valentine, but he cannot deviate from the game he plays. He will not, rather. And it is in this that he fails, it is in this that he becomes less than a hero. He shows the inhumanity of which he is capable, and we see revealed in full his arrogance, his conceit, his selfish disdain for the feelings of others. It is well done. It is extremely well done.’
‘ – I recognised an incoherence in you, yes. It was what gave me first to wonder, for you seemed – outside yourself in a way I had not seen before, and you had injured yourself without realising it, which is always a cause for concern. I communicated therefore, with Freud, with what result you know.’
I went on, more cautiously now. ‘Your brother took to drink, as we discussed. He would not have done so had he been happy; therefore he was not happy. Perhaps he disappointed as a son, or was disappointed. Often sons and fathers – there can be problems. He did not go into the army like you, but into business, and he struggled to succeed. You, on the contrary, went into the army. Your father was an army man, in a Northern regiment?’
'I have lost count of how many children bear your name, in one form or another, but I swear it must be more than half a hundred by now. This is becoming an expensive business, my dear fellow.' I handed over two more sovereigns. 'One of these for the burial of the little one who died, and for a few extra swaddling clouts, or whatever it is one wraps these small things in, for the living child, and then you might expend the rest on anything the unfortunate parents need. Ah no, no, do not turn away, do not hide from me. There is no shame in your grief, my dear. Come to me for comfort, John, do not remain at a distance.'
‘It suited me to play with him a little.’ I stretched out a hand to him. ‘I did not like the man: he looked impertinently at me, when I would not immediately tell him the solution to his problem, and looked impertinently at you too, as if wondering what you did there with me. I do not choose that any should misprise you. If they would have Holmes, they must have Watson too. But sit down for God’s sake, John, our visitors are gone, the room is as neat as a pin now, and there is nothing more to tidy. Sit with me.’
‘And do you not?’ My eyes were closed; the rhythm of the wheels pounded in my head. My belly roiled. ‘What do you believe? Is there nothing after? Or is there heaven for such as want it, long for it, and hell for sinners?’
‘It would be an honour to hear anything you wish to tell me: how should it not be, when I have laid all of my bitter troubles bare to you? Stay, I shall mend the fire a little – it strikes cold in the late evening in these great, high-ceilinged rooms – and pour us a glass of that light summer wine. Shall we sit together, Holmes, or would you prefer to sit alone?’
‘You know, Doctor Watson, I was extremely sorry not to see you at my astronomy lectures: I quite thought you had promised to attend. Indeed I was certain of obtaining a new recruit to our admittedly somewhat esoteric field of study - heavenly bodies, my dear Doctor, such heavenly bodies: the worship, as I said, of the celestial Urania. Perhaps I could take this opportunity to persuade you once more to join our little band of like-minded comrades: we hope on Saturday next to investigate Ganymede, that noted satellite of Jupiter.’
‘Holmes,’ he reproved me, sleepily, and I jumped and bit my tongue. ‘I can feel you staring at my scar. I beg you will desist; it is ugly, and I am not proud of it.’
‘The poor young doctor,’ she said to me compassionately, as I arrived home one brisk morning after an early walk. ‘He’s not eaten enough to keep a bird alive, not yesterday nor today, and there he is asleep in his chair again, for all the world like a tired child. Should he not see a physician, Mr Holmes, even though he is one himself? And should he not sleep on the sofa, instead of that hard armchair?’
I am John’s man, though we never come to it in the end, and he must be mine. Mycroft, it is a generous offer, and I thank you for your care of me – but I must, I must decline. I cannot give up so much of present good for fear of future evil.’
We rambled around for two hours, not in our wonted silence, but with Watson throwing a constant barrage of questions and suppositions at me. Did but I pass an object or person of interest by without comment, he would utter a ridiculous ‘deduction’ of such implausible derivation that I was compelled time and time again to correct him (which he took, I have to say, in very good part). What he was doing of course, was to create an artificial excitation of the mind for me, and I was grateful for his efforts, although I knew it would not completely serve his purpose.
