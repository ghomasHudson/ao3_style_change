Waiting does nothing to calm his nerves, anticipation gnaws on his brain. What if he doesn’t like this doctor or what if something goes wrong with the procedure? He isn’t scared of the pain, he made peace with that demon at war. It isn’t the idea of a foreign object either, he could feel the implant.
At the end of a curved, tree covered driveway stood a log cabin surrounded by a large lake. The house had a long wrap around porch with old timey rocking chairs. If they ever left the bed, Toni was sure she would find Steve on the porch sketching everything in sight.
The final trial was during his monthly confessional Tony brought up a recent one night stand, retelling the event in agonizing detail from the lust he felt when he saw her across at the party to the mortal sin of fucking her that night. This was a two part test on his part, the first time he focused more on his partner; her beauty, what she liked, his lust for her. Then the second he gave more detail around his experience; what she did to him, his lust, and his pleasure. Both were much more detailed than necessary for a purging of sin, but it helped gauge Steve’s reaction. How much did he squirm, did his pants tent more after the second, did he breath heavier?
Like usual, after service Tony and Steve discarded the ceremonial robes after the last members left. He thought he imagined it, the first time he caught Father Rogers looking at his ass. He wouldn’t, he was a man of the cloth, didn’t Holy fathers take a vow of chastity? If he was looking at anyone it would be a woman, not another man. Was he still high from Friday night? Were all the drugs finally rotting his brain? Then it happened again, while Tony was picking up a dropped pamphlet. Okay this time he wasn’t making that up. That had to have been a look.
Steve nods at this, “I went into the Army at 18. I had 3 implants while serving” Dr. Stark takes notes while Steve talks, which makes him more nervous about what he is saying, “I had the last one removed over a year ago. My regular doctor recommended that I stay off of it for a while since I hadn’t had a heat in 9 years.”
Steve, kind and considerate Steve, always took the time to get her off first or early on, even when they were in a rush. Toni asked him about it once and he said it was hard for him to get pleasure thinking that her needs weren’t fulfilled. She tried to tell him that getting fucked by a grade A stud was enough to fulfill her needs, but he insisted that it wasn’t right for Steve to come multiple times and Toni got none. Who was she to argue?
Steve covered her limp form with his own hulking mass, kissing at any expanse of skin he could find until he made his way to her lips. They kissed for a while, getting lost in the pull of lips and tongues, but eventually Steve erection made itself known, demanding a warm place to land.
Tony was distracted, he was singing and wouldn’t be paying attention to what was behind him. The walk in shower was to the right of the doorway and the vanity dead ahead. Tony wouldn’t be able to see him through the tiled wall that separated the shower from the rest of the bathroom and if Tony did finish, then Steve would hear the water turn off and have 5 seconds to get out. All he had to do was walk a straight line in and then out. Master tactician.
The fingers speed up, “Are you baby? Are you going to come on my cock? Just like that, keep squeezing that pussy. Fuck!”
Steve pulled back his arm and let it go with a resound splat. Now Tony had a handprint on the left cheek to match the right. Steve had left his mark, staked his claim over Tony Stark. Who wasn’t tough enough now?
Dr. Cho had recommended a few treatment plans that could help remedy the issues with Toni’s uterus. There has been tons of drugs, time in the cradle, even holistic approaches. Anything that could help and Steve didn’t have to know about. But it seemed like none of that was working, there was no improvement.
Sarah Rogers instilled a health appreciation of the medical field from the time Steve was born. When he wasn’t there for a doctor’s visit, he was drawing in the breakroom and playing with his friends on the children’s ward.
The pained noise sounded like it was ripped from Tony’s chest absentmindedly. “That’s all you have to say? I just confessed that I’m basically addicted to you and that’s your reaction. Nevermind, it doesn’t matter.” Tony stood and marched to the door, “This was the last time, we’re done here. Pepper’s starting to get suspicious and I can’t lose her or Morgan. I can’t lose the best thing that’s ever happened to me, especially not because of you.”
How had enough time passed for Howard to get married, have a kid, and he still looked older than Steve? The peppering of a few silver strands and laugh lines gave him this air of authority, of experience, that sent jolts of electricity through Steve’s body. He may know what this feeling is, lust, but he has no idea what to do with it in this strange, modern world. Maybe that’s why Steve pulls Tony’s pigtails, just to see him get riled up.
Tony itched to run his fingers through Steve’s hair, comb the golden locks out of his face and watch as those pink lips encased his length. It took every ounce of self control he had to not thrust into the warmth, he wanted Steve to go at his own pace, make sure they both enjoyed this. What could be their first and only time together.
“Hi Steve. I’m Dr. Tony Stark,” greets the alpha. Steve knows he is alpha even through the required scent blockers. It must be in the way he carries himself or how the scent of alpha lingers on his clothes. He offers his hand to Steve to shake and Steve’s cock immediately takes interest through the paper sheet.
After service, Father Rogers would discard the robe and turn into “just Steve”. He’d tell Tony stories about his life and travels while they cleaned and in return Tony would ramble about his latest creations and the woses of university life. That’s how it continued until Tony caught Steve staring at his ass in some sinfully tight pants one afternoon.
Steve released his hold on Tony’s hip to reach around and give his cock some relief. But the length he found was completely soft, any previous pleasure had disappeared. That’s fine, Tony didn’t always get off on anal, typically Steve would blow him after to help him find release. However, Tony must have looked down and noticed that the hand around his cock was foreign.
First thing he notices is that lights are softer in the office than the hard fluorescent lights throughout the rest of the hospital. Vases of fake flowers decorate the end tables next to plushy chairs in an immaculate waiting area. It’s a shocking contrast to the hard, wooden chairs and empty surfaces that litter the ER waiting room.
The thin digit starts to retreat after a few inches before filling him up once again, a gentle rhythm of in and out until Steve is relaxed enough to loosen. Soon a second finger joins the first and Steve sees fireworks behind his eyes. This is the most pleasure he has ever had from his body, nothing with a partner has amounted to this much gratification.
Steve debated sending Tony a quick text, asking if it was ok before just walking into Tony’s space. But they had left everything on good terms, Tony even said that if Steve ever needed anything to not hesitate. Beside it was almost noon now, Tony was probably at SI or in the workshop and would be none the wiser to Steve’s quick trip. He’d be in and out before even JARVIS would know.
Tony shook his head, “Have J swing by in an hour or so. Got a few things left to finish here. If that’s good with you, Steve?” It was never an issue, but he wanted to make sure they’d have some time alone.
Quickly Steve stripped of the shirt and sweatpants he wore to retrieve the forgotten kit. He stepped into the warm steam that spilled through the entrance, chasing away the chill and honing in his mind. The marks were worse upon closer inspection, some breaking skin and leaving dried blood behind. There were fingerprint bruises along Tony’s hips that were still developing from a sickly yellow shade. If Tony wanted rough, then Steve was going to give it to him.
Toni reached between them to guide the burning rod inside, Steve’s strength being dedicated to holding himself up above her. It pushed through the mess of come and juice until it rested all the way in, meeting her cervix. For the moment, that’s all that happened, Steve’s cock just resting inside her while they lost themselves in kisses.
The wistful look on Steve’s face was probably Toni's favorite, the soft smile and far off eyes. It was so rare that he could let the world slip off his shoulders, even just for a few minutes. What she wouldn’t give to keep Steve this happy forever.
Toni chuckled as she wrapped her arms around Steve’s neck, “I think it’s going to be a while before the baby can play on a swing set. First there has to be a baby, so why don’t we make our way back upstairs and get started on that.” She started trailing kisses along his jaw up to his ear, licking at the sensitive spot behind it.
Her bra came off next, revealing olive toned breast with dusty pink, pinpoint nipples. Toni has never had large breasts, especially after the arc reactor took up residence on her chest. While never one to be embarrassed by her body, self consciousness started to seep since Afghanistan. There are scars that marr tender tissue and slightly lopsided boobs due to the housing unit.
Tony pulls at the stethoscope around his neck. “I’m going to listen to your stomach real fast and then we’ll move on.” Fuck. Will Tony notice his dick tenting the sheet? Either way he will be in the region soon and see the humiliation that he can’t hide. Steve lifts his head to see how noticeable the bulge is, but is distracted by Tony leaning over his stomach mere inches from the throbbing pole. His imagination runs wild at the site before him, images of the gorgeous god before him leaning down to swallow the hardening length swim in Steve’s vision.
Steve had two options as he saw it, either run out of the bathroom with his now collected treasure or let Tony know he was there. If he tucked and ran, Tony would ask JARVIS who was there and he would be pissed. Option two, he told Tony he was in there, he could explain the situation and maybe Tony would go easy on him. If he kept it really casual, made it seem like it was normal, maybe he could defuse the situation. Normal for Steve to break into his ex’s bathroom while they were in the shower. Another SHIELD tactic, thank you Nick Fury.
He lets out a small chuckle, “Sorry, having sex with other people. But I think this other person wants me too.”
Maria kissed him on the cheek and gave Father Rogers one last hug before filing out. They fell into their usual routine after Mass, cleaning the church and chatting about their weeks. Steve asked how Tony felt about moving to California to start at his father’s company and Tony countered with questions about the Dodgers season just to see Steve get worked up.
“Before we get started with the insertion, I’d like to go over some things.” Dr. Stark pulls up the forms Steve filled out on his tablet, “Let’s start with your medical history. You’ve had asthma, high blood pressure, heart palpitations, anxiety. Family history of cancer, diabetes, and heart attacks. My first question is how did you make it into the army?”
“Father Rogers, we are going to miss you so much. I can’t repay all that you’ve done for our family, for Tony, over the years.” Maria was praising Steve again, her hand resting on his arm. If Tony didn’t know any better he would say that mother and son had the same taste in men.
“Understand?” Tony said again, expecting an answer. When Steve remained quiet, “I guess that’s how it’s going to be today then, huh?” was all he got before Tony’s palm slapped against his ass. Heat bloomed where the hand landed, sparks shot up his spine, this waks the good stuff.
The first time Steve realized he liked older men was when he was eight. A couple in their late twenties had recently moved in a few doors down from him and Ma, the wife was a dressmaker and he worked at the shipping docks. He had a kind smile, but the hard labor took a toll on his body, leaving him with premature rough hands and lean muscles. Steve and Bucky would sit on the steps most days, since Steve couldn’t go any farther with his asthma, and he would look forward to seeing the husband come home caked in sweat and dirt, wearing a beat up tank top and cap. Then he would go in, kiss his wife, and the routine would start again. Steve didn’t understand the heat that filled his gut at this age.
Tony snorted, “Yeah, I’m a real saint. It’s not like my motivations are pure here. I’m just as fucked up as you, just a different kind.”
Toni’s morning had consisted of a leg-quivering orgasm, decadent waffles, and long hot shower. In that order. A stark contrast to most mornings where it was a race to get the day started; wake up, inhale coffee, run out the door late with a quick kiss good bye. But today, they had nothing but time.
“Steve? Steve is that y-what the fuck do you think you’re doing? Get off of me, you fucker. You fucking bastard.”
Second time was while stationed in London after Project Rebirth. He met Jack Kenley, a Colonel in the British Armed Service, after a joint mission between both countries. Jack had been drafted into the Great War in January of ‘18 at 19 and ended up making a career out of his service. Steve was older this time, he knew what the feeling was he got when Jack would give him a smirk in the mess. This feeling led to several wonderful nights of exploration in dingy barracks and back rooms. Jack was older, wiser, and spent most of his life surrounded by men, so of course Steve would have been drawn to him. Steve always did know how to find danger.
“You saw me take it out of the fridge, that makes no sense.” It might have not been logical, but it brought a silly smile to Steve’s face so it made sense to her. She’d do anything to put a smile on Steve’s face. “It’s almost done. God, you’re impatient.”
Steve chokes as Dr. Stark’s fingers firmly press around his nipple, it feels like there is a line of nerves that run from his nipple to his cock. The more pressure applied to his sensitive nub, the harder his cock gets until he is sporting a semi beneath the paper sheet. He prays that he doesn’t go fully hard during the rest of the exam.
“Are we dating? Clint mentioned that what we do classifies as dating nowadays. The dinners and the art museum and all the time we spend together.”
Steve made an affirmative noise through the wall. “Perfect, baby. Can you touch yourself for me?” Another positive noise, Steve must be too shy over this to use his voice. “Okay. Suck the tip and keep touching yourself ‘til you come.”
Tony started making excuses to not come home on weekends just to avoid Sundays, blaming big tests or important projects for his absence. That was until Father MacKenzie retired and was replaced by the recently indoctored Steve Rogers.
“You ok, baby?” Steve asked, fingers gently stroking the curve to her abdomen as she came down against his chest. This is his favorite part, everytime. He’ll cherish her dissented stomach for the next 30 minutes while whispering declarations of love, she doesn’t know if they are for her or the bump. Then when she can’t stand it much longer, he’ll help her to the bathroom and have a washcloth ready to clean up.
The stethoscope retreats and Tony stands up again, “All good there. Let me grab a tray then we’ll get you in the stirrups.” Steve lets out a shaky breath and wills, begs, prays that his erection will flag before this doctor puts his hands on it. If not, he might go off like a bottle rocket.
Steve was confused. Why do this if it wasn’t to help Steve with his demented desire? Tony was the only one who knew what Steve needed, knew the burden he hid away. “I don’t understand.”
They don’t see each other again until they join forces to track down Loki’s scepter, stolen by Hydra. After breaking most of D.C, Steve takes Tony up on the offer to move into the tower while they hunt down the lost items. Somewhere in that time, they grow close, the first flames of love blooming between them as the months drag on. Their first big fight in this new territory was Ultron, but that only brought them closer together, clinging to the ‘what if’ of losing one another. This love grew like a wildfire.
Lips joined the tongue in pursuit of more slick until they found her opening. Together the muscles sucked and licked in harmony until all the juice was gone from the opening, then fingers made an entrance. Fingers could coax out more ambrosia by teasing the spot inside. Lips sought out the external joy spot, a red hot button of sensation that would provide the ultimate treat.
Steve leaned forwards until lips met her fingers, leaving wet kisses against quivering muscles that flowed upwards, “It’ll only take a couple of loads for this to grow, baby. You’ll be real full then, won’t you.” he teased. Toni moaned wantonly in response.
Steve softly pushed the door until it was wide enough to slip through silently, all the SHIELD training leading to this moment. His soft steps were drowned out by the water blasting against tiles. The drawer softly clicked open and Steve held his breath, thinking Tony heard that, but nonetheless he was still safe and the kit sat in the same place it always had.
Tony and Steve had called it quits after three years of dating and two living in the penthouse together. They had tried to make it work, they really did, but individually they had too many issues that prevented them from truly being together. The split was amicable, both knowing that someday they might find their way back together once they had healed their broken pieces. They left it as friends.
“Well, that’s good, but let’s not try for that today.” The warmth of Tony’s smile settles the fire in his veins. That smile could make the sun shine on a cloudy day and that smile, at least for right now, is only for him. “Let me know if you have any discomfort.”
Steve caught his eye through the thin metal, his pupils blow wide and mouth gaped. A small, minute nod later and Tony is working the screws of the grate. A few weeks ago he loosened them, to make this part easier. A few turns and the cage is being set free.
It takes a few deep breaths and picturing his third grade teacher naked to guarantee he doesn’t come right there, “N-no Tony.”
That must have spurred Steve on, because the pace picked up, that being the only encouragement he needed. “Steve, baby, that feels so good. You feel amazing on my dick.”
His cock strains from the dual sensation of his balls being tugged apart and massaged. Just knowing that Tony couldn’t have missed the twitch sends shame coursing through his veins. Tony can see how much his touch is affecting Steve, how out of control this omega is. But Tony does nothing but flash Steve a reassuring grin over the paper sheet between them.
Steve slowly sits up on the table, using the tattered remains of the gown to maintain some shred of decency in this humiliating situation. Dr. Stark must do this with all his nervous patients. How stupid is Steve for thinking this was unique? He must have made Dr. Stark uncomfortable when he came calling his name.
Toni wiped away the stray tears, Steve would wonder why she was crying. He couldn’t know, it would kill him to know that his dream of a family would never happen. Sarah Rogers wanted 10 kids, but Steve wanted just one. If she couldn’t give him that, would he stay? Would he find someone that could give him the thing he always dreamed for?
He kissed her like that again a year later in front of all their friends when they said their vows. It’s been 2 years since then and in that time they’ve saved the Earth twice and fought every other day. Even on the bad days, Steve always stays and that’s a revolutionary idea for her. No one in her life has stayed the way he has, sure Pepper and Rhodey have always been there but even they have their limits.
“Relax, Steve. Makes this a lot easier if you stay relaxed.” The tantalizing fingers find that magical bundle of nerves and Steve is heaving like he ran a marathon to keep from coming instantly. They push against the sensitive spot top to bottom repeatedly. “Everything feels equal and smooth. The central line is intact. Now I’m going to put in the speculum and take a few samples. How are you doing up there, Steve?”
“Since you wanted to be a brat earlier and not answer, you don’t get to come until I say so. If I let you. So you’ll have to earn your orgasm. Do you understand, Steve?” He felt the blunt tip of Tony’s cock at his entrance, teasing over the sensitive skin, but he wouldn’t get it until he proved that he was worth it.
But Steve has never cared, he has always loved her body. Their first time together, Toni tried to turn the lights off and keep on a shirt, but Steve convinced her to reveal the damage. Then he spent an hour that night kissing every scar, mark, and imperfection on her body. That might have been when she fell in love with him.
“I’ll bury him in it. Or should we do Shwarma?” Tony rubbed his chin. “Might just play it safe and do pizza.”
“That man,” he growled at the brunette in the memory, “killed my parents and Steve protected him. Steve never told me.”
“No, Thor.” Tony hissed, as if understanding what was about to happen. “You’re to stay five feet away at all times.”
“Howard was goofy and rambunctious, at least the man I got to meet,” he threw the man, his boyfriend, an apologetic look, “which I see in you often. But he was more hard-lines. Even with his growing wealth he was still thin like so many of us. You got bulk.”
Tony huffed out some laughter, “Many mornings, yes. Maybe a little more…lazy. God, I haven’t gone through a romp like that since, hell, ever.” He pulled himself up, and boxed Steve’s head between his elbows, his face hurting from smiling, “You’re amazing.”
Eventually Toni grew restless though, one could only dream about something so long before it was time to take action. They hadn’t come all the way out here to eat and sketch, they were here to make dreams reality.
The paper gown is, at best, a size to small, but it was obviously made for the typical petite omega. Steve, with his broad shoulders and boxy frame, was not made for something so delicate as paper.
She loved Steve, every single thing about this extraordinary man made her falling in love again every day. He was always so considerate of those around him, putting himself last with no second thought. Even now waiting until Toni had her pleasure before seeking his own, but now it was his turn to be selfish, his moment to take his pleasure from her body. This was Toni’s favorite part.
The latch on the door was the only sound in the room when Steve entered. Tony didn’t turn to look at him, just continued to look out as the rain pelted against the floor-to-ceiling glass window. He didn’t notice the tumbler in Tony’s hand until he sat it down on the side table next to him. They stood there, neither talking, for what was probably minutes but felt like hours to Steve.
Steve sits there in a torn gown with an ache in his ass as the evidence of his humiliation dries on his stomach. If this is what it is like to be omega, to feel like this, then how cruel is the world.
“Please don’t thank me for cheating on my wife,” Tony huffed out. He hadn’t taken off his clothes through their fucking, so with a quick tuck of his cock he looked as if nothing had happened. Maybe that’s how he lived with the guilt, pretending it didn’t happen.
After service, Tony set about doing the small duties he had been given; put out the candles, clean up from the offering, returning the books to their places. Maria’s warm laugh caught Tony’s attention and he saw her chatting with Steve. Never one to be left out, Tony blew out the last few candles quickly, instead of individually smothering the flames.
The soft press of lips was loving and passionate in ways foreign among all heartbreak. She didn't want to close her eyes or miss a moment, it was the kind of kiss that takes your breath away, not because it was forced out of you, but because who needs air when you have Steve Rogers kissing you?
In the army, having the implant was not a choice, it was a byproduct of the job. Soldiers can not worry about being out of commission for 3 days every few months, who knows when the urge could hit. In a camp full of alphas? In the battlefield? That’s why it was standard that all omegas have implants and everyone wore scent blockers.
Tony started to fight against the restraints against his neck and hip, thrashing from side to side to shake off the hold. Steve was stronger than that though, a little twisting and whining wouldn’t stop him from showing Tony what kind of man he is.
When he returned, Tony sat him down and explained how normal it was to want that. That night Steve got his first punishment from ‘Daddy’ for running away instead of talking.
They ate on the patio overlooking the lake. It was still early enough into the season that bugs weren’t too big of a nuisance and the weather was enjoyable. She was right though, once Steve finished scarfing down his double portion, he ran inside to get his sketchbook. It was peaceful, rocking in the chair and listening to Steve’s pencil scratch against the paper.
Toni moaned as the cock inside repeatedly hit the back wall of her cunt, this was the ultimate feeling of fulfillment. Like this, they were puzzle pieces, fitting perfectly together to make a beautiful scene. Steve’s strokes thankfully avoided the tender spot inside, Toni was still coming down from her peak and every movement caused pinpricks of electricity. She couldn’t decide if she wanted to push into the oncoming fire or pull away for relief, both a dizzying high.
“Do you have any questions, Steve?” He shakes his head ashamed. “Alright, give us a call back if you have any issues and see the nurse at the front to schedule your next appointment.” Then he’s out the door.
The blunt tip prodded at her tender slit, coating the first inches with the evidence of Toni’s pleasure. Steve hissed through his teeth when the bulbous head sunk into her pussy, walls squeezing the new intrusion. This first time wouldn’t last long, they both knew. They were on edge, teasing each other the last few hours and desperation was starting to set in. There would be time for sweet, slow, and everything in between later.
Eventually Steve was to a full hardness and ready to stake his claim on the loose hole. He rubbed the blunt head against the pucker, catching against the hole each time, “Baby, I’m dry.” Steve pushed. Tony wanted it rough, he was going to get rough. He was loose enough and the water would cut down on the friction, this wouldn’t take long anyway.
After that it was an experiment of how far he could push Steve before he would pull back, like some game of gay chicken. It started with more tight pants, loosening extra buttons after services on his shirts, discussing sexual encounters during confessionals to see Steve blush afterwards with the grand finale of this experiment occuring today.
Steve rolled his eyes, “Well, that doesn’t sound very productive given that I’m right here. Come help me cut up the broccoli.”
He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, the fear bleeding out of him. Steve wants him, it was just his hormone rattled brain making things up. This gorgeous, smart man desires him. “Good, that’s great Steve. Let me show you what you do to me.”
“That was the point. Guess it didn’t work, huh,” Dr. Stark chuckles. “Also, call me Tony. Sir makes me feel old,” he says as those delicious fingers repeat the process on his other breast. Steve is proud that this time he doesn’t react when Tony touches the tender peak. That doesn’t stop his cock from leaking a bit of precum at the sensation.
Steve laughed, “Yeah, me neither. Back then we didn’t know if I’d live long enough to hit puberty, let alone have a child. I always thought if I was lucky enough just to have one, then I’d be the happiest man in the world.”
The heaviness of the conversation was starting to weigh on both of them, what was supposed to be a happy weekend had taken a drastic somber turn. This weekend was about dreams coming true, not focusing on lives not lived. “Well, I’d suggest let’s go get started on that dream, but some one insisted that we eat first. What’s taking so long? Did you go kill the chicken yourself?”
The parish was primarily made up of an older crowd, most attending this very church since they were in Sunday school. Due to the lack of young families most roles in the service were left vacant, so on the Sundays that Tony attended he was made to play altar boy. In the beginning, he dreaded the humiliation that came from doing tasks typically filled by 8 year olds. If they functioned fine every other Sunday, why did he have to be subjected to the song and dance?
Maybe what scares him is if he opens this door, it makes being an omegas real. If he opens this door he must face the reality that he’s been running from for the last 10 years. In the army his designation hadn’t mattered, but in the civilian world it dictated everything. It tells him what clothes to wear, what job to work, what doctor to see.
As quickly as the stroking starts, it ends with a pinpoint touch to his slit by a foreign object. “Just a quick sample. Now I’m going to check your testicles for any signs of irregularities in size or shape.”
That’s how he found himself standing outside of the master bathroom listening to Tony sing away in the shower. Shit.
Steve closed the distance between them in 4 long strides, moving faster than ever outside of battle, cradling her head gently. Toni prepared for a crushing assault of lips, but none came. Instead he gazed at her like she was a magnificent diamond; strong, resilient, beautiful. Blue eyes searched her face for trepidation, fear, for a sign to stop, but why fear the start of something beautiful.
This endless trek led him to slipping into Tony’s guest room after all the business of the day was done. Steve had counted down the minutes of the customary hour he waited following Tony’s last meeting before seeking him out, he had learned that Tony needed to decompress first to get in the right head space for what was to come.
“Oh fuck, Toni! Here it comes” Steve growled as he came, semen shooting deep into her sopping wet cunt. One of his massive hands pushed against her stomach and Toni could swear she felt the come filling her, expanding the caverns inside of her, filling her with Steve’s soul.
If the moans spilling from Tony’s mouth were anything to go by, then he was loving this. When Tony turned his head, looking for a kiss, Steve guided him face first into the tiles facing the other way. “Yes, fuck baby, just like that.” Tony whimpered.
Right now Steve had hope and that was a powerful thing, but take that away and everything would crumble down around them. Without the hope for a better tomorrow, why wake up today? Maybe they could stake their hope in that 2 percent.
Steve nodded, “Yes Daddy.” Earning the right to come gave him something to work towards, a goal in mind. It almost felt like if he could earn getting fucked, earn an orgasm, he could earn back Tony’s love too.
They’ve been talking about slowing down for a while now, maybe buying some land far away from it all. Starting a family has always been Steve’s dream and with him Toni has started to dream of it too. So after a few months of failed pregnancy attempts, the idea was hatched to have a long weekend dedicated to making their dreams come true. Toni called it a sexcation and Steve wrinkled his nose at that. Tomato, potato.
Recent blood work has shown no sign of improvement of critical levels. Patient’s’ uterus continues to be a hostile environment for a fetus. Chances of conceiving, <2%.”
“Oh wow! Look at this place.” Steve looked at the house in awe as they got out of the car. The getaway had been his idea, they hadn’t taken a trip together since their honeymoon. This weekend was an opportunity to focus on the future. Their future.
Which leads to Tony gazing up at Father Rogers during his homily with pink, bitten lips and a slack jaw, looking the picture of innocence. Tony usually spent most of the service kneeling at the front like any good “altar boy”. Sometimes Steve would get so involved with his sermon that he would move from behind the pulpit, getting closer to his congregation, and to Tony. If he was lucky, their eyes would meet for a moment and he would get one of those all American, apple pie smiles.
Once the samples have been deposited into their tubes and placed on the tray, Tony looks at him over the sheet, “Steve, You don’t have to do this. You stop now and no one would judge you. Your heats will return to normal and you’ll get better at dealing with them. No harm, no foul.”
After the Battle of New York, the hurt feels still lingered, looming over all their interactions. It took a few weeks of living in the tower together before Steve was the bigger person and apologized. He was sorry for undervaluing Toni as a member of the team, Iron Woman was just as important as Toni Stark. He didn’t just apologize though, he meant it and went on to show it everyday after which was new. Then he forgave her when she owned up to the mistakes she made in believing that Steve Rogers was nothing without the serum. They both thought the other was hiding behind abilities.
Moans spout from Steve throat, impossible to hold back when his burning length finally gets attention. These animalistic noises don’t belong to him anymore, he isn’t the man, the omega he was when he walked in here. How could he hold back? After the last hour of being on edge, of denying this desire deep in his stomach, it feels like being drenched in gasoline. A blaze spreads throughout his body, his skin is on fire with this yearning like never before.
Eventually the church doors opened and footsteps tracked the movement of the intruder. “Tony?” Jarvis called out. Their time was up. California awaited, family and responsibilities lied just outside of those doors. Steve was right, you can always find beauty even in tragic endings.
The last form has the office’s logo at the top rather than the generic hospital form, these are new questions related to his visit. “When was your last heat?” Steve’s cheeks turn bright red like they did the first time that Dr. Erskine asked him at 16. He quickly writes down perfunctory answers then returns the clipboard.
Tony’s pace was beginning to falter, the once long strokes had become short piston-like stabs that were building up to his release. The hand abandoned his chest, one returned to his hip for stability, but the other wound itself around his throat and tightened. “Beg me, Steve. Beg Daddy to fill you with his come.”
Dr. Stark cuts the strings and pulls out the speculum, “The cervix opens up at the apex of an orgasm, typically to let semen in. It is the least painful approach. You might bleed for a few days, but should be over by the end of the week. Your body will take about 3 months to adjust to the device and you might lose your heats within the first year. Given your history, I would almost guarantee yours will stop fairly quickly.. Take some over the counter pain medication and rest for today.”
“Ty, baby, come join me. Last night was amazing, how about an encore?” Tony called over his shoulder.
A nurse leads Steve to an exam room, hands him a paper gown and sheet with instructions to put on the gown with the front facing outwards. The click of the door lets Steve release the breath he’s been holding since he walked in the hospital.
The long strokes felt like adding wood to a fire, only achieving a larger, longer burn. It would continue until they both were consumed with the heat, warm inside and out. Toni whimpered as Steve found his pace, tiring of the too little friction.
When you live with someone it is normal to spend time together, so they can’t pinpoint when romantic feelings began to fester. It went from group dinners to grabbing lunch together discussing SHIELD business to dinners because Toni got in late to planning nights out together.
Dammit. Tears gathered at the corners of her eyes, threatening to spill. Toni hadn’t shared the horrible results of her reproductive health review with Steve, she couldn’t bear the sadness and disappointment this would cause. He was so excited when his came back clean, the fear of historical medical issues and the serum washed away. He wanted this so badly and she wanted to give it to him.
He set the kit down on the counter, he’d grab it on his way out, then made his way over to the entrance of the walk in shower. Honestly, he missed this shower, it had always been the best relief after a long day and sore muscles. But the modest glass shower in his suite was more than generous by his standards.
His orgasm felt like a suckerpunch to the gut and his back arches with the release of tension. Immediately the paper gown rips completely and falls down his shoulders to leave him bare. His cock releases rope after rope of hot come on to his stomach, leaving him sticky and sweaty. Before he can even come down from the high, he feels an intense pain deep in his canal that radates through his stomach, “Jesus, fuck!”
He looked up from the sketch he was working on, a hummingbird drinking from a feeder, his pupils blown wide, “Yeah, you want me to put a baby in you?”
Steve knew it was over, as if he didn’t already, but he knew for sure the day he saw Tony propose to Pepper during a televised press conference. The team was hiding in Australia when they saw the footage and despite the warm weather, a chill crept into Steve’s bones that he could never warm away.
Tony has reached inside him and is pulling the orgasm out of him. Tears prickle at the edges of his vision, the desire to find release evading him. He is so close to tumbling over the edge, but it still feels out of his reach. The fire is so close to over taking him, but he keeps running.
The next moment Steve has his arms around Toni and is lifting her out of the chair. It’s a primitive display of strength, but the act sends sparks of hot arousal through her groin spreading wetness.
The only spark of light were the days when Tony would stop by. While he is officially retired, Tony was still the benefactor of the Avengers and there were still duties to be fulfilled. Natasha would call him in if they had a decent idea that needed Tony’s input or business of the new Universe Security Counsel. Steve looked forward to these days like a child might wish for Christmas or summer break, he couldn’t wait to tear a married man away from his family even if just for a few hours so that he could bask in the warmth that Tony brought.
The first thing Steve noticed was the perfect red handprint on Tony’s right ass cheek, God, that must have stung. He was going to have a horrible time sitting down for a few days, at least. Next were the purple hickies that littered his back and neck, some were outlined by angry teeth marks. Finally he caught sight of Tony’s battered, loose asshole when he leaned forward ever so slightly.
Steve snorted, as if insulted, but there was such open happiness in his eyes that Tony had to stare lovingly, something in him soaring higher than the suit has ever taken him.
Arriving in town took less time than expected. Steve thought it due to the company. By the time they made it into the town everyone was up and moving. There was more life than there had been the previous evening. Most everyone was polite with nods in greeting and a few more waved to Sam’s direction. None approached them as they pulled to their stop before Sam’s bar where he hid the coach away when not in use.
“You had better put a disclaimer on the video to tell younger viewers to NOT do this.” Bruce grumbled, his head hurting.
Sighing heavily, he shook his head again, and concentrated on looking at the blueprints for something other than childish notions that there was more than meets the eye. Peirce would get him to working on everything broken, and there was a lot broken, and he needed to get himself focused on future tasks.
“Oh, oh!” Instantly Bruce looked relieved, apparently finding it true…there was a like spirit here for him. “It’s Japanese cooking. I can’t cook but there is something very soothing about watching them.”
“Exactly. The same Tony Stark that lost and gained everything in one night. Who has faced kidnapping, torture, and terrorists. Who knew that to be the best, to do the best, you had to play dirty.” She stood in front of him, took a hold of both his shoulders, and smiled. “Who has won many wars, personal and physical, to now rule over the world. You are Tony Fucking Stark. Iron Man. Leader of the Avengers. Ruler of the world. Bringer of peace.”
Scrubbing his face he groaned and shook out his limbs to get feeling back into them. He’d always been a realist, growing up the way he did he had to, but he always thought himself somewhat positive and hopeful of humanity.
With a quick check to the clock he was surprised to see that it was nearly four in the morning. Apparently binge-watching movies was a dangerous past time. He got up to his feet, popped his back, and brought his popcorn and cereal bowls to the sink to fill with water and wash later in the day.
‘Not that I would use Tony.’ Steve scolded himself. ‘He deserves more than that. But still…’ his lips felt uncomfortably un-kissed. He rather liked that part from the previous day. Wasn’t that a given to-do for any stage of a relationship?
“Not you, Tony.” He comforted. “Just in general. It’s fine. It’s worked for me. Apparently I can do a dreamy expression well, something probably all artists or creators can do, and it just seems like I’m not all here.” He pointed to his head. “Means I can get away with things. You won’t believe how many people would just start spewing national secrets because they thought I didn’t understand what they were talking about.”
Tony stared at him a moment and hung his head in defeat. It was not a feeling he was used to, example and point the whole world trembling under his thumb, but he got the feeling this was going to be something often in his new life with the man. Because Steve giving him a pleading look with those big blue eyes and his cheeks stuffed like a hamster was simply the cutest thing that had ever been produced. He wish he could have thanked Steve's mother for giving birth to such a precious Adonis. How was he expected to say no?
“Fuck, you’re cute.” His grin grew back. “Will you blush if I talk dirty? Let me try: Sex.” He instantly burst out laughing at Steve’s reaction and face. “You
“Ah, Nebula.” Thanos shook his head, disappointed. “She was never as strong as her sister but I never thought her so weak to betray me.”
? I wasn’t aware that tight backside would allow for such a thing.” Brock noted, smirking over his own drink.
“Ah, well, they say if I can come and help to tend some of their fields I can bring home good portion of what I work. Apparently, most others in the village have other jobs that don’t allow them the time to help every farmer. So I was asked to do.” He shrugged meekly. “I said I would speak to you about it, but it sounded like a good idea. Would save a bit of money.”
Eventually, Steve decided to pull back and head to the bar to visit Sam. The bar was nice, warm, and smelled of hops and burnt nuts. Everything felt really relaxed; quiet, as so many other places in the town, but nice.
“Bride?” Ok, maybe his fever was still in affect. He supposed this was better than PTSD nightmare fuel. “Uhm, I’m Steve…are you…uh…with the Guardians?” He thought Thor introduced him to all that remained, and her certainly never mentioned any of these.
Thor just gave him one of his ultimate pouts but did as told. The moment he was back on his feet, Steve rounded on Thor and then, to the surprise of everyone, picked the god up and put him on his own shoulders. It wasn’t as fluid, as Steve was not as big as Thor was, but it was just as easy. “See? Told you I could do it.”
“Yes, sir.” Steve nodded as Zemo walked off—perhaps to his room or back to his family. Steve was not sure. It was clear he was not invited for more conversation.
“I see Jarvis made sure you used the best ingredients.” Tony noted as he took a bite and lord, he had no realized how hungry he was until the burst of tomatoes and meat hit his tongue.
Steve just gave an innocent shrug and waved him away as the doors closed, leaving him alone within the penthouse for the first time. It felt strange and empty without Tony.
Yes, a lot of historical inaccuracies…I’ve never actually written anything for this time-period so…whoops? I did some research but, yeah, not enough to shake a stick at. Also, there was a lot of dialogue and exposition, but I don’t want to fall into the classic horror-trap of the “presently endangered newcomer suffering due to lack of info” cliché. I don’t think all humans in a town would do that. Hopefully, a bit more interesting stuff will start to happen now.
“He promised that good would find me.” He whispered, his chest aching and burning. When he breathed he cold feel the metal digging inside of him, something rubbing against his bones, and little pulses of electricity that kept his heart alive.
"Papa says breakfast is ready." She said in that matter of fact tone she learned from Steve. "We need to come down."
“Yeah, we all believe the moment this challenge is done you’re going to cough it all up and not inhale the entire packet.” Tony walked over and grabbed three cookies for himself before they disappeared. “She is going to be so pissed.”
Well to anyone but Steve himself. Almost everything out of Tony’s mouth, when not an explanation or something sarcastic, was a compliment so heavy with feelings that Steve would turn into a weak tomato.
A splitting headache made the image dissipate and he grabbed a wall to keep himself steady. He was going insane. He couldn't keep the thoughts or images at bay any longer, no matter how he tried. They slithered in and he fell into it each time. His hands were desperate for the feel of Steve's skin. To hear his real voice. Winter pine. Gentle tremors.
“H-Howa....” Steve paused and blinked at the man. No, this was not Howard. Though he had blinding similarities the man before him was someone completely different. His face was fuller, brown eyes slightly larger, darker skin, and though looked shorter than Howard this man was thicker in the chest and shoulders. There were strong muscles to his form that Howard did not have. Not to mention additional, and unusual, facial hair that strangely worked well on his masculine jaw.
“Yes, yes.” He wheezed, trying not to panic. “The dust finally got to me. I am going out to catch my breath. Please tell Pierce I just need a moment so I don’t…collapse again and I will be in to…” he was having difficulty in catching his breath, “in to inform him of …what I found, if he wishes.”
“Easy.” Tony instantly placed his arm around Steve’s waist to keep him steady. “It’s a lot to take in.” He looked at Steve with open sympathy and something else. Steve was not sure but he found he wanted it. He needed something to stabilize him or he’d for sure pass out. “I’m so sorry. But I didn’t want to baby you. Not with this anyway.”
Was he truly allowed to take it, make it his own...when was the last time he allowed himself to feel and own and...Steve.
“It’s as I said, Steve.” Tony leaned closer and his voice dropped lower. “You’re so very special to me.”
"It was probably best it was eaten." Steve noted, with a gentle expression. "It doesn't sound like you would've had any tonight since we are going out.
“For now. We’re keeping it locked up and with only a select few allowed to even know about it.” He started to push Steve’s hair back again. “We thought it for the best. We’re hoping to get a bit more studying from it before it gets locked away for good.”
Tony just stared. Although he knew the many artistic renderings of Steve Rogers were, for the most part, incorrect, he could not have imagined that he would be so heartbreakingly perfect.
Tony lounged against the counter to watch his Steve eat. It was simultaneously sad and amusing to see how the young man treated food. He was right that the solider needed more food than anyone he’d seen before, besides Thor.
It was down at the end of the hall, the door was already open for him, and the light was on and casted a glow into the hall. Tony was not a religious man but he had seen enough in his life to believe in some signs and symbolism (hell, he was ‘business partners’ with god-like-aliens) and he knew he was about to walk into his heaven. All of a sudden his legs felt heavy and he needed to slow down.
“Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve dealt with people like that.” Still, he kept that information to the side to stew over later. Something in him itched again but he pushed it to the side. It was nothing.
Tony laughed and his expression softened a bit. “Ah, speaking of which.” He picked himself up and hurried over to some shelves and started to rummage through them.
Then a smoky laugh and from the other end of the room, following the same invisible tightrope as himself, a body melted out from the shadows.
“You’re always weird.” Steve pulled him in to give him a kiss. “Look,” he began to pet Tony’s hair, comforting the worried and hyperactive man, “If you promise to start talking about them, either now or later, I promise I will listen and talk right back.”
Steve rubbed his ear briefly, remembering that same voice. It was the same, he was positive, as he did not think there was another voice quite like the one haunting it; deep, almost raspy, plenty masculine with something playful. Unique and lovely. It made Steve’s skin tingle and his stomach feel cold.
Apparently, Tony technically had more but they were not regular offices. They were his many labs where he worked on his non-paperwork. Steve had yet to see the labs and he was grateful for the delay in that.
“Then don’t think about it just yet. Just take it in and talk to me. Besides, you’ll be forced to talk about it later. Enjoy not for now.”
It was a strange thing to hear a man speak of his father with such ice but deep down Steve was not taken too off guard. He loved Howard but he never thought the fanatic, selfish man would ever make a good father. He was sad to see that prediction came true.
“Ooh, ohh, what if it’s your quote, ‘I am Iron Man’ but we make it possessive so it goes ‘I am Iron Man’s’. That could be good.” Josh continued, apparently very inspired.
"I..." Was he something more than a shield? Who was Steve Rogers before Captain America? Was he really anything? "I don't..."
“Fine. I’ll be up front if you need any assistance.” She gave him a proper nod and turned heel to stalk away. Her heels clicked against smooth floor and if he angled himself right he could see her soft light and form on her desk. Besides the two of them, it was empty within the library. Perhaps most did not have the luxury to spend daytime looking at books. Interesting that there would be one of this size.
“It’s so a stripper.” He grinned and led her to the elevator. He felt like swaying a bit. His head was cloudy from booze, excitement, and exhaustion.
“Fine, fine.” Tony did not need to see the plethora of Clint’s family photos again as proof for the archer’s love of his family and all things toddler. “Jarvis, put that in the calendar as well. I at least want to send a present.”
The image, brief but now caught in a silent picture, was of complete heartbreak and regret. The pain on Steve’s face in that second was something new to Tony. His expression was open and raw and so very, very broken.
Steve paused and turned to look at the girl. She had an accent that was a bit thick, unexpected in these parts—but then again, Sam mentioned many unusual folk were drawn to the area. “Is it?”
“Ah, hell,” Tony groaned and fell back down against the younger man when he was freed. He’ll feel even better once he relieved himself in the bathroom and got some food in him. He hadn’t had anything since the few bites of Clint’s salad. And coffee. All the coffee. And Steve.
Pepper rolled her eyes and gave him a playful slug. “You wish. Now, your confidence boosted enough?" She did not wait for an answer. "Good. Go in there and see him. Besides, he’s non-refundable.”
“I could’ve sworn you invited me for coffee.” He grumbled, hoping beyond hope that the terrifyingly brilliant man did not see anything.
Why on earth would Steve need anything like that? He had everything he could ever want. Tony spoiled him at all chances. Freedom just meant better chances of pain, of someone stealing Steve, and taking him away.
The names Stark and Marvels don’t even get mentioned in the explanation before the bidding begins. It seems nobody thinks this car is that big a deal and as it’s not in the best condition, it’ll go cheap. There are one or two collectors who are interested in this one of a kind car.
“Give us the gem.” Gialetta Nefaria appeared on a vehicle, the expressionless jade mask that had become her face making her seem even more like a ghost in this white desert.
“Zemo soon,” the man replied and grinned, knowing exactly how to get to him. He had an uncomfortable toad-like smile that made him look a lot less handsome than before.
“Well, Old Norse. What does this mean?” Tony pointed at the runes and symbols. “Eternal gem? Time? And why does it say five?”
And Tony Stark was not someone to let a chance slip through his fingers - even if things could get dangerous down the line.
“Cap must have gone up there to get it. Got out. Let’s say he was trying to get back to the SHIELD base…” He drew a line across the ice towards where the man’s home base had been in those days. “I only have miles and miles of ice to search.”
It’s been a tough few months, adjusting, catching up to this new day and age. He’s been called a lot of things, and it’s nice to know that he was remembered after the war even though he’d been presumed dead. It’s nice that people still think of him as a hero. He discovered there’s a whole comics line that bears his name these days… Published by the Marvels foundation. None of it are
They left Fury the coordinates of their last battle and SHIELD agents found at least half of the soldiers and Gia still frozen in that moment in time.
Tony blinked, tried to chase that memory, and vaguely remembered something along those lines. He nodded, cheeks heating up, cleared his throat. “Steve,” he tried again, “do you think this has something to do with what happened to you?”
Nobody had anything to say to that. They sat together between dusty folders in silence. Then Jim straightened his shoulders: “Alright then. I’m game. How do we find Hydra if we can't find the last resting place of Captain America?”
Those few SHIELD agents think he’s a relic from the past - and he plays the role well on purpose when they come by to see how he’s doing, try to ask him unsubtle questions about the new hero called Iron Man, and about how he’s adjusting.
“Tony, darling,” the annoying voice of Gia sounded again – oh had he loved that voice once…, “don’t make this difficult. We’ve got you this time. And all that counts is that final time, isn’t it?”
“Ah,” Tony said and chuckled, pulling a stack of pictures out of the inner pocket of his jacket and put them on the table beside Pepper for both of them to look at, “I thought you’d never ask.”
“I know, yes, thank you, Jim,” Tony snapped – at Fury, not at his friend who had become an unwilling intermediary since he’d joined Fury’s ranks recently. The general was none too pleased that Tony himself was willing to work with them but unwilling to join his military intelligence section or enlist. In Fury’s eyes, he remained too much of a wild card and Tony knew that he was trying to get his hands on Stark Industry assets behind his back to prepare for the day when Tony no longer wanted to play by his rules.
Tony just continued to laugh, “Fine, fine, that’s fair. I would recommend you just allow me to keep you pressed up against the wall as I practically hump you into oblivion but I figure that won’t sound romantic.”
Steve felt like that was not quite true but he didn’t argue back. The hair on his arms tingled and rose against Tony’s attention.
Steve took one last breath on his own and found he could finally stare back the stranger. “W-What happened?”
Steve, only three weeks out of the ice, covered in his old suit, with his helmet long gone and his longer blond hair hovering over his face. His cheeks were smudged with soot and blood and there was a slight limp in his walk though he made no notice of it. He was standing straight like a soldier, but he still looked a bit small. Unsure. So terribly lonely.
“Not romantic, no, it wasn’t. When I was young I couldn’t tell, but after time it just settled in to me that my parents were not in love with each other.”
Natasha nodded and stuffed some more food in her cheeks. Her pretty face was smeared with marinara sauce. The red made something about her frightening. He had a feeling she could destroy him with the fork in her hands. It was time to stop, he realized. He wasn’t going to get details until Tony gave the approval.
Steve could not help but flush at his own stupid romanticism, he blamed being an artist, and had to look away. The intensity and color were too much. It felt as if he were being swallowed and if he did not break through the surface he would drown.
The woman, Wanda, was a nice girl though a little quiet and sullen. Their interaction was brief and he could tell she was more interested in hiding behind her book than talking to a strange man but he got enough information out on her that if mail is ever delivered, it was on Tuesdays unless it was expedited. Unless a payment was made, mail was rarely delivered to the household and Steve could not expect for Shield Manor to ever get word on if anything was received or not. It was their job to come check and pick up.
“They were not precise. But it will just be based on the season, their own stock, and how much work I do. I figure if I show more interest they’ll settle on a percentage.”
"Is this all you got?" Steve smirked down at Tony on the padded ground. "I've heard so much about your moves. I had wanted to see them myself."
“You are more than welcome to keep trying as long as you want.” Steve squeezed Tony, moaning eagerly for their next round.
“To the best of my ability…which isn’t a lot.” Steve said with an apologetic tone and sheepish grin. “This really sparked my interest. A haunted manor with an unusual, mysterious past…a whole town refusing to give any information about it…from my perspective, you’d have to see it would be hard to not be curious.”
“Fuck. No. I don’t know much about what happened to you, but Howard put in just enough detail that it wasn’t just an injection and there you go. You were already experimented on. You’re not going through it again.” Tony kissed him a little too rough and then pulled away, “I won’t hear more of it. You’re not an experiment any more. You’re not some fucking shield to get beaten down. You’re Steve and you’re going to stay as Steve.”
“You’re obvious, Rogers. Your mistake was trying to come off cold and standoffish. Composed, I could buy, you’re a soldier…but god, you are so gentle. So giving. These eyes,” the hands reached up to cradle Steve’s face, thumbs brushing circular motions on the soft cheeks, under the blue eyes, “they really can’t hide anything from me.”
Tony hummed happily and his suit started to disappear, heading back to wherever the man had somehow hid it before. Steve found he didn’t care too much at the moment. Tony’s mouth was far more important than anything else in truth.
The room is silent for one second, then all the Avengers start laughing. Tony thinks he'll pass out because his belly
"You did it, Steve. I'm so proud," and they hug each other. Another five minutes. Steve cries on his shoulder, Tony cries on his. All the guilty and the shame, all the fear, they let it out for each other.
She smirks at Steve, turns her back on him, kicks a guy and he falls down to her feet. She turns to Steve again.
“Hmph, I struggle seeing your vision, Steven.” Brock, the oldest son and heir, clicked his tongue. The pink appendage made a slimy chill drip down Steve’s spine and he looked his way back to the house.
