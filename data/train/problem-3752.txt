he answered,
Dean woke with a start when his phone started ringing. “What the fuck?” He mumbled and reached for the phone and noticed it was 2 in the morning. “Somebody better be fucking dead.” he mumbled to himself again and frowned when he saw the unknown number. He almost ignored it but something was telling him to answer.
“Yes peas.” Dean carried Henry upstairs into the bathroom.
“Uhhh, in the backyard.”
~0~0~0~0~
son. And unlike you, I won't abandon him if he turns out an omega a beta. Unlike you, I'll actually be a father to my son." Dean growled.
"I'm drinking a beer what does it look like?" I snapped pulling the bottle from Dean's reach. "Shouldn't you wait to see if you're-" "If I'm not pregnant?" I interrupted and Dean nodded. "I'm not. I took a test almost an hour ago." I said quietly; "shit. Well, I guess we should make an appointment." Dean said putting his beer down and pulled me in for a hug. "I already called. I have an appointment at 4." I said against his shoulder. "Okay, I'll see if I can get off early." "You don't have too Dean. I actually want to go alone." I said. "What, why?" Dean asked and I finally snapped and shoved him away.
“Yuh.” Henry coughed a little bit as he sat up so Dean handed him one of the water bottles.
“Oooo pie.” Dean grinned and turned towards the kitchen.
“Thank you Sam.” Ellen said and her and Bobby carried dishes to the kitchen. “Can you get the last dish out of the truck?” she asked Sam.
Dean said,
Dean sat down on the small work bench near the wall and I sat next to him; Dean just hid his face in my neck and after a few minutes I could fell the wetness of his tears. "Dean." I said and wrapped him in my arms. We stayed like that for who knows how long when Dean suddenly gasped and yanked away from me looking terrified. "Dean? Dean what's wrong?!" I asked reaching for his cheek. "I-I remember. I remember everything!" He breathed.
“Hey.. Shhh.” Cas said scooting over so he could get Dean to stop clawing at his face.
A week passed and still to pups, "Dean, find me the spiciest thing you can find at the store." I said one night while we were watching tv. "What? Why?" "Because, I've read that spicy foods sometimes help someone go into labor, I've already walked all over the house twice and around the back yard and that didn't help." I said "alright, I'll be back in 15. I'll have my phone." Dean said and left. 20 minutes later I was sitting in the kitchen with a Habanero Pepper cut up in strips in a bowl and a huge glass of milk. "This was the hottest one they had at the store." Dean said a slightly worried look on his face.
Cas decided to ignore them and gave up on waiting for Dean, feeling a little disappointed. He barley focused through Algebra and he couldn't help himself but basically run from his locker to photography once the bell rang. We walked in and Bobby was hunched over his desk with an exhausted look on his face and for some reason, it felt like someone dumped a bucket of ice water down his back.
After hearing Amelia yelling Gabe and Charlie came running back in. “Did I hear Dean yelling?” Gabe asked.
Once Mary came back downstairs Ellen spoke up. “Alright. Henry’s in bed, what’s going on?” Dean and Cas took turns explaining the Amelia situation and how they were trying to figure what else they could do. Dean was crying from the stress of everything and was still having minor anxiety attacks just from the memories she has brought back.
“Alright.” Dean smirked, loving how intense his son gets about shows, just like his papa. He filled one of Henry’s bowls with some grapes and filled his sippy cup and brought it to him, which Henry absently took and started eating the grapes.
By time 4:15 rolled around Cas had practically paced every inch of the house and was startled when there was a honk outside. He threw on his shoes and ran outside to the car. "Hello Cas." Mary said with a small smile. "Hi… Um, can you tell me what's going on?" Cas asked nervously, "I'm sorry Cas, but it's between you and Dean." Mary said and pulled into the driveway. "Wait… Is-isn't Dean supposed to be in heat?" Cas asked but continued getting out of the car. "He is supposed to be, yes. But he's not." Mary said and walked into the house, Cas followed her and carefully scented the house, nope, no smell of Dean's heat, just the mix of the three members of the house hold, "he's probably up in his room. Go ahead and go up." Mary said heading towards the living room.
"Mary wants to go to the zoo so Sam wanted to know when a good time would be to come by and pick up a few things." I said holding my hand out for Dean to help him up. "I'm going back to bed. We need a new fucking couch if we're ever going to pass out on it again." Dean grumbled crawling under the sheets once we got upstairs. I just rolled my eyes and started the shower. Dean was snoring softly buried under the blankets so I went into Mary's room and packed a small bag of things she would need, like sun screen, her hat, and an extra pair of clothes. I got downstairs right as the doorbell rang, when I opened it Mary started clinging to my knees. "Mama! We going to the zoo!" Mary squealed jumping up and down.
“Don’t be. The kid hardly knows me.” Benny shrugged and they watched Charlie carry Henry up the stairs and he immediately reached for Dean.
I made Mary supper once I calmed down, when she was finished I gave her a bath and got her ready for bed. An hour later when she fell asleep I went to the bathroom and started a bath hoping that would calm me down some more. By time 11 o'clock rolled around Dean still wasn't home so I decided to give up on waiting for him and crawled into bed only to crawl back out at 11:45 when I heard the door open and voices carry up the stairs. I put on my glasses and went downstairs to see a sober and slightly pissed of John trying to drag a
"You could have worn a shirt.." I teased, "yeah, well I know how much you love this body, be glad I put on sweats." Dean winked and I went back to sleep. I woke up sometime later in the day to the smell of chicken; I sat up and noticed I was in the bed alone. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and I heard voices coming from downstairs, so I slid out of bed and made my way down. "Nooo gampa stop!" I heard Mary giggling, it was nice to hear her giggles again. I found everyone in the living room and there was no where to sit besides the floor so I walked over and sat on Dean's lap.
"Mom, there's something I wanted to ask you." Dean said quietly and gestured for Cas to come sit by him, "what's that?" Mary asked sitting on the edge of her chair. "Well… You said, that Cas needed to claim me as soon as possible.. And I-we were wondering if we could have the house to ourselves saturday night?" Dean asked a small blush crawling up his cheeks. "Hmm. I suppose that would be alright… I have the night shift saturday and sunday so I'll just crash at Bobby and Ellen's and Sam can stay there also, we can take Lucy." Mary said standing up, "alright, I'm off to work, I'll see you tomorrow Dean, and you too Cas." she smiled and left.
Amelia cried her crocodile tears and acted offended. “Cas… You know I’ve always loved you.” She flung herself into Cas arms and cried. “I miss you… I just want a good life for Claire, I know you’re a good father.”
“My nephew almost dies today and you think I’m not going to stop by?” Gabe scoffed and pulled his brother in for a hug.
Hey guys, sorry it's been a while. I have a new job and I work nights, so I sleep ALOT... So it's been hard to find time to write, but I'd like to thank you all for your patience and I hope the wait was worth it. Let me know what you think!
Dean stumbled to the Impala and just sat there for a few minutes. He shook his head and went to pick up Sam. "Wow, you actually came to pick me up." Sam sassed, "Sam, not now." Dean sighed and headed home. They pulled into the driveway and Sam got out and ran inside, where Dean slowly made his way in and let Lucy out. As he was walking back to the living room Sam knocked into him and kept going. "Sam!" Dean yelled, "what?" he snapped turning back around.
“His vitals look good, his oxygen is still a little low. I’m going to go get a look at his lungs to see if there’s any damage.” The doctor said.
They put on boxers and crawled into bed. “Dr. Hansen’s appointment went well. I cried… Like a lot but I feel better about things now.” Dean started.
“He’s okay he just had a bad dream.” Cas told him.
~_~_~_~
“I not a whiny baby.” Henry whined.
"Cas, come on we gotta go." Dean said grabbing his elbow, "I don wanna go 'ome." He slurred, "Cas please, you're drunk and Henry wont stop crying." Dean said tugging gently to get him moving. "No not yet." Cas whined. "Ugh, fine. You have exactly one hour left then I'm coming back to get you." Dean said, "kay love youuuuu" Cas grinned and threw his arms around Dean's neck and attempted to kiss him but ended up kissing Dean's chin. "Gross. Love you too." Dean mumbled and wiped off his chin.
It's been a week since the accident, so Dean was currently sitting in a small room with Cas waiting to get his stitches out. Dean was still a little week and he had been only going half a day at school, starting monday he would be going full days again. The bullying was down for the moment which Dean was thankful for, all that happened were stares, and he was used to that.
After they ate and the boys washed the dishes, they went back downstairs. "I'm going to take a shower." Dean said heading for the bathroom, "how about we just quickly wash our hair then take a bath? Who knows when we'll get another quiet time to take one together?" Cas grinned, "hmm, I like that idea." Dean smirked and started stripping.
felt what I have with you when I was with her, she's a beta…" Cas said, "fuck you." Dean whispered and Cas' heart cracked a little, "what?" he whispered, his voice shaking too. "FUCK YOU! GET OUT!" Dean yelled and that's when Mary made her appearance. "What the hell is going on down here?!" She yelled looking between the two boys. "GET OUT!" Dean yelled again throwing his sketch pad at Cas' head and stormed into their room, slamming the door.
“Owwww daddy.” Henry whined when Dean accidentally got shampoo in his eyes.
“I will!”
underneath the words was a picture that made Dean's stomach sink and his heart shatter. It was a picture of Cas and Amelia making out at the party.
"Yeah well, I know you need it so I figured, what the hell." Dean said and scooped a good portion of salad onto his plate. "So what, we're having a three course meal?" I chuckled at the other covered dishes on the cart. "Maybe. Shut up and eat your rabbit food." By time we got through the other dishes Dean brought over the last one and revealed chocolate covered strawberries.
Dean asked and Cas could tell that he was panicking a little.
I said but I did take the hot tea out of his hand. "Humor me." Dean said handing me the bag and I pulled out the fries and started nibbling on them. I was hungrier than I thought, I ended up eating the burger and fries along with half of Dean's pie, "hey! Not the pie!" Dean complained and took it away from me. "Sorry, I guess I'm a stress eater." I said "I guess so… So where are we sleeping?" Dean asked looking around the room, "you get the chair, it reclines and I'm going to lay with Mary, hence the bigger bed." I said getting up to move to the bed. "Oh, okay." Dean replied and finished of the pie. We both fell asleep shortly after.
Cas saw the first tear drop onto the comforter and Dean slowly looked up at him, pulled something out of his back pocket but didn't show him. "Cas… I-I'm pregnant." He said so quiet Cas didn't hear him. "What? I can't hear you. Dean please tell me what's going on." Cas said grabbing Dean's face gently so they could see each other, Cas could see the fear in his eyes but there was something else there too that he couldn't quite make out. "I'm pregnant." Dean said louder more tears falling; Cas dropped his hands and it felt like his heart dropped to his stomach. "W-what?" he stuttered, "here." Dean whispered handing him the sonogram that was slightly wrinkled from being in his pocket. "The little peanut shape i-is our baby Cas." Dean whispered wiping his cheek with the back of his hand.
"Let me go you dick." Dean wheezed trying to push him off, "you shouldn't have said that." Alistair growled and punched Dean in the face and then shoved him to the ground. Dean could feel his eye swelling and the blood drip out of his nose. "Stop!" Dean tried to say but Alistair ignored him and gave him a hard kick in the stomach, "oomph!" All the air in Dean's chest escaped his body and he started gasping for air.
"He kissed someone else." I whispered, "well, that's not so much cheating if you ask me." Missouri said softly and my head shot up "what? How is that no cheating? He kissed another woman." I said getting mad, "Cas calm down please, did he sleep with this woman? She asked "I don't know, he said he didn't but I confronted her, and she said that we did." "Well, who do you want to believe?" "Dean." I whispered. "Then you believe Dean. Now, I suggest that you give that boy a call and tell him to get home so you two can talk things out, all the way, no storming out or anything." Missouri said softly and before I could answer I heard the front door open then Mary yelled "Daddy!" "Looks like you get your chance now." Missouri said standing up and giving me a hug.
The next morning after Cas left for work Charlie called. “Hey Charlie.” Dean answered, tucking the phone between his shoulder and ear so he could finish throwing laundry in the washer.
“Jesus, Dean.”
"Okay miss Mary, why don't we go wake up daddy?" I said once I got her wiped off. "Yes!" Mary smiled so I picked her up and carried her up the stairs. "Okay Mary, you have to be reaaallllyyy quiet and when I count to three, I want you to yell daddy as loud as you can okay?" I whispered and Mary giggled and nodded. "Okay, one…. two…. three!" "DAAAADDDDYYYYY!" Mary yelled as loud as she could and Dean shot up in bed, "What?! Who?! Mary? What's wrong?" Dean scrambled making sure the sheets were covering at least his bottom half. Mary and I burst into laughter, "damn it Cas, that's not funny! I bout had a heart attack!" Dean growled but I could see a smile forming on his face. "So what do I owe this wonderful wake up call for?" Dean asked once he got calmed down.
“Yeah… what time issit?”
Cas slowly walked over to his mate and kneeled in-between Dean's legs, "it's going to be okay, can I have the blade?" he asked quietly and his heart broke when he saw Dean look up with scared, watery eyes. Slowly, Dean gave him the blade and Cas noticed Charlie peeking her head around the corner so he just held out the blade for her to take.
They were laying in Cas's bed when Cas brought up the dance, "Dean?" "hmm?". "Do, you want to go to the dance?" "well, I don't think I'd be able to find a date this late in the game, but I don't know, it might be fun…" Dean grinned and Cas just smacked his chest, "very funny.". "Yes, Cas. I'd love to go to the dance." Dean grinned and rolled on top of his boyfriend and pressed their mouths together.
Dean and Mary entered the dining room and Dean could tell Sam wanted to ask a thousand questions but he kept his mouth shut. After pie, Bobby and Dean discussed a few things about the yearbook and a few of the new staff. "Alright boy, I'll see you tomorrow." Bobby said and gave Dean a quick hug. "You too Bobby, bye Ellen." Dean said and gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek. "I'll meet you two at home." Mary said after her goodbyes and hit the road.
"Dude. I was drunk and we had a fight, I wasn't really thinking straight." Dean said. "What ever. Have a nice day at work." I said and left the kitchen.
Cas pried her off him and before he could say anything Dean grabbed the back of Amelia’s hair, opened the door and shoved her out of the house. “Don’t you
Some time between Cas and Mary's brief talk, Dean managed to pass out with his head on the table. "I think the day has caught up to him…" Cas mumbled and Mary just let out a watery chuckle. "I'm going to take him upstairs and grab my things from the car… Are you going to be okay?" Cas asked, "I'll be fine, just make yourself at home. I'll get you a phone monday and put you on our plan and make a copy of the house key." Mary smiled, "you don't need to put me on your plan, I-I can get my own plan." Cas started but Mary held up her hand to cut him off, "don't want to hear it, you're my son now, so you have to listen to me." She smiled more. "Thank you. For everything." Cas said tears filling his eyes, "no need, now take him upstairs before he get's a stiff neck." Mary chuckled and gestured towards her sleeping son.
“Charlie.” Cas sighed, “just go upstairs please.”
“What? Dean are you sure? Is it even safe?”
“No… I’m not really in a cupcake mood.” Dean said as he peeled the liner off of Herny’s cupcakes.
“That’s fine Dean. Whenever you want.”
"Just fine? I take it that's a good thing then?" Dean asked sounding tired and annoyed. "Yes, Dean. Everything is fine. There's no blockage or tumors. I just have to wait till the blood results come back." I said flipping through channels on the tv. "Kay, well I'm glad everything is fine. I ordered pizza for supper." "What kind?" "Half meat lovers half pepperoni with stuffed crust and a kid's cheese pizza for Mary." Dean said laying back down on the couch. The rest of the night went by quietly and Mary thankfully went down easily; Dean was already in bed so I got ready for bed in the bathroom.
Charlie groaned “don’t take forever. I want to play before Henry wakes up.” Sam just frowned and shuddered.
He pulled the Impala into the visitors parking area of the hospital and made his way to the NICU. Dean couldn't hold back his smile when he saw Henry sleeping in one of the pale blue onesie they had packed in the diaper bag. He silently pulled out his phone and pulled up 'Snapchat' and took a picture, saved it to his phone before sending it to Charlie, Cas, Sam, and Jo.
“Oh… Well, thank you.” Dean said. They said their goodbyes and everyone else decided it was time to go as well. Everyone gave hugs and one more round of congratulations.
“Hey Charlie, I uh met the delivery guy outside.” Gabe said holding up the bag of food.
“Y-you have a family?” Jessica asked.
Dean was about to say something when Henry tripped and face planted into the grass and started crying. Dean got up and walked over to Henry, who immediately clung on to him.
"CAS?!" Dean yelled, Cas was frozen, why was their pup gasping for air, there was nothing that could have caused him oxygen loss. "Dean, I-" Cas started but a few nurses came in. "What's the problem?" one asked and Dean was to hysterical to answer, "we don't know! Henry, he woke up and Dean was holding him so we-we tried feeding him and I changed his diaper and now he's gasping for air!" Cas rushed out handing the baby to the nurse and they both ran out of the room with Henry in their arms.
~0~0~0~0~
Sam explained and Mary had a gut feeling of what was going on.
Dean watched the two play for a while and as he watched the more connected he felt to the young omega. It was then, Dean knew what he was going to do with his law suit money.
Cas found him sitting at the table with his head in his arms, "here, you forgot these upstairs." Cas said holding out the glasses and Dean just blindly reached for them not bothering to look up, and Cas could hear a mumbled 'thanks'. He also couldn't stop starring at the slightly bruised bite mark on his shoulder. Cas was careful to place it where Dean can hide it with his shirt, kids at school didn't need to know they were mated. He let his eyes wonder down his arms taking in all the old scars of self harm and he felt a twinge of sadness run through him, "Dean?" Cas asked quietly, "hmm?" still not bothering to pick up his head, "I-I just wanted to say I'm proud of you." that got his attention, Dean slipped his glasses on and looked at Cas confused.
“I’m fine just having a bad day… I just really wanted to hear your voice.” Sam sniffed.
Cas’ eyes flew open, “are you sure? Because there is no rush.”
"Oh for fucks sake!" Dean groaned when they walked into the theater for practice. "Dean!" Cas gasped, "why is she fucking here?!" he hissed pointing at Amelia who was talking to Mrs. Rosen. "I don't know…. There aren't anymore parts in the play to fill.." Cas said grabbing Dean's hand so they could go on the stage. The backdrop and all of the props were almost done, Dean just needed to touch up a few things before things were ready to go next month.
'I don't understand it either. You're pathetic. He'll probably just fuck you then leave.' The voice started and Dean cringed a little, it had been so long since he's heard the voice that strangely sounds like his father. 'No, Cas, he-he wouldn't do that to me.' Dean argued. 'Yeah, keep telling yourself that omega. He's an alpha, all he wants is some wet hole to knot.' the voice continued.
Thank you all for the comments. They mean a lot more than you think :)
Dean heard rushed whispers coming from backstage so he rounded the corner and stopped in his tracks, Cas had his back to him and he was talking to Amelia. They were whispering about something and they were standing a little too close for Dean's comfort, then Dean's blood ran cold. Amelia swooped in and pressed her lips against Cas' and his hands went to her waist, Dean stormed off and he didn't see Cas push her off him or hear him asking 'what the fuck was her problem and to leave him alone.'
Dean gave a quick knock on the door and went inside. “Dean! Oh it’s good to see you sweetie.” Charlie’s mom said coming up to the two.
“Okay daddy.”
Dean got Charlie upstairs into her room and started taking her shoes off for her. “Red what’s going on? You haven’t smoked in a long time.” When he looked up he saw that Charlie was already asleep so he finished taking her shoes off and maneuvered her under the blankets.
They got to the hospital and one of the nurses took them to a room. Meanwhile, Mary was in the break room nursing a cup of coffee when a different nurse came in. "Um, Mary… Your son is room 4a. Your brother-in-law brought him in." The nurse said and Mary shot up, "what?! Oh my god what happened?!" Mary said dumping her coffee and put the mug in the sink, "I don't know." was all the nurse said before Mary was running for room 4a. She burst into the room scaring everyone in it. "Dean?! Oh god honey what happened?!" Mary said, "Ava, I can take over, thank you." she continued and Ava walked out.
"Yeah, we decided a while ago, we were going to wait and surprise you after they were born… Dean and I made the mistake of talking about it one time in front of Mary." I replied, "So, Henry and Lily…. Interesting." Gabe said, "yeah, Henry Michael after Dean and Sam and then Lily Marie for Charlie." I said "what are your own siblings not good enough to be named after?" Anna asked pretending to be offended. "Hey, you two are already Mary's godparents." Dean said. "Touché." Gabe smirked, "well we should probably get going." I said and left.
Deans eyebrows shot up, “uh we just had a few things we needed to do before coming over.” Dean said as he picked his son up.
John asked once he picked up, "good, there was no swelling in his brain but his arm is a different story. Dean's upstairs now sleeping." I replied,
to feel you inside me. Now." I panted, spreading my legs.
“I should be the sorry one. I should have stayed up with you.”
“I can’t talk anymore, I need to focus but just get to the school.” Cas said I love you and then hung up.
"What. The. Fuck. Is that noise!?" Dean growled attempting to roll over but ended up falling off the couch. "It's my phone." I grumbled searching my pants which were actually Dean's, once I finally found my phone I answered before the call ended. "Hello?" "Hey Cas, it's Sam. Sorry to call you so early but uh, Mary want's to go to the zoo. And we don't really have anything for her to go to the zoo so I was wondering when we could come by to get some things?" Sam asked, "uh, give us an hour." I said after a yawn and hung up. "What was that about?" Dean asked sitting up on the floor rubbing his eyes.
"I could if I needed to, but this is Tessa's specialty." Mary said and grabbed Dean's hand, "this will be a little cold." Tessa explained and Dean hissed at the cold gel on his lower abdomen, "alrighty. Let's get to it." she continued spreading the gel around with the wand. "Ah there you are!" She said and stopped moving the wand, "see that tiny little peanut form?" She asked and Dean just nodded, "that, my friend is your baby." Tessa smiled, "I'll print a copy for you." she continued and handed Mary a wipe so Dean could wipe his stomach off.
"Night." Cas hung up and checked the time, 9:30. "What did Gabe want?" Dean asked sitting up not even wincing this time.
"What brings you by?" She said, "to bring my
Cas stripped down to his boxers and carefully slid into the bed, he slid over and pulled Dean to his chest. "Everyone go to sleep?" Dean asked sleepily. "Yeah, Charlie and Dorothy are smushed together on the couch. They refused to let me set up the air mattress." Cas chuckled, "hmm." Dean hummed and tilted his head back to capture Cas's lips, "night. Love you." he whispered, "love you too." Cas whispered back and they both fell asleep, only to have Dean's phone chime.
I was sitting on the bed in my pj's reading when Dean finally came in, I put my book away and pushed my glasses up "how much candy did you eat already?" I asked "what? I didn't eat any. I'm not one of those parent's who eat their kids' candy." Dean said with his ears turning red, "uh huh." I smiled "just hurry up and come to bed so we can send this picture to Sam and Jess." A few minutes later Dean was in bed and I sent the picture with the caption 'Happy Halloween from your 4 favorite Winchesters and Squirt!' "I really do like this picture." I said looking at it on my phone. "I'm going to make it my background." I smiled and set it right as my phone started ringing and Sam's picture ID came up I answered it and put it on speaker.
“What papa?”
“Maybe I should go.” Benny said softly.
“You’re very talkative.” Dean sighed and saw Charlie walk by in the background, “Charlie!”
"Well alrighty then… Why don't you head on down to the pool and get some pictures." Bobby said handing him the camera. "Bobby, it's just practice…" Dean said "yeah, but it'd be nice to have a few candid ones too." Bobby said, "now go. Just bring the camera to school tomorrow, I'm going to the Roadhouse." "Okay, tell Ellen I say hi." Dean said and headed towards the pool.
“He was a little angel. In fact he just woke up from his little nap just a few minutes ago.”
“Bobby, Jo, Ash, Gabe, Benny?”
Dean rolled over and pulled Cas’ pillow closer before falling asleep for a few more hours.
“I haven’t heard anything about Amelia since she got out of jail.”
"Mama!" "What?!" I asked a little panicked when Mary shouted, "Squirt!" She continued and started breathing heavy. "Alright, calm down. I'll go get him." I said and I could see her start to calm. "What was that all about?" Dean asked when I came out of our daughter's room, "Squirt always sleeps with her at night and she doesn't like it when he's not up here so I'm going to go find him and bring him up here." I explained and moved the baby gate. I found Squirt curled up in the office so I picked him up and brought him upstairs and stopped just outside Mary's door listening to Dean talk. "Okay Mary, goodnight sweetheart. I'll see you in the morning okay?" Dean said softly, "night daddy love you." "I uh. I love you too baby girl, I really do." I came in the room right as Dean kissed her forehead, "okay here's Squirt. Sleep tight bug, love you." I said and pressed a kiss to her cheek, "night mama."
“Oh nothing. Just some yard work.”
"Dean, there was no reason to yell at her." I sighed and put Lily down in the crib and went to the bathroom to see Mary curled up on the floor crying. "Come here bug." I said and she ran over so I picked her up and rocked her a little. "Daddy didn't mean to yell. You just have to remember that for a long time daddy and I are going to be very tired and busy with the twins. But we still will have plenty of time for you. So if we ever snap at you, we're just tired okay?" I asked and sat her on the edge of the sink.
"Oh, I'm so happy for you guys." Mary said with tears in her eyes, Dean chuckled and slid off the table, "you going to be okay mom?" she just nodded and pulled Dean and Cas in for a hug, when they pulled apart Mary gently patted Dean's stomach, "okay Dean let's get you weighed then you can go to school." Mary said already walking over to the scale. "Good. You're weight is were it should be, now don't forget to meet at the Roadhouse after practice alright?" she said "yes ma'am." Dean smiled and they walked back to the Impala.
He opened Cas' and it was a picture of his lap and it read, 'he's looking better!' Dean replied, 'I know! hopefully he'll be home soon'. They snap chatted for a little while before Henry woke up; he blinked open his blue eyes and stared up at his father. "Hey baby boy… How are you today?" Dean asked softly and ran a finger over Henry's cheek.
"Humph." Dean sighed and signed the paper and handed it back to Mary so she could also sign it, "alright sweetie, you're discharged. Now, I want you to go home and take it easy. Paint, draw or just lay down and watch tv. Ellen will be here any minute to pick you up and she'll stay with you guys till I get home tonight." Mary said, "but I wanna stay longer." Dean argued, "Dean, I know you do. I do too, but you're mom's right, don't you wanna relax at
"Uh, Dean and I had another argument last night and he stormed out and didn't come home last night…" I said looking down at the floor. "Jesus, what is his fucking problem lately?" Charlie growled. "I'm pretty sure it's the stress of the whole baby thing. And probably the no sex…" I said, "no sex? what do you mean?" I turned red "Dean and I haven't exactly had sex since my last heat." I said quietly. "That's why he suddenly stormed out?" Charlie asked anger flashing in her eyes. "Well, kinda… I've been really stressed because I haven't heard anything with my blood results and so when I finally relaxed last night he wanted to and I didn't so he got pissed and left." I said quietly. "That's bull shit. He should understand and not act like a bitch." Charlie growled and let the subject drop.
“18, 19, 20! Ready or not! Here I come!” Charlie yelled and checked behind the curtains. “Okay, he might be better at this game than I thought.” Charlie said to herself and checked the downstairs bathroom, the laundry room, kitchen, dinning room. She even checked in his toy boxes before heading upstairs. She looked in every closet, bathroom and bedroom and she still couldn’t find him.
“I didn’t even realize I did it until it was done. It was like I was on autopilot.” Dean explained. “Also, I don’t know how you’ve slept in here lately. It reeks.”
Cas groaned and so badly wanted to slam into Dean but he promised to be gentle. He slowly started to slide in making sure to pause to give Dean time to adjust. Once he was all the way in
“No, no don’t say that word either.” Cas said quickly.
“Get dressed and come down for some lunch okay? Henry keeps asking for you.” Mary said softly, Dean just nodded.
"Daddy's home!" Mary squealed and met us at the front door. "Uh, yeah… Hi Mary." Dean said still recovering the shock that he has a daughter. "Good! 'souri made cookies! And and I eated 2 and, and we colored!" Mary said running out of breath and clinging to Dean's leg. "Well, it sounds like you had a fun day. Why don't we go back to the living room and see if we can't squeeze in a nap?" I said trying to pry the two year old off Dean's leg. "No! Daddy pick me up!" Mary shouted shying away from me and Dean shot me a panicked look, "it'll be alright Dean." I reassured him and he picked her up as best as he could with one arm.
“Me either.” Dean moaned and then came a few seconds later with a shout.
"Wow, are you going to forgive her?" Charlie asked, "I don't know… I mean, yeah it hurts like hell that they kicked me out and that their leaving. But I think what gets me the most is that they wont see Henry grow up." Cas said. The bell rang and the three went to their separate classes and Cas was still stuck on the fact that Henry wont know his grandparents.
“I want my baby to stop crying and to be happy.” Cas said softly.
“Just be careful.” Dean winked.
"Okay, Sammy's going to propose to Jess at Christmas, he gave me the money to put on my card so I could buy it so incase Jess looked at their statement she wouldn't see it." Dean said and I could tell in his eyes he was telling the truth. "Oh my god, that's so exciting!" I smiled and kissed Dean on the cheek, "I was starting to freak out." I chuckled.
Cas' heart was racing, in a few hours time he was going to be a father. Of course he knew it was going to happen, but here he was on his way to the hospital. He didn't even notice the truck stopped moving until Bobby called out his name, Cas snapped out of his thoughts and ran inside, "room 209, 3rd floor!" he heard Bobby call out.
“I beat the shit out of you once bitch. Don’t think I won’t do it again.”
"Cas?! Why the fuck is your alarm going of at… 3:30!? What the hell!?" Dean growled as I slid out of bed, "Hush, or you'll wake Mary. I need to be at the bakery by 5 and I still need to shower and I like wake up a little before I go anywhere." I whispered, "bakery? What bakery?" "You-you don't remember the bakery? Uh you and your family plus Gabe chipped in the money and bought me a bakery for my birthday. It's really popular now…" I said walking over to Dean's side of the bed. "Oh, well then I'm awesome if I bought you a bakery… So who's gonna watch Mary then?" I just stared at him and tilted my head a little, "Dean, you can watch Mary." I said gently.
When they got to school they started heading towards homeroom when Principle Crowley stopped them. "Boy's I need to talk to you in my office please." he said and walked off, Dean and Cas following. "Now, obviously you've seen posters around the school advertising for prom." Crowley started, "I've had multiple phone calls from parents having a problem with you two." he stated. "What? What do you mean they have a problem with us? We haven't done anything." Dean said getting angry, "uh, you've done enough Mr. Winchester, now I suggest you shut it and let me finish." Crowley snapped.
"Fine, after friday I'm put on house arrest." I grouched, "it's not house arrest Cas. You can still go places, just not work, and you can only go up and down the stairs when necessary." Dean jumped in. "Well to keep the twins from coming too early, I understand. If you need anything just let me know, me or Bobby can swing by anytime, hell, even Jo." Ellen suggested. "Thanks Ellen." I replied and she just nodded and went to go get our food.
“Alright. You can finish this tomorrow. I’m sending you to bed.” Cas demanded. Dean frowned but pushed his chair away from the island. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll put it away.” Cas said when Dean reached for his plate.
Dean had been gone for a day and I was already missing him; I had forgiven him the next morning but I didn't want to show it. I walked into the living room where Mary was laying on the floor with Squirt watching Toy Story, "Mary, how bout after lunch we go to the park?" I asked laying down on the couch, "yeah mama!" Mary squealed and snuggled up with me on the couch. When the movie was over Mary followed me into the kitchen so I put her in her high chair against the island and started lunch. "Do you want some Mac and Cheese Mary?"
They spent the rest of the afternoon talking about school and random things. By time 7:45 rolled around Cas started getting up. "Where you going?" Dean asked looking a little sad that his leaning post got up. "Sorry, but dad said I have to be home by 8 since we have church in the morning." Cas said, "I'll see you all monday." He said and went to leave, "Cas wait! I'll walk you out." Dean said and Charlie and Benny helped him up, they got to the front door and Dean grabbed Cas's hand. "I'm glad you came over, even though it was pretty embarrassing for you to having to pick me up off the floor... And you know.. uh my scars." Dean said looking at the floor. "I'm glad I let Charlie convince me to come over." Cas smiled and lifted Dean's head so they could see each other. "See you monday." Cas whispered and pressed their lips together.
Meanwhile, Dean had the tears stopped and took a
Dean pulled up the driveway of Cas's house and started getting nervous. "You ready for this?" Dean asked grabbing his mate's hand as they walked up to the door. They found Cas's parents in the kitchen, "hello boys." Bartholomew greeted them, "hi." Dean and Cas answered at the same time. "Um, mother… father there's something we need to talk about." Cas started, "alright…" Naomi said moving to sit next to her husband at the table and the boys sat at the opposite end. "Well… Um Dean and I found out that we are True Mates." Cas smiled, "oh, interesting." Naomi smiled, "how'd you find that out." Cas father asked and Cas felt Dean tighten his grip on his hand. "Uh, well.. I uh…" Cas struggled to find the right words so Dean just blurted out, "we know because I'm pregnant." then he turned bright red.
Freaking omnipotent Gods. Having a son who can sus stuff out like this that fast? Seeing past his bullshit. Let’s just say Dean’s glad he doesn’t have to worry about raising this kid anymore with how much he could pull over on him now.
(Author’s Note: Version 3 that a better writer could writer)
Dean shifts the bag on his shoulder and pretends he can’t hear the crash when his heart falls into his stomach. Maybe his ask was a little more difficult than Jack could do. The Empty is a different beast. Maybe the deal Ca-he made was more permanant than Jack could fix.
Cas caught Dean’s eyes and turned his head, which was totally not distracting or adorable in anyway. Screw his brain.
“Dean, its okay, you don’t have to say anything” Cas cuts in, giving him the out. He can see how uncomfortable Dean is.
He can’t ask for what makes him happy. He doesn’t know really anymore. All he’s known is pushing people away so they dont get too close and he gets them killed. But now? With God gone? He can make his own path now. There’s no more big bad. They defeated the biggest and baddest. They’ve got friends in the high places in Hell. They’ve got Jack now to keep Heaven in line. It’s hard to imagine going to salt and burn a grave right now when you’re the one who help save the entire world, scratch that world’s plural. He feels a little like Tony Stark right now.
His eyes flicker to Cas’ lips. They’re standing so close that theyre basically sharing a breath. Cue Cockblock Sammy coming in to hug Cas, of course, he’s happy to see him, they’re friends too. Dean has to take a step back, takes a deep breath in. He goes to hug Eileen while he’s at it, who throws him a knowing look. He’s got to look 7 shades of red right now, but he couldn’t care less. Jack did it.
Dean turned around to see his brother sitting up in bed, his face a mix of bewithered to be woken up to that sight and wonder. Cas simply scrunched his eyebrows.
Dean cleared his throat, trying to diffuse the awkward situation and to keep the self-depreciating thoughts from getting any louder. Cas may be falling, but he still has enough mojo to read Dean’s private thoughts, if he wanted to. Once he hears the shudder of the water turning off in the bathroom and his bag is full, Dean turned to the angel, taking a breath before meeting those burning eyes. Dean nodded his head towards the door and then grabs the keys off the table.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said reverently, like Dean just saved his baby or something. He refused the urge to roll his eyes or to blush.
He steps right into Cas’ space. He fiddles for a second and then reaches out and grabs Cas’ right hand with his own.
“Dean, aren’t you the least bit shocked? You’ve been sitting over there this whole time, doing nothing.” Sam said petulantly.
Jack smiles softly. Something about him is more etheral, beyond their reach, than he’s ever been, but he’s still the kid that has been dogging their steps for years now. “Dean. Sam. Thank you. For everything. You helped me see the world, the world that was worth saving. I love you both.”
****Version 2: Dean pulls him into a hug. Tightly. Turns his face into his neck. Cas stiffens at first, like he didn’t think Dean would come that close to him after that. Cue Dean pulling back with the biggest smile on his face.
Dean clears his throat and rubs the back of his neck. It’s quiet now that it’s just them. Sams door slammed a minute ago bringing with it any hope of distraction. Just him and Cas.
He gets stares still, him and Sammy always did, from the other hunters who are new to the bunker. Did these two really defeat God? The two guys who saved the freakin world, some hunters still say in awe and before they were sure how to talk to him and Sammy, seeing them too much as legends. But its been years. People see this bunker as their home now. Dean can walk through and get a beer and no one acknowledges him in the crowds besides a nod from those he’s friends with. It’s not necessarily his at all anymore. There are more randos than friends here anymore. A lot of the older crowd started retiring when they saw this place like it was, and got out of here, getting their own places with, fuck, more windows. Maybe Eileen was right. Maybe Dean could take a page from their book.
***Version 1: Dean just grabs him and kisses him. Sam’s mouth has got to have dropped behind them, but Dean doesn’t give a shit. No shit, Dean didnt fucking tell him anything other than that Cas died for them and seemed fucked up about it more than usual. Kinda out of the blue, that Dean would actually act on his feelings, but Sam’s seen this coming a mile away. He smiles at them and he just shifts Eileen to go with him to his room, arm around her, to leave them some space.
“You didn’t even let me say anything before you were fucking off again. Like always. Man I-“
Dean looks up sharply. He’s already lost in this convo. He shouldve grabbed a beer. Or seven.
Before he can decide, Cas seemed to have found whatever he was looking for and smiled. Not the small half smile he gives most of the time, but a full faced gleam, crinkling eyes, white teeth, the whole shebang. Dean’s heart did jumping jacks in his chest before melting.
Dean and Sam look at each other for a moment. The simultaneous hope building up and threatening to pour over. Did Jack do it? Could he do it? Sam grabs their bags out of the car and slams the Impala door. Hope has always been a double edged sword. Dean feels like he wants to scramble to the door of the bunker as fast as possible, but also man he could’ve really used the drive home instead of God mojo to suppress the hope budding in his stomach. With one last look back at Dean, Sam opens the bunker door.
“Yeah, well,” He said gruffly. Cas just continued to stand there, happy as a clam, and silence settled palpably. Sam’s shower was still running in the bathroom and someone slammed a car door outside the motel door.
He’s Cas’ kid alright. Freaky unending eye contact. Except right now he knows that God!Jack actually CAN see into his soul right now instead of figuratively. He shifts and coughs a little. He’s gotta know what Dean wants.
“Cas-I do-I gotta, fuck” Before he can overthink it, Dean makes the decision. He brings his free right hand up to cradle Cas’ cheek, stubble roughing against his calloused palms, and gives himself one last look in Cas’ eyes in a silent plea, a silent ask to let him do this, he’s asking him silently goddamnit to Please—a last chance to push him away before he makes a mistake, but he doesnt get anything except for Cas slightly parts his mouth in surprise and thats all Dean needs, he drops his mouth to his.
Later that night when he’s laying in Cas’ arms, he looks up and imagines he can see the stars through the bunker roof.  “Thank you,” Dean says quietly, turns it into half a prayer that he hopes Jack can hear. Cas snuffles a little in his sleep at the sound and Dean turns to him with a small smile on his face. Cas, asleep, hair tousled, rosy cheeks. He gets to have this. And he’s going to take every chance he’s got to keep it close. He hugs Cas tighter for a second and closes his eyes. He sinks quickly into a quiet deep sleep.
, the voice in his head continues. It’s beginning to become familiar, from a time where he spent time on a rack and where all he heard were screams for years and years. He shivered slightly, even if it was the middle of summer and beginning to hit record breaking heat at seven am.
But goddamnit he wants it. Dean pleads with everything he has that he gets to have it.
“I didn’t get to say this back there before you—“ Dean’s chest clenches remembering how Cas most recently died. “Cas I-“
He holds out two fingers on each hand to Sam and Dean’s foreheads. Blips them back to the bunker. Dean turns once to make sure Sam’s with him and breaths out in a rush when he sees him still next to Baby.
His brother pulled his hand away quick, shooting him a surprised and slightly pissed look. Then he looked at Cas and took a step back. He coughed and winced at how close he was.
*kissing again, Dean’s so happy, this is what true happiness feels like and he gets to have it!!!! cue them going to canoodle*
And Cas smiles wide too. It’s gummy and its beautiful and its all Dean ever wants to see. He can’t help but split into a grin of his own.
only grows stronger. Suddenly he doesn’t feel very hungry anymore.
Sam and Eileen talk to him and Cas soon after the wedding, while everyone has shuffled into different parts of the bunker, someone singing offkey to some song, a few in the kitchen opening yet another bottle of bubbly. They want to move out of the bunker. It’s been long enough. A house with more windows, I can’t take it anymore, Eileen says. Sam adds that it would be nice to have a space for some kids maybe, a dog. They want to get their life started. Dean tears up at that, and Cas grabs his hand. There’s a good hug Sam and Dean share when he let’s him know it’s okay, he’ll always be here for him. Maybe Sam could name one of his kids after his cool uncle.
Cas still has his wings, even though he hasn’t flexed them in awhile, and he thinks he’ll need some help.
He meets Jack’s eyes. “Yeah well. The one thing I want is something I know I can’t have.”
“I’ve been thinking. About leaving. Finding a place with some fucking windows. Getting a place just for us?”
“Dean,” He said simply, that gravelly tone making Dean’s stomach flip like he was 13 all over again. Dean sighed and lifted his eyes to take in the sight before him. Scruffy face, hair, and trenchcoat and full set of beautiful wings. Something he could look at forever, if he was allowed. But that would most definitely not pass for acceptable with an angel of the lord, so he forced his eyes away and onto the bed behind him.
*add Sam asking for Eilieen
Jack finally stops the freaky eye contact contest and closes his eyes easily and breaths out softly. He pulses with a little grace around the edges. Sam’s eyes are wide. When he opens them again, he’s smiling that gummy smile. He might be God now, but he’s still that same little Nephilim they found. And raised. The fo-three of them, together. They’re family.
“Uh, sorry, I mean,” Sam stuttered, rubbing a hand through his hair. “I’ve just never seen them before.”
“Dean I... It was the only way. There was no getting out of there with Billie knocking down the door like that.”
Dean tries again, he’s gotta get this out so Cas knows. “Everytime you leave man I. I’m lost. When Lucifer offed you last time I. God, I was a wreck. I thought that that time it would stick. And then we got you back, but then all this shit with God and Jack and then you fucking go and die again and I just never had the time or the fucking balls to say—“
He was taken aback when Cas actually
“Yeah, ‘course,” He replied and busied himself with making his third cup of joe, purposefully not looking in Cas’ direction. Dean eyed the whiskey on the counter, but thought better of it. 7 am is not a good time for whiskey, however much he wanted to calm the jitters in his hands.
Standing at the top of the library stairs is a familiar set of dress shoes, slacks, blue tie, blue-
, that
Jack tilts his head a bit. His chest hurts. It reminds him of Cas. The family he’s lost. Thelife he couldve lead. His future tilts out in front of him forever, for all he’s excited and elated for the future they just opened up for themselves, part of him holds onto the truth that it’ll be lonely and bittersweet. They’ve lost so much. He should be greatful. They just defeated GOD, he’s got Sammy, hes got Baby, theres kids running around in the street goddamnit. It’s a win. The Win. A big one. The last one. But it’s not all right. And for once, he wants to be selfish. He doesn’t want to keep being daddy’d blunt little instrument, stuck in a constant cycle of hunting and killing with no reward. They didnt kill God. They defeated him more soundly than in death, without more suffering.
One night Jody and Donna slip away while no one is noticing after one of the Fast and Furious movies, Dean’s lost count at which one they’re at.
Cas offered to get a job at the Gas n’ Sip again since, he says, he knows how to do that now, but Dean shuts that down. Cas doesn’t need to work. Dean can’t see him in that uniform again after last time, guilt still gripping his heart. They have a conversation following this, more of a constant back and forth of apologies for the shit they’ve put each other through in the past. That night, Cas makes it very clear in several ways how much he forgives Dean.
Sam gives him a thoughtful look as he gets in the back and Cas joins the seat next to him in a flutter of wings. But even though he can’t see them, the desire to
Cas agrees wholeheartedly. They don’t need to be there anymore. These hunters have got it. He kisses him deeply to let him know he agrees. Cas whispers between them that he would love to be able to build a greenhouse. Maybe get into beekeeping.
When he opens them again, the sky has a hazy tint, like when summer days are too hot, but the sun still shines and everythings beautiful. Its a little just too perfect. Cas opens the screen door and pauses to think where he could be. He listens more and he hears the sizzle of pans and maybe a low voice humming to himself.
it continued gleefully.
Dean cries when he sees Sam crying seeing Eileen coming down the aisle, it’s a whole chick flick. He’ll tease Sam for that later, but Cas tells him he has no right considering the amount of tissues he himself had to give Dean, too. Right now, he’s so happy that Sammy’s happy and getting what hes always wanted.
*Pan shot of them coming in from behind, looking down from the balcony.*
They’re kissing. Dean’s heart races, stepping impossibly closer to Cas, tightening his fingers into Cas’ hair and tugging him even closer when Cas doesn’t immediately reject him. Cas’ breath hitches and he stiffens for a quick second, enough to make Dean’s heart skip in fear, and then he fucking melts. He turns his head to deepen the kiss, chapped lips sliding softly but surely against Dean’s own. He’s trembling, or maybe that’s just Dean, they’re both in shock that they get to have this. That this is actually happening. Cas lets go of Deans hand to slide it around his back, pulling him in and Dean slides his other to Cas’ face.
Jack looks at him with a soft glint in his eyes. He doesn’t give an answer to that, and yeah Dean’s not sure he even could, but he needs to let the kid know they still want him.
Dean pulls back a bit. Theyre both panting a bit, not going far enough away that theres more than an inch of space between them. He never wants to get farther away. He wants to stay right here for eternity, if he can help it.
Damn, Cas and his attentiveness. It was true, Dean had been avoiding looking directly at them during the whole Sam/Cas exchange and had continued to avoid Cas’ eyes afterwards. He sighed and turned to face the angel. The wings were still magnificent, but he refused to take more than one eyeful. They were just too amazing. Dean didn’t trust himself not to run over to the angel and take a handful of black feathers. Or something worse. He cursed his libido and its ability to get roused at stupid times. He met Cas’ steady gaze.
Once theyre gone, Dean takes stock. The bunker is full and running at full capacity, hunters in and out, helping each other. It seems like the bathrooms are always full and actually he’s sick of the mess in the kitchen.
Cas has been journaling his existence. Dean and Sam already finished their Hunting Journals, which are somewhere with Claire and someone else right now. They told Cas he should write down some of the stuff he’s experienced, the different creatures he’s fought, but over several millenia, he ends up writing more tombs about human history he’s experience than anything else. Cas already takes up a whole shelf in the library of just his books. There’s a lot about Dean.
*****one choice could be Jack tries to make sure to needle out of Dean how to make this win perfect:
Is it selfish to just want him home? To nullify the sacrifice Ca-he gave so they could live, to have him there with him? Just because he said... what he said, doesn’t mean he would even want to come back.
Sammy and Eileen join years down the line. Because of freakt heaven magic, and a few of the tips that Cas gave Jack, Sam and Eileen’s house is just next door now. Dean and Sam hug with sad grins when the house plops into place one day and Dean knows Sam’s arrived. They figure out that the Roadhouse is also just down the road, past their parents house, Bobby and his wifes’, and everyone else down the other way.
“Cas I— I want you here man. I need you here, with us. With me. You gotta know that, right?”
“Hey Cas.”
Claire visits a lot, saying she’s just passing through for a hunt. She stops coming so much uninvited like that once she and Kaia settle down (she’s alive and they’re together in this fuck you CW writers). Then they just come for dinner and sometimes to one up Dean at pool at the Roadhouse.
Him and Cas’ room is still cozy. All their shit, their shared bed. But is this really home anymore? If Sammy can choose to have what he’s always wanted, why can’t he? He’s been pretty about it so far.
“Hey Jack, you uh. bring everyone back? Everyone God poofed when he Thanos snapped? Everything’s back in order?”
He looks down and takes a deep breath. Then he sees their hands intwined. He didn’t even realize he’d done it. But Cas didn’t pull away. He’s been silent this whole time, fingers carefully twined with his, barely even breathing clearly when Dean’s eyes travel back up. He meets Cas’ eyes, and theyre so full of... could that be hope? God he hopes he gets to have this. It gives him a little strength to keep going.
Dean goes to his closet and pulls out the ring he’s kept in his hunting duffel for a few months now, collecting dust in his closet since they haven’t had to go hunting in a while. When’s the last time he did? He had a shift at the garage last time Claire invited him to help hit a vamp nest. Months? A year?
Dean pushed past the angel and started to pack his bag for the day ahead. They can go out for breakfast and start interrogating some of the locals then. Maybe they’ll stop at the Mom and Pop diner he noticed as they drove in. It seemed quiet and one for passer-bys. A place where no one would ask too many questions.
Theyre laughing about something when they walk in, Cas in tow. Carry of My Wayward Son plays in the background from the Jukebox. Sam looks up and stops. Everyone in the Roadhouse is family, someone they saved, or helped, or knew. Freaky heaven magic again makes the room seem normal sized but theres no goddamn way they would all normally fit in the building. Dean smiles indulgently at Sammy and then grabs him by the shoulder to wrestle him the rest of the way in. Ellen’s behind the bar serving Bobby and Mary. Ash is doing something with the Jukebox in the corner, and Jo comes out of the back room. Everyone’s smiling. They clap and cheer for the two of them, three of them with Cas. People they saved and lived happy lives until they end up here clap Sam and Dean on the back, shake their hands. It might be cheesy but god they deserve it.
Theyre busy after all.
“Take care, Sam, Dean. This is your story now. Write it however you want it. And Dean? Tell him I say hi.” *or something like that*
Cas spends more time alone on the farm, taking care of the animals, enjoying life on earth. A few more years down the line, Sam understands immediately when Cas comes over for dinner one night with the house key in hand. Sam and Eileen have been alone in the house for a few years now, the kids old at college and working in the real world. Sam cries as he hugs Cas goodbye after dinner.
(Author’s note: From here a couple options I imagined)
They start opening the bunker up to more and more hunters
“I love you” Dean speaks to Cas’ lips. He meets Cas’ eyes, watery in happiness, bright and smiling.
Donna comes while the girls there, and cue lots of cute dinners and movie nights (a projector in the warmap room to fit everyone).
The one thing he can’t have.
He gets to the bottom of the stairs where Sam and Eileen are embracing and goes over to hug her too when the opportunity arises. The least he can do is be happy for Sam. This is what Jack saw for Sam’s happiness and he gets it now.
“Hello Dean.” He says gruffly. God Dean missed that voice. Within seconds he comes to the not-so-new conclusion that he never wants to go without hearing it again.
Dean ends up openimg his bar, the Roadhouse, in town. Hunters come in sometimes, to see the famed Dean Winchester, but mostly it’s just some locals who dont know who he is. What he’s done. It’s really kind of nice.
. The angel took a step closer to him and his wings turned up, the wings fluffing slightly.
Cas fiddles with the end of his coat. He makes himself meet Dean’s eyes. “If it makes you uncomfortable, I don’t have to stay here. I never wanted you to know, I knew it would make things awkward between us. I didn’t think I’d ever be back here to explain it.”
Unconsciously, though, Dean’s hand raised slowly, as if all on its own it thought it was a good idea to touch the wing or something equally as fucking stupid. Cas’ eyes tracked the movement, not moving. But once they got within a hair’s breadth of the outermost feathers, Cas hitched a breath and the black feathers shook and dropped away from his fingers sharply. Dean grabbed his hand back quickly like it had been burned, ears bright with embarrassment and shame. Cas stared at him, clearly surprised by either by Dean’s audacity or his own actions.
Lots of scenes of Dean and Cas being domestic. Lots of stuff Dean can show him about living life on Earth, in a way he never could before. There’s lots of stuff Dean finds he never could do before either, always in the road, in the hunting life.
“Cause kid I gotta ask you. I’m begging you. Bring him back.”
Starts with the end scene of 15x19 when they are in the road, when Jack brings everyone back and explains he’s gonna be new God:
“Let’s go get some grub, I’m starving,” He stated, pretending that the tension in the air isn’t thick enough to cut through. “Come on, you can sit in the front if you get there before Sammy gets out of the bathroom.” Dean huffed a breath and totally didn’t beeline for the door. And he certainly didn’t smack his head and then his palm on Baby’s steering wheel, trying to forget the confused and almost hurt look on Cas’ face as he left. He swallows away the burning guilt rolling around in his gut for running out on the other guy. Maybe some food will do him some good, get his mind off of things.
Jack stops and turns.
They walk into the Roadhouse together that first night (or maybe morning? time isn’t real in heaven). Sam’s happy that the Impala is in heaven to drive them there, but he’s unsure how a car could get into heaven.
Cas proposes over a candlelit dinner that Dean set up on the anniversary of meeting Cas in the barn. Dean was gonna use to propose first damnit Cas. He says yes of course though. They get married in a small ceremony with just a few friends/family members. Sam gets back at Dean when Dean cries seeing Cas at the altar.
“Sam!” Dean quipped, not wanting Cas to feel uncomfortable. If he had wings, he wouldn’t want someone touching them. It’d be like stroking his arm or something. Yeah, that’s the reason he yelled.
*****Jack gives Dean the tools to go save Cas from the Empty. One last fight. Cas has to become human to get out of the Empty, but there’s no hesitation, not with how Dean’s looking at him, how Dean’s here despite the fact that he had just convinced himself he would never see him again. Hurt comfort back at the bunker when Sam is off with Eilieen and Dean and Cas have the talk. Smoochin happens but it’s more emotionally charged after the fight against the Empty.
, he amended. They seemed to be emanating light, captivating and jaw-droppingly so.
Cas opens the door behind him suddenly, closing the door behind him. Dean tucks the box back into the side pocket before he shoots up quickly.
Sam coughs when he sees Dean looking at Cas and excuses him and Eileen. He can see how close him and Cas are standing and he does Not need to be here for whatever happens next.
Dean always knew Sammy wanted to white picket fence life. Wife two kids and a dog and now he’s gonna get it. He’s sad at first, but he knows its the right thing. Sammy won’t be going far.
“It is fine, Sam. I would be curious, too, if I were to see them for the first time.” The angel said kindly. Dean harrumphed. That was a little more than just curiosity, he thought, amused. Sam was giving those wings the once over. Sam looked over at Dean then, and frowned.
Sam hitches a breath. They just smile at each other for a moment, too over come with happiness. She’s alone, but alive.
, his brain added. He tells it to take a hike.
They house search and find a beautiful farm house not too far from the bunker. Cas loves the chickens, Dean does not. But he gets to live out some pretty wild cowboy dreams when he finds out theres horses they take care of too. Cas gets his bee boxes, and plants EVERYWHERE damnit cas in the bathroom too?
“Sam?” Eileen says imploringly. He splits into a grin and sprints down the stairs to cradle her face and bring her into a gentle kiss, only pulling back a bit to laugh in disbelief.
Cas turns red. And he brought up something Dean didn’t even wanna talk about. Maybe that means Dean’ll just ignore it. Then he could stay here still, even if it’s not in the way he truly wants. He’s grateful to even be back at all.
He cuts himself off, he’s frustrated by his own emotional constipation and inability to say what he means.
He steps closer. He gets a little desperate.
They start becoming more of info sharerers like Bobby 1.0 was (Specifically Dean. He takes after his old man—his true father figure, fuck John Winchester). Sam and Dean still hunt, but mostly the local stuff, or if they’re called out.
“Woah!” Another voice shouted. “Cas! Your-you have wings!?”
*Lay your weary head to rest. Don’t you cry no more*
Dean’s heart pangs. He was so sure the kid got it—
“Yeah we love you too kid” Sam wraps his long arms around Jack. Dean steps in second. He hasn’t done this enough, and might not again, depending on how Jack runs this God shit. He pulls back. “Hey I know you said hands off and everything but. You’ve still got a room with us. Drop in sometime for dinner, or like a movie or somethin’. Ya hear?”
“Hello, Dean”
They just took the biggest win they could’ve. Dean breaths in deep once. He’s allowed to be selfish this once.
Dean drops his bag, causing Sam to open his eyes and look to Dean sharply. Dean’s already taken two strides that it took to get to Cas, who was coming down the steps towards him.
The Road to See:
He sits on the porch and closes his eyes. He prays to Jack. He’s ready.
Ignoring the burning desire to grip the glossy feathers and never let go, Dean kept his eyes down.
Dean got a job downtown to get out of the bunker more with all the people there, fixing up cars at a local repair shop. He loves it.
Sam and Eileen are busy too. There’s their wedding that everyone sees coming, but sooner than later never hurts. Dean’s so excited to be best man. He cant say it hurts to see Cas in a better fitting suit, standing on Sam’s side of the altar too. (Dean doesn’t let him wear it for too long.)
“Oh, uhm, I’m very embarrassed,” He said as his ears flushed pink. Dean took another long swig out of his cup. “Normally I keep them in another plane of perseption, out of reach of humans. I wasn’t aware I was showing them.”
Cas comes over for a peck hello, but pulls back when he sees the weird look in Dean’s eye.
Sam huffs a laugh, probably in agreeance. Damn theyre getting old.
Cas sighs and steels himself. Dean’s heart rate stays high. “Dean, know that I never would have said anything if I hadn’t been the only way.”
, Dean’s brain bitterly finished for him. He tried to ignore why that makes him so angry.
Dean’s always kind of thought about opening a bar, like in that whirlwind that was him trapped by Michael. But better of course.
Jody and the girls come to visit and Claire wants to stay, become Woman of Letters and use the bunker as a jump off point. Dean feels older than ever with her there, remembering when he was that eager to be fighting the good fight. He’s glad to see she’s doing well with it though, and is kind of glad he doesn’t have to throw out his back digging up as many graves anymore. He can leave that to the kids. Claire and Cas grow closer and understand each other. When she walks in on them doing some heavy petting one morning while Dean was ‘cooking breakfast,’ after she stops laughing at their red faces, she makes sure to let them know she called this from the start.
His brain doesn’t shut up though, not even when he tried to divert the thoughts to the current hunt.
“Uh, sorry, Cas, they’re just really cool. Didn’t notice how close I got,” Sam said, rubbing his own arm subconsciously. Cas smiled softly and readjusted his wings slightly.
Cas looks relieved to hear that, but then looks away. It’s unlike Cas not to keep eye contact with Dean. Unsure of what to say to Dean. Unsure if Dean even wants to hear what he has to say, it he even wants Cas still at the bunker, with him in anyway.
If he could choose one thing to make him happy?
That reminder is what has him shifting to his feet, purposefully struding over so he gets in front of Cas. Cas is glued to the spot, eyes wide. He has no idea where this convo is heading.
Dean remembers that moment before Cas got sucked up by that evil black goo. He never wants to have that shit happen again. The fact of the matter is that he’s afraid. He’s afraid that despite whatever Cas said, he meant it differently. Or only as a farewell confession, never to be acted upon. He knows what it feels like when you’re near the brink of death like that. The amount of times he’s almost spilled his guts when he knew he was at the end.
“Would that make you happy Dean?”
*Jack blips them to bunker, let’s run it again.
, his ass, they were damn
“I gotta ask. Why’d you do it Cas?” Dean starts.
Cas simply looked at Dean quizzically before speaking. “Dean,” He started firmly. Dean swallowed hard at the gruffness of the angel’s voice saying his name. “You can look at my wings if you would like. I do not mind.”
“Cas, stop, wait a minute. I was talking about your self-sacrificing ass continuing to take the shots for me. Choosing to DIE to fix the problems I made.”
Hunters and Alternate Reality world folks, espcially the few that came with kids, listen to Cas recount tales from his lifetime. Dean’s chest tightens adoringly when he sees how much the kids love Cas. Cas just catches Dean watching and despite his confusion, smiles.
Dean never truely gives up hunting, but he finds it’s more fun the times he gets back when he can strip Cas down for a steamy shower after digging up graves than coming back to an empty, cold bunker ever did.
Cas shifted. “Are they not acceptable?” He asked quietly. “I know most of my garrison have bright, colorful wings and these are not the most appealing.”
Sam smiles towards Eileen and brings his hands up to speak that way too. “All Jack. He took God’s power for himself. He’s setting things right.”
Sam pipes up from behind him, closer than he thought. “You saved us, Jack. You saved the world. That’s on you. We owe you everything. Thank you. You’ll always be a Winchester to us.”
“Dinner’s ready!” A voice calls out. Dean comes around the corner with a silly apron on, something he always insisted that was gifted to him sometime or another and he didnt want to hurt the feelings of whoever got it for him so thats why he wore it. It makes Cas smile. Dean looks younger than the day he died. They were both old at that point, but this Dean is his soul. Eternally young, eternally beautiful. Cas is sure he must look younger than he did before too, because Dean smiles warmly at him.
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asked.
For now he can fix what he has.
He knows he’s just kinda standing there emotionally constipated in silence, but he sees the moment that Jack knows what he’s thinking about.
Dean sees Cas smiles indulgently. He knows his son will do a good job.
Shows Dean with a shocked smile, that Jack really is God, that he fixed all this, that they did it: “You did good kid. We’re proud of you.” He shifts, overcome with emotion of finally, FINALLY, being done with all this. And he needs to let Jack know he matters, that he’s family, in the way he has struggled to in the past. He takes a small step forward, not sure if he should touch the God in front of him, but needing to get his attention.
Dean started,
"Oh my god Dean." I whispered and walked to the side of the bed taking his left hand in mine. "They ran some tests today. They said the swelling in his brain has gone down but they don't see any signs of him waking up yet." John said quietly, "I'll leave you alone." He continued and left the room. I sat there in silence for a while just staring at Dean and rubbing circles on his hand, "you're gonna wake up. You're going to be up and walking around, playing with Mary like you always do. You're going to be awake to see our twins. Damn it Dean wake up! I can't do this with out you!" I said and broke down sobbing.
Half an hour later Dean, Mary and I left. "I think I remember promising a certain little girl Ice Cream if she was good today…" I smiled turning around to see Mary "yes!" she squealed. "Alright, let's go to the Roadhouse and eat then we'll get ice cream." Dean said. We were sitting in the ice cream parlor when I began to feel warm. I shrugged off my jacket and pushed Mary away from me a little, "Cas?" I looked up and Dean was looking at me funny.
"So, I was thinking. After dinner we could get out the photo albums and go through them and see if we can't trigger any memories." I said while pulling Missouri's casserole out of the oven. "That sounds like a plan." Dean said not bothering to look up from the puzzle him and Mary were doing on the living room floor. I dished out Mary's plate first and stuck it in the fridge so it would cool off faster and then dished out Dean and I's, "come and eat!" I hollered and Dean carried Mary into the kitchen and put her in the high chair.
Half an hour later, they were downstairs at the front door, once again in front of Cas' parent's. Cas handed over his phone and the keys to his father, "I've set up a court date Monday to take you out of our family." Bartholomew stated. Cas just nodded his head and they walked out the door with out a goodbye. Dean knew Cas was keeping a strong face for him but he could smell how upset he really was, "will you drive?" Dean asked and Cas just nodded.
“Me either Cassie. But he’s okay, you’re okay.” Gabe whispered. Cas cried for a few more minutes before pulling away and wiping his face.
It was my lunch break so I decided to call Dean and check up on them.
Dean suggested.
“Okay daddy.” Henry sighed and held his arms up so Dean could pick him up and get him into the bath.
“He… She… I can’t.” Dean wheezed, now in a full anxiety attack.
“Dean I’m not going to last much longer.” Cas panted.
Cas swallowed a growl and settled for a glare, "for the millionth time. Dean is my mate, I will do everything with him, if he doesn't feel like going to a party, then neither do I. In fact, I'd be more than content to stay home with him and our son." Cas stated and Amelia rolled her eyes.
Cas rolled his eyes and turned the tv on when the scent hit him, "is that a peanut butter and pickle sandwich?!" he asked looking disgusted, "yeah, it's pretty good actually…" he said and took another huge bite, "will you get me a bottle of water?" Dean asked. Cas got up and grabbed a water from the mini fridge when Lucy started barking upstairs, "I'm assuming that would be Benny and Charlie." Cas said handing Dean the water.
~_~_~_~
"Hey baby, what's up?" Dean answered on the third ring, "Not much, are you still at the mall?" "Yeah, why?" "I need you to pick up enough chicken wire so we can wrap it around the tree like a fence. Gabe said we used to do it when I was little. That way we can put the gates back on the stairs." "That's actually a really good idea. But the way this day is going, I need a beer, so I was thinking we could go to the Roadhouse." Dean suggested. "That's fine. Don't forget my brownie." Dean laughed "I won't see you later, love you." "Love you too." I said and hung up. "I heard something about brownies." Gabe said coming into the kitchen. "Yeah, I told Dean to get me one of those big brownies they have at the mall." I said getting the things to make tea.
As the night progressed the whinier Henry got. “We should get him home.” Dean said as he bounced back and forth with Henry half asleep on his shoulder.
“Yes dear.” Cas chuckled “text me when you’re outside.”
“The night sky was infinitely brighter and closer before man made their own lights. Men have been looking to the stars for ages.” Castiel shrugs. Instead of focusing on nebulae and other faraway galaxies, he turns the scope towards the moon, ruddy and full, it is filled with fascinating detail. “Here, try this instead.”
“I don’t need a fancy degree to tinker with machines,” Dean scoffed. Most of what Dean did was self-taught, as natural and instinctive as breathing. “I’m not gonna need to make those machines anyway because I left that behind. Why do you want me to learn stuff I ain’t gonna need?”
, and my alphas
Castiel let that statement hang in the air before he said, "So how did you ever manage to get the String of Pharzuph? And the equivalent of my grace?" There was another long moment of silence, wherein Castiel got the dreaded feeling that it was an answer that he wouldn't necessarily like.
Dean hated this part, but he gave Castiel’s arm a reassuring squeeze. “I’ll try, Cas. At least, you know I have a temper, now,” he joked, but it fell flat. Castiel looked at him through his eyelashes, his eyes narrowed before Dean straightened and intertwined their fingers. “I promise I’ll try. If it happens again, just give me some space, okay?”
"It's the principle of the thing!" Gabriel protests.
, Kevin’s voice reminded him. Grinning at the discovery, Castiel held on to the rails.
Balthazar snorted. “There’s few who’d accept days of travel from Caelum to New York instead of the three-hour flight. You know she’s a cargo ship and not a cruise liner?”
“NO!” Henry yelled and hung on tighter.
3 days had gone by since Dean’s been home and he hasn’t left his room. If Henry wanted to spend time with Dean, he would have to go in there and play quietly on the bed while Cas took care of them.
“I know but I feel like a guest here. I love you guys don’t get me wrong but it’s
Bobby choked on his water and Ellen thumped him on the back while Dean buried his face in his hands.
I stepped in and was almost knocked off my feet by John, "shit, sorry Cas. Are you okay?" John asked once I regained my footing, "yes, sorry I should have been paying attention." I said, "um look Cas… I'm gonna give you some warning. Dean looks a hell of a lot better than he did when you two were brought in, but it's still pretty rough." I just nodded my head and walked closer to the bed and gasped when I saw him. Dean was lying there with tubes hooked to his arms and he had an oxygen mask covering his mouth and nose; his face had many cuts and and bruises and Dean's right arm was in a thick cast.
"Come on, it's Christmas, smile." Cas said walking up behind Dean who was figuring out what flannel to wear. He wrapped his arms around his middle and traced lazy circles on top of Dean's stomach, Dean sighed and relaxed into Cas' arms, "I know… Stupid hormones are starting to get crazy." Dean said moving out of his boyfriend's arms to finish getting dressed, deciding against the flannel, knowing Jo will be all over him, so he just settled for a black v-neck. "Boys, let's go!" Mary yelled from the top of the stairs, "coming!" Dean shouted back grabbing his phone off his nightstand and Cas' hand.
"It depends on the pregnancy honey. Some last a month or two, some it lasts the whole 9 months." Mary said leaning up against the door frame and Dean just let out a whine. "I'm sorry baby, I'll be here as much as you need me." Cas said, "no, fuck you. This is your fault." Dean said moving away from Cas, who was stunned. "Dean Michael." Mary scolded, "this is equally your fault too. Now, believe me, I
“Because I want to. So, shut up and deal with it.” Dean replied. “Do you really not want to spend time with me? Because Mom can still take you.”
By time lunch rolled around Dean was still tense "hey, you gonna tell me what happened?" Cas whispered while they were still alone. Dean sighed and played with a few fries. "I ran into Alistair on the way back to class." Dean said and he felt Cas stiffen, "relax. He didn't do anything he just was his usually talkative self… I handled it." Dean said patting Cas' thigh. "What did he say?" Cas asked, "just that I won't be able to hid my bump much longer and that he wished I didn't try to do it now." "I'll kill him." Cas growled. "Hey! No, calm down. He's a dick bag, don't kill anyone. We kinda need you." Dean said smiling a little and patting his stomach. Cas smiled a little but was still upset.
"For what?" Cas asked and started carding his fingers through Dean's hair; "that I couldn't keep him in full term. Because of me he's early and I don't know if he's going to be okay." Dean said shakily. "Dean, it's not your fault, you got to stressed because I was to much of an ass to not notice your pain. Please, don't blame yourself." Cas said, he continued to run his fingers through his mates hair and Dean slowly drifted to sleep.
“That would be much better.”
Dean left his session feeling better about Henry being in the NICU and he immediately went to the elevator to see him. Cas had to go back to school today and Mrs. Tran, Dean's tutor, was going to meet him at the house in about an hour.
friend red.
Let me know what you guys think! Comments are always appreciated!
"Shit! This fucking hurts!" Dean groaned not caring about cussing in front of his mom, Cas wiped away some sweat. "You're doing good baby." Cas soothed, "fuck you Cas. You're never touching me again!" Dean sobbed and pushed again. "Keep going Dean, keep going!" Tessa encouraged, "I can't, it hurts too much." he whimpered.
“Since the miscarriage?”
After the session, Dr. Hansen was going through his notes, "well Dean, things are starting to look good, I would like to see you just once next week. After that we can see if we can go back to every other week." he explained. "Okay, thank you." Dean said and met Cas outside, "how'd it go?" Cas asked after giving Dean a kiss, "good. I'm going to see him next Wednesday, then he'll determine if we can go back to just every other week." Dean smiled grabbing Cas' hand.
“Fuck. Okay… Henry and I were playing hide and seek and I can’t find him. I am so sorry.” Charlie started crying.
"Mom, I don't know what to wear!" Mary groaned and threw another shirt onto her bed, "do you know where Anthony is taking you?" I asked moving over to her closet, "we're just going to the Roadhouse and then the movies." I rummaged through her closet and pulled out a black tank top and a green flannel shirt. "Here, wear this with your skinny black jeans. The green will make your eyes pop." I said handing the shirts over.
“I don’t know why you’re taking me.” Sam grumbled as he threw his bag into the back seat of the Impala.
~0~0~0~0~
“I’m never going to be able to find a mate.”
“Don’t yell at me. If you want it hard I’ll give you hard.” Cas growled and pulled all the way out before slamming back in and started a fast pace.
"Mama I get to see baby?" Mary asked from her carseat, "yes sweetie you get to see the pups. Remember there's two?" I said and then focused back on the road. "Cas? Can we stop at the auto shop on the way home?" Dean asked, "sure… Why?" "I uh. I wanna see the Impala." Dean said quietly. "Dean I don't know if that's a good idea… She's in pretty bad shape." I said and reached over to grab Dean's hand. "I know, but hey, maybe I'll remember things." We arrived at the clinic 5 minutes later and we were able to go right back.
“Ugh fuck.” Cas grunted from Dean tightening around him. His knot was quickly swelling. “Do you want me to knot you?”
“Papa can I has milk please?” Henry asked shortly after Dean and Charlie left. Cas filled up a small glass and handed it to Henry, where as most of the time he did drink out of a sippy cup, there were trying to get him to learn how to drink out of a normal glass.
Hey guys, I know this is a short one but I wanted to get something out here for you. I think there's going to be one more chapter left! And I do have lines from the movie that will be in italics! ENJOY! <3
“Why do you say that?” Dean asked.
"True, okay. I'll be home by 1:30 just let me get things settled here."
“I will papa.”
"I know this is hard, it's hard for me too, but you heard Tessa today, if Henry keeps improving the way his is, he'll be home in no time." Cas said moving closer, "I know… I just want him Cas, I wanna hold our baby." Dean said and let out a sob, "s'all my fault." he sniffled. "It is not your fault. Please don't blame yourself baby." Cas said and helped Dean out of the chair. "Come on, let's finish eating then we can come back down here for a nap." Cas suggested and Dean just nodded.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and gripped the edge of the sink. “Shut up, shut up!”
“One, I’m underage. Two, your mate is a cop. Three, I don’t want to.”
"Hello again Dean." Tessa greeted, "hi." Dean smiled a little, "ah, you must be Castiel." she smiled and shook his hand, "you ready to see your baby?" she aced and they both nodded. "Okay, but before we start, I just wanted to let you know Dean that your test results came back good." she stated and squirted the gel on Dean's stomach making him flinch a little. "There it is! Little one's getting bigger, which is good." Tessa said once she found the baby, "Dean." Cas gasped, "I know." was all Dean had to say.
“Something isn’t sitting right with me. Why does Henry have your phone and a bowl of grapes when he should be eating supper?”
Cas came back out a few minutes later with a tray full of stuff and before they could start a conversation Dean’s phone rang. “Hey Sammy. What’s up?” It was quiet for a few seconds before Dean spoke again, “Sam?”
After supper Dean and Cas went downstairs with Sam and watched a movie. Half way through the movie Dean was practically asleep with his head on Cas' lap, when he felt a weird fluttery movement in his stomach. His eyes flew open and he sat up placing his hand on the spot he felt the movement. When he felt it again, it was stronger and he gasped. "Cas! Cas!" he practically yelled, "what?! Dean what's wrong?!" Cas asked starting to panic, even Sam was starting to freak out when they saw Dean gripping his stomach, "give me your hand quick!" Dean said already yanking Cas' hand towards the side of his stomach.
“Okay. See you in a bit.” Sam said and hung up. “You’re such a jerk.” Sam told Dean.
“Charlie, listen to me. You texted me during that horrible time, that was enough for me. Besides I probably wouldn’t have wanted you around me just because I didn’t want anyone around me not even Cas. And for you wanting to live with us, Charlie, we would love it if you moved in for a while until you got back on your feet. If you don’t want to then Cas and I agreed we will help you get an apartment. You’re my
"Cas!" Dean sobbed "I-I no!" he started panicking. "Dean, shh, it's okay we're going to stop it, I need you to move for me okay?" Cas soothed and they got Dean in Mary's car where she and Sam were waiting and drove to the hospital.
“What?! Charlie, I’m so sorry.”
I heard Dean running through the house and up the steps and he was greeted by me naked on the bed slowly stroking myself. Dean growled and yanked off his clothes and practically jumped on the bed; "you smell so good when you're in heat. So sweet, sweeter than usual." Dean said kissing my neck causing me to moan. "You talk to much." I said moving to kiss him then pushed him off to get on my hands and knees.
“Well I’m happy he was there and that you’re mostly okay.” Dean said softly and gave her a small hug. “Can you give me some detail of what he looks like so I can get a sketch down?”
“Noooo. I want one nowwwwww.” Henry started crying.
Cas said quickly.
The five of them talked and ate for a while when Henry came up.
"Okay, uh. She should have everything she needs, but you know where the key is." I said once we dropped Mary off at Johns. "Cas, babe, she'll be fine. We're going to be gone 4 1/2 days. Not a month." Dean said tugging on my arm gently. We got in the Impala and Dean headed for the interstate, "oh baby, how I missed you purr!" Dean said patting the dash and I just laughed at him. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30, "whatcha say Cas? Wanna head out and grab something to eat and then tonight we can get room service?" Dean asked. "Sure, let me go to the bathroom first." I said.
Dean pulled up to his house and the walked in finding Mary in the living room, "so Cas… Why did Dean need to come pick you up? You're not sick are you?" she asked getting up from the couch and checked his forehead. "No Mary, I uh… I've been suspended till Monday." Cas said avoiding her eyes. "For defending me, and possibly beating the crap out of someone." Dean smiled kissing Cas's cheek as he passed by to sit on the love seat.
“Oh! Well, would you and Dean like to come over for dinner tonight?”
Cas wiped Henry’s tears away and kissed his cheek. “Give daddy and papa 10 more minutes to talk and then we’ll get you a cupcake okay?” Henry bargained.
Cas felt a little disappointed that Dean was upset with him but he brushed it off and trudged through his day of school.
“I dunno, but I gots grapes.” Henry said and showed Dean the bowl.
“I love you more.” Dean gave him one more kiss before disappearing into the house. He practically ran up the stairs, carefully laid the suit on the bed and went into the bathroom.
Later that night, after everything was cleaned up, Dean and Cas sat on the couch and were watching a movie when the front door slams open scaring them both.
All Henry needed was a diaper change, so once Dean got him situated, he made his way to the bedroom. Before he got the door open he could hear Cas talking, "I miss you too… He's doing good… He is, he's been home about a week now." Dean heard him let out a small chuckle and that's when he pushed the door open; Cas was sitting cross-legged on the bed with his back against the headboard.
"Sure, what do you need help with?" he asked putting down the chips, "well, there's this new girl in my class and her name is Jess… And she's like super pretty, and the spring dance is coming up and I want to ask her… But I'm afraid she, well and her parents are going to be like most of my friends." Sam said, "what do you mean like most of your friends?" Cas asked, "well, they still talk to me at school and stuff, but their parents, besides Andy's don't want them coming over and stuff because of Dean… So I'm just afraid that Jess' parents are going to be the same." Sam explained.
“Always am. I’ll see you later bud.” Cas said and kissed the side of Henry’s head before strapping him into the carseat in the suburban.
"What time's your therapy?" Cas asked, "uh, 3." Dean said looking at the clock. "Are you going to go back to every other week or are you staying to twice a week?" Mary asked, "I don't know, Dr. Hansen said he'll determine it after today's session." Dean said putting toast in front of him and Cas. "Where's Sam?" Dean asked noticing that he wasn't down here, "still sleeping." Mary said.
Everyone looked at Dean, expecting him to be all over the pie. “I’m okay for now. You guys can have some. I’ll wash up these dishes.”
“Love you.” Dean hung up the phone and relayed everything to Cas. He sent a quick text to his mom saying to give him a call when she gets a chance.
"Okay, well… Dean and I found out that we're True Mates." Cas started, "that's awesome! Is that what this whole ordeal was about?" Gabe said a little confused, "no, but if you shut up and let me tell you." Cas glared and took a deep breath, "the reason we found out we're True Mates is because Dean is… Dean's pregnant." Cas said looking at his brother.
“YAY! Let’s swim daddy!”
Dean set a now sleeping Henry in his crib when he felt Cas' arms wrap around him, "you know, he sleeps for about a good hour an half." Cas whispered and started kissing the back and sides of Dean's neck. "Cas." Dean whined and tilted his head to give his mate more access.
“Good. I’m glad honey.” Ellen pulled him in for a hug.
Henry started fussing so Cas quickly stood up and started pacing in front of the window, slightly bouncing his arms. "Shh, papa's got you." he whispered and felt a surge of pride when the pup calmed down. A few minutes later there was a small knock and when he turned around there were multiple heads poking in, "can we come in now?" Jo asked; "yeah, just be quiet, Dean's asleep." Cas whispered and everyone piled in, "Mary already told us the news." Ellen said, "yeah, but he's healthy, that's all Dean and I care about." Cas said and handed him over to her.
“But daddy say it.” Henry frowned.
“Thanks mom.”
“I’m sure he will be.” Cas said while rubbing Dean’s back.
"Bedroom, now." Dean hissed and started pushing Cas out of the nursery. They made their way, very clumsily, to their bedroom. Cas could start to smell the thick aroma of apples "oh god." he moaned and almost ripped Dean's shirt off. Once the shirt was gone, Cas started mouthing at the mating mark. "Of fuck." Dean moaned and almost collapsed into Cas' arms, "too many clothes." Dean complained and started yanking Cas' clothes off. "Cas, please." Dean continued to moan "I love it when you beg." Cas moaned and started to push in when Dean stopped him, "wait! Condom." he panted "right." Cas nodded and ripped open the box and grabbed one and slid it on.
Lucifer then flicked his finger again and the bottle flew from his care to Dean, who barely caught it with both hands. "You have what you came for, Dean Winchester. Now go do that silly spell of yours before your ingredients lose potency. I
Dean looked at the vial and realized that it was a set of lenses. “I couldn’t—”
receive it. The Blood’s day of reckoning is coming, and you will be an instrument of the Light.”
Castiel needed air. His lungs weren’t working correctly. The music and the guitar continued about him, but Castiel never regained his equilibrium. Thank god Sam returned with drinks, and Castiel downed half of his in one gulp. Dean would be the death of him.
Dean was on his third beer, Sam had left them, and Castiel was staring at his second bottle, which was definitely two bottles over his limit as a human.
Castiel's grace had powered Metatron's Spell, so his grace had been taken from him and then changed, as the First Fall had changed Lucifer's. Unlike Lucifer, however, Charis had been purified again and again in the rivers of fire. Castiel stilled and looked on to the angels still scattered on the Earth, with the easy flick of power, seeing the thrum of their grace, the taint of the Fall, washed away. Their wings were starting to mend, as they had not appropriately recovered while Metatron's Spell had been in effect. "The counter-spell was enough for purification. Purification is separate from the Gates."
Dean snaps up the book to skim the summary and take the picture. Now that he was aware of the guy, Dean notices that he’s been on the receiving end of several side eyes from him, which Dean ignores. They were both customers in a very large bookstore, they could get along. Besides, he wasn’t the one wearing a flasher coat in the middle of Christmas season.
Gabriel still looked unconvinced. They were losing him.
far away, you know. And I’m sure he wants to talk to you.”
"Get the fuck out of the third heaven, dickbag."
Charlie gave him a tour of the engine room, including another opportunity to admire Dean at work. Castiel didn’t bother to disturb him.
The Sanctuary John picked is on the outskirts of the towns that surround the base of Mount Ararat. Abandoned because of a previous landslide, there are caved in sections filled with snow. But the inner rooms are intact, and they head towards the center of the Sanctuary, where the Altar lay. His dad makes quick work of the wrought-iron gate, ushering in Cas and a sleepy Jack followed by Dean.
“Don’t you wanna see what Bobby and Dad always talk about when Bobby comes to bring salvaged parts?” Dean cajoled, trying a different tack. “The time when he jumped trains across America. Driving through all that flat country. They do call America the land of the free.”
Dean leaned back to give Gabriel a glare, Gabriel gave him a salute using his goblet of wine before Dean shook his head and dropped the ring back on the napkin. “Haven’t you killed me enough times already?”
a lifetime ago. "Yes."
So there, Castiel and Cassiel are two different angels. During the transliteration of Castiel (Katzpiel, etc) scholars stumbled along the way and merged him with Cassiel (Kaphziel, Quafsiel, Kafziel, Casziel, Casiel). Transliteration means going from the Hebrew alphabet: ' קפציאל ' to the Roman letters 'Cassiel' as opposed to translate which goes like: love = amour = ai which can all be Romanized. For the fic, I took liberties and made them one angel.
add anything from the top 10 hits,” John proclaimed.
“Dean,” she said as she stood. When his arms wrapped around her and his chin rested on her hairline, she visibly relaxed and exhaled a sigh.
“Come on, I found a ride where they’ll let you take your stupid bag on with you,” Dean said with a teasing grin as they walked where Dean led.
Dean usually secures his traps in the morning after a work out with the hunters. He then attends various engagements that his mother foists upon him during the day, followed by shadowing his father, meeting with the villagers to see to their crops and help with their roofs. It is during one such trip that Dean and the stranger cross paths.
Before Sam said anything more, Dean opened the door with a snap, leaving Sam in the bathroom with his thoughts.
Mary touches his arm tentatively, startling him from the memory. Troubled, John kneels beside her and takes Dean off the floor, kissing the boy’s forehead before pulling him up in an embrace. Dean stirs, angling his head towards Mary for a while before settling in his father’s arms.
He turned to come face-to-face with the smarmy dude who was with Castiel on the wings. Frankly, Dean was offended Cas chose this guy, with his million and one crow’s feet, the weird half-beard, and that pretentious accent. “Who wants to know?”
. I kept flashing back to their sweetness during the ACL festival and couldn’t help but channel them onto Dean and Cas.
"So what do you think has been taking the children? Wolves?"
Castiel clears his throat before they get into their brotherly bickering this early in the morning. Though it is expected with brothers living together well into their forties and in forced close quarters, it would set the mood for the rest of their day. “I was planning to go to the supermarket. We’re almost out of coffee and some fresh produce, so if you want anything, just write it down, and I’ll pick it up.”
“Good to know.” Dean chuckles. “So am
Dean rolled his fingers to conjure up chalk. He then meticulously copied down what Ash had given him while he was still recouping from Charis and Metatron. Ash had given him the Enochian words for purity and forgiveness. Dr. Badass threw in the word love because it was apparently the working theme for Metatron's Spell and it couldn't hurt.
Castiel blinked in the middle of what he supposed was the equivalent of struggling road, parsed together by experience and the usual expectation of what the axis mundi was. He looked around but there was no path, no angel, but there was the North Star that hung unassuming in the night sky.
He continues his browsing by adding
than the Red.”
"I would have had a hard time finding my way around Heaven too, but I think some stoned angel went down to Earth and created
"Being dickwad's prom dress doesn't give me a free-for-all pass in Heaven, Cas," Dean said incredulously, putting down the now empty bottle of beer on the table in favor of closing the books in front of him.
The words and Gabriel's grace wove through the Song and brought even those outside their little grassland tree with them. Most who could lend their voice and their strength to polish the weave and make the spell whole started to take up the incantation. The tree took up the sigil's brightness and began to look like it was becoming superimposed with a larger tree. Castiel closed his eyes because the visual was making him dizzy with his human eyesight.
“Where are you going after this?” Castiel asked. Because they couldn’t end here as strangers, never to meet again. “Palo Alto to visit Sam?”
The sharp cry of an angry horn behind him snapped Dean out of his haze. Blinking, Dean realized he was drifting about 40 yards behind the car in front of him. Irritated, he eased the gas pedal and the Impala responded in kind, quickly closing the gap between the vehicles.
Dean jerked his eyes up, guilt plastered across his features, and was met with those pale pink lips stretched in an amused grin, the dark blue eyes squinted with a touch of mirth as they watched Dean’s face go crimson in the dim lighting.
“Woah there! You okay?”
Thank you for reading! I appreciate each and every one of you. You are all beautiful and lovely and have I mentioned you look amazing today? Stunning.
“C’mon trusty handmaiden. Let’s go get you some pie!”
“So,” Brittney started, glancing over to where Dean was walking just out of reach. “What are your plans for the rest of the night?”
They hadn’t bothered him in years, since he and Cas left Rail Pass behind. The pain flared again like a knife, cutting across his side and causing him to punch his fist against it, trying to staub the pain. Gasping and choking, swallowing against the bile rising in his throat, Dean clawed at his mind, forcing himself to control his breathing.
Except the smell of sweat and musk and warmth, like sunshine and honey, that was wrapped around Dean just as tightly as those arms.
Charlie bounced out the door to her apartment and down the few cement steps on her way to the big, black Impala sitting idle along the curb. She was about two bounces away from the passenger side door when she drew up short, suddenly coming to a stop and staring in confusion at the interior of the car. There was someone in her seat. Well, there was the back of someone in her seat, anyway. Dean hadn’t said anything about bringing along a date to the show, but based on the fact that neither of them had separated from sucking face long enough to notice her arrival, she could guess that Dean had freaked out and brought along whatever flavor of the month….ah, who was she kidding, week, that he had lined up. She rolled her eyes (not like they were paying attention to be offended anyway) and sidled up alongside the door. She watched the couple for a few more seconds (she would have put good money on Dean being able to tell her how many cavities the blonde in the front seat had) before she rapped sharply on the hood of the car. A grin plastered over her face as she watched them jump apart, looking for all intents and purposes like they had been caught with their hands in the cookie jar. Which, thankfully, she had gotten here prior to any roaming hands action.
“Smooth, but I’m fairly certain we’re long past pretending I didn’t see anything.” Charlie admonished. Nothing like making her bestie sweat a little bit. Speaking of making him sweat… “Making your Queen sit in the back of the royal carriage, I see? She said in the most disapproving tone she could muster which, admittedly, wasn’t very disapproving, narrowing her eyes at him.
Well shit. Apparently Dean was still not in full charge of the brain-to-mouth motor controls. He blinked at Charlie through thick, heavy lids for a moment before her words really registered.
Warm, wet lips engulf the head of his cock, eliciting a deep grumbling moan from his lips. Dean squeezed his eyes shut tighter as the soft heat slid down his shaft, then back up again, shocking sensations throughout his body, the tingling making his toes curl. Strong hands rub up his naked thighs, their hot, calloused skin leaving trails of fire where they swept across Dean’s body. The mouth pulls back slightly, twisting the tongue around the shaft as it drags up towards his tip, and Dean’s legs twitch involuntarily, squeezing against broad shoulders. Another moan is ripped from him as the mouth drops down again, taking him down to the root, pushing his length into the depths of the throat.
It is only Wednesday, he doesn’t have another final until Friday morning, and with Dean gone the apartment is all his. Aside from studying, Cas has no other obligations, no one waiting for him or expecting anything. He feels...free. Grinning to himself, he leaves his dirty dish in the sink and decides to head in, take a shower and spend the day catching up on the Netflix shows he’s been letting slide in favor of not failing out of his Junior year. He has one test the next day, then the rest of that night to study. He figures he’s earned the night off. Just before he heads to the en suite bathroom, he grabs his phone, intent on plugging it in to charge. He glanced down at it and can't stop the smile that spreads across his face when he sees a notification from Patrick.
to know
The first chords of the familiar music struck and Dean felt a smile split his face. He would recognize the opening music from Star Wars anywhere, even this version which seemed to be some sort of techno remix. As the music began to gain momentum, a pair of men walked on from opposite sides of the stage, both holding what look to be wooden dowels, roughly the same height as the men. One was clad in some sort of white robes, the other black, and both had their heads covered by the hoods on their robes. Almost immediately they began swinging the sticks in a well choreographed fight, perfectly executing a mesmerizing and complicated pattern, nearly striking each other but somehow always just a tiny bit apart.
“I hope you had a good time tonight, Dean,” the man said. “Perhaps I will get to see you again. Enjoy your pie.” And with that Angel let go of Dean’s hand, and melted back into the crowd.
“Soooo…” Brittney draws out, seeming to be trying to make a decision. She squares her shoulders and raises her gaze to meet his eyes, and Dean sees the flash of resolve across her face before she continues. “Would you like to move this to my bedroom?”
“Now THAT would be one hell of an evening…” Gabe muttered, and Dean found himself chuckling. As annoying as Gabe was, he had to admit it was still miles better than standing here drinking alone. So Dean bit the bullet and opened his mouth. “What brings you here?”
He had seen the seasons change his whole life, and from every side of the continental U.S. But it was more meaningful here, somehow. More...vibrant. From his perch atop the boulder he could sit for hours, silent and still, letting the earth move around him, doing nothing but watching, breathing, feeling. Watching the cycle spin on and on as life ebbed and flowed around him, breathed and grew, frosted and fell, burned and died. It was always present, and always total. He needed the calm he usually found here. He needed clarity, understanding, absolution. He would sit here all night if he had to.
Sunday, May 16, 2004
All to soon the music suddenly halted, and in the accompanying silence the stage was plunged into deep twilight blue. The men both quickly shed the robes and their staffs and took positions across from each other.

.’  Astonishing, really. Every damned time it so much as misted in this place people suddenly drove as though the cars were manned by every little-old blue-haired gramma on their way home from church on a lazy Sunday over an ice rink slathered in pudding. It was fucking ridiculous, inching forward in two tons of glossy black steel when he could
Blowing a hot burst of air through his teeth Dean caught himself just before he slammed his palm against the horn. Instead he clenched his jaw and forced his hands to remain where they were on the steering wheel, watching through slitted eyes as the gunmetal grey sport car swerved within inches of the front of his car, forcing its way into a space that was barely big enough to breathe between the vehicles. “Bitch,” he mumbled, irritated, breaking the tense, brooding silence that had been increasingly enveloping him for the last hour and a half. Exasperated, Dean glanced down at the glowing digital numbers on his cell and this time he was unsuccessful at suppressing the curse that punched out of his chest. 2:42pm.
He was going to be late.
He was trying to decide if he should try to grab another beer while he still could when he felt an arm snake across his lower back, hand gliding down until it rested on the firm globe of his ass, fingers spread and digging in. He jumped slightly, and glanced to the side, expecting Brittney to be there smiling up at him with her white-blonde hair and hazel eyes. He was met with a grinning face, alright, but it wasn’t Brittney. Golden eyes glittered beneath a mop of light brown hair, barely masking the intense curiosity and glee etched across the face of the man standing with his hand cupping Deans ass.
Dean stands for a second inside the entryway, letting his eyes adjust when he finds himself, again, plunged in total darkness. He sighs and squints, trying to gauge if he can safely start heading to his table when the lights suddenly come up on the center of the stage and he feels all the air whoosh out of his body.
The next morning passed by in an emotional blur. The class he TA’s for, English Lit, had quickly become the highlight of his semester, and Cas was sorry to say goodbye to the staff and students alike. It had been an emotional final period, their test having been more of a spoken review of the class itself, and no one had escaped without tearing up. The walk back to his apartment was long, and Cas was drained when he got there. Sighing with relief, he let his messenger bag slide off his shoulder to the floor. Toeing off his shoes he heads into the kitchen to make himself a pb&j, choosing to eat standing at the counter, trying to decide what to do with the rest of his day.
The cafe was a bit stuffy, despite the open door allowing a gentle breeze to waft in, mingling fresh spring air with the tantalizing aroma of fresh ground coffee and sweet baked goods. Cas had been here since early afternoon, buried under a pile of books while he crammed for the rest of the week. His first final had wrapped up this morning, officially marking the end of his Junior year at Johnson State University. It had been a particularly grueling one and further expounded Cas’ conviction that, should he ever manage to get a job teaching like he wanted, he would stay far, far, FAR away from Political Science.
Cas shut off his phone, plugged it in and headed to the bathroom. Stripping, he turned the knob all the way to hot, letting the steam begin to fill the bathroom before stepping in. He groaned, hanging his head down to his chest, letting the scalding water pound out the tension in his shoulders. Once he deemed himself sufficiently relaxed, he grabbed his body wash and washcloth, and set to work scrubbing off the grime of the day. Rubbing the lavender-scented soap over his skin, he ponders his next few days, his mind wandering from what to watch on Netflix, to whether to study in the library or cafe tomorrow, to the final on Friday and, finally, to the possibility of hanging out with Patrick again.
And all that was real is left behind…”
Cas hadn’t ever been with anyone beside Dean, had never even entertained the thought of being attracted to anyone else before. Aside from a
The next 15 minutes were some of the longest and most effortlessly awkward that Dean could remember suffering through in a long time. Gabriel kept a steady stream of conversation going between himself, Charlie and Brittney, and while Dean made some weak attempts at interjecting he somehow had nothing to add to any of the topics rolling by. More than once he caught the sympathetic look Charlie was giving him after he had tried to make a joke on the heels of something Gabe said that had Brittney, once again, giggling like it was the funniest thing she had heard all evening. If Dean had less self confidence in himself he might have been worried about just how well Brittney and Gabe seemed to be getting along. He resigned himself to sipping his beer and staring blankly at the darkened stage area in front of him, keeping half an ear on the chatter going on without him.
Sunday, May 16, 2004
He raised his eyes to see the barista staring at him, holding out his now-piping hot cup of coffee with a terse, worried expression on her face. He flushed a deep red, embarrassed at his near outburst, and silently berated himself for being so easily distracted. He accepted the mug and smiled apologetically, mentally vowing to throw another few bucks in the tip jar for having to put up with him.
Dean...get this...he’s actually not too bad at it!
Dean gasped. He couldn’t help it. That voice. It was deep, a low rumbling that just happened to be right next to his damned ear. Warm breath ghosted across his neck, goosebumps racing across his scalp and down his arms. The timbre of those words had somehow gained an all-access pass straight to his groin, his cock immediately starting to perk up and thicken without his consent. The shock of realization that he was getting turned on was enough that Dean’s arms finally began working and he found himself weakly grappling at the arms across his chest. His fingers finally gained purchase, but the strong arms responded by pulling him even tighter against the firm body and Dean absolutely did NOT press back into it. And he absolutely did NOT groan.
With thoughts rolling through his head, Cas absentmindedly slipped his hand down his abdomen, the warm, sudsy cloth skating against his smooth stomach, his trimmed pubes, his….
It calmed him.
Fortunately when he was about halfway across the room he could see Brittney’s white-blonde hair catching the lights at a table near the front of the audience and he heaved a grateful sigh. She really was an attractive girl. Curvy in all the best ways, hair a cute short bob that showed off her heart shaped face and huge hazel eyes and pouty lips...she was a hell of a kisser, too. Dean was very much looking forward to the show being over already, couldn’t wait to try to talk Brittney into a night cap and maybe, if he played his cards right, breakfast the next morning.
To Dean's horror Gabe gave his ass another little squeeze before letting his hand drop back down to the large sugar-laden soda he was cradling.
And, more importantly,
He would wait.
to figure this out. He couldn’t afford a distraction. Not now, not when he had everything to lose...
he was losing Cas.  ‘
He follows her down the short hallway to her bedroom, vaguely remembering it when he had been here last spring. The next moments are a blur. Clothes come off, pillows are moved to the floor and Dean finds himself laid out across her soft comforter, Brittney straddling his legs. He has her breast in his mouth, tongue working over her pebbled nipple, hands roaming her soft stomach and tracing around to her back and down her buttocks. He moans as his hands go further, cupping her ass.
when the blonde suddenly leaned over the table towards the man. He shifted in his chair and angled his face. Cas can clearly see the outline of his profile.
“I...uh…” Fuck it. “I need another beer.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Nah. And *since* I am such a gracious Queen, I will even allow you to purchase my seat for me this evening.” She raised her eyebrow in a challenging manner, daring him to say anything to the contrary.
“Woooooo-ooooah”
“Wooooooooo-ooooah”
Dean felt like he’d been punched in the gut.
Tell me you like it. Tell me you hate it. Tell me you’ll call me in the morning.
Except the deep ragged breath that pushed a thick, muscled chest against Dean’s back.
Cas was drenched by the time he made it back to the car. It was after ten now, and the storm had mostly worked itself out, though the rain was still falling in cold sheets. Numb with cold, he pushed his hand into his pocket and coaxed the reluctant keys out from the stiff fabric. He paused before getting in, briefly debating if he should remove his jacket and try to keep at least
he corrected himself darkly,
Just Bobby, reminding him to hug “that man o’ yours” and wish him well from him and Ellen.
“Charlie- I met an angel. He caught me cause I fell. N’he told me to enjoy my pie! He’s a pie angel, Charlie.” Dean confided in his best friend, awe clear in his voice. Charlie smiled at Dean, gently taking his hand and leading him toward the doors.
The only highlight of the class had been one of his classmates, Patrick, a chestnut haired, hazel-eyed troublemaker. He was originally from Ireland, and his accent, sardonic sense of humor and twinkling eyes had caught Cas’ attention. Patrick was a business major, and didn’t seem to have the same issues understanding the material like Cas did. He had offered early in the year to help Cas study, and the two had been meeting a few times a week to study ever since.
Cas stayed huddled in the corner booth for the rest of the afternoon, slowly coming down from the rush of adrenaline the Not-Dean sighting has caused him. He occasionally responds to the texts Patrick sent him, but he carefully chooses not to share what happened earlier. He is just as careful to ignore the messages Dean has been sending him, pushing aside his feelings of guilt, telling himself that he’s too busy studying as he skips past the green message circle next to his boyfriend's name. Dean will readily accept that he was busy studying and won’t think to question him on it. Cas has no reason to lie to him, after all. He doesn’t take any more time to examine it, instead favoring texting back funny quips to Patrick before putting his phone back on the table and finally settling back into his studying.
as corpses definitely can’t pass our Calc final, the only sensible solution is to…” he paused for dramatic flare, waiting for Cas to glance back up at him. “...have lunch with me.” Chuckling, Cas shook his head, adjusting his back pack again. A few moments passed before he pasted a fake scowl on his face, stopped and faced Patrick.
Everyone sits in awed silence for a split second before thunderous applause erupts, and if Dean finds himself clapping a bit harder and whistling a little louder than the others? Well, that’s nobody’s business but his own.
Dean was reaching for the lighter again when a sharp “
“Dean…” Gabe said slowly, seeming to be choosing his words carefully. “You do know I’m Pansexual...right?”
“Dean.” Oof. That tone in his best friend’s voice brokered NO room for argument. Dean knew that even though he hadn’t finished his sentence, Charlie had heard the implied “isn’t it kinda gay?” Loud and crystal clear. He swallowed around the lump in his throat and huffed in resignation. He hated coming across as an asshole. Even if that’s sometimes exactly what he was.
As Castiel deepens the next kiss, Dean is unresponsive. He is staring wild-eyed at Castiel, who is nothing if not persistent. He nips at the Prince’s lips, then sucks gently before he pulls back to wait for an answer, worrying his own lip in the process. Just when Castiel is beginning to think he might have misjudged Dean, he sees this fire suddenly come alive in the other man’s eyes.
Their fertility is the price they had to pay for being part of a long-lived race. She should be happy that they would at least get another Blood child, especially with Jewels as dark as Castiel’s. But for Lucian to get a baby first completely drove Michaela insane with anger.
“I’m sorry,” The angel started and then shut his mouth, searching for his next words. “It’s just no one has ever touched them, well besides a few of my brother’s and sister’s for grooming, of course.” Of course. Like Dean would’ve known. “I didn’t mean to frighten you. It’s just that- wings are personal and-well normally touching wings is for-uhm.”
They’re standing so close, Cas’ eyes on his. Time to be brave Dean, he thinks to himself. You can choose to be happy. It’s so close he can touch it. And for once, he’s going to be selfish about it. This is his life. No God writing his story anymore. They fought for free will and he damn well gets to use it now.
Cas blinked hard and tried to turn around. The angel made a small sound, almost shocked when he saw the long black feathers. It reminded Dean of a dog chasing its' own tail and he fought back a laugh. Cas stretched the wings out then and they fluttered a little before turning back to the brothers.
“For…?” Dean supplied.
. Didn’t mean Dean was gonna tell him that. Sam was sure to get out of the shower, soon anyways. And he was hungry. Yeah focus on that. Hot pancakes and syrup. Not the six feet of self-conscious angel with fucking appealing wings in front of him. Dean met his eyes again, this time not turning away. Aw man, they were gonna do the staring thing again. Where Cas stares deeply into Dean’s soul and tries to figure out if he’s telling the truth and Dean tries to decide whether to glare at the other man or simply get lost in his big, blue eyes.
“For, well, mates-and-” Cas closed his mouth and looked passed Dean, over his shoulder then, ears burning red. Dean’s confused for a moment, and then it dawns on him. He knew Cas isn’t really interested in the blank wall behind him, he just didn’t want to finish the awkward train of thought.
(Another note: pick ur adventure)
“Whatever, I’m gonna take a shower, jerk,” The younger Winchester grabbed his clothes and stomped his way into the bathroom.
Jack stops by a few times. He and Cas talk for hours, sometimes w Dean cleaning up after dinner, easedropping. Othertimes he and Cas walk in the fields behind their house, long enough that Dean feels like a homewife who needs to ring a bell on the porch to call the kids in for dinner. Cas helps him reorganize heaven this way. When Jack first came to ask for help, to ask Cas to come back up for a bit to help, Dean’s heart plummets, but he doesnt say anything. Cas just hugs Jack close and shakes his head. He’s mostly human now anyways. Over the years, Cas had said, his grace has dwindled to near nothing without contact w heaven. His place is here now. But he gives Jack some ideas when he sends him on his way again. Dean takes his time that night to show Cas how much he appreciates he’s there,
Cas grimaced and pulled his tingling fingers away from the vents, grabbing the seat belt and clacking it into place. He was confused. He was so very, very confused. With a deep sigh, Cas put the car into gear and made his way back to the road, heading towards town to drop off the borrowed vehicle. For the first time in a long time, although he knew his destination, he was driving without a clear idea of where he was going.
He had sat outside for hours, letting the rain and wind wash over him, hoping for some sort of clarity, some sort of answer. As much love as he had for nature, and as much peace as that place had always brought to him before, tonight he had come out as empty and hollow as he had when he had first sat down. He barely noticed the water washing down his cheeks wasn’t all ice cold drops from his hair.
Another wave ripped through him and he sank to his knees, hissing through the shock.
“Dean! I was wondering where you’d gone off to. Are you okay??” She exclaimed, clutching his arm and all but pulling him down to her level.
I hope there’s *something* enjoyable in this, at least.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Well?” Patrick gently swung into Cas as they walked, bumping his shoulder slightly. “What do you say? Because I, as your very concerned friend and best looking classmate,” Cas snorted and Patrick glowered at him for a second before continuing on, “
Dean had sobered slightly by the time he and Charlie had walked the few blocks to the diner. Gabe and Brittney had gotten a table smooshed into a corner near the old-fashioned juke box, and Dean was pleasantly surprised to see Dorothy sitting at their table as well. There was a carafe of hot coffee and a suspiciously large glass of water sitting in front of the empty seat beside Brittney, but Dean wasn’t upset by the presumption he would need it. He slid gratefully in to his seat, picked up the glass of water and sipped at it, sliding his arm around Brittney’s shoulders and returning her smile as she leaned in to him.
While he waited for the barista to return with his mug, he cast his eyes around the shop. His gaze swept the spattering of people idly until suddenly his breath caught in this throat.
His scars.
this damned traffic to move.
Tuesday, May 11, 2004
He has his back towards the counter where Cas is standing, frozen to the spot. Kitty-corner to him at the table is a pretty blonde girl, laughing, bright blush painting her cheeks, her blue eyes sparkling merrily. The noise of the cafe falls silent, the only sound the sudden rushing of his blood pounding in his ears as Cas is overcome with a hollow, gutted feeling.
Except the warm, strong arms and hands that had wrapped around him from behind, holding him in a sudden, all-encompassing embrace.
Deep, denim blue eyes were observing Dean’s flushed face under a mop of raven black hair. His perfect jaw and perfect nose and perfect lips were just… they were right fucking there. Dean’s gaze dropped to the man’s strong arms, his broad shoulders and chest, his stomach with the tattoos, the perfect V of his hips showing just above the black skin tight pants he was wearing that perfectly showed off a bulge that made Dean’s mouth go dry. With a jolt Dean sobered up enough to realize he had just been saved, like a damsel in distress, by one of the male burlesque dancers (the hot one, his mind supplied most unhelpfully) who was standing a mere foot away, staring at Dean waiting for a thank you while Dean was positively frozen STARING AT HIS CROTCH.
As if it heard him, the cars in front of him rolled forward and Dean sat up straighter, but after 20 feet it ground to a halt.  Exasperated, he huffed back into the seat and let his mind wander over the events of the last week. It was better than sitting here feeling his stomach eat him from the inside.
, you should come get lunch with me.”
caused him to pause mid-air, the cigarette falling unnoticed from his lips. The sudden vibration of his phone against the seat almost stopped his heart. Dean’s breath caught in his throat, grabbing the phone off the seat and thumbing the side button to turn it on. The screen popped to life...
“I know I didn’t say anything, but do you remember Brittney? She and I went out last Spring for a few dates?” Dean paused, an expectant look on his face. Truth be told, Charlie did NOT remember Brittney, but it didn’t really matter. Dean wasn’t going to care nor quiz her on it so there was no harm in the lie. She nodded and Dean went on. “Well, I ran into her again while I was gassing up and she didn’t have plans for tonight so I just… I didn’t think you’d mind?” Dean looked so hopeful, Charlie couldn’t even bring herself to tease him. She smiled.
Dean felt his face heat up again in embarrassment. He *had* known that, actually. Or, he remembered Sam talking about it before. Sam and Gabe had been friends since the moment they met in Highschool, and despite the age difference, they had been thick as thieves until Sam had gone cross country for college. “Oh! Yeah. Sorry man, I guess I forgot. Not that there’s anything to forget, really, cause that’s fine, you know? I just wondered cause you were just looking at Charlie and it seemed...anyway it’s all good. Allll good with me. I mean, not *with* me, you know. I’m not.. I don’t… Just that it’s okay in general. You know?” Dean could not seem to stop the verbal diarrhea from pouring out of his mouth while he felt his face growing hotter and hotter under Gabe’s amused stare.
Except the way Dean’s whole body responded to the strength and heat enveloping him, pressing into his every sense, his very soul lit aflame and startlingly aware of every inch of skin that was touching him...except…
He couldn’t move, the pain overwhelming him, burning him all over again.
He focused his sapphire eyes back on the sky, searching again for the hawk, disappointment briefly washing him when he found it had moved on.  His eyes flicked back to the sun and he watched the solemn surrender as the last licks of daylight fought in vain against the underbelly of the thunderheads feeding themselves on the thick, suffocating promise of the night. His gaze rested there, following the storm rushing to engulf the very sky it was born from, full of electricity and impatience. Winds gusted below him, restlessly climbing over the valley, up the sides of the mountain until finally descending upon him.
He remained there, his hand pressed against the hood of the car, eyes clenched shut, shallowly sucking breath after breath, willing the rolling, swaying feeling to subside until, finally, it does. Cautiously he cracked one eye open, making sure the world was staying in one place. Slowly he straightened up and glanced around, relieved there was no one else there to witness his momentary loss of gravity. Drawing another deep breath, he slammed the door and made his way towards the pump.
“Look Charlie, I’m sorry. I don’t mean any disrespect, okay? You know I don’t have anything against anyone. It’s just, it’s a Wednesday and I have stuff to do… But I’m flattered you need me to go with you…”
occasional jerk off to porn, he had never even cum to the thought of anyone other than Dean since they'd met. He carefully set down the cloth, drifted his hand to his cock again, almost experimentally brushing his fingers across the turgid skin. He shivered.
Cas had been one of the last to complete his test, the last essay proving to be the biggest struggle for Cas. It was with a sigh of utter relief that he had finally turned it in and slunk his way out onto the quad, relief short-lived as he was immediately inundated with dread over the next final he needed to cram for. He had hiked his bag higher on his shoulder and started off towards his apartment, intent on ignoring the rest of the world in favor of studying, when a familiar voice calling his name caught his attention.
Chapter summary: Dean spends his final night in Rail Pass in the old Winchester homestead. He awakes before dawn and is struck with a small panic attack caused by memories and stress. While driving home he pulls off the road and has an anxiety attack which results in phantom pains in scar tissue across his abdomen which he sustained in a fire.
There, against the far wall, sits a man in a worn flannel with broad shoulders and sandy blonde hair.
this time.
Dean found he was enjoying himself immensely. He even managed to forget that Gabe was sitting at the table with them until the house lights came on, signaling the start of intermission. Dean stretched in his chair, working out a kink, and turned towards Charlie but finds her seat empty. Confused, he glanced around and just managed to catch a glimpse of her shock of red hair disappearing behind the side curtain. “Ahhh” he grinned. “Go get her, tiger” He went to grab his beer, only to find it gone. It must have been cleared by the waitstaff sometime during the show. Huh, he hadn’t even noticed. He stood and turns to find two pairs of eyes on him.
Unconsciously he clenched his fist and took a step towards the table, mouth opening to speak, to
definitely
He breathed deep and locked that thought tightly back where it had almost escaped from. His hand fell back to his lap. He had to figure out what had happened, what he should do. He
“Wha..? Yeah. Yeah, Imbe fine.” Dean managed to get past his lips, which had most unhelpfully decided to become numb. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Angel’s gaze. He licked his lips and tried again. “Mine frien...my friends are right there. We’re going to go get pie. You… you should come get pie!” This was a GREAT idea! Angel would come get pie and then Dean can get to know about his tattoos! “You should come get pie with the diner on the road. Down. Down the road. The diner is a spoon. But the spoon has pie!” Dean was doing awesome. All he could see was the smile on Angel’s face and this was clearly his best idea yet. Angel would come get pie and Dean would get pie with Angel.
Except that part of the way through the fall he just… stopped falling.

“An all-male burlesque show! You know, burlesque? Dancing, stripping, pasties, athletic prowess, awesome costumes… all things I happen to know you like, Dean.”
to distract his mind; from the sluggish traffic; the oppressive, suffocating feel of the heavy grey clouds; the cold, impersonal rain; and especially the gut-twisting thought that somehow,
Having made up his mind, he angled his steps to bring him closer, casually throwing his arm around Brittney’s shoulders, pulling her into his side as they walked.
Not brown. Green. Deep green, full of hurt and confusion…With an anguished cry, Cas slid down the wall of the shower, tears mixing with the cooling water flowing down the drain.

Dean jumped out of the driver side door with a sheepish grin on his face, wiping his hand across his mouth and straightening the green Henley he was wearing as if to hide any evidence of what had been going on. Charlie raised her eyebrow at him, a slight smirk adorning her features. “Uh, hey there your Highness.”
Cas is deep down a path of calculus and imaginary numbers when the door to the cafe suddenly banged open, bell chiming obnoxiously loud, announcing the arrival of a large group of rowdy freshmen, startling Cas out of his bubble. He groaned, stretched his sore back and reached for his phone next to his once-again empty coffee mug. He clicked it on, instantly dismissing then new notification of text messages from Dean, telling himself he'll answer them later. It was already ten to nine; he hadn’t even realized  how quickly the day was passing him by. He had his final class as a TA tomorrow at 8am and still needed to organize his notes before he could call it a night. He gathered his things, pocketed his phone and headed home.
“Don’t remind me,” Cas groaned. “If I don’t end up re-taking that class, it will be a miracle.”  Patrick chuckled, falling in to easy step beside Cas as they took off walking across the lawns.
Between one heartbeat and the next the act begins with a flash of the lights that mirror the crash of a hi-hat that makes Dean jump. In the same moment, the man snaps his head up and his body begins moving in an equally sharp and sinewy rhythm. Different color lights pulse to to the heartbeat of a remix of Imagine Dragon’s “Believer.” Dean is spellbound, stuck at the back of the theatre, watching the man move gracefully across the floor, strength, flexibility and sin projected in every sweep of his muscular body. And his eyes...Even in the throbbing lights Dean can see how wide and captivating they are. Set beneath those deep eyes and above that sharp jaw is an equally sharp nose and what may be the most gorgeous set of lips ever to adorn a man that Dean had seen. The man turns his back to the audience and Dean is treated to the first real view of his shoulders, his waist, his ass...Dean swallows convulsively. “Holy shit” he thinks. The man’s back, shoulders and upper arms have intricate wings inked into his perfect skin. They glisten with his sweat, calling to Dean.
Dean was trying to figure out the logistics of sneaking his phone out of his pocket to snap a pic of Charlie (for later blackmailing purposes) when a sudden deep chord of music pulsed through the theater. It was followed by a chorus of voices that seemed to come from every where.

His interest in Patrick had definitely grown the more he had gotten to know him. He found his laugh pleasing, he was funny and light-hearted, seemed kind and always so prepared. He was wickedly intelligent, his sharp eyes never seeming to miss a thing. It made him an ideal study partner, and, Cas mused, it made him an...interesting friend. Cas found his mind lingering on his eyes; the warm hazel-brown, the way they crinkled when he laughed, how they stared at him while he was talking, as though Cas were the most interesting person in the world.

“I, uh,” Dean said, brilliantly.
“Hey, Cas! Wait up, would ya?” Patrick called.
Angel.
And awaaaay we go!
course
The storm was here.
. But did he anymore? He honestly couldn’t remember.
“Are you going to be okay?” Angel asked him, the smile never dimming for one second.
“No, uh, of course! Absolutely.” He lowered his voice, “And Charlie, uh.. Thank you for… you know. Not making a big deal over this. I appreciate it. And, uh, I promise I won’t leave you out. No third wheel or making you uncomfortable, okay?”
“Fine” he sighed.
A strong, clear male voice cut through the dark.
Stubble drags lightly across his thighs as he squeezes them together, and the foreign sensation almost hurtles him face first into his orgasm. Dean is helpless against the onslaught of pleasure, his body responding to the physical sensations with more intensity than he can remember in his entire life. He gasps and bucks, pushing his cock impossibly deeper but instead of choking and pulling away, Dean is shocked breathless as a deep hum vibrates his entire shaft.

“So,” Patrick said.
“You doing okay there, Dean-o?” Gabe asked, clearly enjoying the hell out of Dean’s embarrassment.
Tightrope
He needed to get out of the car, out of the traffic, to clear his mind. Just for a minute. He didn’t want to delay his return home, not really. He just
“Not to be… well, I’d understand if it were none of my business but… I mean it IS none of my business but…”Dean stammered, trying to figure out how to phrase the question he wanted to ask. Gabes eyebrows were raised again, although this time not bouncing, as he waited with amusement for Dean to find his bearings. “Well, okay uh… Charlie told me this was...uh… more male dominated show, you know? Men’s burlesque, right? No chicks? Not that there’s anything wrong with men stripping or anything!” Dean hastened to tack on to his statement at the look of bewilderment on Gabe’s face.
Dean closes his eyes , a deep groan making it’s way into the silence of his bedroom. It’s barely dawn, the light just creeping in across the horizon enough to turn the world outside from deep blue to a muddy grey as he was driving home from Brittney’s place.
At that Charlie cut him off with a barked laugh.
Soon enough they arrived at the theater, if one could really call it that. It was more like an abandoned warehouse, according to the look of the exterior of the building. Dean managed to find  a parking spot towards the back of the surprisingly cramped parking lot and eased Baby to a stop. He truly was on his best behavior, going around and opening not only Brittney’s, but Charlie’s door as well. Once inside the building they found themselves in a small but surprisingly cozy waiting area, a ticket booth/concessions stand set up along the far wall, and a curtained off area separating what Dean assumed was the stage from the space they were in. Dean left the ladies still happily yammering away and went to purchase tickets and, what the hell, a beer for himself and Charlie and a cider for Brittney. When he returned, hands full of tickets and booze, he stood awkwardly just off to the side, trying not to be in anyone’s way. Glancing around he was surprised at the number of people gathered in the small waiting area. Dean had never even heard of the space before today, and it was a bit startling to see how many people were crammed into the room. He hoped the doors or curtains or whatever would open soon.
He heaved a sigh and draped his hands across the vents, soaking up the weak warmth the heater was putting out. He breathed deeply, inhaling the scent of the car, almost cursing himself for the sharp jolt he felt through his spine as the lingering smell of Polo Sport and cigar invaded his senses. It wasn’t Dean’s smell, was a far cry from it. Dean was musky and clean...like leather, fresh scrubbed woods after a hard rain shower, or the first true day of autumn, sharp and crisp. Dean’s scent had always cut straight to the center of Cas, grounding him and making him swear he was flying in the same instant. And Patrick’s car, his smell...it was about as far from Dean as one could go.
It’s not Dean.
“Sorry. I meant, Yes your Majesty. I would be honored to accompany you to the show.”
His eyes laser focused on the blonde, he can’t seem to catch his breath, can’t feel the blood he can hear like a kettle drum in his head, can’t even
Dean looked appropriately abashed as he crossed around to the rear passenger side door.
Dean had to admit, the show was pretty good. The first number had been absolutely stunning, featuring the entire ensemble and creating an immediate atmosphere that was pretty impressive, and things had continued to go up from there.  He wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, but whatever it was this show did not disappoint. The men performing weren’t naked, which was a relief, but they also weren’t just stripping. In fact, none of them were, not really. Sure, almost every one that came on stage left with less clothing on than when they entered, but it was all done very tastefully. Dean found himself increasingly relaxed, casually enjoying the show and genuinely impressed at some of the talents these guys had.
The man threw his head back and laughed, a deep, rumbling laugh that made Dean’s fingers and toes tingle.
let me stay, brother," Lucifer appealed, the smile never leaving his face while he stepped away from Michael. He leaned towards the edge of the Cage, its edges again shooting bright lights upward, separating Dean from Lucifer's malice.

her! Consider that he might enjoy her company, mother."
It opened to a sunken garden, green with grass and surrounded by weathered stones that could be used as temporary seats. At its center, stones piled upon each other, forming an altar, its top blackened with the soot of earlier offerings. On closer inspection, there was a small indent on the pedestal's surface, indicating its frequent use.
I really wanted to ramp up Cas and Dean and Sam’s foreign vibe. And in some ways, it did come out. Cas’ confusion over the taxes, the tipping culture, the fact that he’s being given a takeaway box, the food portions, the endless driving (OMG how can guys want to drive forever? I want to walk and maybe be in the car for thirty minutes). Despite Dean and Sam being on a ship, they were exposed to Bobby Singer. Cas, despite living in the US for a while was never exposed to US culture because he was very sheltered. There were a ton of things I wanted to include (like being given an empty cup for free refills) but wouldn’t work in the time setting, being able to return stuff within 90 days, the amount of choices in grocery stores (although there was a similar one when they were in the Firework’s store) but anyway I really loved the fact that I was a foreigner and had a lot of culture shock while I was in America and finally got to write that in this context.
"Gabriel, focus." Because once Gabriel started on one of his spiels, it was difficult to get him out of it. Sometimes, Castiel thought Gabriel just liked the sound of his voice too much.
From the other side of the Cage, Ash ran up to Dean. "What was with that light show? You think you know how to attract the attention of those two?"

It was elegantly done in black, with six glittering points in silver. Ursa Minor in all its glory against an empty sky. Underneath the lid, a vial nestled between cardboard foldouts. It contained two translucent lenses. The box included sterilizing fluid, a small cog-and-wheel lift to retrieve the lenses from the bottle easily, and manuals.
“Mom?” Sam and Dean asked at the same time.
This is also the reason why I had absolutely the WORST time getting a pre-reader, because I don't know anybody in fandom? Heya!! you guys are my first ever fandom friends? Again thanks to the pre-readers that I did end up getting. You guys are the BESTEST.

was Cas or just a hallucination. His anxiety grew exponentially as he vacillated between praying it was Cas and hoping that he was wrong. Because no matter how long ago he’d seen Cas, it both felt like yesterday when they’d argued, and forever since he’d run his tongue against those chapped lips.
"Yeah, I keep busy with my car and fishing, waiting for Sammy—that's my brother," Dean said in the low, steady voice that he used to use to prevent a twitchy victim from bolting.
There was a sharp intake of breath from Dad before he gently settled Sam onto the bed. Dad leaned over Dean, a hand on the boy’s shoulder, the grip firm but not painful. Dean waited expectantly for what his dad would say, but no words came to fill the silence. There was strain in his dad’s eyes and hints of tiredness. It was not easy learning to be a hunter and taking care of two boys. His dad had explained this all to Dean some time ago.
"Dominions?" Dean asked, and Castiel could almost see the wheels of his mind turning.
