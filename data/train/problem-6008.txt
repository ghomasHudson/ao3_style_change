Tony stood outside the hospital conference room with what little coffee was allowed to him. He had a stupid Starbucks Frappuccino in his hand and his sunglasses on so no one could see how unenthused he was to be there.
“I heard the good news from Tony. Congratulations,” Steve smiled.
“Fucking watch me-aaaaah.” When Tony pushed, he felt something of what he could best describe as a water balloon bursting inside of him followed by a gush of warm fluid soak through his pants. He was relieved for a moment, huffing and shaking while Steve scooped him up and put him into the wheelchair.
“Because despite the odds against us, we get to sit here and rise above the rest. I think this is momentous. We’re like the omega power couple. And I,” he paused, “want to make sure that we are the omega power couple.”
About halfway through writing this I had the idea of like a spin-off from this where Peter starts to get confused with wanting to be with Steve and maybe developing something a little angsty, but mostly sweet between the three of them, with more of the focus being Peter/Steve. Thoughts? Comment below! Edit/clarification: college age Peter
PPS Edit: after an hour of thinking about it, I realized that this was a stupid idea because I literally just wrote  20000 something words that 1) didn't involve Peter in any way shape or form and 2) made a solid foot hold in building a healthy relationship for Steve and Tony. It would be literal assassination to the work I just did. I just wanted some Peter love for a hot moment.
Tony was half tempted to keep his helmet on since it was obviously suspicious behavior but opted out on that notion. Keeping his mask on around non-enemies made it seem like he was one of those masked superhero douche bags that he found to be cliche and unnecessary.
“I don’t think I gave you permission to leave the bed, Tony,” Steve laughed. “You should be resting. And you know what, Peter, you should be too!”
He folded his arms across his chest, pacing back and forth with curiosity as he slowly unraveled the past of the Tesseract and the role it played in his father's research. Huh, if only they had involved Tony sooner. Imagine what could have happened, or could have not happened for a better matter. If they hadn’t been dumb about their exterminations with the Tesseract. Ah, well.
“I demand that you hate this stupid class as much as I do otherwise I won’t be content,” Tony continued stubbornly.
Peter laughed through his nose. “Yeah, that’s pretty unhelpful. Oh, but hey, you said you were probably pregnant? That was something you said at the beginning of our conversation. I heard it. Does that mean you’re trying?”
“Tony,” Steve continued with an unimpressed expression. “You’re getting down to the wire, so you can’t keep putting this off.”
I'm sure some of you will have questions by the end of this chapter. I ask that you to wait until the next one to see where I'm headed with this and how I was able to pull off this whole extremist collective thinking considering the timeframe between now and the snap. I have a reason and part of a story outline drawn on a napkin. (lol jk)
ALSO, so I mentioned some biological intricacies that go into being an omega and how I like to make sense of it. I'll mention that Tony has a slit and for that, you can picture whatever the hell you want, but I like to think that technically he's intersexed, but not exactly a hermaphrodite where the clit is the penis and then there may not be testicles or rather two deformed ones. So he does have a vaginal opening, but it's smaller and more towards his rear than a woman's. It's also lacking a clit and urethra obviously and serves the singular purpose for sex and birth. Omegaverse is so .....versatile! Everyone has a different idea for it and I think that's so fun.
When the doors of the elevator slid closed, Tony expanded his work and delved into the initiative project along with the initial threat of Loki, the Asgardian, and the Tesseract. He only paused a moment when he saw the file folder on the great Captain America. He twisted his lips around his teeth, grimacing at the thought of that man. Hadn’t even met him yet, and he already had opinions, mostly a sense of jealousy over the man his father often spoke so highly of at every given opportunity.
“I would be honored,” she whispered before she was interrupted by the sound of his alarm ringing. Tony perked up and swiveled around for his phone, grabbing for it and near snarling at the voice on the other line. Too late. The joke was on Tony because the culprit of the security breach was already in the elevator and looking at him smugly as the doors opened to the top floor of his new Stark Tower.
So Germany it was.
“Oh. That’s kind of cool to think of it like that. Thank you, Steve.”
WARNING TRIGGERS APPLY TO THE SCENES BELOW.
Steve emitted an exasperated groan and pinched the bridge of his nose in embarrassment.
The two made a move at each other; Tony moving to push Steve away, and Steve reaching to rip Tony’s glasses off of his face. When the alpha won, he snapped the glasses closed and stuffed them into his shirt pocket. Tony scoffed. “You look like an old man with that shirt,” he hissed.
“Tony, don’t!” And that was the last thing that he heard before the sounds of rushing air and his own flight engine surrounded him with a strange sense of comfort.
“Don’t be childish. She’ll come when she comes.”
“Uh, yeah. His mate only confirmed this after first looking to their admission sheet.
He was perfectly okay with the collecting silence in the jet, but it would seem awkward silence didn’t bode well with Captain America. Tony stiffened more, trying hard not to show any visible signs of discomfort and aggression as Rogers leaned close to whisper against his shoulder.
It was almost cute how seriously Steve was taking it. He hummed low in Tony’s ear and pushed his fingertips into all of the right places that really did relax Tony, but unfortunately, the omega was less inclined to participate. Instead, he would roll his hips on the bouncy ball, wincing every once and a while, and pretend to moan while also giving a half-assed attempt at breathing properly.
“Gross, stop it. I’m trying to be in a bad mood,” Tony whined while Steve swayed with him and pressed kisses of adoration against his forehead. “Feel like helping me out tonight?” he added after a few moments of silence passed them by.
Tony shot him as nasty of a glance as he could muster before spitting out his remark. “Careful, babe, you’re letting your boyish naivety through.”
“What hurts?” Steve was saying in a near state of panic. In that amount of time, the head of their seminar had come to aid, arriving conveniently with a wheelchair and some sort of stupid smile on her face.
“Well times have changed and there’s a threat greater than whether or not you play well with others,” Coulson commented casually as he declined Peppers offer of a celebratory drink.
So aliens, or gods, magic, and mind control powers. Tony scrambled his fingers through his hair. There was a lot of work ahead of him.
This follows pretty closely to the first Avengers movie if you need a refresher on what happens.
The room was only full of a dozen people or so. He didn’t want to be out milling about where he could potentially get bombarded with fans or start-struck rubber-neckers. Steve must have thought the same because he chose a seat for them in the back in the furthest corner.
“You’re never content,” Steve laughed.
And she was perfect.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She’s so close.”
“Y-yeah,” Peter stammered when Steve grabbed the back of his neck and gave him a few more rubs before he retracted his touch.
Tony wished he could have seen more of Steve's face in the labor room. He wished he had the comprehension to look at him when their baby was born, but instead, he only held onto Steve’s chest and pushed until the doctors told him to feel the crown of his daughter’s head.

“We can’t let Loki get away,” Tony grunted after smacking at the captain’s hands again when he tried to help him.
“I don’t think so. It’ll be amazing,” Peter said with a smile.
Steve screwed up his face in a moment of thought. He leaned against the couch with his arms crossed and pushed his lips against Peter’s cheek. “Nope. Shouldn’t be a problem for me, but cut me some slack if I seem overprotective of you as you develop more. It’s sort of in my nature to want to take care of people I love, and I really am proud and ecstatic to have another omega in the house.”
Just that one blow almost knocked Tony unconscious, and that was something he could not let happen. He was not going to be the omega that got his ass handed to him in front of an alpha.
“Nope. Well,” Tony paused for a split second. “Don’t get me wrong. It’s not like I went to Steve’s apartment that day being totally out of control of my actions. It was still a decision that two adults came to make. The sex before that; now that was when we couldn’t control ourselves, but when you’re overcome with those strong urges you just have to be smart about the morning aftercare and keep your bond mark protected. It took us a couple of hot goes before we couldn’t stop it. So you can see that it is possible to control urges. Just stick it out long enough to get away. Takes practice. I was just forced to be around Steve, and it was one of those stupid fate situations or whatever.” Tony was rolling his eyes and waving his hands around eccentrically as he spoke. He felt stupid talking about it, but it was important for the kid to hear.
_____________
“Of course it did…” He couldn’t help but attempt to be soft, gentle, maybe that was what he needed to persuade him, to remind him of what he felt.
“I have to confess,” Tony says, his voice a little shaky, “that I mostly picked those songs to annoy you. Modern pop isn’t really my taste.” Steve’s eyes are welling with tears, and he’s a bit unnerved when his own eyes become clouded as well.
Steve held Tony securely, stifling the pang of worry growing in his gut.
“Did you ever wonder if the serum could mess with it?”
I’m sorry. I’ve not had a chance to fully read your letters. I’m ok.
“Thought you liked my uniform?” He closed the distance between them, playing to Tony’s intentions perfectly.
Tony reached for his phone, wondering if he were to call Steve if he would pick up, when his phone chimed. Oh thank god - it was a text from the man in question. Mildly impressed that he had figured out how to finally use the device, he read:
“You would rather carry me than remove my blindfold?”
“If you’re serious about this, Tony, then I’ve already lost it.”
“I didn’t mean it.”
“I’ve met many people, Steve,” Tony waved a dismissive hand in the air, “and not one has told me the story of their soulbond awakening.”
“So you say!”
Shawarma. Yes. Perfect. New food, new restaurant, new friends, new crush -
Tony said nothing, eyes still blown wide, body rigid, until he started to pace a bit. “What are you doing here, Freud? You wanna talk about my mom next?”
Even if I’m shrouded in darkness, even though the sun has been extinguished, I now know what path I am to follow to protect his legacy. If I couldn’t protect him in life, I’ll forever protect him in death.
He reached his hand down without looking and grabbed at Tony’s ass, massaging closer and closer to his opening. Tony’s legs splayed wide, an invitation to continue.
Tony wasn’t even coherent, and his instinct was to request one last kiss before Steve slinked away.
Steve holds Tony tightly, pressing his lips into his hair. A pang of worry strikes him, threatening his newfound serenity.
, per se. But music is a dopamine-maker, and who couldn’t use some more happy hormones?
? Rather, you're Captain America? All that time we were serving together, galivanting around as Avengers, and you kept this from me?”
He knew this, he knew this is what the Chitauri’s aim was, but he couldn’t help but feel like by revealing their trick, it would kill him, too.
_____________
First, he’s just got to figure out how to get off of this couch.
“There are alternatives I consider satisfactory,” he drawls as Tony’s eyes continue to well with tears. “You will not just confirm my status, but will bring me unimaginable wealth. I’m no fool, I know your assets are no longer under your sway, but mark me, that’s of no consequence to the slew of fine buyers who are lining up at the very whisper of your name.”
“So the wedding…and the rings...”
For as long as Tony had been in the secret hero business, his instinctive tendency to worry still didn’t ebb, at least not when it came to those he cared about, which he was learning extended to include Steve. He was trusting, and warm, and handsome as all hell. The man, the myth, the legend, who lived up to it all and so,
“I don’t think you want to do that,” Steve warned against Tony’s mouth.
“So, anyway, I just wonder if your serum has something to do with the extent to which I feel what you’ve experienced. I would have hypothesized that it would lessen the psychological effects of the trauma you’ve endured, since I know you heal physically at an incredible rate. I guess it doesn’t extend to the mind.”
“That’s why I’m here now, to check on him again.”
_____________
“You’re helping to indulge my curiosities without me feeling weird about it. What do you think?”
“Ok Tony.” He considered him judiciously. “A break, maybe? From time to time.”
Prompt: Alien Invasion
“I’m fantastic. Just...absolutely fantastic.”
_____________
“Hi, I’m just trying to…” Trying to what? He couldn’t even supply a convincing lie to himself.
“Oh, sorry, I-”
“Dr. Banner and Fury are compellingly confident.”
Tony has nothing left. His family has long since passed, and the love of his life died a mere years ago as well. His fortune has been seized while he’s being investigated and tried before the King and Queen to be made accountable for actions taken while he donned the Iron Suit. His friends, the few he has left, are sequestered to their homes until the CROWN have exhausted their retaliation efforts. Newly deprived of his armor, he doesn't even reach his workbench to make defensive preparations before an elite team of thieves come for him, breaching his home, and taking him captive.
“...damn, what a way to celebrate,” Tony finally breathed. He ran his hands over his face, then through his hair before sitting up and dressing himself. Once finished, Steve felt him shift closer, their shoulders barely brushing. A peaceful moment passed while Steve allowed his mind to be captivated by the brilliance of a slowly fading twilight. Along the horizon, there was a distant movement that caught his attention. He ignored a pang of anxiety that echoed in his gut in favor of gazing into the night sky.
The words suddenly don’t matter. The sentiment is a confusing reminder of the invasion and of the Captain all the same.
“You like it?” Steve questioned, finally turning his attention to the brunette, who was casually sitting in a tired chair. His first destination after returning from the difficult mission was to climb to the roof of the compound, where Tony almost certainly spent most of his days amongst papers and books, no matter the hour. “You have no taste, sweetheart.” His tone was an attempt at a light jest, but it still came out rough.
It was wonderful to share his room with someone, especially someone for whom Steve cared so deeply.
Wouldn’t he?
The antagonizing forces descend upon them, quickly surrounding them. Nomad unsheathes a parrying dagger with his left hand, and in an artful choreography, begins to lay waste to their attackers. Tony watches the flashes of movement while upside down, disoriented from Nomad’s incredible movements. The dozens of attackers are fierce and unrelenting, and as Nomad is beginning to falter, Tony sees his opportunity.
Tony looked down at his distended abdomen. “Uh, yeah. I’m getting old, and I always did want to at least try to have a family at one point in my life. I’m sure I’ll test positive within the next few weeks. It’ll be weird.”
In keeping with canon, all songs are from 2012 and earlier.
Eventually they settled in the bed, exchanged lingering kisses, and snuggled together in the warm blankets. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him close to his heart.
And yet, words unspoken still charged the atmosphere, regrets sat heavy in his throat, and pain threatened to break the thin thread of niceties that barely existed. There now existed a tiny ball of heat in his chest so volatile that Steve believed it might spontaneously combust without a moment’s notice. It hadn’t even been five minutes, and he already felt raw and exposed in Tony’s presence.
Whoever it is that’s stolen him like a small sack of potatoes is impossibly strong, because they’re maintaining a swift pace and don’t seem at all inconvenienced by his pathetic protest.
When they part, Tony is breathless yet again, but this time, it doesn’t hurt. Now all he wants is for Steve to steal his breath again, and again, and again.
He’s floating.
“None of this is your fault, and I’ll always be here to make sure you remember it well. Let me take care of you. I’ll make it better, I promise. Yeah?”
Gotta get up. Go eat. Do something, anything, not think about-
It was all so new, so uncharted for them both, and Steve was still learning what was good for Tony. What they had was fragile in its novelty, and Steve felt reverence for what Tony was trusting him to build. His candid plan was working, and quickly, their post-mission ritual began to evolve.
his mind echoed. It tore at him, slowly, piece by piece. Here Tony stood, having traveled half-way across the globe, lying and deceiving every person he knew and every person who knew him, just to be
“You ok?” Steve asked in a husky whisper.
“You drug this or something?” he asked suspiciously, but Steve laughed anyway.
He attributed the shock to the armor. Undeterred, he dipped his mouth for more.
“Oh, should I ask JARVIS to turn down the thermostat-”
He didn’t want to ask it, but like the wind, it could not be contained and slipped from his unwilling lips. “What did he do with his ring?”
When Steve came out of the ice, after SHIELD first attempted to hide the truth from him, they corrected their course of action and instead provided an incredibly comprehensive assimilation training. They covered major historical events, language and colloquialisms, current culture, political status, even insofar as to discuss the kinds of food he should expect to eat. Most anything of major significance that would aid in his understanding of this new era was addressed. As the instruction commenced, Steve realized there was one thing he still had questions about.
He discovers the cave affords plenty of room to walk about, and is only mostly enclosed. A large portion is exposed, revealing a waterfall flowing from overhead, and a breathtaking view overlooking a lush valley of trees. He turns to see Nomad stagger in, blood still flowing from his head, and he tumbles to the ground. It’s clear he’s suffering, and Tony drops to his knees beside him to assess his injury.
_____________
He heard Tony's insincere words. Every one of them baffled him. However, slowly, he began to understand the thin thread of truth in Tony’s grandeur.
“Tony?”
“Steve...
“Party’s coming to you!” Tony yells.
“Alright, wonderboy, I’m not very convinced,” Tony prodded.
“Oh,” Steve sighed with a laugh. “You would think that’s the first thing they would want to tell the great Tony Stark.”
, and I have to give it all up? Let me tell you, I sure as fuck don’t feel compromised. I’m not even a goddamned Avenger and I’m losing everything because of it!”
Everything about Steve was delectable. His booming laughter was positively infectious, his subtle insecurities were admirable, his broad smile was charming. His sparkling azure eyes were as deep and unknowable as the sea - alluring, nourishing, ever-changing. The man out of time was full of surprises, and for once, Tony didn’t mind being proven wrong.
“...I’m trying, Steve, I really am, but...”
His head was spinning, there was so much to do, to think, to say. All he could manage was, “Where?”
Tony can’t believe what he’s hearing. He allows his legs to give way from underneath him, and falls to his knees on the jagged ground.
“And damned me to an even worse future at your side.”
If only I had talked to him. If only I hadn’t fought, hadn’t encouraged others to fight, too. If only I turned myself in earlier. If only I had accepted the deal he offered to me...if only I had done anything different, anything at all, I could have been there to protect him, I should have protected him...I would give anything to go back and be there to protect him…
You know I’ve faced loss. I’ve lost so many, and seen so much death. But this...it just doesn’t feel real. I keep thinking after I’ve served my time, I’ll walk out of this cell, and be greeted with one of his signature hugs, an impossibly tight embrace. I’ll get to look into those clear, azure eyes once again, and tell him all the things he never let me say before.
was the one who was bound and blindfolded.
There was no logic to my hope, I know this. And logic evades me again.
Steve shifts to pull Tony to rest upon his chest, and they lay in a wanton entanglement of limbs. He’s sated, utterly exhausted, floating in bliss, and from the expression gracing Steve’s face, it’s requited. But, Tony still has a question pulling at his mind.
Sweat…?
?” he asked, clearly bewildered.
But even the lyrics of a light-hearted song remind him of how under-anaesthetized he really is.
“It doesn’t mean
“Removing some of the vibranium won’t compromise the integrity of my shield?” Steve’s eyes were wide, curious, watching the inventor work. His imposing body was barely an inch from brushing against the genius.
“I feel it still, all of it. Don’t you?”
“Taking to the seas to go after Namor again, my dear pirate Captain,” he said, affect droll.
“Since no one else knows, I like to keep it that way, keep ‘em all guessing. If people knew, well, I’d imagine it would make things more complicated for me.”
_____________
. When I put the plane down, I accepted my fate, no matter the outcome. I'm alive, so, I should be grateful. I’m just fine.”
ものいわずに 思っただけで
“I can still hear him, Natasha. I don’t care what he’s telling everyone, I still remember...I still remember so much. I can still feel him on my skin, taste him on my tongue…”
He happily maintains control of Steve’s seduction until Steve’s waist is free of his pants. When they are fully exposed in the day’s fading orange glow, Tony’s enticing reign ends, and Steve overpowers him, utterly devouring every inch of his being.
I’ve received no letter from Tony. It must have been a mistake. They’ve informed me I’ll be permitted leave to attend the funeral, but in my state, I’m sure the permission will be revoked.
How could someone so full of life and fight and unparalleled energy just...disappear?
I’m told he left a letter to me. There’s a delay in retrieving it, some miscommunication with Jarvis, perhaps. I never told you this, but I was waiting for him to change his mind about something. Now, I guess he never will.
“What do you mean ‘just forget it?’” He bellowed, three drops of moisture falling to his hand.
“Oh, too hot? JARVIS, drop the temp.”
“But why? Why make them fall in love and get married? That’s some weird shit right there to force someone to do, even if it is aliens!”
“How is an alien gun any different from potential mind control?”
“Just like always. And then, you’ll have an incredibly stylish, one-of-a-kind piece of artisan jewelry, from yours truly.” Tony turned away from the shield to shoot a wink to Steve. “I’m putting my heart into this for you,” his tone quickly turned serious, determined brown eyes burning into his own unwavering gaze.
have me. And, you know what they
He already gave the order to close the wormhole, he watched it shrink into nothingness. He knows it's meaningless, but he can’t stop thinking about Tony.
“Ma used to tell me that when you kiss your soulmate in the rain, your soulbond will awaken and you’ll hear music that no one else can hear.”
“Just like always?”
Katy Perry kindly reminds him through her song of his own regret, how he wonders why he thought it was a good idea to fly into the darkness, into a wormhole, into another world.
Steve carried him to their bed, placed him down, and wrapped a warm blanket around him. He sat beside Tony humming a soft melody that sounded faintly familiar.
, so much I can never tell anyone else. The only thing that was important, I will now take to my grave. I only wish he knew...
“No,” he whispers. “I’m not the man they say I am. I refused to agree to the SHIELD’s desires once the attacks ceased. In retaliation, to ensure my exile, they’ve spread stories, committed atrocities in my name. I’ve been on a relentless quest to end their plight. It seems the SHIELD are not who they claim to be.”
“How very typical of you. You realize if you die here you’ll have lost everything. I’ll go free and your name will be forgotten for all of time. Is that what you desire?”
. Everything you felt, everything you
“C’mon!”
I never should have fought him, started a crusade against him. I know now what my ego has cost me, cost us all. I should have talked to him, been honest, broken down the walls that grew so thick between us over all these years.
Steve savors every second watching Iron Man shoot into the sky, fearing the seconds are limited, knowing they are disappearing too quickly. He has to think of something, anything, to prevent this-
Steve makes him feel invincible. Bulletproof. Like titanium.
“Hey, Tony, you’re ok, I’m here.”

“What?”
“Then you
It wasn’t worth it.
“I do, at least, JARVIS tells me so. I think sometimes I get lucky and forget by the morning. Well, not usually...but sometimes!”
“I think you’re gonna be alright, Steve.”
“You’ve killed thousands since the Avengers were dismantled. Burned countless cities to the ground. Hospitals, schools, orphanages. How could anyone covet being your prisoner?”
“Thought you liked to be restrained.” The voice is gruff now and he feels himself forcefully pulled into a bridal-style hold.
No. Nope. Not midnight, not stars, not piss in the bed.
“I’d love to hear when you think this song
“Then I don’t get what we’re doing here. Is this all just about keeping me on the team?”
“Yeah,” he huffs, and for a moment, it feels good to sit on the cool ground, breathing in the damp scent of moss and earth. He hears birds chirping in the distance, and through the thin gauze of his blindfold, he can determine a soft light is beginning to glow, likely from an early sunrise.
The ghost of the useless affirmation echoed in his empty body, dark and cold once again, devoid and hardened with misery. Maybe their stolen moments weren’t enough, and he would never find what he craved from Tony. The relief he found when they were together was fleeting, and it was beginning to take its toll. Maybe he’d been wrong about it all. It would be easier to walk away and never come back.
“So...is there a way to fix them? The shield and Stark’s reactor, I mean.”
The workshop was dimly lit as Tony carefully inspected the metal under an illuminated magnifying glass.
_____________
Tony’s unbearable heat was toppling him, fast. The brunette was tight, so tight, impossibly so, and Steve felt lightning rip through his core as his deep thrusts became uncontrollable spasms of pleasure. He chased his orgasm furiously, a man of pure desperation, trailing a high he once regarded a friend and with whom he would never reunite.
“For putting on the suit,” he huffed. “Well, it could be used for that. Or maybe I Indulge in wishful thinking from time to time.”
“I could ask you the same thing. Why are you being so weird? What’s so special about the date?”
“Oh. I guess I’ve lost track of the days.” Was it four weeks he’d been gone, then?
“Or maybe it makes it worse.” Steve let out a heavy sigh. “This is all just so unbelievable. I never would have thought, in the future…” He threw his arms up to gesture to Tony and the space they shared.
“...Ok,” he finally conceded.
“I’m here, you’re safe. Can I hold you?”
“That would be a solid incentive for the Chitauri to coerce their minds. Compromising Captain Rogers’ shield and inflicting a flaw to Stark’s heart is a subtle strategy, be it that one well-planned attack should secure their demise.”
“I never stopped loving you, Steve,” he whispers back before he’s kissing him again, long and slow, savoring every taste, every sensation of the intimacy for which he’s longed.
,” he gave Steve a taunting look, “yeah, the work is hard. I’m exhausted even consulting on some of the stuff SHIELD throws my way. But then I’m so tired I can’t sleep, and it’s just a vicious cycle. Concurrent insomnia and utter collapse, wrapped up in one perfect package. It’s awesome, I love it.”
are worth my time, my heart’s gleam.”
“Yeah,” Steve breathes, “it isn’t really my taste either. This one, though, I think you need to hear.”
“I think I’d like you to try, too.” Steve was looking at Tony now with such focus that his heart started to pound in his chest. That look was so captivating, he started to think the amorous affection rising in his chest had to be deceptive. Surely, Steve couldn’t be feeling such things, not now, not with him.
Steve moved slowly, pulling out almost completely, only to push back in all the way to slot their hips flush again. He steadily increased his pace, watching Tony thoughtfully, attuned to every cue that he might want more or less or something entirely different.
“Alright, gentlemen, if you could, uh, just settle into these two beds right here, we’ll, uh, get started.” Bruce’s demeanor was timid and nervous, which was nothing new, but at a time like this, it was less than reassuring. They did as they were instructed, and climbed into two large hospital beds, side by side. There were two other staff hovering about, gaze completely averted, and Fury, who silently surveyed everyone present.
Unable to look at each other, a heavy silence seemed to drain the life from the sterile room.
Bewildered brown eyes met his, and suddenly Steve felt like he could remember what he was supposed to be holding on to, if he could just stare a little bit longer -
But despite the long walks at sunrise, exploring weird places together, near-nightly dinners, and the constant, passionate, sex they shared, they still argued like nothing had changed since the day they met, Tony still sulked in his workshop for hours on end, Steve still repeatedly stuck his foot in his mouth, and could never sieze a moment to tell him what he knew.
“I’ve never been kissed in the rain. I want you to kiss me.”
” His voice was distant, removed, he was lost, somewhere far away, held by a fleeting, false memory he should feel guilty for chasing, an experience that wasn’t his to have.
Steve Rogers.
He’s only just woke up alive in this century, and the one person he’s grown closest to, despite their frequent spats, is about to die.
Steve wasted no time pressing Tony into the ground, rough and hard. He began to thrust, slowly, confidently, then increasing pace as the brunette ceased his own rhythm. It was obscene how Tony groaned and babbled and allowed Steve to take him, to pound him quickly, rapidly, with no reprieve. His head was spinning, it was too much, Tony was always too much, and even with sensation muted on every inch of skin other than his cock, he was overstimulated, overwhelmed, becoming shaky and erratic and -
Not that this was a
I was his soulmate. Tony wouldn’t have known this - he told me all the damage to his heart destroyed the faint tug he once felt ages ago. I never told him...there’s so much I never told him. I should have, but I didn’t. He didn’t want me, and my doubts whisper to me that even if he knew we were intended to be bonded, it wouldn’t have changed a thing. I know I should have told him, but I so desperately wanted him to want me without knowing this. Even so, knowing I was his soulmate, I still feel the golden thread tugging at my heart, guiding me to him. I don’t know how that’s possible to feel in death. I think it was the only thing that kept us connected all these years.
The words flowed from him, and he began to feel the tension in Tony’s muscles ease under his hands. Familiar warmth filled him, dropping lower and lower in his core. Suddenly, there was too much fabric between their bodies. God, why was he still wearing so many clothes?
_____________
Steve groaned as Tony nipped at his lower lip. His hands ran along every part of him that he could reach, until Tony’s clothes were so offensive, that he had to hastily do away with the fabric barrier.
“I love them. They’re perfect.” Tony punctuated his statement by placing a kiss on Steve’s cheek, standing on tip-toe to reach the perfect spot. “Your place looks great. You’re still comfortable here? Do you need anything else?”
, he thinks when the lyrics play through his mind, even though he doesn’t completely remember the exact JARVIS-translation from his inquiry the last time he heard this song.
“Oh, right, I didn’t think that one through,” he admitted bashfully.
“Are you wounded too, Tony? Do you hurt like I do? Do you feel the gaping hole in your body? Like something’s missing? Like you’re forgetting something important? I can’t let it go, I can’t let you go-”
“Please tell me nobody kissed me.”
An apathetic shrug was the only answer he would receive.
“What’s there to understand?” Steve pulled back to look deep into Tony’s eyes. “You found your soulmate.” Now, the clouds were far behind them, and like the candy Tony had offered him earlier, all of Steve’s troubles felt like they had melted away.
Slowly, he pushed into him, praise still falling from his lips like pearls. “
I now have no need for these concrete walls - my mind is a prison. It’s an endless vortex, ceaselessly spinning and sucking me further into its depths. I won’t fight it anymore.
The air was thick. In his mind, Tony’s apprehension was competing with Steve’s confusion. It was getting loud, overwhelming in his head. The only way out was to take a leap of faith, and Tony was willing to jump.
He emits a loud “
he thought.
He walked with a determined pace, looping around the back to a secluded garden. A brunette was standing against a sleek railing, looking out upon the city.
“I love feeling you like this.”
“That’s not exactly equitable, Tony.”
“Of the alien tech that’s making you behave like this.” The Director was clearly losing patience.
“Why wouldn’t they?”
“You alright?” Steve asks against his lips.
Steve leaned in.
There is nothing I would not give for that chance, or a chance to change his life.
“You must remove this so I can help.” Tony reaches for Nomad’s face, but he hisses and recoils. “Come, now, this is no time for that. Take off your armor!” He’s able to see the impossible break in the cowl, and is impressed that the piece hasn’t yet fallen away.
“Hey, someone’s gotta be prepared. So look, you like what you see?”

Tony echoed a gratuitous groan, assisting with the removal of his pants. “You’re next,

was trailing lower and lower, threatening to infect his heart and extinguish the flame.
Nothing I’ve done is worth anything if this is the cost. I can’t take it back. And I can’t tell him any of this. There’s so much I never said, and so much I should have told him. And now, there’s so much that I can only tell
Tony's hands tremble as he reaches to take the fractured cowl. The crack is horrifying, and he knows it’s a miracle the man is alive. He’s never seen the Captain’s face before, and the realization strikes his heart like lightning in a moment that he has no time to waste, so he proceeds despite his hesitance. When his hands rest upon the broken headpiece and his fingers begin to wrap around the edges, Nomad’s eyes meet his with a wild, horrified expression. And still, he’s not resisting, even though Tony now feels his terror as if it were his own.
Steve tightly grasped Tony’s hand, punctuated by a clang of metal hitting metal as their identical rings met. Something tried to distract his mind, questioning if he was trying hard enough. It was a thought easy to stifle as Tony began to nip at his neck.
As far as alien invasions go, this is an outcome Tony thinks he can tolerate. It’s just the beginning, he knows, realizing that there is as much darkness in the statement as there exists hope.
Steve nudged him in the knee with his own. “You bought this for me for Christmas,” he hissed in return.
Something instantly set his teeth on edge just by hearing Rogers’s voice. He wiggled his jaw back and forth periodically as Loki submitted and stepped into the S.H.E.I.L.D. jet without so much as a word or a scowl.
“I should go. It looks like you’ve got work to do,” she said thus confirming his suspicions that Agent Coulson was officially the worst party killer on the planet. He sighed and nodded. “But keep that thought for next time. I want to hear what you have in mind. I am interested,” she added before she gave him a quick peck on the cheek.
“You said this comes with a complimentary lunch?” Tony asked with a yawn.
Peter had settled almost instantly after Steve’s touch and blinked stupidly while his fingers reached to stroke the back of his neck. “Uh, congratulations for what exactly?”
Downstairs was exactly what Tony imagined a downstairs to a secret and dubious organization would be like. It was cool and lit with buzzing fluorescent lights hanging from the concrete ceiling. The zap of the prod to his neck still had him weakened significantly, so he could scarcely hold himself up, let alone fight off the brutes that dragged him.
Thanks for your suggestions, guys. I think what I’m going to do--along with all of the other story ideas that I have--is do a spin-off where Peter has boyfriend drama and Steve has to let his little guy grow up after being convinced to knock off the overprotective nature he has. So I’ll be creating a series and a new story most likely from Peter’s perspective.
I'm a total piece of shit, lol. Sorry. I got really distracted by this Starker fic that I  needed to get out of my system or I was literally going to implode. Now that I've got that over with, I can continue with the good stuff......and by good stuff I mean please have this transition chapter and don't hate me too much kthanksloveyoubye. <3 <3 The next chapter is going to be a big one.
“You know how incredibly lucky you are, Miss Potts? Besides getting to be my partner on this massively successful project?”
“Tony,” Steve interjected.
“Why is this something that they’re making me do? Do I look incompetent?” Tony was seething as he thumbed through his hospital admission papers. The two were standing in their kitchen late one weekend evening while Peter was out with his friends. Everything was ready, and Morgan was so close to arrival, so much that it was driving Tony crazier by the day.
While Tony spoke, Steve had returned home from his workout and had been creeping up on the teen, waiting for his time to speak up. He winked at Tony who maintained his poker face perfectly.
Again Tony wiggled his jaw, working ways to set up emotional defenses and snuff out any friendly advances. That shouldn’t have been his priority. He glanced at Loki then to Rogers beside him. “Of course it doesn’t seem right. I’m sure he could have put up more of a fight, or do you assume everything will be easy since you’re so powerful now?”
“Why is that worth celebrating?” Peter said meekly.
Peter gave a flicker of a shocked expression before answering. “Godfather? Really?”
He read about the Thor of legend. He was unsurprised by the lightning that stormed amidst the blackened clouds outside when a mighty being came storming into the jet. Before Tony could get a shot off, there came the sound of metal crunching as the intruder's fist came colliding against his chest.
“You don’t be so childish!”
Steve did not look at him but did put his hand onto the thigh offered as he snickered, teasing a snicker out of Tony in return.
Both Tony and Rogers watched in dumbstruck awe as Thor lifted Loki easily by the throat and pressed their faces close together. Thor was uttering something to the smaller of the two. He looked enraged. For a moment, Tony feared that the other would kill Loki right then and there. They couldn’t afford to lose Loki. They needed to know where he was hiding the Tesseract.
“Because it makes you unique and in a way like Tony. You’re going to be an omega that’s going to continue to help change the world. You’re going to prove that omegas are so much more than just a gender for procreation. I’m  proud.”
“Of course, Pete. Maybe more of a godfather officially, but you’re going to be living here and all.”
Okay, I decided I had a few more things to add to this story. More like I want to explore how Steve and Tony became a couple in the first place. So I guess enjoy!
I had to take a lot of time with this one, so thanks for waiting. You all are probably going to hate my guts. Sorry!
“Yes. To bed. I’ll be in after I shower.”
“Yikes, okay,” Peter jumped with a laugh.
Peter gave a smile and curled into his ball even tighter. It was a sense of security that he was clearly in sore need of. Tony was glad to see him relax and feel more confident. He smirked before he made a face to pretend like he was disgusted. “Gross, you two. Too much affection. I’m going to be sick. House full of omegas, you ego-stroking alpha,” he laughed.
Okay, so warning. I did decide to add some Pepper/Tony in this because I felt like there needed to be more context to their relationship and Tony's emotions towards realizing that it wasn't meant to be with her. So hetero sex and pegging is what's in store in this chapter. If you don't like that sort of stuff then just give it a good 'ol skip!

Tony somehow convinced himself that if he just stood still and pretended to be as menacing with his helmet off as it was on then he could get away with not being overpowered by some alpha ass.
Steve was hoisting Tony onto his feet when Thor swung his mighty hammer and flew away into the storm without so much as a word to them.
I've been having bad dizzy spells and concentration issues lately so forgive me if this chapter sounds retarded or if it's extra bad in grammar.
Tony shrugged, “I guess. Couldn’t explain it to you even if I wanted. The best I can do for you is be mysterious and say you’ll know when you know.”
Tony was ever the one to favor an entrance, so when he flew in on the conflict between Loki and Captain Steve fucking Rogers, he couldn’t help but showboat a little and strut his stuff. He was, after all, the omega in the iron suit, untouchable and powerful, and that made him feel superior even over his fathers legacy super soldier.
Steve cocked an eyebrow. “I don’t think that’s how it’s supposed to go, but you know that I can’t help but love you despite all of your adorable annoyances. My beautiful omega with my precious baby girl. I’m so happy!” he sighed sweetly as he wrapped his large arms around Tony.
“Soon probably.”
“Everything hurts. Don’t touch me,” Tony moaned as he leaned forward again. His whole body was shaking, and along with that came the uncontrollable urge to push. “I’ve gotta push!”
Steve reached for the boy again and ran his fingers through his soft hair. Steve was feeling like a proud alpha with a healthy family of omegas for him to take care of, not that he hadn’t thought that before, but it was most likely much stronger for him after Tony’s heat and the onset of Peter’s first heat.

“No, I don’t do that. Just sit this one out, and I’ll bring Loki back. Can’t expect you to be of much use in a fight against lightings and hammers.”
“I know it’s been a hot minute since anything remotely romantic has happened between us, but I was reading up on how to kick start labor. Apparently, sex can help get things going. Care to help a guy out?”
“I said you’re welcome. For coming in to capture the Grinch over there. Looked like you needed help. Not a problem. You are freshly thawed and about 90 years young now. No one blames you if you have a few performance issues here and there along the way.”
When Loki yielded after hardly a scratch to him, Tony could hear the super soldier greet him cordially, causing him to stiffen, but otherwise remain cool. “Captain,” he replied.
Shame on him for removing his helmet. He immediately regretted his decision. He could smell a delicious alpha. Of course, Steve Rogers was an alpha, and by the smell of it quite an alluringly powerful one too. It was stupid of Tony to expect anything less. He fluttered his eyes a moment as the smell of something so tantalizing washed over him.

While the hatch doors closed the two men and the prisoner in the hold, Tony stood a little more rigid. He crossed his arms and observed Loki’s appearance. How flattering green and black with such luscious locks. He reminded Tony of a high school kid gone punk rock and angsty.
Steve resented his own unshakable grim mood, hanging back from the group, willing himself to shake it off.  Despite the warmth of the room, he could feel a chill in his bones.
Clint whooped, “Out!”
Tony opened his mouth, shut it, then frowned.  He looked even more put out, like Steve had asked why his mother had died on him.
“Oh, what-

“But you

Recognizing there was no easy way out of this one, Steve sighed and took the box.  “Thank you, Jeanie.”
Tony frowned.  “Me?”  He straightened Steve’s jacket, then shook his head.  “What makes you think I’m—not?”
He whistled again.
“Besides,” Natasha went on.  “Do you really want to run this by yourself?”
“Sad for what?” Tony asked, mirroring him.
Tony grimaced at the thought, rubbing his hand over his face.  “Whatever.  Bastard,” Tony added for good measure.
The latter was made bearable only by Sam Wilson, who finally rescued him for lunch.
Tony shook his head in honest disbelief.  He had not spoken in eight minutes.  Steve was starting to worry.
He only started to worry when he saw the first planetary body.

Clint shrugged.  “Just your average run-of-the-mill pathological opportunist.”  He tugged on the shield, found it secured to Steve’s arm, and wisely bounced back a few feet when Steve lifted it warningly in his direction.  Retreating around the corner, he said loudly, “Still can’t believe you and Stark

Tony held his ground.  “No.”

Steve held his gaze.  Tony looked at him, then slid the bowl of blueberries to him, a clear bribe.
“You can have words with him later,” Natasha assured.  “I think you should rest.”
Rogers squeezed his hand.
“They seemed happy,” Anij said softly.  Sojef laid a steadying hand on her shoulder.  “We would have given them the same choice, to leave if they so desired.  But time was of the essence.”
“Too busy climbing mountains,” Tony said with a self-deprecating shrug.  “We summitted Mount Everest—ever heard of it?”
Rhodes gave him a flat look.  “There’s something wrong with you,” he said.
“Put him in a box, poke a few holes in it, and drop it off at S.H.I.E.L.D. H.Q.,” Tony instructed.
“Five-five-five, five-five-one,” Clint repeated.
Warily, Tony idled one step closer.  “I don’t know if I like desperate on you,” he joked.  Tried to.  His own voice sounded strained.  “Which is weird, because normally I love when my partners—”

Thankfully, Tiberius still loved to hear himself talk, and Tony was in a mood to sit back and listen.  He was not really listening until Tiberius said, “Is that what I think it is?”
“He appears in some duress,” Stovok observed calmly.

“Missed you, too,” Tony said, staying where he was and noticing a flashlight over Bruce’s shoulder, Clint’s voice whining in the near distance:
He blamed Gravemarker for his pain and his anger, for his frustration and guilt.  He blamed Gravemarker for breaking him wide open and leaving him so damn vulnerable.
“You could say that,” Tony said, a grin breaking out on his face.  A matching grin appeared on Thor’s, undemanding.
“No—starts with a B,” Clint insisted.
Steve gripped the top of the ledge.  “Steve,” Tony insisted.
“No,” Tony whispered.  Steve had earned the truth.

“And, indeed, successful.”
Bruce glowered at his hand, then him.  “Take a bite,” Tony insisted.  “I’m gonna call it a Nibiran snowball.”
“I’m Juliet,” the employee added.  “It’s very nice to meet you.”
Had he died?  Was this the grim reality of the next life?  He chafed a hand over his arm, but it did not feel real to him.
Bruce, at least, seemed relieved at the newfound breathing room, while Clint had been surfing the radio for the better part of an hour.

Goddamnit.
Hand-in-hand, they entered the sterile office. The bright white color of the walls and furniture were unnerving to Steve since the first time he set foot in the medical bay. It was a somber mood, even though no one spoke a word.
“Yeah,” he echoed. Steve was steadfast as always, and slowly the tension began to ease. It would always live within him, Tony knew that much, but Steve gave him hope that he could find healing one day. It was a belief he clung to with every fiber of his being.
“And now you’re
And this time, he believed it.

For the first time in hours, he felt like he could relax.  “Thank you.”

Instead, he reached for Steve’s hand again, but Steve tired of the game, gripping the edge of the tub hard enough that Tony gave up on having it for his own.  How utterly unlike him, Steve thought, and sighed.
“It’s not about
With a sigh, Tony turned to
“Three million in backpay,” Tony went on.  “At least a hundred on the table, in sponsorships, donations.”
“I’ll be damned,” he said softly.
“Resuming.”
Tony turned the words over in his head, then, with a start, recognized their meaning:
The days were long, communicating with Pepper and literal company, keeping abreast of his fellow Avengers, and working on technology that would someday save the world from itself.  In the middle of it all, he found room for Marker—as much room for Marker as he possibly could.
“It’s more the groveling,” Tony admitted.
“Don’t goddamn interrupt me, this is for the well-being of civilization,” Iron Man ordered.  “Now.  The point is, we’re all going to live inside Iron Man suits for the rest of our lives.  That’s it.  No more adult fun times, we are all going to—I’m not done,” he protested, as Steve forcibly dragged him out of frame.  “They’re going to love the sanitation pitch, it’s—really gross.  That reminds me, I might have peed.  Can we take five?”
Tony pushed hard enough he could have shoved Steve right off the bench if he did not plant his own feet.  “Dammit, Tony,” he complained, unfolding and throwing his hood back to glare at Tony properly.  Without a word, Tony slid back until they were not touching at all, and Steve felt cold and disappointed.  “What do you want?” he repeated neutrally.
Steve stayed silent.  Tony wheezed.  “All right,” Steve snapped.  “You’ve made your point.”
“Right,” Steve said, relaxing when Thor let go of him.  “On your honor.”
Bruce thoughtfully picked up a puzzle piece.  Steve resisted the urge to give both of them a proper dressing down on time management.  He could already hear the scoff of
“It is good to have you back,” Captain Carter acknowledged, looking up at Stovok, who inclined his head in mute agreement.  She ran a fine ship, and it was well known that Admiral Fury favored her, for her ability to bring together such disparate personalities as Commander Stovok, one of Starfleet’s only Vulcan members, and Ensign Barton, one of the finest and most annoying pilots in the galaxy.
amount of sincerity, Tony corrected himself.  He needed to stop reading into it.  Vulcans were made of stone.  Almost literally—there was hardly anything else to work with on barren, superheated Vulcan but stone.  Stark men, supposedly, were made of iron, but Tony could point to his lovely space suits and then his own flesh and blood and draw the distinction.  “Proceed, Stark.  I do not want to make you.”
Jeremiah—or was it Ezekiel?—instantly turned tail, but his brother continued sniffing at Steve’s pocket longingly.  “Sorry, pal,” Steve told him, patting him on the head.  “No treats today.”  And he actually felt bad about it, that he did not have a scrap for a dog.
look.  Always so funny and helpful, that Tony Stark.
A crackly voice responded faintly, “
, Bucky reminded.
It all started with the morning news.
Lured by the commotion, the bloodhounds came running.  “Jeremiah!  Ezekiel!  Get back here!” Coleman shouted from the opposite end of the orchard.
“Like the Briar Patch,” Hill said.
And there was a whole universe out there, full of countless aliens, more planets than they could ever explore, and enough wonders to satisfy until the end of time, and still, nothing seemed more wonderful to Tony than getting to share the colors of Stovok’s dreams.
Steve sighed, steered him adamantly away from the cooking area, and sat him at the table instead.  “No, I’m a
The humanoid looked at him.  The whole tribe watched.
Steve stepped up to Thor.  “You hear it, too?”
“Oh, uh—hi,” Bruce greeted.  “Hi.  I like birds,” he explained, then winced, like he had already said too much.  “I mean, they’re very—scientifically, I mean—”
“. . . It sounds weird, when you say it like—”
Then, in a show of tactical mindfulness, Steve toggled the power switch.
“I resent that,” Clint replied, seated across from her.
and insist on fixing all the loose and screwy parts of himself.
“You don’t know that.”  Tony stubbed out the cigarette, closed it up in a tin case, then nodded over his shoulder.
“No,” Steve said.  “No, she didn’t need to.  Think we put the fear of God back in him.”
. o .
It was impressive how much a decapitated Iron Man suit could affect an air of such matronly disapproval.  “Sir, that is deeply inhumane.”
.  He rested a hand on the glass, but found it cold to the touch, retreating back a full step.
They arrived at the Field Museum.
stick around showed Steve how deep this wound ran.
Tony Stark’s bedroom was a sacred space.  A space untouched by demons—carefully curated to keep the monsters out, to be a fortress against harm.
Steve nodded, still looking at him hungrily.  Then he embraced Tony again.  Tony sighed against his shoulder, patting his back and insisting, “Fine.  I missed you, too.”
They were halfway to the car when Steve picked up on the distressed quality of Tony’s breathing.  “You okay?” he asked, not raising any alarms yet.
faster, there was no way Clint could win in a dead heat—but Clint, through moxie alone, tagged first base, half a second before Steve tagged him with the tennis ball.
P.S. What Steve calls "Brontosaurs" are actually sauropods, AKA those lovely long-necked dinosaurs! The Carnegie is home to a
The clop of hoofbeats pulled him back from the silence.  “Ah.  Ye Olde Amish,” Tony said.
“All right,” Steve cut off.  “I get it.  I’m a dumb cuss who doesn’t know monkey peanuts from ice cream peanuts anymore.  I wish I could drink.  Anything I miss?”
. Cozy!
He landed in Steve’s arms.
From below, Clint whooped joyfully.  Steve drew in a long breath, letting the cold crystallize in his lungs, focus his thoughts.  The commanding officer in him railed against it—
Steve, who was equally as accustomed to night travel as day trips, did his best to ignore him, focusing on the road and the road alone.  Natasha had called up an electric map on the car’s dashboard, which would supposedly take Steve anywhere he wanted to go.  The coordinates were already locked in, so he just had to follow them.
Clint gave in to temptation and swung hard.  Steve parked himself in the right place and waited for gravity to do the rest, catching the ball neatly in palm.  “Out,” he called.
When Snow appeared, she was not like lightning but smoke, wafting up from below.  She was unaccompanied, but Tony did not mind—with a careful jet, he lifted off Marker, floating away as the two dragons hovered before each other, two thinking beings exchanging silent words.

. o .
Gorn.”
Tony just smiled, very self-satisfied.  “It’s the little things, dear heart.”
“God, damn, that’s a cake,” Tony acknowledged, stepping around the corner without his suit, Lucky yelping joyfully in the great distance.
Hill left.  Steve waited a full five seconds after her footsteps had retreated from the door before turning slowly to Natasha.
Cap tried to push him upwards from under the arms, but Tony whined in real pain and he stopped.  “A little help?” Cap pleaded.
Natasha was right: there was no way
you’re—”
Steve scowled.  Thor snored on.  Looking around the snow-dusted alley, Steve said, “I have an idea.”
“Then he’ll make a wonderful substitute for you,” Tony finished, pinching his nose.  “You think Romanova and Barton will come?”
“This ain’t exactly brisk.”  With a sigh, Steve nevertheless slowed his pace.  “Why didn’t you bring your suit?”
Tony paused, back to Steve.  Then Tony deflected, “I’m tired, I’m going to bed.”  He wasn’t tired and he was definitely not going to bed.  He was sore, but he resisted the urge to rub his chest.  It would only make it worse.  “I’m tired,” he repeated out loud.  “I don’t wanna talk about it.”
Clint looked at Steve halfheartedly.  Steve said, “Touch her and I’ll break your arm.”
, too
“Drawer,” was all Tony said.
A terrible idea beamed in Tony’s genius brain.
—before coming to the bitter conclusion that he was, somehow, someway, in charge of them.  Or, at least, he felt like it.  Their safety was his priority.
Tony almost felt he had not earned the privilege, even as Steve granted it.  Tony Stark’s hands had hurt people.  They had ripped a gash in his own chest that only the arc reactor could fill.  They had done so much harm in the search for good that he hesitated to extend them, to simply
“Fast,” Rhodey said.  He looked Tony over.  “You gonna be okay?”
“Yup,” Tony said, voice terse.
Over the pitcher’s mound, Clint and Thor were locked in a dead heat over what must have been the final tennis ball, with Thor holding one arm high in the air and Clint clinging to it tenaciously.  “Drop it,” Steve told them.  Neither Thor nor Clint relented.  Steve said again, “
Tony had no sooner taken a seat at the table then the merry band of Starfleet voyagers arrived.  Still dressed in their spacesuits, they stood out only in stature.  “Who leads this community?” Liaison Hill asked authoritatively.
Steve huffed a laugh, which grew into real laughter as Tony squirmed under his arm and huddled for protection in his lap.  “Aw, c’mon, Tony, it’s just a dog.”
Steve inclined his head.  “Five,” he agreed.
In the end, only Clint earned the fabled “Banned for Life” title.  Thor was a hero; Bruce was simply a key witness.
Tony nodded once, then tilted to rest his head on Steve’s shoulder.  Steve rested his own cheek against the top of Tony’s head.
With a careless shrug, Tony said, “He misses Loki.  He might be madder than a hatter but—honestly, I’m kind of impressed Thor chose our side.  Would you fight your blood?”
“What—”  Steve removed the bucket, let it fall to the ground noisily, turning to look at him.  “What

,” Bruce Banner admitted on-screen.  “
“Release me,” Stovok instructed.  “Now.”
, he thought, justifying it.
“You gotta let go,” Cap reminded.
“Yes,” Tony said at once.
, Tony chanted, pacing the floor, waiting impatiently for Happy to appear.  Marker was cheerfully devouring a butchered ewe, while four of the six hatchlings risked life and limb to carve off smaller snippets from his prize.  The other two hatchlings had curled up with Snow, who looked troubled, her attention drifting from Marker to Tony and then the door.
Ten minutes and one phone call later, a slightly out-of-breath zoo employee met them at the gate, opening it manually with a slight screech of metal.  “Come on in,” the employee greeted.  “Hope you don’t mind walking and talking.  We start to wrap up operations at five o’clock on the dot, most days.”
When he came to, he was in a state of shock, and mercifully alone.  He heard distant, hair-raising clicking sounds, followed by wet crunching noises.  He realized, suddenly, that he had evaded a very close call through another’s misfortune, and that, if he did not evacuate the territory immediately, he might still be on the menu.
Steve scowled at him automatically, bristling.  “I don’t want to feed the hogs.”

“Aw.”  Tony bumped his knee.  “One bad taste and I’m scratched?  Ouch.”

Lying down with him was far more intimate than sitting with him on a metal table.  Iron Man’s weight pressed him down, incredibly warm, heavy with the animal knowledge that he was beyond human, enhanced—
“Then I will respond semi-urgently,” Tony replied, looking out at the ocean, drink dangling from a hand.
“Don’t

He gasped, aware that he wasn't being professional, that he wasn't
“So am I.”  He took a long sip from his drink, then said, “

Tony folded his arms across his chest, looking genuinely disgruntled.  Then he said: “Wait a sec.  You’re here.  So—Purgatory.  Right?  There’s no way you’re going to Hell.”

uncomfortable?” Tony deflected.
Nomad finally slows, and Tony spots a small opening under sheets of rock. “It would be wise to shelter in the cave,” he advises, and Nomad carries them closer, releasing Tony cautiously to the ground. “Come,” he instructs, ducking under the low threshold to enter the space.
“So, does that mean we’re gonna do this little ritual every time?” Tony teased.
“What is?” Steve could feel his breath quicken.
“Yeah.”
Tony shivered again, burying his face further into Steve’s broad chest. “Ok,” he breathed, “take me home.”
Nomad takes off running at lightning speed, and Tony is able to glance around to see no signs of their attackers. He looks up and sees there is a crack in the cowl from where the crimson drips, and Tony isn’t so incapacitated that he can’t understand that Nomad saved his life, only to take control of it again.
The attack was unlike anything they had ever known. Thanos wasn’t just some legend they had been warned of. He was supremely formidable, and after sparing no expense, exhausting every option, strategy, and tactic they had ever discussed, Thanos was no more.
“Steven Grant Rogers-”
“I didn’t mean about others,” Steve laughed. “I meant for you.”
“Yeah, well, gossiping’s more fun.”
“It’s a lot.” Tony supplied pithily.
“Tell me,” he begs.
Tony stopped abruptly as the door thudded closed in his face.
“Bruce, so you’re sure this will get rid of any Chitauri tech, if there is any?” Steve asked in a more hushed tone, even though he knew everyone in the room could hear him.
“You need to hear the things I tell you, sure, that’s step one. Bigger than that, you need to believe them. And most important of all, you need to tell yourself these things.”
“Did you think love could last forever?”
His mind is coming back into focus, he’s feeling more steady.
Tony doesn’t respond, doesn’t slow down.
Maybe Rihanna had seen Tony fly before singing this. Even against the onslaught of frenzied aliens, Tony looks beautiful. He shines brilliantly.
“You’re safe.” Steve interrupted his buzzing mind with words that sounded so certain. How could he be so sure? “Remember what I told you? The first time we kissed?”
“You don’t look ‘just fine.’”
Sincerely,
Alone with his thoughts, Steve came to understand what the phrase ‘deafening silence’ really meant.
_____________
“...Fine. But I have to be the one to give it to him.”
This song Steve does recognize, and Tony was right about how he knows it. He’d been listening to the radio in a futile attempt to find comfort similar to what he would do when he was young. But now, the music that plays is jarring, unlike anything he was accustomed to hearing.
He tries to fight, but feels weary, and the next thing he knows his wrists are being tied together again. This time, the binding is more comfortable, but still unbreakable.
Nomad considers him carefully before stating, “Love is not essential to a marriage.”
, he thought.
A gloved hand descends upon his mouth.
“Never mind,” Tony laughs, and Steve suspects some sort of reference has flown over his head, as he reaches up and grabs an alien off of a building wall.
“Your beard’s getting long again.”
A thin trail of light flooded from the crack in the door. Tony watched it furtively, until it began to grow. He ducked his head in his arms wrapped around his legs.
He knows the words probably don’t mean what they sound like they do. But that doesn’t bother him. The sentiment is there, all the same, and he feels emboldened.
I thought I had time to fix things with him. I thought if I served my sentence, when I was released, I’d be able to mend it all with him. I agreed to the sentence, forsaking the deal he fought to offer me, all in the name of being a united front. I wanted to appear as if we were undivided again, show the world that we could agree on something meaningful. And I told myself, if the world sees this, sees what I’m doing, maybe he will see it too. Maybe I’ll be able to change his mind, prove to him our undeniable magnetism, show him how good we are together.
There was a stability in Tony that grounded Steve. His touch was warm and soothing, his hugs were settling, his kisses - nourishing. Tony had changed - he had lost his suits, no longer accompanied missions, didn’t travel from the compound. But Tony's affections remained constant, and Steve welcomed every opportunity to indulge.
?” He was building trust, but Steve was still sharp enough to know Tony wasn’t being entirely forthcoming. If he wanted to keep building upon the little they had, he knew he would have to be more honest about himself.
An ethereal, otherworldly melody plays as Tony staggers toward the bar. He pours himself a large glass of Glenlivet and slumps into a couch. JARVIS is now informing him that Pepper, Rhodey, and the medical team are all requesting to speak to him, asking for access to the penthouse.
“We are not soldiers!” Tony snapped. And Steve started listening.
“The scans confirm the Chitauri managed to embed a small chip under your skin.
“I think I no longer know who you are.”
Tony pulls back quickly to look at the wound properly, but there’s blood and he can’t see. He takes off his outer robe and begins to dab at the wound. Steve hisses, and recoils a bit, but it’s only to reach into his bag and retrieve a jar of water. He offers it to Tony, who accepts it, and after pouring a bit on his jacket, he allows the remainder of the water to run down Steve’s face.
“Steve?” Tony jumped to his feet as Steve approached, hips swaying with an exaggerated swagger, a ridiculous plastic sword hanging off an oversized belt fastened by a gaudy golden buckle. Steve’s eyes were nearly obscured by the brim of a floppy chestnut-colored hat adorned with the largest crimson feather he’d ever seen, and upon closer inspection, Tony could see a large golden hoop hanging from one of Steve’s ears. The look was made complete with a weathered, striped shirt that loosely hung from Steve’s shoulders, and slouching dark boots that clunked loudly as he walked.
A gentle movement swayed his body, and he felt a pressure wrap around his waist. Tony was holding him, sitting beside him. Tony tentatively wrapped around Steve, until he began to lose sensation in his legs from the uncomfortable kneel. His body slumped to the ground finally, and he wrapped an arm securely around Tony to guide him to rest upon his chest. They remained unmoving, except for the gentle rhythm of Tony’s body rocking with soft sobs.
They settled into an easy evening, enjoying popcorn and movies while snuggled close on Steve’s modestly-sized sofa. As the hours grew small, Steve noticed Tony start to nod off in between action sequences. “Hey, maybe it’s time to call it a night?” He suggested gently.
“I mean, it must be especially difficult for them, living here with everyone, all of us
“SHIELD felt you’d adjust best with some exposure therapy. I’ve got the best cutting-edge tech, considering that I make most of it myself. I can teach you all you need to know to be a savvy nonagenarian thriving in the twenty-first century.” Not to mention the other asset he possessed that SHIELD wasn’t aware of. He was secretively confident his empathic aptitude would be immeasurably helpful in Steve’s recovery.
“I had to help. I just wanted to keep you safe.” He spoke with decisive confidence, hoping his display might be enough to sway Steve from the subject. Sadly, it didn’t do the trick.
As Steve was about to concur, the song started to become more clear, and it was growing more and more familiar with each note. He glanced up to the tower, to find the team hanging out of an open window - he didn’t know any of the windows actually opened - Natasha with a large speaker in hand.
“Except this time we’ll get a photographer.”
“You said when you have nightmares that you usually distract yourself with something novel?”
Tony immediately shot an incredulous look to Steve. “The sixth.” He replied, annoyed, stopping abruptly in his tracks.
that marked his neck along his hairline. “Took me forever to find it,” he had slurred. “Rhodey was actually the one who finally saw. No one else ever noticed. Till then, thought I had no soulmate.” It took all of the training he had endured to restrain himself from lunging at Tony right then and there. A first kiss with his soulmate, when he’s drunk, wasn’t the dream Steve held close for all of his years.
“I remember I was happy.” Tony faltered at the admission, averting his eyes away. It caught Steve off guard, to finally see him react to something he’d said. Steve hesitated, then, after a pause, “I know you keep saying you don’t remember anything, but-”
. Darkness filled his mind. He felt it growing and filling every space, sucking and consuming everything it encountered. He missed the warmth, he missed the light, he missed Tony. He couldn't breathe, his chest was clenched with an impossibly tight hold constricting his ability to breathe.
“I was scared, Tony.”
In the brisk air of the city, Steve secured his gear just outside of the building. He wouldn’t let himself be bothered by the fact that his utility belt was a few ounces lighter on the left side. He needed time to think. Keeping the phone would just cause more pain.
After this meal, they’ll all go their separate ways, eventually. And he’ll be left with whatever an alien invasion bequeaths.
“True love.”
Tony gingerly crossed a humble threshold. With his hands in his pockets, he maintained an air of casualty that Steve knew was disingenuous. Steve watched with solicitous eyes as Tony carefully surveyed the pitiful room, employing a level of focus a piece of art displayed at the MoMA more deserved. “‘S not bad,” came the unconvincing reply.
“No.” Steve replied abruptly. “I’m fine.”
,” his voice broke when he said his name. It was a fair question. Steve’s job, after all, was to be sure the team functioned in a state of cohesion. But this was a ritual that had far surpassed his professional obligations in both intimacy and affection. “No.
Steve’s cheeks immediately flushed. “Oh, I didn’t mean to assume-”
Or, in this case, the nuke into outer space. Into the wormhole.
“Oh so now you think it was forced?”
“-I thee wed.”
He must have fallen asleep on their journey. He was so disoriented he didn’t remember how he got to the abandoned basement of SI’s archives unit, nor was he conscious of his departure from the place. All he knew was that Steve was there. Steve was taking him home. Steve would make sure he was ok.
I never told you this, but I knew something about Tony. I never told him, either. I wanted him to change his mind about me, first.
A quiet day in New York allowed for a lazy day in the tower for the Avengers. It started with snacks, then board games, then arguments over everyone’s favorite movies. Part way through another of Clint’s vehement suggestions, Tony slipped out of the common room. Steve glanced at the remaining members of the team, who didn’t seem to notice, and decided to excuse himself as well.
He pressed a kiss to Tony’s head. Holding him, Steve felt his boyfriend drift off to sleep.
“Yes! I mean, no. I would not mind seeing this look again. And what a look it is!” Tony gave Steve an exaggerated once-over from head to toe, eliciting a laugh first from Steve, then from Tony.
“No. Of course not.”
I regret it, I regret all of it. I know my views on the S.H.R.A. were right, but the way I went about it, I got it all wrong.
Thoughts of his lost lover fill his mind before everything goes dark.
Steve saw the instant shift in the genius’ demeanor. Tony couldn’t play coy anymore. His smug expression had evolved into a completely devious grin. Steve couldn’t allow Tony the self-satisfaction - he reached down to pull the brunette by his arm to stand, bringing their bodies so close, the space between them was imperceptible.
“It’s fading away from me, I’m fighting to remember...but I know it’ll all be gone soon.
“The, the
“Eh, just some sparkling juice. Non-alcoholic. Figured it doesn’t make a difference to you, and it should make a whole lot to me.”
Something jerked away from his hand, and as the world slowly began to come into focus, he realized the face of a horrified Tony Stark was staring intensely at him, lost somewhere in confusion.
I haven’t been with anyone since...and you, you never noticed? What the hell did you think I was doing? What have we been doing all this time if you don't even know the date when our world changed?” Tony had backed away a few steps. His face was bewildered, searching Steve for something he clearly couldn’t find. “How was I so stupid?” He barely breathed the question as he crossed his arms upon his chest. He looked impossibly small, standing mere feet away, and Steve’s heart ached knowing he was who caused this.
“I can’t forget what happened!”
Nomad - no,
- no, of course not. The man had just been pulled from the ocean, thawed from a block of ice, awoken in a new century where phones are portable and a four-course meal can be cooked in an instant. Steve was alone, with no knowledge of the times or what it took to stay afloat in the future. This evening was simply an offer to help orient, possibly acclimate, Steve to his new world, maybe help Steve to see what he could or could not handle. At least, that’s what Tony told himself it was, assuming that’s what Steve needed it to be.
Anything to distract his mind from -
“Perhaps you never knew me to begin with. Have you considered the alternative should I have left you? You don’t know what those thieves desired. I’ve saved you from your fate.”
I hope you receive this letter before the news inevitably broadcasts the funeral. I want to let you know I will be in attendance, although I am not sure I will be afforded opportunity to speak with you should you be present as well.
“I’m sorry. Am I supposed to know what today is?”
May 6th, 2018
Fury approached them after the ceremony. “Gentlemen, I believe we need to talk.”
Walking through Gramercy Tavern.
“Not with this blindfold,” he retorts. “Remove it and I’ll show you just what I can do.”
A hazy memory of Steve’s unassuming smile, honest and humble, only a couple dozen of inches from his own lips, catches him, and he stops breathing.
_____________
“Would that really be so bad?”
He never noticed how frequently his left thumb brushed against the calloused underside of his third finger. The movement met no resistance, and with each subtle caress the tired hollowness ached in his heart.
I’m told the funeral is approaching. It’s surreal. The formidable, indestructible, incredible, Iron Man. How can we hold a funeral for a man made of iron?
“Does it make the work you do harder to deal with?” Tony was struck with tenderness again. Steve really seemed invested in Tony’s pain. Which, actually, was Steve’s pain. So maybe it made sense. Or, no, it really didn’t. But either way, Tony was finding himself glad he’d confided in Steve.
A glimmer of gold catches his eye, plummeting quickly-
“Hmm...not really, I can’t wait until then.” He drew closer, wrapping his arms around the smaller man securely, tightly. Tony laughed, nuzzling into his broad chest.
_____________
He throws his body weight and slips from Nomad’s grasp. Crashing to the ground, he rolls down the mountainside until he can catch himself by bracing his forearms and legs rigidly. Tony scrambles to his feet and bolts. He doesn’t care where he goes. He won’t consent to Nomad’s offers. He would prefer not to die at the hands of his former teammate, and decides that to die at the hands of any other would be less degrading, so he runs.
“I...I don’t see how that’s a party.” Natasha dryly retorts.
“The serum?” Steve’s face screwed up. “What do you feel?”
“I, uh, I see that...woah, I’m, um, did I wake you?”
When it’s completely off, he freezes. His body is shaking now, and he can’t believe what he sees.
Wormhole.
“Every time I kissed you, you didn’t know what we were doing? Every time I held you while you had a nightmare, you didn’t know what we were doing? Every time you fucked me, every time you came inside me, while I moaned your name...that wasn’t some indication to you?” Heat had returned to Tony’s face, wetness glistening on his cheeks. “Then, the world ends, and I give up all my suits for you, to save you and protect you, and I sit here, day after day, waiting for you, and you don’t think to figure out what the hell we’re doing?”
, it hissed.
Finally, Tony mumbled, “I’ve gotta get some air,” as he pushed past the threshold.
appropriate,” Tony purrs. Steve is relieved his face is obscured by rubble as he pushes forward against the invaders so no one can see his blush.
can’t even say something nice, it must have been shit.” A genuine spark shone through Tony’s words. He chanced a passing glance over his shoulder before abruptly looking away. “Your accommodations always this, uh, modest?”
“It’s ok, Tony. You don’t have to tell me right now. I just want to take you home.”
And you know what? Tony is to blame, too. He denied me, forsake me, and tore us apart. And why? Why would he do this? To me, to us, to the world?
He couldn’t remember much, and what he did remember was dwindling with every passing second. But he remembered the sex. Nothing exactly specific, but he remembered the fluidity, a balanced giving and taking, the cohesive equity or tender, shared intimacy. He remembered the feeling - not the feeling of climax or release, but of peace and serenity and warmth afterward. The ineffable feeling of being Tony Stark’s lover. And he knew the ache and longing and absence that festered in the wake of these shared sensations.
Tony suffers through the aftermath of the Chitauri invasion of New York, desperately seeking relief through music.
“Pink Floyd. Classic. Catch up with the now-times, Cap.” Tony’s digitized voice competes with the music in Steve’s head.
“We don’t even remember it! How could you know what you want if you don’t remember!” He was lashing out, he was spiraling, threatened, maybe the right push could get him to unravel...
“I said c’mon!”
The word echoes through the penthouse. It’s hardly a romantic song, superficial at best, definitely uninspired, and despite all that, Tony decides it’s possibly the best song he’s heard in his life. Because Steve told him to listen to it. Because Steve heard this god-awful song and thought of him. Wait, no, that’s not right - because in spite of this god-awful song, Steve thought of him. And now, here he was, standing before him, tears in his eyes, deliberately trying to annoy Tony as much as Tony tried to annoy Steve.
Steve sent in response.
Holding his gaze, Tony rocked his hips, and Steve’s body fluttered in response.
_____________
And he thinks of Steve.
Tony let out a heavy sigh. Tentatively, he bit at his lower lip, anguished, again and again, wrestling with a thought so loud Steve could almost feel the words vibrating on his skin. In the end, Tony’s control maintained. A decoy question was uttered instead, a veiled attempt to distract from the million-dollar question that would remain unanswered. “Did anyone take pictures?” His voice was strained.
“The music you played, it really helped boost morale.” Steve’s shoulders are more relaxed, and he starts to shift on his feet a bit. “Thank you for bringing the team together in such an unconventional way.”
_____________
“And how exactly do you expect me to do that here?” Tony remarked, matter-of-fact in his challenge.
They stayed like that, bodies pressed flush, skin sticky with sweat and come, for a while as they both came down from orgasm. With their foreheads pressed together, sharing one breath, Steve felt as though he could stay like this forever.
Steve studied Tony. Clearly he wasn’t convinced.
“Yeah.” Steve takes Tony’s hand in his own, and has that stupid grin on his face, the one he always had when he was about to say something romantic. “That was the greatest year of my life, my heart’s gleam.”
“I felt pain, and I couldn’t
The futurist, dead? Earth remains vulnerable in the wake of this loss.
“Tell me what you feel.” Tony faltered, hesitant. “I’ll tell you, too, just tell me, Tony, it can’t be bad,
“He...uh, he tried to…”
I received a letter from Tony.
Hushed voices paused him as he was dressing for bed. Small rituals were the only things that held some semblance of logic in this upside down, nearly unrecognizable world. It took a moment to register the familiar tones, and a moment longer to comprehend why they were coming from just outside his door. Steve couldn’t help but freeze - without any will of his own to stop it, he allowed himself to overhear the conversation.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is requesting an audience, and I think it wise to allow him-”
I just feel insulated from the world now that the sentence is finalized. I know it’s what I agreed to, and I accept full responsibility for my actions, and the crusade I lead. But I can’t believe, I just can’t accept what they’re telling me.
“You...want him back?” Natasha recoiled for an imperceptible moment before leaning closer to Steve, a weak attempt to console him.
“You mean it?” Tony asked hesitantly. “I really don’t want to keep you up any more than I already have.”
He knew Tony well, and he knew the uniform was the most erotic fixation of Tony’s mind. These days, that was one of the only things that could push Steve over the edge, too.
“How are your theories coming along? Any breakthroughs?”
Tony didn’t respond, only continued to stare silently again above.
intervention, I would think the universe just really had it out for May the 6th.”
, but you get my drift.” He’d already begun to exit the room before Steve could formulate a thought.

“...are you saying, they can suggest an idea, control their mind only in that way, but…”
He asks JARVIS for a different song he recalls hearing years ago, and at first the peppy tune brings some comedy to his disposition. Maybe making light of his experience will help.
There was no escalation, they just started kissing with a feverish desire - with open mouths, curious tongues, and presumptuous teeth.
“Webster’s dictionary defines ‘wedding’ as ‘the fusing of two metals with a hot torch…’” Steve started to look to Tony, confused at his response, before the brunet dismissed his statement. “Sorry, sorry, you won’t get that reference. But yeah, what I mean is, I’d like to see them try to take us apart.” His tone was fiery and convincing, but Steve still couldn’t catch Tony’s eyes.
_____________
Why do the good ones suffer? Why are they brought here, greatness thrust upon them, then to endure torture and cruelty and a lifetime of sorrow, only to be so untimely plucked from the earth?
“I don’t want that.” He pulled back to stare into Steve’s eyes, resolute in his statement. "Not just me."
“Just fine, Cap.”
“What’s today?” He asked innocently.
A little unsure of himself, Steve crept out of bed, drawing near to his boyfriend. As he reached a hand out in an attempt to settle him, a whimper escaped Tony’s lips.
“This doesn’t seem right,” Tony could hear him say over the sound of the engines almost as though he was hyper tuned into the alpha's voice. Damn, even the sound of his voice was pleasing.
Have a filler chapter for lack of me knowing how else to organize my thoughts at the moment. Sorrrrrrryyyyyyy. It's been far too long since I last updated. I get easily distracted if you couldn't tell, lol. Thank you all for your comments and support!
“Are you panicked?” Tony was asking as he was wheeled through the hall to meet a nurse from the call desk. “Because I am,” he continued. “I’m also ahhhhhghhhh!”
“Tony!?”
Morgan Louanne Rogers was placed on her mother’s chest and into the arms of her crying father, squealing and quivering, blue, white, and pink and all covered in gunk.
Tony rolled his head towards him and gave him the must unamused expression. “Can’t. I’m in incognito mode.”
Tony scoffed and crossed his arms across his chest. “What are they going to do? Repossess my baby if I don’t complete this? I keep hoping that she’ll  arrive before I have to take any more stupid classes.”
Tony felt rather proud of himself when Steve rolled forward on the chair and planted his elbows into his knees and dipped his face into his hands. Indeed, it was like he had won a small battle with his alpha when there was no war to begin with. His victorious pride only lasted him a moment, though, before he felt a little sorry for his alpha. Tony wiggled in his seat and nudged Steve with his thigh.
“Steve!”
“Good! It’s my life’s purpose to be an incessant pain in your ass as your omega.”
Ever the charmer, Tony was scooting close to Miss Pepper Potts high up in the stark towers after the success of making it a self-sustaining, fully functioning place of business. He was feeling haughty and even a little naughty as Pepper poured him a glass of champaign.
” Tony’s words seem to bring Steve pain.
“You gonna stay in my room tonight?”
“If they don’t like it, they can leave the tower.”
These are uncertain times. Take care of yourself. Best,
Tony’s furious. It’s all a game, he’s just a trophy, useless to all beyond the thrill of the hunt. “
Steve kisses Tony slow and deep, but Tony is desperately needy, and rolls his body against him. Kisses trail down his neck, and Tony groans. The small contact of their skin is overwhelming, a sensation he never dreamed he’d experience again, the memories of such intimacy he cherished immensely. The thought that he can have this now, he can have this again, he can have more is enough to flow through his whole body and fuel him endlessly.
He saved New York, ostensibly the world, but he just can’t quite shake the thought that no one is safe.
“Stark, you know that’s a one-way trip?” he tries.
, and he’s kissing him, and his arms are wrapping around him, and he’s starting to moan-
Tony listens, really listens, and looks deep into Steve’s eyes. He’s heard this before, and while it has a catchy beat, he’s never really taken the lyrics to be meaningful until now.
“Here,” he offered the glass of water. “Drink.”
Steve set the note by his bed, and hurriedly followed instructions. When he arrived at the highest level of the tower, JARVIS admitted him to a vacant workshop. Just when he was about to give up, he saw a door ajar. Timidly, with anticipation, Steve wandered outside into the rooftop, then curved around the backside of the glass-paneled structure. Sure enough, Tony was there, with two glasses of light-colored liquid. He accepted the glass from an outstretched hand and took a sip.
“Tell me what I feel like,” he dared, darkly, pressing, the betrayal surging him on.
The golden aura was beginning to fade, and in its wake the relenting rain pattered gently upon his head.
I apologize for my last letter. I was overcome with anger, and I’m sorry I shared my embittered emotions with you. Thank you for understanding.
He knew the solution was to try harder, and be better for Tony. He knew to assuage his temper and vanquish the numbness filling his soul would require work to change and fix what was broken within himself. Only then could he hold all of the shattered pieces that comprised Tony with such immeasurable strength that they might begin to fuse into a warm, lopsided mass, imperfectly created, but at least finally whole again. He knew that’s what Tony deserved.
“Tony! You’re soaking wet!”
“Hey, c’mon, I tried to talk to Tony. I
On the private rooftop garden of the tower, Rhodey officiated the intimate service.
That’s less of a joyous moan that he initially thought.
“I know, Steve. It’s bad, I know.” Crouched close, the redhead pressed her hands firmly to his shoulders.
Instinctively, he felt his hand reach out, and Tony recoiled.
“Could you turn it down at least?”
Despite whatever knowledge Strange attested that he was privy to, it didn’t take long for Earth to change, fast becoming a landscape unrecognizable. Friends were lost, family faded away, Avengers fell, and soon, existence was a bleak wasteland.
might.” Tony motioned for Steve to follow, and led him through the crowded room toward a vacant table in the corner, a sign with the word “reserved” displayed squarely in the middle. “Come on, let’s sit and you can tell me where exactly you ended up.”
A moment of relief washed over him, only to recede into gut wrenching anxiety. He didn’t want anyone to see him like this, not even Steve.
, in a dilapidated basement in an unknown alleyway of a nondescript European city.
“Yeah, when I asked if you’d arrived yet. But they kept sayin’ your name wrong. Spelled it wrong, too. With an ‘i.’ It was on the marquee. Are you certain you don’t know the place?” Steve sat with a loud clanking sound as they arrived at their table. “The bartender said when you perform it’s a drag, but I’m sure you’re great, Tony, whatever it is that you do!”
They lay there, panting heavily, for a few minutes before Steve could bring himself to lean back and slip out of Tony. He pushed out a harsh sigh as he zipped his pants back up and secured his belt, then crossed his legs loosely to sit on the unforgiving cement.
Steve couldn’t help but to immediately remove the tools from the genius’ hands and wrestle him to the ground. So, the ring would get done tomorrow. Tony always worked well under a deadline, anyway.
“I rather prefer to be loud and tied up than quiet and unrestrained.”
“Tony?” A careful voice called. “Hey, it’s me, it’s Steve.”
“They’re not our parents, Clint,
“How can I ever make you know how sorry I am?” Tony can see how broken Steve is, keeping this secret has clearly driven him mad. He’s unhinged, Tony can see that, too, but his heart is still the one he loves all these years later.
“What do I do? How do I fix this? How do I get him back?” His tone was biting as Steve’s watery eyes implored up at Natasha, but as quickly as he caught her focus, he averted his gaze again.
“...it wasn’t real.”
“Why did you not?”
Tony was so full of life. I still think of the nights we were together...I feel him on my skin and taste him in my mouth and hear his voice softly in my ear as if it happened yesterday. I always have, and I suspect I always will. He was so physical, but not in the way I had come to expect. He was expressive, and free, so free with me unlike his disingenuous, flirtatious, smart-ass persona he loved to flaunt. Most of all, on those nights when the whole world faded away and only we remained, Tony was sincere. I don’t know how I managed to lose what we had. I don’t know how someone bursting forth with energy and excitement and passion can just vanish from this world. It’s a paradox my mind can’t begin to comprehend. I feel myself slipping further and further into this unsolvable abyss.
Steve kept his eyes on Tony while the medical staff came to secure them with restraints dangling from the sides of their beds, but his subtle attempts to catch Tony’s attention failed miserably, as Tony only started determinedly at the ceiling.
It’s a quiet moment, tender, but the atmosphere is still tentative and thick. Steve clears his throat and speaks again.
?” Tony said, aghast.
“Nothing’s making us do this. Why do you keep saying that?” Tony stood, tone biting, and Steve started to wonder if Tony really believed in the fight against Fury’s insistence.
“It’s been years.
There was something so powerful about pressing down on Tony, completely naked, while he was completely clothed in industrial-strength protection. Tony was exposed, so willingly so, and Steve had the power to make him unravel, to destroy him, all without removing a stitch of his armor. The rough edges of his suit would leave impressions and marks against Tony’s olive skin. Sometimes, the friction of worn fabric would scratch the brunette, making his skin tender or raw. Steve could be careful, hold him down to minimize the abrasions, or he could lean in, embrace it, and leave his mark in more ways than one. The latter was always more enticing.
“No, Steve.
I’m sorry, Sam. These are the only thoughts I have now. I should have done more. I owed him more.
Tony feigned a mild resistance to Steve’s firm grasp, and Steve couldn’t take this coy game any more. Wrapping an arm around the brunette’s waist, Steve pulled him close, and kissed deeply, tongue dancing along familiar territory. Tony sighed a contented response, subtly grinding his hips against Steve. Even through the thick material, Steve could feel Tony’s excitement. At this rate, Tony wasn’t going to last long - and neither was Steve.
he assured himself.
“Show me,” Tony taunted, a sultry smile gracing his flushed face.
“You weren’t stupid. No...you just got stuck with me.” He was sorry, so sorry, sweet Tony was subjected to an existence that bound them together. Being soulmates could mean anything, and Steve couldn’t fathom why Tony would relegate himself to such a life. “I didn’t know. I really didn’t. You were drunk, and I didn’t think you knew, didn’t think it would mean anything to you, even if you did. I never- I never realized all of those things happened on the same date.” He spoke softly, fearful of a tone that could scare away the man before him.
“Always with a plan, aren’t you?”
Despite the confusion swirling in his mind, he knows what he saw compels him to do more.
” Tony added sarcastically.
And now, months after Steve attacked, weeks after Steve took, a day after Steve had snapped and yelled and dismissed, hours after Tony filled him with incandescence and yearning and awe, Steve was inconvenienced once again by Tony’s affections.
私の心をゆさぶるあなた
“No,” he growls.
Finally, Steve speaks first.
Steve knew he would need to fill Tony’s mind with light, and chase away any lingering shadows cast from the mountains of trauma born of the work they did. Tony would need it constantly to help heal his mind of all they witness, day in and day out. He knew he would always be able to find the words Tony needed to hear to render his mind whole again. He would say them over and over until Tony believed it as if the words were born in his own mind. Forever. He would do this forever.
“Don’t apologize, it’s ok.”
Dear Sam,
“I-” Steve’s voice falters, and to Tony’s utter surprise, he stutters a bit before continuing on to answer the question Tony posed. “I wanted to thank you. You were really impressive out there,” Steve’s voice is as stiff as his posture now, Tony observes as his vision starts to focus again. “I- I mean, I was impressed. I mean, I didn’t know the suit could do that, that you made something that could fly. Well, I knew it could
"I’m taking you as my prisoner,” he growls.
Tony grumbled and with a nod indicating his consent, Steve picked him up and carried him to bed. He gave Tony a soft kiss good night, then retreated a few feet to pull out the sofa and reveal a mattress. After relieving himself of his unneeded clothing, he climbed into his temporary bed and drifted to sleep with ease.
“Are you questioning our relationship, at our own
“Steve…” Tony can’t take it, all that Steve has suffered, all he has lost and sacrificed. He’s been a victim, he sees it now, and while he knows he’s been hurt by these lies as well, he knows his pain is not unique. “Why maintain the lie, then, when you rescued me?”
“I...don’t-”
“But I don’t know that I really believed myself when I said it. I just...kept saying it and saying it, when shit was too hard, when I didn’t think we could come back from it, and I guess somehow I believed our time would expire, we’d be done, and I could live out my days telling myself there was time to fix it with you, even if it was a lie.” He paused, allowing for a protest, but none came, so he forced himself to finish what he had started. “I wouldn’t have to own up to what I’d done to you, or acknowledge the unchangeable fact of you being stuck with me as your soulmate when you inevitably left me. But you never left.”
Intrepid hands greedily roamed across exposed skin, grabbing and caressing with enthusiasm, until Steve felt like he might burst from the foreplay alone. He shifted to his side, and Tony slotted his pelvis to meet Steve’s in an impossible interlocking of legs and hips.
“It was mind control. It didn’t mean anything.” The brunet’s tone was firm, logical.
“Uh, what’s that?”
“I don’t?” Came the insincere reply.
“A pirate bar.” Steve said it as if it were obvious, which Tony supposed it was. “Otto’s, I believe. You don’t know it?”
“Not a one.”
“You seem uncomfortable.” Steve observed.
They talked briefly, devised a simple plan, and Steve took Bucky into hiding.

They sat silently, holding each other in bed for a long while. Steve listened to Tony’s breathing slowly return to a steady and even pace. He could feel his heart beating in his chest, and also noticed it gradually returning to a stable rate. This was so comforting, even nourishing, feeling such a warm, easy embrace. He was still settling into his new place, despite it being months old by now, and adjusting to this new era was also taking a great deal of time. But the feeling of Tony wrapped around him, his handsome face resting comfortably upon his chest - this was the closest he’d ever felt in his whole life to being home.
“Yes, dear?”
Please don’t die thinking I hate you, Steve thinks.
I tried, but I wasn’t good enough for him. He never felt for me the way I felt for him.
Slow hands began to trace the edges of his weathered uniform, deftly searching for the clasp. Steve seized Tony's wrist with a rough hand, holding him still. A thin smile pressed against his lips, and Steve couldn’t help his lips from curling into an equally mischievous smirk.
“What the hell’s he doing?” He didn’t need to ask, as he already knew the sacrifice Tony intended on making. Steve’s heart stopped, and he couldn’t breathe. His body was numb, it felt like he was slowly being overcome by the ice and frost again, just before he fell asleep -
“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
,” he breathed, completely overcome.
“I think I have an idea of something novel.”
Steve pushed through the heavy metal doors leading to the helipad atop Avengers tower. The chill of wind shot through him, sobering him to the moment. What had he come up here to do? The looming shadow of the honest answer churned his stomach to sickness.
With every defensible resource depleted in their substantial efforts, the onslaught of attacks following Thanos was enough to cripple the world. It wasn’t until fellow Avengers began to slowly fall that it was clear - their time had expired. The future had arrived, and it was a shock.
Steve felt something icy slip into his veins from the crook of his inner arm. He felt it slowly travel along his arm, then cool began to radiate throughout his body, slowly spreading to fill his extremities and his core. He allowed his right arm to roll outwards, whispered Tony’s name, and felt fingers brush against the back of his hand. Awkward from the restraints, the men interlaced fingers. Steve could see Tony’s eyes grow heavy and his body grow limp as the effects of the sedative took hold. The unsurprising realization came slowly, but he knew he wasn’t falling asleep, and knew he wouldn’t. He never had to be subjected to anesthesia for surgery, but it wasn’t unexpected that due to the serum, it might be an impossibility for him to respond to the medicine as one would expect. Steve steadied himself for what was to come, and before he realized he wasn’t ready, a burning sensation tore through his body. It was a violent, uncontrollably reflex, and he felt his body curl up and flex burst inversely. A wave rolled through him, and never stopped. Looking to Tony, he could see the brunet shaking and convulsing. It was disturbing, unnatural, Tony’s body fighting the restraints, eyes closed, incoherent, no knowledge of what was happening. Pain spiked again, Steve was distracted from Tony, he clenched his right hand hard, and was almost distracted from the pain when a hand squeezed his in return. What were they doing? Why were they doing this? What were they about to lose?
It’s incessant, the music, and despite the crisp clarity of the singer's vocals, many of the words are rattled off so quickly they start to mindlessly fade into the background as Steve focuses on the Chitauri. But he’s lying if he doesn’t admit it’s a bit fun too.
Tony lurched violently in the bed, and Steve reached his other arm out to console him. Tony lurched again, this time jolting into Steve’s chest.
A pirate.
“You have nightmares frequently?”
Steve replied.
Steve jumped suddenly. There was a soft tune humming in his ears, almost impossible to decipher. “Do you hear that?”
Guitar - a strumming, lively pace - and a talk-singing voice fill his ears.
“You keep asking your AI to increase the temperature.”
Nightmares of the Chitauri flooded his mind. Now awake, he tries to ignore the residual memory, but it doesn’t work - he’s still shaky and feeling slightly tormented.
“Who?”
Steve was learning Tony. He hadn’t seen the events up close, but he couldn’t ignore the telltale signs and unrelenting ripples that existed in the wake of trauma. ‘Battle shock,’ they had called it during the war. Most looked unfavorably upon soldiers who exhibited the symptoms. But Steve was different, and he tried to show compassion, even if he wasn’t perfect every time.
Tony tried calling Steve, but the line only rang until he reached the voicemail.
“Being your prisoner hardly sounds like a rescue.”
As soon as he does, he’s swiftly hurled to the ground.
Coming down from the high, Tony was overwhelmed by lingering kisses, until he felt himself drift to sleep in Steve’s safe arms. Maybe he would forget the evils of the world by morning. Steve made it so easy to believe that he could.
“How did they say it? My name, at the bar.”
“I believed you dead.”
he mused, thumbing along the curved edge where vibranium met flesh.
But Steve knew he had to slip out of the covers and climb out of the bed lest he risk more dire consequences. He rolled to his side, placed a hand on a bare chest, and gently jostled. “
It’s times like these that Tony misses Steve the most.
“That’s completely different!”
Dear Sam,
“How so?” His question has bite.
“Better?”
Is this what facing near-death does to a person? Confuses mortality for love?
Fic title is a lyric from Diamonds by Rihanna.
“The other pirates,” Steve said with a deprecating wince. “Awful kind fellows. But very adamant about the getup. Am I going to be asked to leave?” Steve looked around the room at the gawking patrons.
“I’d put my money on that it would be you.” Instinctually, he rested his hand on Tony’s, and gave a squeeze. He felt his heart leap at the realization of their intimacy, and a dangerous thought suddenly overcame him that he might never want to let go. “If I’m honest, there’s something I worry about more.”
Bruce followed the blunt instruction and returned with his supplies. He placed an IV for Steve first, and then repeated for Tony. “Alright, first, you’ll be sedated and will go to sleep. Then, we’ll introduce the toxin. You’ll wake up in less than an hour and be able to recover here in about that much time. So, uh, see you soon, boys.”
“Relax, sweetheart,” he coached. “That’s it, you’re perfect, you’re doing so good.” Tony was shaking, and Steve finally took his twitching cock in hand. “
I regret all that I’ve done. He didn’t deserve this end. I keep thinking about it, about the shock, the fear, the loneliness he must have endured at the end. Pain so formidable even the great Tony Stark couldn’t survive. Tony, a man with a silver tongue, breath forced from his body as his lungs were crushed and he was beaten to a pulp. In the end, even his words couldn’t save him. He had so much to live for, and it was stolen from him.
“I’m so sorry, really, I am-”
“Everyone has a story of a really specific thing you have to do with your soulmate to awaken the bond.”
better. Regrets?” Tony asked sarcastically.
Steve was unconcerned with unfamiliar sounds growing more clear, as if something hostile was advancing on them from a far away distance.
“Ok, so, you’re first going to get a light sedative intravenously, then, we’ll introduce the, uh, the toxin.”
He’s going to put the proverbial bird in the water.
After all, just the thought of him pulled him back to Earth, against all impossible odds.
awakened their soulbonds. Many couples swore they were soulmates - there was an undeniable magnetism, and they were sure of it, but they were unable to create the glowing phenomena that occurred when a soulbond awakens.
. We’ll have our wedding. No matter what they do to us, they’ll never take us apart.”
“Let him in, J,” Tony rasps, trying to steady himself.
Tony manages back to the penthouse on his own. He doesn’t want to think about cleaning up, seeing Loki off. There’s time, though, before the departure should take place, and now free from the suit, he asks JARVIS for some music.
“All this anger and regret,” Tony says carefully, “is what drove you to such malevolence?”
Tony chuckled as it dawned on him. Now, it made sense. “Drag. As in drag queen, or king. Not
Nomad doesn’t respond, and jerks his vise-like grip on his arm to compel Tony to restart a swift stride. The march is growing treacherous as the forest is thinning and slippery sheets of rock are exposed from the earth. They ascend a mountain, and now Tony is struggling to maintain pace with his superhuman captor. Nomad doesn’t slow, and continues to pull him along no matter how awkwardly Tony stumbles.
“Up.” Nomad commands, in the same tone that his former teammate used to employ. For a moment his mind fools him into thinking it’s Captain America speaking to him, just like he used to do mere months ago. “Will you walk? Or shall I continue to carry you?” The twisted expression returns, and Tony thinks he might break.
His skin runs cold and a lump forms in his throat. Swallowing it won’t be easy.
“Team what?”
But this is something he’s willing to fall backwards into, blindly, and out-of-his-mind delirious over.
“No, it’s just us tonight. I don’t need him all the time. Though, it sounds like
Love of his life. Alive before his very eyes.
?” His eyes were gleaming, tears welling up. “What the hell do you mean? It’s our...it’s our
Tony headed back to the bar, ambiguously waved his fingers in a subtle gesture that procured two more glasses of club soda. He sipped the effervescence from one glass pensively, still wondering if he shouldn’t have just changed into the suit and taken off toward East 14th street to get to the bottom of this whole thing. Sure, it would risk having to cancel his evening with Steve, conjure excuses to explain Iron Man’s presence and Tony’s abrupt absence, but he thought it might be better to be sure Steve really didn’t need backup, or he’d be risking not having a Steve to enjoy an evening with at all.
Goddamnit.
There always existed an unspoken challenge between them in the beginning, while they both waited to see who would succumb and make the first move. It was a challenge Steve primarily failed.
“Ok, but it’s kind of an important date, Steve. I mean, even without reliable electronic calendars, you must’ve known it was the sixth of May.”
Cars screeched to a stop, drivers honking wildly to express their disapproval. Steve tried to offer an apologetic wave, but the cars continued along their way once the two made it to the slim, center median.
Tony could take a chance. He had to.
“Fury, how nice of you to join us-”
One day, I’ll see you again. Until that day, I’ll keep writing you.
“Don’t worry, I added some stuff to this playlist that you’ll recognize, too, if you’ve been listening to the radio this century.”
“Let me show you.” Steve drew near enough to feel Tony’s bated breath against his skin. He reclaimed the glass, deliberately allowing their fingers to brush. Tony’s breath hitched, and it wasn’t without difficulty that Steve suppressed a smile.
“I know.”
I was once a man of hope, trusting if I gave him what he needed, he would change his mind, and I could tell him my secret.
.” He couldn’t help himself. Anything that came to mind poured from his soul before he knew what he was saying. “Oh, Tony, you take it so well. You’re too good to me.” He buried his face into Tony’s neck. Tony was tensing up, grinding hard against his movements, resisting as best as he could. Steve felt him unraveling fast, and if he was going to say all that he wanted Tony to hear, he would have to be quick.
The words are peppy but the dark edge hits Steve as he realizes he’s fighting for his life, and the lives of all of New York. He can’t seem to escape threats to the security of the city or the state, no matter the decade.
“So, you’re Howard’s son?” Tony nodded in response to the question, concealing the sharp twinge in his heart. “But he already passed.”
he thinks, vision hazy, and head swimming in an impossible vortex. He’s trying to look around, but despite the pathetically sheer blindfold that covers his eyes, it’s still difficult to see anything in what he thinks is a dark, barren room. There are no smells he recognizes, and no sound either. It’s quiet.
There are footsteps, heavy and fast, headed right toward him. He thinks he sees dark boots before he feels himself be man-handled off the ground and thrown over the shoulder of his newest abductor.
“I’m sorry, Steve. But you do understand why this is so important, don’t you?” Something tugged at Steve’s brain, the genuine attempt the Widow was making to be gentle with her merciless request was not lost on the captain. As quickly as he was distracted by the fleeting warmth, his mind fell to the perfect circle embracing his third digit.
how it works! It’s not real.”
Why was no one there to protect him? Where were the SHIELD bodyguards? Are they being questioned, interrogated? An act so cowardly deserves punishment. Foster can’t even begin to comprehend what he’s done. He’s lost more than his uncle, he’s lost the greatest protector Earth has ever known, and he's brought weakness upon us all. We are all to suffer because of one small-minded man who couldn’t control his rage.
“Because if you’re quiet, I shall untie you.”
“Wow,” Tony yawned. “You sure know how to give a guy a good night’s sleep.”
“It’s a false memory, Steve. That’s all it is. A manipulation. The doing of aliens. It’s not organic. And it’s not real.”
“Precisely. The world will be so envious of you and me, and we will have the one thing most coveted by all the world.”
“No way I can top that. What poor person is out there eating increasingly spicier foods while naked with each of their partners?”
“Tony...what do we do?”
It was soft and sweet, tender and kind. Why couldn’t he return, find his way back, be with him in that place again? Where was it buried? Where did he find it, the shared fragile intimacy they enjoyed? He knew it was there, it existed somewhere, it couldn’t have been buried, stifled, smothered. It couldn’t have been an illusion. Why couldn’t he just find it again?
“I did.”
A scream started forming in the back of his throat, he couldn’t release it, he didn’t want to, he fought it with every shaky fiber of his being, pain mounting and building and consuming him and -
His room was dark and cold, and felt emptier than anything he’d ever experienced before. A stifling weight set heavy on his chest as he surveyed the room that felt so foreign, he was almost sure it couldn’t be his.
“Our second date?” Tony echoed impassively.
“Do you think they’ll have to get a divorce?”
“You didn’t have to come.”
“You have all that I need...and, I have a great deal to gain by keeping you captive, all to myself, you know.” He speaks salaciously with a thrilling edge of darkness Tony didn’t think possible for Steve to possess. “I’ll tuck you away, keep you safe, in the highest tower of my castle, and no one will ever get to you,”
“I don’t understand,” Tony finally murmured.
I feel I only exist in my mind. I have no corporeal mass tying me to this world.
I’ve just received the news I'm sure you already know. I can’t bring myself to even write it in this letter. None of this feels real, I don’t know why I’m even writing you. Sam, I spend my days alone in my cell. I can’t accept visitors, and now the guards are telling me I can’t expect that to change for the duration of my sentence. Which is fine, really, the only visitor I had hoped to see was him…

Dear Sam,
The pair shared a laugh as Steve removed the hat sheepishly.
Tony was born from total destruction. A self-proclaimed hot mess, Tony muses that there is so much more work for him to do. There will be more to come. He’s seen as much. He’s got to do something.
“We never said anything official. I didn’t...I didn’t know what we were doing.”
Steve knew Tony hadn’t remembered anything from that night. Things fell back to normal. Tony still avoided him frequently, and they argued when he didn’t. Battle after battle, argument after argument, they continued to survive, but each time grew a little less stable, a little nearer to failure.
Then he realizes it’s Tony and-
He lingered a moment, searching Tony’s eyes before turning to put the glass down on a nearby table.
He’s still trying to get his bearings, process what the
“You’re too late, Nomad,” he says with a mirthless laugh, and before he can stop himself, his heart spills it's thoughts carelessly. “Three years too late. A different time, perhaps, I might have even considered a casual tryst. I’ll admit there is allure to your present rogue aesthetic. But now, there’s no hope for me. I fell in love. Deeply. He was true...and he’s dead. The wounds remaining on my heart will never heal. Even to save my life I couldn’t pretend to marry you. So, tell me, what other choice is there?”
“Oh, shit, I’m sorry,” he mumbled, avoiding Steve’s eyes.
In reciprocal thrusts and shared moans, they both found release under cover of the plush blanket atop their bodies. In those fleeting moments, nothing beyond he and Steve existed.
Steve looked around. They were in a rooftop garden, and for it being the center of New York, it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful. The sun shone warmly across crisp blue skies, views of the beautiful city sharp and clear. “This is amazing, Tony. I didn’t know you had a garden up here.”
He felt movement - Tony had begun to roll his hips in an salacious manner, wrapping his legs firmly around an unencumbered waist.
” he whispered, albeit gruffly, in Tony’s ear. He implored a few more requests before Tony sleepily grunted and sat up, zombie-like, to afford Steve the space to climb out from behind him.
“I suppose if we do go there, I’ll be risking wearing the same outfit for our second date. I hope you won’t mind.” Steve said it so pointedly, so pragmatically, Tony wasn’t entirely sure he’d heard him correctly.
All thought and reason left his conscious mind. He dipped his head and claimed Tony’s lips with his own. Steve kissed him deeply, filled with a desperation he didn’t know he had been living with. From Tony’s eagerness, he distantly wondered if he really felt the same. Tender movements became mirrored, and soon, the feeling of Tony’s lips was not enough. He ran his hands through soft, wet locks of hair, holding Tony’s head securely with an unspoken prayer to never let this end. The water ran down his face as their kisses grew deeper, open-mouthed, and increasingly slippery. It wasn’t until now, this moment, that he realized how profoundly he wished for this to be true. If they ever stopped, he’d know, he’d have his answer, and what if the answer wasn’t what he wished for?
was starting to feel like a whisper from the man on his shoulder, only he couldn’t tell which side was speaking.
Nomad grows quiet for a moment before responding. “Is that what you’ve heard about me, then? And what do you think of it?”
“Flattery’s gonna get you nowhere, Cap,” he bit out.
Something bright flashed, catching his attention even through his closed eyes. Steve pulled away, leaving only enough room for breath and flowing water to fill the space between where their lips had parted. Upon opening his eyes, through drops of rain, he saw an impossible golden glow surrounding them.
“Of losing you.”
“Mr. Stark. Uh, I mean,
I apologize for the delay. I did receive your last few letters. They bring me a comfort more than you could realize.
But, he did love me.
“I won’t.”
“This isn’t how it’s supposed to be!” Strange barked to no one identifiable. “These attacks are decades away! This is all wrong!”
Steve stalled for a moment. Of course this was his hope, and his intention. But hearing the words spoken aloud overcame him with an ineffable wonder.
He sobbed with his whole body into the small hours of the morning, for once wishing to forget so completely that the pain could fade away, too.
“...I was happy too.” Tony almost immediately interrupted, brown eyes now burning into Steve’s with an unmatched intensity.
We are all complicit in this. We are all to blame for not protecting him. We are worse for this. I’ll forever fight anyone who says otherwise.
“I like it.” Tony was still studying him with an easy expression on his face.
We’ll have
“And step two?”
His pants were growing uncomfortably tight, a distraction he would have to acknowledge soon. He kept scissoring rhythmically, impressed by how relaxed Tony’s muscles were becoming.
“Why don’t you just sleep at my place?” Steve offered one afternoon, without much thought. “You’ve given me more than enough space, and the sofa folds out into an extra bed, which I’ve been looking for an excuse to test out. C’mon, you can have the bed, and would be doing me a favor.”
Steve leaned in, doused in kerosene, and let the flame catch.
“Clint, calm down. Let’s take it one step at a time. Step one - let’s start talking to them.”
“The SHIELD was plotting the return of the mantle, unbeknownst to me. But the world was under attack so suddenly, and before I knew of it, they said to you I was killed…” Tears start to well in his eyes, and all the anger Tony was holding melts instantly. Steve is a victim, just like him. “They spun you their web of lies before I was informed. Beat me to it, to ensure their lie would remain. When we fought alongside each other all those years, I wanted to divulge the truth with every fiber of my soul. But when you appeared content, on the surface, I witnessed your capacity to manage, and I thought I would be so selfish to take your life away from you. I believed that the lie was better for you, better for me, better for all.” Steve tilts his head back and closes his eyes. Tears run down his face, mixing with the remaining dried blood to turn to long, crimson streaks. “It was a mistake. I regretted it every day, even if I thought you were better off. I could never let you go.”
“Well, you see,” he sighed, “once I’ve had one and woken up, I really can’t get back to sleep. I should probably get to the workshop, let you get some sleep now that you’re in your own bed. It’s better if I distract myself with something novel.”
Been there. Done that. This song is speaking directly to him.
“...he sent me pictures. Of when he used to…And Happy told me SI was attacked by his machines, they were looking for me, and I think I ran, and…” Tony was still trying to piece it all together, it was coming back in bits and pieces, but his mind was still hazy, and he was so confused.
I would give up the bond, though, if it would bring him back.
“Tony, hey, it’s me, Steve, I’m here, you’re safe-” he tried again to settle Tony, allowing his affirmations to grow louder and louder in hopes that he would be heard. Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s torso, and suddenly he was being pulled into bed.
_____________
“How could it mean anything if I didn’t have a say in it?” Tony snapped in response.
And that’s all it took for Steve to know what to do.
“I’m pretty sure it was a generational tale. I never met anyone who said that really happens.”
This is the end - right?
A ship crashes out of the sky, plumes of smoke billowing into the air.
“I don’t see Iron Man,” his voice trailed off as he glanced over Tony’s shoulders.
“Source of what?” Steve couldn’t suppress the worry bubbling inside of his stomach.
For the rest of the afternoon, he busied himself with cleaning and setting up his place, though he knew there would be no level of cleanliness nor amount of décor that could affect how the events of the evening would proceed.
just happened-
Before he can think to answer the question, his ears are overwhelmed by the sounds of explosives. He lurches from where he’s sitting, which he now realizes is the floor, but he’s bound at the ankles and wrists so he can’t move very effectively. Instead of jumping to his feet as intended, he falls pathetically on his side. The ground is vibrating from detonations, and he thinks he hears a shout or two, but nothing more. The sounds are growing closer, rapidly, and while he debates whether to brace for impact or to pray to a higher being instead, a massive explosion hits the wall.
He sees Iron Man take off into the distance. Steve is still fighting off the onslaught, slow on the uptake, when he realizes what’s happening.
“Now who in their right mind would ask a pirate as handsome as yourself to do anything against his own prerogative? Especially with that menacing blade.” He jostled the plastic hilt teasingly. “They’d have to be crazy!”
“Alright, so Dr. Banner seems to have found the originating source.” Fury’s announcement startled the pair as he suddenly burst into the snow-white triage room.
The agent smiled. “Why don’t you schedule time to meet Tony Stark?”
“Shit, Steve…” Tony was coming undone, fast, and if he was going to make good on his promise, he would have to act fast. Without warning, Steve grabbed at the hem of Tony’s sweatshirt, pulling it up and over his head quickly, then shoving it between Tony’s bare skin and the cold concrete. The man didn’t resist, he allowed it to happen to him, running his hands along Steve’s bulky gear in approval. With expert movement, Steve stripped away Tony’s jeans and boxers and shoes in one swift movement. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t done this hundreds of times before - at this point, it would be more difficult to pretend he wasn’t adept at stripping Tony Stark completely naked in a matter of seconds.
Tony doesn’t hold back, and uses his body to inspire greater romance in Steve’s heart. He traces along the edges of where Steve’s armor meets his skin, and Steve responds by removing it skillfully, barely interrupting their escalating kisses. He feels Steve’s presumptuous hands roam under his shirt’s hem, exploring his chest reverently, until he demands its removal, as well as his pants soon after.
much more, was a prize to be won to be sure. It only made sense that opportunistic vultures would try to take advantage of Steve, so it was easy to jump to such a conclusion when things seemed amiss. While he knew the Captain could take care of himself, his outdated naivete was a vulnerability that leaches of this century still knew how to exploit - a truth that made Tony bristle at the mere thought.
Steve. He met Steve Rogers. Fought with him, spent days in his company. There is so much more for Tony just on the other side of that wormhole. And not even now, staring down death, can Tony accept the unlikely chance that he will see Steve again.
“But seriously, Steve, I think I can help you, if you’ll allow me the chance to try. I’d really like the chance to try.”
“Tony, just,
Steve smiled. “One can dream.”
“Maybe a different genre, next?” he sighs. As much as he's beginning to enjoy how Tony challenges him, this is possibly a little too much of an immersion in the future for Steve right now.
He rolled over in the icy bed - a fading scent enticed him, both familiar and unknown at the same time. It started to drive him mad, as if the origin was something he should know, and yet he had no explanation for how it got there.
Those words had called out to him when he first heard them. He read SHIELD’s files, he knew Howard Stark's son was Tony, and Tony was Iron Man. Since learning about Tony, he’d wondered what a flying man would look like against a clear sky. And now, he's fighting alongside him, and gets to see this miracle first hand.
Tony nodded, but Steve answered for him anyway. “I’ll always protect you. I’m yours. Forever and always.”
“I don’t think this is really going to work,” Tony mused, pressing his fingertips to his mouth to conceal the involuntary smile that pulled at his lips.
Steve is the only one who can set him right.
“But, you’re not grateful, are you? You don’t have to lie. If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine. But you don’t have to hide it from me.”
Steve gave a half-hearted eye roll, contemplating his assured tardiness, then immediately chastised himself for his reaction. Tony was exhausted, alone in their shared bed, and asking only for a brief acknowledgement before he was to leave him for at least the next 20 hours, if not longer. Tony was kind and patient, and open, so open for him. He followed Steve across foreign continents, undoubtedly risking his own world to do so.
Something foreign settled in his gut, replacing his vexation over the delay.
Please be mindful if you do listen to the full content of the playlist, there are some songs containing lyrics with adult content, and swearing, if that’s a sensitive spot for you.
hot, but Steve, babe,
“I love you,” he breathed into Tony's ear as he came.
“Alright. Today then.”
“No, never kissed anyone in the rain.” He glanced at Tony but was unable to read his reaction.
_____________
It hadn’t occurred to Steve when he extended the invitation to Tony that this would be the first time they spent the night together. In his time, it might be a bit unconventional to stay the night with the person you were going steady with, but it wasn’t entirely unheard of. In a manner of speaking, he and Tony were technically living together - they shared an address, after all, even if they kept separate apartments. But in this new world, spending the night together might not match his understanding of a ‘good ol’ fashioned slumber party.’
“If that’s how you see it.”
Steve abruptly snapped his hips, sinking his body completely flush against Tony, not a hint of his cock exposed, every inch of it concealed within the brunette. Tony sobbed with the sudden change of pace, and Steve started rocking into him, deeper and deeper.
Which is why when he finally entered Stark Tower and laid eyes on the beautiful brunette, it took almost a minute for his reeling brain to catch up with his body experiencing desperate kisses and a rapturous embrace. He finally registered the affection and reciprocated, accepting,
“Hmm...it’s sweet. Good. What is it?”
“...I don’t want to.”
“You’d do well to get some rest,” he interrupted.
“I watched you.” If Steve was going to do this, he had to go for it. No more hesitation, no doubts or second-guesses. He knew what these words did to Tony, and he knew what he wanted to give to him. Now, it was out of his hands. Tony would have to decide whether or not to allow himself to fall through the wormhole and afford Steve the chance to prove himself.
-!” he tries to shout in between strides, but he receives no response. He realizes they are outside now, because he can smell damp earth, and the air is no longer musty. Even in a compromised position, it’s already gotten a bit easier to breathe, so he tries to shout again.
The process was gradual. He gave Tony the occasional, small compliment, the kind that was believable and honest, about anything other than their work together. Of course, he gave praise when Tony made a good call on the battlefield, but he was careful to keep that sort of talk specific and detailed and reserved for debrief meetings at first. He built the other sorts of compliments slowly, steadily, and deliberately. When Tony began to bristle less and ramble more after these sorts of exchanges, Steve knew he was making progress, earning credibility. He allowed the praise to come more freely, less premeditatedly, and it seemed to be working a bit, but only that - a bit.
“I heard those agents talking. They said there was no way you could have known about me yet. Why am I
“Or maybe it’s the reason why you will.”
taste? The man who still wears his Captain America fatigues questions my sense of aesthetics?” His eyes were a bit brighter now, eager, challenging Steve to take the bait.
He squeezed the brunette close and pressed a long kiss to his head, breathing in the familiar smell of Tony Stark. He summoned every molecule of courage remaining in his being and decided what he would dedicate himself to from that moment on. He wouldn’t forget this anniversary, not this time.
With a cry, Tony came, shuddering violently against Steve. He held him through it, but the sensation was overwhelming, and Steve felt his own release possess him quickly.
Steve hesitated again, searching Tony’s face desperately for something, something he couldn’t name. “...So what’s the problem?”
Tony fisted Steve’s shirt to give him a firm shake. “Kiss me.”
“Oh, god,
“Is that-
,” he whispered into Tony’s skin.
Steve flinched at Bruce’s confidence, how could he be so sure about the alien tech controlling their decisions? “And, our memories…?”
“Yes, I am confident this will disable what they embedded in you.”
“Midgardian music is so amusing!”
“Uh, sorry Tony, but yeah. You’ll be sedated in a moment, but I expect you to experience some involuntary convulsions while the toxin runs its course.”
It feels wrong, none of this feels right. Something deep within me tells me it should be me in his place, I should have died for these choices. I would give anything to take his place.
_____________
Steve knew Bruce’s statement was said with his deepest intention to be kind, but the reality of what they were risking settled in his body like lead, heavy and metallic, foreign and unwanted. He didn’t have time to process it before Tony asserted impatiently, “If we’re doing this, let’s do it. Now.”
Steve.
“It’s no trouble, honestly, Tony. I have nightmares, too, and it’s a lonely feeling.”
“I don’t know.”
Sweat.
“Lemon drop?” He plopped himself into an oversized chair and offered Steve a candy from a tin.
Sweat. Yes. Definitely sweat. In his suit. He’s not in bed, he’s on the floor - ground - sidewalk? Whatever.
“I didn’t ever think to try.”
“How did you know I wasn’t safe?” Steve looked up to him now, bright blue eyes imploring for more.
“So, what’s the wildest story you’ve heard about how to awaken the soulbond?”
“I feel drawn to you, Steve, in a way I can’t explain. Tell me you haven’t thought about it before.”
“You ever try it?” Tony asked, glancing up at Steve. His indifferent tone sounded insincere.
Apprehensively, Tony accepted the drink as their ritual dictated he would. With closed eyes, he took six long sips.
Tony takes a hand from Steve’s hold and wipes away the tears before he’s leaning forward and pressing feather-light kisses to Steve’s cheeks, to his forehead, to his chin, his neck, everywhere he can reach. “I never stopped loving you, Tony,” he feels Steve whisper against his lips.
_____________
“What?”
He wrote that he trusted me, and I believe him.
Steve can’t take his eyes away from the heavens. He feels like his heart is being crushed in an icy vice as Natasha follows his order and the hole in the sky shrinks, and disappears.
“Scared of what?” The shout came not as a question.
“It is curious, though, a curious manifestation of the Chitauri’s strategy.”
Feeling his lover inside of him breathes life into the corners of his heart that he believed to have died alongside Steve. Now he knows the doors were simply closed, and he was waiting for Steve to expose them to the light once again. Skin against skin, sharing one breath, intimately joined as one, Tony feels the space between his shattered pieces disappear as the shards forge together. There's no room for emptiness. He is whole again.
I’m still waiting on this letter he promised. I’m starting to suspect another broken promise so perfectly characteristic of Stark.
Now, he was learning.
“It depends on how you see it.” Nomad tilts his head to the side and gives a wry smile, if you can even call it that.
Steve tumbled over the edge, overcome with ecstasy filling his every cell with joy. Tony followed seamlessly, emitting an absolutely criminal moan as he ground against Steve, trapping his hand between them to chase his release.
The weight of the ring was nearly imperceptible when it sat in his palm. It’s mate had been destroyed, it was the last of its kind. Forged as a symbol of unending love, created in tandem, it was now all that remained. Steve couldn’t resist any longer, he knew its time had come to return to the crucible from which it was born. The resolution nearing now felt more like a manipulation than anything else he was being told about what the Chitauri did to them, about how the piece of jewelry originated. Once dismantled, there would be no evidence of what he once had with Tony. They kept telling him, “things will go back to normal.” But Steve didn’t know where normal began, or how far back he’d have to go for them to say he’d found it.
,” Steve chides, and he goes silent willingly. “You’re amazing.”
Then, he started seeing. He saw how Tony flaunted himself, dripping with words of self-praise. But when someone else complimented him, Steve saw Tony’s face. He didn’t react, no, not with his face. It was unwavering, as if he was listening to someone tell him different names for shades of taupe. But his eyes - his eyes responded. His eyelids would flutter without ever fully closing, and his pupils would dilate, expanding until his iris was nearly drowned in black.
Tony moves to capture Steve’s eyes glimmering in the moonlight. “Unless you allow them to do so?”
I don’t see a way out. I only see darkness for myself and for our world. It’s up to you now to carry the burden I can no longer bear. I’m so sorry to leave it to you, but I know it’s you who can make sense of this, carry on the fight, lead the defense for our world. I know SHIELD will support you in this too.
“The fact that I went into the ice, missed out on my own time. I’m sure that’s the reason why I won’t find my soulmate.”
“Well, then, there you have it. I’m sure others would disagree with you, but you see it how you will.”
“Better!” He grunts, taking down more Chitauri. “This music helping anyone else’s strategy?” Steve asks no one in particular.
He felt some of Steve’s tension ease. Tony was slowly building trust. But then he felt the sadness return, and it blindsided him.
“If I could,” Steve reaches a hand out, then stills, and Tony has no idea what he might be trying to do, “might I return the favor?”
“I wasn’t drunk.” Tony’s gaze was burning into Steve now. “I was drinking. Not drunk. Actually, it was the last time I ever…” his voice trailed off, eyes now lost in something far away. “Even so, why wouldn’t you talk to me about it later? Not even when you moved in two years ago?”
“I was able to create an inlay for a piece of my reactor. I told you I was putting my heart into this for you.” Tony was smiling smugly now, obviously pleased with himself. “It’s actually part of an identical pair…” He reached into his pocket to reveal a second, slightly smaller but matching ring.
“You’ve talked to Rhodey about this?” It was still a surprise to Steve how easily people talked about it now. In his time, it was considered a mark of poor moral character to talk about such topics.
With a needy desperation, they rocked against each other, grinding long and slow until Steve felt shudders rolling though his body. He looked to meet Tony’s eyes, and found the most beautiful and honest expression on his face, colored in shades of vulnerability and glowing with pleasure.
“Yeah...you?” Tony asks but knows he will only be able to hear one answer.
“Well, I dunno, does the state of New York grant annulments based on forced alien weddings?”
“Tony, it’s ok, you’re safe,” he whispered, reaching a hand back to settle firmly on his boyfriend’s shoulder. “Tony, you’re ok-”
