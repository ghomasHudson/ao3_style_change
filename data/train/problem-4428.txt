As it turns out, he hadn’t needed to worry. The second he got out of the Impala, people ran out of the bunker and towards him, Sam, Eileen, Jack and Cas. Oh thank fuck, Cas. Cas. Cas. Cas. Cas. Cas. His brain couldn’t stop repeating the name over and over again and to be honest, he didn’t quiet want it to. It was the same thought he had had Ever Since, but the emotion it brought with it was a different one. While before, it had only held grief and longing, now all he could feel was relief.
After restlessly pacing around his room, the tiredness of the last few days eventually caught up with Dean and he laid down. The cuts on his face stung against the pillow. He should have let Cas heal him.
The entire drive back he kept trying to think of what he would say to Cas, partially to distract himself of the possibility that that hadn't worked, partially because in the last weeks he had never thought further than to the point where he got Cas back. Suddenly, he was very aware of a certain little box in his brain.
“Why?” Jack asked. Like little kids tended to do in that age.
this is the first chapter of five, I'll try to post weekly
“I don’t really have one”, Jack stated simply, browsing through skirts.
Dean sighed and dragged a hand over his face. The cartoon in the background was playing it’s intro. Something about kindness and love. Dean muted the TV.
Pondering the matter further as he gets ready for bed, Cas decides that he likes it. It’s a good thing, he thinks, this evolving relationship with his son. It feels natural, even if one of the side effects winds up being a few jokes at his expense.
"Get here by eight," Jim replied sharply, "I have service at nine."
Dean watched, fascinated, as the witch with the long flowing hair gestured towards Ruby and spoke of her sweetly. “When this poor, lost child came to me for aid, I told her that I’d help her solve her pesky demon issue. All she had to do was put that hex bag in your hand and get you to say the word ‘mother’. With that, my boy, she was able to summon me right to you.”
“I’ll have some of that,” he said, flopping down on the bed when it presented itself to his shins. His fist closed around the neck of the bottle when it was pressed into his palm and he heaved himself up on one elbow to better position himself for a drink.
Hugging tightly, the three linger for quite some time before beginning the return journey. As they hike, she explains what had happened to her and it's pretty much what he'd suspected. Sam dotes on her as they make slow progress. He brushes her hair from her face, fusses over her superficial wounds, and tells her how scared he’d been when she left and didn’t come home.
“And where do you suppose we’ll find this prophet?” Bobby asked.
“Nah, the nurses here are awesome.”
If reading the fine print of his contract and disclosure agreements had been challenging before, it was damn near impossible now that he was so worked up. Dean caught himself re-reading the same gibberish over and over as he tried to ascertain the full extent of how thoroughly horse-fucked he actually was right now.
As they slipped into the tunnel, the decorated walls came to life, huge screens lighting up with cartoon characters… the three Caballeros. Their boat wound around corners as screen after screen danced with animations.
“Gimme a three count before you squeeze that bottle sweet-cheeks,” he commanded, once again abandoning Dean’s blow job to order Lisa around. He almost felt sorry for her now, knowing she wasn’t enjoying this at all and that she was likely aching between her legs with the need to be fucked. He stood there and let the rich man blow him as Lisa prepared to shoot saline up inside him. Again.
For Dean, the second time is almost always better than the first. His hole, already stretched and wet with a creamy load, can easily take all that he’s given and he shivers with delight when he feels the wolf at his back swell larger inside him, a second load ready to burst from his tip.
“Why not have that?” the guy tried.
Charlie drifted into his mind a few times as a mermaid he might be able to couple with. She had always been his favorite of the girls, and he wondered if she might be interested in him. The idea of giving her a baby made him warm in his chest and he realized that he’d be willing to mate with her. He decided then and there that if he saw her, he’d ask if she wanted him.
Cas bustled around, starting up the coffeemaker and getting cups out of the cupboard.
“Do you guys remember when I scored that touchdown that won us state championships?” Ty asked suddenly. Rowena shut her eyes and Bobby let out a sigh. And so it began.
Shooting him a Look, Cas turned back to the window and his contemplation of the occasional flash of grey fur from the squirrel nest in the branches of the tree out front.
His wobbly knees decided that the steps down into the kitchen were as far as he was going to go after his pit stop at the bathroom. He was still sitting there, miserably coffee-less, holding the sides of his throbbing skull and trying to decide if he was actually desperate enough to crawl the last few steps to the black gold. He had just determined that he was when Sam’s voice came from around the doorframe behind him.
He had still had deniability; other than using the name Cassie in that one text to Sam, he had never explicitly confirmed that Cassie was a woman. It had taken lots of quick thinking to dodge pronouns in his replies, but he’d been doing it for so long that it wasn’t as hard as it had been in the beginning.
He swallowed it all and forced a tight little smile. “Never been happier.”
soup with extra vegetables, and in case you hate
Cas and Gabe’s front door was locked. Dean hesitated for a moment over whether it would be alright for him to use his key, but since the alternative was ringing the doorbell at a truly unholy hour, he unlocked the door but knocked lightly as he stepped through into the foyer.
? You could have died, Dean. You could have
“I turned her down,” Dean muttered, desperately wanting a whiskey but asking for a Coke instead.
Check out the work in question here:
“Angels don’t have souls, I thought. That’s why they go to the Empty.”
Instead, they went through the list of films Dean deemed necessary to have seen for a well-rounded cultural experience, Dean shaking his head in despair as he added movie after movie to their to-watch list. Cas took it with good humour, retaliating with his own must-read list, Dean reluctantly conceding that he had about as much reading to do as Cas did movie watching. That circled them into a books versus movies debate that took them through the rest of their meal, both of them demurring when Angelo offered dessert and coffee.
He waited until Gabriel’s door closed—forcefully.
“I can’t,” Jack said patiently. “It’s not a place I can go anymore, Dean. I hold no power there.”
And then he brought Dean his coffee at the table.
Finally, blessedly, alone, Dean stopped pretending to fuss over the car and tilted his head back to stare at the ceiling, letting his shoulders sag. He and Sammy seemed to take turns with these kinds of things, one of them always finding a way to carry on despite their grief when the other couldn’t see a way forward out of the darkness.
Dean knew his flush made him an easy target for further teasing, but then he caught sight of Cas popping out of the kitchen doorway further down the hall, shaking his head ruefully.
“Be selfish, for once in your life,” Sam ordered him. “Yeah, I miss you, of
“It’s a rhizome—”
“And you,” he continued, gently tugging until Cas stepped right up against his chest, right where it felt like it was about to burst open, “you can promise to stay, even when it’s tough, and
He heard Cas’ huff as he grabbed a clean towel out of the linen closet since Cas had almost certainly used his.
so smart. But how someone so smart can be so
Bladder empty and gas tank full, and seemingly without a single cop around to man a speed trap, he managed to turn the nine-hour stretch into eight, stair-stepping his way up through Nebraska into Iowa, stopping again just outside of Des Moines for gas and yet more coffee before pushing through the last few hours to Hastings.
Quick reminder for any non-Canadian readers: Canadian Thanksgiving is the second Monday in October, so this is a long weekend for the guys with the Monday off of work. Québéc tends to celebrate pretty typically (turkey, stuffing, gravy and such), but culturally it's nowhere near as big of a deal as it is in the States.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m getting there.” He took a breath and pushed the words out.
“--that sweet and salty is a classic flavour combination,” Castiel was in the middle of arguing when Dean yanked his brain back to the task at hand. He shook his head as he sprinkled cheese evenly over the dough that he’d so far layered with sauce, pepperoni, sauteed mushrooms, and a handful of pickled jalapenos after an approving nod from Castiel on the other side of the peninsula.
“Mmm,” Cas murmured, pressing forward so Dean’s kisses started landing closer and closer to that spot on his neck that got him to make noises that Dean was pretty sure should be illegal.
Jack hitched himself up onto the bed near Cas’ feet, dropping his hands between his thighs comfortably.
Sam watched Dean fold the washcloth into quarters, struggle to get it to fold over just one more time after that.
Call him crazy, but Sam took that as a good sign that he was definitely barking up the right tree and steadfastly ignored everything his brother said, reminding himself in between barbs that someone had to be the adult in that moment and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be Dean.
“Prick,” he muttered into his beer.
Back in his room he exchanged his robe for pajama bottoms that passed the sniff test and a ratty old Stanford sweatshirt he’d stolen from Sam years ago, added his warmest socks. Setting up his laptop with booze-clumsy fingers took a hot minute, but then: playlist set, headphones on, and with another couple of swigs out of the bottle (how had it ended up nearly half empty already?), he eased onto his bed and let his memory foam remember him.
It surprised him how much he wanted to be affectionate with Cas. Manly pats on shoulders or backs or arms, the occasional knee-slaps, the even more elusive bro-hugs: those were safe; those were familiar. But this…a long, lingering hug that skirted the edges of outright (if somewhat awkward) cuddling…Oh, yeah, he wanted lots more of this, and for once it didn’t make his insides clench up to think about it.
That one word and the expression on his brother’s face said it all.
Even disoriented, Cas’ face was easy to read, as was the restraining hand he held up. “The deal—”
Cas let Dean maneuver them back towards the chairs, but didn’t let go of Dean’s hand as they settled back side-by-side.
It just didn’t make sense.
.” Castiel was staring at the slice suspended between his fingers and thumb in front of his face like he’d seen the face of God.
When he had pulled out his phone to show the pictures to Sam, Sam had broken the vital social contract of Thou Shalt Not Scroll Through Someone Else’s Camera Roll and had landed on a picture taken at a party a few weeks earlier.
He sniffed, genuinely intrigued by the earthy scents of chili powder and cumin after nearly forty-eight hours without proper food. “Whatcha got cooking there, Sammy?”
In spite of the heaviness of Dean’s heart, it leapt at Sam’s shout when Dean lunged at him and got him in a headlock, sticking a wet index into his ear with a triumphant “Hah!”. John didn’t laugh, but some of the deeper lines around his mouth and eyes softened watching Sam trying to tangle his long arms around Dean’s knees to take him down onto the muddy drive.
The tree out front of the apartment had dropped all but its most tenacious of leaves, and Dean knew his days with his Baby were numbered. Her glossy Tuxedo Black body was too important to subject to harsh de-icing salt and slush, and her powerful rear-wheel drive, making her a dream to handle on any kind of dry road, was just an accident waiting to happen in the ice and snow of a Montreal winter. He was reluctantly counting down the days until he’d have to settle her into storage at Bobby’s and trade her spot in the garage for the reliable old Accord he kept for winter driving.
Dean hauled him in for a rough hug.
But there was something off in Dean’s tone, something wistful, and Sam knew that while Cas might have a very different perception of time, being several billion years old and all, Dean just wasn’t ever really fully himself anymore without his angel by his side.
They were nearly at Eileen’s, so Dean asked her to call him back when she had had a chance to check things out, and the Impala’s tires squealed around the final corner.
Utter silence.
“Hey.”
“Fuck,
“Dean…” His name came out softer than he’d ever heard it, a plea for understanding. “I won’t let you bargain yourself for me.”
Cue the sound of screeching tires in Dean’s brain.
Cas was tucked up under the cozy-looking duvet, resting quietly. Dean, on the other hand, was still getting his body back under control as the adrenaline wore off.
His beer dropped out of his suddenly lax grip, and he was up and moving towards him before it hit the ground with a grassy thud. "
“Whatever, jerk. You like it and you’re going to eat it, and I won’t even complain when you sneak out the other half of that pie you think I don’t know about for dessert later.”
“What about Cas? Is he…you’re not just gonna leave him up there alone, are you?”
The discussion got them all the way to the warmly lit Italian restaurant where the owner greeted Cas by name and brought them a candle for their table, snugged away in the back. There was no need for the get-to-know-you conversations that most people fumbled through on first dates; Dean already knew Cas and Gabriel were estranged from their conservative parents and three other siblings, and Cas knew all about Sam and how their mother had died years earlier, sending John Winchester into a fog of grief that had left him a shell of his former self and left most of the responsibility of raising Sam to Dean.
Smiling, Dean let his eyes close and turned his face inwards a bit more. Yeah, he still had no friggin’ idea what he was doing, but hey, neither did Cas. They’d figure it out eventually, the right way, the wrong way, or the Winchester way, but they’d get there.
Even still, running under it all was the faintest whiff of relief. Like eerie gunmetal grey clouds that threatened a thunderstorm, he had been watching for and dreading this moment for months, and now it was finally happening. Maybe, once the thundering devastation of the storm was over, just maybe there would be something good left in its wake.
,” he said admiringly as Cas widened his eyes, all innocence and guilelessness.
They clinked beer bottles solemnly and then Cas picked up his utensils but waited until Dean and Gabe had loaded up their first bites before he started in on his plate. The sound Dean made when he got that perfect first forkful into his mouth made Gabriel choke on his while Cas beamed, all kinds of pleased.
“So you’re ok with Dean and Cas?” he asked when he was ready.
“Maybe he’ll finally consider moving closer,” Dean said, crossing his arms and leaning into the doorframe. He could practically feel a timer running in his head, urging him to hurry, to get downstairs to Cas as quickly as possible, but he held himself back with a firm hand. He
“I only made it, like, nine months or so? Pathetic, I know.” He still wouldn’t look at Cas.
the time for projectile stress-puking like Sam had done during his piano recital in fourth grade.
“And that’s about it.” Gabe turned to face him. “Like the ad said, the garage parking is yours at no extra cost, fridge and stove come with, hydro is obviously your business, and you’ve got free access to the backyard as long as you clean up after yourself. The basement is mostly storage and the laundry machines, but there’s enough room down there if you need to stash your winter tires or whatever.”
“Cas, I-“
Dean spluttered and dropped his keys.
Olivia was oblivious to the tension in the room and grinned up at Cas. “Come sit by me!” She said, pulling him over to the chair next to Dean, completely unaware of her uncles’ discomfort. “This is my other uncle, Uncle Dean. He was gone for a while but he came back. You’ll like him, he has a really cool car and he does tattoos like Papa does.” She clambered into Dean’s lap and leaned back against his chest. “Uncle Cas is a teacher, I get to be in his class when I turn eight, isn’t that right Uncle Cas?”
“Y-yes of course.” Dean said, eyes flicking to the clock that blatantly read half past four.
Cas hummed in agreement and opened his mouth to speak before his phone dinged. He picked it up and wrinkled his nose. “It’s from Dean.” He said, feeling annoyance bubble up.
“Don’t talk with your mouth full” Added Bobby as Dean had gone to answer him whilst still chewing.
“You’re date is a little late, isn’t he?” Bobby questioned, eyeing the clock which clearly read
“You’re done,” Gabriel said, patting Dean’s shoulder as he wiped the hip tattoo down with antibacterial soap.
“I thought you didn’t mind waiting for me?” Cas teased.
He turned around and smiled. "Hiya Cas," He said, feeling more cheerful. "You're okay if I call you that right?"
Dean shook his head. “Those two, I swear,”
“Coming right up” Bobby said finally after Cas began to look uncomfortable. He patted Dean on the shoulder and winked before walking off.
“Dean,” Charlie said, poking her head in the booth. “There’s someone that wants to see you.” There was a glitter in her eye that worried him.
His door was gapped open.
Dean slide up alongside a locker and put on his best, prize winning grin.
“You’ve been ignoring me.” Dean stated, standing up from where he was perched on the edge of the dinning chair.
“No,” Sam sounded anxious. “Are you going after him?”
“Wait,” Bobby said after Dean had calmed down. “What did you say the guy at the end’s name was?”
“Unknown,” Dean said, sending a quick 'yes' before setting his phone down.
“So what did you need to ask my father about?” Cas inquired as they walked along the rows of plants.
Cas grimaced as he pulled up his shirt sleeve but grinned when the small tattoo came into view.
“Pardon me Sir,”
The man was beautiful; there was simply no other word for it. Long bowed legs, tanned skin, carefully styled hair, and the muscular form of a soldier. He had a glass of wine in hand and was chatting with another soldier, a woman with red hair.
Dean had said over text that he’d be there at 8 sharp, but it was half past 10 and he was nowhere in sight. Something in Cas was telling him he wasn’t going to show up at all.
Dean smiled. “Yeah,” He said, giving Cas’ hands a squeeze. “I’d like that too.”
“Earlier today, when we were taking care of the haunting.” Cas said flippantly as he landed on the Animal Planet.
Dean took his time in prepping the area on Cas’ arm where they had decided to put the tattoo which was a few inches below his shoulder. He took extra care in transferring the tattoo stencil onto Cas’ skin before leaning up and pressing a kiss to Cas’ clammy cheek.
“It says here that you and your boyfriend have been in a committed relationship for nearly three years, may I ask why you feel the need to get tested?” Cas questioned, eyeing the file.
They were both thinking it. It was nothing he hadn’t seen before.
Of course Castiel would choose that.
“So good,” Cas moaned out. “I missed this.” He could feel his orgasm rising already, not that it really surprised him he just wished he could hold out longer.
Cas was about to retort when Dean finally walked out of his father’s quarters, looking relieved, the king trailing after him.
“Oh!” Cas said, as if the thought had never entered his mind. “She’s down at the hotel, room 2B or maybe it’s not 2B.” He said with a thoughtful hum.
It was a common reaction; Cas had learned a long time ago not to take it personal.
The way she trailed off was probably supposed to imply something, but Dean did not have the mental capacity at the moment to try to figure out what it was.
if you see me projecting my own neurodivergences onto cas, no you dont
“Well, it sure seems that way, Dean! You have refused to talk to me at any chance you got, you snapped at me, you avoided me, what else am I supposed to think?”
Whatever rock song was playing, Dean wasn’t paying too much attention, faded out and the soft notes of some stupid feel-good song began.
So Cas had suggested they just send Dean out. But nooo, there was going to be much to carry and, according to Eileen and Sam, Dean wouldn't be able to do it alone.
Sam already knew, of course. It wasn’t clear if Eileen figured it out herself, if Cas had told her or if Sam had. But it didn’t take too long before she came up to Dean where he was sitting in the library and said “You’re an idiot Dean, you know that?” She didn’t sound angry, just exasperated and a tiny bit pitying, which wasn’t any better.
Dean didn’t know how long they stayed like this, basking in each other’s presence, trying to get used to the fact that this was real, that they were real. And suddenly it was like touching Cas was the key he had needed to unlock the box in the back of his mind again and before he could stop to think about the consequences, he did it. He pushed Cas away, seeing the hurt and rejection in his eyes before pulling him in again by his stupid trench coat and kissing him like his life depended on it. And after just a second of shock and confusion, Cas kissed him back. Dean felt the early morning sunshine in his back, he heard the birds chirping and he felt Cas' lips on his.
“Forever ago you said you’d send me to the Empty, right? So that means you can send people to the Empty. Or was that just an empty threat? I need to stop saying empty, but the question stands.”
Dean… Dean had given Cas a lot of reasons to hate him, he realized that. The mark of Cain, kicking human Cas out of the bunker, …. Yet, Cas had stubbornly refused to hate him. Though, if he had, maybe he wouldn’t be dead now. Dean quickly abandoned that line of thought, instead choosing to be grateful that, despite being presented with enough reasons not to, Cas had always stayed.
“You really are an idiot, you know that?”, there was nothing but affection in his tone “How could you have ever thought I wouldn’t…” he trailed off. “You must have realized that I love you too”
again a big thank you to Arden (@gayliteraryanalysis on tumblr) who added countless commas to this chapter alone, not to mention the last one.
It had been months, and yet getting into bed next to Cas still felt new. Dean looked at the angel, smiling like the stupidly lovesick idiot he was. But it was okay, Cas was a stupidly lovesick idiot too.
“Hmpg”, Dean responded very eloquently, “what are you even doing here, I thought you need to sleep now. It's midnight, why aren’t you sleeping?”
Breakfast the next morning made it easy for Dean to realize that at least some of his thoughts from the night before were downright ridiculous. “He had nothing to fight for, after all.” Dean was such a self-centered asshole. Even if, Dean thought, as he sat down a bowl of rainbow colored cereal in front of the kid, even if Cas really thought Dean didn’t love him back. Even if he really thought that he could never have Dean,  “The one thing I want…”. Even then, Cas would still be fighting to come back. Because one thing was sure, Cas loved Jack like a son and he would never willingly stay away from his kid any longer than necessary.
“Not consciously, no. Everyone else did, though.”
Cas’s slowed down, from running to walking, and from walking to coming to a stop right in front of Dean. He had never been too good with personal space, after all. “Dean”, he said, voice so full of emotions that it was impossible to catch up on all of them, but the biggest underlying one was Love. “Cas”, Deans voice sounded broken, choked up with a similar emotion cocktail. He hesitated to touch Cas, afraid that this would turn out to be another dream, afraid that Cas wasn’t really back. Cas had no such inhibitions. “Oh, Dean”, he said and hugged him like it was his only purpose in life. Tears running down his cheeks, Dean pulled him close and, despite being taller, buried his face in Cas’s shoulder.
“Okay”, Dean said and, after a couple of minutes of silence, “How do you know you’re a man?”
“No, Cas!”, Dean snapped, too tired to stay civil, “I’m not some kind of fragile thing, I’m not some damsel in distress for you to save or whatever, I can handle myself for fucks sake”
Dean had known that Cas would react well, that one was no surprise, but so had Eileen.
this is the first multichapter fic i ever wrote, i really hope you guys liked it
“No, I’m not”
He had been rather cruelly divested of that notion since. At first, he had just assumed that Dean didn’t know what to make of the situation, then he had thought Dean felt uncomfortable with Cas’ love for him. Now it seemed that Dean was angry. Cas sighed, earning a brief glance from Dean before the other man went back to ignoring him.
“We need to go shopping tomorrow, Dean, we’re almost out of milk and Jack needs more of that unhealthy cereal he loves so much.”
-------------
In the next couple of days conversations like that kept happening. Cas kept trying to talk to him, Dean kept shutting him down (his excuses were steadily becoming less believable, but Cas never called him out on it). Dean could see that Cas was getting increasingly exasperated and if he was honest, the whole thing was starting to weigh on him too.
“Huh?” Dean asked absentmindedly.
“Everyone who loves me gets hurt. You should know that better than most! Excuse me for not wanting you to get hurt”
That didn’t minimize the uncomfortable tension that appeared every time they were in the same room together. So Dean had been happy when he had heard of the hunt Sam wanted to go on, immediately volunteering to join him. He had thought some time away from Cas would do him good. Wrong again.
The entire time he was hiding in his room and his cave, Dean wished he could spend more time with Cas. A couple of days later he wished he had remembered the saying about being careful what you wish for. Okay, yes, he was being dramatic. But it was bound to be an uncomfortable day.
Especially when he looked like that, wearing clothes a normal person would wear, a shirt and jeans with an unzipped hoodie thrown on top. He looked… soft like this. It suited him.
Oh fuck. Uhm. Okay. Dean had heard of this. Transgender, right? How do people react to that? He didn’t want to look like an asshole, after all. And he wasn’t, not about this, he genuinely wasn’t. He’d just never been confronted with it before and didn’t want to do anything wrong. Jesus, don’t let him fuck this up.
Amused, Cas answered, “Yes, Dean, I use he/him pronouns”
Dean kept thinking back to his conversation with Cas a few days ago. The only thing that really makes someone a man is feeling like one.
Until he did.
“So uhm. But you don’t mind if I say he to you, right?” Dean asked out loud.
With a resigned sigh Dean looked down at the empty bottle of beer in his hand. That was all he had managed to convince his brother to buy for him, beer. He thought briefly about leaving his room, leaving the bunker, driving to the nearest liquor store and drinking it, but he was self-aware enough to know that that was not going to happen. No, his miserable, useless ass was gonna continue sitting here, wallowing in his own sadness. Not like he was good for anything else even before…. His thoughts trailed off. Well, Before.
All of that goodness is goin’ with you now
“Cause you’re a guy”, Dean said very slowly, like talking to a toddler, seeing as he actually was.
“And why would I do that?”
“Thank you”, Sam said. Dean didn’t say anything.
Dean knew it was ridiculous, but he was scared out of his mind. He knew everyone had reacted well to Jack, but he couldn’t help but think that it was different with him. He was a man, his dad had always told him so and he had made sure to act like it his whole life. But he didn’t really feel like one. Well, he did sometimes. But most of the time, being a man just felt to him like a performance. One he was used to, having acted it since his childhood, but a performance nonetheless.
“So you
In books people always stopped perceiving their surroundings in moments like this.  Dean didn’t. He was fully aware of everything that was going on around him, of the eyes of Sam, Eileen and Jack on them, of the fact that people saw him kissing Cas, kissing another man and he didn’t care. All he cared about was Cas, Cas, Cas.
Cas sighed and, knowing that he wouldn’t be able to solve this now, went to find Jack. The kid was sitting in the living room, watching cartoons. When Cas entered, he looked up, briefly, waved and went back to watching TV. Cas sat down beside him, content to just spend time with his son in silence. That didn’t seem to be what Jack had in mind, though, because after that episode was done he paused the TV and turned to Cas.
“You didn’t even realize”
Dean hated that he was the one responsible for this. He didn’t know what to do, so he continued as before. He was still avoiding Cas, it obviously pained the angel to be in the same room as him and at least that Dean could solve. By spending as little time in the same room as possible. Which was hurting Dean, but it was his own fault, really. If he hadn’t snapped at Cas, he wouldn’t have this problem. He would be sitting on a different sofa than Cas in a tense silence, or making uncomfortable smalltalk. And while that didn’t sound like Dean's dream, it was a lot better than this. Dean had missed Cas on the hunt, yes, but now that he was back in the same place with him he missed him even more.
Sam texted Eileen, thank fuck, maybe that way Cas wouldn’t be there when they came back. He always got so worried when Dean was hurt and that would not help the situation at all. Cas was probably asleep anyways, which was lucky. And a sign of how human he was now. In the last days Cas had experimented and tried to find out how much of an angel he still was. Not much, as it turned out. He needed to eat, sleep, breathe and so on. He didn’t have his wings anymore. He did have his healing, his supernatural memory and just slightly more strength than any human should have.
Dean had expected Cas to make a bigger deal out of it, had been prepared for a long speech about how Cas accepted him, but  if he was being honest, he liked this quiet acceptance better. At least from Cas.
my tumblr url is the same as here
“Well”, Cas began, “Angels are agender, normally. We don’t really have a concept of gender. I do, though, and sometime after I came to earth I realized that I am a man.”
Dean, who had been working himself up into a rage, seemed to deflate at that. His shoulders sagged, he closed his eyes long enough for Cas to become concerned, they were still in a car, afterall. But Dean opened his eyes again, and pulled over to the side of the road. He let his hands fall from the wheel and dragged them over his face.
That seemed to bring Dean from wherever his mind had gone to back into the present, he slowly turned to Cas, looked at him for a second before, lurching across the car to kiss him. As aggressive as it had been initiated, it was a gentle kiss, full of emotion. When they broke apart, they leaned their foreheads against each other. Cas raised his hand and slowly wiped away the tears on Dean's cheeks.
Cas opened his eyes. He didn’t need to sleep, not yet, but he chose to. He liked it. He liked closing his eyes after exchanging “I love you”s with Dean. And he liked waking up with him in his arms. He liked that like this, day after day, every morning, he got confirmation that he really could have the one thing he wanted. After everything they had been through the last 12 or so years it was very reassuring that he could fade away into the land of unconsciousness and every time, without fail, when he returned, the first thing he would see would be Dean.
“There is no other shoe”, he whispered, awed.
“It’s not that. I do. Fuck, I love you, man. Like, the way you love me. I do. It’s just-”
Cas took a deep breath and held it for a second before he could continue to escalate this situation. But, as it seemed, it didn’t even need him for that.
But Sam didn’t take the bait, eyes on the Ikea bookcases that Dean had set up side-by-side along the wall opposite the bed.
“Aw, Cas, aren’t you just the best,” Dean teased, exaggeratedly batting his eyelashes to get a smile out of Cas.
Cas was still talking, thankfully oblivious for once to Dean’s inner turmoil.
“Better sleep with one eye open, Sammy,” Dean taunted. He huffed in surprise when Sam tried to twist free and had to claw for a better grip. “My clippers have a date with that hair of yours.”
No matter how guilty Dean felt, even he couldn’t hate himself 24/7. Against his will he found himself having good days, stretches of hours and hours where he didn’t think about the grave he had started digging for the relationship that was every day becoming more important to him. After a week or so, he even stopped flinching when a message came in from Sam.
Clocking Sam’s frustrated expression—he wasn’t having any luck reaching Eileen, it seemed—Dean shook his head as he focused back on the road. “Not long, couple days. So if you showed back up where you were when you poofed out, I guess that means everyone else did, too, and is probably none the wiser.”
“Sure, sure,” Dean retorted, sliding the pizza into the oven and setting a timer. “Beer?”
, you can’t fuck with it like that.”
He saw Jack’s face crumple, his head shaking a little with instinctive denial. Dean let the silence draw out while he took a couple of slow breaths through his mouth, trying to steady himself.
“You can if you want to.”
“You spent all this time with a girlfriend named Cassie who doesn’t exist. Now Sam is here, and at some point he’s going to ask about her. What happens when he does?”
In this chapter is the second piece of incredible artwork that
Dean was in the middle of a pearl-clutching faux-outraged reply when the bunker shook with a deep, sonic boom.
“I’m gonna go grab that shower,” he interrupted, shoving back from the table and practically running for the doorway.
“‘Cas’ is fine,” Cas said, a tiny quirk lifting one side of his lips.
“What part of classic car do you not appreciate?”
Steady hands took the mug from his shaking fingers. It was Jack, Dean noted dazedly, crouched in front of him, eyes shiny as he set the cup aside and lightly touched Dean’s shoulder over where the scar of Cas’ handprint had been, where his bloody handprint still marked Dean’s jacket back in his room.
“I wanted to tell you that I loved you in Purgatory that last time,” Dean said after a while. He ignored Cas’ startled inhale and plowed on. “I was so close to saying it when I saw you back at the portal, but you kind of seemed like you maybe knew already, so I just…didn’t.”
he could do, about any it, and he smothered the intense urge to just rest his head on Baby’s steering wheel and never get up again.
“Sure,” Dean said through the thickness that had appeared in his throat. Sue him, it had been an emotional roller coaster of a day. “That’d be great.”
“So what happens now?” Cas’ voice was little more than a rough scrape, but it was enough to startle Dean out of his miserable contemplation.
“You’re back,” Cas said as he pulled back, running his eyes all over like he was checking Dean for injuries or something. “What are you doing back so soon?”
“Um…stupendous,” Dean said, running low on synonyms. Hoping to distract his boyfriend from that fact, he slid his hands under the waistband of Cas’ favourite pyjama bottoms, worn thin from years of wear and machine washing. Only hot, soft skin met his palms and he growled; thank
“Oh, Cassieeeeeeeee,” Gabe singsonged when he opened the door to Dean, “your bestie’s here.”
Considerate, he had thought, more curious than ever to meet his mysterious new landlord slash neighbour, adding the number to his contacts.
“Asses aside,” he continued with a little snigger, hands finding their way under the hem of the long-sleeved t-shirt Cas was wearing and onto the warm skin beneath, “your metaphor of me as a giant plant covered in fuck-you flowers is kind of, hmm…cute.”
His phone sat innocuously on the vanity next to him, still showing the evidence of his cowardice, the colours muting as the power saving option came on, but the screen not yet locked.
The sharp inhale Dean sucked in tasted like ash. His heart started to pound, slow and heavy in his chest, ringing dully in his ears. “Really didn’t need the extra helping of guilt with my breakfast,” he said pointedly.
But Cas had told him that he loved him, and even if he had meant it in the most platonic way possible, it still didn’t feel right to use the life Cas had gifted him to just keep hooking up with strangers.
It was a thought made even more terrifying by the endlessness of his options, and after a couple of minutes nodding along to Sam’s enthusiastic diatribe, his head was starting to spin.
“I just keep thinking of all the stuff I didn’t say to him, y’know?”
Dean had to admit that Jack had pretty much nailed his idea of perfection with one exception. There was no other bedroom, so Dean had to swallow the surprising little jab of disappointment that Cas must have his own place somewhere else.
Space was weird here, Dean decided. It wasn’t like anything he had a frame of reference for, which was tripping him out hard. It was still utterly dark so he couldn’t see anything, but when the Empty had finally stopped laughing and he’d felt himself being…
for Cas’ quirk of not wearing underwear on the weekends.
Dean had no idea that his new landlord would end up being his better-to-have-loved-and-lost when he first moved into 5406 Rue Saint-Zotique Est.
gone right after he’d sacrificed himself?
The call he would give anything to get wasn’t going to come.
Dean rolled his eyes, relief and worry and impatience all warring for his attention. “Ok, here’s the deal—”
Dean didn’t mean to tune his brother out, he really didn’t, but honestly he didn’t really care about the philosophical why of it all. His field of fucks was as empty as his toolkit of healthy coping strategies. His fingers brushed over the lump of his traitorously silent phone in his pocket.
A beat. A breath. That nowhere and everywhere light reflected in Cas’ wide eyes. Dean could see every shade of blue in them, an eternal sky meeting an endless ocean. He smiled into them, even though he could feel the spell starting to fade. It was now or never.
Dean watched from the car, knuckles tight on the steering wheel as Sam disappeared inside.
He was just pressing Save when a text popped up.
“Dean.”
Forking up a bite of eggs, Sam shook his head. “No, of course not. But I’ll keep looking until I find something with better odds of success.” He chewed his mouthful, swallowed, did the same with a bite of toast, added in a sip of coffee.
He had been on the road for a couple of hours in utter silence before he actually processed that it was the middle of the night, but the minor inconveniences of his body—fatigue, hunger, a straining bladder—were barely even blips on his radar.
“Stop worrying, I’m not going to get drunk. Let’s just go have some fun, you and me, just like the old days, ok?”
to listen—” Cas was looking less nervous and more worried now, his hands starting to twist together.
“Ok,” he said finally, and closed himself into the bathroom to wash off Cas’ scent for what he realized too late might be the last time. It was almost enough to make him walk right back out there and bite the damn bullet with their mingled scents still on his skin, but if Cas was going to end things he probably wouldn’t be feeling up to things like basic hygiene for a while, so probably best to get a shower in while he could.
“I get it, you know. You’re grieving, and we’re Winchesters…we usually do that with a lot of whiskey and not a whole lot of talking, so I’ve let it go for as long as I could. I figured maybe you’d come around to it in your own time like you usually do, but tonight? What you did, picking a fight in a fucking
Dean would have paid more attention to what was coming out of the oven, except that Cas was wearing a loose pair of grey sweatpants that were riding low on his hips, t-shirt all rucked up in the back by the knot of the apron he had on. The resulting exposed strip of skin was as golden as it was on his arms, and to make the whole picture just that much more tantalizing to Dean, the sleeves of Cas’ t-shirt pulled tight over his biceps as he reached forward to retrieve his prize.
And after so many years, so much confusion and uncertainty, so many will-they-won’t-theys, it was just that easy. He pulled back just enough to get his knees up on the bed, tugging at Cas to get him to follow suit, and then he just hugged the crap out of the guy.
Sam all but shouted the last words in Dean’s face, punctuating them with little shakes, half expecting Dean to pop up swinging at any moment. Except that he didn’t.
Following the sound of his brother’s reply, Dean found him at the map table, a notebook and pen in front of him. Sam looked up as Dean came closer.
"Dean," Gabe said sharply, pointing at the exit that they were about to miss. They made it with only two horns blared at them, but it forced Dean to focus. Bad enough if he lost Cas, but if he wrecked his Baby on top of that...well, it just didn't bear thinking about.
look.
The bed was empty, neatly made except for a rumpled stretch of duvet near the foot. It looked like it always did, but it felt soulless without Cas’ vibrant presence to bring it to life.

“You always complain about me being a self sacrificing idiot, as if you aren’t just as bad”, Dean tried to joke but Cas saw right through him, talking about this was getting his husband choked up. The 5th bore many bad memories for Cas, but it wasn’t any different for Dean.
“Are you okay?”, Cas asked, standing awkwardly in front of the table.
So yeah, Cas was almost human, again, Deans fault. If Cas hadn’t gone to the Empty, he would still be an angel. Now he could never be one again, not if he wanted to stay out of the Empty. Which meant that Dean had not only caused Cas’ death but also was responsible for him no longer having the powers he used to. Dean couldn’t imagine how painful it must be to be turned from a celestial being into an almost-human (he tried not to think about the last time Cas had been human). Cas didn’t mention anything about being unhappy as a human, but it wasn’t like the guy had talked about stuff that bothered him ever before.
i barely managed to get this done on time,  i wrote most of it this afternoon before evening class, so if there are any mistakes please tell me but be nice about it
Somehow, Dean had managed to fall asleep, He didn’t sleep well, not much of a surprise considering what he had thought about before. He was tired, but what else was new. It wasn’t like he had slept well even just once since Cas’ death. He was used to it, and he still got his four hours most of the time so he was fine. Tired, but fine.
“Yes, Dean. I am a “dude”.”, Cas said slowly, “I thought you were aware of that, seeing as you freaked out about it pretty bad at the beginning of our relationship.”
Dean didn’t even know why he lashed out like that. No, scratch that, looking back on it he did know. It wasn’t too hard to connect his outburst (damsel in distress for you to save) with how he felt about Cas’ love confession. What? Dean could be self aware if he wanted to.
Sam and Eileen had started working on the Bunker so it could house more people and well, as it turns out, you need stuff for that. And they did have some stuff for renovating at hand but not all of it. So of course, someone had to go to the hardware store. The nearest hardware store was two hours away, not too much, especially compared to Cas’s lifetime. But Sam and Eileen had ensured that it would feel like an eternity for him.
“Like I said, everyone who loves me gets hurt. You, Jesus, you died because you love me. You are just too important to me, you can’t die again, Cas”
(See the end of the chapter for
The next day found Cas sitting on the couch in the living room for most of its duration. At this point, he wasn’t even thinking about Dean’s strange behavior, he was just feeling about it. And it wasn’t good feelings. The unease and uncertainty of the last days had given way to wild speculations and conflicting emotions.
“Eileen told me you would be here around this time, I decided to stay up and make sure you guys are okay”
“Why am I here?” asked Billie.
After the fifth time he had woken up like that the breakfast stopped being eggs and bacon and started being instructions as to where he could find the ingredients himself. After the tenth time, people started pestering him about getting fresh air. “You can read outside”, “You could drive into town, read in a café, you know, see other people” But since Dean wasn’t a tired college student trying to make his life less miserable by romanticizing the tedious process of studying, he instead chose to stay where he was. He knew seeing nature would only make him think of Cas, he knew his heart would stop every time he saw a trench coat if he were to participate in society again. The 15th time he woke up like that it was to see his brother's worried face at the other end of the table. “Dean, this can’t go on like this” “I am aware”
From the corner of his eyes he saw Eileen shaking her head and singing something that Dean was sure wasn’t all too kind. She left.
So, a two hour drive, shopping and another two hours of driving with Dean were not the most appealing thing Cas could imagine doing with his day. But here he was. Here they were, rather. The first part of the drive happened in absolute silence, Dean apparently just as uncomfortable with the situation as Cas.
“Nope”, Jack said, still entirely happy, not aware of Dean's inner struggle to do this right.

“Dean”
----------
“Look”, Cas said gently, “you don’t love me. That is okay, but you could have just said that instead of showing me”
Dean glared at his brother, thinking “traitor” as loudly as he could, trying to telegraph the word into Sam's mind. Sam had the audacity to glare right back at him, looking like he didn’t feel bad in the slightest.
“You were able to talk to Jack just fine”, Cas said in his matter of fact tone that shouldn’t be able to sound as accusatory as it did.
“Nope, I don’t really care either way”
“I’m not trying to make you feel better. Cas really isn’t angry. He is hurt. He won’t tell me what happened, but I know it has to do with you. You hurt dad, he is not angry at you, he is sad. I am angry at you, though”
Dean was aware he was in a depressive episode and he was aware that it was a bad one. He had managed to bring his alcohol consumption back down to a manageable level, or well, Sam had forced him to. He had not managed to leave the bunker. Unsurprisingly, he hadn’t called a therapist either. He hadn’t unlocked the little box in the far corner of his brain. He had, however, managed to leave his room. Only to wallow in sadness in a different part of the bunker, though, so he didn’t count it as a win the way Sam, Eileen and Jack clearly did.
The hurt look in Cas’ eyes only helped to make Dean angrier. He stood up and stormed out of the kitchen, all the way into his room. Closing the door behind his back, he leaned against it and took a few deep breaths. Shit. That was. Not great. Fuck. Well, it would at least definitely help Cas fall out of love with him. Dean laughed, humorlessly.

If Cas had been mad at him, if he had yelled at Dean or completely ignored him, that would have been better. Better than this resigned kind of sadness Cas was trying to hide behind smalltalk and subtle annoyance. Dean was being an asshole to Cas but the bastard refused to be an asshole back at him.
“We all have problems, huh? Well, what kind of problems do you have? Not enough hunts happening to play the hero? Too much free will? Well, the love of my life has been hurting me and being an asshole to me ever since I got back from the Empty. You think you have it bad? I confessed my love to save a man that seems to do everything he can to hurt me. If anyone needs to “suck it up”, it’s you.”
Clumsily, Dean asked: “So… a woman, then?” hoping desperately it was the right thing to say.
Kudos and comments are more than appreciated, yall give me life
Cas didn’t end up telling her and she only pressed a bit before realizing that he wasn’t comfortable talking about that. They had continued to talk, however, and at the end of the evening Cas had felt a lot less bad than he had before.
Unsurprisingly, Dean didn’t sleep well that night either. The constant lack of actual relaxation was starting to take a toll on him; he spent the entire morning grumbling around in the kitchen over his coffee, deaf and blind to the entire rest of the world. Well, almost the entire rest. He did notice when Cas stood at the door of the kitchen, about to enter, saw Dean and immediately turned around again and left. Dean himself left the kitchen half an hour later, the angel had to eat breakfast at some point and it was clear he wouldn’t do it while Dean was there. Which was fair but hurtful nonetheless.
“Dad, are Dean and you fighting?”, he asked. He really was a kid, even if he might not look like one. And as much as Cas wanted someone to talk to, he would never burden his family like that, much less his son.
Apparently there were people who used they/them pronouns. Like as a singular. He went shopping. They went shopping. She fired a gun. They fired a gun.
Dean had to be honest, he wasn’t thrilled to be in her presence again. Not at all, and it probably showed. But he reminded himself of his plan, turned around to face the personification of death and, deciding to forgo any pleasantries, just like she had, started to talk.
“Cas”
And that was the end of that conversation.
“The Righteous Man” indeed. If that description had ever fit Dean, it wasn’t by any merit of John. Or Chuck, for that matter. Cas, the angel who had invented free will; he was the one who had taught Dean how to be his own person.
sorry this took so long, I have not been able to get words to work. i'll try to have the next chapter out within the next two weeks.
if you give me kudos i love you and if you comment id die for you
Shifting, so he was half sitting against the headboard, Dean pulled Cas closer and stayed quiet, letting Cas take his time to decide where he wanted to take this conversation.
Dean was aware that this wasn’t healthy. He was a very self-aware person, thank you very much. That didn’t mean he always did something about this awareness, no, in fact most of the time he didn’t do anything about it. Like now.
kudos and comments are very appreciated <3
“Yeah, yeah”, Dean said dismissively (like an asshole and a liar), at the same time that Sam said “I’m fine but Dean’s a bit beat up”
“Dean.” Cas was talking very slowly, choosing his words carefully, “Chuck is gone. There are no more apocalypses. The Empty can’t get to me. We are as safe as we will ever get. I am as safe as I will ever get.”
Cas hadn’t expected Dean to run up to him and kiss him, he wasn’t delusional. But he had expected for there to be a conversation. An uncomfortable, possibly crushing conversation, yes. But even that would have been better than this refusal to talk about what had happened.
“I really am sorry for hurting you like that, Dean. I would do it again, but I am sorry.”
“That's very nice Cas, you didn’t have to”, Sam said, looking at Dean intensely as if willing him to say something.
“I love you too”
Cas turned around to face her and signed “It’s nothing”, feeling Eileen's glare before he had even finished the sentence. He sighed “Dean is refusing to talk to me.”
Cas sighed. “No, Jack. Dean just had a difficult time and he refuses to talk. You know how he can be” It wasn’t a lie, but it was far enough from the truth that it wouldn’t worry Jack.
2 Months, 2 Weeks, 5 Days since Dean had married him. To think that Cas almost hadn’t gotten to have this. To think about how close he had been to being trapped in the Empty forever, never getting to see Dean again, never getting to kiss him, never getting to marry him. That he had almost spent the rest of eternity in that cold, dark and lonely place, it chilled him to the bones.
“Cas”, Dean said one night, after watching a movie together, “I think I’m not a man. At least not always”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then let’s go there”
They did their shopping in relative silence, limiting themselves to pragmatic, short sentences determining what they needed to get next and where to find it. It was, as the drive had been, deeply uncomfortable, but at least now Cas had something to do.
Unintentional as it was, Dean had gone and gotten another one of his loved ones killed, just like he always did. Loving him was dangerous and he knew that. He never wanted to hurt his loved ones, yet he always did.
hello, everyone! sorry it took me so long to write this fic, but hey, at least it's written, right?
He probably would have spent the rest of the evening stewing like that, if it wasn’t for Eileen telling him to help in the kitchen. After cutting vegetables together for a few minutes in comfortable silence, Eileen spoke up.
It had been 15 days since Cas had gotten back and four days since he had last tried to talk to Dean. Oh, they talked. Small talk. Uncomfortable small talk, to be precise. But they didn’t talk about Cas’ love confession. Not for a lack of trying on his part, no. Cas had tried for eleven days, sometimes several times a day, but Dean shot him down every time. Rather rudely too, at times. And Cas had taken the hint and backed off, painful as it was.
Their family knew better than to disturb them on a 5th and so they spent the whole day together in their house, most of it on the couch in the living room. It wasn’t a happy day or even a particularly comfortable one. Both spent most of it lost in their own thoughts and memories , pretending to be paying attention to whatever show was running and pretending not to notice that the other was doing exactly the same. The 5th of May 2021, just as the past couple of 5ths was a good day. A quiet, somber day, at times even a sad day.
“Not planning on it, no.”
The ad had been pretty bare bones; he knew it was a two-bedroom apartment to rent on the upper floor of a duplex, with a garage parking space and access to the backyard included. The rent wasn’t unreasonable at all and frankly it was a frigging miracle to find a decent place outside of the usual July first rental start dates, so he was admittedly excited as he headed around to the front.
As he continued along that wall, he appreciated how the rug in front of the fireplace was worn into a state of comfortable shabbiness. The twin of the leather armchair he’d been enjoying was still stationed by the hearth, a small side table and a big tufted ottoman positioned between them.
Oh yeah, and just in case he had managed to forget the reality that jabbed at him mercilessly every time he let himself remember: Cas was gone.
Cas, who had covered a colleague’s weekend shift as a favour, was off that Monday, so Dean played hooky from work (ignoring Bobby’s knowing snort when he called in “sick”) to accost Cas on his way back from his late morning run. After a sweaty session that started with Cas chasing him up his apartment stairs and ended with Dean bent over his own counter with Cas sliding slickly between his thighs, gasping encouragement into the damp space between his braced forearms, they collapsed onto the floor in a sticky heap, Cas groaning at his throbbing legs.
Shrugging, he figured he could
But when he pulled back, Bobby forestalled him with a raised palm. “C’mon, let’s grab a cold one and I’ll fill you in. Lotta folks are gonna want to see you.”
Dean was grinning up into the camera, the angle clearly showing that it was a selfie. Pressed into his side with her arms around his waist, her nose-scrunching grin not at all detracting from the loveliness of her face, was Cas’ best friend, Anna.
“So, what? You’re just going to let this go?”
“Bobby,” Dean breathed. He almost didn’t turn around, hope warring with doubt, but the lure proved too strong.
“You say that now,” Castiel replied with a skeptical look. “Give it time.”
“I can’t—Wait, Cas...you got Cas out?”
Being a reasonably smart guy, Dean knew a golden opportunity when one was presented to him. “You might regret that invitation when I show up in full Habs regalia and my extremely classy beer hat with dual straws.”
First, Sam’s expression brightened at the idea of a night out, then it sobered a little when he realized that Dean wanted to go to a bar, flashed disappointment for a second and finally settled on stoic as he opened his mouth to—
Cas didn’t say anything, but he hadn’t turned away either. Dean reached carefully for his shoulder; let his hand run down Cas’ arm. He didn’t shrug him off so Dean decided to push his luck and curled his fingers around Cas’ damp palm.
Perhaps nighttime wasn't so bad after all.
Cas nodded. “He thinks you’re using me and he wants me to cut it off with you.” He stated, rolling his eyes. “Which I’m not going to do.” He added quickly at Dean’s alarmed look.
“I have something in mind,” Dean said, picking a fresh spot on the page before beginning to sketch.
"What makes you think that's all I want?" Dean asked hotly.
Cas was pale as a ghost but nodded. He slowly sat down in the chair and watched as both Dean and Gabriel finished with the clean up.
“He’s just being over protective is all”
“You may,” Cas said, nervously taking the man’s offered arm. “And Captain, you may call me Cas.”
“Are you sure?”
“Contain yourself,” Dean said with a snort. He glanced up at Tyler whose knuckles were white from gripping the armrests and had his eyes scrunched shut, face twisted in an obvious grimace of pain. He shut off the tattoo machine. “You okay?”
The lips were on his neck again, nipping and sucking. “You’re okay with this?” Dean asked, and it must have been the third time he had since they left the store.
Cas felt his cheeks heat up with embarrassment. “Oh, I’m sorry.”
“Actually,” Gabriel piped up. “I was kind of hoping you could cover for me.”
It had been ten years since Bobby had come home to find a note telling him to call Sam as soon as possible because there wasn’t time to explain. Dean’s name was hurriedly scrawled across the bottom.
True to Cas’ word, Gabriel stalked into the parlor Monday morning, looking as pissed off as ever. He refused to speak to Dean unless he needed something and even then he used short, clipped sentences. One could hardly call him productive, but at least he was there.
Charlie, Bobby, Donna, Garth and his family, Jody and the girls, every person who had thus far escaped the inevitable conclusion that seemed to befall anyone the Winchesters cared about was gone.
it that way, mind you, but because it was fast, simple. Basic, like him.
“I see. Well, in that case, may I take you out to dinner tomorrow night?” He rushed to clarify. “Not as friends, I mean. As a date.”
Cas rolled his eyes at them both but addressed Dean. “Don’t encourage him, he gets himself into enough trouble as it is.”
He knew Cas was in the Empty, knew that he probably wouldn’t be able to hear him, but as he had taken to doing in recent months whenever shit got a little too real for him, he closed his eyes and sent a whispered prayer out into the privacy of his room.
It was way more fun to shop when you didn’t have to stress over storage space, Dean discovered, and in no time he had a cart heaped with what he’d decided to justify as ‘necessities’, and which included things like three different kinds of mustard, a jar of nearly every pickled item the store carried, and one of those fancy glass press coffee makers with a little bag of freshly ground Columbian coffee. No more Folgers drip coffee for him!
“…oooookay?”
He had hugged Cas before, plenty of times but never like this, and it was…amazing. Cas had always been much sturdier than he looked under that ill-fitting suit and baggy coat, and Dean didn’t even have to duck to hook his chin comfortably over Cas’ shoulder. Cas’ arms came up around him tentatively, with barely any pressure.
,” Jack replied with a little shrug. “But I know what you mean. And…yes, I suppose that I am, now.”
“Aw, Cas…” Shit, seeing that reaction to the barest scrap of affection made Dean sniffle again. They were such fucking idiots, the pair of them.
In no time they were settled on Dean’s ugly but exceedingly comfortable brown couch, shoulders leaning easily together as they got their feet up on the matching ottoman, dishes of pie and ice cream in their laps. Cas held their glasses of scotch, musing that it would likely pair well with the fall flavours of apple pie while Dean fussed with remotes and controllers.
Running his hands through his hair, which left it even messier than usual, Cas blew out a slow breath and chuckled.
“Dean, you’re my brother, and I love you. But you’re a fucking idiot sometimes.”
Until now. Until Cas.
Rolling up to his feet in one smooth move that Dean’s perennially creaky mechanic’s joints envied, Cas stretched his arms up overhead, grimacing and nodding as he caught a whiff of himself. “You’re not joining me?”
Jack’s footsteps echoed behind them as he entered the library. A couple of thuds, likely books being set down, followed by a soft scrape as he pulled a chair out. He heaved a sigh, one that sounded about as worn out as Dean felt. Poor kid. Dean stared into the dark ripple of coffee in his cup, guilt bubbling to the top of the toxic stew of emotions that was on a constant low simmer inside him—hello there, old friend.
He was rewarded with a small one. “I know.” But Cas’ face fell quickly back into its usual serious lines and he fidgeted with the dishtowel he’d been wielding to keep the drip rack pile to a manageable size.
“You’ve gotten pretty good at lecturing me,” he said lightly. “I know what you’re doing here, by the way, and I love you for it.” He turned to fully face Sam, his eyes shining. “I love you, you know. Always have, always will.”
even as he choked out a “No”.
“Well, well,” Gabriel hissed at him. “Look what came slithering in to explain itself.”
Castiel spared a quick glance up at his brother’s unusually serious face.
stupid, he chastised himself, doubling forward to shove the heels of his hands in hard against his eyes.
Dean swallowed hard, the stinging in his eyes at odds with the leap of gratitude in his chest. Come what may, Cas was
It was a much more pleasant reunion scene this time. Cas was standing up on his own two feet and Dean wasn’t barking panicked questions. There was time for a long hug between Cas and Jack, and a pleased grin from Jack when Cas finally let go and immediately stepped back to Dean’s side.
“So we’re in agreement then?” Dean asked. “I don’t lie, and you don’t leave.”
It took Dean a while to find Cas. He finally tracked him down on the dock that jutted into the quiet lake, tucked up into one of the weathered Adirondack chairs.
To show how done he was with that stunted attempt at conversation he turned away to finish closing up the car, meticulously checking that all of the windows were up and the locks punched down even though his baby was about as safe and secure as she could ever be.
Sam pushed himself away to roughly scrub his hands over his face, staring into a mirror with his palms framing his cheeks. Had he said enough? Had he said too much?
plan for when this all inevitably blew up in his face and he had to explain himself to Cas. Sam had made assumptions, and Dean just hadn’t clarified things. It wasn’t like he had outright lied to Sam...or to Cas. That’s what he told himself when he couldn’t sleep, staring at the ceiling over his too-small single bed and desperately wishing he was home with Cas instead.
“So,” he said quietly.
Dean tumbled out of the rift…thingy, Cas’ weight slumping heavier and heavier against his side, already yelling for—
“’S jus’ a little blood,” Dean slurred from his perch on what they had dubbed the Patch-up Stool in the corner.
“Heya, son.”
“I’d like to revisit that whole necking like horny teenagers thing now, if you’re still amenable?”
While he worked his way through the bowl, he tried and failed to keep from worrying about his brother, who still hadn’t called. He wanted to hate Dean, but he knew firsthand that everyone had their own battles to fight. It didn’t hurt that he also liked Dean, liked how happy he’d made Cas, liked having a front row seat to see their little love story play out. Or at least he had, right up until things had gone horribly wrong and his little brother’s heart had been collateral damage.
For the first time since moving in, Dean wasn’t happy to be climbing those stairs. Each step was taking him further from what he wanted, which was to run right back down to Cas’ apartment and beg him for forgiveness, to be patient, to not give up on his disaster of a boyfriend while said boyfriend tried to figure out how to extract himself from the endlessly tangled web he’d woven.
“Absolutely,” Sam answered firmly, barely letting him finish the question. He met his gaze full on, face serious. “If he’s happy, I couldn’t care less. You know, he messed around a bunch with girls and stuff, but he never got serious with anyone and no one ever seemed to be serious about him either. But Gabe,” he leaned in entreatingly, “the way he talked about Cassie—Cas…I’ve never heard him like that about anyone. Ever. When he came back for spring break he was like a whole other person. So yeah, he fucked up big time, but I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say that I haven’t seen him that happy since before our mom died. Can you honestly tell me honestly that it wasn’t the same for Cas?”
The words, the casually cruel way that Gabriel lobbed them, stunned him.
“Wha—”
They reflexively grabbed the kitchen guns out of their hiding spots and met side-by-side in front of the prep station, their eyes scanning anxiously for clues.
The surge of heat and pressure in the back of his throat, stinging in his nose and behind his eyes said
On the days when he couldn’t, he would distract himself with Cas, stoking the ever-simmering heat between them until they were wild with it, let Cas take him to that place where everything else became muted and dull against the backdrop of the love they made between them.
But he couldn’t. If he said one more word he was going to lose it. Jack didn’t push for more, though, just swung around to trail after Dean aimless wandering down Main Street. Dean didn’t have to wonder too hard about if they were all thinking the same thing; it was clear they all were.
Luckily for him, the Caps scored and the cacophony of shouting by the commentators broke the moment and drew their attention towards the TV. Even though it was a goal for the other team, Dean was still grateful; Gabriel had been getting more direct with his looks and comments every week and Dean was starting to worry about what he might say next.
“Sam came to see me.”
“What the fuck is going on?” he growled, still looking for a threat. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sam’s face go slack with shock as he answered the call.
“‘Never tell me the odds’, Sammy.”
Gabriel could be a mischievous jackass at the best of times and a true lord of chaos at the worst, but he was at his core an older brother who had always fiercely defended his serious younger sibling against any and all trouble, even when it came from within their own family. He was also an unexpectedly sympathetic ear when it came to matters of the heart; Cas had always been careful not to tease him too much about how much of a hopeless romantic he was.
“You know, I wouldn’t have cared if you didn’t want to come out. If you didn’t want to tell your family about us, that would have been more difficult, but I think I would have understood,” Cas paused to take a deep shuddering breath, “I could have even lived with some subterfuge about us if that’s what you needed, but you actually made up a girlfriend to
The idea of telling Cas sat like a frozen rock in his gut, but the idea that Sam would look at him differently after suffused him head to foot in a boiling hot blanket of shame. And that was where the root of the problem lay: what he told Sam would be what could either cost him his little brother’s respect, or Cas’.
Fuck, he was tired. It wasn’t even so much bodily fatigue as he felt drained right down to the cellular level, like his very soul was running on fumes. It had been like that for a while, but he had always been able to bounce back from it before.
“So, what, we just leave the kid to fend for himself?”
,” he barked, emphasizing the rare use of Cas’ full name with a shake. “Snap out of it, would ya?”
He could practically see the thoughts play out across Sam’s face; good thing the kid had always stuck to hustling pool instead of poker.
“Ok,” Sam said, holding up a finger. “So, one, that makes a whole lot more sense now than your landlord just randomly chilling in your apartment reading his book while you take a shower,” he said with a little smile, then raised a second finger, turning serious again. “Two, what the actual fuck, Dean? Why didn’t you ever say anything?”
It would have taken some time back on Alistair’s rack to make Dean admit it aloud again, but Sam had been right to call him out. That drunk driving shit had been too far, even for him, and Dean wasn’t too proud to agree that he never would have forgiven himself if he had taken some poor soul out just because he couldn’t handle himself like a damn adult.
“So what’s the deal then?”
“Dean…”
Cas’ eyes snapped open and met his gaze fiercely in the mirror. “This was what we were going to talk about after your shower.” It wasn’t really a question, just a confirmation, but Dean nodded anyway.
to be a reasonable explanation for this. Right?”
He looked over to see if Gabe was still paying attention. He was, and being a big brother himself, he felt a renewed wave of sympathy for Dean.
Here there be canonical death - or at least what appears to be canonical, for any fellow tin-hatters who don't believe that what we saw in ep 20 actually happened! Dean's death is not described in any major detail for anyone who isn't ok with reliving it
But it wasn’t. Cas wasn’t there.
As it turned out, he was right.
He shot off a quick reply and opened up the next message from Sam, confusion creasing his brows as he read it.
Shame flushed him hot. He had had so much time, and he had wasted all of it in the warm waters of De Nile. He didn’t even have a plan for the most basic question Sam could ask him. He swallowed hard. “I honestly hadn’t thought that far. I…I don’t know.”
Muscles eventually shifted under his cheek as Cas pulled his head back to press a kiss to Dean’s cheek. The sweetness of the gesture made him ache more.
“I’m not leaving here without you. I know it’s your grace, but Cas…in the bunker, when you summoned the Empty, you said that the thing that you wanted was something you thought you couldn’t have.”
Sam sucked in a breath, absorbing the news like a physical blow.
There was that city-powering grin again, taking a decade off Sam’s face as he brightened.
It was all so painfully ordinary, like nothing had ever happened.
Still casting odd glances at Cas, Sam raised his voice to call down the hall. “Hope my room is ready for me, jerk!”
Holding up his hand to forestall the questions he knew Sam had been building up, he shook his head, carefully not making eye contact. If one ounce of the grief Sam had to be feeling about Eileen or any of it showed on his face, the face that in Dean’s mind was perpetually six, freckled and round with baby fat…yeah, that would crack his composure like an eggshell.
“Ugh!” Dean recoiled like Sam revealed he was boiling infants.
Dean hadn’t really had an idea what to expect when he got to Cas, but a resigned “Not this again,” definitely hadn’t been on his list.
Dean could feel Cas’ gaze on him, boring into the side of his head. “I know, and I still think that, but it’s
“Yeah, no,
time—”
“I can’t
I also try not to bounce around POVs too much when I'm writing, but in this chapter we get a brief switch to Sam's POV in the section that starts with "Dean was still chuckling" and carries through to the end of this chapter (in case it wasn't clear!)
The towel got rehung just so on the handle of the oven door, the corners all neatly matched up before Cas shrugged.
Puzzled now, Jack set a calming hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I never said you should.”
“Jesus fucking Christ!”
John’s hug was vague and a bit distant, much like the man himself, but Sam’s nearly cracked a rib, and Dean had to look up to meet his eyes when they pulled apart.
It echoed on repeat in the vast empty places inside of him, the spaces where other (normal) people had partners and kids, or family and friends that hadn’t died in myriad tragic, horrible ways… The spaces that had started to feel like maybe they wouldn’t be so empty with Sam, Cas, and Jack around him, Team Free Will two point oh turning the bunker into a real home.
“He was
Enjoy!
After doing the moving thing more than a few times, Dean considered himself a bit of a pro and by the time the overcast sky was fading into a murky sunset he had his furniture set up and all of his boxes unpacked.
“I need to talk to you. It’s important.”
“Were you, uh, ever gonna tell me? If you hadn’t had to?”
He had shared his idea with Dean not long after Dean cut out the drinking.
“Fuck,” he muttered. Then before he could put his foot any further into his mouth (or overthink things), he reached out and covered Cas’ hand with his.
“Hey,” he murmured after a couple of hard swallows of his own. “C’mere.”
“Don’t.”
“Dean?”
Dean crossed his arms and stared down the shorter man.
! Um, you know, it’s actually perfectly normal, especially as men start getting older—”
Dean took a step back, like Cas’ words had struck him a physical blow. His voice when he spoke was low and tortured-sounding.
“I mean, I don’t think I’ll give it up completely or anything, but…yeah, I think it’s time to take a step back, start figuring out if this is something that makes me happy.”
“Cas isn’t here.” Bobby said it gently but goddamn, it still hurt to hear it.
, kicking off in the depths of his damp eyes. “No. ’m fucking it all up, like I usually do. But…you’re right—”
Wearing light jeans and white shoes to match his jacket, hands clasped easily behind him like he was giving a presentation, Jack smiled at their shock. He was patient, fielding their questions, patting their backs only slightly awkwardly when they each got their brains back online and pulled him in for hugs.
The question seemed to only deepen Dean’s discomfort as his face twisted in…distress? Identifying human expressions still posed some difficulty for him, especially without the extra sense his grace used to provide.
here right now!”
“Blah, blah, blah,
I clean the kitchen.”
“Cas is gone,” he said finally, his words from the previous day still hard to say. He brought his cup up to his lips, needed his other hand to steady the sudden tremor.
“How can you be so sure?” God, Dean hated the ache in Cas’ voice. Cas was usually the positive one, all hopeful and upbeat and ready to take on the world. He should never sound so uncertain, and Dean knew it would take a long time to forgive himself for being the one to make Cas sound like that.
“I can’t feel him,” Jack replied vaguely, shaking his head as his eyes cleared and focused back on Dean, a little frown forming between his eyebrows. “That’s not right. I should be able to feel him, even if he’s resting.”
“If you—”
Sam settled down on the other side of the steps with his own cup, cradling it between his palms instead of drinking.
To Dean’s surprise, Cas was right; the scotch paired beautifully with the pie. And when Cas tugged him in for another kiss, it turned out that it all tasted even better on his lips. But Cas didn’t let him chase that flavour too deeply, pulling away after a few heart stopping seconds.
Handing over a twelve-pack of the Belgian beer that he knew Cas preferred, Dean snorted at Gabe but then immediately inhaled deeply as the smell of cooking meat drifted down the hall.
Sam had held off on telling him about the spells because he’d already been careening himself towards a cliff’s edge of self-destruction at a hundred miles an hour. If he’d made more of an effort to move forward, shown that he wasn’t going to be a danger to himself, literally done
Evading the question, Dean helped Cas sit up properly and shoved the empty vial under his nose. “We’ve got some catching up to do for sure, and I’ll give you the full rundown later, but you have a decision to make and I need you to make it quick before the Supreme Chancellor here changes its mind.”
Castiel looked up at him, his gaze flickering away briefly before he licked his lips, picking at the edge of the label. “We, uh, we usually watch the game together, Gabriel and I, if you, you know, wanted to join us for the season opener tomorrow.”
Dean smiled at the bittersweet memory. “You mean the one where I only found out after she died that she was actually a terrible cook and that the pies had always come from the bakery down the street?”
Cas wanted to tell his brother to dial it back, that they didn’t know for sure what was going on, that Dean loved him and wouldn’t have betrayed his trust like that.
The leather armchair next to the bed sighed gently as he plopped back down, unsettled for reasons he still didn’t feel like examining too closely. Heaving a sigh of his own, he noticed that his beer was empty, so he tried glaring at it. It refilled itself, just as crisp and cold and yeasty as the first sip of the previous one had been.
Dean was turning a dull, furious red, probably going for his tried-and-true strategy of lashing out with jagged-edged, hurtful (if slightly muffled) words that might wound Sam enough to get him to back off.
Gabriel barrelled on like he knew Cas was about to interrupt him, “He was wrong, but if you don’t come back here and at least give him a chance to explain everything, then I think you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.” His tone gentled. “He’s head over heels in love with you, you know. People do some crazy shit sometimes when they have something they’re so afraid of losing.”
Dean frowned as he helped her up. “I didn’t say anything.”
One of my favourite songs served as particular inspiration/writing music for this chapter:
“Ok. That’s…that’s good, then, I guess.”
“Jack?” Dean asked, and Sam nodded. “Well, if you can find those ingredients I’ll see about getting in touch with our wayward kid.”
, he thought, idly toying with a loose thread. Sam was due to arrive in a week and he knew that was going to change things. Both of them would have their brothers living with them; things like spontaneous sex in the kitchen would have to wait until Gabriel moved out and they could have Cas’ place to themselves.
Dean was in so much trouble.
Still, once the wheezing and the jelly legs went away, he didn’t feel
Cas broke the moment by letting the oven door slam closed. “Dinner’s served.”
He exhaled a shaky huff of a laugh. Here they were, two dead guys, one checking to make sure the other hadn’t stopped breathing the air that neither of them technically needed anymore.
. Like you have been almost every night for the last month.”
Offering his brother a smile to soften his words, Sam shook his head.
Quiet footsteps padded in from the deck. He had sent Cas out there with a giant cup of coffee to wake up at his own speed after remembering that depowered Cas was definitely
There was a sizzling sound behind them, then the pop and boom of the first firework. The colours lit up Cas’ face and glittered in his eyes as he smiled. It was small, still a bit fragile, but genuine.
Dean looked up from where he was slouched down against the arm of his couch, tablet braced against his updrawn knees. “You don’t say.”
Dean’s nose stung and he pressed his lips together tightly as he closed his eyes. He nodded, overwhelmed with gratitude. He had never loved his little brother more.
who perfectly captured the light-that-wasn't-really-light that I had imagined within the expanse of the Empty!
“Somehow I don’t doubt that,” he said finally, realizing he had been busy looking at Castiel’s shirt and grinning to himself like an idiot. “So, uh, listen, I'm making pizza for dinner. I’ve never allowed pineapple on it before, but if you want to stay for a slice and make your case, I’ll at least hear you out.”
“Without his grace—”
And finally, my favourite scene in this whole story, beautifully illustrated by my Pinefest partner
When Sam sighed, Dean knew he’d agreed to play along. For now, at least.
“Well, that was…quick.”
Cas’ lips parted in a soundless
While the kitchen still had what looked like its original cabinets, they’d been repainted and gifted new hardware, and a new countertop had been installed. He nearly salivated at the sight of all of that real estate and briefly allowed himself to imagine the luxury of cooking with all that
By the time Gabriel realized the coast was clear and appeared in the doorway, Cas already had a duffel bag open on the bed.
“No, shut up, I know what you’re going to say.” Sam’s face was painfully earnest, his eyes all but begging Dean to listen, and damn but the kid was persuasive when he wanted to be.
unique, though. Other angels have fallen or been cast out, relinquished their grace or had it taken from them, but he’s the only angel that I’ve come across who has begun to develop a soul.”
“Mmhmm?”
“You’re back,” Sam said, stating the obvious with a little upward lilt at the end, a not-so-subtle bid for Dean to explain what the hell was going on.
, and Dean finally had time to tell him—
Cas’ eyes were a little predatory when he pulled away. “Oh, you can count on it.”
“I’ll be alright,” he said gently now, knowing that was Dean’s biggest fear. “I promise, I’ll be alright.”
They could work on mastering the art of the cuddle another time, he reminded himself, looking back toward the fire. Hell, they had eternity to get better at this whole thing, to get it right.
He’d been toying with the idea that he might not be as straight as he’d always assumed he was for a while, and the anonymity of a club in a city well away from where he lived seemed like a good place to confirm that hypothesis. The Village in Montreal was full of hotspots, so after wandering up and down the strip a few times, he made a choice and walked up to the entry of one of the clubs.
Dean glared at him. “I swear, if you dinged Baby again—”
Filling his hands with the firm mounds of Cas’ ass (a goddamn national treasure as far as Dean was concerned), Dean nuzzled into the thick hair behind his ear and grinned against the soft skin under his lips.
you, he told you so himself, and even though you might never admit it to yourself, you loved him like that, too. Is this how you’re going to honour what he did?
It seemed like he’d guessed right, that it was the master bedroom, a private bathroom visible through a door on Cas’ far side. Instead of closets, on the wall to either side of the big fireplace across from the bed, there was a cheerfully mismatched pair of tall wardrobes that looked like they had come straight out of the nineteenth century.
Finally, silence.
“What kind of stuff?” he prompted carefully.
“If things were the other way around you know Cas would be dismantling the universe one atom at a time if he thought there was a chance to get you out.”
“Jack, I’m sorry.” He meant to say more, to tell Jack how brave Cas had been, that he seemed to have been at peace with his decision; that he was a hero, that he hadn’t suffered.
That ended up being his first kiss with another guy, the tang of smoke still on his tongue. It hadn’t been a great kiss—too much tongue and not particularly skilled on Cory’s part—but it served to settle one more piece of his sexuality puzzle into place.**
, ok? He beckoned to a hesitant Cas, the drape of the blanket waving in the wake of his motion like a gently flapping plaid wing.
his damn charger cable? He closed his eyes briefly and sighed; it was upstairs at Dean’s place, dangling from the plug on his side of the bed. Fuck.
Sighing, Gabriel came closer, arms lifting. “Alright. Call me when you get there.”
Sam’s eyes were mostly blank as his attention turned within, listening to whatever the agitated voice on the phone was saying, then he all but knocked Dean over as he bolted for the garage.
That now familiar weight of Cas’ body, so grounding and reassuring, convinced Dean to throw Cas a bone since, after all, it
The dark stress flush was starting to fade but Cas’ cheeks were still bright red and it was so friggin’ endearing, especially when he grinned shyly at Dean.
A restless wind had kicked up, whipping branches in the trees back and forth in an echo of Dean’s own churning insides. He looked around, eyeing the massing dark clouds in the distance. Thunder rumbled threateningly.
“Here,” Jack offered, extending a hand but not coming any closer, like he sensed how close Dean was to grabbing Cas and hauling ass. “Let me take you both inside. We’ll get him settled, and I’ll explain.”
The bag rustled as Cas very carefully set it on the counter. He held onto the handles, took a deep breath, and looked up at Dean.
This time, though, he had tried to be smart about it. Instead of taking a regular apartment with units to either side, across the hall, above and below, he had bugged Bobby for a long overdue pay raise and was hoping to splurge on the upper floor of a tidy little duplex not too far from Montreal’s Rosemont/La Petite-Patrie neighbourhood. It was an area in transition between its aging mostly Italian-immigrant population and young couples and families wanting to be near the city and trying to find a compromise between Montreal’s pervasive condos and unaffordable single family homes.
