John looked at the young alpha, at his trembling arms, his watery eyes. He looked vulnerable and scared.
Sherrinford adjusted the sleeves of the shirt he’d had on since yesterday. “I swear to you, Mycroft, I didn’t know. She…”
“Who were you wanting to see?” John shifted his own file under his arm. “I could check if they want a visitor.”
“It’s Christmas,” John rubbed his eyes. “It makes you tired. Food and central heating and expectation.”
“You need to take that binder off,” Mycroft said, without looking up from his laptop, as Sherlock came into the sitting room. “You’ve had it on all day.”
Sherlock’s face was shining with longing. He looked back at the book he held, and turned a few more pages, coming to some illustrations of crabs. He tapped the picture, and said something before looking at John.
“Slow is perfect,” John smiled, kissing Sherlock on the forehead. “Now, let me change that dressing?”
“…you want this, you do, you’ve given it up to me, you’ve done this to me, Sherlock, you’ve made me like this, you see? You made this happen, you did it to me…”
John pushed the tight jeans down, over the perfect globe of Sherlock’s arse, squeezing the muscle through his black boxer-briefs, dragging two fingers in the cleft, making Sherlock shudder and put his hands on John’s hair.
John moved his hand from Sherlock’s lips, round to his hair, cupping the back of his head gently as their mouths came together.
“Don’t give me any shit about it not being bad,” John snapped. “I know it is. And I know it’s ugly. Just…”
“Home…” Sherlock looked back at the telephone. It was now free, and Sherlock snatched at it, dialling the number for Mrs Hudson’s flat, plus the reverse charge number.
,” he said softly. “For being me. Sherlock Holmes. Not as an omega boy. Man. I want someone to choose
Mycroft grabbed a waste-paper basket and got it onto Sherlock lap just in time for him to heave into. He wasn’t sick, but the impulse was there for a minute or two, before he could talk again.
But he still kept his desire to become a doctor secret from everyone except Mrs Rivers, who had her set of twins, and promptly became pregnant with another baby. John was slightly squicked out at the speed at which his Form Tutor was producing children, but he was comforted by the fact that she continued to teach, and was very good at it.
John looked at the bed again. “Just… shit, can you get…” John got off Sherlock, who moved to cover any awkwardness as John lay half on his side, half on his back, beckoning with a hand before Sherlock covered him, his inner alpha crowing in delight as getting to cover this omega. But the omega smelled of pregnancy, and that was wrong because Sherlock hadn’t knotted him. And
John went inside to get his pen-knife, and Sherlock spread himself out on the picnic blanket on the grass, and looked at the sky.
They took their places in Chemistry, and John resumed his meticulous note-taking, as Sherlock resumed his annoying habit of answering every question before it had barely left the teacher’s mouth.
Thin fingers got him around the wrist, and pulled. Sherlock gave a sort of giggle, and John giggled back.
“I don’t need to,” Sherlock said thickly. “I know why you did… what you did. I – I can’t say sorry for what happened with me and – and Victor, because I’m not sorry, though.”
“That’s fine. I’m in no rush to get home.” Sherlock watched John’s face go through a series of quick emotions, like flicking through the pages of a book, before settling on understanding. If it was false, he was a terrific actor. “Is there any chance you could take me outside? Just for a cigarette.”
!’ John said quickly. For a while second he wondered if this was it – if they were going to kiss hard against the fence, change their minds and be together no matter the distance, but he knew, a second later, that that wouldn’t be the case. ‘Are you going to be ok?’
“You’re worried,” Sherlock said, looking up from his phone as John came into the room. “And your arm hurts,” he added.
to me, even though I’ve told you what Eurus is like. What she did to me, what she did to us. She made me believe that omegas are terrible. She made me believe you were manipulating me. Do you understand how difficult it has been to try and train myself out of thinking like that?”
“Sorry,” Sherlock said quickly, then realised the alpha was joking. “Oh… Well, Mummy and Father wanted me to be, you know, proper. In all ways. They never really said that I’d be coming to
"It will break once he wakes up. It's like going into a coma. How insulting. To think I would need to do that to get
To Sherlock’s annoyance, it was in use, so he folded his arms and looked about the place, trying not to look like the only customer not giving custom, or nursing an enormous mug of overpriced coffee.
After vampires had made themselves known to be more fact than fiction, the whole concept of Death had been brought into question numerous times. Vampires had no need to respire, no heartbeat, no necessary excretory system. They ate, and had electrical activity in their brains. But lacked the other requirements for being alive. They couldn't even reproduce without a 'host', so to speak - their entire biology was baffling.
“Did you want me to? I was just saying to John I think we can sort something out for him. That’s why I’m here.”
Sherlock stared at the man, then shrugged. "Because I'll be gone soon, I suppose. I suppose once every five hundred years it's all right if someone knows a little about me."
John pressed his lips together, hard. Sherlock watched the motion, a soft ache in his chest at the sight of the doctor’s mouth betraying his feelings. He resisted the urge to copy the motion, to mirror it, as if he would be feeling the sensation of John’s mouth first-hand.
John limped around the manor with his cane, on the days he felt well enough to leave his room. The manor wasn’t as sprawling as it first seemed, and the rooms were laid out easily enough for John to learn his way around. The most difficult thing to navigate was the large central staircase, which curved, and was John’s only way downstairs.
John didn’t need telling twice. He darted out of the open door, down the steps to the car, and leaned against it, catching his breath, shaking.
“It’s alright, dear,” the nurse said. “You don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with. I know it’s difficult.”
Sherlock tried to ignore the way John stroked his gun, but it was useless. Distracting. He looked at the man with a bland face. "Would it comfort you to know that while your bullets won't kill me, they do still hurt. I could feel the impact, but it doesn't penetrate. Doesn't hurt as badly as it would someone else, though. And it wouldn’t slow me down.”
“Ah…” John leaned against him, nuzzling his nose into the crook of Sherlock’s neck, resting his hands, broad and open, on Sherlock’s back. “God, this is nice…”
“Health and safety. What you choose to do on consulting cases with Sherlock is your own business, and we’ll keep paying you for it, but we can’t have you dealing with drunks and violent alphas in your condition.”
“That’s the basics,” the alpha soldier barked. “Now, if you’d like to help youselves to a drink, myself, Captain Crossland – ”
“Mmf,” Sherlock snuggled into his pillow, and turned over, giving John the chance to be the big spoon, and hold him close. Sherlock tensed for a moment, then relaxed, remembering. “M’ning…”
Sherlock shrugged. “I don’t think I have a lot of options. Mycroft is arranging for someone to… access my things in Victor’s house. He’s going to take them to Baker Street.”
Sherlock woke before his alarm went off, and stared at the grey light filtering through the curtains. He felt tired, and wrung-out, and so ready to roll back over and sleep for ever. No more worry, no more angst, no more fear, or disgust with himself… It would be so peaceful.
“John, no,” Sherlock stood, and came around to face him. “John, I didn’t mean… I’m familiar because I’ve experienced it. I haven’t. I meant I’ve done research. Read up. On what to do.”
“Don’t be. It’s not your fault.” John pulled his t-shirt down, and looked at himself in the mirror with a smirk. “Right, I’m coming out.”
Lestrade pushed his fingers into his head as if fighting off a migraine. "Don't tell me that. If you actually kill someone-"
“Without being a bit presumptuous, you’d think they’d have measures in place to deal with this sort of thing already,” John sighed.
He crossed the road, and went into the chain pharmacy, trying not to look like some wanton omega who shagged anyone during a heat. What was the point, though? They were going to think that anyway.
Sherlock’s breath was already catching, in anticipation, but it turned ragged as John gripped the base of his cock and pushed his lips over that rosy head.
The woman looked nonplussed as he slammed his way out of the door, shaking, feeling as though everyone in the word was watching and knew what had happened in that tiny showroom.
“You need to feed,” Sherlock said. “It won’t be unpleasant, I promise you, it’s simply a matter of getting your head around it, and then… it’s natural.”
Sherlock shook his head, sticking an absorbent pad to his underwear and pulling them up high to hide the crackling noise before he put his pyjama bottoms on. The bleeding was still coming, in thick strings of clot that were disgusting to look at. He’d had to run to the toilet, and a great mess had fallen from his insides, making him silently panic. He’d taken out his phone and immediately searched for the reason why this was happening.
John looked happy, but also guilty, as if he shouldn't be happy about such a small thing. He reached his hand to rest casually at Sherlock's elbow as the man finished his text.
“You play the violin?” John asked in delighted surprise. Omegas were expected to have an artistic hobby, but instruments were expensive.
“You should be careful,” Sherlock snapped. “Greg might be with…” he glanced about, “someone else, but he’s an unbonded alpha, and you know what sort of effect you’ll have on him.”
“How would you feel about doing a bit more on-call in the community? The police are always looking for doctors to verify deaths and so on?”
Only to return when Sherlock was halfway down the second page. A sudden burst of temperature hitting his face and neck, rushing down his chest. His empty stomach rolled, and he scrunched up his scrap paper in his fist.
“God… god… John…” Sherlock was trembling, his erection throbbing on his stomach, unable to find release, because John just wasn’t experienced enough to angle his cock right to get his prostate.
“You don’t need to apologise,” John said. “It was… what I needed at the time. I didn’t tell you ‘no’. I wanted that closeness. And honestly I’m glad you were there.” He stood, and picked up his plate. “I might have done something stupid, otherwise.”
John thought about denying it, but what was the point. ‘Yeah. We’ve got a year before I go, so we need to make the most of it. Going out and stuff, I mean.’
The nurse nodded, and took the cuff from him. “Right, that’s all done. If you go through the doors, your doctor will see you now.”
“You’re the most special person I’ve ever known,” Sherlock said, looking down at John. “You really are. I’m so lucky to have you here, in my arms.”
“No. Yeah. I told them he was scenting me. But… he was so heavy, and I was so small, and I could feel… everything.” John wiped his eyes, angrily. “Sometimes, I still can.”
“I’d rather have you on the books than someone who’d going to… I don’t know, go off on maternity leave after a year, or something,” the detective inspector laughed.
Mycroft set his tea down. “Any photographs of Sherlock taken before last year are put away, as he has requested. I don’t think he would be at all happy to know you’ve made a request to see them.”
Years ago, John would have had a breakdown. Might have screamed, been sick, collapsed in fear and horror at the unsolicited touch. He would have let the memories of Siger Holmes’ voice bubble to the surface and take him under, drowning him in the past.
Sherlock took his hands again. “John… My John… I… I do promise. I will sort this, I swear. I want you… Both of you. I’ll…”
Mycroft looked at him, for a moment, then pointed at one of the boys in the picture. He looked around seventeen, was short, had longish hair, a cute face, and thin arms and legs. He also carried a hockey stick. “What gender do you suppose this boy is?”
Sherlock’s head suddenly hurt, and he handed the pencil back to John as he pressed his temples. The implications of this were too much.
The doctor nodded, musing to himself. “If I’m going to recommend you as a pass, John, you need to switch onto the military-issued shot. That means, you’ll have to stop taking the pill you’re on. Have a heat, naturally, and then come back for your jab before you get the bus to Catterick.”
“My alpha,” Sherlock sighed, arching his back, craning his neck, exposing where John had to bite – right atop those old scars. “Bond with me.”
“Here you go, then,” Victor indicated Lucy. Sherlock picked her up, and the sudden scent of her alpha made her press her little face against his shirt and try to burrow in. “She knows her dad,” Victor smiled. He stood, and flexed his arm, getting the blood back into it. He came over to Sherlock, and looked at him, something undefinable in his eyes as he looked at his old flame, baby in his arms. “Suits you, Sherlock.”
Sholto nodded, and sat up and away. “Sorry.” He puffed out a breath, and John thanked his lucky stars neither of them were mature, yet. “Can I ask… If you weren’t engaged…?”
He went out into the car park, where there were a couple dozen lads hanging about, some waiting, some off the bus from its previous pick-up, having a breather. John handed his papers and his bag to an officer, who saluted him, and John faltered before saluting back – he was a soldier, now. Of course. A doctor, later. A soldier, now. The bag was stowed away, and John tried not to feel too alone as he stood beside the group of young, mostly alpha men.
John could feel murderous thoughts coming from the alphas either side of him as he tried to process the question. “I don’t understand.”
They’d gone a bit further with one another in the days since the university bombshell had dropped, as if they could override the universe simply by making love to one another. There was an ease to what they did, now, verbal consent giving way to simply
“You think I’ll break his heart… again?” John asked, his throat on fire, his chest in a vice. “He… he broke mine! The letters –”
John glanced back and had to smile. “I guess you probably have.” He gripped the edge of the bed, then, hanging on as the wound was cleaned up. He tried to put the pain to the back of his mind, and shut his eyes. He thought about Sherlock. Coming to see him, as soon as he heard. Those gentle kisses... John’s heart gave a throb.
John dragged a hand over his face. “The more I think about it, I don’t think he actually believed I would. Or… me leaving hurt him more than it hurt me. And it hurt me a lot. I used to… wake up crying in my bunk, because my mate wasn’t close. I used to get the shakes, and couldn’t eat, because I was alone, and I shouldn’t be. I got over it, but it took months, years. Maybe Sherlock couldn’t get over it. Maybe he doesn’t know how to cope with being alone. Is that what bonds are like, for alphas?”
John glanced at the side-table. There was a bottle of water on it, thank god. He leaned a hand on the table to reach the bottle.
She waved a hand. “I’m not about to start questioning you about the ins and outs. Rather, I’m pleased to hear Sherlock is actually attending classes this year.”
John caught himself on the edge of the bed, the mattress tearing under his grip, the bedframe squeaking as he held it tight.
John swallowed hard, throat dry, limbs trembling. His heart was thundering in his chest. He opened his eyes and nearly screamed at the sight of two red ones staring back at him, before he remembered. "Oh, shit," he clamped a hand to his chest. "Shit, fuck. Sorry." He stood straighter. "Sorry... about that." Embarrassment began to creep through him, along with the dissipating fear, and shame.
John walked out, at a normal pace, trying to stay calm as he passed the alpha, until he got out of the kitchen door.
Sherlock looked back at the river. “I’m glad. I… I want to do what I can to make the past few years up to you. I know… when I left, it wasn’t easy. And then it was awful. You – you’ve been so brave, John. And so resilient. And you’ve shown me what sort of a person I want to be. And…” he took John’s pizza out of his hand, and gently held his fingers. “And, John… I know things haven’t been easy. And I know that without… my family… we never would have met. But I’m so glad we did. I know that we still do not know one another as well as we ought, but I so want to know you. Everything there is to know. And…”
“It’s not that simple,” Sherlock said quietly. “My family… there are three of us, children. My eldest brother is a beta. The middle one, alpha. And then me.”
Two days later, he passed his first exam with flying colours, and Mr Thorne gave him an excellent Christmas present – a Baccalaureate application form.
“Already seen the photos,” John shrugged. “Serrated blade, but a short one. Probably part of a Swiss Army knife. Could be dismantled or re-assembled.”
“This is a bit small,” Sherlock held the door open, hunching back as John passed, as if he was afraid of touching, “but the other spare bedroom is on the top floor, and I thought if you needed something in the night…”
“There’s not a lot you can take without a doctor’s prescription,” Victor said. He took a box off the shelf behind him. “These are pretty good, but you’ll have to take ibuprofen in-between them, too. Are you doing that?”
“Well, I brought you this,” Sherlock held out the cup marked ‘decaf’. “And to tell you… I’m… no longer in a relationship.”
“It’s New Year’s Eve,” John said. The Holmes Brothers exchanged glances. “Don’t you do anything for New Year’s?”
John swallowed. There was a single blood bag left in the fridge. Keeping one eye on Sherlock, he quickly went and got it, and emptied the cold red contents into a bowl, and grabbed – for want of anything else – the roll of paper kitchen towel.
But the biggest change came when school started again in January, and Sherlock went to a new school.
“I don’t even want children,” John said. “What is this? I…” he threw the papers down. “I’m going to uni. I’m going to be a doctor. Ok? I’m doing it.”
“Well, I didn’t want to make everyone jealous by going about entirely nude.” John spread his towel onto a deckchair and sat back onto it. “It’s warm.”
“You want emotional highs, Sherlock,” Mycroft stood, and Sherlock’s inner omega quailed in fright, though he tried not to show it. “That is all. You are being completely selfish.”
"It can hardly be called a war if the people you were murdering weren't able to fight back, but as you please. You admit to all the charges?"
“Hm.” John put his phone back on the bedside table. Lestrade? A likely story. It was the weekend, for one. And Lestrade didn’t work late nights or early mornings unless he was mid-way through a case.
“Stop being lewd. We’re here, anyway,” Mycroft stepped out, and John and Sherlock followed, the latter smirking to himself. They were greeted by a receptionist, and then shown into a room with one large table and several chairs, where they were quickly joined by two beta women, who put a lot of files on the table.
“Indeed. And no, I have to have dinner with the PM. I’m leaving you and John to fend for yourselves.”
Sherlock pulled the saddest face. “John… I never stopped loving you. I merely forced myself not to think of you, because of the pain it caused me.”
“Thank you. It is extremely likely that high stress, injury, or illness will make an omega go into heat. Now, stress-heats are not the same as a normal cycle heat. For starters, the chances of conception are incredibly low, even if the omega is knotted –”
John took the letter from the mantelpiece and sat down to read it, yet again. He lifted a slice of breakfast toast up as he looked over the words, now pretty much known off by heart.
“It’s true, though.” Sherlock crossed his ankles on the bed. He held a hand out. “Hand it over, then.”
It’s enough for John to settle between, close enough to be flush with one another, and face to face as their cocks slot together in heat.
“So you should be,” Sherlock opened his arms, and John snuggled up close, breathing in Sherlock’s scent, his warmth, his honesty. “I would be, too. I never… I took it for granted. What I had. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock clicked the light off, and headed out, and for the stairs. He took them two at a time, as always, enjoying the semi-freedom of his parents being out of the country (missing his first day, typically), and thundered into the kitchen to grab his school bag.
Swearing like a trooper, Sherlock climbed onto the sinks, opening the tiny window close to the ceiling. He could just about squeeze through, if he broke the latch. He shoved it, hard, and the latch gave way suddenly. Sherlock scraped his forearm on the window ledge, drawing blood, but climbed out of the window and dropped to the ground, rolling over in the flowerbed as he tried to stand.
Sherlock felt every touch, every press, every squeeze. He heard himself plead with Magnussen to be gentle with him, he heard himself gasp in pain and fright, he heard the low rumble of Magnussen’s voice ordering him to
“Perhaps once it’s broken,” Sherlock grinned, flashing white teeth, and John wondered what he meant. “What year are you in at school, then?”
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose. “He called me just after noon. He was in considerable distress. I’m afraid he hasn’t been answering his phone since.”
“For my behaviour, last week,” Sherlock clarified. “I… I should have said something. It’s just…. I wasn’t expecting…”
“I don’t necessarily mean this incident,” Mycroft said gently. “The doctors who treated you mentioned the other wounds and marks on your body. How long has that been going on?”
Sherlock arched his back, and there was a moment of fumbling with their legs before the soft trousers were kicked off completely, and they were both naked, both looking at one another, both trembling with need.
“Mm,” Sherlock agreed, putting the pictures down. “Yes, that is the most important thing…” he sipped at his coffee.
“Sit down,” John pushed his shoulders until his knees gave way. “You want to scent the baby, but he needs help, first. Let them look after him. The last thing your son needs is an angry alpha storming into his nursery.”
His deep-down primal instinct was to get as far away from the dead body as possible. Vampires did not like to be around dead things, particularly when they hadn’t been the ones to kill them. Sherlock’s skin was itching from the proximity of another vampire’s kill, as much as he didn’t want to move away from John. It was making him confused.
John took the booklet, and saw photos of hockey, rugby and football teams, all with boys of varying heights and statures in their line-ups. “That’s… great…” he frowned.
“Hm? Oh, very funny. Your wit never ceases to amaze me,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You know where I stand on that, Stamford. I’m bonded to my work.”
“Ah.” Cam sat back in his swivel chair. “A competitive field. Fields. Although, I understand there are scholarships, if one is willing to combine the two.”
He wondered if it was possible to actually die from a lack of sleep. Jealousy curled under his skin, suddenly – Sherlock had spent the past week going home at night, and he looked much better for it. John hadn’t had a full night’s sleep for a month. He doubted very much that things would change when they were all home. Sherlock couldn’t feed Lucy, and he was unlikely to bring John a drink of water when the feeding-thirsts gripped his throat in the middle of the night.
Later, John would think to himself that it had been like watching Sherlock deflate like a balloon. Not into nothing at all, but enough for his shoulders to sag and his smiles to become strained.
John took a breath, and gripped the base of Sherlock’s cock, feeling the lump-like swelling at the base that would expand into a knot before too long. The omega went up onto his knees, and shuffled forward, making his intentions quite clear. His heart was hammering, and he was trembling with nerves, but he needed this. He wanted it, so badly slick was trickling from his insides, a drip running down the back of one of his thighs.
John didn’t dare say ‘yes’ when he was stuck next to the eldest Holmes on the sofa. He just stared, helplessly.
“Forgetting your mobile was stupidly irresponsible,” Mycroft countered, his own alpha instincts making him defensive. “Witnesses on the street reported you as helping an omega, but there was no need for you to accompany her and her mate to the hospital.”
“You can never know when there’s twats about,” Greg said. He looked John over. “Erm…” He took off his jacket and held it out. “Tie it round your waist. I’ll take you home in the car.”
“Not just a disgrace to the idea of an alpha, but a liar, too,” Siger seethed. “Eurus. Get up. Now.”
John nodded again, taking the leaflets he was offered. He left them on the table for Sherlock to find later that night.
Sherlock bent down, and kissed him. It tasted of coffee and tiredness, but it was as welcome as anything else.
“I know you don’t need to see,” Sherlock said. “But I want you to. This… is the last time I’m going to look like this. And you’ve never seen.” His mouth twitched. “The incident, aside.” He held the gown together, with a hand.
John watched Sherlock take a croissant with almonds and sugar on the top, and copied him. “Why were you upset?”
Sherlock opened his eyes, looking away. John could see they were shining with barely held-back tears.
"A cup of leaf-water hardly constitutes a treat..." Sherlock muttered darkly as they locked up the medical bay and walked across to the mess.
Sherlock looked up. His face looked paler and more washed-out that ever. “It… wasn’t a good day. My parents… were just interested in themselves.”
John folded his arms. “I’m not going to ask him any of that, don’t be weird. And I don’t know. I can’t smell anything, yet.” He tightened the lace of his boot to his sudden embarrassment over not yet being mature. Funny, it had never bothered him until that moment.
John staggered up, opening the landing window as he passed it, dragging himself along the wall into his bedroom (open the window) and bathroom (and that one, too), running the cold tap and sticking his mouth under it, drinking until he felt sick and had to sit on the toilet lid, catching his breath.
John shook his head. “Let’s do this another time, shall we?” he indicated the ambulance, and the two alphas climbed inside, both rushing to the sobbing woman’s side as the doors slammed shut.
“Uh….” John huffed out a breath, tingles and goose-pimples running over his skin, gathering where his bum met his thighs, making his joints ache as Sherlock touched at his erection, still covered by his underpants. John swallowed hard, Sherlock touching gently at the hot hardness, feeling the width, the length.
“You don’t get to fucking touch me,” John snarled, omega defensiveness pouring off him as he bared his teeth. “You do not. You keep your fucking hand and nose to yourself, do you understand me?”
“I know, but…” Sherlock took a deep breath, “I’m going to try. My hardest. If you… If you don’t want…”
“Please,” Sherlock nodded, letting John slide them both down, Sherlock straddling the alpha’s legs with his hips splayed wide, arse open wantonly for John to play with as the omega thrust in shivered little motions against the alpha’s cock.
“Well, I am,” Sherlock brushed a pile of snow onto the ground. “The world does not need Sherlock Holmes. It never has.”
“I said before, and I meant it – I’m not going to force you to be with me. I don’t want you to feel like you have to be because of this,” John put a hand to his stomach. “If you don’t…”
He closed the book, and put it under his pillow when his dorm-mates came in that night. They were still giggling about the lesson that day, and Sherlock listened to them, cradling the knowledge he had, and no one else did.
“Watson-Holmes?” Sherlock asked, after John read out the draft of the letter he’d sent to Sherrinford. “You never changed your name.”
“I’ve heard they like an urban myth,” James, an alpha boy shrugged. “Everyone says they know someone who knows one, but they’re not real?”
John stood open-mouthed in the hallway. “Oh, you git,” he made a fist. “You absolute git. I’m going to fucking
‘Sherlock, you’re carrying her around in a sling. You never stop talking about her. You – you’re being a dad. And that’s not a bad thing!’ Lestrade held his hands up. ‘It’s not! It’s admirable. Not every alpha would do what you’re doing. I’m… in awe.’
Sherlock looked over the body. Throat torn, already stopped bleeding. Broken neck, cause of death. Muscular degeneration of limbs and organs some time before death. Adult male, white, aged… thirty-four?
John had hold of Lestrade, had him against the wall, red eyes blazing, mouth open wide enough to tear the man’s throat out.
“Fun?” John had snorted from the back of the car. Lestrade was driving them down, along with Molly and her new boyfriend, who was sitting in the passenger seat and kept glancing backwards as though worried Molly (who was in the middle seat between Sherlock and John) was going to disappear at any moment.
“But I want to get over it,” John said. “When I was younger… I thought you’d be the first one to do that. And you weren’t. I’m sorry.”
“-of my business, I get it,” John sighed. “But what happened to Sherlock? Mycroft, he’s my mate. I love him. I can’t stop loving him. I wrote to him every week for nearly six years. Not that he knew that, apparently. What happened to him?”
Mycroft worked from home the next day, temporarily enrolling John in an online school to fill his day with something more productive than television.
“You will struggle to find any institution that accepts a bonded omega, even without this order,” the solicitor drawled, sitting back in his ergonomic chair. “The drop-out rate for pregnancy would be too high, plus all the time off you need for your… heats.”
After a year of having an omega in his flat and having neither bitten nor mounted him, John’s sexuality was starting to feel rather raw.
On the way there, sherlock’s stomach tensed and cramped so horribly he had to run to the bathroom as soon as he got to the house. He felt nervous beyond belief, and his hands and feet felt cold all the time. He knew he did not want to give Cam any encouraging signals again, and yet by acting like a proper omega should (as he learnt at school), he only served to make himself appear more attractive. It was like walking a tightrope.
John pushed his chair back. “I’m teaching at St Bart’s hospital, this evening. Come over around seven, and I’ll see what I can do for you.”
Sherlock broke their kiss, and knelt up to shrug off his top, whilst John did the same, wriggling on the mattress as he yanked his top up and off, tossing it onto the floor before Sherlock settled back over him, the duvet over his shoulders as their kisses resumed, soft caresses over lips, teeth grazing as Sherlock tasted the omega he loved, before they came together with deeper exploration, tongues pressing and meeting in touches that sent sharp flecks of electricity down John’s body.
Sherlock was hunched over his experiment, pretending to take notes on the sample’s progress. When really, he was watching the other students. And their panic. Their disorganisation. Several students were giving up and putting their samples in the sterile chamber already. They would score 2:2s. Sherlock rolled his eyes, and made a tiny note on the development of his own petri dish. The sample bubbled and crusted at the edges, as predicted. Sherlock had run this experiment before, but the results always seemed to depend on –
“I meant it,” Sherlock said quickly. “This… isn’t like the movies. We can’t just… kiss and make up.”
“I mean… once it started properly,” Sherlock winced. He looked back at the alpha, hands gripping the leather sofa cushions. “Would you… want me?”
John wasn’t exempt from the nerves. He gave himself a good check-over in the shower every day, and one night when he woke up in a state he was unused to, nearly squealed as he checked nothing else had happened to him.
The kiss broke then, John panting for breath as Sherlock’s red eyes – darkening with lust – looked over him, checking for consent, for denial…
“Naturally,” Greg smiled, watching the pregnant omega hand the samples to a waiting officer, put a hand to his back and puff out a breath. “He looks well.”
Luckily, Sherlock moved quickly, and John could hear him stripping off in the bathroom, clattering around even as John threw himself into their bedroom, and started yanking his clothes off.
“No one said you were!” John gasped. “Haven’t I been good to you? Haven’t I taken enough care of you?”
John just looked down at Sherlock’s pale hands wrapped around his own, slightly more tanned, smaller ones. Everything felt as if it was balanced on a knife-edge. Their relationship. The day. The baby’s life.
does,” John said. “If we bond, I stop being me, I can’t decide my own medical treatment or tell what secrets I think need telling. It’s not fair!”
“No, and Christ, I’m glad you didn’t. I’d never say I regret that – I’m not an idiot. Just let me say what I need to say!”
“That’s what really bothers me,” Sherlock said again. He opened the passenger side door. “Are you coming?”
Sherlock walked in, and looked around for a moment, before sitting down on the bed. “This is different.”
“I don’t…” John paused. “I don’t know. He… He won’t wake up, and his eyes were all staring, before I stopped him.”
John concentrated on the road as they drove towards the temporary barracks. The dust kicked up, and the tyres bocketed over stones, and just keeping control of the wheel made John's shoulders ache slightly, his arms shaking with the vibrations travelling up through the vehicle. It meant you had to pay attention.
“Oh!” Sherlock let his head fall forward, his leg slipping in John’s grip. “Oh, that’s… Ah.” He blew air through his lips, trying to relax.
He washed quickly, getting out and wrapping a towel around his waist before opening his suitcase and bag. He sighed at the contents. Clothes, one pair of non-boot shoes, and a bundle of returned letters.
Life, it seems, is what happens when you realise you have found what you did not realise you were looking for.
“Sounds it,” Lestrade said kindly. He looked Sherlock over, taking in his unbroken neck-skin, his youth and vulnerability. “Now… you understand I can’t leave you here?”
“Oh, yes. The whole servitude angle, the concept of education… it’s all there. Of course, some of it was a positive influence, but I think you would have something to say if your parents pulled you out of school, wouldn’t you?”
Sherlock’s mouth set into a grim line. “I see Mycroft missed out that part. That’s… why I ended up staying with him. So he could watch me. I didn’t want to do it. Because I knew it might kill you, too.”
“They didn’t tell us about that,” John said. “Maybe that’ll be next time. But… so what if you’ll want a mate?”
“What is it? Are you ill?” Sherlock looked him up and down, and for a moment John feared he would be deduced just like Sherlock deduced everyone else around him.
Sherlock found himself wishing his brother was with them, as they parked at the front of the large house. Mycroft was as good as he was at seeing things. And this house had a lot to see.
“You can sort something between yourselves,” John said kindly. “You can use your own phone, later today?”
John picked up a piece of broken glass, and quickly slit the pad of his thumb with it, deciding to worry about infection later.
Mycroft pressed his lips together for a moment. “You… you are aware that the terms of your engagement forbid you from Higher Ed?”
“Thanks,” John ducked under the tape that was held up for him, and walked steadily across the scene as though he did this every day.
“Yeah well, I don’t have to do a lot of things,” John parroted, and perched on the edge of the table. He let a few long seconds pass. “So, what’s the plan?”
Omega slick was gently running down John’s arse, and he reached quickly, soaking his fingers before gripping both of their erections together, and lubricating their frottage with his own slick.
“Your letters to Sherlock didn’t get delivered to him through no action of mine until three years ago,” Mycroft snarled bracing an arm across John’s chest to try and escape. “Three years, John. Three years of Sherlock being
Particularly now John had let go of his wrists and was now kissing Sherlock’s thighs firmly, moving up to his crotch.
John’s visits. Meals. The endless dispensing of drugs. The empty-mindedness Sherlock employed when he was put into the bath. The aches, that started as a ghost of a pain, then swelled until it was unbearable, cresting so hard Sherlock would go rigid on the sofa-bed, then fading as the next dose of painkillers kicked in. His ‘meals’ had become liquid, thickened with a tasteless powder that gave everything – even drinks of juice and tea – the consistency of thick soup. Now and again, when the monitor on his thumb bleeped, he had a small tube clamped to his nose, blowing oxygen down his throat, helping his lungs to keep going. Sometimes, the fog in his left eye would condense so much that Sherlock struggled to see out of it.
“What do you care?” John shrugged, the paper beneath him crinkling. “You hardly offered me a place.”
Sherlock stared, and John’s internal prey-alarm started to chime, but he forced himself to maintain the eye contact.
They ordered food, and decided to use the TV in the lounge to watch whatever superhero movie it was John was keen to see. Sherlock could barely concentrate as he got plates and cutlery out, putting them on the coffee table for when the food arrived. He was convinced John could see right through his hoody and two t-shirts, and every time John came close, Sherlock tensed as if his breasts were about to make some sort of appearance and out him without his consent.
“It’ll still be available, if you know the right people.” Sherlock straightened up as he came off hold. “Margery?” He sagged. “Right. And what did he… yes. Yes, that’s him. Was he…. Oh, thank god. But then what did the vampire do? He
“And I’ve got marital status down as ‘bonded’,” the corporal blinked at the message. “Sorry, sir, I didn’t realise.”
Sherlock didn’t notice, wandering over to the fridge for juice, but Mycroft did. He gave John a hard look.
James scratched his scars, then tore his hand away, cursing. A tiny fleck of blood shone at his temple. “Fuck, ow. So… are you going to tell him? I think you kind of have to.”
“Not immediately,” Sherlock cautioned. “I was… furious, at myself. I have never felt such devastation. I half thought it would have been easier had you died – at least then I would have had closure, so I thought. I considered ending my own life…” he stopped, looking up sharply, the words having slipped out.
“In one respect. His body is still that of a child, and only the most brutal mind would dream of…” Mycroft stopped.
Sherlock didn’t answer, and for a moment John thought he was being ignored. Until Sherlock closed his laptop lid, and steepled his fingers under his chin, thoughtfully.
“I…” Sherlock could barely speak. He glanced down between them, something like fear-filled want in his eyes. “John…”
For the others, Mycroft took Sherlock on holiday abroad for two weeks, and he spent one with his parents, coming back to the flat for the last week to get his homework done.
John almost said it wasn’t his idea, but Sherlock looked so done over by it, be changed his mind. “Yep. I don’t know if the effect is spoiled a bit by this,” he touched his belly, “or these,” he stroked up his chest to his dark nipples. “What do you think?”
Peter was the next in their class to mature, choosing a Tuesday morning to suddenly develop a fever, and having to be dragged out of class by his Beta parents who looked somewhere between proud and embarrassed. He came back a few days later on scent blockers and with a new curfew that meant he had to quit the chess club.
“Maybe, but – but Sherlock, what is this? I don’t want to stay here if it’s going to make things awkward.”
John put his bag down. “I don’t… know. It doesn’t matter.” He walked over. “Mycroft here?” He glanced deliberately at the umbrella in the hallway.
‘Just kissing, were you?’ John’s dad laughed at the expression on his son’s face. ‘I’m not stupid, even if the Holmes’ are. But I am sorry about it all. It’s never nice, getting over a first love.’
John dug his fingernails into his jeans, twisting the material so hard it hurt. “You’re not asking, though.”
And the only thing he could do was lower his head to one side, and look at the floor in horrified submission, in an instinctive urge to be small, to hide himself, to let his alpa take from him what he needed – what they both needed – to reignite their bond.
“That’s sick!” John said. “That’s… if I have a baby, it’s my baby first. If I’m growing it, it’s mine.”
Sherlock took to school like a duck to water. He came back after the first day somewhat amazed to have found out he was already top of the class, and ahead of his classmates in several subjects. The perks, John silently supposed, of being from an old family with money to throw at your education. Sherlock happily went off to school again after that, taking his completed homework in ahead of the deadline, and looking very smart in his polished shoes and ironed shirt.
“It’s ok,” John pulled him close, so Sherlock was leaning against his chest. He stroked Sherlock’s hair, and kissed it, not caring they were at school, that anyone might see.
“He seemed embarrassed he hadn’t suggested it, to be honest,” Sherlock put the phone on the bedside table. “Though, the last time the two of you lived together –”
John smiled, and inched closer, gently running his finger up Sherlock’s arm, memorising the touch of him, remembering their closeness of the night before.
Sherlock pretended to groan. “But they’re all so tiresome. And repetitive. Captain Watson does an awful lot of training and drills and pining.”
? Before their mouths met again, and Sherlock’s grip on John’s throat tightened for an instant before relaxing into a soft support once more.
“Sherlock, you can’t make yourself worse just to protect your brother’s feelings in the short-term.” John propped him up on the pillows, and watched a bit of colour come back into his cheeks. “Ok? Any pain?”
“Because I was cut off,” Sherlock said. “Abruptly. Mycroft and my mother… attempted to keep me from getting what I needed. And when that didn’t work, they closed my bank accounts and refused to give me cash. They are both much too clever to give me chance to steal from them, so I had to find other ways of paying.”
Sherlock didn’t pick up the mess, and neither did John. John made himself food, and didn’t even attempt to feed Sherlock, who was dissecting something vile in the kitchen. They didn’t speak for the rest of the evening, and John was still in a foul mood when Sherlock came to bed (thankfully showered) and slipped under the covers.
And John was scenting him back. The alpha’s hands were on Sherlock’s arms, holding him firmly as he scented the omega’s throat. “Sherlock…”
“It’s a waste. A waste of someone… someone like you, you’re too - ” John’s mouth snapped shut in shock at himself. “Sorry. That was unprofessional.”
“I’m not,” Sherlock said. “I understand why you think that, but I’m not. Victor will be given a deadline, and I will make sure he sticks to it, but if you would rather be out of Sholto’s house immediately, and not go back to him, tomorrow… the offer is there.”
John reached for Sherlock’s hand, their fingers both wrapped in wool and leather to keep the cold away.
Mycroft clicked his tongue, and folded his arms. ‘You can have a termination. You won’t even need to go into hospital.’
“It’s always difficult, choosing who to spend the rest of your life with,” Violet said. “But we know you’ll choose someone who’ll treat you like a prince, value you. You’re special, Sherlock. You need someone who recognises that. And not everyone will, I’m sorry to say. Some people will want to just… use you. You need someone who will always recognise your value, and give you opportunities.”
Sherlock came out of his room, and John wiped his eyes quickly. “I’ve put the rest in a bag, with the boxes.”
“Don’t let me put you off,” John said, patting his mate’s hand. “It’d be a lonely Christmas for her, with no visitors.”
‘I don’t want to live my life in fear,’ Sherlock went on. ‘And my mother has always said that if you find someone you trust, an alpha you trust and who has shown they can protect you… you should count yourself lucky. So…’ Sherlock forced down a wash of terror, and reached a hand across the table. He could see it shaking, and hoped it would come across as simply nerves. ‘Charles,’ he said, in as smooth a voice as possible, ‘would you – would – would you –’ He couldn’t get the words out. They were sticking in his throat like toffee, gamming up his teeth and stealing his voice.
John had so many plans he would have needed two years to get them all done. But he didn’t care. He was going to have Sherlock. The twisting feeling that ran under his muscles whenever he thought of him was going to have somewhere to go, someone to focus on.
‘We don’t have a hand-mirror, only big ones.’ Sherlock brightened. ‘Use the forward camera on your phone?’
Sherlock gave a small cough. “We do… this. Rarely.” He put his shoulders back. “It is very intimate.”
In truth, he still didn’t know what to do. He’d never been so torn about anything in his life, including running away to the army – this was a potential life at stake, one he could find himself solely responsible for, if he chose one path, at least.
John sat back and put his crockery down on the side-table with a sigh. Of course Sherlock had bitten other people. That’s what vampires did. They bit people, drank their blood, killed them. IT was perfectly legal, perfectly normal. John had no right to expect Sherlock to stop just because they were… together…
“I’m not trying to be your dad,” John held his hands up, keeping his distance. He gave the air a subtle sniff – no changes there, so this wasn’t a sudden onset of maturity, thank goodness. “I’m trying to stop you slicing your hand open.”
"I'm aware. I've read the file, however I try and save my thoroughly pleasant manners for people who are still alive. I have a very limited supply of pleasantries," Sherlock snapped. "And while we're stuck together, you can forget the formalities. I know you're not a complete idiot, so you'll be helping me with this investigation. I won't pretend that I like your presence and you don't pretend that you like mine. Professionals helping one another so they can get rid of one another. Does that sound acceptable?"
“Compared to courting my brother, I’m sure anything is simple,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John didn’t manage it.”
“I know,” Sherlock said. “I’m… I might come into maturity soon. My brother did when he was sixteen. So…”
The last thing he needed was to be spotted waddling around in weeks to come. Sherlock would never forgive him.
“Alright, alright, I’ll move things!” Sherlock shoved his stool back, and stood up in one fluid movement that betrayed his irritation. He always got more vampiric when he was cross. He started sweeping empty test tubes and old papers into a container with more viciousness than was strictly necessary.
“Really.” Lestrade shook his head. “Someone ought to bash your heads together, I swear. Because that baby will be here before you know it. And neither of you are ready.”
Sherlock looked up. No one was calling him, were they? He stood, lunchbox in hand, looking and listening for the source of the name.
“Didn’t expect to see you, either,” John said, tearing his eyes away, and taking a sip of his drink. There was a pause before he put the cup down. “So… what happened to you?”
“Because in his delirium, he broke his phone,” Mycroft sighed. “Smashed up half the flat in a rage, not just the handset, if you must know. We got him a new one, but by that point he was refusing to turn it on, to do anything but lie on his bed, or the floor, occasionally twitching in what I can only describe as grief. He was mourning you, John. Mourning the loss of his mate, and potential child.”
Sherlock made a sort of choking noise as his flesh tightened and tingled at the touch. “God – what –”
“Because I need a termination, and the baby’s father would never agree to it,” Eurus said. “Mycroft can arrange it. Make it look like an accident, if he has to.”
“Oh, god,” John let out a sob. “I was just trying to… I didn’t want to scare him, he was so young. I didn’t want him to think I was going to…”
“I’m sorry,” John said as they reached the hall. “I asked about Eurus… I know I shouldn’t, but I thought she was ill –”
“Not yet. I’d have to consent to it, and I have refused every time. But I wonder for how much longer they’ll let me get away with it.”
“And you,” John called as she shoved her pram onto the bus. He sat, watching it pull away, a sinking feeling in his chest and stomach, but also a sense of resignation.
John had to warn him. He was shaking as he took out his phone, and wrote a message through watery eyes.
“And I stick to that,” John said. “No money, anyway.” He heaved himself off the sofa. “Uh… Look at the snow.” He went over to the window. “The road’s vanished.” He stared out of the glass.
“I mean, I’m not in heat, or anything,” Sherlock explained, face igniting with embarrassment. “I can’t… help it. I just… want…”
“Yeah…” John switched the kettle on, then turned. His arse pressed against the counter-top as his hands gripped the edge. A scent of anxiety was starting to creep from him. He pressed his lips together, before speaking. “Sherlock… Sherlock, I’ve… been thinking…”
John got into bed, and lay staring at the low ceiling for a moment, before giving in and taking a sleeping pill. He needed rest, even if it was artificial. And if he drugged himself, he wouldn’t dream.
“Wait,” Sherlock said, his voice sounding utterly strangled. “Wait.” He grabbed the lube bottle and managed to squirt some onto his fingers before touching himself, slicking up his cock, getting some on John’s hand. “Might – be – easier,” he forced out.
They grinned at each other. Then Sherlock folded up, pain curling around his abdomen fiercely. He drew his knees up and hissed through his teeth.
John’s entire life for the last four years had been training and fighting and running and learning. He hadn’t rested. Because, if he rested, he thought. He thought about Sherlock. He thought about what he’d given up, what he was missing, all those returned letters in his locker, all those unanswered phone-calls, the emotional wrenching that he went through every time he went for his blocker shot.
They were going away together in the morning, to some country house, and John had no plans whatsoever to leave the room. He wanted room service, desserts, and sex, and he was certain Sherlock would be agreeable to that.
John planted the infant on his mate’s chest, the two of them still joined at the cord. Sherlock held her as he’d seen the nurse do – on the bottom, and the back of the head, keeping her hot, damp skin close to his own.
“Want you…” John breathed, barely able to speak, his toes curling with pleasure, sweat breaking out on his chest, the backs of his knees. “D’you need a –”
Sherlock moved from the bed only when a nurse entered the room, and threatened to scream when she saw the vampire leaning over John, until Sherlock had put a finger over his lips and pressed a chaste kiss to John's forehead.
John’s mouth dropped open. ‘You mean… someone kissed you… without your permission?’ He frowned. ‘But… so what were you –’
Sherlock’s blood gave a slight rush at the possibility of sheltering an omega… a rush which quickly died as Sherlock internally rolled his eyes at himself. He wasn’t interested in that sort of thing.
“Right,” the nurse said, moving the wand about. “Let’s get you a couple of photos…” the image froze several times, and then went blank as the wand was taken from John’s belly.
“He’s not into me like that, don’t panic,” John snorted. “He’s gone to study, and then… I guess, things will just… happen.”
He looked at himself in the mirror, stroking his hair down, unused to seeing his own ears so much. Were they sticking out? Or were everyone’s ears like that? He couldn’t be sure. He ran a finger under the collar of his dark grey shirt. The red tie was a stark contrast, and he wasn’t sure the colours suited him, but this was an old-fashioned sixth form – the uniform was part of the school rules.
There was a moment of embarrassment for both of them as Sherlock’s cock was freed from his trousers, and the difference between the two of them was starkly apparent.
A very tired-looking John walked in, holding a coffee in one hand, and a pastry bag in the other. There was dried blood – Sherlock’s blood – on his t-shirt, and he looked as if he was ready to collapse.
Sherlock dunked his head under the water, and came up, covered in bubbles, water dripping over the edges of the tub.
“Shut up,” Sherlock grinned, realising the nice rushes down his body were pooling at his groin. He was getting hard, and the feel of John’s cock against him was only making it happen faster. He swallowed, glancing away. Was this right? Were omegas supposed to get like this outside of heats?
Sherlock hummed, running a hand down John’s skin. “You can call me, if you need anything. I might not pick up, though. I’m a witness.”
“And no matter how badly you cry that you want a mate, the truth is you just want someone to fuck you. All omegas are sluts and whores.”
Straddling Sherlock’s legs, pumping their cocks together, John had really wanted to rise up and take Sherlock’s cock inside him, feel that awful stretch, find his own peak of pleasure as he held the alpha down and rode him.
Mycroft stepped back. “Oh. I see. Then…” a frown passed over his face. “Then why is he living here?”
“Er… no?” John blinked, surprised by this information. “Huh. I never liked avocados, actually.” He wondered how Sherlock knew. Was he googling things about pregnancy? He had known about the Vitamin A thing, after all…
"You? You obviously didn't do it," Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. He looked paler, today, the harsh sunlight bleaching him out. And his eyes looked a more vivid red, with black around the edges of the iris.
Sherlock wandered in, familiar with the layout of the house. Mycroft followed him, sticking weirdly close like a sheepdog.
He let himself out of the car, and was up the steps and into the house with his key as fast as he could go.
Sherlock was against the far wall, his facial expression utterly impassive, as one of John’s alpha students – Gregory – scented him slowly down his throat, hands on the Unpresented boy’s shoulders.
John shook his head. "This is getting us nowhere." He patted the chest of the creature with his hand. "Do you have a name? Your name?"
‘I can’t, I’d need to go into a pharmacy with my mate which I don’t have. And anyway…’ Sherlock squirmed, ‘I don’t want to get rid of it.’
“If that’s who you are, that’s what it should call you.” Sherlock dropped his hand down. “Anything else would just be a lie, wouldn’t it?”
John read the message three times. It made him feel very strange. Sherlock felt lucky to know him? That didn’t make sense. John wasn’t anything special. He was doing nothing but causing trouble for everyone. And what was Sherlock still doing awake?
“I don’t think you need to worry quite yet,” John touched his wrist. “You’ve got puberty to go through, first. Most omega males are grown physically before they have their first heat.”
Not immediately, anyway. He knew how much Sherlock hated distractions whilst he was on a case, and he was right in assuming that John's condition would, in fact be a distraction. He did not, however, imagine that a John-shaped Distraction would be a welcome one. It wasn't like his brother to form attachments.
An image appeared on the screen, and John’s medical eye made out a leg, and an arm, before the technician turned the screen away, and started taking a few measurements.
“Shut up, please,” Sherlock’s hands pulled him closer. They ended up mashed together, John tensing in surprise and shock at the hardness he could feel in Sherlock’s trousers. “I thought you didn’t want –”
me, just not to stay with me any longer than you have to. Sherlock…” John’s voice broke, “I never thought you do this to me. I knew you’d be angry, I knew you’d not want to make up right away, but… you honestly want to draw a line under all this? Sherlock – I love you.”
John swore under his breath as he clambered up as much as he could onto Sherlock’s lap, the alpha helping him get seated on his knee with the invasive bump between them. The baby squirmed as John’s heartrate picked up, and John did his best to ignore it as he ended up pushing it against Sherlock’s front to get close enough to snog him properly. There was a definite bulge in his trousers, and a matching one in Sherlock’s as they giggled and kissed and touched at one another, but didn’t repeat the
“I can’t think why else they wouldn’t want you to stay together,” John’s dad said. “If arrangements were still a thing, that could have been something we talked about. But I think they’re scared, John. I think they’re worried for their son’s future. Can you understand that?”
John didn’t know how he could help his friend, with whatever troubles he seemed to have, without making it seem like he was still trying to get into his pants. He still liked Sherlock, as more than a friend, he knew that, but he didn’t want to put the young man into a position where he’d rather not be around him at all. And now their friendship was (sometimes) back to how it had been, John was consciously afraid of ruining it. Being without Sherlock at all would be so much worse than just having him close by as a friend.
“You can void legal responsibility,” Mycroft said. “That means that John’s children would not be Holmes’. That means that, if John studied a degree, that anyone would be legally free to claim him and override a bond. That means that John, and his children, would not be entitled to any money, any status, any protection… they would be alphaless bastards, and John would be a fallen omega.”
‘He doesn’t want to die,’ John said, forcing his voice low, to try and sound normal. ‘He’s in a tremendous amount of pain. We could stay by his bedside and keep turning it up but this…’ he forced himself to keep going, ‘this isn’t a medical moment, it’s a family one.’ He looked at Mycroft. ‘You don’t need us lurking around him at a time like this.’
He sank to the rooftop, catching himself on a metre-box, which he leaned on heavily, his mind spinning.
John dried himself, and pulled his dressing gown tight around him. He still felt hungry, and moreso now he was shaking and frightened. His body needed sustenance. He considered hiding in his room, but eventually steeled himself, and unlocked the door, creeping out in his slippers.
John felt the firmness of the alpha’s decision, and decided not to fight against it. If Sherlock was saying ‘no’, he couldn’t exactly sneak off, alone. He didn’t even know where Eurus was. He snuggled against Sherlock, backwards, against his chest. “What about your mum?”
“It was wrong of me, and I’m sorry,” James repeated. “I just… you know how I feel about Sherlock. And him turning up out of the blue… it got to me, I think.”
"Oh!" John gasped as the fingers inside him were withdrawn, and Sherlock stood to unbuckle his own belt. John flushed red with anticipation, and started to turn onto his front.
“I – I’m sorry.” Sherlock put his bare hand to John’s cheek. “I am so sorry, John, I didn’t realise.”
John caught him by the shoulders. “Deep breath, Sherlock, in through your nose. Try not to tense…” he pressed a hand to Sherlock’s concave stomach. “Breathe out slowly, breathe in with your belly, really push it out if you can.” He kept his warm hand under Sherlock’s sweatshirt but above his t-shirt as Sherlock slowly untensed, and his limbs began to tremble slightly. “Ok?”
‘Slight less like death,’ John said, watching Birdie swallow. She was staring up at him with big round eyes. He adjusted his arm slightly. ‘This feel weird.’
“No, I had excellent doctors, myself. I returned to practicing medicine for a while, and now I’m teaching others to do the same.”
“You too,” Sherlock sighed, head rolling back as John kissed at his throat. He didn’t resist as John opened his collar buttons, and inhaled deeply at the patch on his throat that begged for a bite. John could feel a burning ache in his chest and groin, telling him to bite, to claim… but not now. Not now they were as close as this… Wait. Wait until Sherlock smelled like heat, like fertility and breeding… John rutted his growing against Sherlock’s thigh. Even the thought of that happening soon was doing a number on him.
“Thank you,” William nodded. “Could I schedule a tutorial as well, for catch-up?” He smiled, and John was almost sure he was given a once-over by the student. He tensed, slightly. This was not what he’d had in mind.
Sherlock put down his mobile and looked at him. "John, I'm not sleeping with anyone else. I haven't slept with anyone else since you. I haven't wanted to. I haven't bitten anyone else. I've been living off of blood bags like a savage for the past 6 months. It's like living off fast food. I've done it before. It's not favourable, but it's fine. I've not always time for the inevitable distractions that come with drawing blood, and my casework comes first, as always."
“Come on, John. Think about it. Alphas are told from the moment they present that they have to be strong and dominating and able to provide. Omegas are told to be submissive and gentle, to be their opposite. And betas, though they might have some freedoms, are still a social class below their counterparts. There’s so much weight of expectation, no matter your gender, that finding a bond-mate has to be seen as something desirable. Heaven forbid you shouldn’t want to pass on your genes, or act outside of what you have been taught to think of as the norm.”
Sherlock was out. Though he had taken fewer cases since Birdie was born, Lestrade had made him an offer he couldn’t refuse (“It looks as though the victim was eaten alive from the inside out!”), and he had left John and Birdie alone to savour the time with just the two of them.
“I wasn’t going to say anything,” Lestrade said softly. “He’s… obviously in good hands. When does he leave?”
Sherlock was almost overwhelmed in the alpha scent, and it wasn’t just because they were sitting together.
“It’s boring,” Sherlock sighed. “I thought, when I was left there, he’d march in, bite me, fuck me, and get me pregnant. And that’d be it. He hasn’t done any of that. I wasn’t told what to do if he didn’t. No one thought he’d resist. And now…” Sherlock took Victor’s hand, “I don’t know what to do.”
“Hmm…” John quickly sketched out a group of people, all standing on their legs together. “Humans?” he showed Sherlock the picture.
He reappeared in front of the hospital, his nerves on edge as they never had been in over 500 years of being a vampire. He walked inside, going to the front desk, though he could have sniffed John out just as quickly. He didn't like the smell of sanitizer.
Sherlock gave a soft moan, rolling his hips against John as he pressed a digit inside, flexing, feeling the soft wetness of John’s insides. Though John would get wet naturally, they’d both agreed that the wetter the better was the way to go, and the lube made it so much easier to begin to slide in and out of John’s hole, his strong muscles clamping and releasing the single finger, moving steadily out almost to the tip before plunging back into the sweet vacuum that soon had John whispering: “Two.”
you. Not like an alpha wants an omega. But you’re special to me, and I do care about you. I’d hate to lose you. In any way.”
“And Sherlock,” Cam said, extracting his fingers without difficulty, “how you’ve grown this past year! A proper young man, aren’t you?” He stepped aside. “Do come in. There’s chilled lemonade in the sunroom…”
Sherlock’s tongue flicked out, wetting his lips quickly, and John hated himself for noticing. “Victor and I… have agreed to both support you in your pregnancy.”
"I am, but... It seems that someone altered the documents a few days after the incident. Look, here's the log."
“He was… very upset, understandably, with my behaviour over the past few weeks. I can’t blame anyone but myself, but…” he looked John in the eye, “I don’t regret coming over for your heat.”
“Come on,” Sherlock beckoned him, and John stood, looking apologetically at the older omega, who didn’t seem to care he was going, and was instead elaborating on his rude drawing.
John grinned, and lapped his tongue again, tasting Sherlock’s skin, swirling his tongue over the damp head before closing his lips over it.
“No,” John said, kissing him on the head. “Not every time. I hope. Just… small, and slow.” He made the shrinking gesture again, and rocked his hips back to touch his arse to the tentacle’s touch.
Unless he thought John wouldn’t want a baby – after all, he’d been apparently dead against pregnancy so far.
John had to laugh at the furious noise his daughter was making. She reminded him of himself. He undid her coat and slid her little arms out of it, taking her hat off as well. Sherlock had dressed her in rainbow stripes, this time, with embroidery of a giraffe on the chest. The wispy curls on her head were a sort of reddish-brown. John lifted her up, ignoring the pain in his arms and stomach, and tucked her into the curve of his neck.
“Yeah. Big bastard of a shot. Shattered my shoulder blade. Got a lovely bit of ceramic and steel in there, now.” He winced. “I’m sorry, if you’d rather not have known. They asked me who they should tell, and... I just felt like I wanted to tell you. I’d want to know if anything happened to you, for what it’s worth…”
“Oh,” Greg’s angry face disappeared instantly and he looked rather sheepish standing in his pyjama bottoms on the front step. “John. What’s…” he saw the suitcase. His eyebrows went up. “Oh.”
“You told me to stay away from her,” John insisted. “And I thought I knew better. I…” he took a deep, shuddering, breath. “I’ve always thought I knew best, but I don’t. Every time I’ve made a decision it’s ended up hurting me, and other people. The army. James. Being pregnant. You. This… I’ve ruined everything. Again.”
“Marmite? No, I don’t like it… There’s peanut butter, jam…” James got up and started checking the cupboards, “some sort of potted meat paste, and honey. No Marmite.”
“I’ve seen it on University Challenge,” Harry smiled, and John looked at his plate, wishing his fish would come back to life and swallow him to avoid this. “Why aren’t you taking John with you?”
“You don’t need to thank me,” Sherlock said. “Honestly, you don’t.” He lowered his head. “I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t wanted this for a long time.”
He couldn’t hear his rough breathing, so chanced skidding down the remaining steps and into the kitchen.
. Sherlock wanted to kick himself at that thought. He wasn’t supposed to want anyone at all, but when John kissed him it sent tingles all down and through his body, and his heart had pounded and he had wanted to press himself so close to the other boy that they would squash into one another and just…
‘It’s alright,’ Sherlock shrugged. ‘I should have made peace with all this a lot sooner. I’m not going to get everything I want, but I can try for as much as I can. Omegas have a shit time of it, John. All I can do is try and be the one who chooses what happens to me.’
He moaned softly, lifting his head from what was apparently the carpet on the landing. His arms trembled, though not badly, and more importantly – the pain inside him had stopped. Slick no longer ran from him – it was dried onto his legs, and it cracked on his skin as he got to his knees, sniffing the air, tasting on his tongue the remnants of his own sweat, slick, and semen.
John nodded, not really understanding. His alpha was saying things that didn’t make sense. “My Sherlock…” he reached for those dark curls.
Sherlock, of course, was another matter. He’d been shocked, but surely he must have suspected… No. He wouldn’t have thought John would want… this. By his blank reaction, he’d retreated into his own head for a good scream. John could understand that.
“I missed you,” Sherlock said. “Missed… it’s been amazing to be able to spend so much time with you of course, but… not like I… I want…” he went for another kiss.
“I left him,” Sherlock said. “At an… inconsiderate time. He would be angry about it, I understand that, but…” he shook his head. “It’s been over a century.”
“Not at all, young man. You take care.” Cam resumed his seat at the table, and Mycroft led Sherlock and John out to the waiting car.
“Lubrication,” Sherlock grinned, drawling the word out like it was utter filth. “And here,” he fished in his trouser pocket and drew out a dozen sachets. “They give them out free at Fresher’s Week.”
“You bastard,” John seethed. “You… you utter bastard. Why… why didn’t you give him them when you found him? He could have gotten in touch then!”
Sherlock touched John’s hair, and John flinched away, again. “John, I – I can’t leave you. I want you.”
Sherlock's first instinct was to hang onto the struggling creature, but stopped short as the thing cried out in pain at the grip Sherlock had on him. Sherlock relaxed the grasp of his suckers, and let the walker crawl backwards, away from beneath him and into the coldness of the empty cave. There were circular red marks on his skin where the sucked had bitten down on him. He was fragile, then. His body temperature was dropping already.
Another wave of warmth came over him, this time less burning, but lingering, making him catch his breath.
The touches skimmed through the cleft of his arse, and John felt wetness travel with it, up and down, feeling with utmost care, until finding the tense, taut skin of his entrance, and stroking tiny circles over the drawn skin.
Some of it was instinctual – he’d been close to his mate, but not touched. But most of it was emotional.
The fact that he was at risk of death registered as if this was ordinary, fine, nothing to worry about. John hurt, but he couldn’t panic. He didn’t have enough in him to panic. He might die. That was the fact of it. He could tell blood was running from his mouth, now, feel the wetness of his lungs as blood seeped into them, every breath a wet slap, a struggle. It was just a matter of time…
"I... I was..." Oliver went red, and John could see his hands were shaking. "I didn't change anything about his condition. He was shot dead."
He’d already lost it. He was already crying. He’d lost. Lost a contest he hadn’t actively participated in. He didn’t deserve Sherlock. He’d given him up too easily.
Sherlock leaned against John as they left the street. “What happens, then? In this timeline? If I get more than a punch? Will I die?”
John handed his the helmet, and Sherlock put it on, tightening it under his own chin as John raised the saddle up.
They sat in silence as John wrestled with the clench around his chest, his heart, and tried not to let the drawing feeling pick him up from his chair and make him run across London back to his mate. He knew, even now, that his bond was Sherlock was strong – as strong as it could be, bar the moment of the bite. They were connected by soul, by blood, and by the cluster of cells growing in John’s womb.
“And you don’t think you need to know that? This is a forensic science degree, Sherlock. There’s no knowledge that isn’t worth gaining.”
John ordered them both coffee, and they went to sit down. “Would it bother you? If we went with that? I’ll be out of here before too long, and... if you do relationships... did you want to try it?”
, with parental-like status is Siger. And to add more madness into the mixture, John’s next of kin is Harriet Watson – there is no clear path, here.”
There was a wedding outfit fitting a few days later. Sherlock and his mother went to choose a gown together, and Sherlock wanted to cry for the entire time. He told his overjoyed mother that he was emotional with happiness. Whether she believed it or not, he didn’t much care. The gowns all looked the same, so Sherlock chose the one that made his mother cry the hardest, paying with Magnussen’s credit card and requesting the express alteration service.
John stared at Sherlock for a long time, then shook his head. "Don't get me wrong, I'm happy, but I just... I don't understand why it's me. Of all people. You could literally have anyone."
“Oh…” Sherlock realised he’d been speaking out loud. “John… I… love you too… I thought you’d never… I wanted to say, for ages, but…”
“Ha, we’ll see…” John picked the label off his water bottle. His fingers moved deftly, and Sherlock stared at them, trying to imagine if they were rough, or smooth. He’d replayed the memory of them holding hands in his lounge until, like an old projection strip, it had burned away and become faded, over-used. He was only sure now that it had happened. The details were gone. “So… you going away for summer?”
