Tony breathes in the salty sea air deeply, leaning back in the chair he’s been sat in for at least an hour. He had long since finished the cappuccino he had ordered that morning from the café in the aquarium, and while he’s tempted to get up and get himself another one, he doesn’t want to miss Steve when he arrives. The last time in Paris had been risky, but worth it – if only to make sure that Steve would never risk himself like that again. Tony had left him the following morning without being able to say goodbye, but he had a meeting in Geneva to get to. There, Tony had broached the idea of a pardon with Thaddeus Ross, and it had been quickly shot down – not for all of the ex-Avengers, no, but for Steve Rogers… The powers that be wanted him to be punished, no matter how many times Tony tried to present an alternative.
“Promise me you’ll get them back?” The heels of Tony’s shoes dangle over air, and his toes dig against the inside of them, trying to keep himself here – with Steve, not dangling over the edge of a cliff. Not dead.
“Pepper.” Tony says, his fingers folding against the palm of her hand. “Pepper – he killed my mom. He killed my mom.”
“Bring the butterfly bandages,” Tony mumbles, running his fingers through his hair idly, and Steve can practically hear the cogs in his brain turning as he thinks. Tony is always thinking.
Tony rubs at his watering eyes, sneezing again, and Steve hands him his handkerchief instantly. He wipes his nose with the fabric, soft, clean, and so
They exchange a flurry of blows, Steve landing punch after punch to his ribs, his abdomen – Tony feels as though he’ll be a mosaic of bruises tomorrow. If Steve wasn’t holding back, he’d probably just be a slurry of lacerated organs – so at least there’s that. Tony, to his credit, gets in a few blows that seem to rattle Steve, because the supersoldier’s next right hook sends Tony sprawling face first onto the mat.
Steve’s jaw works. “I – Fine. Fine. I didn’t tell you because I knew that you would try to get revenge. You would pour every ounce of energy into finding Bucky, and then you would kill him. Because he killed your mother.”
They’ll sit at the coffee shop, and Tony will stare at him every now and again, and when Steve catches him, he’ll blush furiously. Tony will tell him what he’s working on, pulling out a mangled looking notebook from his pocket – and instead of detailed descriptions of his nightmares, as he kept in the one at his and Steve’s brownstone apartment in New York – this notebook will be filled with ideas and designs. Tony will take a big gulp of coffee, and then look Steve dead in the eyes.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve murmurs, his voice soft – he had said the same thing in Tony’s ear, after… “I’ll see you there.”
“Wait, what’s going on? Are you okay?” Tony watches her as she hurries away, and then throws himself back against the building as a taxi careens onto the sidewalk. He looks up into the sky, people are pointing at the sky –
Steve follows after Tony sleepily, not protesting when Tony pulls his shirt up over his head. Tony’s lips press to his bare skin, and he can almost hear Tony’s thoughts with each touch of his lips:
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve presses a soft kiss just below his ear, and Tony feels the hair on the nape of his neck stiffen – amongst other things. “Night, Tony.”
“I’ll be looking out for my trophy in the mail.” Tony mumbles under his breath as he walks back over to where Steve is sitting, the other man tossing the ice pack between his hands. “Let me take care of your cut, first,” he says as he sits down.
He didn’t try to initiate things with Tony, he didn’t want to ask too much of the other man – he had learned his lesson. Sometimes, though, Tony’s kiss to his cheek would linger, or he would rest against Steve’s chest while they watched a movie. Steve can tell that Tony wants more, that Tony is resisting the urge to kiss him over breakfast or pull him back into the second bedroom – he’s punishing himself for what happened on Titan, denying himself any happiness that would last longer than a few moments.
Steve reaches up with his injured finger and runs it over the stiffened fabric – they had offered him a scrub shirt, he recalls, but he had shaken his head numbly and sat down.
What comes next, Tony’s not sure — one minute he’s shouting at Steve, the next, he’s back in his bed in the med bay. This time, his world is hazy, and it doesn’t take a genius to know that Bruce has drugged him.
Tony’s back rests against the cool, smooth wall. He wants to ruck up his sweater and press his bare skin to it in an effort to cool himself down – but he thinks that will just rile the two of them up more. He can’t afford to make another mistake.
“I have a flight.” Tony murmurs, his hands slipping away from his face as Steve’s lips press just below his ear.
Tony has been stabbed more times than he can count. Even before Afghanistan, he had sustained the occasional deep laceration from a careless sharp edge in his workshop. Never, in his life, has he been stabbed this deeply.
“Not really,” Tony is staring down at his own hands again, not looking at Steve – intentionally not looking at Steve. “I have a big meeting tomorrow. Christ, it’s a big meeting.”
i would love to hear your thoughts! what do you think about a sequel? would things go exactly as steve imagined them to? i guess if the russo brothers can fuck around with time travel and alternate realities, so can i! look forward to hearing what you think, thanks for reading, commenting, kudosing - and sticking with me on a wild ride of what really was just a one shot and then... wasn't.
And yes, he had to ask Wanda Maximoff not to leave the Avengers compound – ask being a shifty word. She hadn’t tried to leave, thus far, he had checked the security cameras. She was doing something pretty fucking weird, though, Tony had squinted down at the footage in disbelief. He wouldn’t brag, but he considers himself quite experienced when it comes to flirtation, and if he didn’t know any better – Wanda was spending her time flirting with
Steve’s phone vibrates again on the nightstand, and he can feel Tony’s groan vibrate against the inside of his thigh.
“She has a way of doing a lot of things – stabbing people in the back, for one, she’s great at that.”
Tony reaches up to rub at his lips with his fingers for a moment, glowering at Steve, but his scowl transforms into a grin. “You did that. Congrats, Cap.” He sits up straight, reaching for the gelato. “Wow, my favorite flavor – who told you?”
The tower had been a home to him, a familiar stomping ground where he could test out any wild idea that came to mind and fall into a familiar bed whenever his body gave out from exhaustion. The beds in hotels, no matter what Trip Advisor suggested to the contrary, are always like sleeping on a rock.
Steve watches him eat, grinning when Tony screws up his eyes, evidently suffering from a brain freeze. “So, birthday boy, what are our plans?”
He had dressed up for this, had a new suit fitted for this very occasion. The Bvlgari watch on his wrist is the icing on the cake, he had dressed to the nines and Steve is wearing jeans and a brown leather jacket. A leather jacket that is stretched tightly across his broad shoulders, keeping him warm.
“I did ballet as a kid. You envy my footwork,” Tony says, stepping closer to Steve, the other man’s eyes on his right hand when they really should be on his left. Steve seems completely unfazed as Tony’s fist strikes him in the ribs, though Tony doubles over and draws his hand back.
Bucky says nothing, he looks at Steve for a long moment – Steve can see pity there, and exasperation. And then he is alone, lying on a bed that is too big for just one person, with Tony’s ghost beside him.
Steve does not smile, and more tears are falling. Tony, on the other hand, feels nothing. Maybe the faintest bit of terror – but he’s accustomed to death. Yes, he’s afraid of heights, but it ought to be immediate. It will be nothing like slowly starving, adrift in space. It will be nothing like the fifteen minutes of sheer paralysis Obadiah Stane inflicted on him, razor-sharp shrapnel moving through his sluggish veins to his heart.
“I deserve that,” Steve says, his thumb idly rubbing over the back of Tony’s knuckles. “I do. More than that, Tony. But please, come inside if you’re going to kick my ass. It’s cold out.”
Tony is a difficult man to fully understand – Steve had seen countless tabloid covers recounting Tony’s exploits. In idle jealousy, he had done research on every ex-flame Tony had that had been publicized. There was never a photo of him kissing his partner, though, the most scandalous thing was a snapshot of him holding hands with Pepper as they walked down the street. For all the talk about Tony being a playboy, his displays of affection are kept private.
“My palate isn’t that underdeveloped,” Steve complains, though he takes the fork Tony’s offering him anyways.
“What are you doing?” Steve is stressed – Tony can tell, because the other man is snapping at him, and his hands are fisted at his sides. He stares down at Tony where he’s knelt in the dirt, a muscle twitching in his jaw.
Steve hears the door to the bedroom shut behind him, slowly reaching up to touch where Tony had kissed him, his skin warm. He smiles to himself, gathering up the clippers and the kitchen scissors.
“I sucked Captain America’s star spangled dick!” Tony shouts, the cords in his neck standing out, more blood trickling from the seams of the bandage. “And swallowed his red, white, and blue co-.”
Tony looks over his shoulder at him, scowling. “Do people usually bother to ask? I can make a guess.”
“The night I made the reservation for our dinner.” Tony bites into his croissant, his cheeks flushing pink. “I thought maybe we’d come back to Paris. Plus, I wanted a base for myself in Europe – I’m sick of these long haul flights. They won’t let me take the suit.”
Steve shifts forward slowly, closing the distance between them, centimeter by centimeter. He expects Tony to bolt again, as his lips brush against his, barely more than a touch. Tony doesn’t bolt, but he does pull away. Steve glances down for a moment, wondering if that’s a bulge in Tony’s shorts or just wishful thinking and the way the fabric is bunched up from how he’s sitting.
Tony stares at him searchingly, and then he shakes his head, bruised hands clenched into fists at his sides.
“Fine,” Tony says, not believing that he’s allowing himself to put the kid in jeopardy like this. “Just this once, do you hear me? You can help just this once, and then that’s it – I mean it.”
“Absolutely not,” Tony says quietly, leaning into Steve’s touch slightly. His fingers curl around the edge of the counter as Steve’s fingers card through the long strands of hair on the top of his head that he’s barely held back with some ancient looking gel he found in the bathroom.
Tony’s eyes widen, and he draws his hand away from Pepper’s lips, shifting on the bed. “No I don’t,” he snaps, “I don’t.”
Tony has not spent a Christmas truly alone since the year his parents had died. After that, he would spend Christmas with Rhodey’s family – and after he had hired Pepper, she would usually find herself in his Malibu mansion, making sure that he didn’t choke on his own vomit as he drank himself to oblivion. And when he and Pepper were together… She had allowed Tony to sink himself into the holiday completely, stringing up bright lights and dragging a massive Christmas tree through the foyer. And yes, she had requested that he limit his singing of Christmas carols to the waking hours, but she had smiled all the same – and sang along, sometimes.
Steve smiles slightly, warm relief spreading over him. It had been a gamble, to accuse Tony of having feelings for him when they weren’t lying naked in bed together – to force Tony to recognize the true reason behind these clandestine meetings.
“Well, I’m glad you minded your business and didn’t go nosing through my files. My Social Security number is in there, you could have committed all sorts of identity theft.” Tony shoves a piece of toast into his mouth, taps his reactor, and returns to the water.
When Steve wakes to an empty bed that morning, there’s a note on Tony’s pillow. He picks it up, rubbing at his eyes, Tony’s spikey handwriting swimming into focus.
“Every day. You saw me almost every day for over a year – you had every opportunity to tell me about Barnes and my parents. Why didn’t you?”
“No, Tony,” Steve murmurs, rolling his hips experimentally against the other man’s, Tony’s fingers tugging at his hair sharply, insistently. The pearl buttons of Tony’s dress shirt ease out of the holes confining them in quick succession, Steve’s blunt fingers dancing down the scar left over from his recent surgery. “I’m going to make you beg for it,” he murmurs, capturing Tony’s lips with his own, ignoring the sharper tug at his hair, instead focusing on the way Tony’s body jerks against his.
Steve swallows back bile, feeling it burn down his throat. “A bat,” he says hoarsely. “A baseball bat.”
Tony shrugs, setting his spoon into his now empty cup. “I booked us a hotel room for tonight. I don’t have to leave until tomorrow evening, so…” Tony shrugs again. “I’m sure we’ll find something to do.”
Tony leans forward, a bead of sweat trickling down his temple, his brown eyes dark. The coarse hair of his goatee burns against the shell of Steve’s ear, and his lips are soft against blushing skin.  “Make me.”
Steve stares at him uncomprehendingly, reaching up to prod at the cut on his face, staining the white tape on his hand red.
“Yes,” Tony rests his hand against his chest. “Me… Sports… You… Army.” He rolls his eyes, bringing one wet arm up onto the pool deck, water darkening the bricks below. “I used to love it. Being under water, I mean. Everything is clear, with goggles on – and time slows down. But after Afghanistan…” Tony shrugs, shoveling cold eggs into his mouth.
“No,” Tony says dryly, though his voice lacks its usual sharpness – it has a strangled quality, like Tony can’t catch his breath. “No, I had to save that for Captain America. Thought the gloves would protect ‘em, anyways.”
“What?” Tony asks distractedly as his fingers fumble with the buttons of Steve’s shirt. His rough hands brush over Steve’s bare chest, and he hears Tony exhale slightly.
“Christ, Steve,” Tony grits out, grabbing at him tighter. “It’s a little late for that, don’t you think?” Tony’s face pales, even in the dim light. “Alright – maybe – hospital. Let me get up.”
Tony wishes, later, that he hadn’t shown up to the ratification at all. He wishes it as he sits in the back of an ambulance, wincing as a butterfly bandage is pressed over a deep cut at the base of his neck.
“Had to wash out the gel,” Tony says as he slings Steve’s towel over his shoulders, the soft fabric brushing over the reactor where it glows on his chest. “Wanted to give you every opportunity to not fuck this up.”
“Wake up, sleeping beauty,” Tony murmurs, pulling away. “I got chocolate croissants. They’re still hot.”
After dinner, they wash the dishes side by side at the sink, Tony can scarcely breathe at Steve’s proximity.
Tony glances at the clock on Steve’s bedside table, so delightfully old-timey. “Steve, I can’t. I’ve got to go. We can talk later, after this meeting? Better yet…”
“Take a later one,” Steve repeats in turn, his arms wrapping around him. Tony is a lean guy, but he’s in shape – that had been one of the night’s delightful discoveries. “There have to be dozens of flights to Vienna.”
Tony pulls his suitcase behind him as he walks over to Steve, and he tenses immediately as Steve wraps him in a tight hug.
“Dance with me, Steve, c’mon.” Tony starts to sway them, which takes a lot of effort – given Steve’s bulk. He closes his eyes, thinking back to that morning in Paris, and is able to recall the song. Steve stiffens in his arms as Tony starts to hum, but his feet move slowly, no longer dragging. Tony rests his head against Steve’s chest, listening to his rapid heartbeat.
“It is you,” Steve replies fervently, “It is you. Yeah, it’ll be hard. I’ve got notes on what they did to you in Wakanda, and I won’t have access to the tech, but I’ll make it work.”
Tony doesn’t push him onto the bed, which surprises Steve – their time apart usually leads to undeniable desire that results in them tangled up together in the sheets before they can think of doing anything else. Instead, he silently takes Steve’s hand, and leads him out of the room.
“You know I’m right,” Tony doesn’t say it to be arrogant. “And at least it’s you. I wouldn’t want — anyone else to — be here, when I…”
It stings when Tony pulls out of Steve’s arms so that he can begin packing up his suitcase. He pulls away very quickly, and Steve feels like an idiot, his arms dangling at his sides.
He moves to the small table and two chairs by the open windows, tilting his head as he catches a few notes of music on the breeze, his eyes closing.
He manages to hold his right hand over the wound, nanites flowing upwards from his chest to encase his hand in a gauntlet. They flow out of his fingertips and into the wound, incredibly cold, and Tony bites down on his bottom lip at the pain.
“We’ll go to my room,” Steve murmurs, tongue laving a hot path down the column of his throat. “This isn’t my first time, Tony.”
“Tony…” Steve can’t get another word out, because Tony is kissing him again – kissing him, and beating his chest with his fists.
“Tony…” Bruce Banner blanches at the sight of him as they step into the compound. “Hang on, you need to go to the med bay.”
Steve is in London, and Tony is in Vienna. Tony had read the text three times under the table while a UN official droned on, reading page 276 of the Sokovia Accords verbatim.
One morning, Tony comes out of his room for breakfast, and he’s shaved his beard back into his usual sculpted goatee. Steve says nothing as he slides a sunny-side-up egg onto Tony’s plate.
“How about Portugal?” There’s the soft click of keys in the background, Steve is proving that he can use Google. “New Year’s Day. Meet me at the airport in Lisbon. I’ll pick you up.”
“Alright, my turn,” Tony replies, reaching up to pull Steve’s jacket off of his shoulders, the duffel bag landing heavily on his foot. Steve catches his wrist, pulling his hand away from his chest.
When Tony returns to where Steve is standing by the doors, his brown eyes are glossy with tears. Steve offers him a handkerchief from his pocket, and Tony makes a face, one that says
“I guess I could. But where would that leave the world? We’re already without Captain America – should I deprive the good people Iron Man, too?” He grins at Steve, that cocksure smile that infuriates him and attracts him all the same.
Steve glances at him and says nothing – he knows what Tony is thinking. Cardinals, representative of lost loved ones. He squeezes Tony’s hand comfortingly, and they move on.
“Okay.” Steve sits on the couch, his hand idly brushing over the soft leather. He wishes he had his shield to protect himself with – because Tony is seething, and there is something glowing in his chest.
Tony squeezes his hand, turning his head to look at him slowly. “I — Guess I should’ve stuck around longer, then… Uh, listen, Steve.” Tony’s palm is sweaty against his, and Steve can feel his pulse thrumming in his wrist. “I don’t exactly have a place… I was wondering, when I got out, if…”
Steve winces and then reaches up to rub at the swelling skin on the right side of his face, no doubt sore from Tony’s punch.
“You need to get out in the sun, Cap.” Tony says as he straddles the bench in front of Steve, teeth gripping the Velcro strap of his own glove, ripping each one off. Wiggling his numb fingers, he picks up the roll of handwrap that Steve had placed in front of him.
“You’re bleeding,” Steve glances down at the base of Tony’s throat, a few beads of blood forming on the white fabric of the bandages. Tony’s fingers twitch against his thigh, his skin hot, he wants to button up the shirt – but he also wants Steve to reach over and slowly and methodically unbutton it.
“Steve,” Tony pats him on the cheek again. “I know I said I wasn’t gonna shove you off the edge. And I’m not. But I’m pretty sure you’ve got to be the one doing the shoving.”
“It’s hanging up in the locker room,” Steve says, his fingers brushing through Tony’s dark curls, blue eyes meeting brown. “Come back to bed.”
“It’s time for your haircut appointment, Mr. Stark,” Steve says seriously, wanting Tony to crack a grin – the far away look in his eyes is scary, like he’s back on Titan. Steve knows Tony has nightmares, he can hear him sometimes in the night – sometimes it’s screams, sometimes it’s sobs. Whenever Steve goes to his door and knocks, Tony haltingly tells him that he’s fine, that he’s sorry that he woke Steve up. Tony has a prescription for sleeping pills, which he rarely takes, telling Steve that they make the nightmares worse – and harder to wake up from.
“Find a way to time travel and tell me the moment you found out,” Tony replies hollowly, though there’s no snark, as much as he tries to muster it.
“I shouldn’t have come here,” Tony says, his back to him. He stares out at the ocean, watching the rough waves as they roll in against the cliff. “I can hardly look at you without wanting to throw a punch or vomit. Sometimes both.”
“We’ve contacted his next of kin,” the nurse says kindly, trying to comfort him. “Virginia Potts? She’s on her way – so he won’t be alone.”
“Okay,” Steve agrees, turning his back to Tony so that he can collect the box from the top of the drawer. He cocks his head slightly, hearing the shift of fabric, the slight sigh that escapes Tony as he sits down.
Steve humors him. “You were right about the Accords. I don’t believe in them, Tony, you know I don’t. But we wouldn’t have been able to avoid them, or something worse later down the road. The world is different, sometimes I think I’ve adapted to it, and then something happens and I realize that I’m still frozen. I should have just signed them.”
His fingertip presses into Steve’s chest, the fabric of his sweater soft. Tony’s finger brushes down slowly, watching Steve’s skin flush pink, his eyes on Tony’s lips.
“Just need your signature, Cap,” Tony says, sitting in the chair across from Steve. He pulls out the pen case from his pocket, opening it on the table. The pens glint under the bright lights, and Tony feels like he’s the one in trouble, like he’s about to be interrogated. Outside of the glass walls, they are spared a few glances, but everyone is mostly going about their work. The room is soundproof, after all, there’s not much anyone can pick up on, unless they were skilled lip-readers.
Steve grunts as Tony throws himself at him, his lips pressing against his, teeth and tongue – passion instead of anger. Tony’s hands brush down the tops of his thighs, pushing his jeans further down, and Steve almost trips over them as Tony physically pulls him into their bedroom.
“Hurt like a bitch,” Tony says casually, fingers playing with the various plastic guards on offer while Steve’s hand brushes over his back. “Don’t recommend getting your guts reorganized courtesy of a sword. In case you were wondering.”
“I have to go somewhere for a day or two,” Tony says, though his world comes back into focus at the squeeze of Rhodey’s hand, and he’s grateful – so grateful. Rhodey is his best friend, and he’s never deserved him. He knows, were he to open his mouth and tell Rhodey that he’s meeting up with Captain America, that he would find himself locked in his bedroom for at least a week.
Tony’s hands curl into fists at his sides, looking down at where Stephen Strange is currently being tortured.
“It won’t be warm in January,” Tony says sleepily, putting the phone on speaker and setting it on the pillow by his head.
The waiter is at Tony’s side in a moment, and Steve watches in quiet admiration as Tony converses in rapid-fire French. There are a few things about Tony that he’s jealous of: his confidence, his intellect, but most of all – his ability to pick up languages like he had been born knowing them. A glass of still water appears at Steve’s elbow, and he frowns.
Tony waves his hand, finally eating the piece of squash, though it’s no longer warm. “Give it a couple of months, and you will – everyone does, eventually. Though you have the benefit of not being able to be with me day in and day out… That might provide longevity.”
“You’re okay,” Steve bends his head and kisses over the back of Tony’s hand where it rests against the bed, avoiding the IV and the bruised flesh around it. “You need to rest Tony.”
“Well… I was thinking of jumping.” There’s the honesty Steve’s been searching for, but he knows that Steve won’t be relieved to hear it – won’t be relieved at all.
He had convinced himself of that for a while, until red roses had been delivered to the compound on December 16
Steve shakes his head, and Tony feels himself fading, Pepper lets out a sharp exhalation as he starts to fall.
A cardinal chirps loudly from a towering tree next to the platform, and Steve looks up at it curiously. Tony, warning him not to do this – or Tony, telling him to come?
Steve slips back into a light doze, grabbing at Tony’s pillow and holding it tightly, smelling the billionaire’s cologne faintly. He doesn’t stir when Tony slips back into the apartment half an hour later.
“Where are we going?” Steve asks as they step out of the elevator and into the lobby, Tony’s hand falling away from his.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice is sleepy and slow in his ear, and Tony knows that Steve is calling him in the middle of the night in Wakanda – December 26
Tony feels as though he’s on fire, thrown onto a stake to burn as punishment for his own stupidity. He’s damning himself, he knows, as he leans back against Steve’s chest. Damning himself as he closes his eyes, the bottle thudding against the counter top, Steve’s hand slipping up under the hem of his sweater.
Tony’s jaw clicks as his teeth clench together, and he reaches up to knuckle at his forehead, knowing that the headache he’ll have after this will be incapacitating. Steve is right, though – Tony wouldn’t do that. And if Ross and a bunch of Marines barged through the front door of the compound right now, Tony would use his last moments of freedom to wipe the phone clean.
“No, hear me out. You could come with me, you could be at my side. We could be a team, Steve. A real team. Captain America and Iron Man, staunch supporters of the Sokovia Accords – and then we won’t have to talk about it at all. Just…” Tony’s hands drop to his sides, and he’s pleading with Steve – a position he’s almost too proud to be in. “Take my side, for once. Trust me, believe in me, I know I’m doing the right thing for the Avengers – for us. I’ll never ask you to trust me again, Steve, I swear.” Tony smiles wryly, though it fades after a few moments. He meets Steve’s gaze. “Please. Do this for me.”
“You’ve got good form,” Steve says admiringly after watching Tony land a few hits. He moves to stand at his side, watching the muscles in Tony’s forearms tense with each punch. “Who taught you?”
“But I didn’t. And I tore the team apart. And I hurt you. I’ll regret that to the day I die. I was selfish. I asked too much, and I took too much. What do you want me to do, Tony?” Steve looks over his shoulder at him, the question sincere. “Do you want me to turn myself in? I will.”
She leans forward, recognizing that Tony is about to throw himself out of the bed, his eyes lighting up with a fury that really shouldn’t be possible given the amount of painkillers he’s on. Her hands press against his shoulders, holding him down, and he’s sobbing – Pepper looks over her shoulder, wishing she had someone here to help her. But Rhodey is in New York, recovering from his own hospital stay, trying out his new cybernetic braces. Happy is holding down the fort for Stark Industries, a terrifying thought. Steve Rogers is, well – he had been the one to cause this carnage.
Eventually, he had dragged himself from Steve’s bed, nursing a hangover from the night before. Christmas Eve had been spent finishing one of Natasha’s bottles of vodka that she kept hidden in her room, not really watching
He picks up the box of butterfly bandages, hefting it in his palm. The cut on Steve’s face had been deep enough to warrant these – but would Steve take care of himself, or would he just let it scab over and scar? Tony reaches up, pressing his knuckles to his forehead – his headache is back, though he doesn’t think it’s one of the electromagnetic variety. No, this headache is the result of the stiff jab to the jaw that Steve had doled out, and the fact that Steve’s arms had held him close as they had kissed. Steve’s lips had parted against his own. That wasn’t supposed to happen – no, Tony was supposed to kiss him for maybe three seconds, and then Steve was supposed to shove him away. Steve wasn’t supposed to reciprocate any sort of interest, because that wouldn’t make any sense. Tony was acting on a fantasy he’d had since puberty, nothing more – and once he got it out of his system, he would finally be able to look at Steve in a new light. A clearer light.
“Okay, okay. I’ll go get the reactor, I promise. Right after I leave here.” The last time he had held Tony’s reactor in his hands, Tony had thrust it there – and told Steve to hide.
Tony whirls around to face him, and his hand moves to his chest, fingers hovering over the light shining dimly through his jacket. He’s furious, the tendons of his neck are tense, and Steve watches a bead of sweat trickle down from his forehead to his temple.
If they aren’t careful, they will cause a scene in the middle of the airport. Steve’s grip tightens on the handle of Tony’s suitcase, walking faster. Tony trots after him, his voice raising at Steve’s back.
Once the bill is settled, Tony stands unsteadily from the table, and Steve’s large hand rests on his waist to steady him.
That night, Tony makes them dinner – and the steak makes his mouth water, Tony had cooked it to perfection. Steve has missed Tony’s cooking, he’s only had a meal here and there prepared by the other man. After the hospital, he had offered to cook, but Steve had insisted that he would take care of it – take care of him. They chat across the dinner table, Steve laughing at Tony’s jokes, Tony listening to Steve’s stories of Brooklyn and the war.
Tony knuckles his forehead forcefully, pressing them hard against the skin. This is the nightmare that had plagued him since 2012 – the threat that he will be unable to stop. He needs Steve here, at his side, or they will both fail.
He looks up at the entryway to Les Bougresses, blue eyes scanning over the gold cursive letters painted over the black background of the sign. He had expected something upscale, some restaurant where he would feel out of place while Tony would be completely in his element. He had been wrong – and he can picture Tony’s vindicated smile now, as he lingers in front of the restaurant. He peers in through the window, trying to make out Tony inside, the watch on his wrist ticking away. 6:50 – earlier than Tony had said – but Steve wanted to make a good impression. He feels like an idiot – while the restaurant is not as high end as he thought it would be, he still feels underdressed. Beneath his brown leather jacket he wears a plain white t-shirt, which he had tucked into his jeans. His duffel bag is slung over his shoulder still, he hadn’t bothered getting a hotel room just yet – he had so much that he wanted to do in Paris, after all, and if everything went south at this dinner Steve knew that he wouldn’t want to spend another minute in this city. He looks to the right of the restaurant, but the café next door is closed – wildly, he wonders where the nearest public restroom is. He could dive into one, change into something more appropriate – he
Tony stops at his end of the pool, the nanites returning to the reactor, his head completely dry. He picks up a cold piece of bacon, looking up at Steve with a frown.
Steve straddles the seat and catches Tony staring at him, watching the other man blush and look away.
The platform whirs beneath his feet, and Steve closes his eyes. He will need to wear a jacket on December 16
Steve’s hand unfurls against his thigh – they have circled back to this, and perhaps it’s time. Time for him to listen, and then he will tell Tony what he needs to hear – because Steve is starting to believe it, too.
“This is crazy,” Steve sounds almost hysterical, borderline, anyways. “There has to be another way.”
The shield had crunched into the chest of his suit, had shattered the glass front of the reactor, and then the reactor itself. Shards of glass had made their way through the neoprene undersuit Tony wore, had sliced into his skin, sunk into his bones. His custom-made sternum had shattered like sugar work.
Tony fists his fingers against Steve’s broad back as Steve’s hand squeezes between his legs, and his knees go weak.
Tony gets up from the table, reaching into his other pocket to pull out the worn leather pen case. He slides his father’s pen inside, looking down at the matching pen resting in the velvet beside it.
The hand on his chest is the hand that caused the injury to begin with. The very same fingers that brush over his heart are those that had curled over the edge of the shield and brought it down with a shout against Tony’s reactor. The hand of his lover, the hand of his executioner. The hand of a liar, in the end, that’s all that matters.
“Tony,” Steve murmurs, kissing him slowly, feeling Tony arch against him. He tastes of wine, though it’s better on his lips than in Steve’s glass. When Steve’s tongue brushes over his, he tastes chocolate, and – his eyebrows furrow. “You smoke?”
“Tony, breathe.” Steve rests his forehead against his front door, keys to his motorcycle dangling from his hand. “Breathe, sweetheart. I’m here, I promise. But I need you to tell me a street, okay?”
The shield had moved down in slow motion, Tony had felt the muscles in his neck tense, as if preparing to fight back against vibranium and Steve’s raw strength – as if he had a chance.
Steve nods over the edge of the newspaper to Pepper as she walks out of Tony’s room, still wiping at her eyes with a thin piece of tissue.
The shower in the hotel room is one of the rain head varieties – of course it would be, he’s staying in the best hotel in Vienna. Tony closes his eyes, tipping his head forward as the water pounds against the sore muscles in his shoulders and back.
“Does it really matter?” Steve asks as he bows his head, pressing soft kisses to Tony’s chest, each one an apology.
Natasha Romanoff stands in the doorway to his room, a plastic key disappearing from her hand as Tony walks towards her with his mouth agape.
“On a walk,” Tony says with a guarded smile. “I don’t know where. It’s beautiful out, it’s my birthday, and I want to walk.”
He runs a hand over his face, feeling the heat of his cheeks against his palm – he doesn’t have the energy to act on these thoughts tonight, these thoughts of Tony – and when he did act on those thoughts, he usually ended up feeling worse than before. He wonders if this is how Peggy had felt for the first few years, wondering if Steve would ever come back.
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Tony closes his eyes as he tips his head back against the wall with a thud, pressed up against it and Steve, pinned.
“Steve,” Tony can hear the reverence in his own voice – the tone he had taken when he had said the words
“Yes,” Tony says shortly, still blushing. He smiles, a hesitant smile – but a real one. “More than alright. Thank you.”
He gets in the car, and keeps driving, leaning forward over the wheel to see the road better – his jetlag is catching up with him, and the fog rolling in over the heather is fitting but annoying in his quest to make it to the cottage in one piece.
“Oh, really?” Tony lands another blow, grinning against the mouth guard, his teeth grinding into the rubber. Steve’s forearms are like rods of steel, Tony’s knuckles swelling inside of his gloves as his fists attempt to get through the barrier Steve has created to his body.
“Try it on,” Steve suggests, watching Tony pick the piece of jewelry up, holding it between his thumb and forefinger.
“I didn’t know you’d be all riled up after dinner,” Tony argues, pushing Steve forward in turn, until they are both moving at more of a trot than a walk.
“I haven’t played in forever,” Tony murmurs, mostly to himself, his touch light. “Not in years. Feels rusty.”
“I’m sorry, Tony, but I have to. I’ll be back first thing in the morning, okay? I promise.” Steve leans down and kisses Tony’s cheek, the coarse hairs of his beard a new sensation. Steve idly wonders when he had decided to let his perfectly shaped goatee go.
The delete button is pressed savagely, over and over, the cursor blinking gently – patiently, waiting for Tony to type out a proper response. He clicks the lock button, sliding the phone back into his pocket, returning his attention to the document in front of him.
“Heeeeeey, Steve….” Tony sounds different – Steve had heard him drunk more times than he had heard him sober, and while he’s slurring his words, Steve doesn’t think that alcohol is entirely to blame. The timbre of his voice is different, too, deeper – like Tony’s aged. Like he’s five years older than when he had last spoken to Steve.
“You look better,” Steve says, and then blushes. “I mean, you looked great when I last saw you – but you… look like you’ve gotten more sleep.”
“I don’t think you do, Steve. You love this,” he gestures between them, continuing to pace at the foot of the bed. “And yeah, the sex is phenomenal. And we talk, and that’s good. And we kiss – probably a bit too much, considering what we’re both really here for. And you know, maybe in another reality, if you weren’t so stubborn – yeah, maybe we would,
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve breathes against the side of his head, his hands grasping at Tony tightly, holding him on the ground.
Peter’s arms wrap around him, and he groans as he heaves Tony into an upright position, gasping as a rush of blood flows out over the ruined undersuit.
“There are a lot of things about this that are unclear,” Tony retorts. “But we’re not talking about it, are we?”
The front door to the cottage opens, and Steve Rogers steps out. Tony stares at him between parted fingers, through the rain spattered windshield – drinks him in like he’s desperate for water – or whiskey, he hopes Steve has brought whiskey.
He nearly bumps into Steve as he gets into the ring, caught up in his own thoughts. Steve steadies him with a red glove to the shoulder, pressing the gold mouth guard into the palm of Tony’s black glove.
Tony turns his head, giving Steve a sardonic smile, the faint bruises on his neck now visible over the collar of his dress shirt. Steve’s eyes widen slightly, his jaw tensing, and his voice is low when he speaks.
Driving on the opposite side of the road is quite the learning curve, Tony realizes, as he almost dies twice on his long drive up from Edinburgh to Inverness. At Inverness, he stops at a café to get a coffee, hoping that the caffeine will jolt his brain into working properly. It must not be working properly because here he is, driving to the cottage that Steve wants to meet at – a cottage that is secluded, it had taken Tony two minutes of rapid clicking the arrow down the road to find the next dwelling on Google Maps, at least five miles away
“I’ve got enough rest,” Steve tries to wave his right arm, his fingers still numb, but it remains motionless at his side. He tries to snap his fingers sometimes, like he had with the gauntlet on, but they don’t even twitch. He had been offered a prosthetic – but that would involve an amputation. Nothing they could create here would be as good as what Tony would create – so why bother? Tony will fix his arm. Hell, he’ll probably create synthetic nerves and reroute Steve’s entire peripheral nervous system.
“You’re crazy. You’d kill me. I’m not stupid, Steve, and this -,” he waves his glove over his face, “This is a priceless face. You’d be in debt for the rest of your life, with the amount of bills you’d get from my plastic surgeon.”
“You were out like a light,” Tony says, but he sounds guilty – he sounds as though he had just been caught running out the door without saying goodbye. Steve thinks that had he not woken up for another moment, he would have woken up alone.
“Seriously, Rogers, have you been injecting growth hormones directly? This is gonna take a lot of foreplay.”
.” Venom drips from Tony’s voice, and Steve is the one to recoil, looking out the glass door at the parking garage. “You want me to bust my skull open? Jesus. I’ll rent a car.”
“How’s Nat? She dropped off the radar – I figured she’s with you.” He asks, to distract himself from these thoughts, picking up another oyster. If he keeps thinking like this, he’ll walk out of the restaurant, nausea twisting his insides as he recalls the grainy security camera footage of his mother –
Dr. Rodriguez shrugs, “Hard to say. At least a week, at my best guess.” He checks his watch, “Alright – if you’re gonna see him tonight, we’d better make it quick.” He gets to his feet and walks to the door, looking over his shoulder at Steve expectantly when he doesn’t rise from the seat. “Captain Rogers?”
Steve’s cell phone starts to vibrate on the nightstand, and Tony glances at it in disgust, returning his attention to Steve’s smooth jaw. Steve does his best to ignore it, instead focusing on the way Tony arches into his touch. Tony’s lips press down his throat, pausing at the necklace – nosing the dog tags and the ring, but he says nothing.
Tony will boldly reach between them and unzip Steve’s jeans, touch greedy, and then he’ll pause. Steve will watch as Tony’s tongue darts out over his bottom lip, his mouth suddenly dry.
Tony gets to his feet, and all of the hair collected on the towel falls to the tile floor. Steve groans, running a hand over his face. He’ll have to dig the vacuum cleaner out of the closet. It will take forever to vacuum up every strand, the vacuum was ancient and struggled to suck up anything at all.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice is soft, the voice he uses when it is just the two of them. The door to the med bay closes behind him, and Tony is dimly aware of blood staining Steve’s suit. Fresh blood.
“My mom taught me,” Tony says casually, making his way over to his bedroom so that he can change. Steve is thankful for that, he doesn’t think he can keep his desire in check were Tony to walk around the house in just his swimsuit. “A few recipes, anyways. Did you shop?”
Tony pulls his hands away from Steve’s chest, staring up at him, trying to comprehend. “You – You risked yourself, for… ?”
“I have to, Buck – not just because of – of – but, I can’t live life knowing that you’re out there, suffering, when I could…”
Two words, that’s all Steve thought Tony was worth – but perhaps he’s being uncharitable. He knew, of course, about Steve and Peggy’s relationship. His Aunt Peggy always softened when she mentioned Captain America, there was always a slight curve of her lips upwards when she said his name. Steve. So softly, reverently almost – like they had shared something secret. The same sort of secret thing Tony had shared with Steve less than 48 hours ago.
“Oh, yeah,” Steve’s smiling, he can hear it in his voice. “Yeah, Ma would let me out for twenty minutes at a time – you know, the cold was bad for my lungs, but my allergies were better when it snowed. Buck and I -,” Steve pauses, breathing in deeply, preparing himself for a tirade from Tony – but nothing comes from the other man. “Tony?”
Tony shakes his head, nanites forming into a pair of sunglasses that he puts over his face. “Nope. I’m gonna tan – and nap. You can eat though, Cap, by all means.”
Tony slips under the ropes of the ring, dancing around the mat, trying to work out some of his anxious energy.
The pain in his chest is worse now, as Natasha quickly guides him into the building, through the throng of reporters.
“Ah…” Tony takes a large gulp of coffee. “Yeah, he said no. Did you hear about what happened with Toomes?”
But Tony wants Steve’s arms around him again, wants Steve to cover his body in adoring kisses – wants to feel the rush that comes when Steve thrusts into him with a groan of his name –
“And I slept with him – like an absolute idiot.” He reaches up with his free hand to run it over his eyes, brushing aside tears. “Oh, Pep, I was an idiot. I slept with him, he lied to me, and he didn’t even give a damn.”
“You gonna use those on your hands?” Steve asks, watching Tony as he drops the box in his surprise, though Steve catches it easily before it hits the ground. “Didn’t know I cut you. I kinda thought it was the other way around.”
Tony’s nose nudges his dog tags, and Steve feels him laugh against his sweat-damp skin. “Christ. You really are always wearing these things,” Tony says fondly, and after a moment, he’s snoring softly against Steve’s chest.
Tony sets his mug down, finger ghosting around the rim of the ceramic. “I haven’t spent that much on a haircut in five years. But I’m a little shaggy, Steve, and I wouldn’t mind tidying up. I can do it myself, I just – you know, another set of eyes, might be able to even things out.”
We can’t even – legally – get married while that’s happening.” Tony holds up a second finger, ticking each reason off as he goes. “Secondly, I think you’re mistaking distance for deeper feelings.”
“Safe and sound. Snug as a bug in a rug. Though, if I were a bug in a rug, I’d be worried about getting stepped on. So is that considered snug…?”
Steve closes his eyes, forcing himself to try to rest, and he’s just drifting off when a heavy vibration rumbles through his wooden nightstand. He keeps the flip phone charged – just as he did while he and Tony were meeting in secret – a desperate, quiet hope that Tony would call him. He is the only one to know the number. Steve’s eyes open, lifting his head up from the pillow, squinting at the nightstand in disbelief. The vibration continues.
“You want me to carry you?” Steve has his hands on Tony’s hips, lifting him up off the ground without waiting to hear Tony’s answer. Tony gasps in surprise, his stomach flipping at the sudden loss of contact with the floor.
“The one who fell off the train?” Tony’s eyebrows raise, and Pepper shrugs. “Steve and I have talked about more than just you and the Avengers, Tony.”
“Jesus, fuck! How did you do that!” Tony massages his chest, looking at Steve, expecting to see him doing the same – but Steve’s face is expressionless.
Peter swallows, nods, and then points over the edge of the platform they’re standing on. “But – What about the wizard?”
Tony raises his hand, waving slightly, and Steve grins when he sees him. He regards the supersoldier over the edge of his wine glass, wondering why the hell he had a duffel bag with him.
“I don’t think we can do anything about this, unless you want me to shave the other half of your head?”
No sex will be easy, Steve convinces himself as he pushes eggs around on the frying pan. In fact, his line of reasoning continues, no sex will allow them to enjoy each other’s company on a level they’ve not had the opportunity to reach before. Carefully, Steve scoops the eggs onto the plate that holds a few slices of toast and some bacon. A greasy breakfast, hopefully greasy enough to mop up Tony’s hangover.
Steve hooks his arms under Tony’s armpits and hauls him to his feet gracelessly – Tony cries out and slumps against him, nearly falling again. With a grunt, Steve has Tony in his arms, his legs dangling over Steve’s left forearm.
Sam offers to take all the Stones back to their rightful place, and Steve is finally out of the med bay for that meeting. His chest and abdomen still ache, and the mottled burns look terrible – but it’s all okay, because he’s going to see Tony again. Very soon.
His fingers clumsily probe the raised scar tissue from where Thanos had stabbed him, and pain swells from his touch.
“No, I’m not gonna wear that shit,” Tony calls after him, though he feels as though he’s floating above himself.
“You’re okay,” Steve repeats, hand still slowly stroking Tony through his orgasm, the other man rocking into his touch. “I’ve got you.”
He stares down at the blue light faintly shining through the black t shirt he’s wearing – his usual ugly Christmas sweater is in his closet, he couldn’t bring himself to wear it. Reinstalling the reactor – well, that had been a stroke of mad genius. His false sternum held more nanites than he could possibly hope to fit in it, and the casing of the reactor held the rest. He had nearly passed out in the bathtub as he had cut thin lacerations into his chest, the needle into his false sternum painless, but the magnets he had slid under his skin agonizing. When his world had come back into focus, thin streams of blood ran down his chest, but the reactor hummed – a quiet promise of power.
“I’m on the roof,” Tony breathes, looking down at the ground again – it doesn’t seem so far away now, and the snow would catch him, surely. It would cushion his fall. It wouldn’t be so bad, to jump.
“Sorry,” Steve manages to pull his gaze away, his cheeks flushed pink. He nearly looks Tony in the eyes, but his gaze falls upon the reactor in his chest. It’s a different design than Steve remembers – triangular, sleek, the blue light laced over by streaks of silver metal. Surrounding the reactor are fading bruises, Tony’s battered chest now covered in a few more scars. Steve almost drops the plate of breakfast.
“I hate you,” Tony says heatedly, brown eyes so dark that they’re almost black. “I hate you – I shouldn’t have to worry about you getting your dumb ass caught! You think – I know you
Tony spits out his own mouth guard, panting, grabbing the Velcro of his glove between his teeth and tearing it. His boxing gloves thump against the mat, his swollen, wrapped hands clenched in trembling fists at his sides.
“Ugh,” Tony sighs as he sits up properly, stretching his arms over his head. “The stuff you say is sickeningly sappy sometimes, Steve. Like… I’m literally nauseous.”
“Your optimism is so…” Tony shakes his head, reaching up to rub at his bearded jaw. “You’re still asleep, Cap. Still frozen. It’s time to wake up. This is reality now – it’s just… Death, and emptiness.”
Some Hamilton thing, Tony remembers wildly – Peter had not shut up about the musical for weeks, even after Tony had given him tickets to go see it with Aunt May. He had buzzed in Tony’s ear for hours, excitedly detailing his upcoming school fieldtrip to where Hamilton had been shot.
They meet four more times in Paris – and just as Steve shuts the door to the apartment behind him on the fourth visit, Tony is there, kissing him furiously.
“You know how to make fresh pasta?” Steve can’t stop himself from asking, he wonders if Tony will ever stop surprising him.
Tony shakes his head slowly, a stray tear trickling down the side of his face, cutting a clear path through the blood. “No, no… It’s in my hotel room. Didn’t bring it out with me. Christ, Steve, they had a bat.” Tony laughs, spraying Steve’s hands with a light dusting of blood. “A baseball bat. Can you believe that?”
Tony might as well lay all his cards out on the table. “No, our accommodation has been arranged,” he replies, words curt. “Christ, Steve, you cut to the chase, don’t you?”
Tony’s suit is crumpled on the floor, and Steve wonders if he had left the compound in his shorts and tank top – if he had fled from the very idea of kissing Steve with such desperation that he had left behind a no doubt incredibly expensive bespoke suit. He picks it up off the floor, slinging the trousers over his arm, moving to one of the lockers to find a hanger. Tony’s car keys spill out of the pocket of his trousers, jangling on the floor, and Steve can’t help but smile again. So, Tony was still here – good, they’d have to talk. Tony’s cologne wafts off of the suit as Steve hangs it up in the locker, and he finds himself leaning towards it, breathing in the scent deeply. Tony’s fingers had curled against his back, bunching the fabric of his tank top in his hand, Steve had felt blunt fingernails digging through the fabric and into his skin. He blushes, pulling away from the suit, shaking his head in an effort to clear it. He ought to find Tony, he decides, leaning down to pick up his keys. Just to give him his keys, nothing more than that.
They walk quietly down the street towards Central Park, and Tony still isn’t used to the silence that has now invaded New York City. He misses the honking horns, the shouted curses, the bright lights. Everything is muted, reserved – everything except…
“My reactor,” Tony says hoarsely, his voice barely more than a rasp. “Steve – you need – I need… My reactor.”
He makes quick work of Tony’s tank top, throwing it to the floor, and Steve’s hands are on his bare skin. His fingers dance up the bumps of Tony’s spine, they dig into the forming bruises on Tony’s ribs, and Tony gasps into his mouth.
Pepper is furious, he can tell by the whiteness of her knuckles as she grasps the handles of the wheelchair and pushes him into the dining room.
“You’re not gonna tell me where, are you?” Rhodey sounds resigned, not even disappointed. “Are you doing something stupid?”
“Mr. Stark?” One of Thaddeus Ross’ young, fresh faced, terrified interns is standing at his shoulder. “It’s time for the ratification process. Secretary Ross wants you to attend.”
“You’re not going to kill me,” Tony agrees, removing vials of soil and rock from his pocket. “But I’m going to die.”
“Oh, embarrassed, are we? Lying to my face, that’s easy, but when faced with a little scolding, Steve Rogers runs the other way. Dear old Dad never mentioned that Captain America was a coward – but he spent his whole life licking your boots, so his mouth was a little busy.”
i swear to god this started as a one shot but at this point it is writing itself!!! help!!! i have no idea where this is going so come along for the ride i guess. also, tony, that was inappropriate to say in an office setting!!!
“Tony, wait,” Steve rubs at his ear, the skin red – he reaches out with his other hand, his fingers brushing against Tony’s back as he hurries to the front door. “No, Tony, don’t go.”
Tony follows behind Steve in his new rental car – he had accepted the first thing offered to him, a black Audi. The sunlight shines on Steve’s hair as he drives ahead to their destination, and Tony glowers, thinking of Steve’s beautiful blonde hair in bloody strands along the pavement.
. “But I also – couldn’t…” Though, thank God, the nightmares had lessened. On the flight over, he had slept the whole way through, after two Xanax. “But you don’t have to worry about that tonight, anyways. ‘Cause I’ve paid for it. So…”
“Marry me,” he repeats, Tony stirring against his chest. He feels Tony’s lips form a frown against his skin, and watches as he lifts his head up to look at Steve. Steve reaches up and brushes his fingers through Tony’s dark, messy curls, still damp with sweat.
“Which one is that?” Rhodey asks lightly, watching him walk away. “There are just so many.” He laughs as Tony flicks him off without looking back, but his expression turns troubled – whenever Tony kept something from him, it was usually bad news. It was usually life threatening.
“Do you always wear these things?” Tony asks, his fingers idly playing with the dog tags resting against Steve’s chest.
Steve nods, though he’s not really listening. “How long do you think he’ll need to be in the hospital for?”
“Read something crazy,” Steve says, crossing his arms over his chest, watching Tony eat his gelato. “Something about the Tower getting sold.”
The Jaguar’s engine revs wildly, Tony throwing the gearshift into reverse and backing out without even checking that the way is clear. Steve stands at the foot of the drive, watching Tony speed off, wondering where they go from here.
Steve had shattered the team with one effortless arc of his shield into Tony’s chest, the reactor shattering with it. The stupid fucking wedding ring Steve had given him in Italy is cool against his rapidly warming skin, clinking against the dog tags around his neck. Tony doesn’t wear it in public, of course not, but he keeps it around his throat instead.
“Ten,” Tony replies guiltily, moving away from Steve so he can sit at the table. He gives Steve a look when the other man sits across from him and pats his lap, one that tells Steve not to push his luck.
Tony stands behind the car door, using it as a shield. There are shadows under Steve’s eyes, like he hasn’t been sleeping, and his face is drawn in. He’s wearing a black sweater tucked into grey trousers, and Tony’s eyes roam over the broad expanse of his chest, despite his best intentions.
“I’m terrible at stitches,” Tony says suddenly, wiping away the excess rubbing alcohol with the pad of gauze, pressing it hard against the cut. “You’d think I’d be good at them, with all the work I do with my hands. But – I don’t know – my work is never as gentle as stitches are. I always end up with sloppy zig-zags, and ugly scars, so… Butterfly bandages are my best solution.” He’s babbling, nervous. The box rips as Tony tries to open it, and he curses under his breath. “Fuck’s sake."
“There’s a…” Tony looks down at their feet, “I’ve never not led before – this is weird – jazz club down the street. I didn’t think anyone would be playing this early.”
Tony rolls his eyes and taps the center of the reactor, a thick stream of metallic fluid traveling up his neck – and Steve blinks as Tony’s head is suddenly encased in a helmet. Tony cocks his head, illuminated eye slits regarding Steve coldly.
Tony holds his hand up, finally moving it away from the light in his chest, and Steve relaxes imperceptibly.
“Steve,” Tony returns his attention to him now that they are alone. “C’mon. Thanos came here with his daughter – and left without her, but with the Soul Stone. Gamora isn’t playing hide and seek, you heard Red Skull -.”
Tony rubs at his tired eyes as he steps into the stairwell, the air incredibly warm compared to what he had endured outside. His feet carry him down the stairs, walking without purpose – at least, he doesn’t think he has a purpose as he falls face-first onto Steve’s bed.
“No,” Steve shakes his head, resting his hands on his knees. “I just wish you found someone else’s motorcycle to work on.”
Steve steps forward, sighing in exasperation. “Tony, it’s cold out. Come inside, I’ve got a fire going.”
Steve crosses his own arms over his chest, his jaw set. “Come on, Tony, I’m serious. Can’t we just… put a pin in it? Just for right now – I came to check on you, you said you had a headache.”
“Hey, Tony,” he keeps his voice soft, resting his hand on Tony’s shoulder. One side of his head is wrapped in fresh white gauze, and Tony’s eyes move sluggishly to look at him. There’s an intensity there that Steve wasn’t anticipating, Tony had just been beaten half to death and gone through a challenging surgery, but his grip on Steve’s wrist is strong enough that Steve winces.
Natasha glances at him out of the corner of her eye, noticing the anxious thrum of his fingertips against his thigh.
Tony’s eyes fix on the shield now, reaching out again, crying out at the pain, his metal-encased fingers leaving scratches in the concrete as he drags himself to the shield.
“I made a lot of anonymous donations – to orphanages for children who lost their parents when… I think that was my… I mean, I don’t exactly have a favorite thing about… But, if I had to pick – I made some kids’ lives better. At least I could do that.” Tony’s lips curve upwards, but he’s not smiling. Steve forces himself to unclasp his hands, reaching out to run his fingers over Tony’s forearm.
True to his word, Steve has Tony on the verge of tears before he finally gives him what he wants, what he needs – what he came here for.
“He killed my parents!” Tony’s voice cracks as he shouts, and he stops himself before he can lob the empty glass at Steve’s self-righteous head.
Tony walks slowly towards the locker room, his thoughts running wild, not all of them appropriate. Steve Rogers standing in the shower, now
Tony rests for over a week, sleeping deeply and rarely talking – Steve and Pepper rarely leave his bedside, even when he’s sleeping. On the eighth day, Pepper leans down and kisses Tony on the forehead, tears trickling down her cheeks.
“Your stomach was rumbling while you slept,” Tony mutters, turning to the door. “I’m going to go and get us some breakfast. You just stay there and relax,” he looks over his shoulder at him, gaze lingering on Steve until his cheeks flush pink. “You’re cute when you blush,” are Tony’s parting words, said with a cheeky grin.
“He has to do it,” Bucky speaks up at his right. “It’s just putting the Stones back, right? He’s strong enough for that. And he can take his time.”
“Eager,” Tony tsks, looking over at a quiet park to the right. “God, I wish it was daylight. The colors on the leaves are beautiful. Hey, let’s stop in there…”
Steve gets to work on the dishes, looking up from the pan he’s scrubbing when he hears slow and hesitant notes coming from the piano. He arches up on his tip toes, craning his head around the wall, and catches sight of the back of Tony’s head – he’s sat at the piano, his hands hovering over the keys, seemingly conflicted.
“And then I met you – and there’s the rub – you hated me the moment you laid eyes on me. Just my luck, right? Ever since I was 15, I had the biggest fucking – infatuation, with you – I kept a fucking Captain America poster above my bed at MIT, for Christssakes.”
“Birthday present?” Rhodey asks from where he’s sat at the table, rubbing idly at his sore abdomen – he’s able to walk with the braces, staggering steps, but it definitely is a new demand on the muscles of his core to hold himself upright.
Tony struggles, getting to his knees, and then he vomits across the sidewalk. It smells strongly of alcohol and blood.
Afterwards, once he’s caught his breath, he climbs off of Tony with the intent of getting a washcloth from the bathroom to clean up. Tony tackles him back against the mattress, moving with shocking speed and expending force Steve didn’t know that he had.
“What floor are we going to?” Steve stares into his eyes, his hands bracing against Tony’s back, the keys cold against his hot skin. Tony swallows, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist, his fingers laced together at the nape of his neck.
that Tony will be wearing a tailored suit. Just the thought of Tony in a suit makes his mouth dry, his heartbeat picking up in his chest. So many buttons for Steve to undo…
Tony gasps, “You’re kidding. Voldemort, from Harry Potter? Please don’t say you’ve not read it, or seen the movies… Actually, please say you haven’t seen the movies so that we can binge them when we get home.”
“We have to stick together, Tony,” Steve’s hand is on his foot, his touch gentle through the blanket that covers Tony’s body. “As a team – if we stick together, we’ll be able to think of something. We always have.”
Steve’s tongue brushes over the indents his teeth have left behind on Tony’s skin, sure to bruise. “Jesus, Stark. Do you ever shut up?”
“Absolutely not wearing them,” Tony repeats, but he doesn’t move to pull them up over his head as Steve had feared.
Steve’s blood patters against the fabric, there’s a long cut from his eyebrow to the top of his cheekbone, and it looks pretty deep.
“No, you moron. I sold it because I didn’t need it anymore. Pep found her own apartment in the city – we split the cash fifty-fifty, she helped me build it, so.” Tony shrugs. “I’ve got the compound now. The compound…” Tony frowns, picking up his fresh cappuccino. “I’d like to sell it, too. We need to downsize. With only three active Avengers…”
The dog tags clink dully as he slips the necklace back over his head, the metal still burning hot against his skin. Every part of his body hurts, and he should go to bed before he does real damage to himself.
Tony looks at him with raised eyebrows, fork still in his mouth. “Yes. They tortured me, Cap. Didn’t you read that in my S.H.I.E.L.D. dossier? I didn’t spend my entire time there building my first suit like it was Build-A-Bear-Workshop. They did all kinds of things, a lot of it I don’t really remember.” Tony closes his eyes for a moment, recalling Pepper’s scream of his name – he remembers that clearly. “But their favorite was waterboarding. And God, the water was cold. I had a car battery hooked up to my chest, all sorts of exposed wiring, and I never once was shocked when they dumped me in. I used to hope that today would be the day, you know, that someone dropped the battery in the water and I just got fried. But it never happened, and when I got back home, I couldn’t take a shower for days. I still can’t get my face wet for too long, or I… I don’t – it’s stupid.”
He laughs, though he shouldn’t, and there’s no humor in it. Lately, he’s been self-medicating in an attempt to stop the nightmares. Steve would murmur his name in his ear while he slept, his lips would burn against his throat, and then he would slam the shield into Tony’s chest over and over again until he woke up shaking and sweating – tears burning in his eyes. No amount of scotch seemed to do the trick, nor vodka.
“There can be whatever modifications you want, Steve. Just sign it now – sign it now, and Romania gets swept under the rug. Barnes can get proper treatment in the States. I can let Wanda out, everything can go back to normal."
Tony laughs, a strangled sound. He reaches out and steadies the swinging punching bag, wishing there was someone there to steady him.
The following morning, Steve feels no pain as he climbs out of bed, which is a first. He puts on the red, white, and black suit he’s not worn since he had stood on the edge of the cliff in Vormir, watching Tony’s blood spread rapidly across the grey soil. So vibrant, so alive – too much blood, all of his blood. The fingers of his right hand tingle, he can feel the bones of Tony’s skull shifting at his touch. Steve swallows back bile.
He opens his eyes, looking into Steve’s – Steve, whose hand is unzipping his jeans. Steve, who had left him in the cold to die.
Tonight, Steve can’t sleep – which is truthfully no different from any other night. He had attended a grief meeting in the early evening, and had taken the long way back to the brownstone apartment he had bought for himself shortly after Tony had disappeared from the Avengers compound. It had been an exhausting day – leading these meetings always left him feeling empty and cold, and when he came home, the apartment was empty and cold, too.
Steve stares at him in silence, and Tony feels like he’s wearing nothing at all – he’s used to undressing other people with his eyes, not being on the receiving end.
“I know, Soul Stone, I know. But – I would have done the same on Titan had things not gone the way they did. This is an entirely new planet to me, Steve. Vormir,” Tony drags the word out on his tongue, it feels sharp – dangerous, even – which is ridiculous, it’s just a word.
be easy. Steve’s eyes widen as he opens the door to Tony’s bedroom and sees Tony standing in front of him in a crimson Speedo.
He traces over the indents, barely there, and recalls the warmth of Steve’s tongue as he had soothed the bite slowly. Tony’s hand brushes down the front of his chest, fingers rising and falling over the bumps of his ribs, wincing at the slight pressure against dark purple bruises. Steve had not provided any comfort for those, no, he had swung at Tony’s body with such force that this morning he had almost cried taking his first deep breath.
Tony chokes on his coffee, spraying some on the table – the elderly woman behind the counter looks at him and he waves his hand casually. Though it trembles – and the coffee has stained his red cashmere sweater. He wipes up the mess he’s made on the table, and wipes his sweater though it’s a lost cause.
“You didn’t need to come help, I had it under control. You listen to me, Peter – are you listening?”
He had not served as the CEO of Stark Industries for over ten years without picking up a few skills, here and there. He knew how to parse his way through the garbled language of government, knew how to find the stipulations that had been hidden away in some clause or another, shrunk down in an effort to escape his narrowed eyes. The Sokovia Accords are pristine – yes, there are some things he’s uncomfortable with – does he really need to contact the United Nations and the Department of State if he wants to fly a suit from Manhattan to Newark? Yes, he supposes as he rolls one of his father’s fountain pens between his palms, yes – some of the regulations are intrusive.
“It’s not as good as when my mom makes it,” Tony sighs, rubbing a hand over his forehead. He reaches behind to the back of his neck and prods his sunburn, a hiss of air escaping between his gritted teeth.
“Come on, Stark,” Steve’s feet dance around him, the mat bouncing under his weight – Tony feels like a rag doll thrown onto a trampoline. “Get up.”
“My reactor – key is in…” Tony turns his head slowly to the other side, there’s a plastic bag containing the clothes he had been brought to the hospital in. “Pocket.”
“I was selfish.” Steve says, lifting the lid of the piano and picking a key at random. Tony winces at the window despite himself, how could Steve choose something so atonal at random? “You’re right. I ask too much. I can’t go back in time and fix things. I wish I could.  Because you were right about the Accords, too.”
Sweat trickles down the back of his neck, and Bruce Banner looks at him like he’s not speaking English.
“Okay,” Steve murmurs, his lips brushing over the nape of Tony’s neck, wishing he could see the other man’s face. He presses against Tony again, and grins when the other man grinds back against him. Steve’s fingers brush across his chest, over the cold glass front of the reactor, dancing across a hardened nipple. Tony takes another shallow breath.
No trust, he had said. He had called Steve a liar – and wasn’t that the truth? All Steve ever did was lie to him – whether it was about his parents, or his intentions, or loving Tony, or saying that he wants to marry him.
Steve frowns, Tony’s hands slipping down to grab at his bicep, leading him down the hallway to their room.
The vitals monitor is blaring again, and his world is slipping away from him, silky like Steve’s hair between his fingers.
“There is no later!” The ice pack falls from Tony’s hands as he reaches out and grabs Steve by the shoulders, his expression one of wild intensity. “Do I have to punch it into you? Is that the only way you understand?” He shakes Steve’s shoulders weakly, suddenly realizing how close he is to Steve’s face. He can feel the heat radiating off of his skin. “There is no later.”
“In the years I’ve known you?” Pepper cocks her head, her fingers gently trailing over the back of his hand, mindful of the IV needle. “At least twelve.”
Rhodey had invited him over to his mother’s for Christmas, noticing the way Tony was wandering lost around the compound, his hand occasionally moving to a slight lump under his shirt. He was wearing a necklace of some sort, Rhodey could see the metal beads that made up the chain around his neck – but Rhodey was also concerned about the faint blue light visible through the fabric of Tony’s shirt. Tony had declined his invitation, how could he look into the eyes of Rhodey’s mother, as the man who had effectively paralyzed her son?
Steve’s fingers brush against the bare skin of his back, having slipped up under his untucked shirt. They press into his skin purposefully, Tony knows he’ll have bruises there tomorrow. Steve’s gift to him is always bruises.
“Marry me,” Steve murmurs into Tony’s ear, the other man crying out beneath him as he comes. Steve follows not long after him, closing his eyes and allowing himself to get lost in the pleasure that washes over him – frantic, hot, and perfect.
Steve watches Tony for a few minutes, watches as Tony lights a candle and sits down at the edge of the aisle seat in front of the altar. He turns away when Tony bows his head, not wanting to intrude on something that feels incredibly private.
“I do know how to use Google, Tony,” Steve replies sharply, “But I don’t need it to know that you’re drunk right now. Drunk and probably doing something dangerous. Where are you?”
“It’s okay, Pepper.” Tony grabs at the sheets, struggling to pull himself upright. “He needs to hear it from me, fine. He won’t like what I have to say – but Captain America wants a debrief. Has to have it now, right Steve? Always asking for too much.”
He lets go of Steve’s hand as they step onto the main path of the park, reaching out to rub his fingers over the white petals of a hydrangea. He leans in and breathes in the scent of the flowers deeply, until he sneezes. Steve laughs quietly at his side, patting him on the back.
The flip phone on the nightstand buzzes, and Steve’s hand shoots out to grab it – there is only one person who would be calling him.
“It’s a glowing rock,” Tony corrects, reaching over and shoving it into Steve’s pocket. Steve grumbles, brushing him aside with his shoulder, but he doesn’t bother removing it. “You’ve got more pocket space,” Tony nudges him playfully, “I’ve got too many samples.”
“Yeah, I’m here, Cap.” Tony’s thighs tremble, everything below his knees seems not to be operating, he sways dangerously as snowflakes land in his hair.
Tony jumps, wrench clattering across the sidewalk, and he shades his eyes as he looks up at Steve. “Oh, Christ, I thought you were sleeping.”
“My…” He blinks again, eyes narrowing, sudden clarity – Steve relaxes. “Oh, right, my haircut. Where to, Cap?”
Tony opens the door, stepping out of the car, his shoes crunching against the gravel. Steve walks out to meet him, slowly, like he’s afraid Tony will bolt at any sudden movement.
“That’s it,” Tony says soothingly. “You’re okay. I promise.” He kisses Steve on the lips, which are terribly dry, and Steve’s tears are salty and hot against his tongue. Steve’s hands tremble at his sides, and Tony knows he wants to reach out and pull him back to safety – and if he doesn’t act quickly, Steve will do just that.
“So much for togetherness, huh, Cap?” He slurs, letting the chain slip between his fingers, the gunmetal tags hovering dangerously close to the flames. He could just let them go, he could watch them burn and be done with it. Toss the flip phone into the flames for good measure, the flip phone that felt as heavy in his pocket as the shackles on his wrists would feel once they were found out.
“About this?” Steve steps back to allow Tony into the elevator. The moment the doors slide shut, Tony’s hands cup his face, his lips pressing to Steve’s softly.
“Yeah, that one. He worked for HYDRA, apparently – was an assassin for them. Did a damn good job, too, assassinating my parents. Brainwashed, Steve said – not aware of what he was doing. But Steve knew. This whole time, Steve knew that my parents were killed. And he knew who did it, and he knew that Barnes was alive.”
“Guess I’ve never been hit that hard before,” Steve says, his eyes on Tony. The other man stands so stock-still, so tense, Steve wants to draw him – but he doesn’t think he’d do it justice, how could someone be so tense?
The fork is pointing at him again threateningly. “Don’t Tony me. Eat your dinner. I don’t want to hear you complaining in the middle of the night that you’re hungry because everything will be closed, and I’m not getting out of bed before dawn to get you something to eat.”
“Bet he shoved her off the edge,” Tony says cheerfully, and Steve shoots him a look. Tony’s expression grows solemn, “Don’t worry, Steve, I won’t shove you off of the edge. Promise.”
Pepper catches his wrist, gently pulling his hand away before he causes some damage. “You had to have your sternum replaced. It was cracked in two. It’s lucky you keep such excellent documentation on your health, Mr. Stark,” Pepper gives him a tired smile. “They were able to craft a new one from your blueprints. You had a punctured lung, too, and that will take time to heal. A few cracked ribs. A concussion.”
He collects the briefcase by his dresser, an unassuming item considering the six Infinity Stones within – but that’s not all. Cash, credit cards, a California state driver’s license, a Social Security card – all registered under the name Grant Stevens. Tony would laugh himself to tears, face red, and wheeze that Steve had no creativity. Steve smiles slightly, hefting the briefcase in his left hand. Tony will see right through it, and Tony will call him Steve – that’s all that matters.
When Tony wakes, he’s lying on one of the beds in the med bay. There’s an IV in the back of his hand, and Tony squints at the IV rack beside his head.
“No wonder that you’re not getting any, then, looks uncomfortable as hell.” Steve scoots over on the bed, his arms wrapping around Tony’s waist, pulling the other man close to him.
“It’s not snowing here,” Steve says casually, and Tony can hear him shift in bed as he looks out the window. “Wish it was – I loved Brooklyn in the snow. Made it feel like a different place, something out of a fairytale.”
“No, it’s fine…” Steve cuts into his filet, looking satisfied as it melts beneath his knife. “I just – feel bad about that night, like I… was pressuring you into something you didn’t want.”
“Feels that way, sometimes,” Steve says as he grabs Tony’s left hand, feeling the tension searing off of his skin. “When I get up in the morning, sometimes I feel like I’m fighting against my own body as well as gravity. It takes some getting used to.” Steve carefully starts to unwrap Tony’s hand, wincing at the swollen red flesh underneath. “You ever punch someone that hard?”
“Ugh, you charlatan,” Tony mutters, knocking Steve’s hand aside. He picks up the lemon wedge, squeezing an ample amount of juice over the oyster before picking it up and handing it to him. “Swallow – you’re good at that.”
“Yeah, oh,” Tony’s voice is tenuous, sounding on the brink of hysteria or frantic, breathless laughter.
, 1991. It will be cold, the treacherous driving conditions had been blamed in addition to Howard Stark’s BAC level. Fighting the Winter Soldier will be difficult without the shield, but he’s prepared – he will render Bucky unconscious and drag him into the woods where his car will be stored. From there, they’ll hide out in Brooklyn, and Steve can take a few years to rehabilitate him. Tony will be far too young for Steve to introduce himself in 1991 –  just 21. Steve ignores the doubts at that thought, that Tony Stark – with those big brown eyes and clean shaven face, will look at him and see an older man with a useless arm and scarring down his neck. No, Steve shakes his head slightly.
