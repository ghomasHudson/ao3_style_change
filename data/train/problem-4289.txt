“I know, but we have to make do with what we have,” he replied and Jack nodded. He was quiet for a long while and Cas slowly but surely felt the boy fall asleep, his chest rising and falling, nestled against his father.
Dean stared into the darkness, observing yet again the sleeping Jack and Claire. She had reached over, instinctively in her sleep, and wrapped her arm around her little brother, pulling him to her like a teddy bear. The image called up Sam and himself so sharply in his brain it was uncanny. If he squinted it could’ve been the two of them, holed up in some motel room in a town they were passing through with his dad looking for work. He remembered all the promises he made himself around them, how he was never going to make half of the same mistakes his father had, how he would never want them to know fear like that. A voice in his head, soft and insistent (and while he was imagining it as Cas’s he knew it came from within Dean himself), whispered “if they don’t deserve it, why did you?” And the easy answer was because he was bad and stupid, too slow, careless, and selfish, but he knew the falseness in all of that. He turned up towards Cas and noticed he too was staring at their children, fondness and longing in his eyes.
As she stood on the staircase to her room Anna tore open the letter. The words stared down at her. Yelling at her.
“Oh, come on! He’s seventeen, right? Surely he can be left home alone a night or something?” She gave him a knowing smile as she spoke. “With me and Terrence, I mean we had this little dry spell for a few years when June was fifteen and it was just torture. You can’t be going this long without any action.”
he thought, but did not say. “I was so hopeless I was going to do an unforgivable thing,” he added, and the image of the Colt being pointed to Kelly Kline’s head, the way her frightened but trusting eyes had gazed back at him, inadvertently entered his mind. Even after all he had done for her, he was still so disgusted with the man he had been then, so desperate to prove his worth that he would kill an innocent. “I wouldn’t have lasted long, not the way I was. You- you gave me purpose for the first time in years, reminded me of the hopes and dreams, the faith I had once had.”
For Cas’s part, his favorite moment of the day was when he washed the dishes in the morning, because out of the window above the sink he could watch Jack talking to Dean and wishing him a good day at work through the window of the truck right before he drove off. This came only second to the moment every night when Dean wound an arm around his waist after climbing into bed. He still didn’t sleep due to his grace, though it got weaker every day, but would often join Dean in his dreams instead (he’d been given blanket permission) erasing the nightmares as best as he could.
As he stepped outside the bright morning sun hit his eyes. He shaded them with his free hand to see what was outside and found himself facing a familiar face. Tall, confident, and dressed all in black, a scythe in her hand, he blinked at Billie. His arms felt empty and he realized Jack’s weight was gone from them.
Claire replied by tossing holy water in his face. Cas sputtered for a moment before being greeted with a second splash of borax. Jack shrieked as the cool liquid hit him.
“I had grown too big, my world view was too narrow. And there were things I wanted to find, to experience, that I wouldn’t have found safe at home, obeying my father, letting my brothers take care of me,” his father explained. “It was scary and it was hard, and at times I wished I hadn’t. At times I got badly hurt, but it was worth it.”
“I can tell you something though,” Cas said and Jack looked up at him. “Just because we’re here doesn’t mean we’ve been forgotten.”
it could be better, that maybe they could be the family they had been before. But something was broken and none of them knew how to fix it.
“Sorry sport, I don’t think we could pass you off as FBI, this is a pretty small town,” Dean said. “Maybe if I’m working something nearby.”
“You knew it was him?” The inspector asked again. Anna glanced back at her mother, who was standing in the room with her, a manicured hand gently on her shoulder. Naomi nodded down at her with encouragement.
“Please,” had been all Jack had been able to quietly get out, shaking lips, innocent eyes, a creature so good and so harmless that the injustice of it all crashed hard into Cas once again. The angels, however, didn’t seem to see it that way, and simply pushed the shaking body into the box laid before him. When confronted with that, as they began to drag him towards the sea and Cas away back towards the house, only then did Jack begin to cry. “No! Dad! Dad, please! Don’t let them!”
One morning (morning was a loose term, Cas wasn’t exactly ever sure what time it was or how the days were passing, all sort of just measured by when Jack was asleep or awake) Jack woke up crying. It wasn’t exactly an uncommon occurrence but it hadn’t come out of any sort of a nightmare or conversation, it had just happened. Cas began shushing him, smoothing his hair.
“He’s done everything to care for Sam.” Cas quietly interjected. And he knew it, he’d seen it all growing up, Sam was Dean’s whole life. The only thing on earth he had any faith in.
Ruby slapped the plate onto the ground and it shattered at their feet, cookies crumbling onto the floor and mingling with the ceramic. Anna watched it fall like it was nothing, though Ruby looked beside herself with rage. The door opened quickly and Sam rushed in. He, she noted, actually looked much the same. Large and handsome, though he had lost his thick dark hair at some point and used a pair of large thick glasses. Still, he had avoided service, she remembered, and she wondered if that was why he had aged better than most of the men she knew.
He had known, of course, how Dean felt. He had known when he had told him that he’d rather have him, cursed or not, and from all his prayers in purgatory. He had doubted it so little he would have let him kill him on the floor of the bunker and couldn’t hate him when he had thrown him out. Dean didn’t have to say it, it was there every time he had rubbed his back or touched his face or drifted over his hand or made him food that he didn’t even need to eat. It was there in how more and more in his prayers Dean was talking about Jack like he was their baby and not some abstract little creature foisted on them.
“Not insane, of course not sweetheart, not insane. But, perhaps you have an affliction, something treatable,” she paused, and dabbed his sweaty brow with her handkerchief. “You’re the baby of the family, all of us, we all want what’s best for you. You’ll understand when you’re older.”
With Jack making friends, Cas had been befriending their parents and his coworkers at the library in their new town (he had found he liked the work, had a good brain for organization, and it was all he had experience in anyway). He was participating in the PTA too, going to bake sales and such when he got time off. It was at one of those he was talking to a mom friend there when she had asked him something he’d never thought about before.
Cas was waiting on the porch when Dean and Jack came back from their fishing trip. He found himself on the porch all the time lately and loved it best of the whole house. It was the perfect inbetween of not constricting or suffocating as being inside sometimes was but not too far from the safety the house and the warding provided. He was in a curious state after being rescued and he knew it, not so different from when he had been recovering from the attack dog spell and felt unable to leave the bunker. But this time there was an added fear of confinement, a need to always see the sky and be reminded of his freedom. He was glad he didn’t sleep, every time Jack closed his eyes he knew he was back there.
“Do you wanna go fishing with me, Jack?” He asked him quietly. Jack looked up at him and blinked. “It’s just a real nice thing I like to do to clear my head. It won’t be too much fun but it could be a good way for us to spend a day. You interested? Just the two of us? We can pack peanut butter and honey sandwiches like you love me to make. It’ll be nice.”
The money was wired to him quietly from a “Leia Tolkein,” who he soon realized was Charlie. It was a lot and certainly not from any legal means. The memo with it was “expect this every few months, don’t worry about things.” He had wondered for a while how she could have possibly known then he remembered that on a recent phone call with Jody, she had intuited his dilemma and suddenly everything clicked into place. He knew exactly who Jody would’ve called if she thought he needed money. And that person would’ve known he was too proud to take any money from him of all people. Despite himself, Cas smiled at the money. It was a step he thought, a weird step after everything, but a step.
“When have they cared for that? No, it’s that Cousin Ruby is set to inherit quite a lot, no matter how the divorce falls, and they have their eye on her for you,” Anna enjoyed the shock in Cas’s face.
“Promise me, Claire,” he said. She felt a strange shiver down her spine. Ice cold guilt took over her bones as she assumed it must have overtaken him at just her age.
“I will,” Dean said and kissed him quickly, his lips reaching Cas’s own, hoping he could give him something, love, breath, hope, to keep him alive. Cas kept looking paler and paler. “I promise.”
He fixed their broken fence posts a week later and changed all the light bulbs the weekend after that. He spent an entire two weeks repainting the exterior of the house as it was chipping like no tomorrow and another week doing the whole insides, going over in the chipper yellow that Cas favored. They mostly kept out of each other’s hair, he assumed Cas found it understandably hard to see him, and he saw more of Jack than he did of Cas. He tried to be wary of him but it was hard with the little boy barrelling into his legs to greet him when he came by and hitting with a million rambled questions that he needed answered right away. He had begun to bring things along for him even, leftovers from his meal at a diner or some book he’d picked up in town or an action figure he saw in a shop window. Things Cas always said Jack had to say thank you for and eyed suspiciously once they were handed over but the child seemed to instantly cherish, collecting proudly in his room. For his part, Jack was often handing him little drawings or clay figures he’d made during the day that Dean would grunt out a thanks to and then tuck them safely into his memory box.
“I didn’t have a choice, Dean,” he told him and Dean shook his head and Cas wondered if he was close to tears, there was an unfamiliar glisten to his eyes.
“It’s not gonna be much longer, baby,” Dean said, trying to keep his voice steady and free of guilt. Cas, of course, could see through him right away.
He found Dean in the hallway, in his tails for serving dinner. He always looked out of place like that, since they’d have to lay off some of the staff and expand his duties. The moment their eyes met Dean seemed to understand, and followed him, silently, into the private of the library. Cas held the letter out to Dean, who took it with quiet shame.
Cas watched them. Never in his millenia of his life did he think he was getting this. He hadn’t even thought he was getting this yesterday morning. Now here he was. He would never take it for granted, he promised himself, not ever.
“Don’t give me that crap!” She almost shrieked it. “I’m strangely absent from your book you know. You don’t seem to care what happened to me after that night. It’s afforded a few sentences. I
“Go with him, Jack,” Cas told him. “It’s what I want and it’s the right thing. I never should have taken you in the first place. Do it.”
Cas never thought he had heard Dean beg before. Not for anything or from anyone. The leader sneered down at Dean.
“Not now it isn’t,” Dean replied. Cas could have screamed at him. Dean went for the buttons of his shirt, but Cas beat him to it. He briskly kicked off his shoes and socks and then unbuttoned his shirt, pulling it over his head, revealing his undershirt. Dean laughed. “Oh come on Cas you don’t have to.”
“We apologize for Mister Winchester, he usually knows not to barge into family matters,” said Naomi hurriedly.
“That’s not good enough! You betray me? Run off with some chick you barely knew? To raise the devil’s bastard? Why? Why couldn’t you tell me where you were?” Dean demanded, shaking him.
“Well, I thought, what if one day, because he fishes, he might find us one day? Pull us out?” Jack asked and Cas’s heart fell. “I mean who knows, right?”
They were texting more frequently than they had in years. Cas had especially texted Dean to tell him about a striking new development in Jack’s life: a boyfriend.
As if on cue, three demons came in through the door and began to head up the stairs behind Cas. His already racing heart sped up. They were heading towards Jack.
“Well, his life hasn't been exactly free of danger. I need to do everything I can to keep Jack safe,” Cas knew Dean could hear the accusation in his voice and the line was quiet for a moment.
“No, no, you were such a good boy. You did just what I wanted. I promise, shhh, don’t cry baby, I promise. It’s alright now, it’s alright,” Cas assured him and kissed his temple. He pressed their foreheads together then, sending all of his thoughts of love, all of his assurances towards the boy in his arms and in return Jack sent his longing and his sadness during his absence back towards him.
“Cousin,” said Ishim and Gabriel found something stomach churning in his voice, always had, “you cannot give Castiel the care he needs. You’re not a doctor.”
He was obsessed. Rightfully so, he had to admit. Wherever Cas was he was at best just brainwashed at worst kidnapped and tortured. He needed Dean, desperately. Dean thought he could feel him crying out to him and dreamed of awful fates awaiting him. He tried to pretend half those dreams weren’t memories of pain he had inflicted on Cas with his own hands.
“Girlfriend at school passed it on to me. Picked it up in French while on holiday. Found it a bit too wordy for my taste,” Anna told him, indifferent. “You?” Again, he blushed.
“Still better safe than sorry,” said Gabe who was trying to be father in Mister Milton’s absence. “We should all split up and look for them, cover more ground that way. Cas, you’re with me.”
Ruby finally entered. She hadn’t seen her in years, not really even since the wedding. She hadn’t been invited to her second marriage. She was seventy and, Anna couldn’t help but note, slightly dumpy. She knew they had a few children and a horde of grandchildren. Seeing Ruby, spitfire little Ruby, turned into someone’s nan almost made her laugh. Anna never regretted not having children less than in that moment. There was something hippie-ish about her too, which was almost funny. Her face was hard set and her long grey hair fell over her shoulders and wore a knitted shawl. She was still beautiful, in a different light. But to Anna, with her own hair cut short and flattering and her turtlenecks and slacks, she was ridiculous.
Anna had been interviewed on television before. But not for a while. She’d taken some time off before writing her newest book. And she was older now, 77 to be exact, and it seemed as she became older everything became harder. The lights felt brighter, the feedback louder, the chair more uncomfortable, the interviewers questions too grating. Anna liked public life, she always had. She had been one of those writers who was on the cover of magazines, not the recluse types. She had married, briefly, in the 50s. But that was little more than a dalliance at this point. Her life was more spent surrounded by friends who said nothing at all and meant nothing to her. In her older years she had permitted herself the solitude she’d never realized she craved.
“I came here to offer you something. Your son, Jack, he’s quite powerful. Praying all the time for you to come back to him and it’s getting irritating. Pretty soon he’s going to figure out how to really use his powers against me and I’m not looking forward to the outcome of that,” Billie admitted. “However, I can’t bring you back. Not my style and after you killed me that one time? Not super looking to play nice.”
“Why did you go like that? Never calling, never writing, not even once? Fuck, Cas for all I knew you were dead!” Dean yelled at him. Cas took a step back, flinching and Dean was aware, dimly in the back of his head, that he seemed afraid but nothing in Dean was stopping.
“If you know the plot it means you read it too, you can’t get me in trouble,” he told her. “Besides, I have been an admirer of his prose for a while. I didn’t read it for the…”
Dean turned away, scoffing. He could never handle Cas’s worship of him, certainly not then, his hand still on his arm, such a gentle reminder of the angel’s affection. It all got too dangerous.
It was decided then. From that point on Claire was his shadow, sitting beside him at their war councils as plans were devised, making little comments in agreement with him and asking questions of her own. He caught her about in his flannel or jacket when her stuff was in the laundry and agreed to not make a comment. At night, when all the guests had gone to bed, she sat up with him and shared his whiskey.
“He was sick like you’re sick, but now he specializes in treating these things. He runs a…” she trailed off looking at Anna and Gabe as if to find the best word to say it.
“No way, they’re like- like vegetables pretending to be meat, they’re gross,” Dean ranted and Cas laughed, quiet and low, holding himself back, Dean assumed, so as to not wake up the two children. “The fact that I’m raising two kids who will willingly order it on a friggin pizza…”
There was ultimately nothing to fear as the eternity sank in for them both, and while there were intense bouts of anger and restlessness, Jack had mostly been a restful and happy child, and that carried over. There, Cas found, was the mercy of his young age, he was already accepting this as his reality, and he knew that in a few years he would forget to have known anything different. It was like watching the allegory of the cave in real time. The routine of the nights dreaming of a world he would never see again, and the waking hours in the dark, lit only by their grace, as his father patiently told him of the world, had already sunk in and been accepted by the little boy. Cas, for his own part, knew he would never be able to accept it. He was too old, and he had tasted of a life and love too wonderful to ever forget it.
“Well, it’s too small to be Cas’s, but the nephilim, I mean no way he’s old enough to be wearing a coat that size. It doesn’t make sense,” Sam said.
“What is for dinner?” Jack asked. His appetite had been ravenous ever since getting out, the year of not eating had certainly taken its toll. Cas laughed.
When the mysterious disappearances began he hadn’t forwarded the news to Dean because he had no intention of seeming hysterical or like he was inventing a reason to see him. But as the deaths piled up, Dean had shown up on his own, knocking on his door in his typical FBI suit and Cas felt as weak in the knees as he had that night after the brothel. As weak as he had when Dean had said that he’d rather have him.
“You can’t die Cas,” he told him as he ran down the flaming stairs. “You promised you’d mend my flannel.”
“I wasn’t going to…” Dean began but didn’t know what to say. What had he been going to do? He barely knew for sure himself.
“You idiot!” Dean smiled slightly at the other man’s furious face. “You realize that’s probably the most valuable thing we own?”
“Mind if I join you?” Crowley asked. Dean gave him a grunt that he clearly took as a yes and sat down beside him, pouring himself a glass of scotch. “It’s piss what you people drink.”
“What the fuck is this?” was all Dean could get out. Cas tucked the child tighter to himself at the sound of Dean’s gruff voice.
“No,” Cas replied. “I sort of guessed. I didn’t tell her that though, you know, I think it would’ve just gotten her angry.”
The demons left then and Cas heard the drop of the match on their way out and the crackling of the fire as it began to work its way through the house, eating alive all his loves and his memories as it would soon eat him.
Cas was quiet for a while and his insides felt empty. He had spent so many years resisting this man that he didn’t know how to finally submit. He stared at his face and noticed a cut on his forehead.
“He didn’t seem to get the looks either. I mean, you’re far prettier.” Anna blushed. “And those blue eyes…” Dean trailed off. Anna watched him curiously, something she hadn’t expected to find in his eyes lingering there, and then she swam a little closer.
“NO!” He shrieked and with that something came out of him, something overwhelmed with rage and grief and love. He could only see red and gold light came out of his body. “YOU WON’T HURT ANYONE AGAIN!”
“I’ll get to it in a few, you go on in, kid,” Dean told him. “I got a few things to discuss with your dad.” Jack gave a confused look down at Cas but then shrugged and went into the house. When he heard the door slam, Dean walked up towards Cas. Cas stared at him, the setting sun was framing the back of his head with a warm golden light that hurt Cas’s eyes. He was his second favorite sight in the whole world. “I had a nice talk with your boy.”
He stood in the school bathroom trying to breathe and splashing water on himself. He hadn’t felt like this in years, had been in better control than this. He was shaking, gripping the sides of the sink and hoping no one would walk in. This would be so embarrassing for Jack. As he stared at his reflection he knew he didn’t even have to consider her statement for a moment. Of course it was true. He was still in love with Dean. He had never stopped, never even tried to trick himself into believing he wasn’t. He had loved Dean from the moment he had held his damaged soul in his hand and he was overwhelmed with a sensation completely foreign to him, something no one had ever prepared him for. He had fought it and feared it and loathed it and all it had done was feed off of his fear and self loathing and used it to bury itself deeper in him. Dean’s love had in equal parts saved and ruined him. The thought of loving anyone else was impossible to him. There would never be anyone else for him.
“Your mom told Jody who told me,” she said plainly. “I want a fucking crack at Satan he’s ruined my life just as much as he ruined yours.”
“Oh you know it’s true, Cas. Don’t be wet.” Gabe turned to Ketch. “Since he was a child he’s been nothing but a mindless oaf and a skirt chaser who can’t add two and two together to save his life and can be found heavy in his cups most evenings. Don’t get me wrong he’s a damn good gamekeeper, an excellent shot, and a truly decent fellow, but he’s not much more than that. Of course he couldn’t be expected to. Their father went to the Great War and came back all twisted up like they did. And to make matters worse, the mother died after having Sam. John Winchester, a fantastic gamekeeper himself, but he was a drunk and a bastard and we all knew it. Dean turning out even halfway decent is probably a miracle.”
“None that would help,” Crowley answered with a shrug. He was being helpful, Dean had to admit, uncharacteristically helpful, but never without gritted teeth.
“What?” Cas asked but he had a sneaking suspicion he already knew. He’d never directly told Jack to keep it from Dean, but he hadn’t wanted to have this conversation.
“I promise.” And they both turned back to the radio and the music and thought about the vamp nest waiting for them in Pontiac the next morning.
“Jody mention to you how that all turned out for me? Fighting a prince of hell? Wasn’t pretty,” Dean remarked, heading towards his ever faithful bottle of Jack Daniels where it waited on the war table. Claire hopped up onto the table and glared at him.
“Not that, that’s awful enough in and of itself. You know the real way Cas died. You didn’t even mention that to the interviewer, did you?” Sam asked and Anna shook her head.
“I’m too busy,” she told him curtly and he gripped the wheel a little tighter. Kaia texted her sometimes. And sometimes when Claire got drunk she called her to which Kaia would promptly hang up. She was back at Sioux Falls and that was where she could stay safe. Whenever they visited there would be the first few stages of awkwardness, bursting into a terrible tear filled fight where Kaia would accuse her of being obsessive and distant and Claire would call her needy and self righteous and then resolving into them in bed together picking up just where they left off. Claire found it easier to hate her than love her and so that’s what she usually did. Kaia understandably didn’t enjoy this tendency. At the current moment they were on the outs but she expected that not to last very long.
“I don’t know who either of you are, I can’t be here for this I really can’t, I’m so sorry,” he muttered, overwrought and before she had a chance to turn back around he was out the door.
It was almost exactly 2 in the morning when Dean returned with Sammy and Alife holding his hands. The police were there to meet him, taking the children worriedly off his hands and surrounding him.
“Well, if it makes you feel any better I insisted they pick a vegetable,” Cas said. “They should have a balanced diet.”
“Ignore me, fine, but at least spend some time with him. He’s beginning to worry you hate him,” Cas told him and then headed inside. Dean watched him wander into the house with an ache in his chest.
“Wait for you all to get back, I suppose,” he told her. And she worked hard to keep the smile out of her eyes.
“This is just a… a little youthful rebellion. Good for a bit but now it’s time to grow up, you hear me?” Lucifer told him. Jack shook his head.
They were three humans. And dragged with them was, bloodied beyond belief, eyes nearly swollen shut, looking as bad as he had in the crypt, Dean Winchester. Despite his state, a part of Cas he would usually deny existed but was fundamental to his nature, saw Dean and immediately felt relief, that familiar voice in the back of his head saying
“Don’t you dare be sorry for me! I’m not sorry! I love you. I love you. You can hate me or kill me but you can’t stop me,” Cas told him. He looked up at Dean and his blue eyes were shining and defiant and then Dean sunk to his own knees in front of him. He reached out for him. Cas seemed to shirk from his touch for one moment, but let Dean go to him eventually, running his fingers through his hair as Cas continued sobbing into his hands.
“They lied or they forgot about me, how I can do anything,” he said firmly and then he reached his arms in. “Let’s get you two out.”
Sam didn’t comment on it, just made casual conversation about how she was, if she had a girlfriend, and telling her he was glad she was there to help. Dean overheard one awkward conversation between them about future college plans for her that she turned deadly cold in the middle of and chuckled to himself. Chip off the old block, he caught himself thinking. It was the first time he’d smiled in weeks.
“No. I just wanted him to be unable to hurt anyone but I-” Jack paused. “I didn’t want to hurt him.”
“I was scared,” Cas admitted. Dean grabbed him by his shoulders then, tight and intense and Cas was rigid in his grip.
Later that day, once Cas had dried off, he found himself running down to the great hall to greet his older brother Gabriel. He was standing there in the center, wearing a cream colored linen suit, the jacket slung over his shoulder with one hand, and a boater placed jauntily on his head. Behind him, in a light blue suit, was a dapper looking man about Gabriel’s age, he had a glint in his eyes that would have been charming, if there wasn’t a hardness in his face that made Cas stop in his tracks. This, he assumed, must be Arthur Ketch. He turned his attention back to his brother and smiled.
some vamp or witch or whatever Dean had played it down as. For one thing, where he was being kept there was also Jack, gagged and restrained with Enochian handcuffs, and there were a significant amount of wardings against angels. The room was dark and hard to make out anything in the corners. The room seemed to be made of metal and he noticed a creaking sound and a swaying sensation. They were on a boat, he realized. He himself was just tied up like the human he now was, and Jack was passed out a ways from him, he struggled at his own bonds to get to him, trying to overcome the sinking feeling in his stomach at the worrying amount of blood on Jack’s face. He called Jack’s name, getting more and frantic until his son’s eyes slid open. He exhaled just a little then, their blue eyes locking together.
“Dad…” he said, voice soft and rough, accosted with so many faces and the sun and the smell of fresh air. He had never dreamed of his boy getting these things again. It couldn’t be real, it couldn’t be. It was a trick, some cruel trick.
“Least I can do. After all the work you’ve done here, I think I owe it to you,” Cas explained. Dean shook his head.
,” she corrected, harshness creeping into her tone. “A home, more or less, in London. I’ve sent him a telegram, of course he hasn’t responded, it’s very late. But I’m sure he’ll be happy to take you on, they’re state of the art, very innovative, it’s quite fascinating. You’ll get the best treatment we can provide. And then you’ll be well, perhaps even by Christmas. And you can go back to Cambridge and all this will go away.”
“It’s suspicious to you that I’m happy? That I’m successful at being a human? Not languishing in squalor like I was the last time?” Cas questioned and Dean’s eyebrows shot up.
“Well, Samuel will certainly do quite nicely,” she said with a small, hungry grin and in normal times Dean would have laughed at his little brothers blushing face but he felt too frozen over to feel a thing.
Crowley’s promise had seemed sort of bullshit as Rowena hadn’t been able to get a read on their location with her strongest tracking spell yet. Crowley’s demons were getting nothing back, no trace anywhere. He wished they had anything resembling angel contacts, but of course, it had been Cas who had been able to pull those sorts of things. Sometimes he’d wake up in the middle of the night shaking and dream of storming heaven all by himself, if it wasn’t an automatic suicide mission he’d have done it. He’d have killed them all, made the angels fall all over again, if it would save Cas and Jack. The need was deep in his belly, that same familiar unquenchable fire. If he couldn't save them, he kept thinking, what did it all matter? Cas had given everything for him and he couldn’t save him just once, couldn’t save his kid.
“This is going to make it better, Castiel,” Ishim told him. “If I could have done this to myself when I was in your state, I would have.”
“He’s just confused, it’ll all be alright,” Cas consoled him. He looked at Dean then, meeting his eyes with a hard stare.
“My father pays for the younger one to go to Oxford, see,” Gabriel was explaining to the Winchesters to a rapt Ketch.
“Jack… I’m not your father,” Cas said firmly. “I took you from your real father before you were born. I hid you from him. And now he’s come to take you home with him.”
“It’s not funny.” Cas looked indignant. His blood began rushing to his head, maybe it was all a joke, a misunderstanding.
“Bullshit, I never worried about giving Sammy and me a balanced diet,” Dean said, shrugging. He knew that sort of talk set Cas off a little and instantly regretted it.
And so they left, quietly and mournfully, tears in both of their eyes, and all Anna could feel was relief as the door closed behind them. The nightmare was over, they wouldn’t cause the fuss she had worried about. She sat down at her dressing table again and thought back on it all. Already her memories felt murky, and she felt content in the fact that she might someday, before she died, remember this all as she wrote it. But she could still remember the day in question as clear as crystal.
Jack had never met that man, though after all the stories he felt like he knew him. He had no memories of anyone, save his mother. He liked to think those memories pressed at the corner of his brain, she had held him, his father had told him, she had made it longer than she was meant to due to his father’s grace sustaining her, long enough to hold him and care for him for almost a week following his birth. He thought he could remember her, her brown hair falling in his mouth as she smiled down at him. He wasn’t sure if that was a memory of a memory though, being told the story so many times, or if it came from the oft watched home movie his father had taken of the two of them, saved to his laptop with all the videos his mother had made him before he was born. He liked to think it was real, it helped.
As the college acceptances flooded in, Cas wasn’t actually surprised when Jack said he wanted to take a gap year, and he didn’t fight him on it either. It would be good for him to earn some of the tuition. Out of state for the University of Michigan, where it seemed pretty sure he was going, would be steep, and it was going to be far from home too. Jack needed a little time, they both did. Besides, even after all those years, Cas still couldn’t say no to him. Not for anything. When he told Dean the plan over the phone he had sounded fine with it but added before he hung up.
“Jack, he hasn’t had an easy life. He was um very sick when he was very young. And I almost lost him. You can’t imagine…” he found himself lost for words and took a breath to steady himself. “It was difficult with my ex too, very difficult especially at the end. I guess it’s still difficult with us, whenever we see him. And I, I mean I have not been the perfect father either. And Jack almost lost me too. I took Jack here to give him as fresh a start as possible, to make his life as good as it could be. And my every day now, I mean I devote it to him. I’m alive so that I can take care of him. He’s my whole world. I just don’t think I can let anyone into that world. Not now or maybe ever.”
“I’m a hunter. I’m not gonna stop until it’s dead,” she responded quickly, her voice blunt and flat. She knew it was a formality, him saying this to her. He knew her nature and knew it had been him who had given it to her, as surely as if they were blood. She would never rest until this destroyed her as surely as it had destroyed him.
It was Ruby, she made the girl and her red dress out right away. Ruby with her skirts hiked up behind her back and
Dean stopped himself. It was alright though, Cas thought, it was more than enough. Dean kissed the center of Cas’s palm with rough lips, a long lingering touch somewhere between a vow and a prayer. Cas bent his head over Dean’s and they stayed there until Dean had to get up and make dinner. There was nothing more to say.
“Thank you,” he had told Crowley, and realized he’d probably never said it before. Crowley had rolled his eyes.
He felt he would cry his entire heart out of his mouth and into the coffin beneath him. It wasn’t fair, it didn’t make sense, and it was completely his fault. He would burn Lucifer alive, he thought, burn him and his prince of hell. Douse them in holy oil and set them ablaze, he swore it. If there was one thing he could do it was get revenge and he would make it sweet and merciless.
“Cas, do you ever get a chance to go on dates?” She had said as she licked the cream cheese frosting off a cupcake in a way he felt was highly unsanitary.
He understood the terms of the agreement, and trapped in a box with only his child and Dean’s prayers for company wasn’t so different from the reality of their love beforehand. They were to never speak of these things, never to kiss or caress. They could never have a life together, Dean would not have allowed that. The plan was to suffer in silence and live beside one another and think that to be enough. It wasn’t enough, it had never been enough, but Cas would take what he could get.
“Don’t be cute,” Dean barked and ran his fingers through his hair. “It’s not funny- it’s not- how could you go and do that?”
“I want my son. Please, let me have my son, I-“ Cas stopped, and a bit of recognition seemed to enter his eyes, and then a calm. “You’ll care for him?” He asked again. Dean nodded.
“You know my first plan was to just storm in here, smite you, and take my son without even asking nicely,” Lucifer explained. “But then, of course, I realized that wouldn’t work. See, I’ve been inside you, Castiel, I know the type of things you probably taught my boy. Stories about what? Heroes and villains and damsels and Dean Winchester riding to the rescue? Right and wrong? Even taught him I was evil and that he couldn’t trust me? You probably turned my own son against me. So, I realized there was no way he would go along with any sort of plans I might have. And then I thought, well, I don’t need the brat, I can just take his grace and get the power up and move on. But of course, that’s messy, and keeping him around would certainly be more useful in the long run. I mean who doesn’t love a father/son duo, right? So here’s the deal, and it’s a very generous deal here, Castiel. You do what I say and convince my son to trust me or I take his grace myself and you watch as I bash his fucking brains out, how does that sound?”
“He’s the fisherman, isn’t he dad?” Jack asked quietly. Cas nodded, dazed. “I told you so. You didn’t believe me.”
Funds were running low, worryingly so, and he didn’t know who to ask for help. They were having trouble making rent, affording groceries, and Cas didn’t think credit card fraud was the most sustainable income if you were living on the grid to any degree. Plus, there were warrants out for Jack and him in multiple states, so he wasn’t going to attract any type of attention. He didn’t know who to ask for help, and he certainly didn’t want to trouble Sam, who was settling into his life in Chicago (working a monster law practice with Eileen it seemed, which sounded more and more bizarre each time he explained it). The situation felt dire, and he knew he didn’t have the training or credentials to work a job that could pay much better than minimum wage, and if he took on more hours he wouldn’t have time to teach Jack.
“Well, only partially. Arthur Ketch died in 1944. By then, people don’t always remember, the Germans were still bombing London but the public had become too disheartened to go to the shelters every night. Ruby, with time, remarried to Sam, so there’s a little happy ending there,” Anna knew the interviewer would like a little detail like that and had been waiting to slip it in since the beginning. “My mother died, as I told you, in 1949. The dementia in her had a much earlier onset than it had in me, I’m quite lucky. And my brother died in an incident of reckless driving in 1954. So I’ve been actually quite able to write this for sometime. I think I’ve just not known how to tell the story. I did as much research as I could, to fill in what I wasn’t present for. But the story that was created, the original manuscript, it created a sort of pitiless honesty that I didn’t think anyone would truly want to read. I didn’t see what purpose it served.”
Soon they went to go and were drying themselves off when she said something softly, so softly he had to ask her to say it again.
He had long ago lost track of how long he had been held there. There were no windows in his little room and he desperately missed the way the bright morning sun used to flood into his room back home. He had, however, a sinking suspicion in the pit of his stomach that Castiel wasn’t coming back to him any time soon. When he began to get close to that reality something began to bubble up in him, something strange and volatile and then he could make objects soar across the room and glasses shatter. His father gazed at him in pride then and he cried himself to sleep.
“Of course not, darling, but you’re as close as we’ve got, and who knows, we could make one out of you yet,” she cooed as she ran her long, painted fingers across his stubble. Sam caught her wrist with his hand. She raised an eyebrow.
It wasn’t really forever, he knew that. For better or worse the world would one day end and they would both be free. Where they would go after that he was unsure, Jack had a soul so presumably he would go to heaven, if such a thing would still exist at the end of the world. As for himself, he had no idea. That was all that truly pained him about death, the fact of an eternal separation from Jack, though he knew it would be a good thing and his son would finally be at peace.
Cas picked Jack up out of his highchair and carried him outside. They had a big day ahead of them, planting their garden. There would be bluebells and daffodils, hyacinths and tulips and Jack’s favorite: sunflowers. Cas had covered him in sunblock and placed a wide brimmed straw hat on his head to keep him from burning but they were finally ready for a nice day. He loved Jack being this size, just perfect to fit in his arms and beginning to speak in long babbled sentences.
“Jack’s dad, are you still in love with him?” She asked and he felt like he was punched in the stomach.
, he said and pointed back at himself. Cas had held him so tight that night and not said a word against him when he had woken up the next morning hung over and miserable.
Their days were consumed with Cas showing Jack around their garden and the forest near their house, naming every plant, every insect, every bird, every small animal. It was the two of them struggling through cookbooks, both comically inept at it. It was reading Jack books and watching movies, the ones Dean had showed him as “essential to being human,” and then shutting those movies off halfway when he realized how startlingly inappropriate so many were. It was feeding the cat that Jack had named Scooby for his favorite cartoon (not fully understanding that it was a dog’s name) and making sure Jack didn’t hold him too tightly whenever he picked him up for a hug. It was teaching Jack to fly or levitate books or drive his truck. It was sitting by the shore and pointing out the sealife and their ancestors and history and whispering that he knew a man who loved fishing and would one day, if things got better, teach Jack how to himself.
Cas was silent. There was no other option, he knew that. His only hope was Dean getting there in time and as much as he loved the man it was things like this that he was always late for. The prospect of it all welled up inside of Cas. He wouldn’t cry though. He wouldn’t give Lucifer that satisfaction.
“We could have made your life hell in the media. Be grateful,” Ruby said. “You know, I had actually figured out it was him by then. But I was never sure. I had to have it clarified by reading a review of your book in
this is it. it's shorter. a little more discussion of the rape also a semi-graphic description of a lobotomy based on rosemary kennedy's. i ultimately don't know who this fic was for besides myself but i enjoyed writing it.
“What do you want?” Cas spat at him, Lucifer pushing his own blade closer towards his jugular as he spoke.
“Why can’t we go home?” Alfie was shrieking over and over as Sammy cried in the corner. Ruby grabbed his arm fiercely.
“I can’t believe you came! I can’t believe it! This is the best! This is the best day ever!” Jack was bouncing up and down and Dean was ruffling his hair and grinning.
“Of course I did. I think you know by now I couldn’t forget you if I tried” Cas replied, voice hard and insistent. Dean gripped his chair tightly.
“If he wasn’t the one who did it, the most likely suspect is the other Mister Winchester,” he said and Cas knew it was all hopeless from that point on. Dean seemed to go limp and barely noticed as he was handcuffed or that Sam had reached the car and began screaming himself raw.
Cas laughed but it sounded like choking. Dean grimaced. They were almost at the doorway, he told himself, Cas just had to hold on a little while longer. Cas didn’t seem to be listening to Dean’s prayer though, growing limper every second. When they crossed over the threshold Dean took huge gasping breaths of the cool night air. He slumped to his knees, holding Cas gently in his arms. He looked down at him then, his burning house flickering in his blue eyes.
“And maybe that made me inclined to hope, I don’t know. Maybe that was stupid,” Cas trailed off a little. Dean stood up, uncomfortable, out of control, wanting to get as far away from this sort of conversation as possible. “You say all those things, imply all these promises, and now you won’t go near me. Me or him.”
Still, it was good to see her with the Banes when they showed up, though he had to admit Max and Alicia’s hugs were warmer than Mary’s was. Alicia used some lovely fruity shampoo that filled his nose when she wrapped him up in her arms upon entering the doorway, and Max gave him a tight squeeze, reminding him of the kinship they had found when they’d worked the hunt together. They hadn’t spoken about the deal Max had made to save Alicia, but he knew he understood the younger man better than either could put into words. He wanted to talk to Max about this all, about why he felt like he was dying all the time and why he was worrying in a way he’d only ever worried about Sam. But he knew he’d never get a chance with all the work to be done.
“I keep my promises,” Cas said and Dean nodded. There was a strange moment between them. Long and quiet and Cas wondered what now it would take him to forgive him. Because somehow he didn’t, some part of him still couldn't. He was beginning to realize this was maybe more about him than it was about Jack or maybe he just couldn’t separate Jack from himself. He didn’t know. Either way, it wasn’t enough. It still wasn’t enough.
“Bite it. You have to bite it.” Ruby looked at him curiously with her dark brown eyes, and then did as she was told. The chocolate was hard and sweet, not powdery but rich and nice. “If they ever give you trouble again, you come to me, alright?”
He tried to turn the knob as quietly as possible, keeping the parking lot lights from flooding into the tiny motel room. It was late, nearing one a.m., and he had promised he would be back earlier. But it had taken forever to even get out the door and once he did traffic was a major bitch and he felt a twinge of guilt as he surveyed the darkened room. The motel clerk had assumed something illicit when he had lumbered in just a few minutes ago and asked for the key Cas had said would be waiting at the desk. With a clear quirk of the eyebrow and a purse of the lips, Dean knew the bored, pimply young woman was assuming either this was the other family or he was just coming from them. He’d taken his key with a shit eating grin and sauntered off.
“I’m going for a swim, would either of you mind to accompany me?” Both heads turned sharply. “It’s just the waters get so rough so mummy doesn’t like me to go alone. And Cas is being a bore and refusing to come along.”
He sank to his knees, still clutching the letter tight. He would come to his senses in a moment, he assumed. Be terrified that Anna saw it, that she showed it to who? Gabriel? Mummy? He couldn’t say. But in that moment, it was his. He had nothing else to worry about but those hilariously vulgar words. So simple there was no misconstruing. He had an urge to wring his hands and say “so that’s that.” It was all suddenly so simple.
Anna had cried at hearing the news. A true terrible sobbing like when she broke her arm as a little girl. It was the only time she cried. At the funeral she was already frozen over and barely heard it when Gabriel, drunk and disgraceful, called her a murderer. Her, not even mummy, just her. His eyes had been dark and red rimmed and he had been told he was making a scene.
“All I’m saying is where do you think those lovely blue eyes come from?” Anna laughed. “Gabe and I both have hazel.”
“Well,” Cas got out, as if preparing to launch into some long speech, but instead petered off. “It’s breakfast tomorrow, sorry to say.”
“Jack, I chose this,” he said. “I chose this you, know that. There’s no life for me without you and the idea of you alone in the dark? I couldn’t bear it. You know that, I’ve told you, this was my choice.”
The stories Jack mostly asked for were of his mother, and Cas was happy to oblige. Kelly had told him so much of her life, written a lot down that Jack would never get to read, but Cas, thankfully, had already memorized it all. Cas wondered if Kelly thought he had failed her, for allowing this to happen to Jack. As much as he hated himself for being too weak to prevent this, he knew she wouldn’t be angry. He had kept his promise. Jack was as safe as could be, he was good, and Cas was caring for him. He had given him everything, absolutely everything, that had to count for something.
“Uh...yeah…yeah…” Jack said, giving Cas a look who gave him a nod of consent. Dean clapped a hand to Jack’s shoulder.
“That’s all.” Dean wanted to say something else, anything else. But he had nothing to say. “I gotta clean myself up, before the guests get here. They’ll need me handling their bags.” He walked off. Cas followed him with his eyes, but remained standing where he was.
, was all Cas could think as the world of whites and reds blurred around him. Meg was speaking to him saying something, pleading with him. She smelled lovely, he thought. She always had. She was beautiful.
He ran in then, ignoring the heat and the smoke and the way the wood burned his hands. He was screaming their names. Until his throat was raw. The house was in a full fledged inferno and he knew none of it was salvageable. Distantly he wondered what had happened to the cat or the chickens and then pushed it from his mind. Cas and Jack were both nowhere to be seen and his blood ran cold. Finally he heard a rasping voice call his name from up the stairs and he ran up and found him.
“Alright,” Dean agreed, his best attempt at stoicism coating his voice. He pulled himself together as if to head towards the door. “I won’t tell anyone about this.”
They started seeing each other a little more after that. Dean came to more holidays and there were other things, too. Sam and Eileen’s wedding, finally, Patience’s college graduation, Alex’s engagement party to some guy he
“He is Jack,” Cas repeated. “And I’m very sorry I ever kept you from him. It was very very wrong of me. And now you’re going to go with him and be a very good boy. You’re going to do everything he says and learn so much. Just as it should be.”
“See Winchester, it doesn’t matter that you wouldn’t give them up. That you’d choose the two abominations over your own kind, because we got them anyway. We found your little boyfriend and his brat and now we’re gonna get rid of them.”
That evening, Jack went out to meet up with some of his friends and do a nighttime drive around town to celebrate and he and Dean were left alone. They stood there in the empty house as soon as he was gone, just staring at one another. Cas finally took him in. Salt and pepper hair, crooked teeth, same mossy green eyes, but now with crow’s feet and lines on his forehead, bad posture, same broad shoulders, calloused hands, chapped lips, older and less glorious and not the god he had worshipped him as when they met but still the man he had loved before he even knew what love was. Cas wondered if Dean was taking stock of him in just the same way.
Dean worked as a mechanic, which was good and hard work that kept his mind off of things and it was good to fix rather than break for the first time in a while, part time only, though. Most of his time was spent at home, where Cas was homeschooling Jack and there was work to be done: yard work to do, a leaky roof to fix, walls to repaint, and dinner to get on the table as Cas couldn’t cook for shit. He felt his favorite moments of the day were passing through the porch or the living room or the kitchen table where Cas was sitting with Jack bent over a textbook and pressing kisses into each of their heads. For the house itself, he had really no complaints, he enjoyed working on it, Cas himself kept things pretty clean and tidy, and the only problem was how drafty it got as if it wasn’t raining or too windy Jack and and Cas insisted on keeping the windows open. He wouldn’t complain about that.
He buried him deep, not afraid of him coming back to haunt him and very afraid of him being disturbed. He did his work quickly and dutifully as he shoveled the dirt on top, ignoring how it felt to know he’d never gaze on the man inside again. Then he marked it with a wooden marker that he had painstakingly carved into “Castiel, loving father” and placed it on top of the soft soil. As a final touch he picked Jack’s favorite flowers, sunflowers, from what was left of the garden and set them on top. He gazed at the marker and the lake and the still smokey blue sky and only then allowed himself to cry.
Cas had smiled at her across the table because here was finally something that made any sense to him. It was scary he thought, terrifying, but he could do it. He knew he could. He had so much to teach Jack and he couldn’t wait to begin.
“All the trips Dean-o was making, it wasn’t hard,” he told him. “Deteriorated your little warding enough for me to slip through. Of course Asmodeus had an APB put out to all the demons working for him as opposed to that rat Fergus. Perfect window, I’ve gotta say. Just too bad Dean isn’t here now too, I’d enjoy squelching your little cockroach in front of you. Well, another day I guess.”
“Can you tell me where you were born Castiel? What’s the name of the king? Who came before him? Where are we exactly?”
“That’s not true you just know how to take care of others,” Cas said. “You know how to manage him,” who the him was seemed obvious and unspoken but Dean responded to it with a grunt nonetheless, “and you know how to deflect and take the brunt off of others and keep everyone calm and happy but you don’t know how to take care of yourself. And besides, even if you did, that’s not all on you anymore. Now you have me.”
Crowley seemed to give her a wide berth as she was clearly hostile to him. He had told Dean he thought she was halfway feral one evening to which he had responded with a sharp “good.” Crowley couldn’t understand her and she didn’t like him. It was best that way, Dean thought, and it was certainly what Cas would’ve wanted.
“Well, what are we?” Crowley asked and Dean looked at him. What was Crowley? A missed opportunity, a dumb vindictive mistake, the only person who was ever honest with him, and ultimately a poor replacement for the one person he thought of before he went to be and right before he woke up, that was what Crowley was. Somehow he didn’t need to say any of this and Crowley only sighed as if in understanding. “No, I’m the blasted idiot who never had a chance. You took it didn’t you?”
“Sam’s waiting outside. He was going to come in and then lost his nerve. Or more so, I told him much good wouldn’t be done by just screaming at you,” Ruby told her. “You didn’t even ask me.”
Seeing Cas, with his big adoring blue eyes was one thing, but Jack looked at him like he was a superhero and he didn’t know whether to hate or love the kid for it. What was Jack to him anyway? Something between a godson, a stepson, and just a run of the mill son. The first was palatable, the second frightening, and the last enough to make him want to run for the hills. He’d already failed the kid harder than either Cas or Jack could understand. He’d abandoned them, left them to a fate worse than death, he’d been late, ages too late, he hadn’t been able to tell his own mother even a fraction of the truth, and he felt nothing but shame when he even so much as thought about either of them. To share a room was like burning alive.
“What do you mean?” He asked again, Rowena went over to him, her wide legged pants swishing along with her.
“I’m very sorry about that, I’m sorry about all of this,” Cas told him, looking down. Dean jumped to his feet then, advancing towards him.
It was a perfect day for swimming, crisp and warm. Anna had wanted to go for the sole goal of cooling off, but soon found she loved the magic of it on its own. She pulled her head underwater and let her eyes take in the blue green waters of the river. She mostly let herself lie in a backstroke, but Dean beside her was taking a more adventurous route, and she couldn’t deny to enjoy watching him do flips or strong long strokes, splashing about in the water with a sort of childlike joy. She once treaded beside him, meeting his green eyes, and smiling, his eyes following her as well.
“Well. Yes, but, you know there’s all these logistical issues. It’s a few towns over and moving there; it would be more expensive. Not to mention the tuition, it may be easier to put him in public school.”
Dean wanted to kiss him again, kiss his hand or his forehead or even his face, decency wouldn’t even stop him then. But his chance was lost and the officer had pulled Cas off of him and was holding him in place as another slammed the door shut and drove off. He worried that he had never had the chance to say it back, to assure Cas that he would come back to him as surely as he knew Cas would wait for him. But as the car drove off and he got his last look into those blue eyes, so trusting and gentle, he knew that was one thing he wouldn’t have to worry about.
“Mummy said she conceived me the night before he left.” It was a story Cas had been told many times, a last loving night between their usually buttoned up parents. He liked it.
Dean had been twenty two then, just helping Sammy move into his freshman dorm, and had privately wondered what a strange fucking bird he had gotten for his roommate.
“Fuck…” was all Dean could say. Cas looked stoic as usual, not misty eyed or overwhelmed but Dean felt a guilt rise up in him. Cas had faced all that alone. Pain and loss and suffering, the fear of losing a child, the reality of losing his friend. And his grace… Dean thought, not for the first time, how much he should’ve been there, to have stopped him, to have talked some sense into him.
“Get out of my library,” Dean barked and she laughed and went off. He shook his head in the darkness and considered her freeness. He imagined being that free about Cas, talking like that with Sam, Cas gossiping with Rowena, Dean telling people in town that Cas was his lover. He even imagined taking Jack places and saying “yeah, this is my boyfriend’s kid,” and grinning with pride when they called him cute. He let his brain go so far as to picture leaving Claire to babysit Jack while he took Cas out somewhere nice before his heart clenched at his memory of the reality of it all and he drowned himself so deep in drink he thought he might never swim to the shore.
“Dean, it wasn’t lack of trust. I didn’t want to burden you,” he admitted. Dean shook his head yet again and Cas could feel tears landing onto his hand.
Jack felt sick and lonely all of the time. His father (or so he tried to think of him, when he pictured a father all that came to mind were blue eyes and soft hands and an ever ready kiss on his forehead) was rarely around, only stopping in to talk to him about strange things like world domination or learning to use his powers to smite people. Jack didn’t know how to explain that he barely knew how to use his powers himself. He would spend hours barely able to levitate a pencil on command. His father seemed disappointed by that, often snapping at him and then hurriedly apologizing.
“My publishers said it was unlikely you would sue,” Anna replied. “You have more to lose than to gain.”
Dean had told them over dinner that night (Cas had insisted he stay) that it was probably something simple, just a witch or a vamp or something and he’d clean it up in a day or two. Told them not to stay out late at night but in general probably it was nothing to worry about. Jack had begged him to let him help but Dean had given Cas one look and knew he had to say no.
“Fuck Cas, you don’t have to say it like that,” Dean replied. “All I was doing was pointing out that he’s a threat. Trying to be logical. I don’t wanna hurt the kid myself I’m just saying, this is pretty damn apple pie.”
“I promise, Jack,” Cas said. Lucifer took the handcuffs off him then stood up and held out his hand. Jack looked at it and then at Cas.
“A lobotomy.” Ishim said it calmly and she heard from behind her Gabriel emit something caught between a huff and a groan. “It’s an operation to the frontal lobe of the brain. It helps correct things, when people have perhaps been built in a way that harms them. I’ve been pioneering them in my career, and I truly swear by them.”
“I don’t know if you should trust what my sister says. It was dark. An inky darkness tonight. You saw it. And she has a tendency to...embellish. She’s done it since we were children,” Cas paused. “I grew up with Dean Winchester, he’s my best friend and one of the best men I’ve ever known. He wouldn’t do a thing like this. Not ever, I’m sure of it. It’s not in his nature. You’d realize that if you spoke to him for just one second. He would never intentionally hurt another soul.”
The dinner was surprisingly not awkward. It was pleasant and full of chatter and they felt so normal, so settled that Cas could almost convince himself it was always like this. He even let Dean pick up the bill, who handled it quietly and with nothing more than a nod in his direction. Jack had seemed so excited, Cas had to keep reminding him to not eat with his mouth full like he was a little kid again. In short, it was perfect.
“You’re far from welcome,” he had replied and disappeared as per usual. Dean had found himself laughing once he was gone.
“So you did keep us in mind from time to time?” was what Dean asked him, words laced with an accusation. Cas stiffened and turned to face him.
“Look, we were talking real late, he didn’t get to bed until after midnight, and I didn’t know exactly how to get out of it,” Dean admitted. He could make out Cas rolling his eyes, even in the dark.
Dean headed out of the house and then stopped cold. Cas looked at him. Claire was looking between them and Jack’s eyes still seemed to be on his father.
with you?!” Cas had found himself screaming at Dean endlessly and was faced with nothing but a passive aggressive grunt and a shrug of the shoulders. That had only made him angrier. “Look at me! Look at me! I’m crying! I’m crying and your son is crying and I know you love us so fucking say something! Do something to fix this!”
he had told him and Jack had smiled and switched on the new Taylor Swift album and Cas was glad Jack hadn’t noticed that tears had nearly sprung to his eyes when he heard the opening guitar strums to “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.” Dean used to play that song for him nearly anytime they drove somewhere together.
He led him upstairs to Jack’s bedroom where he found his son held by Enochian handcuffs and surrounded by demons, yellow eyed Asmodeus standing in the corner smiling at Lucifer.
Rowena had come to them with a new idea for a spell, one that would be stronger, might bypass warding, but would require a trifecta of witches. Power of three, she said, in her lilting Scottish accent, never discount it. Of course the challenge was finding two other willing witches, as Rowena was not exactly the most popular of the bunch.
Cas had no response to that, and simply turned into the shaking child beside him, burying his face in his hair as the coffin’s lid was shut on top of them both. The locks clicked one after the other, Jack flinching at each one, and once they were done, the cuffs restraining Jack’s hands fell away, no need for them anymore. Cas felt them being dragged down the beach towards the sea. Jack tensed up and wrapped his arms around his father’s neck. Cas held him close.
It had been hours of unbroken silence between them with nothing but an endless cycling of old tapes of classic rock filling the air of the car. Her head was leaning against the window and she was sure she would’ve nodded off had he not put on a mixtape she’d never heard before. It was the sort of old 60s and 70s acoustic music she knew Jody liked and it had jolted her out of the calm of familiarity. That had been maybe twenty minutes ago and they were supposed to reach the motel in Pontiac in an hour or so. He was in a bad mood and if she was honest she hadn’t expected him to take the job there in the first place. It brought up only heartbreak for them both but she wasn’t going to argue when he had told her. And they both had a tendency for self flagellation.
. It’s a period piece, set during the second world war. Which I understood you served as a nurse in. It’s your twenty first novel,” the interviewer was saying but she shook her head.
He set it down after a moment and got to work. It had been so long since he had seen Dean and the past month had thrown him off kilter. Not a word had been exchanged between them about his confession in the kitchen and the idea tied his stomach into knots. Dean was still there though, he reminded himself, still helping in his own way and making Jack love him almost as much as Cas did himself. Blessings and curses, Cas thought, as he had gingerly considered a drawing Jack had done of his house and his family the other day, with a scribbled Dean sandwiched between Cas and their cat.
“I knew he wouldn’t be able to stay awake up to this point,” Cas admitted. “He conked out before they even kissed. Claire I thought would make it but she’s sixteen, she can handle it.”
Dean drove off after that as Cas stayed behind, watching the familiar Ohio plates disappear into the dust. That night he stayed up late once Jack was fast asleep, drinking red wine and listening to “Diamonds and Rust,” and reminding himself not to call.
“That’s really kind Allison, but I just don’t have time to date,” he said. “My work, and Jack. I mean, it’s not really my priority.”
“You’re not an idiot,” Dean told him gently. “You know, that’s one of the first things you ever told me?”
“You could’ve died. We could’ve both died!” He practically barked it at her, and she took a step back.
“Get Dean to do, he’s probably lazing about somewhere,” Anna said. And Gabriel called for him. Dean ran in and began at their bags. Ketch eyed him critically.
“Yeah. I do,” Dean told him. “Listen, I’m gonna put it all aside. I’m gonna stop hunting. Hell, I’m gonna give Claire the Impala, it’s high time she got it anyway, and I’m gonna stay here and I’m gonna be good to you both. It’s not gonna...it’s never gonna make up for it. Nothing can, Cas I’m so sorry, to you both. For what I did, what I said- I was scared, you understand? I was scared to love you both because of how...how weak it made me, what it said about me. But I’m not scared, anymore. Or maybe I still am but I think I want this more than I’m scared of it. I don’t have much time left to fix this, but if you’ll let me, I want to. I want to fix it. So can I stay?”
Cas hadn’t known how to respond to that, and had waited until night to give Dean a long report of Jack’s excellent first day to him.
He wasn’t lying, he told himself that, though Jack did not seem to believe him. Instead he simply clung to him tighter as they suddenly felt themselves adrift, the rush of water over them. The angels had sealed the coffin well, though. The water wouldn’t get in. “We’re safe,” he kept whispering to the boy in his arms, “I have you.”
“I’m so sorry I avoided you. I’m sorry I was scared,” Dean said, looking down at their hands once again. “It was all so much.”
“He’s...he’s engaged in behaviors, in the past, that would make it seem he had that capacity, mummy should I…” again she looked at Naomi.
“Dean!” A tall dark haired man called out before he was blasted out of the way. Lucifer stood there then, staring at them all. Jack gazed at him in fear and anger.
“Oh I’m going to kill you, Castiel,” he said, a wide grin on his face. “But first you’re going to give me my son. You’re going to tell him that he can trust me and to go with me. That I’m his real father, and you were very wrong to take him from me. You’re going to tell him to do everything I say, tell him that I’m a good person.”
They did all meet at the bunker with one surprising addition: Claire. She greeted him at the doorway with an angel sword and a can do attitude a day before everyone else showed up.
“Thank you for taking care of him for me,” he said. Cas nodded stiffly. “Come on Jack, we have so much to do.”
Dean had finally heard him speak one morning. He had followed him outside one day to make sure the kid wasn’t getting into trouble or hurting himself. Predictably, the spot Jack was visiting was Cas’s makeshift grave marker. He was sitting criss cross applesauce on top of it and talking softly to the man deep beneath him, drawing little pictures in the dirt as he spoke.
“I’m an unloved, greying, middle aged fart living alone in a bunker with nothing but a .45, a bottle of jack, and my car for company,” Dean said. “I don’t want that for him.”
“For god’s sake, just put him under already!” Ishim had finally said, when his howling got too much. A nurse went to get a syringe but before it could be applied something went wrong. Someone slipped. It was never discovered what. But suddenly Cas was bleeding and feeling pain, more pain than he’d ever felt before, something in his head, and they were stopping and unstrapping him and Ishim was running his hands through his hair. They were placing him on a stretcher and going to bring him back to his bed, someone calling for help for a different doctor, it was all a blur around him.
“Good,” said Anna. “Now we should both clean up before dinner.” Ruby stood up and headed towards the door then turned back.
“You know this was all feathers’s fault, right?” Crowley asked suddenly and Dean’s head turned towards him abruptly. "Everything that's happened, he brought it on himself."
“You have to save Jack, please Dean, you have to. You have to promise me,” Cas begged. “You have to take care of him. He has no one now, it has to be you. Promise me.”
“I’m fine,” Dean said but the way he had curled into him clearly proved otherwise. Cas kept running his fingers through his hair as if he hadn’t heard him. Dean tried to let himself relax, to sink into Cas’s body and ease himself of tension, but some of it remained in his shoulders and clenched fists and curled toes. He was always ready, ready for the monster under the bed to bash down the motel door and require him to jump to his feet.
“Well, you got here so late it’s not exactly evening anyway,” was Cas’s bitchy response. Then he seemed to relax and sink into remorse. “I’m sorry Dean. I’m sorry. I said I wouldn’t do this.”
Everyone seemed to be standing around, waiting to see what he would do next. He met Crowley’s eyes briefly.
“Jack’s gonna want me there right? Can’t let him down can I?” She had said, sounding just like Dean and Cas had nodded. He hadn’t mentioned to either of Claire or Jack that he had asked Dean first. It was too painful.
He did love his father, that was the terrible truth of it all that he only admitted to Cas in their tenderest and most secret moments. It would all be so easy if the only thing he felt towards John was fear or obligation but he couldn’t help the sweet tasting overwhelming love he felt as well. The love didn’t override the love he felt for Cas and the kids. And it certainly didn’t stop the terrible hatred he felt towards his father when he saw the way Cas’s face screwed up with fear when John had pulled into their driveway, or how Claire always gave Dean the cold shoulder at the breakfast table, still furious that he’d “chosen” him over them, or how Jack clung to his pant leg whenever he went off to work in the morning, a too deep sadness in the little boy’s blue eyes. No, if anything the love he felt for his father only served as a paralytic. He was frozen in the middle of a crossroads, like some fucked up version of the trolley problem, failing his family and himself all at once.
“Let me go with him,” Cas said, his voice firm but terrified. Naomi turned to him. “Please, if you won’t let him go free, at least don’t make him be alone.”
Cas had died, and then she gently told him she didn’t think she’d be much help. He couldn’t help but agree with her, for better or worse.
The baby’s room was beside it. This one was more clearly lived in. There was a mural painted on that wall, “Jack” written in apples on a tree with a rainbow above it containing the alphabet.
Across the house, in the servants quarters, in a room with a door that wouldn’t lock and a broken window that turned the room into an icebox in the winter, Dean Winchester cleaned out muskets as his younger brother Sam ranted to him.
“That doesn’t matter right now,” Dean insisted and gathered Cas into his arms, preparing to take him from the house. “All that matters is getting you out.”
The first person he called was Sam, though really the call was to Sam and Rowena as she was listening in on the phone, commenting every few seconds on what to do next. The plan was clear to meet at the Bunker as soon as possible with the two promising to take the next flight out. Crowley was the one he called next and he admitted he was already sort of aware of the Lucifer situation and would also meet at the bunker and deploy his demons as best he could for help. The final call was his mother who was very quiet on the phone as he explained what happened, unable to gloss over the details of just exactly
And Jack had switched his order, sheepishly, to a grilled cheese with ice cream for dessert. On the car ride he had banned any rock, folk, classic or otherwise, when Jack had quietly switched on Crosby, Stills & Nash.
“You know we were pretty stumped on what to do once we found you two. I mean you, you’re basically human now, a quick bullet between the eyes will do it. But we don’t have a way to kill the boy, hell I don’t know if anyone does,” the leader had drawled. “But of course one of your former siblings came to us with some help, Castiel. Damn do they hate you. Told us how to build it and everything, ‘specially warded for a nephilim this time.”
“Dean! You came! Daddy must be on his way isn’t he! I never believed him about not being my real dad! I knew it was a lie and that he was gonna come and now you’re here and we can all go home!” Jack babbled excitedly. He watched Claire and Dean exchange a strange look.
“I don’t know, that’s more Dean’s domain,” Cas replied and looked at the man standing a pace away. Dean’s face had none of the lightness to Jack’s and in fact there was something strange and hard behind his eyes that confused him. Dean came up onto the porch.
“Oh right, I’ve heard how your father hasn’t been the most prudent with money in recent years.” The three siblings stiffened.
That was the moment when Jack burst from his bonds. Enochian handcuffs couldn’t hold him for long. Cas hadn’t seen Jack use his full powers in years. He hadn’t had reason to. The sight now, with his glowing golden eyes, was glorious. There was a blast of bright, warm light and when Cas opened his eyes the box was melted down to nothing and the other hunters were lying on the floor. Jack stood there, exhausted.
“What’s the matter? Hey, what’s wrong?” He asked and Jack could barely speak, he was sobbing so hard. Eventually, he was able to get him to breathe and he stared at him, forcing his blue eyes to focus.
“Then alright,” Dean pulled his papers out of his pocket and started on it, “your brother getting back today?”
“That’s a good thing,” he said and she turned her attention back to her window. A small way of indicating she wanted out of this conversation. It might have stayed that way had a certain soft fingerpicking not drifted into the car.
“No, I know it’s not. It’s the only real thing I’ve ever had. But I don’t know if it’ll last, that’s what worries me,” Cas admitted. “I feel like Tony and then I feel like you’re him too. Like the only way anyone will ever get through to you is with violence. Like you’ll need something really awful to happen before you see sense in this situation. And it can’t even be something awful to you, because you just won’t care. Enough awful has happened to you anyway. It’ll have to be to them.”
“We are, Cas is the black sheep it seems,” said Gabe grinning. “Found out that Forster was a Cambridge man and got his heart set on going there.”
“You shouldn’t let them do that you know,” the younger brother said, referring to Dean’s task. “Work when you’re working, nothing when you’re not.”
But then, in the library, with the rug ripped out under her the solid understanding came in that she was not this story’s heroine. She was barely a supporting player. A drama was playing out around her, sure, one great and lurid and it was Cas who was its ingenue. Simple, plain, shy and unassuming Cas who everyone agreed was a good boy and would do well with his life but there wasn’t much more to say of him than that, he had stolen her story from her. And she had nothing left to do than fix her face and head back in for dinner.
The words stare down at him. A barefaced accusation. He should burn it but there’s such a note of truth, more truth than he’s ever been able to put into words perhaps his whole life. So instead he folds it carefully and lets it lie by the foot of his bed. He sets about another apology, a proper one. One with things like “Dear Cas, you’ve been my best friend for years and it scares me how much I care. I never should treat you the way I do. I’d do anything to make things right.” Awful, vulnerable things, but not criminal. When he was done, he folded it as well, fetched an envelope, grabbed a paper from his bed and put it in writing
“He said he thought about it “all day long,”” Ruby didn’t even have words for how that made her feel.
“My room has a window Cas! I’ve never had a window!” He had told him, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet and Cas had smiled at him as he cleaned the fridge (left covered in a weird grey film from the previous inhabitants). They had put on Crosby, Stills & Nash as they moved in all their stuff, the rock music ban lifted when he had seen Jack’s puppy dog eyes (though “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” was still skipped). And Cas wondered if they both thought that it would fill the void of the missing man who would’ve most demanded it to be played. Cas painted Jack’s room yellow because he knew it was his favorite color and stocked up the cupboards with sugary cereal. After all he had been through, he thought, a cavity was the least of their worries.
“I know that now. Dean, if I could do it all over, I would,” Cas said. “I’d have let you in. He loved you, right away, you know that?”
“He’s sort of...Cas said he’s telepathic. I’ve never seen him do it. It’s only if there’s some sort of bond,” Dean muttered.
“I could be so much help! I’m learning all about the legal system in my AP Gov class!” Jack said and Dean had laughed and Cas noticed that Dean’s hand was twitching as if he wanted to reach out to ruffle Jack’s hair or touch his shoulder and he kept pulling it back.
Anna stopped. Then she thought back to the memory and how easy it was to see Dean Winchester’s face over that of the man shrouded in darkness. He had seemed about his height and build. Who else could it even have been, if not Sam?
“He stepped into the library I think,” Gabe had told her with a shrug. “If he’s caught in some book and wants to miss supper that’s his funeral.”
“Dean, my friend, the fisherman, he prays to me. I can hear him. And while he doesn’t know where we are, he does miss us, even you, who he’s never met. So even though we’re alone here, we aren't- we’re still loved. And that matters,” he told him. And it was true, not a white lie for Jack’s sake. Dean prayed to him all the time, nearly every night like back in purgatory. Soft words like
“It’s my job to keep you safe,” Dean told him firmly and Cas sighed. “And I’m doing that, nothing else matters.
, he had snapped at him to not talk like that. When they stopped at a diner and Jack had ordered a burger with a slice of pie he had said, with a new harsh tone he was just discovering in himself,
“Mummy, you can’t possibly be agreeing with this?” Gabriel asked but Naomi’s full attention was turned to Ishim.
“But it’s not true. You don’t fully atone at all. You left out some very important details,” Sam said.
Rowena did, in fact, take him up on it one night. It was a rare moment when they bumped into one another in the library, nights spent searching for spells and ways forward, terrible dead ends. They’d been giving each other a lot of distance as he still didn’t know how to talk to her while knowing about her whole thing with Sam. The two of them were far from quiet and he was halfway to giving them a warning about it.
