“Just one more thing”, rushed Cas, taking the message out, “Could you please take this to the communication barracks? I need this sent as soon as possible. It´s directed to the ranger post on the limit of the Wyvernon Forest. I need an answer for
In an attempt of suffocating the rebellion, the protests, and the rise of the newly organized army, Crowley tried to use his powers to end all who opposed him in three awful events: the Apocalypse, the Darkness… and the End.
No, no, asking Uriel was a bad idea. He was too smart, and Cas was too bad a liar.
As the elixir bubbled and started changing color from green to a light teal, he kneeled in front of one of the wooden chests that lay under his lab table and searched inside for a bundle of clean bandages- he set them at the foot of the bed. He went through the door at the right side of his bed, got to the smaller of the adjacent rooms, and returned with some towels and a silver basin with water that he left on a nightstand.
And he wasn’t getting away this time.
“Who would you have called? Cas is hurt, and Kevin´s useless. Jody would have helped, but we can´t wait for her to get here- not if we don´t want the victim number to raise up to thirty”
“Meaning?”
“Y-yeah”, he managed to blab out, “Yeah, totally. Good call”
Castiel closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths.
He honestly believed that if someone had been lost in those woods for a week, he was dead and long eaten by now... but he was not going to tell that to his nervous patient.
Something made then Dean freeze where he stood. His instincts drove him into stealth mode, his movements slow and measured, his breathing quiet, as his whole attention was directed to their surroundings. He could feel the danger. He just didn’t know exactly where yet.
Dean bit his lips to stop his smile from spreading upon the use of
“I´m like… seventy-percent sure that’s true, now”, he said with a grimace. Then he opened his arms in a shrug, “Hey, maybe you´re right. Maybe you are just a great dude that saves chicks in distress”
“This is insane”, he murmured, unbelieving.
The crushing of leaves got closer, and closer, thundering clacking legs at his back; and when he looked over his shoulder he immediately jumped to one side with a yelp.
“Yes”
After a few seconds the hunter slowly put his goblet on the floor, worried eyes never leaving him, and raised his hands slowly in a pacifying gesture.
The hunter stood looking away, silent… until he emitted a growled sigh, his shoulders slumping in defeat. He looked back at Cas, sad… but yielding.
He did not want to look anxious or paranoid, so he simply gulped and stressed during the whole trip to the motel. But as soon as Sam got out of the car to check them both in, promising to come back to help him hop to their room, he took his phone out.
Cas only looked at him, silent, wide-eyed. His fury had slowly evaporated.
“Come on, man. It sometimes worked! You helped us stop the Apocalypse, for one. You stopped Heaven´s War. Yes, you freed the leviathans while you were at it, but we all took them out after that. You saved me and Sam so many times. A lot of humans, too. And you finally got the angels back to Heaven. That´s gotta count, right?”
“Are you sure?”, he doubted.
“I mean, do nobles never die of sickness”, Dean interrupted with an intense look in his eyes, “Like a normal sickness. Like cirrhosis, or pneumonia. Tuberculosis, I don’t know”
“‘Course it works…”, scoffed Dean as he shook his head; but then he suddenly frowned, “Dude. Have you
“Yes”, he said gently, “And I think you should do it”
Dean gave him half a smile and dusted his hands.
“It´s fine, Kevin. You´re safe”, grunted Sam through the pain.
“What do I do?”, he asked with nervous puppy eyes, “How do I make this work?”
“Good night, Dean”
When he looked back at the hunter, he was smirking a bit and raising the little potion bottle on his hand, wiggling it a little between his fingers.
And as he smiled tensely, he covertly squeezed the angel´s arm with crushing strength.
“Where´s Jessica?”
The four Spells moved through the whole kingdom, faster than the fastest horsemen, affecting people at random. No one knew until much later that they ran through Ley Lines, natural courses of magic that had not been discovered yet at that time. Since they didn’t match the roads, or rivers, or flows of people, anything anyone would have found logical at the time; no one knew where one could come from. Every person had a random chance of getting any of them, none of them were more frequent in a specific area, and only Pestilence was contagious. Two brothers of the same family could get a different Spell each. It was a time of confusion and terror, of losing loved ones and not knowing what would happen next. But people didn’t give up, and after the Plagues dwindled down the fighting continued, the conflict extending for five more years.
He jumped on his seat, and the shocked spasm that ran through his muscles made him lose his grip on his beer. The bottle fell to the ground with a dull thud, spilling its contents as Dean sat up, panting.
But first things first. He shook his head in disappointment and walked two brisk steps to put two fingers to the hunter’s forehead.
idea he just got.
Dad had been gone for many years now. And Dean loved the man, to his damned core, even today. But things as they were: he had fucked Dean and Sam up in some ways that, sometimes, came back. He held no grudge. A widowed man struggling to keep two kids alive in the chaos between plagues and monsters- could have gone
He grunted and vanished one last time.
“Yep”
Dean´s eyebrows shot up. Holy Jesus, that was
The obviously exhausted hunter looked at him for a second more; then his eyes roamed around the room in confusion, to later glance back at his black-ooze leaking wound with a frown.
“What?”, he asked, not understanding.
So he was so absorbed in his work that he did not realize how long he´d been studying until it was too late.
The angel got his eyes back on him, frowned and gave him a feisty smile.
“I… I don´t know”, he said again, wise as ever.
“No, no, no, I mean… Would you
this!!
“I know that”, answered Castiel annoyed, “But if I had attempted to heal myself, I would have just exhausted my power. I would have only healed a part of me, and Sam and Kevin would still be hurt. It made no sense”
The mage took his head from his arms, eyebrows raised in surprise. Or… it could have helped. Dean had, after all, just been shown the luxuries of running, hot water. This could play to his advantage.
“Relax, man. I´m sure your fiancée will understand, jeez”, growled Dean.
“Hmm”, Dean grunted in what Cas really hoped was a clinical examination of the dark marks, and not a slightly condescending appreciation of his not so muscular physique, “Doesn’t look too bad. I get a bit more than that from a potion. You should be fine for now. Possibly can take several doses like that”
“Dean!”
“Are you sure?”, he asked with, to his embarrassment, a weak voice, “I-I don’t want to cause any delays”
“I was also taken by Pestilence, in the Apocalypse”, Cas delivered looking up.
”, Dean said with a little mocking tone, “What the hell am I doing here? You needed a guinea pig or something? What did you bring me here for?”
, an awful stinging pain on his knee; as more thunder and that
A changing pattern appeared on creatures whose body had the shape of a ball, as big as the biggest pumpkins Dean had seen in some farms. They had four back-bowed legs on which they were hunching, and short arms finished in razor claws. Upon being discovered, one by one they started an angry growl, their scales turning into their original pattern of black dots on dark, brownish red. Their teeth were showing, several rows of them, sharp as knives.
Dean had his sword, he was standing in a clearing where sunlight shone onto through the trees… and he started to make his sword dance.
And he doubted, for a second… But then he looked up into the reddening sky. He might. But he might not. This could work. He felt… he felt they could make this work.
They stayed silent. Dean didn’t move, looking up at him, lips sealed, eyes wide. Cas still balled his fists, eyes staring hard at the hunter. The crackling of the flames seemed loud in the stillness. The tension in the air could have been cut with a knife.
“She took you into a world that was not real, Dean. You started attacking me…”
The mage looked at him with wide eyes. Dean seemed more serious than angry.
“Yeah”, Cas mumbled, stepping back, “So, you eat. The message is on its way. I´ll have dinner while you eat. Get some rest. I hope we can have an answer when dinner is over”
“I… I can´t, its too much, too much pain…”
Dean smiled back before taking it, and they both disappeared from the forest.
“Man”, the hunter added in a complaining tone, “You´re not tuned with your instincts
Gah, I love the journey between absolute fluff to absolute horror. I´m so sorry for Dean xD Realized how the Echidna has taken Dean´s memories and warped them to her will? I love it when she starts losing control of the dream... Poor Sam xD
“Hey, if you´re backing out on our deal, it´s totally fine; just teleport me and let me go on my merry way”, Dean said in a detached tone from his side of the bed.
“I remembered you liked it, boy. Called it the best scotch you´d ever had. So I bought it in case something special happened”
“You got enough mojo to send us back?”, Dean said tilting his head with a kind expression, “Or do you need to get some rest first?”
He heard Kevin make a frightened sound.
Then three.
Cas stopped in front of his bedroom door to sigh. He couldn’t believe he´d finally made it. He´d actually survived dinner; despite the lingering Corruption still on him, despite his physical weakness, and he had even surpassed Gabriel and his concerns- his big brother had, true to his word, left him with no more questions.
“Dean, I don’t wanna hurt you, please!”
“Do you really think it’s necessary?”, the mage asked, making puppy eyes.
They kicked and punched, grunted as enemies fell at their feet, too winded to talk, until suddenly some calm got to them.
The monster hunter swirled to him, registered his expression- his wide eyes, his slack jaw- and immediately took his hand to his sword.
The mage nodded quickly and took the map. Dean had been giving him pointers on how to orient himself on it as they had lunch, and he gave the noble some time to frown at it and look up to the forest and down into the parchment as he picked up their last things.
The mage opened his heavy eyes. Above, the treetops let small gaps through which the blue sky could be seen, and light poured down through. Over his head, fern leaves shook slightly with the calm breeze, the light shining through them giving them an eerie glow; the little patches of spores on their underside the only non-translucent part of them. Birds chirped around, unseen between the tree branches.
you are! You fucking rebelled, man! How long has it been since you followed Heaven´s orders?”, Cas´s blue eyes opened even more, insulted, “No, man, that ain´t you”
. Even at the torture chamber, that was at exactly the other point of the maze.
“Thanks”
“Don’t sweat it, man. You´re not my type”, he blurted out with a grin as he laid back on the bed, his hands beneath his head.
“Alright”
“You are human. I am an angel”,
Until from the corner appeared… something. Slithering. Advancing at a rushed pace. Whatever had made all the demons run for their lives, forgetting their mission. A blood-freezing screech that did
“Don´t you
Dean suspected very strongly that that hadn´t been what he was going to say in the first place. He blinked at him, frowning. He didn’t really remember much else than flashes of the fight. Had he said anything in particular?
He suddenly remembered how Uriel´s questions had gathered the attention of his whole family upon him, and he laughed nervously.
“Most of my wounds are minor”, he answered.
“Very”, Dean answered with a fond smile, eyes lost in memories.
Screaming like a maniac, she run off towards the hallway.
His father did not answer. His gaze was lost in the distance, and he looked as if he weren’t listening, but Dean knew he was.
He grunted and shook his head, his eyes roaming the darkness of the abandoned house. His brother had been cornered, he was surrounded. Dean gritted his teeth and wobbly walked one, two steps, three; he got to one of the raged victims and turned it towards him to punch it in the face.
Cas blinked and looked again. There was not a creature in sight. No birds, no monsters, nothing but plants all around. The bushes at the other side of the clearing had flowers as big as his spread hand. At several points, some junipers broke the fern sea. He didn´t see anything particular.
But suddenly he looked up.
“You never told me…”, he said softly, “And… I never thought of it. I just never… saw us in that way. You know?”
He turned very serious eyes to him.
dead in a forest means
It’s not like he
He hadn ́t really stopped to think about what was coming, as he had started to remove the unconscious hunter ́s clothes. He had been simply too annoyed at how much more difficult than expected the task was. Why would anyone need so many buckles, and so many different parts stacked onto another? The man was heavy, too; moving him around to remove armor parts and layers of clothing had become rapidly taxing.
Dean blinked owlishly as his brother pushed the scrambled eggs into different plates.
“Cas!!!”, Dean screamed, “Sam!!!”
“I had an errand. Funny to find Dean here”, he said looking towards his brother in feign surprise.
“Awesome, Cas. That´s awesome. You think you can do that?”
(If you click like, as soon as I post this, it might still be processing, please give it a little time!)
“It´s too cramped in here!”
“We make time for what´s important”, he replied.
After that I´ve tried several times to do the audio clip- but it just doesn´t click. So sorry, no audio clip in the end. Maybe I will someday come back and do it, or do something else entirely. However, the chapter´s ready, so here you go :)
He needed to be nursed back to health, but without more magic, it would take some time. Cas was sure he´d be able to avoid his family for the next day, at least. After all, he was returning from the Academy- he came with work to do, so they wouldn´t be surprised if he got too engrossed with his studies and didn’t leave the room. They couldn’t find out.
, he had thought.
And he widened his mouth in horror upon seeing the two endregas running towards them.
He was covered in black blood and grime, except where trails of sweat had cleaned them down from his skin. His face was set in a pained but smiling expression, teeth bared defiantly against his enemy. He roared and charged, and delivered a savage blow with his longsword to the chest of the monster. The monster stepped back, and somehow that six-foot-tall man tackled the huge beast when it was trying to regain its balance and made it fall to the ground. Towering over him, he raised his black steel.
He still glared at Cas, not liking how that sounded. The angel had pleading eyes on him, as if begging him to comprehend.
In a merciful turn of events, Dean turned his head to look towards him for the first time in what seemed like an hour, and he slowed down until he stopped. Cas stopped by his side, hands on his knees, feeling incredibly grateful.
“How is this even…?”, the hunter looked at the mechanism in absolute disconcertment.
“Sammy…?”, he rasped.
Castiel woke up to the sound of flames crackling. Everything around him was warm, comfortable, clean, and wonderful- yet some pressing feeling nagged him and urged him to open his eyes.
?”, he said with a slightly shocked expression.
The mage smiled wider and nodded.
“You don ́t know that”, Dean snapped back as he reached forward towards his discarded clothes, bloodied and rumpled on the floor.
Something, many things, were approaching them slowly, prowling in a closing circle around them.
Castiel´s mind was racing. He really didn´t have that many resources. Light magic would do nothing now, but…
The young mage took a deep breath and let it out in a silent sigh.
“But you’re not sure”, Dean pressed.
“Get rid of your magical gear, man! These things eat magic!”
And each of them was, of course, a mage, a noble. Someone they might know.
He could have died. It had been so stupidly close. He was trembling all over.
And the fire rose up.
He still had to decide what he would do with the bag of contention the noble had gifted him (as if it was nothing, by the way). It cost a pretty penny- so it
“Yeah…”
, Dean. Think of that, just for a second”
“We gotta talk, Cassie”, the first Gabriel answered him.
, but it is awesome”, he said with a lewd smile after finishing his first cup and extending it forward to Cas.
, so similar to the way his mother sometimes talked, that he started a bit and frowned.
“What do you mean? What do you expect?”, said Sam with glinting eyes.
Maybe the peasant’s initial reserve against nobles had some grounding.
“Ah, no, I mean not very much, and of course, way less than their soul…”, Sam babbled.
“We let the potions finish preparing over the night. We wait for the information from the rangers. Meanwhile… we rest”
“More incoming”, Dean announced.
, he thought, raw emotion on his chest making his breathing a bit labored.
As the dead enemy fell to the ground, the hunter whirled his head to look at the plant creature. He snapped back to see the remaining centipedes closing in, and Cas saw him take a calculated risk.
, he thought, eyes still closed.
“Everything I do is related to the Academy, one way or another”, he chuckled nervously.
Naomi of the House of the Mighty entered the room, and the light seemed to dim a bit at her entrance. Her dress of deep dark blue was as luxurious as the garment of the second most powerful person in the Kingdom of Heaven should be. Her blond hair was perfectly held in a silvery net decorated by pearls. Master wielder of lightomancy, elemental magic, kinetomancy and mind-bending; her vast power was felt in the air, the slightest buzz of energy around her.
“What is it?”
“For just in case”, Dean patted on the back of his trousers.
“He sat there, probably had dinner or something. And…”, Dean added, pointing up.
Dean took the wheel and stared into the road for a moment. He let out a sigh. He remembered how tense he´d been driving here... It seemed it had passed a year since that.
The hunter was glaring at him even before the door got completely open.
“No one, ever?”, asked his brother.
“A sabbatical. From Heaven?”
“Our… peoples live very differently”, Cas tried to add, softly and compassionately, a bit shaken by his own reaction, “And did I just tell you we don’t get sick... It was a valid question”
A gal jumped at Dean outta nowhere, bursting from a room, and he instinctively ducked her in the face. She staggered forward, dazed, and he realized in horror that she was one bad step from falling over the railing. He grabbed her waist and rolled with her to leave her on the ground, but he heard then someone ducked him in the back of the head, and he went down with her.
“Pheasant”, Castiel answered distracted, squinting at Dean, “With a sauce of berries and cinnamon, I believe. Our cook makes it often”
Castiel frowned at him in utter confusion as a puzzled smile creeped on his lips.
“My vessel´s arm is completely healed”, he explained slowly, as if he really didn´t want to be telling that, “The portion of my Grace that inhabitates that part of my vessel… it´s not”
He ignored him as he heard how he sat on the bed for a moment. He ignored him even harder at the sound of his clothes whispering as he changed, frowning as his gaze pierced the written words. He still ignored him as he heard the sheets rustling. Only after silence came he moved, making a gesture towards the white crystals on the walls, turning their lights off with a flick of his wrist- his notes left illuminated only by the candles on his desk. When he looked furtively back, he saw the hunter’s head protruding from the bedding, his back turned to him.
“No”, he managed to say as he poorly wiped his face with his sleeve, “No bandages”
, Cas thought, joyful,
“What… are you doing?”, the hunter asked in mild confusion.
would be something to take into account.
But another of the trails suddenly appeared, and he jumped to one side. He almost fell upon landing, feet slipping on something round and squishy, and he looked alarmed towards Dean, guilt clutching at his chest- who undoubtedly would have just got an enemy jumping into his back.
The hunter nodded sharply with his lips pressed and swiftly stowed the waterskin into his bag before getting to his feet.
He was finally there. He turned to Cas.
Oh, he was being such a gigantic pussy. Letting that fucking monster inside his head. And now making a whole spectacle about it…
He rolled backwards, got out of the worst of it and started rolling through the floor, trying to put the flames out. He kinda succeded, felt Kevin flapping his little hands nervously over him. When the worst of the pain ended, he was flat on his back, looking up, grunting and with half a dozen parts of his body scorched by flame. The smell of burnt hair, clothes and skin floated around him. He had lost the freaking glasses in the toss and tumble.
“Like you”, the hunter agreed in a chuckle, and he looked up from his book, “How’re ya feelin’?”
Lucifer´s… were red.
A big black spider was climbing a tree upfront, its body the size of a melon, its legs spreading even wider. It was incredibly strange that Dean hadn’t noticed it, being right in front of them. The hunter, who stopped at his call, followed his look and snorted, shaking his head dismissively.
“What the fuck”, he said, tensing up.
“Yeah, it was”, he grunted, an air of finality to his tone.
He widened his eyes suddenly. Michael talking to Gabriel, Lucifer talking to him... He winced as he closed his eyes, repressing a moan.
“What sense does it make that you die with me when you can be saved?”, Castiel pleaded, “Get to them. The second they use it, the sigil will disappear. Get to the portal before they…!”
Cas walked closer, brow pinched.
“Ah. The Four Stars people mention sometimes are the first four, then?”
The hunter looked towards his feet and struggled as it was dragged away from the endregas, and it took Castiel a moment to remember that there was a hungry plant creature in that clearing too. In his maneuvering, maybe Dean had gotten inside its reach again.
“Please”, groaned Dean, “They´re
The mage put two fingers to his forehead and concentrated for a second, to later negate with his head with a satisfied expression.
When he had put three teeth in a glass jar and slightly cleaned them with some purifying light magic, Dean had finished taking the contents of his bag out- and his expression was full of annoyance.
Honey met blue, and Gabriel grimaced a bit in frustration. His eyes lowered for a second, and when he raised them again, all of the copies he had created with mind magic disappeared.
He looked back to Cas. Then he frowned embarrassed and looked down, unable to say it to his face.
Dean threw the spray can and scrambled to his feet, running towards the door, but not before smiling triumphantly in Crowley´s direction.
“Nah, they´re sleeping. I guess that´s one way we can do this”, he shot a look towards his brother, “Take them one by one, stealthy style, send them to dreamland. Until we can go face queen bee”
He looked back at the drooling, menacing plant- seeing now that he was closer that the bottom of the flowers ended in a tube that would continue down the stem… and that at the base of several stems were swollen lumps, obviously containing other creatures the plant had previously captured and were still being digested.
, he told himself, and with a deep breath he forced himself to let go of the cape. Dean wasn´t looking anyway…
Every conversation stopped, every movement paused in mid-way. All their faces turned to the small bell on the wall that had just rung.
He opened his eyes to cast a look too. Black patches had appeared, marring his pale skin. Two or three had grown and elongated a few inches into undulated tendrils, one extending towards the center of his chest, the rest trying to climb up towards his neck- but still very far from achieving it.
“Ah. That makes sense”
“It is”, he answered as he nodded, “The flavor combination is very nice, and also the mix of textures. The bread is crunchy, but the ingredients inside are juicy”
Cas gulped and blinked, fighting for that his world stopped spinning.
, he thought, forcing some positive cheer into his head,
knows, Dean thought as he smiled to himself.
Dean shook his head with an amused smile and munched on his improvised sandwich. This time it was some type of fish. Living so far away from the coast, he had never had fresh fish in his life. He’d always thought that the western part of the Kingdom only got smoked or salted stuff. Of course, he should have known that the nobles that were able to afford it could have fresh fish teleported to their kitchens every morning.
ominous and urgent that we should know about?”
idea had been just plain stupid.
“Cas?”
“Sure, pal. You earned it. Come on, let´s get you sitting at least”
“You did good, son. Proud of ya”, said as he squished his shoulder a bit before letting his hand down.
Dean looked towards the door, tension on his shoulders, until an answer came back.
The mage´s eyes hovered over the room for an instant, registering that the closet door was slightly ajar, probably cause the hunter had looked inside. Castiel walked past Dean, who was sitting on the bed, to leave his pajamas on the chair by the desk.
He took two fingers to the man ́s temple, eyes closed, to confirm what he already suspected: there was an infection.
“Well, you lasted a lot if you´re not trained”, the hunter commented.
“Guys”, whispered Sam urgently.
“Castiel!”, he said, smiling cheerfully.
He rummaged in his bag until he found a blue crystal prism with tipped edges. He frowned at it for a second, and then to the bag where some very valuable blooms were going to be wasted immediately. His teachers were going to kill him too.
“I promise, you will feel better in the morning. Then we will reassess the situation. I ́ll see what I can do to help you find your brother, okay?”, said in a firm, caring voice, “Maybe I can make you some potions, or find something that helps you move quicker”
“Yeah but… you´re studying already, right? You mentioned an Academy? That you trained there for years”
Dean nodded as he pursed his lips and gave the bottle to Castiel. As the mage uncapped it, the hunter stood up again and stretched a bit, his eyes scanning their surroundings. He felt suddenly much more tired. Jesus, he was gonna burst some blood vessel on the head or something if he didn’t stop finding scenarios that could mean his baby brother was dead.
“So, what did you do this week?”
“How´s Cas?”, said Sam after gulping, resting his hips into the counter.
Castiel looked away. It was true that magical ingredients and equipment were amongst the most expensive items anyone could find.
And quickly, before the angel could resist, threw both of them into the fall of flame.
“Oh”, Cas nodded, interested.
The hunter bent a knee and rested an elbow on it, his other hand on the pillow, turning his body towards Cas. His chest was still bare, half-covered in bandages. The posture looked good on him, and he seemed to be aware of it and comfortable about it. Despite his obvious general discomfort, he managed to seem relaxed. He gave the mage a nonchalant smile.
“Dean? What is it?”
And his neck was exposed enough so that the beginning of his clavicle was visible.
Cause shit, he hoped it was more of those centipedes… but the movement pattern didn’t match. This was a pack of smaller things.
The sight immediately changed his thoughts, calming them. He couldn’t help but smile, reveling in the sight. He had seen the Doomed Forest of Wyvernon a thousand times from the air- but so little of what was beneath the treetops.
He waited at the end of the stairs with his foot tapping impatiently. Anticipation rolled in his chest and made his guts all giddy. It was
Castiel blinked at him in confusion.
”, he begged him, making Cas´s eyes wide, “be… careful. You
He could hear more screams nearby, he couldn’t figure out the direction though. He panted heavily, hissing, and grunted as the pain in his head pulsed, and pulsed, before starting to recede.
“No, Sammy!! I can get you out, I can…!!”
But that train of thought crashed and burned as he blabbed out a strangled sound, flinching in place, his arms raising in an awkward movement of futile defense.
“I warn you, boy. I´m less delicate than the doctor here”
“You”, he pointed at him as his breathing speeded, “are
“He´s got you there, you know”, he chuckled, “You´re not the cooking oven for nine months”
”, Gabriel chided, frowning, annoyance masking his fear, “I don’t want to find my baby brother on a pile of his own goo one day, okay?”
“There you go, son”, his dad said delivering them, then clapping his shoulder and leaving his hand there for a moment as he looked around, “Good party, huh?”
of invisible force pushed them back while they whined. The angel wobbled on his feet, obviously much more tired than a second before; Dean caught him. The angel held onto his arms for a second till he got his balance back, then released him.
“Can you lend me a hand with that?”, he finally asked, looking up at the hunter.
”, Cas moaned as he got to his feet.
“Whatever”, Dean snorted as he walked around the bed to the other side.
“Seventh son”, the mage provided.
He licked his lips, bit his lower one.
The mage looked at Dean, not understanding what he meant at all. How would he know? That… was the whole hunting strategy of the lignarium.
”, Castiel answered sassily, and he marched towards the lab table.
“And I´m sorry!”, he snapped, “Cause that’s- that´s not what you deserve! You´re frigging awesome, and you deserve someone that… that loves you in that… sure, complete and
“Easy there, tigress”, he purred in her ear, smiling from ear to ear.
“What?”, he asked, and Cas sighed.
“It’s practically harmless, Cas. Throw something at them and they’ll run for the hills”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know that now”
The angel was surely looking at Jess as if she was God herself. The woman blushed slightly.
“Sorry, Cas. I know you´re my doctor and all- but you also said you wouldn´t hold me here against my will”
Dean´s eyes got lost in the garden for a second, a million memories making him smile to himself. He remembered his first kiss, under that tree. The year his dad and he tried to build a treehouse for Sammy, failing horrendously, but having such a great time together. All those lazy summer afternoons chasing after his little brother, who just kept growing more and more every year, until he wasn´t so little…
Castiel’s gaze shifted to one side, pensive.
The woman entered the room, looking around wildly, her black hair a mess.
“Okay, then I declare this slumber party over. I´m taking Cas to a bed and then I´m gonna eat something and
Castiel was tense like a coil, his eyes searching in the middle distance, as if he tried to understand something that he couldn’t grasp. He slightly frowned in… fear, horror, as he rose his head to look to the right path.
, thank you”
I would have gone to you. I just... thought that… It was stupid”, he finished, not knowing how to continue the lie.
And then they both shared one of those love-dovey looks that Dean usually mocked them for. But not this time. This time he let their love stretch through as much time as they wanted.
“Hello, brother”, sang at unison a chorus of Gabriels.
Gah! I´m sorry I didn´t post last Sunday. This was gonna be one of the chapters that came with an audio clip- I wanted to do a little montage of me narrating the first action scene to some epic music. However, last week was creatively very exhausting for me- I got eagerly back on the horse of Dreams of Perdition and published a chapter of it, then two days later I got the idea for the little scene in Try (15x19 fix-it-fic), I´ve started to plan a roleplaying game in the Supernatural world (which has got me writing and designing so many things)... And when Sunday night came I just felt I couldn't do more xD
“I… think someone has attempted it in the past”, he murmured, “But I don’t believe anyone has succeeded ever. And I seriously doubt that any doctor would do that to you even if they could, no matter how injured you get”
Castiel´s eyes widened.
“One, two, three!”, directed Ellen.
“Yes, Sam. Thank you. This will be very helpful”
Dean´s heart was pounding fast. He was so fucking nervous, frozen two steps away at his father´s back. He wanted to disappear, to be a state away-
“Yes, I´m just… tired”
That brought some gleam to the mage’s eyes.
“You are being healed”, he said after he cleared his throat. He smiled, and gave him his most reassuring, loving voice, “You´re gonna be okay”
“Oh, shit”, Sam muttered.
“Okay. Alright. I can be cool”, the angel murmured, his eyes flicking in all directions in intense thought.
After all, it hadn’t been a total clusterfuck, Dean decided. The monster was dead, the vics safe, both of them alive, minor wounds only.
The pleasant buzz of alcohol through his body lulled him deeper and deeper, he smiled at it gratefully. The noise and the light from the TV were gone. It was just dark, blissfully dark. Dark, and quiet…
for a second. A cold fear started to spread through all of his body, and he didn´t know where it came from; maybe from an old memory, or an invasive thought, or just… just the memory of a nightmare of something that never ever came to be real…
Special thanks as always to Pax, my awesome beta-reader!! And everyone that likes this and tells me and makes me be motivated for it ^^ I send you all the love!
“Hello, Sam”, they heard a gravelly voice.
As always, this chapter was written to music: an apocalyptic music compilation to inspire the nightmare (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBUQppVsMp0) and for the rest, a relaxing medieval playlist that to me is starting to become Kingdom of Heaven´s official soundtrack (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27e0A74_4Lc).
“Promise me you won´t do anything like that without me around again”, he said firmly.
Suddenly, movement caught his eye. Sam was waving at him from the other side of the garden. His face was lit and his movements to make him go over there were frantic.
heal you. I promise you that”, said the mage looking at him intensely.
What a shock.
“I´m processing”, he answered to the mage´s inquisitive look.
This is barely edited, I might have to come back in the future to do some changes; but I sincerely dont have the energy to review it now. I'm low key surprised I got enough to post xD Episode 20 broke me and writing has become something really really hard. Idk how often Ill update. I guess comments could help but i don't know. Life sucks lately a lot xD
The Road So Far: Dean has stayed in Castiel´s room for a couple of days, as he recovered from his wounds. He´s not totally healed yet, and Castiel cannot heal him with the lingering Corruption still in him- but he´s impatient to start looking for Sam already. Right before the mage took him back to Wyvernon Forest, Cas had to go to dinner with his family. There, he has an idea regarding Dean and his immediate future. However... he finds him naked when he gets back to his room.
Dean made half a smile and sat at the base of a tree. Cas followed him dragging his feet and plopped down.
- and showed him the spray can that he still held in his right hand.
Cas´s attention snapped back, his initial fear reigning down. They had a plan. This was just another training exercise- and he could do this.
“Wow, what?”, he asked in sudden worry, frowning.
As Cas put his hands on his knees, getting his breath back, Dean looked at the monsters. The endrega rumbled, legs still moving, its rage giving it even more strength, vines ripping everywhere. The hunter slowly raised his eyebrows, face relaxing into the beginnings of an… unbelieving smile.
Sam looked at Dean, insecure. He still didn’t like it.
“After that, dad took Sammy and I and we started moving around. We lived on the road ever since. Never settled down. Guess we got used to it. Dad thought we could avoid the plagues if we avoided people and settling”
“Best I´ve been in in years”, nodded Dean.
“Hey!!!”
“What do you see?”, he asked the mage with half a smile, warmth in his eyes.
“Well, you did save me first”, he answered cockily, some warmth on his eyes.
, regardless of sex or gender. We´re gonna love them the same”
But I got stuck on that one, I went to reread this one... and realized how much I missed it and how many things I had planned for it! And BOOM suddenly I´ve spent 6 hours writing nonstop and this chapter appeared. Woohoo! I´m super happy!
“Yes”, Castiel sighed, “I… always have the best intentions, but it never works out. I wonder… if I´m trying to act against my nature. Maybe that’s why it… backfires”
“As… much as they have cared for me, sir…”, Cas said, apparently a bit of confidence giving him more speech abilities, “They are… very good hunters. I wouldn´t wish anyone else than them watching my back”
“What in the world is this? Water falls from the ceiling?”
“I didn´t see a reason why, no”, Cas answered, a firm frowned expression in his face, “None of you can heal it. You can´t do anything to help me. It´s not a severe wound. It won´t spread, it won´t get worse. It just hurts. It will get better in a few days”
Castiel took a deep breath, trying to calm his irritation and nerves. He felt stupid and annoyed. He was a professional, dammit. A healer, a doctor- and anatomy was just anatomy. But he could not help but feel uncomfortable.
“M… Mum… Dad?”, Dean managed to say, panic rising in his chest.
He opened his eyes to see only red and black. Flames in the darkness, infinity all around him only crossed by chains and smoke. The smell of sulfur filled his senses, and the one of the rotting metal of the crooked knife that was slowly getting closer to his chest.
Dean had fallen onto his knees at some point. He didn´t know when. He was sobbing, but he wasn’t aware. His eyes couldn’t tear off the glass. He could only see red flames, whirling and dancing.
“Don’t get distracted, and don´t wander off”, Dean continued instructing him.
“I said magical creatures”, Cas added, an amused glean on his eyes, “I believe the term
“That true?”, asked Dean, cocking a curious eyebrow.
He considered for a moment asking magically his blood to leave his face, fearing his raging blush would be more of a cause of mockery for Dean than his exposed skin- but he was so magically tired that he couldn’t help but close his eyes and sigh in defeat at the thought. He felt he would not be able to do any magic at all in a while, and he doubted he could perform any important magical feats for the rest of the day.
“What ́s the last thing you remember, Dean?”, asked Cas, sitting on the mattress beside him.
When he was done with the arm, he looked up again. It was a bit silly not to clean his face too. He begged mentally that he wouldn ́t wake up just then, as he took grime and blood from his forehead. As he finished, he let out a breath he hadn ́t realized he ́d been holding, and left the towel and basin on the floor.
Castiel smiled slightly at the shared memories as he folded neatly the piece of cloth around the small leftovers and rummaged in his bag in search for his little baked dessert. In a flash of insight, Dean frowned.
“Fahter”, he answered before gulping down, “Also if a monster comes to eat my ass I won’t have to stop to pick it all up or leave it behind, I can take it with me”
“It is”, admitted their mother, “Everyone assumes it´s just the calm before the storm. Or maybe that the last attack took too much from the enemy, and they need some recovery time. However it is, time is time, and the pause in hostilities can prove useful for us. Without lowering their guard, Heaven´s Army is using this recess to reinforce their lines and build stronger defense posts. Soldiers are being relocated, in an attempt to create a stronger barrier that won´t be surpassed again- so new recruits and reserve soldiers might be called to arms in the next months”
Dean looked up at the treetop-covered sky.
Im just realizing a big chunk of this fic is Dean suffering. Im gonna go add more tags in relation to that xD
Cas gave him a sympathetic smile.
Then came the rise of hunters.
“Did he talk to you?”
Dean looked at him in confusion.
“Come”, he asked.
Sam and Dean had to be looking for him. They would be coming. They would save him. He couldn’t give Crowley this power. He…
Dean looked at him with shocked eyes.
“Okay. I´m going to bed, then”, he said as he stood up and turned around, “See you in the morning”
Dean widened his eyes very much. How, how could he say it out loud? He felt a wave of second embarrassment. The mage seemed ashamed alright, still with his back turned to him.
. Sorta”, he added in a grunt, “Managed to get rid of two things- in my book that counts as fighting. Even if you didn’t wield a blade for two fucking seconds”
“Magic”, Dean whispered before joining the song.
A small fluff of wings and the slightest groan followed the question.
Crowley got closer, head tilted with interest.
“Meaning… they could teleport you back to the forest, sick and wounded, which would mean your death. Or… accuse you of trying to steal. Which would mean hanging”, his voice lowered in volume as he spoke.
, he said only with his eyes.
Over the years of his early training as a hunter, it had been hard to not be continuously spooked and paranoid, learning to dismiss false signals when they came. But now he turned easily his attention to Castiel once more.
His blue gaze was like a calming balm, and Dean´s shoulders untightened. Someone must have cracked some fireworks at a nearby house or something.
Tomorrow. He sighed. He was supposed to go hunting tomorrow. He scratched at the veins the Corruption had marred his chest with. He needed his rest.
Dean looked at his brother, in puzzled confusion.
With no hesitation and a word of power, Castiel thrust the teleportation crystal into the ground, beside the fallen warrior. Still clutching it, he murmured the incantation needed to bind the bluestone to the place, that would make it an anchor for magic, and that could not be revoked unless someone used magic on it too.
The mage turned his head to him, eyes widening in joy.
“Okay…”
“I am sorry”, he said, frowning in slight anxiety as he stood awkwardly in front of her for a second, “I did not know about the… wrapping tradition. I didn´t know it was supposed to be wrapped in colored paper”, he clarified, and then abruptly extended his arms to the front to offer the object, a tinge of regret to his demeanor.
“S-Something… brushed my foot”, he babbled.
Castiel blinked at him, confused.
“You just have to put a drop of blood into the mix”, he said, “And we will know”
Castiel´s mind clicked, understanding what Dean was implying, what he was understanding; and he made a startled babble as his face flushed furiously.
Cas blinked… slowly understanding. He had been checking his eyes. Seeing if they had gone all black.
“Good night, Charlie”
He saw the room turn a lighter color, and by his side Dean inhaled sharply; the mage felt him shift suddenly on the bed.
“You… do call it
But nothing happened. Not a single crack. It didn’t move an inch.
Dean pitied him so fucking much. He hated when someone else pitied him- but damn, he couldn’t help it. Dean was a sexual creature. He
Desperately turning his head to the ground, one arm still protecting it; he threw his hand down and lashed a push of force directly into the rock.
“Yeah. Or you know, like, I don´t know. Getting someone else´s soul in me”, Lucifer made a grimace of disgust, “God forbid… Could they be moved, stored in some way, or transferred or whatever?”
“Dean, should I really have said yes?”, he heard Cas ask in a worried whisper while his eyes still trailed his dad, “Alcohol consumption is often related by some individuals with poor judgment and low discipline; also, I´m an angel, he knows I usually don´t drink or eat, so why…?”
“Nothing”, he tried to say nonchalantly.
It took the separate thuds to become a series of increasingly erratic pats for Castiel to understand that Dean did not know how to open the panel door.
Cas, his mouth still wide open, closed it to gulp and nodded, frowning slightly. Dean´s severe gaze still pierced him, and he started to feel uncomfortable- and ashamed.
Fuck. How had his happened? Maybe… He was used to hunting with Sammy. To him watching his back. Sammy would have felt the danger, as he had. Sammy would have seen the leaves move as something slowly approached them, as he would.
The angel looked at the hunter, frustration and pleading in his eyes; but Dean didn´t relent an inch.
“Hey. How´re you holding up?”, his brother asked him lightly, faking less concern than he obviously felt.
“I”, started Cas, danger in his voice, “am an
“Also”, he added, voice resonating in the cold stone, “Some intruders have arrived through some kind of transportation method. A portal, a sigil, a magical object. Find it, and destroy it. They must be stopped at all costs. Hellhounds, focus on the angel. Get me those wings. Demons, go get the humans”
Kevin suddenly closed his eyes, startled. But despite the sudden movement, no more pain arose. He felt his face wet. He opened them and blinked in confusion. Some liquid was staining his cheek.
“A´ight”, said Dean, “Then I don’t know when, but get one, okay? I´ll make you the drawing and you go wherever you nobles can go to get a tattoo”
“It´s alright, Dean. Everything´s alright”, Cas said in a steady, calming voice, “You know that sometimes we get spooked by sudden sounds, it comes with the hunting. There´s no shame in it, you know it happens to me too. It was those fireworks, right?”
“Hey! Hey, can you hear me?”, he asked as he kneeled at his side and turned him over.
The angel smiled, and so did he. Maybe he didn’t know exactly where his heart was going, but every certainty he could, he would give it to him.
going to show his wet, reddened eyes, thank you very much- and pressed
“Oh, no, no name repeats”, Sam sighed, “Or family reunions will be a mess”
“Yeap”, said Dean raising two red-stained machetes.
Sam let out a merry laugh.
“How does it work exactly?”, Dean asked as he observed, trying to get Cas to talk excitedly about magic like other times.
with a thud, and a big thing screeched loudly as it retreated a step, clutching at the tree bark of one of the pines.
“Absolutely not”, Cas said firmly, “You are my guest, and my patient, and you need to rest. Sleep is very important for healing. This bed is big enough for three or four people. We will be very far away. When I feel better, I´ll… find a better way”
”, he looked at him, accusing, “You decided to accept death, first thing. Like, your first fucking option. When we could still find ways to get you out of the fire, to freaking fight back; death was your
He was wondering how sick he could get if he ate the days-old leftovers from the fridge- and how worth it could be- when the smell of grilled cheese hit his nostrils, right before a sizzling noise got to him while he was still on the hallway. He was already smiling when he got to the kitchen door.
“Everything alright, brother?”
Dean´s labored breathing was the only thing that broke the stillness for some seconds. The hunter had stepped over the fallen mage, dagger held in an upside-down grip; and stayed on his guard scowling at the creature, until it hadn´t moved for almost ten seconds.
“Oh. Sun, sun is better”, the mage muttered to himself, remembering, and looked up to the treetops.
, you went and healed me”
sound that echoed through the hallways, and made his hair and coat swirl a second in the wind it created.
He looked happier. A feeling of satisfaction and
“Maybe”, Cas conceded.
“Dinner will be served in twenty minutes, sir”
“Of course, Lucifer. What is it?”, he asked compliantly.
“Dean?”, the mage asked in a confused tone, and he felt the mage turning to look at him.
Dean was looking at him very intently, a slight frown on his face.
“You and I”, Cas heard Gabriel whisper, “are not done”
Dean smiled, still nervous though. Jack was wearing the same clothes he had last seen him in. The white jacket suited him, he thought. He was on the other side of the road, and his expression was serene. He felt… so far away from him. Not only cause of the physical distance. There was something about him that was like, unreachable. He realized that had been that what had prevented him or his brother to hug him goodbye two days earlier. It felt like, it didn’t proceed, like it wasn´t what it was supposed to happen. Things were different now.
Castiel turned his head towards the garden, frowning in concentration.
Both brothers made sure to walk in front of her, shoulder to shoulder, obscuring her view until they reached the garden access. Then they looked at each other with stupid giddy expressions, each took one of the doors and they opened them suddenly.
where Sammy´s really gone”, Dean answered, and he let out a frustrated sigh, “I preferred to check periodically if the trail and the way to the nest matched…”
He ran. Along stonewall corridors decorated with portraits, with tapestries, with sets of armor. Glowing orange crystals illuminated every hallway, set into the stone by cold silver claws. He tried his best not to fall down the spiral staircase, and almost slid when he took the turn that would lead him to the antechamber of the Great Hall.
!!”, he snarled as he took his fists down in a sudden motion.
“Also for that, for the life magic”, he added as naturally as he could, “I´m going to need you to bring me a dinner that’s twice the normal amount. I´m giving myself the strength of an animal, you see. I have to eat more”, he tried to smile, “And stay focused. So I´ll eat it in my room”
“And it kinda worked. None of the three of us caught any of the other Spells”, he continued, but he made a bitter half-smile, “Well, we got through the Apocalypse alright, but then Sammy was taken by The Darkness”
At his side, Cas wobbled for a second and panted while blinking, killing his joy a bit. Was he too tired for a second trip?
“Aight”, chuckled the old hunter, hand still on his pockets.
His tongue burned with the taste of the best scotch he´d ever had, once at Bobby´s.
The fury on Crowley´s eyes as he looked down to the floor, where Dean had been drawing while Kevin was being freed a huge devil´s trap that surrounded the chair and engulfed most of the room, could have melt stone. Especially when he realized that with his push, he had sent Dean out of the trap, and therefore out of his reach.
“It-It really isn´t that important, Cas…”, Sam started.
, Dean couldn’t help but think.
“Oh!”, he exclaimed, worry and shame rushing over him, “I’m so sorry…!”
“Yes, mother”, he answered lightly.
“I can do things seriously when it´s needed, Cas, I thought you knew…”, Gabriel continued saying, frustrated.
d, he remembered with a chill.
“I’d guess so, yes. My brothers…”, Cas frowned, eyes lost in the memory, “My mother took me and my younger siblings to the roof, and asked my eldest brothers to end it. The Four Stars fought Zachariah while Uriel and my mother stayed with us. Part of the fight was through illusions, so we missed a lot… since we weren’t affected. But they took him down. And we saw… all of it”, he did not bring himself to say
Shoot. The message. Cas blinked for a second before nodding. He rushed to his desk and took a quill to start scribbling rapidly on a piece of parchment.
“Dean, a disease needs a known cure for it to be healed”, he tried to explain calmly, but hurt was rolling in his heart, “No one had a cure for the Plagues when they arrived”
because of you!!”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa; easy”, he heard somewhere close to him.
The noble blinked and looked up at that. After resting he wasn’t feeling as bad as after the fight- but one thing was being able to stand, and another to walk for a long time through the forest. He could not remember a time he had exerted himself as much as he had that day, both physically (by running, walking on tough terrain, dodging charging endragas) and magically. He had tried, but after a little while he had stopped being able to pay attention to his surroundings, and he had simply followed Dean’s steps blindly. Startled out of his reverie by the pause, the exhaustion of his body crashed down on him suddenly.
He sounded defeated. Well, at least he wasn’t screaming at the one being that had sacrificed for him a thousand times.
Castiel knew perfectly well what was happening to him. He fully understood it, found it logical; and if he stopped to think about it for a second, he knew that it was bound to happen someday.
“Okay,
“Look at him…”, another of the Gabriels was whispering to his neighbor, eyes on the first Gabriel that had talked.
He raised him from perdition so long ago. It was high time he repaid the favor.
“But the best way to eliminate it from your system is an antidote. So I have to go for a moment”, he continued as he smiled softly.
Next time. Holy damn. He should not be doing this, but his mind was already thinking there would be a next time. He shook his head in disbelief. His eyes caught the glimpse of the dagger, which the man still was clutching.  He took it and left it on a nightstand, spared a last glance to the wounded man… and turned around to get to work.
The mage opened his mouth, speechless for a second… realizing what his brother thought. That he had tried something that was
And he
When Cas opened his eyes, the light was suddenly bright, the air smelled fresh and humid, and around him a chorus of roars rose.
And as he saw teeth flashing fastly towards him, roars rising, he covered his head with his arms, gathering power desperately for an expansive wave that -he prayed- he could shoot in time to prevent the beasts from ending him.
, cold and moist and heavy, and twisting in his stomach, in his chest.
Castiel looked up at Dean, blinking in slight surprise.
The mage poured more alcohol on the slashes, and caught a rivulet that ran through his midsection towards the bed with a movement that cleaned his waist and part of his hip. His pants were still on, since his magical injury assessment had revealed to him that he was only hurt on his upper body. He wiped the excess alcohol from the wounds in cautious little taps, his breath held, trying so hard not to disturb his rest. When he finished, he let it out in a satisfied sigh as he made a small smile, looking up at the face of his peacefully sleeping patient.
“Well, I could say the same to you”, the angel frowned at him.
“Does she have a blue handprint somewhere?”
“Pheromones? Wouldn´t that attract the big beasts for, you know, mating?”
, thought Dean, taking a step to go back up the stairs himself.
“Gotta go, kiddo. Stay safe”
Castiel felt a warm sensation bloom on his chest as an eager small smile spread on his face before he looked down. After that trying day, that made him feel so much better, like a reward for trying so hard. He reveled on the sensation for a second, happy and relieved.
Kevin looked at him, a spark of hope on his eyes.
“Ah…”, Sam said, at a loss for words.
“Huh. You let that one go easier than I thought”, he said raising his eyebrows.
“Uuh. Aren´t I a bit too old for dates?”
a good liar, and he knew it.
He scowled in defiance as he started passing the razor down his cheek. The last thing he would do was anything that could remotely prove Castiel’s initial reserves about him right, about him being a
, yadda yadda yadda. And he was just
“First time this bad”, he mumbled, taking a hand to rub at his neck.
Cas knew that when he focused his power a lot, his eyes shone with a blue light… and it could be weird to watch. Dismissing the change, he sent his intentions through his veins.
Sam traded a look with Dean, who shook his head rolling his eyes, but helped him up to get to the angel. A touch was enough to make Sam take a deep breath, relieved. Cas closed his eyes after that, and if Dean hadn´t known him better, he´d said he was drifting to sleep.
The King of Hell rose an ominous hand, and suddenly his voice was ringing with power.
Cas made a claw of his left hand, gathering energy, and threw it forward when one of the trails got uncomfortably near. The pulse of force that surged from him shook the ferns, leaves swept up as if by a sudden gale, revealing the floor behind them- and a sliding creature that was starting to curve up. The spell caught onto it with full force and toppled it backwards, showing a myriad of a thousand skittling little legs.
Cas obeyed immediately, extending his hand violently- a push of energy sweeped the floor and sent six gutflayers flying back, opening the circle for just a second.
“Jack?”, Dean asked in the sky´s general direction, “I… You said you´d be in every raindrop or whatever, so… I guess you´re here, somewhere. I… I´d like to ask you a favor”
- IShip and her plant knowledge. I contacted you to ask about the antidote and later we remained in touch ^^ I feel so lucky!! Also, you were the one that came up with the "mudcrawler" term, if I recall correctly, and I love it so much! :D
He was running. He had seen it, growing in the far distance, but rushing so quickly. He didn´t know what it was… but he knew it was coming for him.
Another silence ensued… but this time, it wasn´t so tense. It was uncertain and fragile, filled with possibility, empty of so many things left unsaid, but at least with the echo of some words spoken at last…
The young healer stared at Dean for a second. Cas was still his doctor, and he needed healing. Dean seemed more pacified now. He might not immediately push him away… The hunter, feeling observed, looked up from the map and stared back into Cas.
“No, it hadn’t extended through your system yet; I was able to purify it easily”, he answered as he took his hand down.
He opened his mouth a bit in horror, looked back at Sam.
Dean didn’t know yet if he had died trying.
“It´s perfect. I think I´ll leave this here and have it after dinner”, he said, as an excuse in case the servant saw him run downstairs right away, with obviously no time to have eaten it all.
”, he said, wrinkling up his nose and mimicking Dean’s tone from earlier, “And it’s… counterintuitive to disregard life, when I know how distress on a body feels at every level. I’m not like my brother Gabriel, I do believe that humans… Maybe they are not superior to animals, but I do believe that to our Kingdom, to our society, they matter more. But I can respect them when it’s not a matter of life and death. Or starvation”, he added quickly, “I wouldn’t like that something killed me for sport. I guess other creatures might feel the same”
What do you guys think of the history of the Kingdom? This chapter gives way to our first Dean POV. Wish me luck :))
“And what if I had?”, he said in a distant voice.
Dean took a deep breath and let out a huge sigh. Well, if he was getting dressed, it meant he wanted to hunt, right? He’d seemed upset, though.
“Despite what you might believe, I had a
“But… I did nothing…”, the confused angel murmured.
Suddenly, a slithering sensation coursing up his leg. He patted at it instantly, and punched a guy on the face, sending him senseless to the floor. But another thing crawled over him, and another one on his other calf; he got bitten again at his hip. He grunted, backpedaling, cursing and brushing the things off; dodging another gal. One of the
“Any suggestions? I really don´t want to kill a bunch of innocent people, Dean”, Sam whispered in a suffering tone, “They weren´t moving until that thing commanded it. They are obviously under their control”
Second plague (The Darkness): Sam 9, Dean 13, Cas 11
“…hide”, he finished, a smile to his lips.
“Holy shit”, he gasped, “We´re home”
“Dammit”, he murmured, sitting up and stretching a bit.
- Sully for more noble insults (lowlife xD) and for helping me craft out the "I´m going to the forest/Im not/theres an attack/how does this happen" scene xD That was hard!
Castiel opened his eyes to look back at Dean. He had a hand on the bandages of his arm, and was looking back at him with an awkward expression.
“Well, but you
“Focus, Cas!”, Dean screamed as he started running, making a circle around the pack, “Five seconds!!”
“Ah”, she nodded, then smiled again, “Well, here I am”, she said as she took the phone with her other hand and angled it around up to a selfie stance, fooling around pouting her lips in a duckface, “Warm in my bed like a cinnamon bun. I´m here”, she said finally, her kind sweet smile reaching her fond eyes.
Michael started walking in her wake, then all the rest of them in a cascade practiced over the years.
They had all accepted their fate.
He looked sideways at the hunter. He had let his hand drop and his eyes were very wide, set on the flames, probably thinking he was not being observed. His expression was now… begging, as if he was desperately asking something to someone in his mind. It looked like he was holding his breath.
“Camera´s busted”, he lied, “Hunting´s not gentle on technology”
“I´m fine, I´m just… hunting, you know, it sucks”, Dean tried for nonchalant, but knew he was probably failing.
“As you well have proved dozens of times”, he nodded, “But damn, you certainly can look like one when you want”
“Yep. He… he died some years ago. A demon got to him. He… kinda died protecting me. But he killed him good in return”
“But if you want to find Sam and not die trying, you can´t be impulsive. You have to be
Dean took some more time to try to calm his stupid heart but… there was a
He staggered back two steps, flabbergasted. Nothing made sense. He looked around wildly, trying to find something for his mind to latch on to.
He blinked in surprise for a moment, then a beeping sound started.
“Dean, it´s
He felt protective of Samandriel. Respect and certain fondness towards Michael and Lucifer. And he shared a strong feeling of camaraderie with Uriel, due mostly to how much of bookworms they both were.
He found Sammy there, skillet in hand, moving around two sandwiches. Those big, bad ones he made sometimes, filled with a bit of almost everything they had on their pantry, and enough cheese so that the whole thing kinda stuck together. A whole meal between two buns. Not so commonly seen since Sammy had gotten into “healthy food”, but great for after an intense hunt.
The mage blinked and seemed to focus.
The peasant stared at him for a moment.
This dude was not just in the closet…. He could never have a husband if he wanted, or a fucking boyfriend. Hell, if what they said about nobles was true- he probably never had…
“Don’t worry about me, Cas. I’m fine, promise. I ain’t helping nobody by bleeding out. If I need help, I’ll tell ya”, he said in a low murmur without looking at him, “Rest and eat. You’ll patch me up when you feel better”
“And, and you need to become a great soldier, right?”, Dean provided with a smile, palms opening, “I thought of some things to teach you today”
“You good?”
Sam yanked him through his clothing. He was more than happy to oblige him, running towards the door, while Dean charged against the King of Hell.
Dean fluttered his eyes closed, his breathing slowed, and Cas was almost sure he had already drifted back to sleep. But then he blinked them open and searched for him.
“Yeah, I know. It’s okay. It was a warrior’s death. No hunter dies of old age, you know? I’ve accepted that too. Maybe one day I would have liked to have kids or whatever…”, Dean’s gaze got lost for a moment, “But I can’t stay put if I see people in danger, you know?”, he said looking up at Cas.
“Begin”
Cas looked at him perplexed for a second before understanding.
Kevin´s conscience came back to the present. Crowley, having completed the round around his chair, appeared again in his field of vision… holding a sack that sagged with weight. He looked sideways at him… and approached.
Holy fuck.
Sam blinked, mouth agape for a second before huffing as he smiled.
They were soon walking down the hallway. Cas was holding his arm against his torso, but no pain transcended on his face.
Over the plant creature.
“If my understanding of human reproduction is correct, I strongly suspect you barely had a brief participation on the matter”
“Yeah”, the peasant snorted, “Most on eternal leave due to nobility obligations or war calls. And the rest charge a pretty penny for a simple visit”
The kid stared at them, panting shakily, his eyes shining by unshed tears. Cas looked at him with wide eyes, silent. Dean bit his lips and looked at Sam, who stood up with his hands raised in a peaceful gesture.
The hunter started at his scream, his goblet splashing a bit in the sudden movement.
