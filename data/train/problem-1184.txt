“Because I care about you, Sherlock. Because I care about you more than I thought I would, more than I am capable of. But if you would let me, I swear to God I will try and try and try… until the day you can see why.”
John couldn’t believe his eyes. His vision blurred out from tears. He replied whilst wiping his tears away on the sleeve of his coat.
"It's a skull." John stared at it long enough to make himself acquainted, however finding it familiar. He has seen an x-ray and scans of his own skull before, but not enough for him to recognize it in his own hands.
Sherlock was hiding in his (John’s) room in the TARDIS but his curiosity got the better of him. As he walked towards the console room, he recognized a scent - expensive cologne, dry cleaning, a whiff of cigarettes and cigar - Mycroft!
The next day, Sherlock found himself in the presence of Doctor John Watson, the man he was destined to find,
…” John pointed towards future-Sherlock. “That is also Sherlock?” He looked back and forth between both Sherlocks.
The Doctor was looking for John. He knew John’s scent from his visit to Baker Street. Tilting his head up, The Doctor started sniffing in all directions. “Ah! This way!” He found the scent he was looking for, and paced quickly towards it, sniffing and walking as if he was a hound tracking down prey. A few minutes later, he found himself walking towards a bench in the park. There, he saw John with someone, having a quiet but stern conversation. The Doctor wasted no time, and moved towards them.
Both Sherlocks said the same thing at the same time. The Doctor rubbed his palms together, “Oh. This is interesting. Weird, but good.”
“So, Doctor. You are not a medical doctor. You are a time traveller, Sherlock’s friend and this box is a time machine. Your name is not Basil. And
Sherlock came out of his mind palace and found John across the table from him sipping a cup of tea. John pushed another cup towards him, looking at him fondly.
John blushed a little, thinking The Doctor was flirting with him, and maybe even stalking him? For the first time in months, John felt good about himself. Someone was interested in him, and an attractive man too. John didn’t mind the awkwardness between them, or that he was a man. He had his fair share of same-sex encounters during his tour in Afghanistan. Besides, The Doctor was exactly his type - tall, lanky and brunette, someone you don’t find in the Army a lot...
Sherlock, on the other hand, thought that John was being observant and saw through his shield. John sat Sherlock down on the edge of their bed, and lowered himself to squat in between Sherlock’s legs. His palms were on Sherlock’s knees to balance himself. Sherlock looked down, eyelids half mast, pupils dilated, his whole body tensed. John gently removed his hands, and sat himself down on the floor in front of Sherlock.
Before Sherlock could say another word, the door to the lab clicked open. Sherlock instinctively turn his head around and saw Mike walking in with someone else - a very familiar face… no, a very familiar bone structure. He first noticed the zygomatic bones, slightly lower on the left, then the maxilla, mandible, frontal, temporal (slightly obstructed by his hair) and stared into his nasal bone. The man twitched his face, a subconscious behaviour indicating his discomfort with Sherlock’s stares. Sherlock turned his head back around facing The Doctor, and with his eyes wide open, The Doctor nodded. In all of Sherlock’s life, only two people he knows had the capability of communicating with him via micro expressions and cues - Mycroft Holmes and The Doctor.
In the living room, Sherlock wanted to examine his other self closer, but The Doctor wouldn’t let him. All three of them argued back and forth via micro expressions and shuffled around the living room. The Doctor stood between the two Sherlocks, spinning left and right as Sherlock tried to reach out to himself over and over. A few seconds was all it took for them to reach an agreement - no touching.
“Well, this is where you met him. Such a downer! I was hoping you found him in a nice field of flowers under the moon… or that church we found him in.” The Doctor said as he walked down the corridor with Sherlock right on his tail.
Death In the Clouds by Agatha Christie – The Doctor loves Agatha Christie (series 3, episode 13, ‘Last of the Time Lords’; he and Donna actually met her in ‘The Unicorn and the Wasp’, series 4, episode 7).
Sherlock shot up from the floor, wasted no time at all and immediately went into his mind palace, searching for the room labelled
“I remember.” Sherlock was talking to himself as he recalled where that string of numbers came from - the TARDIS.
9 years ago, The Doctor never gave him the name he so desperately wanted, but Sherlock knew with his next words, that this man standing a few steps away from him was the one he was searching for. The Doctor is now a witness to John Watson and Sherlock Holmes’ first meeting.
“I’ve not had the same experiences as other men my age. It changes the way I see the world. Sometimes that is to my advantage. Other times it is not.”
A/N: John shouldn’t remember seeing future-Sherlock because he was never exposed to the time vortex, but because John is in The Doctor’s personal timeline, it is possible for him to retain that memory (Amy remembered two versions of The Doctor’s death in Utah from ep. The Wedding of River Song).
John removed the note from the gift wrapper and placed it in the left inner pocket of his coat, close to his heart. Slowly, he unwrapped the gift and finds a mobile - similar to one he carried around that belonged to The Woman. He switched it on, found it locked with the same lock screen. He didn’t think twice before entering the password Irene Adler had.
“Which one-- ah. The one in this time.” The Doctor stood up, and paced steadily towards the TARDIS. As he was unlocking the door, he turned his head and look at Mycroft. “Come along now Holmes. Don’t want to waste this opportunity being the hero now?”
Sherlock leapt across the room, knocking over a tower of notes and saw the familiar blue police box standing proud, parked right in front of 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock led John through to the corridor, passing by the pool, libraries, and laboratories, detailing all his older adventures in the TARDIS to his husband but John couldn't pick up a word of it. Lastly they strode into John’s old room (the old Squash Court 7). Sherlock dropped their bags by the bed and held John in his arms. John was still in a daze, still wondering if he was dreaming. But he quickly realised that this is too advanced for his imagination and snapped out of his own head. He found himself held tight in Sherlock’s arms, face stuffed in his husband’s shoulder.
“Enough to pull me out of that hell hole. Enough about me. You mentioned you moved back. Didn’t know you moved out.”
While his husband moved off his lap, a loud rap on the door broke Sherlock's focus on John's arse moving towards the bathroom.
“You are most welcome. I will see you again very soon, Holmes.” Sherlock gave The Doctor a gentle nod, and The Doctor swiftly left Bart’s and back into the TARDIS. Upon stepping in, he found future-Sherlock sitting next to the blue buttons of the TARDIS, deep in his mind palace.
“Oh, this! Holmeses, we are going to save Sherlock Holmes. Hang tight!” The Doctor pulled a lever, and jerked three of them around the console room for a minute before it landed hard.
"Need your help, Doctor." Sherlock was suppressing his emotions. He could feel a deep well in his stomach throwing waves within.
"Oh, bad time. Which time are you referring to? I was quite sure I've set the time in this universe straight. How badly was it behaving? Was I interrupting something? Am I an interruption? Interruption, funny word isn't it? But I like how it rolls off my tongue -
“Basil.” He replied. John wasn’t convinced, but accepted it by reaching his hand out for a handshake.
“Schroedinger's cat. Exactly. He was quite a pleasant man. Great cook too. Not a patch on Liz10, though, the things that woman could do with a potato...” he replied, trailing off as he realised he’d digressed.
Two weeks later, John found himself cleaning 221B, with his luggage once again at the front door. He was moving back in. Mrs Hudson was delighted, and The Doctor was still visiting for his weekly dose of custard and scones. John had to, and want to be there for Mrs H after Sherlock’s fall because she still believed Sherlock is gone forever. He was like a son she never had - a rude, demanding and wild-tempered son. To the world outside of 221B, John tried to leave his life with Sherlock behind, and failed miserably. Now that he is back in 221B, everyone - especially Greg, thought that his kind heart took over his own sorrow, putting Mrs Hudson above his own pain.
“It’s Holmes! It’s been awhile, my scrumptious little beauty!” The Doctor adjusted his bow tie while sliding off the table, opening his arms inviting Sherlock for a hug.
“I need to find Molly.” Sherlock stated, obviously with a plan in mind, and The Doctor did not say another word as he let Sherlock walk past him.
Sherlock continued to muse out loud, following John, until John stopped and turned, opening his mouth, pausing then closing it again. Sherlock had stopped, his voice trailing off, too, as he waited for John to speak. “Sherlock, about last night…”
The Sherlock hiding behind the hedge held his breath, willing John not to mention their conversation to this younger version, who would have no idea what he was talking about.
“Sherlock, you’re not supposed to be here. I told you no! Greg wouldn’t be too happy if he knew you came back.” Molly took a quick glance up from her clipboard and realized Sherlock was not alone… and he was
'The Butt Pinch' was by far the most consistent. John tried it in 27 different occasions and was caught twice. The first time was when they were in Dartmoor, after he had spent the evening looking for the source of a Morse code (which turned out to be teenagers shagging at the back of their car). Sherlock was in their room, so deep in his mind palace, didn't even notice John came back, showered and slept naked right next to him. Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed, back facing John who was lying on his side trying to sleep.
“So what’s your plan, Sherlock?” The Doctor asked. He’d taken a bigger role than he’d realised in their previous stop; John would recognise him now, though, so perhaps Sherlock would prefer him to remain unseen this time.
John caught me staring without looking up. His observational skills has improved so much over the years, especially after our wedding. I should pretend to be in my mind palace. Love it when he does things to me thinking I wasn't aware.
“Am I dreaming?” John squints and looked at Sherlock by the window. Sherlock stepped towards The Doctor while future-Sherlock hid between The Doctor and the TARDIS.
“Who is- what is that?” John was wrapped in a towel from waist down, drops of water trickled down his neck onto his shoulders and he stood very still by the kitchen.
“Mmmm…” Sherlock knew they weren’t going anywhere near John again. No point asking where they are going.
before John walks into the lab. He then looked to his right and realize The Doctor was already walking towards Bart’s. Sherlock followed, lengthening his stride with each step, trying to catch up to The Doctor.
“I’ll tell you tonight, and I don’t mind if you still want to sleep in my room. It must hurt climbing those stairs, which was why you slept in my room when you moved back here."
"The name is Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street." He winked, turned around and left.
“Hello John.” Sherlock quietly whispered. John shifted slightly again, closed his eyes tightly a few times without opening them and frowned before he lifted one sleepy eyelid.
“The last time I did this, I had to blow up the entire universe with myself in it! I really don’t want to go through that experience again. It was…” The Doctor shivered. “We are already interfering with the Web of Time, and it could destabilise or destroy the entire space-time continuum.”
Sherlock stood up from the sofa, straightening out his shirt while waiting for John to reach the top of the stairs.
John went in for a kiss. Sherlock felt his lips curved upwards. It was a gentle peck on the lips, but it conveyed John’s joy, relieve, pain, frustration and love for him. They sat on the sofa with arms around each other for another minute before John broke the silence.
John was perplexed. Unconsciously he sat up and posed like how Sherlock would when he is in his mind palace.
As Sherlock made to walk past The Doctor and out into London, The Doctor put one hand on his arm. “You do have a plan?”
“Personal boundaries, Sherlock. You will need to get a hang of it. No one likes it when you hang out their dirty laundry…”
John had put on his pants, trousers and an old army t-shirt before walking to the living room. He saw Sherlock, and
“John will walk out of there this evening at around 10.15pm. If I can talk to him, give him some insight into me that he doesn’t have yet,” Sherlock shrugged. “I don’t expect he would jump on me right away, but it may help him to see me in a different light.” He looked at his watch. “A few hours still to go. Probably best I stay out of sight.” Breathing in the clean air once more, he returned to the TARDIS to wait for his moment.
“Congratulations! Is this the wedding invitation? I am so happy for you! Are you going to wear a bow tie? Bow ties are cool. You will look great in it. Have you got a pictur-” The Doctor stopped rambling when he noticed Sherlock’s shoulders heaving, and a sob sent shivers down his back, echoing in the quiet night of 221B Baker Street.
The Doctor pranced towards and leaned against the TARDIS. Sherlock stood up, wanted to go after his other self when The Doctor shook his head. John raised both his eyebrows when he heard Sherlock breathed harder. He held his arms tight around Sherlock as he slumped down into John’s lap, burying his face into John’s shoulder.
TL;DR - Leave a comment if you are interested to know. Otherwise, just accept that there are so many unknown time travel laws, no one really knows how it all works, even The Doctor!
“Dartmoor, 10th March, 2011.” The Doctor confirmed, stepping out into the mild day. He raised his eyebrows at Sherlock, who nodded, following him out and looking around. They had landed at the back of the pub where he and John had stayed while investigating the Hounds of Baskerville. It was mid-afternoon, the day overcast but not rainy.
Sherlock slouched into his chair while pulling John onto his lap. They spent the next 10 minutes snogging the daylight out of each other (or what was left of it) before a loud wheezing noise broke them apart.
“John, thank you,” was all Sherlock could manage without breaking down. He stayed composed as he took big steps towards the bathroom and locked himself in it, sliding down, hugging his knees with his back against the door.
“John! John! You are amazing! You are fantastic!” Sherlock’s voice was muted as he turned the corner, chasing John out of the graveyard.
“As if I knew? Of course I knew, Sherlock. Why else would I move back here? I came back because you told me you-- you loved me. On Christmas Day. Remember?” Sherlock shot John a confused look.
“This was most certainly about that week in Baskerville. Never really figured out what that meant. John was quite sure it was someone flashing a morse code from the other side of the hill.”
John, who had walked outside with a decidedly military air, stopped dead, waiting. Louise had just walked off on him when she realised he was investigating Henry Knight, Sherlock remembered.
Sherlock’s mouth tilted up in a lopsided grin. “The game is on!” The Doctor grinned in reply and the two men strode out into the city.
You are angry. You should be angry. I had to protect you John. I had to protect us. This was my only option. I wanted to avoid dying if at all possible. I am sorry, please forgive me. SH
me. I love you, and I always will.” He straightened himself and went next to Sherlock who was still sitting on his chair, he reached out his hand hovering across Sherlock’s face.
“The problem with sensory input is that is can be so often subjective.” Sherlock explained carefully. “This afternoon in Dewar’s Hollow is one example, but there are more mundane examples that baffle me still. What may seem noteworthy to one person is not to another. Without enough data for comparison, it can be difficult to know what is statistically significant and what is not. I have a tendency to become…frustrated when I have to deal with unfamiliar types of data.”
Sherlock sighed. “I don’t want to avoid the fight all together – it needed to happen, I think, and it lead to a breakthrough in the case. Plus, I don’t want to change anything I don’t have to.” The Doctor gave what he interpreted as an approving nod.
“I am giving you my days. Be well, both of you.” Future-Sherlock dropped his hand without touching Sherlock and walked back into the TARDIS with tears rolling down his face.
“Doctor, he is the most important person I’ve known in my life, and I am about to lose him. He is the one person I want to cherish, hold close and love. I’m willing to take the risk, Doctor. I will accept the consequences to my actions.” Sherlock was determined to win the war. He will not let anything or anyone take John away from his life, not even for one second. John is his, and his to love for the rest of his life.
“This should do the trick.” He shot a look at The Doctor to be quiet then tilted his head towards Molly. “Please take a look at this and give it to me when I come back next time. Thank you Molly. Doctor, it's time.” Sherlock walked towards the door and left Molly behind holding a strand of curly dark hair, confused. The Doctor bowed gently and left with Sherlock.
He held John’s arms with both hands and pulled himself into a hug with John. That was all he will ever get, after all he has been through for himself.
“So?” The Doctor asked, peering over the top of his glasses, looking amused and curious at the breathless Sherlock that had just burst in.
Back in the TARDIS, future-Sherlock and The Doctor were planning their next stop. Sherlock pointed out that the puzzle would be easier to solve without the fall.
“They won’t sting unless you plan to take one of them back for an experiment. Just walk freely, imagine you are one of them,” The Doctor said when he noticed John had a worried look on his face, “Some of them are bigger than you are, and no one ever visits, so they can’t really tell the difference.” That statement made John shudder.
John spent a good half an hour sitting in graveyard, flipping through his notebook while Sherlock watched, waiting for his earlier self to appear. John looked like sleep had eluded him, Sherlock thought. He kept flicking between two or three pages; Sherlock itched to know what was written there that held his attention for so long. In the end he was so busy wondering that he almost missed his own entrance. It was only when John snapped the booklet shut and stood up that he noticed himself striding up the path.
"Hello Doctor." Sherlock greeted The Doctor, trying to hide his shaking voice by forcing a smile on his face.
“Oh. Attitude. Attitude is good. I like an attitude. Where did you get that from? Why are you--” Before The Doctor could say more, Sherlock walked up to The Doctor, their face so close they could feel each other’s breath on the tip of their noses. “Bored.” Sherlock backed away and spun dramatically, facing away from The Doctor.
Thinking about drinking made Sherlock wonder…inspired, he took out his phone, checking the time. John had seen him drinking at the fireside; it was entirely plausible that he’d gone on drinking. Sherlock knew that his original self had, in fact, gone upstairs and stared at the ceiling for most of the night, trying to convince himself that there was a rational explanation for what he had seen. John would not know that; Sherlock had lain still the whole night, making no sound.
The whole month after the wedding was gloomy, as if the criminal network in London was out to stop them from consummating their marriage. Lestrade and Mycroft had a case for them every other day, all at least a 6. Two weeks into the month, Sherlock had put down his feet and declared that he will not accept anything but a 9 or 10, that was it - until John forced them to take on a human trafficking ring, with an orphanage as a front. That case took them one week to solve, and while they were nearing the end, Mycroft came with a 10.
“That was me frightened, John.” Sherlock admitted quietly. It was still a difficult admission, even after all this time. His honesty startled John, whose posture stiffened in the dim outside light.
This will be John’s first time on the TARDIS. He held Sherlock’s hand tightly as he stepped in the door. His eyes were wide open, mouth gaped in wonder. Sherlock gently tugged his husband into the centre of the control room while The Doctor prepared for their trip.
“Good luck,” he said, opening the door to reveal the sitting room of 221b Baker Street. “Ah. A little closer than I expected. Hope I didn’t knock over the telly again.” He turned to face Sherlock, adding, “Whatever happens, you can still change the future. Never, never ever give up.”
“Doctor? Oh Doctor. It is you! Oh this is lovely. This is really lovely! And here I thought it was going to be a boring day!” A large grin was on his face as he threw himself into The Doctor’s open arms.
“There must be something… UGH!” Sherlock was overwhelmed with frustration while plotting his next move with The Doctor. Both their hair looked like there was a hurricane in the TARDIS, throwing their curls in all directions. So far, every single idea from Sherlock has been shot down by The Doctor.
“Sherlock. Are you alright?” Sherlock was still in a daze after what happened. He nodded gently and held John tighter.
Sherlock gave the Doctor a dramatic eye roll accompanied with a loud sigh in which The Doctor responded with a wide grin. Sherlock can only groan and let The Doctor in. His erection was making him an insufferable prick, even by The Doctor's standards. Reluctantly he showed The Doctor into the flat and sat on his chair while The Doctor sat on his table, swinging his legs back and forth. There was a time when Sherlock would be excited to see him, but not today, not when he was about to make love to his doctor after one whole month of abstinence.
“Come on. Unpack your bag and take a shower. You smell a little funky. I’ll cook dinner and you can tell me what happened over it.” Sherlock nodded and lifted them both off the sofa, grabbed his bag and walked towards his room.
“Yes yes yes. Still the same mad man with a box. A different box though. Actually the same box, but different. Ah come on, much to tell you, but not now. Let’s keep it for another time. Won’t be long now.”
The Doctor took the photo. John and Sherlock in front of a field of flowers, bees buzzing busily above and behind them. Above them the skies were blue with a spot of cloud. John looked over at Sherlock smiling down looking at the photo. How can the world not see this? At that moment, John decided to write about their honeymoon on his blog, along with the photo. It’s about time the world realise what an amazing man Sherlock is.
The Doctor turned the flickering screen around towards Sherlock and showed him the letters floating on the screen.
"John… I-- I’m home.” Sherlock appeared calm and collected, but inside he was trembling with joy, in the arms of someone he loves.
He's staring at my hands. Must be the fiddling. It annoys him to no ends, but I can't help it. Touching the ring reminds me that Sherlock is mine, and I belong with him.
The Doctor tended to Sherlock’s wounds, Mycroft sat in a chair at the corner while future-Sherlock watched from the door before The Doctor pulled him into another room.
"Nothing much, social calls. I like to see my friends once in awhile," The Doctor got a glare from Sherlock. Ignoring Sherlock, he twirled around, scanning the flat with the sonic screwdriver, "Just visiting. Not staying though, no. Definitely. Not. Staying."
“Did you delete it already?” Molly drew a long sigh, pursed her lips and explained how Sherlock was being a jerk and Greg had enough of Sherlock getting his name wrong. Apparently Greg’s wife was cheating on him with a man named Graham, and Sherlock tipped him over the edge this time. Though she was answering Sherlock, Molly’s attention was fixed on The Doctor.
Short chapter update! Aren't we all glad Sherlock is home? Next chapter will be sex, sex and more sex. Absolutely fantastic sex. If you are not interested in gay sex, please skip the next chapter. Story will resume in chapter 7.
During the cases following that, John had always found the opportunity to do the pinch, as if Sherlock had given him access on purpose. In hindsight, he might have done it, exposing his fine arse, but for a different reason - to seduce John.
This chapter continues from Chapter 4 - in the TARDIS, after Sherlock was rescued from Serbia and sent back to London.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock blurted out without sounding like a deer caught in the headlights. He was excited, surprised, nervous and all of the above. Sherlock’s speech centre was now on auto pilot. Still trying to digest the current situation, he stored the conversation in his mind palace for further analysis later.
“I called four months ago. Now that you are here, I know you have been acquainted with my brother. Any idea where he is?”
“Well, I’m not alone. Someone you need to meet. Someone you both need to meet.” The Doctor knocked the door and future-Sherlock opened the door.
"It doesn't work that way Sherlock. Remember what I told you? We are observers only. That’s the one rule I’ve always stuck to in all my travels, and anyone with me follows." The Doctor looks at Sherlock sternly.
“There can only be one of us. That me shouldn’t exist because he changed my past, our past, John. His entire reality cease to exist.” Sherlock explained. He exchanged a look with John - his eyes filled with sorrow, as if he had to leave John behind forever. In fact, he was. He could feel the pain in the other Sherlock's eyes, who went through hell, and about to be removed from existence altogether.
Took him longer than he wanted, but 4 seconds was still commendable given that it was 9 years ago and 23 time-traveling days that didn't belong anywhere. He opened the door in full swing and found himself standing in the library of the TARDIS. Hurriedly he walked past shelves, touching every book he saw. Upon finding a phone number, he left his mind palace, held up his mobile and dialed the number. Sherlock found himself on his feet, pacing the living room, avoiding piles of paper and case files as he maneuvered back and forth...
“Any one of you want to fill me in? Sherlock?” John looked back and forth between both Sherlocks and The Doctor.
“Sherlock, are you listening? Look at him John, is he always this occupied? It’s fascinating! Does he always stare at you like that, John?” Mary’s eyes had lit up in excitement, glancing back and forth between John and Sherlock.
"This is brilliant! How are you both still thinking alike? I would love to tell you why I'm here, John, but it is not my story to tell." The Doctor grinned as he looked at John intently.

“One of you is enough to manage, but two? You were both right that The Doctor brought me my worse nightmare.” John rolled his eyes at Sherlock.
Future-Sherlock stood up from the sofa, and walked towards John and Sherlock. His heart was beating hard against his chest, nervous and not knowing what could turn out from what he was about to do. Removed from existence -
wedding too? Or will he have sacrificed himself for himself in the other parallel universe and continue to suffer in heartache here?
“Do not go any closer, Sherlock. You will not interact with him, see him or let him see you. You and him, you are not the same person. You do not exist in this new causal chain. Mary and John’s wedding did not happen in this present reality. Your knowledge of the other reality is fragmenting the Web of Time. I have told you on the very first day that this is a huge risk, not only to you, but to the entire universe. I have a plan, but you need to stay out of sight until I come for you. Nod if you understand me.” Sherlock stared blankly between The Doctor’s eyes and nodded. He walked back into his room, studying The Doctor’s words and the gravity of this situation.
9 years ago, The Doctor never gave him the name he so desperately wanted, but Sherlock knew with his next words, that this man standing a few steps away from him was the one he was searching for. The Doctor is now a witness to John Watson and Sherlock Holmes’ first meeting.
“Ah! Sherlock. Eccentric fella!” Mike looked over at John. “Sherlock is a consultant for New Scotland Yard. He comes to my lab sometimes to run some experiments. Weird guy, but I’ve known him long enough to know he means no harm.”
“Sherlock... come here.” John leaned towards Sherlock, reaching his left arm towards Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Where are we going, Doctor?” Sherlock asked as he followed John into their bedroom. John had already took out a duffle bag, stuffing both their clothes into it while humming the wedding song.
(whitehart) I lied! It's not over! The story can be read up till Chapter 7 as a complete story. Chapter 8 onwards are bits and pieces after the wedding, honeymoon and maybe kids? Eventually John finds out about the origin of the skull on the mantelpiece.
I sat next to the fireplace in 221B, with John right across me, reading a medical journal while fiddling with his wedding band. He does that all the time, especially when he's entertained by whatever he's doing.
The Doctor and Sherlock spent 12 hours wandering around the TARDIS. The Doctor excitedly showed Sherlock around the new library, a seventh squash court, a few additional swimming pools and the pride of The Doctor, a brand new theatre - The Doctor once watched David Attenborough’s Planet Earth on BBC One with Amy, Craig and Sophie while taking a break from time travelling, then found himself building a theatre the next day in the TARDIS.
“Sherlock? SHERLOCK!” John’s eyes shot open, pushing Sherlock and himself up from their horizontal position and yelled Sherlock’s name repeatedly. Still holding onto Sherlock’s body, John pulled Sherlock into a hug, burying his face in Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock could feel his tears, warm breath and light sobs against his skin, held his arms and wrapped it around John’s shoulders.
John lifted his head a few moments later. He stared intently into Sherlock’s eyes and bit his lower lip, holding back another sob.
“It may have changed, or it may not have at all. You won’t know until you go out there.” He said quietly, settling one hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock was sent back to Mycroft’s office after a quick trip to the future. The Doctor waddled back into the TARDIS and headed towards the old Premium Squash Court VII. He gave the door a gentle knock, and a grunt came from inside.
. They are a sapient insectoid species, spent some time on Earth but they went home couple centuries ago. Oh! Before that, we need to make a stop at Darillium and make a dinner reservation.”
John couldn’t keep his eyes off Sherlock. He was like a five-year-old child opening Christmas presents in the middle of July. Sherlock spent a few hours looking at different species of bees, observing and making mental notes of their flight patterns, physical appearances and how different they are behaving in the wild. The Doctor caught up to them with mugs in one hand and a Thermos flask in the other.
“I’ve heard there’s some analogy about a Band-Aid,” The Doctor offered, pronouncing the word carefully as though it was foreign. “Something about ripping it off to lessen the pain.” Sherlock nodded absently, still staring at the door. The Doctor started walking slowly, hand still on Sherlock’s shoulder, guiding him forward.
The TARDIS whooshed out of the living room, sending pieces of paper flying all across creating a huge mess. Sherlock hears John stomping up the stairs, heavy, and mumbling to himself. Sherlock can only make out a few words like git, selfish, ran away, and disappeared, no idea, love…
are we?” Sherlock asked cautiously. The Doctor was doing something to the controls of the TARDIS, frowning at the flickering screen.
!" John said sarcastically while bringing tea out from the kitchen. Both The Doctor and Sherlock are idiots when it came to social interactions, and the sarcasm completely flew over their heads. They both took turns explaining to John how 'not nice' that was, having Daleks yelling about and exterminating their wedding cake in the process. Mrs Hudson was really upset that the cake was ruined, more than the fact that she was almost killed at the wedding. Only when John pointed out that The Doctor is an alien and he was at the wedding, they both stared at each other and started laughing heartily.
“You should meet Rory one day. I’m sure you both will have so much to talk about! He’s always waiting, and you are always sacrificing. Always! Why is that?” Sherlock shrugged The Doctor’s question and left the room. The Doctor leaped off the bed and followed suit.
#2: TARDIS adjusts all date and time of your devices (digital or analog) to the date & time of your location.
“I was supposed to be in there, whipping a corpse with Molly…” A train of thoughts hit Sherlock right in his face, shattering his body with pulses.
Gently, he opened the door to find himself spot on. John was on the sofa, sleeping, with both his legs dangling off the side, the window behind Sherlock’s chair slightly ajar, telly was on low volume airing a documentary from History channel.
John caught on immediately and his eyes twinkled. Since The Doctor told John about time travel, he never had the chance to go on the TARDIS. All he had were stories in Sherlock’s time travel diary. For many nights he had dreamt of going into space with Sherlock, drinking tea in a world with fishes swimming in the skies, sunbathing on a beach of rubies instead of sand, and having dinner with a view of seven moons. The Doctor’s last visit was cut short by Daleks invading the wedding, but he remembered The Doctor’s promise, giving them one trip to anywhere in space and time as their wedding gift. John was ready to claim that gift.
"Ugh, brilliant." John rolled his eyes dramatically and Sherlock frowned underneath him. "Sherlock. You get the door. I need to shower and deal with
Alone in his room, Sherlock tried to think, but the comfort of being in John’s bed fogged up his mind. In the past two days when they weren’t running down memory lane, Sherlock renovated The Doctor’s <Premium Squash Court VII> into John’s bedroom. Every wrinkle on his bed sheet, every creak on the floor, his scent in the pillows… everything that reminded him of John was in that room, built from his memory, in the TARDIS.
“Why? It’s just pins and needles. Blood circulation will get rid of it soon enough.” John wriggled his toes and smiled at Sherlock’s gesture.
“No, not that. Sorry I manipulated you into falling in love with me. That was a bit not good.” Sherlock’s eyes were looking down at John’s wriggling toes.
After finishing the whole flask of tea, the trio went back on board the TARDIS. Sherlock’s face was slightly sunburnt. The Doctor handed them some yellowish goo and told them it will get rid of the burn in a couple of minutes. Sherlock took the jar and walked off to apply it. John quickly got The Doctor to help him with the internet, and uploaded the first part of their honeymoon onto his blog.
This Sherlock only exists in the aborted timeline where John and Mary are engaged. However, due to Sherlock’s long exposure to time travel, most rules of time travel doesn’t apply to him any more, otherwise he would have ceased to exist when something changed in Dartmoor - especially if he had left the TARDIS, which was why The Doctor insisted that he stayed put inside. In the time when both Sherlocks were in the TARDIS, she was heaving though the time vortex. The existence of this Sherlock is causing a paradox, taking a toll on the TARDIS. There can only be one Sherlock Holmes in this timeline.
A few hours later, Mycroft was sent back to his time. The Doctor promised to nurse his dear brother back to health before sending him home. Sherlock was unconscious for another day before he came to.
how it went last time, Sherlock thought from behind the hedge, heart pounding again. Come on, they had to finish in the same place…
Sherlock stood at the front door of 221 Baker Street while the driver pulled out his bag from the back and placed it by his left feet. Without a single word, the driver went back to the government issued black sedan and pulled the car away into the busy street.
“Care to explain, Doctor?” Sherlock barely got those words out before he snuggled deeper in John’s arms.
Sherlock stood up from his chair, dropped the tuxedo on the floor and gave John a loving kiss on the lips. As he pulled John away from his face and into his chest, his left hand still locked with John’s right, Sherlock turned his head towards the mantelpiece, chin resting on John’s head. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief and under his breath, he whispered into John's hair.
“Are there apples in there? I hate apples. OH! Custard! You’re the best, Mrs Hudson.” John couldn’t keep his eyes off The Doctor’s child-like behaviour. On Sherlock’s good days, he would get excited, exactly like The Doctor now, when John brings home fish and chips, or pork dumplings from their favorite Chinese takeaway - especially after a good case where Sherlock lived off caffeine, some sugar and nicotine for days.
“The Spallation Neutron Source is old technology, Sherlock. Want me to show you something better?” That was The Doctor’s way of saying
“You're awake! You've been out cold for awhile. John... I can’t tell you. But I can show you once you feel better.”
“Oh John, look at this beauty. Oh this is beautiful. Those proboscis- oh! They look much better than under the microscope!”
#4: The TARDIS can't sustain having two of the same people from the same timestream. But because our Sherlocks are from two different timestream/reality, it was ok for them to be in the TARDIS, as long as they don't touch each other.
“I’m not the groom, or the ‘bride’, Doctor. I wish I am.” Sherlock turned around facing The Doctor, leaving the pot of liquid simmering over low heat on the stove. “I don’t even mind being the bride, in a dress, as long as John stays. Doctor, help me, please.” Tears were flowing steadily down Sherlock’s cheek as he plead. He never begs, but he will for John.
As much as Sherlock would like to spend some alone time with his husband, he couldn’t say no to a 10. The quicker he solves this, the sooner he can have John in bed. With that goal in mind, Sherlock solved the case in 129 hours, 2 boxes of Jaffa cakes, 421 cups of tea or coffee, and a total of 107 minutes in accidental power naps. John only recalled having ‘not enough’ of everything - not enough food, water and sleep; too much caffeine, sugar and yelling at each other. Sex was non-existent. At the end of day three, he blacked out thinking that both of them will die if Sherlock doesn’t crack the case now.
After the case ended, John held Sherlock by his wrist and dragged him back to their room. They were staying one more night before leaving back to London the next morning. John knew it was the doctor in him that wanted to help Sherlock out of his emotional insecurities, but at the same time his heart knew he’s doing this for his own benefit too.
“So, Mycroft pulled you out of Serbia? Really, just how powerful is your brother?” Sherlock couldn’t tell John about how The Doctor saved him without omitting what he saw in the cottage.
“Yes I always do. John is pleasant to look at.” Sherlock was feeling a little uncomfortable, getting caught staring at John. It wasn’t the first time, but John used to stare back until Sherlock comes out of his mind palace, and they would laugh at each other until it was time to have a cup of tea. “Sorry, I must go. Excuse me.” Gently he pushed his chair back and stood up, taking a few steps away from the table. Without turning back, he said goodbye to John and promised he will clean up before John’s arrival tonight.
.” The Doctor spoke quietly, lowering his head in defeat. He wanted to save Sherlock, both Sherlocks, but he knew from the very beginning it was never possible. Sherlock took the chance and the risk, now he will face the consequences.
-moon you will not forget.” The Doctor dragged out the word ‘honey’ as if to hint Sherlock where they were heading to.
We are on our honeymoon!!! First stop - Melissa Majoris, courtesy of a great friend of ours, The Doctor! Bees bigger than us! Sherlock was excited, I was a little afraid for our lives, but all is well! We are moving on to another place soon. Just taking a break while Sherlock applies some goo for his sunburnt face. Lots of love from planet of the bees!
It has been 5 years 7 months since they first met at Bart's, 3 and a half years since their Christmas 'love confession' text (technically it was the other Sherlock, but it didn't mattered to John), 8 months since Sherlock came back from Serbia, 7 since he proposed (it was not romantic at all) and a little over a month since their wedding. John knows every trick up Sherlock's sleeve when it comes to their relationship.
Hello everyone! Here's a timeline map I've used to reference in writing this story. The notes in the timeline map is slightly different from the final story (the timey-wimey stuff's fault), but it doesn't steer far away from the final story.
I was inspired to write smut tonight. So the time travelling has been postponed to the next chapter.
“I am not accustomed to any level of intimacy with another person. Knowing what is and what is not within the normal parameters stretches my experience, John. I know what I feel, but I have no basis for comparison. I can only…try.”
Without saying another word, John left Mrs Hudson’s apartment and raced up to 221B. His mind was scrambled. So many questions, so many left unanswered. Walking into the living room of 221B and locking the door behind him, he sat down on Sherlock’s chair, gently running his fingertips over the note. After spending a few years with Sherlock, he has picked up a few things in the Science of Deduction. The note was definitely written recently, and he knows Sherlock’s handwriting better than his own. He is definitely alive. ‘
Sherlock cracked it just in the nick of time. As Mycroft took over the rest of the operation, Sherlock collapsed next to John on the sofa and they slept through the next 14 hours. They woke up in each other’s arms, aroused, but still too sluggish to do anything. John’s stomach growled and Sherlock’s followed shortly after. After staring at each other for a short while, they both got into the shower. John couldn’t wait any longer. Facing Sherlock, he wrapped his hands around both their lengths rubbing against each other. Hurriedly he tugged both of them into a long awaited orgasm. Sherlock’s knees gave in right when he came and John couldn’t see straight. They both agreed that they are too weak and tired at that moment, and should do more after dinner. After a quick shower, John ordered Chinese take away while Sherlock started the fire in the fireplace. Dinner arrived in 20 minutes. Sherlock and John couldn’t be bothered with niceties and ate out of the boxes with chopsticks and hands. They settled in their own chairs with a cup of tea, John with a medical journal and Sherlock re-cataloguing the case in his mind palace.
Mycroft knew who was involved. He had seen the string of numbers in some archived documents written by Margaret Thatcher, Sir Winston Churchill and some from The Queen herself. There is only one constant amongst the changes happening in the universe - The Doctor.
"Of course I will, Sherlock. I’ll probably skip the boring bits but I will definitely come for the dancing. Dancing is great. Oh look. Gotta run. Clara’s still waiting for me in the Dalek’s spaceship. See you both soon!” The Doctor hopped into the TARDIS without looking back, closed the door and the TARDIS whooshed out of John and Sherlock’s living room.
Sherlock looked confused, but he continued on his own train of thought, “So nothing on the Morse code…how about Louise Mortimer?”
Sherlock tuned into the conversation between Mary and John across the table just in time to hear that last sentence coming out of John towards Mary.
“I found him, Doctor. And he is getting married tomorrow.” Sherlock is now over the stove with a pot of yellow-ish liquid on the heat, with his back facing The Doctor.
With Sherlock’s permission, Doctor Watson set to work on a regimen for Sherlock, and his own way into Sherlock’s heart.
Quietly, Sherlock walked down the stairs and opened the door with The Doctor standing right in front of him. So many good memories of great adventures flowed through Sherlock’s mind in that instance.
“Yeah, I really thought you were dead. My limp came back and I needed to get away from everything that reminded me of you. Until Christmas. Glad I’m here, and you too Sherlock.”
Hours later, Sherlock waited for John in the cold night air. He remembered seeing John pass the stairs that night; he’d hidden inside the pub, eavesdropping on John’s conversation with Louise Mortimer before retiring. Now, he sat on one of the picnic tables outside the pub, waiting on John. He found that his heart was thumping a little; this was his chance to explain to John why he behaved as he did; to elicit a more sympathetic perspective from here on.
“Mr. Holmes, what do you want now?” Lestrade spat over the phone. He is obviously still pissed with Sherlock.
The Doctor took a deep breath before he continued, “there are fixed points through time where things must always stay the way they are. Your little stunt few years ago was one of them. However, with what happened after, there were opportunities for you to change future events, creating your own timeline, your own reality. You’ve seen how it turned out now, but we will never know what could be different if you made a different choice. We will never find out until it happens, and it may not be what you hoped for. Are you sure you want to do this?”
Trying not to laugh, The Doctor grinned awkwardly. "Sherlock, you will always be a child to me. I’m 900… and some years!” The Doctor paused for a moment, and an imaginary light bulb lights up above his head. “Oh, you knew I would say that. You ARE clever!” Sherlock now has a weak smile on his face, knowing that he has won the first battle in his war with time.
“Molly Hooper, I assume, I’ve heard, well, nothing ‘bout you really, but I’m sure you’re excellent.” The Doctor was all charm, sweeping a low bow as he spoke. Molly looked flattered and confused at the same time, eyes darting from The Doctor to Sherlock and back. “You’re in different clothes, Sherlock.” She examined him more closely, her eyes going wide then narrowing in confusion. “Your hair is different, and...have you done something to your eyes?” Sherlock waved one hand impatiently at her questioning, but she continued to stutter along until he raised his voice a little, riding over her protestations.
He stood absolutely still in front of the door, haven’t moved a fraction of an inch since he was dropped off 12 minutes ago.
He loves it when I use terms of endearment. Oh, look. He's going to pretend he's in his mind palace. I should fuck with him a little. He thinks he's the only one who knows how to run experiments and observe. What an idiot!
He waved his hands around his head, attempting to swat away his thoughts. Although he had been in compromising situations over the last 2 years, he always found time to revise John’s EQ regimen.
“Serbia. Interesting.” The Doctor jerked when he heard a loud thud on the door. He opened a small crack and peeked outside. A familiar head was against it and flopped to the side. It was Sherlock, unconscious. Mycroft saw his brother outside and dragged him into the TARDIS. The Doctor scanned Sherlock with the sonic screwdriver and returned to the screen in the middle of the console.
It was nice, sitting in 221B with the man he loves and the man who loves them both, sipping tea and talking about the wedding.
Both Sherlocks stared at each other and told the other to shut up. John trailed his fingers across the back of his head, up and over to his forehead and gave it a tight squeeze. He was already getting a headache in the presence of two high functioning sociopaths.
Sherlock blinked at him. “Something happened to me; something I’ve not really experienced before…” he trailed off, and John did not interrupt, as Sherlock remembered he had last time-- this time. “But it was more than that. It was doubt. I felt doubt. I’ve always been able to trust my senses, the evidence of my own eyes, until last night.”
Sherlock puts down his bag by the opened door and knelt next to the sofa. John was still dreaming. His eyelids flickered while mumbling something incomprehensible. Sherlock carried his left leg and straightened it on the sofa, and did the same with John’s right. John shifted when his right leg touched the sofa, and he whispered Sherlock’s name.
Sherlock let out a deep sigh, lifted his head and forced a smile towards The Doctor. His tears are now heavy, falling off his chin in heavy droplets, and his voice cracked. “Unless there’s children crying?”
“What is that noise Sherlock? Don’t make me order the velvet cake instead of chocolate!” John yelled from the bath. The Doctor jumped when he turned around and saw Sherlock standing by the window, eyes wide open, staring at The Doctor and the TARDIS.
John, Molly and Greg were at Mrs Hudson’s on Christmas Day. It was noon when John arrived. Between Sherlock’s fall and John moving out, Molly and Greg had spend most weekends with Mrs Hudson, keeping her company while she grieves. The Doctor had also visited a few times after the fall, simply because she bakes brilliant scones and her custard recipe is to die for. He even prefers Mrs Hudson’s scones over fish fingers nowadays.
As the evening went by, John excused himself to bed while Sherlock was in his mind palace thinking about the case. When he realized John had gone to sleep, his eyes started wandering around the once again empty room. He found his gaze lingered on John’s tux hanging on the side of the mantelpiece, and within his peripheral vision, his old friend before John, before the flesh-and-blood John Watson. His gaze fixed on the skull while his inner thoughts repeatedly reminded him of John’s affection towards Mary, not him. He started considering  the possibility of creating his own John. After all, an abundance of John’s DNA was sitting on top of the fireplace.
“Well here we are, home sweet home!” The Doctor cried as the TARDIS wheezed to a stop. He looked over at Sherlock, doing a double take to see the frozen expression on his face.
The Sherlock behind the hedge was also dazed, though part of his brain registered that he and John were now talking again about HOUND being an acronym.
The Doctor led him up to the cottage window, half covered by a curtain. Sherlock looked in and saw two old man sitting next to each other, arms around each other and the blond man's head on the other's shoulder in front of a telly. They were watching a documentary about the extinction of Bornean Orangutan.
“Here you go! Merry Christmas John!” The Doctor held out the gift with a small card stuck next to a neatly tied ribbon. John took the gift in his hand and pondered. He didn’t know The Doctor would be there, and apologised for not having a gift for him.
“What did you say Doctor? Say that again!” Sherlock quickly got up on both his feet and paced towards The Doctor.
John moans whorishly and writhes between them. "Please!" He opens his eyes and searches the room for Sherlock, his expression pleading with him. He needs more.
‘Please let me try. Oh god please.’ She begs, cunt dripping onto the floor. “Fuck she’s like a bitch in heat.” Darius growls.
“Are you sure that’s not because I’m your soulmate or whatever?” John asks. “Are you getting enough from it though? Nutrients or whatever you need?” He asks.
"Last I heard, he was in a men's shelter down by the docks." Jane said. "I'd rather not see him again. He's not a good person. If he has won your competition, he'll probably sell it off for a bottle of cheap scotch. Good day." The phone disconnected.
“So do you. Your cock makes my cunt tingle. Makes me want to spread my legs wider for you.” She arches back, letting him rub against her cervix.
Sabine sits down in the chair indicated by the waiter. She murmured thanks as he handed her the wine list, but she put it down almost immediately and asked for a tall glass of water.
John swallows the words with his mouth, pulling Sherlock by the back of his neck into an even more passionate kiss.
“If you drop me my soul will move on to the next seer. You can’t kill me.” Pythia sighs. “I am Pythia. I am a seer. A helper. I move things along so the world can progress. Dunno when it started or how. Just doing my thing. I know you’re his Sire. I can see your energy in him. I knew he was coming for the ring because it’s energy ignited. Objects and people have energy. I can see it as well as events. Past, present, and future. Next question.”
“I don’t… I don’t know. There are things that just seem wrong. This bedroom seems… and the sitting room… just… the mantlepiece… I can’t… put my finger on what it is… oh and my fingers… They feel strange. Everything feels just a bit off… but then it’s fine for a while… and then I see something else and I feel like… ”  he let out a huff of air. “It’s silly. I’m just tired. Ignore me,” he said, dismissing it all. “Maybe I should lie down and rest.”
He kisses his hand careful so he doesn't wake Sherlock. He sits quietly in the chair and holds Sherlock's hand. He smiles softly.
“Hi, Daddy.” Sky smiles softly and blushes, crawling into bed behind Mycroft. She curls up behind him and relaxes, her full rounded belly weighing her down nicely.
“You just like the idea of filling me back up again.” She giggles and holds her belly as she stands.
"I've spent years trying to convince her to go to rehab. Clara spent years trying Harry to go to rehab. Clara left Harry because she couldn't take it anymore. But you.. Wonderful amazing gorgeous you offer to help her once and she takes it. I'm sorry she's an ass. I'm sorry that she did this to our Sherlock. But thank you for trying to help her.." John signs.
Sky hums softly as she relaxes, still trying to move her arm that the shoulder was shot. She can't feel anything, only being able to lift it using telekinesis. She sighs and rubs her face with her good hand.
“A spectacular performance for a virgin if I do say so myself. And I do.” She smiles and kisses him. “Mm I can feel your cum working its way to my eggs right now.” She purrs and writhes a bit, loving the feeling.
John presses his forehead to Sherlock's back and wraps his arms around his middle, waiting for the water to boil. "It's no excuse to be distant from my husband. I'm sorry, love. I'll do better."
“I never married. I was...” he chuckles softly. “I was in the army. Mycroft was a field medic. I was a... corporal.” He says thinking of his title.
Greg whimpers and swallows around him. He presses his face into Sherlock's side and kisses his hip and he pants.
"Yeah? I'm sure you did brilliantly. Did you have fun?" She smiles softly as Jake picks something for him to wear.
“John and Sherlock are stable. Mycroft is in surgery.” Sky frowns. Greg what out of the shower and wipes the soap off with a towel, going to get dressed.
His hips jerk and he lets out a quiet groan. He coughs to cover it up. "My apologies, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm afraid I'm a bit under the weather at the moment."
"We're...working on it." John admits, "it hasn't been easy on Rosie but we're trying to fix things."
"Я хочу видеть тебя сегодня вечером. Пожалуйста." Ivan begs and bites his lip, 'I want to see you tonight. Please'. Sky hums softy liking the begging. "Может быть." She smiles flirtatiously and licks her lips, 'Maybe'. He whimpers softly and nods. He bows to her and leaves the house.
"You okay?" John asks, reaching a hand out for Sherlock, but leaving it hanging in the air between them.
He blushes and leans in to kiss him. "Mm, we can have some fun while she's busy with the others, too."
John smirks and eases another finger into Greg. “Should I stretch you more and fuck you with Sherlock?”
“I... I dunno. I guess more of a table or a bed so she’s centre of attention. And then just a selection of toys for others to choose from.” Sherlock shrugs.
Mycroft raises his eyebrows. “You feel in love with Lucifer?” He asks softly. “I... I’m sorry that you can’t see him again. Have you searched for a way to become human again?” He asks softly, resting his hand on Camille’s shoulder.
He finally moves his hands to her hips, grinding against her. He groans at the contact and moves to take his pants off.
"Wouldn't want the entire universe pointing their galactic doomsday devices for a piece of me eh?" The Doctor acknowledged John and Mike as he took his hair specimen sitting on the table.
They spent half the day in Melissa Majoria. Half the time they were there, Sherlock pranced around in fields of flower, excited to see the original habitat of Migrant Bees. Fields of flowers stretched towards the horizon, and the entire planet was covered in tall stalks of flowers, bees as big as their faces.
"Friend of mine. When I say 'friend'..." Sherlock found himself tongue-tied for the first time. As much as he would love to tell John about his skull from a thousand years in the future, he thought it might be best to keep it to himself for now.
“Uhm, Sherlock? I should tell you this before you walk into your room. I’ve been sleeping there ever since I moved back. Didn’t touch your things though. I’ll move my belongings back upstairs after dinner and you can have your room back. I’ll get you some clean sheets and--
John placed his cup down on the table and reached his hand across to Sherlock’s. As soon as he had a firm grip on Sherlock’s hand, he stood up, pulling Sherlock off his chair and marched into the bedroom, dragging Sherlock behind.
-- ah! Stupid, stupid Doctor!” He yelped as he tinkered with live wires below the console, almost getting shocked from matching the wrong ones together.
The Doctor cleared his throat at that comment and pointed to himself when his friends looked at him suspiciously.
“I’m not like other people, John.” The table Sherlock had picked was deep in shadow; he knew John would recognise his voice, and he did need to disguise his aged appearance somewhat.
“I wasn’t really listening earlier, what was it I did that prompted Graham to ask me to leave?” He looked around the lab as he spoke, apparently distracted but really hiding the desperation he’s feeling. He only had one shot to get this right.
From afghanistanorgallifrey (bigblueboxat221b): Let's be real, here: the credit for most of this belongs to whitehart - the first idea, ALL of the timey wimey stuff, most of the writing! She's just brought me along for the ride, Jack Harkness-on-the-outside-of-the-TARDIS-style! Twisting my brain around the rules/consequences of space/time travel has been exhausting! It's been exhilarating watching whitehart explain how events work with respect to the Doctor's personal timeline and Sherlock and John's memories and perspectives. Thank you all for reading our (her) effort. :)
Sherlock pecked on John’s forehead, loosened his arms around John, picked up his bag from the kitchen chair and went into his room - their room. 37 minutes later, Sherlock came out of the shower and wore his favourite jammies. John had lasagne in the oven and a kettle on for tea.
John packed three sets of clothes, their leather gloves and an extra pair of shoes for both himself and his husband. With everything packed neatly into two bags, they carried one bag each and dropped it next to the entrance of their living room. John held Sherlock’s hand and gave him a peck on the cheek before they trotted down excitedly into the street where the TARDIS was parked.
Wish I could tell you more, but the less you know, the safer you are. Please know and remember wherever I am, I will always come back to you. I will stay alive for you, John. You will always be my conductor of light, and I am now your Christmas miracle. Be well for me. SH
Sherlock held his lips tight on John’s, stopping John mid sentence. He opened his mouth gently, hoping John would reciprocate - and he did. The moment John’s lips came apart, Sherlock pushed his tongue over John’s lips, tasting the tea and biscuits he had earlier and peppermint toothpaste on his teeth. He had one hand held behind the small of John’s back and another on his head, fingers tangled between his hair, holding John’s face in his. They were both panting between the clash of teeth and tongue, until John pulled his face to the side and stared at Sherlock’s swollen lips. He ran his thumb over the lower and smiled.
Both times when John was caught, Sherlock never groaned and his body was stiff, except for the involuntary muscle flinching. The second time he even admitted that he was pretending so that he could ignore Lestrade.
Without saying another word, Sherlock nodded and went back into his mind palace. He has a decision to make...
Next morning Sherlock made sure to arrive at the cemetery before either John or himself; he had to be sure the conversation went more or less as it had last time. The two sets of memories from last night warred in his head, and it was distracting, but he forced himself to focus.
A/N: This is John and Sherlock's first night back together. John waited for a long time, not knowing if Sherlock will ever come home. Naturally, they have some issues to sort out, and both being alpha males (Captain John and Genius Sherlock) they are tugging and pulling at each other to figure out their dynamic in bed - at least that was how I imagined it.
Edit: I'm stuck. I think the adventures will take on another series. Had fun writing smut, hope you've enjoyed it!
“Well, that’s a very good question. We’re sometime around when you met John, but I can’t really be sure.” The Doctor replied. Seeing the look of alarm on Sherlock’s face, he added hastily, “Don’t worry, the old girl always takes me where I need to go!” Cautiously, The Doctor opened the door of the TARDIS and tasted the air experimentally.
"We did. But there is a price to pay, and I intend to." Future-Sherlock's words darkened the living room of 221B. Sherlock realised that his other self was about to do something drastic. He knows himself too well to think otherwise.
“I’ll introduce Sherlock to you. I think he’s still at Bart’s. You should come by and see some of our old friends, eh John? We all missed having you around!” Mike said, distracting John from thinking about The Doctor’s behavior.
Sherlock tuned out, once again retreating into his mind palace, leaving his lunch untouched on the table while Mary and John discussed the wedding and their future together. Sherlock started recalling the days he spent with John, remembering every detail in the lab where he first met John. He frowned when his recollection arrived on the day he jumped off the roof of St Bart’s. He came back to see John with a woman - this woman sitting across the table. She has John now, although Sherlock knows John loves his high-functioning sociopath best man just as much. Would everything be different if Sherlock didn’t have to leap off the roof? Could it have been him sitting next to John planning the wedding, a Watson-Holmes wedding?
Sherlock sat very very still, holding his position with his palms pressed against each other, fingertips pressing under his chin. His gaze was fixed on John's hands, and didn't shift them when John moved out of his chair.
“Sherlock! Why are yo- wha- I thought I saw you leav- Who-wha-WHAT is going on!?” John stuttered through his sentence and ended with a shout. Sherlock saw his face puffy, cheeks flushed, eyes swollen and his mouth slightly open, breathing hard. John’s fists were clenched tight. His knuckles were turning white.
From whitehart: This is it! It's the end! I might write an epilogue of the wedding, and another of the skull from 1000 years in the future.
"We'll get things sorted, it's just going to take a little bit longer." John says, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and leaning into him.
"Everyone here knows me as Harrison's Omega son. Aside from my aunt, not sure anyone knows or cares about the years I spent in the military. Hell, no one even knows I'm a bloody doctor."
He whimpers and nods. "Please.. Have them all fuck me and then plug me up.. Give Duncan a little surprise."
“I’ll order some takeaway for us non blood eaters.” John chuckles softly. “That sounds good.” Diōnē smiles.
"Mm, before we start, I want to clarify that as long as they're okay with it, anyone can be fucked by anyone." He glances to Brian for a moment before addressing the rest of the group again. "Hopefully that will be taken advantage of."
"That came out wrong," John says when he notices Sherlocks dejected look. "It was just so much all at once. You basically tried to become a completely different person but it was never about changing 'you', it was about changing us. Fucking hell, could this be anymore difficult." He runs a hand over his face, all too aware they have an audience across from them examining everything. "I loved you for eight years. I've liked you even longer than that. So there must have been something that was solely you that I wanted, right? And then you went and changed everything about you and I'm still trying to catch up."
“I’ll continue calling you smart and amazing because that’s what you are.” Sherlock smiles. “And I plan on showing you. For days and days and days on end.”
"I-ah!" He moans loudly as Michael grips his arse. "U-used. I want to be used. Over and over and over." He whimpers blushing brightly.
He smirks and walks to him slowly. He trails his finger tip up his ankle, his calf, inner thigh, hip, and finally stops to press his palm against Mycroft's chest feeling his pounding heart under his hand.
“I don’t know.” Camille frowns. “Not just the world but the people. There’s so many people talking on those cube-things.” She says forgetting the name ‘mobile phone’. “And a lot have white things coming from their ears, what are those?” She asks, “do they have an illness?”
"Yours. All yours. Your slut. After you fuck and use me, you should make me stay naked and plugged with your cum. Make me walk around the estate like that. Show everyone who I belong to."
"Oh goodness no!" She laughs, rubbing the head of a toddler as he runs past. "I run a sort of daycare, for those poor Omegas who have to work."
Michael takes a shaky breath before breaking, the tears now running down his cheek. "Sky, you.. You can't do that.. I was so worried about you.."
She nods. "Sleeping with someone helps. I didn't used to care who I shared my bed with. Just somebody to fill the space. Something I could ground myself to so I could sleep. Now I have Michael and he is perfect. Just so perfect it makes my chest hurt." She shakes her head. "I don't know what I'd do if I lost him."
"Oh umm.. Well it looks like I don't have to pick anything up from my old flat anymore." She says hollowly as she looks at the pictures Mark sent her of all her destroyed belongings.
Greg blushes brightly and whimpers as he grinds against his lap. “I love being hard in Daddy’s lap. Makes me feel like such a dirty boy. I want Daddy all the time. When I haven’t had Daddys cock in a while I get desperate and my holes need to be filled.” He whimpers.
"Yeah. To tell you the truth I haven't been on a date in ages." She blushes. "So you'll have to bare with me." She smiles.
Sherlock nods and goes to the door, his hand resting on the handle and the other holding the pamphlets. “Thank you, John.” He says softly and then he’s gone. Against his better judgement he makes another appointment before leaving.
“If cooking is what gets you to stay then I may cook more than a few times a year.” Sherlock chuckles.
“Mm gonna torture me the whole meeting?” He smirks and bends over so Mycroft can push the plug into him.
Being sick the weekend got away from me and I forgot to send the chapter off to Jami (our wonder new beta, TY!!)
"Of course." Collin smiles at Greg before turning to Danny. "Hello little man. Did you have a good time with your uncle?" Collin asks and Danny. "Yes! Juice!" Danny giggles. "He likes you. If you'll excuse me I need to go find his juice." Collin chuckles and looks at Greg.
“Camille texted me.” Mycroft smiles. “I gave her a phone but never taught her how to use it. I didn’t get time.” He chuckles at how it’s set out, with his name along the top with a formal greeting, and Camille’s name under a formal sincerely. “Look.” He beams.
“The thing is I know none of my partners would hurt me. Never. And I just.. I want to be able to trust them. I want to be able to relax and enjoy it. I don’t want to have to be in control. But any other way is to uncomfortable and I can’t do it.” She sighs.
“Don’t be sorry. You were lovely. I’ll drag it out long next time if you want.” He smiles and stands.
"I'm sorry. I love you so much. I'm sorry." Mycroft whispers and holds him close. He kisses his head and rubs his back soothingly.
"Not if the laws change. If suddenly their way of life is illegal and enforced, they won't continue." John speaks up, "We get the Omegas on our side, offer them the same rights as everyone else. Offer them, us, a life with no more ownership..."
"Come on, baby girl. Give me what you've got." Turk smirks. Sky growls and does a flying kick to his chest, sending him flying backwards into the wall. "Rule one, never call me baby girl." She snarls as he pulls himself out of the wall, leaving a huge hole.
"Oh please. The place of going to be massive. Besides, it's weird not living together. It just doesn't feel right." She shrugs.
"No don't even think that way. It's not going to turn out like your last marriage for many reasons. Firstly Mycroft is nothing like your ex. Secondly he's not the cheating type. Thirdly you know that he doesn't do anything unless he is completely over one hundred percent sure it's what he wants and he wants you. You proposed while he was half asleep and he heard you? Isn't that the way. Haha! Humm something big. Hang a huge banner from Big Ben! Or take him out to his favorite restaurant and do one of those flash mob things. They seem to be popular. Just what ever you do make it yours. It'll be special because it comes from you." John says as they make their way to the lifts.
“And what area is that?” He hums, rubbing the tip of his nose over Sherlock’s blushing cheek barely touching him.
"When I met her she was just the daughter of an important man. Now she's taken his place. Runs the country from behind the scenes. Like Mycroft. I saved her from an arranged marriage. She would be in the position she's in today if she had married. She knew that. Technically she's my first wife."
Mel blushes and gets on her hands and knees. “Gentle. Cause of the baby.” She blushes, her thin panties barely covering her cunt.
She whimpers and gets wetter around him, taking the pounding like a good little cockslut. “Two. I’ll make them so perfect. Just like him. I’ll make you perfect children. I promise. I’ll be such a good breeding whore. Even when you’re knocked up you’ll still pump more babies into me.” She moans, bouncing on his cock as he pounds into her.
John walks into the room and snaps the rope together. “Get undressed Sherlock. Quickly now.” He orders.
He shakes his head. “I want you to tease me and test me. Fuck me however you like and if I come you can punish me.” He blushes brightly.
"Mm I see. Thank you for letting me know if your plans but unfortunately I won't let that happen." Sky smiles politely. "Let's cut the shit shall we? I want the territory so I'm going to have it. I don't give a damn about what you will or won't let happen." Peter smirks. "There's one flaw with this plan though. You've come here. Into my home. The heart of my domain. You wouldn't do that unless you were incredibly stupid, which you are, or you've come to make a deal." Sky glares.
He gasps and moans, gripping the base of his cock tightly to stop himself from coming. “Yes, Daddy!”
“So how does she... when we’re asleep?” Sherlock asks softly. “Does she know what I am? I don’t want to hurt her by showing Lydia who I really am.” He asks, wanting to protect to ghost as much as possible.
“I love you, too, Daddy.” She smiles and kisses him sweetly, pressed against him for the first time in months without her belly being in the way.
Greg pulls out his phone and texts Mycroft but the security takes his phone. “No outside contact till the auction is over.” They snap.
John chuckles softly. “I’d work you open slowly with my tongue. Gently rocking it in and out of you. Finally I’d slick my fingers and ease them into you one by one as I sucked your cock.” He kisses along his jaw. “I’d rock my fingers slowly, making sure you’re relaxed and ready for me. Has anyone ever stimulated your prostate?”
“Okay.” Greg nods and opens the lube, pouring some onto Mycroft’s fingers. “All I want you to do is lay back, spread your leg, and feel. Touch your cock, your bollocks, down to your arse hold. Just feel. Touch yourself. Get familiar.” He sits between Mycroft’s legs.
"Thank Christ..." John smiled. "I hate being a patient..." He huffs. "What... What happened?" He is fuzzy on the details from last night.
“I’m not leaving.” Sherlock tells Mycroft, not taking his eyes off John. “I’m here, John. I’m right here.” He squeezes John’s hand.
She kisses his head and holds him close, giggling as he presses his face to her breasts to get comfortable.
Sherlock whimpers, palming himself to John's words. "Not at all..." His breath hitches. "It certainly can't make me beg like you can, *please Captain Watson, please let me cum, sir...*"
“Good boy.” Duke kisses him deeply and strokes his cock. “How was her cunt? She still hasn’t let me fuck her pussy yet. She said it was for you. But I still made her let me fuck her mouth and her tits and her arse. I love stretching out her little pink puckered arsehole. I barely stretched her. Wanted her to know that as long as she doesn’t give me her cunt I’ll fuck her wherever else I can.” He smirks, stroking him teasingly.
She goes over to the drawers and pulls out the bag of all different supplies. "I don't know if you have a preference but there's some of everything in there." She holds out the bag to him and smiles softly.
John comes back in a suit as well, followed by Sherlock who was curious as to why he was dressing so nice.
"Gonna live, Curls?" she asks, "Because I haven't given you the big sister speech, the one where I tell you that if you hurt my baby brother I'll murder you? But, I won't threaten a weakened Alpha." She winks at them both then moves to the fridge, pulling out a plate of cut-up fruit. "For dad," She says before ruffling John's hair. "You two were loud..." she calls over her shoulder as she disappears down the hall.
"And yet you want more, don't you? Greedy little cunt. Why don't you let my Daddy fuck you, hm? Let him fill you up."
"Other than the beach ball strapped to me?" She teases. "I tried. In the space program and everything. I couldn't do the g force. I get nose bleeds sometimes too. Not exactly a good thing to have in space." She giggles.
Sky grunts as she's body slammed into the mat with her thighs wrapped around Butch's neck. 'She really loves you.'
John nods and takes his hand, leading him out of the hotel. He flags down a cab and opens the door for Sherlock.
As the cab stopped in front of the flat, Sherlock pretended to stumble and giggled softly as he picked himself up and opened the door. "Shh.." he giggled, even though Mrs Hudson had gone to stay with her sister for the weekend.
Sky’s eyes widen as her air is cut off, trying to breathe around his cock and loving the degrading treatment. She looks up at him though lidded eyes having fallen completely into sub space.
Mycroft smirks and starts waking the outlets as Carol rocks her hips with him still deep inside her.
"Just tell me when it's done. Please, Mycroft." John pats Mycroft on the elbow and takes a step back. "Join us for lunch or the walk. Or both. You're always welcome, Mycroft. I just... might keep up the snark, if you're fine with it." John smirks, "I find it fun."
Mrs Hudson washed up the dishes for John, despite his protests, so John took a cup of tea into the lounge and sat by the fire with Sherlock at his feet. Tea always tasted better when Mrs Hudson made it.
Mycroft smirks lazily. **Mm.. You look so good right now.. Be careful though, you don't want to alert the staff.. --MH**
She smiles and stands. "I better be getting back to work. I can't show such favoritism or else the other patients may catch on." She winks at Zack. "I'll be back in a bit to check on you." She smiles and squeezes his shoulder gently before leaving.
“That’s a good boy.” She presses a little harder. “Who knows. Maybe I’ll let you knock me up one day.” She smirks.
Sky nods and relaxes. ‘I’m only going to have three today. I’m going to save the others for a while. Until I get impatient again.’
He holds Sherlock's leg up on his shoulder and cards his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "Jesus Sherlock.. You're so fucking tight.." He growls.
He whimpers and nods, rutting against him until he comes hard, kissing him hard to muffle his moans.
Sherlock nods. “Are you okay, Sire? I know... it means a lot to speak to Camille again.” He says softly. “I wasn’t able to pass is on, right but... in my head, she sounded very fond of you.” He says softly.
Greg gets the collar teetering off the edge of the bed. "And which one of us would this lovely thing be for?"
"Behave." Mummy hissed at Sherlock. She turned to John. "I think your service and sacrifice is admirable."
Greg lays there on the bed with his arm flung over his eyes as he tries to calm himself down. "N-need a minute.."
"You wanna ditch your friend and go have some fun?" He smirks and presses closer, sandwiching Sherlock between himself and Mycroft.
“Please Crys.” Mycroft moans. “Please God fuck me, take me. Make me scream your name until I’m hoarse.” He begs.
Nina giggles quietly and pets Brittle. “This is already way more fun than when Sky and I used to play.” She whispers.
“Then don’t. I think you both need some time to cool off and collect your thoughts.” Crystal nods. “And being sober would probably help as well.” She says softly.
John takes a seat beside her, releasing Sherlock's hand in the process as he settles. "I'm good. Things have been good."
“Oh really, that’s so kind of them.” Margaret smiles, looking over to Sherlock. “Did we say our thank yous?”
"No, Sherlock. Should I be worried about *you*?" John's psyche training was kicking into gear. "I thrive on danger, yes. But is there something you're not telling me?" He leaned forward to put the empty plate on the coffee table.
Greg moans and fists Collins hair as he rocks into his mouth. John as Mycroft moan at the tightness in his arse. Sherlock whimpers under him and wraps his legs around him.
Sherlock mutes the call and let’s put a stream of curses that would make the most hardened fighter blanch. He takes a breath and takes it off mute. “I see.” He grounds out.
‘Yup.’ Sky nods and walks over to Sally, sitting in front of her. She’s taller sitting than Sally is when Sally is crouched.
John frowns. "Heads have rolled. Round and round. The circle is now made whole." John repeats, thinking. "They all sound like it's pointing to the London Eye."
John can't seem to get his feet under him. He feels oddly alert to everything but also entirely numb. He can't focus on anything beyond the knowledge that he let someone take his little girl. After seven years, it finally happened and he wasn't prepared.
“That’s right. My holes to use. My pretty little whore.” He thrusts, rubbing Sherlock’s prostate with his cock and his g spot with his fingers.
He blushes at the name again. "This entire situation. It's a tad bit comical, don't you think? You getting me off and John getting Mycroft off?"
Percy's eyes lit up at John's words. Instead of being upset or worried about what would happen in five months, he scrambled down from the table. He made short work of pulling his chair to the fridge and climbing up on it so he was nose to nose with Sherlock's latest ultrasound picture.
"Mm you still want more don't you?" She smirks against his neck and sucks on it as she moves her hips a bit faster.
John takes Sherlock's phone and goes into the kitchen. He calls the number that he swore to himself he's never call again. "Crow, it's John. I'm calling in that favor.." John says as the phone picks up. "Address and do we need the whole team?" A strong female voice asks. "221B Baker Street bring everyone." John says. Greg is dunked under again and held till he stops struggling. He's brought up and he doesn't cough or breathe. A swift kick to the back and he coughs up the water. "I'll love him till the day I die." Greg rasps.
Lydia goes and works on the potatoes. Anthea goes to Mrs. Hudson and pulls her aside. "I need your help, Mrs. Hudson. It's for Lydia."
“Because then they would have known shapeshifters exist. You are the first human to know about our existence in... well a very very long time.” Mycroft sighs and sits down. “He couldn’t shift because he was on 24/7 surveillance. He did it to protect our people. And you. If he escaped, who do you think they would have gone after first?” He looks at John.
“Mm well the wine isn’t very expensive itself but that’s not really why I’m buy it, is it?” He smirks back. “I’d say a million pounds. Reasonable enough, no?”
John smiles and attempts to laugh. “I should be the one helping you, not the other way around.” He says quietly. He stands and holds his hands out to Sherlock. “Come on my love, I know which forest they’re talking about.
John hums and kisses Margaret’s cheek. “What happens at the orgies? Are you going to go to one?” He asks.
"Nothing about anyone in the house. Just uh.. my night terrors are back." He admits quietly, a bit embarrassed.
“You are my daughter. You have always been my daughter.” Mycroft holds her close and kisses her head softly. “I’m sorry I was cold towards you. I was so worried someone would find out about you. I was so afraid of losing you that I didn’t see your lost me. I’m so sorry, sweetheart.”
Sky smirks, waiting in an empty suite after putting Nina to bed. ‘I know you can find me. Be a good little sniffer dog.’ She purrs.
Sherlock moans and arches his back the best he can into John’s thumb. “C- can you magic me some sexy clothes to wear? N- now I’m big?” He asks.
He smiles softly and nods. “Ya know we’re going to head to a club. You two are welcome to join us. On us of course.” Greg smiles.
He gasps and moans, rocking back against his fingers. "Please, John.. L-Let me suck your cock. Shove it down my throat, make me gag, please."
Mel moans and sucks on her tongue. “Please, Mummy. I want it. I need babies so badly. I’ve been waiting for 18 years and I just can’t wait anymore.”
“No it wouldn’t. I’ve been to a gay club before.” John shrugs and opens the front door, walking out into the sidewalk. “I guess I just assumed it was.”
“Did you think I’d think you were some kind of bisexual predator?” Sherlock snorts. “And just to be clear, I’ll always drag your arse home. No matter what. That arse is mine now so obviously it comes home with me.”
“First we register together and get that out of the way so neither you nor I get in trouble. Then we make our own bond contact.” Sherlock finishes his last bite. “I would like kisses to be a bit more often than occasional.” He can’t help the blush creeping over his high cheekbones.
"I know, love." He murmurs. "I'll go out and buy some trash bags tomorrow, so you can have a bath without getting the plaster wet."
Darius smirks and moves behind Sky, kissing her neck as he plays with her breasts to give Dark a nice show. Sky moans and whimpers, starting to ride Dark faster.
She whimpers and nods. She pulls him on top of her wanting to feel covered in him. She kisses face and neck as she wraps her arms and legs around him.
"Not a beta after all," Mycroft says, sniffing the air and frowning. "Shall we expect a happy announcement by the end of the day?" Mycroft points to a man, a beta underling, and points to the case Anthea is holding.
"And here I heard you were getting along with your brother." John quips as they head back out to the sitting room with the bag.
She mewls as he pulls out, staying on her hands and knees with her belly so big it presses against the bed.
“Maybe you can borrow another set and we can play doctor.” Sherlock smirks as he brings in their tea.
"I know, Myc. She's just really sensitive about what you do and say and think. You are the most important person to her." John sighs.
"Can I tell him?" Percy asked John, then bounced up and down in his chair when John gave him a nod. "That was brilliant, Papa!"
Mycroft smiles and picks up another card, 8. “I stick.” He smiles as he throws the cards on the table, “16.”
“Anyway, sorry about that. I was trying to say, I’ve always thought you were incredible. And I don’t know how I got so lucky to meet you that day, but I have wanted to tell you for the longest time and I wasn’t brave enough. I didn’t think I was good enough. But I have to say, I was insanely jealous that you were going to be having this date with some other guy,” John admitted, as he took another mouthful of food in.
She giggles and smiles. “I think though our most romantic was after I asked you to marry me.” She hums. “You said no but it was still pretty good.” She smirks.
“What the hell was that little speech?” Jennifer snaps at them as they walk down the hall. “I don’t understand what you mean.” Sky says softly.
"No, but we haven't really talked about it. But I suppose that if I'm allowed, you lot can plan it."
"My mental health is gone. Every time I get a paper cut I bleed like I've been shot. My hair is falling out. And..." She bites her lip wanting Michael very badly suddenly.
“Calm down there, Johnny. I’m Margaret. I keep the castle up and running. You don’t remember me. We were both wee babes when you’re mother brought you here.” Margaret nods. “Come in. Lunch is almost ready.” She turns around and leads them inside.
Mycroft hums softly. "Mm.. I'm sure /daddy/ will take care of you.." He smirks, knowing that turns John on.
"It's not pretty. I know." Turk chuckles a bit breathlessly, anxious. "I can put a shirt on if it bothers you." He says quickly, already reaching for a shirt.
“Good boy. If you weren’t pregnant I’d make you wear your corset as well. Oust push these up into his face.” He smirks and licks his nipple.
"I.. I didn't say anything out loud. I was thinking and she heard it." Amelia bites her lip looking embarrassed. "I thought that maybe she's actually insane and should see a psychologist." She sounds embarrassed. She doesn't know that Sky has seen hundreds of psychologists all over the world and been to so many doctors and on so many different drugs to help he but nothing works because she's not actually crazy.
John blinks and looks around the spacious cabin. He sits and melts into the plush chair. “No I haven’t. Technically I’ve only ever flown on military crafts.” He chuckles and smiles, a bit excited. He’d always loved flying but now he can enjoy it without the fear of being shot out of the sky.
She smiles softly and relaxes. "Can we go home now?" She asks, knowing the house she had built was ready and everything already moved in.
“Mary Morstan. A known assassin. We believe she was one of the snipers trained on you the day Sherlock jumped.” Mycroft opens the file and starts to read. Not only is the file on Mary but it has everything Sherlock has done since he jumped. Every mission, every kill, every web swept away, and every injury Sherlock sustained while gone.
“Oh, hello there,” John says, his voice croaky from lack of use. “What are you doing on my doorstep?” He asks, as the dog leapt into the open doorway. “Hey no, you’re all wet!” he cries as the dog shakes himself off in the foyer, before taking the stairs. “No, I didn’t say you could come in!” he calls after it, sighing heavily and closing the door before following it upstairs again, the date now long forgotten.
"Mm." Greg whimpers back. He kisses the spot where he bite Mycroft's shoulder. Didn't break the skin but it had to hurt.
Carol hands Danny over to Greg. Danny giggles and fists Greg's shirt in his little hands as he looks at him.
She giggles and blushes, still dripping around their knots. “I guess that means I can turn into whatever I want at this point.”
Carol leads the up to their room. "I'm down the hall two door to the left. Just come get me if you need anything. John and Sherlock are right next door to you there is an adjoining door inside of you need to get to them. Pajamas are inside. Need anything else?" Carol smiles and holds Danny close.
John frowns, not having expected that. “Umm not much. Dad’s family was Protestant and mum’s was Irish Catholic. When they got married the families didn’t like it much. I never learned much about Dad’s family since he drank his life away.” He shrugs. “Mum would talk about her family. Folklore mostly. Fairy tales. Stuff to shut us up long enough to put me and Harry to bed.”
Sherlock growls deep in his throat and twists his hips to lay Margaret on her back. He holds her hands down, pressing them into the covers above her head. “If John wasn’t my soulmate, you would be covered in blood and come three times already.” He hisses in her ear, as he slams into her, roughly, each time hitting her sweet spot.
Even though he hadn't been called, Timothy slips off the sofa and joins his siblings on the floor in front of Sherlock.
"Oh mum," John places a hand on the back of her hair and gently begins to stroke her hair while continuing to scent her. He knows he can't take this pain from her, but the least he can do is show her she's not alone.
“That doesn’t mean we can’t make you happy, at least forget about the pain for a little while.” Magdala says softly.
Harry reaches down with both hands and is soon pulling Mycroft's belt from the loops in his trousers, tossing it on the floor with a clatter she grins down at him. "You and your brother are so dumb, for geniuses... blind to those around you. Your PA has a dirty little secret, and I'm not going to tell you what it is." She winks over at Anthea, then rips Mycroft's trousers open, heedless of fabric and zip.
Morna moans and arches, digging her fingers into his shoulders. “I don’t expect to walk right for at least a week.”
"Everyone this is Zack. Zack this everyone." Chloe smiles and everyone stares because Chloe hasn't brought anyone home in a long time.
Anthea is walking to her work in the city, preparing to get her passport and emergency bag of clothes.
She slowly inches her arm in further, planning on not stopping until either Morna called out or she got to her shoulder. “You’re taking me so well.”
Anthea moans and presses closer, cunt making a wet spot on Mycroft’s trousers. Duke smirks and pulls the top of her dress down to play with her tits as they make out.
"I know.." She rests her hand over his as the babies kick. "It'll be alright. The base has the most advanced medical equipment and training known to man. Or powerful being for that matter. It would actually probably be better if I had them there. Sometimes when people with power give birth things can get.. Out of hand very quickly. They'd be able to handle it. And me." She sighs. "I want you to come. Who ever want to come can come. I need you lot there. I'm might be going to be taking over an empire and giving birth so it's going to be a very trying week."
“Don’t waste it.” Duke smirks as he watches. Anthea licks up the drip rolling down Mycroft’s chin and sticks her tongue back into his mouth. “Isn’t Duke’s cum so yummy?” She mewls and sucks on Mycroft’s bottom lip.
"The man you're thinking of is Ingmar Bergman, and the movie is *The Seventh Seal.* And he and Ingrid have worked together..." He chuckles. "Sounds wonderful." He smiles. "Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine."
"Yes. It's a lot like yours. Behind the scenes and pulling strings." She nods. "I'm out of the game, Crofty."
Jean smiles and cleans them up. Lucas is sitting on the floor with his back to the wall and Sky sits in his lap. He's smoking and she's drinking and they both look fucked up.
“Oh look! A hand!” A god shouts. “A foot!” Another calls, poking at the limbs at they press against Morna’s skin. “Keep going.” They all urge. “How old are they now?” Mycroft asks softly, holding her hand.
Michael rubs Jacobs hand, knowing that he gets uncomfortable when he thinks about when he used to use.
He whimpers and rocks against them, trying to get them deeper. “Yes, please. Make me come so hard that I see stars. Please.”
"Where's Harry?" She says, looking at the car, then at the man standing beside it. "You said you'd bring her?"
“Yes they did. But she kept them safe long enough that they could be rescued and brought here. She did a really good job. Now we can make sure they grow strong and healthy for her.” Sam rubs his fingers though Danny’s hair.
Sherlock smiles and sits up, his back popping as he does. He takes the pen from John and signs the discharge papers. “About bloody time..” He gets up to get changed, dropping his hospital gown and pulling on the clothes Lestrade brought him.
Sherlock whimpers and moans loudly. "C-Cock ring, please!" He whines as he tries to hold back his orgasm.
Greg shrugs. “Might as well start there.” He hands John a cup of tea. “You said that we needed more than just decapitating them. What should we do?” He asks.
Samuel groans and fucks her harder. “Such a cock slut. You just can’t live without being full of cock.” Collin smirks.
John rubs his fingers along the back of his mother's hands then releases them. Settling on his side he opens his arms and pats his chest. "Let me hold you for a minute? When it's too much let me know."
Harry wipes her hand off on her trousers. “So you’re just doing everything backward. I’m surprised you’re not knocked up.”
“He’s beautiful. I’m so happy for you both.” Angelo smiles. “Thank you, Angelo.” John smiles, proud.
"Pay attention now, boy. When I see you again, I'm going to fuck you again and again and again, each time rougher than the last. You won't be able to walk normally for a month after I'm done with you. You won't be able to think straight. I'm going to use your tight little hole as my own personal cumdump. My perfect, filthy little whore. That's all you are."
“Bring him. Bring all your horny little friends. We have plenty of willing holes here to fuck.” Ms. Cheyenne moans desperately as she’s pounded, dripping around their cock.
Mandala sighs and sits on the couch. “I’m dying.” She states. “And I need someone to... Well... be my mother.”
"Good. Carol is taking a nap with John. Turk is managing her pain. Sky and Gita are managing the whole operation. I'm just here to catch." Brain chuckles and sits on the chair.
"I just wanted to catch up with my friend. It's felt like years since I've seen you. Probably because it has."
“I will always be here for you. I’m not going anywhere. You are my daughter.” Mycroft kisses her head.
“The target is at a wedding, Sir. His daughter’s wedding. How would you like me to proceed?” Richardson asks, watching from across the street from the banquet hall.
"Mm, three boys peeing on us while we're changing nappies..." John leans against Sherlock for a moment then stands. "You, cake, bath." He says taking Sherlock's wine and his sparkling water he heads upstairs to the large bathroom he'll be sharing with his parents.
“It’s nice to meet you.” He smiles softly. “I mean it would be nicer if it were these circumstances.”
John smiles softly and cups Sherlock’s face in his hands. “It’s okay. Relax.” He says gently, pressing their foreheads together and gently running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “I know you’ll always have the urge to bite and drink from me. I’m not scared of that. But I don’t want you to be hesitant about being near me because of it.”
“That’s it, my Sire. You’ve been so strong. Well done.” He talks to her, hoping it would help. He doesn’t looks around, keeping his eyes focused on Camille in front of him.
John wakes in a hospital bed. He looks around slowly. He sees Mycroft in a bed next to him and Sherlock and Greg sleeping on the couch in the room.
"Good boy." He runs his fingers through Greg's hair before tugging on it. "You're a good boy for once. But that doesn't change the fact that I need to punish you."
“Coming.” Mycroft hums and opens the door, glass of blood in hand. “Sherlock? Where’ve you been?” He asks and walks back to his desk, letting Sherlock follow.
“Ravashing.” Greg smiles. “I- thinking back. I think I used my powers or whatever I have to fuck you last night. Are you okay?” He asks softly.
"Mm.. can't wait for you to meet everyone.. you get to meet Mikey." He smiles softly, mumbling against him.
“I made a million pounds tonight in an hour. Believe me you’re not making me do anything.” She grins.
Michael bites his lip. "Sh-Sh-She's doing better. She's a-a-alive. So is the man that t-t-took her." He curses and closes his eyes, wanting his stutter to go away.
“I will.” Margaret nods. “What I meant by that was you’re not strong enough to hurt me. Your or Sherlock..”
“Augustus, I told you of this.” Mycroft says softly. “Come now, do you not want her back?” He asks softly. “Shall we be moving into the ceremony room?” He asks, looking at Crystal for help with Augustus.
He kisses him back desperately, holding onto him tightly. “Want to be covered in your cum, sir. Make me look like a used whore.”
“I would find a way to take her down.” Sherlock hums. “I’d go to Romania, and find a way that they imprisoned her and do the same again.”
"Free to go? Was I a prisoner before? I think you'd find me fairly difficult to keep me against my will." John turned in his chair and faced Mycroft. He didn’t let his other side show, didn’t let his eyes flash amber, but he did drop his voice nearly a full octave and spoke in a low growl.
“Myc, go home to Greg. He was John’s best man. I’m sure he needs you right now. I have wooing plans to make.”
Greg's phone starts ringing loudly. "For the love of God.." He groans and silences it after seeing it was max calling.
“No no it doesn’t make me uncomfortable. It’s just… new that’s all. But I want to with you. I really do.”
She moans loudly and presses her face into the mattress, raising her cunt for him to fuck her deeper.
“She’s still alive, ma’am?” Sherlock asks, aghast. He bows his head. “Forgive me, I just never thought she could still be alive.” He says softly. “Thank you, for your help ma’am. If I could just be so brazen as to ask you one last question, after they killed you, do you know at all, if they beheaded you?” He asks softly, not wanting to upset Camille with a personal question.
John's eyes widen when he realizes people are in the loo with them. "Please! Harder! Fuck me like your slut!" He whimpers, trying to push back against him.
"Clever girl." John muses as he looks up at the menu to decide what he wants to get. He rocks on his heels for a moment before finally deciding on a latte, a sticky bun and a black coffee for Gina. Then he waits for Sherlock to add to the order before paying.
“If the church went though all that effort they wouldn’t leave a trace of her ashes. They would have been collected immediately and taken somewhere else. Far far away. It wouldn’t have been written down since they knew vampires lived for as long as possible. The information would be easier for a vampire to come by since a human could only keep that information safe for a lifetime at most.” John sips his tea before putting his mug down. “You’d do anything to get your Sire back if anything happened to him, right? Wouldn’t Mycroft do the same?”
John smiles up at Sherlock. “You should feed from me, whilst I eat. I think it would be... an enjoyable show for you.” He smirks.
She blushes and whimpers, rocking her hips needy. She blushes brighter and hands him a remote for the vibrator fitted into her soaked panties.
“I.. I don’t know.” John’s sighs. “Mum, will you come over please?” He asks softly for Magdala to come over.
“Magdala,” Sherlock frowns. “You don’t know me. This is the most freedom I’ve ever had. Since the age of five I was working in the cotton mills, cleaning chimneys as fires roared underneath. Going between machinery to clean whilst it was still working. Then when war started, I joined that, being ordered around. This is freedom Magdala. That goes for Mycroft as well. This is my freedom, I just complete jobs for Camille.” Sherlock frowns, not understanding what she sees as freedom. “I have told John all the good and bad about being a vampire, and he chose still to be one. If I told him no, then where would his freedom be?” He asks.
Lucile smiles and relaxes into Leona. The fasten seatbelt sign comes on as they get ready to take off.
She shakes her head. “She called me after she was in rehab for a few weeks. I hadn’t talked to her since I left her. She told me she was in rehab and it was working but her body was to shot. So I went back to her like I always do. The past few weeks her liver has been getting worse. She was released from rehab and she moved in with me. She doesn’t drink anymore but her liver wasn’t getting better. So I called you and you told me to bring her here. That you have people here that could help her. How I don’t know but it’s her best shot.” She sighs. “I dated a few people after we split but sleeping with them just seemed so taxing. It wasn’t hot or exciting. Certainly not inspiring.”
“You really don’t know much about us do you? You think you more than you actually do.” Mycroft states simply. “I shall not give you your great great great great great grandmothers for you read my own diary.” Mycroft sighs and looks over at John. “When The Masters arrive, you shall stand, offer them your seat. They may just be the only vampires that can harm you in this city, and they are not the type to give you a warning.”
“Precisely. I spoil you because I love you. He kisses her stomach before leaving to find Mycroft and Sherlock.
"Because Mycroft needed a problem that he could deal with if he needed to. He's far to worried about whether I'll die in a few months or not. It was to distract Mycroft from his own thoughts." Sky sighs. "Besides Ivan was far to submissive for my liking. I mean for fuck sakes who gets on their knees when a 19 year old girl tells them to." She laughs.
‘You’re trying to bring me back. You’ve the right ask whatever you wish. It is up to me if I answer.’ Camille’s smile can be heard in her voice. ‘One of my rings is in a museum display. It is the closest object to you.’
He blushes and smiles shyly. "The others should fit then, they're the same size. I think I'll buy them."
‘I’ll make it big for you. Huge. Stretch your hole around it. Stuff you full of cock and cum.’ She bites at his lip, knowing he can feel her cock growing against his.
Sherlock goes to John. “The listing is for a couple because she is not able to keep an eye on singles anymore. And they are more likely to be destructive to the property. She’s been considering having a hip replacement and I’d much rather be here to assist her without her fussing over it. So if you would please play along this arrangement is beneficial for both of us, John.” He whispers, his height looming over John, not in the usual overpowering aggressive alpha way but more of a protective shielding from everything else.
"Oh. I thought you'd get a new sh... That works too." John stammers watching as each undone button revealed a bit more of Sherlock's skin.
“See? It all worked out fine then.” John smiles softly. “So you’re in love with me and if I’ve been living with you for five years having a string of unsuccessful relationships that most definitely means I’m in love with you too.”
Sherlock whimpers and moans, leaking more at the thought. "Want that.." He blushes as he realizes something. "If Sky can do it, maybe I'll get knocked up by Daddy's friends at his club. Strangers filling me with their babies, and my cunt taking it all."
She smiles softly and uses a few different techniques on his shoulder, being extra careful around his scar. Her hand are small and fluffy but strong so it makes her perfect for giving massages.
"Sherlock. I mean it. Let us handle it." Mycroft says, warningly. "Look after John. I'll update you as I can, and will sweep A flat and C flat at 221."
“Mm very good.” She mumbles and nips at his lips. “Fucked me into labor.” She mumbles, feeling the contractions starting to pick up.
John lets out a whimper, his cock making a wet spot in his trousers. “Maybe we should both fuck her. Really get thing moving along.” His voice waivers, his excitement showing.
"That's right. All mine. How do you think your husband would like watching you fuck me?" She smirks, grinding in his lap.
"I haven't been here in so long.. It burned down when I was young. We used to have picnics out by the tree and we'd hang a swing from the branch.."
"Mm I have something better." He smirks and brings over a soft plastic thing that looks like a stool. "You'll sit on this. The dildo attached to this end will fuck you and the vibration here will constantly stimulate your perfect clit. I'm going to fucking wreck you." He smirks, putting it under him. He pushes the dildo into his arse and turns it on, watching as it fucks him and vibrates right against his clit. "The ties will keep you from moving. You couldn't get away from the stimulation even is you wanted to." He smirks.
“That is true. He’s wanted a family since he was alive. But also...” John shrugs. “Between the military and now learning I can do magic. Magic that... I can’t control fully. I’ve never really thought about children. Children are always something that other people have and shove in my arms.” He hums.
Mycroft smiles. “Is that just because you like being pregnant?” He asks, “you seem to be enjoying carrying your children.” He hums as he rests a hand on Sherlock’s stomach.
John smiles. “Well have to learn.” He sighs sadly. “I don’t remember much, but I know I was mean to you last night. I am really sorry. I dont usually... do that.” He frowns.
He rubs his back and runs his hand over Mycroft's arse. He presses kisses to his jaw as he presses two fingers into Mycroft feeling his come and lube make obscene sounds around his fingers.
“Oh..” Sky gasps as she remember him and as the contractions start. “I love there.. I.. I was a slave there.”
"There's my mate..." John purrs, wrapping his legs around Sherlock's hips. "Now open your bond. Let me feel you again. It'll help, I promise."
John whines into his mouth, returning the kiss ardently, before opening his eyes and looking at him. "Fuck..." He breathes.
John didn't actually have to use the loo. But he couldn’t just sit there, petting Sherlock’s hair and pretending to be madly in love. He’d noticed, while Mrs. Hudson had been drabbling on about the neighbours, that a faint scent of leather had reached his nose. His senses trying to come back online while in between brands of suppressants. Between the scent and the feeling of Sherlock’s hair, he’d wanted to curl forward and bury his nose in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. The Alpha smelled amazing, intoxicating even.
He moans as he slowly takes him deeper, keeping his eyes on Brian. His hand stills as he focuses on Brian's cock.
John looks at the folder and back up at Sherlock. "Tell me truthfully." He murmured. "Do you think I should stay at Marigold House? I feel like since someone has it in for me, maybe I should cut back... Hell, maybe even find a new job." He looks worried. "I love my job, and it has ups and downs... But..." He shrugs his good shoulder.
“Good boy. Such a good boy.” Eli praises and kisses Sherlock’s neck. “Now you’re not allowed to touch yourself. So bring your hands up around the back of my head. You can hold on to my hair.”
Greg chuckles. “Okay mate, flick those two switches.” He says pointing to two switches, and starting to slowly speed up.
He groans as he comes hard from the vibrator and Sherlock’s moans, turning the dial and coming into Sherlock’s mouth.
He blushes brightly and breathes heavily against his chest. "Can I..?" He looks up, his eyes trained on Sherlock's lips.
George moans loudly, arching against Mycroft. "Oh god.. It's been so long.. Your father was the last one to fuck me."
While Sherlock and his brother bicker (more like Sherlock bickering to a brick wall, John senses) John collects his gun and tucks it against the small of his back, covering it with his shirt. Out of habit, he goes to the window and peels back the curtain a smidgen and looks out. Nothing seems out of place, but the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.
"Well to me it sounds like the stalking he did today was a scare tactic. He wanted to make his presence known and felt. The real problem is what he's going to do next." John sighs. "I think I need something stronger then coffee." Greg grumbles. "There's beer behind the container of spleens in the fridge." John offers but Greg shakes his head no.
“Crystal has never fed from a human unless they suggested it first and they consented. For the past twenty three and a half years she’s been working on a substitute blood product to not only keep vampires from feeding on humans but also to save humans lives when there isn’t enough blood banks in their area. She’s killed every vampire that’s she’s ever head of feeding without consent and set the victims up with large estates with endless cash supplies whole also getting them the best therapy and counseling possible.” Diōnē frowns. “Diōnē. Please. Stop.” Crystal frowns. “During every war and battle she’d sneak out the night before and made sure all the innocents were gone from the area so they’d be safe. Her research in medicine and biology has kept humans alive. She single handedly calmed the plague after learning how to do it. She was the midwife who birthed your ancestor. Lucifer’s child when it was born breached. Both mother and child survived. It was the first breach birth where both lived. So you can tell me all you want how she is a monster but the only monster I see here is your willful ignorance.” Diōnē snaps.
Sherlock shrugs. “For carrying babies?” He asks. “Or- I can read everything about a person just as they walk past.” He hums.
John growls and flips them over. He pulls down Sherlock’s trousers. He tosses them somewhere in the room. He palms Sherlock’s hard cock.
"Mm, I think so, yeah. Gotta rest up for tomorrow. Plus, someone's waiting for me back at the estate." He blushes.
"They're coming closer. They're going to see what a slut you are for my cock." She grips his hips and hits his prostate repeatedly.
"Nope. I'll eat them all in front of you. Won't even save any for Father Christmas." John teased as he too stole some icing from the bowl. He licked most of it off his finger then bent down and let Gladstone have the smallest taste.
"It doesn't matter, John. They won't give an addict anything strong than you can give me here for the pain."
Though he's afraid Sherlock might slip out of him, he leans forward and presses their chests together, nuzzling along Sherlock's neck. When nothing seemed to help he tried the last thing he could think of. Ignoring the acrid taste of the rash, he finds the bite and lets his teeth sink home again. He doesn't let go, just pours everything he can into the damn blocking their bond.
"I told you no new deals until the new year. It's done. Over. Finished. I don't care!" George snaps as he paces in his office as Sky sits on his desk painting her nails.
Greg wraps his legs around him digging his heels into his back pulling him closer. He looks completely wrecked and overcome with lust.
He starts to thrust hard into him. “Daddy’s good boy. Maybe if we’re lucky, we can play with Greg while we’re there.”
Mycroft groans as he’s left hanging. He likes being hung up, ready to be used whenever Crystal desires.
Chloe hums and nuzzles him with her eyes still closed. "Mm yes. I'm sure you did." Mrs. Brix looks at their clothes scattered around the room and smiles knowingly.
Sherlock cuddles into him and relaxes. “We’re never going weeks without sex again. That was ridiculous.”
Collin pulls out of him gently and John slips out as well. Collin cleans them up and they all snuggle together.
“Come. Do it. Come down your mummy’s throat while I fill her cunt.” He pulls his head back by his hair and bites at his neck, his cock leaking into Violet.
“Oh.” Sherlock blushes, “I’m sorry, I’m trying to learn so bad.” He whispers. He lets out a loud moan as Dorro holds his hips, getting the attention of the other Gods. Slowly, they come over to Sherlock.
“You don’t have to do anything whole we’re here. We can just dance and drink and relax.” He nuzzles him.
‘But it’s not fair.’ She presses close. ‘I don’t like being away from you. Or Darius. Or Leo. Or the pups.’ She whines softly.
‘Not my fault. Just feels so good to be fucked and filled.’ She whines and transforms, making it feel like he’s deeper inside her.
Once the glass is half full, she cleans her wound and helps it to heal. She takes the glass over to Crystal and holds it out to her. “A Sire’s Blood will help the vampire heal any major wounds. Drink it.” Camille says.
'Mm if you're sure. You just have to think and I'll hear you if you need me.' She hums softly in his head and kisses him back.
“No.” Sherlock says defiantly. “No, we need you here, Doctor. I need you here, I know I’m being selfish, but only because I love you. Please, we’ll work that out later, but I would prefer to face off against Greg than Camille.”
"Yes you can go get dressed. Bring me my dog tags as well." John orders staring to slip into Captain Watson.
Sherlock blushes brightly and stares at his hands, hoping the manager didn't notice his growing erection.
"Mm it seems like it. Look at him. Getting hard for us already. What should we do to him?" Eli smirks.
A third finger. Sherlock stiffens for a moment before relaxing into the pressure. Opening his eyes, he looks up at John, face flushed. "God, you're beautiful..." He mumbles, tongue darting out to taste John's leaking cock.
Sherlock hums in agreement. “Go to sleep John, I don’t know when you’re next going to get the chance.” He says softly as he grabbed a jumper from the bag and laid it against his arm. “No one will harm you, I’ll make sure of that.” He promises.
Cecil groans and kisses her back, holding her hips. He moans as he feels George turn her vibrator up, feeling it against his cock.
“I know you do but magic is a skill and skills take time. You already have wonderful natural ability. Some prominent magic users couldn’t even make a spell work for years and yet you can do it in a matter of seconds. These things take time and patients. I don’t want you hurting yourself. Please?” Maggie begs softly.
“Of course.” Sherlock whispers with a bow of head. “I do not care for rewards, all I want is my Sire happy and to live my life with my human lover. Thank you ma’am, now please rest, we will be trying to bring you back in less than a week. It will be a hard process for you and you’ll need all the energy you can get.” He says softly. Sherlock moves to the door and bow out of the room.
John frowns, but doesn’t say anything. The plane lands and they disembark, John hires a car and drives to the family castle.
*She just has a lot of emotions about everything. She read me the riot act as well for “letting” you go and take Watson.-JW*
Sherlock frowns deeply as he watched Greg walk away. He went after him once he gathered his thoughts. He presses his head against the door and knocks lightly. "Greg..?"
Jacob kisses his hand, relaxing against him. "Listen, baby. I have a little shindig goin down here in the colonies. Wanna come?" Veronica asks. "Vegas?" Sky asks. "Vegas." Veronica smiles.
“Thought so.” Eli smiles softly and nods, leading Mycroft out of the shower. He dries him off gently before carrying him to bed.
Teddy takes off from the table to get ready to go see her boyfriend. Tim looks a bit shell shocked as he turns and walks out the back door over to Sarah’s house.
"How you and Daddy would go out on "special date nights" with the couples in the neighborhood. But Lock and I knew better. You always brought a little bag of toys with you. You left it out one night and Sherlock found it and we played together with them."
“It’s most likely the doctor that connects them. There aren’t many doctors willing to do gender reassignment. Start there and you’re sure to find the connection.”
Sky hold his hand and leads him over to the table with everyone already sitting there except Zack who's late.
“This.. Girl? Has no experience. We’ve been in this business longer than she’s been alive.” The eldest man says.
"Don't give him the time of day. Make sure she's alright. She's constantly worried about messing up and people leaving her. Make sure she knows you won't walk away so easily."
Sherlock watches her go before he speaks. “If you want me back, and I mean really want me, then you're going to have to work for it. You’re going to go to therapy. We’re going to go to couples therapy. We’re going to communicate openly and honestly if it fucking kills us. We’re not going to hurt her anymore. We’re going to get our shit together and be the parents she deserves. No more fights. No more resentment. No more lies. No more leaving. We’re going to act like adults and fix our relationship. Am I clear?” He looks at John.
Samuel smirks and shows off his massive cock. “Well fuck me.” Collin licks his lips. “Whenever you want.” Samuel smirks and Collin chuckles. “You know your wife has such a nice cunt but I’m a bit to big for it. And by a bit I mean quite a few inches. So she took me deeper. So deep in fact I filled her womb directly. Not once. Not twice. But four times.” Samuel smirks. “Show him how big I made your belly.” He whispers to Carol.
She looks at Greg and smiles so brightly it would make the sun jealous. She pulls Greg into a very tight hug. "I approve." She says happily. Greg is stunned for a moment and then hugs her back.
"ਪਿਛਲੀ ਵਾਰ ਮੈਨੂੰ ਇਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਮਾਤਾ ਸੀ ਨੇ ਕੀਤੀ." Sky slips into punjabi, ("The last time I had these your mother made them"). "ਜੋ ਕਿ ਇਸ ਲਈ ਲੰਬੇ ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾ ਸੀ." Zack smiles, ("That was so long ago").
He bites his lip as he watches, holding back a moan as the pressure eases off his cock as she unzips him.
Sherlock hums. “You’re worried Magdala, I can feel it.” He says softly. “What are you worried about?”
“It’s a good thing I don’t need a special way.” Sky raises her hand and flicks her wrist making the wall crumple easily.
Mycroft smiles and listens to him. Everyone stares in surprise and awe of Greg's singing as they listen to him.
“You.. when I deduced you you didn’t call me names or tell me to get out. You praised it. Why?” Sherlock looks at him, completely confused.
John laughed, then turned to face Sherlock as best he could while still buckled in, "So, should I keep doing a terrible job of flirting? Or would you like to pretend I didn't attempt it?"
Mycroft nods, sipping his drink slowly to calm his nerves, and to bolster his courage. After a minute or two, he swallows decisively, takes off his shoes and socks and belt, before heading to the bathroom to join Greg there.
Sherlock bites his lip. He can’t lie to John. He promised he wouldn’t. He’ll have to come clean. “Promise you won’t get upset..”
Marianne laughs. "Guilty as charged..." She nodded. "I'm a sucker for redheads, especially ones with tongue piercings." She grinned.
“Because we don’t need them. The coven is our family. In the old days we only used men to have children and grow the coven. Unless they really liked the man.” Margaret hums.
He frowns and nods, instructing Fitz to start setting up extra security. “I’ll go talk to Matthias.”
**That sounds wonderful, My, but no. I'll just power through all this and I'll come home to you without all this weighing on my mind. Just a few hours and I'll be free and clear. By the way, I can't wait until you can change your signature to ML.--GL** Greg smiles.
. There is no way John would want him now. Not ever. He had worked so hard to get him and John back to a place of normalcy and now, this had ruined everything.
"This." She sighs and lays her hand on the scanner. 'No prints detected' the display shows. "I don't have fingerprints."
“There’s a cock rink in the third drawer of your desk. Remember?” Sherlock moans as Mycroft cock nudges his cervix.
"You want to be full of our cocks, don't you?" He kisses his neck and eases a slick finger into him along side Greg's cock to stretch him more.
"Mm that's to bad because I was thinking of making that curry dish you love.. But since you wanna stay in bed all day I guess you're not hungry.." Greg knows that John has to be very hungry by this point from all the sex and lazing about.
Lydia nods, she hits Sherlock and shouts “tag!” Before floating off. John scrambles out of Sherlock’s arms and runs off in the opposite direction.
John forgoes the chocolate sauce completely and just adds some sprinkles to his before taking a seat to dig in. It's been ages since he's had a sundae and after a few bites he remembers why. "Wow, that's sweet."
"Shh," John whispers softly as the pups stir, sensing their parent's stress. "I've seen worse, I'm sure." John leans in and presses a kiss to Sherlock's temple.
"Oh god yeah." She moans as he rubs her g spot. "Fuck me and fill me one more time. Then we'll round them up. Fuck me into the mattress and then we'll go watch Veronica get pregnant."
“Hi, daddy.” She smiles and stretches up, kissing his cheek. “How are you?” She asks, trying not to let on how nervous she is.
"He's fine, Greg. Ivan wouldn't hurt a fly unless I told him to. He's certainly no threat to any of us." Sky smiles as the waitress comes back with their drinks.
"You are here for her. She's sleeping and you should be as well. I'm up and I'll wake you if anything happens. I promise. Sleep, love. Please." He rubs his thumb over his cheek gently.
Mycroft smiles and pulls Magdala back slightly. “Go say thank you to Diōnē it’s all her work. I want to speak with Crystal for a moment.” He whispers, helping Magdala on his lap.
“She is a good girl. Come here, sweetie. Put that cum in Mummy’s pussy.” Chloe moves into the couch and spreads her legs, tilting her hips up. Mel moves and holds Chloe’s hips   She opens her mouth and slowly lets Zack’s cum spill from her mouth right into Chloe’s open waiting cunt.
keep him safe, at least until the pups are here. Oh, don't look at me like that...'' Mycroft sighs then explain, "No, not because he is an Omega. Because he is essentially my brother in law, and he's carrying my kin. I might... Be a tad fond of your mate. And if you ever tell him that I will murderer you. I enjoy the little threats he gives me."
"You fuckers out here having this brilliant orgy and no one called me?" Cynthia pouts, stripping as she walks closer. "Bunch of selfish pricks. You lot better make it up to me." She cups Lydia's face and kisses her softly.
Mycroft nods and settles against the pillows, looking ashen. "I... I wouldn't normally ask." He whispered. "But you said his name as you cuddled into me..."
Greg moans and pulls him to his bedroom. He strips him. "Oh my god.." He whimpers as he sees the plug already inside Sherlock, stretching him. "You beautiful perfect randy creature. You already prepared yourself for me.. You are perfect.." He kisses him.
Mycroft watches him, absolutely fascinated. "Gregory..." He murmurs, the word turning into a needy whine as the tight heat envelopes him.
"Slow. We're in no rush what so ever.." Lydia finally speaking quietly so she doesn't have to let go of Sherlock's hands.
He bites his shoulder and fucks him harder. He grips the headboard and Mycroft's hip and pounds into his prostate.
“I don’t... feel anything but a slight sense of dread and anxiety.” Sherlock whispers. “We’ll talk about it later, please just hurry.” He stays close by John’s side as he watches his friend. No his boyfriend, pray to a God he knows doesn’t exist.
George smirks as he walks into the bathroom, seeing how needy and excited Cecil is for him. "Good boy. You didn't touch yourself. Such a good boy." He praises and pulls him close, kissing him deeply.
The next day John is so thrilled to have Sherlock with him that he doesn't even grumble when two agents take them to his doctors. Unlike last time, John is too excited to hear his pups heartbeats to be nervous about the appointment. He only grimaced distastefully at the gown he's expected to wear and has Sherlock button the back closed.
“You just love boasting about the triplet thing.” Sherlock chuckled. “Your dad is going to have something to say about it for sure.”
John frowns, "you're right. No matter what we do, she'll be in danger. That's not going to change as much as we want it to." He lifts a hand up to stroke the back of Sherlocks neck. "Surprisingly, all parents feel like this. That they won't be able to protect their children, that somewhere along the way they're going to fail.." he swallows, "If I could bubble wrap her, I would but we can't."
Sherlock feels the love and joy for John, but frowns as he feels more. He looks over to Mycroft and cock his head to one side. He feels love towards him, romantic love, and care and loyalty. But he also feels inadequacy. “Oh...” he breath, pulling his hand away and looking back to Magdala.
“I’m never leaving you again, John. Not for as long as I live. Even after that.” Sherlock takes John’s hand and kisses his knuckles.
"We're trying to do better this time and as much as I'd love to skip the hard parts and get you in bed again, I also want to do this right." John tells him, finally releasing Sherlock's shirt and smoothing it back down.
Sherlock blushes softly and tries to keep a straight face. "I.. Yes, I do rather enjoy the control John has to offer."
"It... it just felt right. One moment my brain was telling me that you're my mate. The next.. my teeth were sinking into you like your skin was made of butter."
She moans loudly, her cunt pulsing around him. “Yes! Fuck, don’t stop! Want you to fill my cunt up with your cum. Don’t even bother plugging me, I want you to fuck your seed so deep into me that it can’t possibly leak out.”
He pulls out so only the tip is inside John. He presses his head to his shoulder as he sinks back into him slowly.
“No no. I’m just going to have a drink and rest. It’s been an eventful few days.” Camille smiles softly and nods. “Thank you, my son. For everything.”
Sherlock cries out and comes hard suddenly. He wraps his legs around Mycroft so he'll keep fucking him. He can already feel his cock hardening again.
Sky whimpers softly and presses her face to his skin. “It’s a boy.” Brain smiles as he looks the baby over. “It’s John’s.” She mumbles, having just had John’s first baby.
“It’s my fault. I should have made sure. I’m meticulous and yet things still slip through my fingers.” Eli sighs.
John nods, he gets everything ready before holding it close to the wound. “It’s going to be okay, mate. We’re here. You’re going to be okay.” John says. As soon as Crystal moves her hands, he starts to quickly suture the wound. “That’s it Greg, keep breathing for me, mate.” John says over and over. He doesn’t care if Greg can hear him. It helps John to keep calm if he’s talking to the patient.
He smirks. "Mm.. Sherlock, how about you suck off John? I feel like we're going to have a lot of fun tonight." He hums, nipping John's jaw. "We're going to see how many times we can make you come."
His eyes are fixed on the last part: yours forever. He reads it over and over, mouthing the words a few times quietly to himself.
John smiles softly. "Yes, I enjoy sex with both men and women, but I prefer the romantic company of men... You in particular, so perhaps I'm Sherlock-romantic? How's that?"
"You know before I met you I was falling apart. Fast. I couldn't keep it together and I didn't care. I really didn't. I know that my family was worried and scared for me but I just couldn't deal with it." She bites her lip thinking out loud. "I kept thinking 'what am I doing here? What is the point? Why am I here?' And I didn't have an answer. This person that I hate. They're coming back, Michael. And I'm terrified because they know things about me. Horrible things that I've blocked away. I'm so afraid of what they're going to do to the people I love. It'll all be my fault. I didn't care before if I died as long as the people I loved were safe. I didn't care if he killed me as long as they were safe. But.." She looks up at him with tears in her eyes. "I care now. I care because I know you and I want to be with you and I want to make you happy. But I'm still so scared and I hate myself for every moment I put you in danger."
“I know, you’ve done really well, let’s get you back to bed,” John suggests, carefully turning Sherlock around again. “Tomorrow we can try making it out to the corridor. Your body will get the hang of it again, the more you move. You really pushed yourself this last week didn’t you? You really should have gone to a hospital,” John scolds him.
"If you make John, Mycroft, and Greg come like a good boy then I'll fuck you. You're allowed to come as much as you want."
“Good. Do you wanna meet some of the performers before we go? Or do you want to head back to mine and open your presents?” Jason smiles, thumb rubbing the back of Sherlock’s neck.
Jason growls softly and pulls him closer, pressing him close. "You know when you wear v necks it makes me think very very dirty things." He kisses along his jaw and down his neck. "Mm so tell me, handsome. Where have I been?"
Mycroft smiles and puts the black lacy material on. “Oo this feels so good.” He hums. It did feel a little snug but the way it clings to his body, Mycroft knew every curve was on show. “I hope the other God’s like me.”
Diōnē smiles and kisses her cheek softly. “Thank you. It must feel strange knowing the child will be me.”
"I.. I want to apologize. Just by being here with me has put you in danger. I'm sorry. I would understand if you wouldn't want to associate with me any longer." She looks down at her plate.
“No he’s been... ordering and bullying my children. And when he was speaking to Doctor Watson, he may as well have condemned him to death for being human.” Mycroft sighs. “Are you saying I’m blind, sister?” He asks.
“It’s not awful. You’re still putting too much pressure on yourself. Sherlock is probably feeling the same thing and you don’t think he’s awful, right?” Greg picks up a menu at the far side of the table. “I’m starving. You want something?”
“Fuck that’s hot.” Greg groans as he watches her. “Move it. Let’s go find Maggie.” He smirks and follows her, watching her arse jiggle around the plug as she walks.
Mycroft frowns deeply. "Sherlock hit his head when Harry pushed him back. Lydia thinks he might have a concussion. He wasn't making much sense and he didn't seem to be understanding."
