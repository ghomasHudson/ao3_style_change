"I had no choice!" Hawkeye growled, squaring up to Logan. The mutant was a good foot taller than him, and probably a few dozen pounds bigger, but Clint didn't have the sense to care. "Maybe you did. What'd he offer you? You sold her out, didn't you?"
The small exchange almost made Steve smile - at least until he considered what it might mean. He hadn't been able to access the full report of what had happened while Phil and Clint were held captive, and he'd found that more than slightly troubling. Coupling that with Natasha's sudden protectiveness left him wondering just how bad it really was.
"I don't have anywhere I need to go. Especially if we're goin' wherever this Natasha-in-leather is."
Natasha passed Scott another shot. "I think that's a double," she affirmed, watching as he downed it before smiling at Logan. "You opened the door, so spill. You tell yours and maybe I'll be nice and tell some of mine." Natasha had been part of plenty of interesting scenarios, and she had no real problem disclosing them - especially if it got Logan talking.
Fury nodded, waiting for everyone else to file out before he tilted his head at Coulson. "You don't usually ask to talk to me one-on-one. Something must be pretty wrong." Phil was so capable of handling things that Fury rarely had to go to the man for updates and pretty much never just to make sure things were going smoothly. Fury trusted Coulson enough to know that no news was good news. He also knew that when the agent wanted to talk one-on-one, something was weighing on his mind.
"That's really not any fun," Steve complained. Still he reluctantly pulled away. "Okay, go. Get yourself some breakfast and get back to work. Bruce deserves some good coffee for giving us extra time." //Especially after yesterday.// That went unsaid mostly because Steve didn't want to choose that moment to start a fight. He just wanted to enjoy his last couple seconds with Tony before the man schlepped off to the lab for the day and possibly longer. They'd used up their Get Out of Jail Free card, and he knew it. "I'll maybe stop in later if you guys aren't too busy." He didn't want to be a distraction, and it wouldn't be fair to sit around taking up space and focus when he couldn't contribute anything to the process except a lot of concerns.
"Me? Vindictive?" Scott smirked. "Yeah, probably. Mostly I just think me puking in the middle of everything would kill the mood. I'm not into that." He couldn't quite resist another kiss, though, lingering as long as he dared without losing his own tenuous control. "It's kind of weird. I've never actually had a date with somebody I could make eye contact with." The idea that when it finally did happen he could look into Logan's eyes and have the favor returned left him excited and vaguely terrified. It was a level of nudity Scott wasn't accustomed to.
Logan shrugged, leaning back long enough for the waitress to put their food on the table. "Guess so. I can't help wonderin' if the me before I forgot everything had anyone. There was a woman's body in the wreckage at Three Mile. I remember starin' at her, thinkin' I oughta know who she was." He shook his head and frowned. "No idea, though. Couldn't find anything on 'er. Really, not sure I wanna know. I met Stryker before he died. Things he said... makes me unsure if I wanna know who I was before."
Logan quirked a faint grin at that. "Don't worry. I'll still call you a dick when people're lookin'. And I'm not readin' you a bedtime story," he promised, tossing the TV remote to Scott. "But, y'know, there's the boob tube if you need some background noise. Probably give you fewer nightmares, too." He stood and stretched, his back popping a few times. "Think I'm gonna turn in. I'm sure SHIELD'll drag me outta bed first thing to get all the details they can outta me."
Coulson smiled back mildly, carefully keeping silent. He didn't generally lie unless he needed to, so instead he let the comment lie. "I meant it about the sleep pants. That's a thing. I passed on the boxers, though. That seemed a bit intimate." He watched quietly as Clint navigated the kitchen like he belonged there.  It made his heart constrict rather painfully. "Thank you." Coulson nodded toward the new pot. "For the coffee. I appreciate it. After yesterday, I definitely need it."
Another sharp knock and a sharper reminder to get out of the room interrupted Tony. He sighed. "...give you a pat on the back," he finished, his voice raised for their unwanted audience. "Remind me to buy Coulson a month-long vacation to Antarctica."
Tony sighed but stayed perched on the edge of the bed rather than laying back down. "If Fury has his way, I'll be wearing a cone of shame before this is all over," he groused. Uninterested in Steve dwelling on his escape attempt, Tony changed the subject. "So how's the rest of the team?"
Tony thought he'd imagined the twitch of Steve's fingers against his hand, but Coulson's quiet whisper brought his head up like a shot. The sight of Steve's blue eyes, bleary though they were, was an immense relief. "Steve," he whispered, relief washing over his features. "Don't... don't try to talk. The mask..." Tony took a shaky breath, swiping at his face to try and make himself look a little more dignified. There were a million things Tony wanted to say at once, and it took him a minute to gather his thoughts. "First, I love you, but goddammit, if you ever do anything like this again..." Tony trailed off, his voice shaking. He remembered a moment later that, considering what the gun had done to Steve, there was a solid chance he actually *wouldn't* be doing anything like that again. "Steve..." Tony looked away, though his hand still rested on his lover's. "Steve, the serum... it's gone. For now. Probably just… uh, maybe temporary? We don’t know."
Steve couldn't help smiling back. "A little. Then more when we get home," he suggested. On the one hand, their burgeoning relationship was a lot more than sex to him. On the other hand, it was difficult not to indulge when there was so obvious a spark between them. "Unless you'd like me to be a little more traditional about all this. We started things off at the deep end of the pool, so there's nothing wrong with putting the brakes on for awhile and wading in a little more slowly."
Taking Darien's cue, Clint hooked a hand behind the man's skull and started thrusting, his other hand keeping a white-knuckle grip on the countertop. With an unrestrained cry, he came down Darien's throat, burying himself balls-deep in the tight heat. He held Darien there a little longer than was strictly polite before staggering backwards and sliding to the floor, his back against the cabinets opposite Darien. He grinned sloppily and let his head fall back, panting and clearly a bit more relaxed than he had been a few moments ago.
"We find him, or at least some part of the organization. We have a few vague traces for these signals, so the first step is to find someone... or maybe to wait for them to find us. If they really want you, they'll eventually come after you. If they really want Tony, they'll come after him. So we post security, we secure the Tower, and we wait. You wait. Clint and I search."
"This had better be good. I'm enjoying my favorite cocktail and Cap." There was a pause as Coulson relayed his request, then, "You people have really got to learn what 'personal space' means." Another awkward pause in which neither of the man said anything. "Fine. If you people will leave me alone." There was a quiet click as the connection was terminated from the other end.
The feral mutant drew away from Steve, groaning a small protest as his cock slipped from the man's body. He flipped Steve onto his stomach and then urged him onto his hands and knees. His gaze moved back to Tony. "Now.." he said with a tilt of his head.
Logan couldn't help grinning in a slightly sadistic manner, and he chuckled as he thought about it. "And that's why she's not just hot, she's incredibly hot," he decided, then pressed a kiss to Scott's lips. "Not as hot as you, but still..." He sighed. 'Rough day' didn't begin to cover it, but he couldn't squelch the sense of satisfaction knowing that Nat had brought them a couple of prizes, at least. "Maybe they can help us find Loki's hideout. And maybe they've got a few dozen bruises for their troubles, too. Broken bone or two wouldn't hurt my feelings, in fact."
Scott kept his hold on Logan not to hold him back - that wasn't even physically possible - but to maintain contact. "You're fine. I've been with you the whole time. You're you. Which means you're kind of a dick sometimes, but you're you." Scott looked down the hallway through the small window in the doors going back to the rooms and saw continual activity in and out of the room to which they'd taken Natasha. "He's just worried, and I can't blame him for that."
Natasha smirked at Logan's commentary. "Stark's not so bad. Worse once you get to know him, sure, but not so bad." In truth she kind of liked Tony. She still would have broken his hand if he tried to touch her in anything but a friendly manner, but she liked him. He had style, at least, and an interesting way of dealing with the world.
The door closed and Steve groaned. "We need to remember to lock the door next time, not just close it. Would've given us a few seconds more of a head start."
Logan tensed, then grabbed Tony by the hair and pulled him in for a brief but aggressive kiss. "Just no hickies," he growled with an ironic smirk, then gave Tony a solid bite on the jaw.
"Mostly because I can't help but watch Captain America look desperate and horny and like he's ready to beg me to fuck him," Tony breathed, chocolate brown eyes looking almost jet black as he gave Steve a wicked smirk. His fingers drifted lower, over Steve's balls, lightly teasing Steve's entrance. "Not easy, you know. I'm anxious to see you cum so hard you forget who you are..."
A little more Pepper and Steve helping each other out with emotional health, and a tiny dash of science.
Tony smiled devilishly as he slowly started working a finger into Steve's body. The lack of hesitance on his part was intoxicating. It was strange, seeing the seemingly straight-laced blonde so wanton. He leaned in for a long, deep kiss as his finger slowly worked into his lover's body, drawing back to pant for air a moment later. "Dear god, you're tight..." he breathed. "You're gonna feel so good..."
It hurt to think that Tony blamed himself, that he thought a momentary lapse of judgment or awareness made him culpable somehow. Steve closed the space between them again, unwilling to let Tony close him off. He knew how badly Tony needed someone even if he didn’t want the comfort. “Look at me. Tony, please,” he whispered, waiting until the man turned before reaching up to touch his stubbled cheek. Steve’s breath caught at the bold contact. He wished that the circumstances were something totally different. Once he realized his feelings, Steve had begun to entertain idle fantasies that once Tony recovered they could do things right with dinner and dancing or a movie at home.
Bruce sighed and absently began cleaning his glasses on the tail of his shirt. “Me too. For Steve’s sake if nothing else. I heard some chatter. Was it as bad as they said?”
By the end, Steve was more than happy to flee from the store with Logan's new clothes and retreat to the nearest restaurant. "Sometimes I think being standoffish isn't so bad." Not nearly as many people tried to bother Natasha if they happened to spot her out in the world. The woman exuded an air of 'touch me and die' that Steve knew he'd never pull off. "This place has great food. You won't be disappointed."
Instead of being put out by the lack of hospitality, Sif placed her hands on the conference table and met his gaze intently. "Thor is in the grip of some spell, our king lies in the Odinsleep, and the Lady Frigga is being held by a companion of Loki's."
Steve silently resolved not to let Tony get hurt no matter what happened or how stupid he got as the blood flowed south. He was less worried about himself. In fact Steve found it absolutely exhilarating to think that he could give as good as he got with Logan and not worry that the man might get hurt. Despite being slightly less unbreakable himself, Steve knew he could take whatever Logan gave him. He drew back, breathless with the possibilities laid out before him. "Don't even know what I want to do first," he confessed. It was hard enough to choose with one partner after so long, but with two gorgeous men surrounding him, Steve was entirely at a loss.
When Phil looked down a few minutes later, he was surprised to see Natasha fast asleep against Clint's shoulder. It was a show of trust that he knew she wouldn't allow around most people, and he smiled at the quiet, peaceful moment. "We should get to bed," he suggested, nudging her gently and grabbing the remote to turn off the television. "C'mon, everybody up - just for a minute."
"What - " Tony stopped himself. Hearing a rundown of what he was about to see was probably the last thing he needed. A mix of fear and relief rattled around in him as he looked up at Coulson. "Let's go see him," he said simply. He knew Steve meant a lot to all of them, but aside from Tony, there probably wasn't anyone in the room who cared more about Steve Rogers than Coulson did.
"Actually, they did. Which is why I said bad news, not terrible news," Coulson countered easily. "We don't need your participation at all if you'd prefer not to be involved. Mr. Summers has been missing for almost a month already. To be honest, the chances of finding him get slimmer every day. If we do, there are no guarantees that we're still looking at a rescue mission and not a recovery. Since you're with us now, it just seemed fair to give you an appraisal of the situation."
This is awful. Like, this is... it's bad. This chapter contains rape, mentions of past mental and sexual abuse, and it's just really dark and really triggering. You know it happens now, so if you don't feel like you want to/can read it? Nobody's going to hold it against you, least of all us. I CAN promise that it gets better.
Steve couldn’t help grinning in response and tugging Tony into another kiss. It was soft and gentle, a promise without words. “In that case, I think we’ve officially come to an agreement. If he wore bolder or Tony was less fragile, Steve would have been sorely tempted to ask Tony to stay the night even if only to curl up together and stay close. Instead he offered, “Can I walk you back to your room?”
"Labels. I hate labels. I prefer to think of it as open-minded," Tony responded, glancing up at Steve and smiling.
"I'll be in the lab tomorrow watching the readouts and relaying any relevant information to the people calling the shots," Jemma agreed. She happily edged in against Bruce as they walked. He smelled like chocolate and soap, and she couldn't help but smile at the combination. "The suit should help cover for anything that isn't back to normal yet. He may not be able to heal like usual, but with the suit as an extra layer of protection and Jarvis assisting him with the controls, he should be able to avoid taking any hits to begin with. Ideally."
Since Scott seemed more curious than horrified, Logan quirked a faint smile. Talking was saving him having to shove down more jello. That was already a plus. The fact that Scott seemed actually excited at the prospect made it even more interesting. Add that to Nat's offer, "Alright. But Scott, I just wanna remind ya that you asked me to tell ya." He leaned in and grinned. "So, Nat, I know you at least heard about the whole explosive mess with Tony and Steve... What stayed outta the press is that I kinda ended up goin' to bed with 'em that night too."
"Thanks, but I'll pass on that. SHIELD should have more guards up here in another hour or so. I'll get some-" The sound of the door slamming open behind them had Steve on his feet in moments despite the fact that he had felt dead tired moments before. The sight that greeted him left Steve reeling all over again. The man that Natasha and Clint were supposed to be tracking stood in front of him, and there were no grainy security images to hide any hope that it might be someone else. "Bucky..." The word trailed off as the other man's expression didn't change in the slightest.
"This place is reinforced, right?" Scott asked, though he didn't really wait for an answer before he stopped talking and started focusing. It wasn't as easy as it had been with a visor. It took thought, and he had to use internal muscles - mental, for all he knew - to dilute the beam into something focused. It wasn't as clean as he would have liked, but Scott still managed to tear through the neck of the mock-up of Loki, and he couldn't help smiling at the effort.
Though it did nothing to convince him that girls were anymore interesting than they had been an hour before, Darien wasn't immune to the smell of sex in the air or the way Nat writhed on the bed. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the woman was stunning. He licked his lips, unconsciously rubbing the growing erection pressing against the fly of his jeans.
“Coffee?” Bucky grabbed the nearest pillow and threw it at Steve. “I see you’re still a little wiseass.” It was meant with a great deal of affection. It also came as something of a relief to find that Steve had remained the same old Steve Bucky had known despite everything that had happened. “You could’ve brought me something, y’know?” He folded his arms across his chest, adopting a mock angry expression. “Here I am laid up in a hospital bed and what do I get? No candy, no flowers, no nothing. Zip, zada. Is that anyway to greet an old, sick friend?”
Coulson stared directly back at the other man and continued to eat at a normal human pace until Tony got completely disgusted. Finally he relented with a hint of a smile. Coulson gathered his coffee to drink while he likely sat waiting outside the room again. He knew Tony wasn't helpless. He also knew Tony didn't do well alone in times of crisis, so he pitched in as Stark's chauffeur service without complaint. Knowing that Steve was on the mend made his morning a few thousand times better, and he knew it did the same for Tony. They found most of the staff they encountered downstairs looking far less harried and far more rested. Some of them even smiled as they made their way to Steve's room. Outside the door, Coulson leaned against the wall. "Go on. We both know who he wants to see."
"Course I can do that," Fitz blustered as if it was the most obvious thing he'd ever said. He ignored the look that Simmons was giving him. He was too busy staring at the gorgeous ball of metal in his palms and thinking about everything he could do with it.
Scott's voice was decidedly more shaken when it came back, "No. Nothing. We've lost visual contact."
Logan smiled faintly as he noted the arm around his waist, and leaned back into the weight behind him. "Kayla..." As he slowly regained more awareness though, he registered a persistent stale booze smell and overpriced cologne. "Stark!" Logan was out of the bed and on his feet in an instant.
"Valid point. Very valid." Panting, Darien gave up on the idea of pride. He wanted to get off, and he wanted it as soon as possible. "Right here works, then. You just tell me how you want it. I guess at this point it's dumb to pretend anything is off the menu."
"You're just seein' your own problems," Logan snapped, though he let Scott usher him to a seat. "I'm fine."
"To be fair, we talked about picking someone up... not picking up girls specifically." Steve let the comment lie and ordered a Coke from the bartender. Being attracted to both genders had been something to hide carefully once upon a time, but times had changed. He'd done his fair share of reading up on the situation, but seeing in practice men openly dancing together and having a good time was a whole other thing. It was nice, actually. He looked sideways at Logan and arched an eyebrow. "You've really only ever dated girls?" Tony had a point - given the man's longevity it seemed odd to think he'd never at least tried anything outside the box. //Of course he may just not remember it.//
"He seems pretty together," Darien agreed. "I'd tend to think that his professional opinion is likely to be right." He still didn't understand the half of Loki's story, but from what he heard, Coulson had been in the thick of things the first time. He didn't believe half the stories, but if some of them were true, they were all in trouble. "They have any idea what the dick wants?"
"Be there. That's all he'll want. Prove him wrong. You show him he's still got you. I'll show him he's got SHIELD." Coulson wheeled Tony off the elevator and into his room. "You need any help, let me know. I know I'm a pretty poor back up for Captain America, but I can make sure you eat and shower and sleep until Steve's up to baby sitting again." Left to his own devices, Coulson worried that Tony would stay up all night reading and get zero of his own healing done.
Tony couldn't help smiling at Steve's insistence on staying by his side. "Making a promise like that, you'd better be," he said groggily. "When I wake up, the first thing I wanna see is that handsome face of yours." Flirting with the other man had become second nature to Tony. He relished the way Steve became so easily flustered. Indeed, Tony had never seen anyone blush as fiercely or quite as much as Steve. The truth of the matter was that he had grown attracted and attached to Captain America in a short space of time. To his great personal pride, Tony had managed not to make a move. He was too unsure about Steve. The sexual tension was mutual, that much was clear, but exactly how might Steve react? It might be worth it to find out. Before Tony could pursue this train of thought any further, he was out like a light.
Logan growled, his hand tangling in Scott's hair to jerk the man's head back and give him access to nip at Scott's stubbled throat. The words had been more than enough to bring out the animal in Logan, and he grabbed the bottle of lube from the nightstand. A moment later, slick fingers lightly brushed over Scott's throbbing cock, grazing his balls before lightly circling his puckered entrance. Logan had to remind himself to go slow. //Real slow...// Scott hadn't made any sort of a point of bringing up his virginity, and Logan wasn't going to play the "are you sure" game. Obviously, Scott was pretty damned sure, and Logan didn't see any reason to press the matter.
He had Jarvis lead him back to Scott, and smiled at his lover, watching the man attempting to interact with Sif. The Asgardian woman towered over Scott, making the scene that much more amusing. "You two havin' fun?"
Alan was quick to grasp a handful of Darien's hair and present the man with his cock. "Go on. You heard him."
Phil blushed to the tips of his ears but didn't let his expression change. "Oh, I'm not supposed to be watching. Now it's just a fetish." He couldn't help but shake his head as he added, "I wonder who's watching me." Catching Clint's gaze, he pressed, "We both know however I ended up still being alive and walking around, it wasn't your average episode of ER. Something went down. I imagine that they're making sure it sticks or that I don't go postal. I would if I were them."
"So are you. Actually, I was thinking I should put out some kind of press release. Maybe it'll take the heat off of me when the press hears that the great and powerful Tony Stark cuddles." Steve grinned and grabbed some shampoo to return the favor washing Tony's hair. He was more excited about the sleep and cuddling than the getting clean, but they both definitely needed the shower. "Love your hair. I like it first thing in the morning, no gel or anything, just you. Always feels so good."
"No more drinks tonight," Steve countered, his arms snaking around Tony's back, and the space between them too small for him to want anything but to give in and kiss the man. "You can have one or the other, Tony. What'll it be?" he asked, voice a husky whisper as Steve fought to keep himself together. If Tony couldn't be bothered to at least treat it as something different from a random hook-up, it would be better to abstain. It would. Probably.
Clint nodded, still trembling but reassured by the fact that Phil was still there with him. "Just don't... don't throw yourself on a grenade for me, alright? I can live with him-" Clint's voice failed, and he took a breath. "I just don't want you getting hurt more for my sake." His voice had a stricken tremor to it, but he sounded certain nonetheless. "Just... just be here for me. I just need you to be here and be as okay as you can be." Phil had always been his anchor. Even before they'd actually met in person, the man's voice had been a reassurance when missions had gotten ugly, when he'd needed a place to hide and someone to talk him to the nearest safe house. There was certainly a reason he'd been drawn to sleep on Phil's couch whenever he'd had a rough day or a bad dream. Clint was pretty sure that if Coulson completely broke down, he wouldn't be far behind.
Understanding the consideration Tony was showing, Coulson nodded and rose, taking the helm on Tony's chair. The truth was he wasn't sure he wanted to leave the man alone to deal with whatever they would find down the hall. He met Clint's gaze briefly. "You and Natasha should get some rest. I'll let you know when we have more information or Steve is ready for more visitors."
Coulson reached out and grabbed for Scott's wrist, watching him flinch at the touch. He pushed the sleeve up and arched an eyebrow at the darkening bruises. "Logan would normally do this?" he asked quietly. It didn't take a verbal answer to know what Scott was thinking as he let go again. "You aren't in this alone, and we aren't looking for a reason to give Logan trouble. Agent Barton was compromised, but there aren't many people alive that I trust more. This isn't all or nothing. It just means we have things to watch for."
Phil entered a moment after Logan left. "That went about as well as I expected." He looked Clint over and found the Archer relatively unharmed. Clint looked shaken, and that was extreme enough of a reaction coming from him. "Let's get you somewhere to finish that nap. You deserve it."
"And how often do ya get takeout here?" Logan wanted to know. He felt suddenly protective of Steve. It seemed like a pretty terrible idea for the seemingly more traditionally-minded blonde to hook up with a guy who probably changed partners more often than he changed his underwear.
"Thanks," Clint said earnestly. He couldn't blame them. At all. If he'd been in Fury's shoes, in fact, Clint wasn't sure he'd even be roaming freely yet. "Glad it was you," he said, then felt himself blush. "I mean... I trust you. Still..." he took a deep breath, "pretty awkward, and it'll be awhile before I can make eye contact again, but... rather it was you than Hill or someone I barely know." He watched the monitor closely. It also felt pretty damn awkward snooping on Logan and Scott. He wasn't entirely sure he wanted the level of detail he had a feeling he was going to get.
"Maybe we could use a similar channeling technology as the Hydra weapons did. I'd need to talk it over with Tony, though. I'll need his input. He'll be up to helping, won't he?" Bruce asked Steve.
Logan found it tough to keep walking the right direction. He had to fight with himself to keep going. It wasn't like him to want to talk himself out of something. //Definitely somethin' wrong...// he reflected.
Phil nodded gratefully. "More than. Thank you, Professor Xavier. We'll leave you be, and I appreciate your indulgence. This isn't an easy situation for any of us."
Steve's eyes widened at the sight of the gash. "Tony!" He reached out, fingers brushing along the edge of the marred flesh. His eyes widened at the sight of the wound only to narrow as he looked back at Logan. "Not everybody here can heal as quickly as we can." Teeth grinding together it was all Steve could do not to yell, but he didn't want to make the situation worse than it already was. A leader needed to be calm. Losing his head wouldn't help - or at least not as much as he would have liked. It wouldn't undo the damage. Steve tore his gaze away from Logan to fix on Tony. "Does it hurt much? I hate to say it, but stitches would probably be a good idea."
"No. If Fury is as thorough as usual, he won't be hurting anyone at all," Phil agreed with a heavy sigh. He nodded toward the hammer. "You okay if we drop that off with R&D? They're going to want to check it out after all this. We haven't seen what the readings do once it's been in use this long, and Simmons is going to want to have every conceivable bit of biofeedback from you she can get her hands on." The hope that Clint might give it up willingly if it sounded like a routine drop was a slim one but worth trying out just the same. "I'm sure Stark and Rogers will be doing a check in there too." Simmons would be like a kid on Christmas morning with so much data to sift through and Tony back to boot.
"Thanks for noticing," Tony replied, flashing Steve a half-grin. "You don't look so bad yourself there, Cap." One hand let go of the wheel to reach across and give a gentle tug to the other man's lapel. "As a matter of fact, you clean up nicely. You should go with this look more often." Returning his attention to the road ahead, Tony smiled to himself over the way Steve flushed. Being able to get to him so easily was turning out to be Tony's favorite pastime. Sparks had flown from the instant they'd met, which tended to happen when two alpha males vied for seniority. No doubt S.H.E.I.L.D. would rope them into duty again, so it was probably for the best that he and Steve found some common ground.
“And you’ll get better.” They were making more progress than he’d honestly hoped to have made so early in the process. It boded well for finding a way to put the attacks off altogether. It seemed that they were brought on as much by stress as anything. It wasn’t as simple as a few words. The conditioning combined with what he suspected was a deep dose of PTSD had created a more complex web of issues. “We’ll keep working on it until you are. For now, would you like me to see if they’ve got something in pill form to help you sleep?”
"Even at the lowest output, this gun... If you have to use it, it'll kill you. You might be able to take Loki out with it, but you wouldn't be coming home." Before Tony could tout his stunt in New York or raise any other objections, Bruce gave him a level stare. "This isn't just you now, and you know it. Think of Steve. Think of how you felt when you thought you'd lost him. And think of how he'd feel."
Phil rolled his eyes and tried not to blush. He'd been terrified the second after he said it that even as a joke it might be too much, might smack of too much commitment too fast. Instead Clint seemed pretty damned pleased with it all even as a vague idea, and Phil let himself breathe again. "That might be a bit premature since I'm fairly certain that getting any ink would still be frowned on." Though their seat wasn't as close as before, a few intimidating stares managed to get them another tree. Phil happily took his post on the ground. It felt like coming home when Clint resumed his spot close up again. "Right now I just want the real thing."
"Inside, ma'am. Please," Steve added. He let Fury lead the charge back inside. The stares that met them on the way in were in equal parts shock and blank awe. Certainly Sif had the presence to inspire both. She was terrifying but also striking.
The unmistakable sound of Fury's purposeful footfalls hit them first, the man himself appearing soon enough. "Gentlemen, Logan's back. He said Romanov is safe, but Loki isn't planning to let her go just yet."
"Good," Logan murmured, his hand moving from Scott's hair to Natasha's thigh, his fingers trailing along the crease before he gently pulled her outer lips aside to give Scott's questing tongue better access. Feeling the woman's body shift against him, listening to her breath catch, was making him hot as hell. He ground his hardening cock against her ass, letting out a moan that sounded more like a growl as he felt Scott's tongue brush against his fingers. He nipped hard at Natasha's shoulder as if to vent some of his rising lust, his eyes fixed on the show before him as he held the woman tight against him.
"No killing people this close to the tower. I'm going to be telling Fury I'm not ready for active duty in the next couple of days on top of him maybe losing his team leader. I don't want to get in trouble because you skewered any idiots." Scott was willing to allow that some idiots absolutely deserved to be skewered, he just wasn't willing to take the fall for their stupidity. "That said, it might be nice stress relief leaving somebody with a reminder to not bother others if anyone is rude. Something subtle like a fractured jaw."
Scott whimpered, his fingers tearing into the comforter. "Fuck, Logan, harder... harder..." It hurt, but it was a good kind of hurt, the kind that would leave hidden bruises that would remind him while they were apart of what he was missing. The kind of bruises he'd never needed or wanted before. Scott relished the way Logan's cock seemed to tear him open with every harsh thrust. He never wanted it to end, but already Scott felt the tremors that meant he'd be cumming any second.
Phil woke immediately at the slightest motion from Clint. He tensed and then relaxed. He was still lying by Clint's side, and he could see the tangle of Natasha's hair against Clint's other shoulder. He shifted just enough to kiss Clint's cheek. "Morning." Even if they did have to go be heroes all too soon, for the moment they were curled up in bed. It was just them. Well, the three of the, but he didn't exactly consider Natasha an intrusive presence. "You ready?"
"I am disappointed by the lack of Brittany Spears," Clint deadpanned. He managed to hold out for a few seconds when Coulson looked at him like he'd just confessed to having a crush on Loki, then grinned a little. "Nope, can't do it. Can't even pretend that I'm serious." He sighed. "Well, no need for this anymore." He shucked off his glove and forearm guard, tossing them in his bag before unzipping his vest most of the way. "Cooler than some armor I've worn, but still too damn hot."
"No problem," Tony replied airily. He squeezed both of Steve's shoulders as he straightened again, behaving as if the sexual tension in the room wasn't stifling. "Like I said, you'll get the hang of it in no time." Tony smiled, adding, "It can become a little addictive at first, but, no worries, I'm always here to stage an intervention."  Helping Steve meant a lot less teasing on Tony's part, but he couldn't help feeling a sense of pride knowing he would be such a big part of Steve's new life.
The doctor nodded more confidently. "We're going to make sure that he's stable and then... and then we'll see about getting him settled into a room for visitation. I need to get back in there."
"Hey, I offered to wait outside in a tree," Clint pointed out as he hooked up his seatbelt. "You're the one that decided I should actually talk to people. Besides. Had my brain melted once. Starting feel like I can deal with it."
Tony glanced back at Loki for a moment as if trying to reassure himself that he wasn't losing his mind. The god still looked miserable, broken, everything but dangerous, really, which wasn’t the same as him being safe. His gaze drifted back to Steve. "He's a cocky, self-centered asshole that doesn't play well with others, and he's smarter than the average person on his planet." He raised an eyebrow and smirked faintly. "Sound familiar?"
Phil watched the blush creep up over Clint's cheeks and suddenly felt far less certain than he had two seconds before about Clint not having meant that nearly the way it sounded. Because Clint Barton was not attracted to him. Couldn't be, really. The world wasn't that strange a place. "I am capable of relaxing," Phil assured him in a neutral tone instead of thinking too hard about it. "I did yesterday morning." The time spent out and about with Clint was actually his favorite recent memory. He'd felt more at ease and more himself than he had in a long time.
"You don't," Phil countered, "the hammer does. You may be kind of a dick sometimes, Barton, but you're not a psycho." He hoped that a little of their usual banter would help keep Clint's head at least partly in the game. "Right now you're in a bad place." He glanced across at Natasha, and it took only a second of unspoken communication for them to be on the same page. "We're here to make sure you don't stay there. And to make sure you point that," he nodded down at the hammer, "at the right people."
"I agree. Hopefully Director Fury will too." Phil was more comfortable with that idea as the moments passed. If Fury wanted to dress him down it would happen, but Phil had no illusions that the files he had passed on from Xavier had left the man anything but annoyed. Phil preferred annoyance to the team being at a disadvantage. "I'm sorry that there wasn't time to talk with the two of you first."
"You can have the phone if you want it," the woman answered, holding out her cell instead of the store phone. At his raised eyebrow, she shrugged, "Dude, I barely want to touch that thing. If you knew the manager, you wouldn't want to either."
Scott didn't really care how they looked. He enjoyed swaying to the music with his arms slung around Logan's neck and their bodies indecently close. The rest was details.
"Which is why we're going to keep working until we find something that doesn't risk killing a team member," Tony growled from his wheelchair.
Tony moaned, letting one of his hands gently fondle Steve's balls before his fingers wandered southward. One digit slowly worked its way into the blonde, finding that perfect spot inside him and crooking against it. He sucked Steve’s cock as deep into his throat as he could and moaned, eager to taste his lover's release.
"I like it." Clint gracefully rose to his feet and offered a hand to pull Phil up with him. "You know, assuming you're alright standing up," he teased as he tugged Phil to his feet. He let Phil lead the way, trying to play off the fact that one of his feet had fallen asleep as well. He hooked an arm in Phil's as they walked, unable to keep from smiling faintly at how pleasant the whole thing was. "I think you officially chose well. The date, I mean. This was... is... fun. And I could sure as hell use a cup of coffee right before bed. Because I don't know how to act like a grownup."
"Got me," Steve murmured, finally shifting his hips, silently encouraging the man to move. He was adjusted - or at least close enough to adjusted - and impatience was quickly setting in. The look of intent lust in Logan's eyes promised that the best was yet to come, and Steve didn't want to wait anymore. A flicker of movement to his side drew Steve's gaze back to Tony. He focused in on the man's hardening cock for a second before looking up into Tony's dark eyes with a teasing smile. "I can help with that," he offered, voice a few notches deeper than normal.
"We'll figure it out," Logan assured, pulling Scott close for a quick kiss. "Just, right now, I don't think it's a great idea to tell 'em how you got your powers under control. Considerin' Loki managed to hijack Barton's brain at one time, I don't think they'd like the idea that he's been rummaging around in yours. And Barton's already got it in his head that Loki's callin' the shots on me."
Tony had the decency to blush at that, though it really made no sense, considering the circumstances. And considering the fact that he wasn't typically the shy sort. "Yeah, guess nothing but a towel might be a little awkward," he agreed, casting about until he found his discarded pants. He tugged them on, his eyes grazing over Loki as the god dressed himself. He sure as hell looked better without - //Stop it. Stop. Jesus.// He felt his cheeks flush a little more and covered for it by searching for his shirt. "And they might really wonder about your sanity if they find you running around buck naked."
Clint glanced at Phil with a resigned smile, letting the man sit before subtly edging a chair of his own closer to Phil than was strictly professional and settling in it. He didn't hesitate to press his thigh against Coulson's, leaning a little closer to him as well. "Thanks, Steve," he said, feeling a little uncomfortable as Logan eyed him and remembering that the mutant's senses could probably tell him things Clint didn't want him to know.
Steve nodded his agreement, but it didn't do anything to ease the knot in his stomach at the sight of the EMTs checking Tony out and putting an oxygen mask over his mouth.
At the pronouncement, Phil found himself wondering if he might not just let Clint carry through with his threat, crowd be damned because he's wondered about that. With Natasha, Clint has always seemed to take a submissive role, and yet Phil had never seen something like it with a man. It suddenly made perfect sense. The hard line in the sand had absolutely nothing to do with gender and absolutely everything to do with trust, and he felt like an idiot for not putting that together. Phil returned the soft kiss and couldn't help smiling. "Not that I wouldn't be okay with things the other way around too," he assured firmly, "but I'm glad. When the time's right and we're ready and you're comfortable with it, I would really like to make love to you."
"I'm fine," Tony said, standing and heading for the bathroom. He would have liked a shower but figured that getting the injury wet probably wouldn't help, so he took a washcloth to the funkier parts of himself. "I'll go get this stitched up. You guys relax."
Coulson steeled himself, ready for the rejection before he even heard it. He knew that he and Clint weren't alike. They were very different people, and even if there was an obvious mutual attraction and they did have a good time together, it was assuming a lot to think Clint might have even the vaguest interest in spending social time with him as more than friends. "If you wanted to come back to my room tonight, that would be nice," he managed, barely able to meet Clint's gaze as he put the offer forward. "Even if you just want a cup of coffee, I just... I'd enjoy that."
Natasha patted Clint's back. "It has been a long few days," she allowed. The words of sympathy didn't stop her from snickering as she sipped at her vodka. She'd ordered the good stuff. Thanks to her years of service and the fact that living at Stark's tower was cheaper than having a place of her own, she could afford it. "I second Scott's vote, personally. A little drinking, a little dancing - we need it." She leaned across Clint and waved Phil in so that he could hear her better. "Clint can't dance. Will you dance with me?"
Logan drank the issue down gladly, continuing to suck until Scott's moans sounded more pained than pleasant. He finally drew away, crawling up to press his lips to his lover's and enjoying the mingled taste of both their releases on his tongue. "You look good," he murmured, nuzzling Scott's throat, his cheek. The man was sweaty, flushed, his hair a proper mess, and more beautiful than ever.
"You are honestly amazing. Thank you." Steve tucked into the meal with relish despite the fact that he hadn't thought he was that hungry before Tony started cooking. "Do you think Logan will be willing to take that thing on again?" It was one thing risking your life for a lover or a teammate and another thing going up against a god for more nebulous purposes. "Even taking into account the idea of revenge, it's dangerous."
Steve ducked his head, smiling back and reaching for Tony's hand to give it a squeeze. "I can't help it. I like making you smile." Being with Tony felt better than he'd ever thought anything would again after his return from the ice. Coming back into the world had hurt like hell. He hadn't planned to say more, but sitting in bed sharing breakfast with Tony, the quiet, sweet moment between them... "I love you." Though he felt a flash of panic once the words were out, Steve didn't regret saying them. Quietly, he added, "I didn't plan that one. Sorry. I don't... I'm not looking for a reaction here. Just wanted to say it."
Clint nodded slowly, reaching up to stroke rough fingertips over Phil's cheek, wiping away the tears. "It's a date, then," he said, daring a small smile in spite of his ragged-sounding voice. He leaned up and stole another chaste kiss. It was reassuring, familiar, and reminded him not at all of what had just happened to him. "Swear to god, if they let me out of here and tell me we have no way to kill Loki, I'm stealing that hammer and turning him into chunky salsa by myself."
Scott let himself get lost in the kiss to distract from the new stretch. It wasn't painful, precisely, but it was strange, foreign. The insistent slide of Logan's tongue and the throbbing heat of his body kept Scott's mind appropriately sidetracked. He kissed Logan back with abandon, mind filled with thoughts of being even more intimately entwined.The questing fingers finally found their mark and Scott jolted off of the bed. "Do that again... please?"
"Understood." His finger was trembling as he quickly dials the first SHIELD contact he could think of.
Coulson shot Logan a dark look as he and Scott moved to the other side of the room, immediately protective of Clint. He had to fight the urge to tell the man off. Instead he sat down next to Clint and sat as close as was seemly to the other man in the hope of calming him. "That may be. If he is, we'll know soon. Right now that's not the most important thing. This isn't about security, it's about Natasha." It was a little bit about both, but deep down Coulson knew which part meant more to Clint.
"I'll do everything I can," Tony assured, his voice shaking. Tony Stark didn't cry. He almost never even felt sad. At least, that was what he kept telling himself as a few tears rolled down his cheek and splashed on Steve's shoulder as he held his lover close. "Love you," he whispered, wiping his face as quickly as possible as he drew away. He offered Steve a wan smile as he forced himself to head for the door. "I'll see you later."
Scott jumped in surprise, but the motion did nothing to dislodge the fingers from his temples. A flash of something uncomfortable but not precisely painful seared through his mind.
The tease was almost too much. Steve wondered how the hell Tony managed to get him so worked up with so little effort. The man could breathe and get his pulse soaring. "Th-that could work too," he agreed eagerly. They both knew Tony could take whatever he wanted any time he wanted it and Steve wouldn't stand in his way. They held that power over one another. Taking somebody to bed was one thing, letting them see you raw and naked in more ways than the physical was another thing altogether, and Steve was desperately grateful for the level of trust they’d found. "F-fuck, Tony, please, I need it... need you to... I need you inside me, please."
Coulson smiled his thanks for the levity and then started down the hall with the doctor leading the way. He always hated visiting a friend in the hospital, but he hadn't felt such a twist of fear and worry associated with a visit since he was a teenager and his father had a heart attack. //He recovered,// Phil reminded himself firmly. Steve had a few advantages over his dad if his body could get back to its usual working order.
Scott's stomach was twisted in knots. He wanted to fly off the handle and hit someone, but he'd spent long enough keeping such impulses in control that it was second nature. "So where do we start?"
Tony grinned, relieved that Steve was handling the loss of the serum so well. Shifting off of his lover, he immediately tugged Steve along with him. "Love you, too, by the way," he said, settling into the sheets. "You... seriously, though. I don't think I remember having had an orgasm that intense. Then again, it could just be all the brain cells I just lost."
Tony poked at one of the files, brow furrowed as he paged through its contents. "Yeah, speaking of Thor, where is he? Shouldn't he already be here to put the little shit in time-out?"
They were well settled at a table in the cafeteria, Sif utterly oblivious to the stares of those around them, before Steve joined them. Though he still looked bruised and tired, it was easy to see that Simmons' formula was working. He had lost some of the painful thinness and had gained at least a few inches of height over the course of the past day. "Sorry. Just wanted to get cleaned up. And have the bots help me out of that thing without an audience. It's not a graceful show just yet."
"Captain Rogers..." The doctor seemed to still be sorting through his own thoughts, how to present the information, and began again, "He's unconscious. We have him hooked up to fluids and oxygen right now. We aren't certain he can breathe unassisted yet."
Scott laughed at that. "I look like a mess. So do you. I like it." He dragged Logan into a sloppy, lazy kiss. "Let's go to bed." The idea of curling up next to Logan and getting some well deserved rest sounded like heaven after the hellish days and weeks. "I honest to god can't think of anywhere I'd rather be."
Steve rose gratefully when Tony entered the room. The genius looked tense but not panicked, so Steve knew they had a little more time. "We clear to head upstairs?" he asked, hopeful, fingers already itching to touch every bit of Tony. He wanted to get so wrapped up in the man that he couldn't even remember Loki existed, let alone posed any kind of threat to them.
"I try to be sociable," Steve answered. It took everything he'd learned touring as a useless figurehead to keep his "company smile" on and not look as rattled as he felt. That Tony Stark of all people affected him so much was a trial. He nodded toward the glasses in Tony's hand. "One for your date? I didn't see Pepper." He was fishing - and rather obviously so - but if he was honest with himself, Steve had wondered where things stood as soon as he watched Tony drive off with Bruce. They'd all gone their separate ways, and Tony and Bruce... it had seemed like there was something there, something that had left him itching to pick a fight in a way he hadn't experienced in a long time.
"If we do, you have to promise to stop being so damned irresistible." Tony wore his best poker face. He found it difficult to maintain what with Steve's infectious smile making him feel like a giddy teenager. "You make it difficult to think about anything besides you." Tony cracked a grin, unable to suppress the desire for long. "I would like to think my magnetic presence and blinding good looks has kept you in a similar state."
Phil's jaw clenched momentarily, but no other outward sign betrayed how much it hurt to think about Audrey. "She doesn't know I'm alive." The smile that followed the words was bitter, not warm. "I'm not exaggerating. She literally doesn't know. It... she had moved even before the incident with Loki. After, she was at the funeral... she... she'd moved on. She had closure. Our shelf life as agents isn't great. There was no point in telling her just so that I could get myself killed all over again." By the time he finished speaking, Phil's hands were clenching the wheel tight even as he fought to keep his tone neutral.
"This is a good place to start," Tony decided, picking up a copy of Entertainment Weekly off the coffee table. "We'll get you a subscription and you can keep up on the ever changing face of pop culture." He flopped down on the sofa, propping his feet up as he continued to regard Steve thoughtfully. There was a great deal about the other man he didn't know. Personal things. And Tony wondered how willing Steve would be to open up to him. "Have you dated any since you were unthawed?" Blunt and direct had always been Tony Stark's style. "Any one special you might be interested in, Cap?"
Finally Phil had to break off. He needed air, and he needed to see Clint's face flushed and open. He actually looked relaxed for once, and it was gorgeous. If they were going to keep from mauling each other in the middle of a public event, he knew they needed to take a break. Between Clint's body settled in against his own and his lips tingling from the kiss, Phil's control was hanging on by a thread. "I can't tell if you're a terrible influence or a wonderful one." He paused. "I think I like it either way." The heat thrumming through him had very little to do with the sunlight filtering down through the trees leaves and everything to do with Clint.
Fitz wasn't far behind. "A lot of it's vintage Hydra, and since the gun worked out so fantastically, we-"
Scott snickered and then shrugged. "I think we could use it after the last few... years." He drank his beer faster than normal and then ordered another round for the table. He clinked his glass against Natasha's when she held out hers in thanks.
"Well, sorry I missed you in the big one, then," Steve answered with a hint of a smile before sighing as Tony twisted the cap off a bottle of whiskey. His first instinct was to reach out and grab it away from the man, but he knew that would stop Tony for a few moments at best. "Might be nice not being the oldest guy in the room for once." They were obviously very, very different people, but Steve genuinely felt that they could connect. They had more in common than he did with most of the Avengers, honestly, and somehow he'd managed to find common ground with them. "Where are you staying? I should probably get him away from the bar soon if I don't want to carry him out of here. Tony? Ease up for a second, would ya?"
It had taken a long time, but Tony had finally drifted back off. His mind remained plagued with worry long after Steve's departure. What was the purpose of the attack? To kill him? No, there had to be more to it than that. Tony's mind remained trapped in its restless state until the drugs kicked in and lulled him to sleep. Being a light sleeper even when drugged, however, Tony awakened to Steve's gentle knocking. "Hmm? Yeah..." He glanced up, blinking rapidly. "Come in... what happened?"
Loki gave the faintest nod, shifting against the man as he kissed Tony almost gently. There wasn't any affection in the way he treated the man, but mutual desire was just as good sometimes. For once he could simply savor the contact with no bruises or wounds to nurse later - not that he minded them. He rather enjoyed them sometimes, but there were moments where he wished for something soft and a bit less harsh, and it seemed that Tony Stark of all people was willing to offer that. "I won't break," he whispered against Tony's lips. Loki followed the words by licking his way back into Tony's mouth and swallowing the soft moans that escaped the mortal.
Clint was busy smacking his forehead. //It was a bluff...// He grimaced a little before tuning in to Nat's words. He frowned at her assessment of Coulson's date. "So you're trying to say I'm way sexier than anything he's ever picked up," he deadpanned, the faintest hint of humor in his eyes. He shifted uneasily a moment later, wondering why they were still going down this rabbit hole when he wasn't that invested in the idea. "Don't you think he's a little old for me? And that it's a little weird considering he watched everything that happened in my bedroom for, like, six months? I mean, not that I'm not for transparency in a relationship, but... I can't imagine that being anything but painfully uncomfortable."
Darien silently praised whatever gods might be listening for Clint's calloused hands hot and urgent on his cock. It was sexy as hell to watch Clint watching him. The guy had a predatory intensity mixed with a bizarrely flippant sense of humor. It all got wrapped up together to be beyond hot. He wished that the previous day's activity hadn't left him too sore to beg to be fucked properly, but that would have hurt like hell and not been particularly fun. Maybe another day, Darien thought hopefully. He was all for having a few good fuck buddies on the team given that most of his new companions looked like they'd stepped out of an underwear catalog. "Not gonna take much... watching you fuck my mouth was too sexy. You look so damn hot when you cum, Clint..."
Tony drew back in surprise. This was not how he'd imagined things would go. His analytical mind did not allow for errors, and Steve's actions threw the proverbial wrench into the works. It took Tony a moment to gather his thoughts, to process what had just happened. "What are you doing?" he asked softly. "I was chained down, drugged, and being fucked by your presumed dead best friend. And all the time I wanted it to be you." Tony shook his head in disbelief, even as his lips tingled from the kiss. "Why did you do that?"
Phil smirked. "Sometimes. What did you think the missions were really for?" He watched Clint prepping the carrots and found himself musing that domestic looked good on the man. It looked right. //Dangerous train of thought. Very dangerous.// He was willing to admit that perhaps he'd been Clint's handler for too long. They were used to each other. They were close. He honestly considered Clint a friend even if he wasn't sure that the sentiment was returned. "I don't mind having you around."
He was admittedly a little late. Okay, a lot late. Like, twenty minutes. //He's gonna be grumpy,// Tony reflected as he struggled to arrange his tie and hustle to their meeting spot all at the same time.
Clint nodded his agreement. "Got that right." He wanted to go back and check on Nat again, but he still wasn't in the mood to deal with handcuffs again. Instead, he focused on Phil. "Maybe we could find another distraction?" he suggested. He let the question dangle for an awkwardly long moment as he thought. "Maybe a stupid movie or go karts or something? I mean, I'm sure Fury won't want us getting too far from the tower, but if I don't get something to do soon, I'm going to be at the range until I run out of fletching."
Logan opened his mouth to tell Loki how much he thought of that idea when he found himself back at the Avengers headquarters. Right outside his own door, no less. Deciding that everyone else could wait, he shoved open the door and rushed inside, "Scott?" He wanted to see the man, assure himself that Loki hadn’t hurt him.
Steve shared a smile and a shrug of his shoulders with Bruce. It was hopeless to think that Clint would ever catch up on his own. The man relied almost entirely on Coulson to distill whatever they learned to him. Which, Steve supposed, was fine so long as Coulson was with them. "Agent May, it's good to have a chance to work with you."
The offer and the idea in general was something Scott hadn't ever thought about. Jean hadn't been particularly adventurous when it came to sex, and he'd learned to modulate his requests accordingly. Maybe it was the alcohol talking, but for some reason it didn't sound like a terrible idea. "I don't think I'd hate that."
Though Fitz shrunk back from the idea of another confrontation with Stark, Simmons' drew herself up to full height - not very impressive given that Steve would have towered over her even after the gun took its toll - and assured him, "Mr. Stark, we are fully qualified to be here. While we may lack some of the experience that you and Dr. Banner share, we graduated top of-"
Steve offered the other man a warm smile despite the fact that he'd somehow ended up Tony's bellhop again. "Follow me. We'll have you set up in no time." Without really giving Logan a chance to refuse, Steve led the way to the elevator. It was spacious enough for all of them to fit with room to spare on the way down, though Phil remained behind to go down to the meeting rooms while Steve, Logan and Tony disembarked to get comfortable. "There's an open suite down the hall from mine if that's alright."
"Perfection," Steve agreed, referring as much to the kiss as the dinner suggestion. He leaned against the counter while Tony cooked and savored the casual moment. They had precious few of them. "I'm glad they let you slip away for awhile. Not to be way too creepy and clingy, but I don't know if I could've done a whole night without seeing you. The potential for really great sex aside... well, I just kinda want to be with you right now."
"Glad to hear it," Natasha purred, already moving her hips against Scott's cock and Logan's hand to remind them both what they had to look forward to. "Let's make sure everyone's as ready for the main event as Scott here is." It didn't surprise her that he was hard as a rock. Good as he was at going down on a girl, she'd pretty much expected him to get something out of it.
He groaned at the reminder of her presence and managed, "I want... Logan, I want you to fuck me until I cum, please..."
"Sir, Director Fury was very specific. You're benched," the woman replied. Though the blond would have barely cleared Tony's shoulder standing, her expression brooked no protest.
"There wasn't another option. Once you started to relax, to be you? It was nice, an asset with a sense of humor. It's surprisingly difficult to find." Long missions were hellish. Deep cover was painful to navigate. Clint Barton's wisecracking and easy smiles had been a breath of fresh air. The first time Phil heard him make a completely serious-sounding, completely bitchy comment to Fury himself, he'd been sold. "I had several different assets before you and before Natasha, but once it was you two... it fits. We fit. At least I think so," Phil added, flashing Clint a smile as he poured the egg into a pan. "That's rare, and I don't intend to let anyone disturb the balance."
They stayed focused and relatively quiet until Logan finally came by in response to a text from Bruce. They all presented the situation to him, then Tony gave him a hopeful look.
It was a hell of a show, and one Logan had guessed rightly that Natasha appreciated. She'd always enjoyed watching Clint take control of his lovers, and it wasn't any different seeing Logan working Scott up. The two of them were fucking beautiful together. "Oh, I'm definitely okay with winging it. Tell me, Logan, that pretty mouth of his... is it as talented as it looks?"
"Thanks for the plane," Steve said simply as they boarded. He strapped Tony into a stretcher along the center aisle carefully before taking a seat. "We'll be home soon." Once again Loki had gotten the jump on them, and two of his team were missing and his boyfriend was bleeding on the floor of the plane. Steve honestly hated being strapped in when he would have preferred to sit on the floor holding the man's hand, but there was no point not setting a good example when he couldn't do anything for Tony until they were back anyway. "Have a doctor and some blood ready for Tony."
He led her slowly toward the cafeteria. "You'll haveta forgive us. The team's hurtin' all over right now," he explained.
Scott let out an unconscious groan at the prompt, his hips moving desperately against Logan's hand. He supposed it was true. He'd heard plenty of repulsive things hissed at him while he was in the hands of the slavers, but that had been something different. It had all been about power and fear. This was about giving himself up and trusting Logan completely. There was no real comparison. "Yeah," he gasped, "j-just for you... just for you, baby."
The question was pointed, valid, and something Scott had no idea how to answer. His buzz was edging into full inebriation. "Well, I sort of already joined a team of superheroes, so I can't do that differently." Scott considered his options and finally looked levelly at Logan - at least as much as someone who was finding focusing on one spot steadily could - and asked, "Know any guys who are looking to have some fun?"
"Great." Logan scowled. "He's gonna be real forthcomin' with that information, considerin' we'd be plannin' to turn him into a pancake right after we got the answer."
The whole thing was starting to seem like a bad idea. Darien appreciated getting out, and the beer was actually pretty good considering the way the place looked, but he was getting decidedly uneasy about the men circling them. He wasn't sure whether they wanted to drag him or Clint back to the bathroom for a quickie, but their intentions weren't subtle. Finally a guy threw himself down on the stool next to Darien and leered at him with a mouth full of half-rotted teeth. "Hey, pretty, you wanna spend some time with a real man?"
Clint's blue eyes strayed to the deadly blades, and even he had to allow himself raised eyebrows. "I'm good." He fixed his gaze on the distance again. "Thanks."
"I take what I said earlier back. I do hate you, Barton," Phil mumbled, trying hard not to make eye contact with anyone present. He caught the smirk on Natasha's face and raised a warning finger. "You will be doing long run ops in Siberia for the rest of the year."
Steve knew he needed to start things off with the only thing he had to present that was positive. "We have one piece of good news." He knew his voice sounded rough, and describing anything as "good" made him feel physically ill. "Fitz-Simmons managed - with Dr. Banner's help - to find a way to reactivate the serum." He met the uncertain stares from most of the group. "It's not a quick thing like last time. This could take days or even weeks. That said, if we find a direction that someone can point us in, I'm going."
"...but you're about the only thing that can slow Loki down enough that I feel like we can hand Logan that evil raygun of Stark's and have a chance of shooting him."
"I feel like... a chandelier... just fell... on me," Tony groaned sarcastically. He managed a quick glance at the broken crystal glittering around him, but sighing at the expense of replacing the expensive decor only hurt his aching chest. Swallowing hard, Tony couldn't help noticing how attached Steve had become to his hand. Despite his injuries, he felt a warm sensation of comfort rushing through him. "Did you... see what... happened?" he wheezed. "I thought... I heard a shot... from a high powered... rifle."
Logan raised an eyebrow that implied a whole boatload of "don't fuck with me" but only smirked a little. For all the shit that had gone down, he liked Clint. If Scott could be relaxed about the situation, he could be too. Probably.
Seeming to sense Scott's worry, Logan did his best to make the kiss as distracting as possible. They both needed it, and he was more than happy to make sure they got what they needed. As his tongue stroked along Scott's, he began thrusting, matching the pace to the motion of his tongue. "Love you, darlin'," he whispered, his fingers carding through sweat-damp hair as he moved inside his lover.
Though it physically hurt to say it, Phil sighed and promised, "I won't do anything purposefully. Protecting you is kind of my hobby, though, in case you haven't noticed. It's hard to turn off." He continued stroking Clint's hair, willing the man to calm himself, to breathe, to let it go for a moment. He needed to relax. They both did. They needed to block it out. When they got back, they could fall apart and talk to a shrink and hide from the world, do whatever they needed to do to really process it. In the meantime, Phil intended to keep Clint plastered against his side as much as possible and try to pretend they were safe. "Just be right here, right now. Right now, you're with me. In this moment, you're safe, and I'm here."
Tony held out his hand for the mug, then put it aside on the nearby table when Steve handed it to him. He grabbed the blonde by his lapel and dragged him into a long, gentle kiss, drawing away with a smile. "'Boyfriend.' I like that," he murmured, hesitating a moment before letting Steve go completely. What he really wanted was to curl up against the muscular blonde and stay there all day. Feeling that was a bit more than he should say at that particular moment, he instead grabbed Steve's coffee cup and finished off what was left in it. "Yeah. Yeah, you were right. Terrible," he said grimacing as he handed his lover the empty mug.
Natasha's voice came back from the cockpit, "Almost there." Fury had sent Agent May along with them too, knowing that the more bodies they had the better. The two women had taken over the helm without a word. "Make sure you're locked and loaded, boys."
The archer smiled. Phil cooking for him had always been a comfort, he realized. Retrospectively, he was starting to realize that virtually every time he'd felt over stressed or insecure, he'd found an excuse to sleep on his handler's couch and at least have coffee in the morning with the other man. "I'd have to say yes to all of that," Clint decided, standing and finding his jeans. While he wasn't ready to put on anything else, he wasn't all about his thighs sticking to random pieces of furniture, either. "Especially bacon. And coffee." He eyed Phil's sleep pants a moment later, smirking and blushing all at once. "So, uh, you weren't kidding about the ones with little arrows all over them."
"It freaks me out a little when you smile like that," Clint said, though he had a small smile of his own to offer in return. In truth, Coulson's ability to manage people and find information was astonishing to Clint. The guy could find anything that could be found. Coulson had a way of getting info from people that rivaled Nat's, though his methods were usually more straightforward. "You don't have any mutant powers of your own, do you?"
Clint stood, too, unsure of what Scott's approach meant and not wanting to be taken by surprise. He'd seen what the man's powers could do; he didn't want to get caught off guard. "Loki has a way of getting to people," he allowed, feeling it'd be a little unfair to completely condemn the other man. "Good that you noticed it. You think we should maybe go to medical and get you looked over?"
"I think that's a definite yes. That sun's starting to get to me," Clint agreed, stopping at a stand to get them some bottled water before they found one of the few unoccupied trees. It was a bit further from the stage, but the music was more than loud enough to reach them, anyway. Clint hesitated a moment after they got settled, then leaned lightly against the other man. Phil smelled good, felt good, and the archer found himself melting into his handler without even really thinking about it. "Should've brought a blanket. But at least the grass is nice."
"All present and accounted for. Some bumps and bruises, but we're fine. So are the X-Men. A couple of them came to help us."
Logan took a shot and smirked. "I'm not sure if this is more unfair for you two, or for me." When you'd lived as long as Logan had, the list of things you'd never done was pretty goddamn short. But at least he didn't run the risk of actually getting drunk. "Alright. Not a lot o' things to work with for me. Let's see... I've never cross-dressed. That I remember."
"We find a way to kill him," Natasha said bluntly. "We've been using kid gloves, playing politics with Asgard, which is fine when Thor is with us, but if he is with us, he's got a strange way of showing it. I don't remember him showing up when his psychotic brother was running his fingers through my gray matter."
Logan finally managed to catch his breath and drew away, admiring the bruises already forming on Scott's skin. In the back of his mind, he knew he shouldn't have been enjoying them that much. But the marks made Scott his. The feral mutant sagged to the bed beside his lover, then grabbed Scott by the hair and jerked him into a bruising kiss.
Scott's eyes fell closed, and his back arched against Logan's mouth. It stung a bit being stretched open, but not nearly enough for him to want the man to stop. He pushed his hips back against the contact to illustrate wordlessly just how badly he wanted it. No matter what Loki had done, they'd figure out a way to get through it. Whatever Logan's failings, he was kinder and gentler than he ever wanted anyone to see.
In the absence of an eyeline on Bruce and with Steve stalking toward Mystique, Coulson grabbed a particularly threatening-looking gun from the shelf and moved in closer to Clint. "You should probably not touch that more than you have to. We don't know what it does, just that it’s bad. Which is not the kind of specific I like."
"Jesus!" The exclamation left Clint in a harsh breath as he watched Phil hurriedly swallow his cock down. The archer locked his knees, pressing himself into the wall to keep his legs from buckling. His fingers scrabbled at the cool wall behind him as if trying to gain purchase on his sanity, and Clint panted helplessly, thumping his head back against the wall and moaning, a long, low sound that seemed to vibrate through his whole being. He hadn't expected the eagerness. He sure as hell hadn't expected to see his cock disappear down Coulson's throat in one swift, sure motion.
"Only twelve? I think we could push to at least fifteen," Simmons murmured, though she wasn't really waiting for an answer. She'd drifted away from Tony to chatter excitedly with Fitz, who started plugging numbers into a program with apparent glee. Tony was most certainly a jerk. Tony also happened to be a genius. He'd invented things that gave them both intellectual boners all through school, and working alongside him was- well, it was terrible, but it was still an honor of a sort. "Should have something by later tonight. Or morning. It may depend on how long some of the compounds take to stabilize. Then there's seeing if it actually interacts with the hammer, of course, if the-" Simmons cut herself off. "You know that." She turned back to the screen without another word.
"We did have sex in the bed. We just happened to have a third party with us, to make sure it stayed kinky," Logan countered, nipping at Scott's throat. "We'll haveta mix it up sometime, though. Maybe we can do it on the kitchen table. Or I could tie ya to the bed post." While he gave Scott a moment to think about that, he worked to raise a hickey on the man's throat, his hand sliding more surely into Scott's boxers to wrap around his cock.
Logan froze, pressing into the kiss with passion to match Steve's. He wanted to simply pin the man down and wildly fuck him until they both lost their minds, but a sliver of rationality kept him in control enough to instead savor the intensity of the way Steve's passage clenched around him. He drew Steve's tongue into his mouth, sucking on it for a moment before thrusting his own tongue in to taste the other man more fully. "Need you," he growled as he broke away from the kiss, the words almost lost in the animalistic rumble of his voice. He began slowly pressed in deeper as if testing to see if Steve was ready for it.
Steve couldn't help laughing between kisses. "You romantic fool you. And people act like you don't have any idea how to seduce a guy and keep him seduced." He was giddy with relief at the realization that they were still right for each other no matter how he looked or how his body had changed. "Maybe we should see about that shower now. Been awhile since we had time to do that together. Then we'll get you to sleep. Not a euphemism," he cautioned. "You need to get some rest if you're going to get up and be brilliant again in a few hours."
Whether the computer picked up on the catch in his voice or just wanted to be prompt, Jarvis lit a path leading toward the back of the lab, to the section where Tony's suits were displayed. "Sir, if you would?"
Logan was a little less inclined to wax over the truth, though, "The Cap can't be gay - or bi - as far as those government suits are concerned. I mean, you're the Red, White, 'n' Blue incarnate. Blonde hair, blue eyes, devout Christian, non-drinking, non-smoking, non-dancing, goody-two-shoes representative o' the whole nation." He shrugged. "They're just pissed that they lost the last superhero that even the radical far right could get behind. You'll get used to it. I have. 'Course, I'm sure Tony's pet spin doctors can come up with somethin'...”
Phil barely managed to get his shoes and shirt off before he gave up and crawled into bed. He found himself quickly surrounded by Clint and murmured good night to the man as he tugged the blankets over them both. He wondered if he could have slept without Clint next to him and the wordless certainty that his lover was safe. He doubted it. Phil drifted off before he even had time to start worrying again. For once dreams blessedly eluded him, but Phil woke with a start. Late afternoon light streamed in through the windows, and he supposed he'd gotten a good five hours or so. He needed more, but there were other things going on.
Tony raised a skeptical eyebrow at the two. Bravado wasn't going to win him over\. With a deep breath, he managed to concentrate and pull the suit back in, going back to jeans and t-shirt. He grimaced and flexed his mouth. "Tastes like metal fillings," he murmured.
"Not much different in my experience, no," Phil agreed before tossing Clint a bag of salad. "There are croutons in that cabinet there. This way we can pretend that we're being healthy while we eat fettuccine alfredo." He watched Clint search sluggishly for bowls and couldn't help smiling. "As for you never leaving... in case you haven't noticed, I've been your handler for years. If I was trying to get rid of you, you'd be gone by now."
