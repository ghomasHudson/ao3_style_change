“But enough of that!” Sherlock was suddenly sitting upright. “I’m famished. Hard day’s work, rhino chases and all. I’m off to shower, then, before dinner. What are we having?”
anything!”
And without further attempts to coax or reason with him, they coerced: each seized an arm, and with their superior strength they wrangled John into the backseat, pinning him between them and commanding the driver to

“Not yet. I need your help to find them.”
“Not good. Not really. The Alpha pack, pretty sure the same one we’re hunting . . . they attacked someone else last night. A gesture to reassert their dominance more than anything, we believe.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock paced and fretted, disconcerted, not only because his imagination was running wild with what
“You have a choice, you cocks. Deliver my message, or I’ll tear you to pieces here and now just for
“I saw you, sitting alone on the train that day,” Sherlock continued, “and I can’t really explain it, but I felt . . . drawn to you. Like I already knew you, like we had been dear friends as children, or in another life altogether. It was like there was someone pushing at me from behind, urging me toward you. So I decided to talk to you, sit with you. Within minutes, I knew I wanted to share your next heat with you. And well, you said yes, so I did, and after, I never wanted to let you go.”
John started, like he’d been jolted with electricity. Or struck by lightning.
John marveled. There was a cultural element of oath and honor in this world that didn’t exist in his, and so much of it, he was slowly coming to see, began and ended with Alphas and Omegas. The beginning and end. It was a humbling thought.
“Um. Yes. All right. I’m on my way.”

One theoretician of quantum mechanics suggested that mirrors could serve as dimensional doorways linking one universe to its parallel, bridging the perceptional gap via vibrating strings of the quanta . . . but the article was so dense that neither man could make much sense of it. Then—
At the same time, the other John, who had launched for his own pad and pen, said:
“I’m okay, John. Really.”
When the police tried to get in, he threw a gurney at the door to stop them. When Sherlock and John tried to get in from the other side, he threw bags of blood: lynx, zebra, and ibex. Sherlock was an able dodger. John was not.
“Was it Alphas?” she asked, her voice quavering.
“Let me see your eyes.”

But more to the point:
“Just some, erm, follow-up questions, if you don’t mind.”
“Nice pun.”
“So, until your next, erm”—God, he hated saying the word—”heat?”
Sherlock scooted closer. A soft hand reached for his neck, the fingers brushing across the skin, and that’s when John noticed it, the bruising ache, the soreness of broken skin. It was where Sherlock had bitten him last night. He hadn’t remembered it being painful, though. Rather, it had been the shock of pleasure that had immediately tipped him over the edge.
pack? Blood and bond. You joined my pack when we bonded.”
John sighed. “The mirror. I guess . . . I guess I’ve been holding on to the foolish hope that, one day, somehow . . .”
“Mm,” Sherlock murmured, echoing his disappointment.
Sherlock was making some flippant salutation and reaching for the door handle, but Lestrade stepped in his way.
But John was halfway down the stairs and flat out ignored him.
Without sitting up—he was too exhausted at the moment to manage it—he fumbled with the top button of his trousers, and only then did he realize that they were

“Well, if it were me,” said Chris thoughtfully, “and I’d experienced something like that, I’d be keen to have it happen again, too. And I’m betting my alternate self would be just as eager. We’re the same person, after all. In a manner of speaking. So if you try to recreate the conditions, I’m betting he’s trying the same. Ask yourself honestly: what would
John faced out again. He closed his eyes. “I’m coming home, Sherlock,” he whispered.
Taking a deep breath, he said, “I was cornered. I was on my own, on a bus, and they saw a target. I managed to give them the slip, get myself out of there, but  . . .”

or whatever, and cross it off your list of three.” There was a beat of silence. “Which you should! Because it’s mad!”
When John was five, his father broke his arm. He was being a pain in the arse (Dad’s words, not his) and refused to go to bed. There was whining, crying, screaming, stomping—all on John’s part. Dad shut him up. He never complained about his bedtime again.
Just as John expected, Sherlock didn’t return that night. It was midnight, and the flat was quiet. John was ready.
“It’s philosophy. Speculation. Not science.”
“People are already forgetting what led to the dog fight in the first place.” John took a deep breath, preparing to tell a story he had not been a direct witness to, and yet was now an indelible part of his own history. “I was attacked. I was bitten and scented, and if I hadn’t fought my way free, I would have been forcibly knotted, too. It was that moment, Ms. Hill, that finally opened my eyes to the truth that Omegas are not safe in this country. It made me angry. And if it weren’t for that anger, I never would have entered the dog pen to begin with.”
me. In writing.”
His Alpha prowled around John in a tight circle, creating a protective barrier as he snarled at the Alphas that had backed off but still ringed them both. From where John watched from the grass, he seemed to have doubled in size, darkened in color, and though he kept his back to John to face their enemies, his posture was that of—John could think of no other way to describe it—a wolf. Fingers curled into claws at his side. Shoulders broadened by a curved back. Neck forward but head lifted, twitching from side to side as he stared threateningly at each Alpha in turn. And his voice was the deepest John had ever heard it.

, he thought, and was on the cusp of saying so, when Sherlock stepped on his first word.
” cried John, nearly dropping the weapon.
They looked deep into each other’s eyes without blinking. Then, they each spoke at once:
“No? You think I could really be that kind of man?”
The cold truth of it was, he had been hoping, just as Sherlock had believed himself, that there had been another case like theirs, that the
When John was eight, he missed half of the school year because Dad didn’t want teachers to comment on all of his bruises … and because of a handful of trips to A&E for a head wound, a dislocated shoulder, and an unexplained seizure. It was the same year the NSPCC made their first visit to the Watson household, following an anonymous tip that something was wrong with the children. But Dad kept an immaculate house, and they came at a time between beatings, when the bruises had already faded, Dad had run out of beers in the fridge, and Harry was in one of her rare good moods. They didn’t find anything, just a single father who cared for the wellbeing of his children. And when they left, Dad said he loved them both, and he was sorry for getting angry in the past, and it wouldn’t happen again.
“It’s late. Very late. You’ve not been watching telly. The remote control is where it was when I went off to bed. So what have you been doing in the meantime, eh? A little light reading?”

“Universes,” Sherlock corrected, “and
“Really?”
Here it came, the censure, some rubbish about sentiment and getting involved and succumbing to baser temptations that would override his mental circuitry. He’d heard the lecture before (granted, he was thirteen and Mycroft, at twenty, had just broken up with his first serious girlfriend at uni and was in a rather vulnerable but highly logical state), but it was wisdom to live by, and both had embraced the sound logic of it. Now, however, Sherlock wasn’t so sure.
“I said, stop.”
Suddenly, John surged forward and they were kissing. Passionately. Open mouthed and tongues as excited as a kid licking an ice cream cone, and hardly less messy. Heat spiked from Sherlock’s stomach and to his heart before flooding rapidly to his cock, which swelled with heaviness.
tired—he was just refusing to acknowledge it. All John had to do was, you know, help it along a little. And that left him with an idea.
He tried again. Whimpering, wriggling, he inserted a finger, but he was so damn nervous that he could do little more than that. This was futile. The aromas were futile. Sherlock would know something was wrong instantly. It wouldn’t take a genius. It wouldn’t even take an Alpha. He was all wrong, every bit of him.
“Ah! Yes. Thank you, sir, yes, very well, thank you.”
“It’s just one theory, but yeah, think about it. People all over the world talk about hearing footsteps in their house, but there’s no one on the stair. They hear people shouting or crying in the next room. Doors opening without cause, dogs playing with thin air, cats streaking out of the room, that feeling you’re not alone . . . Some people reckon it’s not the spirit world we’re rubbing shoulders with, but ourselves in a different dimension! And sometimes, we even catch images of people in other worlds in photographs. Children standing in darkened windows, an image of a woman caught in the mirror behind you . . . Just when the distance between us and them is the very thinnest, they come through. Like, maybe you saw your granddad walking in the garden, but that couldn’t be true because your granddad died last summer. Only, in another dimension, he didn’t. He’s alive and well. So what you
Charming, as always. He grit his teeth as he typed:
Right now.
“No, no, he didn’t. Say, what . . . what’s he doing?”
John gasped.
But apparently this was an unexpected response, because Lestrade slowed and looked at him with an air of uncertainty. Crap, he’d done something wrong.
They started striding toward the gate. Well, Sherlock strode. John took shorter, more rapid steps, looking sideways at Sherlock every few seconds, something of a half smile on his face and a strange light in his eyes.
“From someone who both cares about me and trusts me. Now
“What are you doing?” he asked, but this time, not out of irritation. He was calming, swiftly and fully, and he didn’t understand why.
“So is rape.”
Something stirred in Sherlock. “You’re surprisingly poetic, John,” he said, and with refreshed desire he reclaimed John’s mouth. John moaned into him, gripped him more fiercely, spread his knees and let Sherlock press more insistently against him.
Instead, Harry Watson arrived in the recovery ward, brandishing the same paper Molly had shown him at daybreak.
“That you’re suicidal.”
“Though the data may suffer,” Sherlock said under his breath. He went to the kitchen to grab a stool and placed it in the centre of the room. Mercifully, he didn’t comment on the closed curtains or bolted door, but he did turn on a few more lamps. “Right arm, then, to start.”
. He might as well have written,
Sherlock strode forward, grasped John’s head between two large hands, and started spinning like they were dancing.
He had questions for John Watson, many, many questions, and come morning, it was the very first thing he was going to ask.
“On what charge!” he demanded.
one-two, when suddenly
God, why was he being so delicate with his words? Be clinical, detached, just say it:
“I’m feeling better,” Molly said bravely. “Less pain. No more burning . . . down there. Doctors say I’m responding well to the hormone treatment. They won’t let me leave until they’re one hundred percent positive the bond has no more effect. Not much they can do about the mark other than let it heal, though. It’ll scar.”
“What? Oh! Right.” Sherlock snorted. “You have issues with modesty now. It’s nothing I haven’t seen before.”
Then, out of the blue, at the end of dinner one night—spaghetti and meatballs, Mrs. Hudson’s treat (she had a keen sense for when things were amiss in ol’ 221B, and food was always her solution)—John said while sopping up the last of his tomato sauce with a hunk of French bread:
“Jesus Christ.”
“No. Don’t—”
“You were supposed to be asleep.”
Her hand trailed down to his throat, popped the top button of his shirt, and pulled the collar aside to reveal the white scar of the bond mark on his neck. “And this will soon be mine.” Dragging her finger across its ridge, her voice dropped to a husky timbre. “All mine.”
From the sitting room where he sat in his chair with his phone in hand—to maintain the pretense that he was busy doing something productive—Sherlock watched John work, feeling an odd mixture of curiosity, captivation, and compulsion. That is, he couldn’t take his eyes off of John. Before this experiment had begun, before finding the pamphlets, he had genuine doubts about his own capacity for attraction of the nature that the majority of the human race suffered. Now he wondered if it were possible to turn off. It was quite vexing, this need to watch John’s every movement (how he worked with his hands, how he licked his lips, how he shifted his weight). It was rather galling, his inexplicable urge to touch John’s hair, hands, face, arms, back. It was insufferably agonizing, thinking he would never get the chance, or that his attempt would be rebuffed.
Slowly, he lowered the gun and looked to Sherlock for evaluation.
“All right there, Mr. Holmes, let’s have a chat.”
John tried to hide his smile behind pursed lips, but he nodded eagerly.
He blinked. Dr. Stapleton came even closer, and transferred her hushing finger to his own frowning lips.
“The dark blue v-neck jumper,” he said quickly, before John disappeared from the sitting room, headed for the upstairs bedroom. John paused and looked back. Fighting against the prickly sensation of discomfort, he pressed on and completed his thought. “You’ve always looked smashing in it. Good color on you.”
Standing stock still, refusing to meet John’s eyes even through the reflection, Sherlock asked in a monotone, “Third question. Where did you and I first meet?”
“For fuck’s sake, what are you
to be. But.
He squeaked a little in his throat. “Hold it together, Watson,” he murmured under his breath. “You’ll figure something out.”
“Baker Street,” he said. “Sorry about the wet.”
“Then let me show you that I adore every inch of you.”

, not in your mind, you thought you were knotting
“I saw him, Sherlock!”
He must have been hauling ass, if he thought he could make it from Baker Street to the middle of Regent’s, or rather, Marylebone Park, in three minutes. Even if he could, John doubted he
“Way to look after our Molly, John, lad. That’s giving them the what-for.”
At the next stoplight, still several streets away from the hospital, he panicked. He threw open the door and ran.
“It was a twenty-year-old case! I didn’t see the point! What Mr. Knight really needed was therapy, and I am not a therapist. Are you going to tell me that he was murdered, too?”
Sherlock's and John’s mouths fell open, but neither could find words.
And here he came again, walking down the deserted pavement with hands balled at his sides and back rigid—John was angry, and his gait showed it. But then, he’d appeared angry in
By the time he had descended the stairs and reached the sitting room, only seconds later, sleep had fled entirely. The flat was quiet, but not because Sherlock was still in bed. If he had ever gone to bed, that was. It was because he had already left. A sticky note was left behind on John’s laptop:
“What you hear behind me is the rallying cry of an Omega rights movement that seems to have sprung up overnight,” said the Beta reporter into the camera. “And it’s not just Nothing Knotters, as you might expect. They’re everyone, from everywhere, Alpha, Beta, and Omega alike, all spurred on by the question, ‘What happened to Omega John Watson?’”
For the second night in a row, John retired to bed upset: the scent was as sharp as a needle up Sherlock’s nose. This time, it wasn’t such a mystery: how could he not be upset, after such a terrifying ordeal? And Sherlock’s comfort-instinct was still going strong. John didn’t seem to want to turn in, but Sherlock could see how tired he was, how heavy his eyelids and sluggish his body, so he coaxed him back to the bedroom. There, he saw John pause at the end of the bed and stare at it like it was crawling with cockroaches. But he pulled back the sheets and crawled in anyway, lying curled on his side near the edge of the mattress, as before. And when Sherlock reached for him, intending to hold and calm him, John flinched.
Sherlock frowned in annoyance. “I just
John opened his eyes. “I don’t,” he said, astounded.
“Do you engage in penetrative sex?”

He was sitting in his armchair, reading the paper without really reading it, when he yawned. A few seconds later, quite by accident, Sherlock yawned, too.
“That’s my question.”
“What happened?”
“Brilliant, just absolutely, remarkably, utterlyandcompletely brilliant.”
“It’s not that simple.”
. Seven years! Seven years ago in
They laughed again, but John was still worried.
, she was only thirteen! She shouldn’t have to . . . Well, the point is, she got sick . . .”
“No.” He examined his hand. Three eights. It wasn’t much, but he had been making the most of a crap hand all his life. He threw in another chip.
“It was Watson’s sister, Beta Harry Watson, who spotted the letter as a forgery.”
“My eyes did not cross.”
“Oi,” said one, “ain’t that the little fucker what messed up Roger and his boys? I seen his face in the papers.”
“John.”
“All his vitals are reading as normal,” said the doctor, consulting his chart. “Body temperature is good, despite time spent in the water. Pulse steady at 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 120 over 80. No respiratory problems, no broken bones, no organ damage. Injuries sustained in the dog fight are minimal, which is a miracle, frankly. There are some curious puncture wounds in the abdomen, as though from a needle, like he’d been injected with something, but nothing is coming up on the bloodwork except your own scent markers, Mr. Holmes.”
Automatically, his teeth parted, his tongue pressed to the back of his front teeth. But he was at war with himself. The compulsion to obey was strong, almost overpowering; his determination to rebel, however, would not yield ground.
“Please,
He kept his back determinedly turned; even so, he cupped himself for privacy.
John blinked. “Of course, Clara Whittle.”
“That’s— that’s hardly the issue. We love each other like mad, but just, you know, not in ‘that’ way.”
And then he was gone.
“Now imagine that those two variables come into sync. Two trains traveling the exact same track at the exact same speed at the exact same time. What happens then? The seemingly disparate universes sense the synchronicity, and for a fraction—just a

as his chest slammed into the brick and his breath was forced out of him. Then he felt his head being pulled to the side, his neck exposed, and he knew what they had found. The mark.
He thought through all the evidence again, very carefully, and with the subjectivity of a computer analyzing data, until he was convinced. They had all been murders, all eleven of them, and Sherlock had let a serial killer escape justice. How had that been possible? Had he not considered all of the facts? More importantly, how had it been done?
First: A pistol in his hand, the
“Sherlock?”
There, he waited.
Suddenly, Harry Watson appeared on screen, speaking heatedly into a microphone held in front of her face. “I told those bastards,
But there was no denying he was good. The interview was thorough, and Sherlock extracted details John wouldn’t have thought to ask. When at last he was satisfied, he said, “I do hope you recover quickly, Ms Hooper. And rest assured, these Alphas will suffer the consequences of what they have done.” He turned to leave, but stopped short, came back around, and said, “Is there anything you need during your stay in hospital? Anyone you need us to contact, any pets to look after in your absence?”
“One article at a time. That is, one

John say something? John felt his heating blood darkening his cheeks, and as he blushed to the shade of a sunburn, Lestrade’s eyes widened in delight.
. And we need to find him and bring him back.”
It was then that John realized the brilliance of it. If he told Sherlock straight up what had happened, where he was from, why he was behaving so strangely, he would be labeled a nutter. But if Sherlock deduced it for himself, if he came to the

Sherlock reached the man first and cuffed him with handcuffs he’d filched from Lestrade some weeks before, leaving him on the ground crying and bleeding, though not mortally wounded. Breathing hard, he stood and wiped his nose, turning around just in time for John to catch him up. He was holding the gun upside down by the handle, the way one would pick up a hair from the bottom of a drain—one part wariness, two parts revulsion—and passed it back to Sherlock, saying, “Take it take it take it.”
“Um. No. Not for a little while.”
“A clumsy boy?” Sherlock continued. “Possibly. Maybe you did break
For the first time, Dr. Stapleton looked at him,
. If the wind had been blowing any other way, you would likely have ended up dead.”
She was right; now that she mentioned it, John could smell the subtle sweetness in the air that stirred in him a sympathetic response. His bowels rumbled unpleasantly. She was entering her heat.
Though she clearly wasn’t opposed to further, erm, inspection, for all either of them knew, Irene Adler had fled to Japan.
“Are you okay?” asked Sherlock, alarmed. He’d never seen such a dismal performance. Not from John. Certainly not when it came to firearms. He slipped the gun back into his pocket and took John’s arm. “You’re positively shaking.”
and silky friction in the tightest of spaces; the hands that massaged the skin of his thighs and waist and chest while a far more intimate kind of massage was taking place deep within. John’s breaths against Sherlock’s neck were coming faster and faster, and with each thrust, a tiny whimper of ecstasy sang in his throat, like music in Sherlock’s ear.
“Why?” he mouthed. Then a decibel louder: “Why are you here?”
And the next was only thirty-one days away. A month had never seemed so short.
But maybe that was the problem! He thought he could pretend that things weren’t fundamentally different now, but maybe Sherlock was right. He wasn’t the same John Watson anymore. Maybe Sherlock just wanted to return to the Alpha-Omega bond they had known from the beginning, and they couldn’t return.
“I can’t, all right? I fucking can’t, they’re too far away. But they’re watching me. Jesus, Sherlock, this is not okay, this is fucking not okay.”
John, loosened by alcohol, was unperturbed. “I mean, you misidentified the body. That’s kind of embarrassing. For you.”
But when Dr. Stapleton learned about the second attack that had landed John in hospital, she concluded what Mycroft had suggested after the first: that Sherlock was doing an inadequate job of protecting his evidently suicidal Omega. In Sherlock’s hands, John was going to get himself killed. It was shortly after that, when Sherlock’s guard was down and he assumed she was on her way out the door, that she had produced the syringe with enough tranquilizer to fell three full Alphas. He caught sight of it only briefly, in the mirror. Next moment, he was crashing to the floor.
He repositioned himself, hovering above on all fours and barely touching, except to drop dew-like kisses on the back of John’s neck, then trailing down his back, one vertebra at a time. He drew his fingers across shoulders and shoulder blades, massaging as he went, listening for John’s satisfied breaths, his appreciative moans. Then he placed a kiss in the small of John’s back and began to slip off his underwear. “Okay?”
That’s why she put him into the MRI machine that apparently existed in her super-secret laboratory.
To his surprise and bemusement, John shoved him backwards—
“They
“Because Sherlock would never invite . . .” John trailed off, embarrassed. “That is, what I mean is . . . Well, it’s so late, you know.”
“Yes?”
He found his brother sitting in his own chair, one leg crossed over, sipping tea. That meant he’d been there at least ten minutes already. Had he
He spun, just in time to see the old woman lunging at him, brandishing the cook’s knife. With a start, he caught his breath and fell back a step, but this self-preserving reaction was unnecessary, for in that moment John had leaped forward himself and tackled the woman to the ground. There was a discernible
The leader of the pack, Roger, the one with the gash in his head, stepped forward. “You gonna fight us? You? We’re going to
The bouncer scowled. “What, were you born yesterday? That’s the law. No Omegas without their Alphas.”
Though they tried to appear impassive, John’s jaw was clenched and Sherlock’s eyes were wide, and when they exchanged glances, each knew exactly what the other was thinking.
“Have you paused to consider it the other way around? How he

Was this a medical problem? An allergic reaction or a virus or some form of bacteria that caused swelling? But . . . this wasn’t
“Am I alone in feeling as I do?”
Sherlock came at him in a rush. His mouth was hot and eager against John’s own: the warm slide of lips, the hot breath and needy tongue. There was no shy experimentation or nervous exploration. They didn’t follow the normal progression of lips first, then a little tongue, then a lot. John met him with an open mouth, and was met with an open mouth, and they were kissing with a longing grown in secret over two years of living together: walking the same bit of carpet and drinking from the same teacups and bathing under the same stream. They already share these same spaces, just not at the same time. But time and space were collapsing, and John craved a oneness with this man, his best and closest friend, that they had not allowed themselves before.
John gasped, and half a second later, the man in the reflection gasped too and clapped a hand across his mouth. John made a strangled sound in his throat, an aborted cry, but the reflection had no such restraint. Instead, it turned its head toward the kitchen, and cried out
from the back of the flat. Heart racing, John whipped his head around to see Sherlock racing through the kitchen. Then his face broke out in delight, because
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Clearly. About twenty years old, I would guess. A deep cut, though not from a blade. It’s not clean enough. I was asking what happened.”
Heather Hill nodded vapidly. “Every Alpha deserves a happy Omega.”
“The hell it is! What did you do to Sherlock!”
Sherlock took a couple of steps closer, but just a couple. “So. Um.”
actually exists, but Portugal doesn’t?”
“You don’t know the system, John, the legal allowances. Only Molly’s pack can fight in her name.”
“Think about Molly,” he said. “You know what happened to her.”
“Betas like that disgust me,” Sherlock said with a scowl. “They hardly have the instinct to care for an Omega child to begin with, but wilful ignorance is reprehensible. They’re being tried for murder, I hope.”
He tore the house upside down looking for them, and Dad followed him around, mocking his panic, saying, “You said you didn’t want to play. You said it, Johnny.”
“Nor a test subject. Our primary interest is in reversing the event.”
This work is being translated into Chinese, which can be found
It took a few seconds for his comment to register in John’s brain. He hadn’t gone to bed
“Nah, nah, I’m good. I’m good,” said John, pulling a hand away from his eyes, but staring skyward. “Whoo!” Then he bent over, hands on knees, covering his mouth and breathing loudly.
The way he wrote about his life with Sherlock said it all. He was besotted, completely and helplessly enamored of the genius whom he’d met on a train seven years ago, and . . .
Crossing to a chair, Sherlock sat regally and crossed a leg over. “We’ve come to ask you what you know about alternate realities.”
“Really.”
“So if it hadn’t been for our, erm, dramatics the night I came back, maybe this letter he had slipped under my pillow would have been the nudge I needed.”
“I don’t—” His heart was pounding irrationally in his chest, and suddenly there was a sound swelling in his ears, like the roar of thunder. But then it faded, his heart slowed again, and he could breathe just fine. “Nothing. I just had a moment of . . .” Of what? He had never experienced anything quite like it and so couldn’t find the words. He shook his head to clear his mind and said, “I’m fine.”
“What was that?”
“Jesus, Sherlock . . .”
Sherlock didn’t answer. He flipped the bow into the air and caught it deftly. Then he began to play. “Auld Lang Syne” filled 221B, and John sighed and sat in his chair.
“Sher—!” he squeaked. He trembled. But that was all. He was practically catatonic with the shock of what was happening. This—
, he would be upset. Appalled, I believe, is the word you used. Mortified.” John turned the corner and came to a set of locked double doors. There was a keypad, and only Sherlock knew the code. But John punched the numbers as smoothly as if he had done it a thousand times.
Behind closed eyelids, John saw the 221B he had known for two happy years. Everything from the way the curtains fell over the windows to the skull perched on the mantelpiece. He began to describe it aloud, item after item, detail after detail, right down to the color and where it was placed in the room, and Sherlock listened intently, not interrupting until . . .
tried to talk him out of it.”
“No.” Sherlock pointed a finger at him, his jaw stern but his eyes pained. “He can’t be. If you pushed him out, or pushed him down—”
“Give me another explanation, John. Please. I
“Say what about what?”
He’d already spent hours contemplating these new theories, without much breakthrough or insight. Could it be possible that his counterpart wasn’t as clever as himself? An unacceptable notion. Sherlock and John had brought
John fished out two ten-pound notes and shoved them into the front seat. “Not your problem,” he snapped.
“I . . . I always knew our bond was strong. I just never realized . . . We really were meant for one another, weren’t we?”
“What?” Sherlock felt like he had walked in in the middle of a conversation. Or like he’d missed a step on the stair. He wasn’t quite following John’s train of thought.
“You don’t know? That alone tells me it’s been too long. You should bring it up. Nothing wears down a mattress like an Omega in heat, isn’t that what they say? I mean, Omega Houses alone are enough to keep Serta in business.”
“Let’s just sleep,” said John quickly.
John was visibly taken aback.
“No, no, it’s fine.”
“Yes.” He looked around the room and saw Omega anatomy charts hanging on the walls and one poster reading
John pointed at the portraits lining the walls. Well, not exactly portraits. More like blown-up pages of illuminated manuscripts, as painstakingly inked and decorated as any page of ancient scripture. They contained every word John had ever penned on his blog, transformed into calligraphy, highlighted with colorful inks and images. As they walked, Sherlock’s eyes grazed the words:
Still, John hesitated.
“Sherlock,” said Sherlock.

Sherlock. And that meant, his Sherlock had had sex with some other John.
“You just said, if we get too close, he’ll smell me.”
He took a quick whiff, then a series of short, rapid sniffs, then a long, seeking inhalation, smelling the air for his bond-mate. But all he smelled was the tomatoes from the carbonara.
lied to me. I could always tell when a John lied to me.”
Stunned, Sherlock watched John hurrying away, a hand clamped to his mouth. Maybe he had misread the signs, and John wasn’t quite recovered from . . . whatever he had seen the doctor about. Maybe his insisting that John accompany him had been a mistake. But if John was unwell, he would
“I don’t know what’s happened . . . ‘John’ . . . but I promise you.” Sherlock pulled back and held John’s head between his large hands so that he could look him square in the eye. “Whatever it is, we’ll get it sorted. We’ll set it right.”
“Prudence,” Sherlock corrected, sharply.
“So?” Where was he going with this?
“So much he can’t even talk about it.”
Having grounded Sean, and with the other two Alphas rushing at them, John and Sherlock split apart. John darted left, acting as a rabbit to catch Trevor’s hound-like eye, and Sherlock sprinted right. But when it seemed that both Alphas were pursuing John, Sherlock changed course and threw himself into Roger’s path. The two Alphas crashed to the ground to the sound of a crowd groaning and screaming.
“A dog fight,” John repeated, as if he didn’t even know what it meant.
Three keystrokes later, the footage began again. Though the CCTV that had best captured the images was in color, it was grainy, poorly angled, and distant. Despite all that, Sherlock didn’t for a second question whether it was John: he would know his Omega anywhere, scent or no scent. Once more, he watched the screen with a tilted head and squinting eyes. For over an hour already, he’d been scrutinizing the video and was beginning to develop a headache and crick in his neck. It was still early, but though John was usually first up to prepare a full English breakfast for his morning-ravenous bond-mate, he hadn’t even left the bedroom yet. It was just as well. John hadn’t slept much the night before, and what with the attack, he was certainly still out of sorts. In any case, it gave Sherlock a chance to review the details without distraction.
When he wasn’t locked in his room with the fluffy robe and children’s movies (and new metal bars across the window pane), he was under constant supervision. Aside from the testing, Dr. Stapleton tried to interview him about his own world, the exact moment of displacement, what differences he had discovered, the challenges of adjustment, and so on, and so forth, but John refused to even part his teeth. He sat with crossed arms and a fixed glare for what felt like days but only amounted to hours. So she had no idea just how long ago the displacement had occurred, or how. John didn’t even confirm that it had happened at all.
“How what?”
John 1:
John laughed humorlessly. “How about, I’ll punch your nose flat if you start running psychology tests on me.”
“But Sherlock.” He hesitated a moment, unsure whether he should say it, here and now. But, he reckoned, now was as good a time as any. So he took a breath, licked his lips, and said, “Maybe there are times when he wants to.”
The other John had lied to him. He had left without saying goodbye. He had jumped alone. So John had returned alone.
“What do you mean by ‘off’?” John stepped lightly toward his chair, seeking for signs that he would not be welcome if they sat together. There were none, so he sat.
Sherlock huffed. “I know when my Omega leaves my side.”
“I know.”
In answer, John returned his gaze to Sherlock’s ass, cocked his head to the side, and smiled. Lestrade roared with laughter.
“Oh.” Then he understood. “What was your third theory, Sherlock?” he asked quietly.
“What the hell?” he said.
“I— That is—” He couldn’t say anything of what he was thinking and feeling. Or could he? “I just wanted to say . . . I wish this was something we could do together. I really . . .”
“Was that”—dizzy, Sherlock reminded himself to breathe—“all right?”
For Sherlock Holmes, it was the longest, loneliest night of his life.
“This is exactly why you need to find yourself a bond-mate, so things like this won’t ever happen again!”
“Hm?”
“You’re bonded, aren’t you?”
“A doctor friend I know from . . . back home. I met him in the hospital here, and . . .” He quieted, to hear what Mike was saying.
“That
“Jesus, Sherlock, what the hell!”
John could feel her moving around him, could hear the sound of a machine humming and metal clinking against glass. The smell of sterility put him in mind of a laboratory or hospital, but he didn’t open his eyes to find out, lest he give himself away.
“About the seeeehhhhcccc”—

“Say what now?”
“Though really, Sherlock, before we play twenty questions—”
“I started sobbing, I’m not ashamed to say. Because I thought I was about to watch my baby brother die on national television. Are you hearing me? I thought he was a lamb for the slaughter.”
Sherlock couldn’t sleep, least of all because the couch was too narrow, short, and uncomfortable. His brain wouldn’t quiet down, and it was driving him mad. He was driven to spend the night

he could detect such a thing), and it wasn’t enticing at all. With a pang of regret and confusion, he realized he missed the old scent. He much preferred it.
“Why are you so surprised?” A look of offense darkened Sherlock’s normally bright blue eyes. “Unlike you, I’ve been bonded with my John for seven years. You claim only two with
“It was obvious the man hadn’t been mauled by tigers,” Sherlock continued, oblivious to John’s arrested approach. “Someone just wanted it to look like he had. Stab wound was the giveaway.”
“Ma’am,” said John deferentially.
Had Sherlock known him before Afghanistan, he wouldn’t have to worry about what he really thought of the bullet wound scar.
“To the library,” John mumbled.
“I see.”
now. She said,
“I just . . . wasn’t expecting . . . when I came home . . .” Sherlock stopped himself. “I’ll be honest, John. I may not be the most socially adept man in a crowd, but I can usually figure out these kinds of things. But this one has me stumped.”

Sherlock.”
And when he showed it to the mirror, he saw John had written back as well:
For the next fifteen or twenty minutes, John just lay there and writhed and groaned and hated life and everything in it. He could think about nothing but his need for relief. When Sherlock got back, he thought, he might have to ask to be taken to A&E after all. Food poisoning would pass. But he was beginning to doubt his initial diagnosis. He felt no nausea at all. And the cramping was bad, but he couldn’t relegate it to the stomach, and perhaps not even the intestines. He didn’t know what this was. Kidney stone? Maybe. But then why did putting pressure on his (alarmingly tiny) cock assuage some of the frightfully intense discomfort? He had no idea, just lay there writhing, groaning, and squeezing himself through his pyjamas.
“What are you talking about?”
“Margaret and Lucy.”
John crooked an eyebrow. “Why might you think that?”
, he now recognized the gentleness that his bond-mate was capable of and how, if such things
Color spread across Lestrade’s cheeks like he had developed a sudden and alarming rash. “Molly doesn’t have much by way of family. And she likes her flatmates just fine, but the place holds bad memories for her now, so . . . Well, my place is in a really good part of town, and I know it seems fast, but we’ve made something of a connection—”
sense.”
The momentary relief evaporated the instant John stepped into the room.
What he was less prepared for, however, was an attack from his sister.
Interesting indeed, thought John, who was feeling warmer all over.
“Promise I won’t.”
But no!
“You should keep your gomer on a tighter leash,” growled one of the Alphas. “Careless, really.”
. Already swollen and blackening where the blood was collecting, a result of burst capillaries, the bruise spread from his left eye down his cheek and to the upper lip. The eye was so red itself that it hurt just to look at, and Sherlock’s eyes began to water in sympathy.
They sat across from each other in their respective chairs. By this point, John’s knees were drawn up under his chin and his arms wrapped around his legs. Sherlock, who had been variously pacing, twirling, and sitting in his chair with restless leg syndrome, was for the first time in many hours quite still. Both feet were planted squarely on the floor, and both arms had found their armrests.
, and not just in a friendly, hands-off, here’s-my-toothpaste-but-don’t-use-my-toothbrush kind of way.
Molly Hooper was smiling. Her eyes were sparkling, like she was about to cry.
John barely stopped his mouth from dropping open and revealing half-eaten toast-and-egg. “You what?”
“Then explain.”
“I’m giving you the chance to surrender,” he said.
He took the bread out of the oven only when it began to smoke.
But then he turned and looked down the tunnel running in the other direction. He wasn’t young, but he was nowhere near old. He wouldn’t last four thousand more. He just wouldn’t.
“Oh him? Nothing? Forget him. Tell me more about the, um, hoses.”
But when he set two bottles of whisky on the counter at the liquor store, the clerk (whom John identified as Beta and hated himself for it) raised an eyebrow, gave a quick sniff, and said, “ID, please.”
“No. Not like,
But it never came.
His shoulders were seized; he was rolled onto his back. Two fists grabbed the front of his shirt and half lifted him off the ground, and all around him, the Alphas huddled, blocking out the sun.
John wasn’t sure he wanted to hear it, but he asked, “And in the case of the challenger pack? If one of those members is lost?”
“—I’d love to hear your three implausible theories.”
“I don’t know! St Margaret’s, take me to St Margaret’s Hospital.”
He took a drink. “Does it bother you?” he asked when Sherlock reached the end of the song but before his bow had lifted from the string.
She came up short and asked breathlessly, “What’s that?”
Thing one: Sherlock was not a killer. Therefore, Dr. Stapleton was a liar.
God, he was a class-A
“Ever the observant one,” said Sherlock with mock exasperation, but he stood a moment admiring. Was he only now seeing it, as though for the first time, the clean cut of John’s shoulders, the smooth line of his jaw, the soft blue eyes, a color intensified by the shade he wore? Now he understood on a more conscious level why he liked that jumper so much.
“Sad.”
John’s face twisted as though in pain, and he half turned away; but Sherlock’s accusation that he was hiding seemed to root him from turning away completely. Instead, he tried to school his face. “Two years we’ve lived together,” he said, nearly whispering because of the thickness of his throat. “Two years, and you never once . . . And then, I leave, and just
seems to be with John. And stop avoiding the question.”
She flashed him a glance, but returned her answer to Sherlock. “We’ve yet to discover hard evidence of other worlds having any influence whatsoever on our own. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. In my own work, I have written extensively on transplanar displacement, a theory gaining more and more traction among my colleagues. If I may flatter myself, I dare say, its implications are exciting.”
John uncapped the pen and wrote hastily against the mantle.
In the morning, an old man from Hammersmith arrived at the flat with an unusual claim.
They were looking at each other now, Sherlock with furrowed brow and John with a look of . . . what was that? Disappointment? Disapproval? He could barely name it, he was so unfamiliar with the expression. Not from John, anyway.
John nodded mutely, his face having drained from crimson to ashen.
At last, Donovan chose to ignore the unusual greeting. “This way,” she said. Sherlock and John fell in line behind her. Sherlock watched John from the corner of his eye, his level of concern elevated a modicum of a percent.
“Ever had one of those dreams that feels really
come from? Sounded like somebody had been spending a fair bit of time watching
“Because he
“We incapacitate the weakest first,” Sherlock had devised in the hotel room, where they rehearsed their moves.
“Theoretically. The mathematics is sound. But if one criterion is not carefully accounted for, then failure is inevitable.”
He performed rescue breaths. More chest compressions. More breaths.
John let out a long breath. The impossibility factor was climbing. “And just how are we supposed to do that?”
“The tree! John, the tree!”
Chris turned away from the monitor. “Near as I can tell, that’s exactly what you did. More or less. And that’s what you need to do again.”
It had been a long while since John had regarded him with such open-faced admiration. Sherlock felt his ears warm.
“Well,” said Dr. Stapleton, smoothing her hands across her trouser legs.
“No. No, that’s
“To the letter.”
John received Sherlock’s text—a perfect echo of the one he himself had sent Sherlock that morning—while strolling through the park, so deep in thought it took his brain a few moments to register the ding of his text alert.
John shrugged. “Not at all. I’m just saying, you should finish. That is, we should. You know. See it through.” As Sherlock’s eyes went wide, John said placidly, “Like you said at the start, it might be . . . prudent.”
And now, he was less than a foot away, witnessing firsthand the throes of bad dreams that too often beset his friend. What should he do? Was it wrong to wake him? Dangerous to touch him?
“You just got here!”
Sherlock, that is. Why? Because his Sherlock was not a sentimental creature. And even if he were, he wasn’t a sexual one. And even if he were
“Wrong moment.”
“John wasn’t specific.”
“John?” he whispered. “Please. Please.”
“No!”
“I said I’m okay.”
“Magnitude and direction,” Sherlock said.
Hours later, John awoke well rested and content, forgetting the stresses of the night before. But when he opened his eyes, he remembered where he was. Not only in a bed not his own, but a world not his own. He remembered, too, the image he had witnessed through the mirror. The other John, he was convinced, had
John, may be reactionary and overdramatic, but he’s not the sort to run away from . . . That is, he’s not a coward. He wouldn’t refuse to use the mirror again just to stick it to me.”
Sherlock didn’t remember giving in. He didn’t remember commanding his feet to move. He didn’t even remember crossing the room. But suddenly, there he was, and he held John’s head with two hands. John. His John. The most precious thing in the world. And then he kissed him.
“You object?”
To mask his uncertainty on the drive back to Baker Street, Sherlock asked for silence so he could think, and without any complaint whatsoever, John acquiesced, opting instead to lace his fingers together with Sherlock’s and cuddle up next to him, resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and dozing. For his part, Sherlock remained stiff. He didn’t put him off, but nor did he exactly welcome the affection. He had allowed his emotions to overwhelm him of late, at the expense of his mental faculties; now, he flipped those switches to their opposite settings.
“I require your assistance,” he said into his phone as he paced the sitting room, fighting not to kick over a chair. The white noise of the shower continued uninterrupted.
The magazine emptied. He thrust it into Sherlock’s hands, snatched up the next pistol, and—raising it to the target, imagining it to be the embodiment of all Alpha oppression—he fired off three rapid shots, each exploding in the center of the forehead.
“Not literally, of course. Seems we’re done with . . . Anyway, what this
After finally dressing, John left the flat and walked to the corner to buy fish and chips from a food truck. There, he checked his phone. No messages from Sherlock asking if things had started yet or announcing when he would be home. Just as well. If neither of them said anything, it was just assumed that things were progressing normally. But all the same, it would have been nice to be asked.
He was a tightly wound ball of stress. Sherlock hadn’t come home last night, and John had cried himself to sleep, his arms wrapped around Sherlock’s pillow if only to breathe him in, feeling not only the sting of rejection but also the aching emptiness of something vital that had been lost. For seven years, without fail, he had fallen asleep next to his Alpha, and he had trusted that nothing would ever disrupt that pattern. But come morning, finding himself still alone, he feared that Sherlock’s disgust of him in this wholly baffling form meant John would never see him again, that the bond was broken, that Sherlock was off to find himself a new Omega. The thought alone almost shattered him into a thousand pieces. So by the time he had convinced himself to get out of bed, he had come to a decision: to do whatever it took to change himself back.
And without waiting for further argument, Sherlock took John’s nearer shoulder, eased him back down, and rolled him gently back onto his side. Then he slid down and close behind him. His left arm curved up and around John’s head on the pillow; the other, he wrapped around John’s torso, splaying a hand over his chest. John tensed.
And flinched.
his counterpart would have come up with the same one—so he had to devise another: getting Sherlock Holmes to go to bed without Sherlock Holmes know he was being manipulated.
offered Mycroft tea, a sign that he need not stay a while. It was an unspoken rule between them: never prolong a Mycroft visit.
“Maybe a tourniquet.”
“I can’t thank you enough. I really can’t.” She took his hand and squeezed it, and a tear spilled over and rolled down a cheek.
into the atoms of the mirror, where the particle atom has more energy, for just a fraction of a second, and—”
John licked his lips, glanced down at his shoulder, took a deep breath, and said, “It happened so suddenly, I barely knew it was happening at all. One minute, I was walking across a bridge, absolutely fine, and the next . . . I was speared by lightning.”
Ah, so it was true, then. Sherlock
He stepped again.
, you meant, you know … books.”
“Would you just
“I’m fine, Mrs Hudson,” said John, wheezing, his face purpling. He coughed a few times, trying to clear his throat.
“What I mean is, Sherlock and I . . . we’re not a couple.”
Sherlock frowned. “A surrender on my part would retract that challenge and force an end to the fight. No consequences whatsoever would befall the offenders. I can think of no action more shameful, and it would be legal grounds for you to file for bond severance.”
They didn’t wait to see whether Roger could be revived. They didn’t stick around for Sean’s public castration. The Alphas were defeated, and that was what mattered. Sherlock took his Omega’s hand, but it was John who led them away, through the silent crowd.
“Is the spinning necessary?”
“What is it?”
“The universe?”
If the way he writes about you isn’t proof enough, think of the way he looks at you, teases you, laughs with you, and follows you into danger, night after night. Isn’t that exactly why he’ll follow you again? What’s more dangerous than love?"
. Probably the most interesting person he knew. What’s more, he was probably—most definitely—the person Sherlock cared for most in the world, and though that list was very, very short, that didn’t diminish the intensity of the sentiment. Sherlock cared for John, very much. He had once reasoned with himself, privately, after the pool incident, that if it ever came down to it, he would die for John. Gun to the head, no question about it, he would die for John.
There were other benefits, too. Sex as a Beta wasn’t three days and done, and a long stretch of waiting and anticipating until the next cycle came around the bend. They could do it
“Whoa, what are you doing?”
“Challenge accepted.”
“Ticklish?”
no before you. Not for me. Alphas don’t need to mate, not like Omegas do, and any Alpha who thinks differently is kidding himself. Most have a drive, certainly, but . . . not me. Not until I met you.”
“Okay, mate, sorry. Look, John, do you need me to call someone for you?”
“I know, Sherlock, stop fidgeting.”
He couldn’t say what, exactly, and so on the whole, he ignored it. It was just little things, things Sherlock couldn’t even name, fleeting thoughts he couldn’t pin down when John moved a certain way or said a certain thing or laughed at a pitch that was for a flash of a moment unfamiliar—but then the moment would pass, and Sherlock couldn’t understand why he had this niggling feeling in the back of his mind. So he stamped it down and ignored it.
“Were they
“Right there!” Sherlock declared, laughing. “I told you he was polite. Just ask her
“About what?”
His mad dash didn’t last long. He just couldn’t compete with their long legs or predatory instincts. One of them pounced, and John was driven into the ground so forcefully he got a mouthful of grass. The phone bounced away from him, and suddenly two hundred and twenty pounds of Alpha pinned him so tightly he could scarcely breathe.
Sherlock lifted his head.
“Maybe they’re out on a case.”
The closet door flew open, and there stood John.
“He didn’t tell me. He didn’t even say goodbye, so and I didn’t know. And I wasn’t there to—”
“What do you mean, what is it? It’s a clinic for Omegas. Never mind. Just . . . just take me to Omega Emergency. That should be good enough.”
“—hand . . .” Sherlock’s voice trailed off, but he dropped his gaze. So John looked away first. His eyes were burning. “I’ve said something wrong.”
They sat him at the interrogation table, in the interrogation room, with the interrogator. Though they took off the muzzle and ankle chains, they left the iron cuffs.
“Oh my
He trusted this Sherlock’s calculations. It would work. It had to.
From St. Margaret’s, it was a good thirty minutes to Baker Street on foot, but John was happy to walk. He needed the time to think. Besides, it wasn’t dangerous, this time of morning. The sun was just cresting in the East, and morning commuters were already busying the roads but not the pavement, so for the most part, he walked alone.
? Are you drunk?”
“Cock and bull, that’s what it is.”
“Synchronicity. I saw him, Sherlock. Through the mirror in the sitting room. I saw John.”
With the abruptness of a startled rabbit, John gasped and launched his body off of Sherlock’s, rolling inelegantly, and crashing to the floor.
Which was why, three hours past sundown, Sherlock was positive something was wrong, and he was hardly one to overreact. Every single Alpha-on-Omega assault case he had worked over the years, every forced bonding, and every bond severing resurfaced in his mind. He remembered the looks and smells of the victims, and even now they churned his stomach.
And then the air was burning.
“Did it work though? Did you get the”—he rolled his head and smiled—“data that you needed?”
Sherlock furrowed his brow, confused. “You just said: We can’t coordinate a lightning strike.”
Find me CCTV footage.”
There was silence in the room. Sherlock suddenly had no more questions. John felt like he was drowning. Dr. Stapleton looked curiously between them, wondering at the sudden shift of mood in the room. But despite her brilliance, she couldn’t possibly understand.
“You never do see me when I’m sat on a bench,” said the man with a laugh, once he had caught John up. He rested a hand on his round belly as he tried to catch his breath. “Had to shout at you three times!”
“And you think I won’t react well when I see you naked?”
John wasn’t one to sing his own praises, and he would never pretend to occupy a
, are you drunk?”
Sherlock skidded to a halt on the kitchen linoleum, and his eyes went wide at the sight of John standing there, hair wet and wild, clothes sticking to his skin. John’s heart skidded in response. They stood mute, staring at one another, like they’d never seen the sight of each other before, or never expected to again. John couldn’t help himself: He smiled. He laughed. He stood tall and spread his arms as if to say,
you do. But not . . . in a merely . . .
John sighed a little helplessly. How was he to answer that? Sherlock was so gorgeous a blind man could see it. His dark, hapless curls, those sharp, inquisitive eyes, his one-hundred-expressions lips, and all that said nothing about his figure. John didn’t need to be gay to appreciate it. Didn’t . . .
Forty-five minutes later, as the conversation was winding down, Sherlock said, “So three ingredients. Velocity, sudden transference of energy . . .”
“I have a few minutes,” said his once-upon-a-time friend. “Come in here, we’ll talk.”
John had read every word of John’s blog, three times now, and he hadn’t once mentioned his proficiency with firearms. Sure, he must have had the proper training, being a soldier and all that, but John had always figured it was a formal training hardly used in the field. He was an army doctor, after all.
Sherlock’s hand smoothed over the scar, dragging down, and with it, Sherlock lowered himself to a crouch behind John on the stool, continuing to explore his whole back. He was more tactile now than before. His hands were roaming, pressing,
He’d been attacked. Clearly. But what was more, Sherlock knew it had been a pack. The stink radiated off of him like heat from a furnace. His John had been
noticed.”
John loved it, but Sherlock had stopped eating it after getting into a fight with the owner of the nearest restaurant four years ago (he had correctly deduced the illicit love affair between the owner’s wife and head chef based on the wrapping of a spring roll), and they hadn’t had it since.
“So tell me, John. What’s it been like for you, since defeating the Alpha pack?”
. All he knew was that John had said he had been to a doctor, and Sherlock accepted that as explanation. But, really, it wasn’t much of an explanation. He tried to discount it as none of his business, but his data-deducing brain still wanted to make sense of it all, and he just couldn’t.
And she started forward, intending to rush to John before Sherlock could reach him. But John dropped the vials to the floor. The glass shattered, the solution ran all over the floor, and John whipped out the pistol and pointed it in her face. “Back! Stay back!”
Lestrade?! John had the sudden urge to hide, as though someone else would be able to spot that he was an imposter in this world, though it was an irrational thought. If Sherlock hadn’t noticed, Lestrade certainly wouldn’t.
“Chelmsford. Yes. Of course.
And there it was. Estrus. Heat. That was what he had experienced. He was an Omega-Y. Sherlock, clearly, was an Alpha-Y. And if this had been just one hundred years ago, chances were, the last three days would almost certainly have resulted in pregnancy. His.
John sighed. “Yes. Bluntly.”

“Of course, it’s me. What are you doing with
A confession? Now? What could it be? That he’d never been with a man? That he wasn’t sure this is what he wanted after all? That he had met someone else and had a secret Spanish lover and was moving out to start a new life in Barcelona and marry a matador and open a tapas bar and
With that, Sherlock stomped away like a recalcitrant child. Seconds later, the bathroom door fell shut with a bang. John was left holding a bloody shirt matching the color of his face: furious.
John twisted slightly to see Sherlock’s brow knitted in concern. “What?”
“Er-hermy,” said John, meaning to say yes.
He stared. The toilet was not filled with, well, what he thought it would be filled with. The water was almost clear, maybe just a little milky. And it smelled sort of sour-sweet.
“He’s just been assaulted himself! He should be resting, if not in your care then at least in his sister’s.”
“No. But, I guess the thing is, I almost was.”
Sherlock swallowed and couldn’t feel his feet. He think not could do John John John . . . Wait, what? He shook his head, trying to get his syntax to order itself.
“Aha. We’re here.”
Lestrade smiled a little falsely, clearly still disturbed. “Great. Well. You know. As good as one can expect when investigating a murder. Sherlock on his way?”
and rushed through the door. He pounded up the stairs and had just entered the mercifully unoccupied sitting room when a particularly powerful wave of pain in his gut washed over him, resonating in the center of his body and spreading to every limb, and he was forced to crouch and wait for the pain to subside. Oh, this was bad. Bad bad bad. He hadn’t been ill in so long, and it seemed as though his body was determined to make up for it all in one go. When he could walk straight again, he hurried as quickly as he could to the bathroom.
. He remembered how strong Sherlock had been, handling him so easily, barely aware of his initial resistance. And now he was up against three of them, all at once.
“Only if you’re a good lad and behave.” Lestrade chuckled, and he tapped John’s arm as if they shared part of some inside joke then left them to it.
“And it’s not that I don’t want you there—”
“I need to explain
“Yes, he
—was responding very, erm . . . positively to, ehm,
“Just for a couple of days. It’s begun.”
And waited.
“Is it”—
John stared at her, flummoxed. “That . . . that’s not true.”
“Like I said, I just got lucky.” He shifted forward guiltily. He had come to comfort
“Right. I mean, it’s not always Schubert, but . . .”
, the tires! The tires!”
“No,” he said smoothly. He felt Lestrade’s eyes flick in their direction. “Just … thinking.”
And then the doorbell rang.
Harry Watson looked like she had just woken up from a nap. Hung over? It was two in the afternoon. At least she wasn’t drunk. Yet.
“Hm,” Sherlock grunted.

There were only seconds until certain disaster. The circle was closing in. Sherlock was still nowhere in sight. The Alphas were leering, taunting, coiling, about to spring. But damned if John was going down without a fight. Just as the two Alphas on the bridge sprinted toward him, John feinted left, sprang right, and launched himself at the nearest Alpha, driving his right shoulder hard into the beast’s stomach. The Alpha—caught off his guard at being attacked by an Omega!—oofed, and suddenly he was on his back, the breath knocked out of him. And John ran.
. And the
“Thhhffffanck you.”
“Honestly, John, how much
The bus kept making stops, but John paid attention to none of it, not where he was, not who got off, and not who got on. So he didn’t see when three tall men—broad in the shoulders, thick in the neck, square in the jaw—climbed on board. He didn’t notice them looking at him, or even pointing at him, or even walking toward him, until one of them stood close to his side, another took the seat behind him, and another took the seat in front. He only noticed when the man behind leaned over, put a nose to his neck and breathed in.
Harry slowly let out a breath, and for a moment, John imagined it reeked of alcohol, and he braced for the tirade. But it never came.
“Pardon?”
When he read the screen, he smiled warmly.
“Does it hurt now?”
“M’kay.”
Trevor closed his eyes, bowed his head, and lifted his arms in surrender.
“Ready?”
Nothing. That pretty well summed up Sherlock’s reaction to his homecoming. Sherlock had been his greatest—and in the end, maybe his only—reason for needing to return. What else was there? He knew he no longer had a job. His sister pretty much couldn’t stand the sight of him. He’d even begun to enjoy
He couldn’t stomach looking at the reading materials on the drive home, so he shoved them into the inside pocket of his jacket and sat in the back of the taxi stewing over how helpless he felt. He did not know what to do. This was worse than that time back in primary school when those Alpha kids had him up a tree for six hours before one of the adults had finally noticed and made them scatter. Or that morning when Harry had gone off to university, but not before joking about how he’d never have to worry about classes or professors or getting good marks because he’d go to a trade school or straight into the workforce. She had no idea how painfully envious he’d been, though he had long since perfected the art of silence on the matter. Once, at only five years old, he had told his parents that he wanted to be a doctor. It was the first time in his memory that he had come to the realization that there were differences between Alphas, Betas, and Omegas, because Omegas, they told him, couldn’t become doctors. Or engineers. Or scientists. Or law enforcement. Or a host of other career options.
Sherlock blinked, befuddled. “I did tell you.” Slowly, he lay himself down alongside John’s body, cupped his jaw to keep John’s attention on him as he said, “Only for you, John. This wouldn’t happen for anyone but you.”
“You’re . . . John.”
The brevity of the message, the clipped tone, the calculated lack of warmth … John frowned, seeing it for what it was. Sherlock was overwhelmed and refused to acknowledge how all of this was getting to him. So he was escaping, long enough to get himself under control. But weren’t they supposed to work this out
Sherlock didn’t wait another breath, not to see what happened next, and not to ask John’s permission. He sprinted for John, grabbed his arm, swung him around as deftly as a child until John found himself riding his back, and with the speed of a raging bull, he bolted for the door, leaving Dr. Stapleton and Byron behind.
Chris’s eyes went so wide John thought they just might fall out of their sockets. “Holy shit.”
“I don’t want their pity.”
Sherlock endured his rambling and wordlessly held out his hand. Shyly, John brought out the book and placed it in his open palm. He awaited judgment.
The cleansing was finished. Order was restored. Sherlock gave his bond mark one last salving lick, then removed his mouth. But the embrace continued. Now that he had John back, now that the danger had passed, the weight of what might have transpired struck Sherlock to the core. He might have lost John completely. And that horrible thought, so stark and raw, sharpened the emptiness of his other loss, his own dear John, and he trembled at how much he missed him, at how terribly he hurt deep inside. The fear that he would never see him again was sharper than a razor. He crushed John to his breast and fought hard to keep from gasping with pain.
“Watson,” he said between clenched teeth. He couldn’t help but feel surly. Why did Mike get to be a Beta in this universe and not him? The injustice rankled. And now he was being corrected and condescended to by the man he had practically hand-held through immunology and let borrow his notes in embryology. And now

“I made the first move,” he said at last, though he neglected to mention what exactly that move had been. Even Lestrade didn’t need to know about how he’d splayed himself out naked on Sherlock’s bed as a surprise hello. “I think it startled him. Knowing I was, you know, interested. In him. Like that.”
“I take it that was okay, too.”
The crowd was going mad was astonishment at what was being witnessed.
John’s head snapped around so quickly a twinge of pain ran down his neck. “

The Mind Palace was quiet. They walked it together, hand in hand. Sherlock was rather surprised by this kind of silent familiarity. John was leading him, confidently, as if he knew the floorplans of the Palace better than he did.
“They’re naming them Sherlock and John.”
man in John’s life who had hurt him. To what extent, Sherlock was still discovering.
Sherlock’s voice is very pained now. “Studied . . . Studied what?”
Though he had spent the last three nights (and days) there, John was not keen to return to Sherlock’s bed (now changed with the last clean sheets they had), which he refused to think of as his, too. So while Sherlock showered, he hurriedly changed into pyjamas, and by the time he was out, John had heated him some beans with toast and milk, just to shut him up. Sherlock ate it without complaint and even had a second helping of beans. But it was while John was arranging the Union Jack pillow at the end of the couch and planning to spend the night there that Sherlock, now pyjama-clad himself, stepped back into the sitting room and said, “Don’t be ridiculous, you’re not spending the night there.”
“So you’ve said,” Sherlock drawled.
“Earlier today. You said . . . that is, do you want me to stay?”
“Again.”
“You’ll have to be more specific.”
“Oh John. You do not have the capacity for spyhood. You’re too simple.”
“My favorite,” said his partner.
At last, Sherlock set John squarely on his feet, backed away from the door for space, and unwound his arms. At least, a little. He still held him, one hand curled around his waist, the other cupping John’s face. John was melting.
“Is your pride worth your life? Your dignity?” he asked, appalled. “You can walk out of here. You can
“Shall we?” John asked, and Sherlock shook himself back to reality.
“Go on.”
“What’s wrong?”
you have to drink last night?”
“Yes, we saw it on the news last night,” said Molly. “I can’t believe you’ve been asked to address Parliament. Are you nervous? I’d be nervous.”
But on the other hand, Sherlock had only invited him along because he had believed John to be someone he actually knew and trusted, someone who had proven his mettle. He had believed John more knowledgeable than he really was, more competent than he really was, a fitting companion. He couldn’t pretend to be that anymore.
“Trust me,
“Two little Xs. Both Betas.”
—and it hurt his heart, a little, that this world’s John had done so much, and he so little. All John was good for were home remedies and the basics of a first aid kit. He couldn’t even give CPR.
Sherlock spun to face him and pointed an admonitory finger. “
“As sure as anything.”
“A kiss is . . . God, it’s the sweetest, most affectionate, most intimate thing two people can share! It’s selfless: you give a kiss, you don’t take one. It’s sensual: the touch, the movement, the warmth. It’s love, pure and simple. Sex is exciting and stimulating and very personal, yes, but without kissing . . . You have no idea what you’re missing.”
