But given his inability to tell her anything, he settled for a huff and a whine. She tutted.
“He can write? How does he hold anything- he has paws!” Clint pointed out, and Tony shook his head.
“Aristocats? I guess it’s appropriate, considering.” Peter said, plucking the remote out from underneath her and finishing the search. Bruce watched with wary eyes as Natasha huffed, slightly offended at Peter’s forwardness. She seemingly decided to give him a pass and she hopped from the sofa onto her chair and curled up on her blanket. Bruce stayed put as the opening credits started and watched with amusement as the other cats crawled out of the woodwork to settle in various places around Peter on the sofa.
as his team got the shit beat out of them.
The dough was cut into little dinosaur shapes (courtesy of one of Clint’s cookie cutter sets) and put in the oven to bake while Pepper set out some food for Tony and Steve.
“It’ll be fine. You trust me, right?” Steve asked, setting Tony down as he tested the temperature of the water. Tony hesitated a second before he nodded.
Tony approached him slowly, on his belly, as if he were crawling across a lake covered in thin ice.
obvious, right? “Nice, dude- he’s quite a
Dead quiet. No clunking or clicking or chugging; nothing that would suggest a machine. Tony peeked over the edge of the ladder and almost didn’t believe what met his eyes.
I'm super bad at this fanfiction thing. If you couldn't tell, lol. Let me know what you think in the comments below!

barely audible from her comm. Tony made a disgusted face and shot his repulsors into the mass of insects as he flew by, not staying to watch any explode. Tony wasn’t usually squeamish; he could handle blood and gore, but he drew the line at furniture-sized grasshoppers getting disemboweled in the streets. He did

He trusted Steve. Right?
Tony yelped again as he was brought back into the living room where everyone besides Thor had gathered. All of them were
“Can you identify what materials are being used in these? You seem like you have some engineering knowledge.” She said, subtly making a diversion so Tony and Steve had a chance to communicate.
It was a quiet car ride. The only sounds were from the radio playing softly in the front and Natasha’s knives making
“We can get Peter and his aunt, and we can get them out of there.” He said, ignoring the way his teammates shot each other doubtful glances. Why didn’t they care?
“How long have you got? Because my sorry-ass life story could fill a book.” Clint muttered, chuckling quietly to himself after a beat of silence.
“This is Captain Rogers, sir.” The rest of the cats formed a semicircle in front of the two, neatly wrapping their tails around their paws. Phil gave a small smile at them while Fury absorbed the information.
“Why am I not surprised?” Was the first thing Coulson said, slapping down a cell phone in front of Tony and Steve rather angrily. “Explain to me, in detail,
Tony put all his eggs into the half-cocked basket that was his plan, and leapt with all he was worth. He pushed off from the fence, then off from the oak, and right over the top and out. He barked in delight, getting out of range of the poles as the catchers tried to get him through the bars. He was a free dog!
At one point, Steve walked up behind him and put down his food bowl, full of the disgusting kibble. Tony didn’t even twitch. Eventually they all filed out and after almost a half hour of silence Tony uncurled and looked around. Nobody. He slunk over to the fridge and stood up on his hind legs to get it open, but he found that they had put a safety lock over the handles. There was no way Tony could get that open without fingers.
The camera was shaking rather ridiculously as the reporter and cameraman fled the street they had been standing on, and when it turned back all the Avengers let out sounds of shocked dismay- there was a field of craters in the road ahead of the news crew, and a few of the houses behind the reporter were on fire.

They all entered the lab to see ‘Tony’ typing on the main computer, all the bots in their charging stations and powered off. They must have manually been shut down, which Tony knew they hated, and it made him want to go for Loki’s throat. He kept himself in check and stood next to Thor while Clint got Loki’s attention.
They arranged him a rather comfortable blanket bed on the floor of the jet, where he had a good view of the screens to watch the battle resolve. Luckily the three active Avengers (plus Spider-Man) took out the rest of the robot army without much incident, and no civilian casualties.
Hey all!! I've been cranking out a lot this week, so I'm actually in the stages of finishing up all of the writing for this story! Enjoy the chapter, and get ready for the plot to thicken :)
“Peter Parker, you need to calm down, and let us explain ourselves.” Coulson said, and Peter’s face went white. Tony started to get nervous as he picked up on Pete’s anxiety, his fur fluffing out. “My name is Agent Coulson- remember me? We had a little chat after the events of last year. I think you’ll remember what I mean. You’ve come into possession of our property, and refusing to return it could have consequences- of the felony variety. This is a classified project, and it involves no animal experimentation whatsoever. If you don’t return him, we’re going to have a
“You got it.” Clint disappeared with Bruce down the roof access stairs.
“Oh. Well, I-I guess I could come, a-as long as you don’t require me to give away my identity at all. And a-as long as i’m not going to be… a-arrested.” He stammered, gently extracting himself from under Tony and brushing off his suit.
Steve went slow at first, but the more Tony tugged him on, the faster they got, until they were both sprinting full-tilt down the sidewalk. Steve guided them all the way to central park and they ran halfway around before Tony started to get tired. They slowed down to a walk and Steve found a bench, flopping down and staring out over the grass while Tony tried to catch his breath.
Clint returned and opened the kit, sitting down next to Bruce and handing him the antiseptic. They made short work of cleaning and stitching the wound. Tony was suddenly exhausted and he let them move him around as they pleased, not even twitching when they had to shave off some of the fur to stitch him up safely. That part had been a bit tedious; Bruce sent a helicopter-ing Steve upstairs to get an electric shaver while Thor leaned against one of the tables and looked to be doing some heavy thinking. Clint was subdued the whole time while Bruce kept up a conversation, mostly with himself. Natasha hadn’t returned.
“France, as it turns out, is just as weird as Italy.” He said, laying down with contentment as Clint rubbed his belly.
“You guys seem pretty down in the dumps. I’m sure Coulson will get him back, he seems qualified enough for that sort of thing.” Peter chirped, seeming mostly unphased and chipper. Tony wasn’t sure why, and he was distracted as the doors pinged and they were released back into the Avengers’ commons floor. The cats dispersed and Peter’s face went back to being slightly anxious as he looked to be internally regretting his decision to sign the forms Coulson gave him.
on the face. Peter looked really confused and scared- Tony didn’t really blame him. Official Suit Guy, accusing him of a felony. Poor guy. Tony purred at him, papping him a few more times until he smiled again. Coulson interrupted their little heart-to-heart, exchanging a glance with Hill.
“Straighten your leg out as much as you can.” She said, and they waited as Tony carefully extended his foot, cautious about hurting it any further. She took the x-ray and then removed the jacket for the final two of his chest. The three of them ended up in the other room as they waited for Hannah to fetch the results.
Tony thought, shaking himself to make his fur lay right. When he looked up, everyone but Thor was staring at him like he’d grown a second head.
“He’s here with us, Cap, don’t worry.” Bruce answered, from where he was still fussing over Tony’s bandages. Only a couple little cuts required gauze, but the spot where his head smacked the pavement had been wrapped and treated with ice. Bruce generously volunteered to hold it- given that Tony couldn’t.
Steve smiled and plugged the drain to let the tub fill, reaching into the linen closet to retrieve the grooming supplies and a towel.
Once again, as soon as Tony passed into the town, the wind dropped and it was absolute quiet. Nothing moved. The trees looked frozen in place, not a speck of disturbed snow in sight. The even blanket of white had a slight glow in the glare of the full moon and it was almost serene, if not for the feeling that he wasn’t supposed to be there. Like something was waiting, slumbering underneath the cobblestone streets and waiting for him to get too close. His fur was standing on end again.
Tony was simmering in frustration. He tried sprinting for a block or two but nothing helped; maybe he could find a way to burn energy on his way to the mansion. Maybe Tony could work on his agility? He had to get used to his new body, in case worst came to worst.
“Brother, we’re just here to help. We need you to explain your situation to us before we can do that.” Thor rumbled, as calm as ever. Loki’s ears flicked and he sighed rather dramatically.
Tony used his mouth to jimmy open a closet door, and
Natasha scooched her chair back and Tony got out of the way so she could get up and hobble back into the kitchen proper. He instead hopped onto a stool at the island and they stayed in comfortable silence while Natasha put a kettle on the stove, getting out a few ingredients from the cupboard.
Tony would need to prove himself. If he proved that he was capable of
Tony was left alone and he rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling as the clock ticked and the occasional nurse walked by the window.
“Wow, are you a military doggy? That was cool!” The guy- no, kid- pulled off his mask, panting as he got fresh air. Tony figured the shitty mask smelled like sweat- but that wasn’t an important thought, because he was suddenly struck by how
“Yes, he’s alright.” Natasha didn’t provide any more clarification, instead setting Tony in his normal chair on Steve’s right. Natasha always sat on Cap’s left, with Clint on her other side and Thor across from them next to Bruce, who sat next to Tony. Spider-Man was unaware of any seating arrangements and had sat in Clint’s spot. Tony hoped the archer wouldn’t be a dick about that when he got back from sandwich-making.
Tony got up onto the couch and flopped down with a new chew toy to gnaw while he rested his aching paws. He was finally feeling tired, and he just wanted to sleep. Clint and Natasha both gave him looks, though, and Natasha gestured for him to get off. Tony was still terrified of her, but he wasn’t even doing anything! What was so horrible about laying on the couch?
The building gave an ominous rumble and Tony barked, inching his way towards the door. They needed to
“These robots are kind of familiar, and I don’t mean just because they’re obviously stolen Stark tech.” Natasha pointed out a few minutes in, and everyone else scratched their chins about it until Spider-Man put his hand in the air.
“Relax, Cap. We’ve got his back.” Clint said, patting Steve reassuringly on the shoulder. Tony had a brief moment to realize that Steve had used his first name before they were being hustled outside and into the car. Steve stood on the porch with Bruce, arms crossed and face set in a frown, as they watched the van pull out and start towards SHIELD headquarters in D.C..
“What do we do?” Peter called, having sat down next to the agent. He was petting Bruce with one hand while he nervously fidgeted at the hem of his shirt with the other. Tony and Steve trotted over to meet them and Tony immediately went in for the phone, but Peter saw what he was doing and got to it first. “I’m calling Coulson this time.”
Tony laid there and watched as she stared through the wall. She would occasionally bring the mug to her mouth and sip, but it smelled cold, which meant she had been there awhile before Tony had woken up.
The first thing Tony did was create an entire new interface for interacting with JARVIS. It took hours to type up the relatively mediocre code- mostly because of his paws, but also because Steve was lounging on the table next to the keyboard, and he kept
“Shall I place an order for the necessary cat supplies?” The AI seemed to understand the situation perfectly fine, and Steve felt a small spark of pride for Tony’s ability to code. Phil cracked another smile.
“Are you alright?” Steve asked, and Tony hadn’t realized it was been directed at him until Steve nudged one of his paws. Tony cracked open an eye to see Steve giving him a frown.
“I would be mad that you went in against orders, but if you hadn’t, Natasha wouldn’t still be here.” Steve started, and Tony just let himself be carried through the streets and back to the quinjet.
“Well, Vivian, I’m Peter Parker. Nice to meet you.” It took Tony a few seconds to register the name, and he made sure to remember it. Once Tony was human again, this kid was getting a pay raise.
Steve adjusted his arms, one under Tony’s chest and one under his belly as he maneuvered them through the rubble and down to street-level.
“Oh, how old is he?”
“Tony-”
Finally,
“Coyote, are either of you hurt?” She said, louder, and Tony gave a single bark. Steve’s voice was distant as he started giving out orders. The backup must have finally arrived.
“I have returned from Asgard!” He boomed, startling Steve out of his chair. Tony barked in excitement and sat up, tail wagging. Thor walked over to him and dug something out of his pocket, holding out what looked like a leather collar.
No way. He’s been suspended and it’ll be too dangerous, he hasn’t even trained in his new body yet-”
An hour of running later and Tony was slightly less wound up. He went back to find the living room with only Natasha and Clint left, who were playing a board game on the coffee table.
Peter manhandled the phone out from under Tony without disrupting Natasha too much, which they all took a minute to stare at in amazement. Then he was explaining to Coulson what was going on, who didn’t sound very impressed.
“This is
“You horse-fucking
The summary of their mission; there was a strange energy signature at a building dead center in the abandoned town of Tocco Caudio, and SHIELD wanted to take a look. Tony would be going into the town solo with Clint and Natasha stationed a small ways back. He was to find the source of the energy, get readings, and get back out unless the circumstances were dangerous enough to warrant a full-scale takeover; another reason Clint and Natasha were on standby. They nearly got to the end of the briefing before Natasha suddenly spoke up.
Tony could admit that he too was guilty of it, but it all boiled down to one thing; trust. None of them trusted each other yet. Which was, quite frankly, ridiculous. They’d saved each other’s skins on the battlefield, but they would all rather cut off a finger or two than trust each other with their inner thoughts or more sensitive personal feelings.
“It’s alright, Steve. I know you didn’t do it on purpose.” Tony said, ears back as he refused to meet Steve’s eyes. God, he was pathetic, wasn’t he? A bath was all it took to send him running with his tail between his legs. Starks were supposed to be made of iron, strong and sturdy. He felt a bit like silver- brittle and fragile. Breakable. It was an awful feeling and he just wanted to crawl into a hole.
Loki!’ Tony tried to shout, but it only came out as a series of barks. Clint looked over at him and frowned while he pulled Loki’s arm over his shoulders to help him walk.
“We’re working around the clock to sort this out. Getting the Avengers back into commission is our top priority right now, so hopefully they’ll be back to normal relatively soon.” Coulson assured her, before they said their goodbyes and Peter hung up. There was a brief silence before JARVIS decided to move the elevator, taking them down to the holding level. Everyone but Pepper got off, and she gave them a short nod before the doors slid shut and she was lifted back up to the private quarters. Peter’s phone had been pocketed and he had Tony and Natasha cradled with both arms as they made their way down the hallway.
“Well, I was hoping I wouldn’t see you again so soon. You must be Doctor Banner-” Hannah held out her hand and after a beat, Bruce gently shook it. “I’m Hannah. I heard about what happened, but I think a first-person account would help me know what to look for.” She said, gently removing the mask while she started checking Tony’s eyes and gums as Steve cleared his throat. Her face was set in a frown as she thumbed soot off of Tony’s nose.
Tony stepped out of the shower feeling a bit better, and got dressed in a band t-shirt and jeans, planning on getting out of the house to clear his head. Dummy
Tony shouted, aiming it vaguely at the logo emblazoned uniform he could see through the slits in the carrier.
Harley came back in with a second nurse in tow, both carrying machines. They set them up while Hannah gave Tony the I.V, as well as hooking up a heartbeat monitor before she wrapped his wrist and let the other nurses handle the rest. Harley got Tony an oxygen mask that had a strap on the back and carefully fit his muzzle into it. The other nurse set a machine aside and plugged it in, though she didn’t do anything else with it.
“I forgot how much he used to talk. Never ending…” Clint went back to his card game with Natasha, who was offering Tony a soft smile. Steve snorted and shot Clint an exasperated look.
“We said back away! Failure to comply will result in the use of force!”
It made Tony feel better- enough to fall into a fitful sleep.
and get Peter’s attention, but the elevator shut with Tony still on it and continued up to the lab floor, JARVIS having assumed that Tony wanted to continue ascending.
“Widow? Status. Widow!” Steve barked, but there was no response. Clint swore a colorful streak and talked right over Steve when he was told to watch his profanity.
Tony was forced to sit and watch on a screen as the battle went on, listening to the comms and unable to do anything himself. It was torture.
“Wait, is he okay?” Spider-Man popped up from where he was slouched in a roll-y chair on his phone, sitting a little more professionally as Thor followed Natasha and Tony in.
“Lady Widow, please calm yourself. Loki casted a spell upon us all, including himself. We are safe at Anthony’s tower.” His voice was a low rumble, in contrast to his lean body and large ears. Steve wasn’t an expert on cats, but Thor didn’t even seem to be a normal housecat. Natasha looked at them all warily, before slinking forwards and pressing up against Clint’s side. He started to purr, and she looked at him with amusement.
“Well, then by all means, let us go speak with the man. He would be delighted to know of a dog such as yourself.” Thor started back up the driveway and Tony trotted behind, trying and failing to keep his tail from wagging. Progress!
Clint flopped down into a plastic chair and sighed.
‘I am the real Stark.’
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been out when he woke up. He was lying on the cool cement in what looked like an alley, nobody else in sight.
“What the hell is going on? Why are you all yelling?!”
After the front door closed with a soft
“Director, this smells like a training run. We could do something like this in our sleep.” She rested her fingers on the manilla folder she had been given, frowning. “What else is going on?”
“Sir, that cat is the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Stark Industries, and I’m going to have to ask where you acquired him, and how.” Peter’s body tensed- Tony could feel his arms going rigid, and he knew the kid was deciding between fight and flight. Tony was afraid that he was going to run (he had been angry about the arc reactor, and probably thought that this was the guy who had ‘experimented’ on Tony), but he remained in place, even when Coulson’s hand drifted down to rest on his gun holster. The group was only a few feet away by the time the cats started yelling.
“Alright, I’ll come help you with the jacket. I only want two of the foot so this is the last one.” Hannah disappeared from view and there was a pause before she came in through the door, taking off the lead jacket so that Tony could roll on his back. She put it back on and made sure it wouldn’t fall off before she left and went back to the control panel.
Tony started to panic, and he jumped off the couch, pacing around the outside of the circular room.
, and they all turned to see Steve trot back into the room holding Tony’s holo-phone in his mouth.
The air was thick and acrid but Tony was low enough to be underneath the smoke as they made their way to the steps, painstakingly climbing over rubble and around the flames. The building was rumbling again when they reached the second floor, and they broke into an almost-run, being as careful as they could while moving as fast as the debris would let them. Tony was thankful for his new lungs; the arc reactor had damaged a lot of his human lungs, and he would have already been out for the count if he’d gone in without the suit.
“O-okay!” The spider-kid called, and when Tony craned his head around Natasha’s shoulder, he was swinging back into the fray.
, who the fuck did Steve think he was? He’d locked Tony out of his own lab, and was treating him like an animal! None of them even seemed concerned that JARVIS was offline. Tony was always on edge without his AI; every door slam and footstep was someone infiltrating until Tony had confronted them and found the noise to be from another Avenger. It was driving him nuts and the others seemed perfectly at ease.
The others started to trickle into the room around nine; first Clint, then Natasha, and finally Bruce. He looked like he’d stuck his finger in an electrical socket, but none of them asked, instead pointing him towards the fresh coffee.
“He did not inflict it upon himself with purpose. The Man of Iron interrupted the spell, causing it to rebound upon the caster himself.” Steve suddenly stood up straighter, looking around the roof again.
“He is only able to answer yay or nay questions, lady Romanov. Perhaps his intentions will become more clear once we unite him with friend Anthony.” Thor said, moving forward towards the hallway that lead to the basement stairwell.
“What in the
“Coulson, it isn’t Tony…” Steve muttered, coming right up to stand next to the unconscious black cat. Phil looked sad, which Steve thought was strange- he and Tony hadn’t seemed particularly close. He lifted up the cat and cradled him, pressing his ear against the little chest. He frowned again, though this time it was thoughtful.
“Two agents being deployed to coordinates, comms active.” The pilot- agent- who had grabbed a gun slammed the button to open the doors, taking off at a brisk run with Tony right on her heels. The other pilot was probably required to stay with the jet in case of hostiles or anyone needing medical attention.
“Clint and I will stay with her.” Natasha called, and Tony lifted his tail gratefully. The rest of them trotted back to the house and started poking around carefully. There were signs of Peter, but nothing recent. He’d obviously been at the house sometime in the morning, but every scent was stale enough that there was no way he’d come this way after noon.
“You can’t have people food, Stark. The kibble is good for you.” Steve wasn’t backing down, and Tony felt a surge of fury, snarling as he turned and kicked the bowl across the room, scattering the dog food all over the kitchen. Clint stood up and started to bitch him out, while Natasha came around the table to pick him up and haul him kicking and barking away from the mess.
“We tried talking to that new cat.” Peter added around a mouthful of food, not looking up from where he was making notes and munching down on some bagel bites. “I guess she didn’t say anything, but it doesn’t hurt to keep trying.” He said, this time through what had to be at least two bagel bites and possibly a third. Tony wrinkled his nose and redirected his attention to Pepper, who was much more pleasant to hold a conversation with.
“If you could bring him back with me-” She pulled the curtain aside and gestured for them to follow her. “He’ll need x-rays before I’m one hundred percent sure if the ligaments have been torn or not. They don’t seem to be, but better safe than sorry. And I need to see if there’s been any fluid buildup in his lungs.” Hannah waited as Steve scooped Tony up and then they were heading through the halls and towards the wing labelled ‘Radiology and Imaging’.
; he’d socialized with the team around dinner-time, but elected to take an early night, after his fitful napping throughout the day hadn’t brought any relief to his anxiety. By now he was relatively relaxed, and had been sleeping rather soundly if the crust in the corners of his eyes was anything to go by.
“No, not from what I saw. Just aggressive. It wasn’t mangey looking or anything so either it was a lost pet, or someone ditched it. Not our purview.” Clint said, looking over at Natasha. She gave a small nod, and they started back towards the quinjet.
as Tony’s back hit the sandy bottom.
“It’ll be quick, I’ll just run some hot water to melt off the snow and we’ll do shampoo to get the dirt out of your fur. Fast and easy.” Steve said, turning on the tap and putting the lever on hot while Tony bit back several insults about Steve being
“Or- and get this- we go back to the tower so we don’t leak any. Classified. Information.” Coulson gritted out, making the whole table go quiet.
- and it didn’t get better from there. He’d only be able to manage five or six beats of silence before he was shifting again, making Clint rub his eyes and causing Steve’s fingers to twitch where they were holding his book.
“You haven’t torn anything, so you won’t need surgery. Just a really bad sprain.” She began, pointing at the image of his foot that Tony couldn’t make heads nor tails of.
Before Tony could make it to the doorway of the kitchen, he suddenly realized there was more than one person in the lobby. Rather, at least half a dozen sets of feet were padding quietly into the mansion through the front door.
(See the end of the chapter for
after what he pulled at the Stark Expo several years ago.
“I’ll bring you some more later, we want to make sure you don’t get sick before we give you a ton.” Steve tucked the tupperware back into his bag and Tony laid back down on his side, since he wouldn’t be going anywhere anyways and sitting up was making him feel groggy.
He didn’t seem to realize that the cats were the actual Avengers- and Tony was anticipating the look on his face when he put two and two together.
“Poor dog. So many people will get a German Shepherd because they see them on TV. Nobody realizes how hard they are to train…” Clint’s voice trailed off as Loki and him left the alley.
So the collar was set on the floor by Steve’s foot and he got Tony completely soaked, going fast like he said he would. He lathered Tony up and worked the remaining clumps of snow out of his fur, dipping his hands in the water to get off the suds when he was done.
“What? What is that?” He asked, looking at Harley while he pointed at the dormant machine. The nurse turned and smiled from where he was checking the readings on the monitors.
“What makes you think I’m going to tell you anything?” Loki hissed, leaving his back to them and hunching in on himself. Shield had fabricated a miniature version of the Hulk-Buster about the size of a dog kennel, and gave one to each of their ‘guests’. Neither were pleased.
After a few seconds he tried flexing the muscles in his throat, and was pleased to hear a deep rumbling start up in his chest. Tony was awarded a watery smile.
“Come on, Tony, let’s go back upstairs.” Bruce said, scratching behind Tony’s ears. It had the opposite effect of what Bruce was aiming for, and Tony simply sprawled himself out on the cool concrete floor. Clint was still acting weird but he too started to pet down Tony’s back almost absent-mindedly. Tony wasn’t going back upstairs; once they stopped petting him, he was going to figure out what Loki had done to JARVIS, and get him operational again. They were sitting ducks without him protecting the mansion.
He whipped his head around and spotted Steve ripping apart a robot. In his distraction, Tony didn’t dodge out of the way of a falling suit, and the explosion from right behind knocked him all the way across the road.
“Everything is good. Coyote is green, open the doors.” He called, and the quinjet doors dropped with a soft hiss.
Three hours later and Tony was planted on the couch, bark-yelling at Linda, because that shade of red did
“So my first complaint, is that you won’t let me back in my lab. It’s like if I locked all of you outside, in the rain, with only socks on. It’s terrible and I’d like it to be rectified immediately.” Tony said, sitting up straight and puffing out his chest so that they could tell how serious he was.
” The group of cats switched from chuckling to groaning, but Tony loved it.
Tony made to back up but he couldn’t force himself to move. His heart was racing and he was frozen, staring at the blue anomaly in this small pocket in time, where nothing moved or breathed besides him. Tony felt like he was somewhere he wasn’t supposed to be, that something besides himself owned that place and didn’t want him there. He felt like he was being watched and he was equally afraid of both turning his back on the tesseract, and keeping his back to the not-so-empty expanse of the room behind him.
He was getting terribly frustrated at how limited his life was so suddenly. Dog’s didn’t have a language, and all the noises like barks and growls and yelps conveyed emotion more so than actual words. Tony quite literally couldn’t speak.
“Sure. Clint, can you come with me? I won’t be able to carry everything myself.”
“This is so tight, how are you two-” Natasha was cut off with a yelp as she toppled off the counter and landed heavily on a barstool. Clint started to laugh his ass off from across the room and Steve poked his head over the edge to check on her. He almost got his nose scratched for the effort, but at least she hadn’t hit the floor. Coulson and Maria wrangled Thor and Clint while Bruce helped Natasha, and Steve watched the whole thing from his perch on the fridge.
It was just like space. Silent, pitch-black, and lonely. Tony started to hyperventilate and he circled the room as he tried to think, tried not to look in the corners where his brain tried to trick him into thinking that shadows moved.
Natasha and Clint were waiting at the door to let them in, and nobody spoke as they brushed themselves off and wiped their feet.
That was kinda dramatic but basically I haven't given up and I'm still going strong. Please leave a kudos or a comment if you enjoyed! I really really love feedback and I respond to all the comments I get, whether you have a question or are just sending kind words. Thanks for sticking around!
“That black cat is Loki, isn’t it?” He realized, squinting over at the bundle of fur that was laying on Loki’s green outfit. That meant…
Bruce walked back in and settled himself on the floor next to Tony, busying himself with wrapping the ankle. Steve and Natasha eventually wandered off and the two of them were left alone in a companionable silence. Tony licked Bruce right on the cheek as thanks, and he chuckled, wiping the slobber off on his shoulder.
wrong. He couldn’t even hear the ever-present hum of the reactor.
“Damn.” Clint said, padding over and sitting down. Steve nodded, wishing he could help as Phil struggled to manage the squirming bag and tidy at the same time. The other Avengers were wandering around the room and surveying the mess. Natasha trotted out from behind the couch and joined them on the coffee table.
“Here, can you tell us what happened?” Bruce asked, dropping their handy paper roll and paints on the smooth floor of the kitchen. He helpfully opened the black and dropped a dollop for Tony to use.
“I have no idea what you just said or why you’re so excited, but I uh, I wanted to say thanks. For ya’know, helping out Aunt May, and stuff. I-I was really worried.” Peter stuttered, lifting Tony off his shoulder and re-positioning him so they could see each other face-to-face. From his new angle Tony could clearly see the left side of Peter’s face had taken a beating- he was bruised from temple to chin, and his bottom lip was cut. He’d also obviously been to medical if the butterfly bandages on his face were anything to go by.
Tony wiggled himself free of the safety harness and whined, pawing at the locker where they had stored his kevlar vest and other gear. The pilots glanced at him and said nothing, though one of them raised the ramp so that Tony couldn’t just run off.
“What happened? Why is there a bloody rag in your bed?” He asked, frantically patting down Tony’s sides and then his face, which caused a full-body flinch from the contact of hands on his cut. Steve parted his fur gently and sucked in a breath through his teeth. “Well that can’t feel good. What the hell happened?” Steve asked, turning Tony’s head to look him in the eye. “Where did your collar go?” He frowned as he felt the fur around Tony’s neck.
“Thanks, JARVIS. Me too.”
Tony wasn’t sure how much time had passed before there was a small commotion in the foyer. Someone had come to visit, and the team was gathered to talk with them. Tony didn’t even bother lifting his head until he heard the distinctive clack of heels entering the kitchen. He smelled Pepper, and his heart lifted. She could always make him feel better.
Clint got up and walked over, frowning in disbelief when he saw what Thor was holding.
Tony lifted his lips before he realized he was doing it, and then forced his face to relax. He’d been slowly using more and more dog-like behaviors as the day wore on. Such as chewing on sticks and wagging his tail when he’d smelled a food truck earlier. Tony chastised himself and almost missed Steve and the woman turning to look at him.
“Laundry Day?” Bruce asked, and Tony let out his breath in a
It was pretty simple; there were four different readers strapped to his sides, with a small transmitter and a GoPro on his back, so the rest of them could see what was going on. He had a modified Comm unit in his ear, but none of them were really sure if it would stay in since it had been a bit jerry-rigged at the last second.
Tony didn’t bother giving it any further thought. Instead, he threw caution to the wind and scrambled up the shelves to reach the ceiling. He had to be careful not to disturb the tile the device was sitting on, or it could drop to the floor.
“What, you know her?” Natasha murmured. All eyes besides Loki’s settled on Thor.
Nobody dared argue. Bruce caved to Tony’s puppy-dog eyes (or maybe was still feeling sorry for him), and occasionally slipped him pieces of cheese and pepperoni when Steve wasn’t looking.
“Unpleasant.” Tony griped, absently rubbing his tail against Steve’s. Bruce huffed in agreement.
As Tony entered the room, he was disappointed to find that he wasn’t alone. Everyone was there eating breakfast. Clint looked over his coffee mug to take in Tony’s drooping tail and hunched posture, and watched as he wandered over to his dog bed to flop down with his back to them.
“Is there also some top-secret reason that Iron Man has been gone for a couple months? The press keeps speculating that he’s been wounded within an inch of his life, or that he has like, a brain tumor, or something. So everyone is really worried… He’s okay, right?” Spider-Man rambled, then his shoulders hunched as the team all stared at him. Pepper had been trying to reign in the press, but she could only do so much. They just had to deflect and pray this kid didn’t manage to add two and two together to equal
sulking about his Daddy Issues when he heard a car pull up. The gravel crunched as two people walked up to the front door, and Tony was about to jump up and sound the alarm when a key was turned in the lock and he heard Clint complaining about something.
Tony loved his science bro.
Steve looked pissed, but he didn’t say anything, instead getting on comms to talk to the SHIELD agents in charge of cleanup and medical assistance. JARVIS spoke up in Tony’s private comm line while everyone else wandered away to help the agents organize the chaos.
Hi! Looks like our four legged friend is going to get some action soon. I also want to put in a brief warning, because there's a sentence that mentions gagging, like the sick kind. Tony just really hates dog food. Also, either in this chapter or the next one, there's brief reference to off-camera (so to speak) yarfing of said dog food. I personally have a v*mit phobia soooo i do my best to be considerate in case anyone else does too. Thank you for reading- see you next week!
Tony used the claws on his right paw to slowly spell out the word ‘Tony’, looking up at Thor hopefully while the god frowned and stroked his beard.
“When did this happen? Where?” He took over Steve’s spot, looking through Tony’s fur to find the scabbed cut.
Tony barked, crawling underneath burning wood and plaster to her head and licking the soot off her face. It tasted disgusting but it was worth it when she stirred, coughing weakly as she blinked up at him.
Steve fell back behind Maria and Coulson, instead trotting between Thor and Natasha. They both gave him disappointed looks, and he returned them. The team was a bit demoralized after finding the armor and then absolutely nothing. Bruce and Clint were quiet (maybe because of Clint’s deafness and Bruce not knowing morse code, but either way, everyone was a bit put-out), and Steve wasn’t really sure what to say to bring up their spirits.
“I agree with Tony. Spider-Man is much too young.” Natasha piped up, swiveling her chair around from where she was manipulating the holo-screens.
, and after the events of the days before, Tony had settled into a depression that seemed ready to stay. At least Pepper made it a little easier, stroking the fur of his back and humming sadly.
“Coyote- one bark for yes, two for no. Is Widow there with you?” Finley asked, and Tony gave a single bark. Clint sucked in a sharp breath but the agent talked over him.
Tony had no idea how long he long he laid there in the sink cabinet, where he’d wedged himself in the corner on top of the pile of clean towels. He shook like a leaf and watched himself take the nuke into space again, and again, and again. It was torture. At one point he’d just shut his eyes and let it happen; it must be some kind of karma. There was a reason he was being put through hell again and again, and he just had to face it.
In other words, Tony lasted two days before he tipped over a trash can and went at the spilled contents like it was Thanksgiving at the Jarvis’ residence.
“Alright! We’re done with that. Let’s get some sleep, and in the morning we'll go meet up with the others and try talking to the batshit-insane gods in the basement.” Tony said, leading the way to the elevator as Peter hurried along behind him.
“So now that Peter knows, we can keep him, right?” Tony asked. Natasha let out a half-snort and Steve sighed, as if he’d resigned himself to his fate.
“Yea?”
Footsteps padded down the hall towards the room, and he closed the application just in time for Peter to stroll back in. He looked curiously at the cat, before scooping him off the desk and petting his head.
envy whoever was going to clean that up.
There were several voices at that point and he struggled harder because they were angry. They were going to hold him under until he drowned because he wouldn’t do what they wanted. Tony felt his resolve crumble. He would beg, he would crawl, he would do whatever they wanted because he didn’t want to die in a cave with a battery wired to his chest and his head submerged in a bucket of water.
They all sat down in their usual spots and the meeting went relatively smooth, minus the occasional bark from Tony that they had to try and interpret as best they could. They all walked away slightly irritated as per the usual.
interrupted Tony’s train of thought. Another suit had landed right behind him, and was raising a weaponized hand to shoot at him.
And that was
Tony replied.
“Okay, can we get a roll of pap-” Steve began, but uncharacteristically cut himself off when he made eye contact with Tony. He tilted his head at Steve as if to say,
Apparently, Tony needed everything. They got him toys, brushes, bath soap (which would never be used if Tony had anything to say about it), a leash and harness, nail clippers, a bed (why the hell couldn’t he use his own?), dog food (no way would Tony be eating that crap), and finally, a few shirts. Clint actually picked out a Hawkeye hoodie and chased Tony halfway across the store before he could get it on him. Once it was on Tony found that he didn’t really mind it, so he allowed it to stay while they took pity on him and grabbed an Iron Man hoodie as well.
“No, but there was someone else there when I got to the energy signature. It was too dark to tell if it was human or not, but it was around the right height. It moved kinda funny though, it was too fluid and quick to be a person, I think. It was like one of the shadows got up and started slinking around.” Tony explained, both Clint and Natasha frowning at him.
Tony felt embarrassed listening to it back, but Peter’s eyes were all doe-y and awed when the clip ended.
“Vitals appear stable and non-threatening. I’m glad you’re alright, Sir.” JARVIS’s voice always helped to reassure Tony, and he sighed, letting his shoulders slump a little inside the suit.
Loki dropped his illusion and went back to looking like himself in full ensemble, pulling an Asgardian knife out of a pocket in his robes. He tightened his grip on Tony and pointed the blade at the assembled heroes. Tony growled and turned his head, more than ready to bite Loki right on his smug looking face.
“Basically?” Bruce chuckled, and Tony gave a small roll of his eyes.
Tony thought, glaring at Steve.
“Crying is a healthy way of dealing with emotions, you know. Everyone does it.” Tony added, and Clint gave one last sniff before he seemed to compose himself.
Tony stopped in his tracks and barked, making Clint jump nearly a foot in the air. He whipped around and then relaxed when he didn’t see anything abnormal, instead glaring at Tony.
“What gives?” Steve shouted, tail lashing in anger for a moment before it smacked Tony in the face. “Sorry.”
“He’s an interesting dude. Do you think we should offer him a spot on the team?” Bruce asked, switching his hand on the ice to prevent his fingers from freezing. Tony growled softly at the suggestion, firmly in
He gasped from the pain in his head, and had to sit and breathe for a few moments, shaking as he tried to control the pain. It eventually subsided and he sighed. Apparently, Loki had been casting a spell in addition to the scepter’s powers. He hated that asshat.
“Well, I can’t say I’m not surprised. Wait…” He looked down at the bundled up cape, and his face got a bit paler. Steve had never seen him have such a reaction, and it caused a silent ripple of unease to go through the assembled cats.
“Jeez, you’re a handful. Slow down for a second!” Peter gave the leash a little tug, and Tony started going side to side to sniff the grass instead of pulling obnoxiously. “I guess we should have gone out earlier. It’s almost dinner time, we’ll have to be back in an hour.” Tony did most of the steering, leading them as directly to Avengers Tower as he could. A few people gave them strange looks, but New Yorkers were pretty used to weird things, so the majority of passers-by didn’t even look twice. Peter started to get antsy as they got into busier streets, and finally he slowed to a stop, almost directly in front of the shawarma place. They were so close!
Tony didn’t sleep, but he let the noises around him fade away as he solved equations and drew schematics in his head.
“Hey, Brucie-bear. How ya’ been?” Tony said tiredly, letting himself be examined and rolled over until Bruce found where he was bleeding.
“The coding runs impeccably, as it was assumed to.” JARVIS informed. “Mr. Parker also requested to be notified when you were finished working, and will be down momentarily.”
“I’ve got to go check something in the lab, but I’ll be back up again in a bit.” He said, shuffling out of the foyer and leaving Tony alone with Steve.
That… was Steve. Right! Steve was there! Tony dragged his head up, and wrenched his eyes open to see Steve frantically shaking him and holding the shield over them like a shrapnel umbrella. His face was covered in grime, and his eyes were wide and alert. Scared.
Hey all!! This marks the point where Mr. Parker joins the fray. I always imagine and characterize Spider-man as the Tom Holland version, but I don't think it'll change much if you preferred him to be Garfield or McGuire, besides that May (if she makes an appearance) will be characterized and aged as the Marisa version of May. Okay, without further rambling, please enjoy the chapter!
“We were pretty close to the mansion- touching down now.” Natasha announced, everyone grabbing a hand bar to keep steady through the jolt.
“Look at me! Pet me, please!” Steve called, backing up a bit and sitting down while May bent and petted the top of his head. Tony snickered to himself and started typing while she cooed at Steve and asked him a few questions in baby-talk.
Tony sighed, listening to the heart monitor beep as his thoughts turned over one another.
elsewhere.
They all pushed up as hard as they could, collectively wheezing with effort while Thor gently pulled May clear by the back of her shirt. He yowled to tell them they were safe, and the group crawled back out, Steve with his shoulder propping it up until the last cat was clear.
Clint walked back and forth between the kitchen and the bedrooms for nearly an hour while Tony subtly spied on him. The archer didn’t seem to care; he actually looked a bit tense. His eyebrows were drawn and he kept spinning an arrow between his fingers. Tony was just about to get up and investigate when he smelled fresh cookies.
“Widow, there’s a batch making their way up 44th.” Tony warned, shooting up and over the buildings towards the center of the chaos. Thor, Hulk, and him were taking care of the biggest cluster while Clint tracked the smaller groups that broke off, and Natasha and Steve maintained the the perimeter. It was almost a week since their last battle and this time they were fighting back hordes of large, vicious grasshoppers. And Tony wasn’t one to exaggerate the mundane, so when he said that the grasshoppers were large and angry, he meant that they were all the size of your average sofa and desperate for destruction. They chewed and ate anything they could. Including, but not limited to: street signs, parked cars, lamp posts, buildings, humans, parking meters, outdoor patio furniture, each other (Tony gagged when he discovered that one), and deadly flying suits of metal. Tony had already lost a thigh plate and a few shoulder plates to the beasts. They couldn’t necessarily fly, but they could jump and glide high enough to snatch Tony unsuspectingly out of the sky. He did his level best not to get grabbed again but it was a bit inevitable, since he couldn’t watch all of them at once.
Tony took a step or two forward and paused again. The entire thing was giving him the heebie-jeebies; the only noise was his breathing and his nails clicking on the wood, and the tesseract was resting by itself on the end of an abandoned wall of scaffolding, in a silent church in a dead town in the hills of southern Italy. Something was wrong and Tony could feel it crawling up and down his spine like cold skeleton hands, fingers dragging through his fur and making him shiver.
As the day wore on, Tony got more and more anxious. Had Pepper seen his message? What if it was sorted as spam, and none of them were actually looking for him? By mid-afternoon he was pacing and lashing his tail, while Peter absentmindedly clicked away on his laptop. It got to the point where Tony was getting a bruise on his tail where it kept hitting things, and Peter was getting annoyed by the constant
“Who the hell is that, did he kidnap-”
When night-time rolled around again, and the others had to leave, Tony despaired to find out that Natasha was being released before he was.
They were all disappointed that Loki was hiding so well, but there wasn’t much they could do about it.
“If you ever tell anyone that I cried, no-obody will find your body.” Clint said, though it was an empty threat and he hiccuped halfway through it anyhow. Tony nodded solemnly.
“It’s an intubator, in case he stops breathing on his own. It looks different from a regular intubator since it’s standard issue for a vet’s office instead of a hospital.” Harley said, going back to his clipboard. Clint made a face.
“JARVIS, what’s in here? Where did he get it from?” Tony sniffed the blender, but it smelled fine, nothing strange or any traces of anything unfit to be in a fruit smoothie (such as asparagus, but Tony tended not to remind himself of the numerous fruit-veggie smoothies from Dummy, which always tasted horrendous).
“I’m in! Petey, prepare to have your mind blown.” Tony crowed. Clint made a comment under his breath, but it was too quiet for Tony to hear.
“Got it, be there in a sec.” Bruce lowered the phone when Steve hung up, and made an unenthusiastic face at Tony. “Hopefully they can keep this under control, but I have to go just in case they need me.
Tony rolled his head to look at Clint. He was staring off at the far wall with a scowl on his face, though he wasn’t fidgeting with his bow like usual. Tony figured it wasn’t a good sign and he made a growl-bark noise, nudging Clint’s hand with his nose.
“Why would he do this to himself? And why haven’t they woken up yet?” Steve could feel the tip of his tail twitching, and he willed it to stay still. Thor’s was waving back and forth wildly in agitation.
“Well, alright. You’re free to go. There should be a quinjet waiting on the airstrip to escort you back to New York.” He said, leaving the room with a dramatic swish of his cape. Tony gave one last sympathetic look to the agent before he hopped off his chair and left, making his way to the lobby and then up to the hanger where the quinjets lived.
Tony made a decision and leapt out of one of the shattered windows, making a break for the yard’s fence. Half of it was destroyed so he easily shot off of the property into the streets.
“...don’t know. What isn’t he telling us?” Steve grunted, landing hit after hit on the bag, and rocking it so hard Tony was afraid it was going to pull right out of the beam it was hooked into.
It was dark, and cold, and once again Tony was forced to stare at the wormhole and re-live his near death, shaking and curled in on himself in the corner so soon after the night before.
“The Fantastic Four are officially on call, in case something happens while the Avengers are out of commission. And since I highly doubt any of you are going to be staying behind, I’ve gone ahead and procured the necessary supplies.” Coulson informed them, rifling through a box by the fridge and coming up with six tiny flak jackets. Steve lifted his tail in excitement while every other cat groaned.
“Feel free to rough him up a bit, so he doesn’t forget our terms. Make sure not to wake anyone else.” Loki hissed to his men, and Tony bit down on his tongue as a few feet kicked him sharply in the ribs and back. When Loki returned to the room, he waved them off towards the front door. With a glint of silver he crouched above Tony once more and sliced his cheek, then through the leather of his collar, departing with it in hand. Almost instantly he felt blood welling up and dripping warmly through his fur. Tony just breathed, in and out, careful not to make a peep despite the burning ache in his cheek and throat.
He hadn’t called New York his
being an asshole, and that he was still an asset, he could do that. If he did what they wanted he could still be an Avenger.
Small things like that continued to happen. Members of the team would shove him off furniture, or yell at him for making noise, or shut him out of rooms they didn’t want him in, like his workshop, or his own bedroom. They wouldn’t let him outside as an alternative, either.
With renewed hope Tony picked up his pace. Four streets away, then three. As he came upon the second to last crossroad, something heavy knocked him away from his goal, driving the breath right out of his lungs. He couldn’t see the group of Shield agents any longer, but he prayed they were hurrying to help. Tony could hardly move as his chest spasmed and he stared into the barrel of the robot’s wrist-mounted MP-5.
when things didn’t go your way. What was the point of that if you’re not even going to tell us what’s going on?” Tony scoffed and earned himself a harsh nudge from Thor. Clint snickered from the back and Tony would have challenged him to fisticuffs if the situation weren't supposed to be serious.
“Dude,
While they were waiting, Clint found them and filled them in on Natasha. She was going into surgery to have rods put in her leg, but she would be alright after some rest. They would be keeping her overnight to watch her breathing and make sure it didn’t get any worse.
What was big enough? Tony wasn’t able to do much as a dog. At least nothing obvious like a banner that read ‘I am Tony Stark, stop throwing things at me’. He wouldn’t have enough time to get all the way up to the front door, let alone spell in the dirt. Tony
Tony rolled his head back and perked his ears, watching as she approached him and crouched down with an exasperated expression on her face. The rest of the team milled around and Clint started to make lunch with the help of Steve. Pepper ran a hand over Tony’s head and his tail started wagging back and forth with the first glimpse of joy he’d seen in days.
Before Coulson could get much farther, Peter’s face started to scrunch a bit. At first Tony thought he was incredibly uncomfortable, but the kid kept accidentally smiling, so it was obviously more of a matter of him trying to be composed and failing horrendously. Tony was about to ask when Coulson’s phone gave an angry chirp.
The message read. Steve nodded, thoughtfully tapping at his chin.
‘Alpha-10-36-Foxtrot-Delta-Green-28-78-58-18.’
“The only times he’s been actively violent were Afghanistan, and cleaning up Obadiah's mess afterwards. There was also an instance or two during his Palladium poisoning, but other than that, the fighting was all self-defense or Avengers work. Are you telling me that Tony, Tony Stark,
“I know, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.” The teen turned on his puppy eyes and dialed them up to full blast. Tony was done for.
“Tony, stop, take a deep breath. Stop struggling, you’re safe, you’re in New York. Take a breath and count to three, okay?” Rhodey said, and Tony slowed down, trying to get air in past the metal sitting heavy on his lungs-
Hannah spoke like she knew Natasha personally, so Steve seemed to ditch the act and he went straight to the point.
“Stark, you’ve been barking for hours. What the heck do you want?” Steve walked up behind the couch, and Tony watched him observe the scene for a few moments before he suddenly
“Would you like to be the Avengers’ temporary handler?” The cats all balked at him, and Peter started to stutter a bit.
Tony gave himself a quick pep-talk before he walked back out onto the sidewalk. It was busy as always, and he did his best to stay on the edge and avoid getting stepped on. Numerous children tried to pet him and Tony let them, unless they had sticky hands. He didn’t like the thought of trying to get a sucker out of the fur on his back.
