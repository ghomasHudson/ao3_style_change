“Show off,” Dean teased. He reached for a dry cloth to polish off the car whilst Castiel traversed the garage, perhaps taking the time to look at its contents for the first time.

Cas heard it in the crack in Dean’s voice when he whispered his name. He heard the buried cries inside Dean that wanted to get out. And he knew that with time, those cries would mollify and then finally cease to exist. But only if he left and gave time a chance.
Somehow, though, Dean suspected his hope would be short-lived. That break was likely never coming again.
“I’m here,” Cas promised.
“Good. Let’s keep it that way,” Dean squeezed Cas’ shoulder gently. “You’ve got to treat yourself better. This whole thing with the angels… we’ll work it out.”
Laying back, he tilted his head to the side and stared out the grey windshield. The windows around him had fogged and all that could be heard was the rain against metal and the heavy whoosh of the wind just outside. Cas was completely encased by the wretched solitude. He closed his eyes and curled up tightly into a ball, urging the back of the seat to somehow act as a substitute for Dean’s robust chest. But it was too solid and cold against his back. The faux leather didn’t mimic soft, warm skin. Nothing about it held him the way Dean did. His own arms against his chest couldn’t suffice for Dean’s protective embrace.
Though of course he had never been so dim as to not see the external, physical pleasures that ensued from it.
“With a dance to match?”
But he tried anyway.
But Dean made it possible to cast those anxieties away. To banish them for a little while.
“On what you think I’ve been doing.”
“You’re welcome,” Cas said. He zipped up the duffel bag, focusing all his attention on the task so he had an excuse for avoiding Dean’s gaze. The hunter was looking at him again with the same intensity that he reserved for times of immense concern. He was worried about Castiel. Or perhaps
“You have to drink it. Otherwise, you’ll get dehydrated,” Dean said. He settled himself at Castiel’s side with his legs crossed and gently rubbed Cas’ back in comforting circular motions.
Thanks for reading, guys! Sorry it has been such a long wait! I just got back from a holiday to go to a Supernatural convention (which was amazing by the way!!). Hopefully, chapters will be uploaded more consistently from now on, but with Christmas fast approaching, I will be busy at work a lot. But we shall see :)
“I didn’t—,” Cas started.
“Oh,” Cas mumbled, hitching the duffel bag up more firmly on his shoulder. Dean shook his head fondly and held the door open so Cas could enter first. The room was exactly what the rest of the motel promised; the walls painted slapdashedly yellow and the carpet a hideous green.
Castiel once again obliged him and walked round to the passenger seat without question or argument. He had to admit that a day void of anything real and awful and serious appealed greatly to him. He nodded once in quiet agreement.
just the way Dean had done. His fingers traced the wood with just as much care and grace, almost as if he already knew what it meant.
“There aren’t words, Dean,” Castiel decided finally, “there isn’t a fair way to describe my feelings for you.”
. But not if you don’t want to. If you don’t feel up to dealing with those—” Dean cut himself off midsentence, shook his head, and tried again. “With the angels. Then you don’t have to.”
“For the past two days, he’s completely opened up about his world. The estimated ratio of angels to demons, what threats there are, how everything devolved into chaos in the first place,” Sam said. He had noticeably perked up, the anxiety in his voice wavering.
It was where he was most comfortable.
“Well, aren’t you lucky?” Cas jested, trying to lighten the mood so perhaps he would regain stability in his suddenly weak knees. Still, he couldn’t meet Dean’s eyes, and he fiddled nervously with a loose thread from the hem of his t-shirt, as though completely enthralled by the fraying fibre.
The windscreen wipers were on their fastest setting and yet it was near impossible to see where they were positioned on the road or whether any cars were approaching them from the opposite lane. Castiel couldn’t afford to be careless but Dean was making it difficult to focus with his cheek pressed to his bare shoulder, his breath warm against his skin. This was the closest they had been all week since that drunken night together in the back seat. In that time, with Dean dedicated entirely to the case, Cas had been left alone with his own thoughts.
“That’s bullshit,” Dean said quickly, “distancing yourself from us doesn’t make our lives any safer. More the opposite, actually.”
Dean had only intended for it to be brief and warm; enough to make his point clear and to shatter her interest. But it seemed Castiel hadn’t made the connection and assumed that the kiss had come out of nowhere. He turned into Dean and held his waist tightly, deepening the kiss without pause and robbing the control right out from under the hunter.
That tape too burned. Its ashes were swept away by the wind. That gift—the memory of home. The memory of Dean—washed away with Cas that day. And maybe it was with him still. Maybe Cas somehow knew in death that Dean hadn’t forgotten him. And Dean had forgiven him for all the trials and tribulations they endured together; for all the mistakes that were made.
What had Sam done to threaten a creature powerful enough to withstand him?
“I freaking love you.”
Dean was a solid and infallible thing that hardships and loss couldn’t break. He would never be in eternal disrepair. Cas knew that for sure, and he was comforted by that thought. It reassured him to know that leaving could never tarnish Dean; he couldn’t leave a scar that would never heal.
And that night, he saw Cas again, this time at the window, standing solemnly in the storm.
Barely a minute later, Castiel heard a struggle inside the cabin with wood breaking and glass shattering. He didn’t hesitate as he scurried out of the car and retrieved a machete from the trunk, his hand remarkably steady despite his racing heart. There was no time to question anything; it was Dean in that cabin, and that was all that mattered.
But then he started to feel queasy and his face turned a little pale. He lowered the magazine and closed it without much thought as to whether he had actually finished reading the article or not.
Sam nudged Dean’s arm and shot him a questioning look, clearly confused as to how and when Castiel became interested in music. Dean dismissed him with a small shake of his head, but Sam persisted and nudged him again harder. Dean couldn’t begin to explain it. Sam looked afraid almost—or rather worried. Sam’s brow furrowed and his jaw clenched as if forcing himself not to say whatever horrible things he was thinking. Dean had no idea what they were, but he knew he wouldn’t wish to hear them. He turned up the music a little bit, making it clear to Sam that he refused to discuss it here—or probably anywhere. Sam sighed and shifted closer to his window.
Dean slipped past Sam and went into the bathroom. In the privacy of those four walls, Dean only then began to realise the weight of his decisions. He began to see the future that loomed ahead of them, and the dangers that threatened to capsize their lives.
Benny finally got a sense of Dean’s history with the mysterious angel, and whatever Dean didn’t say in words, Benny understood in context. Even as he eased up, Dean seemed especially careful of what he said about Castiel. As if he was afraid Benny would think poorly of him before they actually got the chance to meet. And Benny noticed how Dean specifically darted around the topic of what exactly he thought or felt about Cas. His words were very on the nose recollections of how Cas gripped him tight and raised him from perdition, and how the angel had turned against heaven for Dean and the greater good, and how he stuck by the Winchester’s through the apocalypse that the brother’s, together, had started.
Sam rinsed off the last plate and carefully set it down on the dish rack before wiping his hands dry on a kitchen cloth. Dean watched on, only mildly interested, and that was only due to every other stimuli in the room being far too overwhelming for his sensitive eyes. Every surface was reflecting the ceiling lights back at him, feeding his pounding headache until he felt it in his stomach. When Sam turned to face him, he diverted his gaze to the tiles at his feet and had to repress the urge to be sick.
Cas put on a load of washing and left it to complete its cycle, taking a shower and shaving his face whilst he waited. The effort still felt like his feet were buried in cement; as if he were dragging the weight with every step. He tried to ignore the sensation and did as he knew he ought to. He took care of himself. Cas changed into a fresh pair of pyjamas, recognising them as one of Sam’s pair of pants—the legs were far too long and bunched up at the ankles, almost tripping him at his feet—and Dean’s shirt. It smelt like him: like spiced cologne and whiskey. He pulled at the waistband of his pants every now and then as he walked to Dean’s room, aware that he could slip at any moment, but he paused at his door.
Dean refused to bow to something seemingly so innocent, yet so freaking dangerous. For years, the scent of heavy liquor made his stomach churn and his head reel. It was the natural instinct that found him whenever he passed by an open bar or a drunk on the street. Sometimes, even when Sam claimed to be a man rather than a boy, he would take Dean’s hand when hearing an approaching crowd of rowdy, intoxicated men. And Dean never argued it. He would give Sam’s hand a reassuring squeeze and hold on until the danger had passed and Sam once again felt safe.
“Morning, sunshine,” Dean said.
, as if nobody else could have been a fair substitute for the ex-angel. Or at least that was what he hoped.
“Um, well I suppose that it depends. What do you think I want?”
Everything was safest when he wasn’t there. Even the Winchesters.
“What?” Cas asked, blinking in confusion.
Castiel murmured something incoherent and even he wasn’t sure what exactly it was though he thought it was something along the lines of: “touch me” or “kiss me”. He couldn’t discern which since he so desperately wanted both. And now it seemed like too much to ask for.
Cas hadn’t dared voice a word about it to either Sam or Dean. He knew there wasn’t any point. It wasn’t as if he didn’t understand what these thoughts or physical arousals meant, or why it happened. He had long ago decided to keep his teeth firmly clamped down on his tongue to escape the embarrassment that was bound to ensue were he ever to mention his newfound libido.
“Sam says I shouldn’t worry,” Dean continued on when the silence became deafening.
But now he felt the urges that had him pulling Dean into his arms and into his bed. The longing that had him loving Dean into the night, often as dirty and unforgiving as they could get. There was simply no denying the things he wanted—more specifically the things he wanted to do to Dean and the things he wanted Dean to do to him.
“I hope you know that I’m unhappy about this, Dean,” Cas huffed and leaned his arms on the open windowsill.
“If you say so,” Cas said. He imagined what Sam would have to say to that.
His hand suddenly felt so empty and cold, and he almost wished Castiel would immediately take it back. He was too ashamed to ask, out of fear the request would sound needy and overly-attached. Instead, he turned his back to disguise the uneasy look in his eye and the almost imperceptible quiver to his lip. Dean could feel Castiel’s eyes boring into his back as he walked down the aisle and then around the corner out of sight.
Somehow, someway, Dean was always there. They had been through a lot together, Cas realised. And somehow all the good moments stood out from the bad, like a glowing beacon to show him what really mattered. In times of turmoil, Dean could turn to Cas, and Cas to Dean, and that was the true miracle. And having the hunter looking at him like he was the sun rising at the edges of the pitch black night made Castiel open his mouth and sing along with him.
“I’m good, Dean. I wake up, make toast, read and clean the kitchen—”
He ought to have known it was a mistake.
And then, over time, Dean seemed to find his way to Castiel’s room; sitting together for hours on end watching Netflix whilst Dean snacked on chips or beef jerky, both of them steadily drinking beer. And Cas found that with Dean’s frequent visits the confined four walls of that room became more comfortable still. It started to feel even more like it was his, and he would long to return whenever he was away—because he knew Dean would be there.
Dean shivered.
Castiel blinked purposely. “You used to pray to Cas.”
Now it all seemed foolish. Since apparently Castiel wouldn’t go to him even when he was able to hear him. He’d listen to the begging and the suffering and do nothing.
“Please, man,” Dean whispered finally, “I need you, okay? That’s never changed. I need you and that’s all that matters.”
“I tried to text you from the road…” Dean broached eventually. He picked at the label on his bottle, inspecting the torn edges with a very close eye. His focus was impossible to tear away from it, so he failed to recognise the confounded opening and closing of Castiel’s mouth.
Castiel quirked his head to the side. “Have you never prayed before?” He wondered, his tone dripping with condescension.
Castiel knelt down in front of Dean and took his hands into his own. “There are things you and Sam need to do. Things that are currently being neglected. And it is greatly my fault.”
“Take a picture, it’ll last longer,” Dean laughed.
“Well, that’s not the way I see it,” Dean retorted sourly.
“Unlock the cuffs,” Castiel demanded.
Nevertheless, the threat alone was enough. Castiel reached up and grasped Dean’s hands in a moment of panic, pulling them down away from his face. Dean’s already gleeful laughter filled the aisle, and probably the next two aisles on either side of them as well. Tears lined his devilishly bright eyes. He was overcome and lost for air as his stomach began to ache, the muscles contracting and ready to burst. Dean collapsed a little forward, resting his forehead against Castiel’s shoulder and burying his mouth into the warm material of his coat. The sound of his delight muffled, saving himself the embarrassment of any curious eyes passing by.
“Oh…” He murmured.
“You’ve never ridden it?”
Castiel’s arms tightened around Dean, pulling him impossibly closer. Warmth permeated Dean; something angelic and pure tingling down his spine, and it forced all the pain from him. For the first time in a long time, Dean wasn’t burdened by loss or fear. For just a few, beautiful moments, Dean felt no suffering, and he knew Castiel didn’t feel any either.
Dean crawled with his one good arm, the broken one half clasped to his chest, but he didn’t get far before being kicked violently in the ribs. He heard the bone break before he felt it and then he collapsed upon himself face first into the dirt. He gritted his teeth, forcing back the cry of agony. He refused to give these demons the benefit of his pain. He refused to give them the satisfaction they were looking for.
Cas withdrew and tugged off his shirt. Dean immediately followed after him, his eyes alight and eager as he took Cas in and admired something within him that Cas couldn’t recognise or even imagine. He traced the edges and soft curves of Castiel’s body, his calloused hands exploring him one more time.
“No,” Castiel said far too quickly.
“Was Mary with him?” Dean asked, leaning forward in his chair. “Our mother. Did Lucifer have her?”
“It’s hard to say,” Castiel frowned.
With a forlorn shake of his head, he got back into the car and drove, the speedometer creeping over the speed limit with his thoughts elsewhere rather than on the road. It took all his strength to only look back once, and he wished he hadn’t. It meant he’d given in to his delusions, having already been feeding them each time he even considered the possibility of Castiel’s return.
Dean said, tucking the newspaper under his arm, “I’ve got some better options if you want them. Fewer articles, more pictures. If you know what I mean…”
It felt rather dismissive in a way. As if Dean was too dim to understand and too impulsive to participate in the whole ordeal.
Their eyes would meet, heavy with purpose and knowing. Dean would smile at him whenever Sam wasn’t looking. It was the same flirtatious grin Dean usually reserved for the women he met at bars and diners, the same alluring smirk that he paired with a seductive passion in his eyes. Dean had obviously perfected the look over time, and there was no mistaking it; it frequently left Castiel breathless and in a daze. Each time Dean gazed at him and gave him that tempting smile, Cas was hit with a sudden rush of ecstasy that was also tainted with shame. As much as he savoured these moments, he couldn’t help but resent them too. The worst part of it all was simply that he knew it would all lead to nowhere. It was an absolute torment to want to touch and kiss and caress someone, and then never be able to. And he suspected that the look was entirely empty. He didn’t think that there was any true lust there behind Dean’s eyes, considering how he often shied away from his touch in public spaces; their occasional embraces short with a perceptible tension in Dean’s shoulders—though his hand sometimes hesitated at the small of his back, lingering whilst the rest of him pulled away, and his fingers would grasp the material of his coat for just a few seconds before letting go.
He silently swore not to let the opportunity pass him by again.
Dean peered at him. Castiel furrowed his brow and puckered his lips. He, too, was wringing his hands together in front of him. With Dean’s eyes panning up and down his body, Castiel shifted his weight from one foot to the other and his eyes bore into Dean—the stunning blue piercing right through the hunter and capturing him in place.
too. He wanted to believe that Castiel was becoming more and more human all the time and that maybe his affections for Dean could grow into love. It was a yearning Dean had but often questioned, sometimes doubting the sincerity of it. Were these affections to grow into love, would Dean truly be reciprocating the sentiment, or would he merely be pretending? It was so easy to dismiss these fears whenever he and Castiel were alone together, able to kiss and embrace and touch one another. It was only when Dean was back in his own room, curled up on his side of the oversized bed, that the doubts found crevices in which to creep through to the forefront of his mind.
“Seriously, Sam, can you quit shadowing me?” Dean muttered and walked to his bedroom. Sam followed.
“…Sometimes…” Castiel admitted.
In the brief seconds outside absolute delirium, Castiel pictured the morning where he could wake up encircled protectively in Dean’s arms. He imagined their naked bodies pressed together so intimately, but with no sexual connotation aside from the blissful memory of the night before and the daydream of more nights together in future. He couldn’t even begin to understand where this notion came from, as he had yet to see as much in the movies and shows he saw and in the very few books he read.
“Back to the bunker?” Cas asked quietly.
It felt weirdly invasive to be showing up at his door like this. It was as if he had caught Castiel in the act of something truly embarrassing, though there was actually nothing odd about watching TV—even if it
“Oh, all the time. I grew up with the Impala but my dad still had a soft spot for a good Harley. Sam and I took turns riding with him sometimes. And our friend Bobby had some old dirt bikes at his salvage yard that he fixed up for us.”
Dean stood again and took to pacing slowly, his arms still crossed. “We’re trying to get you home. And we want to save our mother—”
“You coming in or what?” Dean asked and edged cautiously into the water. His shoulders tensed and he crossed his arms over his chest.
“I did.” Cas didn’t look away from Dean’s face.
Dean’s grip tightened on his wrists as he pressed into him. Castiel was struck by the sensation. It was so completing. Dean filled him so entirely. He gasped and then his breath stuttered as Dean withdrew slightly from him before pressing in again. His hands nearly slipped from their position on the wall, but he suddenly needed them there not just because Dean commanded it, but also for stability. Dean’s hands slid around him with his palms pressed to Cas’ stomach, his skin calloused and warm and protective.
But when a car backed out of the parking lot, its headlights streaming through the thin curtain covering the window, Castiel saw that Dean was lying there awake, watching him. Cas turned his back to the hunter, curling up even tighter so that his legs started to cramp. That look in Dean’s eye… it was like he had known all along that Castiel was suffering. It was like Dean was watching over him, protecting him from harm.
“I could go with you,” Castiel offered quietly, stricken at letting Dean die alone. And that was Cas: always ready to give everything he had, but Dean couldn’t dare be selfish enough to take it.
“Go wait with Sam,” Dean ordered, refusing to meet his gaze.
So what was the point?
This was one of those times.
“Go on.”
“Cas,” Dean moaned, “Please, I need you… I really fucking need you.”
“Cas?” Dean whispered, his hands hesitating on Cas’ thighs. Castiel had become frozen beneath him.
“Is that better?” Castiel asked curiously.
(See the end of the chapter for
There had been something so pure about it. And perhaps that was why Dean had already taken to teaching Castiel many similar lessons. And Castiel had been just as eager to learn, always pushing for more and seeking a complex explanation behind even the most insignificant of lessons. Yet, something felt different this time. It wasn’t that Dean felt as though he wasn’t learning as much in return, because he was, about a whole other reality no less… but the purity was tainted somehow by something just beyond Dean’s understanding. Maybe it was the difference between years to months, or perhaps it was down to being saved by the dead and not by the living.
Dean loved saying it. He could hide his face and laugh at the words, but they both knew the sincerity.
They both fell silent, but Dean’s hand remained a constant presence at Castiel’s leg; sometimes trailing to the knee and back thoughtlessly. Cas had the dangerous idea of perhaps one day doing the same to Dean—he was curious as to how he would react to the same touch.
“Castiel?” Dean said. There was a flurry of sounds on the other end of the line, like heavy gusts of wind and the snapping of wood.
“Pardon?” Cas hadn’t understood.
“Sam tried to warn me,” Castiel said, “he said you were using me as a poor substitute for
“Of course,” Castiel vowed, and Dean could see he meant it. Cas was going to grant him his dying wish to not just look out for his little brother, but also to stay alive. Dean couldn’t kiss him, but something told him he didn’t need to: Castiel knew, and the angel wanted to kiss him too, but didn’t for all the same reasons.
“I’m telling you that I’ve lost hundreds more of my brothers and sisters since you trapped Lucifer in my world. I’m telling you that you’re the reason why we’re starting to lose the war. I’m telling you that what you did has devastated us, and all you care about is your mother.” Castiel fought against his chains, the cuffs cutting into the skin of his vessel but healing just as swiftly as it bled. His eyes were manic, his pupils large and pointed—burning into Dean.
Castiel’s cheeks flushed scarlet and he quickly looked away, embarrassed. He could never admit how he had, on multiple occasions, wondered about the body beneath Dean’s clothes. Since becoming human, and sometimes even before that, Cas had sometimes caught himself looking at Dean in a way he probably shouldn’t; in a way he knew he wasn’t supposed to. Sometimes he could become so easily distracted by the hunter and he had immense difficulty trying to regain his focus.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t plan,” he answered easily. Castiel crawled, rather clumsily, from the front seat into the back and leaned against the backrest with a smile still playing at his lips.
When Dean reached his destination and found that the portal merely led to yet another dimension he never wished to visit, he leaned against the hood of the Impala and waited for it to close. He and Sam had made a routine of this: sitting and waiting as long as it took for the crack between the two worlds to seal. They had to make sure nothing passed through the tear in time and space. It was the only way they could try and ensure that the two worlds didn’t collide. Of course, they couldn’t truly prepare themselves for whatever could come through, yet Dean’s plan had always remained the same:
Castiel physically winced but forced himself not to withdraw. A sadistic part of him wanted to hear what Dean had to say about him. He almost needed to have his suspicions proven and his fears validated by Dean’s resentment for having started an intimate relationship with him in the first place.
He didn’t have an appropriate response prepared in case Dean brought it up, but apparently he needn’t had worried, because Dean didn’t say a word about it.
“I once trusted you, Castiel,” another angel said, “I trusted your judgement and your leadership, even as you led us astray. I believed you would be our saviour… but I was wrong.”
He and Dean could—and often did—spend hours at a time embracing like this, effortlessly moulding their bodies into the curves of one another, resting silently and peacefully in the safety of their home and each other’s arms. But it was rare for Castiel to truly feel absent of distress. It was their home, but he often had the sense that he was intruding there. Merely a tourist gazing from the outside in, traversing the scenery knowing he was bound never to see it again.
“No. It’ll just fog up the windows more,” Dean said and switched the stereo off entirely at the exact same time Castiel went to turn it up. Cas’ hand hovered there for a moment, wondering if he dared to defy Dean and turn it back on. But he knew that Dean must have questions, and after having stormed out of the bar, he thought he should probably answer them—no matter how much he really didn’t want to.
Dean hadn’t heard Castiel coming into the room—he never did—and he jumped at the interruption. Automatically, he withdrew his hand from the carving and retrieved his beer, purposely sipping from it and acting aloof. He stood upright—or rather as upright as his fuzzy intoxication would actually allow—and acknowledged Castiel with a faint nod of his head. His heart was still racing from the unexpected company.
The hunter was simply fuming, and sought to use any distraction he could to keep himself from snapping and saying something he probably shouldn’t. But as Dean fastened his pace and clenched his fists, Cas recognised that his composure was bound to break at any second with what was sure to be a violent outburst.
“That’s better than no words at all?”
Dean felt that had played a big part in getting him to two weeks sober.
“Haven’t you always seen me?” Cas sighed.
Dean’s heart sunk into the pit of his stomach.
He slid his thumb through the slit of Dean’s cock before stroking back down to the base, all the while angling him towards the bed. Dean easily allowed Castiel to guide him and lowered himself onto the mattress without pause. He was sitting exactly where Cas had pleasured himself a few hours before. Just thinking about it made Castiel’s cock twinge, and he growled quietly, cursing Dean’s name under his breath.
“She wasn’t boring, let’s just put it that way,” Dean laughed and clapped Cas on the back.
“Dean, I’m sorry if that’s how I made you feel. It wasn’t my intention…” Cas whispered.
“It’s okay,” he said gently, nodding to Sophia.
“Dean.”
Dean murmured quietly into the phone, “I better go. Get some sleep, yeah? And listen to those tapes.”
“From now on you should come up with all the ideas,” Dean sighed and leaned into Cas. “What do you want to do?”
Dean laughed and handed him a napkin, “that’s just a garnish, you idiot. I don’t know anybody who actually eats that.”
He was fiercely loyal and cunningly brave and undeniably strong. And where Dean had flaws, Castiel matched them with flaws of his own. Castiel was created in the perfect image of God and yet he was as imperfect as the humans that the other angels so deeply resented and looked down upon.
Dean’s hands slipped under Cas’ shirt and traced the skin of his stomach and chest. Castiel’s fingers tangled into Dean’s hair and fought for dominance of the kiss. And he quickly won. Dean easily submitted to him, a quiet groan of lust escaping his lips. Castiel withdrew and picked Dean up, placing him down on the counter and holding his thighs around him.
Then Dean started to see him. He saw him by the side of the road, his coat tattered the way it had been in Purgatory. It was Cas the way he had seen him last, like no time had passed since. Dean slammed his foot on the brake and then reversed, turning to look out the rear windshield, but he couldn’t see anything. The trees swayed lazily in the breeze, cicadas clicked faintly in the distance. It was just him and the open road. Dean pulled on the hand brake, got out of the Impala with the engine still running, and stood, lost, in the middle of the road, his heart hammering and his skin crawling—but the hope was spent. There was nothing, and no one, to see.
Dean turned around in Castiel’s arms and easily graced the corner of his lips with his thumb, wiping away a dab of either peanut butter or jelly. Dean rested his thumb at Cas’ lips who obediently parted them and gently sucked. Dean smiled and withdrew his hand, leaning in for a kiss. Their mouths tasted sweet as their kiss swiftly deepened, and Dean had to stop, breathless, before they went any further.
They had stopped at a hotel that somehow proved to be even worse than the last one: with the carpet and wallpaper even more dilapidated than what Cas had already seen so far. Worse though was the strange smell that permeated the room. They had already tried opening the one, small solitary window on the far wall to air out the room, but the smell still lingered. And neither of them could describe what the odour actually was—each time they thought they had the appropriate descriptor they ended up reconsidering and deciding that it was something else entirely. It took them an hour before giving up on trying to label it and had simply tried to ignore it ever since. But time had done nothing to dull their senses.
And maybe that scared him.
The first time Dean distinctly remembers wanting to kiss Castiel, was when he found him by the edge of the stream in Purgatory. Long before that, there had always been some kind of magnetism between them. The times they locked eyes for too long, the deep blue exploring the bright green. The times Dean found Cas standing a little too close—gradually Dean started to sense him before actually seeing him; he could feel the shift in the air, the subtle rise in temperature like another body radiating warmth.
Dean paused and wrung his hands together nervously.
“Then what would you say?” Sam blinked in surprise. Both that Cas disagreed, but also at hearing him utter more than three words at a time.
“Sing it,” Dean suggested, smiling at the former angel.
“Well brace yourself because it’s a good one.” Cas could hear the smile in Dean’s voice. “Now, my high school experience was short lived, really on and off over the years. Life on the road will do that to you. But there was one week at a school in Nebraska that’ll be all the high school experience I’ll ever need. There was this guy in my history class—massive douchebag, he made Biff Tannen look like a sweetheart.”
Thanks for reading, guys! This chapter has been a long time coming, and, again, I apologise for the wait. I think I finally have an ending in mind, so hopefully, there won't be as much time between chapters from now on (famous last words). In any case, I hope you enjoyed this chapter! :)
The radio was quiet and did nothing to interrupt the silence that had fallen between them during the drive back to the motel, but neither of them reached out to turn up the volume; though Castiel’s hand had twitched a few times as he tried to draw enough courage to do it.
Even from here, it was evident that the portal wouldn’t remain open for much longer. The edges were already creeping inward and the glowing light flickered and dimmed. There was always the risk that one of them could become trapped in an alternate world. They couldn’t risk taking more time than absolutely necessary on the other side. Usually, one of them went through alone whilst the other remained on Earth, prepared to follow if necessary or to seek the same portal in future to find and rescue the other. But this time, with the threat of demons looming ahead, Sam insisted they both go through together.
“Yes! Yes, I’m sure,” Dean gasped, suddenly starting to come undone at Castiel’s touch and he groaned as he ejaculated into his hand.
Dean deserved someone whose mistakes were forgivable, whose efforts to do good didn’t go bad, and someone who could love selflessly and without the desperation of the dying. Dean deserved someone who could sleep without waking them in fits of screaming, someone who could do laundry without dyeing all the white clothing pink, someone who could cook toast without burning it and could hold their liquor and not make complete fools of themselves.
. You, me. Us. It’s weird, right?”
How could he say goodbye to someone he hadn’t yet confided his love to? It would feel and sound hollow, because there was more weight to the word than he had allowed himself to let on. Because Cas, wherever he was, if he could hear him somehow—which Dean wanted, but couldn’t, believe—wouldn’t understand what it truly meant. He wouldn’t know just how damn hard it was letting go.
Sam smiled a little. “That you’re written in braille.”
The door closed. The bolt turned. Cas knew. The bolt hadn’t been put there to keep people out. It was put there to keep people in—to keep him in. In his desperation to do penance, he had ignored every sign that pointed to his demise. Or he had run knowingly into it. He wasn’t surprised to find himself trapped here with two more angels at his back, both with angel blades in hand. And he wasn’t as scared as he was before. It was almost a relief to know where he stood and to finally be facing his fate. He understood, and he forgave them.
Castiel
“Go to the next hotel, curl up in bed to watch television and eat some junk food,” Cas told him. He picked up the blanket that had been left abandoned from all those nights ago when Dean had covered him with it after their drunken encounter. “But first, I am too cold to even think.”
“Cas…” Dean whispered. The hunter stepped into the room and easily took Castiel into his arms, holding him protectively to his chest and rubbing his back as he cried.
Dean waited until Sam rounded the corner and disappeared down the hall towards the garage before rubbing his temples firmly with dread. He didn’t want to do this. The original plan had been trouble enough: either on the road alone or in the bunker with Castiel—with that ever growing need to be with him the way he never had the chance to with Cas. But this was worse. This was them out on the road together in that confining car, able to see Castiel in the rear-view mirror for as many hours they were driving. There would be no escaping it—him. Dean couldn’t distance himself whenever that line between the two angels—the living and the dead—blurred beyond distinction.
“And you really scared me,” Dean admitted, “I’ve never…” He cleared his throat again. “I’ve never seen you like that before. I’ve never seen you cry.”
“Cas?”
we’ve kept him prisoner for so long. He could
“Bullshit,” Dean rejected the notion immediately. He knew Castiel when he saw him—albeit a little different to how he remembered him last. This was Cas, and there was nothing that could, or would, indicate otherwise. It didn’t matter how the angel now carried himself much the same way a proficient and unwavering soldier would—the way he had all those years ago upon their first meeting. It didn’t matter that there wasn’t any sign to suggest that Cas even recognised them. There came no acknowledgement other than disdain, or perhaps, worse still, complete disinclination—as though killing them would be as trivial as swatting a fly. No matter what he saw at the forefront, Dean knew that Castiel was there somewhere deep within; even if the angel didn’t know it yet.
If he did in fact imagine it, then that meant he could, hypothetically, force it out of existence. If it truly wasn’t real, then he had no excuse for still believing in it. That idea was as disquieting as it was unpleasant, and Dean found himself shunning it before it could take hold.
,” Dean corrected him. His voice came out muffled against the table, and his shoulders slumped.
“Geez, almost sounded like you were flirting with me just now,” Dean teased, “you practically just undressed me with your eyes.”
“Thank you.”
Dean pounded on the door, making Cas jump and he scurried to turn the water off.
Dean shrugged noncommittedly, “I dunno. Teeth or nails. It’s usually one or the other.”
“Yes. Everything is okay,” Castiel assured him. He never looked away from Dean.
Or, more plainly, because Castiel and Cas were not one and the same.
“I can cover much more ground, and you two can investigate the portals I miss. If I find my world, I’ll find you and bring you to it.”
What had he done to arouse so many doubts and concerns in the hunter, and how could he possibly dispel them?
couldn’t care as much as he should.
“You can feel my erection jutting against your stomach, isn’t that telling enough?” Cas’ blush deepened.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Sam said.
Occasionally he could still hear angel radio, but the voices had begun to fade more and more as the angels omitted him. And the longer he was human, the harder it was to listen in. It was like trying to tune a radio when there weren’t any available stations. A lot of the time he heard nothing at all. It became impossible to know where the angels were or what they were doing, and this allowed his imagination to run rampant. Worse, however, was that he realised that whatever presumptions he had made could very well be underestimations. In truth, the chaos out there could be far worse than he had ever pictured. Cas had been on Earth for a number of years and he still felt alienated. Humanity was confusing and complicated and incredibly intricate. Worst of all, humanity could be fragile. The angels could be heavy-handed and dismissive, caring only about their own cause. They had a tendency to look down upon humans as being lesser creatures, and so they were likely to allow people to become trapped in the crossfire or to even use them to their own advantage. Without God’s rule—or anyone’s leadership for that matter—the angels could be at war.
Cas felt a warmth in his chest. The back of his neck prickled with some kind of indescribable bliss. It was in the way Dean’s face flushed a pale pink and in the way his eyes pierced the floor with the inability to meet Castiel’s gaze out of fear that the honesty may be blinding. Cas could tell that Dean meant what he said. Just being needed—by Dean of all people—was more than Cas could have ever hoped for; it was everything.
“You’re sitting in a possible splash zone,” Dean warned, half-jokingly. Sam scooted his chair further to the side so he wasn’t sitting directly across from him, just to be safe.
“What?” Cas asked. He was so startled he almost dropped his towel. Tentatively, he reached up and touched his damp hair, wondering what was wrong with it.
“Of course not,” Castiel scoffed and then froze. “No.”
“We’re going with you. That was the arrangement,” Sam was unwilling to bend. “Something happens, we’re there to deal with it,
There was so much he wanted to say, and so much he just didn’t have the right words for. He wanted to tell him he loved him, and how he couldn’t ever thrive in a world without him in it. He wanted to hold Castiel’s face in his hands again but this time brush his thumb over Castiel’s lips before kissing him.
“It means Castiel is coming home with us.”
Another horrible silence followed. Castiel was becoming all too acquainted with them and he settled into it with weary acceptance. It could consume him if that’s what it desired. He would stay still and quiet for as long as it took to finish him.
“Again?” Dean groaned, his knuckles stiffening on the steering wheel.
“Maybe?”
“I’m well aware of your extensive history of having sexual relations with various women…. That’s why I’m simply baffled that you couldn’t seduce a waitress in a quiet bar with no current contenders for her affection. Does my presence distract you?”
Only now, Dean wished he had stayed awake a little bit longer. He wished he had spent more time watching him and really focusing on the details that had since become lost to him. There were holes in his memory that he could never get back.
Ezekiel stumbled backwards, his body weakened by the strain of using his already weakened grace, and he collapsed against the wall. Dean was startled, worried about his brother and whether his health was now in jeopardy if Ezekiel wasn’t strong enough to continue healing him.
And that look of pure ecstasy in his expression told Cas that he wanted this just as much as he did; he wanted Cas in his arms, in his bed; as a permanent fixture in his life. And Cas was willing and ready to give him all that and more. He had just been waiting for Dean to ask.
“Should I be concerned?” Cas asked, now leaning in again and edging his kisses closer to Dean’s neck.
“Another portal just opened,” Sam explained quickly. His back was to Dean, reloading his gun and tucking it into the waistband of his jeans.
Cas opened his mouth to apologise once more but he stopped himself. Instead, he breathed—a great and pronounced breath that made him choke.
Dean was quieter. More distant. Near completely isolated. He could barely meet Cas’ eye, and his expression remained completely impervious to the music as though he wasn’t really listening to it. Cas realised that Dean’s hair was all the more unkempt and damp after a shower, and there was a hint of pink to his cheeks that never seemed to fade. His eyes would flitter from wall to wall, from the floor to the ceiling—always avoiding looking at Castiel. If he didn’t know any better, he’d think that Dean was embarrassed. Or perhaps the word
Everything heavy simply faded into the open sky.
So far nothing had even resembled the doings of angels; no unexplained miracles or signs of supernatural mass destruction. It was far too quiet. After a while, Cas saw no point in looking. There was nothing he could do were he to see something informative about his grounded brothers and sisters. They would never listen to him, and with good reason. Castiel could never rightfully tell them what they could and could not do. Forcing freedom and free will upon them had already proven futile in the past. Sam and Dean were likely right when they said that they would kill him at first sight—not that that fate would be anything less than what he deserved.
“What are you doing, Dean?!” Sam hissed. His eyes were wild; wide and manic with untethered dread. Dean knew that Sam knew. He knew everything without having to ask. The guilt was all over Dean’s face.
“Then why is it there?!” Cas demanded to know, spitting into the napkin and wiping his mouth. He could still feel and taste it in his teeth and at the back of his tongue.
“That it’s disgusting behaviour. Dean himself is relatively more agreeable. He has superb manners whenever he wishes to use them, which, admittedly, isn’t as often as it should be.”
“I’ve got a setup in the bathroom,” Sam pressed on, eager to lure Castiel out of his cave.
“I was in the safe confines of the bunker. What was the danger in that?”
Dean’s heart hammered wildly in his chest. He understood all too well.
“We’ll put you back in and pull our mum back out,” Dean said sternly, recalling Sam’s plan.
Again, Dean was compliant, taking the two fingers between his lips and sucking on them, his mouth hot and slick. After a few moments of this, Cas pulled his hand back and teasingly circled the rim of Dean’s asshole with his wet index finger. The hunter pushed back towards him, impatient to feel him. Castiel carefully pushed his finger in, going slow and kissing the small of Dean’s back at the same time. Dean tensed and Cas felt him tighten around his finger. He paused, allowing Dean some time to adjust before adding the second finger. Dean groaned, again forcing his ass back further so Castiel’s fingers pressed deeper into him. Cas moved them gradually, pushing in and pulling out little by little and spreading his fingers apart slightly to stretch him.
When Castiel had stopped Dean and said;
. They were both thinking it. Though at the time of the ‘agreement’, Sam had never specified the reasoning behind his request—he hadn’t needed to.
It worked well for them—this little routine of theirs. The nightmares slowly began to subside; Cas’ sheets becoming just that little bit neater in the morning, with all signs of his usual tormented tossing and turning almost completely absent. There remained some kind of self-loathing: a part of him that still believed that he hadn’t yet earned the right to peaceful nights. But he had to admit that he couldn’t help but relish in the beautiful relief that was contented sleep. Eventually, he allowed it, but awoke with a spark of resentment and inwardly chastised himself. It seemed important to remember that he wasn’t pure or righteous.
“I couldn’t tell you. It isn’t my war,” Dean said. “Where’s God in all of this?” He wondered.
“Nope,” Dean was quick to respond, but then corrected himself, “well, not anymore. You can’t really see something the same way once you’ve been, well,
“I knew it,” Dean replied, chuffed.
“Well, I’m not sure what’s worse, Dean. The nauseating headache that won’t go away or your refusal to acknowledge what we did last night,” Cas replied earnestly. His head nearly hit the dash when Dean suddenly hit the brakes.
“So, tell me, doctor, will I live?” Dean asked sarcastically.
“I met Him,” Dean shrugged, “He came for The Darkness. His sister.”
“Doesn’t it? Oh, I don’t know, Cas, I thought it seemed important not to accidentally call the man who does your prostate exam Dad or the woman from the bar you drunkenly slept with Mum. Don’t you agree?”
They were both ridiculously out of tune, but Dean had an assurance about him that made it all seem so purposeful and effortless. The hunter threw all his energy into it and tapped the steering wheel in time to the gentle beat and raised his voice for the chorus. It clearly didn’t matter to him when Cas’ voice faded into indiscernible mumbling at the parts he couldn’t remember. Accuracy wasn’t important; but his participation was. And that gave Cas the confidence to sing louder and he swayed into Dean’s side with a whole-hearted ease.
Sam peered up through a curtain of hair and smiled somewhat awkwardly. His eyes darted back and forth between Castiel’s always intense gaze and his wounds, the smile never quite leaving his face as he tried to clear his throat and find the right words.
“Cas, I’m starving,” Dean complained and climbed out of bed. He leaned down and took Castiel’s face into his hands and guided him into a tender kiss. “I’ll make it up to you and get you coffee first thing,” he offered.
However, they had yet to run across another Earth quite as drastic as the one they were in now. Apparently the worst world—the one well and truly in ruins—was the one in which they had never existed—no other had yet resembled the apocalypse. And Dean couldn’t even begin to fathom what that could mean. And he didn’t wish to remember how it was, somehow, someway, still
“Allow me,” Dean said, recognising the discomfort in Castiel’s expression. He effortlessly unzipped Cas’ jeans and pulled them down. Stunned, Cas lifted one foot after the other to get them off completely. The jeans were then swiftly followed by his underwear. Then they were once again naked together. “I’m learning,” Dean grinned, winking cheekily at him. He kissed at the corner of Cas’ mouth before stepping away and picking up both plates of cold food and carrying them to the table. “Care to join me?” Dean asked.
Dean swiftly stood up and clapped Sam hard on the shoulder, purposely hitting harder than was necessary. It was a silent reprimand for leaving him alone with the angel and going out of his way to take time in coming back. Dean didn’t appreciate it. It had accomplished nothing.
to want to talk to Sam and Dean, yet he didn’t. He took their unanswered phone calls as an indication of their continued survival and saw no reason to respond. Even now, as he sat and selected ‘Continue watching’ on the screen, he realised how little he remembered from the previous episodes, but also how little he actually cared. The stories he once sought to lose himself in could no longer captivate his attention. Nothing felt important anymore. And he could rationalise why it ought to matter, why he should get up and occupy his time, but he still couldn’t bring himself to act.
“I should take caution. I understand,” Cas nodded, “I appreciate your help and concern.”
Dean frowned but trailed after him, closing the door between them and Castiel though there still remained the possibility that he could hear them. After all, he was a celestial being; it was hard to distinguish what his limitations were, especially now when he had never been tainted by weakness before. They walked to the end of the hall and then stopped. Sam ran his hand down his face and rubbed his jaw, lost in thought as he turned to his older brother. And then he was angry.
“But you like it?” Dean looked hopeful.
“Little bit,” Dean admitted, licking his lips again. And again, Cas watched, entranced. Up this close, he was better able to see Dean’s pale—almost secret—freckles, and what was evidently stubble that had been shaved only yesterday or the day before. He saw the smallest dot of toothpaste at the very corner of Dean’s bottom lip. Gently, and ever so cautiously, Cas reached up and brushed the toothpaste away with his thumb.
“You need it or something?” Dean asked, already making his escape for the door.
“Something bothering you?” he asked knowingly.
For a long time, Dean had kept his drinking under control. He had been proud of himself while it lasted. He had distanced himself from his father in the way that mattered most—he was a good role model to Sam, and a reliable caretaker even when he was probably old enough to take care of himself. Which was usually more than what could be said of John.
Castiel’s hands drifted away from Dean’s face as he finished up and felt satisfied that he had done the best that he could for the cut. The hunter watched him, never breaking eye contact as Cas rested his hand gently on Dean’s bicep. There was something to his touch that lacked innocence somehow. It meant something more and both of them knew it. Castiel waited with bated breath, curious as to whether Dean would pull away this time. He didn’t. Not right away at least.
“You were looking at him. Or at least trying to.”
“No, it doesn’t count,” Dean confirmed.
His grace would change everything. He knew it and he wasn’t so foolish as to hope against the odds. He wasn’t about to beg Dean to love something he couldn’t. Because what they had would cease the moment that blue light of heaven passed Castiel’s lips, tethering him to a vastness Dean was rightfully averse to. Heaven hadn’t done Dean any favours, the angels had proven themselves deceitful and impervious to empathy, so what affection could be spared for Cas after that?
“I don’t know what you said to him, Dean, but Castiel is talking. I can barely get a word in edgewise,” Sam said, pouring a cup of coffee for the two of them. Dean looked up from his computer and watched as Sam hovered with the pot of coffee still clasped in hand. He hesitated a moment before retrieving a third mug from the cupboard and filling it. “He might want coffee,” Sam mused aloud.
Despite being rested, he still looked tired with the pale shadow of bags under his eyes and he realised then that he actually looked more human than he ever had before despite always having a human vessel. He hadn’t known just how much of a difference being without his grace made on him, even down to the minute details. Before now it had always been about mortality and the constant need to eat, sleep and use the restroom amongst many other daunting human tasks. Everything else had slipped by unnoticed, and he had to wonder if Dean had seen the changes even when he himself couldn’t.
to lose. He imagined how good it would feel to simply fold beneath his own forbidden will, to just allow his vision to irreversibly blur and to see exactly what he wanted. To see Cas without the burden of deep down knowing it was someone else.
“We’ve gotten the seat all wet,” Cas commented guiltily.
“This is a vessel, Dean. It’s always been anatomically correct with the inclusion of tastebuds. They simply just didn’t work the same way as yours while I had my grace.”
“Hmm?” Cas hummed mindlessly. He caressed Dean’s cheek, grazing his skin lightly with his thumb.
“Dean, seriously, you
“And it doesn’t change anything,” Dean muttered. He was finally able to push past Sam, no longer caring whether he got away with or without his clothes.
Dean forced a laugh and he gestured to the steadily fading bruising across his nose, “Those shackles say you’re stronger than me. They’re there to even the playing field. So far you’ve given me nothing but pain, so what exactly do you think you deserve in return?”
They wouldn’t have to wait very long.
better?”
“Good,” Dean nodded approvingly and shut his car door before walking into the thin canopy of trees and disappearing from sight the closer he got to the edge of the lake.
“Dean?” Cas asked.
The unspeakable thing that robbed Castiel of light and left him so empty couldn’t take
“I think I heard something about it,” Dean granted and climbed into the driver’s seat out of habit. “Even smashed you’re still the voice of reason. But how do you plan for us to get home now?”
Castiel’s hair was clutched in a tight fist at the back of his head and his face was pushed forcefully down into the bucket and held there for countless seconds before being pulled out again. He had tried to hold his breath, but his lungs simply protested at the effort and his strained throat screamed. He hadn’t had time to recover and he hadn’t yet lost the sensation of suffocating. And he wasn’t about to lose it any time soon. They were making sure of it.
So far he hadn’t let off a single shot. Though he suspected his luck would eventually run out. It always did, after all. Dean leaned his sawed-off shotgun against his leg and dug his phone out of his pocket. Sam hadn’t contacted him, which implied nothing chaotic had happened since he left. Dean started typing, his eyes darting up now and again to check on the slowly closing portal.
“Hey, Castiel. What’s going on?” Sam asked calmly.
“It was lonely here too,” Cas told him. His voice, longing to be heard, made every word a confession.
“Why should we?” Dean asked.
“It’s only pie-like,” Castiel reminded him. “If it were a true pie, I would have expected a song. A soppy one.”
If only he had known then all that he knew now. Maybe then he could have lived his life the way he always wanted to: with Castiel.
But Cas inexplicably found himself longing for these calls less and less. By the seventh day of their absence, Cas switched his phone off at night and ignored the numerous text messages in the morning. He
“You understood that?”
“Y…yes, Cas. Yes, I fucking want you,” Dean groaned quickly, his fingers tugging desperately at Castiel’s hair.
“They didn’t, exactly,” Dean started, “as far as we know, Jack—the Nephilim—wasn’t aware of the portal at first. We aren’t even sure if he’s purposely creating them now. And Lucifer… well, he ambushed us that night, looking for his son, and we trapped him in the alternate world. But, as Sam said, he dragged our mother in with him.”
“I don’t,” Cas said.
There it was. There was the man Dean knew. There was Castiel who so often said the strangest things at the best of times. There was Castiel who took into consideration everything that Dean too easily forgot or didn’t think held any significance. There was Castiel, just the way Dean had always liked him.
Dean flinched. “Okay… yeah. You’ve got me there,” he admitted. He withdrew just that little bit further. “But that’s still different, Cas. That was Anna and this is… this is
He tried to recall ever seeing Dean with a man before in any way that would even suggest that he felt any attraction toward the same sex. He remembered Dean with his arm around various women in the past—often sitting across from them at bars with that same ridiculously charming grin on his face. There had been more than one occasion where Cas had settled himself into the back seat of the Impala only to find a bra or a pair of women’s lacy underwear on the floor, and he had awkwardly kicked them aside with his foot and pretended to have never seen it. Dean had never brought girls—or anyone for that matter—back with him to the bunker, but he most certainly never had any issue bringing them back to his hotel room. Each time he returned from a late night out drinking with an attractive woman on his arm, Sam had wordlessly gathered his laptop and the keys to the Impala before leading Castiel outside with him, the two of them finding somewhere quiet to sit and do nothing for an hour or two—Cas feeling uncomfortable and a tad envious all the while.
When Dean was washing the Impala in the garage, Cas leaned back against the hood, his eyes glistening with misdeed and want. “Jesus…” Dean had breathed, the running hose forgotten in his hand, the flow of water missing the bucket and flooding the floor. “Don’t fucking tempt me,” Dean had growled with a devilish grin.
“Smell them,” Castiel corrected, “I smell sulphur. But it’s faint.”
Dean was stung by the notion despite not knowing for sure if it were true. It made him desperate to prove himself.
Castiel thrust into him again. And again. And again. And again. Dean was still so tight; the sensation of him rocking Castiel’s mind into a kind of oblivion—the most glorious kind there could possibly be. In many ways, he felt almost outside of himself—all the shivers of bliss inside his core but the mania of it all drawing him to the outside. It was as though his skin was alight with divine fire; the heat of his skin flush against the heat of Dean’s until he couldn’t actually distinguish the difference anymore.
Cas actually thought that was a good idea, but he decided not to subject Dean to it. “No. Just… talk.”
He had armed himself with an angel blade, readying himself for what he expected would be a fight. Dean followed suit and slipped his own blade free, clasping it tight in anticipation. He knew there was no chance of getting out of this unscathed.
And now Cas had irrevocably left all of that behind.
“So… what now?” Dean asked breathily. He pressed his sleeve to his bleeding nose and winced at the touch. Together they looked a sight—Sam’s lip busted and his knuckles swollen and bloody. Dean with his bruised and bleeding nose, his hair crusted in drying blood from the cut to the back of his head, the gash on his cheek stinging, and, he assumed, with the faint imprint of Castiel’s hand around his sore throat.
It still didn’t sound real to his own ears, but it felt horrible and true on his tongue. It had been what he feared he might one day say after Castiel admitted his suicidal thoughts to him.
With tears burning his eyes, Dean had slipped the photo back into the Bible and put it away as he had found it. Though he had revisited it time and time again in the middle of the night whenever he couldn’t sleep. Which was often.
“I’m sorry,” Cas whispered, “I truly didn’t mean to hurt you. I just…”
“It’s too bright,” Dean said. He was already seeing spots and his retinas threatened to burn if he looked directly at the rip.
Castiel could only watch. He was too weak to move, lying motionless in a crescent; cuffed hands in front of his face, back curved and legs stiff. His mouth barely opened and closed, both drawing in broken breaths and trying to speak. Trying to tell them to stop, to say he was sorry, to offer whatever they asked of him, and to finish his message to Dean. It was hard to prioritise what came first. His mind was too lost to fathom the reality he had trapped himself in. He was both here inside himself and out there, drifting away into another life. As his voice freed itself and actual words passed his lips, he spoke only Dean’s name. It was the only thing he could say.
“Doesn’t matter, Cas. I’ll explain it to you another time,” Dean said and tossed a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt at Castiel who instinctively put up his hands and caught them. “Get dressed, we’re going out.”
Castiel knelt down in front of Dean and took his hands into his own. “There are things you and Sam need to do. Things that are currently being neglected. And it is greatly my fault.”
“Right. Okay. We can do all that,” Dean eagerly interjected. He paused and laughed hollowly, “Well, except for the bees. TV, books, hot showers, coffee, and clean sheets. Easy. Isn’t there anything else, Cas? Stuff you haven’t tried? Music you haven’t listened to or foods you haven’t eaten?”
“I mean any relationship that became more than a fling has never ended well. And you and me? We’re both chaotic. Doesn’t exactly seem promising, does it?”
And it didn’t make saying goodbye any easier.
Dean squared his shoulders and tensed his jaw, the dimness of his eyes bursting again with light. If he had to go down, he’d go down swinging. Like with most things, Dean pushed it all down; the inner turmoil he felt, the guilt, the anxiety. He suppressed it all and threw himself into the fight, actually seeking out something to kill rather than waiting for it to find him. And it helped. He didn’t have to have any restraint here, he could just
“We’re not going to make it, Dean!”
Castiel whined, eager to turn around and pull Dean into him again, but he resisted the temptation and firmly placed his hands back above his head.  He rested his cheek against the wall. His body felt overheated by more than the steam.
“No, Cas. You wait here,” Dean said firmly. The hunter disappeared round the back of the car and Cas could hear him rummaging in the trunk for something. When he emerged, he was holding onto a machete.
“You’ll be safe?” Cas asked.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel admitted, “you stopped the apocalypse. What use would he be to you? What use am I?”
“Oh, you’ve made that clear,” Dean assured him. He tested the length of the blade to make sure it wasn’t blunt; after all, it had to be sharp enough to cut cleanly through a vampire’s neck. “I’ll be fifteen minutes, tops. Then we can hit the road, alright?”
“Well, I just… I know that when I got puked out of Purgatory, it took me a few weeks to find my sea legs,” Dean continued, urging Cas to open up to the truth; the same truth that Dean hadn’t been ready to hear.
Cas turned his eyes away, clenching them shut tightly as the light overwhelmed him and hot ashes burned his skin. He could feel the fibres of his clothes catching fire and the heat puckering the skin beneath in agonising scars. He was too weak to move, too battered to roll against the dirt and cobblestones to put out the flames. His mouth was far too dry to scream. Castiel merely whimpered and cowered, sure that the fire would encase him entirely just as he knew it had done them.
They helped teach one another: Cas explaining the entire process of creation (in excruciating detail). He told Dean about the molecular structure that formed the human anatomy and, most profoundly, what he considered to be the meaning of life; on which he had a confounding and unique perspective. Dean, meanwhile, explained the genius behind Led Zeppelin, the trick to starting a tab you never intend to pay off, and, jokingly, never to eat yellow snow (though Cas, in all seriousness, replied that if he ever happened upon snow that was any colour other than white, he wouldn’t think to approach it, let alone consume it).
“All the more reason to drink it,” Dean said with a faint, sympathetic smile.
And Dean wanted that too.
Dean was still shaken by Castiel’s sudden and unexpected question about love. It had been daunting him ever since. But his answer still hadn’t changed. Love did feel like shit. Love was nothing but pain.
(See the end of the chapter for
more. Dean had become a captive of his vices, and Sam could only ever watch and agonize over what his big brother was doing to himself.
The end.
“This is the only time you can get away with using that,” Cas allowed, though he knew that was a lie. Dean could, and would, always get his way somehow, and admittedly it wouldn’t take much.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Dean said as he dreamed of it. This, too, he quickly banished.
this better?
“Cosmopolitans?” Dean asked as Castiel carried the drinks over to the table. Already Cas felt a little unsteady on his feet, with his arms and legs tingling and his skin feeling flush. It took more concentration than normal to get the drinks to the table without spilling them; the effort made all the more difficult by the impractical shape of the glasses. He moved slow and set the drinks down with as steady a hand as he could muster, and then felt pride when he somehow succeeded.
Dean thought, but didn’t say. “He was my best friend. It isn’t about how I could use him. Or you. It’s just… I miss him.”
“C as in Cas, right?” He asked gently.
“Gone, obviously. But where?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean thought idly that perhaps he had been spoiled in that whenever Cas disappeared, he always came back. Hell, he’d watched Castiel explode at the snap of Lucifer’s fingers and still come back all in one piece. Cas was the only reassurance he had that God was still around, or that he even really existed in the first place.
It meant more to him than this place ever would.
He supposed there was a massive difference between holding humanity carefully in the palm of your hand, and being the humanity held in the palm of another. That’s what mortality felt like a lot of the time. Castiel was this miniscule, weak thing being crushed in the clutches of something much greater than him. And it was as if it didn’t know it was squeezing too hard; it couldn’t hear his desperate pleas for help or for a swift end to his misery.
“Just sit there,” Sam instructed gently once they reached the bathroom.
“You wanna kill him? Go ahead. But, Dean? ... I’m not playing any part in it,” Sam ground out. He spat Dean’s own words right back at him, and it whipped the air right from Dean’s lungs.
Since then, Cas had come to understand many things, but there was still just as much, if not more, that eluded him. It didn’t take long to witness fragility first hand. Sure, he had heard about it often, usually in the snide remarks the angels made about humans, sneering sometimes about their weakness and about the way they apparently liked to break one another. Cas had found their crude observations to be only partially true. There was so much on Earth that the untethered power of an angel could crush without even trying, and humans were indeed perilous and fragile things. But they deserved great care. They weren’t any less significant because of it. And Castiel had discovered that while humans did tend to break one another, there were countless others that sought to fix one another as well.
“Does that explain the wind?”
Cas had an understanding of the human anatomy—particularly with having taken a human vessel to now call his own—that allowed him to see how he could accidentally inflict pain were he not to take care. But Dean didn’t appear to be afflicted by this same concern. As if he had forgotten that Castiel had absolutely no experience in this area, or simply believed he already possessed the caution required.
He recalled the one time he had gotten too tired to drive, his eyes heavy and head drooping, his hands slipping dangerously low on the wheel. He had pulled over to the side of the road for a quick 20 minute rest. Then, with the startling flutter of his wings, Cas had appeared in the passenger seat. Dean had immediately sat upright, his eyes suddenly wide and alert. His racing heart had only settled once he recognised that there was no danger.
Those were the eyes that couldn’t recall having felt anything before. They were the eyes that would never be able to feel again.
Dean blushed a little and started to dig in Castiel’s bag, hiding his face from the former angel, “Absolutely not… I just… peeked at them.”
Dean startled. “Wh…what?”
“What was he saying to you? In the photo, what was he whispering in your ear?” Castiel asked.
Dean’s fingers brushed through his hair and slipped down to his shoulders, pulling him in nearer. Castiel’s hands sought whatever part of Dean he could touch as he finally began to lose every shred of self-control he had. He clasped at Dean’s biceps and clawed hungrily at his back, soon tracing down his chest and holding his hips before repeating the process over again. He was far more manic now than the hunter; almost stunned by the sensation of touch and compelled by the warmth of another person, and he took Dean’s bottom lip between his with far more reckless abandon.
“We go to apocalypse-land, we save Mum and bring her home,” Dean said, “and we bring him home too.”
The woman uncomfortably cleared her throat but didn’t wait for them to part before she strode away without another word. Dean could just make out the sound of her flats on the vinyl floor as she left.
Castiel leaned back in his seat and withdrew his fingers from the keyboard, hesitating to type another letter. His posture had become stiff and he stretched against an ache in his shoulders, forcing himself to retreat entirely from his task. He could let it wait just this minute, he reasoned, as the ticking clock in his head struck another hour closer to despair. Time wasn’t on his side, but neither was Dean and right now the latter was hurting him more. He hadn’t seen Dean in a few days. The halls had been missing the sound of his music and the smell of his cooking and even the heavy tread of his footfalls. Dean’s absence was a pervasive void and Cas felt it through and through. He yearned for him desperately.
“I thought you said we were going to help one another,” Castiel pointed out.
And when Cas finally stopped crying, Dean wordlessly pulled the gloves from his hands, set them down on the edge of the sink, and guided him back to bed.
After all, angels didn’t need to sleep.
Cas looked at him knowingly. “You tend to shut out others and turn to liquor and sexual relations with various women. And I didn’t need Sam to tell me that it was unhealthy and ineffective, I could see that for myself. Sure, some relief comes from it, but it’s only temporary.”
Dean sat at the edge of Castiel’s bed and cleared his throat.
“I understand.”
It appeared as though they were stopped at a gas station, though it was impossible to tell where, and Cas decided that it didn’t matter. It didn’t seem as though there was an itinerary for their road trip, and there wasn’t a destination in mind either, which gave the journey a sense of endlessness—as if the two of them would be on the road forever. Castiel liked the sound of that though deep down he knew it wasn’t really the case. They would eventually have to return to the bunker, and Sam and Dean would resume their hunting and Cas would bury himself in the fictitious worlds from the television screen.
“Not here,” Dean answered finally. He left his hand there against Cas’ skin for a few moments longer, “He didn’t care, Cas…tiel. He decided it was a mess we made and should clean up ourselves. He granted us a few minor ‘miracles’ and that was that.”
“You can’t know that.”
Castiel was dizzy, his skin still prickling with intoxication, so he had to focus on the movement of his wrist now and his grip, dazedly concerned that maybe he was doing it wrong since he’d only ever touched himself before. But his touch elicited more breathless moans from the hunter and Dean cursed quietly, his hips thrusting into Castiel’s hand on their own accord. Cas took that as a good sign and quickened his pace, only pausing once to spit on his hand for more lubrication.
Somehow, he just knew.
All he understood was that he needed Dean, and was constantly in awe at how lucky and undeserving he was to have him. And how nothing seemed to matter more than him.
“It’s your turn,” Dean said, gesturing wildly at the small television set. The sound had once again faded out until it appeared that the people pictured on the screen were simply miming.
Now Dean was struck by how
Maybe Castiel wanted it just as much, if not more.
“Cas!” Dean shouted again, his throat dry and voice hoarse.
Cas turned to the sink and glared at him over his shoulder. “Don’t be petulant.”
While he and Sam were out looking for Castiel, Dean was awfully distressed. More so as the hours passed with little hope of finding him in time. There was a trail to follow; people who recalled seeing a man that matched Castiel’s description, which assured Dean that, for the moment, Cas was still on the move. But every trail had an end, and Dean thought that maybe he wouldn’t like whatever he found there; assuming they ever actually found it at all.
But Dean wasn’t bothered. In fact, he looked pleased. The hunter stood upright and tugged the knife from the lifeless corpse, pausing to wipe the blade clean on the werewolf’s filthy clothes.
“Shirt off, please,” Castiel instructed.
“That’s another concern for later,” Cas began to clean the actual cut and Dean winced again.
That was until Sam and Dean returned to the bunker, their footfalls heavy in the hallway as they took to tending to their wounds and preparing their used weapons for whatever hunt was to follow. Castiel listened to their movements and pondered what it was they were doing, at least with as little curiosity as he could muster. Truthfully, he stopped listening once he was sure neither of them was especially hurt. Quickly losing interest, Cas turned dismissively on his side with his back to the door and thought briefly that he ought to get up soon and greet them. He thought he would. Soon. Maybe later. Perhaps tomorrow would be better.
“You lie,” Tabbris spat.
“Dean—”
They both fell silent again. The wind continued to rage outside, making the cabin whistle quietly as the heavy gusts slipped through all the fine cracks in the windows and walls. The window panes shook with every deep crack of thunder and the lights flickered, threatening to throw them into darkness at any minute. Though Cas wasn’t afraid. The cabin walls could cave in on him and he wouldn’t care—if it weren’t for Dean that is. Cas could endure any kind of pain, no matter how much or for how long, just as long as Dean was safe. Even if that meant Dean was only safest when he was away from him.
“Do you want me to fuck you, Cas?” Dean asked and nipped at his earlobe.
And then he had died again when Metatron stabbed him. There was pain then too, but the life drained from him slowly and he just felt empty somehow. He thought that maybe his body had been in shock—which would explain feeling numb—but it was saying goodbye to Sam that was the worst. He remembered Sam’s arms holding him up and half carrying him across the room, and he remembered losing mobility in his legs as he slowly died. Dean remembered how it was so different from the first time: most likely because of the mark of Cain.
Before he had just hoped to die without pain. Now he just hoped to die. It didn’t matter how.
Castiel nodded quickly and waited for Dean to duck back into the bathroom before daring to get up from the couch to retrieve the razor for him. Cas kept his distance and held his arm through the open door, keeping his eyes averted to the TV though there was nothing on. He felt Dean’s fingers brush against his hand as he took the razor from him and Cas withdrew his hand and quickly buried himself beneath the blanket again.
Dean kissed him then, effectively cutting him off midsentence. Cas was so relieved to receive any display of affection from Dean that the thought was swept right out of his head. The words dimmed and then disappeared entirely from his tongue.
“We think that maybe the portals are opening in Jack’s vicinity, whether by accident or on purpose—”
“It can. We did it,” Dean told him.
Dean’s fears rang true and when he and Sam burst in through the door to see Castiel tied to a chair, his torso littered with fresh wounds from being tortured. There was a look in the man’s eyes: the look of fear, but also that of acceptance, as though he was preparing himself to die. Maybe a part of him even wanted it. Seeing Cas like that broke Dean.
There was a long, heavy silence before Sam finally let out a dejected sigh. Dean looked up to meet his eye and saw that Sam’s expression had softened considerably. There still loomed the dread of what more there was to come and where Dean’s decision could possibly lead them, but, little by little, it was being buried beneath his sympathy. Sam placed a comforting hand on Dean’s shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze. Dean got the distinct feeling of being more like the little brother, and though this wasn’t the first time, he was still a little taken aback. He’d gotten so used to being the big, protective brother, mother, and father to Sam that it still felt foreign to him whenever their roles somehow became reversed. Even after all these years, and after all they had been through, Dean never thought he was someone worth taking care of.
“It doesn’t bother you?” Dean asked doubtfully, not believing him even for a second.
Castiel tentatively reached up and brushed his thumb across a bruise on Dean’s neck. Somehow, despite all the evidence, that one little bruise was the only thing that convinced him it was all real.
But suddenly there they were; Sam, Dean, and Castiel, all together on the other side of the portal as it sealed shut.
“What exactly do you mean? Do you mean this room?  This place? This world?” Castiel sounded sarcastic, but Dean couldn’t help but think the question was a genuine one.
“It was just a stupid, drunken mistake, Sam,” Dean muttered, casting his head down in apparent shame. “You were right about Cas, okay? About…” He sighed. A tightness crept into his chest and clenched around his lungs. “About me loving him. And it’s been hard letting him go…”
“Well, that’s ominous,” Dean muttered and cleared his throat. “You come from a world in which my brother and I were never born. And it has been destroyed by a war between the God Squad and Team Satan, right?”
“Of course,” Dean confirmed with a small hint of a smile.
By now the space between he and Cas was slim to none, and yet the angel hadn’t made a move to strike. Briefly, Dean felt almost chuffed by this. Mollified. He got the sense that the miracle he had long ago asked for had somehow been granted to him after all. But the closer he got, the wilder Cas appeared. The Impala’s headlights highlighted the stains of blood and dirt on Castiel’s clothes, which, though not unusual or something Dean had never seen before, somehow made him into something war ravaged and cold. Overtime, Dean’s Castiel had slowly started to perceive and understand appearances, and even went so far as to take more care with his own by keeping clean and presentable.
Dean’s eyes flashed dark and his face turned pale, all the colour creeping away and leaving his expression gaunt. His jaw clenched and his teeth visibly grinded, with the corners of his jaw shifting from the effort. Cas slowly panned his eyes down and saw, as he had dreaded, Dean’s tightly clenched fists.
“Rarely,” Dean admitted, “we usually just eat out or pick up what we can from gas stations. We’re on the move more than we are at home.”
“Hey…hey,” Dean placed his hand on Castiel’s knee, relief flooding through him to see Castiel’s eyes boring into his.
Was this Castiel’s portal?
“Lonely?” Cas hoped for elaboration.
“We didn’t feel as if we had another choice,” Dean said meekly, looking away ashamedly.
Though he remembered Dean’s; clear as day. And he said it. The one simple word like the most tremendous thing that had ever—and will ever—pass his lips.
He realised he was still completely naked; only covered by a thin blanket that he had no recollection of ever getting out from the trunk. He could only assume that Dean had gotten it for him though there was no way of knowing when. Dazedly, Cas shrugged the blanket aside and tried to focus solely on getting dressed which was no easy feat. The backseat somehow felt less spacious than before, with the process of undressing seeming effortless compared to the complication of redressing. His boxers and t-shirt went on smoothly enough, but the jeans were near impossible and he had to wriggle about the seat just to get the waistband up to his thighs, at which point the ankle hems became stuck around his feet. It was possible for anyone to witness the struggle were they to notice him through the window, but he felt so awful that he simply couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Well, I didn’t get killed. And it worked,” Cas muttered dully, glancing briefly in Dean’s direction.
“You really believe that?” Sam asked doubtfully.
Dean was still shell-shocked, and he briefly mulled over all the words that hadn’t passed his lips, and he swallowed them back, thinking it was best to keep them for another day. What he didn’t realise, was that that day would never come.
Cas could feel more than the storm that was raging outside. He could feel Dean. He could feel the heat rising under Dean’s skin, the beating of his heart as it began to thrum more rapidly inside his chest; he could even sense the hairs on Dean’s arms as they stood on end. Something was shifting. Changing. There was something about Dean that Cas had often felt before, but now it came to him more strongly than ever, and Cas couldn’t understand why.
Dean lightly slapped his hand away from the handle and grasped it himself in defiance. “It’s
“It can be a bit much, can’t it? Going from nothing to everything all at once?” Dean asked.
Thinking of it, Castiel thought it may be time to pray. There was no good in delaying any longer. And with his whole body on edge, the threat of a gun-toting man playing at his mind, Cas thought that the presence of an angel may be the best thing for him. They had called to him in desperation. They longed for saviour. Castiel was offering all he had to save them, and so he trusted that they wouldn’t kill him—not yet. He was better off with the angel than alone out here, still paranoid he was in trouble.
She was far stronger than him, but she was also wild with ravenous hunger and her eyes were bloodshot with a frantic need for his blood. This left her vulnerable to him, and he threw her aside with a massive exertion of energy and his lungs protested heavily against the effort. Dean finally rolled his leg out from under the table and he scuttled across the floor towards his dropped machete. The sudden movement dragged the vampire’s attention away from Castiel and back to Dean and she grabbed the hunter by the scruff of his shirt and lifted him with ease so his feet dangled off the floor. Cas rushed forward just as the vampire flung Dean hard against the wall and the hunter fell in a heap in the corner, blood gushing from a wound on his forehead. The vampire stood still and sniffed at the air, her body trembling now with overwhelming hunger and instinct, and Cas was completely lost to her. Castiel sliced through her neck with one quick swing and her head fell cleanly from her shoulders.
But the truth was bound to catch up with him sooner rather than later.
Dean caressed Cas’ chin with his thumb, the touch freeing him from the clutches of his own thoughts. In the dim light of the hall, their eyes met; mystifying green and cloudless blue.
But they
“Having a good day today, sir?” the young clerk asked, not actually committed to getting an answer.
“Yes, but—”
“Okay. But whatever he says, don’t let him free,” Sam warned finally.
He hadn’t heard anything on angel radio for months now, and he had come to believe that he had been entirely omitted from Heaven and the angels. He had been human for too long. Everything that had made him
“Your feet too apparently,” Cas groaned and Dean chortled lightly.
Somehow, Castiel made even the bitter taste sweet.
“Where was He?!” Castiel shouted. He sounded so desperate, the words almost like a broken cry.
They were different together with the privacy of four walls, with all curious eyes unable to penetrate through layers of brick. Dean had no hesitation in sitting close and touching his skin, his hands occasionally adventuring away from his back to graze his ribcage or his thighs. Dean was always touching him in some capacity, only withdrawing to change sides on whichever tape that was playing. Cas wondered what changed. Why did it matter if someone was there to witness them? It all seemed perfectly innocent—sometimes even disappointingly so. There was so much more he wished to do, and so many ways he would love to be touched. But, alas, these daydreams never came to pass.
“You need an ‘and’?”
Dean ignored him and cautiously raised a hand, though he hadn’t yet considered his intentions. He just needed to know Cas was real. Though he hadn’t decided whether to embrace him or to place a protective hand on his shoulder. Maybe just to touch the material of his coat would be enough to convince Dean that Cas was well and truly there. And maybe it would be enough for Castiel too; to convince him that Dean, too, was real. Dean hoped Cas would recognise him, even if he wasn’t sure why or where from.
“Again, anatomically, some may have male genitals but no human vessel is just one big—” Castiel started seriously.
On the drive home, Castiel requested a cassette to be played on the car radio. Dean wordlessly dug around in the glove compartment, never looking away from the road, and selected the first one he touched. He put it on and kept the volume relatively low, purposely avoiding Castiel’s face in the rear-view mirror. He couldn’t stand to see that appreciative expression on his face. Dean couldn’t watch his eyes come alight with elation. It was far too humanising. Too much like Cas.
Dean chuckled and failed to mask his smile. “You’ll live. I’m sure of it.”
Their time together was limited and they both knew it. Rather, they were sickeningly aware of it every minute of every day. Cas could hardly spare an hour to sleep, tossing and turning throughout the night, never slipping into a deep enough slumber to dream. He knew the consequences of this were beginning to show on his face. The already dark circles under his eyes were puffy and shadowed like bruises; the redness of his sunburned skin had already faded and peeled, leaving something sallow behind in its wake; his eyes were eternally dim and tired, desperate for rest.
After all, that seemed to be where everything always went wrong. Dean selling his soul to Hell in exchange for his brother’s life could arguably be where this whole mess started. Unwittingly breaking the first of the 66 seals, Lucifer being freed from the cage, Castiel’s God rampage; it all seemed like dominoes falling into place, all leading him here to this hell adjacent nightmare.
Castiel was none of those things. And he easily accepted that; the only trepidation being that perhaps he was too selfish to let Dean accept it too.
Cas just looked like the best version of himself, which Dean hadn’t seen in a long time since something always seemed to get in the way: whether that be Castiel’s vessel falling apart from the leviathan writhing inside him, or dazed and drowning in hospital clothes that were almost two sizes too big, to being covered in filth and with overgrown hair in Purgatory.
Dean got out of the car and wordlessly started to fill up on gas; focusing more attention to the gas pump than what was necessary. He turned back only once to toss money into Castiel’s lap without ever meeting his gaze.
“Hey, you feeling okay?” Dean asked unexpectedly. Something in Castiel’s expression must have suggested that there was far more to the ex-angel’s attitude and behaviour than just simple exhaustion.
Cas was struck by pain at the very thought.
“Relax. Trust me.”
Sam came down the stairs and gently took Castiel by the elbow, wordlessly guiding him away. Castiel allowed it but seemed unsure, and maybe even unwilling, to go. There was a hesitance in his step that Dean couldn’t help but notice and hold onto. But he didn’t argue and left with Sam. And Sam returned a few minutes later without him.
Castiel’s eyes slowly drifted up to Dean, peering at him through his lashes with what was either curiosity or contempt—it was difficult to tell which.
Somehow, despite its tenderness, it was the most heated kiss yet.
Except for the scar of his handprint.
The morning after.
All he knew was that it was there and it wouldn’t go away and… hell, truth be told, he didn’t want it to. All he understood was that it was distracting. It turned Castiel’s presence into company with powerful baggage that, yes, sometimes actually made Dean weak at the knees.
“You’re talking to Sam again?”
But then, without knowing it, the word started to become something more to him. There came to him a faint fluttering in his chest that he couldn’t explain, and an invisible tether that kept pulling him back to Dean. Sometimes when he looked at Dean he felt something so utterly indescribable, but so very divine. And slowly, Cas couldn’t help but to start applying words to the sensation, and strangely he found that they always fit.
And then they all wished they hadn’t.
Dean pulled up outside the bar and tucked his keys deep into the pocket of his jeans, where he knew his inebriated mind would know to look when it came time to either risk driving home or to settle himself across the backseat. It was where Sam knew to look first whenever he had to come and collect his drunken older brother.
At least it seemed a grateful effort to make use of what Sam and Dean had gifted him, so he carefully shaved, only cutting himself once. He rinsed away the remainder of the shaving cream and delicately pressed a small dot of toilet paper over the cut, the tissue quickly sticking with a fine, red spot in the middle. In the mirror, what almost resembled his old self looked back at him. He sighed. Perhaps he was imagining it, but he swore he already looked older. Maybe it was because he certainly felt like it. Like his bones were turning to stone. Each joint ached upon sitting down and standing up. Looking closer, he touched the pale bags under his eyes and wondered if all humans were this aware of their bodies slowly but surely wasting away. What a curse that must be, were his assumptions right. He again felt a newfound sympathy for people, and a hatred for his father who so clearly created humanity this way: so impermanent and fragile.
Sophia hesitated. Castiel could see her shoulders soften. Her arms fell away from her chest and hung limply at her sides. She had called to him, lost and confused and frightened. A part of her had to believe that he could help her. A part of her had to know that he would want to. She wouldn’t have called otherwise… unless… unless help was never on her mind. Unless only revenge was.
“It was… rather perplexing,” Cas admitted quietly, “I almost called Sam to ask what it meant or what I ought to do.”
else. Just as he had tried, in the face of all his mistakes, and thought, despairingly, he ought to try once more. There was always something else.
This time Cas didn’t hesitate to toss back his drinks since he already knew how awful it would taste and decided that putting it off would only worsen the anticipation. It didn’t go down any better than the first time and he decided that he would request something sweeter to drink next time. Dean mimicked him and pushed the six empty glasses together in the middle of the table.
Castiel thought that, maybe, just maybe, Dean had finally taken it upon himself to ask what Cas wanted, and had found that it wasn’t more than what he could give.
Dean was clearly exhausted when he stumbled into Castiel’s room the following morning. Cas could actually smell the faint scent of beer emanating off of Dean. He realised the hunter must have been drinking into the night, but he couldn’t estimate for how long or how many bottles he had consumed. At the very least, Dean seemed mostly capable of walking what was almost a straight line, and he was clearly aware as to why he was there. It seemed like a premeditated decision rather than one made on a drunken whim. Cas sat up in bed and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He could feel his hair almost standing on end, probably having tossed back and forth throughout the night; he remembered doing so long before he fell into the clutches of sleep. Yesterday he had gotten far too close to acting upon his desires, and he knew what kind of consequences would have followed had he done so. He couldn’t dare risk making such a mistake—another mistake of a different calibre. Only when he felt he had decently reprimanded himself did he close his eyes and sleep.
“How do you know? You don’t even know where we’re going,” Cas argued.
him. That was the part Cas couldn’t dismiss. The man had stared so intensely, his eyes wandering so thoroughly, that it had to be more than coincidence.
Castiel beamed, relieved that Dean was willing to partake, and the tension between them had already started to alleviate. Dean’s posture softened and his hands slid to a lower position on the steering wheel. In turn, Cas shifted comfortably in his seat and folded up the newspaper; sure now that he no longer needed it. They each had something else to think about. But Cas’ thoughts still turned to Dean; admiring his profile and observing his unkempt hair. There had always been little time in the past to appreciate Dean in detail. But now, looking through human eyes, it was hard to imagine what used to keep him otherwise distracted. Since being on Earth, Cas had developed a fondness for humankind and found value in their unique qualities. He often sought the meaning in their actions and wanted to understand and relate to their undying determination to not only survive but also thrive.
The false hope was like a security blanket that he needed just as much as he resented it.
Then, after a moment of hesitation, Dean sent another.
But the truth was… he didn’t want to be. He didn’t wish for that other pillow—the one that had unofficially become Dean’s—to be cold and vacant. Cas didn’t want his thoughts to hang idly in the recesses of his mind with nobody there to share them with. He didn’t desire for his skin to remain untouched, his body rejected without the solidity of someone there beside him. Castiel had come to rely on his back curving perfectly into Dean’s side, the hunter’s fingers idly running across his spine, occasionally dipping into the waistband of his pyjamas or under his shirt with a shiver coursing through Cas’ body.
Dean sidled in closer and wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist once he stood to get another stack. Dean leaned in and traced Castiel’s neck with his lips, kissing lightly between his neck and shoulders up to his earlobe. Cas sighed lightly and tilted his head slightly to one side, gifting Dean with more room to taste him.
“Dean—” Castiel persisted. Dean sighed, stood up, and flexed his arms carefully, testing the flexibility of the bandage and apparently feeling satisfied that it wouldn’t hinder him in any way.
Castiel was sorry.
His body was shocked by the sudden absence of alcohol. The physical symptoms of which warned of the extent of his dependency. Even still, Dean had endured and persisted with his newfound sobriety. After the first few days, when the illness began to ease, Dean found himself itching for something to do. He’d never realised just how little time he spent bored due to the constant flow of beers. Drinking had kept his mind, hands, and mouth occupied day after day. Without it, Dean wasn’t entirely sure what to do with himself. He quickly grew restless and agitated as he itched for a beer. Even just a swig or a sip. Maybe even just a quick sniff of an open bottle would be enough to appease him for a while.
“Well… no, not yet,” Sam admitted, “but we’re working on it. It’s a bit hard to put theory like this into practice, you know? And we don’t want to waste time on what probably won’t even work.”
Dean’s optimism grew exponentially after that, as if the very idea of seeing Castiel again renewed something within him that had become lost since first waking up in Purgatory. He was refreshed, his eyes alight with a new life and he walked eagerly ahead. The monsters kept coming but they hardly seemed a concern anymore, and Dean didn’t find himself so desperate for the distraction. Killing them was work, nothing more; and Dean was still on his game: determined not to be delayed more than he needed to be.
Sam and Dean always walked around armed, no matter where they went. They went to gas stations and diners and pizza places with a gun in their belt. For Castiel, this had become commonplace. If any possible threat approached, both boys pulled out their guns and pointed with perfect aim. It happened so often Cas no longer so much as blinked. For them, it was a precaution. A valid safety requirement that had boded well for them thus far. So perhaps it wasn’t unusual for other civilians to carry weapons on them also. In fact, Castiel could recall him and the Winchesters having guns pulled on them numerous times. He no longer blinked at this either, even with the barrel pointed at his head. He couldn’t discern when it was appropriate to worry.
Castiel sighed and tried to stretch, but the restraints kept him securely in place. Dean made no move to assist him. “Sam tries too hard to appeal to my better nature. He insists we’re friends—” The angel wrinkled his nose and his lip curled.
“Hard not to, Cas. I could hear you from the end of the hall,” Dean said.
Sam dabbed at the split in his lip with the back of his hand and shifted hastily from one foot to the other. It was apparent that he was at a loss as to what he ought to do. Which was disquieting since Dean was depending on his brother for answers. After all, it was no secret that Sam was the smarter of the two, and probably the more reasonable and grounded as well. Dean knew he could always turn to him. But this time Sam wasn’t just unsure, he was troubled too.
There was another voice. It was closer and urgent and immediate in Castiel’s ear. He felt heated, calloused hands around his wrists, pulling down hard. Cas’ hands fell away from his ears and the white in his eyes slowly dissipated to reveal the road and the canopy of trees on either side. His muscles couldn’t loosen on their own and instead remained tight and pained in his shoulders and lower back. The taste of blood intensified inside his mouth and he leaned forward, shakily, to spit onto the dirt. Dean automatically reached forward and ran his thumb across Cas’ bottom lip, and it came back red.
But Purgatory wasn’t the place. This wasn’t the time. It was a boundary he had never crossed. And Benny was watching. That, and his angel just admitted to leaving Dean to fend for himself in the land inhabited exclusively by monsters. Dean didn’t know what to do with this harsh truth.
He wished he and Sam had been granted normal lives; he wished they had never been witness to all the awful terrors that now haunted his sleep; he wished his mother and father were alive and with them, and he wished for his Cas to be here in place of Castiel.
Cas had been there when Dean needed him, so how could Dean justify not being there for Castiel?
“Not looking for an apology, Cas.” Dean drank the last of his beer and pushed the empty bottle aside. “I just want to see you happy. Actually happy. Not the fake kind.”
This time, his longing was so desperate and so loud he knew it could be heard for miles.
romantically involved?”
He almost sounded hopeful.
After that, Dean’s tone noticeably dipped, and he grudgingly recalled Castiel’s partnership with a demon named Crowley, and how he tried to become God, and how he released the leviathan into the world.
Which made Cas feel like it was somehow his fault.
“You sure? You could, I don’t know, get some pancakes? Put some maple syrup on there, a little bacon on the side… crispy but with a little fat on it—”
He saw the shadow of Dean sit upright in front of him and the faint outline of his arm moving across his face, followed by the feeling of a t-shirt wiping over his flaccid groin. The hunter clumsily cleaned him up in the dark before nudging Cas to move over to the edge of the seat. Castiel suddenly felt much drunker than before and actually heavy headed as the exhilaration alleviated, so he said nothing as he shuffled to the side as much as he could without falling. His arms automatically wrapped around Dean’s waist as he nestled tightly into his side. The seat wasn’t big enough to fit them both like this, but they tried anyway, shifting awkwardly until Dean’s head rested on Castiel’s chest, one arm dangling over him and the other squished between their bodies. Cas had an arm trapped beneath Dean’s body that was surely going a bit numb, but there was simply no other place to put it, and he didn’t dare try to rearrange them. They were both uncomfortable, but neither of them would have it any other way—not if it meant being apart.
“Because it’s 7:30,” Dean answered coolly. The hunter resumed the practice of kissing lightly at Cas’ neck, though now the effort required more awkward manoeuvring as the former angel was currently curled so tightly within himself.
Dean would have felt totally illiterate in Cas’ vicinity if it weren’t for the angel’s ever-growing understanding of humanity and all of life’s intricacies.
“That’s exactly why we ought to start now,” Cas reasoned.
“You’ll probably feel some discomfort. If you feel any pain, just tell me to stop,” Sam said.
you not to.
Dean’s thoughts turned to Castiel, and he wondered if Castiel was thinking of him too. He remembered the way Castiel’s hands had held onto his waist and the comfort of his strong hands. He remembered the way Castiel had kissed him back, his lips parting for Dean. And he remembered having the material of Cas’ tie and coat in his hands.
Castiel peered into the library from the war room and saw that nobody was there. Distantly, he could hear a few unfamiliar voices and he supposed it was the television. From that, he determined Dean’s likely whereabouts, as he always had the volume up too loud. But Cas knew Sam wasn’t there with him, as he couldn’t hear him arguing for control of the remote. It had actually been an hour or so since he had last seen Sam, so he thought that maybe he had gone on a beer run. At least Cas hoped that was the case. For days he had been under their watchful eyes—being scrutinized for everything he did or did not do. Wherever he turned one of them seemed to materialise out of thin air, always offering excuses of some kind that were often unlikely and sometimes even absurd. They were watching him, waiting expectantly for him to resume the pattern of a dying man.
“You, I suppose,” Castiel admitted, “but these feelings you arouse are beyond what I can understand. There are enough words for it: lust, longing, affection, attraction, endearment… but before they were only ever words and now it’s almost impossible to make sense of what it is to feel them.”
“Thinking bout me, I hope,” Dean laughed with an obvious wink, trying yet again to make Castiel blush.
“I didn’t think I’d be gone this long,” Dean sighed, “I’m on the road a lot, but this time I’m actually starting to feel homesick.”
“Absolutely,” the cashier responded, relieved. These were far easier words to share. He turned his back and slipped a map out of the magazine rack behind him and opened it up onto the counter. “Where're you heading?”
“How? How could
“Angels lie.”
But… hadn’t he? How was this any different to suicide?
“Except this,” Tabbris corrected her.
“Dunno, I just felt like it.” The bed creaked as Dean also tried to find a comfortable position, readjusting the pillow at his back. “I was listening to some music and figured I should share it.”
“Dean—,” Sam murmured tensely, “what are you doing?”
And eventually Castiel came back to the same word he had never understood for all those years.
“I borrowed it! He stole it from my pants!” Cas pointed an accusing finger at Dean.
“I don’t understand,” Cas frowned, “and this, to me, seems like a serious discussion. Which you said we weren’t having today. Is it not serious?”
Castiel’s brow furrowed. “Why?”
“It’s nothing,” Castiel tried.
“We are?”
“O…okay,” Cas stammered nervously.
“I’m making it the point.”
He had tried to keep Dean from stopping him.
“Dean—” Cas began and then interrupted himself by leaning into Dean again; this time deepening the kiss and placing his hands purposely on the small of the hunter’s back. “—As much as I love you, if you ever wake me up before 9 again...” Another kiss. “I’ll smite you. I don’t know how, but I’ll find a way, and I’ll do it.”
“My grace.”
Cas was unique. He, like the Winchesters themselves, had imperfections. He didn’t quite work the way he should; just like that broken handle and that bent hanger. Yet that was precisely why he fit. Those peculiar flaws were things that made up the man Dean loved. And Dean had never wanted him to change.
Somehow, Dean always understood.
Though they had discussed the events at the pub a few hours prior, neither of them had made an effort to strike up a conversation. Instead, upon coming in through the motel door, they had each gone about doing their own things. Castiel had taken a long shower before changing into his pyjamas early for the night, leaving Dean to browse the web on his laptop, before they switched places and Dean took the bathroom and Cas the couch. But it was comfortable. They circled each other in what felt like a familiar pattern in which no words were needed to express what it was they wanted to do.
“If you dislike it so much then you can get up and fix it yourself.”
He wanted to kiss Castiel, but, with his hand having already reached out slightly, Dean retreated. His hand hesitated, and then withdraw, his heart heavy and burdened and lost because he couldn’t kiss him the way he wanted. If he did, there was no way Cas would let him go. The angel would find a way to die at his side. And Dean would not let that happen.
“It’s the same for me. I know you have reservations about the angels—as do I, but that was my life for a very long time. For millennia. From creation to less than a month ago, you understand?”
Dean circled the table once before selecting a chair and sitting down. Or rather stumbling down and almost slipping off the edge to the floor. He was sober enough to steady himself and kick his feet up onto the table, but the room wasn’t entirely in focus. He could navigate his way from one room to the next without incident, but all the details in between had faded into oblivion. Dean sipped his beer—having actually forgotten how many he’d had already—and idly peeled the edges of the label off.
“Why do you always have to be so stubborn?” Castiel sighed and knelt down, carefully draping the coat over Dean as best as he could.
He blinked in surprise to see the younger Winchester standing there.
Dean sat on the hood of the Impala and watched Cas as he opened his arms to the wind as it picked up speed. It was a good day, as far as the bitter beginnings of winter would allow. The sun was combatting the cold breeze that Cas knew would steadily evolve into a gusty flurry of snow. Sooner rather than later, the sun would lose the war and they’d all be temporarily pitched into days spent bundled in many layers, warming their hands in front of the heater, and kicking the slush out of their shoes.
He was afraid of either answer. Dean neither wanted Castiel to stay or to go, and no amount of thought had lessened his confliction. Instead, he simply lost sleep and steadily drank—making more of an effort to clean up after himself to hide how much liquor he actually consumed—and tried to lose himself in cases that failed to present themselves. Nothing had truly helped.
Then Cas felt Dean’s lips on his neck, trailing slow kisses across his skin and sucking softly just under his ear. Castiel’s breath hitched and he gripped Dean’s shirt tighter, the material held firmly now in his fists and not letting go. He tilted his neck to the side a little so Dean had more room to taste him. The hunter said nothing as his kisses travelled along the length of Castiel’s throat and along his jawline. Castiel said nothing as he pulled Dean in closer.
“Dean, I can’t,” Cas stared forlornly at the ground. If he were to look up, he’d give in. He always did in the end.
But as they eased into it—still gradually exploring the boundaries of one another—the manic heat was like a familiar warmth, and Cas found that there was no passion lost in that. As they easily shed one another’s clothes, the former angel discovered a whole new sensation in kissing Dean without being under the influence of alcohol and without the confines of the Impalas backseat. There was something new here, yet something wonderfully familiar as well, and a quiet moan passed Castiel’s lips.
For the first time in days, he forgot about losing his grace and the angels falling.
“Speak up,” Purah ordered and again cut deeper into his flesh.
“I think the bed might be more comfortable,” Cas breathed.
Dean nodded.
“Last night… you said that ‘if I had to ask’…” Cas murmured weakly, “what did you mean? What did I have to ask?”
Sam was washing his hands at the sink and Cas cast his eyes away in discomfort.
“So lucky,” Dean said before standing up to dispose of his empty bottle.
“I don’t like the word romantic,” Dean wrinkled his nose, “I don’t know. It just doesn’t sit well with me.”
“You know Dean. Even if he doesn’t acknowledge it right away, he always recognises effort. Just show him you mean it, whatever
“I am all about your peace of mind,” Dean muttered and winced again when the Impala thudded through a particularly deep puddle.
“I didn’t just mean with the song, Cas,” Dean murmured. “Are you satisfied with this? With me?”
do this.”
There was a long, heavy silence and Castiel didn’t move at all. Though Dean tried, he couldn’t meet his eye. He cleared his throat awkwardly, and resisted the temptation to stand and walk right up to the angel, and to put his arms around him. Dean couldn’t think how he should try to console him; assuming he should even try at all.
Dean was his.
Cas nudged Dean’s shoulder with his own and smiled sheepishly, “the road less travelled by making all the difference?”
Dean was greeted by those warm, gentle blue eyes and he felt safe.
“It was the sound of agony, Dean,” he said and his voice wavered.
Castiel set the full bucket down and retrieved a sponge, soaking it through and setting it down dripping on the trunk of the car. He stared at it curiously before looking to Dean for guidance. Dean chuckled light-heartedly and dunked his own sponge into the bucket before leading by example. He carefully washed the windows and gestured for the angel to copy his motions. Castiel took to it quite easily from there, losing himself in the task and rinsing his sponge out periodically in silence. Dean slowed and mostly allowed him to continue on his own. It was better to watch the easy smile that played at Castiel’s lips and the rare softness to his posture.
“And there’s two of us.”
He didn’t need an answer.
Cas nodded his head accordingly and put the magazine back, thinking it was probably wise to take Dean’s answer very seriously. He hadn’t expected anything good to come out of name like Kardashian, and Dean had confirmed his suspicions to be true.
Dean did his best to ignore Sam’s stare and gestured meekly to the books and papers scattered across the table.
Dean took his time to drink his solitary glass of water, all the while inhaling the scent of its clean, unthreatening, contents. And, with his belly full and clean, his mind sober, and vision clear, Dean retrieved his keys from his pocket and drove home.
After that, he seemed to wear it more often.
“If you let it, this is gonna keep messing with you. You gotta to walk past it,” Sam clapped Dean on the shoulder, giving him a purposeful look before walking past him into the bathroom.
“Yes, I think so,” Cas answered, finally locating the remote by his feet. He hit mute; not caring enough about missing anything to hit pause instead.
This was going to be as difficult as Dean had expected. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy you’re back. I’m freaking thrilled. It’s just this whole mysterious resurrection thing, it always has one mother of a downside.”
“Just… stop with the tapping,” Dean pleaded and started to dig through the glove compartment, one hand still on the steering wheel. “How bout some music, huh?”
Dean realised how much easier it was to look at the world when he saw it as a blur.
Castiel shook his head kindly and shushed Dean with a tender kiss. Dean’s once tense jaw instantly relaxed and he kissed back with genuine warmth and appreciation. Dean laced his arms around the angel and encompassed him so completely, holding his warmth close in hopes to reignite his own diminishing sense of life.
Castiel’s phone began to ring as it hit 4am, as per the new routine, and he fumbled around his bedsheets for the remote. When he couldn’t find it, he answered his phone and held it between his shoulder and ear whilst he continued the search.
“Oh boy,” Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair, “Why do you think Fifty Shades of Whatever sold as well as it did though they’re terrible books?”
And then, the hand released him. His head fell back and hit the wall hard and he wretched on his first breath. Cas had lost all feeling in his hands and the sensation threatened to seep into his arms next. He was dying, Cas thought, piece by piece. Just the way they wanted it. He drew his knees up to his chest and coughed into them, spit and blood coating his lips and splattering the filthy denim of his jeans. His head lolled onto his shoulder, smearing the blood onto of his shirt and covering half of his face.
“I’ll proceed with caution then,” Castiel replied earnestly, turning to the next page and slowly eating his chips. “You watch Dr Sexy MD, don’t you, Dean?” He asked after a few minutes.
“That’s not your job,” Dean argued. It was clear that he was frustrated, having told Castiel time and time again that his obligations didn’t include the sacrificial extents he put himself through in an attempt to keep the brothers alive.
Together they heaved Castiel’s broken body into their arms and carried him some ways to lay him down in the back of the car.
Dean truly began to consider the prospect and wondered if it was possible; if he really could do such a thing.
And then they all disappeared from the car and appeared together in the middle of nowhere, illuminated by the bright split between worlds.
But there was something else too. It was like a celestial energy.
“Looks good,” Dean said and tried to wipe his hands dry on his damp jeans.
“You could have slept in my bed if you wanted. Nice clean sheets. And it doesn’t feel like 90 degrees in there either like it does here,” Dean offered, “I wouldn’t have minded.”
When Cas didn’t respond, tilting his head in baffled surprise, Dean sighed in defeat and sifted through the bottom drawer under the sink and held out a small bag of bath salts. Cas took it and peered into the bag, giving the contents a curious sniff. He recognised it as the scent he sometimes found lingering on Dean—the one he always wondered about the origins of.
“I’ve got everything I want right here,” Dean assured him, squeezing Castiel’s side. His leg brushed between Cas’ shins, and then suddenly Dean’s thigh was pressed between his legs against his groin. Cas took in a few steady breaths and tried to subtly angle himself away, but it was hopeless. At least Dean seemed too drunk and tired to notice anything.
And he always took care of Sammy.
“Dean? What are you—” He started.
“What?”
It all sounded terrifying. Perilous. And maybe this feeling—the one he desperately wanted to define—was exactly that. Yet, he
, Cas. The angel had come into his life and there was just no taking him out of it. There was just so much good that couldn’t be undone. Castiel’s constant readiness to bleed for the Winchesters couldn’t be overlooked—could never be tainted.
They both knew that the coffee was lukewarm, if not bordering on cold.
“I think there’s something more to it,” Dean pressed. There was a long, heavy silence. Dean waited, rather impatiently, before he finally pushed for an answer. “Why won’t you talk to Sam?”
“I still don’t understand,” Dean threw his hands up in frustration. “It’s fine. You zap off some place and I’ll go with you.”
Castiel felt heart-wrenched. He felt it all the time.
Yet now Castiel sounded burdened by the notion.
“Meg was fiery?” Cas asked, his brow furrowing.
“Hmm.” Dean knew it was so much more than that. That was an answer he’d already tried on and decided didn’t quite fit right.
“That would be nice, I think,” Castiel replied gratefully. His hand slipped away from Dean’s.
But Castiel had not followed him.
“Dean? What’s going on?” Sam asked, “What did he say? What did you do?”
He hadn’t been able to help but glance at Cas in his rear view mirror, watching as the angel sat quietly with his hands clasped together on his knees. Cas was only this quiet when he thought nobody would notice, and for once Dean saw just how lost he really looked. Cas had stared at his hands, eventually wringing them together in what Dean assumed was misery, but still, Dean didn’t ask questions.
Maybe hope wasn’t as lost as he once thought. He had, after all, successfully kept secrets from Sam and Dean in the past. Whilst not being much good at it, lying still remained a possible option. The only option, in fact.
“I recall—”
“Why?” He mumbled cautiously.  He suddenly wished he hadn’t had so much to drink.
And saying otherwise didn’t change a damn thing.
Cas wanted time to slow down so they could stay there awhile, together as they were before anything had the chance to change.
Cas shook his head. “No.”
Appeased, Dean smiled before walking swiftly down the hall and disappearing around the corner, leaving a stunned Castiel behind in his wake.
“It’s 7:30!”
“Wow, so dramatic,” Dean chuckled and dropped the blankets back down. “Then I’ll have to make it quick. Don’t hog the blankets, ‘cause I’m gonna need them when I come back.”
“Okay,” Dean interjected quietly. He understood. He saw the way Castiel gazed wondrously the world. The way he loved it—so pure and curious and at peace with creation. It was the same way Cas had looked at it. And Dean never would have dared to deny him a place there.
change it. We can try, anyway. You’ve only been human for a few months. It’s still new. With more time and—and, you know, we can talk about it more.” Dean was standing upright now and gesturing between them—the unit that wasn’t meant to break but had truthfully been broken all along. He was trying so hard to ignore the fragments.
And Dean secretly echoed the sentiment.
“Castiel,” Dean cleared his throat and stood behind the empty chair directly across from the angel. His hands grasped the back of it, helping to steady himself as he stared hopelessly at Castiel.
Castiel was silent as he hung his head low. “We will… cross that bridge when and if we come to it.”
Maybe Cas was crazy—and he knew that was always a distinct possibility—but there was no denying the longing he had for it all to be true.
“Crying?”
Before this road trip they hadn’t had much time to simply be in the pleasure of each other’s company. Something just always seemed to get in the way and circumstances often kept them apart, even sometimes for extended periods of time in which Cas often found himself missing the Winchesters. They were his only true friends and without them he sometimes felt lost. He’d longed for a chance for them to be like this where they could just relax and didn’t have to run off into the next sign of danger that came their way.
He stepped inside and left the door ajar, the light of the hallway spilling into the room. Castiel looked at him curiously, aware that this visit didn’t fit the pattern he had apparently grown used to. Dean nodded in acknowledgment and pulled his chair in closer before sitting down. He crossed his arms and cleared his throat.
Castiel listened harder and could distantly hear the bunker door opening and closing a few seconds later. He dipped his head and absently tucked the towel under his arm. Sam turned the corner and paused when he saw him, and he quickly offered a kind smile. But it was dipped in pity.
“Maybe it’s not. But you two can’t keep avoiding each other forever.”
There was a sudden and faint dial tone that Cas didn’t recognise. He frowned, straining to hear if Dean was still on the other line.
“Dean? What’s going on? Are you all right?” Sam asked from his bed. Dean could hear movement as Sam sat up and shifted the blankets to the side.
Castiel was squeezing him so tight; and Dean could actually feel his arms shaking beneath the baggy sleeves of his coat. His fingers were trembling on Dean’s back and the hunter near promised he would stay. He was so close.
you here.”
“Until then? More of the same,” Dean gathered the dishes and set about putting them away in their rightful place. When he couldn’t recall the correct drawer for a kitchen utensil, Castiel wordlessly opened it for him.
“So I’m showing some basic human decency? Sue me,” Dean dismissed him and turned away.
And he had once. Back in the days of Lisa and Ben. But it seemed like nothing more than a distant memory now. A hazy once-been he knew had its fond moments, but ultimately never fully satisfied. It was hard to sit at a dinner table with three settings, forever sensing that one was missing. Each meal together reminded him that his family wasn’t whole. It was incomplete and inescapable.
“Right. Of course he is,” Dean muttered, still swaying from one foot to the other. He caught Castiel staring at him in confusion, and his blush quickly darkened from pink to red. “It’s laundry day,” he explained sheepishly.
Castiel stared into his eyes, sitting still and composed, his resolve unbroken by Dean’s abrupt reaction. And he still didn’t react when Dean grabbed his restrained arms and squeezed tightly.
Dean hesitated. “Angel radio? I thought you couldn’t tap into that anymore?”
“Yeah.” Cas inched closer.
“The angels what? I wouldn’t know, Dean, because you and Sam keep me in the dark.”
Castiel had returned the tapes without being seen. Were Dean to come in now, he could easily claim innocence and say he was simply retrieving the tapes for the first time. With the lie premeditated, Cas thought he may very well present it convincingly. It was a pure answer that would leave very little room for doubt. Dean was sure to dismiss it immediately and carry on without pause. Cas smiled to himself and turned to leave. There, on the floor with the corner just peeking out from under the bed, was the magazine. It was open to a random page, most likely having fallen that way when he had been in the throes of ecstasy. His heart sank to the pit of his stomach. Cas bent down and picked the magazine up and tried to straighten out the bent pages before tucking it back under Dean’s mattress where he had found it.
“To—to take me. I need you to take me, Cas. I want you to fuck me,” Dean told him, his mouth soon sitting agape in a silent moan as the former angel flicked over his nipple with the tip of his tongue.
“Demons,” Castiel clarified.
Dean was everything Cas believed he wasn’t. Dean was the righteous man whose mistakes were never due to a misguided sense of self-worth. Where Castiel had learned how to love, Dean had always felt it, and perhaps that was truly where their differences began. And that’s what made Dean so worthy of forgiveness while Cas could never justly earn it.
Dean looked back to his screen and took another bite of his toast. “Doubt it. It’ll taste like molecules,” he said as he chewed.
“I’m good,” Dean grunted.
“Dean!” Cas barged in through the door to find Dean pinned beneath a woman.
“I didn’t even have to touch you,” Dean said, sounding extremely pleased with himself. He kissed Castiel’s stunned lips. “You better believe I’m gonna make you come like that again.”
Castiel smiled and followed him. “Of course,” he said.
“He understandably thinks very little of us right now,” Cas agreed, melting into the curve of Dean’s body easily, his back and shoulders supported by Dean’s arm.
Dean turned his attention back to the werewolf, offering up a sadistic smile, “You know what, Mutt? ... I believe you.”
“I’m fine,” Dean shrugged him off and walked past him, struggling to walk a straight line.
Dean just stood there, lost. He didn’t know what to do with himself anymore. Sleep had escaped him, no case could keep him preoccupied, and there was nothing he could do to bring Cas back. Benny had said so himself that there was no way to crack open the locked box that was Purgatory, and even if Dean could somehow do it, he knew he’d only be bringing back a corpse; assuming the leviathan left one behind at all.
“I could,” Dean conceded. But there was no commitment to his words. He had no immediate plans to actually do it. And Castiel
“I tried so damn hard to get us the hell out of there.” Dean finally turned away from the window, and fought the urge to look back. He didn’t want to face the disappointment of that empty window.
“Fine. I trust you,” Castiel sighed in defeat.
Eventually the waiting grew to be too much, and Dean’s uncertainty on what he should say shifted into what he knew was probably very misdirected rage. He didn’t know how to say sorry or how to explain himself because he really hadn’t done anything wrong. If he had, then he’d be able to move on with the knowledge (no matter how awful) that it was his fault. At least then he’d have a reason why. But this? No, this was on Castiel.
“Oh, we don’t actually serve PB&Js,” she murmured in apology.
“Five? Maybe earlier?” Dean answered dismissively, apparently occupied with the stereo as he changed sides on the tape. Cas heard the button click over and then felt relief when something quiet and gentle drifted from the speakers.
Now that he’d noticed, the silence turned deafening and he shifted in his seat, tapping his thigh restlessly with his hand until Dean suddenly groaned and let his head droop forward for a few seconds.
Dean slowed down as the neared the glowing light of the open portal. He pulled up to a stop a safe distance away and got out, peering at the burning crack in time and space over the roof of the car. Even from here he could tell it was already closing. By now he recognised the way the light dimmed and the tear thinned at the ends, steadily shrinking in on itself. He knew they didn’t have much time to investigate. If it was apocalypseland, they may not have adequate time to find Mary. But they would be left with no other choice than to free Castiel—knowing the chance might never present itself again.
“Fuck me till I’m screaming
But there was something else he worried about too. He had to wonder if Cas even really wanted to survive this in the first place. After all, the man tended to suffer under his own self-deprecation, and torment himself so completely over any mistakes he made; big or small. He had sacrificed himself in Purgatory for the devastation he had caused in Heaven, and he had wanted to kill himself upon being brought back to Earth, and Dean doubted that his mind had really changed since.
Dean stood again and walked forward with a newfound strength. He stepped right over the ring of holy oil, his demeanour firm in its resolve, and Castiel actually retreated. The angel stepped backward, near stumbling over his own feet, and Dean towered over him—standing straighter with his broad shoulders pushed back, whilst Castiel shrunk in on himself with his shoulders slumping forward.
“He came here with the intention of helping us. If we just gave him a moment, I’m sure he’d try to do that.”
“I don’t feel well, Dean,” he said.
Though Cas couldn’t tell whether it was about him or about what they had done. Worst case scenario included both. And he didn’t know how to fix it this time, especially when Dean was sure not to let him even try.
