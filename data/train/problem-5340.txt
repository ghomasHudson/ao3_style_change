Here, Dean stumbled far more often – but, Castiel had to admit, Dean only stumbled where the movie and play dialogue diverged; overall, he really did seem to know the part and have a decent grasp of how to play the character. Perhaps this wouldn’t be a complete disaster.
Dean turned away as Cas went silent. His little brother was probably spilling his guts (and Dean’s. Mostly Dean’s, in fact) and the little shit was going to pay later.
Dean sighed. “I did kinda spring it on you. I’m not mad.”
Dean hesitated. “Put me down as a maybe for now.”
Cas straightened his shoulders. “If Sam’s doing it, I should too – no need for any of us to hide.”
That’s what was in Dean’s box.
“I hear you,” Dean replied, mortified.
Castiel was surprised at the variety of identities that were slowly revealed in the group of at least a hundred students, probably more. He did notice that the possibly-straight student who had caught his attention at the beginning declined to state his orientation, but soon enough it was his turn, and while he was nervous, he hadn’t come all this way for nothing. “Hi, my name is Castiel, he/him, first year, no major yet and…” He took a deep breath. “I’m asexual.”
“4,” Cas replied.
Oh hell, of course you are.
Once the food was finished – pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon galore – the Winchesters and guests descended on breakfast like the hungry vultures they were. Sam and Dean in particular bickered over the amounts Dean dished out, Sam claiming that Dean was skimping on his portion while Dean just growled for Sam to save some for everyone else.
Eventually Cas coughed, his voice returning to a more normal register and his pupils shrinking back, so Dean zoned back in. Cas – Cas didn’t know what his boundaries were? Did…could that mean that Dean was going to be Cas’ first – anything? The mere idea once again crashed Dean’s brain, and he had to reboot before he could say anything else.
The second she did, Dean whirled to glare at Cas. “Getting Charlie involved is dirty pool, Cas!”
Dean spluttered before turning away, cheeks flushing.
“Thank you,” Castiel breathed before fleeing. The last thing he wanted was any sort of…incident over his identity.
So even once the school year started, Dean would put in hours at the garage for a little extra money or just to work off some steam that wasn’t otherwise being released.
…Okay, maybe, just maybe, Sammy had been onto something.
After dinner, the kids migrated to the family room, sprawling out on the couch and the surrounding chairs. Dean and Gabriel were groaning, stomachs overly full and not happy about it. Cassie had “heartlessly abandoned” his boyfriend (Dean’s words, not Cassie’s) to spend some time with Claire and Kaia, wanting to make sure that they were doing well.
Sam and Cas nodded as Dean let out a sigh. “Yeah, it’s – it’s a little weird, not going to lie, but…” He shrugged. “Better than the alternative.”
Cas hesitated, then grabbed it and yanked, pulling Dean close. Dean couldn’t help chuckling, and Cas glared at him.
Bobby chuckled in the background as Dean let out a groan. “I should have known you’d team up with Sammy against me,” he grumbled.
Cas flinched and Dean turned to glare at her. “We didn’t! Cas isn’t interested in dating anyway, and I wouldn’t pressure him like that,” Dean huffed.
Dean pouted but finally nodded his agreement.
Her chuckle interrupted his train of thought. “Same old Cassie. I’m fine – well, fine for now. I just – I need a place to stay, for a little while.”
Dean flushed. “Ah. Right. Yeah, Castiel, the guy who’s been helping me learn the Link part, since he was the understudy for the other guy.”
Claire shrugged. “You’re welcome.”
He wrinkled his nose. “Not so sure about kissing, especially if any tongue is involved, but I can try closed-mouth kisses to start and see what happens. Honestly Dean, I’m not entirely sure, since I’ve never really tried any of this, it’s hard to know what will be good and what will be bad.”
Dean showed up at four looking unusually surly. “Is everything alright, Dean?” Castiel asked worriedly. “If you’re not feeling well, we’re ahead of schedule, we can take a day off if you need it…”
Cas just buried his face in her shoulder and breathed. His Grandma Irene had always been a kind but distant figure, sending plenty of gifts for all the holidays and calling every so often, but this was the first time he had seen her in person since he was little.
He wasn’t sure where he would be now without Sam and Dean, but it wouldn’t have been nearly as good of a place as he was currently. Now, he had family – *real* family to help him with the only blood relative he truly loved. Like Mary said, they were all family now, and – to quote Bobby – “family don’t end in blood.”
But the words didn’t come to him, and finally Cas interjected quietly. “Lee was your first boyfriend – or, at least, non-girlfriend – and him leaving you behind like that…it must have hurt quite a lot.”
When Cas opened his mouth, Dean’s stomach roiled and he snapped, “Not talking about that, Cas. Period.”
And not just underwear. Colorful, silky, expensive-looking women’s underwear.
“Yeah,” Mary agreed – the pictures didn’t do the light display justice. But she quickly refocused. “You’re welcome to spend as long here as you like – but Dean? No running, stay aware of other people, and *don’t* leave the concourse, alright? I’ll be right here. The concourse on the right goes forward, and the one on the left will bring you back here, okay? But don’t go the wrong way, you might confuse people.”
Sam made a considering noise. “It’s hard to tell. I mean, it’s a definite possibility – he almost certainly knows that we’re talking right now, and he told me some pretty damning stuff, from his perspective. On the other hand, he clearly really likes you, if you’re worthy of martyr mode, so…” Sam trailed off. “Actually. He got really agitated at the idea of you being interested in dating him. That’s – that’s the part that made him hang up on me.”
Cas spoke up softly again. “…And rejection from both of them started to feel like a pattern?”
Which was good, because navigating Claire and Kaia meeting Bobby for the first time was stressful enough.
“Fiiiiiiiiine,” Castiel sighed (not whined, of course not; he may have been tired but he still had his dignity). Dean just grinned and stuck to Castiel like – like – like a sticky thing, nudging him here and there to stop him from tilting too far one way or crashing into any obstacles. Finally, Castiel arrived at his dorm safely and got inside, but he grabbed the door before it could swing shut. “And – and you? Where’s your dorm?”
“Yeah, he’s cool,” Dean admitted, glancing back at Cas again, “but – “
Sam wilted a little in his seat. “I, uh – I found Cas in the bathroom super early in the morning. He – he said he had been talking to his dad.”
Sam hummed thoughtfully. “I think we can at least cut him loose from working backstage, that’ll free up some decent chunks of time. The rest of it though…good luck.”
“Who could that be?” Mary wondered as she went to answer the door. “Uh…can I help you?”
…His mother, though.
Cas flushed and thanked her quietly. Dean had disappeared, so Sam took Cas aside to spend a few more minutes with him sans his annoying older brother.
…And even if the boys didn’t notice how quickly they had become so comfortable with each other, their friends certainly did.
Dean just kept rambling. “I know, I should have just gotten rid of them, but – I don’t know, it was something I liked before he decided to get his assholery all over it, and – one day, I thought, one day I’d regret it, so – ”  He gestured at the box. “Here they are.”
Dean clapped his hands together under his chin and widened his eyes just a little. “Please-please-please-please-please-“
So, together, they waited to hear Dean’s tread on the stairs. Once they did, they both peeked out and beckoned for Dean to join them. “You guys okay?” Dean immediately asked, noticing the worry on their faces.
“Aunt Amelia. Right now, I can promise you, that she’s safe and well taken care of. If I tell you where, and you show up, she won’t trust me, she’ll disappear again – and then, she might not end up somewhere safe.”
“Deal,” Dean agreed, before the two said their goodbyes and hung up.
“Yeah, he did – he messed with the wrong people this time,” came Kaia’s unexpected and determined voice.
Cas was struck dumb.
“Okay. Okay, two teenagers who need a place to stay for a while – any time frame for that?”
Said reasoning took a pretty deep blow after Sammy called him out of the blue.
“No, Lee, I don’t – ” Dean started to protest – before freezing as Lee cozied up behind him.
Claire blinked. “Uh – yeah, yeah, I got into it recently, and I – I like the symbol Ed has on his coat.”
Cas chuckled and went off to spend some time with Sam; he wasn’t sure where Dean had disappeared to, but it would be nice to spend some solo time with his friend.
Cas glanced away, then back at Dean. “You promise?”
Dean looked away. “Not that much,” he muttered.
Charlie smirked. “Yep, someone whose name begins with a D and ends with an -ean. He kept grumbling that having to just sit and watch wasn’t all that much fun, so I gave him a title and a couple responsibilities to fulfill. Speaking of! Did you remember them?”
Cas grumbled at him but kept watching. In the end, the butler was the one sentenced to die in a hole-less trunk (poetic and justified, in Cas’ opinion), O’Malley was adopted into the adorable family…and Madame apparently decided to offer her house up as a home to all the alleycats of Paris. “As strange as that is, it’s probably a good use of her wealth and space, not to mention appeasing her loneliness at the same time,” Cas mused out loud.
Castiel wasn’t sure what he had been expecting Dean to tell him about Lee, but – it wasn’t all of that. His dad dying, Lee compounding that grief with his…*despicable* treatment of Dean and abrupt exit, then Dean figuring out that his identity was still not enough to ensure acceptance from the community or society at large – that it could put a target on his back…
Cas was silent for longer than Dean was expecting, and he almost raised his head to check on his boyfriend when Cas cleared his throat. So Dean immediately met his gaze.
Cas took a deep breath. “Oh, and Zachariah?”
Lee sighed again. “Look Dean, I know it’s hard, I’ve been there, but you have to try and let go of – “
Dean just rubbed a hand through his hair and shrugged, clearly trying to play it off as no big deal. “Yeah, Cas, we’ve been practically dating for – for a while now, and…it’s time to make it official, doncha think?”
“I think I will,” he retorted as he left.
if u tell any1 this ill kill u
And so started their first movie night since their conversation. Cas wasn’t sure what to expect, but The Aristocats certainly wasn’t it.
Dean was happy that Lee was moving on – he could only hope that his new crush worked out, and that Dean’s own crush on Cas wasn’t completely hopeless. As much as Charlie and Benny had reassured him…Dean just wasn’t sure yet. But he’d be finding out soon.
“Of course,” Dean murmured. “Alright, let’s go pick up cousin Adler and head out.”
Bobby shook his head. “Of course that idjit decided to harass a stranger to help Sam – because he did harass you, didn’t he?”
“Oh, the Winchester household,” Cas jumped in to explain. “Dean’s mother, Mary, and his younger brother, Sam, both live there – Sam’s around your age – and Bobby Singer is a friend of Mary’s who lives next door; he’s often around as well. They’re…wonderful,” Cas smiled as he remembered the rollercoaster adventure of his last trip. “Very kind and welcoming people.”
(Dean did. And his bubble tea and getting Cas to laugh over lunch helped soothe the helpless frustration at Cas’ situation – it wasn’t something he could fix, and it didn’t seem like something Cas would even want him to try and fix. Still, it bugged him.)
Cassie buried his face in Dean’s shoulder but otherwise didn’t respond.
Searching for anything else to talk about, Dean’s gaze landed on the Boggle game still out on Sam’s bed. “Oh man, you talked Cas into playing Boggle with you?” Dean groaned.
When the phone started ringing again, Cas grabbed it and ran to the bathroom, locking the door behind him. “Father,” he finally answered curtly.
“Let’s,” Cas agreed, and they entered the museum. They visited all their favorite exhibits, spending the most time looking at the pop art and the Impressionists, but eventually Dean cleared his throat.
He was almost certain she had no idea her older son wasn’t completely straight, and he wasn’t so sure how she’d react to the news that Dean was definitely not. Taking Cas home to his mom as his boyfriend would be…a huge step. One that he couldn’t come back from. And if his mom reacted badly…he was stuck dealing with the fallout all break. Although, he and Cas could always escape to Bobby’s for the remainder of their time off, should everything end badly. Not that it would, but…Dean couldn’t help worrying.
“Hi, you must be new, never seen you around before. I’m Meg. And you are?” She gave him a very thorough once-over, licking her lips. Castiel shuddered a bit, thrusting his hand out to shake. “Hi, I’m Castiel. And I’m asexual, not looking for anything right now,” he blurted out as she took his hand.
Cas’ face immediately fell. “Dean, I didn’t – ”
But first, Dean smirked as the bathroom door opened and Sam flounced out – all offended that his hair routine had been interrupted, the brat – first, he was going to forget about it and enjoy his morning. Bobby was probably starting breakfast by now, maybe Dean could convince him to let him make bacon. Bobby and Cas couldn’t get all the cooking glory.
“No, you’re right, Mom would be happy to, I’m sure,” Dean steamrolled on. “I’m just – your cousin?”
Claire winced. “Yeah, that – that was hard to read.”
Cas glanced at him and stepped slightly forward. “Sam and I…wanted to talk to you. About…something important.”
Bobby sighed. “That would probably be wise. But for now, we might as well get dinner started.”
He didn’t know how long he was sitting there staring at it, but he was interrupted when someone knocked on his door and Bobby’s familiar gruff voice asked if everything was alright.
never thought I’d see the day :P
“I hear you,” Jo grumbled. “I’ll think about it, alright? I’ll think about it.”
Cas pinched the bridge of his nose. “The dating thing was entirely hypothetical anyway,” he groaned, “this is all because of Meg and her stupid question, dammit!” He blew out a frustrated breath. “Is Dean going to pull away now, more than he already has?”
“No, no, it’s not – I’m fine. Really, I am,” he continued hastily when Castiel shot him a look at the unconvincing lie. “I just – it’s not practice, okay? It’s…bigger than that.”
Once he was there, he decided to see if there were any new exhibits; he was in the mood for something new rather than familiar. He didn’t recognize the name of the woman whose art was now on display in the Tower; it wasn’t his usual stomping ground, but he decided it was worth taking a look.
Dean came close enough for Castiel to almost reach the phone in his outstretched hand. “...Are you sure?”
“I’m sure he didn’t,” Cas tried to console, rubbing a hand up and down Dean’s arm. He wasn’t as sure as he was trying to sound, but no point in upsetting Dean. Maybe he could distract him…
Claire nodded. “Yeah, yeah all good. Ready to get some sleep?”
yknow
“Sounds like a plan!” Krissy replied cheerfully as they separated to head their classes.
They tucked back in, Dean enjoying the new flavors and textures of his food. The panko fried chicken and rice had disappeared first, and while Dean had never had sweet potatoes served like this before, they were quickly devoured as well. He was eyeing the cucumbers, debating if they could really be as delicious as everything else he had been eating, when Cas came back with a cup of a light brown liquid…and dark spheres at the bottom?
“Yeah, yeah, Lord’s name in vain, yadda yadda. Out of the way, I’m not here for you,” the voice continued as a familiar face shouldered her way in front of Zachariah.
Cas just nodded back, forcing a smile to his face.
“Yeah, yeah, just tell us!” the boys crowed, eager for the details as Dean just rolled his eyes behind them all, not convinced Lee was actually going to spill.
Castiel blinked at him. “Upset *me*? And withdrawing? Dean, what are you talking about – you’re the one who stopped being able to look me in the eye!”
Dean beamed at her. “I will!” And with that, he stepped onto the concourse on the right, jolting a little as he realized it was moving under him. But it wasn’t long before he was standing on the moving belt and staring up at the lights – staring so much, in fact, that he didn’t realize he was running out of concourse until he came to a sudden halt and stumbled. Luckily he caught himself before he fell and sent a sheepish look back at Mary. “Be careful!” she mouthed, and he nodded. This time he placed himself between the two concourses – glancing to Mary, making sure he could see her and she could see him – and stared upwards at the lights, just absorbing the sight.
When they walked in, Dean was surprised at the cramped and bustling interior – this didn’t seem like a place someone would recommend to Cas, who preferred quiet places.
“…Or else what?” Dean asked.
Donna frowned at him. “Nice try, Dean, but while *some* of us already have most of our roles memorized, *I* am having a little more trouble. Just – practice with Castiel! You’ve been working with him so far.”
“I…I didn’t even know you could serve this much food at once,” Kaia whispered to her.
Sammy going to middle school as a new eighth grader was a little strange, but Sam wasn’t the only new kid transferring into eighth grade, so at least he had the immediate makings of a friend as the two banded together.
Dean chuckled. “No, no, Bobby’s a good friend of my mom’s – he’s basically my uncle. He lives just down the street, but he’s over a lot because he gets lonely puttering around in his house by himself. Not that you heard that from me,” Dean finished quickly.
…Actually getting something in town to celebrate would probably be a good start.
Cas nods solemnly. “I promise.”
Cas zoned out a little, missing the rest of Charlie’s speech as his father’s past ranting on the evils of the Satan-worshipping game rang in his ears. He pushed it away, not wanting to judge his new friends based on their interest in something that neither his father nor he had ever even experienced; and here was his chance.
“Oh, shush, you have no idea how to celebrate Christmas, not like these fine folks! Look at this gorgeous tree – nothing like the smell of one of these – and oh goodness, I’ve interrupted the cleaning up! Here, let me help you with that,” she bustled off with the pile of paper and tape next to Dean.
He definitely remembered when they pulled up to park, white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel and hysterically wondering if he should just turn back now, tell everyone he got sick or something – but feeling Cas’ hand squeeze his shoulder reminded Dean that this wasn’t just for him. This was also for Cas, who didn’t deserve to be a secret, who didn’t need another reason to feel any shame about who he was; and that’s what really snapped Dean out of it. He could do this. For Cas.
Dean grinned back. “What else are boyfriends for?”
Immediately he ripped his eyes away from the box and focused on Dean’s worried face.
Dean flinched back. “No way, dude.”
“Oh my god, Krissy, seriously? You were as lesbian as the rest of us before break – what happened? Decided you wanted to stand out from the crowd?”
“Seems a little thin, but alright,” Cas shrugged.
And Cas was off, telling Dean all these cool things he knew about the artist and the time period and the meaning behind some of the paintings…
He was thinking about it as they watched The Aristocats, Cas predictably enchanted with it. Dean had to admit he probably spent more time watching Cas than the movie itself, but…he *had* seen the movie a million times, since it was one of Sam’s favorites growing up. He knew the whole thing backwards and forwards, but through Cas’ eyes, he could almost be watching a whole new movie.
Zachariah pursed his lips. “And who do you think has been paying for your schooling? The clothes on your back – ”
“Hmmm. Concourse sounds good to me,” Cas finally replied, tugging Dean towards the stairs.
Lee sighed. “You sure do like to make it hard on yourself, doncha?”
“Did you know that Jesus was actually born in the spring?” Cas responded distantly. “His birthday was conflated with the pagan holiday of Yule to popularize Christianity.”
“What??” Dean and Cassie chorused, Dean whipping around to stare as Cassie’s eyes widened.
“Dean, stop whatever else you’re doing. This is important.”
Dean closed his eyes. He couldn’t respond, because the only answer he had was the one Cas didn’t want to hear.
Claire sighed. “You know my cousin Castiel, I’m sure?”
Cas rubbed a comforting hand over his back for a minute before standing up. “Let’s go; I know what will make you feel better.”
Mary rolled her eyes. “One print. I am only paying for ONE print, Dean, so choose wisely. We can always come back, the paintings aren’t going anywhere for a while.”
Sam came and threw an arm around her shoulders. “I’m glad that they called, and you should probably talk to them soon, but today? Today it’s Christmas, and we deserve to celebrate, not stress!”
“Dean. You’re my big brother. You’re not the only one who can tell when their brother likes someone. Well – I did need a little help, but it’s pretty obvious now. That’s why you’re backing off and hiding it behind the dating excuse; you’re trying to pull away before Cas breaks your heart like Lee did.”
Once the happy ending was settled and the credits started to roll, Dean knew it was now or never. D&D was meeting tomorrow – if he wanted Cas there, he had to say something tonight or he’d have to wait until the next session.
As she lathered up her hair, her mind wandered back to the chain of events that had gotten her here…
Mary sighed. “I understand if you’re not ready to tell me yet, but if or when you are…I’m here.” She gave a warm smile and walked back down the hall. “It looks like you girls are just fine, so I’m off to bed. Sleep well,” she called as she entered what must have been her bedroom.
Rather than confront Dean directly, Bobby put him to work in his garage. Dean had always loved cars and had always had a basic knowledge of how to keep them running, so working in the garage was – well. Cathartic. To get his hands dirty, to feel and see his efforts making a difference in each car that got to drive off the lot after he worked on it, to lose himself in gears and oil and tools for hours at a time; it helped him immensely. Soon Dean had worked off enough of his anxiety and guilt that he could start talking to Sam and his mom like he needed to, not to mention start thinking about a possible career path to do with cars instead of guns.
“Hmm,” is all Bobby offered in response. “And how long-term is this going to be?”
“Castiel is…special,” the older woman sighed. “I’m his grandmother – Irene Adler, how do you do,” she interrupted herself, offering a hand to shake. Mary shook the offered hand, grinning. “Now where was I – oh yes, Castiel. His grandfather passed recently – yes, tragic, if only he was a better man to have earned sadness at his passing – and so Castiel and the rest of his family have come to check in on me.” Irene bit her lip. “But Castiel…he’s become such a quiet, somber child. He was such a ray of sunshine the last time he visited, but now…” She shook her head. “Taking him this museum has been the only thing I’ve seen spark any sort of real emotion from him – well, that and your son.”
After an unknown amount of word vomit, Dean just buried his face in his hands. “Please say something and put me out of my misery,” he moaned.
Cassie smiled. “Sam’s harmless; the worst he’ll do is pepper you with too many questions. Which, if he does, just set Mary or Dean on him,” Cassie confided. “As for Bobby…his bark is a hell of a lot worse than his bite. He’s gruff at first, but I think he’ll warm up to you two quickly. He probably won’t come over until tomorrow, though, you won’t have to worry about him for a while,” Cassie continued quickly as Kaia visibly grew more nervous.
Dean just blinked at him. “No?”
“And so you know where Claire is?”
Which is exactly what happened. But magically, Jody had brought a container for the pie Donna couldn’t eat – and that’s when it clicked for Claire. This was more than just being friends. And the realization that she wasn’t alone at this table in loving the woman sitting next to her ignited a warmth in her chest that no previous Thanksgiving came even close to.
“I’ll tell you if anything changes with Claire, but for now, just – let the school know whatever they need to let the transfer happen. And I wouldn’t recommend calling again,” Cas gritted out before hanging up. He took a couple deep breaths, trying to remember that despite their religion-fueled prejudices his aunt and uncle were generally decent people; they would come to their senses sooner or later…probably.
“That’s awesome!” Kaia smiled. “You’ll have to introduce me next time.”
“You…wore these? For Lee?” Cas asked.
Castiel glared at him blearily, the adrenaline rush from Dean showing up and scaring him fading. “You’re my stalker, should I really be showing you where I live?”
Dean dropped the paintbrush he had been holding and swiveled to look behind him, where his annoying little brother’s voice had come from. “Sure I wouldn’t mind doing *what,* Sammy?”
Bobby smiled. “Well, thank you for trusting me with this, Sam. You’re still my boy.” And with that he held his arms wide open and Sam ran into them, hugging Bobby within an inch of his life.
But after Thanksgiving break, Lee started pulling away from Dean, bit by bit. Dean tried to tell himself that he was imagining things, but it came to a head after only a week, Lee telling him to sit down one night, that they had to talk.
In any case, Cas was a very welcome house guest. It was rare for Sam and Dean to agree on friends – Dean’s friend from his senior year, the one he apparently spent most of his time with, was someone Sam *hated* – so Mary and Bobby were very pleasantly surprised to see all three boys getting along so well.
“Oh,” Sam whispered across from her.
“…No seriously, I definitely remember you saying something along those lines.”
“You’re keeping an eye on her?”
Claire stared down at her phone. “They just called me. Wanted to know how I was doing, and…they wanted to apologize.”
“Okay,” Castiel responded slowly, “and what did Donna say?”
Bobby snorted. “No one kisses their friends like that.”
“Because?” Cas asked, sounding a little closer.
“And, if there’s any problems – ” Cassie led Claire out the guest room door and pointed down the hall. “Dean and I will be in that room over there. You can absolutely come get me if you need me.”
Castiel sighed. “Dean, there are many kinds of attraction – aesthetic attraction, thinking that other men are attractive, does not by itself make you gay. Wanting to date or have sex with other men does indicate that you might have romantic or sexual attraction towards men - but at the end of the day, whether or not the label fits you doesn’t matter; how you choose to define yourself is. If you think you’re gay, then you are; if you don’t, you’re not. Okay?”
Regina spluttered a bit, looking around the room for support, but everyone, even the friends she had seemed so close with before, avoided her eyes.
“So you think me a fool, niece?” Zachariah replied softly. “Very well. I’ll play along. Enjoy your shopping *date* plans, but remember – I’ll be watching.” And with that, he strode off, whistling.
Dean shrugged it off, figuring that Lee just wasn’t quite as heteroflexible as he had been recently discovering he was; no big deal. And at school, Lee acted like nothing had happened, so Dean just followed his lead. Then Lee led him behind the bleachers after classes. Dean turned, expecting some sort of heart-to-heart or no-homo talk, but instead Lee just started kissing him again.
“That you girls are welcome to stay as long as you want, no strings attached. You’re family now, and that’s what family does, helps out when you need them to,” Mary stated firmly.
Bobby stayed silent.
“That’s – yeah, that’s good to know, thanks,” Dean replied, blush somehow intensifying. He knew he would never again walk into this store, especially not to return underwear that was supposedly for his girlfriend. So he just grabbed the second-largest size they had in the pink silk, figuring that was probably close enough, and checked out as fast as possible before booking it out of the mall.
But Arcimboldo’s paintings were not the kind you rushed looking at, as Dean found out. In fact, when Cas was done with reading over the all the plaques, he found Dean still standing in the first room of paintings, still staring. “These are so freaking amazing,” Dean breathed. “You look at them one way, and they look like one thing. But you look at them differently, and there’s a whole other way to see them.”
“I know, and I feel bad, but – it would be un-Christian to leave Claire alone, on her first Christmas without her family, and – and perhaps I would be able to convince her to see the light, renounce her sins and come home!” Cas lied.
Not that Dean seemed to notice as he frowned. “Who the hell has been stalking you?”
“Castiel. The Angel of Thursday,” he explained with a sigh at her blank stare.
Cas turned and lit up like the sun. “Dean! Congratulations, you were fantastic!”
And despite all of that, Dean was…not only still standing, but – well, thriving. Part of a large social circle, pursuing his dreams, doing well in school, taking care of his brother…taking Cas under his wing, too. How did such a good and kind person go through so much and…still, despite it all, take care of so many others?
The entire time they were dancing, Castiel desperately tried to forget that Dean had, for all intents and purposes, admitted that he was potentially interested in dating men.
“Yep-love-you-bye,” drifted back at Bobby, who chuckled. He didn’t know who that boy thought he was fooling – he was obvious when he was panting after Lee, even before Bobby had seen them making out in his garage. Now, Dean was showing similar signs with Cas, but for some reason, he seemed more reluctant to accept his feelings this time around. Maybe Sam would have some insight...
From: New Pain in My Ass
And indeed, by the time the president called the meeting to order, Dean had to admit he was glad he had come. He had met some of Charlie’s other friends and even been invited to join their next D&D campaign. He had never played before, but if Charlie had gotten so excited about it, he had to at least see what all the fuss was about.
After Zachariah stormed off, the festive atmosphere slowly returned, even if Cas could feel everyone sneaking glances at him, trying to see if he was really okay as he said he was – but, surprisingly, he really did feel fine. Not even just fine – he finally felt free. His parents were finally out of his life, and his grandmother was making sure that little fact wouldn’t mean having to drop out of school; it didn’t get much better than that, right?
So of course, Lee smirked as he made eye contact with Dean. “Her name’s Dee, or at least that’s what she told me to call her,” Lee started to drawl. “She’s got gorgeous green eyes, greener than I’ve ever seen – and the softest lips, blows my mind every time I get to kiss them. And don’t get me started on that ass, finer than a Georgia peach and twice as sweet – ”
Eventually, of course, it will be Castiel Winchester ;)
Zachariah reared back, face ugly with rage. “How *dare* you – ”
He was fingering a pair of pink, silk panties when a saleswoman walked up to him. “Getting a pair for your girlfriend?” she asked, smiling kindly at the heated flush that immediately spread over Dean’s face. But he nodded. “Great! Do you know her size?”
Dean flushed even darker and rubbed a hand through his hair. “I’m not – this isn’t about – you’re cute but – argh!”
Dean, though – Dean was the only new incoming senior at the high school, so the administration thought a fellow student showing him around would be helpful. For some reason, they chose Lee Webb – captain of the hockey team and a troublemaker (even if his smile was usually enough to get him out of anything he landed in).
…But Dean was not one to introduce a significant other to family lightly; Mary had only known about all the girls through the town’s grapevine, not from Dean himself. If Dean was going through all the effort of introducing Cas as his boyfriend to the family, this was a serious relationship, not an experiment or a fling.
Since now Dean (who kind of moved in with Sam and Jess) and Sam where out for probably some days, Jess told Sam and Dean that she would visit a cousin who just moved to Lebanon.
"Well shit" was the first thing she said. "Do you think he also came back here?"
"Only if you tell me about what you have been up to."
His breath stopped. That wasn't a book about theology. The book was rather old and listed supernatural creatures some could find in the US. He grabbed the other book. It was a book about supernatural creatures around the world. He saw headlines like, Okami, Pagan gods and Minotaur. He laid both books down on the table in front of him. He didn't know what to make out of this.
Dean and Cas exchanged a look "Jess..." Cas started but was interrupted "I will tell you - but only after we got her, okay?" They both nodded.
The rest of the ride was in silence.
Cas nodded "If it were our past Jess would have died because she is not supposed to be in the timeline. Maybe it wouldn't be a demon but a car crash. As long as she's out of the timeline the universe is good with it."
Jess nodded eagerly "Sound good, and Nebraska isn't that far away. I talked to Sam earlier, they are going to be home tomorrow night. SO if we start driving now we can be there in four hours? We can burn the remains and then I catch a flight back home. How does that sounds? "
Cas put the necklace on Dean and he felt his insides getting comfortably warm for a few seconds before he cooled down a bit. He gave Cas a grin and Cas leaned in for a kiss. Dean broke it "is it just me or is this way more intense than normal?" he asked suspicious his boyfriend just smiled "could be the connection between my grace and your soul."
Jess opened the bag and gasped "is this?" she asked.
Jess told them that Brady had woken up but won't talk. He has some wounds on the inside but nothing life-treating. They only thing the doctors couldn't explain was how so much sulfur got into his system.
"You guys won't believe what Clara just told me! Guys...?" She looked from Sam to Dean back to Sam and to the books in his hands then she let out a sight, "took you both long enough."
Dean smiled "wonderful - there is now a devilstrap under the doormat and under the bed" Jess nods and put the paint down then she looked around.
Well into the second week Jess called and told them Sam and Dean got a call from a friend of their Dad who asked for their help about something with a plane.
"What the..."
She shrugged "My boyfriend just got kind of kidnapped by his brother and I was nervous about that but then I was even more nervous about the men who was walking the street in front of the building what kind of distract me but then he came in and stood in front in my door. That was kind of scary but you kind of look like younger you so yeah. Then The candle didn't flicker when you said you aren't planning on harming me so that was good. And after you told me everything...it kind of calms me that we have a plan and I'm pretty sure everything will work out. So yeah..." Jess shrugged again.
They discussed something, he wasn't near enough to hear anything but small parts.
As soon as Dean had his arms wrapped around him he spun around "Dean" he said.
"Okay that is going to sound crazy, but my name is Dean Winchester. Yes, like Sams brother.
"Dean?" she asks hesitantly a smile spreading on her face "did you cook?"
While Dean was cleaning up the air-mattress he slept on (he moved in with them, more or less, Jess didn't seem to mind and Sam was happy to spent some time with his brother) Sam decided to take a closer look at one of the books.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smiled and took Cas' hand and walked to the kitchen.
Dean shrugged "Sounds like a plan - except for the fact that wo won't burn the remains."
He never thought that he would stand on a chair and paint a devilstrap at ceiling while his brothers dead girlfriend would stand next to him with a class of whiskey in her hand, telling embarrassing  stories about Sam.
"I don't know, maybe we forgot some stuff over time," Cas gave im a look "maybe
"He is breathing" she said, "and he didn't react to the holy water."
He shook his head he couldn't do that. Let history repeat it self and letting innocent and people he loved die. No. He had to do something - just where should he start? His eyes darted to the window of the apartment he just came out of.
On the way Dean made some calls - giving some hunters anonymous tips about a ghost in a lake, as soon as they asked about his sources he hung up but he was pretty sure they would take the bait.
It didn't came to a fight. The Wendigo gave a pained sound and got up in fire.
After checking in a motel he filled his bag with the essentials, flare guns and flame-thrower as well as some food and a flashlight.
"Hey Jess - happy to see me?"
He swallows hard, and he ist pretty sure something just flew into his eyes because he blinks raptly to get it not, not to get rid of tears...no. "Okay"
"Jess you really don't have to..."
Not an easy task as it turns out when he heard the steps of something big and ugly. Dean shoved the boys away from him in a small hiding space, it wouldn't do much but maybe it would help them.
"And you did good, the first time I exorcised a demon, he flung me around the room."
"You are not exactly subtle you know?"
She looked at him with big eyes "But what about Cas? Wont he need one?"
She laughed a bit but kept her eyes on the road "you have grown" she interrupted the silence.
"Sam?" he guessed and she nodded. "Seems like the two checked into a motel and both of you are okay"
"Are you alright?" Cas asked taking a step forwards as well.
Cas' head snapped up looking first at Dean then at Jess, a smile formed on his lips as he stood up.
And after that he would try to find Cas.
"I am...but my grandfather from my fathers side was a men of letters. We meed him in the future because of time travel but this is an other story - how are you connected to them?"
Stepping into the bunker he was greeted with the musty smell from all the dust that found a home on the shelves. It was a bitch to clean the bunker the first time around and this time he would have to do it alone.
past. You changed quite a lot and that would have consequences but nothing happened, did it?"
Jess sights again and sits next to Dean, Sam is still standing at the shelf "Okay lets get that down...first you" she looks at Dean "turn up here saying that your Dad is missing and that he was on a hunting trip, doesn't ring much of a bell for someone who doesn't know about your kind of hunting. Then you come back and your clothes are dirty and in Sams case bloody, not to talk about the wounds on his chest." Jess gives Sam a pointed look "you didn't really thought I wouldn't realise?" He swallows but says nothing. "That
He nodded swallowing again "can we do that inside? I swear I'm not planning on harming you"
Gathering himself he righted his shirt. As much as it hurts he had to take care of Jessica before he could search for Cas.
"Okay next thing" he picked up the ring "this ring is made out of iron and has an anti-possession sigil engraved - so if a ghost comes near you, you can punch him, not the best way but it brings a bit of savoy if you don't find iron near you. I don't think I have to explain the anti-possession thing?" she nodded while she took the ring away from him and slid it on her middle finger - it fits perfectly.
While he waits for Cas to come he cleans Jess her face as good as he can while still holding her.
she is angry.
handprint. It was back, it never really got away - there was alway a light scar tissue but now it looked like when he just got out of hell.
A crash brings him out of his thoughts and he realised they started to trash the mirrors. After destroying his first mirror he takes a look at Jess and his breath stops, blood is running out of her eyes, he knew it would happen but seeing it happening and knowing it would, are two a complete different things.
Dean huffs a laugh "you haven't even taste it yet"
"Yeah...Vampire hunt - got impaled by a nail" he looked away sheepishly.
Together they figured out that the demon who killed her was in the meat suit of Tyson Brady, a guy Jess never really liked but talked to because Sam and he were good friends.
A sob escaped his mouth - did that mean...?
Dean let out the air he had held in and smiled just as small as Cas "yeah?"
died.
I will give a short explanation in the notes at the end and I put a * at the beginning and end of the part so you can skip it
A Christmas Chapter in August, I mean why not? It's fluffy.
Now he was complete confused "No I'm pretty sure we are in the past I mean look at the date and stuff..."
"Come one lets search for your cousin" he winked at her and she giggled.
"Jess I'm sorry, I wanted to protect you and not to get you dragged into this whole mess...you must have been so confused..." Sam started but was quickly interrupted by his brother.
His head was empty, he had played out what he wanted to say in his head in the last ten minutes but now it was all forgotten.
Billie following Cas and Dean, trying to kill them.
With an other hug he said good-bye to Jess and got on the train. His eye focused on the ticked in his hand.
They leave the town and the sirens get quieter.
They decided to wait till it was dark to break into the shop. While they waited Cas went out to get some food for them and Dean gave Jess a present.
After a last check they were given the green light that they could go.
So why was he in an apartment right now? Was this hunt a dream? He does not think so but even if the apartment doesn't make sense.
The bunker was filled with boards full of strings, pictures and notes about cases Dean and Cas could remember, their connection and how to solve them.
Jess actually left him with more than a hug, she gave him some money (
And now he kissed an angel on a daily basis.
know?"
"From the looks of it I suspect that Dean has given you your present?" a voice comes from the door and Dean smiles to himself as he sees Cas standing there, the food on the small table while he got out of the trench coat.
He closed the door and runs down the stairs.
He picked the first one up "Cas and I did some digging and found two of these - I kept one and this is for you. It's a demon killing knife. You can kill lower demons - so no yellow or white eyed demons with it, and no knights of hell but the one left won't be a problem until later."
He swallowed hard and unlocked the door he didn't have time to dwell in the memories, he had a Wendigo to hunt.
"You should be home a few hours before Sam and Dean are." Dean ends his short explanation.
The older one nodded "That would be nice."
I'm a beta reader for a wonderful Harry Potter - Drarry, Time Travel Story so maybe check it out if you are interested! It's
She was interrupted by Dean "Yeah I know about the men of letters, heck I live in one of their bunkers, but how do
"I mean I only meet you once but...you seem calmer? to me. More grounded but also sadder, it looks like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders"
Dean huffed a laugh "its okay Jess, we talked - well about that emotion stuff. I didn't tell him what happened - thinking about it could you stay in line? We could tell him together and you can tell me if there are news about Brady"
He hurries. Next to him Cas is smashing mirrors as well and Jess is doing her best but with the blood in her eye its hard to see. Still it is her who smashes the right mirror. Mary crawls out, in Jess' direction, Jess who is kneeling on the ground, face smeared blood. Cas is standing in front of her, angel blade in one hand and a mirror in the other.
"Dude, did you listened to anything she just said? She already knew about hunting before I came here...that opens the question why didn't you tell Sam you are a hunter? Mhm? Why did you wait for him to say something?" Dean gave Jess an accusing look.
how naivë they were.
Dean swallowed "Im going to answer hat and then I will explain."
Sam nodded.
, my ass. He always had it and Dean should have told him, should him let it know.
She rolls her eyes "yeah but it looks delicious and smells even better - and since you died because of a rusty nail and not because of food poisoning I guess you can eat it"
" he paused "That could explain things..."
He had to work fast and silent, problem was that the victims weren't really able to walk on their own that meant getting all of them out as soon as possible while have an eye out for the thing.
"I know but I don't think this is
"Uhm" Dean mumbled "there is something else..."  Cas leaned his head to the side, asking a silent question.
*Jess shoves a guy who touched her against her will into the pool, he cant swim and drowns. Jess told a lie that she left the party before the guy fell into the water. Everyone believes it was an accident and that he fell because he was drunk.
"That is at least partly true, when Sam was six months a demon came in our house..." then he started talking about the blood, Azael, the basics about their life and about her death. Both ignored his slip that
"Okay, I know you know about the life and stuff but how comes that you are so calm?"
"Dean stop," she interrupted him"it was a good decision."
"How long?"
Jess positions herself in front of a mirror, Dean isn't one hundred percent sure which of the mirrors is Marys so they will smash as many as possible till she crawls out of one, the already positioned the old ones in front of them so their chances were higher to get the right one early on.
"Maybe the same thing happened to him as well."
"So tell us about your first hunt," he said while handing both of them a beer.
Okay first things first, he had to get out of here. As quiet as possible he stood up and tried to make it to the door. Then he heard rumbling.
Finding the mine wasn't that hard as well, turns out you are able to remember more things than you thought. But now came the hard part - freeing the victims and killing the monster.
Two hours later they sat in the car on their way to Nebraska. They changed funny stories and Dean and Cas gave Jess some hunting tips. About an hour away from their destination (Dean was pretty sure they were heading the right way) the who would call Mary came up. Dean and Cas discussed if they had a secret the other didn't know about causing a death but came up with nothing. They had spend the last days telling each other so many things, things they felt guilty about, secrets and wishes. Cas said they could try to use one of the victims as a bait but he didn't like the idea, neither did Dean or Jess.
He swallowed "I don't know" he mumbled, "I know I didn't plan it actively but I didn't really do anything to prevent it" his voice got quite the more he talked. "And" he trailed of "I think you understood something wrong..."
Together they got out of the car, Jessica running in the hospital to get a nurse and he got Brady out. It didn't take long till some nurses came and took him away.
had each other. Dean hoped he would never have to feel the lost of Cas again, he wasn't sure if he could take it.
Dean nodded till he realised Jess couldn't see him "Okay good. Listen Jess I have a situation here, can I call you back?"
"Hey Jess"
"Sunday I think...it was day."
Joy that he could spent some time with his brother who he missed dearly in the last year.Guild for dragging him with him.
Mom walking around and laughing with them.
She looked him up and down before she stepped inside. That didn't sit right with him...why would she let a stranger in? Yeah it was 2005 but still. He shook his head, he could ask her later, now he had to convince her that he was from the outer and was trying to safe her. Should be easy... right?
He chuckled "I won't. Whats going on with Sam and Dean?" Cas gave him a questioning look, he made a gesture with his hands to tell him he would tell him later.
After (hopefully) killing the Wendigo he would stop at a bar and make some money. He had to get himself a credit cart - well not himself per se. Afterwards he had to get some clothes, food and fake badges. Fun.
She huffed "true words, come on"
He sighted "I think I have to start at the beginning, but you have to understand I'm going to tell you the most Important things but I can't tell you everything - not now at least. It could be dangerous if get captured or something" he looked her straight in the eyes.
"I thought we put the candle out" he joked.
"Oh because I'm no hunter," was all she had to say.
"There was this one party down the street when I was 17, they had a pool. Everyone was in the house partying. I don't know why I went outside - maybe to catch some fresh air. And then this guy, Florian Darren was his name, followed me outside. I didn't thought about it too much, I had seem him around school and I never heard anything bad about him, I thought maybe he went out for a smoke or something I don't know. He walked up to me, I could smell the alcohol on him, but we were at a party so...nothing out of the ordinary. We talked for a bit and it was really nice till he started to touch me - first it was on the arms and stuff and I thought to my self - a little flirting is okay, just a bit of fun. But then he started to touch my side, my breasts, with one hand he lifted my shirt and tried to put his hand in my trousers. I told him to sop but he wouldn't, he grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I shoved him and he felled in the pool, he panicked but I couldn't bring myself to do anything to help him. I just wanted to get away from this place, so I ran home. My parents weren't home and I got in my bed. Half an hour later a friend of mine called at home and asked me were I was - I told her I didn't feel well and left an hour ago and that I'm sorry I didn't told anyone. She accepted the lie and told me to get better. One hour later I could hear the sirens. They found Florian drowned in the pool. I was questioned the next day - like everyone who was at the party and they believed me that I left earlier, no-one had seen me left for the garden so they assumed the story I told my friend was true. In the end the police said he probably fell in the pool due to the alcohol and it came out that he couldn't swim, so one thing lead to another."
He looked at Cas, he gave a nod and gave his hand a squeeze. Dean hadn't let go of his hand since the beginning of the call.
Before he can say anything else he is tackled by the young woman "thank you Dean. Thank you so much!" she whispers in his ear and he hugs her back "no problem - you are family."
. So now can I open my present...and after that we can investigate the bond" and this asshole winked, fucking winked at him.
Dean and Sam exchange a look.
"Bobby do you know who took the case in Blackwater ridge?" Dean spoke into his phone, Sam next to him.
He silently went back to the drivers side and started the car again.
"Hey Brady" he hears Jessicas voice and looks up "do you want to come over? Sam went on a weekend trip with his brother and I'm kind of bored... yeah that suits me... see you then, bye!"
Cas nodded but stayed next to Dean, who sat down on the bed.
And after that Dean updated Cas on what happened after the empty took him.
Opening the bedroom door was even harder than opening the front door, he thought about all the things he got over the years, the things that made this
"What?" He asked confused.
They were interrupted by a ringing. They broke away and Dean reached in his pocket pulling his phone out. Jess was calling. Cas looked at him and than at his phone.
Fear for his father and that his brother would change his mind and wouldn't come out.
"What happened?" she asks carefully.
"If you want to we can take you on a hunt, nothing big but just so you learn how to react when something is going south ." he shrugged and looked at Cas, he seemed okay with the idea. So did Jess.
This stupid, idiotic son of a bitch.
A choking sound came out of Deans throat.
Cas tilted his head "What?"
"Hey angel" Dean mumbled looking at the tree "how did you managed to sneak all of that in the bunker without me noticing?" he asked.
They decided that she would do the work and Dean would stay hidden. Him being here was an ace up the sleeve and they couldn't risk the demons would find out, because they couldn't kill the demon and when Dean would be in sight he would know she had help and tell others. This way, they hoped, Brady would think Sam told her about hunting and stuff.
"Wait, what?"
Then the Wendigo came. Dean pointed the gun but was distracted by the awaking of one of the guys - wonderful, just wonderful.
"Okay then - let's call her."
Maybe, what if, could it be? He didn't want to get his hope up...but what if?
Dean smiled and shook his head "Cas has his angel blade - it's kind of an allrounder so it is fine. We are trying to get more angel blades but they are very hard to get so we have to be happy with those" he tapped the knife.
Sam always told him he should be open about his feelings. Easy to say but hard to do, especially when John Winchester raised you with his 'shoot first, ask later' attitude. It took him some time to realize how John fucked him up, if it wasn't for Bobby, Sam and later Cas... he doesn't want to think about it.
"Okay then we can both sleep some before I'm going to drive you to the train station."
They made the plan to paint a devilstrap at the ceiling and Jess would call him later asking if he would like to come over, without the demon knife or an angel blade they would have to exorcise him - that opened the question if the meat suit would be still alive or not. If yes they would bring him to a hospital if not they would have to burry him. Jessica was surprising relaxed while discussing this.
"Are you sure?" He asked Jess the tenth time in the span of half an hour, she just nods and grids her teeth together.
Or tries to. Because as soon as Jess sees him, is he victim of her hug as well.
" He took a deep breath and looked at he.
"I'm sorry" is the first thing he says after Jess wakes up completely. They are on an empty street. Cas is sitting next to Jess, while Dean is driving. They decided, that Cas would heal and clean Jess - it wouldn't take much mojo and hopefully heaven wouldn't think about it.
She nodded and left the room.
"Jack may have said he won't interfere but he ist
"Cas?" he asked into the night but no answer.
As soon as they heard the news about what happened in Blackwater ridge they went out. It was there were their Dad wanted them - so maybe it was their Dad.
"Cas?" he whispered taking a step forwards.
"What do you mean? Of course they are, that's why Jess' cousin sent them." Dean was confused but walked up to him.
Jessica leaned back in her chair and hid her face in her hands. Then she took a deep breath and looked from Dean to Cas and back. "Anything else I should know?"
"I can do it" Jess said, looking down.
While their little trip wasn't successful they still managed to put some ghosts to rest and spent some time together. After two weeks just driving around they went to Oklahoma to prevent the build of oasis plains as soon as possible. As soon as Dean told Cas about the bugs and the bees he was behind the steering wheel of the Pick-up they found in the back of the garage with the words "we have to save the bees Dean" he should have known. All he did was shaking his head slightly with a smile on his face, Cas the big bad angel wanted to save the bees... of course.
The rest of the drive was silent. When they arrived at the airport she was asleep and Cas had to wake her up.
Together they managed to get the victims out of the mine pretty easily but the problem how they could get them out of the woods.
. They had sent Jess two books she might be interested in with fake covers so it would look like they were some theology books. In return they had gotten Christmas cookies and a key to the apartment with a letter that stated that if she had a key to the bunker they should have a key to her home as well.
She laughed, but then she sobered up "Dean?"
"I don't believe you"
Jess nodded and got her car keys. After checking that no-one is watching they loaded him on the backseat.
Damnit! He was 41 and she was around twenty, he faced hell and dangerous monsters - he shouldn't be afraid of her!
"Jess! Calm down! I'm fine. Th people in the hospital are the ones who were attacked but they should survive."
Cas lashed into an explanation how he was an angel but not a very good one. After he finished Jess only said "okay"
It was night, around two if he had to guess. Looking around he could make out the basics and something tingelt in the back of his head. He got the feeling he knows this place but he couldn't figure out why.
"So it was Bloody Mary."
, two weeks ago in Illinois. He wanted to go to the bunker but wasn't sure if he could get in because of the angel warding and he didn't had his key on him. He remembered where the now Dean was from Deans stories and memories so he searched for him. When he managed to get to Palo Alto Dean and Sam already finished the hunt and were on their way back - so he went to Black Water ridge with only the clothes on his back and hope, halfway there his stolen car gave up and he had to find an other way to get there, turns out he decided walking was a good idea. He spent his last money on food and a silver knife because his angel blade could be suspicious.
"Hey Sam" she says surprisingly happy "yeah I'm fine, I'm on my way home right now...what about you?...mhhh okay...listend I'm sorry my phone is nearly dead, I will call you when I'm home okay?...Yeah love you too, bye! And say Dean I said hello!"
They both nodded.
Her cousin (Cas) was an expert in theology and would help her to get some extra credit - Dean didn't understand why a law student would need knowledge about theology but okay... the other Sam and Dean seemed to buy it.
Jack in the kitchen eating cereal.
Dean watched as Sam went up to the apartment to gather some things, and he watched how his younger self slumped against the Impala. He knew exactly what went trough his head right now.
"Okay?!" he nearly shrieked "What. How...Why?" he had meet hunters that wouldn't believe the stuff he just told.
Swallowing he raised his hand again when the door opened. Hand still raised to knock he blinked at a very alive Jessica Moore who had her arms crossed in front of her chest.
"Ah!" she interrupts him "I won't accept no, you saved my life and you are going to do so much good for the world, let me do this"
"Two weeks after you...you know."
The hunter took the ring and reached for Cas' left hand "Yes."
"Something from me and Cas, we put it together when you called and asked if you could come to the bunker - look in it" he gave an (hopefully) encouraging  smile while he fiddled with his fingers.
"Hello, Dean"
How times change.
He stares at her "Train station?"
"...in an alternate Universe. Were the timeline is at 2005 right now..."
Together the three of them stood on the middle of the shop, Jess between the two men.
that wasn't good.
room. Now he only had the backpack and the things he had when he woke up in the apartment.
Dean was dreading the conversion that would inevitable come, at the same time he couldn't wait.
to get this one!"). It was messy, with cheap decorations and way to many fairy lights...he loved it. Under the tree there was one small package in opposite to the tree it was neatly wrapped.  He went to the tree and put his own present next to the small one. Then he wrapped his arms around the dark haired man who failed to notice him because he was busy squinting at the tree.
Neither of them said something at first but Dean broke the award silence "so we really made a fool out of us when we called because of this exorcism huh?"
Dean ended the call and looked at Sam "From what he knows, there were two man. The witnesses  were delusional so they don't remember much - but it didn't sound like Dad..." He sighed.
"Okay" his eyes nearly bugged out of his head.
"You died?" he asked quietly.
Dean nodded and stood up "and now?" he asked.
They ended the call with a promise to meet soon and keep each other updated.
He watched them drive away and gathered himself up for the next step.
"Good - okay where do I start." He thought for a minute "You know about my mother? That she died?"
Home.
"... Mom would have wanted that?"
"I'm going to buy the ticket myself." She pouts and Dean can't help to smile, looking behind him he can see that Cas smiles as well.
"You don't have to buy me the ticket!" Jess protest but neither of the men cares about that.
"Say hello Cas." Dean looked at Cas a smile nudging him.
From what he was able to see the girl they went with the last time and her brother  (well one of them) hadn't been captured yet. That was a good sign but he didn't have much time, the Wendigo was either out to hunt them (not good) or in the cave hiding (also not good).
Dean and Cas talk
"Uha a uhm..." Dean stuttered "right pocket" was all he magnet to get out before he looked everywhere but at Cas.
"Excuse me?"
The Wendigo attacked. Dean was fast but not that fast, he nearly wasn't able to get out of the way of the monster. His gun fell down and slid away. He was fucked.
He hid himself in the shadows, eyes on the black car but out of sight of the two figures that just came out of the building.
Knocking at a door shouldn't be this hard.
They found a motel half an our away from the shop the mirror was kept in (the fact that they had to search through three small towns did nothing to lower Deans enthusiasm that he had remembered nearly exactly were they had to go). They booked one room with two beds - Jess had no problem in sharing a room with the two of them and Cas and Dean had no problem in sharing a bed, so they could save some money.
"Possible" Dean gulped.
"And the last thing:" He grins "this is a journal, nearly every hunter has one so...yeah" he shrugs again.
Dean let out a heavy sigh when he saw that Sam was staying back.
Gabriel seemed to think for a moment before he spoke. “Yeah. I am supposed to be against this but… It seems like I have lost all the fucks I had for the situation. So, here I am.”
He heaved a heavy sigh and ran a hand through his hair. “Listen, Dean. I dunno if you know this but Angels are not really male or female. It is just the vessels we prefer to take. Like anything, we prefer certain things over others. Most of the time though, especially when out grace is involved, we might as well be both.”
Castiel looked up in embarrassment and anticipation for the worst.
Castiel nodded, hugging Dean back. At the sound of the Impala’s engine, Dean stepped back and away from Castiel. Castiel did his best to hide the hurt look that crossed his eyes without his permission. He decided to head for the door.
Finally, Dean spoke again. “How did you find out?”
“Dude! How is this even possible? You have a male vessel! I thought this was only supposed to work with angels and women!”
“It was the fastest and safest way. I know the risks. Please.”
“I… I found it. It has caused a complication and I need to speak to Dean about it before I can discuss it with you. Again, I am sorry Sam.”
“Correction,” Gabriel replied with a sigh. “Angels were more happy with their little families than following the orders of heaven so those families were destroyed. Any Angel against those orders was either killed or cast out. One of the reason’s Luci started the war. Free will and jealousy of over Dad’s favoritism was just part of it. Some of the Arch Angles know the truth but most will never talk about it. Even telling you this is a big ‘no-no’ in Dad’s book.”
“It is not something that is easy to forget.” Dean cleared his throat. “Not that I want to. It’s just… weird.”
“Fine,” Castiel relented. He looked back to Dean. “On one condition. You have to tell Sam.”
Castiel and Dean jumped at the sound of Crowley’s voice. Dean rounded on him. “What the fuck?! Haven’t you heard of human decency.”
“We will figure this out. I don’t care what danger I might be in. This
“Okay,” Castiel replied softly. “Let him wait.”
“WHAT?”
“Relax Dean-o. I’m not here for the kid. I’m here as back-up. I want to screw over Heaven as much as you three. Kind of hard to do when you have an angelic army p your ass though, right?”
“What is he talking about,” Dean asked.
“Yeah. I mean. I dunno.” He let out a heavy breath and ran a hand through his hair. He stared straight ahead, through the windshield with both hands on the steering wheel, hoping it would ground him better.
…That. That actually sounded pretty great, now that Dean was thinking about it. Not that this was a topic he would ever enjoy discussing, but at least…at least he got that much. He could work with that.
Cas nodded. “Understood,” he replied, even as Dean gave him a worried glance.
Sam was quiet for a couple minutes before blurting, “Dean, I – I don’t think I’m straight.”
“So, Dean,” Cas asked distractedly as Dean cued up Grease, “I forgot to ask earlier, but are you planning to come with me next week?”
Cas turned to thank Bobby, but the gruff man just held up a hand. “It’s not a big deal, please don’t get all worked up about it,” he grumped. “If you really want to thank me, you can help me make them.”
Castiel sighed. “If you insist.”
He had to admit, his previous solution of just – not thinking about Lee only worked until the name came up again; now that Lee was back in his thoughts, haunting him again, he…couldn’t forget. And he had no other defenses. Maybe Sammy was right, maybe talking about it, purging some of his feelings would help.
Dean laughed. “Sammy. I’m fine. Why would you ask that?”
And Bobby had to admit, when Dean walked through that door with Cas’ hand in his, determined glare on his face even as his other hand trembled a little bit, Bobby knew he would do anything and everything for him – up to and including cutting Mary out of his life. ...His own life, and Dean’s, if it came to that. He hoped it wouldn’t, that Mary would see sense, but he was prepared for the worst possible outcome.
“ – I am. It’s okay – ”
After the movie ended, Dean seemed to have something on his mind – but he just kept fidgeting, not actually saying anything but clearly not wanting Cas to leave yet either. After almost five minutes of this, Cas threw up his hands exasperatedly. “Just say it, Dean.”
But after the presents had been unwrapped and the breakfast had been devoured, and the clean-up had only barely begun, there was a knock at the door.
“Oh my god, you’re at the first Ed and Scar fight, you have no idea how far you have to go…” Krissy muttered.
Dean flushed and shifted on his step. “I – it’s personal.”
Even Meg was starting to get worried after a couple weeks of this. “Alright Clarence, this…this is getting weird. I’m talking to Charlie about this ASAP, but until then – don’t go anywhere alone, okay? You don’t want to end up facing this guy by yourself, alright? Promise me.”
“Definitely, Clarence. All you freshpeople stick out – we’re a close-knit bunch. One new person is rare enough – a whole group? You all stick out, and we all try to gather you under a friendly wing ASAP.” She winked at him.
She pulled out her phone to call the house when she saw she had a text from Bobby: ‘Castiel’s not allergic to anything and the boy will do just about anything for a good burger. That plus some potatoes for fries, sweet or regular – and maybe some ice cream for homemade milkshakes? Can’t go wrong with chocolate.’
so sammy says that im a visual learner
Dean snorted. “Probably for the best. She didn’t even like pop art – pop art, Cas! Guess I should’ve taken that as a sign and broke things off earlier,” he sighed.
Sam chuckled as Dean just stared uncomprehendingly. “It’s pronounced Par-cheesy, Cas, and the rules aren’t too complicated – ”
Based on the curious glances from Cas and the insistent staring from Sam over lunch, Dean’s avoidance tactics were not going to hold up for very long – especially with Bobby and Mary catching on to both Sam and Cas trying to get Dean’s attention, and shooting him some questioning looks of their own.
“Thanks, man, that actually means a lot,” Lee replied, happiness evident in his voice. “As for Cas – Dean, it’s okay to take it slow. Really think about how you feel around him, what you can picture you two doing, what you want. After that, if you want to date him, then you should talk to him and figure out where you want to go from there.”
He wasn’t sure what was coming out of his mouth as he slid down the wall and curled up, hiding from Cas’ view, but he assumed it was as scrambled to Cas as it was to him. In the darkness of his closed eyes, Dean just took the chance to breathe.
Dean lit up. “Dude! You made your own fortune teller, it looks great!”
Dean took a deep breath. “I’m-bringing-Cas-home-to-introduce-him-as-my-boyfriend-over-break-next-week-and-I’m-so-freaking-nervous,” he blurted out.
“Ah, never mind,” Cas cut himself off – surprisingly delicately, for him.
“Yeah, of course,” Claire mumbled. “And, uh – I’m Claire. I’m new here and, uh – I’m…not exactly sure what my labels are, but I’m pretty happy to be dating my girlfriend, so. Yeah.”
One time, before Sammy started up his teasing, Cas had asked about Sammy. And Dean, never one to miss a chance to brag about his baby brother, had gone on and on about Sammy’s accomplishments. “And now he’s working here his last summer before going to get his degree at freaking Stanford.” Dean had shaken his head, still amazed. “Full ride and everything.”
It was time to make it official, put a label on it.
“Why, Cas, are you interested in the position?” said his traitorous mouth.
Donna cocked an eyebrow. “Just no? Or maybe just not what you expected? Sexuality is fluid, y’know.”
“Masterful work, you two!” Rowena chimed in. “Extra credit for deviousness.”)
Irene turned to face Mary, cell phone flipped open. “Would you feel comfortable exchanging numbers? I think I am going to talk to Castiel’s parents about him staying, and him having made a friend in the area already will definitely help – not to mention I’d hate for this to be the only time they get to see each other. They look so happy,” Irene added, smiling softly at the happy picture of the two boys chattering excitedly back and forth.
Lee was immediately all over him, right up against Dean’s back, turning him so they both faced the mirror. “Is this what you like, sweetheart?” he purred. “Wearing panties, feeling like a pretty little girl?”
Cas could see why D&D could become such an addicting game. In fact, it was one he was suddenly itching to join himself. After the session wrapped up, Charlie sidled up to Cas. “I have a strict rule against new players joining mid-campaign. But there will definitely be a seat for you next time, if you’re interested?” Charlie asked.
“No.”
At five to six, Cas was surprised to hear two sets of footsteps approaching the room – had Charlie given him the wrong time?
“Mother, please, can’t we – ”
Finally, after day fourteen of this nonsense, Cas’ patience snapped. It was time to bring out the big guns. So he once again tried to sit down with Dean at his usual lunch table, and (as usual) Dean left almost as soon as Cas sat down. But this time, instead of leaving soon afterwards, Cas stayed. “I…apologize for the intrusion, but…I’m getting desperate,” he started, looking at each of Dean’s friends. “I have been trying to talk to Dean at the behest of his brother Sam for two weeks now, with no luck. Do you, perhaps, have any advice?”
“Of course, Sammy,” Dean promised, throwing an arm around his shoulders and pulling him into a tight half-hug.
Sam turned to face him. “I mean, Bobby and Mom took Dean’s coming out pretty well, right? And, I know being ace is different, but…I shouldn’t be so scared after that…”
“Cas, I heard – ”  Dean stopped dead in his tracks before throwing himself down next to Cas, ripping the box out of his hands and shoving it hastily under the bed. “Nope.”
its not like that
Cas was pleased she had accepted his idea so readily, and left satisfied that common sense had prevailed.
He’d already sort of gotten an answer from Cas, but Sammy was smart about that sort of stuff too. The question was whether the teasing that was sure to follow would be worth asking Sammy and the better understanding of attraction.
Sam gave Dean a hard hug. “I know Lee leaving messed you up, and you didn’t want to talk about it, but – Dean. I’m here, Bobby’s here – hell, I bet even Charlie and Cas would listen. You can’t keep holding it in like this.”
Dean stared at the box in his hands, starting to sweat a little, and jumped when he heard Cas’ knock. “Dean?”
To: Cas
Dean shot a dirty look at his boyfriend. “Et tu?”
Sam shook his head, peering up at Dean nervously. And it broke Dean’s heart to think that his brother might be scared of him...the way they were both scared of their dad. Dean always swore he would never ever do that to Sammy, and now was a good time to put his money where his mouth was.
Dazed from his orgasm, Dean obeyed, only going into a stall for privacy once Lee shooed him towards it. Almost robotically, he pulled off the dirty pair, wiped himself down, put the dirty ones away, slid on his clean new ones and then his jeans.
“And nothing! Make up your mind!” Dean growled before continuing to stalk down the hall.
It wasn’t long after that Dean came crashing in. “Well?” he asked breathlessly.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, that’s about when it happened. But before I get there – did you know that Dean was Lee’s dirty little secret? I was – or, well, we thought I was the only one who knew.”
Dean finally cracked a small smile. “Well, I do have a couple ideas for what to say…”
Cas had been about to meet Dean for dinner when he heard his phone ringing. He immediately answered when he saw the caller ID. “Claire?”
Which put him right back in the how-would-Cas-feel-about-him-in-panties train of thought. Dammit.
Dean sighed. “Donna thinks I have a crush on Cas.”
Your secret is safe with me.
Claire shrugged when Mary turned to her. “Yeah, can’t argue with that.”
Before Cas knew it, Thanksgiving was right around the corner; luckily, his parents had never cared about the holiday and Cas was easily able to wiggle out of having to attend either at his home or at the Novak house. His aunt was unexpectedly subdued about his bowing out, but Cas decided to just take the easy out; now he could look forward to Thanksgiving with the Winchesters guilt-free.
Dean cleared his throat, busying himself with his food for a few moments. “The last day of school, we…had one last encounter. And then, then Lee flew off to his military training – the military training he had neglected to mention to me at all, after knowing, *knowing* that’s how my dad died, and – ”  Dean took a deep breath. “Yeah. Changed his phone number, too, had to figure out why my calls and texts stopped going through after talking to a mutual friend. And everyone knew what he was going to do – everyone except me and Sammy, and, well…like all those stupid songs, Lee broke my heart into a million pieces. And Sammy’s probably right, I probably had been using Lee as a bit of a – well, a crutch, to avoid dealing with my grief, and with Lee leaving like he did, on top of everything else…”
“Know what?” came Claire’s suspicious voice as she walked into the doorway, Kaia not far behind.
“Must be reeeeal bad to merit a phone call, Dean,” came Lee’s distinctive drawl. “You doing okay?”
Castiel Adler was a little worried about attending his first meeting of his college’s Gender and Sexuality Alliance. Asexuality was not always easily accepted – even in places like this, as his internet explorations had taught him – but he had promised himself that he would at least give it a try.
(See the end of the chapter for
In the car on the way home, he sent out a warning text to Sam and Cas, but he didn’t get a response. He figured that it was most likely because they weren’t done with talking to Bobby, and not something ridiculous like the talk with Bobby went so bad that they both turned their phones off. (Sometimes Dean’s brain was a jerk, okay?)
To which Charlie cackled, “Define good!” and the rest of the group groaned but quickly settled in. As Cas made to go sit away from the table – away from all the rowdiness, observing from a distance – Dean touched his arm lightly. “Do you want to try watching from here?” Dean asked quietly, gesturing to the seat next to him, still empty despite the closely clustered group.
Sam lit up. “Actually, Mom and Bobby and I were just talking – and I did it, I came out to Mom, and it went great!”
Dean was putting his groceries away when he heard Bobby offer to teach Cas how to make his secret burgers – and *what*??
Cas smiled. “I did have help, to be fair.”
“Oh shut up, Zachie, my god. I wanted to see my grandson, and I didn’t even think to make sure you called ahead. I forgot to because I’m old, boyo; what’s your excuse?” came an imperious voice.
Dean finally lapsed into silence, feeling…well, kinda relieved to get it all out? But also just…hollowed out. He focused on munching on his stale crackers and bread, ignoring the long-cold soup.
Cas smiled widely. “I think it would be amazing.”
Sam sighed. “Okay, and you didn’t explain this to Cas, because?”
Cas hesitated for a moment before slowly sitting down. Charlie winked at him before diving into their adventure.
“No one can talk Charlie out of anything, dammit,” Dean grumbled as the misdirected anger bled out of his stance. He set the pizzas down and started plates for both him and Cas. “I should’ve known better when Charlie insisted on getting a cheese pizza instead of her usual multi-topping experiment of the week,” Dean sighed.
[thumbs up emoji]
Cas sighed. “I suppose. Alright, well – Claire brought a friend with her, so it’ll be two teen girls we’re taking, not just one. We should probably let your mom know on the way there, and…” Cas bit his lip. “I’m not out to Claire yet. I don’t mind telling her about you being my boyfriend, but…I don’t want to navigate the whole ace thing yet, if possible.”
Cas deflated a little. “Reading about it and living it are two very different things,” he finally grumbled.
Oh sure, there was plenty of bickering and glares and suspicious thumping noises, but none of it ever festered, became something darker as it could between the Winchester brothers. It was surface level tension, nothing deeper, and Mary made sure that both her boys and Cas knew that Cas was welcome under her roof anytime, Dean or no Dean, Sam or no Sam. (Cas had been skittish enough at any mention of his family or his home life that Mary wanted to make sure he knew that he had a home with them now.)
The next day, Cas found himself more distracted than usual during his classes – still taking his impeccable notes as usual, that was a habit too well-ingrained to ignore, but there was also a small corner of his brain doing nothing other than counting the minutes until his lunch break. When the last bell finally rang, Cas packed up and practically sprinted for the cafeteria; the faster he could his food and be ready to leave with Dean, the less the other boy had to change his mind. And Cas, Sam and Charlie would all be so disappointed if Dean backed out and wasted all their hard work.
Lisa gave him a startled look. “Um, no? …Are you saying that it’s yours?”
Bobby nodded.
“Okay,” Claire gulped, as Mary reappeared. “Then I – I guess I’ll see you tomorrow morning?”
(He failed. Miserably. But he was professional and didn’t let it show.)
“No worries, kid, I gotcha,” Bobby responded gently. “Now why don’t you two skedaddle, I’ll deal with Mary and Dean when they get back.”
Dean frowned. It wasn’t fair that Cas, amazing Cas, got the short end of the dating stick just because other kids were dumb! He couldn’t change everyone’s mind in their high school, but there was *something* he could do. He could be an awesome best friend.
“Choreo – no. No dancing, not happening,” Dean declared.
“Lighten up, Mary, no way they haven’t heard it before,” she replied grumpily. “Bet Claire over here agrees, even.”
After Cas’ fifth win in a row, Dean threw up his hands. “Cas must have weighted the dice somehow!” he growled as Sam burst out laughing.
Claire kept glancing at Cassie with a confused expression she knew was on her face. Neither she nor her cousin had ever lived in a house that felt this…warm, and she wasn’t quite sure what to do about it – if anything. Mary was friendly, chattering away as she fluffed their pillows and – when she realized that Claire and Kaia hadn’t brought any extra clothes or luggage with them – bustled off to find extras elsewhere in the house.
Cas tilted his head. “And why not?”
“Fine, whatever, you losers,” she spat hatefully, gathering her things and stomping out of the room.
“Too many words,” Castiel grumbled back.
Dean just blinked at him. “…Are you saying it wasn’t?”
“Got it,” Claire agreed before hanging up.
Claire stared at her cousin before sighing. “Okay, if you promise.”
So Dean found himself spending more and more time with Cas, to the point that he decided that crashing Cas’ study sessions and starting movie nights back up wasn’t enough – Cas should start coming to D&D regularly.
Once they were in the exhibit, Dean and Cas separated – Cas liked to take his time with the all the plaques before looking at the art, while Dean was the opposite. (And if this way, Dean got to make sure he had already picked out pieces he knew Cas would like, and made sure that Cas got to see them first – well, Dean certainly wasn’t going to tell Cas that.)
“Thank you,” Cas interrupted, “but I’m not. Without it, I…I never would have met Sam, or you, or Mary – and I definitely would not be dating Dean. I…you all have been beyond amazing, welcoming me into your home and your hearts, and I…” Cas sniffled. “I wouldn’t change anything for the world.”
Cas bit his lip. “I think so. Which will mean coming clean about your original…exaggeration, as well.”
“Of course!” Dean had confirmed, not noticing Cas’ hesitation. “He’s the best thing that ever happened to me, hands down. Couldn’t be prouder, couldn’t be happier.”
“You wouldn’t want me to disappoint Bobby, would you Dean?” Cas finally said.
Sam nodded. “Got it.”
Sam hummed thoughtfully. “I mean, maybe? I didn’t exactly get into the nuts and bolts of asexuality with him, I’m not sure he knows about the sex favorability-indifference-repulsion scale…But. You and I can speculate all day, we’re not going to be able to figure it out until Dean weighs in. He’s not going to want to talk to me for a few days, I think my little hypothetical really aggravated him. He’s either going to avoid you like the plague or pretend like absolutely nothing’s wrong, hoping that I haven’t talked to you yet. You’re going to have to see what he does – if he’s in avoidance mode, you’re going to need Charlie’s help again. Or someone else, if you have any other mutual friends you think would help you out. You need to talk to him sooner rather than later, okay Cas? The sooner you clear this up, the sooner you guys can get back to normal. Or, at least, whatever you guys want normal to be.”
“More personal than teaching you the pair choreography?”
Dean hesitantly sat down. “I mean…I’m not sure it’s something I can talk out. I – Donna said something. And I kinda can’t stop thinking about it.”
Apparently Sam had enough self-preservation left to actually go when Dean told him to, although not without accompanying laughter. Dean would have to get his revenge later.
Forty-five minutes later, when Irene and Mary were starting to get a little worried, that’s exactly where they found the boys – Dean still staring and Cas at his side.
“I helped him figure out more about his labels, at least, so that was one less thing for him to worry about; but he wouldn’t listen to me when it came to the Naval Academy. Kept insisting that if it’s what Dad wanted, it had to be important. Never mind that Dad never prioritized our wants and dreams above his own,” Sam snorted. “I still think that a lot of that was the grief talking – Lee was a distraction from the grieving process, him leaving just started it all over again and left Dean wanting to fulfill Dad’s last wish, as shitty as it was.”
Sam started to chatter away about clubs and people he thought the two girls should meet, so Claire slipped her hand into Kaia’s and listened.
Cas frowned at him. “I’m serious, Dean. Do you…do you have feelings for me?”
“I’ll handle that side of things – first, where are you?”
Apparently the Winchesters went all out for Christmas – not that Cas should have been surprised, after Thanksgiving. There was a gigantic pine tree, filling the first floor with its soothing scent, and plenty of ornaments dangling from its branches. Most of them were handmade, but there were some antique-looking pieces interspersed here and there. Plenty of tinsel pretty much everywhere – the tree, the bannisters, the walls… It was a little overwhelming for Cas, Claire and Kaia, exactly how enthusiastically the family took to the holiday, but they were learning to just go with the flow and enjoy themselves.
Claire bit her lip. “And – Sam? Bobby?”
Dean’s brain started to fuzz out a little at all the possibilities Cas was parading in front of him. He spoke up when something didn’t sound all that appealing or really bothered him, but as a whole…Cas had found some very, very good ideas.
Castiel sat down on the nearby stairs and patted the step next to him. “Let’s try and talk it out, then. Hard to learn new things when you’re preoccupied.”
“…You still consider how things ended with Lee to be…your fault?” Cas responded slowly.
“Jody!” Mary scolded.
“You’re so welcome!” she chirped. “Now, since you’re going home for winter break, how are you going to knock Cas’ socks off and finally ask the poor man out?”
“Alright, you ungrateful miscreant, scat. Cas and I’ll get the girls settled.”
“But you won’t tell her where?”
“So…why, again, are your cousin and her friend here?” Sam asked. He withered immediately under Dean’s glare. “Not that I have any problem with it, really,” he yelped. “I’m just – curious.”
Kaia smiled at her. “Me too.”
Cas sighed that they didn’t really have one. Unusual for both of them to jump in headfirst into a decision like this without having a plan, but these were extenuating circumstances, Dean had to admit.
Castiel groaned and snatched up his copy of the play script he had been using to run lines with Gabriel. “Fine! Fine. Where and when are we going to be practicing?”
“Of course, my boy, of course. But you’ll tell me, won’t you?”
Whatever, Dean was bi, but...both inside and outside the community, that wasn’t always accepted. So Charlie had promised him that she would be there for his first meeting, to act as a buffer. Of course, instead, Dean’s luck struck again – right as they were heading to the meeting room, Charlie dropped an M&M. Down her shirt. She glanced apologetically at Dean but he waved her on towards the bathroom; nobody needed or deserved chocolate stains inside their clothes. He could handle a few minutes by himself. He had this.
“Promise,” Sam called back.
Cas bit his lip. “Claire…made it sound like she wasn’t welcome at home.”
…Determined to the point of ultimatums, apparently.
Dean’s knee-jerk reaction was to continue denying it. But then, once he started thinking about it…he groaned. “Charlie. Charlie, how the fuck did it take me this long to figure out I’m in love with Cas??”
Dean knew he was sputtering some sort of noise, but hell if he knew what it was, too busy imagining how Cas would look at him if he was actually wearing the panties he was still cradling in those large, steady hands…
Kaia hesitated but nodded, collecting her pajamas and towel the same way Claire had. Claire leaned on the wall next to the bathroom door as Kaia entered. “I’ll be right here,” she promised. And Kaia smiled gratefully, closing the door behind her.
He was a little worried she wouldn’t enjoy the National Galleries the same way he did, but he wanted to be as open with her as she had been with him; this was an important place for him.
Grandma Irene snorted. “Well, if that’s the only thing you’ve got left to hold over him, boyo, then you can walk right out the door – I can afford to take care of him until his trust fund kicks in.”
Bobby turned to face them properly. “Yes?”
Cas was ace, and Dean was going to stop perving on him in his mind RIGHT. NOW.
The man paused.
Both girls nodded, and off they went.
“Why don’t you go ahead and switch those out, put the old ones in the bag for me, okay sweetheart?”
When Dean and Cas arrived at Dean’s house, and his mom asked how Sam and Cas met, Dean barreled in with the same story he had explained to Cas – with a little more to it, as Cas had suggested, but Dean’s original explanation was the bare bones of it. His mother accepted it completely, but Dean could have sworn he saw Bobby raise an eyebrow at both him and Cas for just a second before the expression disappeared.
Castiel groaned but entered both phone numbers into his phone. “Done. Can I go home now?”
dean winchester, not excited to be the center of attention?
Cas beamed at him. “It’s not far – just a couple blocks away.”
“Enough, Sammy,” Dean would always growl as he watched Cas’ bright eyes dim.
And once Cas and Sam were ready, he asked his mom if he could go grocery shopping with her; he was appalled at the lack of snacks in the house for movie night, and he wanted to do some restocking – clearly his mom couldn’t be trusted. She laughed at his dramatics, but easily agreed.
“Awww, that’s it?” Donna pouted as Jody scooped a decent-sized but not all that large portion of sweet potatoes onto her plate.
Dean ended up winning the first game, although Sam certainly put up a fight, but then Cas started rolling almost spookily perfect numbers, racking up win after win as Dean got more and more frustrated and Sam more and more gleeful.
Dean bit his lip, uncomfortable with the thoughts suddenly occurring to him. “Yeah, at the time I didn’t really think about it, but it was weird that he could keep getting his hands on so many…” He stiffened. “I hope he didn’t steal them.”
“Alright, alright, enough already, all this lovey-dovey stuff is too much! My girlfriend’s halfway across the country, jackasses, and all your flirty crap is just making me miss her more,” Gabriel whined from behind them, startling Dean into letting Charlie go. “Where’s the food? I was promised a feast.”
Mary smiled and gestured for the woman to sit on the bench next to her. “And here I thought I was the only person in the city crazy enough to bring a child to an art museum,” she joked.
guess its been ok
Dean sighed but raised his hands in defeat.
…And he definitely wanted to do something with it.
Lisa scowled. “Cas?”
Bobby nodded. “Yeah, if – if it’s okay with you, let me have a talk with her before you spring it on her? She was not happy about Dean’s talk being out of the blue, and I promised I wouldn’t let that happen again,” Bobby finished apologetically.
“Y’know, it’s – it’s been a while since we saw the concourse. How about we head there next?”
Sam peered up at him, a strange look in his eyes. “And…is there anything you want to tell me, Dean?”
Sam blinked hard. “Asexual,” he croaked. “Probably heteroromantic.”
Kaia gulped, shrinking in on herself, and Claire jumped up to block Zachariah’s view of her. “Enough! Leave her alone,” she demanded. “I – we were only talking about a shopping date,” she lied desperately.
Cas hunched his shoulders. “I – probably not, no,” he mumbled.
“Well, you know they’ll be safe under my mom’s roof. Between her and Bobby, pretty sure there’s nothing they can’t handle. It’ll be okay, Cas – they’ll be okay.” Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and gave a comforting squeeze.
Cas hummed. “First of all, Dean, I would never abandon our friendship because of a dating partner – what is the saying, bros before hos?”
Cas turned to Sam, who took a deep breath. “I…I think it’s time I came out to Mom and Bobby,” he confessed.
“You, on the other hand, have proven yourself to be underhanded and sneaky and who knows what you would do with my phone number. Ergo, you’re not getting my phone number, but I’m happy to take your brother’s.”
So Cas did what he had been longing to do since he saw them – he picked up the almost-perfect blue panties, fingering the silky material. “These are very nice, Dean,” he rumbled, voice having gone surprisingly deep all of a sudden.
Cas offered to help, but Ellen shut that down quickly. “No idea what your skill level is, hon, and we’ve got more than enough cooks in here already. Shoo,” was her command, and Cas shooed. He spent some time with Sam, since they hadn’t been texting much with Cas in the middle of midterms right before break.
Speaking of – Charlie grinned over at him as she started to pack up her materials. “Pretty amazing, isn’t it?”
Dean blew out a breath. “Alright. Like I said, Bobby first. But before that, research.”
And here's Severepaperdragon's AMAZING art for a scene in this chapter! (You can also find it on Tumblr
“I can’t disagree with the sentiment, Jody, but you can still watch your language in my house,” Mary grumbled.
(Later, he’d wish that he’d been awake enough to realize exactly what his father was up to, but for the moment – peaceful sleep.)
Suddenly Lee didn’t want to do anything until he saw that Dean was wearing something Lee had brought him underneath his normal pair of jeans. Then Lee would be all hands, rubbing all over Dean’s ass, crooning all sorts of nicknames; baby girl, babydoll, sweetheart. But it was “good girl” that was Dean’s favorite and got the loudest moans; Lee used it sparingly.
He sighed. “She…she showed up on campus yesterday, and asked me for a safe place to stay.” He heard her gasp but he forged on. “She also asked me not to tell you where she is.”
Bobby just settled pointedly into his recliner.
“And, I mean, part of it was – I was only just realizing I wasn’t completely straight, right? It was a pretty recent development before the kiss, and then…then things with Lee got a lot more hot and heavy. I mean, no penetration or anything,” Dean continued quickly, “but…there were definitely orgasms.” He paused. “Almost all of them mine, actually, now that I’m thinking about it,” he continued distantly before shaking his head. “Suffice to say, things got…a lot more intense. And I missed a lot of warning signs. The last day of school…”
Dean was terrified that his mother was going to go on her shopping trip and come back only to tell him that he was a disgrace and no longer welcome in her house.
Charlie had texted him that Dean was going to show up with pizza on Friday at six. A direct interference with their usual pop culture night, Cas realized bitterly, but resolutely let go of any hard feelings; that was not the point of tonight’s meeting.
He hesitated, fists clenching and unclenching. How could he put this, without sounding like the wimp he still kinda felt it made him, no matter how many times Sam told him the opposite?
“Don’t worry about it Cas, I have to be there anyway,” Dean explains. “Mom and Bobby don’t know Sam’s ace, so there’s no other reason for you two to have met other than me introducing you.”
John had insisted that Mary take the trip to the National Art Gallery that she had been planning. Sam might not be feeling up to the trip, fussy due to his slight fever, but John assured her he was more than capable of taking care of his younger son for the day.
But even though his workout helped, he still knew that he was nowhere near ready to talk to Cas about…any of it. Not Lee, not why he was still so upset; for once, he just had no idea what he could possibly talk to Cas about. So he didn’t. He canceled their next pop culture night and ignored all of Cas’ attempts to reschedule until Cas stopped asking about them, but he never gave up on trying to talk to Dean at lunch, no matter how many times Dean pushed him away. It got to the point that Dean realized he was being a total asshole, shutting Cas out like this…which only caused him to push Cas away harder, because Cas didn’t deserve any of Dean’s bullshit in his life.
At first, Dean didn’t get it. “Of course we’ve been driving safe, Bobby, you know me better than that!”
Bobby just winked at him. “I’ve got a secret recipe, makes ‘em better than anything you can get in a restaurant. You’ll see.”
Cas raised an eyebrow. “Dean, you know the only reason I went last time – ”
Dean was a little occupied with the bacon when his phone buzzed, but after he saw it, Cas noticed that Dean flushed a bright red. Interesting. Maybe Sam’s text would convince Dean to talk about whatever he was hiding; they were boyfriends now, after all.
Sam and Bobby and his mom were upset, of course, but Dean…all he could think about was how he had been so dreading John coming back, that a little part of him had wished that John would never come home, and now – now he never would.
Dean’s neck got hot, and Cas smiled as he pictured the blush spreading over his boyfriend’s face. “I hate it when you’re right,” Dean groaned.
“No...” Dean admitted.
Dean shook his head, teeth gritted. “No. Or, well, yes, but – it was more than that. I – Lee was military, Dad was military. I never felt like I was good enough for Dad, and then – then I wasn’t good enough for Lee. They were both homophobic dickwads, in their own ways, and – ”  Dean waved a hand helplessly.
“Ohhh, am I,” Kaia groaned, smiling at Claire’s replying smirk.
Cas frowned. “All these?”
“What was for him?”
Cas just tilted his head, the adorable bastard. “And why not?”
Neither girl was expecting Mary Winchester emerging with a smile and a hug for both of them. “Hello, hello, welcome! I hope you two don’t mind sharing the guest bedroom? It is only one bed, but it’s a double, should be plenty of room for both of you skinny things! Looks like we have a lot of feeding to do,” she nodded to herself as she assessed her two houseguests.
Sam wrinkled his nose. “But Cas is my friend,” he whined. “Can’t Dean just…like someone else?”
After the second screaming match with John that had included him raising a hand to strike her… even if the blow was never delivered, even if John swore that he would never hurt her, twice was enough of a pattern that it became a threat that Mary decided to heed. She was going to take care of herself and her sons.
Cas sighed. “Well, her opinion aside, I have to admit it…suits you.”
“It’s fine, Cas, look – Claire and Kaia are here, Jody wouldn’t have left without them if she had to take them back. It’s okay, it’s not your fault,” Dean soothed.
Cas sighed. “What would you say, exactly?”
Claire let a small smile escape at the sight. It looked like Dean was well-practiced at taking care of Cassie; good. He could use someone looking after him.
“You…wore these? For Lee?” Cas asked carefully.
In the moment, Dean went a bit on autopilot, nodding and offering one-word answers to Lisa while trying to absorb the fact that Lisa had broken up with him. And it wasn’t like he’d been in love with her or anything, but – he thought they’d been working, been content together if not exactly blindingly happy. Had he done something wrong?
“Sooo, when did you two start dating?” Meg asked slyly one day at lunch.
No response. Dean stayed quiet for about a minute before bursting out, “Seriously?? Nothing??”
Dean could not, okay? The best way to his heart was through his stomach and his brother, and unfortunately (fortunately?), Cas had already mastered the latter and was well on his way to mastering the former. Dean knew he was in trouble, but this? This just sealed the deal – maybe Cas didn’t deserve Dean’s bullshit, but Dean didn’t care anymore; this was not someone he could allow to get away without a fight.
“Argh, fine!” Dean groaned. “I’ll do it. I can’t promise I’ll be any good. Send whoever this guy is my number, Sammy,” he threw back over his shoulder as he stomped backstage. “Now I’ve got a set piece to finish painting.”
Hope you enjoyed! For now, this is as much I have planned for this series; but there is likely to be more, I'm just not sure when inspiration will strike.
Dean continued as normal during his calls, texts and video chats with Cas. This confession wasn’t something he wanted to do virtually; it had to be in person. Or, well, he tried to be normal – Cas definitely knew something was up, but Dean reassured him that he was just planning something for their winter break meetup (which was entirely true, if a complete understatement) and Cas stopped pressing him.
Recap of the flashback chapter within! A much milder telling, but just in case, those warnings still apply.
Dean peeked up at Cas for a second before burying his head again. “I mean, a little,” came a muffled reply. “But not…not entirely, either.”
So he tried kissing Benny at a party (Benny, the level-headed and reliable paladin of his D&D group; gorgeous, with piercing blue eyes and a charming drawl) and both had mutually agreed that they lacked chemistry and were far better off as friends.
Dean flopped on his bed and groaned into his comforter. For such a nerdy-looking guy, Cas (Castiel was such a damn mouthful, Cas was so much easier, especially in his own head) was a damn hard taskmaster. Lines had gone well the night before, and Dean was thankful that they had stuck when Cas drilled him on them that night, but then Cas had started on the choreography – and that was ridiculous. Cas could explain it until his tongue fell out, but Dean just wasn’t. Getting. It. And he wanted to, he really wanted to, he hated feeling stupid like this – but whatever Cas said just went in one ear and out the other.
“And I guess you didn’t grab anything to eat after she cancelled?” Cas muttered, giving Dean a knowing glance.
Cas took a deep breath. “You’re right. Thank you, Sam. I…I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
Sam blew out a breath. “Thank you. So, it had gotten intense. Maybe more intense than Lee expected? Whatever the case, something happened on the last day of classes – Dean never told me exactly what, which is probably good for my sanity – and, in his own way, Lee must have been saying goodbye. Because, as it turns out, Lee had gotten on a plane bound for an army base the very next day. With a new phone in his pocket. Apparently he had warned everyone besides Dean that he planned to basically cut contact with everyone once he left. Dean didn’t even know that he had planned to join the military, and especially with Dad so recent…”
Claire shot a quick look at Cas before gingerly accepting the hug. Grandma Irene seemed to whisper something to her that put Claire at ease, and she melted into the hug.
After a humiliating loss at Boggle (how had he let himself be tricked into playing, again?), Dean slunk back to his room. Cas was still staring avidly at his laptop.
“No, go ahead,” Cas replied quickly.
“Are you sure that you’re actually okay with being left behind, Dean?”
Shit. “Well, I, uh, Castiel’s just a bit of a mouthful, and – “
Cas was pretty sure he was going to be comparing Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring and Ingres’ Grande Odalisque, but he had accompanied Dean on his trip anyway – not that Dean was complaining, at all. It was nice to spend some time with Cas outside of classes – both of them had been busy with college visits, their extracurriculars (Dean playing on the school’s baseball team, Cas working as a theatre tech behind the scenes of the school plays), not to mention Dean’s revolving door of dates.
Cas rubbed his forehead exasperatedly. “Should I bother to ask?”
Cas’ smile morphed into a smug smirk. “Get used to it,” he teased as he sat up. “And we should get to researching…maybe in different rooms,” he added quietly as he stared at Dean’s full-body stretch.
Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and gave it a quick squeeze. Whatever his father decided to throw at them next, he and his family would figure it out.
“Dean’s been susceptible to a good puppy-dog-eyes since I was five, I figured yours would work just as well,” he chuckled.
“G-R-E-E-N,” Dean counted out loud. “Pick a number?”
Once they were settled, Cas starting to eat and Dean starting to pick at least a little at his food, Dean began to speak.
yknow
But when Castiel checked the paper, there wasn’t one but two phone numbers – one labeled with an S, one labeled with a D.
Cas couldn’t help rolling his eyes. “You’re just as good at research, Mr. Encyclopedic Knowledge of Cars and Rock Music, as long as it interests you. And my guess is that research into BDSM will end up being very interesting indeed.”
“I think they’d look even better on you,” he continued, looking up to see Dean’s flush deepen to more of a scarlet shade.
Cas was hoping that would be the end of having to deal with his relatives – especially once Bobby returned saying that the school transfer was well underway. He may have been hoping against hope, but at least he had an uninterrupted evening.
When Jody and Donna showed up, arms full of even more food, Cas was astonished. Exactly how much food was this dinner going to have?
“Right,” Claire snorted. “I bet he was. Did he tell you why we were here, or just that we shouldn’t be here?”
Claire snorted. “Obviously.”
He didn’t love Lee’s habit of getting him off and almost immediately disentangling himself, giving Dean a quick kiss and disappearing, but – Dean could handle it.
“Castiel! There you are,” he boomed. “Didn’t mean to surprise you like this, but – well. The situation changed.”
Cas nodded. “At the end of the exhibit, they have some of his reversible paintings – put on the wall one way, there’s a painting; but if you put the same painting on the wall upside down, there’s a whole other painting to see. The museum has mirrors placed so you can see both paintings at once.”
“I do love pie,” Donna sighed wistfully as she watched the sweet potato bowl continue down the table.
“Shame,” she tsked but – to her credit – stopped with the eye-fucking and immediately Castiel felt far more comfortable in her presence. “And…I’m sorry, what did you say your name was?”
The silence on the other end of the phone was…ominous. “Hello?” Cas asked cautiously, hoping against hope that the call had been miraculously cut.
Dean. Link is a leading role, you have a hell of a lot of lines and choreography and plenty of other little things to learn. This is not something that can be squeezed into a couple hours.
“Shall we?” Dean asked, sweeping an arm around Cas’ shoulders.
Finally he forced out, “…Cas?”
Cas laughed bitterly.
Dean chuckled. “I’m not a stalker anymore, we’ve introduced ourselves and you’re about to make friends with my brother – because Sammy always manages to make friends – which means that I’m very logically taking care of Sammy’s friend-to-be, and knowing where you live is not going to be used for anything other than knowing you got home safe, okay?”
“I don’t want to hear it, Lee, that was below the belt and you know it. *You’re* the one who wanted to keep this quiet, not me!”
Cas pointed at him. “That. That’s exactly how I feel about people. They’re art – they can be beautiful, and I can appreciate that, but the idea of having sex with them is…” Cas shuddered. “Unappealing.”
She just blushed and shrugged.
No, all he could focus on was talking himself out of talking himself out of talking to Cas.
Then Dean was onstage, singing his heart out, seeing Lee wink at him from behind his podium as Corny Collins, dancing with Anna-as-Amber and Donna-as-Tracy…and then taking his bow as the performance ended and the auditorium exploded with applause.
“I – wh – how did you know??” Sammy sputtered into the phone. “For all you know, she could be a he!”
To: Lee
Cas stayed silent.
Bobby nodded. “Your brother always was a little quick to the self-sacrificial altar,” he responded slowly.
Cas nodded slowly. Dean did make some good points.
(See the end of the chapter for
This is the chapter that earned the M rating! The warnings about John Winchester, Lee Webb, Dean's panty/feminization kink and bad BDSM etiquette are in full effect; if any of that is worrying, there will be a (much less detailed) recap in another chapter - you do not need to read this to understand the rest of the fic.
Cas squeezed back and gave Dean a small smile. “It is. And for the car ride, I thought…” He reached into his pocket with his free hand and pulled out a slightly crumpled and rough-edged fortune teller.
Cas nodded just as Dean barreled up to Bobby. “I’ve been trying to get you to tell me the recipe for YEARS and Cas gets to know after just a couple days??” Dean exclaimed.
“I…I don’t know if I have all the answers you want,” Cas started slowly. “But I’ve always felt that my interest in sex was best described as somewhere between neutral and opposed – or indifferent and repulsed, if you want to use the scale properly. But. The point is – whatever I am, I am definitely interested in looking and touching, that is for certain. As for doing anything like – that asshole,” he spat, “my only interest in doing anything like him is replacing bad memories with better ones.” His voice grew deeper. “So, at least to start, plan on that happening. And depending on how it goes, I am very interested in…exploring further avenues. And Dean? This is not a one-way street. It’s not only up to me, what we do and what’s on the table. I want to know what interests you, what happens in your secret fantasies – and do my best to make them reality.” He coughed lightly. “After doing some research, of course. I don’t – I don’t know for sure what is within my comfort zone, or what my boundaries are exactly, but – I have some ideas. And there’s plenty of room to…investigate.”
Clean, warm and a little dazed at the luxury of the feeling, Claire headed back to her and Kaia’s room. Kaia jumped a little when she walked in, but relaxed when she saw it was Claire. “It’s okay,” Claire promised, reaching for her hand and giving it a soft squeeze when Kaia bridged the distance. “It’s a really nice bathroom. But…do you want me to watch the door? Just in case?”
Cas just blinked at him. “I was expecting you might say a number of things, Dean, but I have to admit that was none of them.” He reached out and took Dean’s hand again. “Did you want to tell me about that ‘stuff’ now?”
“It’s my pleasure, honey,” Jody smiled at them before heading out.
Krissy smirked. “No offense. But hey – you have a favorite character yet?”
So Cas let himself get pulled into playing Boggle – which was indeed fun, if a little loud between rounds. He was almost completely distracted from Dean’s strange behavior; at least until Dean came knocking, almost timidly, at Sam’s door. “Uh, Sammy is it…is it okay if I borrow Cas for a little while?” Dean asked awkwardly.
…What had Cas said? He had said something wrong, he knew he had, but the one time he asked Dean about it, Dean brushed him off and Cas…Cas was afraid to ask again and make it worse.
Dean threw up an arm to stop him. “Uh. Maybe now is not...the best time?”
Dean just gaped. “I – he didn’t do anything wrong! I just – I thought – this was for him!”
Think about what he wanted to do with Cas, huh? Dean could do that.
Dean hopped up on the bed and settled next to Cas, peering at the laptop screen.
“Mother,” Zachariah sighed as he looked up to the ceiling, “please don’t take the Lord’s – ”
“Ah,” Bobby sat back slightly in his seat. “I see.”
“Because! I didn’t think I had to; I thought it was obvious!”
“No – no, Cas, I didn’t say it was a certainty or anything, I just brought it up as a hypothetical, and Dean just…reacted really strongly,” Sam hurried to explain. “…Almost too strongly. Like…like he was certain you didn’t want to date him. Have you two already talked about this?”
“G-Grandma?” Cas asked shakily.
Cas stepped forward softly. “I can go wait in the car, if you give me the keys?”
“It wasn't stalking! Just...recon. I can't let just anybody near my little brother." Dean retorted.
Dean just stared at him. In love with Cas??
See you then.
Dean rolled his eyes; she had been trying to make that a thing for years, but usually it was actually – “What did Bobby tell you?”
Dean looked away.
“Yeah, yeah, go,” Claire whispered back, getting up to sit next to Cas and clutch his hand as Kaia fled.
Dean went silent. “Let’s just say it was bad,” he finally continued. “And Lee being my first…anything since figuring out I…wasn’t straight, there was some…”
“Well, partially maybe,” Cas admitted. “Still. Very well-done, for your first time.”
After the burgers were ready, Bobby made Cas swear not to tell Dean anything Bobby had taught him. “It’s a secret Dean has tried too many underhanded ways to get, so he’s lost any right to get it honestly. Do not fall for any of his tricks,” Bobby explained sternly. “And this way, if he really wants a taste of home while he’s at school, you can make them for him. But don’t let him watch while you’re making them – get a friend to distract him or something, because he will try to sneak in the kitchen to take a look, I’ve caught him far too many times.”
“You’ve got plenty on your plate,” Jody replied gruffly, and Claire thought that was the end of it – but she also saw Jody sneak some of her own sweet potatoes onto Donna’s plate later.
Dean nodded.
“Yeah, okay, spare me the pathetic attempts at distraction,” Dean drawled. “What’s her name?”
“Good, good. And?”
Dean hugged him back, forcing a smile. “I’ll text you later, Sammy,” was all he said in response.
really
Claire took a deep breath before she walked into the room. As she had promised herself, here she was at her first GSA meeting. Kaia had originally planned to come with her, but she got unexpectedly tied up in working on a group project, so Claire was going in alone. She had supportive texts from Cassie, Dean, Sam and Charlie on her phone; she could do this.
“What else is family for?” Cas quipped. “Stay where you are, I’ll text you for more details after I talk to Dean, okay?”
Then they arrived at the car and all piled in, Dean’s gaze promising Cas that his boyfriend was definitely grilling him later.
Bobby grunted. “I taught them how to play, and I definitely didn’t explain it that way, but next thing I know, these two idjits have started talking like that, and…”  Bobby shrugged. “You get used to it.”
“Fine, I guess,” Claire responded. “I made a friend. They’ve read FMA – recognized the symbol I was doodling.”
What was – No. Dean looked down and yup, he was starting to get hard. Shit. Shit-shit-shit, why would Cas even want to see that, he was ace, Dean had to –
“I know they’re connected, but I can’t see how and Dean refused to explain when I asked him,” Cas huffed.
Dean bought himself some time by serving up the pizza, but even George’s couldn’t save him for too long; Cas was far too determined to talk.
“Here on campus, actually,” Claire replied awkwardly. “But I wasn’t sure where your dorm was, so we’re just sitting outside – ”
Dean thought his heart was going to beat out his chest. Cas was just staring into the box, not saying anything, and his face wasn’t moving - Dean couldn’t tell what he was thinking.
“Of course,” Cas promised. “She will be perfectly fine where she is right now. She’s out right now, otherwise I’d ask if she wanted to talk to you, but – ”
Mary and Bobby exchanged glances, Bobby going to answer it.
“You could probably even talk about the past year of working as a gap year to better understand the industry you want to end up in,” Sam piped up.
He gasped, did she just?
The empty getting Cas.
The brothers chocked on their beer.
"What?" Was all Dean got out, Sam seemed to have forgotten how to speak.
Coming back she had two beers, two glasses and a bottle of something brown with her "I think we gonna need that" Jess sad while sitting down again and giving Dean a bottle. He took a gulp.
"Uhm I kind of became friends with Jess?" he said, even if it more or less sounded like a question.
The first to steps were easy. The cars were already stocked with the essential thing he just had to get some more things.  Then he was ready to go.
Slowly and carefully she put the things out. In the bag was a gun, small cleaning kit, some silverbullets with a devilstrap engraved in it, salt packs, a small first aid kit, a silver knife, one change of clothes (they guessed Jess size but he was pretty confident that he guessed right), matches, a small bottle with gasoline and "okay these things I understand - but those?" Jess pointed at the three remaining things.
"I don't know for sure but I like to think so." Dean said smiling and then he had his arms full of Cas.
Cas somehow managed to get a tree into the bunker without Dean noticing, so when he came out of their room on the 25th a messy wrapped present in his hands looking for his angel he was surprised to see him, only in boxers, trying to decorate the small, and ugly, tree ("they wouldn't sell him because he doesn't fit their standards...Dean I
He nodded and made his way out of the room.
Dean let him fall back "Okay this makes it kind of easier than I thought, I don't have to explain everything - that is good"
"What the fuck Cas?"
She nods "good and now eat before it gets cold"
"Well shit"
Dean took a seat opposite to her "I heard about that...but how did you?"
Well, that had come out stronger than planned. Cas didn't seem to mind.
"What are you thinking about?" Jessica interrupts his thoughts.
Dean persuaded him to loose the suit (but he keep his trench coat (Dean won't admit but he liked the stupid coat)) so now he was dressed in a dark jeans, a black shirt and a blue flannel which was rolled up. Dean hadn't thought that Cas had any fashion sense but he was wrong, and if he was honest Cas' goddamn DocMartens did drive him crazy. He swallowed
"Good - if I remember right in the next few days there will be a ghost attack in...Nebraska I think? I will know were when I see it. I already know what is going to happen, so we can prevent some deaths and you will meet your first ghost."
Dean nodded and followed her in the living room. He kneeled down next to the body and checked him again.
"Are we dead?"
TW: Descriptions of attempted rape
"My grandfather was one, kind of, he gave his knowledge to my mother and she gave it to me. Cas is the hunter of the family I mostly do some research, we didn't have much contact since he his older than me but when the two of you went away the first time I called him, asking if knows some hunter named John Winchester. All he had to say was that he knew his name. I met up with him when you were out on this other hunt and he took me out for a hunt because I wanted to learn how to react if something would happen and yes," she shrugged "more questions?"
A few weeks go by. Dean and Cas went to Cleveland with the hope of finding Gabriel there but nothing. Right now some old guy was the janitor at the university who would retire next year then Gabriel would probably take his job. They would go back then and while there were at it they would keep their ears open about activity that sounds like a trickster.
Dean nods "Good, how far are you with the exorcism?"
"Well, I meet my boyfriends brother from the future and exorcised a demon with him. I'm not sure there is a thing that can shock me anymore. Whats the next thing you are going to tell me? You are friends with god?"
Jess just nods but she doesn't seem convinced. Dean starts the car again. While he does Jess phone starts to ring
The older one scratches the back of his head "I just threw something together, we both haven't really slept so I thought maybe some food will us keep working" she grins and to his surprise hugs him.
"What exactly?"
He mumbles more to himself than to her "yeah, but I died once because of food poisoning"
And hope that Sam would stay in contact with him when the hunt was over.
