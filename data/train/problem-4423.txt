And then it stops. As quickly as it had started Cas’ pulling turns to gentle but definitive pushing, and he leans back, blue eyes searching Dean’s green ones.
“You’re going to end up as one of those straight A students we hear so much about,” mom said, smiling at him before turning to pour two cups of coffee. Handing one to Dean who finally met her eyes, she asked his plans for the day.
He looks up from the rectangular box, meeting Cas’ eyes. “Uhm, what’s this?”
“So?” He mumbled going back to his drawer to try and find the green Henley he knew had to be somewhere.
He doesn’t forget to break their meeting up before it can escalate though, “Yeah, that’s great. Let’s go get breakfast, Cas.”
Dean huffs a breath of laughter and relief. “We’re good then? I promise nothing like that will happen again. I know about my reputation but I don’t cheat.”
“Hey!” Charlie says.
He stalked off for the entrance, letting Dean do what he could to keep up.
Castiel tried his best not to blush, “No, I ah, I’ve been a little preoccupied lately.”
“Can you turn around? I’m not getting a good angle,” he says.
Dean grins, he
“He thinks I don’t love him,” Castiel repeated to the rose in his lap.
Dean chuckles but doesn’t say anything.
“I’m aware. We’re going somewhere else. I will not sit around and watch you flirt for another hour when it’s my job to get you to pass your classes,” he zipped his bag with determination, not caring if Dean thought he was some geeky slave driver.
“Me too,” Dean agrees, “Need a ride?”
And he freezes.
Dean jumps in shock (definitely not squealing), dropping his phone and he can hear Castiel running away on the crunchy gravel.
He spends his time between work, sleep and revising. Sometimes a mix of the three.
his own
But it wouldn’t be the first time he’s misinterpreted friendliness for flirting. He cringes as he remembers the first two weeks of getting to know Benny.
“Closer?” Cas asks. He’s staring intently at the group of alligators.
“How’re you guys doing?” Charlie asks, apparently done with her paragraph (or sentence, more likely, they’ve been here for a couple of hours, there’s not enough concentration to finish a paragraph in one go anymore).
But honestly, he feels like someone’s poured glitter on his soul.
Dean is walking Cas to class because he’s a moron in love. At least he refrains from offering to carry his books.
. He eats half a grapefruit and two sunny side ups with three cups of coffee at the breakfast buffet and then he stalls in the reception.
Dean is still panicking when the guy stops in front of him at the counter. Dean should have run away to hide in the staff restroom and let Charlie deal with him. She probably doesn’t watch porn with men in it. He rolls his shoulders and smiles his service-smile, telling himself
The first person he sees is Anna, of course, who is the host of the evening’s event, “Cas! I didn’t know you were coming!” she kisses his cheek.
He trudges unashamed into the mass of people and pillows, tipping over a bowl and stepping on a hand as he goes. Cas follows but avoids catastrophes.
Dean glared at her, trying to discretely wipe his chin in case he really was drooling, “Fuck off.”
Castiel had moved a middle school student who was failing English to Tuesday and told her he was available. She had been ecstatic.
“We hung out all the time, Dean! And then we had that
“Nah I know, it’s for your patience. Though I know you have to have a lot of it to be dating Dean in the first place,” she says, grinning playfully.
Castiel frowned again, blood starting boil at Dean’s obvious disregard for what they were doing. He closed his book with a loud thud and started to pack up.
They’re not holding hands because Dean still has hang-ups, but Cas holds the door open for Dean and Dean walks backwards through it, telling Cas about when he and Sam saw the largest ball of twine twice.
They all approve by the end of the trip, and they survive the awkward breakup Cas’ sister, Anna, has with her boyfriend who turns out to be homophobic.
Dean takes direction well, and he moans, low and wretched when Cas circles his hole, enters one finger.
“Dinner’s ready soon,” Sam informed him.
“Yeah!” Dean agrees and smiles too bright and offers to bring coffee for the both of them way too eagerly.
“Wait! Hang on,” she said and Dean backed up. Her and Sam were still in the middle of dinner. It smelled so good that Dean kind of regretted not staying.
“I dropped my phone,” Dean admits, “It must’ve landed light down.” He takes a tentative step in the direction he thinks Cas is in.
Dean comes home then but finds that, without Cas, it doesn’t really feel all that much like home anymore.
Dean runs a hand over the posters, neating up the pile, “So, uh… You a fan?”
Dean thought he was having a stroke but managed to squeak out an agreement. Castiel just smiled and nodded, clearly satisfied, and then he went back to bowling.
She was leaning back on the hind legs of her chair from where she’d been sitting at a table behind them, “Dude! Are you Dean’s tutor?”
Cas shrugs, “He was probably waiting for you to say it.”
talk about feelings after about an hour and a half, Benny doesn’t even judge him or say it’s because he’s ‘half gay’. He just tells him to stop worrying so much; he’ll always have him and Charlie.
Castiel felt almost faint as he kept holding his breath in anticipation. Surely, Dean couldn't believe that Castiel didn’t feel the same way about Dean.
Castiel gulps, “Uhm, no. Sorry.”
Dean is looking back at him, green eyes cloudy with arousal, his lips are glistening wet, lush and stretched around Cas’ cock. There’s a mix of saliva and precum running down his chin, and his hand is working himself at lightening speed inside his pants.
Dean shrugs, “Meh. It’s college. There are desperate singles year-round.”
They have had lunch together, and a little bit of a make-out session. That’s how Dean found himself walking Cas to class. His own schedule doesn’t pick up again for another two hours, so why not.
Dean just hums his understanding. Cas goes into the living room to get his laptop which he sets on the floor, and pulls up a 'Sickening Drag Queen Make Up Tutorial' video on youtube.
“What, did he fart on your pillow or something?” Dean grinned.
Dean pushes off the armrest to get off of Cas and the other man scoots back until they’re next to each other, still facing each other but no longer on top of one another.
“Well, I obviously didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. Now everyone’s uncomfortable,” she gestures to the lot of them with an angry arm movement.
One of Cas’s favourite pieces was a mixed media shadow box that Meg had made about demonology. It consisted of a large, gold-painted wooden box frame a couple of inches deep, filled with various items mounted on black velvet backing.
“Like I’d ever follow in your footsteps, loser!”
“Right? And look how cute some of the tattoos people have of them are.”
Abby was just as prickly as Meg on the outside, but he wasn’t sure what was underneath. He half expected Abby to have gastralia like a t-rex just because he couldn't imagine her having anything so human as a soft underbelly. Perhaps Meg was close enough that she could see the hidden vulnerability that he did not. Or perhaps Meg just needed someone who was cold and hard all the way through to their core. Meg, who was ashamed of her own kindness because, to her, it was inextricably linked to weakness.
He found Cas up and dressed, standing next to the bed. Dean walked over to him and took his hand.
“No women, right, ok...” Dean looked thoughtful and a little awkward before rallying. “That's fine, dude, I'm open minded, I can take you to a gay bar, wingman for you, find you some hot guy to take home. I promise I'll try not to let
“Do you want a ride?” he asks.
“No-no,” Castiel held up a hand, “I just got up too late. My apologies.”
He bites his lip to stop laughing, “But yeah, we’re not quite there yet.”
Cas huffs a little laugh, “Not really, but thanks.” His voice is a little closer now.
Sam cheers.
Dean sat down on the edge of a chair, “We’re rehearsing everyday now. It has to be perfect.”
There’s a lot of making out and fooling around. A bit less around finals. After Dean’s last one, they take off in Dean’s car, roadtripping first to Sacramento for Cas’ cousin’s wedding where Dean meets Cas’ thousand cousins, and his parents. From there they go to Las Vegas for the hell of it, and they stay one night in a bed and breakfast somewhere in Wyoming, also for the hell of it. And then they make it to Sioux Falls. Where all the fuckheads Dean call family wants to know what in hell Cas is doing with Dean.
Castiel is hit by a cloud of humidity when he steps off the plane. He immediately unzips his fleece sweater, one he was glad to have on the freezing plane but that he doubts he’ll use much again before the flight home in six weeks.
“Anyway, I’ll talk to him today. You have a meeting with your supervisor, right?”
They spend the next hour and a half being too busy to talk but when the lunchtime rush dies down and they’re left with a few patrons scattered at the tables, Charlie turns to him.
your thesis. Even if your aims are rejected, your committee will guide you and you’ll still pass the comp exam before summer,” Sam taps on his laptop, “Now what’s your login?”
Castiel’s nonexistent resolve broke and he walked the few steps forward and opened the door. Before getting in, he looked at Dean again, “You’re sure? I’ll be fine walking if it makes you uncomfortable.”
“Don’t even talk about it,” Dean grins, and Castiel grins back and they’re weirdly silent again while they just stare at each other. Dean’s not sure if they’re just behind on sleep or if they’re forming a pattern here. He clears his throat, “Hey, you said you haven’t been eating right. Can’t focus on school if you’re not eating properly, Cas. Wanna grab a bite? D’ya have time?”
Castiel glares at her over his shoulder as he makes his way to the car.
long term and Dean’s
As it turns out he gets a reply from Cas before Charlie shows up with coffee, and by the time she does Dean has completely neglected all notes, and judging by the look she gives him, is smiling at his phone like a giddy little schoolgirl.
The dark-haired porn star’s face breaks out into a grin, “Oh, thanks. I didn’t realize you were working at the moment.” His eyes scan down Dean who’s clad in jeans that are ripped (and not in the trendy way) and a plaid button-down over a T-shirt.
The guy finally smiles, a little thing. “Well, don’t we have a lot in common.”
Dean gaped in disbelief, “Mornings?! When will I sleep?!”
Sam gapes at him. Then he turns to Dean to kick him back and glare, like Dean somehow lied to him.
The parade turns out to be pretty fun. Maybe because of the three vodka sodas Dean downed before going.
Then he follows the path back to the dock.
Even if he was at home, it would be much too late in the evening for uninvited drop-ins.
Dean rolls his eyes, “It’s just thesis work, Cas.”
“Well, I’m out of here, loverboys. See ya this weekend,” she grins at them while she walks backwards towards the exit where her friends usually hang out near the smoking area.
“Yes,” Dean says, voice a whisper, fingers white in tension against the shower wall.
“Yeah… Okay,” he mumbles and drapes his arm over his eyes. He has a headache.
“I don’t, jerk. I just know you’re really into him and, I don’t know, had a hard time reading him. Just… Did you figure out where you stand?” Sam shrugs.
“Uh, no it’s- I don’t care… What did you mean the last time I was here?” he asked stupidly.
“Lets play a drinking game!” he suggests a little too eagerly but he doesn’t even care. Dean is doing too well.
“I mean how I’m not gay,” Dean says. “And now I have a boyf- you.”
“Well, I disagree,” Dean said. “I want Bobby to be there.”
Because they love each other and make compromises and they fuck.
They go back up the stairs and Dean can barely refrain from taking Cas’ hand.
“Uh huh,” Mom said. The phone announced an incoming message.
“Dean, you’re an idiot. He doesn’t feel that way,” Charlie said.
Dean scrunches his nose up in disgust. Maybe his stupid trick with the hostess had worked a little too well, “Ew, no! Sam is my brother.”
Victor had asked if Dean was nervous about meeting Cas’ relatives. Dean had obviously answered “Why the fuck would I be nervous about that?” because who gets nervous about meeting friends’ family. Besides Dean
. And you motivate Sam. I don’t know your history but something tells me Sam wouldn’t be where he is if it wasn’t for you.” Castiel says in earnest and it should have been too much. Would have too.
Dean scoffs, “Please, Sam.”
“Dean,” Cas runs two fingers under Dean’s chin, making Dean face him. “I want you to move in with me.”
Dean brings them six shots of tequila and two rum and cokes, because that’s Cas’ drink of choice and Sam doesn’t have one. And then he’s off the clock.
“Yeah,” Ellen says from where she’s busy making pie at the counter, “Got a girlfriend?”
Charlie finishes typing, brow furrowed and the tip of her tongue stuck out between her lips in concentration.
Cas swallows, burst of confidence disappearing as fast at it had appeared, eyes sinking to his hands resting on the table, “I think I’d like to start with just the kisses.”
“You have to tell her,” the other cherub said.
Castiel nods towards the couple sucking faces, “We tried so hard and didn’t get anywhere.”
“Is he older than 25?” The doorman asks.
Dean blushes then. It had been a tipsy impulse Amazon purchase, and the best he’d ever made.
This morning is quiet. Dean is tapping along to the radio in the steering wheel but doesn’t attempt a conversation with Cas. They don’t talk till they’re already on the boat and Cas directs Dean as to where he wants to go today.
Castiel smiled at his antics, “Calm down. If you want, we could also practice Akkusativ?”
“I’ll have a tall Americano,” Castiel orders and hands the cashier a twenty-dollar bill, “And please let me pay for the next person in line.”
Sam rolls his eyes and Castiel asks, “Dean, when’s your follow-up interview?”
It’s Saturday and Dean had wanted to take Cas out for breakfast, but Cas had wanted to sleep in. They’d agreed on breakfast in bed.
“Oh no, I picked your lock,” Dean says, grinning as Castiel rolls his eyes.
Bobby finally joins in, “Who are you anyway?”
Castiel pulled his hand back and gaped at Dean. Dean turned towards the wheel, away from Cas.
“I know,” Dean mumbles.
Dean looks at the first page of the menu without reading anything for a moment, trying to calculate, “So how old are you?”
Castiel got up, folding his coat over his arm and slinging his bag over his shoulder, “I have to go.” And then he made for the exit despite Mrs. Barnes protests that study hall wasn’t over.
Cas follows Dean into the bathroom to spit and rinse. Dean is staring at the shower. But then, it is a nice shower. It’s big, roomy, with double glass doors, and two shower heads.
“I like gumbo,” Cas says, having never had gumbo.
Cas’ arm that’s resting across his waist. That almost makes the inferno under the covers worth it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean doesn’t actually intend to bring up their relationship until he’s a little less stressed about theses and due dates. He figures he can still hang out with Cas until he’s ready to talk about it though.
“Oh, come on. I think Cas knows it’s not like that.” He hopes so. He thinks he’s made it pretty clear.
More time passes and Sam starts getting fidgety. He has probably spent all day doing homework, the nerd, and now his brain is kaput and he’s bouncing his long-ass legs in Dean peripheral vision and playing solitaire.
Dean shrugged and looked back at the college student twirling a lock of hair around her finger.
“Dude!” Viktor exclaimed in a whisper, “You’re the

him a pair of pink satin panties for the next half hour.
Dean is watching Victor and Ketch play FIFA, waiting for his turn, when the doorbell goes upstairs. He doesn’t really think about it until Cas is coming down the stairs.
Dean groans, “I’m really not the parade kind of queer.”
When he finally meets Dean’s eye, Dean exclaims, “What the hell happened, man?”
The hotel is placed in between the nearest small town and the outskirts of the bayou. To phrase it differently, in the middle of nowhere. Cas can either walk 5 miles to the town to rent a car, or walk 3 to the dock and get started. Shouldn’t be a hard choice despite whatever creatures might be out there. He decides to take his chances.
Dean puts his knife and fork down, “Yeah, I just hope we can afford it.”
He wonders why he said those shitty things to him. He can’t find a single excuse and he just wants to call Cas and apologize and tell him that he’s sorry, he should have warned him that he’s poison, that he ruins everything he touches. Cas is better off without him.
The guy's grin widens and he has really full lips. Castiel does not understand what his life has turned into. Now he is reading social signals and
“What, no don’t be sorry. Work is work. You can just come with next time, it’s no problem.” Why is it so awkward when they both knew that Castiel was Jimmy Novak and they both knew, that they both knew.
Castiel shrugs and Dean takes the hint. The waitress can finally take their orders and soon after brings them their food.
“What happened?” Dean asked, before he could wonder if that was intrusive.
“Okay,” Cas says.
It isn’t till he turns that he sees that the next person in line
Dean rolled his eyes. They weren’t characters on the Little House on the Prairie. They didn’t
“Yeah, kinda,” he twirls the broom absentmindedly between his hands, “I’ve thought about quitting school.”
“Confetti cannon?”
“Okay.” Jack leaned back again, and he turned to look out of the window with a suppressed yawn.
“A good dad?” The hunter’s eyebrows rose up to his hairline.
“So, you don’t know what’s going on, either? Then I’m definitely calling the cops.” Jean had walked up behind them and was peaking over their shoulders.
“What’s he saying?” Theo asked, equally thrilled.
“Wow, this is so French Mistake,” Theo breathed out, almost laughing. “Seriously, how much did you drink? Are you some kind of impersonator?”
“Are you really sure they’d miss you?” Dean asked sourly as he rubbed at his reddened cheek.
“Let me get this straight,” her friend gave her an exhausted look and rubbed at his forehead. “You’d rather believe there’s an actual tv angel in Jean’s room than to consider that he’s some drugged up Supernatural superfan?”
“It means we have time,” the witch expounded. “The rift cannot close unless the main power source returns to its rightful owner.”
Cas. This wasn’t him. Sure, he looked like him. Same sharp features, same pink, slightly chapped lips, same deep, blue eyes. But the way the other man held himself, almost relaxed despite his own confusion at the situation he had found himself in. How he somehow didn’t quite fill out the battered trench coat he usually wore like a second skin. And the slightly higher, less gravelly pitch of his voice. Those weren’t Cas.
“These trousers feel a little constricting,” the angel said doubtfully as he looked down his legs. “But I would like something to put over this shirt, thank you.”
“This conversation seems ineffective to me,” Castiel deadpanned and the other three gave him apologetic smiles.
The witch looked over at Jack and then back to Dean. “In theory we’d need a tracker and a power source that is connected to your angel.”
“Well, we’re kinda responsible for what happened to him because we summoned him here. So, I feel like we owe it to him to at least
Dean was about to take a step towards him, anger already his prime modus operandi again. But Sam beat him to the punch as he rushed to Jack’s side.
“You can do this, Jack. Focus!”
In hope of distraction he eventually looked over at the actor, trying to get back into the conversation he was having with the kid. Instead of getting his head back into the moment, though, he started to scan the man’s face for all the little differences that set him apart from Cas. Very unlike Cas, Misha almost immediately reacted to the other man’s scrutiny.
“Jack?” Cas asked carefully.
Jack felt his grace gently tugging at his insides and tried to coax it into flowing out of his body, aiming at Cas and guiding it in the right direction with his hands. With his eyes closed he could still feel the bristling presence of the angel’s grace. For a split second he wasn’t sure if he was able to subdue something as ancient and magnificent as the concentrated mass of energy before him. If he actually had the grit to attack Cas. He didn’t know the extent of his powers, didn’t know what would happen if he slipped up just like Dean expected him to. Of course, he didn’t want to hurt Cas. But what if he still did?
Dean huffed sarcastically. “No idea, kid. Doesn’t matter as long as we get him back, does it?”
“Then… what kind of prank is this? Do you think… one of our team members maybe?” There was a slight spark of hope in his voice.
“What do you think, Mel?” he asked, grinning broadly.
“You could say that,” he answered with an uneasy smile. “How’d your date go?”
“What. The Hell. Was that? I mean, seriously! What the hell?” Theo was staring at Mel, asking the same question for the umpteenth time.
“Okay, listen. I’ll try to figure out what’s going on over there. You stay here and wait for me to come get you,” Dean decided and cocked his gun.
“But in that episode Misha was murdered and Sam and Dean
With a small smile on his lips Jack closed his eyes and tried to concentrate. Cas trusted him and that felt good. He didn’t want to disappoint him and so he took a deep breath and focused all his energy. Most of the times it had been easy for him to take out the ones who had threatened him or his friends. Just a burst of emotions, predominantly fear and anger, and it was done. But to basically disarm someone he loved without hurting them was different. That required a lot more willpower and control over his thoughts.
over the rush of blood in his ears. The angel’s grace had given in under the force of his own.
“Where am I?” he finally asked in a gravelly voice and managed to sit up straight.
because of that familiar face. Did he want to shine a light on that very dark, unsafe corner of his mind? Still, not the right time. Probably never the right time.
“I’m not. Jensen. My name is Dean Winchester, this is Jack and we really need to find Cas. Sam and Rowena are waiting on the other side of that rift.” He pointed behind them to the only actual proof they had.
“Well,” the actor crossed his arms over his chest and pursed his lips in consideration. “I’d never turn down a soul in need. And I guess I could make sure that you stop bullying the poor kid.” He actually had the audacity to pinch Dean’s cheek to underline his words. It didn’t escape Dean how Jack was trying to suppress a giggle at that. “But I’d have to be back on set the morning on the day after tomorrow.”
“Hey,
“That’s too bad,” the boy mused, more to himself than the others. “I think he would be very good at being married.”
“I still don’t get how this is good news. Okay, so maybe it’s not a bad thing we have more time than expected. But Cas is still somewhere without his grace and hasn’t returned on his own. If he was alright, he could’ve just walked right back through that rift. He didn’t. Which means something’s wrong.” Dean ruffled his hair, clearly more worried than angry now.
“Jesus, Theo! Do you even hear yourself?” Mel almost laughed. “That’s the dumbest thing you’ve ever said. Why should he put Jensen on the phone? To prank
“Mel,” Jean tried to reason, “there’s a man in my room who looks like one of the dudes from your stupid show. Neither one of us knows how he got in or what he’s doing here. Frankly, I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to rob us yet. Probably just a matter of time, though. He’s clearly a psychopath.”
“Nah, those jeans look great on you. You’ll get used to them,” Jean said while looking him up and down, unabashedly appreciative. For a second there she almost seemed to forget all about her reservations towards him. Meanwhile, Mel had run off again, raiding Theo’s closet once more.
“Let’s get to it, then,” the witch agreed, rubbing her hands in shameless excitement.
“Just brainstorming on how to get this angel man back to his own reality,” Jean shrugged, almost pulling off nonchalant. “I guess this is going to be tricky.”
? You really think Misha, Jensen and Alex would drive down here just to mess with some random fans? Seems like a massive waste of time and resources.”
“I’m good,” Dean replied.
way,” Dean replied stubbornly.
They had spent the better part of the last hour cleaning up the backyard where they'd tried to shoot their video and carrying their equipment up to their shared apartment. Jean, their other roommate, was fortunately not home yet. She wasn’t usually as forgiving with their shenanigans as most of their other friends were, and she probably would have thought that the power outage and the racket outside had been their fault. How they would have been supposed to cause an earthquake, though… Jean would’ve found a way to hold them accountable for that, anyway.
Dean gripped both his thighs very hard at the dangerous turn the conversation was taking. They both seemed to be out to make him as uncomfortable as possible. He couldn’t really blame the kid, he looked just too damn innocent to know what he was doing. But Misha’s intentions were a whole different story. The hunter prided himself with being pretty good at reading people. It came with the job. This guy was an actor, though. His profession literally
“You too!?” The man exclaimed, almost as in shock at the appearance of another person.
“Yeah, so?”
who’d appreciate some of my choices. And anyway, I did pick some simple, nondescript shirts, too.”
“It appears so,” Rowena nodded. “But before you get your knickers in a twist, this is good news.”
The older Winchester didn’t quite grasp what he was seeing at first.
“Erm…” Jack cleared his throat, obviously trying to dissolve the tension between the other two. “Sam is married?”
“What, you mean that thing,” Dean waved at the rift, “is Cas’ grace?”
“Where are we and why are you here?” Better start off simple.
Just when Sam wanted to challenge her on that, a soft groan came from the library and they collectively turned their heads to see Jack finally waking up. He slowly raised his head from the back of the chair where it had been resting for close to three hours, and blinked, clearly confused when he found the two hunters and the witch staring at him.
,” he snapped back as Sam covertly rolled his eyes at him.
First of all, happy new year (hopefully)! Hope you're all well and safe.
“Like what you see?” he teased easily and winked at Dean.
“I’m not tired,” Jack replied with an almost defiant pout.
“Exactly. What if we cross over and the rift closes before we can go back?” One glance at his brother’s face told him everything he needed to know, though, maybe more. Failure wasn’t an option. They’d lost the angel too many times already, and each time it had been harder to come back from it. Especially for his brother. The next time might very well be the last. He exhaled heavily before slowly nodding. “You’re right, we need Jack.”
“Well, there was a reason I did not immediately answer my phone when you called, you know? I was
“It’s a very messy place on the internet where fans come to gather and that’s all you need to know,” Mel quickly explained and gave Theo a disapproving look. “Don’t corrupt the angel.”
“I just knew something like this would happen,” Dean growled and knelt down beside Cas who was on all fours by then, pointedly not looking at Dean. Instead his eyes were fixed on Jack.
“Can you help?” Sam asked, passing over her comment. “We need to know what’s on the other side before we can cross over.”
Dean stopped in his tracks and looked at his brother with narrowed eyes and his lips pressed together in a thin line. His hand went up to his face again and he tried to smooth out some of the tension. Then he took a deep breath and glanced over at the unconscious nephilim.
“When do we leave?” Jack butted in, finally getting out of the chair.
No one dared to speak for a long moment before Mel slowly nodded. “Yes?”
“I did mention that it was kinda complicated? And anyway, two men
“Fans are weird. Just the thought of them gives me the creeps,” he just said and looked out the window.
“Yes. That part is still unclear to me.” The man nodded at her.
“No!” Mel suddenly decided.
“Ask him for a phone number!” Jean offered, obviously with the need to be helpful. “Talking to your friends would confirm it all, right?”
“I don’t think so. I mean… how should they have done
“Now, now, that’s no way of greeting your favorite witch,” Rowena scolded him with a crooked grin, gracefully descendeding the stairs.

had never been part of their job description. Like, ever.
him into this mess of a universe.”
“Are you… Misha?” Mel had turned her attention back to him in something akin to reverence.
“I don’t know, Mel,” Theo jumped in. “I think Jean’s right.”
“He had to put you back together on a molecular level. In doing so he weaved his very essence into your soul and forged a bond between you two. In a way, you’re carrying a piece of your angel in you.” She gave Dean a minute wink, not missing how he’d instantly and profusely started to blush.
“Jack, what is happening?” Cas tried to stay calm, but Jack’s grace was getting out of control and beginning to take a hold of his.
The rift. Yes. There it was, in the middle of the room, and seemingly still a big temptation to Dean. Every time he was close to it and thought Sam wasn’t looking, he stole torn glances at it. Although he had eventually agreed that crossing over without knowing what was on the other side was a colossally stupid idea, it didn’t mean that his pigheadedness wasn’t still fighting for the upper hand. He felt himself being pulled towards the tear in their reality, but he had promised. He didn’t have to like it, though.
“Thank you!” Jean sighed in relief.
“Ready?” Theo asked and took a swift look at their electronics. “Lights?”
“No,” she replied immediately, obviously shocked by her own firmness. “I will not leave you two alone with him. I’m a part of this now, like it or not. Maybe having at least
“Now, can we please see that picture you were talking about?” Dean asked, forcing himself to calm down.
“Well, that’s it. I’ve tried every way I know to reach Rowena. Nothing,” Sam announced in defeat and put his phone down on the table. “We can only hope that she calls back.”
“Shit, pal,” Dean almost laughed. “You love them, got it. And they also pay your bills, which must be a nice side effect.”
“Oh! Yes! I’ll put them by the bathroom door. You can just choose whatever fits you the best.” Quickly she hurried into the hallway to bring Castiel her selection from Theo’s wardrobe. “This is gonna be fun,” she added as an aside and winked at her friends.
“Yeah, but it’s a prop. I can’t just steal props from set. Could’ve lost my job over that. They would’ve informed the police and put out an APB on the car which isn’t exactly a low-profile vehicle. Plus, they would’ve known it was me because my car would still be on the property.” Misha rambled on until Dean put his hands up in defeat.
“Okay,” Dean yawned and closed his eyes.
“I cannot be sure,” she offered and gently laid a hand on the nephilim’s head. “But it seems like your wee boy here cracked open that rift and your angel’s grace is keeping it open. Imagine being shoved through a hole that is too small for you to fit through. Something will be scraped off you and stay behind.”
A couple of hours later, Dean heard the bell ring just as he was pulling a tray of mince pies from the oven. He set them down and went to get the door. Cas stepped inside and immediately hugged him. It felt even better than Dean’s dumb airport fantasies because it was real. Cas was warm and solid in his arms. Well, he’d just come in from the cold, so he was a little chilly and solid in Dean’s arms, but it felt like he was right where he belonged. He gave Cas a squeeze before letting go.
The guy was just in a black tee and dark jeans, but he looked amazing in the simple outfit. The colourful tattoos on his arms stood out against the plain clothes. He was sporting an undercut, his hair messy where it was longer on top. Dean couldn’t tell what colour his eyes were, but even from this distance, they looked intense.
so a lot of the videos are pretty macabre. Anyway, she had this video about
“Well, Castiel, excuse me if I don’t take your word for this whole thing.” He waved a hand between them, in obvious dismissal of their relationship.
“It’s a shipping container,” Dean insisted.
Cas tuned back into the conversation to hear them talking about footwear as they walked over to the couch.
They drove in silence for a while apart from Cas humming along off-key to the song. Spotify must be playing the album or song radio or something, because the music segued straight into Shake It Off next. Dean found his fingers tapping on the steering wheel a little. Okay, he could admit that he thought this one was catchy, but it was probably only because Charlie had played him the Screaming Females version of the song and that was actually pretty good. It didn’t count as liking a Taylor Swift song if you just liked the rock cover of it, right? Yeah, that was fine.
“Teardrop tattoos only mean you’ve killed someone if you’re in a West Coast gang,” he answered seriously. “And even then, only if they’re not drawn on in eyeliner,” he finished with a slight quirk of his lips.
Ok. Have a nice day Cas
“I don't bottom,” Cas broke away from the kiss to say.
Dean laughed. “No, think Kalinda, not Alicia.”
of course I’m still into Xena! Watching
As nice as throwing his own Thanksgiving had been, in its own way, nothing beat being home for the holidays. Rufus, Sam and Dean’s other honorary grumpy uncle, always came over on Christmas day. He was Jewish, so he didn’t technically celebrate Christmas, but he’d been persuaded to spend it with the gentiles anyway because they didn’t want Rufus to be alone on a holiday. Besides, it wasn’t like the rest of them were practising Christians anyway. The holiday was just about family and food to the Winchester-Singer-Harvelle clan. Rufus was the former and appreciated the latter. And presents, it was about presents too.
“I’ll be right back,” Dean said, jumping up from the table.
There was a small patch of wildflowers outside the bunker’s entrance, so it was entirely possible that the honey might be made from nectar from those flowers. Even if it didn’t seem very likely, the thought seemed to please Cas who was smiling slightly at the jar.
“Jesus, Charlie, are you trying to give me a heart attack?” Dean yelped as he turned to face her, a hand clutched over his chest.
The day had been just as much fun as it was every year. Dean had helped Ellen cook up a feast of roast beef, mashed potatoes, gravy and various side dishes. Then he’d taken over the kitchen to make a metric shit-ton of mince pies.
“I didn’t watch TV growing up,” Cas said with a shrug. “I have gaps in my knowledge in some places and know a lot about other things I’ve watched and read since I left home. Have you heard of Gay Bob?”
They laughed and relaxed and ended up having to start the next episode from the beginning when they realised they’d spent the whole of it lazily making out on the couch instead of watching the show. The atmosphere was easy and light. It felt like they’d recovered from the earlier darkness of talking about their childhoods.
“I know you like things spicy,” Dean said and instantly regretted his phrasing when Sam snickered. He threw a ball of crumpled up wrapping paper at his head.
Dean was more than happy to agree to that. Family was the most important thing to him and he wanted more of these meals shared with his boyfriend and his brother... and Gabriel too, he supposed. He might be kind of a dick—Dean wasn’t quite ready to let him off the hook for leaving Cas and he wasn’t yet convinced that he was good enough for Sam, but he made Cas happy and he made Sam happy and that was all Dean really cared about.
Cas looked down at his phone where the latest messages from Dean were on the screen.
Cas sent back a string of emojis which Dean took to mean Cas was excited about seeing him too.
Dean smiled at him, settled back into the chair and took a sip of his coffee. Meg walked out of her room and made a beeline to the French press and empty mug on the table.
Well, he was comfortable apart from when it came to breaking the ice with a hot guy, then he reverted back to being fifteen and feeling like he was doing something he shouldn't be. It was an automatic reaction, the old anxiety bubbling up when he approached a guy or they approached him. Then he was fucking awkwardly bisexual.
“Exactly, I distract the enemy with my epic tits and no one will try to stab me in the gut.”
Dean heard him grunt as his own orgasm hit him. They were quiet for a while then, just listening to each other's breathing as they shared an afterglow from across the country. He felt both closer to Cas and further away. Dean wasn't flying back until the second and that felt like far too long to go without seeing him.
“So you do know him?”
“Of course!”
He led Dean to the gallery that housed Warhol’s
“Gorram straight!” Charlie agreed happily.
“The detective with the moustache?” Dean asked, thoroughly confused.
“Expand your horizons—there's music made after the eighties, you know!”
“You ever watch
“Shit, sweetheart, that sounds terrible. Come here,” Dean said, crossing the few inches of couch between them and pulling Cas into a hug. “Weirdly, I kind of relate.”
He insisted it was impossible to play ‘good cop’ when you weren’t actually a cop. Real cops could offer to go easy on people or cut them a deal. Being a ‘good cop’ when you were interviewing someone as a PI just meant asking them real nice to tell you the truth and nodding sympathetically at everything they said.
Despite the insular nature of the Church, some of the other teenagers had tried to maintain a normal social life and snuck out to the occasional gathering with their heathen classmates but never Castiel. He hadn’t seen himself as a rebel. He was a good son. He followed his father’s wishes, his father’s orders, until he couldn’t any longer, until he realised how very little his father cared for him, until he was condemned and forsaken. Only then did he truly rebel and only when he had finally tasted freedom did he wish he had done it sooner.
“Yeah?”
Cas insisted on cooking for them. Dean wasn’t sure of the wisdom of letting the guy with a limited ability to taste be the one in charge of Christmas dinner, but Cas had been so enthusiastic that Dean didn’t have the heart to say anything. He would eat whatever monstrosity Cas served up and be grateful for it. Dean suspected that Cas had been reading cooking blogs again and was eager to try out something he’d found. Cas was a master of research, whether it was tracking down information about esoteric occult lore or finding the best Christmas recipes. He was fascinated by the vast amount of knowledge on the internet and excited by the fact that he could learn almost anything by googling it. Food seemed to be his latest obsession. He’d yet to find a blog that specialised in recommending food for angels living on earth- even the most obscure corners of the internet didn’t have anything like that. But he’d found a number of blogs that focused on dessert and others that were predominately recipes for spicy cuisine that he liked.
Dean gazed about the tunnel in wonder as they walked through. When they came out the other side, he turned to look back before they continued on.
Dean stretched out in the armchair and put his feet up on the coffee table too. It was his coffee table, after all, so there was no one to tell him not to. Maybe it should feel silly, sitting there in a lady’s jacket that he’d sewn a cock ring onto, but it didn’t, not with Charlie there, sitting on his sofa in full costumed regalia like it was a throne.
“I want you naked.”
back on because it was obvious Cas didn’t want to talk anymore and
Dean could go without sleep for a week straight and he still wouldn’t be too tired to see Cas.
“Hmmm, I still kinda would have liked to punch him, but not bad.” He took Cas’s hand again. “So how about that drink?”
after all these years of living among humans- had difficulty interpreting facial expressions. He desperately wished he knew what Dean was thinking right now.
“But you took the car!”
“It’s okay. You’re okay.”
Dean laid down and pulled Cas atop him. The weight of the other man felt like the only thing anchoring him to this world. Reality was solely made up of the two of them. They kissed languidly for a long time, lips meeting sweetly, taking soft slow licks into each other's mouths. Cas’s hands moved in his hair, stroked down Dean’s sides, rasped against the stubble on his cheeks. Dean’s hands just stayed on Cas’s back, clinging to him tightly. He couldn’t seem to release his hold on Cas’s trench coat. He didn’t ever want to let him go. Cas broke the kiss for a moment to look at Dean, to look inside him. Dean rubbed the side of his face against him, like a cat marking him with his scent.
“He wasn’t supposed to call. He was just supposed to come,” Cas said softly, not meeting his eyes.
“I’m sorry. I just...”
Cas spread lube over both their cocks and jacked them together as he kissed him. Dean ran his hands across Cas’s body, up his back, down his ass, over his thighs, touching anywhere he could reach as they kissed and kissed and kissed. Eventually, Dean’s hand joined Cas’s between their bodies. He rubbed his palm over the heads of their cocks as Cas worked their shafts. Cas groaned against his mouth at the increased stimulation.
She went over to the desk in the corner to sketch. Cas checked over the ink bottles on the table next to him as he got ready to start tattooing. Nobody said anything for a while until the music changed to a song by The Muslims.
“Well, you’re definitely
“So, you're...."
“You can’t leave-”
“Okay, I think the music is throwing you off. Let me set the ambience properly,” he said, digging his phone out of his pocket and opening the Spotify app to change the music playing over the speakers.
A string of cheese stretched out between his mouth and the slice, eventually snapping and falling down to slap Cas’s chin. He used a finger to poke the rest of the cheese into his mouth with as much dignity as he could manage. Dean watched him smiling until he remembered Cas had asked him a question.
Not that it had taken much effort. He’d bought the lilac mesh t-shirt online, found a cheap, lavender lady’s leather jacket on eBay, unpicked the stitching round the shoulder seams to make it sleeveless and then added pink stitching to an old pair of black jeans to match Ken’s pants. And, most importantly, brought two chrome cock rings from a sex shop. He’d sewn one onto the flap of the pocket at waist height on the left side of the jacket and attached the other to a silver chain to wear as a necklace.
“That’s beautiful, Cas.”
“You’re worth more than all of creation to me, Dean. I would die a thousand times for you.”
“Not that girl you’re seeing? You’re just starting out at that firm. It’s not the best time to start a family too, you know.”
have you got a fucking hard on?! Not cool, seriously, not cool. Now is definitely not the time for
‘I’m free tonight,’ Cas typed before he could talk himself out of it. He felt both guilty and glad when Dean replied to his text straight away.
Chuck Shurley had been an expert in spoon-feeding people hate and, as a child, Cas had swallowed it up because he hadn’t known anything else. It was only when he was older that he understood how despicable his father’s views were. So, Cas knew what it was like to want to distance yourself from the bigotry and hatred you’d been brought up in when you realised just how abhorrent that mindset was. He wanted to have faith in the innate goodness of humanity, to hope that even people who had once believed vile things could be redeemed. Second chances and new beginnings were important to him.
It was sacrilegious, that’s what it was.
“Whatever, sex toy attire suits you.”
“It tastes like love,” Cas told him.
“Yes, our father was good at making me hate myself too,” Cas said and shifted slightly out of Dean’s hug to sit more comfortably on the sofa. He pulled his legs up under him, put his head on Dean’s shoulder, and wrapped one arm around his waist.
Cas laughed at him. He knew he was being deliberately absurd just to lighten the mood. “You’re ridiculous,” he told Dean.
again,” he said in a very quiet voice.
"Well, I figured I ought to do it right. This might be my outfit for many Pride parades to come. It's got the whole get-up—the cock ring, the backup cock ring in case your partner didn't bring his own.”
“I’m going to suck your cock now,” Cas told him in a tone that brooked no argument.
Dean had shaken off his own shock then and fought back, landing a powerful right hook straight to John’s mouth. He’d laughed while rubbing his jaw and said he was surprised that a fag like Dean could throw a punch. Dean had squared his shoulders and waited for more blows to fall, but John just gave another derisive laugh and slumped back down on the sagging couch to finish his beer.
Both Dean and I feel bad for how he treated Cas, so read on for how Dean tries to make it up to him.
It was wrapped in silver paper decorated with bright sprigs of mistletoe, which made Dean smile. Looked like he wasn’t the only one with fond memories of the mistletoe incident. Two pieces of wrapping paper had been put on either side of the largish box and haphazardly folded over. The whole thing had then been wrapped a dozen times in tape going both lengthwise and widthwise around the box. It was a very thorough job and looked impossible to get into. Luckily, Dean had put his boots on earlier, so he had his trusty boot knife. A hunter should never go anywhere without a knife as far as he was concerned, even if he was only going to open presents apparently. Carefully, he sliced away the tape to get to the gift underneath. It was a colourful box covered in foamy mugs of beer. Bold black letters declared it to be a Brew Your Own Beer Kit from Family Business Beer Co.
Bobby came to the airport to pick Dean up when he flew home for Christmas. Jo surprised him by tagging along and yelling, “Hey, loser!” at him across the airport arrivals area. It was her version of ‘welcome home’. Dean gave Bobby a warm, back-slapping hug when he reached them. Then lifted Jo off her feet when he swept her into a bear hug.
Dean was glad he had Charlie to keep his mind off things. He was always emotional on the flight back to San Francisco. His anxiety was always sky high—pun not intended because he was too anxious to appreciate puns right now—but on top of that, he usually felt a little down. It made him sad to be leaving Kansas behind, even though he was happy to go back to California where he had a job he enjoyed, an awesome apartment and great friends.
“I'm not like you. I can't just go to the bar and pick up some strange woman.” Cas looked mortified by the thought.
“Now, Dean,
Meg made a thoughtful noise and started rummaging through her makeup bag where it was sitting on the side table. She turned back and grabbed Cas’s chin.
Dean leant against the railing of the wooden porch shivering slightly. He was insufficiently dressed for the crisp morning air but he didn’t want to go back inside. The angel would be there, looking at him like he’d personally cancelled Christmas, kicked his puppy and stolen his candy. He glared at the phone in his hand. Sam still wasn’t answering. He’d convinced Castiel to let him out of his sight for five damn minutes so he could speak to Sam alone but his stupid brother wasn’t cooperating. He tucked the cell into the flimsy pocket of his pyjama pants and looked out across the vista before him. It was nice actually. The kind of place where Dean could imagine taking a quiet weekend away, as long as he’d double checked the surrounding woods for wendigos first. The cabin sat in a little clearing in the forest. He could see a small lake through the trees, the water looked clear and calm. There was slightly muddy ground out front and a patch of tall grass with wildflowers. And, off to the side, there was Baby, sitting at the end of a dirt track. The track presumably led around the back of the cabin to join a road somewhere, so there was an escape route if need be. Dean glanced back at the cabin, he didn’t see the angel watching to him, so he strode over to the Impala and tried the door. Unlocked, and when he pulled down the sun visor, the keys fell out. He pocketed them, just in case. He looked back at the window, still empty, so he took a quick gander under the hood, everything seemed to be in working order. He sat down in the front seat of the Impala and tried Sam again.
“Leather daddy?” Cas asked, face burning.
It was the first time John had hit Sam. Dean usually bore the brunt of his anger, but they couldn't stay there if Sam was going to be a target now too. He’d waited until John had passed out in a drunken stupor, then Dean had stuffed what little they had into their duffels and hustled Sam out of the crappy short-term let apartment they’d been staying at for the last few months. They’d gone straight to Bobby’s, hitchhiking across two states back to Kansas to find somewhere Dean could be sure Sam would be safe.
“Both, please,” Dean groaned. He was still holding his cell phone clenched in his right hand, but his left hand had started running up and down his chest without conscious thought.
The cheesy pop music had faded far into the background and all Dean could hear was the sound of his own heart thudding in his ears. His brain felt staticky and his fingers vaguely tingly. He leant across the table and placed a chaste kiss on Cas's lips. At least that was what he planned, just a light touch, a promise for more, later, when they're alone. But he couldn’t help opening his mouth a little, sliding his tongue between Cas's lips, just for a taste, a tiny taste... He could taste the damn stupid cocktail he’d brought him and he could taste something even sweeter that he suspected was just Cas. It wasn’t long before he felt drunk on the kiss and barely holding onto control. When he realised he'd dragged Cas halfway across the table, he let go of him and fell back into his seat. Breathing heavily, he stared at Cas’s dazed face.
Dean was pretty sure that Cas liked the possessive implications that coating Dean in his come had because he stared down at the mess he’d made for a long time. Cas ran his fingers through the small pool that had settled in the crease of Dean’s hip, massaging gently like he was trying to rub it into Dean’s skin.
It had happened almost every day at first. Cas saw him in the busy corridors at school, the pew in front of his at church, walking down the streets that Cas had walked with him so often. It was like his ghost was haunting all the places they’d been together, all the places Cas still expected to see him but never would again.
“Really?”
“Aw, bro, you’ve heard of it.” Gabriel grinned at him. He looked proud, but Dean wasn’t sure if he was proud of the TV show he produced or just proud that Cas watched TV now.
“Dean... Dean, I need you,” he whimpered, looking absolutely helpless under the force of his lust, unsure what to do with feelings stronger than anything he'd experienced before, confused by unfamiliar urges.
“But I’ve put the gang life behind me now. Straightened up and flew right. Became the upstanding member of society you see before you today,” Dean finished with a flourish, gesturing to himself.
They’d been in the air for a while, so Dean figured they were probably over Colorado when Charlie turned to him and said, “Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.”
Despite Meg assuring him that he wasn’t as bad with people as he thought, social interactions weren't always easy for Cas. While he’d gotten better over the years, those hard-won social skills seemed to abandon him when he was stressed. It wasn’t as bad as last week, but, still, he didn’t feel up to manning reception right now.
“Uh, uh, uh,” she said, wagging her finger at him. She turned away for a moment to grab something from the side table next to the couch and fiddled with her hair. When she turned back, she was wearing a pair of small, sparkly-red devil horns clipped into her dark waves. Cas huffed a short, begrudging laugh at the sight.
“The bar where Cas and me-” -fucked in the parking lot- “-got together.”
Dean stepped back and struck the same robot pose he had with Charlie, arms held stiffly, wide grin on his face.
It had only been a week since Dean had told him that for the first time and he was pretty sure they were in triple digits of him saying it now. Maybe the novelty would wear off and Dean wouldn't feel the need to tell him at least a dozen times a day, maybe just half a dozen, but he doubted it. He damn well wanted Cas to know how much he was loved. If anyone deserved to hear they were loved ridiculously often, it was him. Cas smiled the smile he got on his face every time Dean told him he loved him. And Dean couldn’t take his eyes off him. He felt like he could spend the rest of forever just looking at this man.
bad.  Besides, Sam had no one but himself to blame for putting the mistletoe there in the first place. Unsurprisingly, the decoration was gone later that day. The mistletoe had reappeared the next day. This time it was over Dean’s doorframe,
but he seemed absolutely captivated by the
“Yeah, yeah, you’re hilarious and we’re leaving. Why don’t you try to find that guy you were eye-fucking earlier and see if you can get your own bathroom blowjob?”
“Why is this one in a spacesuit?” Dean asked.
Dean’s most constant companion as a child, apart from Sam, had been his favourite TV shows. John was hardly home, when they had one, and had been more than happy to leave his kids to be raised by the television. As they travelled more and more, there hadn’t been much else to do when he and Sam had been left alone in motel rooms in towns where they didn’t know anyone and had no money to go out.
“Isn’t that the ‘thou shalt not lie with another man’ part of the Bible?”
Cas called them into the kitchen not long after the movie ended. He was standing next to the table looking both nervous and hesitantly proud. There was an impressive spread laid out with the beautifully cooked, lovingly made turducken at the centre, surrounded by all the trimmings. There were roast vegetables, mashed potatoes and gravy that Dean suspected was made from scratch.
“You mentioned how much you liked the microbrew you had when you were hunting a shojo at that brewery. I thought you might like to make your own, so Sam helped me find the kit online.”
Meg watched him thoughtfully across the table. Studying his face, he assumed, for signs that he was spiralling again. Presumably, she found none since she nodded approvingly, like she was giving his plans the green light. While Cas welcomed the distraction sketching provided, he didn’t feel the same desperate need to bury himself in that distraction that he’d been feeling all week. He thought Meg had picked up on the change. She always did see right through him.
“We have forever,” Cas promised.
They turned away from the hot but taken women and scanned the room again.
“I am not obligated to do something just because Beyoncé says so!” Dean objected.
been given to him by the captain of the wrestling team. It had been more in the vein of a courting gift, though, or what passed as an attempt at seduction between horny fifteen-year-olds. A ‘look at these hot naked guys, wanna get naked with me sometime?’ kind of thing.
“I know, Dean, I know.”
“I can just give you his number if you want?”
right there beside Cas, until he turned to see someone else. Or he’d catch a glimpse of a familiar set of shoulders on a man sauntering down the street. That was all too common early on.
“No, I mean, not really,” Sam said evasively.
Dean looked at him curiously and said, “Don’t get me wrong, it’s hot, but why do you always act like my come is fucking delicious?”
“You keep calling him a twink.”
“You need some sparkle. Be glad I only put a bit of makeup on you and didn’t insist on shoving wings and a halo on you like I wanted to.” She pinched his cheek below the teardrop. “You’d look so pretty with feathers, Clarence.”
Race hadn’t been a focus of the Church he’d been raised in but hate certainly had been. He understood what it was like to grow up stewing in hatred, how that poison could seep into you when you were surrounded by it.
“The last time I didn’t bring lube when you were recovering, you told me very firmly that you were an adult and if you still wanted to fuck with a broken arm, then it was up to you.”
“That’s quite alright. It was entirely our fault for just standing here. I apologise,” Cas said politely.
“Jesse!”
“A couple of hours?” he said, looking a little put out. Cas the contradiction. Normally, had the patience to sit or stand still for hours. Who knew, maybe he’d even stood still for years when he’d been an angel stationed on earth watching over humanity. Dean wouldn’t put it past him. But sometimes he was like a little kid on a road trip, getting all cranky about being stuck in the car. Dean didn’t think they had any place better to be than in Baby listening to Zep, but he understood that regular human travel might seem slow to an angel who could teleport anywhere in an instant.
“I better get going,” Sam said eventually. “I have court tomorrow and I need to prepare.”
“Of course I remember Sam! Why wouldn’t I?”
He remembered reading an article that said that the rippling façade was inspired by the mists and waters of San Francisco Bay, but, to Cas, the crinkled lines covering the white walls made it look like a giant wasp nest with windows. Either way, it stood out amongst the looming silhouettes of the tall steel and glass buildings around it.
“I’m sorry,” Cas said sadly. “If I had realised the spell would mess with your head like this- if I’d have known what it actually did- I would have left you with Sam and gone to hunt the witch myself. I never meant to cause you distress.”
He was even hotter this close up.
There was a moment when nothing happened, like Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff and floating in mid-air for a second, then, as a family, they’d looked down and plummeted to the ground and shattered.
“You got a sweet tooth, huh?” the bartender asked, grinning at him.
“Well, you know what they say—if the cock ring fits, wear it!”
John Winchester had moved them all over the country because he couldn’t stand to stay in one place after his wife died. They’d go from state to state as John chased one get rich quick scheme after another. None of them worked, so he mostly lived off money from credit card scams and moved them frequently so the cops wouldn’t catch on to his cons. John was always more interested in his next ‘job’ than his own sons.
“Right.” Dean clapped his hands once, then rubbed them together thoughtfully. “Why don’t you sit down and I’ll get us some drinks. They’ve got whiskey here like any other bar.”
“I think I’m just going to sketch for a while. I haven't finished the design for my first appointment tomorrow.”
Eventually, Cas said, “I need to go clean up. I’ll see you when you get home, okay?”
“Good. He was really supportive.”
so much it almost hurt. Dean grabbed Cas and pulled him back into a fierce kiss.
“Don’t push it.”
He took a tentative bite as he finished his inner pep talk.
“Try to be on time, Alfie, or you’ll find yourself working back at Wiener Hut,” Meg snarked, before walking away.
“That is not what they say!” he sputtered through his laughter.
“Okay, that sounds even darker than I thought it’d be based on the freaky drawing of snakes.”
“It’s inspired by
Cas lay there, feeling raw and dirty, not good dirty, but the cheap & used kind of dirty. He listened to the sound of water in the next room. Dean was hogging the shower and it didn’t seem like he was invited, so he cleaned himself in the blink of an eye with his angelic powers. That way he only felt grimy on the inside.
“—insofar as the artist didn't necessarily have a specific meaning in mind when they painted them. Even when the artist very clearly had a meaning in mind, it's not necessarily the meaning other people interpret the work to have. Maybe that undercuts the idea that it means anything at all, but I think there's something beautiful about everyone getting to decide what art or books or TV shows mean to them—even when the story is written, you can write your own ending, you know?” Cas finished passionately.
CW- Mentions of child abuse/violence.
Got to go. My client just arrived.
“You’re not helping, Sam,” Charlie chimed in from Dean’s other side.
Cas couldn’t see Dean gesturing, but he felt the movement of the air and assumed he was motioning for them to exit the container. He took comfort from the fact that the stranger couldn’t see what they’d been doing and Dean couldn’t see his blush. Something about Dean just eroded his self-control.
Dean and Cas sat back down to wait for someone to realise they wanted to leave. Dean kept trying to catch the creepy waiter's eye. Ugh, he was pretty sure he’d already caught the creepy waiter’s eye, but he was trying to communicate using his gaze that he wanted the bill. If it went on much longer, he was going to start miming writing a check when the waiter looked over at them and, dear lord, he did not want to be the obnoxious douche that mimed writing a check when they wanted the bill.
“I know you said you only wanted me for Christmas,” Cas said to Dean softly, “but since you already have me, I got you something else too.”
“Ha, I knew it!” Dean interrupted triumphantly.
It wasn’t that Dean didn’t top- he would enthusiastically take either part when they fucked- it was just that Dean
“I know,” Dean replied, turning away from Sam to roll his eyes at Cas in a you-see-what-I-have-to-put-up-with gesture.
“What do you think?” Cas whispered.
And what kind of lesbian nerd would I be if I didn't write Xabby fanfic as a teenager?!”
“Come to bed.”
“I was a twink when I was his age,” Cas said shrugging. He didn’t have anything against the term. He’d been skinny, boyish and very gay when he met Meg at eighteen. The term fit. “But he’s not gay and I think he feels like you’re mocking him when you call him that.” Cas lowered his voice, not wanting to be overheard. “He’s not the most macho guy. Maybe he was bullied about it at school. And you know how teenagers are, calling people gay like it’s the worst insult they can think of.”
Undeterred, the drunk guy took a clumsy swing at Dean which he easily dodged. Dean stepped back instead of forward but he couldn’t help clenching his fists, unsure if it was in anger or preparation for a swing of his own. Cas put a hand on his shoulder. It was a light touch, meant to comfort not restrain. Dean could restrain himself. There’d been a time when that wouldn’t have been true, but he had actually matured, as unconvinced as Sammy was of that fact. He probably would have hit the intolerant asshole in his younger days, especially if he was with a guy he thought might enjoy having his honour defended. While punching him would be satisfying, it wouldn’t be a fair fight. He was a hunter, it was never a fair fight unless the homophobe happened to be a Navy SEAL. Besides, he didn’t want to end a nice day with his husband by getting into a brawl. He wasn’t sure if he was going to have a choice though because the other man took a threatening, if wobbly, step towards them. Cas reached out and touched the guy’s forehead, causing him to fall back and look dazed. Dean watched bemused as the man wandered away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck!”
“Shut up, Sam!”
Bobby proceeded to ask Dean a bunch of fatherly questions about how it was going. The answer to all of them could pretty much be summed up with,
“No TV, remember?”
“But you love me anyway.” Meg winked at him and started shoving paint cans into his arms.
“Come on, lazy bones. Sam’s up and about, so it’s time for presents.”
“Wait... what... where do the snakes come in?”
But he was also just a man who knew what he wanted and what he wanted was to enjoy one of the few gay club nights that played music he liked, in the main room anyway.
“I know you ain’t gonna get pregnant, boy. Don't mean I don’t worry about you being careless with some girl.”
“It's Winchester,” Dean said and Cas frowned at him, unimpressed. “Just, uh, FYI.”
Cas finished the eggs, even though they were cold and rubbery, because the food felt like a peace offering from Dean this time. He appreciated the effort, but the eggs felt like they were sitting in a hard lump low in his belly and somehow, simultaneously, like they were obstructing his throat so he couldn’t take a full breath. Dean kept flashing him concerned looks across the table. Repentant Dean might actually be worse than remorseless Dean. There was something so impersonal about his regret. It felt like he was the kind of sorry you were when you broke a co-worker's coffee mug, rather than the kind of sorry you were when you broke your husband’s heart. This awkward solicitude was cutting deeper than the earlier disdain. He had to get out of there.
He pulled his bulky brown leather jacket on. Partly because its loose cut meant it fit over the first jacket easily and partly as a bit of a fuck you, because it was his dad's old jacket and, boy, would he hate it being worn with this gay ensemble.
“Trust, trust?! You shouldn’t trust me and why the hell would I trust you?”
I don’t think it worked.
“Really, Meg?” Cas asked as he flopped back on the couch.
Two days later, Dean had texted, ‘Hope you’re having a good week. Work’s been crazy on my end!’ to which Cas had replied, ‘Me too. Sorry, can’t talk. Back-to-back appointments all day,’ effectively shutting down the conversation. Dean had kept texting him. No more questions after the first text, like he didn’t want to put any pressure on Cas to reply... or he already knew that Cas wouldn’t.
The day continued well. Meg offered to buy them all lunch in an ongoing effort to make things up to Alfie, who seemed in much better spirits. Lunch turned out to be from Wiener Hut, which initially earned a glare from Cas who thought Meg was teasing Alfie again. It turned out that Alfie had been the one to pick lunch though. Apparently, he missed their dogs and it had been long enough since he worked there that the smell didn’t automatically trigger flashbacks to his stint in fast food hell. Meg pretended to be offended and gave Cas a hard time for thinking the worst of her.
Mel was still intently looking at Castiel. Their next move was kinda his choice. “What do you think?”
“Hah, he said supernatural,” Theo sniggered under his breath, not able to help himself. It earned him an elbow to the ribs from Mel as she looked at him with raised eyebrows. But there was a grin tugging at her lips, too.
“Nothing,” Dean immediately shot back, but got interrupted by Sam.
“Well, that wasn’t very illuminating.” Theo sighed and chugged the rest of his beer in one go, nervously chuckling at the irony.
“Great,” Dean grumbled. “So, Jack pushed and we have no idea who or what did the pulling.”
“What do I do now?” Despite everything there was still a slight edge of insecurity to the boy’s voice.
“Oh, he’s very close to waking up,” Rowena responded. “He’ll be fine.”
“You want a beer?” Sam finally asked as he got up and stretched his back, already starting towards the kitchen.
“How so?” The older Winchester demanded confidently, but his mouth had instantly gone dry at the implications.
* * *
“If Dean and Jack stay together, the spell uses that bond and basically acts like a bloodhound. It won’t give up until it has found the object it’s set on. So, it will inevitably lead them to him.” She shrugged at Sam like nothing she had said was a big deal to her.
“What…” he croaked. “What happened?”
So, here we go. I really hope I can get into a more frequent updating schedule. Not very good at those...
“Yes,” he said as he snapped out of his thoughts. “Are they,” – was
To everyone’s relief, Mel’s phone suddenly vibrated on the table and distracted them from the current conversation.
Just as he made his way around the last bush that separated him from Jack, he stopped dead in his tracks, still bent low to the ground. There was a man standing on the other side of the trees, looking directly at Jack, who was, despite having been discovered, still trying to hide.
“What the fuck, guys!?” Jean yelled as she came running back. “Why is there a man sleeping in my bed?”
“Aww, you love us!” Mel crooned teasingly and Jean gave her an eye roll.
“Boys,” she nodded in greeting. “You called?”
“Mel, you better not have given him any of my fan shirts.” Theo gave her a pointed look. “Maybe he can’t smite you right now, but I don’t think he’d take kindly to wearing my Demon Dean or King of Hell shirts.”
“Son of a bitch… Not this crap again,” Dean finally sighed with a frustrated eye roll, deciding there and then that he wasn't going to play along with the actor charade again, and turned to Jack. “That’s not Cas.”
“I don’t know, man,” she replied.
“Seriously, you weren’t even supposed to be on set today. What’s going on?” The man sounded tired and although Dean still couldn’t quite see his face, the eye roll was obvious in his voice. “Is this some sort of prank? Did they finally break you and turn you against me?”
“I see. And what did you need all that confetti for?” She didn’t seem as reserved about their shenanigans as she usually was. Her date must’ve gone well, then.
“Yes, basically,” Misha nodded with a mirthful grin.
“Right, Vancouver… Did you maybe happen to run into someone who looks exactly like you today?” Dean went on and he was well aware of how insane he must sound to someone who already thought he was getting pranked.
“Dean means well but he is not always right,” Cas said, maybe a little bit more forcefully than intended. He was slowly getting fed up with the self-doubt Dean’s behavior was filling the boy with. “I trust you not to hurt me. So, let us try again.”
, maybe we should try talking to him before we call the authorities,” Mel explained. “There’s probably a simple explanation for this.”
“Great choice,” Mel said and gave him a thumbs-up. “If you need anything to wear over that, Theo has quite an impressive collection of flannels.”
They’d been driving in silence for the better part of half an hour and Dean was still fuming from the short, but intense, argument they’d had before finally taking off. While Misha was slowly relaxing his iron grip on the steering wheel, a quick glance into the rear view mirror showed him that Jack was smiling unassumingly. What a precious kid. He loved Alex almost like a son, but he was an adult. This was, for all intents and purposes, just a child in a weirdly grown up body.
to say is that this wasn’t us.” He nodded over at the still unconscious form of Jack. “It was an accident.” Dean huffed at that and earned himself another exasperated look from his brother. “It was. Jack was training with Cas. Somehow things got out of control, the rift opened, and Cas was pushed through.”
, at least Mel and Theo had now accepted the fact that the man was telling the truth. “You
“I know what you’re thinking. Stupid is the right word. Maybe some weird weather phenomenon?” He walked over to the fridge and fetched two bottles of beer, then sat down next to her and handed one over.
“I thought you’d come around, too?” Theo gave Jean an unsure look.
“I have two kids.” Misha just shrugged by way of explanation. “I know my way around a petulant child.”
,” she replied, getting a little testy herself. “I was in the middle of an extremely intricate spell when a power surge interrupted me. So, you see, I had to start over. Very inconvenient.”
“Look, now that we know the rift won’t just shut down on us, we can go over there and find him,” Sam tried to reassure his brother. “Dean, we’re gonna bring him back.”
“Check.”
Three more beers were raised, and the sound of clinking glass filled the room. It was followed by a contemplative silence while they drank. Castiel’s eyes swept the room and got stuck on the far wall which was covered in photographs. When Mel followed his gaze, she immediately blushed. There was a whole section dedicated to photo ops she and Theo had gotten at conventions. When he zoned in on a very certain photograph, she got nervous and, admittedly, a little excited. It was the one she had taken with Jensen and Misha, her personal favorite. She was leaning on Jensen’s arm, looking up at him, while he and Misha were holding hands and raising their eyebrows at her. All three of them were smiling. Castiel tilted his head and squinted at the image. It became very obvious to Mel that he didn’t even realize he was being watched.
“Samuel, this is uncharted territory for all of us. It is a spell of my own devising and I have never used it before. So please, let me explain it in my own time.” Again, she raised her eyebrows at him and successfully shut him up. “As I was saying, a tracker and a power source. Accidentally, both of those things happen to be at our disposal.”
“Is he your boyfriend?” the boy went on, as blunt as ever.
him,” Dean growled almost dangerously. “Jack lost control and
“No, I’m not staying behind. Cas is my friend, too,” Sam tried to reason because he really didn’t want his brother to go without him. “Jack and Rowena can stay here and guard the place.”
“You see, Jack, it kinda
A few minutes later they had copied the video into the designated folder and started it up on the media player. They saw themselves running around and then sitting down in the middle of the frame. Their set-up looked prefect. It could have come out so great… The first 30 seconds went off just as planned, their summoning spell unfolding beautifully. Then, without warning, the blinding flash of light temporarily took over the whole screen and made it impossible to see what else might have been going on in that moment. The audio had been completely corrupted, all they could hear was a constant hissing from the speakers. Suddenly the light was gone and the frame tilted to the side, indicating the exact moment the camera had tipped over. Then everything went back to normal, showing the two cowering on the ground. Screen-Mel looked up and her “Happy hunting” was barely audible over the receding noise.
“This is going to be awesome!” the young woman exclaimed in excitement as she bustled around the backyard. “I mean, if we don’t get extra points for the effort we’ve put into this… I am going to write Misha a very indignant tweet.”
know about marriage?”
She dismissed his comment with a light-hearted shrug and kept on grinning. Gingerly she aligned the final light with the scenery they were setting up. When she was satisfied with the lighting, she took a step back to take in their progress. The man had just finished up his part of the set-up, put the empty prop box aside and got up to stand beside her.
“What kind of power source are we talking about?” Dean then asked, not questioning the risk Jack would be taking on by being the guinea pig for an untested spell.
“Well, if you put it like that…“ Mel screwed up her face in frustration. This was just the epitome of clusterfuckery.
“Rowena,” Sam said, only slightly surprised.
is going on here?”
“Just… Just try to direct some of your energy at me. Think about what you need to happen. Stay focused.”
They both jumped into action at the same time, squeezed past Jean and ran over to her open bedroom door.
“Basically, yes,” the witch replied as she turned back to the three pairs of eyes currently resting on her. “There is no way to be certain about what is on the other side, I’m afraid. Your angel’s grace and the remaining echo of that spell make it impossible for me to look beyond the rift. But – and this is just guesswork, though I do know quite a bit about these kinds of things – I think it might have been a summoning spell.”
Meanwhile, one universe over…
“Okay, we have 45 seconds. You want to do the honors?”
“No!” Jack cried out in desperation, tears forming in his eyes. “I’m not… I- I can’t stop it!”
Mel and Theo shared a secret grin at that. Jean was very picky when it came to men, so “amazing” could basically be equated with “marriage material”. The space behind the sofa was suddenly bathed in a warm light when Jean flicked on the light switch in her room. This was quickly followed by a high-pitched scream.
“Cas, I think something is wrong.”
“If you want to put it in layman’s terms, yes.” Rowena sighed softly and slowly walked over to where Jack was still hunched over in a chair, motionless.
“What
“So… you
“Yeah well, I’ll only be a few minutes. You have to keep an eye on the rift, make sure no one crosses over,” Dean tried because maybe giving him a job would keep him off his back for a moment.
“Okay,” the boy said, resting his head against the window and apparently starting to count the streetlights. It took less than five minutes until they heard a soft snoring from the backseat.
“Stop! Jack, you can stop this!” A pained growl fell from Cas’ lips as his knees gave out.
“What did you do?”
Theo elbowed Jean in the side and hissed, “Don’t flirt with the angel.” To his relief Castiel hadn’t caught their exchange, though, as he had found the mirror by the front door and was now eyeing himself skeptically.
“Still, here we are,” Dean stated and threw his hands up in an all-encompassing gesture. Apparently, every version of Cas seemed to have a soft spot for the kid. Well, this was kind of annoying. “So, you gonna help us or not?”
“I’m already packed,” Dean stated with a nod to his duffel bag. “What’re we waiting for?”
Oh and merry belated Christmas! I hope you're all staying safe.
“Don’t play dumb with me! There is a man lying on my bed!” She was completely distraught as Mel and Theo exchanged an incredulous look.
Dean just huffed at the sarcasm. “I just don’t get why we couldn’t take the Impala. I mean, it was right
“And it shouldn’t have! I mean, come on, the sheer amount of coincidences that had to come together for
It wasn’t exactly clear to them if he thought that a good or a bad thing.
“That may be true, but I have still ended up here and it seems the rift could be anywhere on this planet,” Castiel sighed almost defeatedly. “Why were you even performing a summoning spell in the first place? There is no supernatural activity in this universe whatsoever.”
“Well…” the man – Misha – started and ruffled his hair in an unsure gesture. “What do you want to know?”
From Dean’s extended silence Sam gathered that he’d come to the same conclusion. He didn’t need to look at his brother to know he was still fuming. Poor Jack would likely get an ear full when he came to. If Dean could restrain himself, that was.
He knew he wouldn’t be able to get any actual sleep. But it was a good enough excuse to get the other man’s attention away from him for the time being. Truth was, he started to like the man despite his intrusiveness, and not only because of his very familiar face. He was witty and funny and yeah… kinda hot. Even if it felt wrong to admit, even to himself.
The older Winchester just nodded and looked over at Jack. “What about him?”
“Try slowing down a bit,” the angel tried to calm him and moved a step in Jack’s direction, his hands outstretched as if he was preparing to keep the nephilim from falling over.
“I think we need to review the video material. Maybe we can figure out what happened that way. If the camera’s still working, that is.”
“I’m driving myself, thank you very much,” Misha replied sharply.
“Theo, think for a second. Maybe this has something to do with the ‘incident’.” She hissed the last word with a profound nod in the direction of Jean’s bed.
“Humor me,” he added with a lump in his throat.
“I think,” he finally breathed after a prolonged and very pensive silence, “we need to be careful. Is there any way we could confirm that he is telling the truth?”
“We can?” Rowena butted in and crossed her arms over her chest, furrowing her brows at him.
ears. An impossible feat, really.
Another hour had gone by without anything happening. Dean had packed his duffel for any possible universe hopping activities and it was now prominently sitting on the chair beside him. They had fallen into a tensed silence that was occasionally broken by Dean impatiently tapping on the table. Sam had stopped after his third beer, but his brother had managed to get halfway through the bottle of whiskey.
“I think this might be our best item yet,” she replied confidently. Without looking, she put a hand on the man’s – Theo’s – shoulder. “The others are going to lose their shit when they get to see this.”
“But Rowena said the spell only works if we stay together,” Jack said and if Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say the kid was scared.
“Very well, thanks for asking,” she giggled as she slipped out of her boots and went over to her room. “He was… amazing.”
Jean stared at him in consternation. He’d never raised his voice to her like this. It had effectively stunned her into speechlessness, but inwardly she still wanted to explode. How could they be so stupid?
“Mhm,” Dean just mumbled, still dumb struck with embarrassment.
“Rowena, what does that mean?” Sam was growing rather impatient, but the witch wasn’t having any of that.
Mel had to laugh at that and gave Jean an approving look. Then she sobered up a bit and beat Castiel to the explanation. “In theory you’re probably right. But, you see, there is no supernatural activity here, just like Cas said. Which means our universe renders him powerless. Here he’s just… a regular guy, I guess.” Her eyes went back to the angel, who nodded his confirmation. He looked more than a little unhappy at the bleak prospect.
“What about any of this makes sense to you, exactly?” Dean asked irritably and fully aware of the fact that he was probably pissing off the one person who could help them. It wasn’t his fault, though. Their best friend had been pushed into another dimension, for fuck’s sake! How did they
“Damn, you make jokes now?” Theo laughed and took another sip from his bottle which got him an offended glare from her. “You’re full of surprises.”
“Speakers?”
“Didn’t you say something about a spell? What do you need me for?” the actor shot back immediately.
She nodded. “3… 2… 1… and action!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shit, Jensen! Calm down. I don’t know how you managed to pull off a prank like this but I don’t really care for it,” Misha huffed and brushed off Dean’s hand in annoyance. “Getting the fans involved, this is a new low.”
“What’re you guys talking about?” Mel had come back to the kitchen, her arms full of shirts and pants for their “guest” to try on. Fortunately, Theo and Castiel were roughly the same height, although the younger man was a bit leaner, less muscular. They’d just have to go by trial and error.
“Oh.” Misha looked at the boy in understanding. “I’m sure he didn’t do it on purpose.”
how he felt about him. He knew Dean didn’t trust him. Still he wanted to be part of whatever dysfunctional family they had become over the years. The weird thing to him was that it didn’t feel weird at all. Of course, Sam was his brother. Cas was… his best friend, he guessed? For a long time, he’d considered him a brother and not only in arms. But… somehow, it’d always been different than with Sam. He’d called him a brother, but it’d never sat quite right with him. Which was only natural, he’d told himself. Sam was his actual, having-grown-up-together-and-having-the-same-parents brother, family by blood. Cas was… different. Always had been. Well, maybe now wasn’t the time to analyze the way he felt about the angel or the space he’d made for himself in Dean’s life. Or the kid who’d decided to be his son now. His
So, Castiel had only mixed with fellow Church members. If they were lucky, he and his peers might get to take part in a youth group activity that had been deemed suitably moral and boring. There was the occasional camping trip complete with the obligatory singing about God around the campfire.
Meg looked at him and tilted her head, then said to Cas, “I like him, reminds me of Eli from
He just smiled at Cas and walked over, putting his hand on the small of Cas’s back as they went inside. Sam headed straight for the bar to get them drinks, while they hung back near the entrance. Dean gave Cas a brief one-armed hug and settled his hand on his hip, gently squeezing him to his side. It was nice to be somewhere where this was unremarkable. He would probably be this affectionate with Cas in any bar, because, fuck it, he could handle himself in a fight. But as much as he was confident in his ability to stand up for himself, he appreciated that they were in a space where he wouldn’t have to. No one would make some asshole comment about them or try to start a fight just because they were two dudes here. Dean felt a surprising sense of belonging in spite of the cheesy pop music playing.
It’s Dean
Dean had stood there frozen for a moment before he’d looked down at Sam and seen his bloody lip. Facial wounds bleed like a bitch, even when they weren’t serious. It’d been enough to freak Dean out, even though Sam insisted he was fine and more worried about him. Dean didn’t give a damn about his own throbbing face. It was worse than his dad had done before, still, he probably would have shrugged off John's violence towards him, but hurting Sam? Dean couldn't put up with that.
Except Dean did. He liked men, and he wanted to see them naked. The gay porn magazine wasn’t a joke, but, coincidently enough, it
They talked about Dean’s job for a while. A topic he was passionate about. Eventually, Dean’s nerves settled into a quiet hum in the background that mixed almost pleasantly with the excitement and anticipation he was feeling. He grew more comfortable as the conversation went on. Cas was easy to talk to—well, easy to talk to once Dean relaxed anyway.
It took a bit of fiddling with his sketch until he was happy with it. The bold floral design popped and he couldn’t make out the symbol he was trying to obscure beneath. It was definitely better than the wonky window Piper had ended up with to cover her swastika brand on
“So, any plans for today?” Meg asked.
“Teasing you, maybe, but not making fun of you.”
“I think I’m going to go for a walk,” Cas said and blinked out with a rustle of feathers and a gust of wind.
“I'm a defence investigator,” Dean explained. “Being charming helps get people talking.”
The kind of experiences that Cas enjoyed tended to vary wildly. He liked doing new things and spending time together but, other than that, there were no requirements. Cas loved both the sublime and the mundane with equal passion. Dean had seen him look at a mini golf course with the same expression of awe he’d had when he looked at the Grand Canyon. They had taken a trip to the famous gorge last year and Cas had been delighted. He stood staring at it for a good half hour before turning to Dean and saying simply, ‘It’s so big, grand indeed,’ and then suggested they get on with their hike. A month later, Dean had taken him to Tee-rific Mini Golf a few towns over. Cas stopped in front of the windmill obstacle and marvelled at it until the people behind them got impatient. ‘It’s so tiny and yet the sails really turn, ingenious,’ he said, smiling at Dean before hitting his ball through those spinning sails and getting a hole in one.
“Fuck!” Dean gasped. “I need you inside me.”
“Fine, I’ll say I’m sorry,” Meg relented. “There you go again, Clarence, after all this time, you're still making me a better person.” She scowled at him. “You know I hate that.”
“I think the artist’s Icelandic, so perhaps he was inspired by glaciers and ice caves and other places the White Witch would be right at home in,” Cas said.
each other? It had started off as a one-night stand and while it was more than that now, he wasn’t sure exactly what it was. Perhaps it was just ongoing sex without strings, a series of one-night stands. He thought they seemed to be friends at least, so perhaps they were friends with benefits.
“I’m not buying it. I don’t know you,” Dean insisted, glaring at the unhappy angel. Castiel was looking back at him intently, like he could make him remember with the power of his damn laser beam stare. Which actually...
“C’mon, Cas, this is meant to be a party, a jamboree, a fiesta! We’re supposed to be having fun and making merry, and here you are, moping about like you’re the sad clown at a discount funfair.”
“Well, dad was kind of an asshole. He tried to play me and Sam off of each other, kind of similar to what your dad did to you and your brothers, it sounds like. It didn’t make us hate each other, but it kind of made us hate ourselves sometimes, you know?”
“Cas, there’s nothing wrong with being gay. There’s nothing wrong with who you are.”
Dean rose to his knees but put a quelling hand on Cas’s chest when he moved to rise too. “Wait.” He took off his flannel shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt that stretched temptingly across his pecs. Cas reached out to stroke his chest as Dean reached down, using the shirt to gently wipe Cas's exposed stomach clean.
Seeing Balthazar and then seeing Gabriel had shaken Cas. Even if Cas felt both reunions were ultimately positive things, they’d been hard on him. It was good to see him looking more at ease than he had in the week since he’d seen Gabriel.
“Well, no one else figured it out either,” Dean said sulkily.
I’d love to see you! Flying takes it out of me but if you wanna come hang out at mine and just have a quiet night in, that’d be awesome :)
Cas knelt up and removed his coat, followed swiftly by his shirt and tie, tossing them carelessly to the floor. He leant down to help Dean out of his own shirt and t-shirt, then paused disrobing to kiss his mouth and then his neck, stopping to linger on the spots he knew were sensitive, licking up the side of his throat and sucking just beneath his ear. He continued down his body, kissing and licking and sucking until he got to Dean’s waist and began to remove his pants. Dean’s erection bobbed free and Cas placed a quick kiss on the head. It was a chaste kiss, not a prelude to seduction. It was more like a greeting, as if to say, ‘hello my old friend, it’s good to see you again’. Then he continued to draw Dean’s pants down his legs. Dean toed off his socks while Cas quickly got rid of his own pants and socks before laying down on him again, naked flesh pressed against naked flesh. They kissed with growing urgency, lips and hands becoming more insistent. Cas sucked hard on the side of his neck, leaving a mark where anyone could see it.
It wasn't that unusual for Dean’s instincts to be at odds with each other, craving closeness while pushing people away. He'd gotten better at that, at not pushing people away, at letting people in. His instincts were fighting each other right now, though.
He could hear Dean humming in the kitchen. Apparently, sex was fine as long as it was Cas who was tricked into it, not Dean. No, that wasn’t fair, he hadn’t tricked him. Cas had just assumed that renewed affection was equated with restored memories. He leant against the sink, taking deep breaths and trying to regain his composure.
“It’s hilarious! How long were you looking for me without realising I was right under your nose, schtupping your brother?!”
“Yeah, of course, let’s spend the night in the love shack. Why the hell is there only one bed here any-” the sentence cut off abruptly, like Dean could hear his own unnecessarily snide tone and had actually made an effort to swallow the hostility. Not much of an effort, since that hostility seemed to be escaping through his eyeballs instead and burning a hole in Castiel.
“Not long. I may have, uh, checked out the shop Instagram later at home,” Dean said.
“Down the hall.” Dean waved his arm weakly in its general direction.
“Super gay,” Charlie agreed before tilting her head and pursing her lips thoughtfully. “Or they’re so straight they’re clueless?”
“No, that would be wrong.” He paused. “Perhaps rather satisfying but still wrong. I merely made it so he will have a very vivid dream tonight about being attacked for who he loves. He will feel the unfairness of it, see the stupidity of hating where other people love. Hopefully the experience will teach him something about empathy.”
As soon as he shut the door behind them, Cas took Dean’s face in his hands, holding him still while he looked at him seriously.
“Just do something you’ll enjoy, dumbass. He already likes you—you don’t need to impress him,” Meg told him when he asked her.
“Wait, what? I was joking. Are you joking?”
Sam’s dumb joke broke the tension and the anxious, fight or flight feeling that had been building in Dean dissipated.
Sam and Charlie flew in a couple of days later and got to the house in the evening. Jo and Charlie disappeared off somewhere shortly after their arrival.
“Yeah?” Gabriel asked and grinned when Cas nodded. “I look forward to it. It’s really good to see you again, Cassie.” His face grew serious and he cleared his throat awkwardly. “You know I love you, right, kid?”
“Please don’t leave me again, Cas,” he whispered.
Annnnnd there went Dean’s willingness to talk to the guy politely.
“Which one?” the bartender asked as he mixed the cocktail.
“No eggs for you if you’re going to mock,” Cas said, waving a spatula at her.
“Cas!”
Camping was torture. A confused Castiel had had to sleep inches away from another boy while desperately trying to hide the effect the proximity had on his hormone-addled body. He was terrified of being found out, exposed by boys who might be disgusted by him.
“Well, I can tell you, just from being close to the rift that it’s not like the one we dealt with before. This is…” She walked closer and moved her hands as if feeling it out, even going so far as to sniff at it. “Oh my, this is extraordinary.”
Mel just rolled her eyes and together they joined their roommate and the angel in the living room. She put down four bottles of beer on the table and then sat down next to Castiel while Theo lounged down on a pillow on the other side of the coffee table.
Man, I am so sorry for how long this one took. The "finale" kinda did a number on me and I really didn't feel like writing for quite some time. Somehow I finally managed to get this done, though, because it's all about writing our own stories, right? If you're still reading, I'd love to know what you think!
“Well, call me a romantic, but I think the right person is out there somewhere. For all of us. Sometimes you don’t even have to look far,” Jean stated, single handedly defusing the tension. She even dared to give Mel and Theo a suggestive wink. Well, there were things she just didn’t know about them. They both stared her down, disapprovingly. She just raised an eyebrow and shrugged in a suit-yourself gesture.
“Uhm… Portland, Oregon?” Mel replied, trying hard for confident, but it came out rather thinly.
Mel’s eyes narrowed suspiciously as she read the message over three times. Then she looked up at the others, her gaze finally settling on Castiel. “I think he’s fucking with us. He says he needs our address because he’s in the car with Dean and Jack, and they want to pick up Cas.”
?” Dean sank back into his seat, completely baffled by Jack’s statement.
“Look,” Dean turned back to him, “we’re not here for you. So, if you could quickly answer some questions we’ll be out of your hair.”
actually blushing as he nodded at the photo? – “in a relationship?”
me here?”
“What?” Dean was starting to get tired and short-fused. He just wanted to rest his eyes for a bit, but the man beside him gave off an energy of relentlessness.
“Road trip!” Mel exclaimed, much more excited than her two friends.
“I know you don’t trust me very much and I know that you sometimes think I might be just another monster,” the nephilim said hesitantly, yet very sure of his words. “I understand. But you have given me a home, and I want to try my best to be a part of your family.”
Rowena raised her eyebrows at that, but conceded, “He’s not wrong. It would be best not to pair up the two more capable ones while the other two are left weak and vulnerable.”
“Oh,” Dean breathed, utterly out of his depth with the blunt emotionality Jack was suddenly offering.
Dean put a hand on Jack’s shoulder and wordlessly dragged him down with him into a crouching position. In the same move the older hunter also pushed the nephilim slightly behind himself without giving him so much as a second look. Instead he pulled out his gun and started to slowly crawl towards the voices.
Rowena took a step closer to the rift, her face set in a calculating glare as she extended her hand to feel out the power emanating from it. “It’s weak, but I can feel the residues of a spell. Unfortunately, I cannot make out its nature. It feels… obscure and kind of amateurish.”
“I know,” Jack replied, looking over at Misha with a proud smile.
Just as quickly as it had started it was over again, though. An almost deafening silence enveloped them. That was until Theo’s tensed body slackened next to her and his hand accidentally landed on the confetti button. A loud
“We’re still about one and a half hours from Seattle. Maybe you should close your eyes and rest,” Misha suggested with a look at the boy.
Castiel furrowed his brows and tilted his head a little in a complete lack of understanding. Mel had to bite her lip in order not to giggle at the angel’s trademark expression. She didn’t want to weird him out and consequently be branded as the crazy fangirl. Theo wouldn’t let her live it down. Ever.
have kids together. You know that, right?” Ah, with the teasing again.
“I am,” Misha nodded, seeming a little disappointed, but understanding, nevertheless. “I’ll wake you when we’re in Seattle.”
“Obviously Dean is right.
“Not yet… Misha is a very famous actor who probably gets thousands of messages every day. It was a long shot,” she admitted with a sigh. “Anyway, I’m not sure how he could’ve helped us. If he believed any of it, that is.”
“Oh yes, especially Jensen would be inconsolable if I didn’t show up,” Misha nodded vigorously. “He loves me very much, you know?”
They both looked over at the boy, Sam more worried than anything, Dean with grim determination. There was little they could do, though. The effort it had taken to open the rift had to have been enormous, even if it had just been an accident. Jack’s batteries were probably drained and he had to wake up by himself. Sam’s first instinct would usually have been to fall back on research. Their situation was so unique, though, that he didn’t really expect to find anything on the internet. So, with no way of getting to Rowena who might have been able to help with examining the rift closer, there was nothing left to do but wait. And keep an eye on Dean.
,” he started warningly, ready to put on his signature bitch face. It was blaringly obvious where this was going. Typical.
“Road trip,” Theo and Jean groaned in unison.
“You don’t need to be sorry. I am aware that this is an extraordinary situation for all of us. Frankly, I am surprised by your willingness to accept the truth of it,” the angel said, now a little softer, and finally took a swig of beer. “I’m beginning to think it’s a good thing that I have ended up here. You seem to have detailed knowledge of the supernatural and are probably most qualified to help me.”
think it’s more likely that he’s actually in a car with Dean and Jack? That the rift opened wherever he was at the time and they met by accident?” he challenged, quite miffed to be called out like that.
“That… makes sense.” The nephilim nodded slowly. “But Dean–“
“Well, there is
want to know?”
“Cas?” Jack finally asked in a small voice and Dean’s heart made an honourable attempt at jumping into his mouth.
Now it was Dean’s turn for understanding to dawn on him. “He didn’t just drop on the other side then?” He looked at Rowena, dreading the confirmation he knew was coming. She nodded. “So, he might be fuck knows where over there? Without his powers? This is just awesome.”
mean, then? Shouldn’t you guys come with special features? Like, you know, a location service for lost universe doors?”
“Look, I know it sounds crazy,” he sighed quietly. “But… I don’t know, man… I’d just like to think that there are things we just can’t explain. Things that shouldn’t be possible from a scientific point of view. And you know me, I’m a science guy. But just because we don’t understand
As always, thanks to my awesome and supportive beta
Cas sighed. It was true, Dean was still very reserved when it came to the boy. But at least he had managed to reign in his open hostility towards him. There was a reason neither Cas nor Sam had told the older Winchester about today’s sparring session, though. He would have just bulldozed them right out of doing it. So, Sam had agreed to get Dean away from the bunker for a few hours under the pretense of taking him to a bar for a well-deserved boys’ night out.
The quote completely went over Jean’s head, but Mel laughed lightheartedly, then turned back to Jean and added, “It’s not fanfiction if it’s true.”
“Well, I won’t stop you,” he conceded with a frown, but then muttered, “But don’t mess with the nerd angel, just saying.”
“Oh shit…“ Theo groaned, a sudden realization dawning on him. “Say, in theory, if an angel were to enter such a rift while someone on the other side was performing a summoning spell… Would that change anything?” His voice grew ever higher towards the end of his question.
Mel waved her hands exaggeratedly at the angel beside her. “Yeah, I think the odds are in our favor.”
“You could also get one for the one with the great hair. Wait, isn’t he called Dean, too?” Jean asked with an amused grin.
. “Seriously Jensen, I’m not in the mood.”
Meanwhile, the man had followed their exchange in grave silence, the frown on his face having grown to epic proportions.
“Well, he loves his family a lot and cares for everyone, even me,” they boy shrugged, and in a sudden rush of discomfort averted his eyes. “He’s a good brother and a good dad. Why shouldn’t he be a good husband, too?”
“And you want to leave the Evil Witch and Nuclear Boy to take care of that?” Dean interjected. “I don’t think so.”
“Fans,” Misha shrugged, finally having found his voice again. “And you mean to tell me…” he looked back over at the rift again, “that you are the
“Misha?” The name rolled off his tongue as if it were something especially peculiar. “No. I have heard that name before, though.”
“Who else is going to look out for you two nut jobs?” Jean shrugged again, this time with a small smile.
Let me know what you think! ;D
“No, no, no … NO! Stop!” Jack cried out in a full-blown panic as he heard a low
“I hate this,” Dean finally announced with a frustrated edge to his voice and slammed his glass down on the table, “sitting on our asses while Cas is fuck knows where and that rift could shut down any minute.”

believe the guy seemed to crumble a bit. “How did you even get here?”
“Oh, right,” Jean nodded and went on, sniggering. “You could get him one that says, ‘My friend went to another dimension and all he got me is this dumb shirt’.”
“What kind of prank is this? Seems way too elaborate for either you or Jared,” he sighed, exasperatedly rubbing at his face.
“Jean,
“Care to elaborate?” Dean was fighting very hard to keep his impatience in check.
“Alex?” Dean heard the voice before he could see its owner, but it was weirdly familiar and sent an ominous shiver down his spine. “What the hell are you doing here?”
, what kind of person do you take me for?” Mel said in mock indignation. “But if his reality is anything like the show, I know
to tell him. Maybe he just needed to tell
“Dean-“ Jack started after a few seconds of confused disorientation, but Dean turned around to him and quickly put a finger to his lips in an obvious shushing motion. He proceeded to point at his ear and then in the direction the light was coming from. It was then that Jack heard muffled voices from the other side of the tree line.
he was going to react?
“Guys? This isn’t funny and I’m tired. Just tell me what’s going on,” the man interjected, quickly losing his patience.
to get him home.” Theo bit his lower lip in thought, his eyes trained on Jean’s scared face. “When I say
The younger man gave a little frown at that, but then saw his brother pulling the bottle of whiskey towards him that was already sitting on the table. With a silent sigh, he turned and made his way to fetch himself a beer. This was going to be a long night.
“Yes, that would settle any doubts,” Castiel nodded affirmatively.
“We may have done that, yes,” Mel admitted reluctantly, shame written all over her face. “But in our defense, we didn’t think it would actually work.”
The glow around Jack became brighter as he moved a step closer to Cas, his eyes starting to burn like fire. Completely torn between his fears and the need to prove himself, he started to lose control. The flow of his blood grew hotter and he began to feel uncomfortable as he kept pushing energy towards the other man.
, right?”
Dean walked back and forth restlessly, alternating between rubbing angrily at his face and cursing under his breath, while Sam was mumbling into his phone. They had carried Jack into one of the more comfortable chairs in the adjacent library about half an hour earlier. He was still out cold.
Mel came back with a dark blue, plaid flannel and rushed into the hallway to hand it over to the angel. “I think this would go great with your new outfit,” she smiled innocently.
“Jensen?” The man addressed him again and suddenly the memory hit him with the force of a freight train. That actor guy they’d met
Sam had to grab a hold of his arm because his legs were still a little unsteady, but otherwise the nephilim appeared to be fine. Fine and obviously dead set on proving his usefulness to the group.
“So, what are we waiting for? Let’s get started!”
good. He looks even more like Cas than Misha does, if that’s even possible.”
“I mean you. You are the weak links here,” she snapped back. “You might be at an advantage when it comes to brute force but considering we don’t yet know what kind of universe we’re dealing with, it might be wise for you two to each stick with someone more powerful.”
, I mean Mel and me. You could spend the night at your parents’ place, and we’d have him out of here by tomorrow.”
“Who is Tumblr?” Castiel asked in confusion.
“The usual, then,” Jean grinned and put her beer down on the counter.
“Check.”
“Well, an angel doesn’t necessarily have to answer such a spell, as you well know, but considering the weak condition he must have been in, possibilities are high that he could not refuse the request.” She simply shrugged. “But, as I said, it’s just a guess, if a highly educated one.”
“Yeah, I’d actually be more comfortable with that, too,” Jean chimed in and patted Theo’s shoulder in a show of support.
“Jack, you will be acting as the tracker,” she announced with a curiously soft, regretful look at the boy. “I will plant the spell in you, so you will be able to…” she carefully considered her next words, “feel your way to Castiel.”
The man’s face was so full of doubt that Dean almost pitied him. Then he did the slightest head tilt and it reminded Dean so much of Cas, that he forgot to breathe for a second.
“Why are you so antsy, then?” Misha asked with a small smirk.
“This rift is more or less powering itself. I feel your angel,” she continued, looking at the glowing tear in awe, “almost like he’s still here. I think it’s his grace. It has taken a new form. But there’s some other energy intermingled with it.” She looked over at Jack. “A piece of
The three friends exchanged helpless glances before looking back at the newly human angel.
“Rift? What the fuck are you talking about?” But the actor’s doubts seemed to crumble as he looked over Dean’s shoulder to where he was pointing. His eyes widened again as they found the glowing tear in the fabric of his universe, this time in utter horror. He opened his mouth again but seemed speechless.
Dean, for all intents and purposes,” Theo argued, his face scrunched up in worry.
“You thinking about Becky? Well, they’re not all like her. And I feel like she’s been greatly misunderstood, anyway.” The actor quickly glanced at his phone, but no new messages so far.
“You’re wearing my best friend’s face,” he shot back with an eye roll.
“Color me impressed,” Dean said in a low voice and with a nod of approval.
an angel of the Lord,” he interjected, and all eyes were on him immediately. His presence was somewhat commanding. “You somehow seem to know me, and I have an idea about what happened. In this universe there is a television show called Supernatural?”
!” She was close to hysterics and already had her phone ready to act out the threat.
He narrowed his eyes, still suspicious of his best friend. “I’ll keep an eye on you, meddler.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Dean shouted angrily as he moved into action and ran down the short flight of stairs. “You’re killing him!”
are the power source, obviously.”
“Seems like we’ve just got to file it away under ‘mystery weather’… or something like that,” Mel concluded, shrugging, but not really satisfied.
Jean shook her head in disbelief, still unable to completely wrap her head around the fact that her friends’ absurd favorite show was apparently becoming reality. “I have never really watched that show. What does
“What Dean
“What?” Jean exclaimed. “Is this guy for real?”
“You guy’s are still doing that whole GISH thing, aren’t you? I thought it was over by now,” she said conversationally and made her way over to the kitchen to grab herself a beer, too.
“Thank you,” the man said quietly, but his voice was clear and steady.
“Hello?” A deep voice suddenly interrupted them. “Did you find clothes for me?”
“Huh?” Mel offered in surprise. “What man… HUH?”
“Cas!” Jack and Dean shouted at the same time, equally horrified when Cas seemed to lose consciousness. Jack tried to pull back his out-of-control grace with all his might, but it just didn’t want to let go of Cas.
the one who gave him the Impala shirt.” He just shrugged and leaned back on his hand.
“Of course I didn’t give him
“Not particularly, no,” he grinned crookedly. Somehow, he could feel that the actor
“But what if it is Misha but he just puts Jensen on the phone? I mean, he
“I don’t understand. What is special about road trips?” Castiel asked, shaking his head incredulously.
“I’ll drink to that,” Theo announced and raised his bottle. “Being an obsessive fan finally pays off.”
“But in that case shouldn’t there be a rift here, too? I mean, as far as I understand these rifts work just like doors, don’t they?” Mel was so much in her element now; she didn’t even care about the incredulous look Jean was giving her.
royalty free music started to play around them. They’d both put on their most serious faces when Mel started their choreography and entwined her fingers with Theo’s, letting their hands hang in the air next to the bowl. Then they began to take turns throwing herbs and other ingredients into the bowl while steadily looking at each other. A slight grin was tugging at the corner of Theo’s mouth, but Mel chastised him with a sternly raised eyebrow. They only had one chance to get the perfect shot. Cleaning up the confetti would take them hours, probably until after midnight and Mel had gotten it into her head that this
. He found that he liked this new side of Jean. “Okay, then.”
“I did no such thing,” she replied under her breath and stuck her tongue out at him.
He couldn’t see Jack from here and was now silently cursing himself for having left the kid behind. There was no way he could get back to him fast enough without flat out running, but he couldn’t take the chance of being discovered, either. Gritting his teeth, he ducked back down and started to army crawl as quickly as humanly possible.
Massive thanks to my very patient and very awesome beta
lying, and his face remained unreadable to him.
to bring Cas back. At any cost.
“Is it a secret?” the nephilim enquired curiously. “We won’t tell anyone, right Dean?”
, doesn’t mean we can just deny what’s happening here.”
“Well, I could wash your clothes if you want,” she shrugged, almost disappointed.
Jack’s eyes fluttered open and he looked up at the balustrade, instantly locking eyes with Dean. The older Winchester was struck with horror at the sight in front of him. Sam appeared right behind him and froze to the spot as he took in the scene.
Dean couldn’t even blame Jack, this man did for all intents and purposes, appear to be Cas. For a split second Dean thought it was him, too. But he knew better. Dean
“We have to get him to wake up. He sent Cas over there,” he gestured towards the rift without looking, “he can get him back.”
“Dean, I know,” Sam started, wanting to say something encouraging and hopeful, but coming up short. The truth was that he had no idea what they were supposed to do, either.
She had dragged him to the kitchen as soon as she’d seen an opening. Mel had shown the supposed angel to the bathroom. They’d all insisted he take a shower because, well, he did look worn from his journey. Now she was distracted with picking out some clean clothes for him to wear for the time being.
like what you see?” The actor raised his brows in question, but Dean just ignored him. “Well, if your Cas is anything like the one I know – and I know him pretty well because I kinda am him – he does like what he sees.”
Misha nodded silently and pulled his phone from his pocket. With a few swipes he had opened some messenger app, scrolled through his messages and found the picture. Then he handed the phone to Dean, still lost for words.
“So, you’re basically playing dress-up with an angel? To fulfill your dirty fanfiction fantasies?” Jean laughed, then turned to Theo. “I think we’re allowed to have some fun with this.”
Well shit, that actually made him blush a little. Whether it was the comment or the fact that he’d been caught staring, he wasn’t sure.
to happen? That’s a chance of one in a billion,” Theo tried to argue, and he was right.
Dean barked out an honest laugh at that. “Not anymore. Becky drugged him with a love potion, but we managed to get him out of that
“Sam, yes. And Cas, of course. He’s been there even before I was born,” Jack went on, then chanced a quick look at Dean from the corner of his eyes. “And you.”
you. She knew your characters and that’s no excuse for what she did. But it happens to us, too. You know, people thinking they know us personally because of our work and public appearances. Sometimes it’s completely overwhelming and scares the shit out of me. I’ve learned to lean into it, though. Most of the fans are great, loving, supportive, smart, and interesting people. It’s a unique relationship and there’s a lot to gain from it,” the actor rambled in defense of a fandom he’d grown to love a lot. “In a way, they’re family.”
“Aww, Rowena, don’t sell yourself short,” Dean smirked.
“What?” Sam gasped in surprise. “Jack, what was it?”
Dean did his most impressive eye roll at that. “Maybe you’ll make it back to set. Maybe not. There’s no way of really knowing, right?”
“Yeah, well,
“What? What do you mean?” Dean took a step towards the man and gripped him by the lapel of his coat without even realizing what he was doing. “I need to see that picture. Now!”
“Well, assuming that he is currently more human than angel, I might be able to equip you with a tracking spell,” Rowena replied, her face worried and deep in thought.
And weird they were indeed. As per request Misha had given them his phone number, albeit reluctantly. In return they’d told them to drive to Seattle. The unlikely trio was now expected to send a picture with a timestamp of something that proved they’d arrived there. Only then would they call Misha’s phone. He was secretly proud of how suspicious these particular fans were, even if it meant that Dean was growing evermore frustrated.
“We don’t know, to be honest. Sometimes it seems like it,” she shrugged uncomfortably. “But it’s mostly rumors and probably wishful thinking on our part. Would be great, though, wouldn’t it? They do look amazing together.”
He pressed one of the buttons that were discreetly hidden next to his leg, just out of frame, and some very esoteric and
“Did you achieve any results with the photograph we took earlier?” The angel took one of the bottles and opened it hesitantly, as he looked at the young woman next to him.
Misha swallowed heavily, suddenly not feeling so cheeky anymore. Jack put a reassuring hand to his upper arm and gave him a warm smile. “I can keep an eye on him for you, too.”
“Definitely not,” he agreed under his breath just as Jean walked in.
“Yes, thank you. I like it,” he finally admitted. “But I still prefer my own trousers. These are… very tight.”
It was at that exact moment that the front door opened with an ominous creak. Both Winchesters looked up at the gallery immediately when the slight woman entered, her cloak flowing as she looked down at them. She threw a thick, red lock over her shoulder and her lips curled into a superior smile.
“Okay,” Theo conceded, hands raised in defeat. “But please, whatever the outcome of that phone call might be, let’s not give anyone this address. We could still meet them somewhere else. Like, neutral ground.”
“I bet he’d take that very seriously,” the man sitting cross-legged in the grass sniggered while unfolding a big, square piece of soft fabric in front of him.
“Can you now?” Dean huffed, almost amused, as he turned away from them. Only then did he realize that the bustle from what he now knew was the set of a television show had almost completely died down. “So, no one’s gonna drive you home, big shot?”
With a deep breath he tried to clear his head and get his priorities straight. Get Cas back. Return to Sam. Have a word with Jack about that whole family business. And maybe, somewhere in between, find out why Misha had been so damn willing to believe their story right off the bat.
Dean turned back to look out at the dark road. He swallowed heavily and didn’t really know what to do or say for a few minutes while Misha managed to distract Jack with a discussion on some cartoon on Netflix about an adventurous girl. Dean didn’t pay attention but was grateful the actor had come to his rescue. His head had been a mess ever since he had seen Cas fall into the rift.
was Cas, he was sure of it. Stoic and a bit uncomfortable looking, wedged between two grinning twenty-something’s. The message had been sent only two hours ago.
“Camera?”
“Just outside of Vancouver,” Misha replied and knitted his brows. “On location to shoot an episode for season 13.”
, indeed.
“Who are these people?” Dean asked when he handed the phone back.
“No, don’t worry, it’s a great shirt.” Mel patted him on the arm reassuringly. “Maybe we should get another one so you can give it to Dean. I bet he’d love that.”
“I have come back from worse,” Castiel sighed deeply. “Dean and Sam are presumably already planning a very reckless rescue operation.”
“Get out of the way, Dean,” the angel panted and gave him a forceful shove. “It’s too late.”
From the corner of her eyes she saw Theo reaching for the button of the confetti cannon, but in the split second before he could push it, a lot of things happened at once. A flash of blindingly bright light illuminated the whole garden, forcing them to clamp their hands over their eyes. A high-pitched sound, almost like a screech, piercing their unprotected ears, made them consider if going blind really trumped going deaf. The ground was shaking beneath them, light bulbs exploded, and fuses blew. Theo was suddenly beside her, trying to wrap an arm around her shoulder while still shielding his eyes
“Erm…” Theo frantically looked at Mel for help.

“How’re you feeling?” he asked quickly.
to be done on a Thursday night. Theo called it her “fangirl perfectionism”, though she still wasn’t sure if she liked that term. But she
“How very profound,” Sam deadpanned, not paying any attention to his brother’s growing discomfort. He was used to it. “We know they have a weird relationship. How’s it going to help find Cas?”
“So, Jensen is this world’s Dean like you are its Cas?” Jack asked, leaning forward in his seat.
“Misunderstood? Really? She drugged Sam and forced him to marry her,” the hunter snapped and finally looked back at Misha, clearly agitated.
“Ah,” the witch exhaled. “I see. Now things are starting to make sense.”
“Yeah?” Dean grinned and turned around in his seat to properly look at the nephilim. “And what do
“Rolling!”
Man, Jack really
“Okay.”
“According to this specific task you have to help us with the rest of the hunt, just saying,” Theo added with a crooked grin.
Just when Mel was about to defend herself, the man on the bed started to stir into consciousness and all three of them instantly fell into a tensed silence. The man let out a soft groan and shifted a little. One hand went to his face as he propped himself up with the other. Then he slowly turned to the three terrified twenty-somethings, brows knitted in obvious confusion.
“I swear to God, if you kill Cas, I am going to send your ass straight to hell, you son of a bitch!” Dean yelled fiercely.
“My name is Castiel and I
“Perfect.” Dean gave him a blindingly bright grin. “Let’s go then. We haven’t got all night.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t mean she didn’t make her fair share of mistakes. But I think she was lonely and desperate. She felt connected to you guys because of the books. Of course, she didn’t
Dean, eager not to be reprimanded like his little brother, opted for confused silence.
“Sammy, someone needs to stay here to make sure nothing’s gonna cross over from that other place,” Dean argued with a certain finality to his voice. “And you know as well as I do it’s not gonna be me.”
He saw shadows of people moving about but it was hard to get a clear line of sight through the undergrowth. He was also looking almost directly into the blinding white light, causing him to shield his eyes. Quickly he went through a mental list of possible scenarios they might’ve landed themselves in. Given the circumstances an excavation, a building site or a crime scene seemed to be the most plausible to him. Considering their luck, they’d probably ended up in the middle of a murder investigation. Awesome.
Mel leaned forward to start up the laptop on the coffee table and Theo reached for the camera bag next to the sofa. His hands were still shaking a bit when he extracted the SD card from the slot, but Mel kindly didn’t say anything. Her calmness was all pretense and wouldn’t have borne closer examination, either.
“Oh,” Theo breathed in surprise. He’d expected a lot, but not
“Meaning Cas,” Sam deduced, slowly nodding in understanding.
“I’m just saying, he enjoys your face. And so do I. It’s also Jensen’s face, after all,” Misha shrugged nonchalantly and returned his attention to the road. Just in time for Dean’s curiosity to get the better of him again. Great.
The younger Winchester was holding an ice pack to his bruised jaw, the immediate result of successfully having stopped his brother from jumping into the rift right after Cas.
The nephilim and the angel stood opposite each other, roughly ten feet apart, in the middle of the bunker’s main hall. They had pushed the large, heavy table to the far wall, so they’d have enough space for Jack’s training. Up until then his powers were hard for him to control, but after his first breakthrough with Sam, he’d asked Cas to help him with some more advanced stuff. This session’s main goal was for Jack to incapacitate Cas without inflicting any injuries. The angel knew he was taking a certain risk, but he trusted Jack not to kill him.
The older Winchester rolled his eyes in frustration. “Not helpful.”
“You picking up on any sign of Cas?” Dean whispered and suddenly felt Jack’s hand on his left shoulder. He was about to shrug it off with a huff, but then realized that Jack had closed his eyes in concentration. It was probably how the tracking spell worked and although Dean didn’t like it, he also didn’t care if it meant finding Cas.
Jack had crept up beside him and with an annoyed side glance Dean saw that the boy was mimicking his stance perfectly, though without a gun. There’d never even been a discussion about Jack undergoing gun training seeing as he was already a weapon himself. Still, Sam had wanted him to carry a gun on this trip, just in case, but Dean had been very vocal about absolutely not risking getting accidentally shot by Wonder Kid.
“Jack, it's working. I think you have it under control.” Cas sounded happy which in turn made Jack happy.
Sam had to suppress an eye roll at that. He knew Dean would do anything to get their friend back. Hell, Sam was willing to do anything, too. But running headfirst into the unknown wouldn’t accomplish anything.
“Yes, sir!” She laughed and ran over to the camera to make sure it was running properly. Meanwhile, Theo sat down in the middle of the frame, their props in front of him, and started to light the candles. Mel hurried over to sit opposite her friend. She quickly placed a silver bowl between them, right in the center of the white sigil she had meticulously drawn onto the dark fabric.
“What? No! I was just about to ask you the same.” Mel looked back over to the unmoving body.
“You can’t be serious.” He almost laughed at her, but quickly quieted down when he saw the expression on her face, instead opting for a more concerned approach. “You’re crazy.”
She rolled her eyes in faux desperation but continued. “Well, he did pull you out of hell, if I remember correctly?”
“We were… ergh…“ Was she really about to explain GISH to the actual angel, Castiel? The delightful absurdity of the situation didn’t pass her by. “Well, Misha organizes this annual hunt, you see.” The angel gave her a puzzled look and was about to raise the obvious question, so she quickly clarified. “A scavenger hunt. It’s actually a global thing, pretty amazing. Everyone has a team and together you have to do pretty weird tasks. Like, say, perform an angel summoning spell and capture it on video.”
“You dressed him for a date, didn’t you?” Theo hissed accusingly as she walked past him to get more beer from the fridge while Castiel sat down on the sofa.
“For a second there I… He sounded sincere, okay? Maybe he believes all that crap himself. Which would make him even more of a lunatic,” she tried to reason.
“Okay.” The nephilim nodded hesitantly and took a quick look back at the rift. It was relatively well hidden behind some trees and the light it exuded was too weak to be seen while the light from the weird camp site was basically taking over the whole clearing.

“Impersonator?” Mel looked at Theo. “Look at him, he’s the spitting image of Misha! We’ve been to a quite a few conventions and no cosplayer has ever been
“Is something wrong with this shirt?” Castiel asked and knitted his brows together, fortunately oblivious to the subtext of the conversation going on around him.
.” He vaguely gestured into the space between them.
“No, I…” Jack scrunched his brows together in confusion. “What do you mean, Cas?”
Dean Winchester? And you lost Castiel?”
“No, we still have three more days to go,” Mel replied quietly.
“What?” The angel’s eyes widened in horror. And,
“Does that mean he’s stuck here?” Jean asked, her voice sounding almost concerned.
. But Dean was tired and although he wasn’t proud of it, he sort of enjoyed refusing the other man, especially after all the teasing. “Wouldn’t be fair to Jack, either. You got him all curious about your love life. I need some minutes of shuteye, anyway. You still okay to drive?”
“Hey, we booked a couple of lanes. I think in Charlie Bradbury’s name?” he informed the guy behind the bar.
Dean leans his knee against Cas’, a warm spot connecting them.
Dean rolls his eyes and grabs his leather jacket, “Fuck you, see you later. Let’s go, Cas.”
Benny shrugs, “She’s replying to my texts now. It’s all passive-aggressive, but it’s better than silence.”
“Would you like any dessert?” The waitress asks out of nowhere then.
The boyfriend doesn’t say anything, realizing now that he may have stepped in it.
“Right,” Dean grins bitterly, “like when you put food on the table after dad left, huh? Or make sure you make all the deadlines for applying to Stanford? Or, or maybe like when you remember your girlfriend’s birthday and don’t get mad at me for remembering. Or wait, no.”
The hunter unbuttoned his suit jacket upon entering the diner and lit up with a smile when he spotted something.
to hang out with Dean twice a week.
And it probably doesn't help that when Dean does meet people he only fucking talks about his stupid comp exam.
“Can you
Dean’s savoring it (psychopath) and Castiel observes him. His hair is greasy from the heat and near death experience today, and he’s peeling from a sunburn on his nose. But even so he’s the most beautiful thing Cas has ever seen, and for the first time in almost three weeks, Cas isn’t angry about it.
They eat dinner the three of them together, and it’s not too awkward because Sam is laughing at Dean humming Taylor Swift songs and Cas is smiling that smile that means he’s amused because Sam is laughing. At Dean.
That is, until Benny starts drawing tiny stick figures with enormous dicks on his comp notes.
“Sudoku?” Dean says and takes the book. “Awesome dude.” He finally lets Cas have some peace.
The teenagers scream and Dean catches a pair of them holding hands as they scramble through the door at the end of the hallway.
But that was shot to hell now.
“Yes, after he dumped that beer in my lap and accused me of cheating the only way was up, really. But we did get to talk a bit. He was rather upset with you in fact. I think you should talk to him today,” Cas tears a piece off a pancake and chews it lazily.
Sam shrugs, “I don’t know, ‘cause you’re self-destructive,” he says with sarcasm.
“Well, you suck at beer pong, Castiel,” Dean says, smiling.  When the ball lands in the first cup, he downs it, eyes on Castiel.
The Mr. Spock to his Captain Kirk. He cannot let Charlie see them together.

The first things Dean notices are feathers and glitter and then he’s almost hit in the face with a giant fan that someone is dancing with.
Cas nods, “I understand. I don’t always understand it myself.”
Den laughs. “You’re probably right.”
Dean accepted the sheet from him and drew the textbook closer. He read for a little and started filling in the information before sitting back.
Castiel is great, probably the greatest, but Dean still can’t believe he’s this hung up on a guy that didn’t even want to fuck him. That’s not like him. Maybe he just needs to get off. He completely ignores the idea that he should take a look at Cas' - Jimmy's - page. He's not that much of a douche.
Apparently not the invitation Cas thought it was.
“That’s a nice TV,” Castiel comments when Dean turns on Netflix.
They all look at Dean. Dean is notoriously never serious about his girlfriends. Not since Lisa in high school. He was so naïve.
Dean put his hands on his hips. “So I’m just supposed to get gay married by the heavens without any proposal or ceremony or anything? Sam was supposed to be best man.”
Mary shot Dean a confused look and Castiel acted like he had no idea what was going on.
“Why haven’t you said anything, ya idjit. You know you can always come to me. I watch out for you boys. Me and Ellen both.” Bobby doesn’t even sound disappointed and Dean’s chest warms with affection. He owes Bobby and Ellen everything.
“Sorry, Castiel, but I know you,” she continued giggling and Castiel glared. “If it’s so important to you, you’ll just have to get a job, sweetie.”
Dean rolls his eyes, “Thought you didn’t want details, bitch.”

“Okaaay,” Hanna leaned back in her chair, still trying to get Castiel to at least somewhat engage in their conversation. “Are you going to get another student to tutor?”
“We met a few weeks ago at some party over at Delta Phi. We got to talking because we were both designated driver, so the party sucked,” Dean says. “He’s this nerdy business major. I thought he was cool but I didn’t really think I’d meet him again - frats didn’t really seem like his scene, you know.”
He had told Cas, who hadn’t actually replied. But Dean knew he was busy with the debate team on Thursdays, so he didn’t think about it. He was a little forgetful in that adorable genius way.
“I mean, you got a dick pic from him,” Sam points out.
Dean chuckles, “Oh no, he’s still in high school. But he’s gonna go to Stanford and become some big shot yuppie lawyer. He’s the brains of the family,” he says with a proud look in his eyes.
Dean gets them a tiny bit closer.
“See you around,” Dean says, “Cas.”
“It’s fine, Bobby. I’ve just been stressed out over school,” he says and it’s not like it’s a total lie.
Dean hums to himself, mixing batter. He hasn’t turned on the radio, not wanting to disturb Cas despite the closed bedroom door.
Dean nods and turns to look after a waitress. He’s starving.
in fact have eyebrows, they’re just covered with power or concealer or whatever the fuck.
“It’s okay. I’m not going anywhere,” he says quietly.
She’s pointing right at their matching blue and yellow shirts when she says it.
“See you later, Alligator,” Dean calls after him, and Cas smiles to himself all the way home. More or less. It’s a long flight.
“I’m too broke.”
They all spend the last few days up to the event decorating and inviting
“This was great. You should come down more often,” Dean throws Sam’s duffle bag at him.
Dean finishes the text to Cas and sits down on Sam’s bed before finally looking up at Sam, “His name is Castiel.”
Dean can’t face them. Not when he thought there still was a chance, and not when there still hasn’t been one single day that Cas hasn’t been on his mind.
“Ugh!” The kid groans. “Gimme a break, Dean! At least I don’t go lusting over customers twice my age.”
“If my spreadsheet calculated your schedule correctly, you should have a math quiz coming up. We should review the past chapter.”
But he had been so great and he’d made Dean feel like he was actually worth someone’s time. Like he was actually smart and kind and all those things. Cas had probably realized his mistake by now though.
Castiel sits up too and stretches with a groan that does something to Dean that he hopes he can excuse with it being early in the morning.
And that can’t be right. When they’d met back in their sophomore year of college, Cas was already being objectified on the daily, so that couldn’t be. Could it? “What the fuck?”
Bobby and Ellen got into town this morning, barely on speaking terms because they can’t be in a confined space together for more than an hour before harmless banter turns into bickering turns into full on fighting. Of course they took the same car. Of course they got married three years ago. They’re stupid and Dean loves them.
He barges into the place, bell chiming and door slamming shut after him to keep the wind out. The restaurant is small, which is only accentuated with all the knickknacks between the too close to each other tables. Vases, waving fortune cats and even aquariums take up most of the floor space. Between all of the stuff Dean almost misses them on his way to his counter.
The telling off from Bobby doesn’t come though. There’s silence between them for a beat before Bobby asks, “You in financial trouble, son?”
Dean doesn’t have to wait long.
“’Roundabout way’” Dean mocks, air quotes and all, because there’s no way he trusts his nosy friends to not bring it up after going to a club where it’s three jägerbombs for a tenner.
“Yes, Cas, that’s right, and I really need to go and fucking get it,” he fiddles with his shoelaces. Castiel says something that Dean doesn’t hear because since when is tying your shoelaces so fucking difficult?! He pulls at them but only succeeds in tightening a knot on one of them.
Dean barely hears it and he certainly doesn’t get it. He squints confusedly at Cas, who’s looking down, “Uh, okay. Yeah, you’re pretty great.”
