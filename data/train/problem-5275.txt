“This bed should be burned,” Tony laughed, rubbing Steve's come off his stomach and onto the sheets.”
Tony couldn’t take it anymore. He let out a frustrated groan and stormed out of the room. Clint would be relentless in questioning the Winter Soldier but, by now, Tony knew the answer would always be the same.
He mourned for his loss. His melancholy was so great that it affected the dream. The brilliant bright colors darkened in the dreamscape and he could hear the faintest of whimpers permeate the air.
Without warning, his dad faded away, leaving Pops frozen over where he once lay. The look on his face was utter shock and heart-wrenching horror and it seared into Peter’s mind like a burning hot brand.
Steve always knew Tony was bi. If he was interested in Tony he probably would have come out sooner and tried to pursue a romantic relationship…
?” Tony retorted with emphasis and finally stopped his work to focus on Steve. His eyes flickered from Steve’s face and then to the baby pulling at his shirt collar. He quirked an eyebrow and asked, “Are one of the Commandos there?”
“Whatever you want, Buck,” Steve replied softly. He changed the subject to a lighter topic to calm him down and said, “…You know, earlier Peter asked me if you were his brother?”
He knew the first time would be painful for Peter but he had prepped him and found his G-spot from there he gave Peter so much pleasure that he couldn’t possibly feel anything else.
“A month,” the Colonel bit back. “I will not endanger my men because our specialist is impatient to get back to his toys.”
Did that mean Tony was going to get the reactor in his chest soon? He wished his son had revealed how that happened. He didn’t like not knowing…
Wade’s tears fell freely, thinking he was going to have to watch her take Peter from him with no way to stop her. She picked up Wade’s hand and all feeling left it as her touch leeched the life out of it. She pressed Wade’s hand over one of the wounds on Peter’s upper chest, careful not to touch the younger man.
The trial started off similarly to the hearing as they all rose for the judge and the clerk read off the charges. The main difference were the twelve jurors that entered the room.
Tony laughed, his eyes crinkling at the edges as he did, and he put his phone back into his pocket. He pulled on Steve’s hand and they went over to the empty spot on the couch. One by one, the others told them some of the more amusing things the media had come up with about their relationship. It was entertaining, sometimes it was alarming, and a lot of it was ridiculous.
When Tony returned to his side, his frown was a little deeper but he had his mug at the ready and his eyes zeroed in on the hot water in Gabe’s hands.
Peter’s eyes slowly spanned from his adopted father and to the spot he knew his birthfather to be minutes earlier. His mind could not comprehend what it was looking at, at first.
Steve began to kiss the side of his neck and put his hands under Tony’s shirt, feeling the skin beneath. He was still marveling at the fact that this was no longer fake. They both wanted each other and wanted to be together. With this knowledge, Tony felt so much more amazing. His pulse fluttered madly under Steve’s lips and his skin of his neck tasted like sea salt. Under his hands, he dragged his hands against Tony’s flesh and drew him closer so he could feel his arousal. Beneath him, Tony groaned and pressed back, gyrating his hips teasingly.
Bucky reached out and grasped Steve’s hand with both of his. His hold was gentle as if Steve was still small and dying and as fragile as fractured glass.
She loved him but was scared of losing him and irrationally angry with him for being an American because he might leave her because of what the Academy had done to him. She imagined him associating her with the Academy and it made her ill.
Keeping his hand over Wade’s racing heart, Peter leaned down and forwent answering him by kissing him.
Steve collapsed, clutching the pipe close to him like it was a lifeline. Tony stumbled more than stepped away from Pepper. He reached out to Steve and paused, his eyes drawn to something behind him.
Steve had stumbled upon one of the videos once and he watched it out of morbid curiosity. Thanks to the serum, he could remember every scene perfectly and he now imagined himself in the place of Tony’s partner. His cock throbbed – oh God – he would not be able to stand without Tony noticing.
And yes there is going to be a Part 3 to the series, which will be all about Steve, Bucky, and Tony!
. I-I can’t be with you and I can’t do this to him – please, stop, Bucky. I have already let this go too far. I’ve already hurt Tony too much. Please, get off me…
“Oh knee, oh knee, oh knee,” Tony sang to himself and Steve chuckled wetly. He reached forward and mussed the toddler’s hair, making the boy squawk.
One of the shelves had the last photo of Tony and his dad. He paused before it and was highly tempted to place the picture face down so he wouldn’t have to see his father. He’d only put the framed photo there because his investors would’ve thought it strange if he had no pictures of the company’s founder up. He regarded Howard’s serious face and again wondered what his father would think of all of this – of Iron Man – of how Tony was turning about the company…
Steve watched him for a few moments. Tony’s total concentration was in his work but his face was serene. He always loved to watch Tony work, it was a side of him very few got to see…
The breath caught in Tony’s throat and he gasped, “Pull up the files from earlier! The ones on my teammates or adversaries!”
What more could they do? Barnes had been cajoled, consoled, threatened, and a number of other things…but he refused to change his stance. He either said “Hail, Hydra” or asked Natasha for her real -.
Her instructor was swathed in dark clothing with only his head exposed. He was a handsome man with loose brown hair. His steely blue eyes met hers and their timers went off.
Steve felt like he was in the past again, riding on that train. But this time it was not Bucky falling to his death but Tony. Tony was too far to reach but he had to watch and listen to him die.
“Who the hell are you!?” Tony hissed, inching toward his bedside table where he had hidden his suitcase suit.
“I don’t see why not,” Sam replied and then the three standing men got to work moving machines without disconnecting them and pushing the beds until they touched. Sam lowered the bars between them and Steve reached out to Tony. Luckily, their beds connected on their good sides so they were easily able to hold each other’s hands. Steve smiled warmly at his husband and squeezed his hand.
“We are not analyzing the motives of Natasha Romanov at three in the morning!” Tony groaned, falling back onto his pillow with a light thump.
The idiom flew over Steve’s head and he looked at the woman questionably. Ms. Potts noticed and she stated, “It can’t get out that he’s gay…or I guess the more appropriate term would be bisexual…Either way, our investors will flip.”
Jarvis nodded curtly and said, “Very well. I will need the coordinates for the location and an order for the soldiers there so they know not to bother the suit while it hibernates.”
He clutched Peter closer to him and tried to grab Tony’s hand again but Tony stepped back, not letting him touch him. Peter suddenly felt like he weighed thousands of tons.
“It’s even better in concert,” Tony said. He sat up and watched Steve slide out of bed. He walked naked across the room and Tony was instantly hypnotized by his ass.
On the opposite side of the counter were some barstools. As soon as Wade put down his platter, Peter grabbed his hand again and dragged him over to them. Wade sat down stiffly and watched somewhat incredulously as Cap started to put food on the grill.
Tony continued once Steve caught his breath and his coughing cleared. He said, “But we can’t be chaste either. We’re going to have to be affectionate. We’re going to have to touch, always be in each other’s personal space, and…kiss. If you don’t want to, you still have a chance to back out now…”
“Why are you avoiding your problems with your dad?!” Wade retorted, his words gaining momentum. “The Peter I know would do all within his power to make all that is wrong,
“They managed to capture Stevie and not capture him all at the same time,” Bucky sighed, lightly touching the larger version of the shield.
Peter snorted and rolled his eyes. Even before Venom, Peter was a pretty good match up with Natasha. His Spidey-Sense was a formidable defense as was his flexibility and strength in offense. With Venom, this sparring was going to be Peter’s easy win.
For the next week and a half, Peter and Steve would meet and talk and be all secretive and it was driving Tony up the wall.
The super soldier heard his words and relaxed slightly as he lowered his shield. Rogers’ rage over nearly watching his friend being murdered in front of him melted away with the explanation and clarity dawned in his eyes.
Without delay, Rhodes reached into Steve’s suit and pressed down on the emergency release lever. He pressed it but shot back from him with a painful his as the metal burned him. At the same time, Tony's suit opened and he stepped out, much to Steve’s relief. He was not going to let himself believe he was really there until he saw him.
When Bucky returned, Steve's eyes were with him immediately. He looked strange in white and tugged uneasily at the suit as if he knew the pure white color was not suitable for him.
He looked down and saw Peter was in his embrace, sleeping with his face tucked into Wade’s shoulder.
He woke sometime later as she was doing this. He lazily blinked open his eyes and leaned into his touch. In a breathless whisper, he said, “
“Peter…you’re not the only one at fault here…Your dad…” Steve sighed heavily and Peter glanced up at the man. Upset was clear on his face.
She moved slowly so was just exiting the room as the quinjet came in for a landing. Steve rushed over to it and caught his husband just as he stumbled out of the vehicle. Tony slid from Clint’s hold to Steve’s with a relieved groan.
Pepper held up her hand to silence him and stated, “I could only love one part of you. I could only love Tony. My heart wasn’t strong enough to take on what was needed to love and accept Iron Man as well.”
“We don't have much food in the kitchen,” Steve murmured. All the food was kept in the main kitchen on the community floor. The Avengers always ate together…His mind flashed back to the countless meals he had shared, sitting next to Tony. He crumpled in on himself and murmured, “I don’t feel hungry.”
Ben knelt in front of them and enveloped his arm around Steve’s shoulders and placed a hand on the side of Peter’s face. Steve wrapped his free arm around Ben and pulled him tightly against him, burying his face in Ben’s neck. Ben’s cologne was sharp, nothing like Tony’s. Tony’s was brisk with a spicy hint but it was always subdued by the scent of motor oil and coffee.
“Martyr…” Tony whispered, the word left his mouth sluggishly but its implications made his spine tingle uncomfortably.
Howard’s shoulders twitched but kept his face passive. He worked side-by-side with Erskine. If he really wanted to…he could, but he swore to never create another again. He evenly replied to the agent, “No.”
Being back in Steve’s embrace felt like home. It was where he belonged. Keeping Steve in his arms, Tony stepped back and pulled him into
Tony woke to the sound of buzzing. He recognized the vibration as to belonging to his phone. He lifted his head and silently peered around the room. Peter was nestled into his side and was dozing quietly so he tempered his movements as to not disturb him.
“Stepan-not-Stepan,” she murmured teasingly when they finished and put the plate in the sink. The name was imperfect and he could feel the actual one waiting on the tip of his tongue, ready to roll out. But he was positive she would help him remember it.
“Jarvis, let’s go with a Junior Prom soundtrack,” Tony said with a grin that repressed his laughter. Slower, classical music started to play and Steve felt himself relax tremendously. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and nuzzled his face into Steve’s chest then began to sway back and forth. Steve found himself swaying with him. He wrapped his arms around him too and laid his cheek on top of Tony’s head. A small smile twitched at his lips.
“Yeah,” Steve replied, huskily. He nodded and repeated in a clearer voice, “Yeah. Yeah, I am…” He scooted closer to Tony and pulled him into his embrace. He held him for a moment, thankful he somehow made it into Steve’s life.
“We’ve been trying to do that the last five minutes!” Clint grunted, “It freaking isn’t easy even with the God of Thunder as backup!”
Memories, vivid in color and coldness, flickered in his mind. He saw a train on the edge of a snowy mountain side. He saw the Captain calling out to him.
“Hi, yes, thank you, Mr. Rogers – Captain, sir!” Wade garbled so quickly that neither man probably understood him.
Tony’s heart crumbled for the man but he kept up his front and he promised, “I’ll attend the ceremony and throw you guys the most amazing reception ever.”
Tendrils started to wrap around Steve’s limbs and Steve started pulling the substance toward his own body instead of away from the both of them. He begged, “Take me!
Bruce was smiling widely and looked as excited as a kid in a candy store. He was looking over older readings and then asked Coulson, “Where are the samples you took before you began the treatment?”
Steve paused and then dropped his head and whispered, “He’s more than just a friend…We were…lovers.”
From where he stood at the grill, he watched his friends splash around in the pool laughing and releasing excess energy. It was so ideal that Steve could almost pretend the charges against him were not really there and Susan Tyler did not exist.
“…He makes me happy and I know he’s different, and I like that…whenever I’m with him I feel just so relaxed and happy…I haven’t felt that since Gwen.”
“What level would you like to go to, sir?” Friday enquired. Peter glanced up at the camera in the corner and then back down to his hands.
Tony continued, “What the general public does not know is that I would not have lived, nonetheless escaped, if it were not for a man named Yinsen. When my suit was calibrating, the terrorists were coming and we realized we were not going to have enough time. Yinsen sacrificed his life so I would have a chance to escape. Yinsen was my friend and if my code only loaded faster he could have survived. I blamed myself for Yinsen’s death.” Tony pulled back and grasped Peter’s face. Peter’s tears were falling freely and he was surprised to see tears in Tony’s eyes as well.
“Well Natasha and I aren’t no fairy tale,” Bucky stated with a frown. “Our lives are more like a nightmare…”
The Red Skull looked at her, handed James a loaded gun, and grinned, “Kill her and then her companion.”
The Goblin could already be in this timeline and Steve knew the space time continuum was fickle. His and Cable’s presences may alter the Goblin’s plans and he wanted to be there for Tony if such a thing occurred.
Wade’s lip wobbled and then he threw himself at Peter, embracing him tightly. Peter’s sore body protested the handling but Peter’s full heart won out and he embraced his lover with all he had in him.
It was a relief but also strange. At first, he didn’t know how to spend that time so he started to devote more time to growing his empire…and then being with his family.
Howard nodded and started ordering the Commandos to various stations. He went up to the time machine and carefully removed the tesseract from its case and placed it into the one hole that seemed designed for it. Months prior, Tony had thrown Howard and his team out of the time machine in fear of him breaking it, luckily, his glimpse of its inner working gave him a vague idea of what connected to what but…operating the damn thing well…that was another story…
The familiar dark SUVs of SHIELD came tearing out of the trees and across the lawn. SHIELD agents jumped out and they surrounded them and started rounding up all their opponents.
The Goblin held his husband’s limp body and grinned at Steve as he pushed himself up. The Goblin sneered, “You’re just in time, Captain. I was just asking Stark which limb I should tear off first his arm or his leg. He can’t seem to be able to answer me so do you want to decide or shall I?”
SHIELD was the one that was most infiltrated. When they rooted out Hydra, because there was no “if” in this scenario,
It was like they were in some kind of romantic comedy. Steve had also literally fallen into their match too. How many times had he seen that in the cheesy romances? And the fact that they interacted before realizing they were soulmates? How much more cliché can they be?
Steve stared blankly at Bucky, his lips still tingling from being kissed so forcefully. He looked down at his lap as he processed his words. He made the conscious decision to speak the truth.
When they left the building, they exited right onto a busy street. There was a giant white shell on the outside of the building so Steve doubted they’d have any trouble finding it again. He silently followed Cable, his eyes always moving as he took in the new environment he was entering. The car plates immediately told him he was in California and, with all of the sand everywhere and the smell of salt in the air, it was obvious they were on the coast. But, California had hundreds of miles of coast, so his narrowed down list was still fairly large.
“And I have over two thousand souls following my direction!” Colonel Philips spat, “I will not endanger my men on your fancy. It will be a month and I will not hear another word about it from you, is that understood, Stark?”
Tony’s heart beat wildly against Steve’s chest and he grabbed onto Steve’s sides with a tight grip. They both pressed their faces into each other’s neck to protect their eyes from the sparks and burning light. When the Commandos retaliated with their own fire, the Hydra soldiers were forced to stop shooting and hunker down. The firing stopped and the two of them were finally able to breathe.
“Watching your back, you punk!” Bucky yelled somewhere behind them in the house, making Steve chuckle and finally look back to Fury. Tony too looked to the SHIELD director and was surprised to see Fury was no longer glaring at them. In fact, he could swear he was seeing a hint of a smile on the man's face.
“Tony?” Steve’s concerned voice made Peter jump away from Tony. Steve looked from Tony’s glassy eyes to Peter’s red, tearstained face and his look of concern evolved into total alarm.
“This isn’t enough for me,” Steve countered, holding up his bar. “My metabolism is burning it up within the hour. I won’t be able to go on much longer…”
They went into the elevator and Jarvis said, “Welcome back, Master Rogers, sir has been worried about you.”
He was originally going to move out with Steve and the Commandos but he didn’t want to get in their way. He also doubted he could keep from flirting with Steve or resist touching him so soon after their spectacular night and morning of love making. Being in such close corridors with the Commandos and other soldiers would mean they’d get noticed right away. Tony knew himself well enough not to risk it.
Tony laughed and Natasha rolled her eyes. She looked up to Thor and motioned to Barnes as she asked, “Can you help me with him?”
Gabe crawled into the tent with him and carefully checked him over. The entire team hovered nervously outside with Steve kneeling at the front of the tent looking inside. Bucky stood next to his friend with a supportive hand on his shoulder.
He meandered around the enormous building until he ventured into the gym. Once there he got into his usual routine, hitting the punching bag with rhythmic punches. He stayed in there, late into the night until his muscles burned and his fists ached.
“I am positive we will meet again,” Jarvis stated to him. “You are the smartest man of your century,
“I promise,” Steve whispered and he pressed another kiss onto Tony’s mouth. Tony’s arms snapped around him in an immediate embrace which Steve leaned into. He tried to pour every ounce of his love into that kiss and Tony replied similarly.
Peter slipped out of their embrace and Tony asked the time traveler, “That is the last of it right? No more time traveling? We don’t have to worry about anymore paradoxes or people disappearing?”
“I gave him ample opportunity to shoot me, here in front of the Tower and in Brooklyn. He did not. He must have had a reason to shoot but it was not to kill either of us.”
Steve hummed in agreement and let out a small, tired sigh as he settled down for sleep again. Tony’s adrenaline was still up from being shocked awake but he did try to relax too. He shifted his head over Steve’s chest to better hear his steady heartbeat and feel the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.
With absolute horror, he watched the same stranger walk back up the stairs holding his spare reactor.
Peter's flush deepened and a small smile twitched at his lips. He murmured, “You have such a way with words.”
The flight reminded him of his crash into the icy Atlantic. The cold bit into his skin and lungs. The air was like ice as it froze his insides. Frost collected on his hair and clothes. All his muscles shook with shivers and by the time he landed, he could barely stand from the shuddering.
Steve’s back was burned but he survived. He slumped into Tony and heard him exhale shakily. He too was alive.
“Oh,” Steve whispered, crestfallen. It was silly of him to think Tony…Steve made himself push the idea out of his mind. This was all fake. Tony was doing this to help him.
He ran his thumb over the soft flesh and felt her nipple puckering beneath. She pressed into his touch with a light huff and put her hand over his, pressing him deeper into his flesh.
“No,” Bruce said, placing a hand on Steve’s arm. Steve’s face was beet red and he was biting back a nasty retort. “It was Mary Parker. Hydra had kidnapped her and forcibly impregnated her with Steve’s sperm. They took it from him while he was still frozen. He had no idea what was going on. And Mary’s dead… So is Richard…”
?!” He nearly screamed Bucky’s name as his anger grew with Tony’s detached reasons. He finally turned back to the time traveler in his rage and saw Tony in a similar state as he was. Tony was crying and wore an expression of total anguish. Steve crumpled a little at the expression and he gasped tightly, "How could you do this..."
“Peter,” Tony said gently. The compassion in his voice made Peter pause. He had taken a single step into the elevator and he felt tears begin to burn his eyes.
Iron Man shrugged and replied, “When SHIELD found you, they realized you weren’t dead and brought you back. For what ends, I don’t know.”
, watch the clips of me standing up for my man!” Steve chuckled and Tony smiled. Tony ran his hand through Steve’s hair and promised, “You are going to beat this.”
“We’ll get to that when it becomes a problem,” Tony retorted with an eyeroll. He held out his hand to Steve and asked, “So, do we have a deal?”
Flushing, Steve pushed himself up to be sitting on his bottom and pulled his pants back on as they had fallen to his knees in his fall. He buckled his pants with a flush and demanded of the machine, “Why do you need to speak to me privately?”
Steve gently ran the backs of his fingers over Tony’s cheek and whispered, “I missed you too, love.”
“It seems we both do not agree with Venom’s digestive system. Venom did not eat you because you are so much like its host, it would have been like eating itself. And I, well, I am mostly metal, imitation flesh, and a pint of fake blood. After one bite, he spit me right out…but one bite was all it took,” she sighed upon her last statement as she looked down at her ruined body.
He began to breathe shallowly and Bucky said something but Tony didn’t hear it. All he could hear was the pounding of his heart.
Something blanketed his throat and he coughed to clear it and blood splattered his screens. He was hurt…hurt bad…
“That’s a long story…” Bucky sighed, there was movement behind Bucky and Steve’s heart shot into his throat as he looked over his shoulder.
Peter slept with Steve like he did every night but…that night the bed felt empty and cold. Steve constantly felt himself reaching out for Tony, only to meet open air. In the few weeks Tony had shared his bed he had grown accustomed to it. His absence was like another nail in his coffin.
Steve chuckled and leaned forward to steal a quick kiss. Their lips only touched briefly but it was further proof that this wasn’t all for show and that they both wanted to be together…Tony smiled goofily at Steve after the kiss and was tempted to lean forward and kiss his just as chastely.
The last time they kissed, Wade made Peter feel precious but now he was making him feel vital, like Wade needed him to survive.
“Yup and if you blow out all the candles you get to make a wish,” Steve whispered into his ear. Peter inhaled sharply as he took Steve’s words seriously. The song ended and everyone called for Peter to blow out his candles. Steve positioned Peter over the cake and said, “Blow on three. One, two, three!” Steve blew with him and they extinguished all three candles.
“Oh yeah…I did say that, didn’t I?” Tony stated, “Well, here, this is the hand command to open a hologram.” Tony demonstrated the movement. His thumb, pointer, and middle finger were extended with even space between each finger while the other two were parallel and touching. Jarvis’s cameras caught the movement and automatically opened a hologram for him. Bucky tried the movement and one opened in front of him too. “To close the holo, just pull the screen down with the same hand command and,
SHIELD had nearly all its agents on it and Thor and Clint were helping with what they could but nothing seemed to be able to stop Venom.
As soon as the word got out, reporters and paparazzi descended upon the tower in a great wave of human depravity. Steve stopped taking Peter out on walks, fearing he would be recognized. It was a hard thing to do. Peter had grown used to the routine and missed the zoo especially.
Steve came in a moment later with a handful of blankets under one arm and a flashlight in the other hand. No electricity meant no heater and it was going to get cold tonight.
Steve pulled away from Tony shooting his boyfriend an annoyed glare then descended on his son with smile. Behind him, Bruce and his sandwich slinked out of the kitchen and took refuge next to Natasha at the counter.
Steve cringed. Peter had inherited his super strength and it was both a blessing and a curse. Steve did not have worry about hurting Peter with his own superior strength but Peter did not know how to control his own power.
“Steve, I can totally see them together! Can’t you? They can be the next Brangelina, I’ll call them Natucky…no, that sounds like a state. How about Buctasha?! No, that sounds like a weird elk…What if we combine their codenames…Winterwidow…Wow, it’s almost poetic! We’re calling this Project Winterwidow! It sounds perfect!”
Not looking away from the stiff figure in the other room, Tony whispered, “…So, yes, I am going to let him sleep in one of the guest rooms. And,
He reached around a cameraman to open his own door. The cameraman saw this and he swung his huge camera around to catch one last image of Steve. The man, however, misjudged where Steve was going to go. Instead of filming Steve entering the car he hit him solidly across the head with the camera lens.
Tony nodded to himself and then went over to the toilet to flush it and add to his deception. He washed his hands in the sink and then returned to the bedroom.
Happy opened the door for them and Peter stepped out first. Wade’s eyes were glued to his ass as the muscles flexed from the movement. His hands were itching to go back to squeezing it.
Steve and Tony exchanged fond smiles. They never admitted it aloud but they loved to tell their story.
Tony sighed heavily and then reached between them to grasp Steve’s hand. He murmured, “That’s not all…or did you forget you made this crooked heart learn to love?”
“Couldn’t sleep,” Steve replied breathlessly, trying to look nonchalant as he looked at his half naked friend.
The best part, this was all him. It had no part in Howard’s legacy and with these suits he was going to make so much more of a difference than Howard ever did.
Steve nearly let it happen because it was so shocking and he did not know how to react for a second, but, he pushed Tony away and gasped, “What are you doing?!”
Steve went at the trickster with all he had. He had never faced such a foe before but he was determined to bring him down. By the way they were fighting, Steve guessed it would be a lengthy battle…until Iron Man showed up and put Loki down with one blast.
He wasn’t able to completely slip out of Steve’s hold completely however as Steve caught one of his hands before he could fully pull away. With a warm smile, Steve pulled Tony back to his side and carded his fingers with his. By the way Steve had a hold of him, they probably were not going to leave each other's sides the rest of the night.
Peter collapsed with Venom pooling around him like a coiled snake, protecting its nest. The gas only affected Peter but he was finally able to breathe because his mind was fogged and he was no longer thinking dangerous thoughts. Peter inhaled with great gasps, coating more of the gases into his lungs.
Coulson’s attention focused on the shoes. They weren’t Stark’s. Stark would never wear them nonetheless fit in them.
The shield was cold, burning cold, and it bit through his numb fingers and was forcing more cold into him that spread and burned like venom. He quickly clipped his shield onto his back and shook his hand to get rid of the painful feeling. More cold sunk into the flesh of his back but it was not as painful as the first initial touch.
Tony jerked away and hissed, “I love that boy like he was my own flesh and blood. I raised him with you. I helped feed him. I helped clothe him. I freaking love him more than myself.
Steve didn't want to give up hope but it was dwindling away. How was Tony going to escape a terrorist camp in the middle of a desert where no one who could help him knew where to look?
So Venom told his host of their impending demise, he frightened the boy, but the boy countered with thoughts of his sire’s bravery and wanting to emulate him. Images of the sire, younger, smaller, and weaker, came to his mind and his host felt reassured by them.
The traitorous sun eventually rose and he knew he was going to have to face the day. When he smelt the coffee, he knew Steve was up.
Steve peered sadly at Tony. Tony felt totally exposed with both his body and heart out on display for Steve. He could easily destroy him with the wrong words.
He confirmed that Bucky was alive and was the agent SHIELD called the Winter Soldier. He knew they would all look online later at the SHIELD released records about the Winter Solider but he briefly explained what happened to Bucky, hoping everyone would understand his old friend was not in control.
On the way to the kitchen, Tony couldn’t help his wandering hands from exploring. Steve let him until they reached the kitchen and he swatted him away just as they entered.
. They betrayed us, killed Richard, tortured me, and tried to kill me too! And Steve Rogers works for them!”
“Your suit legs are unsalvageable,” she sighed as she took in their clothes’ wrinkles. She took out her phone and sent out a text as she said, “I’m going to have to use the big guns on this one.”
“Good, Clint may be trained by SHIELD but he’s not as ruthless as those two when it comes to interrogation.”
When they got into the elevator, Steve whispered, “You said ‘our boys.’ You were including Wade too, weren’t you?”
Tony sat next to Steve and leaned heavily into him. He rubbed Steve’s back just as he rubbed Peter’s and left his hand resting in the dip of his lower back.
Steve happened to come across the kitchens. The food service personnel already searched it and prepped it for breakfast tomorrow. Steve quickly peeked into the walking pantry and grabbed an apple and a loaf of bread. When had Tony last eaten?
Tony was obnoxiously playing a song over the communicator that kept repeating “Another one bites the dust” and was mostly fighting on his own. He didn’t follow Steve’s directions or commands and, as such, got in the way. By the end of the battle, they were both sniping at each other over the coms.
“If Cap goes to the fundraiser with Stark, then we calculate his true identity will be discovered within fifteen minutes –
Bucky was on him before he could finish his rant. He cupped his hands around his neck and kissed him so hard all the breath escaped Steve’s lungs.
“Then we will hang it with the rest,” Tony stated. “And everytime I see you looking at it, I am going to make you happy until just looking at it reminds you of that and makes you happy.”
Natasha threw the box at Steve and he caught it. Natasha stepped away, saying, “Next time don’t mess with me, Stark.” She came to a stop in front of Bucky and said, “You. Me. Training room. I’ll show you the merits of rushing into something. Mainly, your face rushing into my fist.”
He kept trudging on but doubt began to fester in his stomach. What if the sun was in a different position because of this midnight sun phenomenon? What if he was miles –
As he pushed himself on his elbow and reached for his phone to check the time, and a hand suddenly hooked itself on his hip. Peter jumped and turned to face the person in his bed, only to impact his face into Wade’s chest.
Tony didn’t make a noise as Sam stitched him up but he did hold Steve’s hand tightly with one hand and worked on the laptop with the other. Steve stroked the hand in his hold with his thumb and, whenever their eyes happened to meet, Steve smiled at him. Each time he saw that smile, Tony’s entire body flushed with endorphins. Yup, he was head-over-heels in love.
Steve happened to glance to his right and saw Bucky also looking. His best friend wiggled his eyebrows in Tony’s direction and Steve looked away with a huff.
She caught sight of him kissing Laura again and looked away sharply. She felt a tingling against the skin of her forehead as she remembered James pressing a kiss there and she rubbed the spot to dispel the feeling and memory.
“I’m fine, but what about you?” Steve implored. “The last I saw you, you were shot and were not moving.”
Tony quickly discovered that if someone did not have an address or made no income it was nearly impossible to find him.
“…How do we send them on a mission with a romantic outcome?” Steve questioned Tony, referring back to their prior conversation.
Tony did not notice Steve and was staring miserably at Peter’s workstation as he swayed from his inebriation.
His notebook slid from his lap with his waking and he squawked loudly as he caught it. He grinned sheepishly at Tony, but his son continued to frown at him…a look he’d grown used to seeing…
With his upper body exposed, the cold was even worse, making his mind hazy and his vision off center. He lurched more than walked toward the people and prayed they wouldn’t shoot him down.
Sam laughed, placing both hands on his hips, and Steve sputtered, spitting out the water from the water bottle he’d just taken a sip from. Tony purposely said “my” and Sam did not seem to notice but Steve did blush a little around his cheekbones.
Steve’s heart rate picked up and he leaned in closer as he ran his fingers along Tony’s scalp. He kept at it for a couple of minutes and Tony’s hand left the back of his neck and began to do the same to Steve's hair. Steve did not think it was possible but he had to bite back a moan under the touch.
“Steve, drop it. I did. She clearly does not want me, and even though I remember, she still hates me,” Bucky hissed.
Howard gently turned the man over so he was laying in a more comfortable position, and then mopped up the excess sweat and tears. Even in sleep, he looked distraught.
“No,” Peter stated loudly, for both Happy and Wade. “I don’t want to see my father right now. Period. I’ll call you if I need you, Happy.”
Tony pulled off the goggles and caught Steve’s hand before he could pull back. He kissed the palm of his hand and whispered into his flesh, “He’s your best friend and last year was nothing. There is no need to thank me. I love you, Steve.”
Cable was hunched over at the table as always but he sat up sharply when Steve burst into the room. Cable asked him something but Steve didn’t hear him. He went to the side table beside the bed and grabbed the photo he had left there.
A minute passed and the danger of the nuclear blast coming through was becoming imminent. With a painful gasp, Steve hissed, “Close it.”
Yet with the daylight the shadows were obliterated and with it his hiding places. SHIELD found him before the sun had even fully risen. The agents could not capture him, he dodged whatever they threw at him and slipped out of all the traps they had.
Steve was in the hands of his greatest enemy and God only knew what the madman was doing to his soulmate.
“He ate breakfast…” She glanced at the clock. Steve knew it to be sometime around 8 o’clock and she clarified, “He ate breakfast in the
Steve came to the scene with the rest of the team in a quinjet. It was the first time in years since he had arrived as such. Usually, he and his husband flew together and were the first on scene…
“Hmmm, I just saw a six foot, blond man, carrying a certain shield. He kinda looks like your guy,” she stated and began to disassemble her rifle.
“Logan says a lot of things don’t smell right,” Steve countered. “He even says Vision doesn’t smell right and Vision is one of the nicest people I have ever met.”
Upon his blank expression, Natasha expression became venomous and she informed him, “I am his godmother. There are no other suitable candidates.”
He slumped in Cable’s hold and the larger man slowly let go of Steve. When Steve made no move to go running after Tony, Cable grumbled, “Grab some food. We’re getting the hell back to the apartment pronto.”
Within his host’s mind, thoughts of his host’s family battled against Venom’s tactics. The memory of the super-humans acted as a shield and provided a hopeful resolve in the boy that was going to be their downfall.
He was not a religious man but he sent out a prayer to whatever higher power might be listening and thanked them for his boy…he paused, with his face buried in Peter’s thick hair, and silently asked that higher power to preform another miracle and bring back his husband as well.
Peter texted Wade about what they were going to do and the other man was cryptically vague. All he knew was that Wade wanted him to web over to the roof of a building downtown at 8 o’clock.
“Tony??” Steve gasped with concern, sitting up beside him. Tony collapsed into Steve’s side, gasping shallowly to catch his breath. Steve wrapped his arms around him and asked, “Tony, love, what’s wrong?”
Rogers tipped his head to the side and said, “Yes, in so many words, yes. He wanted to say more but did not know what to say.”
“T-Tony?!” Steve gasped, his throat was so coated in ash and dry that his attempted yell was no louder than a whisper. He erupted into a coughing fit after speaking. Had he really heard him?! Was Tony there? He looked wildly around for any sign of him.
Howard bent down and stuck his head in the oven. The machine was simple in its build and he saw no obvious tampering, but his perfectly well-built oven was spewing noxious fumes.
Just as his mind was winding down and exhaustion was muting his thoughts, did the priority alarm go off. The Avengers were needed. Steve groaned and punched the mattress.
Tony whistled and murmured appraisingly, “Very nice…but, we could straighten out your tie a little…”
“He already had a few medical classes under his belt for his degree and has been studying it more recently for the team,” Peter explained, closing his eyes, still feeling a little tired. "He wanted to do more than Smash!"
Yet being the only child of Tony Stark did not equate to such a life. He’d been lucky so far but it ran out on Monday, August 8th.
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and groaned when his lover bit into the flesh of his shoulder. Steve, always thinking of his needs first, assaulted his flesh with playful nips and a lavishing tongue. Steve was a virgin when they first made love but he was a fast learner and already knew the majority of Tony’s sweet spots.
He didn't interact much with the man but had heard varying stories about him from the rest of the team. He didn't know how to pin him. What kind of man was he?
He pulled the flute out of Steve’s grasp, lightly caressing his fingers as he did. Steve's eyes darkened a shade and Tony hurriedly turned around so Steve would not see his blush.
Steve flushed and glanced at Tony. His fiancé was already looking at him and was smiling excitedly. Steve grinned at him and only him. He reached out for his hand and Tony grasped it tightly. Not looking away from his lover, Steve said, “You know him very well, Marston.”
“What happened with Barnes?” Tony asked. Steve dropped his eyes and flushed with shame. Tony read him too easily.
It was one of the happiest moments in his life and you could see the joy in both his and Steve’s faces.
“Full circle will be getting you two home,” Cable said. He held out his hand and grumbled, “Let’s go now before any of these guys think to keep us here any longer. I want to get this over with.”
“Boys, stop fighting,” Agent Coulson murmured dryly over the comm. “What’s the situation like over there?”
“When I first got my glove back, I went back in time to the day the Goblin had left on the glove to verify the reactor was all the Goblin took and then I went back further in to the past to set up this hideout,” Cable replied, walking over to his table and dropping the time glove on it. He went on, “To you, it’s been less than an hour since Stark died. To me it’s been weeks. I’ve set us up for success the best I could but there is one more thing I need.”
Dr. Calvin looked up sharply from her desk and hissed, “Control your temper! Your emotions are only to be used to convince the targets of your sincerity!”
“I need your help, Cap. Seriously, I can’t do this without you and…well, with you knowing I am more than a machine, I was hoping you’ll be able to see how dire my situation is. I am a person, not a machine. I have people back home: friends and loved ones, another life waiting for me. Hell, I’m a superhero too! My tech is needed to help people! I’m not just a piece of technology and I needed someone to see. I need your help and compassion…and maybe some access to food and water...AND coffee! Definitely coffee!...You wouldn't believe the caffeine headache that's been plaguing me! So...Will you help me?”
Frustrated tears burned his eyes and he wanted to tear out his hair. Instead, he gently grasped Tony’s hand and then Tony gripped his hand like he was about to fall off a tall cliff.
“Money, showboating, revenge…the possibilities are endless,” Tony replied in a low whisper so Clint wouldn’t overhear them. “But whatever it is, we’ll save his family in the end. No matter what.”
happen….” Tony carded his fingers together and tightly twisted them. He continued, “It could break you more than anything physical like this…” Tony motioned to his chest and frowned unhappily at the ground.
“The Chameleon was paid in cash,” Bucky stated. He sat down heavily next to Steve and stole some toast off his plate.
He felt a flare of anger as he remembered Steve berating him not twenty minutes ago. Why did all the bad crap keep happening to him? He survived the Ten Rings…for this? He had made himself survive for a soulmate who’d  love him and he’d love in return. Of all the people on the planet, why did his mate have to be the prick who called him incompetent after saving his life??
Tony was true to his word and returned to his workshop. He went straight to work on Bucky’s new arm, wanting to give him back full mobility as soon as possible. He started straight from scratch, grabbing materials that originally would have been used in the Mark 19. He tried to keep it close to the original design however to make it easier for Bucky to move and to be less distracting to him. He must have been used to the arm by now and any major changes would be disconcerting. Tony wanted to make everything perfect for Bucky so he put his entire concentration into his work.
Tony ripped the ridiculous raincoat off Steve and pushed him onto the couch. He made quick work of his own clothes and he slid his naked body against Steve’s with a loud moan.
“Just started…” Gabe observed to Tony, “The bleeding has pretty much stopped but you are going to get a little scar.”
Peter automatically curled into Tony’s side and buried his face into his torso. It made Bruce’s heart ache. Peter was usually so talkative and happy, he saw no signs of that right now.
Tony pulled himself out of the hug and finally took notice of Peter’s clothes. He was wearing his white intern lab coat.
“Don’t do it,” Peter gasped instantly. He must have been conscious of everything and it broke Steve’s heart. In the last week, there were so many things Peter should not have experienced let alone witnessed.
The metal suit was like an oven, worsening the effect. He began to sweat profusely, his only solace was that the face shield was open.
Tony snorted and caressed the side of Steve face with his thumb as he asked, “For the kiss? You are most
Steve leaned forward until most of his weight was on his hands. He heard Tony make a sound of protest but he did not look at Tony or Bucky. He did not want to see Tony’s reaction. He crawled, keeping his head tilted up so he can watch the Red Skull and make sure he did not attack him in this vulnerable position.
“Master Parker, I have sent out the Mark 53 to retrieve you. Please, wait for the suit to pick you up.”
Wade gazed at Peter with eyes full of love and he murmured, “When it’s concerning you, baby boy, I can make no such promise.”
His kidnapping and Obadiah’s betrayal was long behind him and Tony was working toward the future. He was changing his company, making it more ecofriendly and creating products for the everyday consumer instead of weapons for war mongers.
“Hello, Stark. Nice to hear from you. How am I you ask? Having a pretty shitty day,” Fury sarcastically replied in just a loud of a voice. “Why you ask? Well, a defrosted super solider just escaped one of the most secure facilities in the world and we have no idea where he’s going or the state of his mental condition. Is this worrisome? Maybe. Why? Probably because I keep having flashbacks of two months ago when Bruce Banner, another super powered human, Hulked out practically destroyed Harlem. Should I be worried about what a man who is emotionally compromised by the situation thinks? I think the fuck not.”
The windshield imploded as a metal arm broke through it and robbed their car of its steering wheel. Sam instantly slammed on the breaks and a figure was thrown from their car.
The outside world was obstructed by the files opening for the check. Tony started going through all the systems’ files, looking for even the tiniest of changes. He asked the AI, “How many hours of footage do you have before we came to this era?”
“Holy shit,” Tony cursed. He looked at Steve with shocked eyes but Steve did not understand his reaction so Tony gasped, “That –
Two different forces looking for Steve. Who will find him first? (Hint: it's in the title for chapter three!)
With his dick no longer ruling his mind, Steve’s rational side surfaced immediately and Steve clutched his face with a groan.
Fury narrowed his eye as he listed to the explanation. It sounded valid with the exception of one thing: “And your wanting the research on Project Rebirth? How do you explain that?”
When they returned, Tony was cleaned up and his arm was in a sling, but he was still smiling. They were in each other’s arms again in seconds and Tony murmured, “I’m going home.”
Ever since they held hands at breakfast, he found himself reaching out to her more. They’d hold hands walking down the street, driving in the car, or eating together. They’d lean into each other’s sides whenever next to each other. And whenever she caught him staring at her, she’d smile and he was beginning to smile in return.
All of the blood leeched out of James’ face and he gasped, “Please, don’t. She was only doing what I asked. It was all me since the beginning.
“Can I make you something else? Or I can order something from the café? What can I do for you, Tony?”
Dum Dum had been a family friend and had worked with his father a lot in SHIELD matters. He would’ve been the first that Tony would’ve called.
The stark fact that Bucky was the only one strong enough to lift him came to him in an instant and it was followed by an even worse revelation: Tony wouldn’t have let Bucky carry him away without trying to stop him.
Venom shrieked at him as he took a step forward. Wade kept moving and Venom grew in mass as if in warning. When maybe five feet separated them, Venom attacked. Spiked tendrils stabbed Wade in the shoulder and his opposite thigh. Wade gritted his teeth and taunted, “Shish-ka-bobs, again? Don’t you have anything else on the menu?”
“I need to hear you say that today is about us and only us,” Steve whispered, his lips were teasing the corner of Tony’s mouth.
“I saw her at Oscorp Tower,” Harry explained with a pinched brow, looking back to the photo. He studied her image for a moment and stated, “She works for my dad.”
Bucky slowly leaned forward then placed the gun near his feet at the foot of the bed. He leaned back and Clint shot forward and grabbed it before Bucky changed his mind. Natasha kept her gun on Bucky and hissed to Clint, “Search him.”
Cold fingers curled into Steve’s hand and carded between the joints of his fingers. It was a familiar touch, not the touch of a stranger but a loved one and in this case, a man he loved dearly. Steve froze. He would know that touch anywhere.
Tony’s eyes flickered up and saw it was 4:42 a.m. He hadn't gotten a wink of sleep. He groaned lightly, turned in Steve’s arms, and pressed his face against his chest. Steve mumbled something and wrapped his arms around him tighter. God, he was perfect. Why did he love Tony? How did he get so lucky to win over Steve ‘Fucking-Fantastic’ Rogers?
Steve tried to gulp but his throat was suddenly dry. Tony was close, close enough that he could kiss him. He was tempted to do just that and then explain after that he was practicing for later. He looked from his friend’s warm eyes then to his parted lips and faltered.
“Steve’s got a piece of Venom on him! We’re going to the lab!” Clint stated from Steve’s side as he peered at the said substance.
Tony heard two beeps as Jarvis tried to access the information and failed. The AI stated, “I am unable to access the data. All information not pertinent to the running of the suit seems to be gone.”
,” Tony retorted sharply, stepping beside Steve. “No one in the science community has seen either of them in years and their own family thinks her dead! What were we to think?”
“Rightie-o, kid, we aren’t going to give up your dad that easily,” Clint said, slinging an arm over Natasha’s shoulder.
Eddie sat at the metal table rocking back and forth as he stared at the agent in front of him. Under his skin, he could feel Venom moving and making their bond stronger with every passing second.
Venom’s head jerked and, to everyone’s absolute surprise, it replied with a tortured, harsh voice, that wasn’t Peter’s and made Tony’s hair rise. It couldn’t speak intelligibly and murmured, “D-D-D-.”
Maybe his old friend was unable to follow him to Brooklyn, maybe he was waiting for him at the tower…He tensed his shoulders and cranked the throttle on the gas.
“Barnes, we know you did not join them willingly. Can you tell me anything about how you became indoctrinated into their program?”
Tony continued, “The one we keep talking about? A dinner date on the roof and dancing in my lab? We don’t have to lie about it anymore if we actually do it. How does that sound?”
Tony regarded his son’s slumped form worriedly. He carefully lay his hand on Peter’s back and rubbed light circles into it. He whispered, “Maybe you should just change your M-O. Don’t wear the uniform under your clothes anymore.”
Raising Peter raised many eyebrows and drew more eyes and scrutiny on both him and Steve, but he would not change it for anything.
As if reading his mind, Natasha said, “Pepper has him barricaded in his apartment. She didn’t want him to run on to the stage in the middle of the speech and say something stupid about SHIELD. He isn’t too happy with our organization at the moment.”
Steve’s heart stopped and he could barely take a step toward his soulmate before being pulled back into the darkness.
“I am never going to be able to fight with a straight head with that knowledge now,” Tony murmured and Steve shuddered violently as Tony’s cold fingers slid into his pants and gripped his penis. He gently pulled Steve out but he was already hard and every touch was wondrous torture.
“I think he just needs to stop patrolling the streets and fight when he's called into action, not when it's spur of the moment,” his father murmured under his breath.
Pops’ brows knitted together and he whispered, “We just want to make sure we are not rushing her into this. She does not remember you being born and Hydra did a lot of bad things to her…We just want to make sure she is ready…”
Norman smothered a chuckle by taking another sip of his foamy beverage. The café was positioned more for the view of the ocean, but Norman wasn’t facing the Pacific. The ocean was to his left and, in front of him in the distance, he could just make out Stark’s old mansion.
Wade halted as his eyes took in the flawless pure blackness of the figure and his eyes eventually trailed to the ass (because, hey, he was human) and he’d recognize that ass anywhere.
Nevertheless, there was absolutely nothing Tony could do about it. He was a man out of time falling for a man fated to die soon. It was an atrocious twist of fate.
The Soldier slithered over to the light switch and turned on the overhead light. The shadows were chased away from the illumination but nothing in the small room was seemingly amiss.
“Eh, I’ve got ten minutes to twelve. I think I have a valid enough argument to say it’s still morning,” Peter replied with a smirk to the older woman’s back.
He was probably so brainwashed that he would act on his master’s command with no question. He’d even kill her if his master wanted it. He would have no choice or control.
It’d also been even longer since he last felt this urge to want to make someone laugh like Steve did as they danced.
“H-Have you and Mary f-found anything since then?” Tony asked, fighting with all his soul to keep his voice steady and his eyes dry in front of Bruce. He had to be strong for Bruce, he was always there for Bruce and he did not want his friend to doubt his strength…and at that moment all of Tony’s strength had shriveled into a thin, gossamer barrier that would hold up to nothing. He forced his mind to not think about Steve’s grisly fate and focus on the science.
Tony grinned as he grasped the corner of his jaw and guided him down to his face. They kissed lightly and Tony’s earlier words became prophetic. The world around them blew up with light and voices and Steve’s own heart seemed to explode from his bliss.
But mostly he'd yearn for his oddly put together family. He already missed Rhodey's friendly barbs and Pepper’s soothing voice… What were they going though? How were they handling his disappearance? Would it be like when he was taken by the Ten Rings? Or would they hold out hope that Tony would make it back like last time? How long would they wait for him?
His suit opened and faces were suddenly hovering above him. He recognized no one, but he knew that would change soon. Jarvis probably notified his friends of his return as soon as he confirmed the connection.
It took the man a minute to do but, the amount of steps, Tony was already missing his canned shaving gel…
Steve turned off the screen and looked outside. He stared unseeingly at the landscape they drove by and darkly pondered where his son was.
His heart began to race when it was less than a minute. This was it. This was the moment he and Bucky had dreamed about and it was finally becoming a reality. Steve was smiling, excited and scared but, mostly exhilarated that the impossible was actually going to come to pass.
“Why didn’t you tell us this was happening?” Bucky demanded, ignoring Tony’s weak attempt at a joke. He crossed his arms over his chest and glared at Tony, waiting for a serious response.
Tony woke with a startled gasp that made Bucky jump and his adrenaline immediately burn away any boredom he had been feeling.
She was just a child but had been in the Red Room Academy long enough to know not to hope for something as fantastical as true love or a soulmate. Her life was dedicated to the Academy. There was no time for anything else. When her timer displayed a countdown of over sixteen years, she had no reaction.
”Looks like we’ve got a few stragglers,” Peter murmured, gently touching the cut on Tony’s neck. “Back to the pack guys...guys, c’mon!”
Steve gave up and turned forward. Tony was driving and Steve glanced at him. His husband’s hands were strangling the wheel of his car in a vicelike grip. Was all his anger direct at Norman? Did Tony suspect ulterior motives? Or was he nervous like Steve?
Tony did not seem to notice and rounded the corner of his counter, heading straight to Steve. He shoved himself into Steve’s personal space and Tony pointedly reminded him, “This is a date. As in romantic, more than friends, man on man date. With me, Tony Stark, a man with male genitalia. You are still willing to do this?”
“I had observed the entirety of the confrontation and determined it’d be best to bring Mr. Wilson to you,” the AI retorted.
It’d been over twenty-five years since Tony and Steve had traveled to the future…but some days it felt like it happened just last week…
Coulson wanted to reach out and pat his shoulder but he knew the action would be unwanted. Coulson sighed and stated, “Captain, I swear to you, I will bring you proof that Stark is alive as soon as I can...”
And, if he paused, he would hear their whispers again. He could never make out what they were saying but he knew it was about him. It made him feel self-conscious and anxious.
Steve sighed heavily and then opened the hologram Tony had been trying to hide from him. The image that appeared was a rough sketch of a robotic man.
“Kill me,” Steve finished for him. “…Yes, I know that is a possibility. Yet I would rather die than willingly let Peter die instead.”
Steve ran his fingertips over the scar on Tony’s stomach. His belly contracted beneath his touch as he repeatedly thrust himself upon Steve’s cock. The white patch of scar tissue was more sensitive than the rest of his skin and Tony trembled as Steve touched him there.
?” Both Natasha and Bruce gasped for clarification simultaneously. They both looked at each other and then Natasha looked at Steve and Bruce looked at Tony.
The detail ended up being delayed which soured Steve’s mood. The extra hour it took them to arrive could have been spent with his son.
Steve reached out to Tony from where he fell but the man would not move. They killed him. They actually killed him.
Hours had passed and it grew late. The Avengers looked tired but were also determined. They wanted to help Peter.
He remembered her calling out a name before he attacked her. She was speaking to him. It must have been “his.”
Grinning cheekily, Tony undid his jeans and let gravity take over in dropping them. He was naked underneath and Steve could not look away from the sight. He'd seen plenty of naked men in the army but the fact that Tony was aroused because of him…Steve near about came at the sight. He so badly wanted to kiss and touch him but he remained where he was on the bed and waited for Tony.
“You gonna make us lunch?” Bucky asked skeptically, looking at the can in Steve’s hand like it was useful as a sack of potatoes.
He held up Peter and said, “He is going to look so adorable with your shield or my reactor on his chest!! He’s not going to wear anything else!!”
“…You?” Steve gasped, “A man? Wh-who? When did this happen?” He reached over to Peter and grasped his arm. He gently said, “This…you’re worried about your feelings?”
For half a second, Steve was 100% certain this was it. This was the moment they were going to die and wipe out their future to reflect the blankness of the photo.
He fell back and inhaled deeply, closing his eyes as he did. The left side of his face still burned terribly but his right side itched more than burned, attesting to his healing.
Hulk caught Tony before Thor could leap and landed roughly beside them. Steve scrambled to where Hulk dropped Tony. Thor was at his side and ripped the face plate off Tony’s face. Steve worriedly touched Tony’s chest and his acidic fear burned into him again as he saw his arc reactor was not lit.
“Crap,” Tony hissed as he looked down at him. The air on his burning skin felt amazing and he leaned heavily into Tony. His skin was bright red and had blistered in a few places. Steve reached under his uniform and pulled his dog-tags off where they had burned into his skin with gritted teeth. He let the metal chain fall from his grasp and the warped dog-tag bounced lightly off the white star of his uniform.
Peter paused to stare at Wade's erection as it bounced back on to his stomach. His face was unreadable and Wade fearfully wondered if he was having second thoughts. Even his cock had the ugly scars...
“Thank you,” Steve coolly stated and dropped his hand. He shifted his gaze to the side and stepped past Tony.
Peter shook his head and said, “I only recently got her to grudgingly accept you are a part of my life. Dinner with Steve might be pushing it. I still haven’t broken it to her that you two are dating. I don’t think she will want to go either way...”
“Turn the camera back to me,” the Red Skull commanded. As the camera turned, he ordered, “And give the Captain another round of treatment since he is sitting in the chair already and is so adamant about its lack of power.” Schmidt smiled at the camera and said, “I’m sure this has found its way to my fugitives and I have your attention by now. SHIELD is gone and Hydra is supreme. I am done expending resources searching for you. Turn yourselves over to me and I will be lenient with some of you and not so much with others. Do nothing and I will continue to break apart your Captain until all that is left is the shell of a man. I will make that shell a soldier for Hydra and then I will make him hunt every last one of you down until you are all dead. Your choice. Welcome to the new world order. Hail, Hydra.”
So I was hoping to post this sooner but real life reared it ugly head and prevented that from happening! But here it is! The next chapter! It can't get any worse for the superfamily... or can it? Hmmmmm...
Tony groaned again and automatically wrapped his arms around himself. Steve murmured, “We’ll just keep each other warm.”
“You’re lying,” the General growled, raising his gun higher, pointing it directly between his eyes. “My sensors led me right to him. He has the same gamma-radiation in his blood as Banner. You cannot save his son with false words! As soon as I heard he had spawned a child I came straight here and waited for one of you to bring him out of the safety of your tower fortress! The Hulk is already a curse on this world. His offspring will only bring about the
The suit sealed itself and then nodded to Tony as Jarvis took control. From the suit, Jarvis replied, “Yes, Sir,” and then took off.
Steve’s face went beet red and Tony was not sure if it was from anger, mortification, disgust, or a combination of all three.
He no longer spoke with a toddler’s lisp and had found a voice and, like Tony, was always talking and making jokes.
“Steve better be with it,” Tony gritted through clenched teeth. He did not know what to think if he only found Steve’s shield. Steve never let out of sight. If need be, Tony knew he was able to tear down this entire building to find his friend.
When he was orphaned in his late teens, Tony threw himself into his work. It was through this work he created DUM-E, the beginnings of Jarvis, and most importantly, the code that would become the cornerstone of SI Online.
– Peter, neither one of us would have done that…which makes us innocent. Eventually, I learned how to control Hulk…but I can still lose control if I am suddenly angered... Do you want to know how I live with myself?”
“No need to explain, Captain,” Natasha said. “I had half guessed it already by the way you had kissed me. You just artfully confirmed it with your stuttering.”
Like most people of this century, he checked his phone and noticed he missed a call from his old family friend and texted him back letting him know they were alright.
Tony put his hand over Steve’s, pressing Steve’s palm into the warm reactor. He whispered, “I know how you feel.”
As the bullets pierced his armor, Tony’s first thoughts were on his own stupidity and admiration for the Soldier. The man was fighting with armor piercing rounds. The only thing that could stop such bullets was Vibranium or Adamantium.
Steve snorted and pushed himself up. Steve struggled which made Tony frown and all his good feelings dampened. He quickly stood and helped his not so super soldier to his feet.
Tony smiled sadly at him and forewent answering his question by whispering, “You should be sleeping in a bed.”
Thor raised his hammer as Coulson struggled to get to his feet just outside the door. The agent managed to gasp, “No! Wait-!” before Mjölnir released another shockwave.
“Our futures have a way of happening quicker than we thought they would,” Steve stated, taking another sip of his coffee. Tony leaned into him and, after a short pause, whispered to Steve, “Sometimes it feels like just yesterday I fell through Hydra’s time machine and into your life…”
Steve was peering down at the floor. Tony carefully laid his hand on the top of his head. His light blond locks were darker when wet and hung heavily from his scalp.
Despite the annoyance of having to deal with the vultures, Tony and Steve did not let them upset their lives. They went out regularly and ignored the press the best they could. Out of all the Avengers they got it the worst but it was something they had come to expect.
Tony had built a special scanner for his chest alone as the reactor and metal shards were the worst things to put into an MRI machine. Jarvis brought it out of the containment storage in the floor below and DUM-E was lightly tapping it when Tony reached the workshop.
The Captain lifted his gaze and Coulson was struck by how young the man looked. The Captain may have been born decades before Coulson had been born, but in body and mind, Rogers was a decade younger. His glassy, blue eyes only added to his youthful appearance.
The Chitauri swarm over New York like a plague of locus. Steve directed everyone to their places and where they would be most beneficial but, if they don’t get that portal closed, the battle would not end in their favor.
Tony rushed back to the counter put something onto his hands and then rushed back to Steve. He clapped his hands right back on to place where they had been seconds before on his jaws. Steve smelt the sharp but pleasant smell of what must’ve been the after-shave Tony had been going on about and he smirked at his fiancé.
He could have hated Tony. He could have never forgiven him for what he did...but Steve did not want to live the last days of his life such.
From another room, Tony watched Wanda manipulate the orb Venom was encased in. Vision stood before her, watching her every move with his unblinking gaze. Wanda ignored him in favor of concentrating on her task. She was hardening the orb, making it impossible to escape and give it the ability to be held without Wanda’s intervention. Once she was done, Vision would take the orb and throw it into the sun, destroying that monster once and for all.
“We need to know being frozen for over 70 years didn’t impair you. We need to know you are mentally stable and won’t go on a killing spree when someone makes you angry.” In the back of his mind, images from the calamity of Harlem flash through his mind and he repressed a shudder. If the Captain turned out to be as volatile as the Hulk…a cold shiver ran down his back at the thought.
“It feels like we’re taking this all at high speed and I can barely keep up,” Steve sighed. “I mean, we
Tony shook his head and unconsciously stepped closer to Steve, murmuring, “No, it was my fault. I initiated it.”
He straightened his back then met both of their gazes bravely. Either way, he would show them that Spider-Man was someone who was just as strong as them and did not flinch in the face of whatever trial they presented him.
"Ready to work, loverboy?" Natasha asked Steve. Instead of blushing like he had yesterday, Steve paled.
Bucky nodded and Tony was starting to feel unnerved by his gaze. He hadn’t blinked since they locked eyes.
It was strange to think that he once feared being ousted as a gay man and what he had with Tony was once a far, far away dream.
Tony led him to the lineup of press. They paused to pose for pictures. They wrapped their arms behind each other and they both hooked their hands on the other’s waist. They smiled and ignored all the questions being thrown their way.
Steve stared down at Tony’s tranquil, sleeping face. His hair was mussed and his goatee was hilariously pointed and disheveled. He had never seen him look so relaxed and he loved it. Lines seemed to have disappeared from his face and Steve gently reached out and traced where they should have been. He tried to ingrain this side of Tony into his memory so he could sketch it later.
Out of nowhere, Tony and Point Break were pushed off each other by the rebound of Steve’s shield. The man himself yelled out, “Hey! That’s enough!” Steve caught his shield as he jumped into the clearing. He looked to Tony and Tony jerked his gaze away. He internally called Steve all sorts of nasty names. Steve’s mouth tightened as if he could hear Tony’s inner monologue and he turned to Point Break and diplomatically said, “I don’t know what you’re doing here...”
Tony dropped his hand and grasped Steve’s arm, his eyes were only for the super soldier. The emotions in both of their gazes made Bucky feel like an intruder, more so as Tony wetly gasped, “Steve…I might only have minutes. My – My heart’s beating so fast and it’ll just make me go faster.”
The Soldier nodded and ignored the implant like his master commanded. It became another item at his disposal and nothing more.
Steve was the first to see him from his spot in the kitchen, facing the bedroom. His eyebrows shot up in surprise. He was wearing his running attire and his companion was dressed similarly. Steve’s acquaintance turned around and smiled in greeting as he recognized Tony.
Overhearing them, Clint gasped, “Whoa, is this the kid they called you in for? Are we babysitting him now?”
“And I you,” Peter sighed, tucking his face against Wade’s and wounding his arms around Wade’s body in a weak embrace.
Steve grinned and pulled Peter on his lap and asked him, “Do you want to meet some of Papa’s friends?”
She had to act fast. This man was her senior and more experienced. Surprise was her greatest asset at this moment.
With Steve’s arms still wrapped around him and his head resting on Tony’s shoulder, Tony turned back to the screens and excitedly went back to searching.
Steve loved Harry but he could not stand Norman. The man was cynical and practically had no part in his own son’s life. When Tony first met Peter and found out who his mother was, he had confided he thought Mary and Richard had disappeared because Norman had scared them off. Norman was a hard man and held frighteningly aggressive grudges. Steve once overheard him on the phone with an incompetent employee and literally winced from roaring insults he threw at his underling. Tony did not like him either but put up with him originally because of the technological contract they both held and now he put up with him because of Peter’s connection to Harry.
Tony grinned to hold back his chuckle. He wasn’t seeing what Steve was in correlation to Tony, but he was glad to hear his loving super soldier wasn’t going to change much when it comes to coddling the people he cared for.
“There’s something in my ass but it’s doing nothing for me right now,” Tony groaned melodramatically, flopping his limbs.
Smiling widely and without a hint of nervousness, Steve strode out onto the stage. The audience cheered again when Steve appeared.
“Tony,” Natasha hissed urgently under her breath. Steve heard her restrain his boyfriend, probably stopping him from jumping to his feet again. He had to have seen the condescending smirk too.
Tony pinched his chin and thoughtfully murmured to himself, “Vision is practically a lie detector, I should invite him over…”
“That’s Mysterio, he’s a master of illusion,” Peter stated. “Don’t get too close because he has these gases that make you see things, hence the weird headgear.”
Steve went from a stuck-up prick to a plain, a stuck-up guy in his mind in five seconds flat. Tony knew he wanted to see him smile more often.
“Just tell me!” Wade retorted, tickling the younger man to get him to submit. Peter squirmed and laughed as he tried to escape Wade’s nimble fingers. He made the mistake of letting Wade trap him from above, there was no escape now.
He did not feel hungry but, to relieve his family’s fears, he picked up the fork and began to eat the sweetened dough.
“That was my name before the Academy,” she whispered. “I want you to use it when we’re in private, James. I don’t want anyone to know it but you.”
Steve’s hands clenched and he physically shook from repressing his need to jump to Tony and rip the syringe away from his neck.
The open door was immersed in shadows but there was no mistaking who it was who stood in its arch. Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull.
Steve’s gaze was soft and his words were rational. Tony fell into Steve’s side and sighed, “I know…”
They went to a nice restaurant in Santa Monica, overlooking the ocean. Tony requested a private table for them so the din of the other patrons of the restaurant was just a murmur, making it feel like it was just the two of them, good food, the crashing waves, and a brilliant view of the ocean. Still full from the large breakfast, they only ordered appetizers. Their hands lay carded together on top of the table most of the meal, gazing into each other’s eyes and speaking in low tones.
“Yeah,” Steve sighed, answering Thor and leaning heavily into Tony. “But you guys could have gotten here a little sooner.”
Natasha’s eyes flickered to Steve for a second before returning to Peter. She stated, “I would not miss my own Godson’s birthday. And it’s a fun birthday so far, isn’t it?” Natasha asked Peter.
Before Tony merely glanced at him but now he really looked at him. Steve’s face was scrunched as if he were in pain and he was sweating profusely.
The man wasn’t wearing any protection like Tony’s armored suit and, with the high ceilings in his workshop, he doubted the man hadn’t broke one or more bones in the fall.
“Me neither but they’re around for a reason,” Tony retorted, his voice also a degree lower. He began to rhythmically stroke Peter’s soft hair and his boy’s eyes began to flutter.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut to keep his immediate distraught reaction to the AI’s words from showing. He took a deep, calming breath and whispered, “Take me to him, Jarvis.”
Steve gently ran his hands through Tony’s hair and whispered gently to him until his soulmate’s eyes closed and the darkness took them again.
Thanks again and the next chapter will be out in a week! (a teaser will be out on my tumblr in a couple days!) :D
. Jarvis was able to scramble all the cameras that had Wi-Fi uplinks but there were a few older cameras without them that captured Stark with Rogers.”
Steve’s eyes widened and he stared at Natasha in shock. Steve’s heart began to beat furiously in his chest and he blindly reached for Tony’s hand.
Steve wordlessly reached out to the photo and Tony bent down and picked it up for him. Steve held the photo between them and stared down at it expressionlessly for several long moments. Finally, he stated, “We look good here.”
For a brief moment, Steve pressed his face into Tony’s hair and inhaled his scent deeply. He gave himself that one moment and, in that moment, he and Tony were together. There was no estrangement in their relationship nor risk to the future. It was just Tony and Steve. They both had survived and were leaning into each other for support in more than one way.
Tony turned his head to look at his soulmate and smiled at him. In his mind, he was already going through all of the information Jarvis had complied on Hydra and thinking of solutions of how to take down the organization. They couldn’t return to the Tower just yet, but, it was not lost to them and even if it was, Tony wouldn’t care that much… He had Steve and wherever he was, was where home would be. He agreed, “Home.”
“Bucky, you can trust me,” Steve whispered. Buck’s eyes narrowed and he studied him as if he was trying to understand what he was. Had he forgotten him already? Steve’s chest tightened and he tried to relay all his trust and love through his eyes.
“Nah, just a place to sleep,” Tony replied. He was slowing down on eating so Steve grabbed his canteen and tossed it to Tony. Tony caught it with a grin and said, “Thanks.”
Tony and the others all made a move toward Steve as he stumbled back. He fell and drew all the eyes in the waiting room to him with the violent fall. His hood fell back and Steve raised his hand to ward Tony off.
Peter fell asleep in Wade’s embrace thinking that he’d be waking to Wade’s face tomorrow and all the other tomorrows to come.
“And you still don’t have that high school degree,” Steve added rolling his eyes. “You can still swing around New York and be the neighborhood hero, but you are not joining the Avengers until you are done with high school, no matter what your birth certificate says…”
She held up a small stack of papers and stated, “I want your approval for your statements to the media.”
But he could feel his smile against his lips and it was already well past midnight so he whispered into that happy mouth, “Happy Anniversary, Steve.”
Bruce stepped back as Tony leaned back into his wheelchair and closed his eyes. Instantly, he saw Steve’s eyes staring back at him: ice blue as if the darker blue of its coloring had the tint leeched out of it and his stare bored into Tony’s very soul asking him, “Why? Why did you do this?”
“I think the honeymoon is the transitioning point,” Tony murmured dryly. “We would have let it sink in several times and in several positions.”
There was also a superhero in New York, just like something out of one of the comics the he had read as a kid and, of all people, it was Howard Stark’s son! Iron Man. The crew had no photos and didn't have connection to the Internet (a technology that still boggled his mind) so they could not show him what Iron Man looked like. Yet, what they described sounded glorious.
Peggy sighed and gently brushed some of the hair off Tony’s face. She whispered, “I wanted to get the two of you together again but not this way…”
The SHIELD agent’s face went white and he looked from Peter to the remains of the burnt body. He stuttered a mortified apology and quickly slipped back into the room, closing the door.
He stepped into the elevator and pressed the button for the penthouse. The elevator moved quickly and Coulson quietly counted the seconds as they passed it took ten seconds to reach the top, giving him twenty seconds to spare. Plenty of time.
“Yes, you’re my best friend, Buck. If you are in trouble I am going to help you,” Steve replied, the forced kiss was already forgotten and forgiven. “And if she will try to run away but I will get Tony to put whatever room we are in in lockdown.”
He tried to look at the chart while holding the babe and Steve could tell he was having trouble turning the pages so he offered, “I can hold him.”
Steve sighed heavily then enfolded him in his arms. Peter did not fight the embrace and Steve placed the side of his face on top of Peter’s head as he murmured, “It is not fair, I know, and I wish I could give you the childhood I had…”
Tony sauntered forward, swaying his hips in a way Tony knew Steve liked. Steve watched him for a moment, enjoying the sway of his boyfriend’s body and then dashed after him. He draped his arm across his back and grasped his behind possessively.
He did not know what to say to Tony to draw him out of this. He could not even provide false hope because there was no hope for them to cling to. The very thought made tears well up in his eyes again but this time Steve did not fight it. His tears flowed silently down his cheeks and into Tony’s scalp.
“We barely interacted since we left here yesterday, Stark,” Bucky stated. “And when we did communicate it was to discuss tactics and strategies.”
Steve’s sky blue eyes flickered open and latched on Tony. He stared at Tony for a few seconds with a steady gaze and an unreadable expression.
Tony paused outside the barracks as his resolve grew. He could do this…he wanted to do this. He liked Steve and Steve liked him. This was going to be easy. Tony knew what he was getting into and, if Steve wanted to go through with it, then he’d know what to expect too. This would be a brief affair only and then Tony would return to the future and Steve would martyr himself in saving their country.
Howard’s tent hadn’t been broken down yet and, when Bucky stuck his head in, he saw exactly what he expected. Tony still asleep and Steve sitting next to him on the cot. Steve had been gently petting the side of Tony’s face but pulled back his hand guiltily when he saw Bucky.
Gabe pulled out his stethoscope and reached for the first button in the V of Tony’s shirt. Both Tony and Steve jumped and gasped simultaneously:
It looked like it had once been a small cottage but only a single room remained being held up by a once sturdy fireplace that was tilting dangerously toward the wrecked yard. Light leaked in from the roof and walls but it was private. Tony did a full circle around the room and then began to unbutton his shirt as he said, “Alright, J, this spot looks as good as any. Exit stealth mode.”
He drew his other leg onto the lounge chair and slotted it between Steve’s legs. He heard Steve inhale sharply and Tony met his gaze. His eyes were wide and staring at Tony and only Tony. He was no longer looking for the photographers.
Cable actually smirked and then rumbled, “Let’s leave the notebook somewhere for him to find it then and get the hell out of Dodge.”
“We’ll just put it back into Mac’s fridge,” Eddie sighed. He picked up the beaker but, when it was only an inch off the counter, its entire surface bubbled. Eddie hurriedly put it back down and the beaker thrummed as it vibrated from the bubbly reaction.
He shivered as he remembered the feel of Bucky’s lips on him. He bit down on his tongue as the image of Bucky kissing him flashed before his eyes in multiple angles. It had been caught on various cameras and broadcasted on nearly all news outlets. It was one of the main sequences the news stations were playing. The news outlets were speculating his and Bucky's relationship and were wondering how long they had been together. Every time it came on the television, Tony's face became stony and unreadable.
Mixed in with the Goblin’s laughter were Venom’s shrieks and a loud clanking sound, which reminded Steve of the kicking of a can down an alley. He could hear no one else. Where were the agents? But, most importantly, where was Tony?
“Yes, but, at this point, I think they’ll go if we asked,” she replied. “Most of their equipment has been moved to the more secure facility of Fort MacArthur.”
Tony had said something similar to Steve to convince him he’d find love and marry one day. He knew his super soldier was referring to that and Tony grinned at Steve.
Everyone looked Steve down and their eyes landed on his feet. The cheap plastic rubber of the flip-flops had rubbed his skin raw and, now that he was standing still, his feet were really beginning to throb. Steve kicked off the shoes and Bucky immediately started to fuss over him just like he used to in the past.
They both fell silent as James washed out his mouth. James’s mind irrevocably returned to last night, when he and Natasha shared a large bottle of vodka and he revealed his American origins.
He always wondered what it’d be like to kiss Tony. Would their kiss be wild as the man delivering it or would it be soft, revealing the tender person beneath the tough exterior? Would his lips be soft? Or would they be itchy because of Tony’s facial hair? Would Tony smile into his mouth like he always did whenever he accomplished something amazing or, better yet, would he just keep kissing him? How far would they go?
“Mmmm, I can still smell it in your skin,” Wade replied huskily as he pressed his face into Peter’s neck.
However, he could tell Steve was torn when he broke his gaze from Tony's and stepped away. The super soldier stated, “We can't, Tony…”
Heimdall watched the scene with a smile and, in the coming days, watched the Captain sleep less and the Man of Iron grow stronger with his every waking minute. The world clamored over their relationship and they took it all in stride. Their union had started off shaky but had grown strong in the trails they had faced together and with the knowledge of what they could have lost.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Tony sighed. “Steve and I went big. Not only did we unleash the scoop of the century but we also had one of the most talked about weddings of the century and the press
Ben sat down on one of the couches and pulled his wife down with him. May had paled a considerable degree and had placed a hand over her heart. She turned to her husband and asked, “Why did you never tell me?”
The employee nodded to a small rack of newspapers and said, “Yeah, 2009, see? Now you gonna buy anything?”
When Tony returned to Bucky's side, to retrofit His arm socket, Bucky was quiet at first. But after a few moments had passed, Bucky stated, “Steve was my friend…”
“Captain Rogers, I am going to have to ask you to put down your shield and come with me. You are under arrest for the rape of Susan Tyler,” the man stated.
“Yes, I do see and I’m getting hard already,” Tony stated in all seriousness, wishing he wasn’t in his suit at the moment.
Instead, a crackle, like the splintering of lightning, struck nearby and Peter’s eyes snapped open and he turned to the sound.
“Yeah!” Peter gasped, just realizing how peculiar it might have seemed to his neighbors if they saw Captain America and Iron Man standing on his front porch. He opened his door and ushered them in, saying, “Come in! Come in!”
The knowledge of loving Bucky did not go away but its effect on him did. It was no longer as resilient but it was still strong enough to worry him. He was able to ignore it which was all that mattered but he did not know how he would react if he saw Bucky again…
“Look, I –…” Wade pressed his forehead to Peter and grasped his hands. He whispered, “I’m okay…I’m – I’m just happy!” He wetly chuckled and whispered, “I think this is the happiest I have ever felt in my life and it’s because of you –
The Mark 15’s screens flickered and his readings went off the charts. Energy levels broke all conceivable scales and then the screens went dark. He was blind…except for that dark blue glow. Through the smallest of seams in his suit, that light was beginning to leak through.
As if on cue, Steve appeared in his workshop to pick him up for the team breakfast. They both grinned when their eyes met.
Coulson’s brows pinched together and he cupped Clint’s face. With a pained voice, Steve had never heard from the usually calm agent, Coulson gasped, “I'm sorry, son.”
Steve pushed Tony back against the counter and drew out his hips over the edge so they could remain connected. He held up his ass with his hands and kneaded it through his jeans. Steve thrust his hips flush against Tony’s and elicited a moan from him.
“I just…I just never thought I would,” Tony confessed. He quickly added, “Before meeting you that is. But…I don’t know… Meeting the adult Peter was one thing…but we’re going to adopt him as a
Father Michael managed to find him a plaid shirt, jeans, and thick socks all of which Steve donned to reclaim the heat he was quickly losing from the cooler air of the bathroom. When he exited the bathroom, Father Michael was just placing some warm toast on the table and, in the small attached kitchen, Steve could see a pot of coffee brewing. He hadn’t eaten since before the plane crash and hadn’t had real coffee since the Hydra base…he felt like he was entering Heaven.
Tony groaned as another wave of pain washed over him from his dislocated arm. His vision grew a little fuzzy, but he was able to see a large figure hunch over Steven and pick him up.
The Soldier sat on the side of a knocked over trashcan and stared at the unconscious man across from him. The Captain sat upright against the wall with his head lolled to the side, resting on his shoulder. His mouth was slightly agape and his eyes were closed. The Captain’s eyes had been closed since that moment in the helicarrier when the Soldier was about to shoot him in the head and the Captain tried to say that name again. The man had fallen unconscious at that point and hadn’t woken since.
Peter rolled his eyes and said, “He’s my pops, Uncle Tony, I gonna be just as strong as him! I plan on taking his job!”
Bucky nodded and clapped his hand over Steve’s a few times before pushing himself up and off of the bed. He pointedly said to Steve, “Alright, you owe me a drink after nearly giving me a heart attack.” He then turned to Tony and stated, “And you owe me two for putting up with the both of you.”
When the time came for them to part, Peter held Steve around the neck tightly. At first, he feared he might have to forcibly tear Peter off him but Peter let him go with a trembling pout. Steve transferred him to Ben’s arms and Peter automatically grasped the dog-tag on his wrist.
“SHIELD has loose lips,” Steve concluded grimly. He released Peter from his hug but he was not going to be putting his son down for the rest of the night, maybe even the rest of the week. He was going to be having nightmares of Peter being torn from his arms for even longer.
Tony smothered the laugh with his mouth and Steve melted into the kiss. Tony pressed him into the door and explored Steve's mouth like he'd never been there. Steve wound his arms around Tony, pulling him as closely as he could, and Tony carded his fingers into Steve's hair, pulling slightly on it so he could tilt his head more and deepen the kiss.
He remembered that he and Natasha gotten atrociously drunk off the Asgardian liquor before both Tony and Clint finally found them. Both of their partners had also drank but were still of sound mind to collectively decide it was time to leave and led them out the back where Happy had picked them up.
Peter nodded and then pressed his face into the metal suit. The entire suit shuddered as the repulsors turned on and it turned into an even vibration as they rose into the air.
“Bucky will definitely not let you live this down,” Steve stated with a knowing air, making Tony groan.
“Get a lab coat off one of the dead guys,” Natasha commanded. James instantly moved and ran back into the other room.
Wade was trying to will his body to heal faster. The sooner he was healed then he’d sooner be able to help Peter. Once he was able, he pushed himself out of Vision’s hold and he walked next to Peter, refusing anymore help as he moved with his boyfriend and was trapped in his unchanging gaze.
Peter quickly explained the realness to the invite and his thoughts on the matter and texted the reply: ‘My dad is a dork. I'm sorry.’
Tony sighed heavily and also leaned back. He murmured in a promise, “I’ll think of something…” He smirked and asked, “So back to dating? Have any embarrassing birthmarks in inappropriate places I should know about?”
for you. I am not going to watch you waste away when there is something I could’ve done to help you. I…I love you, Tony. I love you so much and I know I am going to lose you, but I refuse to let it be to death. You are going to go back to the future and fix your reactor and live out the rest of your life building amazing inventions and bringing wonder to the lives of people around you like…like you did for me. Be pissed at me, but that won’t change how I feel about you. I would have still done it knowing how you feel now.”
The entire intersection was hooked up with speakers, ready to play the shrill sound at a moment’s notice. The plan was to turn it on as soon as Venom was close enough. Steve knew he could not get the symbiote into the cage. It was smart enough to know it could contain it but he planned to grab Peter as soon as the shrill alarm went off. Then, after he gave the signal, the alarm would be turned off for a few seconds and the symbiote rebound back to them. Steve planned to drop and let it fly past him and into the cage.
Over the communicator the rest of the team heard the man’s words and every single one of them belted out a variation of a curse word or words of disbelief.
“That is his public persona, Peter,” Aunt May whispered gently. “SHIELD probably made him act that way to boost the public image of the Avengers. I know him, Peter. He never cared about anyone but himself. Reaching out to you is probably another PR move. He’ll probably offer to pay for our home, pay for your schooling, pay for anything your heart desired and you’ll become the male version of the little Orphan Annie. The media will eat it up and praise Tony for his charity. Don’t fall for it Peter. He’s really a monster.”
“HE WAS DOING FINE WITH ME!” Tony yelled, after Fury but the man ignored Tony’s exclamation and disappeared. In his wake, Tony let out a string of curses that would have made Steve flush.
“I'll get it out of you one way or another future man!” Howard said in parting, waving his hand over his head. He was flocked by his lackies, carrying all the tools they were going to use to dissemble the time machine.
Harry had demanded to see Spider-Man in person and Peter agreed. His best friend was away at boarding school but they still kept in communication. For once, Harry’s dad was letting him come down for winter break. To his parents, Peter said, “I’m going to need that jockstrap before Harry comes or he is
Steve put his sketchbook down on the couch and strolled across the room. Tony was adding improvements to his Iron Man suit and Steve had taken it as a prime opportunity to get a few more sketches of Tony in his adorable goggles. Yet sketches were the furthest thing from his mind as he leaned into his elbows against the counter, opposite Tony, and stared at him with a knowing grin.
Steve never so badly wanted to throttle somebody before like he wanted to do to Norman Osborn at that very instant.
Nodding to where Bucky lay, Schmidt murmured, “You destroyed the more humane option I had for moving you.” The Red Skull removed a pistol from the holster on his hip and stated, “You only have yourself to blame for the pain.”
Tony grinned victoriously and spun around on his heel, stating, “On the way here, I saw a couple of abandoned buildings that I was considering for hook up points for Steve and I, but they’ll do for a temporary charging station as well.”
They walked around the park until they came across a sandpit for Peter to play in. Steve only let Peter play because, at that hour, many children were still in school. He kept an eye on his son either way and not just to make sure he hurt none of the other children. Peter went straight to working on the daunting task of trying to build a giant mound of sand.
“Sir? Do you require medical attention?” Jarvis asked as he hung off the handle, trying to catch his breath.
Tony’s eyes beheld the many scars that still littered Steve’s body from when he tried to save Peter. Steve probably thought his nightmares were just about Peter, but he was so wrong. It still made him ill with anxiety to think back to that moment he rounded the corner and he saw Wade hunched over Steve’s bloody, unmoving form.
“Come here, beloved,” Tony whispered, grasping Steve’s cheek and drawing Steve’s lips to his. Steve sighed as he relaxed into Tony’s kiss. It was so unlike all the other kisses they shared. It was unhurried and his lips slid across Steve’s in a slow and gentle caress.
So I currently am really busy with my internship and I can make no promises when my chapters will come out. However, writing is my stress reliever so I will DEFINITELY be working on this in the meantime! XD
Bucky nodded and left the room. The corporal saluted Steve one last time and left him too. Once alone, Steve turned back to the window Sneaky had exited. He let himself feel a sense of wonder as he considered the future that awaited the world.
Steve licked his lips and then quickly joined Tony’s side. He went to grab Tony’s hand like one would do with the waltz or any other traditional dancing but Tony shook his head.
“YES!” The stranger exclaimed, “Sexy Stark and Sexy Cap are just as smart as the older ones from my era! But, geez, your hotness is distracting me! I didn’t come all the way here to oogle you! The future needs your help! Your son is in danger!”
“Put down the gun, boss,” Natasha gritted between clenched teeth and Bucky flinched. Steve saw his eyes widen and he lowered the gun a fraction.
“And this will come to an immediate end once one of us decides to get into a serious relationship with someone else,” Steve stated.
“I am able to connect to Jarvis out here,” Tony stated. “Jarvis does not notice anything is amiss. Are Peter and Bruce alright?”
At the forefront of the room, was Dr. Bruce Banner, Scott Lang, and Peter's parents. Standing behind them were the Vision, Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson, James Rhodes, Natasha Romanoff, Bucky Barnes, and even Pepper Potts.
Holy Taco Tuesday, his heart was about to jump out of his chest from saying it once and now he needed to repeat himself. Blushing furiously, Wade mumbled more slowly, "I - I love you." Peter's confused brows separated and he blinked. Wade quickly added, "Like seriously, I'm head over heels in love. The world is brighter when you are around and I - I just love you so much. It feels like I'm in a dream half the time because this -
Steve offered to stay behind but Tony insisted he go. After a lot of goading, Steve eventually relented and Tony freed August 20th to drink the night away. Jarvis made sure to make a number of quips about his drinking and lying to Steve but Tony weathered through it.
. By focusing on you, I was able to remember there was a time before the blood. I was able…to remain somewhat sane. I—I thought…” Bucky pursed his lips and his eyes suddenly became dark. “It doesn’t matter. None of this matters. You’re with
“I usually keep my gear and my cybernetic limbs in good repair, so I should be able to repair something as archaic as an arc reactor,” Cable replied.
