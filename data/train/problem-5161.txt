Dean hitched on a grin for his mom and Bobby when they caught sight of him.
Cas was still frustrated, still angry, still hurting - but none of that was because of Dean any longer.  “Hurry up,” he said softly.
As if he’d never abandoned Cas.
Cas’s mouth twitched upward.  “And yet throughout it all I could still barely keep my hands to myself.”
Dean hadn’t uncovered his face.  His reply was muffled and embarrassed.  “Not as my - whatever.”
Bobby bristled.  “I’m not used to being so goddamn still, alright?  I’m restless.  Can’t sleep.”
It took Cas only a split second to wake up and register what was happening. He was out of bed in the next second, circling to Dean’s side to take him by the arm.
“You guys bein’ told to evacuate or - or what?” Dean asked over the phone, failing to disguise the tension in his voice.
Dean ran a hand over his chin. “We can ring maintenance?”
Cas was watching Dean closely. “Dean, I hate to put you on the spot, but you’ve been very quiet the whole evening.”
“You sure you don’t want to come?” Dean asked, brow furrowed.  “You know Mom wouldn’t mind.”
Cas led him back to the bedroom, then turned to leave.
about it afterward.”  She patted his knee in satisfaction.  “So everything’s great.”
Leaving the sight of Dean in his bed was difficult, but Cas managed it somehow. He started coffee and then breakfast, and by the time he’d begun frying the eggs, he’d almost forgotten how much he’d yearned to kiss Dean awake, to wrap himself up in the covers with Dean so they’d be pressed together for the rest of the morning -
Cas nodded. He was smiling for some reason, though that couldn’t possibly be right, because this was obviously the worst idea ever.
That, at least, Cas could relate to.  He lifted his coffee mug and took a long gulp, burned tongue be damned.
“Been waiting a long goddamn time to hear that,” Dean’s voice said.
thinking about it.”
Dean gave Cas the softest of smiles.  “I’m glad you changed your mind,” he said.
Cas’s mouth lifted at the corner, but Dean knew it was just for show. “I don’t think marriage is in the cards for me, Dean,” Cas admitted.
Cas didn’t reply to Dean’s comment.  He had begun wiping down his kitchen counters, transferring dirty glasses into the sink and clearing what looked to be twelve days’ worth of notes from a stack near the fridge.  His brows were furrowed, and the long lines of muscle under his tee contracted with every pass of the rag against the tile.
“Okay, well,
Dean was guzzling water, leaning against the counter. He wiped his mouth and gave Cas a once-over. “You kidding? Ladies love the broody and mysterious schtick. I’d be here every day if I got to see you.”
Cas laughed.  He’d missed Dean’s voice.  “There’s still a few more hours, Dean.”
“You spend the whole night ignoring me, you don’t say bye, you don’t text to say you got home safely, then you call me at - 2:09am?  Really, Dean?”
“About him and Daphne?”
Despite decidedly not kissing Dean, Cas is still pressed tantalizingly close.  Dean takes a deep calming breath.  “The sink,” he said.
“If this is just your ploy to get me to call you tomorrow, well, you’re wasting your time because I was already gonna call you.”
Cas’s eyes were shifting between Dean’s, trying to find something that Dean wasn’t quite sure existed.
Dean’s exhaustion was evident by the way he poured himself into the embrace. His breaths were long and deep, heavy with tension. Under Cas’s hands, Dean’s back rose and fell in waves, and Cas was happy to be his anchor.
Damn, Dean was good at this.
“I drank the grape juice, didn’t I?” Dean said.
“But what if I - what if you have… company?” he asked slowly. “I wouldn’t want to interrupt.”
“What?  Fuck you, that’s none of your business.”  Dean’s face was pink again.  “You’ll find out when you get back, alright?  Jesus.  Oh, shut up, leave Mom out of this.”
“Not before your friend comes out.”
Finally Sam cleared his throat. “D- Uh, Dean wants to see you there. Just… y’know, just so you know.”
, you’re avoiding me.”
Dean raised a hand in greeting. “Hey. Just wanted to say hi. I’m picking Sam up for lunch.”
Cas smiled at him. It was wide and affectionate. “I thought you said they should enjoy being kids?”
It was obvious that Sam was still watching Dean out of the corner of his eye, but he spared a smile and a tummy tickle for Jack. “No harm done, little guy.”
About two hours later, Cas was dropped by his rideshare outside Sam’s new home.  It was quaint, could do with some remodeling, and needed some touch-ups on the paint here and there - but it was quiet and peaceful, and exactly what Sam needed after a touch childhood.
Aaron Bass called that night just like he said he would through his email.  Dean wasn’t feeling up to socializing, not after more than a few beers and making up with Cas (welcome, but also emotionally trying) but he’d committed to this mission and he would see it through.  He was, however, sleeping in the guest room with Cas in the same bed, so stealth was necessary.
“We’ll be fine,” Cas says, startled out of his shock by Dean’s distress.  “Let’s make a trip tomorrow to Costco - “
Dean was about to reply with a not-so-polite response, but then Cas reached forward and ran a hand through Dean’s hair, just once.
the hermit.”
“Took a leaf out of Cas’s book and cashed in on my vacation days,” Jody said. She held up her bear claw, half-eaten. “Thanks for the freebie, boys. We’ll catch up later. You, behave.” The last word she directed to Claire, who’d taken up a station at the register. She left then, leaving Dean and Cas with her charge.
Dean looked at the door even though there was no one there.  “That’s great and all, but I… I still don’t feel like it was worth it.”  He turned his head back and looked at Cas then, sadly.  “I made you and Sammy hate me.  I haven’t even met his kid.  You… god, Cas, you think I didn’t hear how hard you worked to catch me?  How much you hated me?”
There was a long pause.  Dean, having lain awake for two hours trying to figure out what the fuck he was going to do, was sitting up in bed with the covers pulled up to his waist.  He imagined Cas was doing the same, maybe in those stupid bee pajamas Dean had bought him as a joke.  “Will my being with Daphne be a problem, Dean?” Cas finally asked.  It was said so quietly that Dean barely made it out.
They stood by Dean’s car in an awkward silence for a few moments. The snow around them was light, but it fell steadily, pushed sideways by a light breeze and leaving icy flakes resting on Dean’s coat.  Cas could see some of it slowly melting in Dean’s hair.  The reminder of its transience made him think about Dean, about their friendship, about how the Dean currently standing in front of him would not be the same Dean standing in front of him in two minutes.
.” His voice, though muffled, was embarrassed. Shame tinted his tone, and Cas marveled again at how much it must have taken to say everything else he’d already said.
Dean ran a thumb over Cas’s bottom lip, drawn to the warmth of the breath leaving Cas’s lungs.  “I have never been more sure of anything else, Cas.”  Then he swallowed and said, “I love you too, you know.”  He’d never said it to anyone before, had never felt the inclination, but he knew the truth of it.  “I’m sure of that too.”
Eventually the check arrived, and Dean quashed the bead of disappointment that took up residence in his chest. Upon exiting the restaurant, however, Dean’s disappointment turned to surprise when Cas turned to him and said, “I’m usually free for lunch if you’d like to meet up again.”
“You too,” she said, and even her voice was smooth and angelic.
an accident.  Second, if you’re getting a drink, get me one too.”
Dean looked at him, his brow furrowing when Cas didn’t say anything. He leaned in, almost as an experiment. When Cas leaned in too, just a little bit, Dean’s eyebrows flew up. “Oh.”
Cas looked down at his feet, hoping to give Dean the space to think. “Your honesty is appreciated.”
After a few months of negotiations, Dean and Cas had finally closed on the purchase just two days before. They hadn’t even had time to move any furniture in.
“Don’t be sorry,” Cas said softly. “I’m glad you’re feeling better.” He rubbed Dean’s back once more before standing up. His knees clicked; Dean remembered with an ache that they were both on the wrong side of 30.
Dean paused.  “You - you do?”
Cas’s cheeks bloomed red.  The hands he had on Dean’s waist clutched a little harder.  “Why didn’t you ever - ?”
If this were real life, Dean would roll his eyes, but all he does now is grin, affection making him soft.  “Smartass.”
The absurdity of that statement and the hurt in Cas’s voice spurred Dean on.  He leaned in and kissed his best friend, just once.  It was nothing more than a slight shift of lips against Cas’s, but it was more than enough to steal Dean’s breath away.  When he drew back, Cas kept his gaze trained on Dean’s, watching for a reaction.
He still ended up losing, but he blamed it on the hand that Dean had kept hanging on Cas’s shoulder.
Dean swiped at his eyes stubbornly. “Cas, I meant it when I said I’d do anything for that kid. If he ever loses you, he’s going to have me. Don’t even think about apologizing for that.”
Cas is still watching him, alarmed.
“This was supposed to be enjoyable,” Cas complained. He had a loop of lights strung around his right bicep, and it continued around his left leg.
It was barely 15 minutes later that his eyes caught the elevator lights behind his monitor, indicating someone was headed to the floor above his office.  Cas was instantly on the alert; there was only one office on that floor, and it was the director’s.  He was on his feet and grabbing his gun from his drawer almost without realizing it.
“You’d be asleep in your own sweat and vomit it I hadn’t come,” Cas pointed out. He had his fingers curled into his palms and hoped Dean wouldn’t call him out on the obvious tension in his posture. What was it about Dean cast in winter light that made Cas want to burst into flames? Into poetry?
He was still watching when Cas paused at the threshold and looked over his shoulder, eyes careful. “Are you joining me?”
“Your
The next time Dean saw Cas was a week later, only a few days before Christmas. He knocked on Dean’s door and smiled wanly when Dean let him in.
“Is that the way you should be speaking to the father of your niece or nephew?”
Dean batted the hand away, his lip curling. “You’re going to hold this against me for years, aren’t you?”
“What do you mean?” Dean asked.  He’d finished his beer already and wanted another one, but he wasn’t about to dig through the cooler with his mom right there.
Dean’s cheeks were rosy with pleasure, even if he looked bone-tired. “Couldn’t have done it without you, Cas.” He locked eyes with Cas. “I mean that.”
Dean nearly dropped his phone. “Hey,” he said, a little too loudly and a little too quickly. “You - you saw my note.”
It shouldn’t have hurt so much.  It meant that Dean had known and hadn’t found Cas’s love worth staying for.  “Oh, ‘
“I’ll wish you a Merry Christmas Eve,e if you want it.”
He waited and waited for Cas to reply, but he never did.
With a sickening wrench of his stomach, Dean instantly understands.  He withdraws his hand from Cas’s hair, mortified and disgusted with himself.
It was obvious by the flush of Dean’s face that he was having trouble. He kept having to pause and restart whenever he spoke. “Far be it from me to—I mean, I know what you said, but—I didn’t actually expect you to—”
He couldn’t do it.  He wouldn’t do it.  He’d told Cas he’d try to be okay with him and Daphne, and if Dean couldn’t keep it together after one inconclusive comment from his own mom, he didn’t deserve to be called Cas’s best friend.
Dean just lifted a shoulder in answer -
He’s angling his face to fit their lips together when -
And this time, Dean didn’t pull away.
“You too, Dean,” Aaron said, smiling wide.  He’d tamed the beard, too, which was a nice surprise.  “I’m really glad you contacted me.”
Dean put his hand in Cas’s. His feelings for Cas threatened to overwhelm him, but he squeezed Cas’s hand and the feeling eased when Cas smiled. “Count me in, Cas.”
Dean’s other hand lifted to the side of Cas’s neck. His thumb grazed Cas’s lips. His eyes, when they met Cas’s, were tender.
Cas rolled his eyes.
An awkward silence descended.  Charlie’s eyes slid to Dean as if expecting him to lead the conversation.  Geez.  Was 11am too early for a drink?
Cas let him have his moment of disbelief, mostly because he was busy having his own.  He’d scarcely allowed himself to dream of this, not even this simple thing, holding hands with Dean Winchester on his secondhand couch.  And now it was happening.  He squeezed Dean’s hand.
was not right, but neither was
Dean closes his eyes, mortified.  Hearing that moment given life through Cas’s voice multiplies his misery, already so acute.  “Cas, I’m sor -”
Dean thought.  He forced himself to look away, back to Willow, who was nipping at his chin playfully.  He saw his mom watching him.  He ignored it in favor of scratching Willow under the chin.
If it had just been Cas’s blue eyes or thick thighs that Dean had to contend with, he would have been fine. But seemingly overnight, it became everything else, too. It was Cas’s voice, his sigh, his smile, the way he never let Dean have his way, but always let Dean have the remote. It was the way he’d memorized Dean’s schedule so that he could leave him a meal in the oven, and the way that he didn’t mind doing the groceries, and the way that he wished Dean a good day - like he really meant it, like if he could, he would give Dean a good day every single day for the rest of Dean’s life.
They went back to browsing. The lady at the register was buying a basket-load of books, and the line only grew behind her.
Cas grit his teeth against Dean’s weight as he guided him to bed. Meanwhile, Dean was critiquing his surroundings.
“Oh,” Cas breathed.
Cas was tinkering around in the kitchen.  “Coffee?” he asked.
When Dean wakes up, it’s to a cold bed.  Next to him is the usual sight: white pillows against white sheets and nothing else.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling a migraine building right between his eyes.
Dean shook his head at himself.  He looked at Cas, pouring creamer into his coffee.  Dean steadied his heart on that image because it reminded him of what he stood to lose.  Then he took a deep breath and tried not to let his voice shake when he said, “I’m sorry.”
her.  And his face was starting to hurt from smiling back at her.
Dean looked straight into Cas’s eyes.  “You need to know something.”
Cas doesn’t answer.  He continues to survey Dean.  There is no expression in the set of his mouth, and his eyes are unreadable.  “You wanted… to kiss me.”
“At Sam’s wedding, I uh—I told you I wasn’t ready, and you told me you’d wait for me.”
“Honestly? Kinda,” Dean admitted. The smile lines around his eyes deepened. “Wanted you to come in the next day and shove me against a door.”
He kept apologizing.
It’s the word
Dean draws back and waits.
Dean bit down on a knuckle.  It would be so easy to tell Cas no.  So easy.  Daphne had no place in their lives anymore, he wanted to say.  But he remembered the week he had just spent not speaking to Cas, and imagined another week just the same.  And another and another.  He couldn’t risk losing Cas again.  “Dude, of course,” Dean said, though the five seconds it took him to answer Cas might not have helped his case.  “If you want her to come, and my mom’s okay with it - sure, why not?  And her friend too.  She can bring her friend.  All her friends.  Just - yeah, all of them.”
Dean’s gaze had been pained, his voice raw when he’d said: “Neither do I, Cas.”
Dean craned his head to say smugly into the phone’s receiver, “Yeah, you hear that, Sammy? You’re causing me stress.”
“I told you twice.  I won’t tell you again.  Hands up.”
Despite himself Cas was irritated.  “I wouldn’t have to repeat myself if you’d actually remember your position in this bureau.”
In the end they’d hung up about half a dozen in total, all along the side wall. Cas was in two of them: a group photo with Dean’s extended family, taken at Christmas a few years back; and a photo of just Dean and Cas—dressed in suits, arms around each other’s torsos, smiling at the camera during Sam’s wedding reception.
Dean put his hand over the one on his face. He had to swallow his emotion a few times before managing to ask, “Does that mean I’m forgiven?”
“Were you going to tell me you were running a fever?”
Dean turned to look at him.  “Yeah?” he asked, eyes affectionate, voice low.  “I’ll go grab it.”
He knocked again, a little more forcefully.
scream into a pillow.  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Do you think that’s why he doesn’t date?”
Aaron recoiled a little bit.  “Sorry?”
Dean was leaning against his counter. He looked down at his socks. Embarrassment stopped up his vocal cords.
Dean wandered into the shopfront after a gaggle of them left. His expression was grumpy. He’d been vehemently against the concept of a hairnet, so he went around the kitchen in a baseball cap. On that day it was maroon. “You cannot go on a date with any of those kids,” he said to Claire.
Sam winced.  “Dean - “
Dean choked on his beer. “N- no one’s unwrapping anything if we can’t even put the lights up.”
It was difficult to feign exasperation when all Dean had wanted for the past week was Cas curled up on his couch. “Seriously, you need another hobby.”
Dean took the paper towel and mopped at his eyes. “Says the guy who sobbed his way through half of the last finale.”
“You’re reading the wrong authors then,” Dean said, confident in a way he couldn’t be about anything else.
“That means you’re in charge of the entertainment.”
Three short beeps told Dean the call had dropped. Sighing, still struggling to swallow down his panic, Dean put his phone on his nightstand. He stared at the swing of his ceiling fan and thought about Cas - alone and in the dark, just like Dean - until sleep claimed him.
“Yeah, okay, whatever - what is it now, 4819 minutes?”
“Yeah, dude. What’ve you been doing all morning? I sent you some top-tier jokes, and you didn’t even send me that laughing cat emoji you like.”
“Prove it,” Cas said, his chin tipped up in challenge.
“But only because I love you,” Cas said, his eyebrows still furrowed, his mouth still grim.
Cas is the one who has Dean against the door, but Cas’s knees go a little weak when Dean’s smile turns a little wicked.  “Again,” he says, his hands skimming tantalizingly close to the button on Cas’s jeans, “I like the sound of that.”
“What makes you think I’d say yes, anyway?” Cas said, as they walked up Sam’s driveway.  Cas had been angry with Dean throughout the car ride, mostly for making him cry again.
And Cas was currently an hour away, only three houses down from his ex-girlfriend.
Dean smiled, if only because Cas was beginning to sound like himself again.  “You think I like when you’re moping around?”
Dean didn’t move, so, heart in his throat, Cas took the risk: stepping forward, angling Dean’s face upward. It was Dean who took the next step, though, pulling Cas in by the back of his neck and letting their lips meet.
“I can’t say it if my mouth is otherwise occupied,” Cas said, grinning wickedly.
“Done hiding from me?”
, she signed.  Then she frowned suddenly.
Sam was the first to see him from amid a circle of about 8 people. He excused himself and rushed over, pumping Cas’s hand once before putting a hand on his shoulder and guiding him toward the food. “Glad you could make it, man. Grab some food and then join us, alright?”
“You look dead on your feet, Cas,” Dean said as a greeting. “You feelin’ okay?”
Astounded, Cas reached out his left hand slowly.  Dean closed his eyes and took it.  “I missed you,” he whispered, broken.
times he’d tried to call Cas and gotten his voicemail.
One of Dean’s front steps was creaking.  He turned around and put his weight on the step again and frowned when the wood bowed.  “What are you talking about, mom?”
When Dean starts to nod off, Cas will shut off the TV and nudge Dean until he trudges toward the bathroom to brush his teeth.
“Dean, are you - “
Terrified, Dean cast about for another reason.  “I mean,” he said quickly, “you said he’s been visiting Daphne, right?  They could be… giving it another shot?”  Even saying it was painful.
His fists tightened at his sides.  “Only if you want to,” he said.
Cas gripped the curtain. Outside, over Dean’s shoulder, he could see his car parked by the curb. Behind it, Dean’s Impala shone even in the winter gloom. It was not uncommon to see the two cars together. Cas marveled that Dean wanted to see it happen more often than it already did.
Sometimes Cas got caught up in his writing, and sometimes Dean got caught up with paperwork at the garage, but neither of them had ever knowingly just
“I can’t believe I never met your family,” Aaron said.  He was eating chips straight from the bowl.
“Also,” Dean said, as casually as he could manage, “I’m probably going to ask him to marry me within the year.”
The corner of Cas’s mouth lifted. “Both of you are right,” he said. “I should have clarified: What do you think of my feelings for you?”
“I’m hanging up,” Dean said. “And when I hang up, you’re going to get up and get some food. You’re going to take a picture of it and send it to me.”
,” was all Dean had the time to say before he was standing.  A half second later, the door opened and the light flickered on.
Cas smiled and rubbed his eyes. “Sorry. I was very comfortable.”
Dean held out his hand. “Is it your turn? Let’s see it."
“Hey,” he said. “Roadhouse okay tonight?”
Both Aaron and Dean watched her walk away.
Cas looked up at Dean. Confused, he said, “A manuscript. Is this real?”
“So I deactivated my tracker, stole a car, broke into her office, and found encoded notes underneath the floral foam.  Her brother’s a bestselling author, and he’s traveling regularly - easy enough to establish criminal contacts with that sort of alibi.”
“That’s a good book,” he said, nodding to the hardcover in the man’s hand. “You ever read anything else by Campbell?”
Cas has the furrow between his brow that says he hasn’t had his coffee yet.  “You don’t have to lie to me just because we slept together,” he grumbles.
Dean stared.  Took a breath.  “I think I can work with that,” he said numbly.
Dean paused.  He pulled the phone away from his ear to make sure the call was still connected.  “Still there, Cas?”
“No, but - “
Eileen rolled her eyes.  “I guess you can come in,” she said, sighing heavily.  Then she smiled.  “If I get a hug.”
Dean massaged a temple and tried to reconcile Charlie’s reaction with the situation.  “So you’re - you’re gonna be okay.”
“I want to be your friend.”  Even to his drunk ears, the proclamation made him cringe.  “I mean.  I - I like Hermione too.  Emma Watson.  Sexy.”
“Taking a detour,” Dean said. “Chillax, kid.” He was holding Cas’s hand as he drove. It was a privilege Cas still hadn’t gotten used to.
Cas’s surprise was obvious, but it lasted no more than a second before he was kissing back. The hand that made its way to Dean’s jaw was freezing but Dean just kissed harder in response. He wanted everything Cas could give him: the hot, the cold, and everything in between. He wished he had left his whiskey inside so he could pull Cas closer by the sweater. In the back of his mind he wondered if it was as soft as it looked.
Cas was similarly content, and they enjoyed each other’s company in silence for a few minutes as they began their meal. At a nearby jungle gym, children threw snowballs at each other from the little flakes of ice they’d been able to scrape together. Dean tried not to watch them too closely - you could never be too careful - but Cas observed them with a furrowed brow.
Dean closed his eyes.  “Yeah, uh.  Look, Charlie, I’m sorry.  It’s - it’s not gonna work out with Aaron.”
Dean smiled. They were sitting so close he barely had to pull Cas forward before their lips met in a hesitant kiss.
Christmas Eve was quiet for Cas.  He spent the morning sorting through mail and thinking about Dean.  The afternoon was also spent thinking about Dean, though this time with a glass or three of scotch whiskey Dean had left behind from Thanksgiving.
He imagined Cas and he imagined himself right next to him, and maybe, Dean thought helplessly, he’d have to reconsider his stance on poetry because Cas made him want to write sonnets.
Cas was raising his gun before he knew it and taking aim at the middle of Dean Winchester’s forehead.  “Hands up.”  His voice was remarkably steady.
It should have been humorous, but instead it felt like a stone fell into the pit of Cas’s stomach. When he spoke, he couldn’t will his voice any louder than a murmur. “I like your brother, but I just couldn’t see it going any further than just a few dates. Without going into details, I think I did him a favor.”
Sam seemed relieved to do anything other than sit and pretend he was a statue. He lifted the bowl, but Dean intercepted it.
Cas smiled and raised a hand in farewell before starting on his way back to his workplace. Dean bit down on a grin and dug his keys out of his pocket.
“First,” Dean said, “it was
“Hey,” Charlie said.  She sounded puzzled.
Dean rolled his eyes.  “Yeah, not happening.”  He opened his car door.  “Stay safe for me, alright, bud?”
Cas admired the way Dean looked in the glow from the Christmas lights blinking outside.  He touched Dean’s hair, admiring the way Dean’s eyelids fluttered in response.  Meanwhile, Mary had apparently gotten on the line because Dean was wincing.
“I’ll grab some water,” Cas said, eager to escape the room. He flung the covers away from him and left the room, unable to shake the feeling that Dean was watching as he went.
Dean was still smiling, but it was fake and fading. His throat bobbed. “You’ll need that room one day.”
Dean’s mask slipped a little.  His throat bobbed.  “You know,” he said quietly, “I’m so happy I think I might actually be hallucinating.”
His phone pinged where he’d laid it on the coffee table.
“Just admiring the view,” Dean says honestly, amused when Cas looks up at him through his eyelashes and glares.  “Eat up, handsome.”
“Dinner in 20,” Dean called out, tossing the paper towel in the trash. He didn’t realize he was smiling until he saw his reflection on his phone.
Cas suppressed the urge to roll his eyes. “Dean, it’s me. You gave me a key, remember? This isn’t a break-in”
“Yeah,” Charlie said.  She sounded almost cheerful.  “Sometimes things don’t work out, right?  I didn’t think he was a good fit myself.”
There was another, much longer, pause.  “If there is another secret,” Sam said slowly, “He’ll tell you when he’s ready.”
“They think Cas quit his job to help his fiancé Dean realize his dream of opening a bakery.” Claire let the story sink in before adding smugly, “And yet they still come back.”
Cas scowled. “I’d say that
“So you’re saying yes.”
but when,” Cas pointed out. “And you might as well buy your own house with all the eggs you’d be buying.”
Cas spent a few minutes squinting at his phone, trying to put a name to the feeling swelling like a balloon in his chest. The words in the text message, while objectively good, didn’t bring Cas any happiness. They didn’t bring him any relief either, which was the very least that Cas had hoped for. Instead, Cas identified the nauseous feeling in his gut as regret. The knowledge that Cas could do nothing to diminish that regret - at least not without asking Dean to trust him after rejection - made Cas’s stomach sink even lower.
Cas smiled, capped the ketchup, and turned to join Sam and his coworkers, conscious of Dean’s eyes on him as he left, and - oddly enough - relishing it.
“I didn’t think it’d be about me,” Cas corrected. He smiled. “But yes, I didn’t think it’d be good.” He paused. A furrow appeared between his brow. “I also didn’t think you’d secretly be a popular published sci-fi author.”
Sam raised his hands and showed Cas his palms, but his smile was still unnaturally wide. “Nothing much. Just wanted to extend an invitation.”
Cas put out a hand and placed it on Dean’s forehead, gratified when Dean’s eyes fluttered closed. “Again, you’re hallucinating. Go to sleep.”
Cas thought. But he didn’t want to say that, mostly because he didn’t even know where it came from. Instead he said,
Cas blinked.  That was a strange sentence.  “Why don’t you tell him yourself?”
Cas’s gaze never left Dean’s. “I understand that the speaker of the poem isn’t necessarily the author of a poem,” he said slowly. “But I need to know, in this case…” He trailed off.
“I was joking, but thanks.”
“I would have done it if I needed to,” Cas said honestly.  He injected a little bit of venon into his tone and relished in the way Dean flinched.  “Regardless of what affection I may have held for you in the past.”
Cas looked more closely at Bobby.
He left Dean there.
Cas gave her a hug first, then Dean.  He kissed her on the forehead for good measure.
Honestly, Dean didn’t remember that much about him.  “Y’know.  He’s cool.  I hope you like him.”
Dean ran a hand over Cas’s back. The pounding of his head matched the pounding of his heart. “I love you too, Cas.”
A few days after, as Dean was sitting in his quiet living room staring at his phone trying to decide if he should call Charlie or not, her contact information lit up the display.
Even in dreams, Cas’s first thought is about Dean.  Dean shrugs.  “Not hungry.”
this crap.”
An awkward silence descended.
not because he didn’t like Gilda - he did; she was perfect - but because she wasn’t what he wanted.  But he maintained his charming smile despite it because Gilda deserved follow-through, even if Dean couldn’t manage sincerity.
“I’m not,” Dean interrupted. He looked surprised by his own words.
“No,” Dean said, holding up his hands.  “Relax.  I stopped for a little bit.  Got a few hours of shut-eye.  Asked for directions.”  The last part he said with a pained smile.
He sighed.  Despite being thoroughly humiliated by his piss-poor people-reading skills, Dean actually felt relieved.  He’d fucked things up with Aaron, sure, and that would bother him for a while yet, but Charlie and Gilda?  That had worked out, even though, Dean had to admit, it had been no thanks to him.  Still, it was nice to be able to lay his head back and not worry about Charlie or Aaron or Gilda.
Sam is a bit cringey...but he means well. Or maybe that's just an excuse the author has for not being able to write Sam.

“Then never,” Dean snapped, even though just the thought of holding it all in for one more day made Dean’s chest feel tight.
Cas recognized a few of his coworkers’ cars parked nearby, but the car that drew his attention the most was the black Chevy Impala that so often swung by the office to pick up Sam. It really was a beautiful car, and it shined like it was brand-new: a testament to Dean’s love for it. For just a second, Cas allowed himself to imagine sitting in the passenger seat, sitting in the car Dean loved, watching Dean drive with the windows rolled down.
“Jesus.  Anything.”
Cas gave him a sheepish smile, embarrassed at the reaction that no other adult man would have had to such a weak innuendo. “I’m a little tired,” he offered.
“Get away from you?”
“Oh, fuck off, I was the first one to congratulate you.”
He clambered out of the car before Cas could reply.  He only knew Cas followed when he heard the passenger door shut behind him.
Cas approaches and Dean gives him a once-over, his eyes lingering on Cas’s hair.  “The bedhead’s a nice touch,” he says, raising his eyebrows.  His gaze skates over Cas’s lips, then back up to Cas’s eyes.  “Not bad, Cas.”
Lying there, his mind raced.  Despite the dark and the steady hum of Charlie’s fridge, he couldn’t stop thinking.  Charlie had been right - he was overwhelmed.  Overwhelmed with the things that he should have known, one of those particular things being the knowledge that all of his friends were apparently
Aaron stared at him.  His jaw hung open.  Long moments passed.  Finally Aaron put a hand on a door handle.  “I’m gay,” he said, “And Charlie?  She’s… you know what?  I’ll let you figure that out on your own.”  He opened the door and climbed out.  Then he turned around and bent down to say one last thing: “Don’t contact me ever again.”  He slammed the door.
Dean rolled his eyes.  “I won’t be here to wish you a Merry Christmas, so just take it, dude.  You been counting the minutes down to everyone?”
“...You were planning on telling them, weren’t you?” Though Cas’s eyes were closed, his voice was soft, a little scared.
He saw the exact moment it clicked for Dean: he blinked again at the road and licked his lips and took a very deep, long breath before saying, “Yeah.  Okay.”
“For the record,” Cas said, still sounding at least 23% asleep, “I think Aaron Bass is a horrible choice, and I predict you’ll regret setting this up in some profound way.”
“Speaking of,” Mary muttered.  “Looks like Cas is being kept busy, too.”
Dean was beginning to get the picture, but it was still difficult to grasp.  “It was a joke.  People say it all the time.”
“Shouldn’t have brought the pie then,” Cas said, smiling.  He put his first forkful into his mouth, watching Dean all the while.
“Do you think your family will be surprised?”
The accusation that this was somehow Dean’s fault made irritation flare up in Dean.  “The hell you saying?”
Dean had barely spared a thought for anything else besides Cas for the past few hours.  He blinked.  “Oh.”
Dean’s eyes were searching. His hand had finally come to rest on Cas’s cheek, secure and warm. “Cas, you’re a goddamn angel, but you need to say what you mean because I’m a dumbass.”
Dean’s grin fell a little bit. “About?”
Cas didn’t think.  He met Dean’s lips with his own.  Dean’s soft answering groan was raw, the sound of a man whose hurts were met with life-saving saltwater.  They kissed for a long time, their hands still linked between them.
The want is not new. What is new is the sour feeling in his gut knowing that everything he wants is only
They approached his car, and Dean opened the passenger door for Cas too. Cas didn’t enter right away. They stood with the car door open between them, Dean’s expression so openly hopeful it made Cas’s chest hurt. “This doesn’t change what I said before,” he said, because he had to.
Cas was shedding his coat - a proper one this time - and said, “Better now that I’m here.”
Dean suddenly wanted to crawl into bed and pull the covers over his head.  He definitely didn’t want to talk to Cas.  “Hey.”
“I’ll get it, man,” Aaron said, going past Dean toward the cooler.
Dean snorted.  “One who knows you spent at least three hours standing in line for that pie.”
Cas searched his face.“She’s… dead?”
Then Cas remembers.  “Your lease is up next month.”
“How long is she in town?”
Dean hadn’t asked on the phone with Cas; he’d been too eager to disconnect the call and lay in bed and
“No,” Cas said, and Dean felt the vice grip around his heart loosen.  “But I want to know.  If it does happen - “
“A plan,” Dean confirmed. “For - for the new year.” His eyes were fierce, though his lips were pressed together tightly. He waited for a response.
Cas stood up.  “I should be going.  Daphne’s going to drop me… somewhere.  I’m not sure yet.  But I’ll let you know when I’m there.”  He said the last bit to Mary, not to Dean.  He hugged Mary.  “I’ll see you soon.”
“I’m sure he’d be happy to hear that,” Sam said. He slung his messenger bag over his head and adjusted the strap. “Even before the party he’d always mention how interesting your last conversation with him was.”
“You called me a dumbass,” Cas breathed. His palm against Dean’s cheek was finally warm.
He was not sure, however, that he could stomach
“I want to,” Cas said simply. “You’ve spent enough nights on my couch.”
“That bad?”
“No, no,” Dean said, laughing to cover up his nerves. “It’s just - some of the authors I work with - y’know, they’re - secretive about - “
“I’m your husband.”
“You don’t need to look so worried,” Dean says, grinning.
“I would.”
“Why is Dean standing on my doorstep?”
“Is it?” Cas said.  “She’s admired you since the day you met.  She hangs on your every word.  Is it so hard to imagine that someone might feel that way for you?”
Cas hadn’t said anything when Dean had put it up, too moved to speak, and all Dean had done to acknowledge the moment was to pat Cas once on the shoulder before taking the empty box into the back.
Without thinking, he placed a hand on Dean’s back. Dean froze.
You should come get it now.”
When he came back to the dining table with his treasure in his hands, Dean’s eyes widened.  “No shit,” he said.
haunted me for two years.”  Cas could see someone approaching, probably to check on Dean’s shoulder.  “But then you waltzed into the office like you’d never left, and I finally had the opportunity to ask - but I found that I didn’t care anymore,” Cas said.  “Whatever love and concern I had for you, you destroyed it.”  He knew the words would hurt Dean, and he said them still, even though his voice was shaking.
Cas sighs and stares forlornly at his hair in the mirror.
“He forgot his phone.”
“Cas, I swear to god, if you’re spoiling yourself for the episode tonight - “
So Dean puts his hands on his knees.  He breathes.  He does it for Cas, even if Cas may not ever want to speak to him again.
Cas figured it was probably like looking into a mirror.
“Why were you following me?” Charlie asked, still sounding skeptical.
So Dean, Cas, and Jack went on with their lives - separate but hopelessly intertwined, and all Dean could do was lie awake at night hoping that when the time came, he’d be able to make sense of the mess of tangled knots they’d created.
Meanwhile, Dean was staring down six loaded guns and barely seemed moved.  “He mentioned his car was giving him trouble; I offered to help.”
sleeping.
Dean was halfway to his desk. He felt manic in that moment and despite himself, he laughed a little. He’d miss Cas desperately if this went wrong. “You gotta stop rewatching that episode, Cas.”
Cas’s heart was on the verge of combusting at Dean’s hushed, reverent voice. “Buying a house was the closest I could get to the life I wanted.”
Dean, on the other hand, apparently disagreed.  “You goddamn idiot,” he hissed.
“Just sit down and try to stay awake,” Cas ordered, rolling his eyes at Dean’s pout.  He went to the kitchen and began a brew, but halfway through the process he looked over at Dean to see that his guest had lost the battle to sleep, despite still sitting up.  Cas shook his head in affection and set the coffee to keep warm.
“You know that other lady’s name?” Dean asked, remembering that there was another new face in the backyard.
Cas is subbed at 87 minutes for his last ovation from the home crowd.  They adore him as he adores them, and Dean knows this last walk off the field has got to be an emotionally harrowing moment for Cas.
Sam was holding his phone up to his ear, but when he saw Cas, he placed a hand over the mouthpiece.  “Hey, Cas, Merry Christmas!”
He shoved his phone in his bag, grabbed his keys, and walked out on Dean like Dean had once walked out on Cas.
Dean gazed somberly back at Cas, his face tilted upward and to the side. His hands, held fast in his lap by Cas’s, were cold. “You don’t get it, Cas.”
“It’s not really my scene,” Dean hedged, then ordered another whiskey.  “You want another drink?”
Dean scowled.  Cas felt a sick satisfaction at the expression.
“Eileen’s got your boy wrapped around her finger,” Bobby said.  “I like her.”
Cas watched Dean’s face carefully. “Of course,” he said softly, scared that any other words might shatter the dream he’d walked into.
The breath left Dean’s lungs when the implication began to sink in.  Dean’s mouth went slack as he sucked in a startled breath.  “Sorry?”
When Eileen drew back, she smiled at both of them.  “Sam, do that later,” she said, turning to her husband.
Dean laughed under his breath.  “Yes,
“Time helps,” Cas had said, unsure of what else to say.
Dean was already reaching for him. “Yep. Can’t make out with a hangover.”
Cas looked at their hands, tangled together between them. “Will you wear a ring?”
Barely able to believe that there was still a chance their friendship could be mended, Dean asked, “Do you
Dean snorted and rolled his eyes, reaching for his beer. “Really, Cas?”
Dean sighed. “Should I have just sprung it on you? Regular old Tuesday over lasagna or something? ‘Hey, great lasagna - by the way, that book I bought you? The one we analyzed over lunch three months ago? I wrote it. Also that blog we talked about? Mine too. Surprise! How’s your brother?’”
” he mocked.  He looked at the seat in front of Cas’s desk, swept off some imagined piece of lint off of its upholstery, and sat down.
Dean’s next inhale was loud in the mid-winter silence. His exhale was unsteady.
Another silence descended. Dean frowned at his meal, his appetite lost.
“Oh,” Aaron said.  “I thought you preferred we take your car.  We can start taking mine, if you want.  I don’t mind.”  He started humming along to the track playing through the stereo and looked out the window.
Dean’s smile is slow to grow.  He’s still stunned that this force of a man who spent his nights in Dean’s dreams will spend every night from now on in Dean’s bed as well.
Dean clenched his fist to avoid slamming a palm into his forehead.
“I recall saying something along those lines,” Cas confirmed, throat tight. His eyes were starting to sting, but he refused to look away.
“Well, you gotta do better than that. Apparently there’s a bunch of middle-aged ladies who are after me.”
“Stop complaining,” Cas had chided.  “You like when your mom asks you to do things for her.”
“Dean and I are together,” Cas said, smiling cheekily at Dean.  His expression turned startled when he heard the clatter of the dog food container on the floor.
meant a past, and regardless of the stupid shit Dean pulled over the years, it was a past that no one could erase, not even Daphne.
Cas gave him a tentative smile of his own. “I’m looking forward to it.”
Dean was chopping onions for chili. “You’ll feel better once you stop fighting it,” he said, blinking rapidly through the stinging of his eyes.
She smiled.  “I’m not sure,” she said.  “My parents’ health improved, so I’m taking a bit of ‘me time’ while I can.  I’m staying with my friend Gilda for the time being.  We just learned she lives just down the street from Sam.”
On a number of occasions, Dean had steadfastly refused to enter a house because of some imagined flaw in the architecture. “I hope you’re right,” Cas said.
“I dedicated the goddamn book to you, didn’t I? Of course I was going to tell you.”
Dean shoved the thought of Cas from his head.  Dean didn’t need to be cockblocked by his own irritable thoughts.  Gilda turned toward him when she reached the bar and smiled.  The smile reached her eyes.  Not for the first time, Dean was struck by the otherworldly quality she had about her, like she’d been born among the stars and found everything about earth infinitely curious.
“Dean - “
“If I don’t?”
Cas stared at him, disbelieving.  “‘I’m your ride,’” he repeated.  His voice shook.  He felt manic.  “You made me believe you were a traitor to the country, Dean.  I treated you like
“Not gonna lie, Cas - I’m glad to see you,” he said, navigating the Impala out of the waiting area.
“Then hire me,” Cas said.
“I’m serious,” Cas said.  “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“You know,” Dean says, grinning, “I did.”
Cas ignored him.  Dean threw himself onto Cas’s couch - a hand-me-down and probably filthy - and stared up at the ceiling.
Cas looked down too, admiring the shine of the dress shoes.  When he looked up, Dean was watching him with a furrow between his brows.  Cas grabbed his coat from the closet.  “On a date,” he said finally.
“So what is it?” Charlie said into his shoulder.  “Am I not woman enough for you?  Too nerdy?  What?”
“You’re hired the next time I need to cut onions,” Cas says as he washes his hands.
Cas offered Dean a tentative smile, so small it was barely there.  But his voice was kind.  “That was thoughtful of you,” he said.
The barbecue had been hosted at a quaint little house that Sam had been renting with his brother Dean.
Cas heard the slam of the Impala’s door outside before he even got off the phone with Dean.
“When?”
Cas had been on his feet all day. Seated at his little plastic table, he massaged a cramp in his calf. “I’m not gifted with charm, Dean. If anything, my lack of social skills are chasing customers away.”
It became a problem very fast, and Cas was quick to pick up on it.
“We can’t all have sophisticated tastes like you,” Cas said, smiling. He usually tried to keep his affection for Dean under wraps, but Cas was too tired, too happy to be in Dean’s space again.
miss each other.”
Cas tried to put words to the mess of thoughts in his head.  “I - I don’t know if I know how to…be like we were before,” he admitted.
“Kids like farts.”
“G’night, Cas.”
the lonely one?
Dean figured that was a rhetorical question, but to imply that he could be anything
“No one I trust,” Dean said sullenly. He rubbed a piece of imaginary dirt off the window. “I can’t hire just anyone, Cas.”
left them alone to get to know each other.”
“Good,” Cas growls, and Dean likes that a lot.
Dean dropped his hand.  The absurdity of the situation took some time to sink in.  When it finally did, all he could do was collapse back onto the arm of Charlie’s couch and stare at her ceiling.  “Never let me speak to another person again,” he said.
No, he thought.  He was not alone.
“How’s Cas?” Charlie asked, effectively popping the bubble of peace that Dean had almost convinced himself was real.
Cas led Daphne and her friend to Sam first, probably guessing (correctly) that Dean needed a little time to calm down before greeting his ex.  Mary joined him.
Cas returned with a glass of water that he watched Dean drink with a stern look. Later, as he lifted the covers on his side of the bed, he said, “I hope you’ve learned your lesson about drinking.”
“Of all the days I should be able to sleep in, it’s Christmas day,” Cas said stubbornly.
He was angry at himself not just for saying yes but for the fact that by saying yes, the
Cas just sighed in defeat.
Cas spent two hours pacing a hole in his rug before he decided he needed to direct his energy toward something productive.  It was 8pm, but he grabbed his work things and drove to the office.
Cas laughed.  “It literally just happened ten minutes ago,” Cas said.  “I barely believe it myself.”
“Seriously,” Claire continued, “The sexual tension is appalling.”
“Uh, yeah?”  Then, tentatively, she asked, “Will
Cas had to laugh.  “One night where I get
Dean shook his head.  “I get it,” he murmured.  “It’s fine.”  His throat bobbed.  He licked his lips.  “Can I - “ He didn’t finish the question.  He leaned in instead and waited, his breath unsteady.
Cas sent him a dry look through his eyelashes.  “You give me many reasons to worry, Dean; it’s not a good thing.”
“This is Aaron,” Dean said, feeling a little self-conscious.  “Friend of mine and Charlie’s.”
Dean heaved the paper bag onto Cas’s countertop.  “Just some booze, dude, relax.”
He felt the tension leave Dean’s body.  He heard it too, in the sigh that Dean released.  Dean ran his other hand over his face.  “Wow,” he said.
Dean met Cas’s gaze, frowning, eyes tired. After a while he gave in. “Fine,” he said. He reached for the plastic wrap. “Two hours.”
At least this way Cas can’t knock me out, Dean thought.
Cas ducked his head bashfully, but he put a hand on Dean’s back in acknowledgment. “Thank you.”
Dean’s smile was indulgent. “I’m glad,” he said.
No answer.
“You were thinking it,” Dean said confidently, his head mashed up against Cas’s chin.
Dean came to him about a half hour later with two beers in his hand. Sam edged away so that Dean could get between him and Cas. Cas was not ignorant of the elbow nudge that Sam gave to Dean.
“Give him a chance,” Dean said, then walked away before the man had a chance to respond. With any luck, Dean knew, the guy would find the note scribbled hastily on the back of the front cover:
And Dean’s intuition was right, because Cas’s smile was back, and it actually reached his eyes.  “Fine,” he agreed.  “Whatever you say.”
“Happy New Year, Sam.”  With a sad little jolt, Cas realized he missed Sam too.  He wasn’t as close to him as he was to Dean, but Sam had always been kind and warm and welcoming.  “I hope you’re all doing well.”
“Dean, may I speak with you?”
But Eileen grabbed one of his pants legs.  When he looked down at her, she was shaking her head.  “Not a good idea,” she said.  The look in her eyes told Dean she knew more than she let on.  “Trust me.”
Charlie and Dean exchanged winces and followed her out into the backyard, where a folding table had been set up for the food.  Charlie immediately went to greet Eileen (and Willow), leaving Aaron and Dean by the food.
“Because you left?”
Dean watched as the redhead bid a final goodbye to Sam - he had to bend, and she was stretched to her tiptoes - and then walk away.  She tripped on a stray chair leg, then looked around to see if anyone saw.  Her eyes caught Dean’s.  She smiled sheepishly, then turned away.  ...Then she bumped into Cas and immediately started frantically apologizing.
Cas could think of nothing else that gesture could mean, so he slowly pulled back the covers and climbed into the bed, the sheets warm with fever. “I’m going to catch this bug from you, and you’re going to pay for it,” he murmured, but his bravado fell flat when Dean sidled closer.
Half-asleep and half-hidden under his blanket, however, he was much more eloquent: “Tell the creep he can fuck off and let us sleep.”
Dean puts his elbows on his knees and runs his hands through his hair, trying to breathe, trying to convince himself that the situation is not irredeemable.  Cas is not an irrational, unreasonable person.  If Dean could just explain to him -
This newfound bravery carries Dean back out into the hallway.  Still, it is a fragile bravery, and it makes him pause outside of his door and put a steadying hand on the wall.  It makes him waver.  It makes him weak.  But Dean pushes on.  His feet are still bare.  The tile is freezing.
And judging by Dean’s behavior over the last few weeks, he wasn’t going to go away either - not unless Cas asked him to.
Charlie grinned.  “It’s probably because she’s into women too.”
Dean quashed an inappropriate Optimus Prime joke. “Power still out where you are?”
Daphne was staring at Dean.  Dean refused to look at her.  He got up and dusted off his hands.  “I’m gonna go after them.”
“I’m finally allowed to,” Cas murmured, lips against Dean’s temple. “Why would I stop?”
It occurred to Dean Winchester, as he watched his brother and new sister-in-law sway awkwardly on the dance floor of their wedding reception, that at that moment, he had everything he wanted.  Sure, he wasn’t wealthy or famous, but Dean Winchester didn’t need money or fame to be content.  No, all he needed was what he already had: a good job, his own place, a badass car, a wonderful mother, a loyal best friend, the biggest dork of a brother he could ask for, and now (finally) - a gorgeous, too-good-for-his-brother sister-in-law.
“He seemed easy enough to talk to, to me,” Charlie said.
Dean is): “Dean, please talk to me.”
Everything Dean said was true, but he didn’t quite understand where Cas was coming from, and Cas didn’t know how to explain it to Dean without getting too close to the painful truth. A bigger apartment was indeed the most logical choice for Cas’s situation, but
“That turn you on, babe?” Dean breathed, delirious, laughing a little.  “That I’m yours?  That you’re gonna have this forever?”
“My door’s always open to you,” Dean said sincerely. He said it to the fridge, though, because looking at Cas at that moment was too much. “I mean that.”
Anxiety worms its way under Cas’s skin, but he’s determined to quash it. He moves toward the sink near Dean to start dinner. He had plans to make a pot of chili again, but for the life of him he can’t remember where to start. After washing his hands, he opens the cupboard and grabs a few spices that sound familiar. Dean is still leaning against the counter a few feet away.
Daphne.
Cas swallows. The towel in his hand is crushed by his nervous fist. “My offer still stands,” he says. “My home is always open to you.”
XI.  	Cas could tell there was something on Dean’s mind just like he had always been able to tell, but nothing good could come out of anything that Dean wanted to say - at least not anymore.  If it was bad news, it was bad news.  If it was good news, it was still bad news.  Dean was a felon.  Dean was not his best friend.
When they parted, Cas looked overwhelmed: his blue eyes were dark, his lips were still parted, and the grip he had on Dean’s waist was tight enough to leave marks.
Dean’s thoughts were being pulled in every direction.  He struggled to stay with the conversation, though his head was running through the number of possibilities of running into Daphne if he visited Sam any time soon.
Sam gave a long-suffering sigh. “Can you put me on speaker?”
being Dean’s supervisor.  She knew of their history, she knew it would be difficult despite Cas’s training - so
He had nothing yet to fill the house with - not even a car - but owning a house would at least get him a little closer to a dream that seemed so out of reach.
Mary tried to catch her breath.  Her smile was wobbly.  “I knew it would happen,” she said shakily.  She reached for Dean, and Dean, relieved, let her fall forward and embrace him.  “I’m so happy for you,” she said, sniffling.
Dean frowned.  Charlie?  Cheerful Charlie who never spoke a sad word in her life?  “What?  Why?”
He knocked on her door barely 20 minutes after she messaged him.  She answered with a smile.  She was wearing another T-shirt bearing another obscure reference, and her orange and green plaid pajama bottoms clashed horribly with her hair.
“Not in so many words, no.”
In front of the fireplace that Dean had fallen in love with.
Cas enjoyed the warmth of the pie and of Dean in his kitchen while Dean spoke.
Dean cursed under his breath. “Gonna be hell to pay the next time I see her.”
“Not because you’re willing to sleep with me,” he added.  He kissed Cas’s jaw.  “You’re perfect even without your hand in my pants.”
they’d watched together
Cas can hear the smile in Dean’s answer: “You know I will, Cas.”
“Anyway, tell me more about this friend of yours,” Charlie said.  She’d already ordered a drink and was sipping on it like it was a milkshake, both of her fists pushed up to her face, making her look like a goldfish.
Dean’s hands were beautiful, but they were clumsy with the corkscrew. “Well, if these things came with instructions, you’d have your damn alcohol.”
Cas’s face fell for the barest moment but Cas hid his disappointment quickly. He shook his head. “I don’t need pity, Dean - Just say you don’t - “
A groggy voice answered: “Take it all. Just leave me alone.”
Another affectionate smile brightened Cas’s voice. “I’ll take that as a no.”
Sam groaned.  It sounded muffled, like he’d put a pillow over his face or faceplanted into his mattress.
not to
It was a little more than half an hour when Dean exited the bathroom, looking a little less green and dressed in fresh clothes and a robe. He saw Cas on the armchair and said, “Toast was just as good coming back up as it was going down.”
“Merry Christmas, Dean.”
“Why did I even pick him?” Dean asked.  “What kind of friend am I to pick
Here, however, lying on Charlie’s couch, trying and failing to recuperate from the barrage of revelations he’d suffered, the ache he felt for Cas was overwhelming.  He wanted Cas in his house, in his bed, in his arms - he wanted Cas’s breath in his lungs and Cas’s hands in his hair.  He wanted Cas.
The closer Dean got to the redhead the slower he felt he was moving.  How much had he drank?  Jesus.
“I hope so,” Dean said. He caught Cas’s eye then looked away, caught in the act. He swallowed. “Listen, Cas, we gotta talk.”
Cas turned away, determined not to be caught looking at Dean’s butt after that comment.  “I made lasagna.”
Dean waits for a response. When he doesn’t get one, he gives Cas a pretend scowl. “You gotta say
he tells himself.
“What, and you’re Mr. Social?”
Eileen didn’t bother to help.  She put Willow down.  “Say again?” she said, looking confused.  Her hands came up to sign along with her words like it did when she was flustered.
No sarcastic reply, no inquiry after Dean’s health, nothing besides one word.
Dean took a deep breath.
who exactly Sam was messaging, and it made his stomach flip again.
“I’m surprised your appetite’s returned,” Cas said, swallowing the lump in his throat. He took a seat at the table.
Cas continued guiding Dean to the bedroom, wincing when Dean tried to pull away to look at the baubles on the Christmas tree. “Why?” Cas asked, tugging Dean away by the torso. “Will you take him outside and teach him a lesson?”
Cas’s cheeks were pink.  He looked down at his shoes.  “Oh,” he said, and somehow in that one syllable he carried a dozen different meanings.
anything about setting me up.”
Dean licked his lips.  “Why do you think I’m here, Cas?”
Cas smiled, his eyes drifting closed. “I don’t doubt it,” he said. It was the confidence in his answer that fueled Dean’s reply.
“I’d wear clown shoes and a tutu for the rest of my life if you married me right now.”
“Why wait?  It’s a Sunday; they’ll all be home.”
“Coming right up,” Dean said, already on the way to the stove. His heart was full, simply because Cas had something he wanted and it was something Dean could provide.
There was a long silence on the end of the line.  Then, “Okay.  It would have been nice to hear from him himself, but I understand.”
Cas drew back.  “What?”
“Oh, my god,” Dean said.  “We’re going.  See ya, Cas.”
said it to him.  His
“Would it make you feel better if I told you Sam was holding the phone?”
Cas shook his head, picked up his pen, and opened a folder.  “I know.  Why do you think I was avoiding you?”
“When would one begin telling a child about Santa? And how does one deal with the inevitable fallout when they realize he isn’t real?”
“I mean it seems like he’s into you,” Mary said, arching an eyebrow.
“Sounds like a great idea,” Cas said.
“I don’t know if I can - “
Dean had downed half his glass.  He wiped his mouth with his sleeve and made a face.  “That cannot be good for you.”  At Cas’s look, he rolled his eyes.  “Alright, already, I’m sitting down.”  He took the two glasses and set them at Cas’s small dining table.  Then he sat down and stared at the plates.  “Where’d you get these plates, dude?”
“I wouldn’t quite put it that way,” Cas says.  “But it’s a fair enough statement.”
Dean frowned a little petulantly.  “Sending me home already?”
There was pink high in Cas’s cheeks. “The ideas I have are all absurd.” He swallowed. Flipped through the manuscript, turned it around and flipped through it again.
“You good?” Sam said lowly.
By the time the water was hot, Dean - still shirtless - was walking slowly into the bathroom, his eyes squinting in the early morning sunlight streaming through the window. He had the clothes Cas picked out for him in one arm. With his free hand, he clapped Cas on the shoulder. “Thanks, dude.”
“Hey,” Cas said too.  He was so close to Dean that if he tilted his head up just a little, and Dean leaned in just a little in turn…
They had kissed, once. It had been at Sam’s wedding reception, both of them tucked into a dark corner where Dean had hidden a bottle of whiskey for them. It was after pouring a generous helping into Cas’s glass that Dean had looked up at Cas with a mischievous glint in his eyes—and Cas hadn’t been able to help it: overwhelmed with affection, he’d leaned in and kissed his best friend.
Cas looked him oddly, but he said nothing. He led Dean away from the reception tent (where Gabriel and Garth were taking turns to dance with Jack in their arms) and stopped when they were far enough away to hear each other without yelling.
Dean just pulled the covers tighter around himself.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
And if Cas were being honest with himself, the thought of being rejected by Dean - beautiful, charismatic, kind Dean - that was a little tough to swallow.
“And make you look bad?  Honey, I would never do that in front of a boyfriend.”
Cas started jotting down a note in the margin of the file in front of him.  Dean reached out and covered Cas’s hand, stopping him.  Immediately Cas grabbed his hand back.  His blood roared in his ears.  “Don’t.”
“What? I’m fine!”
to each other?
Dean had taken over as Cas’s informal cooking instructor for a time, so they’d been spending a lot of time in Dean’s kitchen. He had smiled then, a little melancholy, as he watched Cas chop an onion. Then he’d said, “Yeah, time helped. But you being around helped too.” It had been the first time he’d said anything of the kind to Cas.
“You’re burning up again,” Cas said, feeling pity tug his lips into a frown. Before he could reach out a hand to feel Dean’s forehead, Dean made a disgruntled noise and pulled on Cas’s wrist. Cas stopped, confused. Dean was squinting at him, fresh from a fevered sleep, probably only half aware of his actions. Astounded, Cas stuttered, “Do you want me to - “ He motioned to the empty space in the bed next to Dean. All Dean did was pull again on Cas’s wrist.
Dean put a hand on Jack’s back. “Sure, bud,” he said. “You can tell him what you want for Christmas.”
Cas smiled at him. He said two words: “Marry me.”
Cas smiled. “What if I use my vacation days?”
Dean swore under his breath.  “You’re fucking things up, Cas.”
Cas took Dean’s hand, fond. In his other hand, his phone buzzed twice. Two messages from Claire lit up his screen. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dean checking his phone as well.
“I’ll be here at 7? Is that okay?” Dean had put both his hands on his thighs, and his fingers were tapping restlessly against the thick denim of his jeans.
“Yup.”
He looked through the peephole and felt his stomach flip.
disappointed.”
When Dean was done, Cas hit the lever and handed Dean a paper towel while the toilet ran.
Cas tried to shrug in nonchalance, though he was distracted by Dean’s lips, mere inches away.  “Merry Christmas.”
Dean’s lips quirked upward in a show of amusement, but Cas sensed the doubt behind it. He sighed but could find no words to convince Dean.
“Cas,” Dean repeated, testing out the name in his mouth. “Alright. Well. I’m glad the book changed your mind.” He was usually much better with his words, but something about Cas’s voice - deep, a little rumbly - was tying up his tongue.
Their routine takes shape over time and ends up looking a little like this:
Cas’s mouth dropped open, but he had no reply.
Suddenly, from his room, music begins to play.  It’s his ringtone for Sam.
"You're not weak just because you're human, Cas," Dean answered, shaking his head. That kind of thinking was what made him weak, not his human body. Dean knew Cas was stronger than he let on, especially since he'd held off the vamp the night before. Cas would be a good fighter, he just had to believe it himself. "But if it means that much to you, I'll teach you a few things. How to defend yourself against bloodsuckers, werewolves, whatever you can think of. I'm not a great teacher, but-"
Dean sniffed and pushed away the tears, leaning into Cas' gentle touch. "It will be, just as soon as I get you home safe and find John."
“I appreciate your concern,” Cas said, snapping Dean back to reality. “Thanks to you, I’m okay.” He had rested his arms back in his lap, the blanket pooled around his hips, his skin now covered by the shirt Dean lent him.
"Over here!" Cas' voice called from out of Dean's sight, catching the vamp off guard. Dean took his window of opportunity, flinging the thing off of him, watching it slide a few feet across the hard floor. Dean finally spotted Cas, standing right where Dean threw the vamp. In an impressive show of his strength, Cas grabbed the vamp by it's hair as it kneeled on the ground. It could have overpowered Cas, probably, if Cas hadn't yanked it's head back quickly, throwing the vamp into shock as Cas swung the machete without hesitation. The head slid off like it was the easiest thing Cas had ever done, hanging there as Cas watched the body fall to the ground with a loud thud. Then, he dropped the head, wiping his hands on his coat with a small sigh.
"I thought you told him!" they said at the same time, followed by deep sighs from them both as they realized they had fucked up.
Jo scooted closer, grabbing Dean’s good shoulder to force him to turn back towards her, meeting her determined gaze. “There’s never a good reason to not be with someone you love, Dean,” she insisted, squeezing his shoulder for emphasis. Dean swallowed the lump in his throat, trying to look away. She grabbed his chin, holding him hostage there. “If the only thing keeping you apart is your father, we’ll find a way around it.”
"Sounds great, Charlie," he agreed, returning the smile as she started taking a few steps back, reluctant to leave Dean sitting there alone. He stood to show her he was heading back inside himself. "I'll see you then," he added, giving a small wave as he opened the door, watching Charlie walk off before he stepped back into the house with a small sigh. The house was quiet. Everyone was shut into their own rooms, leaving Dean with nothing left to do but lay down on the couch, his bed for the foreseeable future. He flopped down on the couch with a sigh, resting his hands behind his head as he stared at the ceiling, wishing he had something to do. All of his books were still packed into the trunk of the Impala. Sam was sleeping. Jack was enjoying the perks of having his own room. Cas was ignoring him. Until dinner, he was on his own.
Dean felt the atmosphere change and for whatever reason, he found himself reaching for a hand to hold onto. Cas glanced at him in slight surprise, his gaze shifting from their intertwined fingers to Dean's soft smile. "You don't have to keep going," Dean assured him, and at that, Cas smiled sadly, his grip finally relaxing into Dean's like it was the most normal thing in the world for them to be holding hands.
"That would be me," someone said from behind Dean, and then suddenly someone had a hold on his arm and was twisting it painfully behind his back in a way his arm didn't normally twist. Dean whipped his head back to get a look at the evil witch, only to be met by soft features and a sweet, pretty smile. "The name's Jo Harvelle," she offered, tightening her painful hold on Dean's arm as he grimaced and tried not to scream at how much it actually hurt. "And trust me, I know what I'm doing."
"There's only three rooms," Jack shared, folding an old quilt over his arm as he hugged a pillow to his chest. "Castiel and I can share a room. He said he'd sleep on the floor."
Dean sucked in a sharp breath, leaning back on his hands as Cas tugged on the waistband of his jeans. “W-Wait, you don’t have to-” he started, but then Cas was shoving Dean’s shirt up past his stomach and sucking on Dean’s hip. Suddenly, Dean forgot how to form coherent sentences. He brought his injured arm in front of him, threading his fingers through Cas’ hair as his good arm held him up. “
"I'm sorry I scared you," Dean mumbled, covering Cas' hand with his own. "I promise I'm okay." Cas lowered his hands from Dean's face, sliding them over his arms instead. He lingered on Dean's sling for a moment, frowning deeply, until he grabbed Dean's other hand, still wrapped in bandages that had blood soaking through from sitting all night. "I'm okay," Dean repeated, taking his hand out of Cas' to gently grab his chin, forcing Cas to look at him.
“Why are you two interrupting us on our day off?” Dean asked, giving them a half-hearted glare. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work?”
"Do you want us to stay here?" Cas asked, his voice still groggy from being asleep. Dean wanted to lock eyes with him as soon as his voice touched Dean's eyes, but he ignored that urge.
“Cas, don’t worry about it,” he answered, finally getting Cas to look at him again. He licked his dry lips, wishing he could see the blue in Cas’ eyes right now. He imagined how beautiful they’d look in this moment, right before their lips met. “You’ll remember this one,” Dean promised, his hand moving to cup the back of Cas’ neck to draw him in closer. Cas let out a shuddering breath right before their lips met, but he didn’t pull away. He melted into Dean’s touch, his hands relaxing against Dean’s chest for a moment before he slid them up over Dean’s shirt, tangling his fingers in Dean’s hair with a light tug. Dean groaned slightly from the unexpected sensation, giving Cas the opportunity to glide his tongue over Dean’s bottom lip slowly before delving into Dean’s own mouth. In that moment, everything felt like it would be okay. With Cas pretty much in Dean’s lap, licking into his mouth, his hands all over Dean. . . there was nothing better that Dean could think of. This was everything he’d been wanting for the past couple of months.
"Thank god," Jo mumbled, pressing her cheek against his chest as he gave in, wrapping his one arm around her shoulders briefly. "I promise, I'll make this up to you. It's gonna be an awesome date," she promised, pulling away when she realized Dean had already let go. "I'll come to your place to get you when I'm ready, okay?"
Dean stuffed his hands in his pockets, impatiently rocking back on his heels. “Yeah?”
Cas' face softened, his hands reaching for Dean again to pull him closer. "Thank you for saving me, Dean."
The girl stared at him a little longer, finally straightening up as if she were going to let him inside, though she didn't rush to move out of the way. "No offense, but you don't look the type," she said, finally smiling a little in amusement. "If you know what I mean."
"We're a mess," Cas mumbled, not particularly worried as he tugged Dean in for a sluggish kiss, nipping at Dean's bottom lip teasingly. Both his arms wrapped around Dean, gently pulling him in closer until Dean was resting his head on Cas' shoulder, his lips brushing against the sensitive skin of Cas' neck occasionally. "Napkins are in the living room," he added later, still neither of them moving beyond an occasional kiss wherever lips could reach.
"Breathe with me," Dean instructed, his voice as gently as his lips against Cas' ear, just barely there, ghosting across his skin. "Let me feel your chest rise and fall," he continued, talking Cas through his panic. Cas nodded, matching Dean's breaths, focusing on the feeling of Dean's hands on his chest, his strong fingers pressing into his skin. "That's good, Cas," Dean breathed, planting a kiss against Castiel's neck, a quick gesture, but it worked. Cas leaned back into Dean, taking another deep breath. For awhile, they stayed like that, just like before. Dean continued holding him until he was sure Cas was okay. "You okay?" Dean asked.
Sam immediately rolled his eyes, followed by a heavy sigh. "Dean, you really don't want to get me started on secret relationships," he insinuated, eyeing Dean seriously. Dean opened his mouth to ask what the hell he meant, but then he realized Sam was definitely talking about Cas. So the fucker did know. He gave Sam a death glare and Sam shrugged. "I'm just saying, neither of us are very smooth when it comes to our. . . partners."
“Dean, thank you for the help,” Cas said, falling into step beside him as they walked back towards the bunker. Jack walked close behind them. “We were in hiding for a week without food. When we didn’t hear the undead feeding on people outside anymore, we set out in search of a meal with no luck.”
Jack opened his mouth to reply, but Dean cut him off before he could say something stupid, like the truth. "He's sixteen," Dean lied, giving Jack a stern look when the kid looked like he was about to protest.
"You really like it here, don't you?" Dean wondered, a small smile gracing his lips. It was nice to see Sam like this. Comforting, even.
"I know you said not to worry, that you're not mad at me," she started, catching Dean's eyes and holding them. He felt like he'd be a huge jerk if he looked away, even if it was awkward. "But I still want to make it up to you," she continued, a light shade of red tinting her pale cheeks. "Forget about John trying to set us up, or whatever. This is me asking, Dean. Do you want to- would you like to go on a date tomorrow night?" she managed to get out.
Preview of next Chapter:
They sat there for a while waiting for Charlie to show up to drive Cas home, since he wasn’t working the copy room that day. When she did show up she practically tackled Dean in excitement over her brownies, saying that if his pancakes were any indication, she may propose to him from the brownies.
“I didn’t think it’d be like this,” Cas let slip after a beer too many.
“Since you met me,” Dean says, grinning in the way he knows irritates Cas to no end.  “Melted that cold heart of yours.”
“Nah, just us,” Dean said, slinging an arm over Cas’s shoulder.  “Your friendly neighborhood Dean and Cas.”
Dean shrugged him off.  Nothing Cas said mattered.  In fact, it mattered so little that Dean was going to prove him wrong.  Somehow.
Dean finally turned to Cas, but only to give him a skeptical look. “Cas, it’s not a vacation if you’re working somewhere else.”
The toast was ready, so Cas put that in front of Dean as well. “Eat up.”
“You’re just projecting,” Cas said, still tap-tapping away on his laptop.  Cas was a semi-successful sci-fi novelist.  He didn’t quite make enough to pay the bills, and he spent a considerable amount of effort budgeting, but he’d inherited just enough from his parents to survive.  Still, Dean was not above dropping by with a bag full of takeout - just to make sure Cas was eating.  The Mexican food from earlier was sitting uncomfortably in his stomach.
Dean tilted his head hopefully.
Dean looked at the owner of the hand.
When Cas stopped shaking and finally let their hands fall away from his dick, Dean turned his face into Cas’s temple.  “You good?” he whispered.
Dean, smirking, offloaded the six-packs into the fridge.  Cas handed the last one to him.  It felt like a win, like a sign of good things to come, so when he straightened and closed the fridge door, he held his hands out, nodding to the mess of ingredients on the counters.  “C’mon,” he said, “Give her to me and Cas.  You finish up here.”
Cas reached forward and took the other hand, trembling on her lap.  “Mary,” he said gravely.  He took a deep breath.
But so adjust my daily night
that would stop this conversation, because if what Dean was suspecting was true, Aaron was about to talk about
Cas was breathing very slowly through his nose.  Dean could hear the breaths he was taking: measured, deep.  “I’m saying,” Cas said, more quietly than before, “I’m saying that I think Charlie has feelings for you.”
Cas hedges.
“Sounds great,” Dean said, this time only moderately distracted by Cas’s eyes in the sunlight. “I’ll message you.”
“Alright,” Cas says, kissing Dean on the cheek.  “I’ll be there soon.”
What Cas saw in Dean, on the other hand, Dean had no idea. He didn’t ask, content not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and simply tried his best not to scare Cas away.
to ask me to marry you,” Cas said, squinting a little.
“If you say so,” Dean says, in the tone he’s reserved for when he doesn’t want to bother with Cas’s attitude.  He presses a buzzer.  A few seconds later, they’re being ushered up a set of stairs by a sweet old lady with curlers in her hair who coos over them and chatters about the possibility of having another wonderful tenant.  She opens up the apartment and lingers at the door while Dean and Cas wander.
look away despite impending doom is… profound. You should try your hand at poetry, Dean. You have good instincts.”
Cas knew he’d regret talking so much, but he also knew he’d be able to blame it on the alcohol in the morning, so he looked Dean in the eye and said, “So easy.”
Cas rolled his eyes but turned to face Dean anyway. “You haven’t had enough water,” he said. For some reason he gently touched the corner of Dean’s left eye. Then he stepped away, smiling. “Keep the bed warm.”
“Just sayin’, man,” Dean said, “I don’t want you to think I’m stopping you from… doin’ your thing.” His grin was weak.
There was a long, long pause.  “I’m not sure, Dean.”
“Now will you get in the damn car?” Dean begged, as he stepped away. “I’m hungry.”
“You got it, dude.  Take care while we’re gone, alright?”
Dean took a moment before he answered, jarred by the strangeness of Cas’s offer.  Cas had never asked before - he’d expected Dean to make his own.  “Uh, yeah,” Dean said.  “Thanks.”  He was being treated like a guest, and it only hurt because once upon a time, he’d been treated like family.
“You know what I mean.”
Charlie’s voice was quiet.  “I heard you guys fought about me.”
Something about the look she gave him made Cas feel weirdly protective.  He shoved the feeling to the side and buried it deep.  “He’s… doing what’s been asked of him.”
Sam edged out past him and slunk away toward Eileen, who was sneaking pictures of Gilda and Charlie.
“Do we have a secret kid hidden away somewhere?”
Dean’s cheeks heat under Cas’s observation.  “Whatever.  We gonna forget it or what?”
“Have you heard from Aaron lately?” she asked.  “We were supposed to binge
“People like this crap?” Dean asked, picking up the bottle to squint at the label. “I can’t even
A long moment of silence stretches between them.  Finally, Cas says dryly, “You thought you were dreaming.”  He sounds almost irritated.
“But you’ve talked about it?”
Sam ran a hand over his mouth like he was trying to stop himself from saying anything else, but Sam was nothing if not nosy. “We both know never’s not an option. It’s gotta be now, Dean. Or if not now, then soon. You’re already playing house with Cas. Plus there’s a kid involved now - a kid who absolutely adores you - so I hate to say it, but if things have to go south, it has to happen before Jack’s any older.”
Dean kissed him softly, just once, in reply.  He was tired, and Cas’s shoulder still twinged.  There were nights that it seemed they couldn’t ever get close enough, but on this night they slept.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I just wanna get out of his hair, alright? It’s bad enough I’m sick; I shouldn’t have to make anyone my nurse, especially on a fucking holiday.”
“Surely your landlord won’t kick you out - “ Cas shuts his trap when Dean sends him a look because they both know his landlord’s reputation.  At a loss, Cas wanders over and stands behind the couch.  For a while they watch the news.  The governor is late to his press conference and the anchor is repeating the talking points of the breaking news.  Cas’s eyes slide to Dean, sitting on the right side of the couch.  Cas knows there’s a permanent divot in the cushion from all the time he’s spent there.  Struck by a sudden idea, Cas says, “If you don’t find a place, you can take my couch for as long as you need.”
“First of all,” Cas said, very slowly, not wanting to speak but wanting to put the record straight, “You and I are not ‘partners’; I’m an FBI Special Agent, and you’re a convicted felon who had the good fortune to be useful to the bureau.”  He conceded an irritated huff.  “Also, please refer to ‘Amara’ as ‘director,’ or ‘ma’am.’”
Dean braced himself.  “Know what?”
Dean lets his smile answer for him.  He leans in again.
Defeated, Dean turns around, but he can’t find it in him to look at Cas.  He grips the edge of the counter behind him to steady himself and stares at the sight of his toes against the white tile of their apartment.  “Just forget it,” he says again.  “It didn’t happen.”  He’s desperate to abandon this morning as the nightmare it was.
“Not for you?” Cas repeated dryly.
They stayed for most of the day, calling Mary and Bobby over to tell them the good news about Sam and Eileen.  Dean embarrassed himself by crying even more than his mom, but Cas’s hand stayed locked in his for most of the afternoon, which made up for it.
Dean didn’t make a move to serve himself a slice of pie.  He was staring instead at Cas.  “That line went around the block, dude.”
Dean was rinsing Cas’s plate. It took a few seconds. When he was finished, he turned around and wiped his hands on a towel, watching the movement of his own hands intently. His eyebrows were furrowed. “You wouldn’t interrupt anything,” he said eventually, then met Cas’s gaze. His eyes were determined. “So come over whenever.”
Dean’s mouth twitched upward.  “Oh, so when you called me out about the flirting, it was because you were jealous?”
Dean stared at him for another long moment, then he nodded, looking away, resolute. “Yeah,” he muttered to himself. “Yeah, okay.” Then he looked at Cas again, determination in the set of his mouth. “Cas, can I kiss you?”
Dean ran a hand over his face, unsure about what to do about this new complication. Then he remembered the beer that he’d bought for movie night and proceeded to the fridge, intending to get well and truly drunk.
Eileen gave Cas a look. “Don’t buy a house.”
None of this conversation made any sense to Cas. “Why does this feel like a goodbye, Dean?”
CHAPTER PREVIEW:
Dean wakes up and does something about his dreams
The fact that Cas doesn't do "getting to know you", he just jumps into "here's my life story" and Dean just goes along with it.
-Cas's last name
-Cas has a very dirty mouth
Our baby bois have a big talk coming up.....
“It’s not like that, Dad. Cas doesn't… we’re just friends, okay? Can you guys ever just be normal? I appreciate that you support my sexuality but at this rate I almost wish you didn’t. Just because I like boys and girls doesn’t mean every person I hang out with is someone I’m trying to date. This is why I don’t have friends over, you both are too much. I don’t care about Sammy teasing me, he’s my brother, that's what brothers do, but you are my parents. Being embarrassing is one thing but you guys are just too intense.” Dean was frustrated. Before anyone could press the matter any further, they pulled up to the soccer pitch. Sam ran out to join the team and Dean decided to sit away from his parents. Sam’s team won and he opted to go to get pizza with the team. The drive home with Dean and his parents was a very quiet one.
“What if she doesn’t like me, you know, like that?” Sam nervously rubbed the back of his neck.
When Dean got home, he went straight to his room. He did have a good amount of homework to do, so if anyone tried to bother him, he had an excuse. He was halfway through his reading for English when a timid knock came on his door.
“Well, after I pushed Meg down, she made a bitchy comment about my, and I’m only saying this because she did, my ‘retarded girlfriend’. I kicked dirt at her for using the R-word. She says rude names all the time, so it didn’t throw me off when she used that word..but I just...why would she think Eileen is my girlfriend, though.”
REAL LIFE PARALLELS: There actually is a greek restaurant near my house that makes the best pizza I have ever had. My first time hanging out witht the person who inspired this story, I was so reluctant to end our conversation, I skipped two classes (DON'T DO THAT). And the Twilight thing actually happened to them. They are very squeemish, indeed.
I'm on vacation this week and the wifi is terrible, so I am soooo happy I wrote a few chapters ahead. I am on a historical adventure so the week is packed but hopefully there will be another update in a few days if i can get the internet long enough....
Once all the pancakes were finished and stacked high on a platter, Cas went to wake Charlie up. He gripped her Ewok mug firmly and put a brave face on to encounter the beast that was his best friend in the mornings. Dean laughed as he heard a slew of profanities yelled and what must have been a pillow being hurled at a wall. He heard the muffled sound of Cas saying “breakfast” and the warpath was ended. A few minutes later, Charlie shuffled in, looking like a zombie and sat at the table, still half-asleep. Cas rolled his eyes and made a plate for her, cut off a large chunk of pancake, and placed the fork in Charlie’s hand. She slowly and clumsily put the food into her mouth and suddenly snapped awake.
That was their code for Sam wanting some advice he couldn’t go to their parents about. Mostly it was about getting out of trouble for breaking something, but with Sam getting older, Dean was pretty sure what he would soon be asking for advice about.
“Well,” Dean said, making up his mind, “Gotta bite the bullet sometime, right?”  And he marched right up to the crowd.
“Where?” Dean’s arm was a comforting weight around Cas’s shoulders.
on the counter. “They butchered my favorite character, Dean. Literally
Cas was taking his time constructing his burger. He didn’t ask himself why. “He said something similar about you, actually. Said you like to feed people more than they can eat.”
the one out front all the time; who’s to say they ain’t thirsty for you?”
“Look, Cas,” Dean said quietly.  “I - I missed you.  I’ve said that.  And you missed me.”
“You okay?” Dean asks, as they make their way to the building door.  “You’re squinting again.”
It took Cas a few seconds to comprehend those five words through the initial shock, then another few to come up with an answer that felt right.
When he straightened, Sam dumped Willow into his arms.  “Uncle Dean missed you,” Sam said, clapping Dean on the back.  “Will you hold her?  Gotta go help Eileen with the food.”  Without waiting for an answer, Sam skipped off to where Eileen was approaching with a dish in her hands.
Dean dropped his keys.  “Uh, yeah,” he said, as he scooped them up from the floor.  It was barely 8, but
Dean looked like he was about to make a joke, but then thought better of it. “Too… loud?” he asked. His eyes skimmed over the neat button-down that Cas wore and Cas knew he was already coming to certain conclusions that Cas wasn’t sure he liked.
He had thought he could accept Cas and Daphne, but now, seconds away from the words spilling into reality, he knew he couldn’t.  And then Cas would know.  Cas would know by Dean’s reaction that Dean was in love with him.
“Oh, honey,” his mom said.  “I know a lot of things you don’t, but I’m not sure you’re ready to hear them.”
“Mom.”
Cas smiled and hid his face in Dean’s neck. After a pause, he said, almost shyly, “By the way. Since we’re doing things all out of order.”
“Yeah, I
Cas finally sighed.  “I don’t know how you’re going to react to this,” he said slowly.  “But I have to tell you something.”
clingy.  The friendship had started out great: Aaron was fun to talk to, great to watch the game with, and didn’t complain about Dean’s music.  But then Aaron had started calling
“Don’t worry about it, dude,” Sam said easily.  Somewhere in the background, people cheered.  Sam’s voice was laced with a grin.  “Happy New Year, by the way.”
“If it happens,” Cas agreed.  “Thank you.”
“I’ll be back in three days max.”
Cas is getting back into position, walking backwards so he can throw one last remark at Dean: “You shouldn’t even be on the field with skills like that.”
Cas’s smile was sad, so sad.  “Thank you,” he said.  He looked down at his shoes.  Brown.  Sensible.  Just like Daphne’s.  “I missed you.”  Cas’s voice was quiet.
Dean didn’t say anything. He just watched helpelessly as Cas hung up the last ornament in his hand and started toward his bedroom.
“Oh, that thing?” Cas asked. “I got it last week.”
“Already read it,” Dean said, biting down on a grin when he saw Cas’s surprise. “Dude, I introduced you to his stuff - you think I don’t know what he’s up to?”
They lapse into silence.  Cas finishes his eggs and mops up the ketchup with his last bite of toast.  He doesn’t take out his phone, and Dean’s more than willing to sit there and watch.
Gilda smiled at him and reached up to touch his hair gently.  There was movement behind her - someone was getting up from the blanket - but Dean was too surprised by the feeling of Gilda’s hand near his ear that all he could do was gape.  Then Gilda said, very kindly, so softly no one else could hear, “Sorry, but no.”
“You’ve also got a hand up my shirt,” Dean supplies unhelpfully, “if you wanted to get around to removing that.”
In a little bit, Dean knows, Cas will pour out two mugs of coffee and sit at the table with his phone out and wait for Dean to join him.  They’ll sip at their coffee and wonder aloud who’s going to make breakfast until finally Dean will cave and make an omelette or something.  It’s always been that way.
The week passed by quickly.  Dean’s restoration shop maintained a constant flow of customers, and on Wednesday he even had to ask (beg) Bobby to come in to help ease the strain on his mechanics, despite having also donned his old pair of coveralls for a shift.  The work felt good for him, and it succeeded in distracting him from the utter bullshit it was that Cas was actually considering a return to Daphne.
“I’m sure you can find others to help while she’s sorting things out.”
It must have worked because when Dean drew back, his eyes were misty and his smile was back. “I never let myself think I could have this,” he said.
Dean had finally closed his mouth; a corner of his lips started twitching upward. He didn’t tear his eyes away from Cas’s gaze when he knocked on Sam’s desk to get his attention. “We’ll bring you something back.”
It wasn’t that he wasn’t flattered by Dean’s attention - on the contrary, underneath the layers of panic, Cas could recognize the beginnings of something a little like giddiness, albeit complicated by Cas’s relationship with dating and sex. He wasn’t normally interested in either, which usually suited him just fine; it was when he
When he thinks he’s ready, he walks out of his bedroom and into the hallway, savoring the stark coldness of the tile against his bare feet.  Trying to tether himself to the dream, he touches the smooth walls on either side of him and focuses on the friction against on his fingertips.
“I love it when you speak nerdy.”
“Never better,” he whispers, leaning forward.  The hand he has on Cas’s cheek slips to the back of Cas’s neck.
“I really won’t be upset if you decide not to kiss me, Dean,” Cas says, his last defense.
Dean decided to help her out a little.  “If you’re free after this, do you wanna grab a drink?”  Once the words were out, he was struck by how much he
Dean scowled. “Why?”
“Thanks for changing the sheets,” he mumbled sleepily.
Silence. Cas’s brow furrowed. Then his eyes were open and narrowed at Dean. His hair was already hopelessly mussed. “What do I think of
Dinner was… easy. Being with Dean was easy. Easy enough that Cas forgot that he was supposed to be making it difficult. Instead he found himself leaning forward to hear Dean’s stories, smiling when he smiled, and laughing when he laughed. Dean was magnetic, and he was in a good mood. He seemed to want to know about Cas and his life and his family, and he eagerly expounded when Cas asked questions right back.
“You played it so goddamn cool,” Dean accused. “I was about to leave.”
“Yes,” Cas said simply.  “Thanks for the pie.  You can go now.”
“A good friend, then,” Gilda concluded.
was terrified, Dean couldn’t comprehend. Maybe Cas was terrified of the crimes Dean was capable of, and maybe law enforcement was coming to serve justice.
Dean hangs his head.  He understands.  He’s still pissed, still frustrated, but he makes up his mind.  He slams his locker to get everyone’s attention.  “Just figured you all would want to know,” he says loudly, a little angrily, “I’m asking Cas to marry me tonight.”
“Their dog,” Cas remembers.
“Of course - so the speaker has a choice,” Cas recalled. “But I think if I had a choice in that situation, you’d tell me to evacuate.”
“I hope he and I can still be friends,” Cas said, after a small pause. It was a hope that Cas had only just recognized, but one he sincerely wished for, now that it had made itself known.
It’s not as if Cas hadn’t had time to prepare for this.  It had only been a few days, yes, but 72 hours should have been more than enough to prepare an FBI Special Agent for this assignment.
“If you’re holding me back, it’s only because you won’t come with me.” It was the truth, or as close to the truth as Cas could get.
Cas sat down and unfolded his napkin.  “I suppose.”
Dean handed him a napkin, waved off Cas’s thanks, then scratched his neck. “When I gave the key to you I kind of figured you’d use it for…” He made a vague gesture, but let his sentence trail off.
Dean, driving. Cas handing him a disposable face mask before they get out of the car. Worried frowns hidden behind cotton and elastic. Without speaking, they quickly understand their roles: Dean handles the cart and Cas handles the groceries. They watch each other - what they touch and what they don’t. Cas watches as Dean weaves through the shoppers, his mouth a thin line every time someone gets too close to him.
Dean approached Cas later when Claire was out on a beef jerky run for Dean. The shop was empty, and Cas, perched on a stool waiting for customers, was struggling in his Words with Friends game against Gabriel.
“I missed you too,” Cas said, once he’d sat down.  “But I wasn’t going to drive to Kansas to see you.”
Enough space for a family, maybe.
“You know you talk in your sleep?”
“Dude, they barely see me,” he said when Cas voiced his thoughts after closing one night. “
“Still don’t want to hear it.”
Dean watched Cas’s face for a long time.  Cas watched right back.  It seemed like the first time he had
“Probably because you didn’t bother to turn up the heat when you came in last night. Also you’re practically naked.”
“A plan,” Cas repeated numbly. He tried to understand what Dean was getting at, tried to think of some other ‘plan’ that Dean might have thought of that wasn’t what Cas was hoping for, but he drew a blank.
“I still don’t know,” Dean said.  “I kept trying to charm her but it only worked so far.  I was hoping she’d let me in on whatever she was doing with her position of power, but that never happened.  I think she was still testing me.”  His voice was quieter when he said the next part:  “Which means those two years out there were… useless.”
Cas was swirling the whiskey in his glass around. His gaze and voice didn’t falter when he said, “And what do you think?”
Cas approached and lifted the covers so he could see Dean’s face. “I think you’ve received enough punishment judging by the state of you.”
“Do you - do you need help with that?”
Cas spared him a sad look. “I’ve never given you any indication that’s what I wanted - “
Cas was silent for so long that Dean started thinking of all the future lonely jerk-off sessions he’d be indulging in.  He comforted himself with the thought that at least he’d been able to make Cas come once in this short life, and that the memory was forever his to jerk off to.
Cas was staring at him from across the kitchen with his hands crossed over his chest. “I can appreciate that you’re a busy man, Dean, but you’re not just busy - you’re avoi -”
“Parking garage,” he replied numbly to one of the inquiring agents.  “I think he’s trying to get away.”
The moment was gone, the only trace of it left as an imprint of warmth on Cas’s side. “I’ve just tasted half of your menu, Dean,” Cas reminded him. “I don’t think I’ll be eating anything for a long time.”
“Great,” Charlie said.  “Only thing is I need someone to watch
Dean opened his eyes then and looked at Cas directly, pain making his eyes glossy.  “Cas - “
“Sorry,” Cas says, though the large bite of toast he’s just taken diminishes his apology.
Dean kisses him. It’s just a touch of his lips against Cas’s, small enough to argue that it was barely anything at all, but Cas knows it for what it is: a question he has to answer.
Whatever Dean had been about to say disintegrated on his lips when he realized that Cas was getting hard.  “Off,” was all he could say then, as he pulled on Cas’s shirt.  “
A pause. Dean gazed at his dark ceiling. His fan squeaked.
Underneath his phone number, he had written
“Oh.”
“That’s not nice.”
“Oh, no, I am,” the man corrected. He was wearing a trench coat that was too big in the shoulders. “I’m not much of a sci-fi fan, however. The world-building is always so tedious to read.”
The calls with his mom were perfunctory, and he didn’t dare bring up the Cas comment she had made because, he reasoned, Cas had given Dean no reason to worry about him and Daphne.  Unless Cas’s radio silence counted as reason to worry.  Was it reason to worry?  Dean couldn’t decide.
Dean had indeed been trying to sneak into his bedroom without being seen, but he wasn’t going to admit that. “It’s probably because you’re the weirdo who wears Santa hats when there’s no one around to see him.”
Dream Cas, with his hip leaning against the counter and his hands clutching an empty mug, is barely awake.  Still, he’s able to mumble out, “Good morning, Dean.”  His voice is softer than usual, a little muffled, like it’s been wrapped in cotton.  “How are you feeling?”
Having a plan made him feel better, especially when he climbed into Dean’s Impala to find Dean wearing a leather jacket and an endearingly nervous smile.
Cas cut her off before she finished. “We wanted to thank you for your help,” he said, which effectively stopped Claire’s tirade.
“You’re staring at me,” Cas says, though he’s looking down while he mixes his eggs, which are orange now.  “Is there a reason?”
“Alright,” Cas said.  He felt like he was floating.  He didn’t know if he could stop smiling.
“Well, if it was, I’d win.”
It occurs to Cas, somewhere in the back of his mind, that they’re no longer under the mistletoe.  There is no longer any pretense for what Dean’s tongue is suddenly doing on Cas’s neck. What they’re doing now is no longer part of a stupid tradition, a stupid prank forced on them by Cas’s brother.
Dean had to laugh. “I may be an asshole but I’m not a thief, dude.”
All of the lies he’d told over the past year of their friendship nagged at Dean’s conscience. When he’d told them, they’d been necessary ones, ones meant to be practical and safe, but here in this moment, with Cas nodding off in his passenger seat, trusting Dean with his safety and property? None of the lies seemed necessary any more.
“Okay,” Cas said.
Dean broke down their conversation, and Sam made sounds of irritation at the appropriate parts.  Dean supposed he deserved it.
spills out in every direction and Dean wants to take his time, wants to see where each thread of possibility might lead him, if one might lead him to a world in which Cas already
“‘Ey,” Dean protested. He sniffed. A tear fell from an irritated eye. “That’s rude.”
“For fuck’s sake, Cas,” Dean muttered, moving toward her.  He crouched in front of her and put a hand on her knee.  “Hey.  Sorry.  He’s - he’s miserable at this.”
Sam sighed heavily, but he shut up.  He followed Dean into the kitchen.  Right before Dean opened the back door, however, Sam made a tentative noise.  “Before you open that door - “ he started, but Dean was already holding up a hand.
“Though,” Cas added, clearing his throat, “it should be said that being able to see you in an apron is very much appreciated.”
“Do you want to keep touching me?” Dean asked, and hearing the words said out loud made them sound even dirtier than he intended.
Dean blew out a frustrated breath. “Whatever, man,” he said. He put a hand on the fireplace and glared at it. “If you’re still thinking of getting a house, this place is as good as it’ll get.”
Sam glared at him.  “I know your shriveled little heart has never heard of puppies, Dean, so I’m going to let that one slide.”
With a deep, calming breath, Cas opened the door.
“Just me,” Dean said lightly.  “Now can I tell you why I’m here?”
Charlie made him sleep on her couch.  He was too overwhelmed to drive home, she had told him, and when he still tried to sneak out, she’d caught him and threatened to call Cas.  That had been an effective deterrent, so Dean had borrowed a toothbrush and settled on her couch in his jeans.
Meanwhile, Cas plucked out another onion slice. “I don’t think I believed in Santa,” he said eventually. “But I knew about him. I wish I could remember who first told me the tale.”
Dean didn’t say anything.  He stared.
He was looking at bookmarks - maybe Eileen would appreciate a sturdier one - when another hand reached forward to browse through them too.

Before either man could respond, she had left the room. They ate in nervous silence a moment before Cas cleared his throat. “If you are free the rest of the day, we can watch more Harrison Ford movies...as long as they don’t have vampires.”

2) slow burn? sorry never met her
-Someone gets smooched
Hello, and welcome to the slow burn express, where the author starts to accelerate the process because she can't freaking help herself!
Charlie just looked back and forth between her two friends with a knowing smirk. She shoved the last bite of her food in her mouth and stood to put her plate in the dishwasher, “Well if you two get any sweeter, then I’m going to get diabetes. I’m gonna shower and I’ll be in the office. Try not to be too loud with any movies, or games, or vigorous love making.”
“Don’t remind me. I’m not sure whether I should eat light so I don’t throw up, or eat well so I don’t faint.”
Dean remembered the argument he had with his parents the day before and figured his house would be a bad idea. “The library is fine, easier to focus than my house.”
Cas held the two boxes like they were made of precious jewels. “Dean, you didn’t have to...Thank you.” He said knowing Dean would just shrug off any protests Cas made.
Castiel is the angel of thursday. So while i say this fic is an excuse to write loose plot around smut, i did put a tiny bit of thought into some of the finer points. Anyhoo, enjoy some dream sequences!
another longer one, that is completely unbeta'd and wasn't proofread. Sorry for the most likely obscene amout of errors. A quick minor warning for a slur that is used in the context of someone quoting an off-camera bully. Also warning for Dean being a dramatic bi.....
The first of Dean's dreams is revealed.
“You know it.” She replied, “Tons of fun, but I will burn you if you cross me.”

FUN FACT: Sugar-free baked goods are very good if you make them from scratch, not the box mixes, which taste like sawdust. My mom is diabetic and there has been a lot of experimenting with different recipes. Granted using sugar is tastier, but alternatives aren't unpleasent.
NEXT CHAPTER PREVIEW:
another look into one of Dean's dreams about Cas.
REAL LIFE PARALLELS:
Sam quietly nodded, concentration heavy on his face as he left Dean’s room. Dean went back to his homework and two hours later, Sam burst back into his room unannounced.
“I actually, kind of, really like her, in that way. She’s cool and smart and likes the same stuff I do. But I can’t imagine she thinks of me as anything more than a friend or a brother.”
“Awesome, how about I get the dishwasher started and you can go set it up?” Cas grabbed the remaining dishes from the table.
Dean watched Cas jog off to make sure he didn’t fall or anything. It was definitely not to watch his friend's ass and strong thighs in his jeans. Not at all. It was once he turned back to the bench to grab his stuff he saw Cas’s trench coat left behind. Dean rolled his eyes and went to call out to Cas, but the man was nowhere to be seen. Dean folded the coat and carried it to his car before heading back to the campus for his next class. He texted Cas that he would return the jacket to him tomorrow and that it was safely stored in his car. Cas sent a quick ‘thank you, I would have been panicked’ in return. It seemed like a bit of a dramatic response to a coat, but Dean has learned that Cas rarely feels or says anything without good reason or sincerity. So there must be some strong emotional attachment to the coat.

Not gonna lie....i may have only written this to make a bee reference.....
Cas just shook his head. “You both are impossible.”

“Cas, man. Anytime. I seriously love this stuff. If I wasn’t so easily distracted with wanting to tinker with cars and machines, I’d totally be a professional baker.”
“Of course we get to meet him, with the way you don’t shut up about him, it’s only a matter of time before you two started dating.” John reasoned.
-Dean and Cas have deja vu...
“Thanks,” Cas took the candy and quickly chewed and swallowed before they entered the room. Professor MacLeod had a strict no food, drink, or gum policy. They went into the room and took their usual spot in the corner. Usually their lab tables were empty, but this time there were a tray of tools and a packet on each station. Dean slid the tools to his side and handed Cas the packet. He then grabbed a few folders from his backpack and made a small wall between the two of them and blocking the table in front of them from Cas’s view.
“Dude, you eat meat. I’ve seen you eat meat.”
What you need to know: They cycled though a few of Deans dreams "off-screen". I didn't went to write all of them because it would have gotten too repeatitive, but one is mentioned. Also, Cas is still a virgin with a captital V. And Charlie is my favorite non-TFW character and I will protect her at all costs!
They said their goodbyes and then Dean was on his way. He made it home and quickly headed to his room, completely avoiding his family. He really wasn’t in the mood for their teasing about him being at Cas’s all night and morning. However, he knew he couldn’t avoid the subject forever because once they were all piled into his mom’s SUV, the questioning began.

A/N: For context, the Meg in my head for this fic is Meg 1.0 (Nicki Aycox). Who seemed more cruel to me than Meg 2.0 (Rachel Miner).
“Thank you Dean, that is very kind of you.”
Dean apparently dreams in AUs.
By my stars and garters (is that even a real saying), that Castiel has quite the dirty mouth! *clutches pearls*
“Wow, Sammy. I don’t blame you, I’d probably try and kick her ass too. But what does this have to do with a girlfriend?”

A little Deja Vu.....
-On TikTok (amieleighluna) I post a lot of reactions from me rewatching the series. I took a break because of family staying with us for a while, but i'm resuming and I'm on season 7
“I was thinking more like, bright, warm, and fiery. But whatever floats your boat.”
“That’s different, I don’t see it...still attached.”
“It worked, Dean. She kissed me. I got my first kiss and a girlfriend! You are the best brother ever!” Sam tackled Dean in a hug. The kid was all limbs so it was a bit awkward but Dean laughed everthemore.
ngl, idk if i like how this one turned out....
Dean and Cas actually talk

A SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER IS WRITTEN IN THE END NOTES IF YOU NEED TO SKIP THE CHAPTER
PREVIEW OF NEXT CHAPTER:
“I’m busy.” Dean grumbled.
-a "ray of terrifying sunshine" is what my friend calls me whenever I'm in my 'do no harm but take no shit' mood
“So maybe now you should listen to your own advice and talk to Cas?”
“Dean, they are called insides for a reason. They need to stay inside.” Cas sat on a bench.
“How do you know if a girl is just a friend or a girlfriend?”
Warning: Dean being kinda dorky...i know that doesn't need a warning, I just didn't have anything else to put here
Dean squinted at his little brother before hurling a pillow at the kid’s head. Sam dodged the projectile and laughed his way out of Dean’s room.
“Congrats, dude. I’m glad it worked out for you.” Dean said patting his brother’s head before pushing him away.
-We actually get to the science lab
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas golf carted them over to the science building, getting progressively paler as they got closer to the classroom door. Dean stopped them before they entered the room. “Dude, what are your levels right now?”
What? It's been months since I updated? Nooooo, no way!
-I'm gonna dedicate a "writing day" so hopefully I wont go 3/4 months without update again
“When you meet Cas?” Dean squinted at his mother.
-And they were roommates...oh my gawd they were roommates....
- "I Love You Forever": just a cute fluffy Dad!Cas and Dad!Dean fic. Jack is an actual toddler.
“It wasn’t a date. Charlie met a girl at the LARP thing and he needed a ride home. I just figured we’d grab food after. Then we watched a couple movies until Charlie got home, by then it was too late to drive. You know he has never seen a Harrison Ford movie? How anyone makes it 20 years of life and never knows the wonder of Star Wars or Indiana Jones is lost on me. Oh and get this, guess who his mom is! It’s Naomi Georgiadis, that girl you grew up with. Her family owns that Greek place. That’s Cas’s family. He lives in the grandfather’s house. Dude it’s huge, way too much house for just him and Charlie, but they only use the main floor and the basement. The kitchen is amazing and there's a media room with just about every video game system ever. Those are Charlie’s, I guess the government paid her really well for that computer program she developed. She can’t tell me fully what it does, but it’s still cool. Anyways, the house was really big, so I didn't have to sleep on a couch, I got a whole guest room to myself.”

Hey, also real quick, some announcements:
PREVIEW OF UPCOMING WORKS:
I AM SO SORRY FOR THE DELAY! I had finals and then started work again (because I'm finally fully vaxxed), so life has been a bit hectic. But to make up for it, I wrote an extra long chapter!
Once the rest of the class had handed in their dissections and their packets, Dean removed the folder wall and listened to the teacher’s closing statements. She assigned them homework in the book and told them of an upcoming quiz on various systems in the body. Cas was still looking pale, but once they got out of the building, color started returning to his face.
AKA the chapter leading to the big moment....maybe....
-Dean gives Cas a ride
A/N: phew, that's a lot of words! I'm usually between 1,000 and 2,000...but this was a whopping 5,232 words and most of them were writting in the last two hours before posting this. I'm hoping that now I'm a bit more settled into my new routine, I'll be faster with the next chapter post...but if all goes as planned, it will be another longer one.
When Dean had woken up, he hesitantly walked through the house to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He was going to get dressed, send Cas a quick thank you text, and leave, but the smell of coffee wafting from the kitchen stopped his plan. There stood Cas, in front of a Kurieg, in a t-shirt and fitted short shorts chugging a bottle of water. A light shine of sweat glistened from his temple. The sight was definitely something that Dean needed to commit to memory for a moment he could be alone. It turns out that Cas woke up early every morning to go for a run.
Sam beamed at Dean, “You know Dean….you gave me really good advice.”
Hey, I just met you...and this is crazy...but let's be best friends!
We also learn a bit more about Cas and Dean, too...but most importantly, CHARLIE IS IN THIS STORY!
“Oh my god, Dean! These are amazing!” Charlie started shoveling the food into her mouth. “I’m serious, Dean. If I were into dudes, I’d totally kiss you right now. And, honestly, I’m not ruling it out.”
- "Lab Partners": College AU, Dean hate disecting but his new lab partner hates it even more.
“Oh, yea. I work the first half of the day, but I’ll text you once I'm done. We can either meet at the library or maybe your place since it’s closer to campus than my house.”
The next day, Dean was still in a sour mood. He knew he overreacted to his parents’ assumptions about him and Cas, but he spent the last few years holding it all in and it just all came out. But Dean is also very stubborn and he wasn’t going to ever admit to them that he was wrong. Instead he silently packed up his school things, grabbed the brownies from the fridge, and drove off to school without a word spoken to anyone.
“Apparently…” Dean wearily looked at Sam.
“See you, Wednesday Dean.” Cas waved and turned to follow Charlie.
“As exciting as a sexless marriage to a lesbian sounds, please just thank me in a video game marathon sometime, instead.”

Cas discovers something new.
CHAPTER PREVIEW:
Cas and Dean study for an exam
“I don’t know. This girl at school, Meg. She’s really mean to Eileen because of her voice. She used to be worse, like hold Eileen's arms so she couldn’t sign or cover her eyes to stop her from reading lips. Meg’s the reason she stopped using her cochlear implant. Meg threw it in the toilet. When Eileen’s parents threatened to sue the school, Meg got suspended. Somehow she’s back, but it's mostly just taunting now. She mostly just messes with me, but nothing too bad. But today, Meg tripped Eileen on the way to the bus pickup and I got pissed and called her out and shoved her. I know I shouldn’t start fights with a girl, but she’s a total bitch.”
Dean chuckled at his baby brother’s innocence. “Well, usually with a girlfriend you hold hands, you kiss, you hug, you spend alone time together. But mostly, you just are attracted to each other. Why do you ask? Got yourself a little girlfriend, Sammy?”
“Great. See you tomorrow.” Cas waved again and then ran off to catch up with Charlie.
“Well, to an outsider, you two do spend a lot of time together. You kind of talk about her even when she’s not around. And you just hold really intense eye contact sometimes like you’re trying to speak telepathically.” Dean faced his brother. “The real question is, do you want her to be your girlfriend? Or if not, can you at least learn to deal with people thinking she is?”
“Cas, looking good as always.” Dean winked at him. To the untrained ear, it sounded like flirting but for Dean it was a normal greeting...mostly. “Charlie, still a ray of terrifying sunshine, I see.”
Warning: Author is a self proclaimed emotional cyborg and is very bad at properly portraying or writing emotions and is very insecure about how this chapter turned out..okay bye *hides*
- "10 Ways Dean Winchest is Totally NOT In Love with Cas": Spoiler alert, he is.
Dean laughed, “I say eat normally and try to relax. If you survive the lab, I’ll reward you with the sugar free brownies I made. I promise, they don’t suck.”
The last 2 dreams will be coming up and then we move to real life!
-Dean works through some internalized shit
was writing this after re-reading Four Letter Word a good idea?.....yes....yes it was and you can't convince me otherwise!
Cas blinked in confusion before seeing Dean point at his insulin pump and monitor on his waist. Cas looked down, “I’m a little low, but I’m scared to eat anything. It will just come back up.”
Also if you're here from TikTok, "Hello" *Jack wave*
This is probably my favorite chapter so far and it's a doozy.
“Hey Cas, wait.” Dean grabbed his arm. “We have that test Wednesday. Are you free tomorrow to study together?”
“Perfect.” Dean smiled and made his way to the media room. Once the film was set up, Cas entered the room with a bowl of popcorn. They settled in and watched the film in comfortable silence, only speaking when Cas had a question about the plot. Once the movie was over, it was almost noon and Dean knew he had to head home if he was going to shower and change in time for Sam’s soccer game. “I should head out, but I’ll see you tomorrow in school. It’s the big day in the lab.”
And now for something much happier and MUCH more inappropriate.
-The next day
.....i am so, so sorry....*ominus music*
A/N: I'm going to be honest, I hated writing this chapter, but it kind of just forced it's way through me. It's important to remember that this is a nightmare situation and not actual events in the story. The language of the chapter was especially difficult for me to write and I hope people heed the warnings.
-the conversation about Cas eating meat but hating seeing dead animals is an actual conversation I have had over and over being an animal lover but still eating meat.
Dean has a nightmare. (READ THE WARNINGS AT THE TOP OF THE CHAPTER)
Preview for next chapter:
AUTHOR'S REAL LIFE PARALLELS: I was in an anatomy class with my best friend that I kind of had a crush on. I hated the idea of cutting open any animals, but he was just very squeemish about dissecting in general, so I offered to do all the gross stuff so that he would think I was cool and brave. (Ultimately it worked because we dated on and off for the next 7 years but that's another story for another time). But I went for a bit of a role blending. I am more like the Cas in this verse. I didn't drive, I didn't watch many movies or shows growing up, I had a friend a lot like how Charlie is, and some upcoming character backgrounds apply to my personal history. He was more like this Dean, just kind of a 'go with the flow', inserts himself in your life and stays there, goofball. But there's a lot of me in this Dean, the baking, the 'go to college' ultimatum, the sarcasm. And he is in Cas's sarcasm and overall bluntness.
While this is not a case fic, the topic of this chapter is TECHNICALLY a case....but our boys are a bit distracted....
CHAPTER SUMMARY: Dean opts out of a post-hunt celebration to get some sleep, but has a horrific nightmare about J*hn Winchester being a homophobic piece of poop. Dream J*hn traps Dream Cas and violently beats him to death as Dean's dream self is paralyzed and forced to see Dream Cas die. Dream Dean begs for his own demise as Dream Sam starts to morph into Dream J*hn. In reality, Cas finds Dean in distress and wakes him. Cas comforts him and the two precious beans confess their love for each other.
-Lab Day
The system they set up worked. Cas hid behind the folder wall, shakily reading the steps to Dean. Dean grimaced his way through the actions while relaying answers to the questions in the packet. When they got to finding the specimen’s reproductive organs, Dean let out a gasp. Their rat had been pregnant at the time of her unfortunate death. When Cas asked what the gasp was for, Dean lied and said the smell was getting to him. Dean wanted to cry, but he really didn’t want to unset Cas, knowing how his friend feels about animals and animal suffering. Eventually, they got through all the steps and Dean was able to bring the tray back up to Professor MacLeod for inspection that the dissection was complete and the little tags he had to place were correct. She nodded at him, made a note in her grade book and placed the mutilated animal into a disposal unit. Dean then washed his hands vigorously, even though he had been wearing gloves. When he got back to the table, he adjusted the folders so they only blocked the other tables, but no longer separated him from Cas. They then worked together on the rest of the packet questions. The last page was for them to write a paragraph on what they observed. Dean took over from there, even though his handwriting wasn’t great. But he wrote about the pregnancy of their rat and the similarities to human organs. Cas quietly put his head down and waited as Dean silently finished writing and then turned in their packet.
